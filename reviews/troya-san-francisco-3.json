Made a reservation but they couldn't find it. It was practically empty when we arrived so it wasn't a problem. \n\nWe were seated in a cute wooden booth. Not the most comfy but nice. My fried started with a Turkish beer and we ordered a few small plates. \n\nDecided on the spiced fries ($6.50), dolmas ($12) and grilled cauliflower ($10). The fries were perfectly seasoned without being salty and came with a lemony garlic mayo. Fries were crispy and hot just like I like it! \n\nThe dolmas were my favorite dish of the entire meal. Four baby cabbage rolls stuffed with delicious beef and topped with a bright tomato sauce and a sexy tzatziki type white sauce. OMG I could eat those everyday! The grilled cauliflower was smokey and tender without being mushy. Served with the sexy tzatziki on the bottom of the dish. Overall, they supply several fantastic vegetable offerings here. \n\nFor our mains we split the vegetable moussaka and the salmon kebab platter. Moussaka was just ok in my opinion. Didn't taste the b\u00e9chamel sauce at all. It was kinda dry without it and the lentils were hard. It wasn't completely hot all the way through, either. It came with a deliciously moist, well seasoned rice with slivered almonds on top. The two sauces served with the meal were excellent as well but I would not order the moussaka again. I've had better. \n\nSalmon kebab was meaty and juicy. Perfectly cubed and served with kebab veggies that were grilled properly. It came with a simple, yet well dressed salad and yummy spiced rice with a creamy-spicy sauce on top. Super yummy dish that didn't leave me feeling heavy. Would definitely order again. \n\nWe ran out of beverages a few times. Wish the servers would have checked up on us more.", "author": "Rosalyn W."}

There are high top tables and regular seating. The service was really nice and attentive. \n\nWe decided to get two things to share: the Vegetable Moussaka with lentils, eggplant, zucchini, potatoes, and bechamel sauce ($17.50) and a Organic Chickpea Falafel Bowl ($12) with hummus, pita, greens, avocado, feta, and herb yogurt. \n\nThe Vegetable Moussaka in its appearance, looked like a Shepard's pie, but was amazing. It was savory, filling, and had a nearly perfect balance of flavors. The only thing I would say is that there was a tad too much bechamel sauce on top for me that caused it to be a bit heavy. The Falafel Bowl was a perfect, lighter dish that paired nicely with the heavier Vegetable Moussaka dish. The falafels were well done, not over cooked and the pita was good. I would have liked more tomatoes, as we got about 2 in the salad. \n\nI would definitely return...Maybe for lunch to try the wraps that they don't have at dinner or for brunch to try the Shakshuka!", "author": "April L."}

It's called, \"Troya.\" Troya serves the customers to taste their authentic and dazzling Mediterranean cuisines especially traditional Turkish dishes every 365 days a year! The atmosphere is very laid back and elegant as I welcomed there. The concept is much like visiting to your local Mediterranean restaurants, yet it's pretty modern and home-living feel filled with contemporary designs and furnitures across the whole interior room.\n\nThe employees here from servers and cookers here are doing an excellent job for making the customers like me a remarkable, friendly service! No cons!\n\nNow onto the food! Since it was dinner time already, I ordered right directly from the menu. It's called, \"Harissa Spiced Meatballs.\" It contains 4 meatballs with a side of seasoned basmati rice, mixed greens with dippables: Harissa and plain yogurt. As I ate it, that dish tasted wonderfully spectacular! I did felt the authentic flavors of both rice and the meatballs because of the natural spices and seasonings after cooked! The meatball weren't that dried which I did bite it for the first time. I wish the meatballs should cooked a little soft, but for me, it doesn't matter after all. I really loved the idea that you can dip the meatballs into any 2 dips, and it worked very well! The side of mixed green salad also tasted very good too thanks to the arrays of rinsed vegetables from lettuce (both red and green) to cherry tomatoes. What a way to complete my day during the night!\n\nParking at Troya can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nTo conclude, Troya is the most incredible and outstanding local Mediterranean Turkish restaurant that I've ever discovered and visited for the very first time! Perfect for friends, family and co-workers gathering! A well received! My rating: 5 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

I love the neighborhood it's in, but was disappointed by the restaurant itself. I started with the spiced brussels sprouts ($9), as that's what brought me to the restaurant to begin with. They were way too fried and almost completely tasteless. I found myself salting them, and you know when you're salting restaurant food you have a problem. I also ordered the roasted cauliflower ($14) as well, which was phenomenal. The portion size was huge and I loved the flavors. I wish I had skipped the brussels and ordered something else instead!", "author": "Kirsten H."}

Nice open look and very warm and inviting. They have beer on tap and wine as well. I sat at the bar since I was there by myself...hey, I see your judging face. How can you expect others to like your company if you yourself don't? Try it once in a while.\n\nI ordered the manti based on the recommendation from the waiter. Very nice presentation and it tasted yummy. Very flavorful and light. Not sure which came first but it reminded me of an Afghan dish called mantoo which is very similar.  \n\nThe waiters were all super cool. They all seemed very relaxed and friendly as I observed them talking to the patrons. I ended up having a conversation with a couple of them about restaurants in the area. It was like talking to friends and it was genuine interest and conversation since I had already paid the bill by that time. I am a fan!", "author": "Sunil R."}

Place was pretty empty. Love how open the restaurant space feels. Parking in the area wasn't too bad though we had to pay the meter. While the photos looked really interesting their weekday lunch menu had very few items I found unique. We ended up getting the following:\n\n1) Crispy Brussel Sprouts: Highly recommended by the server and they were good (though a bit pricey at $8 for a small bowl). Light and crispy. Slightly burnt bits complimented the soft full pieces. Nice slightly spicy aioli but also nothing I haven't gotten at a semi nice American place. (3.5/5)\n\n2) Turkish Spiced Fries: Mainly got these for my friend who has a fry addiction. Good spices on an average thin cut fry with some solid aioli. Once again fine, just nothing special (3.25/5)\n\n3) Lamb Shoulder: Well seasoned lamb meat w/ some flavorful rice and a side of salad. Not a ton of food for $16 since most of the plate is salad. Besides the presentation it's basically good street car food at a higher pricepoint (3.5/5)\n\nOverall Troya is a decent restaurant. Nothing is super unique in terms of menu options or flavors but they do what they do well. However, a lot of the price seems to just come down to presentation and atmosphere.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I was surprised to see the place so packed on a Tuesday night, which means they must be doing just fine...props to them! \n\nI'm sure it was because they were slammed but, the service was exceptionally slow and we had to get menus for ourselves and flag down the server to get attention. No matter because the kabobs were all delicious and the trio of apps were also a nice touch. I wasn't a huge fan of the brussel sprouts but, everything else was yummy. \n\nI think they realized how slow things were going because they brought out a complimentary dessert at the end of the meal which is always a classy move. \n\nGreat spot for some casual kabobs and a great option for take away.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

My co-workers and I came here recently for a team dinner and took over their communal table.\n\nHere's what I really liked and would recommend:\n- an eclectic selection of Starters (you can easily make a meal out of sharing three or four of them). My favorites included: the Trio of Dips (Hummus, Tzatziki & Muhamara) served with the freshest pita bread this side of the Adriatic; the Turkish Spiced Fries; and the Red Lentil Soup.\n- If you're crazy about kebabs like me, be sure to order the salmon and lamb kebabs. They come with basmati rice (topped with a tangy/garlic sauce), greens, herb yogurt, and harissa. If you're dining with friends, I'd recommend sharing ordering one of each kebab (lamb, salmon, and chicken).\n- Make sure to order extra hummus and pita bread (trust me, this stuff is addictive).\n- Plenty of veggie options if you have vegetarian friends in your dinner party.\n\nHere's what what wasn't so great:\n- the service (while friendly) was super SLOW on the night we dined. It took us 10-15 minutes to even get menus or put in our drink order. And after we received our starters, there was like a 30 minute gap between us getting our main course. It felt like they were disorganized or short-staffed.\n- the Crispy Brussels Sprouts were dry and lacking in flavor. Not even the aleppo aioli which they came with could save this dish.\n- this place is beer/wine only... so if you want a cocktail, I'd recommend stopping by Elite Cafe or Palmer's beforehand.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my meal here. It's certainly a reasonably priced lunch/dinner option for groups. Plus, it's fun to walk around Fillmore Street before and/or after your meal. The neighborhood is looking really good these days.", "author": "Kevin B."}

It was low 50s out and they had the door wide open. Brr. \n\nMy wife ordered the red lentil soup. It was pur\u00e9ed and had chili oil and some herbs on top. It was the only good part of the meal. \n\nMy wife ordered the falafel wrap. The wrap choice was pita or tortilla (no lovash?). She selected tortilla. What arrived was a bowl not a wrap and with pita not tortilla. I ordered veg and halumi cheese skewers. I asked if they could leave the cheese out but apparently the skewers are premade. It was supposed to come with salad and rice. It came with salad and some sad looking quinoa. When I inquired about rice the waitress said the vegetables are served with quinoa. The menu says nothing about this but she offered to bring rice while correcting my spouse's order. \n\nThe rice was ok. The quinoa was awful and I generally like quinoa. The vegetables were pretty sad - not much flavor, not very evenly cooked and the big shame was lousy eggplant. \n\nThe falafel wrap was really bad and my wife barely ate it. The falafel was cold as if it just came out of the frig. \n\nAll in all this was a big waste of $38.", "author": "Marco M."}

Far too often I am confronted with the decision of going to a hole-in-the-wall Mediterranean place where I'd prefer ordering takeout or have to go to one of those overly fancy establishments that cost a lot more $$$ than I'd prefer dishing out. Troya is a godsend in this regard - using the classic 'order at counter, take your table sign number' method after paying at the register. Quick, easy way to get your food.\n\nThe food couldn't have been any better. The braised lamb was so soft and tender, as if they've been braising the meat for years. The hummus is punchy, fresh, flavorful. The falafel tastes wholesomely homemade. And last but not least, the kunefe was a masterpiece.

They said no because the skewers were already made up.  Really.  How hard can it be to cut up or re-skewer some veggies.  There was only 1 other diner in the whole place so they were not busy.  And it made no sense on their part money-wise because cheese is more expensive than peppers.  \n\nFor $17, we expected those veggies to be beautifully seasoned and grilled.  They weren't.  The eggplant was raw and rubbery.  Any Middle Eastern restaurant that cannot cook eggplant should immediately close its doors in great shame. \n\nSaid kabobs were supposed to be served with rice.

My boyfriend and I lived a few blocks from this local spot for about a year and had to restrain ourselves from coming in every night! Eventually, we got to know the staff and owners, who are extremely kind and welcoming. They helped us celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, accomplishments, and even our recent move away from the city. We were so sad to leave this place that we saved it for our last dinner! That night they surprised us with a gift of a few of our favorite recipes and handwritten notes. It was magical. \n\nTips:\n- Get the brussel sprouts. Trust me. They're some of the best I've had.\n- Ask for extra harissa sauce with whatever you get. They make it in-house and no other harissa I've had even compares.\n- The Greek red wine blend is lovely\n- The cinnamon braised lamb is probably one of my boyfriend's top 5 dishes of all time. It's tender and flavorful, but not too game-y or rich\n- The red pepper muhamara (I know I butchered the spelling...) is the best appetizer dip by far.\n- The chicken sqwers are always tenderly cooked and juicy", "author": "Morgan W."}

Kinda makes me want to check out their restaurant and pig out on lamb.  So tasty.\n\nBraised Lamb Wrap: One of the best wraps I've had in San Francisco.  It appears that the lamb is slow braised to make it tender, but then grilled/griddled to give it a bit of crunch.  Seriously better than that mass produced gyro meat others tend to sling.  The wrap bread was fresh and tender (albeit a bit too bready by the ends).  Loved the spicy/creamy sauce.  Just the right amount of veggies without being overwhelming.  But wow, I still keep thinking about that lamb meat though, so good!\n\nFalafel Bowl: A bit disappointing.  The outer edges of the falafel were a bit soft instead of that just out of the fryer crunch.  Also, the inner texture/taste wasn't that memorable.

When we arrived, we had a table set up for 12 people and no high chair. They brought over a high chair, but we were sitting at a high top table, and the high chair was not tall enough for it. One member of our party was not able to make it, and the two year old was able to sit in his stroller, so it all worked out.

First off, we had to order and pay at the counter in the late afternoon even though there were 3 people literally standing around. The meal itself was decent, though not up to par. But the piece de resistance was getting a last-minute bill on the table for $1.12 for 5 small extra pieces of pita. I am not making this up. My perplexed friend handed me the piece of paper. When I went to pay upfront I told the manager I was disappointed in this petty pita charge. Instead of employing good customer service tactics like making the customer feel better, he proceeded to tell me how he can't afford to give pita away and became extremely defensive. Then he had the nerve to ask me if I had a $1 instead of a $20 and he would not charge me the 12 cents -- I'm not making this up. He then proceeded to give me $19 in...wait for it...singles.

The food was wonderful, and the staff was really helpful and attentive. Check this place out!  The starters were incredible - check the red pepper and walnut dip, and the \"Turkish Fries\". My sister had the braised lamb shoulder; the meat was meltingly tender. My brother in-law had the meat balls with balsamic rice, and was effusive in praise of the spicing.  I had the manti as my entree - centimeter square  beef ravioli in a yoghurt sauce - beautifully spiced, with the yougurt creaminess offsetting the heat of the spicing, perfectly balanced. My order took a while to come out - the staff apologized for the delay; but it was clear that it took awhile because the dish had been made fresh, from scratch! (I always order manti as the test dish for a Turkihs or Afghan restaurant; if the manti is good, everything will be good. Toya passed the test with high marks!)

On the other hand, the cauliflower plate was huge.\n\nI think you're supposed to get complimentary chips, which we didn't get, but received after asking.\n\nWe agreed that we may have just ordered the wrong things, considering that I usually come into a Mediterranean restaurant craving lamb and hummus.

Clearly, this sends the message that the staff is ready to go home, so finish up and move on. Overall, the experience was unfortunate but I can see where the staff was taking their cues... from the manager. Although he greeted us and led us to the table, the rest of the evening he was more concerned with 'closing the books' than ensuring the patrons were enjoying the evening.

For Italian, I want hearty, stick-to-your-rubs rustic dishes. For Chinese, the dingier the restaurant, the better. Sticky tables? Flies? They just add to the authenticity. For Mexican, no head (cabeza) and no lengua (tongue) on the menu? Adios.\n\nBeing a fan of Troya's original location in Inner Richmond (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/troya-san-francisco#hrid:z2rd1mAYwRonuYfJdLRfHQ), their new Fillmore location (formerly Citizen Cake) was a complete disappointment. The Turkish dishes here are Californian-inspired (different menu than Inner Richmond) and the service lacks the warmth and charm of their original location.\n\nI know it's Pac Heights and all but ballers should have non-bougie, authentic cuisine available to them too. \n\nMake sure to call in for reservations (not on OpenTable yet) because we ended up waiting for 2 hours on a Friday night. Totally NOT worth the wait (I was too gin happy at the time to care). Even with no wait, I wouldn't return to this location. \n\nF O O D\n*HUMMUS w/ Turkish Bread ($5) - 2 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o4x29HYKvEUf7Regrn-J9g?select=3L_wrcsl_o_q4fbknylRQQ#P6SpVcBbN3vDqscnBKr48Q\nI like my hummus smooth and creamy. This hummus had an unappetizing chunky granular texture. It was also yearning for more lemon juice and salt as it was very bland. \n\n*FETA CHEESE CIGARS w/ Pistachio & Honey ($7) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o4x29HYKvEUf7Regrn-J9g?select=3L_wrcsl_o_q4fbknylRQQ#gN9S7jJYSU1tU7F42KNMow\nYou can never go wrong with anything fried right?

Though the moussaka was creamy and decadent, it was severely under seasoned and incredibly bland. It was like eating spoonfuls of semi-solidified unsalted cream. \n\n*GRILLED VEGGIES w/ Mushrooms ($11) - 2 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o4x29HYKvEUf7Regrn-J9g?select=DSSwmMbcWi8KnlxfUXaUUA#3L_wrcsl_o_q4fbknylRQQ\nNot sure how you can easily mess up a dish as simple as grilled veggies but they somehow managed to.

It's nice to see the space filled with happy diners and a high level of excellent service.  Not having a reservation on a Saturday evening, we were offered a seat at the bar where we led off with some fine New Zealand Pinot Noir by the glass ($9).  We graduated onto mezes and shared an entree.  Our waitress was right in saying this would be plenty of food.    \n\nOf the mezes we ordered, my favorites were:  \n\n*  Feta cheese cigars with pistachio, honey, and cinnamon ($7) - With their oozy, melty, salty filling I could eat these all night long.  I love these things.  I wish I could order a platterful.\n \n* Zucchini fritters ($8) -  These were hot and spicy, crunchy and well flavored.  A perfect companion was the mint dipping sauce accompaniment.  A platter of this would be desirable as well.     \n\n*  Roasted caluliflower with spring onion - I make roasted cauliflower all the time so it practically kills me to pay $9 for someone else to make it.  This was good though (as is mine) and it was a nice balance to the other flavors we sampled.\n\n* Roast asparagus - This was on the specials menu.  Again, roasting asparagus at home is a snap but they added some artichokes and tomatoes and the whole thing tasted good, not grand.     \n\nI really didn't care much for the cracker-like flatbread that they serve in a cup nor the turkish bread that accompanied the trio of Babaganoush, Haydari, and Muhammara ($14).   Both seemed more like supporting vehicles for delivering things that taste better.  In this case, that would be only the Haydari, a white Turkish yogurt dip.  The Babaganoush had an odd grey color and tasted burnt.  The orangy-red Muhammara tasted oddly of nothing.  In the future, I'd skip this meze altogether and substitute something else in its place.  Fried calamari, perhaps?\n\nWe shared the moussaka entree ($19) which proved a wise decision.  Though not bad it was a large serving and its one-dimensional mouth-feel (cinnamony and rich) meant that I would've quickly tired of the taste.  As it was, we brought 50% home for a future meal.  I'd get this again, but only if I were sharing it amongst 3 - 4 people.  \n\nThough Troya was full with people the restaurant had a quiet energy.  It was easy to carry on a conversation, even at the bar.   I think the place is solid, but it might take some careful menu sampling to come up with a meal where everything is universally delicious.  I'd not be opposed to sampling more widely to really hone in on the things that taste great.", "author": "Tracey A."}

The service was just the right amount of giving us attention when we needed something.  \n\nThe ONLY complaint I have is about how the place added the health care tax. It looks like the city requires so much per hour to be paid into the health insurance fund.  I have no problem with that and even if I did, it doesn't matter.  The issue I have is that Troya adds on the tax at the end instead of adding it into the cost on the menu, like most other restaurants have done. \n\nI would go back for sure because the food and service was enjoyable, but hopefully Troya will read this review and just add the extra charge in their menu prices.", "author": "Robert G."}

The average portion size is also on the low side - both for small plates and for the entrees.\n\nPoor: The wine pour in the glass was definitely on the low end of 5oz if not even lower.

Probably my favorite dish out of the meal, but I really like flaky dough and spinach and pine nuts.\n~ Calamari salad: probably the most ordinary out of the three appetizers; it had a refreshing salad and not too many or too fried calamari. \n\nAs for the restaurant, it just took the place of Citizen Cake, and redecorated it to be a trendy, dimly lit mediterranean place.

We were originally going to go to another restaurant, but the wait was too long and came over here after walking by, and I'm glad we did. The service was top notch, I could not ask for better service. I called the restaurant asking if they had a wait and the host informed me over the phone that she will take my name and possibly have a table when we arrived. 30 seconds later we walk in the host knew that I was the one who called and told us a table was leaving and once they clean it up they can seat us.  Once we sat down the server gave us some ideas on what to order since we wanted to try them all. Loved the hummus plate and the lamb; it made us wanting more. Troya you are #1 go to place for Turkish food.", "author": "Matthew L."}

It wasn't horrible but it really didn't feed my hunger or soul, which is something I expect from Mediterranean food.  My roommate and I shared the beef dumplings and the lamb kabob plate and were still really hungry 2 plates and $40 later.  The kabob plate was far from worthy of its $19 price tag and the beef dumplings seemed bland to me.  Maybe we were just grumpy because our wine glasses seemed  lacking in quantity for the price as well.\n\nIt was really empty the weeknight that we ate there so it was pretty quiet and a bit chilly but it's a pleasing space with a woody-modern feel and the service was fine.

It was so flavorful and tasty! We had the hummus appetizer; the homemade pita bread that came with it was divine, and the combo of hummus, fruits and nuts was just perfect! Our entrees, the lamb meatball Mediterranean wrap and the lamb kebab, were also really good! The flavors in their food is just right, the only thing that was just ok was the rice that came with the lamb; it tasted a little plain. Service was attentive (although at the time there were not many patrons in the restaurant so there was no excuse not to be, but still) and friendly, the interior of the restaurant was very urban chic, and there was enough room even for a high chair for our daughter without feeling squeezed (not guaranteed in SF restaurants). The only complaint I might add and the reason I gave this place four instead of five stars is that there were two bathrooms, but neither had a changing station for babies even though one of them was big enough to have one. As a mom, this is a new pet peeve of mine (something I never paid attention to prior to becoming a parent, but now it's very important... nothing worse than having to put a moving baby on a bathroom floor to change her diaper, hoping she will not roll off the changing mat onto the dirty floor!)\n\nWe would definitely eat here again, we would just make sure our daughter has on a fresh diaper before we go in (or better, management could install a diaper changing station in one of the bathrooms!!) :)\n\nDelete review", "author": "Elisabeth M."}

I liked that the kebab came with green salad and was well balanced in the amount of meat, salad and roasted vegetables. The accompanying eggplant paste did not have a flavour definite enough to really add a substantial accent to the taste of the kebab. When the dish arrived, it occurred that there is no staple included, so I had to hold on and wait for bread; it would have positively contributed to the experience if the waiter suggested the side of lavash bread upfront. The ambiance is nice and classy. My overall opinion is that this is an OK American restaurant serving Mediterranean food, but there are better options if you are looking for something not that classy but more authentic.", "author": "Grzegorz J."}

Plates are smaller, service is posh (they have a Cultery Boy), and it'll cost you $45 a person before you're done.\n\nThe food, however, will be worth it.  Highlights from dinner: Turkish bread, spinach boreks, manti (\"Turkish beef dumplings\"), \"flatbread\", and the baklava.  I think this may be the only restaurant in San Francisco where you can get authentic, hand-made manti.  And I generally don't like baklava and don't eat it anywhere but Troya.  It's that good.\n\nNote that the meze plates are small. If you choose to make a meal entirely from meze, you'll need 2-3 plates per person.  This is a good thing, it keeps you from option paralysis on the menu.  Just order one of everything!\n\nEverything is made in-house from scratch.  While waiting for the bathroom, I watched one of the Turkish owner's female relatives supervising the kitchen staff.\n\nThey've kept the decor and furnishings from the former Citizen Cake, so it's all hard surfaces; Troya will be very noisy once it's full.  Wine selection is modest but affordable, and includes some Greek and Turkish wines.\n\nShould definitely be on your list of options for dining on the Fillmore next time you go.", "author": "Josh B."}

I had already had dinner so was just going to pick at food while my companion chowed down. First off, loved the look of this place. Red brick, wood panels at the bar, and wonderful unique lighting really enhance the space and totally match my decor style.\n\nWe ended up ordering:\nHummus, Haydari & Muhammara with House Made Turkish Bread -- The walnut pesto spread was tasty but the other two were a little disappointing. The hummus was not the creamy homemade goodness I was expecting, and the strained yogurt was pretty bland except for some dill mixed in. Probably would not get again, especially since they have a spicy side sauce that was tastier than all of them that you can get for free.\nMarinated Lamb Kebab with Onions, Peppers & Eggplant Puree -- Apparently very very good lamb. The kebabs themselves were very tasty (according to my dining buddy) though two things that were offputting: 1. they wouldn't accomodate one chicken skewer and one lamb so that he could try more of the menu and 2. while the eggplant puree was excellent to pick at, the skewers don't come with any rice or anything to really turn the kebab into a meal.\n\nThey have a pretty limited menu which isn't a big deal if you have some heavy hitting golden dishes but I just didn't see those here. Limited veggie entrees (just a veggie kebab) so would recommend adding some there. \n\nHad good drinks. Their New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc was excellent and they have a red Turkish beer (forgetting the name) which was very tasty as well.\n\nI'm sure they'll enhance the menu and get better in time. Will probably try back in a few months.", "author": "Raina B."}

Oh, and a secluded single window side table. \n\nI went with friends who, like me, were interested in sampling. First of all, the wine list seems to have been set by a professional tasteful sommelier. The Pinot Noir from NZ is excellent. There were at least 3 French wines that were all good. Apparently, the delicious fresh bread is by an authentic baker. The chef added items that are different from the menu at the original Troya (on Clement) such as mussels, Calif cod fish, and a selection of flat bread items (similar to pizza but folded along the sides to a boat-like shape). Zucchini fritters were light and tasty. The fish was perfectly cooked (the only item on the menu above $20 which is reasonable for high quality fish). Moussaka (eggplant-based dish) was very good but I wish they have it also as vegetarian. \n\nWe chose the communal table which allowed for an overview of the entire restaurant. It also allowed us to socialize with a nice group of people who chose to sit there as well. Great for a single diner if you want to carry on conversation with strangers over dinner. And I would say the same about the bar where I sat waiting for my friends and was nicely welcomed by the owner (real cool person!) and staff. Although we were so full but we didn't want to pass on the desserts. Glad we didn't: we ended up sharing a floating flan-like cultured served in a cute little jar and a large kanafeh (shreded wheat with sweet light cheese). Both were delicious. \n\nOver all,  we had a great experience and would definitely go back and probably soon.", "author": "amy k."}

We ordered a trio of yogurts w bread, feta sticks w honey, brussel sprouts, grilled calamari, cauliflower, and the meatballs. Each dish came out separately in that order and they waited til it was done before bringing the next. It would have been nice to have it timed better (together) - this isn't exactly fine dining where each dish should be savored individually. Really the yogurt would have been nice w everything else. The cauliflower was a particular disappointment. Neither of us ate any of it and the server said he'd take it off the bill (but he forgot to). \nOn a positive note the meatballs were delicious! Maybe a little heavy on the dried fruit but overall it's a good dish to try. \nI'm not sure we'll return any time soon, which is too bad bc it seems like such a nice spot (nice active ambience).

Ever since a grand tour of Turkey a few years back, I've been eager to find a great Turkish restaurant in the Bay Area.  While I could appreciate all the bold flavors and generous portion sizes, I found the flavors and the meal overpowering.  The roasted cauliflower meze was overly salty, although the lamb kebab was tasty and filling enough.  We enjoyed the flatbread, but it was not outstanding.  When we asked if they had baklava, the server said they did and asked if we wanted one or two orders.  When we asked him his recommendation given that we couldn't finish all the food, he said two.  It turned out to be too much - we ended up with two servings of baklava and a scoop of ice cream each.  Normally too much dessert is just fine with me, but their baklava was filler dense rather than delicately and refinely sweet.", "author": "Peg S."}

With this restaurant, it's hit-or-miss with the menu.  We didn't order much:  \n-Beef dumplings: very good!  \n-Zucchini fritters: not very warm, seemed pre-made and not fresh.  Would not order this again.\n-Mussels: Good until my friend pointed out that they tasted very \"fishy\" and Briney.  I think I was really distracted by dipping my bread into the broth so I didn't notice as much.  \n\nThe staff was very nice, the restaurant had a great ambiance (and no one was snotty even though we were dressed down), and there was no wait at around 7:30 or 8, but this was on a Tuesday night.    \n\nI feel like I might go back to Troya to try other dishes on the menu.  We were not that impressed with what we ordered and left feeling like we had ordered the wrong things.  Better luck next time?", "author": "Alison K."}

We knew they had one table outside. Anyway, we noticed they had haloumi cheese on the menu as a filling for the brunch omelet, but asked them if they'd grill it instead and serve it to us as an app - since that's the way we are used to eating haloumi cheese. The server was so nice about it and they fulfilled our request. It was so delicious. We have had a really hard time finding haloumi cheese in SF so we were pleasantly surprised. We enjoyed the cheese and hummus app with the Turkish iced tea. Loved the fact they bring you a whole pitcher of tea. My husband drinks iced tea so fast, the poor server is usually going back and fourth to refill his glass. Smart thinking on their part. For entrees we had the chicken pesto wrap and yellowtail kabobs. We loved them both and finished off the meal with Turkish Coffee. We are SO glad we discovered Troya and will undoubtedly return regularly.", "author": "Kelsey K."}

I went there for dinner recently and found the food to be heavy.  The grilled calamari dish was smothered in this creamy sauce and the mushroom dish had a super strong butter flavor.  I thought I ordered healthier options and that Mediterranean cuisine tends to be lighter but this was not the case in my experience.  We ordered a chocolate cake for dessert after the waitress said it was \"light.\"  After one bite, my friend and I universally thought it was  pretty heavy.  I am not a health freak, but after the meal, I just wanted to go home do some push ups and stomach exercises.

The portion sizes are tiny and the mezzes don't even come with bread...you have to order separately. The bread is a bit dry and flavorless too. My first experience wasn't that great, so I went back there yesterday to give it another shot.

I'm vegetarian (I eat eggs and dairy products) and my friend eats everything.  There were so many good options from which to choose!!  We were both very, very happy with the entire meal and with our drinks.  We split the zucchini cakes with mint and yogurt sauces on the side and \"cigars\" (full of feta and other yummy things) with honey and pistachio on the side.  For dinner, I had the eggplant and feta Anatolian flat bread (amazing!) and my friend had a lamb dish with stewed tomatoes, onions and a yogurt sauce.  The portions are generous.  Nonetheless, we each had a dessert (that was our only mistake) - we should have shared ONE dessert - they are huge!! My friend enjoyed the Turkish coffee a lot.  We will be back.

All the employees looked miserable and didn't smile once. It took about 20 minutes to even get our drinks. The food came out about 30 minutes later and it tastes horrible and not authentic at all. We tried using a groupon and they claimed they weren't taking groupons on Mother's Day (WHAT F**** BULLSHIT). I couldn't believe the service and on top of that the food was disgusting.

I really was displeased with Troya Fillmore for a number of reasons. First, I couldn't hear a word my date was saying across the long table. We were squished between other tables and under a hot light like an interrogation. The calamari was very strange. I couldn't understand the waitresses accent. They didn't take away our empty plates and made it hard to eat. However, they did ask about 20 times if we wanted more wine. The bill was expensive and we didn't even order two entrees. This was a much worse experience than visiting Troya on Clement. The biggest problem was that it was exceptionally LOUD. I felt like I was at a concert.

(Nowhere on the menu did the description of this flatbread include chili flakes.)  The crackers served before the meal were boring and should have been accompanied by some type of dipping sauce.

We ordered the grilled haloumi salad as an appetizer which was average -- the haloumi slices were left in slabs (may have been better if cut smaller) and the persimmons felt out of place in the dish. We tried the roasted broccolini flatbread which was excellent -- the smoked shishoto-like peppers with the roasted broccolini and kalamatas was the perfect balance of smoky, spicy, and salty with a cooling kasselini cheese. We got the cauliflower beyti as the main dish and this was stellar -- arguably one of the best vegetarian dishes available in the city. The cauliflower was roasted and spiced perfectly and the yogurt and red sauce was a perfect balance.

Along with the kebab, I had the  Arugula Salad which was light and fresh with lots of flavor.  For my main course I tried the grilled tuna! Very good! I eat a lot of fresh fish so I had something to compare it to. Fish was cooked just right and not over done.   Being someone who is conscience of what I eat, I tend to be a little picky.  Trying to get good quality food in a restaurant isn't always easy.  They use lots of fresh ingredients which is something I am always looking for when I go out. Troya had some great options.
