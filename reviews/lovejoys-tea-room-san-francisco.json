The process was super smooth and I made reservations ahead of time to accommodate a larger party. Gina was the one emailing me back and forth and though I was somewhat unresponsive (I'm sorry!) due to not getting voicemails in time and just being bad at responding to emails because work was busy.. she was still very helpful and friendly! \n\nWe chose the high tea package option and we were able to pick different teas during our brunch. Nobody got too creative and I think we only ordered the white tea in addition to what was already on the table (this was good though!) but Gina also brought us out a pumpkin tea. \n\nFinger sandwiches were decent but nothing too extraordinary but I think you are mostly paying for the ambiance anyway. The scones were really good though! At the end of our brunch we found the hat rack and decided to snap some photos. I think it's a cute tough to have these out for everyone to borrow and feel a little tea-ready! Overall, cute place and I would be back if I had another event to attend!", "author": "Emily C."}

I do and I remember wanting to live a Barbies life. \n\nWell here, you can live the dream. I was overwhelmed with disbelief when a friend posted her tea party celebration on Snapchat. I never knew there was such a thing for common people to do. I've only heard of queen and princesses having tea parties. \n\nI made sure to make reservations because from the yelp reviews, some were saying that it will get busy. And they were right. People are waiting outside before the place even opened. When I walked in is was like walking into a Barbie dream house. Lol It had a homie feel to it, i was seated on a nice comfortable fluffy chair with a sign that said royalty. So you known it was time to take pictures.\n\nThey have all kinds of different teas and sandwiches it was hard to decide! My friend and I decided to go with the queens tea for two and boy did it not disappoint. It looked like a meal fit for a queen.  We had so much fun at this adult tea party I couldn't even believe how much fun it actually was to do childhood things again. \n\nIt was a great experience.

You will absolutely walk away feeling stuffed and satisfied!\n\nThey have plenty of tea services aside from the Queen's service, so if you're looking for a more inexpensive tea service, Lovejoy's has a myriad of options. And if none of those options catch your eye, you can customize your own service or even order from their a la carte menu. \n\nTheir tea menu is expansive as well and ranges across black teas, herbal teas, decaffeinated, fruit teas, etc, so again, you're bound to find something you'll love.\n\nWhat impresses me the most about Lovejoy's tea service is how much choice you have in deciding your food items. High tea is one of my favorite indulgences, but it can be very restrictive in that the menu of what is served is pre-fixe unless you let the restaurant know ahead of time about your food allergies/restrictions. With Lovejoy's you can choose which tea sandwiches you want with your tea service, and they have plenty of meat, seafood, and vegetarian options. You can also choose which petit fours you want from a tray that they bring around to you that includes mini cakes, marzipans, chocolates, etc. I like that as a person with allergies and a food restriction (I am a pescatarian), I don't have to inform Lovejoy's ahead of time of these restrictions because their tea menu caters to everyone and all potential restrictions. \n\nI also love the decor of this tea room. Lovejoy's Tea Room is decorated just like a cute quintessential English tea room, with lovely pastel colors throughout, fine teapots and cups, floral wallpaper, lace curtains and tablecloths, and embroidered pillows and couches where there weren't chairs. \n\nLovejoy's is truly a special tea room in Noe Valley, and it's a tea room I will definitely be coming back to again and again!", "author": "Pooja M."}

You have to pick what service you would like and the sandwiches. The service allows you to choose up to 2 sandwiches, which doesn't offer much variety. I recommend coming with a group of 4, so that you can share and get a little bit of everything. If you don't want to do a \"set service\" you can order items a la carte. The food wasn't standout amazing, but a nice experience. I was never asked if I wanted to try another tea, but just had it refilled.

This one has been on my list for quite some time, especially because I've seen it in several magazines and travel shows.\n\nI, too, recommend going to Lovejoy's Tea Room for high tea.  They definitely have their aesthetic down.  The atmosphere is very English grandma.  There's cute knick knacks everywhere, and they even have hats available for you to wear while you dine!\n\nWhat I like about their menu is that you can choose your sandwiches.  I don't eat beef, and there have been some times where I can't substitute items without changing my entire order.  I got the turkey with dijon mustard and artichoke hummus for my Queen's tea.  They were both very good.  The Queen's tea also came with a salad and coleslaw.  I wasn't a fan of the salad because it has arugula.  I'm not an fan of it, but it did go well with the coleslaw, which had the right amount of dressing.  I'm glad there was salad, though, because I needed some greens with this meal.\n\nLike most high teas, the Queen's tea came with scones, crumpets, lemon curd, fruit preserves/jam, and Devon cream.  I really liked that it also came with fresh fruit.  You also get a tea biscuit and your choice of a petit four at the end.\n\nSome of the other places I've gone to were heavy on the desserts.  Lovejoy's isn't, which is fantastic.  I usually feel like I'm going into diabetic shock, but I felt that dining hear was well balanced.\n\nAnd as for the tea, I got blood orange, and it was delicious.  I didn't need any sugar at all.  \n\nService was fantastic.  I felt welcomed and well taken care of.\n\nI suggest making reservations as this place is very popular.

I have been here numerous times, including with a large group, and the service has always been impeccable. I think they are a solid tea room in a not bad location. \n\nIn terms of food and value, I would still say Dartealing Lounge and sip tea room have better food and are a better value (more food for less price.)

It wasn't quite as magical as my first time here, but this is still one of the most authentic and best tea rooms in the Bay Area. My friend made reservations for our group a couple months in advance, and reservations are highly recommended! Make sure your group is on time, since they only give you 2-2.5 hours for your seating. It was completely packed at 11am on a Sunday. \n\nWe all ordered the Queen's Tea (Choice of Two Sandwiches, Served w/Cabbage Salad, Caraway Cream Dressing, Organic Spring Greens, Scone w/Preserves & Devon Cream, Crumpet w/Meyer Lemon Curd, Fresh Fruit, Petit Four, Tea Biscuit, $29.95, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wzNGMt87QuKAu7vzCjTXQw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg). We tried the following sandwiches and teas:\n\n-Roast Beef & Horseradish: There wasn't much roast beef in this, and the horseradish wasn't very strong.\n-Egg & Onion: Yum- great version of egg salad, but very onion-y.\n-Chicken-Apple-Walnut Salad: Just ok for me, but I don't like nuts in chicken salad.\n-Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese: Solid smoked salmon & cream cheese:\n\n-Tea Room Blend: Solid black tea, and easy to drink.\n-Chestnut Tea: I loved the chestnut aroma, but this tea was STRONG. You definitely needed to add a good amount of milk to dilute it.\n\nYou can order unlimited teas, but the tables are small, and we didn't have room for a lot of teas. I wish I had tried: Apricot, Pomegranate Green, Genmai Cha, Jasmine, and White Peach.\n\nThe scone was my favorite part of the tea- it was buttery and flaky, and super delicious smothered in Devonshire double cream and lemon curd. The crumpet was just ok for me since it's meant to be more dry/chewy. I chose the peanut butter petit four, and that was really good. Although the tea service isn't cheap at $29.99, we actually had a ton of leftovers, and you're also paying for the experience. This is a great place to go with a group of girlfriends and have a British high tea experience! I heard that their Redwood City location is actually more spacious than SF, so will definitely have to check that out next time since that's closer to home.

You can also order things a la carte, or a plate.

We chose the White Peach and Forest Berry tea. Both were really good, though I preferred the sweeter Forest Berry tea.\n\nWe came on a Wednesday at 11 am and there was already a large crowd. Luckily we made reservations in advance. I highly recommend making reservations.\n\nThe staff was very nice.

My friends and I (a party of 8) reserved a table for Sunday @1pm. Table could probably seat 9-10 people.  The room itself has cute decor all around and multiple other tables for customers. The teacups, plates, and teapots are super cute as well and they made me feel so fancy. They have a good selection of teas, sandwiches, desserts, and other food you can order. The food that was part of the Queens Tea set may have looked small but it was surprisingly filling. Even the restroom was cute too!\n\nThe scone was the first item to eat. That was the best scone I've had in my life. I thought it was absolutely delicious. Of the sandwiches we got, I recommend the egg and onion one if you don't know what to pick. That was the tastiest one and was the favorite one by far between the 8 of us. We also had the salmon, bay shrimp, apple, and chicken apple walnut sandwiches but they weren't that extraordinary; just all tasted like cream cheese/mayo/creamy dairy product. Salmon would be number 2 pick. If you're wondering what the chocolate truffle tea tastes like, save yourself the hassle and don't even get it. It was definitely our least favorite tea out of the ones we got. I liked the vanilla tea more than i expected so that was a lovely surprise.\n\nLastly, a few more things: It was very loud in there so it was hard to hear each other in the room. Try to go on a less busy day if you can for a more relaxing atmosphere. We also has a 2 hour time limit so we couldn't just sit there and chat too long. That's unfortunate as we would have loved to stay longer.\n\nIf you love places like this and want to go to an even nicer one, there's one in Pasadena that's lovely.

I made reservations two weeks or so in advance for afternoon tea for 6 people on Saturday at 1:30 pm. There was still quite a bit of availability.\n\nI'm glad that they have a much easier to use reservation system in place now through Resy; I had looked into coming here before but was always put off by having to fill out a form on their website.\n\nWe were quickly seated at a large table that could have accommodated up to 8 easily. Good to know for the future that they can accept larger groups.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was the decor - everything was absolutely adorable! There were so many small thoughtful touches we loved. For example, on a shelf next to our table, we saw a Mrs. Potts and Chip tea pot and cup. I can tell there was a lot of thought that went into the decorations to create a quaint look for afternoon tea.\n\nOur server told us it was easier for them if we all ordered the same set, so we all opted for the High Tea set ($22.95), which comes with your choice of two sandwiches, salad, a scone, a tea biscuit, and your choice of tea. For my two sandwiches, I went with the smoked salmon and chicken salad with pesto, which was one of their daily specials.\n\nInstead of us each getting our food individually on a small tower, they actually placed all of our sandwiches together in one tower, which I was little disappointed about initially as I had wanted a picture with just my food. But the tower was really cute so it was hard to stay upset :) The smoked salmon sandwich was good, but I was really blown away by the chicken salad sandwich...it tasted super fresh and I could not get enough.\n\nFor my tea, I went with the mango, which both smelled and tasted delicious! I kind of wish I had gotten the decaf version afterwards though, as I was jittery for the rest of the day as my body tried to process all the caffeine.\n\nThe scone was also delicious. It came with a spread of cream and jam, and even though I knew the scone was already very rich (I've seen how much butter goes into scone recipes before...), the cream and especially the jam were totally worth the extra calories! \n\nI was worried that the high tea set wouldn't be enough food, as I was pretty hungry after skipping breakfast, but I was stuffed by the end and even had trouble finishing the last couple bites of the scone. \n\nSo why the -1 star for service? Our server (forgot her name) just didn't seem to be in a good mood or something, as her attitude towards us was curt and almost mean at times. I didn't realize there was a 2 hour limit, so by the time 3:30 rolled around, she told us we needed to leave in a not-so-polite way. My friends and I were all kind of put off by her attitude, but luckily we didn't need deal with her too much so it didn't detract too much from what was otherwise a great experience.\n\nRandom note: one of my friends was vegetarian and I was pleasantly surprised by how many vegetarian sandwich options were on the menu.

After having my first official afternoon tea in London during our honeymoon, I was dying for another opportunity to enjoy such an experience. My husband is the greatest and made reservations at this spot. What a sport - he was the only guy in the joint and didn't complain, just let me enjoy my tea. \n\nI had the Me Tea - a bottomless pot (although I could only handle one pot) of brown rice and popcorn green tea, a scone with butter and jam, and a tomato and cheddar sandwich. The presentation was adorable although a bit more rustic than our fancy London experience. I love the character of all mismatched serve ware but was a little bummed about the cleanliness (a stained ring around the rim of my husband's tea cup prior to pouring tea, sediment buildup at the bottom of my tea pot) but it is fine. We are talking about tea in San Francisco, not a high end spot in London. My tea was delicious and the scone was probably one of the best I've had. \n\nMidway through, I started to get a mild allergic reaction (light swelling of my lips but nothing crazy). I have a nut allergy and didn't think to mention it before ordering since what I ordered should have been nut free - totally my fault and not at all theirs - but when I asked if anything had nuts, the server quickly responded \"no\" and carried on. I popped a benedryl and continued on enjoying my tea. It would have been nice to know so that I can let you guys know and be aware for myself next time that maybe the butter had ground walnuts (sounds crazy but I've experienced this elsewhere before), or the scones were made with almond flour, but got no such explanation. If you have an allergy, I would be sure to ask first and clearly state so if you have a severe allergy but also be prepared just in case. \n\nThe worst part, the thing that warrants a 3-star review, was the service in my opinion. It felt VERY rushed even though they weren't busy. We had reservations and were immediately seated - awesome. We ordered shortly thereafter and our food arrived within a few minutes - okay great. But then, as I was finishing my food and sipping my tea, the check arrived. I didn't even have time to order another pot if I wanted to, it just felt so rushed. We still sat there for another 10 minutes after paying because I wanted to finish the pot I was currently on (afterall, at $10 a pot, you should be able to enjoy more than a cup or two). I think we were there for a total of 40 minutes. That combined with the nonchalance of the allergy mention above made me a little bummed about the customer service.\n\nNonetheless it is a cute place and I'd hope you'd have a better experience than we did. I'd say we'd give it another shot, but there are other tea places that I will likely want to try instead to get an experience worthy of the price tag that comes with an afternoon tea.", "author": "Ashley F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-10-03", "description": "Sub-par cream tea, I'm afraid. \n\nConsidering how cute the place looks, and how busy, and how good the reviews are, I was expecting something wonderful and invited an out-of-town guest for an afternoon tea. We walked in on a weekday afternoon and were immediately seated. It wasn't busy at all. As everyone says it's quite another matter on weekends. The service was perfectly fine. The food and the tea were sub-par.\n\nI feel I must explain what Cream Tea is before I review what I was served.  A cream tea doesn't mean tea which is creamy. A cream tea is a scone served with clotted cream, optionally (though usually) also jam, and a pot of tea. It is a kind of set piece. Clotted cream is a kind of delicious creamy thing about halfway between the most delicate butter you've ever had and whipped cream. It is, not too put too fine a point on it, the very heart of cream tea. You want a generous amount of it. I know all this from having had a great deal of cream tea in England in a variety of tea places. \n\nI ordered cream tea, which came with two scones, about a scant tablespoon of clotted cream, a little bit of jam, and some fresh fruit. A tablespoon of clotted cream is not enough for one scone, never mind for two. There should have been at least three times that much clotted cream. I am not exaggerating or being facetious. You want to be able to spread a thick amount of clotted cream and then have enough left to lick out of the container like a barbarian, if you can get away with it. I understand that they are importing clotted cream in tiny jars from the UK at great expense, but considering how much the whole cream tea costs, I think they could afford to be more generous with the stuff. It's also possible to make your own clotted cream from scratch, and the only problem is you have to make rather a lot of it at once which shouldn't be such an issue for a shop that specializes in tea. \n\nInexplicably, the scones were heated up. I realize it says that on the menu and perhaps I ought not to have been surprised. But I was surprised because scones should not be warmed up. They should be fresh, but not warm and certainly not re-warmed. Rewarming scones is just not done. I don't know how else to put that. It's incorrect. Aside from it being not done, it's also a bad idea because it will melt your delicious clotted cream and ruin its texture and coolness. It also can't be good for the texture of the scones. \n\nThese were raisin scones, which in my experience are sometimes a bit more solid rather than crumbly, and maybe if they had not been re-heated they would have been on the far end of the acceptable range of scone textures. They were not the right texture. They utterly lacked any crumbliness. Sure, if you're used to Starbucks scones, you might be impressed. But if you are expecting an English style scone, these are not that. They are incorrect.\n\nThe jam was fine, though still a little bit less than I would really expect.\n\nTo summarize, there was not enough clotted cream and the scones were wrong.\n\nNow let us move on to the tea. I ordered the house blend black tea, and it was a very good full-bodied tea. Milk was provided, as it should be. It was loose-leaf and came in a teapot. You had to strain it with a little strainer when pouring because the leaves are put directly in the teapot. Which is OK and I can't say it's not correct, lots of English people do it that way.\n\nThe tea was good for the first cup. Because there was no way to take out the tea leaves, it inevitably became over-brewed for subsequent cups. When I got very close to the bottom of the teapot, the waitress came by to \"warm up\" the pot to make good on the promise of bottomless tea. I can't be 100% sure about what happened next. Based on the flavor of the tea it seems like the old tea leaves were not replaced and either more hot water was added or more hot water with some more leaves. Anyway it was bitter and not very good a that point. The whole tea part of the experience could be improved by putting the looseleaf tea in a brewing basket (which is not heretical in any way and lots of English tea houses do it, and it's not like authenticity appears to be a concern at this teahouse). \n\nEverything that went wrong could be fixed with a little bit of effort and care. That's part of why I'm writing this review.

When my party arrived, we decided to order the Queens tea, because, well why not? \n\nThere was a great selection of teams ranging from greens to blacks to whites and herbals. It was hard to actually make a decision (which is always the probltem I like to have). I ended up with the chamomile and my friend got the white strawberry.  Both teas were delicious, and now I can't wait to go back and try others with the different food options.\n\nSpeaking of, this place has a wide selection of everything and caters to various health restrictions.

Nothing particularly special about the food or even the tea, but Lovejoy's has that cozy afternoon tea vibe and is a good spot for catching up with a friend or gathering for a birthday. It's definitely more about the company and experience than the actual food or tea.\n\nThat being said, it's kind of an expensive experience, with the cheapest tea services being about $20 and the full tea service (Queen's Tea) being $30. It's easy to make a similar experience at home for much less, but obviously without the quirky decorations around.\n\nI ordered the HEALTHY TEA ($20), which was a large platter consisting of salad, carrots and cucumber, fruit, walnuts, crackers, cream cheese and an option of smoked salmon or artichoke hummus. Perfect if you want something lighter or if you're not into the usual scones, crumpets and sandwiches.\n\nFor my tea, I got the Black Vanilla with Lavender, which was recommended by our waitress. Couldn't really taste the lavender but it had a subtle sweetness reminiscent of vanilla. They're very good about refilling your tea pot so it's really bottomless.\n\nNote that they do have a 2 hour limit on the tables!

I went here twice, once with my boyfriend and once for my sister's bridal shower. Both time I really enjoyed myself and left with great pictures for the IG. \n\nLogistics:\nMaking a reservation is a must! This place is crazy popular that a walk in will be difficult. I would recommend calling instead of using the reservation system they have on their site. I was able to book a reservation through the phone when the site showed no open table for the time and date I wanted. Granted they will never pick up so leaving a voicemail is the way to go as they always call you back to confirm. \n\nService:\nThe service here treats you like a queen (or king)! They are so nice and accommodating with last minute changes and even seat you even if everyone from your party have not arrived. I know some busy places don't allow seating until everyone has arrived which may lead to some resentment towards your chronically tardy friends lol. \n\nFood:\nHigh Tea - I always opt for this one since it's more than enough to fill me up. You get a choice of two sandwiches and bottomless tea. \n\nTea - I recommend the white peach tea as the teapot comes with its own strainer. Also it taste great! \n\nSandwich - It is roast beef/horseradish + turkey/mustard all the way for me. I just like the combo of those two. I will ventured with the daily special as well since they have sandwiches not listed on the menu. \n\nQueen's Tea - This one is definitely a 2 person option. It's like the high tea except you get fruits and a dainty dessert at the end.  \n\nBlueberry scone - Everyone raves about this scone and it's definitely the highlight! Definitely try it with the jam (but it's already really good by itself). \n\nOverall: \nI would definitely come back if I want to feel a little classy and drink tea with my pinky up.

Server only topped off our tea hot water one time during 1 hr 45 mins. Server did not check in with us after initial serving. \n\nRushed: Then, we are not done eating at 1 hr in, and the server comes by with desert tray. I wanted to say that we weren't quite ready for it, that we felt rushed, but instead we said no thank you. Shortly after that the check appeared on our table.\n\nOne of the two new owners stopped by, saying \"I hear there's been a problem.\" I explain the situation to her. No recognition at all that something has changed in their service or that there's something amiss. \n\nShe then tells me that we are supposed to flag down the server if we want more hot water for our tea. Since when? Like many of you I have been to tea rooms in many places, in many places, including England. And nowhere does the customer have to flag the server down for hot water. It is their job to come by and do a refill.\n\nThe Correct attitude of the new owner would be to say, yes I understand that we haven't done enough, our service has not been up to standards. The fact is, since the new ownership, the service has actually been fine. Why it was different this time I don't know. I have been here before Christmas with the new owners, so it can't be that. It's the attitude that I don't appreciate. After years of enjoying this place under the former owners tutelage, this new situation is sad.\n\nFood: They seem to have gotten the food right now with Sandwiches, scones, and salads. They seem to have ironed out the kinks in the food since they took over from the original owner. I'm sad to say that the service is driving me and others away from this business.\n\nEarlier--\nSeptember 2016: \nScones much improved. Perhaps it's an entirely different purveyor that they are acquiring them from? Service good as always. \nThe main problem: the scented products in the bathroom. The first of our party to go in there came back and warned us. I went and asked someone about it for going in. Finally I had to talk to the owner and she removed the products. Honestly, it's a tiny space and I have a medical issue. But even my friend-- she couldn't breathe, her head aching afterwards. I could see having the usual scented soap in there has a lingering effect, but please consider people who can't abide by scented products let alone blasting it in a small space. \n\nAugust 2016:\nNew owners have taken charge. No more Muna! Please give them feedback so that they can maintain this wonderful business. \nAlong with the two scones which were undercooked, we received the usual raspberry jam, watery whipping cream which did not barely fill the thimble size container, and no lemon curd. They have added a few sandwiches to the menu, which is fine. I would not make any more changes at the moment, and instead concentrate on maintaining quality.

I got to try the artichoke hummus, bay shrimp, chicken/asparagus, and pear/stilton sandwiches, and while all of them were good, they were definitely on the small side and didn't have much filling.

Both are good options but I definitely prefer High Tea and will probably get that from now on. The reason I prefer High Tea over Queen's Tea is that Queen's Tea is $7 more and only gives you a crumpet, some fruit, and a Petit Four. Personally I don't really enjoy crumpets or Petit Fours so that basically means $7 for a bit of fruit. However, if you love crumpets and Petit Fours, go for it! I can finish the whole High or Queen's Tea myself so it makes me full but doesn't keep me full for more than an hour or two. However, the experience is really fun and cute for special occasions. If you're looking for a light fruity tea, one of my personal favorites is White Peach.\n\nThe environment itself is very old fashioned and cute with pretty, mismatched dishes. Everyone is friendly there too. However, both times I came with a party of 3 and got stuck at the table with the \"shared\" bench, meaning you share a bench with someone from another table. The time I sat on that bench, I felt every time the girl sitting on the other side moved or rocked it (because of course it's not level).

Not an issue as they have our tables ready and promptly seated me while I wait for the rest of my party.  The decor was on point and the mismatched tea sets were adorable!  We ordered two sets Queen's tea which had fruits, salad, scones, sandwiches, and crumpets.  The scones were scrumptious (especially with lemon curd) and the tea sandwiches were divine (my fave was the egg and onions and the apple and cream cheese)!  We tried the peppermint tea, and the peach green tea- both very good and refreshing.  Definitely a good place to hang out when you are in Noe Valley.", "author": "Notsky P."}

It comes with fresh fruit two sandwiches, salad, coleslaw, scones, crumpets tea cookies and petite fours and of course a bottomless pot of your choice of tea. The Queens tea was about ~$29 per person. You can't go wrong with the tea, and their scones are so good and buttery and are warm when you get them. We got the smoked salmon/cream cheese, chicken walnut apple and pear and Stilton sandwiches. The smoked salmon was delicious, pear was ok and I would skip the chicken walnut apple next time. Their fruit was sweet and the coleslaw lacked flavor and the salad was just the greens, mandarin oranges with balsamic vinaigrette. The crumpets come half way through and we're nice and hot. The petite fours were sweet and a nice touch to the end. Over all I would come again but maybe just get the tea, scones, a crumpet and maybe even one sandwich.", "author": "Michelle P."}

I wanted to call them to make reservations.  No answer.  Just an automated voice mail.  I tried leaving a voice message, and right before I made it to Lovejoy's, no response.  As I arrived at Lovejoy's Tea Room, the sign said it's closed; however, I did see people inside enjoying their tea service.  As I opened the door, a middle aged waitress in eyeglasses asked me what I'm doing here.  I responded saying I called to make reservations.  Then she told me that I should go to Lovejoy's Attic to make reservations before heading inside the tea room.  Oh dear!  Guess I should have done that.  Maybe next time.  Anyway, she did find a table for me, which is used for any majestic couples.\n\nWhile seated and be given a menu to look at, I wanted to order something many Britons enjoy for generations.  I chose the Decaf version of the Earl Grey and the \"Me\" Tea Service.  As I look around its atmosphere, nothing smells.  Patrons in their separate tables are enjoying themselves, talking and laughing while finishing most of their meals.  It comes to show that Lovejoy's have gotten better before I come here.  Still, something has never changed.  On my right side, some portraits in black and white seemed aged.  Feels like I'm inside the very old tea room during the Victorian era.  But the songs in the background are somewhat American oldies.  (Sigh) Guess nothing's perfect.\n\nWith the Decaf Earl Grey in the bottomless teapot and a small pitcher of milk on my table, it wouldn't take long for a \"Me\" Tea Service to be served as well.  A milk tea kinda guy like me never forgets to pour his tea in a teacup in a fancy way before pouring little bit of milk and two spoonfuls of sugar.  Taste evenly sweet with familiar hints of Italian Bergamot oil.  Next was my \"Me\" Tea.  Four right triangular tea sandwiches made with hummus spread, simply delicious.  A Devon cream with a lemon slice and a kiwi slice is super sweet.  I used it plus a whatchamacallit berry jam to smear on a scone.  Pieces of organic arugula are edible, even the Moroccan mint leaf.  My waitress was so kind to give me a refill of the Earl Grey.\n\nIn at least 45 minutes, I finished the whole tea service.  Everything is good from start to finish.  I like how the servers in Lovejoy's are doing good business, and I humbly thanked them for keeping up their good work.  Smiles!", "author": "Jimmy C."}

The first and last time I came was nearly 15 years ago for a birthday party; at the time, I was ten and loved the experience.  I kept eyeing this place for years and finally my best friend and I decided to catch up and we were able to book a table at Lovejoy's for the same week --a Wednesday at 3pm.  We went yesterday and loved every minute.  \n\nUpon first arriving it was such a charming view to see all the tables and chairs set up with their cups, saucers, and small plates.  The mismatched china is fun to look at and compare.  The tables had a lace tablecloth and honestly, I felt like I would be joined by Jane Austen any minute.  The set up is wonderful!\n\nThe host and server was very friendly and gave us her recommendations to order our tea service.  We ordered one High Tea service to share; this included the choice of two tea sandwiches, small salad, cabbage slaw, and two scones with clotted cream and berry preserves. For the sandwiches we went for the sweet and savory: the pear and stilton & the special of the day fig tapenade with goat cheese.  Both were delicious! For our bottomless pot o' tea --the \"champagne of teas\" was elected: Afternoon Darjeeling.  This really was bottomless as a server would check it periodically and warm it (put more hot water in) to assure that we didn't run out in the middle of our tea service.  The presentation of the tea service was on a two-tiered stand --which gave a nice 360 view of your items to pick and choose as you ate.  \n**some tables are a bit smaller and may get a bit crowded as items come  out from the kitchen, so maneuver carefully --definitely wouldn't want to break anything!** \n\nMy friend and I enjoyed the whole experience and even looking around at the decor is fun! There is so many unique and fun items hanging around.  \n\nAlthough they tea room was not very busy when we went, I'd definitely recommend making a reservation to secure a table especially for the weekends because there is usually a crowd gathered outside waiting whenever I drive by.  \n\nMy friend and I agreed to return again and soon!  We'd love to visit around the holidays as well.  There is something truly special about sipping tea here --I definitely recommend.", "author": "Vanessa G."}

The service is outstanding, and the scones were really buttery and flaky. Took me a bit to figure out the sandwiches on the platter for high tea, but all in all it was a huge spread that left us full for the afternoon. Chicken salad was a favorite, but I thought it was just okay. The pear and Gorgonzola and the tea (apricot and chestnut) were excellent.

My work organized a tea lunch in celebration of International Women's Day.  Even at 11:30am on a Friday the place had a good amount of patrons.  Keep in mind it's small though so make reservations! \n\nThis time around since I'm pregnant, my sandwich selections were very limited.  So I went with the cucumber and cream cheese, and a hummus and artichoke sandwich.  I went with a delicious light white strawberry tea.  We noticed how each tea cup set and pot were different.  Some of us got retro almost 50's like plain tea pots (me) and some got traditional Victorian looking ones.  I think I would've liked the consistency.  Lovejoy's provides an affordable tea lunch menu with different options with different price points, no wine here though.  \n\nOur tea lunch option included a pot of tea, two sandwich choices (which turns into eight sandwich triangles total), shared salad and a scone.  I think they should've let each person choose more than just two sandwich options since you get bored of the flavors.  Though it's appreciated that they let their customers choose especially since some have dietary restrictions.  I didn't eat any of the salad.  My sandwiches could've used seasoning.  Cucumber and cream cheese was pretty standard, some mint to add more flavor would've been lovely.  At first I couldn't tell where my hummus sandwich was since it almost looked like some's tuna sandwich.  It was fine, but again, lacked any seasoning.  The scone had some small raisins in it and was moist.  I honestly think that was the favorite thing I ate there.  We all also got a small cookie to finish off our meal.  I thought the salad option was weird.  I would've appreciated fruit as I've always seen, especially since it's easier to divide portions of that with a group and just more sanitary (i.e. People mixing tongs).  \n\nService was good and I loved my tea and scone but that's about it.  The Sheraton Palace and Rotunda will be my benchmarks for awhile.  However, I've been to Secret Garden in Sunset before and I thought the menu was more impressive, but then again, back then I didn't have any dietary restrictions.", "author": "Cat C."}

I live a few blocks from here and after begging A for MONTHS to go on a tea date with me, he finally gave in and we were able to make a reservation. I will say that I think we may have gotten in earlier had we been able to walk in but Lovejoy's is too popular. I think the reservation process is a bit opaque, however, since you have to request a reservation without knowing which times are available. I wish they were on OpenTable or Resy or at least had a more detailed calendar but I guess there is some charm in having to go through a bit of effort.\n\nAnyways, we requested any available time but noted that we preferred earlier in the day on Saturday rather than later. To our luck, we got a reservation at 11AM right when they opened. When we got there, the place was already pretty full and there was a wedding shower going on at one of the long communal tables. Lovejoy's is SUPER cute on the inside and they have all of these adorable hats you can wear during your tea party. A was not about that AT ALL and felt a bit self-conscious in the admittedly feminine space.\n\nAnyways, we had a difficult time ordering because we didn't want to over-order. We settled on getting one Queen's Tea ($28) and split the bottomless tea pot (+$2) since we both wanted a black tea and it didn't make sense to spend an additional $10 when we would have ordered something similar if not the same thing. We also split the Tea Sandwich Plate ($12.95). The 4 tea sandwich choices we chose between the Queen's Tea and the Plate were the Roast Beef & Horseradish, Chicken-Apple-Walnut Salad, Smoked Salmon and Cream Cheese and the Pear and Stilton. We liked them all with the exception of the Pear and Stilton which had a weird taste. Both sandwich plates also came with a mixed green salad and cabbage slaw both of which were okay if not standard. The Queen's Tea also came with a scone, a crumpet and a petit four. The scones at Lovejoy's are AMAZING. It was served warm and was flaky but not dry. We devoured the one that came with our tea so we ordered another one for $2.95 and did not regret it at all. The crumpet was satisfying and the petit four was cute and the perfect end to our meal. Was it cheap? No. Did A leave hungry? Maybe. But even in the end, he was a convert to the joys of high tea and wants to go experience it at one of the fancy hotels in the city!

I'm still giving this place 4 stars because it's usually all very good. Here's what happened.\n\nMy fiance and I came here once and ordered our usual high tea - which among other things includes 2 sandwiches and 1 pot of tea each. The waitress takes our order and returns some time later with one pot of tea. I was surprised. We always get 2. I asked her nicely if we could get another pot of tea. She was not happy with this, and said something along the lines of \"well, since it's the same tea and the table is small you only really need one pot.\" I guess that makes sense, I can see the logic there. I told her that I understand and I was sorry to ask again I really would like for us to both have our own pots, we have always had our own pots because that's what we're paying for. Plus, we like the tea really strong. 2 people sharing a tea pot would dilute it immediately. This waitress gets really snappy with us and straight up tells me, she's not bringing us our own pots, sorry, it's the same tea, the table is small, etc. At this point I'm indignant. What do you mean? We are paying for 2 pots. You're not only withholding a pot, but you're actually arguing with me that the size of the table is the reason (if we ordered 2 different teas we would have gotten 2 different pots!!) At this point I'm annoyed. I basically have to beg this woman into adding some fresh tea leaves at least. She grudgingly agrees and walks away, leaving us confused and grumpy. To put it short, our tea was watered down, I did not taste any added strength to our tea, and I walked away feeling like this human put up an unreasonable fight. I believe she's a red head. Anyway, I haven't seen her since (if she's still there, please address this because it was rude).\n\nAnother side experience happened about a week ago. I asked an elderly waitress if the salad dressing was vegan. She told me she didn't know. That's alright. I asked if she could check for me. She said they used some french dressing, the can was in french, she'd have no way of knowing. I literally had to ask her multiple times - is there a label? Can you please check for me otherwise I'm not able to eat it. She said she didn't know and just walked away. As a restaurant providing a service, your job is to be familiar with ingredients. She came back some time later and showed me the can (in english) with the ingredients. I'm grateful she did that - I'm just upset I had to wrestle her for it. A simple \"i'm not sure - let me check for you!\" would have sufficed.\n\nAll this aside, this place is delicious, it's cute, and generally a wonderful experience.

Once done, go online to their website and fill out the form.  Then i get an email to confirm date and time with Lovejoy.  Then gave them my credit card to reserve this time and date.  I was told as long as i call to cancel my credit card won't be used.  Closer to the date i got a reminder text and a reminder call.  This reflects how much they want us to show up..  Unfortunately, only one could not come.  I wasn't charged and they were super nice about it.  We got the queen's tea and healthy tea.  $2.00 tea charge for each person.  We got the caffeine free berry tea and ceylon decaf.  This was a 4 pm reservation so we watched our caffeine intake.  Ordered a side of sausage puff which was delicious. Love the lemon curd, almond paste petit four, homemade scone and crumpets, loved the ambiance, the bone china,  and the tea strainer.  Extra scone is 2.95.  Crumpet was spongy and warm.  Devonshire cream was yummy.  Tiny cup of coleslaw.", "author": "Helen L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-04", "description": "OK, I'm going to split this into a two-pronged attack!\n\n1) TEA WHORES\n\nIf you are a true tea connoisseur and lover and you have at least 5 loose-leaf teas at home in proper temperature controlled and vacuum-sealed containers that did not come to you as a gift in a gift basket, you are a true tea lover. Being a generic tea lover, however, is separate from being a Western-tradition high tea lover, in that, there's East and West. Dimsum-style East, high tea-style West. If you have participated and explored the tea rituals of the west frequently -- you will not see this as five-star place, but you will enjoy it. \n\n2) GENERAL PUBLIC\n\nIt is quaint, it is charming like all the reviews say. The teas are good. Not amazing, but good. The service is ... good enough. It's San Francisco, the place isn't huge. The prices ... are as expected. The ambiance is your dotty grandma's house, stuffed to the gills with tea paraphernalia and family photos, doilies and crochet-work cuddling up the dusty old lampshades. The bathroom is clean and spacious (a rarity in the city). It is filled with many groups of women at various stages of life, from celebrating engagements to graduations to gossiping to catch up. The petit fours are freshly made and moist (I was surprised and impressed by this). The scones are freshly made, as they should be. They do provide proper clotted / Devonshire cream, and luxurious preserves to smear on your scone. They have a good-sized savoury menu aside from tea service.\n\nIf you're not a tea whore and don't really take your high tea very seriously, and you rarely do this sort of thing, you'll be satisfied with the environment and you will have fun, and one tea service will generally make you stuffed and happy.\n\nIf you ARE a tea whore, you will notice some thangs. They aren't major, but cost the fifth star:\n\n- Service: This place has been around a while and is extremely busy and popular, and it's in the city, so I get the \"French maitre'd\" vibe that has happened. Let's just say that the vibe I expect when I go to High Tea is generally about ensuring you are calm, comfortable, looked after, and delighted. We had touch points with multiple staff members and only one staff member was happy and pleasant toward us; the rest treated us like they were busy lor annoyed and that worrying about how busy they were was more important than worrying about the experience for the customers they had. They basically expect that making the food, putting the tea in front of you, the decor, and checking on you once suffices. It does not. I highly recommend that if it's possible all the staff members attend a proper tea (I have yet to find one in SF actually, even at highly rated hotels) and once they have their mind blown they'll get it. It's hard to explain. It's about the experience, the ritual, and being catered to, tea time is sacred in England. Originally, it went on for hours. If you are really trying to recreate that experience, you're not there yet. If you're making your own Cali version ... it's good enough.\n\n- Pricing: A quality tea service doesn't charge you extra for a \"bottomless pot of tea.\" It's included in the price of the service. Also it's SF, so I wasn't surprised by how much you pay for what you get, but it's a little on the stingy side (I was letting it go for the foodstuffs but I got offended that you're paying extra for the tea, since that's the whole point of being there).\n\n- Food: For 3 people, they don't give you particularly generous portions of clotted cream or preserves. We are all trying to watch our weight so we didn't ask for more and made do. Salad is generous. The caraway seed (I think that's the spice) is FAR too overused in their coleslaw salad and I'd frankly they not include that salad and expend that on a free petit four for everybody by default. Quiche looked good; we didn't get to try the crumpets. Scones were good. Sandwiches were on the small side so if you order a tea service with 2 included per person I recommend you order one more for the table to share. Cream cheese is nothing special / has nothing in it (no herbs or seasoning) but the salmon tasted fresh. Basically the sandwiches are super simple and more like tea at home that auntie made versus tea at a fine tea house. Tomato and cheese is straight up tomato and cheese - you could make it at home.\n\n- Tea: As mentioned, good, not amazing. If they spent money on real high quality tea they'd be broke of course, or prices would have to go up significantly. They have a pretty broad selection. I just went with the House Blend, which was okay. Friends ordered other types and were pleased with theirs. The staff made note of how long we should steep the tea, which was great to see.\n\nIf you ever want to have a tea experience that blows your mind -- Brown Hotel in London. DO IT.", "author": "Miriam W."}

The food was great, though I believe the waitress hates her job.  She almost never smiled, and the couple of times she did, it was like she was remembering that she was supposed to, so it was a grimace that lasted a quick second.  \n\nThe food, as I said, was great, but here is where they messed up.  Two of us ordered the Queen's Tea, while everyone else got the cream tea.  The two Queen's teas were put on one double layered tray, which might not have been a problem, but we were not sitting at the same end of the table.  So I never got any greens, or lemon curd, or what not.  One of the other ladies gave me her cream tea platter and helped me grab my tea sandwiches from the main tray, but that table was way too cluttered with the different pots and such to make passing that multi level tray back and forth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-19", "description": "A great place in a tony San Francisco neighborhood to act as if you are a citizen of Great Britain, thanks to the many options they have here, as you can enjoy a spot of tea as well as the traditional British-inspired dining options that accompanies them, Lovejoy's Tea is great place to kick back and hang out with friends or have a calming moment to one's self. \n\nA friend had been dying to enjoy a traditional tea room in San Francisco and I had sent him a list complied by the website SF.eater.com of the best places to enjoy afternoon or high tea in the city and Lovejoy's was one of their top picks for their unique yet homey ambience with a wide variety of traditional English teas and sandwiches. After doing some reading some reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I knew that Lovejoy's would be the perfect place to enjoy a pot of tea in the city for the very first time. My friend got a reservation for Thursday afternoon at 4pm, which turns out we didn't even need it as it wasn't packed at all at this time of day.\n\nThere are a lot of great options at Lovejoy's for tea and sandwich lovers alike. Since we were newcomers to all of this, we asked our server what she would recommend for two tea lovers who also wanted to try a lot of traditional British goodies and who also wanted to just sit back and take it all in. She suggested we get the High Tea which consisted for our choice of two tea sandwiches served with organic spring greens, cabbage salad in a caraway cream dressing, a warm scone served with preserves and Devon cream and a tea biscuit to boot. At $21.95 for all of that, we felt that that was a very affordable deal. Since she knew we were going to stay a while she suggested we get one more sandwich (at an additional $3.95) to go with this combination to satisfy our taste buds. We agreed and although all of the sandwich options looked plenty good but we knew we had to get the traditional sandwich that pairs perfectly with English tea, cucumber and cream cheese, in addition to the roast beef and horseradish and ham and English mustard options.\n\nServed on a two tiered cake stand, with the scone on top and the sandwiches and salads on the larger bottom tier, everything tasted amazing. I loved the scone especially when spread with the Devon cream and preserves. The sandwiches were so tasty, I especially loved the traditional cucumber sandwich made with real English cucumbers. The horseradish gave the roast beef a real kick, so be wary when biting into them. The sandwiches and salads paired very well with our tea, which was also selected with our server's advice, when we asked what went well with milk, we went with the Yorkshire Gold Black Tea which was a high quality blend of teas from Africa, Assam and Ceylon, it was a bold and brisk, full bodied tea with a smooth and even flavor. My only issue since Lovejoy's prides itself on using a wide array of porcelain serving ware, my cup was way too large for a traditional tea steeper and promptly kept falling into the cup! Oh well I guess the tea leaves just made my drink stronger and therefore only taste better!\n\nWe were so enthralled by the food we wanted to try a couple more items after we feasted on our high tea meal. So we went with a chicken apple walnut sandwich and since our day was not all about cold mini sandwiches a my friend really wanted to sample some of Lovejoy's pub fare, so we went with the sausage rolls which were puff pastries with a sausage filling. The rolls were decent tasting, nothing truly spectacular here, as once again the sandwich was a highlight when sampled with tea. And what a wonderful tea it was, perfect with milk and sugar, they kept our tea pot filled with plenty of water as we drank all afternoon long. Just be forewarned they charge two extra dollars to split a pot.\n\nI really love Lovejoy's with its interior filled with British inspired kitsch and wide variety of traditional teas and sandwiches. When the place isn't packed with customers, it is the perfect place to sit down and relax and contemplate life in a comfortable environment. You can check your cell phone from time to time, but this is a place to enjoy the tranquil beauty of stillness or actually converse with your drinking mate so to speak, so what people tend to do in a traditional coffee shop is a no-no, as well it should be. In the end, our bill literally came out to twenty dollars for each of us which when you come to think of how much food we ate and how much tea we drank is a pretty good deal. I think it actually cost me more to take public transportation to get to the Noe Valley location of Lovejoy's and I can't think of anything more quintessential San Francisco than that!", "author": "Jason F."}

I met my parents at Lovejoy's feminine little tea room, one of the few open for tea mid-week. The place was full and the staff was hopping!\n\nMom and I both ordered high tea. We each got to choose two sandwiches, sliced into 4 triangles each. Lots of filling options to pick from, they came between a slice of white and brown bread, crusts removed. I went with smoked salmon and cream cheese (YUM!) and Branston pickle chutney with cheddar (nice cheddar, but a bit skimpy on the chutney). Mom let me try a piece of her hummus and arugula, which was good, though not as good as the salmon. I didn't try her ham and mustard, but said the mustard was nice and spicy. Dad seemed happy with his roast beef and chicken sandwiches- again, not a sharer. :-(\n\nThe sandwiches were arranged around a mixed green salad, fresh and kicked up by the mandarin oranges and a sweet/tangy dressing. The two tiered tray also had a bowl of cabbage salad- a slaw really- with a creamy caraway seed dressing that was also good. \n\nMy fave of the bunch was the currant filled scone which I slathered with devon cream and a bit of raspberry preserves. The tea biscuit was just ok to my taste buds.\n\nWe each got a pot of tea. I ordered the chestnut which had a lovely maple aroma, but was a bit weak for my liking, even after steeping quite a while. Glad she didn't add any extra hot water to my pot. I tend to drink a lot of water and the staff was too busy to keep my glass filled.

My first impression was that it was visually too busy for me with all Victorian decorations everywhere but was happy to see that as heavily decorated as it is, the place seemed very clean.  For me it was definitely more about spending time and enjoying a nice conversation with my friend than the food.  We had the Queen's Tea which is $30 dollars. We added  a sandwich which is essentially two slices of bread with trimmed edges, $10 dollars. As you can see on the picture, it includes fruit, two small sandwiches, some greens and a bottomless pot of tea.  The sandwiches are tasty but small for the price I thought.

I've always happened to luck out, but I can see how parking could be a headache around the area. Make sure you check out their store across the street! They have their teas for purchase, as well as other cutesy items for you to host your own tea party at home. Your bill comes with a small discount should you wish to purchase from their store across the street.

It was also disappointing that each person was not asked what tea she wanted. I have been to Lovejoy's in the past for other showers and was always offered my own pot of tea. We were provided a couple of starter pots and those were refilled, but we were never offered our own pot or choice of tea which was part of the tea package my host paid for.

My cousin and the rest of the attendees were there on time, so they were able to enjoy. The hosts, however, were kind and allowed us to stay at least an hour (probably more) past closing. I really appreciated that, thank you Lovejoy staff! They were friendly and very attentive, and patient is definitely an understatement.\n\nThe ambiance was a mix of London tea meets a southern belle's Sunday brunch. There was a red London phone booth, hats available to change your style, and decorative tea sets. The music selection was great as well, they played the Dream Girls soundtrack to Tina Turner (I had many breakout singing moments). There were seating opportunities for couples and large groups like ours.\n\nThe tea party spread was a delight. The tea variety consisted of lavender, vanilla, green, and passion fruit. Scones and finger sandwiches were served with the teas. The scones were delicious, soft, fluffy and warm. There were horseradich, tuna, and cucumber sandwiches. That may not sound like much, but let me tell you it will fill you up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-02-12", "description": "For a 4.5-star rated tea room, I expected WAY more from Lovejoy's Tea Room.\n\nOrdered High Tea for 2 and for sandwich selections, we ordered cucumber & cream cheese, chicken apple walnut salad, smoked salmon & cream cheese, and chicken & asparagus.  I must say, I was very disappointed in the sandwiches.  The only sandwich I thought was decent was the smoked salmon & cream cheese while the others were far below average.  There's something wrong when you feel like you can make better sandwiches at home than the ones served here. \n\nThe cabbage salad (i.e. cole slaw) wasn't good at all and the cumin seeds didn't help the taste one bit and the organic green springs was nothing to write home about either.  I agree with the masses that the scone was probably the best part of the meal.\n\nI've been to a tea room where they give you a thick pamphlet of teas to choose from so I was certainly not impressed with the selection here.  My biggest gripe with this tea room is that they put all the tea leaves INSIDE the tea pot and make you filter your own tea each time you pour yourself a cup.  This makes the tea really really dark and bitter towards the end, unless you can somehow drink mass amounts of tea in a short period of time.  I would have preferred that they put the tea leaves in a filter on top so that we have the option to choose how dark we want our teas.\n\nAlso, what happened to this excellent service that everyone was gushing about here?  There was certainly no 'pampering' here.  As a matter of fact, some would even consider the waitresses to be aloof and nonchalant but I didn't particularly mind despite expecting more.  Overall, I thought the experience was disappointing and overpriced, and I doubt I'll ever make a second visit.", "author": "Mango T."}

Definitely recommend, especially for tea time newbies. \n\n~~details of my experience~~\n\nOrder (for 2):\n\nPloughmans Lunch ($16.95) - cheese platter with salad, fruits, hummus, toast and chips. Very tasty and pretty filling. Nice as a sharing platter. \n\nSavory tea ($14.95) - 2 sandwhich options w/ choice of tea. Had the smoked salmon with cream cheese, which was a bit much for me. Also got smoked turkey with Dijon mustard, which I loved.\n\n\"Me\" tea ($15.95) - basically the option to mix and match what you want w choice of tea. I choose to get a scone and crumpet served wit lemon curd, sweet butter and raspberry jam. All very tasty. \n\nFruit salad ($8.95) - very nicely put together although did not come with as much fruits as expected. A bit pricey for the amount of fruits served.\n\nTea choices:\n\nDarjeeling - A good complement with the food. Not a too heavy tea. Quite enjoyed it.\n\nTea House Blend - A nice blend w a slight bitter aftertaste. Not one of my favorites but adding milk and sugar still made it pretty tasty. Slightly heavier tea flavor. \n\nService: \n\nFantastic service. Servers were warm and attentive. Food arrival was fast. Tea pot was constantly refilled without having to ask. \n\nAtmosphere:\n\nCute, old-timey and comfy. If you are looking for classy and luxurious, I suggest the Laurel Court afternoon tea at the fairmont in SF, but if you are like me, this lovely quirky little tea house is perfect.\n\nOverall: \n\nOne of best afternoon tea experiences.

I didn't see it offered on their Yelp menu, but on their menu at the table, it was listed. It's an awesome deal and can certainly be split between two people, along with add-ons (extra scones or petit fours) without it being too pricey. (I looked at the High Tea option. If we had chosen that, and then had extras, it would have costed more than the Queen's Tea with extra). Scones, fruits, salads, crumpet, YUM!\n\nFor tea, we got China Rose Petal. It's as delicious and beautiful as it sounds. The staff and waiters were so friendly and courteous, and were very kind to help me and my friend get photos of us even though they were closing up at 6:00 (my friend and I had a 4:30 reservation).\n\nI really recommend everyone who has appreciation for tea and Victorian aesthetics/culture to visit this place.

The guy who brought out our tiered platter was also nice to offer to take photos of our group, taking several and offering tips like having my friend tilt her hat a certain way so her face would show up better. \n\nMUST-HAVES: If you're getting a Tea Service and like strong cheese, definitely get the The Pear & Stilton when you're choosing your Tea Sandwiches. For the Petit Fours, choose the rose water. \n\nOur platter: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lovejoys-tea-room-san-francisco?select=MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg#MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg\n\nTEAS: \nViolet - My fave. A light sweetness that still mixed well with the herbal flavors of a tea.\nVanilla Rooibos - more sweet, but leaves a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.\nWhite Peach - fruity and light.\n\nTEA SANDWICHES\nBest: Pear & Stilton by far! The intense blue cheese paired incredibly well with the sweet pear.\n\nEverything else was quote bland and \"safe\":\nMediocre: Daily Special (roast beef & mustard), Chicken Apple Walnut Salad (though \nToo plain for me: Cucumber & Cream Cheese, Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese, Salmon Mousse\n\n* Organic Spring Greens, Cabbage Salad in a Caraway Cream Dressing - 3 stars\nPretty simple, the only accent flavor being little mandarin orange slices, and there wasn't quite enough of that. The dressing seemed like a balsamic vinaigrette and the sharpness of that complemented the greens and the orange pretty well. I did wish the salad was colder; it seemed room temp, even warm later on.\n\n* Fresh Fruit - 3 stars\nPretty, but not much beyond that. The winter melon was not ripe and a bit hard. Strawberries, blackberries, and kiwi were nice. \n\n* Petit Four - 4 stars\nfull platter: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lovejoys-tea-room-san-francisco?select=MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg#JSpHOzIStSs32UFby1oYIw\ncross-section of our choices: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lovejoys-tea-room-san-francisco?select=MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg#k3_KeW_0tv5f41UvRFRtJw\nWe got a dark chocolate/lemon, as well as a rosewater. The chocolate one wasn't great, the jelly-like lemon filling not as sharp as I'd hoped. The rose-water soaked bread-like filling of the other one was great, and we all liked that one much more.\n\n* Tea Biscuit - 3 stars\nNot much here, like those generic hard, buttery Italian cookies. \n\n* Crumpet with Lemon Curd - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lovejoys-tea-room-san-francisco?select=MOK7eDDrfqmsqCOH7VIVTg#Fj33P7RuOhTOwxyb5OtVJQ\nLIke an English Muffin, but a little more dense, not so airy/fluffy. The outside is a little more crisped as well. Great with combinations of the lemon curd, butter, and blackberry preserves!\n\n* Warm Scone with Preserves & Devon Cream - 3.5 stars\nNot quite warm. Tasty but a little bit on the dry side.

Never be short staffed.  Never fill the whole restaurant at once and only have 2 servers.  Never offer less than what the previous owners had all the regulars used to, like your choice of a tea with every high tea! Today, upon getting seated we were \"graced\" with a black tea and a vanilla roiboos, but who ordered or picked those two?  How pretentious of them to force their choice of tea on a patron!  Then,  the crumpet for the queen was served as an afterthought.  The sandwiches overall, were great.  The chicken walnut salad sandwich tasted funny, like tuna fish and a tad sour.  The cucumbers were not fresh.  Only one of the persons at the table was offered a petit four! The rest of us were left speechless.  We know they are extra and not included with a high tea but we always used to get tempted at the end of the meal!\n\nTo add insult to injury, I ordered a chicken and asparagus tea sandwich to go and when my son opened the box to eat it at home it was turkey with mustard!  no asparagus! what????? So for that measly insult of a sandwich and two scones and a miniscule scoop of watery double devon cream I paid the exorbitant amount of $13+.  Oh I miss the ladies that for decades really knew what they were doing with this place.  It takes one person to bring it to ruin.  Sigh!  \n\nGo to Lovey's in Pacifica, perhaps you will get lucky with the servers there.", "author": "Emilia G."}

I found street parking in 5 minutes, about a block away, which isn't bad for SF.  The food was delicious.  I had the high tea set with the Daily Special (Coronation Chicken, I think) and Cream Cheese Cucumber sandwiches.  The decor is very cute, with the pink, tea sets and all.  \n\nI took 2 points off for the following: \n- My tea (genmai cha) was lacking in flavor, so I felt like I was dranking hot water the whole time even though I let it seep as instructed.  I probably should've stuck with non-Asian tea at non-Asian restaurants.  \n- We felt rushed by the waitress.  She came by multiple times within the first 15 minutes of seating even though we told her we were waiting for one more friend to arrive before placing any orders.  She did not appear happy about letting us wait...After placing our orders, we didn't see her again until \"dessert\" time and she placed the check on our table shortly after we declined the desserts she offered.  About 5-10 minutes later, she reappeared to \"remind\" us that we have 5 more minutes left in our seating.  So, my friends and I quickly paid and left.  \n\nI would recommend management to train the staff to let the customers know that there is a 2 hour seating limit when they're placing the orders, so the customers are aware of it.  And, perhaps, also train the staff to be more discreet and polite when reminding customers of the time limit.", "author": "Icy H."}

I also just had a tea party of my own a few months back and it was a delight. I was so eager in fact that I insisted we go to tea before we even handled the errands that brought us to SF for the day. \nThe tea room itself is adorable. I love how none of the cups, saucers and pots match. The eclectic decor gives it a really authentic feel and even the bathroom is done up. The antique furniture is great too. We were surprised that there were a lot of kids inside the business and it was actually rather loud and noisy. \nThe staff was nice enough, but not genuinely warm. \nWe each had a pot of tea. I chose the Vanilla black tea and my fiance had the black currant. I don't know why he chose that and it tasted bad (as I expected it would) with a bad aftertaste as well. Can't blame them for that. We just kept drinking out of my pot lol. \nWe got 4 sandwiches with our high tea for two. I had the special which was a fig and goat cheese and I also ordered the pickle chutney. My date had the hummus and artichoke as well as turkey with dijon mustard. When the sandwiches came out they were TINY which is too be expected at a tea. But still, these were exceptionally tiny so we resigned ourselves to eat a real meal somewhere else later. Unfortunately, the sandwiches were inedible. The flavors were overpowering in the worst way and they smelled and tasted rancid. Honestly, there were all terrible with no consideration for anyone's pallet. I was very disappointed. \nThe warm scones were good and the raspberry preserves were delicious. I could eat that on it's own. The \"salad\" and slaw on the bottom of the tray were minimal and flavorless and the dressing was no help. \nThe real reason we came was for the petite fours! I have loved them since I was a child and could not wait to have my fiance taste one :) I was overjoyed when they brought out the desserts; both for the petite fours and because we were both starving! Although they are small and were $2.50 each, we got 3 just to sample. I heard the server advise that they were Marzipan, but after biting into the first one, I almost spit it out. My fiance bit into his at the same time and the look on our faces spoke volumes. It was terrible! I tried to eat them but they literally made me feel sick. We had to put napkins over them so we could get our check. I felt so bad. Last night I had to order some real petite fours online to try and \"un-traumatize\" my fiance and let him know they aren't really disgusting. \nSad to say, but this place is just a novelty and I should not be rated as highly as it is. I would give our experience 1.5 stars.", "author": "Dale S."}

There were four of us on a Sunday and couldn't initially accommodate our party size, however, called me back and gave us a table that was meant for three. \n\nWe ordered two queen's tea services, and it was for sure not enough for two girls and two guys.

You won't be able to get in otherwise. There are set entry times as well. I think the max stay for each party is 2 hours. You will need to put down a card for the reservation as well.\n\nLocation: right next to the muni stop on Church, J line goes through here.\n\nTea set: you order tea, each person can get his/her own tea, and then depending on the price range, either 1-2 tea sandwiches, salad, crumpets, scones, cookies, etc. All the sandwiches are decent, but I won't say extremely outstanding. After all, I don't think an afternoon tea is about how extreme their sandwiches are :) You're really just there for the nice atmosphere, pleasant decor, warm and nice food, and chit chat. \n\nFor those with kids: strollers will not fit inside. No room for highchair. OK to bring infants that can be held/wrapped and are relatively quiet. Not suitable for small children who can't sit still.\n\nExperience: We went with a party of 6 on Sunday 1:15PM with reservation a month in advance. Promptly seated. We all ordered \"high tea\" which comes with two tea sandwiches, salad, crumpet, scone, cookie. Don't be fooled by the tiny sandwiches. You WILL BE FULL by the end of the 2 hour meal! Service is good and there's really not much to complain! \n\nCompare to other tea places in SF:\n\nDartealing is a little better in terms of tea uniqueness & sandwich quality, but overall these two are my favorites. Fairmont hotel afternoon tea is more expensive, has more fancy decor, but the sweets are actually worse. The Rotunda downtown is more noisy, fancier looking, more expensive, and also less refined. Samouvar is not really the same type of place, so no comparison.  I have not been to Crumpet.\n\nSo really, Dartealing and LoveJoy are my top 2 recommended afternoon tea in SF.

But it has all worked out. The nice lady hostess fits us in for a 90 mins tea service and all is well. \nSince this is my first time at Lovejoy's, we choose to go with the Queen's Tea with all the lovely tea sammies, crumpets, scones with clotted cream and lemon curds to go with the Royal Blend black tea. The ambiance at Lovejoy's is just lovely and inviting-it's no surprise that reservations are hard to come by so I feel quite lucky to have this tea service as soon as I walk in today. \n\nAs for the tea, the Royal Blend is pleasantly smooth, with a hint of orange and vanilla-but I may want to try other tea options on our next visit. There is quite a selection on their tea, tea sammies, and the petit fours. For our tea service this afternoon, we opt for the bay shrimp and mayonnaise, and turkey and dijon mustard-what dainty little tasty sandwiches these are... The scone, lemon curd, clotted cream and the raspberry jam were also nice and adequate. \n\nOverall, for a tea service, I would grade Lovejoy's Ambiance and friendly and attentive service to be 5 stars, taste of food at 3.5.

I made a reservation for 2 at 2pm on a Thursday afternoon and my best friend and I arrived 15 minutes before our reservation. We were seated right away, but I was a bit disappointed that we were sitting so close to the party next to us because we could hear every single detail of their conversation. We were going to ask if we could move, but the place was packed and we didn't want to seem like snobs!\n\nAs per the suggestion of the server, we ordered the High Tea for one and added an extra scone and 2 extra sandwiches with the Yorkshire Gold Tea. The sandwiches we chose were Smoked Turkey and Dijon Mustard, Bay Shrimp and Mayo, Chicken and Asparagus, and Lovejoy's Daily Special, which was probably a ham with some sort of mustard. My BFF and I looked at each other thinking \"this is just an appetizer\" because the portions were very tiny. Yes, I do understand that tea is supposed to be light, but seriously, the portions were way to small! The Yorkshire Gold Tea was fantastic and definitely enough to share between 2 people. Also, the scones were some of the best I've had!\n\nAs we were eating and chatting about life, I noticed that I felt a tad bit hot halfway through. Thinking it was the tea and lack of ventilation on our side, I ignored it and started to feel this way throughout the remaining portion of our tea time. We paid, left, and my stomach started making odd noises. I ignored it until an hour passed and my BFF and I ran to the shiny porcelain throne and girl, let me tell you, it definitely felt like we were reenacting the scene from White Chicks when Brittany or Tiffany Wilson was holding on for her life when she had the quiche. Definitely NOT  a pretty look!

It was my first time experiencing high tea, and I didn't expect anything great; I mean, it's just tea and some overpriced biscuits. How great can it be, right?\n\nWell, I found out that it's pretty darn great! First off, everything was adorable, from the mismatched plates and saucers to the homey, antiquey decorations around the tea room. It reminds me of Alice in Wonderland, just a bit! The service is also wonderful. She always came around to keep our tea pots full and to make sure we were doing okay. \n\nThe menu is extensive - you're definitely not limited in food, as there's salad, fruit, crumpets, scones, sandwiches, and other pastries. I ordered the Queen's tea with a pomegranate black tea and shared it with my cousin. It's seriously a lot of food! My favorites were the buttery, delicate scones, crumpets, and the smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwiches. They were heavenly when paired with the tea. I prefer plain unsweetened tea, but they do provide sugar and milk for you to add as you prefer it. Also, when you choose your petits fours at the end of your tea ritual, I would suggest avoiding the salted caramel truffle unless you like your truffle EXTREMELY salty. Everything else seemed fine, though.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back when I'm in SF.

I came here near the holidays and I couldn't get a reservation 2 weeks in advance, but they do allow walk-ins. If you're a walk-in like me, you will have a set amount of time there. The time limit for my friend & I was about 2 hours. Sadly, it did feel like we had to rush the end of our afternoon tea because the 2 hour was ending. If you're in a hurry to go somewhere, I suggest you to give yourself a 3 hour time frame to relax. \n\nMy friend and I got the Queen's Tea ($28 pp). This comes with your choice of two sandwiches, served with cabbage salad in a caraway cream dressing, organic spring greens, a scone with preserves and Devon cream, a crumpet with Meyer Lemon Curd, fresh fruit, a petit four and a tea biscuit. \n\nThe Petit four will be served at the end and you get  your choice of ONE dessert; if you pick two, there will be an additional $2.50 charge on your bill (my mistake). Their petit fours were adorable as it had a Christmas theme to it :) I think my favorite of the two sandwiches - smoked salmon & cream cheese and one of their daily specials, was probably the smoked salmon & cream cheese - you can never go wrong with that! It was delish, though I can't describe in detail, since it's been awhile since I last went.\n\nI'd love to come back again, when I can find a lady-friend to come with! Miss you Carmen, and our fun tea adventures! Come back from LA soon! :(", "author": "Mandy G."}

Even though my fondest memories were in England, drinking tea is a global phenomenon that many people from all the different parts of the world partake in. When I was in college, I studied abroad in England and one thing I miss most is the amazing tasting teas & the tearooms! Pinkies up! \n\nOf course, tearooms are more widespread in the land of the monarchy, but it's nice to know one of them is a 10-minute drive from my place in SF. Parking is very easy to find even on the weekends. We were able to find street parking a block away. Beware of street signs if you park in the afternoon on weekdays. The tea room is only open Wednesdays to Sundays until 6PM. Last feeding (their words not mine) is at 4:30PM. I would highly recommend making a reservation, especially on the weekends just so you secure yourself a spot in this quaint and cozy little tearoom. You can reserve up to 2 hours in advanced if you're not quite sure of your schedule until the day of. They usually don't pick up, so make sure you leave a message & they'll return your call right away. \n\nWhen we arrived we were seated at this cute little table by the window and on the table, there was a sign that said \"reserved for royalty\". I know at one point I wanted to marry Prince William, but that hardly makes me royal. Regardless, that made me feel very special. The tearoom is small, probably fitting only about 7-10 tables tops. But I think this creates a very intimate experience. Our waitress was very attentive and I felt like she was able to get us everything we needed, which was probably because the space accommodated a handful of people (a plus!). Our waitress was also very knowledgeable about the teas and didn't mind waiting until we perused through the extensive menu that included over 20 different teas! \n\nWe ended up ordering the high tea and \"me\" tea with black vanilla lavender tea and darjeeling tea-- both of my new favorites. What I loved about the tea was that it was loose leaf, which is definitely the healthier type of tea (tea bags contain added chemicals that aren't good for you). With the tea, we were able to order sandwiches and a side pastry. I ordered the darjeeling with the chicken and asparagus & salmon and cream cheese sandwiches. My brother ordered his vanilla lavender tea with the daily special sandwich-- which was cranberry and turkey (reminded me of Thanksgiving). Along with my sandwiches came a delicious scone with a side of strawberry jam and butter; while my brother chose a crumpet, his personal favorite, with a side of lemon spread. The sandwiches also came with a salad and vinaigrette. I think the food was excellent and it paired very well with the tea. \n\nThe tea is a bit pricey (bill was $40 for 2), but I think it was worth it given the wonderful experience that my brother and I had. I definitely want to come back another time with family and friends. It was such a lovely and nostalgic experience.", "author": "Brittany D."}

I've never been this excited about something British related since the Spice Girls. Yeah, I'm bringing it waaay back. \n\nI experienced my first afternoon tea sesh at Lovejoy's Tea Room with my two besties on a gloomy Sunday. We were ooh-ing and ahh-ing over their adorable and vintage tea sets, the cozy yet regal decor, and the impeccable sweet and savory finger foods.\n\nMy friends and I each ordered the Queen's Tea Set which includes two sandwiches served with cabbage salad (coleslaw), organic spring greens, mixed fruits, one scone, a crumpet, a Petit Four (small dessert), and a tea biscuit. Essentially, it is a buffet with petite foods. How cute! And let's not forget the bottomless tea pots (it is called afternoon TEA). I decided on the White Peach which paired well with the food because it was not overwhelmingly strong. A light and sweet drink to accompany our little delights.\n\nNow for the tea sandwiches! My friends and I divided and conquered. We sampled six different tiny crustless sandwiches (* denotes favorite):\n- Cucumber & Cream Cheese\n- Chicken-Apple-Walnut Salad*\n- Salmon Mousse\n- Bay Shrimp & Mayonnaise \n- Chicken & Asparagus*\n- Lovejoy's Daily Special* \n\nI can't remember what was in their special but there was chicken involved, and it was simply delicious. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwich choices. All of their daintily cut sandwiches are packed with massive flavors. We also loved the blueberry scones, which were soft and light. Spread some of their tantalizing strawberry jam and you are in sweet pastry heaven. The crumpet was the only thing that we weren't crazy about. It's a waffle-cake hybrid: part waffle in texture but tastes like pancake. It was also very fluffy and hard to cut. We were presented with an assortment of Petit Fours after our meal. I had some type of mocha confectionery--a dense brownie coated with mocha. Mmmm, diabetes!\n\nLoyejoy's is the perfect spot for an afternoon with friends, a romantic date, or a classy bridal shower. We were smitten with the perfectly mismatched china and eclectic setting. This place is essentially an antique shop that serves tea. I'm pretty sure if my grandmas were British, they would be sitting in a place like Lovejoy's sipping on some tea and petting their furry kitties.\n\nQuick tips:\n- Make reservations because seating is limited and due to its popularity, Lovejoy's accommodates very few walk-ins. \n- There is a two hour maximum seating time and they will kindly inform you that your time is up and you need to bounce (not in those exact words).\n- Use the restroom before you leave! Trust me, with all of that tea you're gulping down, you don't want to risk it. \n\nPinkies up!", "author": "Judy H."}

They brought our crumpets out fresh out of the oven. The scone was simply delicious. At the end, we were able to choose from a platter of Petit Fours. I choose the strawberry cheesecake, which was rich and delightful. For tea I choose the Decaf Lady Grey: apricot with Earl Grey that was full flavored with great apricot flavor. I tried a cup of my friend's Chocolate Truffle tea and that was delicious also: very smooth and good chocolate flavors, perfect with sugar and milk.\n\nLovejoy's was a great experience.

It's crowded for a reason. The food is great and the kitschy-ness makes it so fun to have tea here.\n\nOur server was very friendly and always made sure our teapots were full. The service flowed seamlessly.\n\nThe gluten free scone was warm and soft. It had a nice flavor and the lemon curd, preserves and clotted cream complimented it well. \n\nThe gluten free bread was seriously THE BEST gluten free bread I have ever eaten. In fact, I'm not even sure if it was gluten free (okay, I am...the bread was brown in color and still had the crusts on; my dining partner had wheat flour based bread and the crusts were removed). But seriously, THE BEST gluten free bread I have ever eaten. I had the cucumber cream cheese and one of their daily specials...I think it was a turkey and chutney. I'd skip the turkey and chutney concoction and head for the salmon mousse to go along with cucumber cream cheese next time. \n\nThe cabbage salad with caraway is a favorite of mine. I've always enjoyed it. I've tried to replicate it at home...but I can never make it the same. \n\nI always enjoy the delicate green salad with the vinaigrette. \n\nThe fruit was fresh.\n\nThe tea biscuit was tasty. \n\nThe crumpet...well...the crumpet was actually an english muffin from Kinnikinnick. A good try, but no match to a real crumpet. I didn't finish my gluten free version...and I almost always finish everything on my plate...so that's saying something. Not bad, but not really worth eating toward the end of my tea service. \n\nInstead of a petit four, I received a gluten free cake pop...and to my delight it was lemon. I love all things lemon, so this was perfect. It was moist and lovely. It was actually the first cake pop I ever had. They weren't popular back in the days when I was eating gluten and now that they've made their way into many markets, I hadn't had a chance to try one until I had the Queen's Tea at Lovejoy's. \n\nIn short, a lovely tea experience. I am already making plans to head back. \n\nCall at least 4-6 weeks in advance to get the weekend seating of your choice. They're often booked many weekends in a row and if you're hoping to get a last minute reservation, you might just be out of luck. \n\nI highly recommend Lovejoy's Tea Room. They're my favorite tea room in the Bay Area...even before I was gluten free...and now that they have such a wonderful gluten free tea service I am beyond a fan. \n\nGO!

WEEEEEEEEEE\n\nI have been meaning to come to this place for the longest time after I saw pictures on Facebook from my friends. I am so glad we came here. We made reservations beforehand and had a lovely seat by the window. I had the High Tea that included scones, salad, coleslaw, and sandwiches. \n\nScones: YUM! I am usually not a huge fan of scones since they are often too dry and flaky. However, this was absolutely delicious. Do not forget to use their raspberry jam and devon cream on the raisin scones as well! As I write this review, I am still thinking back to that first bite of my raisin scone...so delish.\n\nSandwiches: We had the Salmon Mousse as well as the Lovejoy's Special, which was a Chicken with Arugula, coupled with curry sauce. The Salmon Mousse was great, but nothing special or out of the blue. The chicken sandwich was very special as you usually wouldn't come across curry as a spread on sandwiches. \n\nTea: Black Vanilla with Lavender. I decided to try something more relaxing since it's a date and I wanted something relaxing. I couldn't really taste the lavender but maybe because my taste buds were masked by the amazing raspberry jam. The servers kept making sure that we had enough tea and poured hot water to ensure warm tea. \n\nWe ended up staying for 1.5 hours because it was such a cute place! I remembered that a fellow Yelper described this place as \"your crazy aunt's place where none of the cutlery or plates matched\". This is incredibly true. Yet, this \"crazy aunt\" must also be such a lovely and homely aunt because of all the picture frames on the wall and cozy little cushions. The table beside us (a group of retirees) even dressed up for tea, with little hats and bows to match their dresses!\n\nI will definitely come here again if i am by the area.\n\nOne more thing - while the menu states that each person must spend $10.95 minimum, my bf and I only ordered a high tea for $19.95 and were not asked to follow this \"minimum,\" which was great because we were so full by the end of our meal.", "author": "Jinyen Y."}

The decor made me feel like I was in some English lady's closet/house. \n\nMost of us ordered the High Tea (~$20) which comes with your choice of 2 sandwiches, 1 scone, cabbage salad, mixed green salad, and a cookie biscuit. The sandwiches are pretty standard, but the scone was so good, and I usually don't like scones at all! It's served warm with jam and clotted cream, and not dry at all, but flaky and buttery. I ordered green tea, and the tea itself was very light in flavor, I prefer mine a bit stronger, but it didn't really deter from the overall afternoon tea experience. I've only had one other afternoon tea experience in the city at Neiman's, and Lovejoy's is definitely a more laid-back (and economical) affair. \n\nReservations are in 2-hour blocks which can be a bit of a downer if you're having good conversation with friends.

At the end we were asked to choose 2 Petit four, which is basically a dessert. It's very small, but packed with sweetness. I wanted to eat all of them since they looked so pretty, but sadly only two had the pleasure of my taste buds.\n\nOverall, great experience, but pricey!

Food and tea selections were blah.... atmosphere was old and dusty. BATH ROOM WAS SCARY. FOR SURE. Was really surprised that the prefix tea menu didn't include tea.... and they charged you extra just to share a pot.. I was confused. And refills were not free which they usually are. I also noticed this place was so over priced for what we got. At other tea rooms like English rose in Pleasanton and Tudor rose in Santa Rosa, you definitely get more food and it comes with tea so it's worth it. But here, what we got was so sparse.

I came here with a group of ladies today and received the special treatment of royalty.\n\nWe all ordered the queen's tea which consisted:\n\n2 sandwiches of your choice, cole-slaw, greens, assortment of fruits, currant scones, crumpets, a petite four, a small white and brown cookie, your choice of a pot of tea and 3 spreads: lemon curd, raspberry-blackberry(?) jam and this amazing white clotted cream which tasted like a sweet butter.\n\n I decided on the salmon + cream cheese sandwich, as well as the bay shrimp + mayo. Both were delicious! The fruits had a wonderful selection, all the spreads were delightful, even the salad dressing was yummy. But what really stood out here was the freshly baked currant scones, OMG. These were amazing! Hands down the best scones I've ever had.  They were soft, flakey, buttery, moist and full of flavor. I wish they sold them in bags to go! I also decided on the strawberry tea which was a nice and refreshing taste. I really liked my friends China rose petal black tea though.

I picked the Genmai Cha which I had taken a whiff of across the street at Lovejoy's Attic. It is a green tea with popcorn and rice in it. Yes, POPCORN and RICE. It sounds strange but it is now one of my new favorite teas. The popcorn and rice add a subtle nutty flavor. I also enjoyed a cup of both the apricot tea and a rose petal tea that two of my tea companions ordered. \n\nMy mom and I ordered four different sandwich options to share. We got the smoked salmon and cream cheese, pear and stilton, chicken and asparagus and the special which was a turkey salad sandwich with cranberries and pecans. I like that both their High Tea and the Queen's Tea come with mixed greens with balsamic and coleslaw. Their coleslaw is light with the perfect amount of mayo and the surprising addition of caraway seeds. The fresh fruit included honeydew, orange and grapefruit slices, kiwi, strawberries and blackberries. \n\nEven though I was full after consuming the fruit, salad, coleslaw, sandwiches, and mass amounts of tea, I managed to make room for my scone (with currants) and crumpet. Both were delicious with the devonshire cream and lemon curd. I took my shortbread biscuit and petit four to go. They bring out the petit fours near the end of the tea service for each person to pick one. I chose a little hazelnut and chocolate cake which made for a delightful snack later that day. \n\nAs if the wonderful tea and foods weren't enough, service was wonderful and the quirky mix-n-match furniture and table settings create the perfect ambiance for time spent with fabulous company.", "author": "Emily J."}

Let's just get over the fact that the decor is, well, a bit over the top, because the service and food are both excellent!\n\nWe ordered Queen's Tea for two: \n- Yorkshire Tea (amazing -- apparently quite difficult to find in the States, because I've been looking for this stuff ever since. Really, this is the only tea you'll ever need)\n- Apricot Tea (paled in comparison to the Yorkshire tea)\n\n- Chicken walnut salad sandwiches were delicious! Half white and half whole wheat bread, which is a nod to both tradition and current standards. Also had Branston Pickle Chutney and Cheese, which sounds strange, but is absolutely delicious! Would highly recommend those two sandwiches\n- The salad and coleslaw was okay -- they were skimpy on the mandarins, and the Caraway Cream Dressing was oddly bitter? Mayonaisse-y? Not my favorite part of the meal.\n\n- I learned, finally, how to eat scones properly. And have a proper scone. Which aren't the scones from Starbucks, or wherever you get them. These scones are large and studded with blueberries and are warm, not flaky, like you'd think a biscuit sort of thing should be, but are meant to be cut down the middle, like a bagel, and spread with Devon cream (which isn't normal butter -- it's thicker and whipped and DELICIOUS) and then preserves. Amazing! Absolutely delightful. I'll never have a Starbucks scone again. \n\n- Crumpets. Oh my god. I don't even know what to say about these. There aren't American corollaries, but think of a biscuit, but not flakey. In fact, holey. And warm. And delicious. And should be slathered with the butter and the lemon curd, while the crumpet is still warm. The butter will soak through the crumpet. And so will the lemon curd. It's worth upgrading from High Tea to Queen's Tea to try this sucker out. \n\n- Fruit was good, pretty fresh and ripe, well cut\n- The tea biscuit (which is just a lil tea cookie) was a bit disappointing\n- You get to choose a Petit Four from a platter of many, and they were quite delicious! \n\nDon't forget to make reservations, at least a week or two in advance! They fill up quite quickly, and it's worth the brunch out with a date or with friends.\n\nOverall, worth the experience and quite authentic, according to my friend.", "author": "Courtney N."}

It seemed like a lot of other bridal shower or similar event groups, and since the first \"seating\" all showed up at the same time, there was a bit of a traffic jam both at the beginning and end of our visit. We were crammed into pretty tight quarters, with very little room for our seats, as well as on the table -- we had to constantly move things around to find places to put everything, and it was almost impossible to do anything without elbowing people from my group on either side. They even had to basically rush us and kick us out at the end, which I suppose is necessary -- at least they were very nice about it. Still, would have been nice to have a bit more breathing room, both physically and temporally!", "author": "Shing H."}

Lovejoy's is really the spitting image of grandma's place, only blown up and with more tables.\n\nOur server was dressed to impress in an old school peasant dress and greeted us with a warm smile. The menus were just printed on paper, but whatever, we were sitting on floral couches and little chairs for chrissakes. Paper menus are perfect.\n\nWhat we ordered: high tea for two ($34), cream tea ($12.95), and savory tea ($13.95). Each order came with a pot of unlimited tea, which was amazing. The tea cups, pot, plates and whatnot were impossibly fitting; matching tea sets with some mismatched but homey utensils. A couple tea stains here and there, but there's no complaining from me! \n\nI had the Dragon Well tea (green tea), but I also tried their Yorkshire Gold (black), China Rose Petal (black flavored - it's sweet!) and Darjeeling (black). They basically give you your pots of hot water and the leaves, and instruct you briefly on what to do, aka steeping it for a minute. Oh, and of course there's milk and sugar on the table.\n\nOh gosh, such good tea! The China Rose Petal turned out to be my favorite of the day, and don't even get me started on the scones with lemon curd and devon cream.... An absolute must try.\n\nThe sandwiches were light, cute, and oh-so yummy. We decided to get the cucumber and cream cheese (I don't really recommend it... You can make it yourself, but it's cute...) and their daily special, some sort of curry-like sandwich - which blew my mind. I wish I knew what the name of it was now. \nIf you eat a lot, perhaps you should get your own order of sandwiches. \n\nThe store's right across the street, and I've already promptly bought a jar of their lemon curd. \n\nKeep in mind:\n It's $1 to share your tea.\nAnd calling in to reserve seats never hurt anyone.", "author": "Colleen M."}

I sampled the high tea set, which pretty much comes with everything.  I am not a huge fan of tea sandwiches, the ones here are good but nothing great.  I sampled both black and rooibos tea, both are delicious, although I prefer the rooibos.  Black tea just tasted like black tea?  The ornaments and decorations are cute and pretty.  I got to say it was a bit too cramped inside, I understand there's not a lot of space in SF, but I was expecting more white table clothes and white everything.  This tea room is really laid back and cozy.  \n\nMy favorite are the scones, these suckers are absolutely delicious!  Reminds me more of a buttery biscuit, but it has the perfect texture.  Slap on some of their famous marionberry jam and extra butter, you are in heaven!  The crumpets are also really good, crispy outside with a soft chewy inside.  If you order anything from Lovejoy's, get the Scone and Crumpet!  They constantly refill your tea, and you have about 2 hrs to chit chat..but really how much tea can your bladder hold?  For dessert you get to choose a marzipan chocolate, if you like marzipan you will lose these, otherwise it will be really sweet for you.\n\nYou definitely need to make reservations here, we got lucky and came 30min before they open.  We got lucky and got the only non-reserved table left.  There was a line even before they opened doors!  Scone and Crumpets are delicious, I highly recommend sampling them!", "author": "Terence N."}

It has been a tradition for my mother and I to come celebrate her birthday, Christmas, and now Mother's Day. \n\nEvery tea reservation I have made has been fairly easy and convenient. The staff calls you a couple of days to a week prior to your reservation to make sure that the date and time is correct and confirmed. That is a huge plus for me since I tend to have a very busy schedule. \n\nThe ambiance is very lovely with classic antique pieces such as clocks, paintings, and different tea sets to inspire the theme of the tea room. Some tables will have signs that state \"Reserved for the Queens\" or \"Reserved for Royalty\" \n\nMy mother and I usually get the Queen's Tea which include two types of finger sandwiches of your choice, two salads, fruit, and your choice of tea. But, my most favorite thing to get is the scones. I have never liked scones until I ate them here. I prefer to eat scones only here because of the quality in taste. Buttery and Most. They dont' fall apart or have that extra glaze icing that turns the scones too sweet. \n\nThe tea room has a store across the street where you can shop and purchase some of the food products that they make. \n\nPersonally, I will continue to keep coming here and bring some of my close friends and family to enjoy a wonderful and memorable experience at Lovejoy's Tea Room. \n\n**Please make sure to book reservations way in advanced.

This place is very quaint, original, old Victorian. 5 stars for making me feel like I'm in old England. Mix matched furniature, tea saucers, cups, and teapots, lace table cloths, victorian floral couches, vintage bookshelves, chairs, and vanities. This all adds to the unique style that is Lovejoy's. I would say more velvet would be nice, but that's just me... \n\nThe menu. 5 stars for being super delicious & beautifully arranged every single time I come here. I always get the Queen's Tea, which includes three tiers of fanciful goodies. The top tier has a varity of fruit, including grapes, pineapple, strawberry, kiwi, and orange. The middle tier has scones, double devonshire cream, strawberry jam, and lemon curd plus two cookies. The bottom tier has tea sandwiches of your choice (you pick two kinds), coldslaw, mixed greens with arugala, and their house vinegarette, which is pretty creamy & tangy. I usually always order the salmon and cream cheese, and either the stilton pear and cream cheese or roast beef and horseradish tea sandwiches! So delicious & flavorful. \n\nLet's not forget your choice of tea, which you will get with sugar and milk, all served in an assortment of fun, floral dishware & a huge teapot. I opt for black tea, preferably what is known as the \"Champagne of all teas,\" which they call Afternoon Darjeeling here at Lovejoy's. In my opinion, it is one of the more sophisticated teas that exist, and it is amazingly smooth, and just feels good going down (get your mind out the gutter lil' nasty). Afternoon Darjeeling tastes like assam tea and oolong tea mixed together, but it is a thin-bodied, hence the smooth sailing down the piehole... It tastes like a vacation! They do have a large variety of fun herbal teas, black, white, and green teas. I have tried a variety of their teas. Wish I reviewed them back then. Sorry guys! But the rose black tea is also awesome.\n\nService: the servers are always very nice, not extra nice, but they serve you right. Sometimes it is very busy, and they don't have time to charm you because, well, the tearoom itself can entertain you and the company of your choice should entertain you. They do get 5 stars for service. They keep everything short and sweet! Your will arrive at your table \"reserved for rotalty\" with a pretty plate of hot crumpets and butter during the middle of your meal. This is when you drop whatever you have in your hand, pick up your butter knife, thereupon smearing your butter over your nice hot crumpet and enjoy while it's fresh and hot. Oh, believe me, it's worth getting enthusiastic about. It's like if Lana del Ray arrived at your door at night offering to sing you some lullabies. That exciting!!!! Notice she's my current and always and forever crush. Anyway, you can of course devour that wonderous duo of crumpet and butter alone or savor it with a bit of lemon curd or strawberry jam. You're royalty when you're here, so you can do as you well damn please ;) You will also get a petite four at the end of you're meal. They usually have the option of strawberry, white wedding cake (my fav), esspresso, rice crispy treat, chocolate and apricot, among others I forget at the moment. \n\nCome to this lovely little tea room, you'll notice your pinky will automatically go up as you drink your cup of tea. It's not a mystery, it will just happen. Don't question it. Enjoy!", "author": "Amethyst Popkiss A."}

I live in SF, but they live in and around Washington, D.C.  I thought it would be much easier if I planned it, and I am SO HAPPY I found Lovejoy's on Yelp!  I knew nothing about tea parties and had actually never been to a tea before, but I liked the vibe and style of Lovejoy's: playful, mismatched cups and plates (I didn't know this was a \"thing\":), and very true to a British tea experience.  I would have been hesitant to do a tea like one that is done at a more expensive, stiffer place like the Ritz, for example. \nThis was right up my alley and everything from the communication to the planning, pricing, setup, event itself and returning the dishware went very smoothly.  \nCommunication:  When I inquired about a month prior to the shower (I was lucky they were available, I'd recommend planning sooner), Gillian followed up in a timely manner and gave me her email so we could more easily communicate specific items my mom and I wanted. We had several questions and Gillian answered each one thoughtfully and thoroughly.  When the date got closer, she had Nicola, the onsite staff who would set up our tea and food, contact us about logistics.  \nPlanning: It was slightly tricky because I was the main point of contact until my mom was able to join in on the email communication, and she wanted quite a bit more food than I thought we needed, and she had the foresight to ask more questions about dishware, setup, cleanup than I did!  That was fine and Gillian adjusted quotes as we went and had no problem with the multiple changes we made.\nPricing:  Everything was VERY reasonable, and  though I did not look into other places, I'd have a hard time imagining that other catered tea lunches providing the same level of service and quality of food and tea would be this inexpensive.  We had 20 guests and we rented ALL of the dishware and flatware AND we had the caterer setup for an hour and pick up the items the next day.  \nSetup:  Nicola arrived a little over an hour before the event, explained what everything was and how to serve the tea and crumpets with simple, yet specific instructions.  Everything looked beautiful!\nThe Baby Shower:  So many people commented on how delicious the food was, from the sandwiches to the scones (even the gluten free ones for our wheat intolerant guests!), truffles, petit fours, salad and dressing, to the fresh fruit!  We had the event in a 2 bedroom suite at the Ritz Carlton Club and Residences where my parents were staying during their SF visit, and many people said they assumed it was a Ritz Tea.  The quality and presentation were both top rate.\nI had a such a great experience that a few of my girlfriends and I from the shower plan to go to the tearoom for a lunch date.

I heard an older woman, who looked to be a manager, telling staff something like, \"Only an hour per table.\" Someone came over and up-sold me a dessert on top of the \"Light Tea\" I ordered.\n\nThen a staffer asked that I get off my cell phone, which I suppose would have made sense if it was a quiet day. But it wasn't. And I hate people on cell phones pretty much everywhere, so I understood, but it happened to be my birthday and I was sitting alone, so a friend called to take pity on me.

Be warned: you MUST make a reservation no matter what. I I arrived here at 10:50 A.M. for my 11 A.M. reservation, and there was already a long line of other folks who had made reservations. After we were all seated in the crowded shop, there was hardly any room left for non-reservation customers to see if they could squeeze in a spot. The ambiance here is very artsy and hipster, with a touch of Victorian (typical San Franciscan artsiness), and the staff is super friendly and nice!!! However, the quality of the food and tea was what disappoints me about this place. The sandwiches had too much mayonnaise in them, and the desserts were far too sweet for my liking. The teas were bland and stale, but the scones were top notch!! Additionally, I like how they serve their food on the tiered plates, which Lisa'a Tea Treasures does not do. I'm sad to give this place 3 stars, because I really want to give it a higher rating, but the food and teas fell short of my expectations :( still a very lovely place!!!", "author": "Taehyun P."}

They serve these little finger-food sized sandwiches on a 3 or 4 level tower. There are 5-6 different types. I think everyone's favorite was the roast beef and horseradish although they were all good - egg salad, ham, cheese, asparagus, all kinds of good stuff.\n\nTheir English Breakfast tea was fantastic. We also had some mango tea (my favorite) and chestnut. I was wary of the chestnut at first, but that was pretty decent as well. Had a great time here.", "author": "Jenn C."}

However, every time we made a reservation, we always had to cancel it. \n\nThis time, we came for our friend's bachelorette party. She loves tea so it was the perfect place for her. If you get off at 24th St BART station, it's about a 20 min walk. The other way is to take public transportation. Since I was already going to be out in the city, my husband dropped me off.\n\nThe place is small, with a table for every corner to accommodate the guest size with space for guests and employees to get around. For me, it's not as spacious as two of the tea places I've been to. One of my friends (who happened to be one of our other friend's bridesmaid) decided on the high tea menu. We had a variety of tea sandwiches, salad and scones (with jam or butter). Everyone was able to have at least 8 tea sandwich slice. It was actually more than enough. I think this is the first time I've seen salad served.\n\nFor tea, we had decaffeinated tea, vanilla tea, passion fruit tea and mango tea. The last two, we ordered from the tea list. The passion fruit tea was actually a favorite. Most of the guests were there for hanging out while there was one other party for a baby shower. At the end, my friend was given a spoon for a memento.\n\nOverall, I think all the guests had a wonderful time. On the other hand, my friends and I were happy that we finally made it. It's a nice place if you want to hang out with the girls or have a small party. I would love to come back here again.", "author": "Jenn D."}

I thought their teas were tasty and their food too. It is a bit hard to compare two different styles. \n\nI made reservations about a couple days in advanced for Saturday at 4pm. I called a couple times hoping to talk to an actual person but always getting voicemail. I left a voicemail stating my reservation information and left a contact number. Within 30 minutes I got a call back to confirm. Hint: Although they open til 6 the last seating is 4.30pm. \n\nI am really glad I made reservations as when I got off the J train it looked like there was a lot of people. \n\nWe ordered the light tea for two since both ate lunch. \nLight Tea - Your choice of one sandwich, served with a scone, preserves, and Devon cream, Fresh fruit and shortbread tea biscuit $17.95 (Additional light teas can be added for $17.00) \n\nI like how you can actually pick your sandwiches. I picked the shrimp and mayo whereas my friend cream cheese & mandarin oranges. Both was good! Tasty! The crusts were removed and the left overs are cut into fourths. At Crown and Crumpet, we had to cut those 1/4 sandwiches in half so we can both try the different sandwiches. It sure is a lot of work to cut small sandwiches even smaller. \n\nThe scones really filled me up but they were really good. I like the scone and the short bread. \n\nOverall, the food was good and surprisingly filling. We didn't eat anything else for the rest of the night. \n\nThe teas got really bitter fast! The herbal forest berries/rosehips was very strong. It reminded me of those ice teas you buy at walgreens. I didn't like it. \n\nThe service here is good but I felt like we were rushed out.

(with nuts and berries and such) - verry delicious and it was served with devon cream ...what i like to think of as a cross between butter and cream cheese\n\nCole Slaw + Salad\n- not too impressive but a healthy addition to all the butter you are getting.  basically the salad is the Costco baby green mix (that one you get in the plastic box) and the cole slaw is sliced cabbage with light mayo (non-sweetened...such a difference from KFC) and very plain tasting\n\nCrumpets:\n- its like one of those vietnamese coconut waffles except in the shape and color of an english muffin.  it was nice and fresh, but slightly soggy when it cooled down.  we had lemon curd on the side - it was like liquified lemon merengue pie.  \n\nMango Tea was not very fruity...it also had a bitter aftertaste\nVanilla Tea was very smooth and fragrant, and left no bitter aftertaste\n\nI would totally recommend this place if you want to eat at a very unique place.  there are very few places who bring you back to 100 years to have a tea party.  also it's great if you are trying to get skinny.  all the food is delicate and eaten slowly so u get full off of a few bites...  \n - get the Lovejoy's special sandwich\n - enjoy a scone\n - get some vanilla tea", "author": "Tina A."}

It's a great place to go when you want to have a special place to go with food that isn't too heavy. It's not the place to go if you're going to do something serious, like work on a novel or have a business meeting. Save that for the busy, crowded coffee shops and your break room.\n\nWeekends are generally booked until forever, but they will always take walk-ins. Be prepared for a long wait, but it'll be worth it for two to three things: 1) excellent tea, 2) the yummiest scones you will experience while in a fancy chair whilst feeling like royalty, and for those who like to daydream up stories, 3) the service and the occasional English waiter or waitress. It's the perfect whimsical Alice-in-Wonderland-esque place to have a grand old time with your friends, family, significant others, or handsome strangers.\n\nI've never been disappointed in the tea. It's freshly brewed and loose leaf, and the flavors they have all work so well with all the tea services they offer. I had the Royal Tea, and it's by far my favorite - it's got a touch of grenadine! Oh yes. They always keep your teapots full and the servers make sure to take care of the tea so it always steps evenly. Much appreciated! Plus, I love the extra fanciness of all the random china that's used - I had a friend who described the place as, \"It looks like a little old lady threw up all over the place with all the mismatched china and decor. It's awesome.\" That's pretty much the most perfect definition for Lovejoys.\n\nAn added bonus is the people-watching: I love seeing how folks dress up for their version of a tea party. Overall, a good time, and totally worth the wait if you love yourself a cuppa. Just remember - last seating is at 4:30 and the kitchen closes half an hour before Lovejoys does, so being early is not only good manners, it's just going to work out in the long run.

If eaten at the pace of teatime, it proves to be just the right amount of filling.\n\nAs previous reviewers have said, the interior is charming. Lovejoy's is meant to feel like what we'd imagine a British tearoom to be, and I thought it largely succeeded. Our party was seated at a pair of comfortable couches, instead of a table, and everything was covered in slightly weathered lace (don't look too closely at the upholstery). Each teapot was unique and darling in its own way, and everyone got individual strainers. Food was served in tiers or on platforms. Our spots were marked \"reserved for royalty,\" and the waitress was the perfect amount of peppy, attentive, and patient.\n\nI would recommend reservations.

Was there for my cousin's baby sprinkle (as opposed to shower). We were a party of eleven adult ladies, 3 twee tea drinkers and 1 very well behaved 7 month old. The atmosphere was very quaint and welcoming. We were treated like Royalty as our place card stated. The tea sandwiches, scones, crumpets, and of course the tea, were all magnificent. My favorite tea was the \"Rose Hips\".  I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back. The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is because I've never been to a tea room to compare to this one. I've read reviews of tea rooms in Solano county where I live and I have a feeling that the others don't measure up to this one.", "author": "Cheryl M."}

I almost felt like I had stepped into a different world; Lovejoy's is really like no other place I've been.\n\nWe ordered the Queen's Tea for two; to drink I had the special- strawberry herbal tea which I quite enjoyed, though I have to admit I was most impressed by all the beautifully presented snacks.  I absolutely loved the fresh warm scones and crumpets, the clotted cream & lemon curd were both divine, and all of the little sandwiches were very tasty!  Between us we ordered the cucumber & cream cheese, pear & stilton, smoked salmon & cream cheese, and turkey & mustard sandwiches, and they were all very enjoyable!  The fresh fruit was lovely as well, but the salad and coleslaw didn't do much for me.  (Still, I very much enjoyed the meal overall.)  The adorable, sugary, and delicious petit fours at the end were a delightful note to end things on, though by the time we got to those I was already stuffed!\n\nI definitely enjoyed the experience, the tea, and all the tasty treats, but I do feel like the prices were a little high.

Some men may never have the high tea experience and I'm lucky enough to have been here so many times.  Since my friend lives in the Diamond Heights neighborhood, she had known about Lovejoy's long before they became super popular.  \n\nMy first concern when coming here was about whether I'd still be hungry when I left.  Well, having ordered the High Tea and the Queen's Tea many times, that quickly became a non-issue.  The variety of sandwiches to choose from, the scones with jelly, and the appealing pub fare menu looked and tasted equally appealing.  On my last trip here, I remembered seeing a Shepard's Pie on the menu but not a Chicken Pot PIe.  I could have sworn that I had a chicken pot pie here long ago...maybe it was a special request or they don't do it anymore.\n\nAs always, the biggest challenge is to get a reservation here on a weekend.  A fourteen days in advance reservation call to them is highly advised.  They usually have two walk-in tables for people without reservations so whoever gets to the door first before they open will get those tables...and possibly any tables where the reservation party didn't show up.  Since my group got there forty minutes before they opened, we were lucky to get the first walk-in table.\n\nSince it is a small room, the higher volume of ambient noise does make it difficult to talk and seating around your table could be a bit snug.  But after a few minutes, these small issues will pass through your conscious mind after pouring your first cup of tea and enjoying the first few bites of a tasty roast beef and horseradish sandwich.\n\nI definitely won't mind coming back to Lovejoy's because this English style tea house was my first introduction to the tea experience.  I can't imagine going to any other tea house unless they could surpass what Lovejoy's brings to the table...and I highly doubt that any locale in SF can do that.", "author": "Ben H L."}

Their reservations fill up quickly around holidays, but if you plan ahead you won't have a problem finding something that works for you. I've come with small and large groups, and everyone always has a blast. \n\nFirst-timers never fail to comment on how cute the space is itself. You feel as though you've walked into a Victorian grandmother's parlor. With mismatched furniture and English china, framed sayings and hats on the wall, Lovejoy's provides plenty of pieces to keep the conversation going. Once the food is served, however, all attention goes to the edible.\n\nFor $17-20 per person, the tea service is surprisingly filling. Typically, each guest chooses a service which comes with a personal pot of tea (unlimited refills included) and a range of tea snacks from biscuits and scones to salad and sandwiches. They serve their scones fresh and warm with an authentic Devon cream that melts in your mouth. If your afternoon tea is also your lunch, I recommend the High Tea which comes with 2 sandwiches, salad, a scone, and a shortbread tea biscuit. My favorite sandwich selections are the cucumber & cream cheese (a tea time classic) and the chicken apple walnut salad. Since I gravitate toward floral tea flavors, I always order the China Rose Petal black tea and add some milk.\n\nFor those with a sweet tooth, the tray of petit fours can be irresistible if you still have room after your service. I have only tried the Victorian Wedding Cake which tasted very much like a standard vanilla cake pop but was a slightly bigger portion.\n\nThe lovely ladies who run the place are ever the gracious hosts--checking in for questions, constantly refilling tea pots, and never rushing the party.

Reservations more than a week in advance recommended too!\n\nMy best friend and I are really into tea places. We went to Crown and Crumpet a few months back. She suggested to bring me here for my 25th birthday because she's been here a few times and thinks it's better than C&C. The place is small and has a quirky mismatching decor all around. The service is exquisite.\n\nWe sat down and our server was warming. She took our orders and answered all the questions I had. We both ordered the Queen's Tea with an apricot tea and china rose petal black tea. I love the apricot but milk and sugar was needed. It smells delicious though! Wasn't a huge fan of the china rose petal. I felt it was too floral. \n\nOur food came pretty quick and soon enough, I was munching on tiny triangular-shaped sandwiches. I got the roast beef & horseradish sandwich along with the smoke salmon and cream cheese. My BFF got a turkey and cranberry. I am usually not a fan of cranberry, but I took a bite of her sandwich and I think it was my fave out of the three. The roast beef was slightly dry and bland.\n\nThe scones and pastries were good and fruits were fresh. I loved the crumpets, as usual. Buttery and with extra cream on top! Yum!\n\nThis place is cheaper than Crown and Crumpet, but I do think the decor there is prettier/girlier/fancier.\n\n\nWe saw an elder pair of granny's and we hope that it would be us in another 50 years :)", "author": "Rosanne L."}

As evident by my Yelp ID, I'm not British, but I do like English style sandwiches - crust cutoff, cut into triangles, only a few slices of meat - which is very much like Japanese sandwiches (I don't know the historical facts, but I'm sure Brits brought the technique to Japan).  While I love mile-high sub sandwiches too, I crave for English sandwiches once in a while.  I've been disappointed with ones at On the Bridge in J-Town (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pLZFRsn8HjVzcITHqa8Yfw), so I'm glad Lovejoy's does it right.\r\n\r\nAs you enter Lovejoy's, it feels like you've entered Jane Austen's living room.  Along with chairs from your dining table, they have couches and antique chairs.  All their cups and pots are unique - none of them match.  As you may expect, 90% of customers were female, probably because male customers feels a 'tea room' would not provide enough food to qualify as a lunch.  I'll get into this later, but they do give you enough food for a full lunch.\r\n\r\nService was excellent as we were offered for tea refills (bottomless service) three times.  Host was quite friendly and explained which sandwiches were popular.  \r\n\r\nFOOD:  We got High Tea ($16.50) and 2 sandwiches.  Although sandwich meal didn't come with a pot of tea, since my high tea came with a pot, by paying extra $1, two people were allowed to enjoy unlimited pot of tea.  See the pictures I uploaded for menu and High Tea as it shows how pleasing it is to the eye as it is to your tongue.  \r\n\r\nIf there is any CONS I have about this place, it may be the price.  High tea at $16/person and Queen Tea at $20/person seem a bit high.  But, note one thing: I have a fairly large appetite, but I became full with High Tea.   \r\n\r\nYou can easily make your trip to Lovejoy's as a weekend activity by spending a long time drinking their bottomless tea and later visiting their Lovejoy's Attic across the street.

The sandwiches are simple but they are good and there's a variety to choose from. The scones are warm and buttery when they are brought out but I'm not too crazy about their shortbread tea biscuits.

It was awesome. We tried each other's teas and they were all pretty good. \n\nEach of us had our own teapot and it ironically matched our outfits. I had their passion fruit and it was good! Also tried apricot, mango, and earl grey! \n\nIf you use the ladies' room, make sure you check out the clipboard they have in the back! It's really cute. It's filled with inspiration and I remember seeing a quote \"REAL MEN DRINK TEA.\" hahahaha thought that was funny. props to all the bold men that go here because it's filled with ladies. \n\nAfter tea, go to the giftshop across they street!

Our tea and food were brought out as soon as all the guests had a chance to sit down. An area was set aside for the presents. They brought out a plastic garbage bag for all the wrapping paper/garbage in case we wanted to open presents. The leftover food was boxed up so that we could bring the leftovers home.

For one, I don't believe we wanted to stay for that long and two they should say that before we order. I mean are they going to kick us out because we don't want to order about $3 worth of more food. Any ways even though this bugged me I still looked at their menu but honestly didn't find anything we wanted, so we decided to get some little desserts they had in trays. The dessert isn't even made there they buy it from a bakery called Diana's.

I'd recommend the Yorkshire Gold, as the Pomegranate Green wasn't really for me. The waitress said the Yorkshire Gold kind of resembles a coffee or English tea flavor, and I really can't describe it in words but I thought it was pretty good. The Shepherd's Pie is cooked in a loaf pan with a baked potato layer on the very top, followed by a mashed potato composition on the bottom mixed with peas and ground beef. It was a great appetizer to split among the four of us! The tea sandwiches served as the perfect snack as well, but definitely are not enough to fill you up.

It's strange because I don't think Lovejoy's is superior to its competitors in any of the areas I judge a British tea room on, and usually that has to be the case to warrant 5 stars from me. However, sometimes things are greater than the sum of their parts and my overall experience at Lovejoy's was five-star.\n\nDecor and Ambience: Like many British tea rooms, Lovejoy's is dotted throughout with fancy, antique teaware. The quaint setting is accented with old photos and Christmas lights. There's ample seating, although reservations are a must and the seating can accomodate parties large and small. Expect a pleasant buzz of chatter at all hours of operation\n\nTeaware: The saucers, cups and strainers have lovely Victorian designs with Mid-Century modern materials. The tea trays were a little disappointing--dull and metal\n\nTea selection: Lovejoy's offers some unique options like vanilla rooibos along with classics like English Breakfast. I didn't find the former very good, but I'd definitely recommend the \"house\" tea, the Tea Room Blend. Overall, I think the menu offers a good selection of British/Western favorites, but those hoping for good Asian options might be disappointed\n\nFood: I found the prices a little high, considering the portion size, but the quality is definitely above average. I got the \"Me Tea\". The smoked salmon and cream cheese tea sandwich came on fluffy white bread and the salmon was moist and delicious. The scone was a little dry, but the accompanying Devonshire cream was plentiful and rich. I saw that Lovejoy's offered pasties and I just had to order a beef one. When I lived in London, I had the most delicious beef pasties and it's been extremely hard for me to find good ones in the US. Lovejoy's had a fantastic filling of flavorful beef and diced carrots with just the right amount of seasoning. The pastry shell was flaky, but the ones I had in England were thicker and crisper. I also tried two petit fours: the strawberry shortcake and the raspberry Victorian wedding cake. We were told the insides were marzipan (which I'm not really a fan of), but they were more like cake. Both were very sweet and delicious, but I think I preferred the strawberry shortcake\n\nService: Fantastic. Friendly, warm, attentive and efficient. All servers knew their menus inside and out, and were clearly passionate about afternoon tea\n\nAll in all, I had a wonderful afternoon chatting with my two Boston girlfriends who had just moved to San Francisco.

I feel like a princess every time I've been there for high tea.\n\nThree cheers for bottomless tea!  I am a tea fanatic and can't get enough of it!! Their ginseng green tea is superb, very light and not too bitter.  The ginseng is a plus too. I absolutely love their pesto and prosciutto sandwich (available only on Fridays I believe), the pesto is zesty and the prosciutto is ever so tasty.  Their chicken salad sandwich is divine, and don't even get me started on their smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwich! Yummy!!  Their scones are also to die for, and paired with the lemon curd...delicous!  Lovejoy's lemon curd is also perfect!  It's not too tart and has that perfect balance of sweet and tangy that creates a symphony of delight in your mouth!\n\nI could boast about their shepherd's pie and brag endlessly about their delectable pasties as well as their cheerful and polite staff--always willing to give the absolute best service to their customers. \n\nI will definitely be frequenting Lovejoy's every few weeks or so because, accurately reflecting the five stars they deserve, they're as good as it gets!!", "author": "Paula G."}

We made reservations so our table said, \"Reserved for Royalty\" - cute touch!  We picked the Queen's Tea which gave us two choices of sandwiches each, a salad, coleslaw, two scones with lemon curd (kicking myself for not buying a bottle) and a jam, fruit, 2 crumpets, and we each chose a tea that was refilled and kept fresh throughout our lunch.  We were so full by the end of it.  The turkey sandwich with a port wine cheese was so good.  I also enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich.  \n\nThe decor was lovely.  A warm inviting space with mismatched chairs and different style tables.  I believe two seating arrangements had comfy couches.  I loved the vintage tea pots, cups, and saucers.  \n\nWe had to go across the street to the Lovejoy shop and buy the apricot tea that we loved.  I also picked up a cup and saucer that I love!\n\nThe whole experience was awesome and I will definitely be back!", "author": "Aimee L."}

We paid 25 each including tax and tip for high tea and petit fours, which is quite reasonable considering we each got bottomless tea, salad, coleslaw, 8 mini sandwiches, a scone and a tea biscuit. I also had the lemon curd petit four, which was tasty, albiet a bit sweet after having the tea biscuit and clotted cream scone but I couldn't resist how cute they were!\n\nMost of the time my reviews focus on the food rather then the service (I will go back to a yummy place even if the service is so so) but you really pay for the experience/ambiance here.

The only downside is that in order to make a reservation (and this is a MUST DO) you almost always have to book 2-3 weeks in advance. They never answer their phones so you'll have to leave a voicemail and they call you back.

I am not generally a fan of this, but my sister really liked it. We got first pick of our table so we picked the table with the most comfy looking chairs near the window. We chose the queen's tea for two. I was pleased that you are able to choose your sandwiches, we chose:\nchicken apple walnut: best sandwich!\nspecial: chicken pesto: very good!\nturkey and dijon mustard: meh. it was ok\nOnto the teas. \n we picked vanilla rooibis or however you spell it and the berry harvest thingie. It tasted like warmed up fruit punch. I did not like the selections of teas, it might just be me, but i feel like other places have better selections. the Vanilla was okay though! \n\nthe scones were delicious of course, i liked the sandwiches. I too, thought the coleslaw is totally random. I asked if we could sub the coleslaw and greens for fruit, they said no. ugh. I hate when establishments say no to customers. the petite fours were okay, Actually, I guess everything was kind of just okay. it sucks because I love crown and crumpet, but I hate that you can't choose your sandwiches, etc. So I thought I'd try Lovejoy's, and I didn't want this review to be a compare and contrast to crown and crumpet but in my honest opinion, crown and crumpet is just the better choice. \noh and for reference, we came from stockton, took the bart from dublin/pleasanton, and got off on 24th and mission and took a 4 minute cab ride to church and clipper. easy peasy!", "author": "ren u."}

I consider myself a big eater with a bottomless stomach, but I could not finish the plate--excuse me, I mean platter! The Healthy Tea came with one of the most delicious hummus (hummi?)

I love all the different teapots and the mismatched plates and tea equipment.  The atmosphere is really nice.\n\nService:  We went on a very rainy day.  So it wasnt so crowded.  We had a reservation and even though it wasn't crowded, I highly recommend making a reservation.  There is a 2 hour maximum in which a table has time to eat - and there is a good reason for that - I am guessing most if not all, maximize this 2 hour.  We stayed until 10 minutes after closing.  The wait staff were super polite and accomodating.  They didn't rush us, and offered boxes.\n\nFood: The food is really good here.  Obviously this isn't a foodie's choice if you are a hipster.  The scones though, man, it was so warm and fluffy and so good. The sandwhiches I had were:\nSalmon and Cream Cheese: My favorite one by far, super flavorful.  Any of their sandwhiches with salmon is good.\nChicken and Walnut Salad:  A review recommended this.  It was quite bland and there really wasn't much to it.  Don't bother with this.\nSandwich of the day - Ham and Mango Chutney:  I thought this was pretty meh too.  An interesting combination at first, but nothing amazing.\nI liked the crumpet - but none of my friends did.  A very fluffy and pancaky english muffin.  Slather  generous portions of butter, devonshire cream, lemon curd, and raspberry jam to get something truly amazing.  Those crumpets have holes for a reason.\nThe petit four - You have four option, a sugar cookie, some mini cupcakes and 2 types of marzipan mini cakes.  The plum rose marzipan cake was overwhelmed by the marzipan.  However the bittersweet orange one had a good balance of marzipan and flavor.  That one was good, We didn't bother with the other options as they seemed very plain.\nAll in all, if we did this, my friends agreed they would only do Tea and Scones, because really those were the highlights. but I like the crumpet, and only the salmon sandwich.\nThe fennel/caraway coleslaw salad was very good.  I didn't care about the green salad or the fruit on top.  I would have had the coleslaw, scone, and crumpet again.  But just one sandwiches(salmon) and no petit four.\n\nTea:  I tried the passion fruit tea.  It was very pleasant.  \nI wasn't impressed by the masala chai.  But My god - I forgot what my friend got - I think the royal blend.  I never had tea like that before. The flavor was really complex, fruity and it even felt like there were multiple blends of black tea.  I was also very impressed by the black vanilla.  I had so many vanilla type teas I rolled my eyes when I saw the menu.  But when I tried my friends cup, I was blown away.  The vanilla flavor wasn't anything I have tasted before.  I hate it when I have vanilla tea or flavored anything because it just reminds me of extract.  This felt like a different species of vanilla, and tasted very organic and felt very \"infused\" \n\nMy biggest regret is that they offered to give the remains of the tea in the pot to go.  and I thought it silly to take it with me.  Now I am having massive cravings for the royal blend and the black vanilla and I can't do anything about it.\n\nPrice doesn't usually affect my yelp reviews.  But for four people all ordering Queen's Service - it came out to $35.00 with tax and tip included.  Please do not come here to just try the tea and food, this really is a social and dining experience.

One watery tea pot was brought out and we were told that three of us would need to share one pot. The ratio of tea to water was skimpy so no amount of steeping helped. Only hot water refill was offered, not more tea. What we'll do differently next time is request the Queen Teas to be served separately, and for each order of tea to be served in individual tea pots.

Located right off a metro stop on the J Line,  I remember passing by the store when I was in 24th Mission but had concluded it was some sort of salon because of its looks.\n\nWe arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time, but got seated immediately with a cute sign on the table that said \"Reserved for Queens\". We ordered \"High Tea for Tea\", which gave us a substantial amount of food. When it says \"four sandwiches\" they actually mean four whole sandwiches, not four quarters or four halves like some other tea places. They slice it into quarters, so there were 16 quarters in total.\n\nSavory:\n-roast beef and horseradish: This had a nice zing to it provided by the horseradish, \n-chicken apple walnut: This probably had the most filling-to-bread ratio and it tasted like the chicken apple salad that they sell at Costco, which I actually liked\n-smoked salmon and cream: Salmon tasted fresh and this was our favorite\n-pear and stilton: your standard sharp tasting stilton\n\nSweets:\nThe scones were more like biscuits with raisins and I prefer more buttery scones, but props to them for still being somewhat warm when they came out even if they were a little dry. It was served with Devonshire cream and preserves and those were definitely done right!\n\nThe shortbread tea biscuits were surprisingly decent tasting. \nWe got the Italian wedding cake and a chocolate apricot petit four a la carte. They were $2.50 apiece, which seemed quite steep for a wee piece, but I believe they get it from Dianda's bakery (25th + Mission) that also sells it for the same price.\n\nAmbience: I definitely thought this place was more shabby than chic, like some kind of untouched-for-centuries, dusty house that I would be afraid to touch. I do prefer somewhere that has some finesse, while still keeping the Grandma and girly vibe like Lisa's Tea Treasures,  but this is more a matter of taste preference, so it didn't impact my rating. What did MATTER was the tables were cramped and quite close to each other, making it difficult to go to the bathroom. We could also hear a lot of different conversations. I would prefer more private tables with wider spacing, so I could just relax, but that's just not feasible in a small and popular place. I saw a bridal shower and I felt as if I would want a private room or alcove with less tables if I were them, which is offered in some tea places. The mismatched teapots/cups/strainers resulted in my friend getting a tea strainer that was not wide enough to place on her huge cup, so she had to do a switch-a-roo.\n\nService: The ladies offered to take a picture for us and were quite prolific in topping off our tea with more water. After some time, it seemed like they were a little too hasty in trying to take our food away before we finished, but nothing super offensive.

We tried two teas: darjeeling black tea, which we drank with milk & sugar like we heard the Queen does & their \"special find\" of the day which was pomegranate green tea (totally try whatever \"special find\" they are offering. This one was exquisite.) Each tea was served in a different style teapot. \n\nEAT ME:\nThe tea sandwiches were dainty, delicate & delicious & were served on a two tiered porcelain carrier . We chose:\n- cucumber & cream cheese (obviously)\n- apple walnut chicken salad\n- tomato & cheese\n- \"lovejoy special\" of the day- ham & mango chutney\nAlso included were: salad, cole slaw, two scones & two tea biscuits. We could not stop raving about the scones, which were unusually moist & buttery (as opposed to dense & hard like other scones.) And the double devon cream & strawberry jam made it that much more decadent (a little *too* decadent says my scale.)\n\nADORE ME:\nI just experienced Lovejoy's for the first time this week & I am already planning another trip back ASAP. Prices are decent for the extraordinary tea party experience you get & service was simply marvelous.

The cream tea choice came with scones, devon cream, and fresh fruits. Omgosh, the scone took my breath away. It was melted in my mouth. I was expecting something super sweet, but nope, it was just perfect. Not too sweet, but not too bland. And the cream and jam were all so good that I kept trying to add both on the scone for every bite. When the tea came out, we had the chance to add our own sugar and cream, so I loved that.

It is overpriced for the quantity and portion of the little cakes, sandwiches, cookies and scones one gets. The tab can easily go over $50.00 for just two people. And, what is really disappointing is that price can buy a lot more someplace else. \n\nThe atmosphere is charming and the service that day was good. Yet that was because they were not busy. I wonder what it would have been like if the place was full and all the staff were very busy. \n\nIn these times with easy-to-make recipes, for cakes, packaged cookies and microwave ovens, etc. there is no excuse for any type of baked good to be so overpriced. Starbucks and Peet's makes a more hearty and hefty sized portion of scone, muffin and cake than what was offered to us. And, at a more reasonable price. \n\nAlso, with regards to tea, even loose-leaf varieties, the selection of teas one can buy in the supermarket or at Peet's, Starbucks for that matter is always available.  \n\nMy friend and I would have done much better to purchase all the needed items for a tea service at home and saved some money if we had done it ourselves. \n\nYet, it is nice to be served by a pleasant staff and have all the dishes, table clothes, and so on.

I believe we had the High Tea for four and this came with bottomless pots of tea for each of us. Their scones are so freaking delicious! I want some right now just thinking about it.

I love that it feels like someone's super-cozy living room, and that the entire staff is incredibly sweet and treats you like family.\n\nThey were also really great about getting us a table at noon on a Saturday without a reservation. Someone had the table reserved for 1:30pm (seatings are usually 2-hours), but they let us squeeze in with the understanding we'd have to short it a bit. Still, it didn't matter. They took our order immediately and we waited less than 5 minutes before our tea came. \n\nWe all ordered the high tea and we loved every bite. When that tower comes out and you see those dainty little sandwiches you think, \"This isn't going to be enough!\". And then... you start eating. You realize that the sandwiches are on a giant bed of nice, fresh salad, and suddenly you're only halfway in and you're totally full!\n\n$20 for high tea, worth every single cent. And they are extremely nice about refilling your teapot as often as needed. The staff was very polite and gave us good info about when they needed the table so we never felt rushed.

Girly, dainty, chintzy, and oh-so-English, it's a definite winner.\n\nGentlemen:  enter at your own risk.\n\nI have had both the High Tea ($17.95) and the Queen's Tea ($24.95), and I do think that unless you love crumpets (I don't) and petits fours (I do, but I can live without them after consuming a whole tea service), it's not worth the extra $7 for the Queen's Tea.  The High Tea is such a good bargain - so much food for under $20 - that it almost moots the point of the Queen's Tea, in my mind.\n\nWith both teas, you get your choice of tea sandwiches (I love the pear/blue cheese and the apple/cream cheese), tea (they're all good!), warm scone (with lemon curd, jam and clotted cream), coleslaw, spring salad (with mandarin oranges) and shortbread cookie.  The Queen's tea adds a crumpet, a petit four, and a lot of fresh fruit.  \n\nAll of the tea cups and saucers are mismatched, making it all completely adorable.  It's all for sale, too.  Just ask (they also have a shop with everything for sale across the street).  \n\nI like sitting near the front, near one of the windows.  It's especially nice if you can get a seat on the banquette and tuck yourself in.  The place is always packed, and it's good to be able to observe the fray, rather than be a part of it.  Speaking of packed, reservations are a necessity.\n\nThe waitstaff is always friendly and helpful, although they sometimes look a bit beleaguered.\n\nAnd the best part about coming here?  In addition to the delicious tidbits I hear from my friends over tea, I always end up hearing little snippets of other people's conversations (hey, the place *is* small), and I've learned more about complete strangers than I ever wanted to know.

There's nothing like taking a couple of hours to slow down and enjoy some quality time with scones, sandwiches and friends. My BFF and I came here on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon. Our table was waiting in the middle of the room. It was fun looking at all the random knick knacks and mismatched plates and cups. We decided on the high tea for two for $34 (that's $17 each). We got four sandwiches, coleslaw, spring greens, two scones, strawberry preserves and double devon cream, two shortbread cookies and two tea selections. I chose the black mango tea and it was great. You don't need sugar or milk because when a tea is good, you can just appreciate it for what it is. I loved how many loose leaves there were in the pot. \n\nWe chose the salmon & cream cheese, egg & onion, chicken apple walnut and asparagus & cream cheese sandwiches. All of them had the crust cut off and were pillowy soft. My favorite was the chicken apple walnut but none of the sandwiches were above average. The asparagus was a yellowish green color that looked like it was boiled too long but it tasted fine. The coleslaw was a little bland for me. Furthermore, I didn't like that the only taste I had was the caraway seeds that were mixed in. I had to spit out those little suckers after every bite. The salad was more like a garnish for the sandwiches to rest upon. I did like the little mandarin oranges in it though. \n\nThe warm scone with raisins was delicious as were the shortbread cookies. Heaven is biting into a warm scone with cream spread and strawberry preserves on top. Lovejoy's is a bit hyped up but the service was fantastic. Our pots were never less than half full.

They allow you to have a whiff of the dry tea leaves first to help with the tea selection but trust me the dry tea leaves do not do the black mango tea justice.\n\n Dry tea leaves are a bit musky but when it was steeped and poured out you can smell and definitely taste the mango scent and presence.  It was very fragrant and I liked that stand alone without the milk and sugar it still tasted delicious and I actually prefer it that way than with the additions.\n\n Being a tea junky I had 2 pots!!!! I love that the waitress comes from time to time to check if the tea is still hot otherwise they bring you a fresh hot pot back. \n\nWithin the Queen's tea you get a choice of 2 sandwich selections.  My friend got the savory tea so we got to taste a total of 4 types of sandwiches.  They quarter the sandwiches into adorable bite size triangles. \nWe selected the following:\n1) Chicken-Apple-Walnut- You could taste the crispness of the apple still. The ratio of the 3 items were good and the mayo wasn't overly lathered to mask the individual flavors. \n\n2) Pear Stilton- With my recent discovery that I actually like blue cheese I got this one. The stilton was so creamy and gave such a great nutty taste and the pear was thinly sliced and retained the crunchiness still. It's a perfect combo! \n\n3)Cream Cheese and Mandarin Orange- this one was just ok, cream cheese and canned oranges. \n\n4) Love joy's daily special ( that day it was a smoked trout w/ capers). I loved smoked fish!!! The capers weren't too salty and the smoked trout definitely had the spotlight and wasn't masked. \n\nalong with the sandwiches I also had a wonderful warm scone that was flaky and crumbly enough. I liked the strawberry preserve that came with it and used the lemon curd on it as well. The double devon cream was ok used in moderation but a thick slab of it on the scone was too rich for me. \n\nThe queens tea also comes with fresh fruit , spring greens salad and coleslaw. Their coleslaw is interesting as its the first time i had fennel seed in one. It was pretty good. \n\nI wasn't too fond of the crumpet that was served. It was too big and hard to chew. Icouldn't cut it apart.\n\nThe sugar cookie /shortbread  was made perfectly and lightly dusted with sugar.\n\nLast was the selection of a petit fours. I chose the orange creme one that had a ribbon of dark chocolate in it. It was a bit too sweet for me so when I come back next time I'll probably get the triple dark chocolate one which was the runner-up. \n\nThe morning passed quickly into afternoon spent here chatting with my friend and we both enjoyed the service and hospitality. I would definitely bring my friends back here for a Girls day out. \n\nP.S: they give you a 10% off coupon if you visit Love Joy's attic found across the street if you like to bring back a souvenir of the tea you had or various tea cups pots etc.", "author": "Sharon Y."}

It is just soo cute and comfy, and the people who work there are soo nice, attentive and helpful.\n\nThe service is great. the servers are very knowledgeable, helpful, attentive, and nice. They are always checking to make sure your tea is hot, and they are always making sure that the food is good and that you are happy with everything.\n\nI have only ever gotten the queen's tea both times i've gone, and it was amazing both times. \nthe first time i got the pear and stilton sandwich and the goat cheese, sundired tomato, and olive sandwich. They were both amazing and satisfaying, and perfectly balance. \nthe second time i went i got the hummus and artichoke sandwich and the chutney and cheese sandwich. the hummus was okay, it was nothing special but it hit the spot, and the chutney was perfect. \n\ntheir scones were amazing, perfectly flaky, just the right amount of sweetness, and the perfect amount of raisins and currants. they were warm, and fresh, and amazing. the creme, jam, and lemon curd were also amazing and complimented the scones and eachother perfectly. \n\nthe shortbread cookies were sooo good, they were thin and cruncy, and so perfectly sweet. \n\nthe coleslaw is ridiculously delicious. I have never liked coleslaw and i am in love with their coleslaw. their sauce is amazing, and they put just the right amount of sauce on their coleslaw, and the rye seeds they add just make the coleslaw so much better than you would ever think coleslaw could be. \n\nthe fresh fruit they serve is also really delicious, although i wish they gave you more\n\nthe crumpets were really good. they were warm and fresh, and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. they were amazing with the lemon curd and the butter. I'm normally not a big crumpet fan, so the second time i went i just got them to give me an extra scone instead of the crumpet, but  you must try the crumpets at least once. \n\nthe petit fours are also amazing. the chocolate truffle with apricot was amazing, the walnut brownie was amazing, and the rose-water was amazing as well. they have a large and delicious petit four selection, and i have loved every single petit four that i have tried. \n\nfinally, their tea selection is amazing. I love their darjeeling, and they always keep your tea hot, and make sure that it's hot. they have a really wide selection of non-caffein teas as well, and they are all delicious. \n\nlovejoy's just has the greatest atmosphere and service and it is seriously the best tea room I have ever been to out of los angeles and san francisco.\n\ni made my friend who hates tea and pastries go to lovejoy's and she is now in love with tea time. that's how good lovejoy's is, it converted my pastry and tea hating friend to a tea time fanatic.\n\nlovejoy's is a must try if you are ever in the bay area, it is an amazing experience!\n\n\njust a side note, on the weekends, and even fridays, you should try to make reservations if you can, although they do also take walk-ins.", "author": "Rebecca A."}

The waitress was very pleasant, taking away plates when we were finished, and giving us clean plates so we wouldn't have to mix tastes. She was also very honest in giving her opinion about what was good on the menu vs. what was popular.\n\nI ordered the Queen's Tea and had he China Rose Petal (black tea). I chose the Chicken-Apple-Walnut sandwich and the Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese sandwiches. This set came with coleslaw (ehh), organic spring greens (really plain salad), a raisin scone with preserves (yummm!) and double devon cream (a better version of butter), a crumpet with lemon curd (delicioussss and zesty), fresh fruit, and a petit four and a shortbread tea biscuit.\n\nThe tea was very aromatic. It had just the right amount of flavor. Adding sugar and milk to it made it easier to drink, but I enjoyed it plain.\n\nThe sandwiches are are cut into fourths. The chicken-apple-walnut sandwich was quite delicious. It was basically a chicken salad with chunks of apple and walnut. Smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwiches were very normal. The ones I make at home taste about the same. I didn't touch the cole slaw cause I don't like it. The organic spring greens were bitter (as usual), but I didn't like the dressing enough to finish it (lighter type of dressing). The raisin scone is soft on the inside, but has just the right \"crunch\" on the outside. it went well with the butter and jam, but i was really into the lemon curd. Iono about the crumpet. Are they supposed to be like half pancake, half english muffins? I didn't finish it (even when spread with the lemon curd!) cause it was just unappetizing. The fresh fruit had a good variety (strawberries, grapes, grapefruit, blueberries, kiwis). The petit four was a strawberry shortcake with marzipan. Very sweet and delicious. Shortbread tea biscuit is how you would imagine it to be like, but not as heavy as a \"walker's\".\n\nI would give this place 5 stars because of the variety of foods offered, but I didn't like the quality/pairings of all the foods (eg. salad and dressing, crumpet). All together, for 2 light tea's and 1 queen's tea was $65 (inc. t&t).", "author": "Adorable T."}

While sipping my tea and taking small bites of my tiny ass sandwich, I couldn't help but think that the only thing I was missing was a dress and crown. Despite feeling out of place, I have to admit that the tea was bomb and the sandwich was like crack on bread.\n\nI think I'll come back here one day, in memory of you Crissie.

We headed over to the antique counterpart next door while waiting, where you can get the Devon cream, lemon curd, and of course the teas! Anyway, that's for another review.\n\nBack in the tea room, the place is tiny so it leans to more of a cramped than cozy feel, but that's your call. Decor reminds me of grandma's. Service is friendly but they do seem to push the time limit a bit much, that you start feeling rushed. Service is quick and the pots are never below half full also, kept at a good temperature, hot. The tea sandwiches are yummy, although quite pricey for the quantities given. At least the teas are bottomless.\n\nTheir scone/crumpet are quite plain, what makes them delicious is the Devon cream plus the preserves or lemon curd (You can buy the cream next door, I put it on waffles with the lemon curd, $8 for a small jar, eek!). You get a 10% discount on teas if you dined in the Tea Room. Their teas smell heavenly, I wanted to buy them all. \n\nOnce you have your cream, curd, teas: You can invite your girl friends over and recreate this tea party at home for a fraction of the cost!\n\nThe petite fours are good but pricey, would skip it next time, save me the $2.50 for spending at the antique shop.

This was pretty good, I liked how they offered horseradish instead of typical dijon mustard. The horseradish gave it more spice and brought out the flavors of the beef better.\n\nBay Shrimp and Mayonnaise. This was my favorite by far, it tasted really fresh and delish. The tanginess of the mayonnaise definitely enhanced the fresh taste of the shrimp and hid the oceany taste. \n\nSmoked Salmon and Cream Cheese. This was pretty good as well, just like my favorite lox and cream cheese sans bagel!\n\nChicken Apple Walnut Salad. My least favorite sandwich, mostly because I'm not really a fan of mushy salady sandwiches unless it's amazing and amazing this was not. It was just okay, nothing to write home about really. \n\n(Upper Level)\n\nScones with Strawberry Jam. These were alright, I think the scones at The Rotunda were better.

We made reservations and gathered a bunch of people too!  :-) \n\nWe went on Saturday, with a nine-year-old in tow.\n\nWe had their High Tea...four sandwiches (artichoke hummus, roast beef, smoke salmon and cream cheese, and chicken-walnut-apple salad), some greens salad (delicious vinegar-y dressing), buttery buttery [evil] scones with devonshire cream and raspberry preserves.  \n\nI also ordered some sausage rolls for the table (they're two-bite appetizers basically).  They were not greasy, flaky dough, and savory filling.  Yum.\n\nFor tea, we had the China Rose Petal...which was a strong black tea with hints of rose.  I tried my sister's English breakfast tea, which is different from what I am used to (outside of this tea room).  I was a bit flummoxed by how bitter it was, and how it totally required sugar for drinkability.  \n\nShe tempted us with petit-fours as well...so the kid tried triple chocolate (dark, milk and white), and I tried the plum rosewater one which was just so different and so addicting!  \n\nService = as expected.  They are very attentive, friendly, and just great about refilling your teapots and great about taking photos for us.  \n\nI'll definitely come back...\n\nOne of the plus factors for this place: they do not have overly flowery wallpaper, covered in same-fashioned dolls!  \n\nWarning: This is NOT a cheap place.

We tried the Tea House Blend and Passion Fruit. We had 4 sandwiches: smoked salmon and cream cheese, chicken/walnut/apple salad, mandarin oranges and cream cheese, and the Sandwich special of the day which was chicken curry. There were 2 large scones along with jam and clotted cream and a couple of shortbread cookies. The coleslaw and salad were also pretty tasty (coleslaw is nothing like the heavy mayo based slaw so you don't feel as guilty eating it). \n\nI say this is a great experience to have at least once in your life (even if you're not a fan or you think it's too pricey..

I could have done without the little sandwiches as neither of our selections were particularly good. Since we arrived with a big appetite we also purchased the sheppards pie and this puff pastry with pork in it. Both of those entree items were amazing. \n\nLovejoy's is a great place to have your first tea salon experience. We also noticed a large group of women that were holding a baby shower so I'd imagine that's pretty common at a place like this. \n\nIf you'd like to experience the whole pomp and circumstance than I'd suggest you order the \"High Tea\" or the \"Queens Tea\". Each meal comes with a bottomless pot of the tea of your choice. If you're  guy (like me) and want to experience good food then I'd suggest you get a pot of tea and the sheppard's pie. \n\nOverall a little spendy, and the service is okay, but it's great food/tea, casual (not stuffy) environment, and Lovejoy's will make sure you have a great experience.

I didn't play a role in the booking process but from what I understand, the reservation was made several months in advance. \n\nParking wasn't too difficult on a Saturday afternoon and most of us found spots within a few block radius. Lovejoy's was packed and groups were standing outside, waiting and chatting happily. \n\nInside was crowded but comfortable; cozy and inviting. Decor was a fun Victorian thrift store look with British overtones... kind of like Target's \"Shabby Chic\" line but way more authentic and personalized. \n\nThe tea was amazing and our server was incredibly patient in describing each of the varieties to us. I normally dump ridiculous amounts of sugar in any tea I encounter but found myself enjoying both the Chinese Rose Petal and Vanilla Rooibos straight on their flavor alone. Sandwiches for our party of 6 were served on a huge 3-tiered tray, cut into triangles and adorably lined up around the edges. We wondered what they did with all the cut-off crusts at the end of the day. \n\nOf the vegetarian options, the egg and onion sandwiches were quite good. Cream cheese is pretty much good in anything (wontons, sushi, frosting); paired with Mandarin oranges or sliced cucumber is no exception. The pear and Stilton (English blue cheese) combination, though interesting, did not taste particularly good. Our sandwiches were served with a delicious spring green salad in addition to large warm scones, preserves, and Double Devon Cream (which I thought was whipped butter). The coleslaw, which seemed like an odd addition to our tea and real salad, was creamy but bland and remained barely touched the duration of our meal. \n\nOverall, Lovejoy's was a wonderful place for our group to get together, visit, and lose track of time. The ambiance lent itself well to feeling cheerful and relaxed and the tea itself was exceptional. It seemed a bit pricey for such dainty fare... I suppose it's more of an experience than an actual meal but we were all hungry shortly after leaving. Also, some of the flavor combinations really missed the mark.

I even celebrated my birthday there one year and booked the area in the back. The staff accommodated my friends,  my gifts and even set up a tea leaf reader to come in. Beautiful selection of teas. Prices are reasonable. Best bet is to make a reservation. They do have walk in slots, but not many. This place books up about 2 sometimes 3 weekends in advance. They call you back right away to confirm and the women are lovely. The food is delicious and beautifully prepared. I love the shepards pie. One of my faves.

Hodgepodge furniture squished together, no room to even stick out your pinky finger to drink tea like a snob!  \n\nI understand that they are super busy, so I appreciate them fitting us in the 1 hour opening they had.  But the waitress was kind of strange and didn't provide us with attentive, fast service given that she wanted us to leave ASAP.  \n\nMy friend came in 3 minutes after we placed our initial order so the waitress said she would be right back to take her order.

You've arrived at your destination where the air is filled with lots of estrogenic energy and excitement.\n\nI'm not a girly girl by any means. My friends wore pretty dresses while I had on dark jeans and a grey t-shirt. Though I love tea houses and bars, primarily hippie and zen joints, I was apprehensive about going to a 'girly girl' tea room. I braced myself for the worst, but was pleasantly surprised from the moment I stepped inside Wonderland.\n\nLovejoy's is UK whimsical meets SF quirky. The space is decorated with all sorts of random trinkets, lace pillows, mismatched tea pots, cups, and saucers, and couches. Sit at a 2 or 4 top where the tables are 'reserved for royalty'. With our reservations, the five of us got to sit on the parlor couches 'reserved for queens' next to a giant red telephone booth. \n\nWe had two servers who were very helpful and attentive. Because I love variety, I like knowing what my options are and these ladies were on it! They gave their recommendations and then gave us options where we could mix and match to get the most out of our meal. What we got:\n\n****Queen's tea - a three tier platter: highly recommended!****\nTop tier: fresh, I mean FRESH blackberries, grapefruit, strawberries, kiwi, cantaloupe. Nuff said.\n\nMiddle tier: warm, fresh baked raisin scones with generous servings of raspberry spread, buttery cream, and lemon curd. This was by far my favorite tier -  conveniently placed at eye-level, these scones made it to my mouth and tummy in no time.\n\nBottom tier: light and refreshing housemade coleslaw, a bed of organic mixed greens, and bite sized triangle shaped sandwiches. The smoked salmon was fresh but a little too salty for my taste; the turkey with stone ground mustard was tasty, but my all time favorite was the apple, walnut, and chicken salad salad sandwich. Really light yet packed with flavor and served on both white and wheat bread.\n\nWe also had:\n\nChicken curry pastie: flaky and fresh but a little bland and nothing to write home about.\n\nPloughman's lunch - good to get if you like goat and bleu cheese, salt and vinegar chips, hummus, and chutney...but otherwise an odd combination. I'd stick with the Queen's tea platter.\n\nBottomless tea: we had the house blend (very strong and aromatic), mango decaf (didn't get to try), and Dragon Well green (lacked robustness, but probably because we didn't let it steep long enough).\n\nI'll definitely be back for more scones and tea. Offering a unique and fun 'girly' experience in the heart of Noe Valley, Lovejoy's is great for lunch, birthday & bachelorette parties, or torturing a male companion. Just kidding.

The presentation of the high tea was nice at first glance. It looks very full, but really it's just a whole lot of salad and fruit. Some other tea rooms offer little cakes and mini savory items which are more enjoyable. The Shepard's pie tasted very earthy which some people may enjoy, I found it to be a bit under seasoned and bland. Sausage rolls were slightly better than the pie but just not a lot of substance. The biggest turnoff was our waiter who while when ordering tea kept emphasizing the $9 charge. It was off putting and it felt like she thought we couldn't afford it.

For our sandwich selection, we had the smoked salmon and cream cheese, salmon mousse, mandarin orange and cream cheese, and bay shrimp and mayonnaise.\n\n[W] I thought the tea was pretty good here. I originally chose the Afternoon Darjeeling tea and saw the Genmai Tea written on a blackboard in the back of the restaurant.

The Genmai http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s-ihKanDRDHTD8U49HFA5Q?select=pOcaHOwOkJQRQSUJVsx19A was light and ricey. Kinda like the ones from Japanese and Korean restaurants.

The crumpet http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s-ihKanDRDHTD8U49HFA5Q?select=9KKmlGQB8rVk3Sc3ypRWOg looked like a sponge to me but was also good.

It was a bit strong and bitter and needed some water to tone down the flavor. My favorite tea selection at Lovejoy's is the China Rose Petal Black Tea and Strawberry Green Tea. The hostess recommended us the Chestnut tea. Perhaps we will try that next time. \n\n[W] Overall experience was nice.

We had visited before but were too late, so this time we wanted to make sure we would be able to get seated! \n\nWe waited for over half an hour to get the opportunity to sit in what we felt like was \"someones grandma's poorly decorated and somewhat musky, cluttered home\". We also had the pleasure of sitting 10 inches away form another party. Yay. \n\nWe had high hopes that all would get better, seeing that their selection of tea had interesting touches and their menu of snacks seemed very tasty.\n\nWRONG. \n\nThe tea was just OK and as much as I do NOT want to be reminded of what I ate there, I will share. My cousin and I ordered \"tea for two\" w/ a choice of 4 sandwiches. We chose the cucumber, salmon, chicken/asparagus and artichoke hummus sandwiches. After starting to taste our way through the sandwiches we came to a realization. I've made better cucumber sandwiches while drunk, the salmon's texture was very grainy and odd, artichoke hummus was not impressive whatsoever and for Christ's sake the chicken AND asparagus felt and tasted as if it was canned, preserved, aged. The other accompaniments - scones, mixed greens and coleslaw were mediocre. The cream and curd were far from fresh.  The man sitting less than half an arm-length away from me mentioned to his wife and mother in law that these scones were by far better than the scones sold at Starbucks.

Lovejoy's staff was absolutely amazing helping me to arrange it -- everything was very simple.  I reserved the group several months ahead (they're very popular), and then they just had me tell them the size of the guest list, even though they and I both knew the number of attendees would be far smaller, they were just earmarking more than enough space for me.  Then I simply had to confirm the number of guests 48 hours before the event -- incredibly short notice, really convenient for last minute changes.\n\nSo!  For my group, I ordered the high tea + crumpets because I love crumpets.  I thought that on a per-person basis for a nice event, it was very reasonably priced.\n\nWhen I arrived half an hour early, our tables were already set up, and there were two tables set aside as gift tables, which were very nice to have.  I had plenty of time to lay out favors and seating cards as my guests trickled in.  Hot tea in an assortment of flavors was laid out immediately for guests to enjoy, and then they could order specific flavors as well.\n\nTen minutes after 4 o'clock, tea was served on large multi-tiered trays.  Everyone tucked in, and then crumpets were served about 10 minutes after people started winding down on the tea trays.\n\nTea pots were promptly refilled as they were emptied; the service was absolutely fantastic; and the food was more than anyone could eat.  I had a large bag of leftovers to take home, and that was a big bonus!   \nEveryone at the tea party let me know they had a fabulous time, and I highly recommend Lovejoy's Tea Room for any event that needs a good cup of tea.  :)", "author": "Tasha D."}

So the party, including the pregnant guest of honor, had to pack up, presents and all, and relocate to the back of the room. We obliged politely, not wanting to make a stink on a special occasion. I can appreciate catering to regular patrons where possible, but this was very unprofessional. There is also a two hour limit for the seating. Service seemed a little cold and rushed.

Something about sitting around a wooden table with a lace tablecloth, or antique-style sofa with a few friends and a nice pot of tea really resonates within me. One would think I feel like a pretentious bourgeois snob, and I am not hypocritical enough to deny it; however, just let it be known that being San Franciscan automatically ingrained a bit of elitism in me. That being said, Lovejoy's Tea Room was not the first time I've taken afternoon tea, and it certainly won't be my last.\n\nWe came to Lovejoy's for my friend's birthday and hoped that we did not miss our stop while riding the J-line. The exterior did not impress me, but the moment we stepped inside, it was as if we were transported into another world. In contrast to the brightness and cuteness of Crown & Crumpet, Lovejoy's interior looked antique and mismatched and absolutely lovely. The cups and plates were all unique and pretty. Of the three tea rooms I've been to thus far, the interior design of Lovejoy's is my favorite by far. \n\nLuckily for us, it was a slow Friday afternoon and we were immediately seated, despite our lack of a reservation. Score! In preparation for documenting my friend's birthday, I brought my camera so I ended up obnoxiously taking pictures of the interior. We made our order, of High Tea for four and the Queen's Tea for the birthday girl.\n\nFood was mediocre. Honestly, the best thing about the food they gave us was the dressing for the salad. I got the smoked salmon with cream cheese, and Lovejoy's special, which was chicken and pesto. Both were unimpressive and was much too creamy. The Devon Cream made me feel as if I were eating butter. I've had better scones elsewhere. The strawberry preserves they gave us was definitely not homemade, and reminded me of smuckers (didn't even spring for Bonne Maman!), and the lemon curd was not tart enough.\n\nBut the tea was fantastic! I loved the pomegranate green, and the China Rose Petal tea was a perfect sweetness (this is from someone who does not like herbal teas). Those were my favorites of the five we order. The waitress was also really nice.\n\nUsually, I'd give three stars for mediocre food, but the decorum, service, and company made the entire experience much more enjoyable than the food.

The best cream tea I've had in America!\n\nMy friends were also very pleased with their Savory Tea and crumpets.\n\nOnly drawback is that it's VERY crowded and a little noisy depending on what sort of groups are there (we had a children's birthday party and a baby shower in addition to other customers), which doesn't really make it the perfect place to linger over your bottomless pot of tea.  We still had a great time, and the quality of the food and the cheerful attitude of all of the staff made up for the crowd.  In spite of all the patrons, the service was very good - hardly any wait and never a cold pot of tea.  Ambiance and china were good.  \n\nIf you want to make sure you can get a table, call for a reservation very far in advance, especially on the weekends.  We didn't call early enough to get a reservation, but fortunately, they are pretty able to accommodate small groups of walk-ins.  Our wait was about 20 mins., and it passed very quickly as we browsed in their cute shop across the street.\n\nI hope to go back to Lovejoy's when we're in SF next - just hope to be able to plan it at a time when they're not as busy.", "author": "Ashley W."}

I was super excited though, and definitely not disappointed. It definitely has a cozy feel to it, so I wouldn't imagine it would be able to accommodate huge groups. I think the mismatched furniture and silverware adds a nice touch to the atmosphere. \n\nThe sandwiches were really good! We had the high tea for two and were rather full by the end. We got the cucumber sandwich, roast beef with horseradish, salmon with cream cheese and stilton and pear (love!). The warm scones were delicious and the dressing for the salad was lovely. Not the hugest fan of the coleslaw, probably because of mint? in it. I don't know.

I know, I know. I used to be just like you. Laughing in a bad English accent, \"Tea and crumpets with the Queen?\" Pshhh. And we all know \"cucumber sandwhiches wtih the sides cut off,\" are frowned upon by heffers far and wide. But let me tell you, this ain't your grandmother's tea party.\n\nThe place is a cozy, yet eclectic corner tea house. Complete with mix matched China, vintage wall hangings, and crochet doilies. The waitresses are all very pleasant and very knowledgeable of the teas, food, and what goes good with what. And while it's a rather noisy establishment, cell phones are not allowed so please take ur loud ass outside when ur T-Pain ringtone goes off.\n\nOK, now for the food. OMG. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. While it's no House of Prime Rib, I can honestly say that I've NEVER left this place still hungry - and I CAN GRUB. Me and Ness usually get \"High Tea for Two,\" and I usually end up finishing whatever she leaves behind. This includes, salad, cole slaw, 2 sandwhiches of our choice (each, so 4 in all), 2 scones, sugar cookies, and 2 bottomless pots of tea. My fave combo is bay shrimp and mayo, and either chicken and asparagus or egg and onion with passion fruit tea. And seriously, the \"devonshire cream,\" aka butter from the Gods is so good on top of a warm scone I'm thinking about stealing it next time. Mind u, they also have savory side dishes like sausage rolls, shepards pie, quiches, and puff pastries filled with things like curried chicken.\n\nLovejoy's Tea Room is the quintessential spot for a bridal/baby shower but any day (especially sunny, warm Sundays!) is a good day for tea!", "author": "Tor E."}

The china rose petal was amazing--light but also unique and flavorful. Its probably my all time favorite tea so far! The darjeeling was ok, I'd probably go with something else next time. You get a generous portion of 2 sandwiches for each person (that's 8 triangles per person!) which I believe is more than other high tea places. I wish we could get more than 2 kinds of different sandwiches given that you actually get 8 pieces, but I understand that it would complicate things in the kitchen. We had the bay shrimp and mayo, salmon and cream cheese, chicken apple walnut and the daily special (can't remember off the top of my head), which were all very very good. The scone was also very good, though I usually like mine a little fluffier. The reason I give it four stars is because they give a lot of greens as filler, which is pretty tasteless. I also wasn't a huge fan of the cabbage salad. I just don't think these 2 things go very well with a tea service, but that's just my opinion. For $20 a person, I'd rather have more tea biscuits or petit fours.\n\nThe tea room is a little bit small/cramped and our table was very tiny. I was a little scared of knocking something over. The same goes for the Lovejoy's tea shop across the street, though the surrounding neighborhood is very cute. Service was very good. The bathroom was very clean and was decorated nicely (lots of mirrors-haha)! Parking can be a little difficult if you come here at a busy time.\n\nOverall, I had a very good experience and I would definitely come back if in the area. However, I do prefer Tyme for Tea in Fremont, which is similar in price, but is a little easier to get to and superior in taste in my opinion.", "author": "Janet N."}

My absolute favorite is the High Tea for Two in which you can add an additional person for $17.99!

My ultimate favorite was the bay shrimp and mayonnaise.\n\nYou can pick 2 kinds of tea (3 teas for three people).  We ordered the Vanilla Roobios, China Rose Petal and Passion Fruit which was by far my favorite.  I must say that they're NOT greedy with their tea.  It comes in a big teapot and the waiters are constantly refilling it.  All you can drink tea!  \n\nAnd omg, their scones!  I never liked them until I tasted Lovejoys' scones.  It comes with the High Tea for Two by the way.  It's warm and soft with raisins mixed in.  Once you spread the preserves and double devon cream, omg...it's ON!!  So delicious!  \n\nThe decor is super cute especially the utensils, teacups, teapots and plates.  As if you were at your grandmother's house.  So girly.  However, it can get a bit squishy when you try to get to your table.  Be careful when you walk between tables.  You might break something!  \n\nThe waiters are very nice.

I made reservations in advance which was pretty easy. I called and had to leave a message. They called me back right away and let me know the time I wanted was not available but let me know when they did have an opening. When we came for tea we were a little late because of traffic and trying to find parking (which wasn't too bad) and wasn't given a hard time about coming late which was nice. I had the queen's tea. The warm scone were awesome and the toasted crumpet was pretty good but the lemon curd was super runny and not really that great. The tea sandwiches were also pretty good. You can tell they were super fresh. Their tea sandwich selection was great... so many tea sandwiches to chose from. You get your choice of any two to go with your tea. I liked being able to pick your own sandwiches. I did not like only getting two choices though. Usually at other tea places I would get four tea sandwiches (one piece of each) plus savory pastries, so the two tea sandwiches (four pieces of each) and no savory pastries to go with, it seemed a little redundant after a while. If I come here again I will be sure to suggest we all get different sandwiches and trade some pieces so we all get some more variety which would solve the problem... though I was a little disappointed that they didn't already have something like that built into the menu. They also served salad and coleslaw with the tea. With the queen's tea I also got a choice of petite four which they had 3 or 4 different flavors or a frosted rice krispy treat. I chose the rice krispy treat which was good. It was nice to get the choice. The tea selection was pretty low... not too much variety. They did keep filling up our tea pots though which kept the tea nice and warm and full! \n\nSpeaking of warm though... that place was so warm and stuffy! It was so uncomfortable. I was sweating, trying to enjoy my warm tea, quickly losing my appetite, feeling dirty and sticky from the runny lemon curd with only one smallish paper napkin to try and wipe up all the sticky lemon curd from my fingers while trying to protect my lap from the same fate as my sticky fingers. Bleh! It wasn't even that hot outside... maybe in the mid 70s outside.\n\nThe service was alright. Not really the pleasant over the top politeness I have come to expect from tea services. Also, toward the end of tea they came up to us with the check and let us know that there will be another party coming to take our table. This has never happened to me before in all my life. Disappointing because I do like to enjoy my tea service leisurely as it should be had. \n\nOverall, I was not too impressed with this place. If I do come back it will definitely be a strictly winter/fall tea stop.", "author": "Christina P."}

Might I also add that there's a rather large price difference; hotel high tea could set you back about $40+ per person, but at Lovejoy's, the most indulgent tea service is a mere $24.95. \n\nThis small tea room is oh so darling, with it's haphazard decor of mismatched tablecloths and grandma's attic tea implements. The service is warm and friendly, with a wonderfully varied menu of good quality teas and yummy sandwiches. The scones were flaky and flavorful, served with Double Devon cream and preserves...just as they should be. The hot chocolate for my girls came out in an adorable little pitcher with whipped cream on the side in a smaller pitcher.

The tea sets are really cute and the tea was good. \n\nHowever, I've been to many tea places and this one rates very low in my book. The  quality of the food is mediocre. The \"scones\" seem to be right out of the box and are in fact biscuit mix not actual scones. The sandwiches are pretty tasteless. My most recent tea place was in the Outer Sunset where they make their own loaves, the quality of the food was top notch and they actually made \"scones\" from scratches. Lovejoy is solely relying on their reputation from loyal customers but the quality lacks behind what they serve. Not worth the price at all.", "author": "Flo A."}

My girlfriend from high school was visiting from out of town and we had been talking about having high tea.  After much searching and disappointment that The Four Seasons Hotels and the Ritz-Carlton Hotels have discontinued their tea service, we found this place on Yelp.\n\nWe were half an hour late (boyfriends are slow) but lucky one person in our party was only 5 minutes late and saved the table for us.  She said they were very nice and didn't harass her about the rest of her party not showing up.\n\nI had the Queen's Tea with English Breakfast tea and cucumber and turkey sandwiches.  The tea arrived first and after waiting anxiously for it to seep, I poured myself a cup.  It was delicious, but I am not a tea connoisseur.  Then arrived the food, on a three tiered platter.  The top tier was the fresh fruit, next the scone, biscuit, jam, lemon stuff, and the devon cream, the bottom tier had the sandwiches, cole slaw, and greens.\n\nTo be frank, when I first looked at it I thought they kind of skimped out on the fruit, but I was stuffed by the end of my meal, so really they are smarter than me!\n\nAfter having some fruit, I decided to try the scone.  I first tried the devon cream...and that is when I realized that I loved this place!  If I had a lover, forget the whipped cream or chocolate sauce, this is what I'd cover his body with and lick off!!!  I could not get enough of it and I think this was my favorite item here.  Of course the jam and lemon stuff was good too, but I cannot describe my devotion to devon cream now.\n\nThe sandwiches were of course delicious and...dainty, delicate?  FUN!  I am not a super girlie girl.  My friend and I decided to put dresses on for the special occasion and I felt like a streetwalker even though my dress is conservative, but that is how rarely I wear things that don't have legs.  But this place played into my feminine side without me feeling awkward about it.  So yes, it's frilly and kitsch, but it works for this place.\n\nA little while later came my fresh crumpet.  We decided crumpets are a pancake-english muffin hybrid, a puffin. Delicious, but I just wanted to get back to my scone and devon cream to be honest.\n\nLastly when we were done, we had our petite fours.  Which apparently I didn't really experience because I got the dark chocolate truffle with dried apricot.  But it was so cute and I love dark chocolate.  Petite fours are candy-sized, individually glazed pieces of cake. (My friend went to culinary school)\n\nI completely want to return, but will probably only get the High Tea or even just the Light Tea next time.  The Queen's Tea was fantastic for the first time, so you get the entire experience and learn what you like.  But I personally didn't really like the cole slaw (I'm too American and eating it made me want ribs or something) and I was too full to even consider wasting space on a salad!\n\nSo if you go, invite me?", "author": "Monique H."}

And the scones, the scones were just so yummy.  They were not dry like many scones you taste, but warm (even after they had been sitting on our table for a while) and much more moist than many others.  Plus the strawberry jam made the scone even better!  The crumpets were also quite tasty but the lemon curd really made the crumpet amazing.

The place is decked out in girly-ness.  It's weird when you see a man inside because there are so few.  It's a lot smaller and cozier than I thought it would be, but if you are with your best friends then it allows for a more intimate tea party!  \n\nWe opted against ordering a tea sets since there were so many of us, and just ordered a bottomless pot of Earl Grey ($8) with each additional person being $1 more.  Then we ordered a lot of food a la carte.  There is a 9.95 minimum per person so we were forced to order more food than we could actually finish, believe it or not.  We came here starving and left incredibly sated.\n\nThe scones are amazing.  Warm and soft, combined with the clotted cream and strawberry jam... mmm... Surprisingly easy to break up into pieces so you shouldn't eat an entire one by yourself or you'll have no room for other food.  I was really heartbroken to see jars and jars of Smuckers jam in their storage pantry while waiting in line for the bathroom.  \n\nThe crumpets are so-so, save for the lemon curd.  \n\nOrdered a large plate of sandwiches, which allowed us to get 3 sandwiches, quartered.  We ordered 1. bay shrimp and mayo, 2. salmon mousse, 3. pear and stilton.  I only tried the last two, but they were both yummy.  The pear and stilton was very unique, as was the salmon mousse.  Sandwiches are served on a bed of greens, cool.  Also came with coleslaw which was surprisingly good.\n\nWe got a chicken curry pasti (pronounced the A as in PASTA not PASTE) which was AMAZING!  Didn't even need the dipping sauce.  The shell was flaky and hot, the inside was flavorful and fragrant.  So great.  \n\nTo get to our 9.95 minimum we ordered the Beef Pasti which was definitely not as good as the chicken one.  \n\nWe also got an order of the sausage rolls, which are ridiculously hard to cut in halves.  Interesting taste, but would not recommend it.  \n\nSince it was my birthday I got a petite four that was banana-flavored.  It was really cute and thoughtful but less tasty.  They come around with a platter of petite fours for $2.50 each.  We thought they were just giving us all petite fours for free -_- \n\nAll in all, Lovejoy's was everything I wanted it to be.

Holy hell this place is delicious.  Not only did we go that one time, we've been back a bunch of times, and have even been inspired to try other tea places in the city.

(The \"For Two\" version is basically two high teas packaged together at a slight discount).  The High Tea comes with (in order of best to worst):\n1: Bottomless pot of one type of tea.\n2: Warm scone.\n3: Two sandwiches.\n4: Sugar cookie.\n5: Salad.\n6: Cole slaw.\n\nDouble that for the High Tea For Two, meaning you get four sandwiches total.  There are a lot of variety of teas, from standard stuff like English Breakfast to more unique teas like Passion Fruit.  (I stick with the green teas myself).  The scone is delicious, especially once you spread the accompanying cream and jelly on it.  There are some great sandwich options, too.  My favorites are apple and cream cheese, shrimp and mayo, mandarin orange and cream cheese, and egg salad.\n\nThe place is slightly pricey, but you'll come out so incredibly full of good food that it's totally worth it as an \"every one in a while\" place.

We each got to order two sandwiches, a scone, a cookie, salad, and cole slaw. I got the chicken apple and walnut salad sandwich and the horse-radish and roast beef sandwich.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-03-09", "description": "This review is somewhat late in coming, but it's one of the few places that I can remember months after visiting.\n\nWe were up in the Bay Area on a roadtrip and Lovejoy's came highly recommended by J's S.F. friend. Now, food-wise I'm as manly as they come, but even I can't say 'no' to a tower of food along with an accompanying pinch of civilization.\n\nBeing from L.A., I know about the horrible, nearly nonexistent street parking of S.F. and this place didn't disappoint. However, persistence paid off and I found a space across from their storefront.\n\nLocated in Noe Valley, along MUNI's J Line on Church Street (alas, there's no station nearby) Lovejoy's fits right in; quaint, old-world charm with a healthy dose of Victorian kitzch. It's sort of like being transported back in time; a doily-friendly lunching space with curtains, lamps, and other knick-knacks compelling you to sit down on a couch or table and have a cup of tea. \n\nAnd a scone. \n\nWith clotted cream.\n\nAnd some finger sandwiches. \n\nOr two...\n\nAnd a petit four. \n\nAnd... and...\n\nWe opted for sharing a Queen's Tea, the name of which felt like a challenge to my masculinity, but I gotta say that both of us were stuffed afterwards. One highlight of the visit were the freshly made crumpets. I always wondered what exactly crumpets were, but they arrived hot and buttery and reminded me of a really yummy un-split english muffin.\n\nThis place also features some lunch items on the menu so if tea's not exactly your thing, you're okay. Our friend mentioned a shepherd's pie, which thankfully, we didn't order.  \n\nThe thing I like about afternoon tea is the sense of civilization it imparts to the senses, similar to a kaiseki meal or a cocktail hour with aperitifs, clinking ice, and tony cocktail glasses. I might also mention that the prices are also on the civilized side. I've never found afternoon tea to be a bargain outing and Lovejoy's is no exception, yet I've never come across a place as charmingly quaint as Lovejoy's. \n\nIt's most definitely a place to relax and take your time; savoring the experience in a cozy atmosphere. It's an experience I'd definitely recommend.\n\nHell, even I caught myself sticking out my pinky finger once or twice.", "author": "Ken W."}

I made a reservation, and as soon as she landed, we took the J-church down here without incident, and the place was pretty easy to find.\n\nThey reserved us a seat on the couch, which was a cute place to sit (albeit a little bad for sitting up straight to eat), so that was nice of them. The menu is a little overwhelming with a bajillion choices, but I ended up ordering the Savory Tea, which included bottomless tea (I picked Vanilla Rooibos) and two sandwiches (I picked shrimp and mayo and smoked turkey and dijon mustard). My friend got the Cream Tea with Apricot Tea. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the sandwiches were tasty. I just didn't get very many of them, which, admittedly, is the point of tea. I should have gotten the Cream Tea, because my friend's scones were pretty filling and tasty, and I actually ended up wanting fruit after having my tea. So it was a case of ordering the wrong thing, which isn't necessarily something I would penalize Lovejoy's for. \n\nAfter getting pretty full off tea, I needed a bathroom break. So I walked into the back, and caught a glimpse of the kitchen where I saw a loaf of bread sitting on the counter. And that was when everything was shattered. It wasn't like, nice white bread. It was Safeway white bread. The kind you can pick up at any Safeway for about $2 a loaf. And then when I thought about it, it wasn't worth it. The sandwiches were good, but they weren't $15 for 8 small triangles good (including unlimited tea). I could have gone to Safeway and made my own delicious shrimp/mayo, turkey/mustard sandwiches. And the ambiance was good, but I couldn't shake the feeling of being made very well aware that I was out of place, that I didn't belong here. The servers were nice enough, but I felt like unless you were pretty acquainted with ordering tea, you would feel kind of uncomfortable ordering and asking questions.\n\nAnd after that, nothing was the same. It's like that loaf of Safeway white bread broke the illusion, and I was able to see this place for what it was. And I wasn't that impressed, and will probably never come back unless I have a friend who is REALLY into tea. Otherwise, it's just too far and too awkward for me to venture out here.", "author": "Angeline P."}

Lovejoy's is like having tea with your kooky Great Aunt Beatrice. Mismatched floral cups and pots, three-tiered serving trays, and lace. Lots of lace. I went with my mom and sister for my sister's twentieth birthday. We walked in, passed a group of six-year-old girls celebrating a birthday, and got to our seats. The only men in the joint were beaming fathers of six-year-olds, grandfathers, and defeated looking boyfriends and brothers. There was a lot of estrogen.\n\nOur waitress was very sweet, gave suggestions, described teas. We settled on \"high tea,\" all the tea you can drink for $17 per person, plus two sandwiches, a scone, a cookie, some salad and a bit of cole slaw per person. I did not want to like this place. But when the tea arrived, it was perfect. The Irish Breakfast was strong and piping hot, deep and refreshing. The green was herbaceous and nourishing, and the apricot tea was...apricotty?\n\nThe scones were bliss-inducing, wonderfully warm pillows of fluff. Not the flaky bricks one usually encounters, these were described as \"Irish style,\" if that means anything to you. The sandwiches were wonderfully fancy versions of the dainty crustless numbers moms make for their daughters. Pear and stilton, salmon and capers, chicken salad, shrimp. Delicate, airy little tastes.\n\nBut what really makes this place fun is the service. Tables are labeled \"reserved for royalty\" or \"reserved for the queen,\" and the waitresses treat you as such, really doing their best to make your experience enjoyable.\n\nI think I may come back for the impressive selection of pub food on the menu!\n\nOh, and it is easily walkable from 24th st BART!", "author": "Michael W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-23", "description": "Honestly, I wanted to give Lovejoy's Tea Room a higher score.  I mean, it's a British tea place.  You don't find this sort of place in the Bay Area. (Yes, you see plenty of milk tea and Thai tea places, but not British tea places.) It's that the place has a good amount of glaring flaws.  It has 3 stars, but the place is really A-OK indeed.  Side note: one of my sisters brought my siblings and I over to this place for her birthday, my only visit to this place.\n\nAs I mentioned in the last paragraph, this is a British tea place.  Obviously, the place has the British look when you go inside.  Oh and of course, this is definitely a place ladies generally should feel at ease.\n\nWhat was good about the place?  I like the surroundings.  The server we had was wonderful.  The staff members as a whole were wonderful I should say.  Of course, the tea would be good. (This is a tea place after all.) You are given your milk and sugar.  Oh and it is awesome that they carry jade tea, but even if your not much of a tea person, there are other drinks to choose from like coffee and hot chocolate. (Side note: for tea and coffee, I need milk and sugar, but I never put either in jade tea.)\n\nNow, I bring out the flaws.  The place is pricey, but it's San Francisco, and adding on, I'll mention a more horrid flaw regarding money in a bit.  I know that this a tea place, but the food was lackluster.  Outside of the scones, a good amount of the food was mediocre at best.  The place is so small, I wonder how someone like Mr. Corey Maggette would manage to feel comfortable without a chair.  Parking is such a bother, but again, it's San Francisco.  I better mention now that the more horrid flaw regarding money (which I checked out just recently) is that each person must spend a little under $10 meaning that for example, if you're just by yourself, you can't just get a crumpet and milk and be good to go because you just spent $7.37 only before the tip.  Even if you add the tip, you're still under the minimum, as that's only $8.48.\n\nI need to get a couple of notes out of the way.  Obviously, if you plan on coming here, make a reservation ahead of time.  Also, you can purchase the cups and other items.  Just go to the store across the street.\n\nI love the atmosphere.  I love the service we received.  I don't love the lackluster food and the money issues.  Lovejoy's is a place I don't mind going to again for tea with crumpets and biscuits.  I just hope the flaws I mentioned are fixed up.\n\n+:  The service is terrific and Lovejoy's Tea Room gets originality points for being a British tea place, a type of place you will not see often in the Bay Area or probably out west for that matter.\n\n-:  The food is seriously lackluster overall and you figure that you get a little more out of each dollar spent.", "author": "Don U."}

During a conversation at a party, friends asked if we've tried Lovejoy's - where?  Boy, are we thankful for the tips!\n\nThis is what tea should be - cozy, comfortable and non-pretentious like some other places.  We sat at the corner and settled into the comfy settee.  We like all the standard fare, no flavored tea for us - just the good old English Breakfast w/ sugar and milk.  The tea cozy is homey but it sure helps the keep the tea hot/warm!  Can't even describe the quaintness of this place and how charming it is...  We loved looking around and just about everything is for sale here!\n\nWe really enjoyed the tea sandwiches.  The bread was very soft and not \"squished\" from when they cut off the crumb.  High Tea for Two allowed us choice of 4 sandwiches and we enjoyed each one:\n\nCucumber & Cream Cheese - refreshing and light\nRoast Beef & Horseradish - to satisfy hubby's neat for meat and the horseradish has a nice kick to it\nSmoked Salmon & Cream Cheese Chutney & Cheese - flavorful\nHam & English Mustard - tasty\n\nThis is more enjoyable than Ritz, even the tea and sandwiches were better.

Everything -- from the furniture to the ensembles of the waitresses, is Victorian. The place has an old feel to it. It's extremely girly, so I wouldn't recommend bringing the boys here. Make a reservation for the girls. This would be an awesome \"girls day out\" place to visit.\n\nI will admit, at first glance, I didn't believe anything on the menu would fill me up. However, each item was so rich with fresh flavor and I was actually stuffed by our meal's end. A downfall -- the prices. I didn't expect tea and sandwiches to be that expensive. The way I see it is, I paid for the experience of trying something new in a great environment, where they definitely pay attention to detail and where high attentive and personable.\n\nIf it's just you and another person, order the High Tea for Two. You get to choose several different sandwiches, spring greens, scones, shortbread, biscuits, crumpets, and spreads. I loved the cucumber and cream cheese and apple walnut salad. I literally moaned when I put the crumpet topped with Devonshire cream in my mouth. It just melted...I loved that combination so much, that I went to their retail store across the street to purchase a jar.

It's like playing tea with the girls... only that now we are allowed to handle hot liqids! \n\n I have an odd food allergy and the owner (Muna) was very attentive and sat down on my couch that was reserved for Queens! :) She listed every ingredient and let me know what I could have. She also sold my friends and I into these wonderful sandwiches that we would have never have tried, but she is so knowledgeable and she was able to let us know that due to our like of other similar cheeses, we would be happy with this choice. \n\nThe tea selections are the best. You can try Green teas, Herbal Teas, you name it. And they can even suggest what would go best with your food selection. It is like having fine wine! \n\nAnd then there are the scones...

They do sell them separately if you must take some with you or want extras with your order. \n\nMy only wish for this place (and I am not going to take stars away for this... because after all... it just means the business is doing well and they should not be punished for that!) is that it would be easier to get in.

Lovejoy's is an outstanding and authentic experience. If you like British-style tea (which is obviously a meal, not just the tea), then this is it. More than the best in the city, the best I've had outside the UK. If you don't like traditional British tea, there are no concessions to American taste here. The complaints on yelp reflect a lack of familiarity with this tradition, in my opinion.\nThe ambience is a bit over-the-top Anglophilic, feminine, and precious- just go with it! The tea is excellent and perfectly prepared. The sandwiches are tiny, crustless, and delicious- my favorites include the ham and (spicy) English mustard, egg and onion, and, of course, cucumber. The scones, which were fine, are now excellent- they started with a new backer relatively recently. I never have room for the petit fours, but the two times (out of zillions of visits) that I've had them, they have been delicious. I also recently ordered catering from them, and it is really easy and very reasonable. I have 1 complaint- too hard to get a reservation!", "author": "SF Soccer Mom S."}

You strain the brewed tea into the pot. The Ritz Carlton and other (more expensive but infinitely better) places know this. \n\nYou also use enough tea. And if you don't, you definitely do not \"top off\" the pot, especially without asking first. \n\nWhat an annoying hostess! She came to our table EIGHT times in the 50 minutes we were there to pester us about her \"bottomless pot.\" I've never experienced so much fuss (and debate!) resulting in so little quality. \n\nI stopped her from topping off a pot that was already too weak, and thereafter had her question and debate my every reply. \n\nIt was also unsanitary: Some pots and cups were so chipped, with the underlying clay so blackened, they were serious bacteria sources. Also unsafe: The mismatching is taken too far, with lids falling off and such.\n\nAnd apparently you're supposed to figure out that the 2nd mismatched saucer under your cup is the only plate you'll get to eat off. Try eating salad greens with dressing off a 4 inch saucer, and then having to use those same 4 inches to cut and butter your scone.\n\nFinally, as many others point out, the tablecloths are overly worn and the seating uncomfortable and overcrowded.

The brutish woman came over and scolded this poor girl in front of us - \"you can't just give cake plates out. we charge for that!\" Then the brutish woman gave us the explanation - \"i'm sorry, she is new and should have told you we have a cake cutting fee...\" blah blah...Then the woman took her aside behind that curtain with the food and I can see and hear that woman continue to yell at that poor girl! So unprofessional! First of all, I felt awful this girl was getting yelled at. We should have told that woman in the first place that we had a cake.

It was not at all what I was expecting, completely informal and more like a trip to Grandma's house than tea on the lawn with the queen. Being part of a generation the UK so quaintly labeled 'Generation-X', I feel that such age old traditions have somewhat passed us by (not that kids in the 60's or 70's particularly practiced large amounts of earl grey consumption - but I am sure they knew what 'high tea' was). And as with anyone born in the early 1980's, I would imagine that unless you are from British royalty the chances are you didn't either. Ok moving on...\n\nThe tea and sandwiches are the up-most of British tradition (apparently) including white bread with the crusts cut off (I knew so many boys that would insist on that in junior school) a real porcelain pot of tea (sugar provided but not essential) and scones and jam for dessert (but obviously scoffing down prior to tea is allowed too - or instead of).\n\nDefinitely somewhere worthy of treating someone special too, the place is both unique and eye catching.

I've set my pinstripe suit and high heels and modern style on the shelf for the luxurious, melting, home-like atmosphere of Lovejoy's. \n\nWhether you're a party of 2 or 12 (I've been in both), I highly recommend reservations. That said, splurge on the high tea. The sandwiches are all tasty (I won't go into them here, just read all the previous gazillion reviews), the scones and cakes are lovely, the jams are fruity and sweet, and the cream...speaks for itself. Any tea you select will be steeped properly before it's served, so patience, dearies. Also, they have a lovely shop that's worth your perusal, and I always end up with a few little sachets of my favorites. Try the vanilla roobois. You'll thank me later ;)", "author": "Krisztina F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-17", "description": "My friend and I both enjoyed our time at Lovejoy's Tea Room the other day. I loved the atmosphere of the place. The decorations that adorn the walls and the mismatched cups and saucers gives Lovejoy's a quirky and rustic atmosphere. I had this perception that tea service would be all proper and formal, but at Lovejoy's it was really relaxing. All the tables were quite close, but I still could have a nice conversation without having to shout at each other.\n\nWe got the high tea for two, which includes shortbread cookies, scones, salads, sandwiches and two kinds of tea. As both of us were tea novices, our helpful waitress recommended Tea Room Blend and China Rose Petal. Both were really yummy, with the tea room blend being a little heavier and more bitter, and china rose petal as really fragrant yet light. Our waitress would reheat and refill our tea as well, which was very nice. As for the food, before it arrived, I was a little concerned that I'd still be left hungry. Fortunately, I didn't have to worry about that at all, mainly because of their scones, which were really filling. The raisin topped scones came out warm, and while they were flaky and a little dry, adding the devon cream and jam more than made up for that. It was really delicious and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a scone that much before. The salad was fresh. I got the smoked salmon and cheese and the bay shrimp and mayo sandwiches. Both were nice, but I preferred the smoked salmon and cheese. The salmon and cheese really went well together. Ended with the shortbread cookies, which were nothing special, but good enough. The scone and the teas were the highlights though!\n\nI would definitely make a reservation if I wasn't coming in early. We went right when it opened at around 11 without reservations and we got a table easily, but we saw about half the tables already reserved for later. And when we were about to leave the room was packed and there were a couple people waiting outside. Also there is a two hour time limit, but we never felt rushed. I probably wouldn't come regularly since the prices are a bit high, but I'd definitely return for a special occasion or if I wanted to do something different with my girl friends or mom.", "author": "Amanda K."}

Strawberries, blueberries, pineapples, scones - you name it, I spread cream on it.  And yes, they sell this stuff, too - don't even bother looking at the nutritional value (I use the word \"value\" lightly).\n\nThe tea service was prompt and lovely and everything was described to us as they were served.  We had a relatively spacious layout in the back of the bustling tearoom, but it all felt very cozy.\n\nCustomer service was extremely personable, professional and warm.  The minute I walked in/out, I was making making a mental list of others with whom I would love to experience Lovejoy's again.  Very old school, English tea vibe with a quaint \"attic\" just across the street where they sell many of their wares and teas.\n\nI think this statement from their website sums it up rather well: \"...our tea room reflects the diversity of San Francisco, blending together the traditions of tea service with an eclectic, quirky and playful spirit.\"", "author": "Olma M."}

I expected my Ploughman's Lunch (a selection of toast points, cheese, chutney, hummus, fruit, greens, and chips) to include only tiny portions of each item, but I was actually stuffed and unable to finish everything, in the end.

At the end of the meal, the server approached us with a tray of petit-fours and asked us if we'd like one.  Since this was our first visit and we wanted to experience everything, we agreed.  Little did we know that the tiny little cake that I found to be so-so wasn't complimentary like we imagined, but was $5 charge PER PERSON on our bill! You have to be kidding me guys. Firstly, it was all of 1in x 1in. If any money at all, the most it should have been was $1.50.  Secondly when you approach someone and you are going to charge them, one of the following should be said \"would you care to purchase a petit-four?\" or \"would you care to add a petit-four?\" or \"would you care to order a petit-four?\" NOT \"would you like a petit-four?\"  That just makes it sound like it was part of the meal or free.\n\nThis may sound silly and juvenile, but we were both laid off over a year ago and this was a much saved for celebration (her birthday).

It gets a little stuffy inside!  But sweating is part of the experience here at Lovejoy's!  \n\nTip#2: Have plans right after tea?  Cancel them.  They don't rush you here, so just relish in the environment and enjoy every minute.  Trust me.  You won't want to leave.  Drink as much tea as humanly possible.  \n\nTip#3: Need a present for your mother, girlfriend, best friend that's a girl, niece, daughter, goddaughter, co-worker, etc.?  Get them a Lovejoy's gift certificate for a party of two and package with some goodies from the Attic across the street.  Trust me.

However, it's also a drawback since that means there are no seasonal offerings to peruse.  With the volume of people it serves, it's a wonder that Lovejoy's is still able to retain some of the homemade charms that you would find in a less popular tea room.

We ordered High Tea for Two.  I was a little worried that even though it *sounds* like a lot of food, the portions would be dainty.  Not at all!  We're both champion eaters, and this was enough to fill us up.  \n\nI was absolutely in love with the Artichoke-Hummus sandwich, but we were both enamored by the Pear & Stilton sandwich.  The scones were so wonderful (the boyfriend prefers the American version of scones to these, the British kind, but I thought they were great).  The devonshire cream and strawberry preserves you can put on the sweet stuff is phenomenal, too.  The boy couldn't turn down buying an orange-chocolate petit four from the tray that was brought around by the owner.  That was also good.  :)  We had the Tea Room Blend-tea as well as Blood Orange tea.  Both were excellent (particularly the Blood Orange, which was surprising in its deliciousness).\n\nBeyond the food, though, the atmosphere is above reproach.  It was so cozy, calm, friendly and just....happy.  I felt so at home here, and I've never been too much of a girly-girl.  The waitstaff was beyond attentive, but not at *all* obtrusive.  There were several tables full of people, but they still noticed when you needed a clean plate for your scone.  Our waitress complimented our sandwich choices.  I'm sure they do that all the time, but it was a lovely touch because it *seemed* genuine, even if it wasn't.  \n\nI truly wish that this place existed in Madison.  I would go as often as I could!

Maybe it's really hard to get here, but this was clearly not the real, delicious, super-rich, mccoy, and instead had that distinct UHT long-life flavor to it.

Place opens at 11 and already a full house. Luckily, I reserved a table way in advance for my party and got the best seats in the house next to the lovely window. it was a nice set up. Lovejoy definitely had alot of attention to details which included cute plates and cups. My friend and I even flip the plates over to see where they bought them from (Japan and England). I docked one star for being too squishy. You almost feel like you're walking on eggshells in that place hoping not to knock something or someone over because it's so tight.  We ordered 5 \"high tea for 2\" meal sets which came with 5 different choices of tea and 2 sandwiches per person. The sandwiches fill us all up good and scones came after which really put me in a food coma.

All I can say is the food and tea were amazing! The tea for 3 came with 6 selections of different sandwiches, (3 mini sandwiches of each type), salad with a horseradish balsamic vinegar dressing, Cole slaw, 3 cookies, 3 HUGE scones and 3 pots of tea.\nThe tea was bottomless; I had the mango tea which was very fruity and tropical. I also tried the passion fruit tea and the chamomile tea which were also very good. They are all loose leaf teas so they gave us a strainer to put on top of our cups when we poured our tea. \nWe had the smoked salmon with cream cheese, bay shrimp with mayo, roast beef with horseradish, egg with onion, turkey with cranberry, and a walnut with chicken and apple sandwiches. My personal favorites out of all of them were the smoked salmon and the bay shrimp. =)\nThe service was great, they kept filling our teapots with water and constantly asked if everything was ok. The only downside when you drink like 10 cups of tea was the bathroom issue. There is only one bathroom with one toilet. The line was long and I had to wait impatiently for the bathroom since I really had to go. \nThe bill came out to be about 22 a person and I would definitely come back", "author": "Shirley W."}

The cuteness of the place, the outfits the servers wear...all that was just right, as you'd expect it to be. And, it didn't feel like a chain - more like someone's creative idea for a restaurant. They could even go more British...play some Henry Purcell in the background or something. Have pictures of the horse races.\n\nAnyway, the thing to get here is the cream tea, or the tea with scones. The scones are good. My wife got the high tea, which comes with sandwiches. They were fine, but nothing particularly great. Right, it was probably Safeway bread, not some freshly baked bread. \n\nThe tea is good quality. Perhaps not insane quality, but good quality.\n\nI had the Stilton and pear salad, which was very good. I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but perfectly good for the moment. I suppose you'd never waste a really top-notch Stilton this way, but for the salad, the cheese tasted good.\n\nAll in all, a fun thing to do, and we'll hope to come back.", "author": "Mister K."}

Me and my good friend stopped in for lunch the other day and had such a pleasant experience. Let me first state that when you walk into this restaurant you feel like you're sitting in the middle of a London cafe. Although I have never been to London, I imagine it to be exactly this way. The decor was so fun! It's more of an afternoon spot you go with some girlfriends...not really a date spot. \nThe tea was very tasty. You get so many options to choose from!!! the best part is that they keep refilling your kettle and each person get's their own!\nTheir sandwiches are delicious. Small, yet very flavorful! Again so many delicious choices, you really can't go wrong. However I must say that their scones were to die for. As I put the first bite in my mouth I think I literally died for a second. It was heaven. They were warm and oh so buttery. They bring out the scones with their own special butter and jam which takes it to a whole other level. \nOverall my experience here was awesome.

We had a large group and were able to sit there as long as we wanted. Serving staff was really nice to us.\n\nI don't think I would go there again soon - for two of us, we spent 55 dollars and we had tea, two small sandwiches, a scone, some mixed greens (the kind that you would buy at Safeway in a plastic bin), some coleslaw, and a crumpet. For our large group of eight, we spent $225 altogether. For the money spent, even though yes the ingredients overall were nice, it just is a very extravagant lunch where you leave feeling waterlogged on tea but not necessarily full full. Not that you have to feel like you should unbutton your pants and roll out the door, it just feels like a lot of money for tea and white bread sandwiches. But if you go there feeling hungry, you need to drop 30-35 to leave feeling satisfied - otherwise, you will find yourself eating like a whole tub of jam, butter, and cream.\n\nHowever, the things I did like were the devon double cream and the lemon curd. The coleslaw was good - they had caraway seeds in them - not too sweet.\n\nAgain, for the money, we got as much tea as we wanted, but we each received a knife, spoon, and fork, with no serving utensils for anything. They put the greens and the coleslaw (plus the sandwiches, etc) on these big tier trays but they don't have serving utensils. So you just use your fingers or try to use your one spoon that you use to stir your tea to scoop greens onto your plate. It just ended up a bit germy and messy. I was using my knife I had just slathered with cream and jam, etc and then had to use it as a serving utensil for the coleslaw, etc. They didn't refresh plates, so if you had used your one small plate to eat salad, you also had to use it to serve your sweet stuff and it all got mixed together. By the end, it was pretty gross.\n\nAlso, they use these thin textured square napkins (the kind we grew up on when we had people over) for their hand towels in the bathroom. They don't work so well...get bits of paper falling off - almost like drying your hands with toilet paper. But that's being a little picky.", "author": "P B."}

The shrimp, cucumber, and fig sandwiches are also good.  The homemade scones are amazing - light and buttery, melt in your mouth, smeared with clotted cream and jam.  Yum.\n\nNice selection of teas, and I like the different \"levels\" of tea you can get based on how hungry you are - if you just want a tea and scone, you can get that.  If you're a little hungrier but don't want to spoil dinner, go for the Light Tea which is a scone + 1 sandwich + fruit + shortbread.

The decorations remind me of the old lady across the street's house that smelled of dust and strong perfume.

I didn't try them myself, but I've been told that the hats in the parlor are available to borrow for the patrons during their tea-time.\n\nAnyways, skeptical of the entire menu, I let the gf order whatever. I added a meat pie to make myself feel like I was going to eat something substantial. We settled on a tower of assorted tea sandwiches and scones with English breakfast tea and something else.\n\nThe tea was actually quite tasty.

Considering there were 13 of us, the service was prompt and definitely on point and we never had to ask for a HOT pot of tea as they were constantly topping off our pots.  What a concept!\n\nSince that first experience, I've been here numerous times and I never get tired of it.  The mismatched furniture, dishes, tea cups and teapots... the lace and doilies... the variety of sandwiches... the salad... the coleslaw... the SCONES with double devon cream and jam... the shortbread cookies... and of course, the bottomless pots of hot tea.  Heavenly!\n\nMy favorite is the High Tea, which comes with all that I mentioned above.  I've had the Queen's Tea but frankly, I don't care for the fruit or the crumpets and if you change your mind and want a petit four, it can be added on for an additional $2.50.  I highly recommend the Vanilla Rooibos tea - my absolute favorite and I actually don't even ask for anything else anymore.  \n\nAlthough it may not sound like it, you will get full off of what appears to be a petite meal.  The best part is that it's not that greasy, gross full but a satisfactory full.  You will definitely want to call in advance to make reservations.  They do have some open seating but it's first come first served and it fills up quick.  Be sure to plan to spend at least 1 1/2-2 hours - the service is not slow but you'll find yourself taking your time to savor the tea and food and enjoy the company you're with.  \n\nHave I mentioned how much I adore this place?!", "author": "Raquel U."}

I was afraid we'd be turned away at the door for being late, but actually we were seated but had to wait at least 10 minutes before our server paid any attention to us. Another plus: we actually sat for about 2 hours even though I saw them ask a table of two to leave bc they \"had other people waiting.\" On to the food part:\n\nOf course, everything was cute and dainty and the only thing old lady-ish about the place was the musty/stuffy air that afternoon. Our party was delighted by the High Tea for Two. Scones smothered with cream and preserves were the group's favorite, but we were also pretty satisfied with the sandwiches, especially the fig and olive tapenade. \n\nOverall, it's a great place to meet up or celebrate a special occasion, although it is a very female dominated atmosphere.

We had 11 people and everyone enjoyed their experience, even the guys! They were extremely accommodating, and were really nice and patient to me and my friends even though we were sometimes embarrassingly a little too loud. My party had a little corner of the tea room to ourselves, where they set up a cute little row of sofas and chairs for us to sit at and enjoy our tea. The tea room was decorated shabby chic, and all the tea ware you are served with are mismatched yet adorable; but that adds to the shabby chic vibe!  The teas were phenomenal, I've never had such delicious and fragrant tasting teas in my life! My favorite teas that we sampled that day were the Ginseng tea and Vanilla Rooibos. The food was good, I REALLY recommend everyone order at least one scone for themselves, you might end up ordering more because they are the best things I have ever put in my mouth! They are ridiculously buttery and delicious, I tried to savor my scone as much as I could since it was so good. The sandwiches were pretty good, but not as good as I thought from reading other previous reviews. We ordered the horseradish sandwich with beef (?), I wasn't able to sample it since I don't eat red meat but it was a no go for all of my friends. The curry sandwich was a little overpowering for us. The standouts among the sandwiches were the chicken artichoke & LoveJoy's special. The citrus salad was refreshing and tasty.  What really made my time at LoveJoy's special was at the end of our tea session, the staff came out with a petit four with a little candle on it, which was like a mini personal cake to me! They also gifted me a cute little faux diamond encrusted tiara. Love that extra touch, it really made my birthday at LoveJoy's a special and great experience.

The last few years we've stayed local and gone to Lovejoy's.  The prices are much more affordable than downtown (about half that of Neiman's.)  The food is also fresher and more abundant.  Service is wonderful and accomodating.  The only reason I did not give five stars is that sometimes the seating is cramped/uncomfortable.  Today we were seated three across on a very soft, squishy couch -- kinda impractical to drink tea and eat scones on.  Aside from that, we love Lovejoy's!\np.s.

Even in the summer, the city weather is cool enough to enjoy a lovely afternoon tea.  We loved exploring another part of the city by coming to Noe Valley.  We did not order the pettifores and our tiered tea plate looked small for the price but it turned out to be more than enough and nicely made.  The servers helped us to select teas and sandwiches that we would enjoy and their recommendations were valuable and appreciated.  We took a short drive to see the street art at Balmy and I recommend this as a part of the afternoon city experience.  The owner of Lovejoy's helped us to find our way to our next destination, very accommodating to \"tourists.\"  We did not make a reservation and were asked to give up our table at the end of an hour and a half.

Ok, so Lovejoys has far more doilies than a man should volunteer to be around, but the Queen's tea is outstanding enough to get me to turn in my man-card for an afternoon of finger sandwiches every time.  \n\nMen this is how it works when you get the Queen's tea (my recommendation).  First, you get an endless pot of tea (which means I drink several pots without realizing it and spend the rest of the day peeing) and choice of a pair of finger sandwich flavors.   I like egg and onion and pear and gorgonzola the best, but I've had almost every flavor and they are great (although the shrimp one is a bit cat-foody).  The sandwiches come cut in little triangles, but you get a bunch of them so it's satisfying and delicious.  This is all served on a three tiered silver platter/tower, in which the top tier is covered in fruits and the second tier is where the real goodness hides.  Tier two has the warm scones (soft, hot and with raisins) on which you have the option of spreading clotted cream (think super-thick whipped cream), lemon curd (FANTASTIC), and/or fresh berry preserves (highly recommended to combine with the clotted cream).  There are also shortbread cookies in case your heart needed more butter and sugar.  The sandwiches are on their three, along with salad greens and some dressing.  \n\nWhile you scarf up this bounty, over extend your bladder, and whittle away at your manhood, the waitstaff will come by to give you warm crumpets.  Crumpets serve as another vessel for the toppings on tier two.  At this point in your meal when you should be wrestling with, \"I'm a man, I had high tea, I'm full, I think like being fancy... this is so confusing,\" the waitstaff will come out with petit-fours as a knockout blow.  Think bite sized cake.\n\nTo survive Lovejoys use my trick to maintaining the illusion of masculinity: take the women in your life here to celebrate their live events / hollidays.  They will love it, you get to eat the goodness and you can tell your buddies you were forced to go because it was your wife's birthday, because your sister had a wedding shower, etc.  Little will they know that you've turned into a fancy boy just like me.  \n\np.s. If you are going here, always have a reservation.", "author": "Aaron M."}

Ok, no biggie I figured it would be more fun to do at home anyway. Just imagine how thrilled I was to learn they would do a take out order. So I called. \n\nThe person in charge of catering calls me back leaves a 10 minute message on my voicemail telling me to email her the specifics and she would get back to me. Great, in theory...love email but for things like this I prefer to talk through the ideas with someone on the phone. I find that a 5 minute conversation is much more efficient than 10 emails back and forth especially if the customer is not sure what they want. \n\nSo I call instead. I give her the benefit of the doubt she must have been busy, but then don't take the call. She made it seem like a major imposition to speak with a potentially good customer, I was most likely going to spend quite a bit there.\n\nI was treated so rudely I will NEVER step foot in Lovejoy's again nor will I EVER recommend anyone call them about catering.

This decor is cute, the tea and bites were tasty, and the service was fine, but the scarcity was really annoying.  We ordered a Queen's Tea -- one of the largest combos they have -- and it came with only ONE scone across the FOUR of us.  Um, last I checked, a $28 tea platter should not be intended to be eaten by one single person.  So we had to order the Cream Tea in order to get additional scones.  When our platters were served, we were told, \"at the end, you'll get a selection of petit fours.\"  Okay, cool - that sounds fun and yummy.  Fast forward about an hour.  The \"selection\" showed up...a cute, colorful variety of teeny tiny cake bites...and we were allowed to choose ONE.  For all four of us.  Is sugar and dough really THAT expensive???

I just went on here to revise my original review, and add this:\n\nI just had to add to my lovejoys experience... couple weeks ago, my friend n had her babyshower here. The same woman who greeted us when we came the first time was there again. She was super friendly. We had two tables at the back of the restaurant for two hours. For parties, you just decide on the tea service and which sandwiches, and they serve it family style to the tables. If you go over the two hours there is a fee, so no time for games (yay I was NOT looking forward to baby games) but we opened presents and had a great time. The food was yummy. At the end, n got to take the extra food home, they boxed it up for her. Our hostess got the whole group together outside for a photo and took 2 pics from everyone's camera who had one (which was quite a few!).  Great service and a fun afternoon!\n\nWhen I couldn't find my original review. I was so sure I wrote one... maybe I didn't... or maybe it dissapeared... strange... so to memorialize my original visit a year ago, here's an excerpt from a blog I wrote at the time, a yr ago when my parents visited from nh:\n\nFriday, I took the day off from work, and nelly and jade had the day off too. So the five of us went to tea. Not just any old tea, but special girly frilly tea. I always knew I'd take my parents to lovejoys tea house, should they ever visit. Especially my mother would like it. Months earlier, when I found out they were coming, I bought a dress just for the tea place. I even bought shoes to match the dress later, for tea. LOL I figure, you're gonna have real tea, might as well do it right. So, dressed in my cute new green dress, we went to tea. We were actually EARLY for once, and jade was late, as usual, but our earliness made her seem later. That place is GIRLY. We sat on sofas with crocheted things, there were flowers and doilies and frills everywhere. Daddy was a bit uncomfortable to be a guy in that place. There was always one other guy there, plus a guy waiter, but still. I don't think that place could have gotten more feminine. Especially when a lady with a baby showed up and nelly and jade ran over to fawn over and play with it. We got the full tea and it was really good. The food was kinda small, but I ended up full, for an hr or so. I loved the bathroom, the mirror in there was really pretty. My mother went overboard with picture taking at tea. Every bite was a picture... We all had fun though...", "author": "Merredith L."}

If its your first time here I suggest getting the queens tea and splurging a little... after that you will know what your favorite things are and could get a smaller service  if you like (or not).  IF you go here a lot (like I do) try something different with the ploughmans lunch (an assortment of cheeses and chutney and bread, etc.).

This might make me seem indiscriminate, but I like to think of my attitude towards afternoon teas as, um, collaborative. It exists, knowing that I will consume. \nMy parents came  from Sac the weekend of 1/13/2007 to take me to the place of my choice for my birthday. I had tried to get a reservation for Saturday on Thursday, but it was booked through the weekend, so I was put on a waitlist. Friday afternoon I got a phone call from Gillian at Lovejoy's telling me that there'd been a cancellation and would I like to come the next afternoon? God, yes! I had never been before, but an old friend had recommended it repeatedly, based on our mutual love of Jane Austen. \nAfter driving around Noe Valley with my father cursing about how much he hates the city and its parking/traffic situation, we arrived intact and were promptly seated...although at one of the lame tables that didn't include a cushy seat or couch. I mean, it was fine, just not special. My parents are super cheap and, while I had wanted to get the Queen's Tea (which included petit fors), my mother suggested that I get the (less expensive) High Tea. For my birthday. Sigh.... My parents jumped on board and we ended up ordering High Tea for three, with an endless pot of apricot flavored black tea. The tea was smooth, not overly caffeinated, and super drinkable -- to the extent that two different servers remarked on how much we were going through. \nWhen the food came (very quickly...almost suspiciously so), it was on a three-tiered tea tray, as it should be. We had mismatched sets on a lacy tablecloth with a charming clutter in the background that soothed (rather than angered) my aesthetic sensibilities. A good thing, since the sandwiches were sort of disappointing. They weren't terrible, but the roast beef with horseradish was almost undetectable between the two layers of de-crusted wonder bread. The egg salad was good and more like what I had expected, while the pear and stilton was skimpy as well...to the point of the strong cheese's flavor being almost indistinguishable. The scone, on the other hand was grand, and came with (one of the key elements to a tea!) clotted Devonshire cream and preserves. The shortbread -- something I am usually not that big a fan of -- was also very good, as was another surprise winner, the caraway seeded coleslaw (I usually avoid slaw as something that too often seems like a mere conduit for mayonnaise)! The greens with some kind of citrusy vinaigrette were also tasty and fresh. \nAt the end of the meal, a waitress came around with a tray of petit fors, and Mommy asked if I wanted one. I said I wasn't sure (always afraid to test the cheapness waters) and she said she was getting one, so I might as well...Queen's tea after all! I got the triple chocolate cake one, which tasted like it sounded: heavy and chocolatey; and Mommy got a Victorian wedding cake fors, which was very vanilla and very good -- shockingly good for white cake!\nMy parents didn't say too much about what they thought...we have such different tastes that I think they were waiting to see what I thought before they said something conflicting (silly, but appreciated!). I liked all the girls who worked there...they were friendly and accommodating. Unfortunately for them, Dad's caffeine caught up with him in a desperate way which resulted in a lengthy bathroom visit. \nOn the whole, I felt sufficiently able to pretend I was a gentleman's daughter (no help from actual Dad here) in 19th century England and, hence, will be back with the utmost dispatch.", "author": "Aimee F."}

Came here for my birthday on a lovely rainy, wintery day and Lovejoy's was the perfect, cozy setting for a romantic afternoon tea with my husband (who, fortunately, is very secure with his masculinity and did not mind being the only guy in the entire place).  The space is definitely girly with its artful clutter of packaged teas, crockery, and various knicknacks.  The tea was delicious and unlimited (though I wonder who can actually go through more than one generous pot of tea).  Tea for Two was perfect--a generous portion of tea sandwiches, two scones, Devonshire cream, and two pots of tea, plus salad and sauerkraut (which I skipped, since it was my b'day and I don't eat veggies on my birthday).  My only complaint would be the scone.  It was nice and warm but tasted a little more biscuit-like than scone-like; I think I detected a note of pre-packaged scone-ness.  Otherwise, this place is a real find and in a great location.  Just a couple blocks up and you're in Noe Valley and can stop by the awesome Noe Knit store (if you're a knitting fanatic as I am) or Ambiance clothing.  Even my husband, a Noe Valley detractor, managed to find a sufficiently obscure LP at Streetlight to add to our growing collection of useless, unplayable LPs.\n\nAnyway, I digress.

The tables are covered with some old style table cloth, plate & cup sets are all very pretty, and there are different paintings, pictures, and other decorations all over the store and around the walls.  \n\nWe had High Tea for Two, which includes a pot of tea of your choice, 4 choices of sandwiches, 2 scones, and 2 shortbread cookies. I had Vanilla something tea, which is herbal tea, and my sister-in-law added another pot of tea that was caffeinated. The tea was really good, great aroma, and the sandwiches were good too. There was a long list of sandwiches, and we chose chicken asparagus, chicken hummus walnut, figs & olives, and beef and something (I forget). But of course, they are just sandwiches that you can make yourself.  Now the scones... mmm... so good! Very filling, but very good. They give you jam and butter for the scone, but the butter is very different. It's either home-made or flavored butter so it's so very delicious.  It's probably very fattening, but why would I care? I'm having a baby! We were so stuffed before we could finish everything, it cost us a total of $40 including tax & tips. The service was very nice too, so the overall experience was great!\n\nRight across from the tea room, there's its shop where you can get the tea and the tea sets. It's also a very cute store.\n\nWe went on a Wednesday for lunch, and we thought it would be less crowded, but it was surprisingly full.

I chose the black currant tea since I was in a berry mood (I drink green tea religiously every other day of the week) and that was pretty tasty alone, but even better with the cream/milk and a teaspoon of sugar to satisfy my sweet tooth.  High tea is definitely more than enough for one person since you get 2 sandwiches (quartered, so you get 8 pieces each), plus salad, coleslaw, sugar biscuit and scone.

We finally decided on Queen's Tea (for two) and from the lengthy sandwich list, chose the chicken apple walnut, cucumber and cream cheese, pear and stilton cheese, and bayshrimp and mayonnaise sandwiches. They were all deliciously different in their own ways, however, my favorite was the bayshrimp and mayonnaise sandwich. With the help of our patient server, we picked Taylor's Tea Room Blend and Yorkshire Gold and both were perfectly flavorful. We shared both teas and ironically ended up preferring the one the other picked. To every cup we added cream and sugar and seriously, I couldn't stop drinking. It didn't help that our tea pots were refilled every 10 minutes! Our sandwiches came on a bed of \"spring greens\" which had dressing on the side, and Queen's Tea also came with coleslaw (my mother said it was quite good), scones that had raisins, double devon cream, lemon curd and preserves, fresh fruit, crumpets, shortbread cookies and a petit four for each of us. The fruit wasn't too ripe, but that wasn't a big deal anyway, and we were full by the time the crumpets had arrived (fresh out of the oven by the way). \n\nBecause I had so much tea, I had to use the restroom 4 times in an hour! After my mother and I left the tea room to check out their antique store, the Attic, I had to use the restroom again! Since Lovejoy's was closed, I didn't want to try using their restroom and I would've gone to a gas station but my mom was driving and refused to make another stop. So I went back to the tea room and surprisingly, the staff was so nice and didn't mind at all! Not even hints of irritation!\n\nDefinitely going back soon!!!", "author": "Aisha W."}

The decor was cute, quaint and perfect for a ladies tea party.  It sort of reminded me of Alice in Wonderland with its mismatched cups and whimsical style.  Most of us ordered high tea, a few ordered light tea, and one person ordered the healthy tea.  All of the teas I tried were delicious and the food was great.  Warm, delicious scones and flavorful little tea sandwiches were the highlights, and they had plenty of different sandwiches (and teas) to choose from.  The service was good, and we all had a great time.  I would absolutely go back to Lovejoy's again for tea!  Oh, and the price was very reasonable.", "author": "Tera M."}

It's very popular for holidays so make sure to book way in advance.  The large farmhouse style space is eclectically furnished with mismatched couches and tables covered in lace frills to create a comfy Regency sitting room feeling.  It's generally popular with the girls for baby/bridal showers, and the gay guys wandered down from the Castro, sometimes there's an occasional token guy thrown into the mix.  The pots of tea are on endless refill, so make sure to order decaffeinated if you go in the afternoon or you'll be up into the wee hours of the morning (as evidenced by the time stamp on this review...).  The mini crust-less sandwiches are cut into the cutest triangles and arranged perfectly onto the tiered stands, interspersed with salady bits and coleslaw sprinkled with caraway seeds.  Everyone gets a delicate sugar cookie and a large moistly crumbed scone which one covers with lashings of clotted cream and strawberry jam.  \n\nAfter your 2 hour slot has expired, the staff will very politely and tactfully move you out of the space.  You will spend another hour standing outside their door chatting and laughing, periodically dashing back in to use the facilities due to the endless tea.", "author": "SatisFahYing A."}

Waiting outside till it open for afternoon tea, I can see the cutsey decor and all the mis-matched  Kate Spade tea dishes. The tearoom is very quaint, small and cozy...thought it was spatially larger from the looks on their website, but I was wrong. My friend opted to order us non-experienced tea partiers  2 High Tea for Two. We ordered the Cucumber & Cheese ; Smoke Salmon & Creme Cheese (very tasty); Creme Cheese & Mando Orange ; Bay shrimp & mayo ; Smoked Turkey & Dijon..can't remember the rest. \nThe first 3 sandwiches was really tasty and filling. The Bay shrimp & mayo and the smoked Turkey dijon are another story. Yes they are filling, but the shrimp in the Bay Shrimp tasted very watery and wasn't wiped down enough. As for the Smoked Turkey & Dijon, the dijon used was very spicy...has a lot of horseraddish, to the point where I almost choked and had to take it outta my mouth. So if u likey the spicy, then you can choose the dijon & turkey sandwich.\nThe scones however...we're warm and fluffy on the inside and the mullberry jam that matched with it was perfect with the raisnyness of the scones!! I could eat those every morning (ok maybe not to the point I get sick of it.)LOL.\nEach of us had our own pot of tea. My friends got the English Breakfast Tea, Earl Grey tea, Mango flav Black Tea and I got the Passion fruit flav Black Tea. I didn't try the others, but the Passion Fruit tea was ok. Couldn't really taste much of the Passion Fruit flavor as I'm used to in Japanese tea.\nThe High Tea also had cookies, which my friends say were good, but I couldn't eat anymore after stuffing  myself w/ my diuretic tea and sandwiches.\nCost wasn't as bad, like $64 something, we split the bill so it didn't really hurt us as much.\nAll in all my Lovejoy's tea experience was ok.

My BFF Caroline invited me to a private tea party for two for my birthday yesterday. We had \"High Tea For 2\". We chose to drink the Rose Petal tea. Along with tea we got an array of finger sandwhiches (salmon & cream cheese, cucumber & cream cheese, turkey & dijon, and chicken & asparagus). The best part of our meal were the traditional english scones....the best scone i have ever eaten in life no lie, like a mix between a bisquit and a scone. Then we ordered crumpets & lemon curd and sausage puffs a la carte. The sandwhiches were accompanied with a green salad and cole slaw. For dessert we each had a shortbread cookie and a petit lil cake that we inhaled in 2 bites. The service and experience was phenomenal. I adored every second of it. Go there with plenty of time to enjoy and relax. It took us 2 hours for our experience and we loved it. The tea pot was kept warm and full at all times. Great service as well.", "author": "Yolanda O."}

I've been planning to visit this place for years now, so you can imagine the hype that had built up in my head prior to finally making my way there to enjoy the fancy goodness. It did not disappoint! Ambiance was fabulous...crocheted doilies abound, beautiful china, comfy seats of different varieties. We had the High Tea for Two, an excellent choice. You get to pick two types of tiny sandwiches for each of you and then finish it off with a delicious scone with jam and devon cream. Each person receives their own tea pot so you can share and try different varieties...if you are so inclined. All in all a fabulous experience,  I will definitely be back. The thing I like most about it is that it wasn't super stuffy and snobbish as some tea joints can be. You can be completely casual or you can come dressed to the nines with your hat and white gloves.

Add to that  a hearty helping of delicate, fresh and delicious tea sandwiches, buttery currant scones served with huge dollops of real Devonshire cream, hot, buttery, holey crumpets and the room goes a little fuzzy as you slip into warm bliss. The friendly, attentive staff (decked out in vintage aprons) and the mismatched china make it all the more fun. In your tea-induced coma, don't miss all the great, fun and funky gift shop across the street: Lovejoy's attic. Unlike the \"Secret Garden\" tea room--you will find NO FAIRIES or TIARAs here.

It's starts the moment you walk in the door.  You are virtually stepping into the most  inviting, cozy, eclectic, and oh so vintage English style parlor and are greeted almost instantaneously by the warmest and most genuine smiles you will ever see.  It's like going to grandma's house for  a family reunion.  It is filled with happy people laughing and chatting, kids playing dress up and smell of delicious food wafting through the air.   For anyone who is feeling home sick I suggest going to Lovejoy's, I guarantee the feelings will disappear by the time you leave.  \n\nThere is an amazing selection of  wonderfully tasty food, tea and sweets.  The tea sandwiches are by far the best I have had...EVER! The scones which are my favorite thing on the plate, so warm, flaky and so delicious, I am sure heaven will serve these. The tea is outstanding.  After you have finished with your meal they bring around a wonderful selection of petite fores and truffles for you to choose from if you wish.  Seeing the platter of treats and the wonderfully glowing face of the server gives me such mixed emotions.  I am excited about diving into sweets being offered and sad because I know at this point I am almost finished with my tea and will have to be leaving soon.  \n\nLovejoy's is an amazing way to spend the afternoon alone, with that special someone or with a group to celebrate a special event.

And this Nanna is intent on stuffing you silly with cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches and delightful petit fours.  Thankfully, they have some healthier options like organic spring greens and hummus, but that is the extent to which they depart from the typically 'deep in Devonshire' English menu.  I wish they'd infuse it with a little more 'New British cuisine,' like having more wholemeal bread (or 'brown bread' as our they call it on the other side of the pond).  Still, this is the place to go for your clotted cream, scones, lemon curd, and little sandwiches.  This is ideal for girlish and lady-like get-togethers and they handle groups exceptionally well.  No matter how busy they are, the waitresses don't seem to mind capturing your picture-perfect tea party on your camera when asked.  They even take the extra step of shooting extra pics and positioning the 'reserved for royalty' sign in the photo frame.  Delightfully kitschy and one of those instances in which it's more 'British' than what you typically get in Britain.", "author": "Juno P."}

In London, the best are offered on Oxford Street in Selfridge's - a grande dame of a department store overshadowed only by Harrod's - and Fortnum and Mason in Piccadilly. Here in the heart of Noe Valley we have this cozy  tearoom with its Laura Ashley-inspired decor providing a replica good enough to pass muster. Scones with strawberry jam and clotted cream (Devonshire's gift to mankind), toasted crumpets, and tiny cucumber, pear and stilton cheese, or smoked salmon sandwiches minus the crust evoke memories of every high tea I've ever enjoyed. The assorted place settings, mismatched furniture, and preponderance of doilies are eerily reminiscent of my friend Gerald's flat in St. John's Wood, and the waitresses look like extras in a classic film from Shepperton Studios. Pricey, but a lot less expensive than a ticket on British Airways. The general consensus among reviewers is that this is a place for the ladies who lunch.

I usually go to Tranquitea in Pacifica and have experienced a NZ teatime. My thoughts:\n\nPros:\n-TEA SANDWICHES & SCONES. Lovejoy's has an excellent assortment of tea sandwiches. You get to choose from 16 delectable little sandwiches, of which I enjoyed the Chicken-Apple-Walnut and the Chicken & Asparagus. High Tea for Two is an awesome deal.\n\nCons:\n-LACK OF GENUINE CUSTOMER SERVICE. My mom went in to get a table while I found parking. Even though they had four women working, I wasn't greeted at the door and we were only asked how our meal was right at the beginning (when we barely took bites of our food). They topped of my tea without asking if I wanted it topped off (my idea of being wasteful). When the woman served us Petits Fours at the end of our meal, she picked the dessert up w/ the tongs and put it on my dirty lunch plate. Oh, and the Petits Fours were warm.\n-PASTRIES. I've had meatpies overseas, and I really did not enjoy the meatpie here. I ordered the Curried Chicken, and it was definitely too spicy to be enjoying with tea. The pastry shell was not flaky and was quite soggy. It reminded me of one of those microwave pastry deals, but worse.\n-AMBIENCE. The set-up was very cute; however, it did need some tidying up. Our tablecloth was stained with food and the place seemed like it needed some dusting. The area that had tea cups, teas, and collectibles for sale was a bit disorganized. This area drastically needed some cleaning up. Although some might appreciated the mismatched tea sets, I did not.\n\nAlthough Lovejoy's has a nice assortment of teas, it wasn't anything that you wouldn't find at any other tea room.\n\nOverall, Lovejoy's was not the pleasant little tea room that I envisioned it to be. I didn't feel like I was truly having High Tea and felt more like I was eating in a San Francisco diner.\n\nDON'T BOTHER GOING HERE.\n\nMy recommendation: Tranquilitea in Pacifica. Parking is easy and I guarantee you'll have a heavenly High Tea experience :)", "author": "Carrie A."}

I've thrown a couple bridal showers here for my queens and religiously sip tea at Lovejoy's when mum's in town.  The service is fitting, a little noisy if there's a large party, but overall, great price for quite a different experience from the 5 star hotel tea rooms.

And when I do see the occasional guy at Lovejoy's,  he  is typically eating the Shepard's Pie).\nOh boy, I have really dug myself a hole here.  Hard to type with foot in mouth.\nGo to Lovejoy's. You'll \"Love\" it!", "author": "Alulubeth O."}

To be honest, born and raised in Texas I had never experienced afternoon tea with crumpets.  I loved the whole experience.  The different types of teas we chose were absolutely delicious.  I believe we ordered about 4 different types of sandwiches. Being a vegetarian, they had plenty of options to choose from.  The fresh fruit and salad added the perfect touch!  During the time we were enjoying our sandwiches, our host had booked a tea leaf reader.  She was amazing!  I was not expecting that, and she blew my mind away.  Keep in mind that when you do want to book her it is for an hour and I believe the rate is $95.00.  In conclusion, this was a great experience, and I think that everyone should try it once.  Although the crowd is typically older, it is still fun, especially with a lot of your girlfriends.  I HIGHLY recommend this place.", "author": "Samantha R."}

Finger sandwiches, warm scones split open and smothered with double cream and preserves and a hot pot of tea were enjoyed (almost) daily by my engorging little self. \nUpon my return to the states, I just about gave up the dream of ever having such a luxuriously delicious afternoon until I came to know Lovejoy's Tea Room.\nFirst of all, it's adorable. The walls are covered in little antiquey thing-a-ma-bobs (all of which are for sale), the tables adorned with lace doileys and cloths and every woman who works there is almost ridiculously kind. (On a personal note, I also enjoy that most of the time the tea room is a women's space, sometimes a few men will be here and there).\n\nNext, to the food and tea. Hot pots of neverending tea accompany your high tea selections or you can buy just a pot for $8. All the teas are amazing, and the servers come by every 10 minutes or so to check on the tea level and refill it. Everytime I've been there I've ordered the High Tea for Two to share with my girlfriend, a freakin' steal at $34 bucks. You select 4 types of sandwiches to share, a warm scone each, with strawberry preserves and double devon cream, 2 shortbread tea biscuits, coleslaw (with caraway seeds mmmmm) and spring greens/dressing. I order the cucumber/cream cheese sandwiches (they cut off the crusts!!!), The Stilton and Pear, The Artichoke Hummus and the Tomato and cheese (I'm a vegetarian, though I'm sure their meat sandwich selections are just are delicious). \nAll of this is served on a layered silver tray, which makes me feel a bit like a princess, I can't help it.\nAt the end of the meal, though I've always been stuffed, they bring around yet another beautiful tray with petit fours for an additional $2.50. Omg, just get one, ok?\nEverything about this place is enjoyable, calming, nurturing and delicious, and I feel again like I am in the UK. I tried to think of a reason to give it only 4 stars, but I really can't. \nAn amazing place to bring out-of-town guests, or to enjoy a lazy sunday brunch with your love or a good book. \nOh, and their strawberry preserves would make sawdust taste like mana from heaven. How the hell do they make them?", "author": "Robin A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-15", "description": "Now, there are plenty of places to have an impromptu get together for tea, but if you want to make it a special date (and you should! value your girlfriends!), call two weeks in advance and book yourself a table. You can wear anything from jeans to your party dress, it's all acceptable. Your tea will be served and timed perfectly, with plenty of cream and sugar, should you need it, and enough strainers so that you'll never have to mix flavors. Beware the giddiness of too much caffeine. There is an hour and a hall seating time (which we tend to use and then some), but we have never been rushed out of a table. We like to order the queen's tea- don't eat anything before hand, all those sandwiches and salad, scones, crumpets, cookies and lemon curd is more than plenty, but everything is too yummy to leave behind! Lovejoy's feels indulgent, and is therefore a great place to celebrate life's exciting events. I've seen many a shower or small party here. Mostly, though, this teahouse always reminds me how important it is to honor our friendships and indulge them with time, space, and conversation over perfectly steeped tea!", "author": "Jessica R."}

I agree with everyone that the food is good.  However, I was very disappointed when I got home to a large room of people and discovered that they had substituted some sandwiches without notifying me.  I think their food is good but they lack professional catering experience.  Go here with your friends, but don't use them if you have a party.  Or make sure to carefully look over your order *before* you get home.", "author": "Kim L."}

Lovejoy's is not that.  It's comfortable and there is no mistaking that it's an English tea room.  The service was fantastic and even though the place was packed the two and a half hours we were there (group of 15), they were extremely attentive and even took care of my non-dairy needs.  I had asked for a non-dairy tea sandwich and expected to get one or two pieces - as happened to me on a recent visit to the tea room at the King George Hotel where they are very inattentive  - but to my complete surprise, they brought out a platter full with a couple of different options.  I think no matter what the occassion, you'll enjoy this place!", "author": "Amy M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-25", "description": "Atmosphere is everything!!\n\nYes, the atmosphere is so cute, but if you look at the prices, you realize you're getting ripped, especially if you see the price of a package of crumpets in a local supermarket. And $7.95 (I think that's what it was) for a pot of tea!!! You're definitely getting ripped. I think of  Higher Grounds in Glen Park and their pots for about two bucks. Yes, it's an endless pot, but I can only drink so much tea. I may be in the wrong situation to appreciate this place properly, since I was the only solo customer there, and an endless pot of tea might be good for a group, and pooling your money for a large platter of goodies might pay off. And as for atmosphere, granted I may have more slow digestive system than average, but it's hard to fully relax and appreciate the atmosphere as much as you might when the server asks you if you're all done because other parties need your table. Probably this is great for girly parties, but for those truly living the revered Jane Austen's lifestyle (a single woman alone), you might want to make a different choice.", "author": "Cat S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-22", "description": "I really think Lovejoy's is a joy.  About 20 years ago now (yikes!) I tasted my first scone, visiting my sister who was living in Scotland.  I've been back to the UK a few times since and feel about scones & Britain the way I do about bagels & NYC. It's nearly impossible to get a good scone with all the fixin's here in the US, but Lovejoy's does a remarkably good job. Beyond that, though, it's a joy to sit there with the china tea cups, the wonderful tea, the delicious treats. (Why are simple, little sandwiches with the crust cut off so dang good?)  The staff is wonderful, accommodating and cheerful.  They promptly fit us in even when the recording had said they were not taking any more reservations and our server was totally on the ball.  The idea that you are not only able but encouraged to linger over endless pots of tea and nibbles is great.  I was a bit surprised at the rowdiness of the crowd and, consequently, the loudness of the place.  This isn't a deal-breaker for me at all, just something worth noting since it's been mentioned before.  In our case it wasn't screaming children, but it was a large group of excitable women for a wedding shower, I'm guessing.  So, if you're looking for a very upscale, quiet, formal place for tea, this isn't quite it.  But the trade-off is that it's not at all snooty, the prices are reasonable, service is excellent and food delicious.", "author": "Fran C."}
