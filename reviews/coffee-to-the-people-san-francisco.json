Coffee to the People has heaps of political stickers decorated on the walls & tables.\n\nThere is a large bookshelf filled w/ communal books to read or board games to play such as scrabble or chess. Overall Coffee to the People is quite alright yet would love it if the seating was a bit more comfortable as the tables & chairs seemed a bit cramped.\n\nIt would be wonderful to have some low tables w/ floor seating on cushions.

I always crash at my friends' house across the street after a long night of partying and I always love coming here for a breakfast sandwich to sort me out again. The croissant egg and cheese sandwiches are so delicious.\n\nI love the coffee too. As a former barista, I can say that they make their lattes well. I always request an alternative milk and they have so many options here. I'm running an experiment to try them all: hemp, rice, coconut, almond, soy.\n\nThe staff is always so friendly, too! Such kind, bright people who work hard and efficiently. They're good at what they do and I've never been disappointed.\n\nThe atmosphere is calm, has good lighting, lots of seating, and generally has a good vibe and decor.\n\nOnly drawback I'd say is that it can get pricey.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-06-11", "description": "Coffee to the People is great in theory. I'm guilty of mentally overlooking it when I need a place to work away from home but whenever a friend chooses this place as our meet-up spot, I'm reminded of how roomy it is, and often overlooked by *other* people, making it a good place to sort of spread out.\n\nTheir drinks are so-so, unmemorable drip coffee and pretty good speciality drinks (tea lattes and such). They have some halfway decent pastries and bites. It's definitely not BAD-bad.\n\nTypically I'd give the joint 3 stars, but I gotta say, my encounter here the other day leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.\n\nI was a watching a friend's kid a few days ago, in the early afternoon, and Coffee to the People was the decided place to drop him back off. So when I walked in with the kid and looked around for his dad, imagine my surprise when a presumably homeless person began screaming obscenities at us. \"Fuxking pedophile! Get that kid away from me! Don't touch me, get this fuxking pedophile away from me! I don't want none of that sick little kid sh*t\" and so on and so forth, she screamed. The kid I was with was obviously shaken, so I lead him away immediately to console him and tell him that that lady \"was just having a bad day\" etc. A few other patrons of course took notice, and added that she was cuckoo, crazy, and not to pay her any mind to help make the kid feel a bit more at ease.\n\nNow, I live close to this neighborhood and am well aware of the mental instability that comes along with the terrain, having witness it firsthand many times. But when the woman who had been screaming at us proceeded to add cream and sugar to her coffee, while angrily muttering to herself and dragging her suitcase along clunkily within the establishment, and the staff said absolutely NOTHING to her, I was shocked.\n\nI've worked in a coffee shop in a part of town that gets a lot of homeless folks, and I've given away a lot of free coffee to people who obviously couldn't afford it but were respectful when walking in. I've also escorted many people out who were being rude or vicious or getting in the face of customers. The fact that the staff did nothing, didn't ask her to leave or check with us to see if we were okay, is pretty inexcusable. Like, I get that Coffee to the People is in the Haight-Ashbury, that there are plenty of people shouting profanities and impeding on personal space all the time, but if you allow that sort of behavior in your business, what is separating your coffee shop from the street outside?\n\nI don't know, if I was forgetting about this place before, now my overlooking it will be much more intentional.", "author": "Megan D."}

I am not from the area so keep in mind...\n\nThe pros: The reason I came here was because of the wifi and outlets availability. I also love open spaces and this place has this with much seating, including a handicapped table as well as s few couches/sofas. The selection of drinks and pastries are in good variety. You're surrounded by fun shops also. If you must migrate, there are other cafe's nearby as well. Fair-trade certified. The service is quick. It is a good place to meet up with people when not trying to impress. They also seem to support local arts and crafts which is noble, yes?\n\nThe cons: There is a waft of BO that you will smell here and there, as others have mentioned - welcome to Haight-Ashbury. It might be worse in the summertime? It does not look as grungy as it may sound here. The baked goods do not look the most appetizing, although the concept sounds delightful (ie: Vegan tamale pie). Most important when talking about a coffee shop, the coffee is not good. Perhaps, is it my own subjective opinion, and you may love it. To me, the drip does not taste fresh and tastes like a Denny's cup of joe. I will drink really any coffee though, but the coffee or the cup I got it in smells like rubber. I have no explanation for any of this.\n\nNeutral: The music is pop-ish....something that keeps me awake when doing desk work or driving.

I'm no genius, but 2 drinks that cost no more than $2.50 each does not add up to $7-something.  We paid first but then thought about this and became confused by the whole transaction.  We brought it up to the staffer, who then realized the mistake.  To make the matter more complicated, settling the difference from 'fake' cost to 'real' cost took waay too much time and effort.\n\nHopefully that was just an one-time situation, but if I were to go there again, I'd make sure they are charging me correctly for the right drinks and for the right prices.", "author": "Judy C."}

I think it's more about personal feelings than about the coffee.  (Hey, maybe direct some of that bitterness to the old owners who clearly weren't all that into peace, love, and happiness if they were willing to sell out and rake in a lot of cold hard cash.)\n\nI say this because I was going to this place for a solid year before ownership changed.  Yeah, there were some pretty awesome and nice people who used to work there.  To be fair, there were also a couple pretty heinous people who were pretty mean to the homeless folks/kids hanging out in the street outside.  (One girl yelled at them in front of everyone in the store.)\n\nAll that is to say, the biggest change I've noticed is that they use different cardboard cup-holder thingies, now.  Which is a little sad b/c the old ones with the store's logo were neat.  The walls still have local art rotating in and out, there's still a mix of students, locals, hippies, and preppier folks inside.  I haven't noticed any real change in the quality of the coffee--and I'm a coffee snob.  \n\nThe new folks are pretty nice.  Particularly two of the ladies working there.  One guy is a little quieter, but I certainly don't think he's mean.\n\n...And I haven't seen them hassling anyone about using the bathroom.  I have seen them get a little frustrated when an older customer kept running to the bathroom every 10 minutes and was yelling that the door wasn't buzzed open fast enough...but everyone's human, and they certainly weren't keeping him from using the bathroom.\n\nAll in all, this place is solid for a cup of coffee.  Much better than the people's cafe on Haight (read:  MUCH faster service and a more neighborhood vibe).  Also, when I switched to decaf, the folks at Coffee to the People noticed and started brewing fresh decaf to have on hand.  AND, the flavor of the decaf is pretty good.  I'm a fan.\n\n\nUPDATE:  about the 10-purchase card.  They still honor it.  I've gotten about 4 free coffees since the new owners started.  Yeah, the card has 20 boxes on it now.  They're saving paper.  You still get a free drink after 10 purchases, they just draw a line through the one row of boxes and start stamping the next row.  ...And my last free drink was definitely a large mocha when my usual is a medium drip.", "author": "Lauren C."}

I found a comfy couch with a big table I could set up my laptop in front of me on.  I ordered a drink and sat down to get working.  A young couple consisting of a bohemian 20-something hippie chick and a thuggish dude with a hoodie came in and sat down next to me and proceeded to take over most of the table.  Cell phone and charger plugged in and on the table and a chess board set up on the table.  No biggie I could probably still find a space in the corner for my laptop or I could use it on my lap.\n\nI noticed the girl had a constant cough that sounded rather strange - like there was a lot of phlegm in her throat.  The guy said nothing the whole time and only seemed to get agitated when his female friend would beat him in chess.  There clothes looked a little bit ratty and I thought that they might be homeless but they didn't smell or have any obviously bad hygiene so I figured they were your garden variety Haight St. hippies.  \n\nThen out of the blue, a barrista asked them if they were going to order something.  I think the girl wanted to stay and she said \"ummmm......\" while the guy muttered \"no mas\" and started getting up to leave.  I guess that was his signal to his friend that they had to leave so they left.\n\nOn another couch there was an obese man with a white beard who was clearly homeless.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-27", "description": "I read some of the negative reviews before writing this, because I am curious and cynical. Many reviewers seemed to think that this was a yuppie hangout. To the contrary, this seems to be one of the only coffee shops that is yuppieless. \n\nMaybe some reviewers are not good at spotting yuppies, so I'll give you a quick overview (I lived in Palo Alto for three horrible months, so I know my way around them). Yuppiehood requires the following characteristics: \n\n1. Zero critical thinking abilities beyond technocratic and fiduciary wisdom.\n2. An expectation that inflated prices equal quality, and a preternatural attraction to places that exemplify expensive tastes.\n3. A feigned interest in \"diversity\" which hides a true disdain for any socioeconomic diversity.\n3a. A physical repulsion for poverty, despite a democratic voting record.\n4. A boring personality.\n\nOkay, now back to CTTP.\n\nI find myself strangely drawn back here, time and time again. I should say as a disclaimer I am about as far as one could get from being a coffee snob. I have no idea what good or bad coffee is, and I don't really understand the hype over comparing caf\u00e9s for their coffee.\n\nThat being said, I AM a tea snob, and I do understand what good and bad tea is. Coffee To the People has a truly phenomenal tea selection--two different kinds of oolong? Seriously. And the prices are GOOOOOD. The baristas give you a bag of looseleaf tea exploding out of the paper teabag for less than two bucks, and hot water after that's free. Often their overpacked tea bags are good for two refills.\n\nAnyway, I think the best part of CTTP is the couches. I said I was a tea snob. Add to my snobbery a couch snobbery. Not with brand, but with comfort. I love the couches here because they are plentiful and plush and always seem to have room for another tookus. \n\nIt's also a really interesting caf\u00e9 to sit and people-watch. The people who come in and out are really truly diverse-socioeconomically, that is. I like a caf\u00e9 where rich, poor and inbetween interact. The local street kids and beggars seem to have this innate respect for Coffee to the People--they don't bother people inside for change, or beg outside, and the owners treat them with just as much respect as customers as they do anyone else.\n\nFinally, the quality of light by the skylights is really good, and there are a ton of books on the wall. If you're ever bored, there's no shortage of weird books on the wall to peruse. The diversity of books is also very strange--on a recent visit, I saw a book on typography, an autobiography of J. Edgar Hoover, a book on investing by Chuck Schwab and Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections. Weird.\n\nPS: If you say CTTP with a slur, it sounds like CCCP. \"I'm going down to Soviet Russia for coffee and prole-watching.\"", "author": "Maxine Y."}

A medium cup of black coffee. It came out in a very uniform looking mug with a small plate under it. A nice touch, I thought. The coffee itself was piping hot and an awesome pick me up. Great roast. Great flavor. I sipped it at a table and enjoyed the intermission to my shopping and sampling spree. \n\nNext time ill have to try one of their vegan donuts with my coffee.

My final vote is 3 stars and here's why:\n\n- the coffee is good.  I dare say they make the best vanilla latte in the city, and I say that because they are the only coffee place I know of that can steam rice milk to perfection (I always get my coffees with a dairy alternative).  \n\n- the service is poor.  Now I'm not saying that everybody that works at this place does a bad job.  In fact, I would say that half of the employees are friendly and make your experience pleasant.  However, the other half, other Yelpers have already commented on who those individuals are, offer up the worst coffee bar experience I've ever had.\n\nWith that being said, while I will continue to visit CTTP when a vanilla rice milk latte urge kicks, I will always feel like I'm making a gamble.  I can't guarantee on great service every time, which to me is a big deal if I'm going to make a return visit.\n\nOther coffee shops, take note.  Please start offering more than just soy has an alternative to dairy!  Rice milk is so delicious and makes a mean latte.", "author": "Beenish K."}

As recent transplants from the 'burbs of Florida, my husband Owen and I found this was the best place to have coffee and free wi-fi access.  Their coffee is great, the couches are comfy and inviting, they have interesting, games, interesting books on socially conscious issues--and most importantly (for me, anyway), their bathroom is CLEAN!!\n\nPlus, they were super-nice: since we were kinda broke and had the added pressure of needing to find an apartment and jobs post-haste, we asked the girl behind the counter (later found out she was one of the owners) if they minded if we were there for a long while using the wi-fi even though we'd only bought 1 coffee each.  She said no problem!  We made the place our official Relocation HQ and went in everyday for our first week in the city.  They didn't disappoint, it was just as nice everytime we went in.  Weekends were considerably more crowded of course, everyone and their mother had their laptop to use the free wi-fi.\n\nI'd agree that they could use a little more selection in their pastries, especially more bagels, please!

Their cafe latte is decent, but it's no Organica. Nevertheless, Coffee to the People does a great job of resurrecting the hippie ideals of Haight from back  when and I don't want to see it going anywhere anytime soon. Plus their sugar cookies are awesome and I've heard good things about the sandwiches. 4/3/06\r\n\r\nCoffee to the People is right around the corner from me and when it had first opened, I remember being rather unimpressed with it's inside deco and vibe. All the posters, randomly hung up, seemed to try too hard, and reminded me of Scholastic ordering days back in Elementary school. However, I visited on a whim the other week, and the hype is definitely pretty truthful. It's the people that make this place. There's a very warm atmopshere inside and it's an ideal place to kick back and relax.  Despite all urges to interpret the place as cheesy, I had an awesome time, as I sipped on my chai, watching a variety of musical and poetic performances. All of them - heartfelt and genuine - much like the audience. I felt like I was back at a college open-mike, and reveled in the feeling. I've even been mildly inspired to stop by sometime and share some of my  own writing. (MILDLY) A great addition to Haight Street.

Not in the standard 'I only like organic beans' or 'I only drink french roast' or anything... but in a 'Is this made properly?' way. And... at Coffee to the People my latte was perfecto! The fatter the milk, the better the foam, so I'm used to some sub-par foam when I order with 2%. Also the best foam comes from a fresh steam and not a re-heated steam. Despite not being very busy they obviously freshly steam all their milk from a cold pour. My foam was YUMM YUMM! \n\nI was preparing myself for patchouli and political chants when I walked in and was impressed that despite how hippy it is, it wasn't one of those... 'I'm extremely liberal yet I still feel awkward' places. It was a... 'Yeah... I get it' kinda feeling. They teach you what's compostable, what's recyclable, and have a nice photo of what's landfill. Makes you not want to throw the wrong thing in the wrong place. \n\nThe couches are cozy and the wireless looked exciting. I felt like everyone on their laptop was doing something really good for humanity or writing a really deep poem... then I caught a glimpse of myspace. Oh well.

The sandwiches are huge (and difficult to bite into because of their height) and filled with fresh ingredients.  Love all the vegan options like the vegan doughnuts.  I love toasted bagels with Tofutti.  The bagel guy doesn't get there till around 7:30 AM though.\n\nWhat really makes this place special is its community - it attracts a truly diverse group of people including some colorful regulars, not all of whom have homes.  It also attracts professionals, tourists, artist types, etc.  The staff is very laid back.  They support local artists and give back to the community.  They're good about recycling too.  They display the work of local artists on the walls.  It's hard not to like a place like this.  Oh and sometimes they play music I really like (e.g., Cure, She Wants Revenge) too.  Sometimes they play music I really can't stand too, but oh well.\n\nIt's a cozy & comfortable place to plug in your laptop (plenty of power outlets) and sit.  They have a bathroom too.  And games.  And books.  Open mic night on Tuesdays.  Credit cards accepted, $5 minimum.  They have a frequent buyer card for the coffee drinks too.\n\nTip:  Some of the customers have body odor, so try to sit near the door.\n\nUpdate:  They stopped making sandwiches long ago.  I'm sad to hear that the new owners took away the health care benefits the employees had.  I read about it in the Haight Ashbury Beat.  So far the menu is the same.

It's surprising the Haight doesn't have more places like this. Cole Valley Cafe is close but doesn't have much space or comfort, and La Boulange doesn't have wifi.\n\nSo I appreciate Coffee To The People for filling a need, and really doing it quite well. The coffee menu's inventive and complete, the service is friendly, and they serve good non-pastry options like sandwiches and lasagna. The coffee's generally fine and you can indulge in hazelnut milk.\n\nThis five star rating is according to a certain taste: the furniture is threadbare, the plates and glasses chipped and random. Earnest political posters and bumper stickers on the walls give lip service to the neighborhood theme. You wouldn't take anyone here to impress them, but it's a great place to feel perfectly at ease. \n\nSure there are negatives. The soymilk is only vanilla, despite the presence of vanilla syrup someone could ask for if they wanted that. It's not the pitch-perfect coffee you'd get at Philz or Ritual. And they can't help that the occasional unbathed Haight denizen with the shakes will plop himself next to you. Should I withhold a star? Nah -- Coffee To The People delivers the homey, threadbare coffeehouse experience, and doesn't pretend to be anything else.", "author": "Rainbucket B."}

At first our relationship was a little tenuous.  The coffee was good...and I loved the hippie vibe.  But it wasn't enough for me.  I wanted more...\n\nOkay, seriously though.  It's taken me a while to fall in love with Coffee to the People.  I go in a lot.  I'd say, on average at least 3 times a week.  Let's talk about the coffee first.  I'm a fan.  It's never been burnt, it's always good and hot.  Other drinks are solid too...although sometimes the matcha lattes are a little heavy on the matcha.  Oh, and you can get a nice big pot of tea for pretty cheap.\n\nNow let's talk about the people.  A number of other Yelp reviews have called out the fact that some of the employees aren't what you might call chatty cathys.  And I must admit, it took a while for some of the employees to warm up, despite my frequent visits.  At first I was a little shy.  But then one day, I decided to buck up and make the first move.  \n\nThat's right...I asked the baristas how they were doing....every day.  At this point, I know most all of the morning folk by name, and I definitely chat it up with Ashley, Mary, Jenina (although I don't know how to spell her name), Austin, Laura, and Fernando.  Not all mornings are created equal.  And I certainly can understand not feeling super chatty when you're exhausted....but at this point, I know and like them all so we don't always have to talk (yes, we've gotten to that point in the relationship).\n\nAnd as far as the atmosphere, it's so very Haight, from the wall of stickers, to the anti-war tables, to the rotating art exhibits.  There's always something (or someone) to look at.  The wi-fi is solid too, and even when I was using Coffee to the People as my office-away-from-the-office and sitting there on my laptop for 6 to 8 hours at a time, they never batted an eye.\n\nAt the end of the day, I love this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-03-20", "description": "You certainly powered my flower!\n\nLet me start off by saying that this is my first review on Yelp. I've used Yelp often since I moved to Berkeley, but never have I delved into the area of writing on the site. That being said, I am hesitant to give my first review such a rave review - I wouldn't want anyone to think I'm just giving stars away for the sake of star-giving power. On the contrary, I felt so compelled to sit down and write this review because Coffee to the People was in fact so worthy! In sum, I'm not a star whore - CTTP (as it is lovingly referred to by others) is truly worth my rating!\n\nAnd now for why CTTP has earned five stars in my book...\n\nA little background: I got to Haight a little later than I had planned, was starving, irritable and a little discombobulated in general. Life seemed all-too-overwhelming and my wandering that day felt particularly aimless. All I wanted was a good old fashioned cup of black gold. I stumbled into CTTP and at first glance thought, \"Oh great, another place where the staff and clientele alike are going to stick up their noses at my designer sunglasses and scoff at how I don't belong.\" \n\nBut to my delight, no one seemed to care either way. I wasn't paid much attention to, but I also wasn't brushed off or treated rudely. Essentially, I was left to be, which was just what I was looking for. \n\nMy first instinct was to order a very large black coffee...that is until I spotted the Flower Power - a vegan drink of espresso, chai and soymilk. $5 for a cup of coffee you ask? Oh yes, and worth every penny. My drink was fixed quickly and even had a little flower drawn on the cup. I'm generally not a sucker for cutesy nothings but in that moment it put a smile on my face, and that's worth noting! The drink itself warmed my heart, my belly, and satisfied my taste buds. Only problem is, I think I'm spoiled for life!\n\nThere was also a nice collection of vegan snacks which all looked excellent - I settled on a cookie, which the barista was happy to warm up for me - and the sandwiches that they offered seemed appetizing. \n\nUnfortunately, all of the couches and armchairs were occupied, but I settled for a cozy nook, which wasn't so bad because the  the chairs and benches had pillows aplently to sit on, lean on or even hide yourself away in. \n\nMy nook was situated next to a bulletin board dedicated to bumper stickers, which kept me occupied for some time! I also brought along with me to my nook Trivial Pursuit. CTTP has a vast collection of games to choose from, and being a nerd, I love flipping through Trivial Pursuit cards learning useless yet ever so enticing tidbits. Their game collection was a definite plus!\n\nAdmittedly, I did not use the bathroom, which I often use as an indicator of a restaurant/cafe/anywhere that should have a toilet's overall cleanliness and customer service. Regardless, with Flower Power, vegan treats, games aplenty and free internet access, to boot, Coffee to the People is a treasure, in my opinion!\n\nI left feeling refreshed, caffeinated and totally empowered.

Any comments I make shall largely be focused on the aesthetic and atmospheric climate of this establishment. If you are looking for an office away from home then this will suffice in the short term. However, from a functionl perspective, there are a few things lacking\n\n1. The cups and saucers are chipped...always. I have yet to get a cup (15 visits so far) that is not chipped or cracked. If you ask for a replacement you receive a look that makes you feel like you invented capitalism, fungal infections and papercuts.\n\n2. The toilets: There is one and it is eternally busy. Some of the occupants are even customers. I fully appreciate that non-paying customers may need to use the facilities at times but they appear to go in there and hibernate. \n\n3. The armchairs: I know no other way to say this other than in a forthright manner...they smell. Sit in one for an hour and the distinct smell of BO, sickly perfume, cigarette smoke, sour milk clings to you like a limpet to a schooner. This is especially regretable as they are tremenduously comfortable.\n\n4. The cost: This place is expensive. The most expensive single espresso I have yet found in the three months I have lived in SF. On a plus side it is the only place I have been to in the US that heats its espresso cups prior to filling them. Long may such a habit last\n\nHowever:\n\nThis is a great place to people watch. A good cross section of society drifts in here and usually, most announce their arrival. On any given day I estimate 45% of the patrons are smply there so they can be looked at while they work...and there is nothing wrong with that.", "author": "Neil W."}

This was possibly the most mellow coffee shop atmosphere I have ever seen. The vibe was way more opium den than coffee shop. This is caffeinated San Francisco? I seriously had to look out the window to make sure I hadn't somehow been beamed to Portland.*\n\nThe Beach Boys were blasting on the stereo system, which was a little disconcerting. The Beach Boys are one of those things where you either love them or hate them. I myself am a lover, but I think out of respect for the other half, I would hesitate before subjecting an entire room of strangers to them at that volume. It became clear to me fast, though, that the tatted up barista who was running the show cared little for the common people to whom she served coffee. \n\nAs I waited quite a while for my small latte, I listened to her complain about how hot she was. Imagine being hot while standing crammed behind a counter in front of an espresso machine while steaming milk! I have personally put in many, many hours at the helm of an industrial sized espresso machine, and let me tell those who are not in the know- it's not even remotely chilly. The barista barked a command at a smaller, clearly intimidated co-worker to \"go out there and open the front doors- both of them!\" Small, intimidated barista obliged, but paused mid-scurry to inform the tatted up barista that the coffee shop- you know, the part where the paying customers hang out - wasn't hot like it was behind the counter, and people might get cold. To which tatts replied \"Open the doors anyway. People won't be very happy if the workers pass out and can't do their job.\"  Ah, warm fuzzies all around.\n\nI finally got my latte and stirred in some sugar, at which point I was faced with the perplexing decision about which of the 5,000 different bins to throw the stirrer away in. Lucky for me, they each had a list of all the different things you could throw away on each one. After a mere 30 minutes or so of reading, I discovered that my stirrer should go into the \"Compost\" bin. I surely didn't want to throw it in the trash, where a sign made it clear that you were single handedly filling the world with evil landfill if you threw anything -ANYTHING- in that bin. Call me crazy, but why not have spoons available so the people can stir their coffee with something that doesn't need to be thrown away?\n\nAs I was leaving, another barista emerged from the back and called out \"Half of a vegan sandwich!\" and plopped a plate down on the counter, then turned to walk away without a backward glance.\n\nThree stars to Coffee to the People for sheer chuckle value. It's not often that a place can defend the earth and disregard it's human patrons with  equal vigor and aplomb. \n\n*Footnote: I absolutely adore Portland, so Portlanders, don't get your panties in a bunch.", "author": "Angie R."}

Granted, i've only been there once, but that was enough.  I was drawn in by the comfy look and the *free trade* agenda.  This sort of deception is my weakness (I once believed they took \"gullible\" out of the dictionary when someone told me that, too.)  Don't fall for it!  The cappucino was bitter and burnt, the mocha was more sickningly sweet than anything at Star*@!&s, and the chai was all bite and no taste.   The space was pleasant, but it was also a bit odd because it looked like somone with anal tendencies over-consciously styled it to look disorganized.", "author": "Today Y."}

The baristas exist in their own world,  involving each other, the music, or their friends leaning on the counter telling loud stories over the noise of the steamer. When they do decide to acknowledge the line slowing piling up, it is with terse, slightly clueless service, totalling with hyperbolic prices and slow delivery.

Friendliness factor is neutral and the political/social statements on the wall could be more creative, although they're interesting.  They do, however, have many tables and spots to sit, which is more than I can say about many other places.  That's a huge plus if you find yourself in the Haight.  It's also nice to see a place truly dedicated to organic and fair trade.", "author": "marie m."}

It is also family friendly. I saw a couple of families with children having breakfast. There are small tables in the front and couple of couches in the back. During busy hours, it's difficult to find a table or a place to sit. About half of the tables were occupied by a person with a laptop and outlets were readily available. The coffee is good; however, my medium latte was $3.50, 50 cents higher than other cafes but the CTTP progressive mission is valid, fair trade, organic, vegan, etc. I will come back Tuesday night for the open mic.", "author": "Phillip T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-19", "description": "I am by no means a connoisseur of all things coffee nor do I indulge in coffee so I would say my review is a tad lopsided. \n\nFirst off, this place embodies what the Haight represents. Right from the onset, the name of the place itself oozes liberty and justice for all. You make your way in and the ambiance and decor faithfully reinforce its name suggesting that sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. All the insignia and bites of quotes bring out a sense of revolution and critical thought,  spewing out reality checks for daily living while still maintaining a certain aesthetic sense and balance. I felt invigorated walking in prior to even sippin' some joe. Furthermore, Couches,varied and interesting book selections, optimal volume on the music are all well placed additions that maintain its intended vibe. Especially the free wifi totally steals the show and adds to the 'to the people stance' that this place tries to inhabit. Also, the place is fair trade which all the much more appeals and agrees with my sensibilities.\n\nThe one thing that I could not however do here was study with focus. If your going here trying to digest technical details and structured information the place is not ideal. Its more suited for the fiction oriented creative outbursts of energy and whimsicality that it probably intends to be. Ofcourse cant expect this place to satisfy my every whim since that is probably only reserved to heaven and lets not forget that this is the Haight were talking about! Overall though, great place to surf and chill and chat and read and I hope these local independents have their own renaissance.\n\n Been here twice and expect to be a regular. I give it 4 1/2 stars for ambiance and spirit, just wish it took up a lil more real estate. I wish I could tell you more about the coffee but alas this is the full extent of what I can critique.", "author": "Mallik P."}

The atmosphere is fine, but nothing special. It's definitely better than muddy waters, but not as good as Revolution Cafe. Plain wood tables and chairs, a few worn couches, free wi-fi, it's decent. And I am SO sick of hearing about their fair trade coffee -- big whoopdeedooda. There are a million places in the city that offer fair trade coffee, for fuck's sake. The meat they serve is not organic OR free-range -- the way workers and the environment (not to mention the animals) are exploited in the meat industry is FAR worse than in the coffee industry. It's lame that people are so quick to embrace the \"trendy\" social issues, but don't bother with an issue that's not as popular but more important. That's not real activism -- that's pseudo hippy crap. Blech.", "author": "China Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-04", "description": "update  09/17/06:\ni was contacted by one of the owners of coffee to the people. she was very polite and quite helpful in explaining how coffee to the people gives back to the community. i felt her sincerity, passion and energy in the letter. hence i don't do this very often, but i'm going to increase the rating. three stars for the coffee and one additional star for giving back to the community. thank you, coffee to the people.\n\nthis is a segment from her letter:\n\nHere are just a few of the ways that CTTP is different from other coffeeshops:\n1) We only serve organic, fair trade coffee. This is better for the environment, better for the health of our customers, and, most important, better for the people who work in the world's coffee fields\n2) We pay our employees higher than the San Francisco minimum wage\n3) We provide our full-time employees with the opportunity for health insurance\n4) We provide our full-time employees with the opportunity to own part of the coffeeshop\n5) We allow progressive organizations to use our coffeeshop for events and then provide them with 10% of the total revenue collected during those events\n6) Our employees donate a portion of all tips to CoffeeKids--a non-profit organization for helping children in coffee-growing communities\n7) We have pledged to donate 10% of all of our profits to nonprofit environmental and social justice organizations (we aren't profitable yet, but we hope to become so sometime in the next year)\n8) We provide free coffee for important neighborhood events (e.g. Clean-Up the Haight Day).\n.\n\n* * \noriginal  09/04/06:\num, i don't get the hype here. granted it's probably the best coffee house in the uppper haight, but that's not really saying much. if you compare coffee to the people to say, ritual or blue bottle or peet's, imho, it's infinitely inferior. yeah, you can preach to me about the fair-trade coffee, but even starbucks has fair-trade coffee these days. \n\nas far as coffee to the people's social awareness is concerned, i'm somewhat confused. so there are social problems around the world. no argument there. however, does coffee to the people actually participate in raising or solving the social issues of the world? just cuz you have a few books about che, marx and engels doesn't make you a champion of the people. now if coffee to the people is using the whole social awareness cause to promote their coffee house and make money, then at best, i find the whole thing gimmickry and at worst, it's another shameless exploitation of the people. kinda like the proliferation of all those che and frida shirts on haight. hence until someone can convince me that coffee to the people does indeed contribute to the cause of the people, i'm giving it two stars.", "author": "frisco j."}

However this is one of my fav coffee shops in town. On the weekends this place can get very busy but if you get it on more of a slow day this is a chill hang out. I almost always stop here if I am in the haight or even passing through. I have never felt like anyone here was flat out mean but they are a little cold.. consider all the types of people they deal with and see all day every day.. especially in the food service industry it takes a special type of person to be able to deal. (this comes from first hand experience) I have never eatin the food but the coffee is always good.. you would be surprised how many people can f-up a white chocolate mocha these days!

I don't come here to hang out, though I've wanted to spend a lazy afternoon here just playing boardgames, but who has the time?! My boyfriend has had business meetings here and it's served the purpose fine. They have a great \"rewards program\" where you earn free coffee drinks, and they are so nice to almost always use it on the most expensive item.  Speaking of pricing, they are a bit higher than say, starbucks, but if you are going to starbucks and supporting huge corporations that are sucking the life out of small businesses, you probably wouldn't want to go here anyway.

So, it kinda bugged me that after I very specifically ordered \"soy\", that I was given regular cow milk - luckily I double checked. The guy went to remake it (he was nice about it), and I had to ask for a different cup. Not to be anal, but if I'm trying to not eat animal products, why would I order a soy drink and want to drink it from a cup that had just had cow milk in it? But, here's the rub. It's really futile to try to avoid animal products at this place because they share the espresso machine steamer between soy and cow milk - and - they use the same pitcher to heat up the milks. Then again, this is the case at most coffee places. But...because they go out of the way to advertise their vegan offerings, they should be a bit more aware and sensitive to this. Oh well.
