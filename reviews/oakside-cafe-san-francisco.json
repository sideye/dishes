Coffee was good and they do have free WiFi so you can get some work done. No complaints there. \n\nMy knock on this place is the door. I know that seems stupid but it doesn't close unless you actively push it shut or someone opens the door so far wide open that it gets enough momentum to close on its own. After sitting here for a while, the door closed about 50% of the time. \n\nWhy is this important? Because on days when it's cold outside (like right now), I don't want to be sitting inside freezing because the door doesn't close! \n\nI feel like that's a simple fix for a place like this so hopefully this changes soon.", "author": "Matt M."}

OakSide Cafe is located on the corner of Oak and Broderick (one block west of Divisadero). This clean and casually arty cafe plays host to groovy hipsters, day laborers, and middle aged travelers, among others. \n\nThere are plenty of places in the Lower Haight to break your fast, but some places may also help break your wallet. For those travelers who might be a little cash-conscious after a few days in spend-easy free-wheeling San Francisco, visiting here is a breakfast blessing. \n\nI came here on my way to work and was greeted by a lovely worker. I noticed that once I entered there was an upstairs gallery, where you can sit and look down on the little people while enjoying your coffee if that's your thing. There is also a computer on the lower floor that customers are able to use and not to mention they also have WiFi! **Free**\n\nOakSide has bagels from $1.29 to $3.95; those at the higher end can contain scrambled egg plus bacon, ham or sausage and your choice of cheese, too. Top it off with a good cup of fresh brewed coffee or tea and you're good to go. I'm technically NOT a coffee drinker so I wouldn't be able to give any feedback on how that taste but it smells like coffee once entering this place. \n\nLunchtime specialty sandwiches run from $5.75 to $6.95, but the best deal of all might be the $4.95 lunch time special which is composed of a sandwich and a complimentary drink (11:30 - 1:30).\n\nThese prices compare very favorably to other nearby eating spots.\n\nThe decor is bright and the place is lined with original art for sale or on permanent display. Other amenities include a computer with Internet ($1 for ten minutes), a selection of free local papers, and a curio cabinet offering interesting bric-a-brac, curiosities and those free advertising postcards which often make nice souvenirs. \n\nOverall, good place to come in the morning if you are looking for a good place to eat and clear your mind. All the times that I have come here it never seems to get busy so long lines are not a big thing here.", "author": "Porsche C."}

There were too many tomato slices (I ended up taking one out of the second half which balanced the sandwich more) and I don't understand why most sandwich shops don't also heat up the meat.

A toasted everything bagel with lox is the penultimate bagel for me. Since I'd worked up an appetite after walking around the Haight this morning, I stopped by and warily ordered my usual, which comes with fresh tomato slices and capers at Oakside.

Truly, I wish I'd have discovered it sooner.\n\nI went during the day today (A Tuesday), and it was really quiet and cozy. I was primarily looking for a place with a cozy atmosphere to sip some coffee and read a book, and this place delivered. \n\nThere was a nice wooden bar with a row of seats facing the window, and I noticed unlike most cafe bars, there was plenty of space, so that one could actually eat comfortably at the bar instead of feeling cramped for space.\n\nAlso, upstairs was a row of people seated with their macbooks. When I walked up stairs there was a cute little couch that I parked on. Very comfy. And I noticed the reason for the row of macbooks was that this place has TONS of outlets, so if you're looking to use your computer in a cafe, this is a good place to do that.\n\nFinally, the coffee was pretty good. I didn't try any of the food but the pastries and what not looked pretty good, like any decent coffee shop. \n\nI definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy, quiet coffee shop to read, chill or do work on their laptop in.", "author": "Jamie P."}

It's great on the go because it's already packed and ready to take with you. A little pricey, but I'm willing to pay extra for the omission of preservatives and artificial flavors that bottled juice can have.

Yeah, totally awesome Saturday morning for Maria D. \n\nSo, after I cleaned up the puke-a-torium (okay, it wasn't that bad, but I am never drinking Red Bull ever again), I took my queasy self to Oakside, a very cute, kind of run down, strictly neighborhood little coffee shop that wasn't going to be full of well dressed 117-ers talking about the shows they went to the night before. All I wanted was to be left alone with my laptop, my three beverages and salty BLT and not be distracted by ugly \"fashion\" and name dropping and crepes.

But I do enjoy the undiscovered and rough around the edges feel of this Oakside.  Plus it's slightly uncomfortable chairs and quiet upstairs section* make it a good place to get some work done.\n\n*note: one of the days I was working in this \"quiet\" upstairs section, a middle aged group of Latino men (who were dressed in warm ups and soccer jerseys) came in and played some very loud (but amicable) rounds of poker.  Mildly annoying? Sure, but also a part of Oakside's charm that I wouldn't want to lose.", "author": "aekta s."}

I get their ice soy latte when I am in the coffee mood and they never disappoint. It is a nice little place to be in with that traditional coffee shop feel. It never seems to be overcrowded and they have an upstairs for your extended coffee stays. The sundried tomato cream cheese for the bagels is something that I have never found anywhere else and is fantastic. It's like a vodka sauce for pasta on a bagel. Tasty!", "author": "William R."}

Very friendly staff.\n2. On the lounge (2end floor) you have 5 tables with nearby outlets, the 2 other tables are a bit far for the outlet. And there's a sofa too.\n3. unlimited, free WIFI \n4. quiet, the music at a not disturbing volume\n5. enough light for work: although the light could be a bit better, it's still ok. What I really appreciate are the huge windows! From every table you can see outside, you see the \"world moving on\" while studying.\n6. Coffee: I'm not a coffee-gourmand, so I can't tell if the coffee is the best, but I personally like it very much. (Food I don't know, haven't tried yet, but seem very yummy.)\n7.

I love the coffee bar set-up, makes the 'coffee dance' much easier. Nice warm, homey feel to the iinside, seems like something you'd find in Oregon for some reason. I've had the same two employees every time and every time they have been incredibly nice. Fast, and though I've only had bagels there, they were well toasted (you'd be amazed how many laces can't seem to 'toast' anything properly).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-13", "description": "Humble, unassuming cafe, with decent coffee & free wireless (OK, maybe the pastries aren't so nice).  They do a good breakfast sandwich, which is very reasonably-priced.  Because of its location, it tends to be free of the crowds which usually infest other cafes in the Haight/Divisadero area, and is completely devoid of the hipster pretense & bullshit of cafes in the Mission.  It is a pleasant place to sit down with your computer for a few hours & chill.  The space is large enough that they could offer live acoustic music a couple of evenings a week, and this would be a welcome addition.  I'd give them 4 stars if their pastries were better.  They should drop their current supplier, and get them from Delessio's, across the street.  Apart from the pastries, it's a nice little cafe, with a lot of potential.", "author": "Eric H."}

The flavor grew on me, but I'm not a fan.  Chai Babba Chai is the best!  The service was cool and the place was two stories (love it) and quite sunny for an early morning. There was a bathroom that was obviously painted by one of those people who looks at Pollock and says \"I could do that!\" and then proves to everyone that you actually DO need talent to paint.. anything.

On a Saturday morning, the upstairs is uncrowded and silent, making it a great place to have a quiet talk with friends or study.
