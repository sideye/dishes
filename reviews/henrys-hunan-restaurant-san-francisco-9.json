The food here is amazing, and even better - there is relatively easy-to-find street parking! I think my favorite Henry's dishes are a little bit better at the North Beach location, but it is honestly very hard to tell the difference.\n\nMy most recommended dishes are the Ma Po tofu and the Dianna's Special Meat Pie, which both have the excellent Henry's special meat sauce. You can't eat here without getting at least one dish with this savory, spicy meat sauce. It is unlike anything I have ever tasted before. The Smoked Ham and Green Beans are another go-to dish. The meat is very flavorful and the green beans are cooked along with the smoked meat, making them the best tasting vegetable I have ever eaten. The Hot and Sour soup is also great and easy to share with a group of 3-5 people. \n\nDon't be afraid of ordering too much - the leftovers still taste amazing!", "author": "Haixing K."}

I got the Henry's special, someone else got the fried rice, and someone else got hunan orange sauce chicken. Now this orange chicken was probably one of the best I have had. Lightly breaded and saucy enough without being heavy. So good!!! There was more ordered but I do not remember. It was technically served family style but we ate our own for the most part.

It's so highly regarded in the extraordinary that this Bay Area treasure has been highlighted as a New Yorker magazine favorite, and as long as the menu never changes its reputation will never cease as a community foodie tabernacle. What should you order? Well, the idea is to come with at least four family members and then order about six dishes (take the rest home, who gets the rest is a problem for later), and if you love smoked ham go Marty's Special, if you love spicy chicken and shrimp go Henry's Special, and if you love chow mein -- you better love chow mein, it's never better anywhere else!

They seem completely unrelated anymore. \n\nI love over-ordering here so I can take some home for the next couple of days. Take a Dianna's Meat Pie home for tonight! Delicious hot or cold!\n\nWhen I first came to SF 38 years ago, I found Henry's Hunan in a San Francisco guidebook and their original Kearny St. location, then Sansome St. location, quickly become my #1 favorite go-to place for a great lunch! Dinner is good too, but sometimes I find myself overindulging, so I prefer lunch here. The food is the same. I am soooooo glad they opened a location out on Church Street.\n\nTry the Hunan Ribs, too, they come with a black bean sauce that is rich and delicious. Marty's Special, Garlic Chicken, Shrimp and Green Beans... all so very satisfying. And the food comes piping hot, bright with flavors and shining colors that are a feast for eyes. \n\nDarn it!

This is the worst Chinese food I have EVER EVER EVER experienced, and the worst overall restaurant experience I have EVER had. \n\nThe service was bad. Had to get our own menu's off of the counter. \"Waitress\" / \"manager\" / \"owner\" lady  had the look of \"I have better things to do\", like jotting down the phoned in delivery orders.  Had to get up with a water glass and ask for more water. \n\no  Chow Mein - seemed like the over-sized mushy noodles were fried in abundant RANCID oil (greasy)\n\no  Garlic Chicken - overcome by an abundant supply of under cooked carrot slices, and skimpy chicken pieces, a SMALL wisper of garlic\n\no  Egg plant salad  - ODD, slices of overcooked egg plant drowned in a soy sauce/sesame oil bath\n\nAfter a taste of each, I could not eat these dishes. My honey had the same reaction. He nor I are super picky eaters. As we get ready to leave a new \"waiter\" appears who looks like he had just been washing dishes, and asks if we would like to take home the \"leftovers\".  99% of what they served remained on the plates.  We decline. He looks puzzled, and turns around and walks away, w/o removing the bad food from the table. NO inquiry as to why we didn't eat what we ordered and are paying for. \n\nWith an over-all rating of FOUR STARS, we were drawn in.  The food and service will keep us out. I know that some of the other Henry's Hunan chain locations (SOMA etc.), have lines out the door and rave reviews. Good for them. This experience was REALLY BAD for me.", "author": "Matsuo U."}

The Mongolian beef that several people mentioned was the best they ever had, probably never ate it at an authentic Chinese restaurant were diners were mostly Chinese, as the sauce was in no way resembled this classic dish, which was heavily sprinkled with pepper flakes (but still had no heat to it) instead of using actual chili peppers and did not use the cellophane crispy noodles either. \n\nAs mentioned in a few reviews, some dishes tasted a bit over salted.

The squid in black bean sauce is lovely. Marty's special has huge scallops and chicken in it. When I could eat wheat, the cold chicken salad was one of my favorites. \n\nOne thing that you must bear in mind when you judge food is not only are some tastes acquired, but textures are too. (I'm rebutting the arguments of my friends.) The ma po tofu has extra soft tofu combined with a spicy meat sauce. The country vegetable are one of my favorites, but another person might think the dish to be oily. Actually, it isn't. Cellophane noodles shed a bit while cooking and add an unctuous quality to sauces. Asian long beans are not long green beans. If you order the green beans and think them a bit stringy, that's just the way they are. I like bamboo shoots.

I had not eaten in a Chinese restaurant in nine years due to fear of contamination (regular soy sauce contains wheat gluten). In the past two weeks I've ordered take-out here three times and each time the food was GF and delicious. The staff know what you're talking about when you ask for your order to be made gluten free, which is comforting when there is a language difference between you and the people making your food. \n\nAside from being GF, I think this is some tasty food -- and cheap! For one order I can feed myself dinner for three nights.

Henry Hunan Restaurant is definitely on my return list.\n\nAfter a night full of wine and champagne for the New Years, I had a sudden and insatiable craving for Chinese food. I started off with hot and sour soup ~ which was a bit too thick for my tastes but definitely had a kick of sour. It had small flecks of dried red pepper which went well with the green onions and bamboo shoots. As sucker for mappo tofu, I decided to go with the bean curd with meat sauce lunch special for my main course. It pretty much hit the spot - spicy, thick, and flavorful.

This place must cater to non-Asian clientele.  So disappointed with this restaurant.  I've been to other Henry's and have not been disappointed.  \n\nThe Mu Si (sic) vegetable is 90% cabbage.  It was missing everything else: eggs, mushrooms, bean sprouts, onion, ginger, garlic, vinegar.  No flavor w/o the Hoisin sauce. The shrimp chow mein was good but again, cabbage is provided instead of a Chinese vegetable, and not much flavor.  Where was the soy sauce?  I shouldn't need to use it in a Hunan restaurant, and couldn't because it was nowhere to be found.  The won ton soup was good enough.  I suspect that the dishes in general have no flavor without the hot peppers.  There certainly was no natural spices.  If you want a \"Henry's\", go to the one in the Financial District.

We shared the green onion pancake, hot and sour soup, and garlic chicken. The pancake wasn't quite what I had in mine - much thinner than the pancakes that I'm used to. Hot and sour soup was solid, nothing incredibly amazing, but not bad either. The garlic chicken was great - chicken wasn't dry, but cooked perfectly. It's a stir fry with lots of carrots - get ready for that! The service was great too (for a Chinese restaurant, where the norm is that waiters are rude and will only speak with you twice.. when you order and when you need the bill). Overall, I'd definitely come here again... it's a very solid (somewhat Americanized) Chinese food place.

So I found this place on Yelp. We arrived 45 minutes before closing time.\n\nWe were immediately greeted by a man who I think is the owner. I was pleasantly surprised by the decor - modern, high ceilings, pendulum lighting, a bit lofty. Unusual for a Chinese joint. \n\nThen I read their food philosophy, tucked in the back of the menu, which stated that they minimize the use of sodium, avoid MSG and are dedicated to making the healthiest, best tasting Chinese food possible. \n\nSo we ordered...\n\nWon ton soup: Simple and tasty. I loved that the broth was not overly salty, although I did add a bit of chili sauce for extra spice. And the won ton dumpings had generous portions of meat.\n\nPrawn fried rice: Fluffy and not overfried like other places. I could actually taste the scrambled egg, green onions, prawns and carrots because they weren't inundated with salt or soy sauce. This proves that salt does not equal flavor. Salt just masks poor cooking. But the ingredients in this dish spoke for themselves. Score!\n\nOrange glaze chicken w/ peppers: I liked that the chicken was moist and not deep fried. The orange flavor was good but I wished it has been marinated into the chicken better, rather than being poured on top. I'd try a different dish next time - this one was just OK.\n\nDuring our visit, a handful of folks came in to pick up their take-out. The owner seemed to recognize them all. I notice when restaurants have alot of regulars because it indicates a consistent dining experience, not to mention good service. \n\nOverall I'd rate them 4 stars for service, 3 stars for food.", "author": "Mariela D."}

Nothing of the restaurant from its appearance indicates that it could be good: the name of the restaurant, the style of cuisine (Hunan = Chinese American, 99.9% of the time), location (Noe Vally, not Sunset/Richmond), lack of Chinese on the menu....and yet, it is actually good. \n\nMy recommendations:\nThe \"meat pie\" appetizer which is actually scallion pancakes with shredded cabbage and pork in it. The harvest pork and Henry's shredded pork are both very unique & divine pork dishes. You will not find them elsewhere unless it's another authentic Hunan restaurant!\n\nNot so recommended: smoked ham dishes. Alas, they were too salty for my taste.\n\nGeneral comment:\n\nThe food here has a homey quality (despite not being from Hunan myself). The service is friendly, ambiance is surprisingly...un-Chinese, and the price is ridiculously cheap considering it's in Noe Valley. Only set back may be...the style of the food here is heavily spiced, so it's always going to be a bit of the spicy & salty side.

I showed up 25 minutes later, thinking that as it was Chinese it would surely be ready.  I was in the middle of watching Colorado play their first football game of the year, so I was anxious to make it a quick trip.  It was not.  I got their and sat at your bar (no TV) waiting for 20 minutes.  \n\nA few suggestions:\n\n1) I'm fine if it's going to take 45 minutes, just tell me and I will show up 45 minutes after I order.  You're happy.  I'm happy.\n\n2) If I do show up after twenty minutes and you know I will be standing there for twenty minutes, pour me a half beer or a half glass of wine on the house.  An impatient customer will suddenly love you and not mind the wait.  Believe me, it works.\n\n3) Tell me how long it will be once I am there if you don't have the info when I call.  Don't just tell me every two minutes ten times in a row that it will be ready soon.  I live a block away.  I can come back in 20.  I'd rather be hurt by the truth than happy with a lie.\n\nThat said, your food was awesome and I liked seeing your cooks prepare the food on a sweet wok, home style.  Your food was fresh, not too fried; far superior to both Alice's and Eric's.  Despite the long wait I will come back, just 40 minutes after I order next time.  And If I show up 20 mins before the order is ready, hit me with a half beer, please.  I will love you.\n\nAgain, really good Chinese - best I've had in Noe.\n\nJohny", "author": "Johny X."}

Hunan Velvet Chicken, a brilliant option if you're *not* in the mood for spicey, is a lovely, well rounded dish with a delicate sauce that highlights the flavors of all the vegetables and the chicken. Henry's special, with its paella-like mixture of scallops, chicken, vegetables, spicey peppers (adjustable, to your order!) and sauce is a rich dip into an old Hunan tradition. Harvest Pork, my favorite dish on the menu, has a story behind it (read the menu!), fills the belly and delights the palate.\n\nHenry's Hunan is a great stop for lunch, a wonderful locale for dinner and, if you plan ahead like we did, a great place for a celebratory lunch for 14.", "author": "Steven H."}

I also ordered the dumpling appetizer and have to admit they were just OK....the raves had me expecting something amazing but they were just yummy potstickers.\n\nI also tried the Chicken Salad, which was like a combination between Pad Thai and Chinese Chicken salad - kind of unusual for a Chinese restaurant but a light and refreshing treat.\n\nFinally, I ordered the sauteed deluxe vegetables which no one on Yelp has mentioned yet. I ate kind of poorly this weekend and felt like I needed some vegetables in my life. WOW! They tasted like someone had thrown them on the habachi first and then sauteed them...a really nice, grilled flavor.

What amazed me the most was the portion sizes, for the price, humongous. There was so much leftover, we had enough to feed three more people easily. I do not know if the same size of food is delivered when you order out but I will try that next time.\n\nMy one disappointment was that \"medium spicy\" was not spicy at all, I honestly thought that they forgot to put any spice in whatsoever, next time I will definitely order \"hot\" or \"extra hot\" to get some heat going in the dish.\n\nAll in all, we were extremely pleased to find and try Henry's Hunan, it's got large, quality portions and it tastes good (other than the spice factor) and it's all for a pretty good price (Five dishes + two drinks = $42.00).

We walked in and were greeted with smiles and a restaurant filled with natural light. We sat down and were immediately served a steaming pot of tea and two bowls of hot & sour soup--which was perfectly balanced and delicious. We ordered our lunch specials, me the shrimp & broccoli and boyfriend the beef with vegetables. It came out quickly, along with the little salad my dish came with, and it was wolfed down even more quickly. The sauce wasn't too heavy and the spices were perfect. The shrimp were heavenly and there were plenty of them. Broccoli was bright and fresh. I also loved the dishware! Jesus I sound like such a nerd.

SO good, i love it.  and fun fact - i don't like eating leftovers, particularly chinese leftovers, because it gives me the feeling of eating an abundance of grease and msg.  it's not a nice feeling.  but i kind of pigged out on this.  and!  it has pineapples!  PINEAPPLES.  ridiculous!  but oh-so-perfect.  i'm willing to bet that if you had this baby sitting in the refrigerator for a couple of days, it'd still taste like gold when you finally took it out.\n\nanyway, yeah.  if i could kidnap an entire restaurant, i would.  (and they serve brown rice.  uh, yes, please.)  the service was friendly, and i had a really nice experience here.  i don't know what it'd be like if i came here on a busy day, but if the service is just as friendly, waiting for my food wouldn't be an issue (as it seems to be based on other reviews).  maybe i'm too early to be biased, but is it really too early to be anything?\n\nwhatever~ i'll be back! :)", "author": "Ashley F."}

When they came to deliver, they were like chipper-skippers. \n\nFast forward a week and we ordered again (the same thing). This time, my boyfriend blanked and forgot that he didn't have any cash. So instead of the delivery guy (he's so nice!) getting mad, he just took down the cc information and chatted with us about the neighborhood and remembered us from the first order. \n\nBut seriously, the food. We get chicken and brocolli, chicken chow mein and spring rolls -- spicy if the boyfriend is up for it. It's not greasy and packed full of flavors. \n\nThis made me hungry, I will probably order tonight.", "author": "Sara W."}

When they opened up a Noe location, I was really happy 'cause I happened to live a block away at the time and it's always good to have a solid Chinese food place just around the block. \n\nMy experience with the Noe location has been as good, if not better, than the downtown location. The food is consistently good but the decor is a huge step up from the downtown location (which is a bit of a whole in the wall). I agree with some of the other reviews that the food can be on the salty side, often, which is why I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 star rating. If you have any intolerance to salt, you should be careful about what you order. That said, they have a good variety on their menu and it seems reasonably priced. \n\nSome of the wait staff is shared with the downtown location and it's always nice because they always recognize me when I walk in. The service is good. I find that the wait staff is courteous and efficient.\n\nGet the Harvest Pork!", "author": "Amit T."}

We were on the hunt for some pf-changs/panda express style chinese food, but of a greater quality and still at a decent price. We found it at Henry's Hunan. Perfect.\n\nThe menu is as you might expect, kung-pao chicken, mongolian beef, egg rolls, wonton soup, etc. etc. But the difference is that there is actually really great execution. The hot & sour soup was excellent. The curry chow mein is like a replica of singapore curry rice noodles, but in chow mein. This worked well too. Lastly, the kung pao chicken was dead on. Chicken was fresh, it was spicy, and there was plenty of actual chicken in it. Even the green tea was standard-average-great!\n\nWhat I like is just how friendly this place is. All the main entrees are around $9 and sized for sharing. The place itself is bright, with a high ceiling and modern decor. However, the room is small enough so that it still feels intimate despite those conditions. The location is great if you need to find parking (and is right next to a muni rail line as well).\n\nOverall, this is a great deal for white-people-\"chinese\"-food.", "author": "Tolga E."}

In your average establishment, you can get cheap food or good food. At Jeff & Eddie's you get both! Specifically, you'll get fresh, flavorful, and reasonably-priced southern Chinese cuisine.\n\nThe majority of the dishes are more spicy, less sugary, and perhaps less pandering to American tastes than your typical establishment. Portions are also incredibly generous, so prepare to take home leftovers! Some dishes can be too salty from time to time, but that may depend on your own tastes. For carnivores: try anything with ham in it! Harvest pork is also an excellent dish. A personal favorite is chow mein with ham. \n\nService is always great too.

I was sad to move away from Henry's, but SUPER happy they opened the Noe Valley branch close to home!  This is one of my go-to chinese restaurants.  I like how they have brown rice and they never hesitate to give me spice when I ask for spicy!  Henry's special (with scallops, shrimp and chicken with veggies - super spicy sauce) is my all time favorite dish.  I order it all the time.  When my husband and I ate her the other day, he ordered kung pao beef, which he thought was yummy too.  He also reminded me to make sure that diners know the tea cups tend to tip over rather easily (such is his only critique).  But anyways, I'll be putting the Noe Valley number on speed dial for evening pickups.  Go Henry's!", "author": "Leah S."}

Tonight, which was the second time we'd ordered from Henry's, I particularly enjoyed the meat pie. Odd, yet delicious, thin, fried bread sandwiching ground meat and some cabbage. String beans: nothing unusual. Chicken, also conventionally appealing. The house tofu, on the other hand, is like nothing I've had elsewhere, big chunks of tofu in a salty sauce. Brown rice to round it out. A good take-out option.", "author": "Tara M."}

Was helping my brother to look for a new home and we had to kill time since open house didn't start until 2pm. We were hungry and this just happened to be in the same location as the house he was interested in. Got out of the car and only saw the Hunan and didn't put it together until I opened the menu and saw Diane's meat pie. And let me say, I was excited. I haven't been to Henry's for months now and of course Henry did not disappoint me. We ordered Diane's meat pie (as you can guess) and the dumplings. Both were tasty and mmmm mm mmmm. The we ordered orange chicken and sweat n sour chicken. Of course they were mmmm mm mmmm as well. \nThe food was excellent, the place was new, price was moderate, and Eddie who was our server as well as the co-owner was fabulous and welcoming. If some luck my brother purchase that home, I'll be there often and know that great Chinese food is just a block away. The only set back is that they don't do delivery because their kitchen isn't big enough to handle the volume of orders (once again that came from Eddie)", "author": "Kathy T."}

We really wanted to like this place as it's new and close to home.  \n\nBut the food just wasn't superb.  The pot stickers tasted metallic, and a chicken dish simply didn't have any taste.  Also, they didn't quite have the kinks worked out on the dishwashing machine, as all of the glasses smelled like bleach.\n\nThe wait staff was extremely friendly, so that was a major plus.\n\nI think this was simply was opening week kinks that needed to be worked out.

It's the only Henry's location that is \"nice\", it has the real Henry's food, heck they are Henry's kids! (all grown up after what, 30 years?).\n\nYou get extras here, too - a little salad or soup, a spring roll or potsticker. \n\nAnd believe it or not, you can choose \"original style\" meat over the rice (on the rice plate lunches) or \"new style\" rice on the side. Gravy on, or gravy off? Now up to you!\n\n_________________________ original review:\n\nJust like the original Henry's in Chinatown. But a lot cleaner, a great place to take your sweetie. \"Hole in the wall\" quality Chinese food in a nice trendy looking restaurant, using top quality ingredients. Very friendly crew, with some old faces I remember from the '90's at their Sacramento location. Owned by a Henry relative.\n\nOh - I got hit with an extra salty dish last time. Next time I'll ask them to watch the salt! Most of the time its fine....", "author": "MDubb W."}

The soup was fresh, authentic, not too salty (altho some might have been put off by the amount of eggwhite). The cold cucumber & lettuce salad was spot on. We ordered just one more thing, which was an enteee of precooked pork and cabbage and scallion (Harvest Pork I believe it was called).  Clean, fresh, very tasty, and abundant. This is the restaurant you want in your neighborhood as the world slides into a deep and scathing recession -- total bill for two people walking out very satisfied with a Tsingtao under the belt and a proprietor shaking our hand was $37. ..

They commented several times, \"Why haven't you brought us here before?\"  I love that the food suits many tastes. from hot and spicy, my favorite, to mild yet still flavorful.  My mother doesn't like spicy, my sister must have it as hot as she can stand and my best friend's a vegetarian while I just love the tofu and meat sauce with or on anything.
