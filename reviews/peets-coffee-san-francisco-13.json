The javivas were the first to go, they come out syrupy sweet and liquid - no icy body like I get from other locations and prefer.\nLast visit with coworkers one was charged for soymilk, told by the person making her coffee that was incorrect, then put through a ten minute long process for some sort of compensation for approximately 60 cents. While that's happening, several other drinks are made before my no frills small nonfat latte. When they finally call my name it's a medium. I ordered a small for a reason. Giving me a bunch of extra milk calories is not an appropriate compensation for making all three of us late back to work.\nToday I watched in disbelief while my no frills small nonfat latte cup appeared to be pumped with chocolate syrup I didn't order. To top it off, the coffee is so unbelievably hot that I scalded my mouth trying to figure out if my eyes had deceived me on the chocolate and still cant drink it ten minutes later back at my desk.\nI'm tired of not trusting the staff here to get it right, and they all seem frazzled and simultaneously sluggish, and even the sparkling employee I've known for the last two years seems downtrodden and lacking in his normal joviality. Whatever is wrong here -new management or corporate changes or just bad hiring - please address it, you guys used to be great.", "author": "Leslie C."}

I did not receive the same friendly, bubbly greeting that 'regular' customers receive. The person who took my order seemed bored, even impatient with me as I ordered. I completed my order (simple, no special requests, just a mocha and a pastry). I checked-in using the Peet's app. For the very next person the cashier was super friendly and animated, calling the person by name before they even got to the counter. I don't expect to be treated like the cashier's best friend, but at least be nice and don't be so obvious about your preference for 'regulars'.\n\nNext, I ordered a ham and swiss croissant. I took it to my office to eat and found a piece of plastic bag (approx 1/2 in x 1/2 in) inside the croissant. I'm pretty sure that Peet's does not bake onsite so it's the fault of the supplier/bakery. I'm just glad I found the plastic and didn't swallow it.", "author": "Buster D."}

That's why when I heard about this Books, Inc./Peets combo, I decided to visit. When I first arrived, I noticed the shattered glass door on the Peets-side of the building; it was haphazardly covered with masking tape. I decided to visit the bookstore first, perhaps to get a fresh start and experience the walkway between the two.\n\nAfter browsing the store for a minute, I made my way to Peets through the connecting walkway, which curiously had chairs and tables placed in it. I scooted by an additional clutter of chairs and tables at the entrance as I made my way to the counter. I stood within the unnecessary TSA-style line control barrier and waited to order. Curiously, the vast space dedicated to ordering drinks dwarfed the clutter of work space shoved next to the entrance. I finally got my coffee (which was fine) and went back to the entrance area to sit down. \n\nThe glare of the tall building across the street obscured my view, but perhaps it was a good thing to not stare directly at the space around me. I suddenly felt ill by the decor, which was a persistent theme of dark brown, framed by light brown--the walls, the counter, the tables, everything seems to have this theme. As a bonus, the table's granite-like top matched the counter's. My table was positioned right next to the restroom, so I had the pleasure of hearing the toilet flush and the loud jet-engine powered hand-dryer go off a dozen or so times during my visit. This was paired with the cranky and clunky sounds of coffee machinery in the back. \n\nIt was time to leave. I carefully placed my empty coffee cup on top of the overflowing trash can, stepped over a dirty brown mat, and carefully opened the broken glass door to avoid any shards of glass. I survived.\n\nThis wasn't the best experience, but hey, maybe it's because i'm not a big fan of Peets.", "author": "Behnam S."}

They use a high tech system where u have to scan a paper bar code to gain entry. I asked to use the restroom first to a non cashier who said she was too busy to give me a paper scan code. I then stood in front of her for over a minute waiting for a cashier who then told me I needed to buy something first. I then explained that I don't want to bring my food into the restroom I will order after. He gives me a paper code then I discover that at 9 am they have no seat covers or toilet paper. I inform them of this and a light skinned shorter woman who says she is the manager says yeah we gotta go to Walgreens. Ok so why not convey that to your employees and I wouldn't have been wasting my time standing there and the first employee could have told me it's out of order? Now I'm waiting in line for coffee and I see her bring toilet paper from the back? She sees me in line and says nothing. Ok I order my coffee and sandwich and get issued another scan code. Now while I am using the restroom the door opens automatically. I mean alllllll the way open because it is computerized. I walk out after and explain to her what happened. No sorry for our computer error or anything just a blank stare and ok. I see that the employees are nice to each other but extremely inconvenienced by a customer asking anything. Had the same observation yesterday. I'll go back to Philz tomorrow.

The only hiccup was a verbal altercation between two patrons. One was on a cell phone and the other berating him for doing so.  The manager aptly requested the patron to end his call but ended up later calling the police at the request of the woman who was berating the caller. The caller was handcuffed outside the establishment - I still do not know the reason. While the rest of us thought that the incident had ended, the berating patron - whom originally was making way more noise/commotion than the caller - continued to do so as she \"spoke\" (more shouted) to another patron about how right she was in asking Pete's employees to call the police and how much the caller deserved being taken to jail. She was making so much of a commotion that it prompted 2 other patrons and me to leave Pete's.  Only after our exit the employees asked the berating woman to stop being loud.  If it would have been me, she and not the caller should have left Pete's.", "author": "Francisco O."}

Also, there is an issue with the peets paper cups, which leaks when the cover is fully on.

This means the actual design of the cup us defective. I had wet hands and drips on jackets the last few weeks and is fed up. I tried to tell the\"manager\" lady, but you proceed to condescendingly tell me you see this seam? It leaks if you put the lid like this. Hello?! It's your barista who put it like this! Plus I already know the issue and was trying to point out this shouldn't be an expected default in your business. I don't walk down the street in a philz or Starbucks cup with this issue.

What is the point of having a coffee on the go when it is all over you by the time you catch the bus. \n\nI miss the old folks at peets and do not enjoy the new people poker faced and condescending tones.

The baristas here are very friendly and knowledgeable about the freshest roasts or promotions Peet's currently offers. I will usually come in and purchase a $25 gift card and enjoy my free medium drink while chatting with friends or getting some reading done. On subsequent visits, I'll use that same gift card to buy some Sumatra or Arabian Mocha Java coffee beans, ground for the French Press. I especially enjoy very strong, full-bodied, and smooth coffees. What a perfect coincidence that all of Peet's coffees are pure arabica beans with their well-known strong, dark roast. It's become a daily ritual of mine to start my mornings with a pastry and French Press coffee. Purchasing coffee beans here nets you a free small cup of their delicious freshly brewed coffee (or you can opt for a coupon to redeem on your next visit). I usually keep it simple here with a soy latte. Mmm so creamy and smooth! Costs for high-grade green, unroasted beans have been steadily increasing the past couple of years. I remember Sumatra used to be $12.95/lb a few short years ago, but now costs $14.95/lb. That doesn't deter me one bit though since it's still cheaper to brew my own.

Yea it's busy that's good for business but for a customer who wants to chill, that sucks, people always saying excuse me. One of the times had a coffee silt on me . . .", "author": "Robert C."}

Don't listen to the crap about the \"bad neighborhood\" and the crackheads--anybody who spends 5 minutes in Civic Center can appreciate the wide sidewalk in front, and can dodge/divert/ditch the occasional menace.  The government employees from the state and feds clog the joint all day long, but they are docile and mean you no harm.  Don't make eye contact with them and you will be fine.", "author": "Rusty M."}

My biggest complaint is the service is very slow. They have some very nice people working there but come on it shouldn't take 5 minutes to get a brewed coffee. The store carries everything you would find at any other Peet's.", "author": "Teddy d."}

Yeah the neighborhood is a bit sketch but hey that's the civic center area for ya.  I've grown up on Starbucks so took me a while to adjust to the strength of their coffee, but after the initial shock I must say I'll never go back.  They may not have frappucinos but the make a mean mocha.  They work hard to protect their customers from the crack heads outside and I've seen them go above and beyond for that unruly customer. Love that Book's Inc. is right next door and I love to peruse the books whilst I wait for my girl to get off work.  Stop by and say hi, they're the nicest bunch around. Wouldn't suggest driving there tho, many a car have suffered from broken windshields etc...from the desperate crack head around the car, take MUNI or walk.", "author": "Marie B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-24", "description": "The coffee and espresso drinks are usually great, although sometimes they can be a little off.  The teas and pastries available are decent, though nothing special.  Service is usually pretty fast.  Many of the employees have been working there since I started coming here over a year ago, so they know their shit and I assume that they are being treated pretty well by the business.  It's also cool that the coffeeshop is connected (not merely adjacent) to the bookstore next door.", "author": "Joseph N."}

I am actually not the biggest fan of Peet's coffee, I think it is too strong -- however, I think of the chain coffee stores they have the best pastry selection, especially their low-fat, low-cal stuff.  The low-fat banana blueberry muffin, scrumptious!", "author": "Katie P."}

The service appears to have improved slightly, meaning one doesn't have to wait as long through the line for good service.\n\nGreat coffee here, just like all the others.  My first time at this location, 8am in the morning on Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and there must have been 20 people in line.   Only one person was at the order counter...it wasn't until the line went out the door that two more order takers opened up.  Maybe this is a new Peets - I am sure that they will be more efficient and attentive soon - just like the others.  Though the line was long,  service (and coffee) were excellent.", "author": "Antonio E."}

I was craving a black iced coffee from Peet's and hit this place on the way north.  The weary dawn that was coated in a pointless darkness started to crack at the seams as if the morning was uncertain about the coming day.  I sipped from the cup of pitch-blackness and headed yet further north.  I met with Stan, the guy that sells sofa beds.  He saw my inky black liquid and thought immediately that he must have the same.  So, we headed back to Peets to get another caffeinated mental smog eraser.  I was starting to feel better, but wanted badly to scurry home and hide in my bed while reality fornicated loudly on the other side of my dusty curtains.  Instead, I was out here to face it all.  But at least this Peet's iced black coffee was clearing away the dreariness of the day-to-day hustle, if only for a little bit of a little while.", "author": "Kenny R."}

My last visit on this particular location I brought my dog in to order, the young lady behind the register asked right away if my dog was a service dog, I said no and thought they must not allow pets in the shop so I right away commented that ill leave right when I pay and pick up the drink when its ready. She said ok with a smile, while I took my cash out another lady said with a slight attitude that I needed to take him out now, I said ok let me just pay first, she said no now. I can understand the policies that people have to follow, but first things first is the proper customer service. I care dearly for my dog and I don't just tie him outside and leave him where all the dope heads hang out. The problem I had was the approach, a different way to say and deliver the message then just taking him out now? No matter what, I am the customer you are the associate, its my day off and its your paying shift. I was disappointed but not upset, ill just never go to this location again. I waited outside with my dog and maybe thought that the barista would just walk out and give me my drink, 5 minutes later nothing came out. I waited another 2 minutes and was sure that my drink was done. How can I get my drink inside if I can't bring my dog? Luckily a nice couple that walked by with the same dog I have greeted me and my pet. They tied their dog to the tree and were about walk in the shop. I asked if they would get my drink while I wait here with the dogs, they said yes ofcourse! The gentlemen walked out with my drink and asked if I needed anything in the coffee, I said thank you no, this is perfect.", "author": "Jireh S."}
