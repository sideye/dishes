I've read a lot of the other reviews and there seem to be some ethical discrepancies in terms of skewed reviews. I'm not sure if they're true (I wasn't aware of the 15% discount thing until I read the Yelp reviews), or if the restaurant is responsible for the hacked account. Maybe they've also gotten better, but I would definitely advise you to be cautious anyway and maybe pay with cash to be extra careful. If it happens to be true that someone's account was hacked/a 15% discount is given to 5 star reviews, please please to the restaurant: you don't need bribery or sketchy business practices to support you. You have an adorable shop with great food and good service. You can be a 5 star place on Yelp on your own merits!\n\n**********ACTUAL REVIEW**********\n\nNow, for our experience: the food came fast! This place is super cute on the inside and they play good, chill music. We got the tiramisu, strawberry shortcake mini toast, and the s'mores half-waffle. The s'mores waffle had nutella on it and it was exactly what you'd want it to be (absolutely delicious with big fluffy marshmallows). The toast tasted like toast and jam at breakfast only 100x better! The tiramisu had a good texture and was enjoyable. It wasn't the best tiramisu ever, but that's okay because this isn't an Italian restaurant. I also had the rose latte which was pretty good, and very foamy (definitely instagrammable).", "author": "Claire C."}

We walked into the restaurant excited about the dessert that I spare a portion of our stomach for after a big dinner. The shop was rather small and snuggle, with barely any space to stand. That was okay, because another group of 3-4 people waited outside in the cold, while we did not. \n\nWe ordered the hot tofu, to warm up our happy heart. The waitress said we needed to wait 15 minutes because the dish ran out. We agreed to wait while signing up on the waitlist and stepped outside into our car to wait. The next wait did not go long; she called us in within 3 minutes. \n\nAlthough one thing I personally rather pissed about didn't come from the service itself but the etiquette of the customers. Many tables finished and paid, however, they superglued their butt onto the seats and didn't leave, while others waited for their turn to eat. Like I said, the shop is little so after you eat and enjoy your food, leave and let others enjoy theirs too. Don't stay in your selfish shell and ignore others' suffers. \n\nMy mom makes delicious soft tahu (tofu) and I like to compare those I bought to hers. To my expectation, anything I bought is worse than my mom's. There isn't ginger nor caramelized syrup. This soft tofu consists of solely tofu and nothing else. For $5, I bet they profited about $4 from it. I think another reason why it costs so much for so little is the cute container it comes in (which I cannot take with me). Deceiving the eyes, any pictures here, that does not compare the container to their hand, makes the the portion looks huge like around 6-7 inches. It's smaller than a bowl, I'm telling you. I didn't order their toast because it was cold but I thought they looked pretty tasty. Anyway, I may come back to try something else but the tofu.", "author": "Trinny T."}

The menu us quite extensive and has both sweet and savory options, so chances are you'll find something for every tastebud.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n1/2 Stars for Taste --\nThe desserts here aren't anything to write home about, but they're decent. My favorite is the hot almond soup with black rice -- the perfect dessert on a cold day if you don't want something too sweet. The brick toast is also good, though I've only tried the mango pyramid toast. It's cubes of thick toast, buttered and griddled so it's crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside, then generously slathered in sweet cream and syrup then topped with a scoop of ice cream. Sweetness overload for those cheat days. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\nThe drinks and desserts are slightly overpriced but that's understandable considering it's a sit-down establishment. Most milk teas will probably run you around $5 and a brick toast will be closer to $10. Also, they charge $.30 to use a credit card.\n\n0.5/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nThis place gets kind of busy and it's usually run by only one or two people at a time. Sometimes it's hard to get the server's attention, but generally the food comes quick. \n\nBonus star because this is my go-to place after dinner when friends are visiting and we want to find somewhere to sit and catch up.", "author": "Abby W."}

Sure, the walls are candy pink and they have popular Taiwanese/Hong Kongese snacks and desserts like brick toast and popcorn chicken, but eh. It's a tiny joint that feels stuffy (especially with the way the owner/host stares at every table while they eat from the back) with some shady policies.\n\nIf there's a table when you get there, they sit you down and hand you your menus and a pitcher of water right away. A couple that got there right after we did were asked to wait, and the host shuttled them into a sterile white hallway to the side of the main dining room and closed the door on them. Um, sketchy much?\n\nWe split the mini macaron chocolate brick toast, partially because my boyfriend insisted he could not fit any more food in him after Tasty Pot, and partially because I couldn't justify paying over ten dollars for a couple slices of toast and a scoop of ice cream. The two macarons that adorned the top (chocolate and matcha, I think) were soft and perfectly bite-sized, and the scoop of chocolate ice cream was delicious. The toast just didn't stand out, even with the addition of fresh strawberries. So continues the hunt for a good brick toast in the city.\n\nAt the table, a small menu stand indicates that if you check in and leave them a 5 star review, you can get 15% off your bill or a future bill. That's against Yelp policy, last I checked. We realized as we were eating that it would have been cheaper to build the same brick toast, and add some condensed milk or whip cream for about the same cost. I doubt it's a good value for what you're paying, and I think the only people who'd really enjoy it are the ones who don't mind someone staring at them intensely while they eat a waffle..", "author": "Gwen W."}

It was store bought, freezer burned crap. Took one bite full of ice crystals and slop and pushed it aside. \n\nOrdered mango sago, almond sago, sweet tofu (tofu fa), and strawberry honey toast. Sago seem to be standard. Honey toast could have been sweeter with more honey. Not the best, but edible. The sweet tofu wasn't very sweet, even with extra syrup.

The ambience was slightly dim. I think they were trying to capture or match their menu to their walls, which was a little cute if I say so myself.

Once we finally got the service that we were asking for, we ordered their tea, mango pyramid toast, and their mango black sticky rice covered with coconut milk. \n\nUnfortunately, the pictures did not with stand the flavor of their desserts. Pictures here on Yelp were much better than the way the desserts tasted. First of all, the tea came out not hot at all. The mango black sticky rice with coconut milk had NO flavor (I don't know if it was suppose to be like that). I was slightly enlightened with the mango pyramid Toast, until I tasted the mango ice cream. I can clearly and definitely tell you, that is NOT mango ice cream. That was the most artificial mango tasting ice cream I have ever tasted! It was a bit depressing because it looked so pretty in pictures and once you tasted it, only the toasted tasted good. Not great, just good. \n\nOverall, I sadly have to only give this place a three star because of the wait and the taste.

The walk up to this place seemed pretty normal, but as soon as I turned around and my retinas were bombarded by the color pink.  I visited this pink establishment on a Wednesday night and was immediately seated.  We ordered the green tea ice cream pyramid toast.  It was very good; the toast cubes were perfect for absorbing the whipped cream mixed with green tea ice cream.  The presentation was great and was perfect for those who have to take a picture of every plate of food they devour. My only complaint was that the amount of ice cream for this massive pyramid was too small to accompany the cube toast.  Other than that, I would definitely come back to try other flavors and other items on the menu.", "author": "Alex J."}

I used to live in the South Bay and brick toast was quite plentiful. In San Francisco, it's still taking its time to build roots. It was really yummy! I ordered the Tiramisu in regular, large enough for two to share. It wasn't overly sweet and textures were good, bread wasn't overly toasted. The piece of tiramisu that was on top was kind of disappointing. It didn't taste fresh or authentic. \n\nThe other dessert I ordered was the tofu fa. It's prepared fresh so it takes some time to come out. It has a hint of coconut in it, which is so delicious!! It is served with brown sugar so the sweetness is adjustable to your taste! \n\nThe service is average, no big deal. Be initiative to what you need and make it clear to servers what you want. \n\nNote: bathroom is a journey's away. I bet finding the wizard of oz was easier than finding this bathroom.

After always passing by it and deciding whether it was really worth it to come here for dessert. It was pretty empty when I went, granted it was a school night. The seats in the booth though, they provide great back and butt support, especially after you indulge yourself with bite after bite of sweet desserts. Also, if you order over $20 of food, you can get either their Belgium waffle with Nutella and marshmallow, or a mini banana split. I tried the watermelon sago, tiramisu honey toast, and their free Belgium waffle w/Nutella and marshmallow. \n\nWatermelon sago: you can't really go wrong with this. Sweet watermelon juice with a generous amount of sago at the bottom. Although I would recommend getting it with mixed fruit too because it tastes adds a lot more taste and texture.\n\nTiramisu honey toast: the presentation was actually pretty neat. They smeared \"Etc\" in chocolate on the edge of the plate, along with a honey toast topped with a scoop of ice cream, a slice of tiramisu cake, drizzled with chocolate. This dish is pretty sweet, so make sure you have a large sweet tooth before tackling on this dish. I only wish it was bigger, seeing as the smaller size cost $7.50. Other than that, no complaints about it. You can't really complain about warm honey toast with ice cream and whipped cream.\n\nBelgium waffle w/Nutella and marshmallow: this was, by far, my favorite at this place. To you waffle lovers and you s'more lovers, strap on your seat belts and prepare for a wild ride. Combining these two was genius. If you thought Nutella on a waffle was good, get ready to add a toasted marshmallow on top, with a little whipped cream on the side. They cut them into small pieces so you can fit the whole piece in your mouth and get the whole Belgium waffle-s'mores taste. \n\nI'm glad I tried this place because it will be one of my regular asian dessert places from now on.", "author": "Ryan C."}

Other tables are just the same, with large, loud groups or just couples enjoying the atmosphere. So this place often gets crowded late, usually around 10 or 11, as people aren't leaving. The waitresses aren't the most adept at handling overcrowding or seating, so get here earlier and grab a table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-20", "description": "I really like their honey toast. They offer two sizes for it: mini (6.95) or regular (8.95)! Not many places do that. With that, they have a decent selection you can choose from (around 6-8 types!) I've had the strawberry one and tropical delight. Both were really good! They warn you on the menu that it is a 10-15 wait for the honey toast, so order it right away if you must. Good presentation, I must say.\n\nI also had their mini dessert sampler (9.95) that comes with four mini desserts: tiramisu, macau pudding, mango pudding, and a mini fruit salad. All of it was pretty decent, not really anything to hype up. Something to note was that the macau pudding was frozen.. boo.\n\nI can imagine their sago and other asian desserts are pretty good here. One of my friends had their red bean and green tea pudding which ended up to be pretty small, but he enjoyed it anyways. Next time, I'll try their waffle and ice cream desserts; those seem popular along with the honey toast. I wouldn't trust the pasta here.. which is kinda odd since it IS a dessert cafe. Stick to the dessert, hence the name!\n\nCome here on a weeknight or around 8-9pm on a friday or saturday. I've heard plenty of stories from friends that say this place is OVERLY crowded when it gets to about 11pm. Easy to find parking at night because everything's metered. And as of service, never had a bad problem here.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

That's cool.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the Strawberry Sweetheart regular size toast. It was delicious. Buttery and sweetened with honey but the flavor comes from the toppings they use. Out of all the toasts, I like the Oreo Banana and the Strawberry Sweetheart best. \n\nI decided to try the Matcha Red Bean pudding. At $4.50, I expected a juicier serving. It was in a cute little glass cup so it looked nice. Taste wise was pretty good but I was anticipating a thick and creamy pudding but this was like the lighter, jiggly puddings people put in milk tea drinks.

It was around 1am when we finished galavanting. We chose this place(that I previously BM'd), because it was open 'til 1:30am and I wanted to try honey toast(been wanting to try since I saw pics on IG). \n\nWe were rollin 8 deep in da cafe & we were crammed(really, this place is small). You can easily eavesdrop into ppl's conversations while waiting to order at the register. We were able to get a table and snag the couch/table area right across from it. We ordered a lot-- Soups, ramen, spam sandwich, smoothies, calamari, takoyaki, desserts & of course...my honey toast. Everything came out in a timely manner, except for my macaron chocolate party honey toast :( I was the last one to get my order(my friends threatened to leave me when I received my order, lol). It took more than the allotted time it said on the menu. Worth the wait? Chyeah...I think so...\n\nWhen it came out, I got excited(hooray-yay, cheers)! I had to take multiple shots and angles before my friends and I destroyed it ;) It was looking Nom-worthy. The honey toast was pretty good! Not too sweet, not too flavor lacking. Crunchy, reasonably sized, & delish. BUT they coulda gave me better looking strawberries \"/ Anywhoozies, it was pretty good for my first honey toast experience. Price could of been a tad cheaper tho. But hey, the macaron alone is already $1.50-75(compared to other bakerys I've been to). So I settled.\n\nOverall, good food/drinks, reasonably priced menu items, service was good. \"Night owl\" friendly cafe(some of us ordered more dessert after the 1:30am) & Free Wifi!(YAY). We stayed until 2am.\n\nJust a heads up, if you need to use their bathroom, I suggest not going alone. You have to ask for a key and go next door & walk up a flight of stairs. One of my guyfriends went alone and he said he felt like it was in a scene from The grudge o___O Plus, it's a Unisex bathroom and it smells *(insert stank face emoji here)\n\nCheck this place out if you're in the area and you wanna get your K-pop on and your late night dessert/snack cravings on ;D", "author": "Vicky L."}

Given that it was past midnight when we arrived, parking was not a problem but I see why this is an issue during the day. And YES there are about 9 bazillion other \"HK dessert\" type places but most of them are overpacked with fobs and screams \"Walk in so you can bump into the randomest person you've ever known in life\" but how many are open past midnight on a thursday? and aren't in the richmond district. \n+1 for fulfilling our mission\n\nFood:\nWe ordered the HK Style Imitation Fin Soup, which was pretty good and most places don't have it. I could drink this stuff all day so +1.\nThe banana split was good and they do offer a variety of ice cream flavors (but this is a pretty hard dish to butcher) As for the Ham & Egg Sandwich, the bread came out too toasty so it tasted a bit weird.\n\nService&Price:\nCash Only ! So I hope they post bigger signs stating this because we didn't see any and Yelp lied saying that they accept card. (BoFa ATMs are at the end of the block though) Luckily we did have cash & pre-tip for 5 items was around $20.\nThe Owners were really nice & props to them for being young and opening up your own business. When the waitress came to clean off the table, she saw that my friend had not eaten much of the toasted bread and asked if there was something wrong. She profusely apologized and took in our opinions. Overall though service was good and they don't stare at you with confusion after you converse in English but order in fluent Chinese. +2\n\n\nIf you're looking for something closer to the Sunset, this could be a new place to check out.

Nutella banana marshmallow toast and water. \n\nthe first thing is they gave us water and 4 cups. The water and the water bottle smelled like legitimate piss. Like they washed the bottle, closed the lid and didn't let the inside dry. It was horrible. \n\nThen when she brought out our toast she said everyone needed to spend a min of $3 dollars after 8 pm. My first question: why wasn't that mentioned when we first ordered. She said sorry and walked away. \n\nSo my friends and I ordered two more dishes to make our $12 minimum. One friend ordered fresh mango and mango ice cream. When she brought it out it was mango juice and mango ice cream. We asked her why we got mango juice instead of fresh mango when the picture clearly shows mango cut into pieces. Our server responds with \"oh in Chinese it says fresh mango juice\". While I understand that this is just poor communication, don't show mango pieces and say fresh mango and not expect people to think its mango pieces. \n\nSo we ask her if she can add the mango pieces of fruit and she says yes. We also ordered coconut milk with black rice and mango pieces and she Asks if we want hot or Cold. We asked her what was better and she responded by saying the cold was better. \n\nWe received the right mango dessert and the coconut dessert with an added scoop of mango ice cream. \n\nWhen we got the bill, not ONLY were we charged for the extra fruit BUT ALSO charged and extra dollar for the mango ice cream in coconut dessert. When I asked her to take these $3.00 dollars off since we didn't even want to spend this much on dessert. She only took off 1.50 saying that she could take off the fruit because she NEVER told us she would charge us but nothing could be done about the coconut dessert because it always comes with ice cream when it's a COLD DESSERT. WHY DIDNT YOU TELL US THAT WHEN WE ASKED YOU WHICH ONE TO PICK. \n\nNot once did the manager come out and talk to me. And at this point sorry is not enough and does not do anything. \n\nAnd the cherry on top was our server telling us that the 3.00 min charge after 8pm is on the menu: let me tell you. ITS IN 7 POINT FONT IN THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER IN BETWEEN A BUNCH OF OTHER TEXT. THAT SHOULD BE BIG AND BOLDED. \n\nBesides the SHADY and SNEAKY charges, the server was a nice girl but doesn't seem to know what she is doing. She said sorry a lot but I'm sorry sweety it doesn't help a single bit at this point. \n\nIf you wanna get ripped off by the tiny ass print and have people not help you one bit when you're pissed beyond belief this is the right place for you.", "author": "Selina Andrea S."}

That probably makes me sound like a fatty, but I prefer the term \"honey toast connoisseur.\"\n\nMy favorite was the Tiramisu Honey Toast, the most chocolatey of all the flavors. It came with coffee ice cream, a tiny slice of tiramisu cake, sliced strawberries, striped chocolate wafer sticks, and chocolate syrup drizzled all over.\n\nThe overall sweetest flavor was the Strawberry Sweetheart. It consisted of vanilla ice cream, strawberry slices, striped strawberry wafer sticks, and a tiny slice of New York cheesecake. Strawberry syrup and powdered sugar topped it all off.\n\nFruit lovers will enjoy the Tropical Delight. The fruits' natural sweetness paired with mango ice cream created a luscious medley without being overly sugary. It includes fresh kiwi, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, watermelon, strawberries, canned pineapple, and canned peaches.\n\nThe Matcha Green Tea Honey Toast features the refreshingly sweet combination of green tea ice cream and sweet red beans. The small pink mochi chunks and chocolate pocky sticks topped off the Japanese theme nicely.\n\nOreo cookies, cookies and cream ice cream, and banana slices come together to make the Oreo and Banana Honey Toast. It's topped with chocolate syrup and powdered sugar.\n\nThe Macaron Party was the most disappointing. It was an uninspired medley of chocolate ice cream, strawberry slices, chocolate shavings, and one lone vanilla macaron. Granted, you can add extra macarons for a dollar each, but with a name like Macaron Party, it's presumed that there would be more than one macaron.\n\nAll the honey toasts are deliciously beautiful desserts to share with family and friends, and ETC provides a cozy environment for doing exactly that!", "author": "Tanya A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-25", "description": "This is my first time at ETC cafe and the experience was good. My bf and I ordered 4 items: rose latte, full size tiramisu honey toast, full size Belgian waffle with Nutella and banana, and calamari. Rose latte came in a  cute coffee mug with a tiny spoon; however, we only finished half of the amount because it was way too sweet. We give the honey toast a 3 out of 5 because we think the honey didn't go well with the dessert. I was expecting the waffle to be crispy, but the waffle turned out to be soft and fluffy which is not I wanted. The calamari was surprisingly really good except that they used ranch instead of tartar sauce. The calamari was seasoned right and tasted fresh too. The calamari is a must when you visit ETC cafe! Highly recommended! Our waiter was friendly, polite and attentive. I give him 5 stars! I would definitely come back for fruit desserts.", "author": "Cindy W."}

The small size break toast was about $6 for one 1 inch slice of brick toast and a couple blocks of buttered toast on the sides, 1 scoop of ice cream, whip cream, fruits, cake, beans, etc. everything tasted just okay, nothing spectacular or anything, but it did give me my sugar fix for the night. \n\nService: pretty good service and friendly waitress. Every table got their own water jug which I thought was pretty cool, because usually dessert places like these have a big water jug that is self-served.\n\nAmbiance: this place has a cutesy-Disney-tiger theme.

One of the great things about this place is the fact that it's open late night. What a great concept if you asked me because most places open late night are usually fast food restaurants or drive through's which are never healthy for you anyways. But at least when you eat these desserts, you don't feel so guilty because there so darn good.\n\nAlthough it's very small when you first pull up you recognize that you're in the right place because it has blue Christmas lights sprawled out from the front windows all the way through the caf\u00e9. It's a little funky but in my opinion pretty cool because I love Christmas lights. My party and I we're given seats and the waitress came pretty quickly to take our orders. Unfortunately that was one of only two positive things that came from my time here. The second was the fact that the servings are huge. Even the small serving sizes need two people to finish.\n\nAre order took 20 minutes to reach our table which normally wouldn't be bad but the caf\u00e9 was completely empty. That is except for the staff and their friends, who seem to have their own table and clearly made themselves comfortable here. Really 20 minutes for two desserts that is insane to even think about!! If that's how long it takes to make two desserts in an empty cafe, I wonder how you guys even stay open.\n\nRegardless when I got my Oreo honey toast dessert it was great. It was light and fluffy and when the ice cream began to melt, it flowed and covered the toast in sweet goodness. As I wipe the drool from my mouth just thinking of how good it was, haha...I then realize that it began to go down hill even worst after that. So after we finished out food, it took another 20 minutes for our waitress to come back to our table to check up on us. That's 40 minutes of waiting time in between our desert. It seems the waitresses were too busy having fun with their friends to even come and check up on us. \n\nAlthough I know it was late at night you still have customers and they should always be top priority especially when we're paying for our food. Overall great food for service just something to really think about before you come here. Maybe it could've been an off evening for the staff but at the end of the day, customers should always take priority over anything. But that's just my opinion!", "author": "Donald W."}

Such a large piece of toast, how can I eat it gracefully? Usually if I hang with my bros I wouldn't mind \"how\" to eat my food, but this time I was with my girlfriend and her sisters so I did not want to eat like a cave man. I trembled with fear.\n\nWhen the toast arrived, I was very pleased to find out that the toast is actually cut into small pieces so it is very easy to eat. I scooped up a piece of toast and put some ice cream on it, and the taste was heavenly. It was a little crunchy, a little honey sweet, and covered with cool, ice creamy flavor. It's very different from your typical ice cream.\n\nMake sure you split your honey toast with friends, it's too much for one person. \n\nEventually, conversation got boring, and the waitress lend us cards to play with. The service was awesome and it was a great place to hang out after dinner. I recommend it.", "author": "Song Z."}

Definitely go with their smaller size order, which will give you the same amount of topping with a smaller more proportionate toast.\n-Avocado Smoothie ($3.50): not as avocadoey as I've had and like. Almost like they blended a little too much ice into it and diluted it. Still good and refreshing though!\n-Honey Chicken Mushroom Pasta ($7-8?): healthy serving of chicken served hot with the creamy pasta.

After asking her to refill our tea, I didn't have to ask again the rest of the night. She came over and refilled it fairly often!\n\nHere is what I tasted/ordered:\n\nTri Berry Toast ($8.95): I thought this toast was good for two, but when the lady started to give us plates with tongs and forks... I was thinking, hrm... I don't want to share! When the toast came out, I was like DAMN! This dessert was HUGE! Toasted to perfection, but the downside is that they don't give enough fruit. At the end, my friend had to scrape the bottom of the plate for the toast to get some chocolate syrup and ice cream lovin. Still a good dessert item! Would come back and get it again. http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3jtVh_TAXcSjt0ZYANddLA/l.jpg\n\nWaffle with banana, strawberry and ice cream ($4.95): This was also yummy, but a bit too dense for a late night snack. Waffle was not soggy or undercooked, which is a good thing! If I wanted dessert in the day time, I would order this dish. http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/urU7A9v4Iktk3eeCF4-wZA/l.jpg\n\nTakoyaki ($4.95): you definitely get chunks of octopus, but I don't think this was really made the way takoyaki is supposed to be made. I just think this was pre-packaged and then put  into the fryer when someone orders it. My friend said he would come here again for takoyaki because not a lot of places give that much octopus pieces in each takoyaki and this place has two big pieces in each ball. http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/u82R_NPj6AGDIPUO1meKQQ/l.jpg\n\nOverall, I am a fan of this place, I would come again for their desserts!", "author": "Erica T."}

They all tasted wonderful! Looked amazing! \n\nOne downside though was that it took almost too long for the food to come out. We all got our orders at different times and since it took much much longer for some of us, the ones who got theirs first had already finished before we even got ours. Some of our orders took 10-20 mins to come out. Though they told us it might take a while, we didn't expect it to be that long. Especially when there was no other table ahead of us. \n\nGreat!

Upon entering the small but spacious cafe, your eyes will dilate to their bright white and orange interior walls while K-pop is bumpin' in your ears (due to their beautiful 46\" LED flat screen). My girlfriend didn't mind whatsoever since a couple of 2NE1 music videos were stuck on repeat.\n\nSesame Paste with Rice Balls ($4.25) - http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zKVo88dC1dvCazQCfFI46g&userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\nI'm not much of a fan of sesame paste so this dessert wasn't for me (my girlfriend's order). The rice balls wasn't as firm as I wanted it to be, resulting in a mushy texture (if you like your rice balls like that) and the paste tasted a little grainy-like. \n\nFresh Mango & Coconut Milk with Black Sticky Rice ($4.50) - http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6sjrW1eQB1tT2sbH-_uTVA&userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\nThe mangoes were fresh as stated, but there wasn't a ton of it. I know it's not in season yet so I won't dock em' for it. On the other hand, the warm black rice blended with the coconut milk created a really refreshing hot dessert.\n\nHong Kong style Waffle with Banana and Ice Cream ($4.50) - http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=X3Xj9JhEBqbyyTBruRgKCg&userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\nThe waffle was warm and fluffy, the slices of banana were drizzled with light chocolate and sweet syrup and need I mention, you get 2 scoops of ice cream! I did wish that the dessert could have been arranged together more as one instead of segregated on the plate (see picture). If placed on top of each other, the warm waffle should slowly melt away some of the ice cream while the bananas and syrups seeps into each nook and cranny of the waffle -- that's how I'd do it.\n\nETC hasn't perfected their desserts quite yet, but considering their grand opening was only a few days ago, it looks like they know what they're doing. Complimentary hot tea for all guests is a standard. ETC also serves up Chocolate Fondue set (served with mixed fruits and cotton candy) which is new to many HK-style dessert joints I've been to, so kudos! \n\nOverall, it's really affordable, not to shaby desserts for their soft opening, open late for your 4th meal shennanigans, and extremely friendly hospitality and service. I hope you like k-pop!\n\nPS: I have to add this. \nTheir restroom is not within the cafe, but actual in the next door building, up the stairs. If it's late in the night and you need to make that head call, DON'T GO ALONE!! Seriously, it's pretty dark in the building and it even gave me goosebumps while I was going (felt like a scene from the grudge).", "author": "Albert L."}

I am not an expert, but I do like that the honey toast here is better than other places I have tried, like 5 Degrees and I dare to say Honey Berry and Akihabara. It does take time because they cut out the bread, butter it up, toast and reassemble the inside back into the crispy toast shell part. It takes like 10-25 minutes depending on how busy they are, but definitely won't be a problem if you bring friends. If you are stuffed from your dinner and you come here, your stomach will be ready by the time the honey toast gets to your table. They have a nice selection of honey toast. The ice cream doesn't melt right away , which is a plus. The bread is super crunchy and the butteriness isn't too overwhelming.", "author": "Cynthia D."}

My friend ordered the black sesame paste and it was watery - it should be thicker.  Also, we ordered the waffle which we thought would be like a eaglets to share, but it was actually 2 waffle with condensed milk.  Unfortunately, the waffle were soft - prefer to be crispy.\n\nIt was a total failure and I wonder why it was empty on a Saturday night.  I mean, if you going to have a Chinese dessert place, make your desserts at least decent.  Big failure.  \n\nOne good thing was they asked what they can improve on, my friend told them.

My friend had the $5 Banana Berry waffle and she liked it for the price. \n\nNot a bad place but I see myself going over to iCrave for their waffles more. Also, to use their bathroom, you have to get a key and go out of the store and down this alley way next door. Um.... no thanks. Cash only.", "author": "Liana L."}

It's pretty tiny inside so if they did get crowded, I can only imagine the wait time. The blue lights are interesting but they're a bit too bright and can become an eyesore after a while. Unfortunately, we were seated right under the TV and it was extremely loud. All the other customers were watching it but our table hated it since it was so loud. Would be better if they placed the TV not directly over a table or lower the volume.\n\nAs for the food... I got the pancake with the assorted fruits and ice cream. It was alright, the pancake was light and fluffy. Sad thing was that it took forever to make. I think I waited almost 25-30 minutes just for my pancake. Everyone else in my group finished theirs. Weird thing was that not everything came together, everything item came on its own with 5-10 minute gaps in between. Some of them wanted to wait but we didn't want their ice or ice cream stuff to melt so we told them to start first... they ended up finishing and not just starting!\n\nMy friend got a dark chocolate fondue... she said she wasn't too impressed. They literally stuck a candle (which was pretty weak) to keep the chocolate hot. However, the flame was weak and the chocolate wasn't fully melted... so it took a while before she could start dipping. Either they need to get a better candle or lower the bowl containing the chocolate into the fire more so it melts better.\n\nMy other friend got a mango shaved ice... I tried it. It was okay, but definitely not worth a 15-20 minute wait for it. Pretty big portion though compared to other dessert places.\n\nOverall, the desserts were alright. Service was... okay. They kept coming by and apologizing and refilling our tea cups though. But with 3 workers and not much costumers to serve... I expected the food to come out faster.", "author": "Johnson S."}

Items on the menu mimic those in Asia, but I feel like it almost tries too hard to include EVERYTHING. Yeah, it'd be great if this place could master every item on its menu, but it's definitely lacking in some areas in flavor, texture, and taste. I think it would be better for them to cut down some items on their menu, and concentrate on making their desserts up to par with those in Hong Kong/Taiwan. By that time, I'm pretty sure it would attract more customers, especially in the Sunset. \n\n1. Brick Toast\nFirst time I came here, I tried their famous brick toast - forget the  name of it, but it was the one with the most fruits. I liked the texture of the toast, but both my friend and I thought that it was a bit too sweet. However, they piled on the fruits, which made it semi better :) I would get the brick toast again, but maybe in another flavor next time. The presentation looked nice also :)\n\n2. Tofu Pudding\nSecond time I came here, I was craving tofu pudding. The texture of the tofu pudding was not quite there... kind of powdery and dense, definitely not silky smooth like it's supposed to :( But the waitress (owner??) was really nice and gave me extra syrup when I wanted it to be more sweet.\n\nWould come back for dessert because it's a nice environment in their (not dirt, pretty spacious, not too loud), but I hope their desserts improve!!", "author": "Michelle L."}

They drizzle on some honey and add the toppings: whipped cream; a scoop of green tea ice cream; a generous spoonful of red bean paste; some mochi and a small strawberry cut in half to garnish. The red bean paste tastes like it's made in-house; it isn't too sweet and I love the texture (they don't puree it to crap; it's chunky and delicious)! \n\nNote that it'll take ~15 minutes for your honey toast to come out. There is a disclaimer written on the menu, so be patient! \n\nAlso, really attentive service! The young lady that helped us was so sweet and genuine.

It was a bit distracting.  The menu is quite extensive for a small place like this.  The dessert took way too long to come out (15-20mins).  When I received my strawberry with mixed fruit sago, I was a bit disappointed because it was not good.  I had higher expectations for this place but it left me in great disappointment.  Furthermore, there was only one waitress working at night which can take awhile to flag her down for the bill.", "author": "Ann L."}

I'll always go for the sofa if I have a chance. I wasn't a big fan of dessert until one of my friends brought me here. \nI love their dessert trio.  You get to try a little portion of different things. My favorite is the pyramid toast. i can't believe I finished the whole thing by myself. One thing I have to have along with anything I tried here is a hot milk tea and the shark fin soup. Perfect the way I want it. \nMy friend had a hot green tea latte And the tokayaki. She enjoyed it and wanted to order another one. Sometimes it gets a little busy but the servers were very friendly so I didn't mind a little bit of the wait.\n\nDefinitely will come back and try some of their other stuff on the menu.", "author": "Kit W."}

So today, Saturday, I went to ETC on time again at 3:00pm and we waited until 4 o'clock and it still wasn't open. The thing is, ETC doesn't put up their open hours schedule on the window of their restaurant, so we don't know if the schedule on yelp is correct too, and if afternoon isn't their opening hours, then I hope they correct the schedule so that we as customers don't waste our time.", "author": "Mandy L."}

Their menu is pretty limited and their selection isn't that great so we just got the grass jelly w/ mixed fruits and the chocolate milkshake . The grass jelly w/ mixed fruits didn't taste good ... it lacked flavor . The mixed fruits didn't taste that great either . The chocolate milkshake was pretty good though . They're still fairly new so I'm sure they're still working on things . I'll return and re-evaluate on a later day .", "author": "Eileen L."}

We tried the wings and fries combo and I got an order of takoyaki. The wings were tiny and were just ok. They were the perfect kind of wings to toss in buffalo sauce though. The fries were typical and they were pretty generous with it, so that was good. As far as the takoyaki goes, I've had plenty of different kinds of takoyaki, but this one was just ok. I thought the batter was too thick and dense. I probably wouldn't get it again. The star of our visit was the honey toast. YUM. We got the one with a bunch of fruits on it..I forget the name lol. It was soooo good. We got a mini size, and that was not mini at all, but it was perfect for my sis and I since we had food prior to the toast. If we got the regular size, we probably wouldn't have finished it. That was a good call on our waitress though because she actually recommended the smaller size lol. Service was excellent. The girl that was working when we came was such a sweetheart. She was so nice and polite and even asked how I liked the toast since it was my first time trying it. Service was a tad bit slow, but she was so nice that I didn't even really care. I would definitely come back for the honey toast, but the food...maybe not.", "author": "Faye M."}

The people working there are friendly and the drinks are delicious. I'm a fan of their fresh fruit honey green tea, which is a drink often found in Taiwanese places and rarely found in SF. They actually use fresh kiwis, mangoes, strawberries, and lemons! I also really like how they have couches there for customers to sit on, even though my friend K thinks they're really dirty :p.", "author": "Fiona N."}

I had the munchies and decided to go to Irving to satisfy my sweet tooth. Saw this cool little trendy place with the kick ass Blue lights at the window. Nice comfortable spot with good seating and comfy looking lounge chairs. Place looked really clean and organized. Oh, and WIFI, gotta have WIFI. Really reminded me of my vaca in Tokyo where they had little gem food joints like ETC. I decided on the special they had advertised outside for waffles topped with bananas, strawberries, choco syrup and Ice cream. Seeing that, it was a done deal to satisfy my sweet tooth. The young ladies there were very friendly and also attractive, sorry had to throw that in there and asked me to take any seat. They serve hot tea while you wait, which I thought was really cool. While 1 of the girls was preparing my treat, the other came out with some appetizer which I did not order and she proceeded to say it was on the house as it was something that they were thinking about selling and I was gonna be the food taster. I had no problem with that of course, not sure exactly what you called it but it was rectangular wrapped crepe goodie with mango slices and whipped cream..soooo good. I told them it would be a hit and sell it. Next came the waffles, maaaan! it was screamin good! Waffles were perfect, not too crispy and hard and not soggy which I hate. The strawberries and bananas were fresh and sweet and the vannilla ice cream was thick and not air whipped. Good mix with the straw/ choco syrup. Never had this combo before on waffles and was impressed! It started to get pretty busy in the store and I saw all the desserts the ladies were rolling out and was like I gotta try those the next time I come. I told the young lady which turned out to be the owner, that she had a good thing going and to keep up the good food. I also told her the prices were good and reasonable compared to other places which I have gone too. She was very thankful and told her I will be coming here more often with friends to try out the other goodies on the menu.-Jeff", "author": "Mos J."}

The cafe it VERY small, there was a max about 6 tables and one small couch area. So if you want intimacy, you got it here! We sat at the table closest to the window and they have these sparkling blue light flashing everywhere!  I feel like my friends and I got mini seizures while we where there. \n\nHowever, don't let the decor turn you off.  The serves was great...a little slow..but great. There was probably only one manager and a waiter there tonight to work the front but they were both really nice! When we had questions about the desserts they took the time to explain it to us and any other questions we had. Our orders took a while, i think partly due to the small staff size, but if you're with a group of friends just chilling and talking you really wouldn't mind it. We ordered the Banana Berry Brick Honey Toast (not on the direct menu), the matcha red bean waffles w/ green tea ice cream, and the Tiramisu Brick Honey Toast. I really liked how the toast inside and under the ice cream was not overly sweet and was cut into cubes, for easy eating, and individually buttered and toasted. The ice cream and topping are as expected and of good quality. The waffles had green tea powder in them and decent. The tiramisu was kinda grainy so we didn't really eat it but again the bread cubes and ice cream were yummy!  If i had to give this a grade for presentation i would give it an A+, when our orders came out they all looked really pretty and professional! Sad to admit we took a good 5 minutes taking an insane amount of pictures of just the food. \n\nBottom line: I really like this place and had a very pleasant experience. If you want a nice cozy place to hang out at and you are not in a rush then definitely check this place out, just make sure you don't star too long at the flashing blue lights.", "author": "Danna L."}
