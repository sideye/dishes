One thing I will repeatedly order again and again is their larb phed yang (basically duck larb salad) - I FREAKIN LOVE THIS! Well, maybe salad isn't the best way to describe it. Duck lettuce wraps might be more accurate since the lettuce wraps/cups are served on the side. Another thing that I recently tried is their pad kra prow moo krob (crispy pork belly with crispy rind and basil leaves). I recommend this also - that extra crisp really does it!\n\nOther things that I've tried on their menu include their nuer yang (broiled sirloin beef served with lime juice), pad kee mao, some sort of basil beef dish, and yellow curry. All decent. Pad kee mao was just ok though.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty tiny and parking can be difficult as it is in Hayes Valley. There are other locations around the city, but I've only tried this one! I'd love to try other things on their menu the more I come to visit - but my go tos every time will always be the duck larb and crispy pork belly. You MUST try those at least!", "author": "Sydney C."}

Firstly, the menu has a wide selection -- much larger than the usual Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, and curries.  There were many dishes I hadn't seen before in other places that I was excited to try out.\n\nI always order the crab roll appetizers, they're so delicious.  Crab meat and pieces of crunchy water chestnut stuffed into tofu and fried to a crispy perfection -- I could honestly just eat those for a meal.  All of the noodle dishes I've had have been great as well.  I especially enjoyed the crispy pork belly in the Lek Tom Yum Haeng.  \n\nAs for the rest of the dining experience, it's fine; nothing too special but nothing off about the place.  The staff are friendly and service was at a good pace.  I've come here around brunch and it wasn't too busy, so we didn't have to wait for a table.  \n\nOverall, Lers Ros has really great Thai food and is a great restaurant if you want to venture outside of the typical dishes you usually see at other places.  It's a bit pricier than normal, cheap Thai food, but it's pretty standard for SF pricing.  I recommend!", "author": "Kelsey P."}

When Lers Ros popped up as an office lunch option, I decided to it was time. Our delivery order arrived on Friday, August 31st around 12:15pm via Caviar.\n\n*Green Curry: Medium spicy green curry with Thai eggplant, bamboo shoot, red bell peppers, and kaffir lime leaves, Does not include rice, Cannot make mild ($14.95), Chicken (+$1)\n*Brown Rice ($2.50)\n\nI asked for my curry extra spicy and it had a significant amount of heat. Almost too spicy for me, but I'd rather have it more than less. The flavor was pretty good, but I like a nice thick curry. I know traditionally Thai curries are thinner, so overall, the consistency of this was fine. It still clung to the rice. I did wish they noted the curry came with carrots as I'm not a huge carrot fan. I ended up digging all the carrots out. Was left with half a plate of discarded sliced carrots as there were a lot of them. The rice was cooked nicely and had a good chew.\n\nNormally, I order a bunch of dishes when having Thai. Since we have a budget to work with on office lunches, I could only have the curry. Maybe if I had other dishes, I would have enjoyed my meal more. But based solely on the curry and rice, everything was just A-OK.", "author": "Elena N."}

Its location means that a) parking is pretty much impossible, and b) it gets very crowded very quickly. If possible, avoid driving in. I recommend making a reservation to avoid waiting for a long time in the cramped area in the front. The whole restaurant, actually, is pretty cramped and dense with tables. Despite this, service was good, with wait staff regularly making the rounds, filling waters and checking in with patrons.\n\nOn to the food. We shared an appetizer, the Koh Moo Yang, sliced pork shoulder. Very flavorful, and it comes with a delicious sauce.\n\nFor entrees, we had the crab Kao Pad (crab fried rice), pork Pad Kra Prow (crumbled pork mixed with house sauce, over rice), and two orders of Pad See Ew (flat noodles in soy sauce), one pork and one beef.\n\nAll of the entrees came in larger-than-expected portion sizes. The Pad Kra Prow was my favorite, followed closely by the Pad See Ew. I didn't get a chance to try the Kao Pad. \n\nNevertheless, it's hard to go wrong here.\n\nThey offer desserts as well, but we were just too full.\n\nIt's a shade on the pricier side, but worth it for the quantity and quality of the food you'll get.", "author": "David Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-11", "description": "Yesterday, we were seeking dinner before the San Francisco Opera's \"La Boheme\", and we wandered around the neighborhood in the vicinity of the Opera House.  Just a block away, we found Lers Ros Thai and decided to try it.  We are glad that we found it. \n\nWe were a party of 4 and arrived at 5:45 pm on a Saturday evening and there was only one inside table left.  We were seated immediately. Shortly thereafter the people waiting for tables in this popular restaurant filled the small area by the door and spilled out to the sidewalk forming a large queue.   Timing is everything; a few minutes later, we would have been part of the queue. \n\nThe service in this restaurant is attentive and sometimes overzealous.  A few times, the staff attempted to clear plates that were almost finished but not yet.  This is likely due to the small size of the tables and the need to make room for other plates. Yet other requests were handled slowly or forgotten.\n\nWe started with the Chicken Satay appetizer ($9.95), which is 4 skewers of chicken with a delicious peanut dipping sauce. There are also some very good pickled cumbers on the plate. \n\nEach of us ordered a different main dish and shared tastes.  None of the dishes included rice; it must be separately requested for an extra $2.00 per person. \n\nI had the Pra Ram Nuer ($14.95), which was beef over sauteed spinach with a fantastically delicious peanut sauce.  I highly recommend this. \n\nThe Moo Gratiem ($13.95) is pork with garlic.  Did I say garlic?  Not just an ordinary amount of garlic, but a mega amount of garlic.  I am usually of the opinion that you can't overdo on garlic, but this dish approaches (but does not cross) the limit.  If you really love garlic, more garlic, and lots of garlic, then this is the dish for you!  Very tasty and probably the most distinctly flavorful dish we tried, but then we like garlic.\n\nThe Kang Phed Yang ($15.96) is very good.  It is red curry with roasted duck. If you like the taste of a good red curry that is very spicy, then this is for you. My son had this dish and he normally enjoys spicy food, but found that he had to order a sweet dessert to calm his mouth after he finished it.  He said that it was delicious (I tasted it and agree with him). \n\nThe last dish was Sweet & Sour Chicken ($13.95) that fortunately was not the typical kind that you see on some Chinese restaurant menus and never order.  It had a thin sauce that had elements of sweetness and sourness at the same time, in balance. I personally thought that it was the weakest in overall flavor compared to the other dishes we ordered, but the person in our party who ordered it did enjoy it. \n\nFor dessert, we began our greatest adventure.  How can dessert be adventurous, you ask?  It is if you try a dessert with Durian!  We ordered one order each of Sticky Rice with Mango ($6.50), Sticky Rice with White Pistachio Ice Cream ($6.50), and Sticky Rice with Durian ($6.50).  The Sticky Rice with Mango and the one with Ice Cream were very delicious and make a nice dessert.  It served well the expected function of calming spicy mouths. \n\nOne of our party had heard of Durian and none of us every tried it. He heard that while Durian did not smell good, that it tasted good.  This was our scientific test of this hypothesis. \n\nThe desert with Durian was served and the first person took a smell and his face contorted into something you see in a horror movie!  Being brave (as we all were in turn), he tasted it. If you thought that his face looked bad from smelling it, tasting it turned it into the portrait of Dorian Grey!  Yet, being a brave scientist, he continued tasting it several times before concluding that it was terrible.    \n\nThen the plate was passed around the table.  When it approached me, its strong pungent foul aroma wafted across the table and assaulted me.  It is one of the worst smells that you can imagine.  Yet being brave, I took a small spoonful of it into my mouth where it immediately went to war with my taste buds. I tried it again to confirm the initial diagnosis. It is horrible!\n\nIt is no fault of the restaurant, it is the Durian fruit itself. \n\nThe next person to sample it confirmed the diagnosis of the first two people. \n\nMy son, who was absent from the table during the initial tastings of Durian, returned to the table.  It was now his turn.  He quickly put a spoonful into his mouth fast enough to not smell it, and declared that it was OK!  We were surprised.  Then he took another spoonful more slowly and smelled it on the way into his mouth and it changed his opinion.\n\nSo, perhaps it does taste good, but the powerful belligerent smell that it emits overwhelms any desire to eat it!  (or even to have near you). \n\nIf you do a bit of research, you will find that the Durian fruit is banned on public transit in some southeast Asian countries due to the bad smell.  However, it is enjoyed by some people (likely a minority that has malfunctioning olfactory systems!).", "author": "Mike M."}

Service is fast, on-point\n\nSo why is this place A-OK and not 4 or 5 stars?\n\n1. The BBQ chicken I was served (Ler Ros Combination special off the Chef's/Specials menu) was kinda dry and stringy like it was several days old. When I was cutting it, it was kinda plain to see that this was reheated. Just because I've been seeing BBQ a lot, kinda felt like it was at least a few days old given the dryness and stringitude\n\n2. The Scallops I was served (Ginger Scallops special off the Chef's/Specials menu) looked like it was 3 scallops cut in half to make 6. You get the idea. I've bought scallops before and they are almost an inch in height. These were obviously sliced in half. Look at the photos, not super prominent even at presentation. \n\nSo back to the official review. Make no doubt, the food looked great and I ate it and enjoyed myself -- so that earns a A-OK review. Was it gourmet? Can't call yourself gourmet serving that chicken to your customers. Was it great value? When I paid like $22 for like 3-4 scallops, I'd say not particularly. (didn't come with rice either, thanks Ler Ros)\n\nWould I go back? Probably not. With Absinthe down the street, I'd prefer to go there. I specifically targeted this place after looking at the pics and was super happy right up until I started seeing what the main entrees actually consisted of. Other competitors around the area I'd give a try rather than come in to Ler Ros again and plate me several day old BBQ chicken and charge me $22 for it. \n\nTofu appetizers were awesome though!

Between this and Thai Noodle in the East Bay, my Thai food needs are all covered in the Bay Area. Lers Ros is nicer and pricier than Thai Noodle though, which does tasty, large quantities of food. Both are great, but cater to different preferences. \n\nThe last time I came here, we ordered the papaya salad with prawns, fried rice with prawns, and the pad kee mao with chicken (drunken noodles). I've never had a bad dish here, and I really don't think you can go wrong if you like the sweet, sour, salty flavors of Thai food.\n\nThe papaya salad is delicious, but if you don't like fish sauce or sour and spicy flavors, you might not like it! I love the melding of the different flavors in this salad, and it's such a fresh and healthy creation.

Also, I think pad kee mao is a pretty traditional Thai dish, and this place does it well.

Decided to try this place out because I was craving Thai food and wish I ate at a different Thai restaurant. Seating is extremely limited/tiny at this location so definitely get a reservation beforehand. Even with a reservation we still waited about 20 minutes for our table to open up. I did not make note of what my friends ordered but we split the Thai Curry Puff (5/5) can't really mess this up, and my Pad Thai with Crab meat (3/5). I was looking forward to my Pad Thai because having Crab meat as an option is pretty hard to come by, but overall the dish was just lacking in flavors. I've had so many other great Pad Thai's this was just not worth the money and the wait. It was a huge disappointment. Another thing that I did not like about Lers Ros is that you can not get a single serving of soup... ALL THE SOUPS here are for 2-3 portion sizes... Great for groups if everyone wants soup, terrible if you just want a side order to yourself.", "author": "Yoona K."}

I've been here a few times and ordered several different dishes, but my favorite by far is the yellow curry. The papaya salad is good as well, and it adds some crunch! \n\nThe only downside to this place is how crowded I can get. The space itself is quite small, and the tables are extremely close together, but there still isn't enough room for everyone! The staff becomes stressed and irritable when it is so crowded- I would definitely recommend getting takeout or coming at a non-peak time. Friday nights are some of the busiest I've seen, but Sunday nights I've been seated quite quickly. They also have some tables outside if it's a nice night. \n\nI will definitely come back here, as the food is delicious! But I might stick with takeout in the future.", "author": "Ayushi A."}

You can also choose the amount of spice you want which was nice\n\nMAIN ENTREES\nBeef Pad Thai - SO GOOD! We actually ordered chicken but somehow beef came out which was not at all a problem, we ended up being very happy with the mixup since we were eating mostly chicken dishes anyway. We ordered this item from the Vegetarian section of the menu, since the tofu pad thai looked better than the meat one (this one included eggs, peanut sauce, cilantro, etc. and just substituted the tofu for meat)\n\nKang Keaw Wan (green curry coconut mil dish) - super spicy but so so flavorful and delicious.

The noodles were light and chewy, the pork belly perfectly crispy, the ground pork flavorful. As far as service, had no problems with it, either.

Yes, that's BEFORE we even ordered. How nice! \n\nMy friend Christine L. and I decided to order family style for just two of us. We got the Red Duck Curry with an order of brown rice and the Tom Yum soup. I thoroughly enjoyed every last drop of the curry. It was delish! The duck was cooked so perfectly too.

That is the typical dish to order up at Thai restaurants.  It was disappointing.  I mean it was good, but again, the flavor was not oh my goodness, it is delicious.

The food was alright for the most part, especially the curry, but the noodles and rest of the meal left me wanting more. For being hyped as the go-to Thai restaurant in the area, I was expecting at least one of the dishes to blow me away. Not the case.\n\nEnvironment  - The vibe in here was very \"meh\" as a whole. We came on a weekend night, and it was surprising to see the place be so low energy, especially when compared to the vibrant and trendy restaurants surrounding it in Hayes Valley. Also - while not the restaurant's fault - the people that sat next to us were a little...what's the word...\"basic\"? When they weren't bickering about minor details of their relationship they were engaged in discussions of friend drama or celebrity gossip. Seriously. \n\nService - So on this occasion I happened to be grabbing dinner with a really good friend of mine who I hadn't seen in more than a year, so we had a LOT to catch up on. Despite that fact, for some reason every 5 minutes or so members of the staff would return to our table and ask to clear our plates or bring to-go boxes. Despite the fact that we would politely decline their request, a short time later another person would return and ask the same question. Hmm. \n\nI mean while it's true that we were eating slowly, it was also clear that the reason for that was because I was having an actual conversation with someone at dinner. Therefore, there was really no need to come back and ask the same question over and over again, and really, it would have been nice to have a little bit of uninterrupted conversation. \n\nSo overall not my favorite (not sure I would come back), but also not terrible enough to leave a bad taste in my mouth or anything.

The Ginger chicken had to be the highlighted dish of the night with fresh bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, ginger, and of course, chicken.

The atmosphere is cool, with an exposed stone wall on one side, floor-to-ceiling windows, and dark dining tables and chairs. My friend and I ordered the pad thai ($14.95) and alligator entree ($21.95). I'd never had alligator before, and it was quite chewy to me but not off-putting in any way. The alligator dish was quite spicy, and the pretty berry-like garnishes that we thought were edible were actually fresh black pepper plants or something of the sort--we learned the hard way. While Lers Ros Thai portions are smaller and more expensive than the plentiful cheap Thai restaurants I'm used to in the East Bay, I thought their pad thai was one of the best if not the best I've ever had! It possibly could've been a tad less sweet, but I think the fact that the serving was smaller than other heaping noodle dishes made the flavors more vibrant. My friend said that they are always out of mango when he tries to order mango sticky rice here (including their other locations) and sure enough, when we asked for the dessert they said they had no mango. We opted for the alternative, stinkier durian sticky rice. I've never ordered dessert at a Thai restaurant before, but tasting the sticky rice dish has opened me up to the option in the future. The dessert was composed of a mound of a mixture of rice and durian pieces, coated in a sweet syrup like condensed milk. I liked that the whole thing was warm and the durian seemed like it was steamed along with the rice, since the pieces were well integrated into every bite. However, glutinous rice is pretty heavy stuff, and the more durian I ate the more its peculiar stench got to me, so splitting the dessert among at least two people yields appropriate serving sizes. It would be a satisfying night to go to SF Jazz or the Symphony next door topped off by dinner at Lers Ros Thai.", "author": "Amy G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-30", "description": "What a smart move for Lers Ros Thai to open another outlet far enough away from the grittier confines of the Tenderloin to make the new one feel like a cosmopolitan reinvention of itself. It's right next to the Grove and across the street from the Hayes Valley Grill, which will most assuredly bring in the more urbane diners with their more delicate palates than the Larkin Street locale ever could. Interestingly, the menu hasn't changed to accommodate the masses, which is fine by me since I like the spicy kick that their menu provides. It should come as no surprise that the new location provides a much sleeker decor and far trendier ambient music to make it more competitive with the likes of Osha Thai among the hipster crowd.\n\nEven though it's been open for just a month or so, the approach looks to be working. People were streaming in. Jamie W. and I came here on the early side, about 5:45PM, and were seated right away next to the window in the corner. This is a prime spot because you're not crowded against the other tables here. The first thing we ordered was the memorable $10.25 Tom Kha Kai, a coconut milk-based soup served in a Thai fire pot with chicken, lemongrass, trumpet mushrooms, and kaffir lime leaves (see photo). This is one of my favorite soups from the other location, so we were happy to be ladling such ambrosia into our little bowls. We then had a double-header of pork. The first was the $10.95 Moo Prik Khing, which was a pile of pork ribs stir-fried with house-made chili paste, red peppers, and green beans (see photo).\n\nThe second was a dish that was calling my name with the two most beautiful words in the English language, \"pork belly\". It was the $10.95 Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob, which consisted of chunks of stir-fried pork belly topped with crispy rinds and accompanied by sauteed basil leaves (see photo). Although the rind provided more chew than desirable for an entree of this caliber, the pork belly itself was delicious. The service was rather tentative that evening, probably because a bevy of young pretty girls have been hired to serve. Now if they could just gain some street cred from their older colleagues on Larkin, they would truly be stellar here. In the meantime, you can enjoy good, spicy Thai fare at Lers Ros Thai in a user-friendly neighborhood.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...did I mention they serve pork belly?\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...sleek and chic...and the restaurant doesn't look bad either\nSERVICE - 3 stars...needs more confidence\nTOTAL - 4 stars...spicy Thai in a comfortable setting", "author": "Ed U."}

But since my last review in 2014, the place has gone downhill from average and three incidences in the last 6 months have led us to decide not to patronize this restaurant again, which we hate to do, because *some* of the staff are great. The 1st incident occurred 4 months ago when my friend became sick after eating her vegetable tofu dish. My dish was fine, but she was out of commission for 2 days (though not hospital bad by any means). The 2nd incident came when we ordered carry out and they got our order wrong -- we couldn't be bothered to call to change it, but the dish they gave us was $3 cheaper than the one we ordered, and was too spicy to eat. And they only gave us one rice when we asked for two orders. We let this one slide as things happen. But recently they got our order wrong again -- we asked for a mild dish with extra X and they gave us instead an extra spicy dish with *no* X at all. As we had ordered @10pm, right before closing, we weren't able to call them to tell them and have the correct food delivered. And then life got busy. Three days later I brought the order back, uneaten in its original container, with the original receipt, and asked them to give us a new correct one. We were then told that the dish couldn't be made mild (which is weird, because we had ordered it that way before several times, and which still doesn't explain not getting the extra X that we requested). They then asked if we wanted something else instead and I said sure, how about something simple like pad thai. When we went to get it, they said \"$14 dollars please.\" And I was like \"What?! Why didn't you tell us that you weren't going to replace our dish for free, *before* we wasted some 35+ minutes of our time?\" She responded that it had been too many days (3) and that we should have called the same day we bought it. Fair enough, but she should have told us this decision when we first came in with the mis-fire dish and not wasted our time (and we were waiting outside in the freezing cold because there is no where to sit inside unless you are eating).

The food is expensive for Thai, and rice is not included in the $12-13 for an entree, which I have a problem with since they act like it is l. Something I still have to learn about CA, I guess, is that nothing is ever included for free. I ordered the pra ram pak, which is tofu and veggies in a peanut sauce. The sauce was flavorful, but they did not get all the water out of the veggies so it watered down the saucepan the plate. Rookie mistake IMO. The servers were not particularly friendly and it's not like it was particularly busy on a weekday at 5:30 pm. Just eh, maybe the other locations are better.", "author": "Cara R."}

Yes.\n\nUnleash your exotic food eating side at Lers Ros! We started off with duck larb. Two words: Oh yes. The spices blended beautifully-- a lovely mix of sweet, sour and salty flavors. The duck was tender, but I wasn't a big fan of duck fat. \n\nThe garlic frog is just like baby chicken wings. Beware of tiny bones. They serve it with a sweet-sour sauce and top it with fried garlic...a lot of it. I love me some fried garlic!!!\n\nThe boar curry. Eh. The boar meat was ok. I had never had boar before; I like to describe it as a cross between cow and pig. They serve their boar with the tendon-y parts which I'm not a big fan of (too much chewing!). If you like your meat, don't get the boar curry. What I did like about the dish was the heat factor!\n\nThe garlic ginger rice was delicious! I don't like ginger chunks (just a big fan of the ginger flavor), but it was easy to pull them off. Think garlic fried rice with an extra kick.\n\nYou should also know that Lers Ros does it spicy and they don't warn you. That's alright by me. ;) Just wash it down with a perfectly brewed and mixed Thai iced tea.", "author": "Erin G."}

Great flavors, good price points considering the bougie location and the nice-ish environment, extensive menu.  We came here for dinner the other night and ordered this crispy chicken with garlic rice dish, the duck noodle soup, and the pad see ew.  I loved that crispy chicken dish - probably the best of the night. Yum! \n\nMy only gripe was the service.  I'm generally not picky when it comes to service, but one of my pet peeves is when people in particular jobs are poorly trained or just plain bad at their main functions.  Customer service people who are rude; service workers who forget your orders; administrative folks who don't answer emails promptly, etc.  In fact, I actually wasn't going to review this place, but the service bothered me in such a way that I felt compelled to shed some light on this and hopefully the staff will read it and then properly correct the issue.  \n\nSo here's the problem: The waitresses started taking away our dishes even before we were done, which struck me as really odd and abnormal.  We were eating family style, and we each had our individual plates, but when this one waitress noticed that our own plates were empty, she'd come by and take them away! And then, near the end of our meal, when we still had food on some of the shared plates, she came by and took those plates away, stacking them on top of each other so that it would've been awkward for us to ask her to stop.  There was enough food left on those plates to take home, and I again found it strange that she just came and took all the leftover food away without even asking us if we wanted to take the food home.  \n\nThe service and, in particular, the behavior of that one particular waitress bothered me so much that I'm taking away TWO stars for that.  So, the food actually gets 5 stars - it's fantastic.  The service was just so strange that it made me wonder if she was properly trained to be a waitress because I feel like it's a pretty standard (and expected!) thing to ask your patrons if 1) they're done eating before you take away their plates and 2) if they want to take home any (especially a substantial amount!) of the leftover food.  \n\nService aside, you should still come here.  A VERY tasty meal, I was absolutely impressed.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I usually go for pad thai, rad na, or pad see ew, but these noodles were so simple, fresh, and best yet- not heavy or oily.

But there was more onion than potato (and this is essentially a potato curry), and the curry was just ruined.\n\nSo on the up side, easy to get in, good location, good cold Singhas.  On the downside, the worst yellow curry on the planet.  So...um....read other reviews and order something else.", "author": "Bill O."}

We've had mixed results ordering the various salad entrees from the menu. Generally, the salad meat tends to be quite fatty (ie pork shoulder or duck) and fairly unappetizing. On the other hand, we generally love the mix of lime juice and fish sauce that's used as the salad dressing. Salads here do not tend to be very spicy. The pad kee mao was decent as well. It's hard to measure up to Marnee Thai's pad kee mao (best in the city) and this one from Lers Ros was not much a competitor.

It's a welcome addition to the dining scene in Hayes Valley.\n\nGiven the level of spiciness and they flavors in the dishes, I would guess that they are staying true to their roots, which is fine by me.  However, if are not a fan of Thai chili peppers, choose wisely from the menu.  This is not a place with tiny chili peppers on the menu indicating the level of heat in each dish.  Assume that most, if not all, if the dishes have some level of heat.\n\nThe green papaya salad is quite refreshing, but really spicy!  I've tried it plain and with shrimp and both are good.  The pork belly  dish, Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob, is delicious and comes stir fried with basil in a nice sauce.  If you are a fan of the Chinese roast pork with crispy skin, this is your dish.  The Beef Pad Prik Thai was tasty and came with a sweet, peppery sauce; the beef was on the chewy side though.  The Prawns Asparagus came with a slightly spicy garlic sauce and is something I would recommend.\n\nThe only dish that I found disappointing was the Kaeng Som Koong Pak Ruam Soup - although this tasted good, there were only four pieces of shrimp, a lot of cabbage and was mostly broth.\n\nService is just okay but could use some improvement.  One time they lost my reservation; I had called two weeks prior and even repeated all the details to the person on the phone to confirm but when I walked in my name was not to be found on the list.  Luckily, tables were available.   They have a habit of clearing our dishes before we were done eating.  Yes, I understand for the need to turnover the table, but there was still uneaten food on the plates.  On all of my visit our servers have spilled food (onto the floor) while collecting our plates.  On time it was the soup, another time it was a sauce.  I found some of the waitresses friendly and more helpful than others.  On a positive note, they constantly came by to refill our water glasses, which was much appreciated given how spicy some dishes can be!  They also met our requests immediately.\n\nThe other issue I have with this restaurant is the noise level.  I think it would be quieter to eat at one of their outdoor tables than inside.  The decor is modern and sleek, but the hard edges do make sounds bounce.  Even 1/3 filled the noise level can get pretty high!  \n\nOverall, the food is worth making a visit, but I wonder if the overall experience would be better at their other older, more established location.", "author": "Melissa L."}

The sauce tasted really good with the pork but I found the pork to be a little too stringy and tough, and not that flavorful.\n\n(2) Pad Kee Mao: Very good flavor in this dish, pretty typical of most thai restaurants and just a little bit spicy, but i found this dish to be quite greasy.\n\n(3) Chicken Curry: Nothing too special. It tasted good but not overwhelmingly so. It came with slices of chicken, sliced onions and chunks of carrots. It was a decent sized portion.\n\n(4) two bowls of the ginger/garlic rice: i always order this whenever eating thai food so this is a must to go with the curry!

Since it is in Hayes Valley and it has beautiful decor, they do get away with charging a little more than your standard Thai restaurant.

The way this place is set up is absolutely terrible and the food is mediocre and Americanized. \n\nIf you come during dinner hour, you MUST come early or make a reservation or you will be relegated to the bar and high tables with uncomfortable, wiry seats. The main tables are absolutely impossible to eat at unless you have made reservations.

We were sitting at the one of only two tables that were open to walk ins. \n\nNow for the food - the duck salad was awful. It had so many good reviews on yelp and I was eager to try it, but the taste was SUPER pungent and it tasted as if it was dosed in vinegar. Also, they put some strange crunchy coating over the duck and it felt like I was biting into finger nails. It was so salty and strong it was impossible to eat without drinking massive gulps of water. \n\nThe pad kee Mao was not impressive at all. It tasted more like beef chow fun with some spices thrown in and it was drowning in bean sprouts, which were more plentiful than the noodles themselves. \n\nThe green curry was probably the most enjoyable dish of the night, but it wasn't too spectacular. I'd say it was your standard green curry dish but it certainly was not enough to salvage the meal. It had a good flavor, a nice balance of coconut milk and spices and just decent overall. \n\nNow back to the service - as we began to finish up our food, we had only been there a grand total of 40 minutes when the hostess came up and asked us how much longer we are going to take. EXCUSE ME?! Are we not paying customers that have as much right to sit and eat as everyone else?

Split the bill onto a few credit cards with the last person being charged only a few dollars to cover the rest of the tip.

Most restaurants would usually comp an appetizer or dessert for that.\n\nAll of a sudden, a waitress who barely speaks English and obviously doesn't understand math yells at the group because the tip amount was so low on some of the receipts. This lasts for 10 minutes with the entire restaurant listening in and the waitress implying that we didn't tip enough and that we're cheap.\n\nAs far as I know, 18% tip is fine for good service, 20% for great service.

NEVER. \n\nAs for the food/restaurant:\n\nThe food is great, it's on par with the original location on Larkin St. The restaurant itself is nicer and newer, but they need to seriously work on training their servers.", "author": "John W."}

The spices used are added with a delicate hand, never overwhelming the dish. \nThe decor is pleasing, clean lines with an elegance.\nService is accomodating and polite. Yesterday was the first time I had lunch there and found the choices of the luncheon specials to varied.\nThe big bonus was Jeremy, the host. Warm, open, very welcoming, conversational and fun; he made our meal a \" memorabe dining experience\".

Wasn't impressed with this Hayes spot. \n\nStopped by for dinner on Sunday and easily snagged a two-top around 7pm. Ordered the tofu and eggplant stir fry and the $30 fish in lime and chile broth.\n\nWaitress asked, do you want the eggplant to come out first? We said no. Waitress asked, what kind of rice do you want? We said brown rice.\n\nCan you guess what happened next? Eggplant comes out first (10 min before the fish) along with a container of white rice. Guess the waitress was only asking to be polite.\n\nThe eggplant/tofu dish ($9.95) came with ~7-8 pieces of eggplant and 4-5 pieces of tofu (it was not substantial). The fish came in an interesting fish shaped platter placed on top of a burner. The presentation was impressive and it had nice tangy flavors, but it definitely would not have fed more than 2 people. \n\nAll in all, both dishes tasted fine but neither had the pungency and kick of dishes I've tried in Thailand.", "author": "Carolyn F."}

It has some of the best Thai food outside of Asia.  When they opened this Hayes location, I thought great way to share authentic foods in a slightly more upscale setting.\nUnfortunately though, over time, the food at this location has really really slipped.  It has happened slowly over time.  The spices lessened and the flavors became more muted.  And, over the past year, we have noted a marked decline in the quality of the ingredients used, especially the pork and beef.  The pork shoulder items are now made with fatty and low quality meat which has rendered them bad tasting, tough, and almost inedible.  The beef curry tastes fatty and strong also. \n  I hope that this might be just this location trying to save some pennies due to the rent.  We are now going to retreat back to the Tenderloin.  \n  Lers Ros team we love you and your restaurant.  Please look into this and see if there are some inadvertent changes!

This soup is really the only reason why I'm giving the restaurant 4 stars, otherwise it would be 3 stars.  The lemongrass and galangal and lime came together so yummily. There were four of us at the table and this was easily everyone's favorite.  Caveat:  I've never had a thai soup before that I can recall, so not sure how this soup would measure up for a connoisseur. We found it delicious.\n\nKhing Sod Tofu:  Tofu with ginger, veggies, bean sauce. Good, not too oily, not too sweet, just the way i like it.  I wish this dish came with more veggies though.  \n\nSpicy Tofu:  Same as the above but with bamboo and a bit spicier.  Dishes were almost identical in flavor. \n\nBrown rice:  soooooo tasty, i wish I could make brown rice this good.  Thai idea also had really good brown rice like Lers Ros.  Maybe it is a San Francisco thing?  I just moved here from Vancouver.\n\nBeef Curry:  The other people at the table ordered this.  They thought it was good.

And since it was pouring down rain I felt more inclined to soup than eggs. \n\nI ordered the curry puffs and seafood soup.\n\nThe puffs were the first disappointing food I've had at Lers Ros. They tasted pretty much of just dough. \n\nWhen I ordered the soup the waitress asked if spicy was OK and I said yes. She said she would put medium spicy. Wow! If that was medium spicy I can't imagine what the real spicy would be like. Talk about sinus clearing - I went through most of my purse pack of Kleenex! I had ordered a soup without noodles because I did not want to feel too full; I ended up adding an order of rice to add to the soup and ate nearly the entire pot of rice. Don't get me wrong, the soup was really good, with lemon grass, basil, lime, clams, shrimp, fish balls (really tasty). Not for the faint of heart, or should I say stomach? For dessert I got pistachio ice cream. Generous portion (probably could have served two but ice cream goes down easy), drizzled with honey, sprinkled with nuts. \n\nMy overall impression remains, good food, moderate prices, generous portions, service still needs fixes. My table was very wobbly. When I mentioned this (it was hard to cut food) the waitress said she'd get someone to fix but did not. I saw a piece of rubber on the floor that had apparently been used to balance table but had gotten knocked out of position; I got down on the floor to put it back. I had to ask twice for refills on my tea. They brought the check without asking me if I wanted dessert. The napkins are way too flimsy and I had to ask for fresh.

I may run into a new best of next week.\n\nHowever, for Lers Ros Thai (Hayes Valley), I am going to make an exception.  This is the best Thai food I've eaten in San Francisco.  It is among the best I've eaten anywhere.\n\nOn a suggestion from a colleague, we had lunch here.\n\nI was surprised.  Based on it's reputation, I thought it would be busier.  Many of the nearby restaurants were quite full.  This was at 1 pm on a Thursday.   So, it wasn't at the absolute heart of lunch hour.\n\nWe were quickly greeted and offered a table of our choice.\n\nThe service was impeccable.  Our server was very friendly.  Not only was she courteous, but she was very helpful with the menu.  During ordering, we asked her advice on numerous menu items and she provided very helpful direction.  She also remembered my colleague from a previous visit.  She even remembered specifics of his order.\n\nThe ambiance is pretty basic.  It is neat and organized and pretty straight-forward.  It is a very functional room.  But, there is very little glitz to it.\n\nThe star of Lers Ros Thai is the food.  It is freshly prepared with quality fresh ingredients.  There is a very significant menu with a wide range of dishes.  There are many dishes that you do not usually find on your average local Thai restaurants menu.\n\nThe food:\n\nSalad with spicy beef - I do not know the name of this dish.  It was a salad with strips of beef.  There was a touch of a kick.  Cabbage was provided to use if the heat became a little overpowering.  While the heat was noticeable, I found it to be pretty spot on to my own preference.  \n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/735os7z\n\nWe also each received a small basket with sticky rice.  The rice was also wrapped in plastic to help keep it hot.\n\nRoasted Thai Northern style herb sausage (served with peanut, cut ginger, sliced red onion, lemon and chili.)  I really enjoyed this dish.  The sausage was relatively mild.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/8yarpky\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/7gwatwu\n\nNuer Pad Prik Thai Ooan (Sliced tender beef, stir fried with young pepper corn and galingale) - This was probably my favorite dish.  It was also spicy.  The meat was very tender.  The pepper corns and galingale had imparted levels of subtle flavors.  I ate this dish with steamed white rice.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6r6wovu\n\nSteamed Vegetables - They looked exceedingly fresh.  They were obviously NOT overcooked.  However, I chose not to have any.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/823uhze\n\nThere were also a number of different sauces provided.\n\nOverall, functional neat ambiance, excellent service, and amazing food combined for a terrific lunch.  I would happily return.  I think it would be fantastic to go with a slightly larger group which would allow for trying many more dishes.", "author": "Mark D."}

It's a slightly more expensive Thai restaurant with beautiful paneled floors, black minimalist furniture, and stone-covered walls. The portions are also much smaller and strictly per person, as opposed to other Thai places, where two entrees and rice may easily feed three people. \n\nWith all that said, the food that we ordered was deliciously prepared. I tried the Kang Keaw Wan coconut milk curry (green curry) with brown jasmine rice, while my friend ordered the Kao Mun Kai Tod (a garlic and ginger rice plate with fried chicken). The green curry was the perfect blend of creaminess and spiciness, with a good assortment of chicken and vegetables thrown in. My friend seemed to enjoy her dish as well-- I tried a bit of her fried chicken, which had been prepared to golden crispy perfection. \n\nIn conclusion, Lers Ros' rather modest portions makes me think that my $16 could have gotten me a comparably delicious meal and a half at another Thai restaurant. Although this is probably me being picky, I wasn't a fan of being charged extra for my rice either, especially when I'd ordered an entree that absolutely requires rice to be eaten (unless drinking is a new way to ingest curry).

The only had a written wait list. I showed her my email with the reservation, but instead of apologizing, she rudely just said we would have to wait like everyone else. There was another couple next to us that were in the same situation and just as fed up with the hostess. If they overbooked, they should be honest and apologize.

I honestly don't remember what I ordered the first time...it was only in December but it was clearly not a memorable meal. What I DO remember was walking away thinking it was kinda 'meh' and a tad overpriced for what it was. Then again, I guess you pay for the ambiance.\n\nThis time my experience was better, but mixed. My friend and I split the Garlic FROG appetizer. Yep, I tried flog. This may not be impressive for many of you out there, but I hadn't even tried beef until last July, so I'm patting myself on the back for this one. Anyways...back to the food. I thought the frog was decent. I can't say I like the bone to meat ratio, but that was the frog's fault, not the restaurant's. It was lightly fried and served with a spicy red sauce. Nothing to write home about, but decently good.\n\nNext: We split the Red Curry with Roasted Duck and the Pad Kee Mow with Chicken. The Red Curry with Roasted Duck was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend it. The Pad Kee Mow, on the other hand, was kinda bland. There was some heat to it, but not much flavor.\n\nRather than give you a bowl of rice, the servers come around and serve you rice as needed.

I suspect that part of the reason is due to the ingredients they use: They don't substitute or skip them just because they're harder to get. For example, the tiny round Thai eggplants: Most other places don't bother with them, but Lers Ros uses them liberally in their curries. They also don't skimp on spiciness, which is great since lots of other places tone things down a bit too much.\n\nIf you come here, order anything pork related. They're ALL good. If anything, order Koh Moo Yang (grilled pork shoulder): Tender pork dipped in a spicy & tart sauce. I'm salivating just thinking about it!\n\nAnd definitely order something from the \" Original Thai Style\" section. Chances are you wont' find \"fried egg with acacia\" elsewhere.

Was expecting inauthentic, not-so-great-tasting Thai food, but actually got inauthentic and very delicious food.\n\nFood - We ordered the chili pepper beef and pad see ew with prawns. Both dishes were amazing. The beef was tender, covered in chili flakes how I like it, and while it didn't taste authentic, it was still worth the calories. The pad see ew was also great, and they are generous with their serving of prawns.\n\nAmbience - Overall it looked like a low-budget restaurant trying to be stylish, so from afar, it looks like a cute cafe. It's nothing too special by SF's standards, but it's not your hole-in-the-wall thai restaurant either. On another note, I think the manager needs to pay attention to music choice in this restaurant; it REALLY did not set the right mood listening to 90s slow rock, like Savage Garden and Goo Goo Dolls. Seriously, play something upbeat so I don't feel like I'm eating in a supermarket in the Midwest.\n\nService - They were not aiming to please, from the hostess to the waitresses. Not only did it take about 10 minutes for us to get greeted after sitting, we didn't get checked on (not even a how are you doing?) from the waitress from the point of dropping off the dish until we got our check. But when I'm going out for Thai, or any other asian food for that matter, do I really expect 5-star service? Definitely not.\n\nWill I come back?

The occasion was my birthday and my sister and her family were coming in from Marin, and Thai food is one cuisine that we all agree on.  We always go to Marnee Thai in the Sunset, but this year, I wanted to try something different -- it turned out to be an terrible decision! \n\nEastbound traffic on Hayes Street was awful, and it was getting close to our reservation time.  I asked my husband to let me off a block west of the restaurant and I would walk the rest of the way to check-in since it was already the time of the reservation.  I was less than a block away when my phone rang.  It was someone at Lers Ros asking if we were going to honor our reservation.  I replied that I was walking there right at that moment and was less than a block away.  Later, I checked my phone for the time stamp, and that call had come in at 6:20 p.m.\n\nI arrived not a minute after that phone call and there was no one at the check-in podium.  I looked around and saw servers busy with their tasks, but didn't see a host or hostess that I could check in with.  A couple minutes passed and I saw a female server setting a large table against the back wall and went over to speak to her.  I asked her if she was setting up for my party of 8 with the 6:15 p.m. reservations.  She asked if everyone was present.  I said that my husband and sister were parking, but that I expected them shortly.  I asked again if the table that she was setting up was for us.  She said that since we weren't all there, that she had to attend to the other customers who were waiting at the door.\n\nMy sister and her family arrived about five minutes after that. My husband and daughters just behind them. Some time later, a party of 4 arrived and checked in with the same server that I had been talking to. They announced that they also had dinner reservations; I found out that they also had reservations for 6:15 p.m., however, they arrived significantly later than we did.  Within a few minutes, they were seated.  That was the last straw.  I spoke to another server: there were words exchanged, and he admitted that they gave my table away.  I said, F--- you, thanks for ruining my birthday dinner, and left!  We had been waiting for a total of 40 minutes by the time we left.  Not my finest moment, but I'm owning up to it. Let's see if Lers Ros owns up to their part and admits that they were wrong too.\n\nAs we were walking back to the car, I called Marnee and asked if there was any way they could accommodate a party of 8 in 15 minutes, that we were driving there from Hayes Valley that moment.  The host answered that they could probably squeeze us in 30 minutes and took down my phone number.  The Marnee host called me back in two minutes and asked that if someone from my party could be dropped off and check-in with him when we arrived, that he could seat us sooner.  I said, \"will do.\"  We were seated as soon as we arrived.  What a difference in service! We had a delicious and enjoyable meal after that disastrous attempt at Lers Ros.  \n\nI don't about the food since I didn't get a chance to eat there, but if I could give this place ZERO STARS I would, if only for the complete lack of service. I have never encountered such unprofessional and rude service! I have never left a 1-star review on Yelp before, but in this case, I didn't see how I could not.

They lied to Zhiyong X (11/13/2014),  Manya D (10/16/2014) and Ashkay K (10/16/2014) about what ingredients were in their food. So, not honoring confirmed reservations and lying are both patterns of behavior and not just isolated incidents.\n\nI got an email from their reservation service saying: \"Thank you for reserving at Lers Ros Hayes Valley. Your Dinner reservation on Saturday, November 29, 2014 for 3 at 6:15 PM is confirmed.\" We showed up 10 minutes early and they said, sorry, they were overbooked and there would be no table for us.  I showed them the email containing the reservation confirmation.  I looked over and saw an empty table, and asked why we were not being given that table since we had a confirmed reservation. \n\nThe demeanor of the person dealing with us was completely rude and unprofessional, acting as if we were somehow at fault for them not honoring our confirmed reservation. They said that they tried to call to cancel the reservation. However, I looked at my phone and there was no record of any phone call from them. They were simply lying. Furthermore, they had my email address and could have emailed if they couldn't get in touch with me by phone.\n\nWe had tickets for an 8 PM symphony concert and there were absolutely no seats available at any decent restaurant in the area.  We had planned a nice evening out, but Lers Ros Thai turned what was supposed to be an enjoyable dinner into a stressful and unpleasant experience.  \n\nThe worst part of it was having to deal with rude, incompetent and inconsiderate liars.  I can deal with people who make an honest mistake, are apologetic, and do their best to right their wrong, but I can't do business with the kind of people who work at Lers Ros Thai.\n\nIf you don't want to support rude, incompetent and inconsiderate liars, you should not eat at Ler Ros Thai.  By the way, they were closed down by the health department, but recently re-opened: http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2013/11/08/lers-ros-in-hayes-valley-shut-down-by-health-department/", "author": "Ken C."}

When my party showed up for our reservation at 7pm, another party was still seated at our table, refusing to leave for the next half hour. Our hostess seemed obviously stressed out and about to break into tears. But by the end of the meal, we were having such a good time that I couldn't help but notice the grin on her face. It was good to see her like that.\n\nAs for food, my recommendations go to Pork Belly, Duck Larb, and Garlic Frog. The Pork Belly is easily a standard deviation better than anything else I ate. I didn't actually eat the Duck Larb or Garlic Frog, but given the acclaim from all of the foodies I personally know I would recommend them anyway.\n\nI could totally handle eating here again.

We ordered my 2 usuals: Duck Larb and Pork Shoulder (which are still amazing). Not knowing what else to get, we decide to be a little bit more adventurous...so we order the Rabbit dish and Alligator dish. As default, we also ordered the Pad See Ew.\n\nThe Rabbit seemed overcooked and the meat was dry. The sauce and/or seasoning was nothing memorable. The Alligator was a big disappointment as I found it to be a very average dish. The flavor of it honestly tasted or reminded me of the spicy ramen packages. I'm very open to new foods and love trying new things, so I know it's not me being a picky food snob. The Pad See Ew was what you'd expect. Average.\n\nService was good.

I gave it a try anyway and after one bite I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. The waiter saw that I didn't like my food and instead of getting me something new or taking the untouched meal off my tab, he quickly had the bus boy take it way as soon as my girl friend was done with her dish. I said something to the bus boy about how the dish was too fatty to eat but he ignored me.  Immediately there after waiter came over and dropped the check and quickly scurried off before I could say anything.

I have frequented the Tenderloin location, and had my doubts of authenticity, as I sat at my swanky clear chair amongst throngs of Hayes Valley hipsters, but this Lers Ros Thai is just as good as the original. Here are some tidbits of food reviews based on my visit:\n\n- Pad Thai: I always order it. I love the chewy noodles, and the unauthentic flavor of a good ol' Americanized pad thai. It was pretty good here, kinda small, but definitely not the best I had in terms of flavor (lacking) and noodle texture (mushy).\n-  Tom Kha: I never get coconut soup, but this was one of the better ones. It comes with chicken and shrimp, and I find their shrimp here is generally.... frozen tasting. You know, kinda pasty and odd tasting. Broth was good though and generous in portion; it comes out in a flaming pot!\n- Pork Shoulder: This was tiny, but it was DEEELIcious. More delicious than the crispy pork dish which I thought I would love.\n- Crispy Pork: This was tasty, and extra fatty. However, the skin was so crispy that I had a hard time chewing it.\n- Pad Woon Sen: No\n- Pad Krao?: Ground pork with basil. So simple. Who knew it could be so delicious?\n- Green Curry: Typical. But good. Wish there were fewer carrots.\n- Duck Larb: Their famous duck larb was good, but just as fatty as I remember. It was really tasty paired with a leaf of lettuce. \n- Mango sticky rice: Delicious as usual, it's mango season! Sticky rice was cooked a little too al dente.\n\nOverall, food here is good depending on what you order, especially for such an upscale-style Thai chain. I would recommend making a reservation as it gets shockingly busy at dinner even on a weekday. My one favorite out of all the dishes was the pork shoulder and pad krao, but I can't wait to return to try some other dishes. \n\nTip: They take AMEX and are willing to split cards amongst even a group of 8!", "author": "Jess C."}

I had the duck salad and the pork belly both of which were delicious.. the pork belly comes by itself and is just cubes of porks that are fried so they are perfectly crispy with a slightly tangy sauce. the duck salad is pretty spicy but a little sour. not the best i've ever had but stlil pretty good.

They asked if they could bring all the dishes at once, which is already a little pushy, and were grabbing plates back as soon as we finished.

When I walked in with my friend they asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar even though there were tables open. When we opted for the table we received some dirty looks.\n\nThey didn't even give us menus when we sat down. Instead, they decided to give the two men who came in after us menus, then proceeded to take their order while my companion and I waited. And waited. And waited. When I finally flagged down one of the servers (come to find out she only serves the food) she pointed that \"she'll take your order\" to one of the passing servers. Instead of having our order taken we waited some more.\n\nWhile waiting, the two men who came in after us received their food and another couple who sat behind us, who we watched order after us as well, also get their food. WTF people. That's a big pet peeve of mine.\n\nSo, my companion received his food first. He ordered the BBQ chicken and some other chicken dish (sorry, the food is forgetful). The BBQ chicken tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for a week then they decided to cook it before it went bad. It was extremely overcooked. His other chicken dish was minced up and had an excessive amount of sauce poured all over it. Which seems to be the trend here. They just douse everything in sauce hoping you won't taste the poor quality of the food.\n\nI ordered the garlic pork and the Chicken with cashews. The pork was also overcooked as was my chicken. Both were swimming in sauce. The pork tasted old and rubbery. In fact, the gum I'm chewing now is not enough to take the bad taste out of my mouth. The chicken with cashews... haha, what a joke! It's like they opened a can of chicken noodle soup, took out the noodles and threw in some cashews. I was so hungry so I just ate all of the rice.\n\nI'm so disappointed in this place because this is my first time trying it and I was hoping to find a new Thai spot. I normally go up the street to Jardin Thai (which is by far the best in the Tenderloin area IMO). They need to hire more attentive servers for the lunch rush, and the girl serving the food needs to stop touching her hair every 5 seconds.

The ambience is decidedly more Osha-like than the casual and efficient location in the TL. With that, you are paying a few dollars more, and ultimately getting much less food, with slower service. The food and plates might be more nicely arranged, but literally about half the size with some dishes, and quite frankly I'm not impressed. \n\nCome here if you want a more elevated dining experience in a cute, safer neighborhood...

We particularly enjoy their soup Tom Kha Kai, whole fresh sea bass Tom Yum Pla Kra Pong, and Pad Thai. Their problem (and I tell you it is a big problem) is their service. Their service was never that good to begin with, but it has even gone worse recently.\n\nOur waitress today, from taking the order to delivering the food to busing the table, was borderline rude while we were being nice and polite the entire time. She seriously looked extremely unhappy and did not want to be there. She kept trying to clear our plates when we were clearly still eating, and when she walked into my chair (the space was cramped where I sat), she turned back and half shouted to me \"can you move your chair in a little bit?\" instead of apologizing to me. My very flat chest was already against the table, where else do you want me to move to!!!\n\nAnd it's not just our waitress. I felt that their entire waitstaff shared the same vibe. My out of town guests also noticed the poor service and made comments about it. Reviews about their bad service by other yelpers were also true. While we were waiting, there was a guy who told the host he wanted his money back cause he had been waiting for his take-away for an hour. He was really pissed. My friend also noticed that the host was telling everybody, either waiting for food or table, just another minute when it was clearly not!\n\nI have noticed the wait time at this location since it opened has become shorter and shorter. It's probably an indication of this restaurant is going downhill.\n\nHere is my advice. If you are looking for a quick solid thai meal and do not care about the service, then go. However, if you are looking for a pleasant evening out, having a good conversation with your friends, and impressing your out of town guests, then go somewhere else. You will be surprised how bad service (even if the food is good) can really ruin your entire dinner experience.\n\nI have said many times before, running a restaurant is much more than just producing good food. Treating your guests with respect is the very least you got to be able to do. So for me, I will spend my hard earned money somewhere else.", "author": "Elin K."}

It's what happened after I dug into the Som Tom Koong Yang shredded papaya salad at Lers Ros. I don't think I've ever been to a Thai restaurant that has even approached the level of spiciness I think Thai people are used to, but I think this might have come close. It just creeps up on you. \n\nThis may have been the best Thai meal I've had in the city. I came here for a late dinner, and you know you're in the zone when you get a parking spot right out front. They were very nice about reservations, and good thing we did, because it was still pretty crowded at 9pm on a Sunday night.\n\nThe food here is fantastic. We got mostly the standard Thai dishes this time around, but I will not hesitate to come back for the more unique dishes like the garlic frog or the boar meat, or maybe the stir-fried alligator. The prices are very reasonable, and the portions are fair. I doubt you'll leave hungry. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n1) Beef Pad Prik Thai: Tender pieces of beef prepared with onions and peppers. Very tender, very flavorful. \n\n2) Moo Phing: Marinated BBQ pork on skewers. Large slices of pork grilled on the skewer with a chili and rice powder sauce. It kind of reminded me of the bright red sweet chinese beef jerky I used to love eating as a kid. Very good. \n\n3) Pad Thai: Can't seem to enter a Thai restaurant without ordering pad thai. Noodles were very good, and the whole dish was surprisingly delicate compared to the kind of messy versions you get at a lot of other Thai restaurants. Mix in the fresh and crunchy bean sprouts and the dish was a hit. Nice big prawns in it as well. \n\n4) Som Tom Koong Yang: Shredded papaya salad with grilled prawns. I loved it, but I was this close to asking if they had a glass of milk because it was pretty spicy. I admit my threshold for spicy is not great, but everyone at the table thought it had some real heat. The only kind of puzzling thing about the salad is that it comes with a quarter head of cabbage. Not shredded or anything, it's just sitting there. Am I supposed to eat it? Is it garnish? \n\n5) Red curry: I found out recently that a lot of Thai restaurants use food coloring or some other mild color additive like spinach juice (green) or paprika (red) for their curries so it won't be as spicy. Not sure if they do here, but I don't really care because it was still pretty good. I really like coconut milk curries, and the red curr fit the bill. Lots of vegetables and chicken, went great with the jasmine rice. \n\n6) Tofu with chili and green beans: I was a little scared of this dish when it was brought out because I think underneath all the red chili was some green beans and tofu. But surprisingly, it wasn't that spicy. Green beans were bright and succulent, while the fried tofu soaked up the flavor of the chilies. \n\nService was very friendly and efficient. The place didn't seem huge, but they use the space well. There's a bar area with a TV, so I guess you can go for a meal at the bar while you're watching the game. That doesn't sound like a bad idea.

So, I'll break the typical mathematical rule of rounding up on odd numbers, and stick with a 3 star. \n\nSo, to the real feedback... We made a reservation and arrived with a group of 10. Fortunately, the table was ready when we arrived - we were a few minutes late (whoops). We started the evening off with beer & wine, and was pleased with the size and variety of their menu. A good mix of domestic and imported beers, and local and international wines. Beer was more than reasonably priced - $4, and wine started at $7 a glass. With a few libations under our belt, we moved on to appetizers. We ordered the spring/egg rolls, and chicken satay. The rolls were good, but the chicken satay was just ok. Frankly, it wasn't anything special, but then again, is there ever such a thing as special blow your mind chicken satay? Probably not.\n\nAs for the main courses, we shouldn't have ordered nearly as much food as we did. We basically ordered an entree per person, and since our group was female heavy we learned that was too much. I ate primarily the Pad See Ew - beef, which was mediocre. Other entrees in our group were red curry (duck), yellow curry (chicken), pad thai, sesame chicken, stir fries, etc. \n\nAll in all, not a bad experience, but the food was not anything impressive. I do commend their good service and very reasonable pricing (each entree was ~$10-$13).", "author": "Kevin C."}

Although, not entirely too far, the difference it makes on the clientele is amazing. This place was packed! It's housed in the same building as Nojo and The Grove. Inside they try to match modern decor in a venue that goes for the hipster bare building look: no drywall and exposed pipes above.\n\nWith every table filled, I couldn't hold a conversation with anyone, let alone think to myself. I felt bad for the couple next to us, because it seemed like they were on their first date. Despite the location, the other Lers Ros wins in my mind because the noise level is obnoxiously loud. \n\nThe food is still good no matter where you go.\n1. Koh Moo Yang - great way to start. pork shoulder that is crispy smoky and comes with a sauce that blends incredibly well\n2. Tom Kha Kai - very cool presentation for a soup. It comes in a donut shaped metal pot with a flame shooting through the middle to keep the soup sizzling hot. This soup is similar to the Tom Yum but with coconut in the broth.\n3. Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob - my favorite dish!!!!! crispy skinned pork belly sauteed in their house spicy sauce. Amazing! Get it!\n4. Rad Nah - avoid...fat rice noodles drowned in thick soup broth with chicken and some veggies. Pretty forgetable.\n5. Pad Kra Prow - very traditional Thai dish that consists of your choice of meat minced and sauteed with their house sauce and thrown on top of rice.

I asked how much later? The response was, I don't know. Hmm, do you really think I can show up with a group of 18 and wait around indefinitely for a table?  Do you think it's easy to find another place and communicate the change to 18 people in less than 3 hours time?  \n\nI've worked at restaurants before.

Beautiful room, great service, delicious food, and nice wines.  The food is more expensive than most Bay Area Thai places, but well worth it.  The wine prices are standard -- about $9 for wines by the glass.\n\nWe shared 3 dishes: a green papaya salad, vibrant with lime and fish sauce and packing plenty of heat.  They offered it with several optional toppings (crab, prawns, or salted egg) but we went for the plain version.  Next we shared a special \"shrimp paste platter\" and a dish from the regular menu, Koong Pad Phed (medium shrimp, though they call them \"prawns\" on the menu, with chili paste, kaffir lime leaves, green peppercorns, and galingal).  The Koong Pad Phed was delicious, but the shrimp paste platter was the hit of the evening.  Lots of broccoli, steamed cabbage, cooked bamboo, cucumber, and squares of an omelet-like egg dish, plus two small whole deep-fried fish, and two raw Thai pea eggplant, served  with a very spicy, pungent dipping sauce.  It was wonderful, and I'd definitely order it again.  \n\nIf you don't like spicy food, though, this may not be your place.  Everything was hot-spicy, and the shrimp paste dish made me sweat -- a rarity, even with spicy food.\n\nThe dessert menu is short.  I was tempted by the fried banana with ice cream (they had several choices of ice cream flavors), but while our mouths craved something cool and sweet we were too full to tackle it.  Since it was early (this was a pre-concert dinner) we had time to walk a block to Christopher Elbow and get some exquisite chocolates.", "author": "Robert W."}

However, whenever the waitress was around, she was always extremely friendly.\n\nFood: We ordered the rabbit (chef's special) and shared a beef Pad See-Eu. The Pad See-Eu was good, but not great. The rabbit was not so good. It came with their 'house chili sauce' which tasted like any other sweet and spicy sauce. Rabbit meat must be very lean as well because there was more bone than meat on every piece! Also, they asked if we wanted brown or white rice with the rabbit dish. We chose white rice, but in retrospect, that was not a dish that needed a starchy accompaniment.\n\nAmbiance: Dim lighting, but loud since it's such a small restaurant. People standing inside to wait crowds the bar area a little and makes seating near the door uncomfortable.\n\nOverall it was okay.

The week prior, I had had three excellent Thai meals in the East Bay  and in SF (restaurants and a catered event), but my palate still hungry for those tangy, fresh and crisp favors you'd expect from a good Thai salad, and the satisfying smoothness of the iconic Pad Thai.\n\nAlas, I give a star each for the clean and modern atmosphere, and the beautiful wine list, and walk-in wine cavern I was able to view along the hallway. I have no stars dedicated for the food. The seafood salad, which came with fish balls, prawns, calamari, a quarter of an iceberg lettuce and what seemed like a whole raw sliced onion. The tangy lime dressing was on point, but the calamari and the prawns were chewy (maybe the idea was that they would be cooked using the lime). The killer was the amount of raw onion - usually a quick pickling makes an onion a delight to eat, but these slices were very 'flavor forward' and fairly inedible. I was still looking forward to the pad thai - if there is one dish that should be done right at a Thai establishment, this is it. Sigh, I would have rather chewed on the onions. Sweet, sticky (heavy on the cornstarch?), salmon-orange in color - monotone in flavor - with a sprinkling of the other traditional components. \n\nPluses - the staff was friendly.\n\nI had high hopes since I have had great experiences at the sister restaurant on Larkin last year, maybe that's why I'm a tad more critical.", "author": "Basil B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-09", "description": "We started with the duck larb- it was the best out the bunch we've ordered. It was really flavorful and the duck was roasted well. It had a good ratio of tender pieces  and crispy portions of duck. We shared one order between two people, but could've easily killed and order for each of us. We liked the Pra ram khai ( chicken breast w/ peanut sauce.) The steam from the spinach that sits underneath the chicken has a tendency to water-down the dish if you let it sit too long. With that said it was tasty- the peanut sauce tasted fresh. It tastes like chicken satay, but stir fried with additional peanut sauce on top. The Koong pad khing ( stir fry prawns with ginger and mushrooms) was ok- the sauce wasn't overwhelming and it didn't have that gelatinous texture that you get with a lot of saucy cheap Asian foods. It did taste fresh but we  were expecting the ginger flavor to be more present. The plus side was the huge prawn. The pad Thai was ok- the portion was huge. Service was great.

The peanut sauce on the praram was quite different then I am used to, it wasn't thick or super peanuty. I didn't like that the tofu in the praram was just raw. The fried tofu was excellent however the sweet chili sauce had a bit too much vinegar. Overall it was a decent deal for $9.75.

I walked in at exactly noon, it took me about 5 minutes to look at my menu and order, and I kid you not, at around 12:10pm, I had my steaming fresh food right in front of me. I'm assuming this was made possible because they have large quantities of the lunch specials available at the ready for the lunch crowd, but man I was amazed. The food was really good too! It came with a tiny iceberg lettuce salad with some slightly oversweet dressing. The green curry was on par with some of my favorite green curries and had just the right amount of spice to it. They used a green, striped eggplant for it which was interesting. It was slightly undercooked but I'm not gonna give them a hard time for that when they got me my food in 5 minutes.

However, please explain why, when we are the only two persons in the restaurant at 5:00 on a Saturday, the next 2 people come in and they are seated next to us our tables within two feet of each other.  Each table was for two but if pushed together would seat four.  We asked to be moved and the hostess rolled her eyes, went to the host stand, checked her book, came back and said she could move us.  We moved our own menus and water glasses.  Sat down at our new table and the hostess was glaring at my friend so we asked for a manager.  We were told no manager.  I exchanged seats with my friend so they would not be looking at each other. We ordered the food and drink.  To order the food, two different waiters came at separate times to take our order. (Sorry, already ordered with the first waiter) The appetizer ribs were extremely salty and fatty, bordering on inedible - I actually thought it was kitchen sabotage/retaliation.  Our wine came after the appetizer arrived.  Had a red curry dish that was very good and a \"hot\" calamari saute that was also good and definitely hot/spicy.\nAfter our appetizer arrived, the next two people entered the restaurant.  Of course, they were seated directly next to us, again within two feet at a separated 4-top..  These two customers hesitated before sitting but decided to stay.  Now there are six person in the restaurant.  Some spacing would be nice.  We were out of there before six with no one else entering up to then.\nAlso, please train your likable but clumsy young staff to be able to explain the food preparation style and ingredients in each dish.

We ordered roasted duck, which is on the menu they then returned and said they did not serve roasted duck but we could have stewed duck.  Not what we wanted.  \nI would not go back despite the food being decent.

It was strange though because my curry was hot.  The curry was delicious though.  My sister's pad thai took much longer than expected.  We had to speak to someone to check on the status and she never came back to tell us it was on it's way.  The good thing was when it did finally come out, it was super hot and tasty.  When we were done, we waited a very long time to get the bill and again had to ask someone for our check.  Overall, the food was good but the service was a little slow.

The food is definitely presented really nicely, the taste, colors, textures and the way the dishes are cooked all seem really well done. However my biggest complaints are the following:\n1. NEVER put a person who doesn't speak English at the front door of your restaurant on a Friday or Saturday or ANYDAY who can't welcome you, ask how many in your party, and then tell you how long the wait will be. Tonight's \"hostess\".. or more like \"losttess\" did not even say Good Evening to me when we came in  and it took 5 minutes and 4 tries to get her to understand that my name was NOT even on the list yet.. all I wanted to do was ADD my name. You only get one chance to make a first impression, and this place made a bad one right off the bat.\n2. Tables are too too small and way too close together. There's nothing worse than an owner who is so greedy that they substitute customers dining comfort with trying to pack more tables in than possible. The table next to mine tonight was so close the person hit me twice with her elbow..Really?\n3. Staff is very poorly trained, and dishes did not come out in the order they were asked for. Rice first? then one entree, then three entrees back to back? wrong, wrong wrong..\n4. NOISE LEVEL IS INSANE. Forget this place if you want ANY kind of intimacy or the ability to hear or speak to your dining date. Plus, then they play music? I had a sore throat and a headache by the time we left. All stone wall, and tile floors make for an echo chamber. \n\nFinal call: Good food, fairly priced, small'lish portions, and horrible manners and lack of professionalism by staff combined with eating on an airport runway.. it's ok, but it's definitely NOT worth more than 3 stars.", "author": "Brian W."}

I have not tried the TL location so I'm not sure how it compares.  That said, judged on its own merits, this place allowed me to indulge my Thai cravings for a reasonable price and leave happy :)\n\nWe walked in on a Thursday evening without reservations and were seated immediately - a positive start to the evening.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant; there was a mix of couples and groups in a pretty wide age group (mid-twenties to sixties).  The tables, chairs, artwork, and even bar engender a very modern, uncluttered vibe (unlike other Thai places, especially in the TL where I feel like spotlessness and grace are missing from the venue.)\n\nThe staff was extremely attentive - constantly checking in on us.  We ordered three items which the two of us split: 1) papaya salad with grilled shrimp. We ordered it spicy and it actually was SPICY. They didn't hold back in the kitchen which was a refreshing change from other places that are too scared to give the customer what she is asking for.  The salad was also surprisingly filling (could've definitely been a meal on its own) and  also absolutely delicious.  2) We ordered the black pepper beef; I wasn't a big fan of the beef (too chewy for me, though the black pepper sauce was tasty) but my partner loved the dish.  3) The red curry vegetarian with eggplant was a solid dish, though not good enough to order again? I'd be more likely to explore the menu and try something new.  4) We also had an order of sticky rice. It didn't do a good job of soaking up the curry sauce however... unfortunately kind of a deal breaker for me (I'll probably stick to regular jasmine rice next time!)\n\nAlso ordered both sake  and singha beer = the latter paired perfectly with the black pepper beef and red curry. \n\nOverall, it was an enjoyable (and affordable) dinner -- making it pretty certain that I will be back soon!", "author": "Kimya P."}

After being promised my order within 45-50 minutes, I ended up calling the restaurant after waiting over 90 minutes. Keep in mind that I am about a mile away from the restaurant. No apology until I asked for one. When I got the food, it was cold, and didn't even include utensils, napkins, etc. I hate to give bad reviews, but the service on this occasion was truly unacceptable.", "author": "Sean A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-28", "description": "Really, really good Thai food- very nice ambiance. Surprisingly reasonable starting at $8/$9 for entrees. I had Red Curry Tofu. Deliciously rich, full of flavor, perfectly cooked vegetables and meaty tofu. Very, very good. My partner had Yellow Curry which was also delicious. We were warmly welcomed with a big Thai smile by the sweet hostess that made us feel right at home. We sat outside which afforded a little more privacy as the inside, while very pretty, was a bit crowded.  The only reason they don't get 5 Stars is our waitress wasn't very attentive - maybe because we were outside and they were extremely busy? And they charge a little extra for rice....I'm not cheap, I'm Italian and this seems to me a little like serving Marinara Sauce but charging extra if you actually want it on top of spaghetti.  I'll change my mindset for this place though because the food was fantastic. This will be our go-to place for Thai. That says it all.", "author": "Richard G."}

We came early at 5:45pm for a 7:30pm performance at the Opera (great Tosca production by the way), so didn't have to wait much for seating/food. Not sure what's the deal with complaints about pricing. We shared 4 dishes between the two of us: great Chicken Satay, a dish of raw shrimp split in half and coated with a garlic-chili pepper sauce (miam..), a rice noodle dish with pork (perhaps a bit over-garlicky), and a great dessert of sticky rice with mango. We also had 3 drinks (one beer, and 2 glasses of wine), and the bill came at less than $60. For downtown SF, I don't see how you can be more reasonable. The staff was very friendly. You could tell they were making an effort to be so, but it was actually very refreshing and cute. All in all a great evening.", "author": "Bruno M."}

I unfortunately have only had take out here and wasn't able to experience the whole dining experience of lers ros and I've only had two dishes but I have a good feeling about this place. The first thing I had here was one of their rice dishes that comes with crab. I didn't particularly enjoy this dish because there were still bits of crab shell in my dish, so I wont be ordering that again, but i give them props for using real crab instead of the imitation one. The second dish I had here was the pork shoulder appetizer recommended to me by my coworker and boy oh boy was this dish good. Definitely worth coming back for... and I did. I'm excited to try some other dishes they have. Service seems okay. I never expect great service from Thai restaurants mainly because I never get anything thats impressed me before.", "author": "Josephine S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-30", "description": "Food was quite authentic, and the spice was quite flavorful - more than just adding red pepper.  The beef in the Original Thai section and Pad Thai were great.  We ordered a 1L of Austrian red wine for $32, which was quite decent for the price.  A couple of the vegetarian dishes were a letdown - they were quite bland.  The place has good atmosphere.  Service is friendly but far from stellar.", "author": "Andrew D."}

The pad thai, that Michael Bauer recommended, is delicious. The pad kee mao, not so much. BF enjoyed the pork belly. When trying a new place, best to stck to their signature dishes. Service is friendly and ambiance is pleasant. The noise level is high but didn't bother me.", "author": "Presto G."}
