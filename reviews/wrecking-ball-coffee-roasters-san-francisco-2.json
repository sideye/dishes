By far, this is one of the most expensive places to get coffee.  \n\nI appreciate coffee that's not Starbucks and usually don't mind paying for it, but $6.00 is steep when I'm getting it elsewhere for $4.25 (with the almond milk). \n\nOverall, I like the coffee here and maybe other people don't mind not getting the cup discount or the steep price, but this will not be a regular type  visit to this place going forward for me.", "author": "J B."}

When our first drink came out the barista handed it to us, but the second drink she put down on the table behind the bar instead of the bar itself or handing it to us, and didn't acknowledge when I said thank you. It can be intimidating to go to a new place, and we definitely felt like the odd ones out after our interaction with the employees.\n\nThere also is almost no seating, so this is not a good place to sit and relax with your coffee.

There's a 3 small 2 people tables outside, perfect for people watching and catching up with your pals and a long bench inside. Although prices are meh, $5 for a cup, it's pretty standard for SF prices. \n\nMy friend got a skinny latte and i opted for the Karl, a signature drink of theirs. It's an almond milk latte, with cardamon, honey and some other spices. Very well made, great flavors, nutty, smokey, and not too sweet. \n\nI would definitely come back here for a nice cup of coffee event though it's on the pricier side and enjoy the atmosphere. They're also infamous for their adorable pineapple wallpaper (all the blogger girls take a photo in front of this for their instragram). Over, lovely experience, but do remember that seating is limited and it's not a place to go hang/chill for a long period of time with your laptop.", "author": "Diane T."}

I know that's growing in popularity, but it still hasn't caught on mainstream and people just don't know what they're missing out on.  \n\nAnyway, moving along....  The space is adorable.  I love the fun wallpaper from Rifle Paper Co.  So many coffee shops are so masculine and/or industrial - it's nice to see them having a bit of fun.  Especially since the rest of the space is actually SUPER space age-y - they have SO MANY cool coffee gadgets.  It's really fun to see them get so precise and scientific about things!\n\nThey have a pretty legit selection of snacks, but their hardboiled eggs are the bomb.  Yes, they're a little expensive for just being boiled eggs.....but it's SO NICE to be able to get something other than sugary pastries.  When I went last weekend with a little hangover, these eggs saved my life.  I actually saw a guy go in and wait in a decently long line for coffee....just to buy half a dozen eggs and nothing else.\n\nNow, to the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance...their seasonal beverage, Karl the Latte.  This is the BEST coffee drink I've ever had.  It was fancy green tea plus two shots of espresso plus almond milk plus honey plus cardamom plus cocoa powder (the latter sort of just being dusted on top).  The drink was simultaneously sweet and savory.  Like a coffee rubbed barbequed meat plus chocolate cake.  I know I'm probably making it sound disgusting, but it was straight up the best drink ever.  I want to go back for me, like, ASAP.\n\nI'm going to go map out how long it'll take me to walk here on Saturday.  #LOVE", "author": "Tay H."}

Okay, I'll stop.\n\nI don't quite understand why Wrecking Ball Coffee Roasters isn't a bigger deal yet. It's run by Trish Rothgeb, who, outside of being a licensed Q-Grader and a Q-Trainer (among many other accolades), also supposedly (if you believe all the gossip coming out of the coffee vine) has the uncanny ability to tell what blend/roast outcomes will be like just by simply smelling the beans.\n\nHer partner in crime, Nicholas Cho, is on the Board of Directors for the SCAA (the people that grade potential Q Graders, the ones that set the standards, etc.) and also the Board for the World Barista Championships (the competition that brought us Paul Bassett, Tim Wendelboe, et al.)\n\nSo, with some of the world's foremost experts on the handling, roasting, blending, and serving of coffee backing it up, Wrecking Ball should easily be able to serve up some of America's best--no, the planet's best coffee, and I really think it does. Another coffee enthusiast friend (who informed me of this establishment's existence) and I stopped here on a sunny Marina/Cow Hollow afternoon after a hefty Dim Sum lunch. I ordered the Guatemala Huehuetenago and he got the espresso, and the Kalita pour-over of the former (an interesting choice in a market that seems to be over-saturated with Hario and Chemex) probably was my eureka! coffee moment.\n\nIt's hard to describe the momentary bliss I felt with the first sip of my Guatemala, as the following sips were just as delightful, if not more interesting than the first--before I tried the the pour-over at Wrecking Ball, it had never crossed my mind that the flavor and the bouquet of coffee could change so drastically even with the slightest difference in serving temperature (try it next time--take a sip when the coffee is piping hot, a minute after that, and two minutes after that)\n\nI will never see coffee the same way after that fateful afternoon on Union St. You could even say that it wrecked me.

The latte was serviceable but nothing to speak of. And the cortado was served in a large cup just a tiny bit smaller than the latte. It tasted like a small latte. Correct me if I'm wrong, but a cortado is usually served in a very small cup and the espresso/milk proportions are different than just a small latte. It was really weird. They look like they know what they're doing so maybe it's just their odd way of making one. Anyway, I would not return because of this.", "author": "Ari R."}

Perhaps he could have more efficiently brewed cups of coffee with the Japanese Kalita Wave-dripper pour over cones he so champions. \nThere was something a little strange going on here.\nObviously a lot of attention has been put into the design of this place. The pour-over bar is a large white table with electric scales built into it to closely monitor the brewing process. \nI'm not sure if this was the usual procedure for brewing coffee, but it appears that the water was heated by filling the small pour-over pitcher with water, then heating it on a hot-pad type burner with an electric thermometer in it. \nThis is obviously more time consuming than using the modern hot water machines that other modern coffee shops use, but ok - maybe this is somehow more authentic.\nThe problem was when our barista hit some sort of technical problem while brewing cup 2 of 2 (perhaps accidentally using 2 filters?). This led to that cup being aborted halfway through and the whole process starting over from the beginning, including boiling the water.\nThis took an incredibly long time. Meanwhile the other barista was putting out espresso based drinks at a conventional pace to the other customers crowding the small shop. \nI was not in a hurry. I'm very interested in the technique and the equipment and the process and all that stuff. But holy cow. This probably took about 25 minutes. I can't imagine trying to convince conventional coffee consumers this was somehow better than what they are used to. or convince coffee aficionados that this is somehow better than making pour-over coffee using a chemex pot or hario v60 cones. \nThe coffee was ok. Pretty good light/medium roast third-wave style fresh, quality single origin coffee that many have become familiar with in this day and age.\n\nThe single best thing about this place was that they offered a pour over decaf that was delicious. This was the cup they got right at the beginning. A+ on that one. \n\nthe people working there were nice enough.\nI now understand that the various coffee beans are sold in different size bags so that they are around the same price point. 16oz is too big of a commitment for me though.", "author": "RK W."}
