After doing some Yelp searches and investigating, I determined that I would swing by for lunch the next time I was able to work from home or come home early. \n\nA month ago, I was able to make the times work and swung by for some take out. I got a lasagna for my boyfriend and a spaghetti carbonara for myself. I had my spaghetti less than 10 min after walking out their doors and saved the lasagna for my boyfriend for dinner. Wow. I was totally blown away. The noodles had a great texture and the sauce was rich and flavorful, without being too greasy. Boyfriend had the lasagna later that night and agreed that it was great. \n\nI'll definitely be back the next time I'm home during the day - great atmosphere, friendly people and amazing food!", "author": "Ada C."}

We gave him a party at my job, and we purchased about 10 lasagnas for the staff. So you know we're in SFO, so everyone is gluten-free, sugar-free, fat-free, dairy-free, nut free, grain-free, faux meat, keto dietish, basically a water and ice cube diet. So I run into the party and see that we had all meatless lasagnas, and I was skeptical but packed a doggy bag of truffle and mushroom lasagne. So walking back to the BART I started eating it. Y'ALLLLL OMG! Like I want them to cater my wedding, baby shower, divorce party, funeral, the whole shit!! \n\nPeople......in all honestly, I was eating, singing, and twerking at the same time on the way to the BART. Eating this lasagna caused the skies opened up, it turned sunny, homeless folks got housing, the ghetto pigeons stood in place, all of the honking stopped, all of the stoplights turned green..\n\nEating Marcellas is like having the winning lotto numbers. I'm definitely not mature to have one nearby my house, because it would be my new gym... or church.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU someones nonna who created that angelic recipe that gathered my whole entire existence.", "author": "Nickey H."}

A lady called in because her date hasn't been responsive after their first lunch date. She thought they had a great date but he has only responded to her texts with emojis. \n\nThe hosts call the guy up and he said, he would never go on a date with her again. Apparently, she had one too many margaritas (he lost count after three) and she became sloppy - slurring her words and spitting on him. She even did kickboxing AND karate outside the restaurant on Burlingame Avenue!\n\nDAAAAMN GUURRRL, you sure know how to party...and it's only 1 pm! Hmmm, what happens at midnight?! \n\nWell, if they went to Marcella's Lasagneria for their lunch date, there wouldn't have been any drunken shenanigans and perhaps even a second date! \n\nMarcella's Lasagneria is a cute, old skool Italian eatery (caf\u00e9-sized) serving a myriad of housemade lasagnas and pastas. Both are available by the tray with a 24 hour advanced order. No hard liquor so there's no chance of getting sloppy. \n\nThey also bottle their own sauces and aiolis that are available for purchase.\n\nThe only drawback is their very limited hours. They're only open on the weekdays from 11:30 am - 4:30 pm so it's taken me 6 years to finally pay a visit. \n\n(Per their website, the full menu is available until 3:30 pm, then it's pick-up/to-go for lasagna only until 4:30 pm.) \n\nTo my surprise, it's pretty much full service expect you pay at the counter when you're done eating. \n\nEverything sounded great on the menu but I knew it would be a long time before I could return so for my first time, the son of the owner recommended the Abruzzo Lasagna w/ housemade Italian sausage, spicy tomato sauce ($14.50): https://bit.ly/2joX3Jm which comes with a side salad. \n\nThe lasagna they serve here is unique, it's six very thin layers of noodles with melty cheese, b\u00e9chamel, and your choice of filling (sausage, mushrooms, eggplant, bolognese, butternut squash, etc). \n\nMy Abruzzo lasagna arrived bubbling hot with crisp, caramelized edges of cheese which I enjoy. There was a good ratio of melty cheese, sausage crumbles, and robust tomato sauce (wasn't spicy). However, because the noodles are thin, they're very soft. I like my noodles with a bite. Nonetheless, it was a very satisfying meal and I took the leftovers home to enjoy for dinner. \n\nThe father-son owners are super warm and friendly. The lasagna took over 15 minutes to warm up so do say, yes (!) to the complimentary bread accompanied with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.\n\nVery casual atmosphere with a handful of tables inside. The dog-friendly outdoor seating is quaint and is perfect for a lunch date.   \n \nI can see why Marcella's Lasagneria is a neighborhood favorite - warm service, good lasagnas, and reasonably priced. I must return to try their ravioli with black truffle sauce - I just hope it doesn't take me another 6 years.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I was on a college trip from Boston and had a very carefully planned itinerary (a group of us were in the Bay area to tour tech companies/startups and such) so we ended up in Dogpatch for one visit. I was looking for a place to get lunch and it was during an absolute downpour. Yelp seemed to like this place, so I figured I'd give it a try, and boy am I glad I did. First of all, they immediately sat me and were incredibly nice, which was very comforting being by myself and coming in from the rain. I was pretty hungry so I ordered the Caprese salad and the Ravioli al Tartufo. \n\nCaprese - The ingredients were clearly very fresh, and having the greens tossed in EVOO was great - I'm personally not a huge fan of balsamic with Caprese so it was a nice touch, along with the oregano on the mozzarella.\nRavioli - I tried so hard not to inhale it and savor it as much as I could because it was SO GOOD and extremely comforting on a cool, rainy day. The pasta itself was wonderful and the black truffle sauce was amazing with it. **Pro tip** if you get bread, use it to soak up any leftover sauce after you finish the pasta. \n\nEverything I had here was fantastic - even the bread! Also, the owners were so genuinely nice and took care of me very attentively. But the craziest part of all this? I just came back here again about a month ago and ordered the same thing, and they remembered me from my order! It had been 9 MONTHS since I first went there and they still remembered me. Amazing.\n\nTL;DR it may not be fancy, but the ingredients are fresh, the food is perfectly prepared, and the people are wonderful.

Deep rich flavor, super creamy and truffle-y sauce.  5/5\n\n* Bolognese lasagna:  I got an end portion and so my piece was likely drier and had less filling than my coworkers, as this was my least favorite but a couple of them said it was their most favorite.  2/5\n\n* Mushroom lasagna:  The mushroom flavor wasn't as strong as I liked but the overall creaminess was a plus.  4/5\n\n* Bianca lasagna:  Lovely rich bechamel and cheese sauce with mild hints of pancetta.  More pancetta would make it perfect but this was still wonderful.  4.5/5\n\nService was a bit rude and slow -- our waiter (seems to be the owner) didn't tell us any specials and gave us grief for our party not all arriving at the same time, even though there were plenty of open tables.

This is the best lasagna I have ever eaten. Period. \n\nI have been here countless times. Each experience is equal to the last (I hate when people say better than the last, it detracts from all the other times they have gone). \n\nThat is the first question I asked myself as I entered this modest Father/Son Italian eatery was a simple one: What is a \"Lasagneria\"? \n\nKnowing the answer to this question is completely irrelevant. \n\nThere is no point in trying to find another \"Lasagneria\". This is the one. The only one. Marcella's wins. If you've eaten here you no longer need to search for any other lasagna anywhere ever. You want to google Lasagneria? \n\nI will save you some time. Your search will return Marcella's. And it isn't because other Lasagnerias don't exist. I am sure they do. It is because no other Lasagnerias in the area are relevant. \n\nA day may come when you think to yourself, \"What about that fun family Italian joint down the road?\"\n\nForget it. \n\nOr maybe you will think, \"How about that fancy Italian restaurant with a bunch of Michelin stars?\" \n\nNope. Wrong. The correct answer was go straight to Marcella's Lasagneria. This lasagna will blow you away. \n\nOkay. Breathe. Now to pair that with some evidence. \n\nService: Every time I come into Marcella's, I feel at home. G and Massimo treat every customer with care and respect. G often works the front end of the restaurant with other excellent servers like Rory. All of them are speedy, thoughtful, polite, and have a sense of humor. If you'd like to sit quietly in the back and shovel food into your mouth - you can. But I'd recommend striking up some conversation. \n\nAmbience: It's a Father/Son Italian eatery in the Dogpatch. It isn't Saison, but it has a uniquely charming atmosphere. You feel like you've been transported out of the normal SF hustle and bustle straight to an Italian eatery in Florence. Or maybe not. I haven't been to Italy so I wouldn't actually know. \n\nFood: \n\nI will review my personal favorite: The Bianca Lasagna\n\nLet's begin with the thinly prepared sheets of hand-crafted semolina pasta. Each pasta sheet is delicate, and about as thick as cardstock. The pasta is layered among creamy Bechamel sauce, pancetta, and a variety of herbs and possibly spices. The bottom sheet of pasta coalesces and crisps up with the cheese and pancetta creating a chewy and delicious foundation to the perfect slice of lasagna. \n\nAs you work you way through the block of fresh pasta, melted cheese, pancetta, and love, you may begin to question your morals. Should you take out the person next to you so you can eat whatever they ordered? Don't do it. That is murder and is extremely wrong and illegal. Instead, you should call over the waiter or waitress and order a tray to go. I have shamefully done that before. Except when I called, I pretended there was a party that night so G and Massimo wouldn't know the entire thing wasn't only me and pass silent, but visible judgement. \n\nAnyway, all their ingredients are incredibly fresh and delicious. This is arguably the best food I have eaten at this price point. Roughly $15-18 for the meal of dreams.\n\nMy only qualm is that they are not open on weekends. But that won't stop me and it shouldn't stop you. Just go there between 11:30am and 3:30pm on a weekday. Take a long lunch. Skip work and go here. Whatever.

It was so impressive that a few weeks later, I just HAD to throw a lasagna party as an excuse to spend $62 per lasagna to try different flavors and traveled all the way to the City to do so...and I NEVER order lasagna when I eat out.  That's how good it was.\n\nFood: Ordered a pan of mushroom, bolognese, and verdure lasagnas.  All were amazing, but there was something extra special about the mushroom.  All had layers and layers of homemade pasta sheets and although they had all those layers, the lasagna was still light and not heavy like you just ate a brick.  I will definitely be back for the mushroom lasagna...so amaze balls.\n\nService: While I didn't pick it up myself, the first thing I was told was how nice the employees were...not just nice, but super nice.\n\nInterior: small and quaint.\n\nMiles traveled to get here were 25, and to the City?

Only open on weekdays Monday-Friday 11:30 am to 4:30 and ***3:30 to 5:00  Pick up/To Go only*** so basically you can't go there at all if you live in the Dogpatch and work during the week. You can call ahead for pickup.\n\nYou can also get a combo with bread, salad, and a soda drink, but it's like $14.50 and not necessarily worth it, and once they forgot the soda so that was disappointing. The atmosphere indoors and outdoors (umbrella table seating) seems pretty Italian (looks and feels like it).  Wish it was open on the weekend, but right now the best thing to do is get take out of the Abruzzio (I've also tried the eggplant and the Bolognese) and take it up to some rooftop with a bottle of red wine. I once bought a container of their homemade red sauce for $5 to sauce up my lasagna. I saw on their website http://www.marcellaslasagneria.com/menu.html that they also cater.\n\nI also tried the Ravioli alla Romana ($12.50) which is handmade and filled with mild cheese and spinach in a light tomato basil sauce and a bit of cream. It was excellent! Sometimes when I've mentioned the Dogpatch to people, they have immediately said \"Marcellas!\"\n\nUpdate: I returned to Marcellas around 2:30pm on a  Thursday afternoon and has a pleasant meal outside. I was in the shade but there was also some sun. I had a single table to myself as did a few other people. It was very relaxed and the person at the table across from me was casually reading a book. Another guy was completely finished but continued sitting there enjoying the sun. Very much Italy paced. Seating outside is limited so it's probably best to come after the lunch hour is over.

After a brief shower, I slipped on my loafers, donned some denim and embarked on a meandering stroll through the DogPatch neighborhood. I was lost deep in the throws of an existential thought cycle, wherein I ask myself how I've come to reside in this city, or any city for that matter, and whether I should retreat away from these urban confines towards a more pastoral, idyllic life I envisioned in my youth. \n\nBOOOMMMMMM! Suddenly I'm standing in front of Marcella's with mixed feelings of curiosity, familiarity, and hunger. The humble decor, and no-frills marketing intrigued me. I walked in the door, exchanged hellos with the owner, received smiles from all the staff, and took a seat out out on the sidewalk under the sun. \n\nA waiter promptly took my order before bringing out a steaming pot of dark roasted espresso and fresh bread to my table. I was in heaven. Sitting on the corner in the sunshine downing shots of delicious espresso while waiting for my homemade lasagna to finish baking.\n\nEating that lasagna was a religious experience. I found god. He was living in Sicily, drinking red wine a little too often, laughing almost constantly, and enjoying the company of a large group of interesting friends. \n\nMarcella's is what restaurants should aspire to be.

The mushroom had the best textures; there were even crisp onion (or maybe they were mushrooms, too) bits, the butternut squash was toothsome (not mushy!).

After trying this (and nothing against them, I imagine this is as good as butternut lasagna is going to get!), I realize that meat just tastes better in lasagna, is more hearty, and the flavors pair better w/ the tomato sauce. Of course, the actual pasta itself in this dish was great.\n\n* Abruzzo lasagna - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marcellas-lasagneria-and-cucina-san-francisco?select=schFBKL3eMqKqoW1fQ-6eA#LAiqOHszzUFt7FK-zg5oHQ\nReally great!

Actually my mother didn't make homemade lasagna. She defrosted Stouffer's Family Style Lasagna with Meat and Sauce, and that's how my lasagna expectations were set. Ultra thick noodles with ruffled edges layered on top of each other with ground beef, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce in between. I liked it so much I made my own version for college potlucks. I only knew how to make lasagna and key lime pie.\n\nThat was my entire cooking repertoire as a Berkeley undergrad. But I digress since chef Massimo Di Sciullo creates his own unique version quite unlike what I've experienced. First, the handmade pasta is extremely thin like tissue paper. Six layers of this pasta are piled on top of each with three cheeses in between - not only mozzarella but also Parmigiano Reggiano and bechamel - and six variations of fillings and toppings in separate trays in the display case (photo: http://bit.ly/ZTa52W). The net result looked less like traditional lasagna and more like a savory baklava with layers upon layers of filo dough.\n\nI naively asked if I could have half-orders of two different kinds thinking I was at Humphry Slocombe negotiating between scoops of Secret Breakfast and Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee for the price of a single cone. In a halting Sophie's Choice-like moment, I finally decided to try a sizable $9.75 piece of the Verdura Lasagna with fresh pesto, diced zucchini and sun-dried tomatoes (photo: http://bit.ly/10yhvd8). It was quite good, different and fresh-tasting even if it was a tad oily from the pesto. I liked the crunch of the zucchini mixed with what I believe were remnants of pine nuts. Delicious comfort food.\n\nIt made me curious what the others tasted like, but I behaved and simply ordered the $4.50 Insalata Fresca as a side. The salad was just a mix of organic greens with a couple of tomato slices on top and tossed in a sweet housemade balsamic dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/16lrYLC). The salad was a wise contrast to the richness of the lasagna. Massimo obviously knows what he's doing since he's had his business for twenty years, although the sparse cafe itself is barely a year old. The limited hours - closed on weekends and only only until 6:30PM otherwise - make it less convenient for anyone outside of Dogpatch, but if you do feel that cough coming on (hack-hack), maybe you can leave work a little early.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...artisan lasagna...who knew?\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars..simple cafe set-up, no big whoop (photo: http://bit.ly/12ijq3W)\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty attentive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...quite a different pasta worth trying if you can make it before it closes", "author": "Ed U."}

If you're having an average day or a spectacular day you might as well go too.\n\nI've tried several of their lasagnas and my favorite is probably the verdura. It has toasted zucchini on top and almost looks reptilian but the pesto-y cheesy goodness inside ties all the layers together. I still need to try their pasta specials which friends have raved about.\n\nToday, the son, unfailingly friendly, read my mind and recommended getting half pistachio/half gianduja gelato. That just made me like them even more.\n\nI have never visited Marcella's and not left happy, full, and actually smiling.

It's casual family owned which is exciting to visit and support.  We started with a caprese salad, as an uncooked dish, ingredients are everything.  I expected a healthy number of beefsteak tomatoes, basil and mozzarella.  The tomatoes were overly soft and tasteless.  The mozzarella was not fresh and did not have any taste.  There were just 4 slices of tomatoes and 2 basil leaves served on a paper plate.  I ordered Bolognese lasagna and my dining companion ordered penne puttanesca but they were out of penne so substituted with spaghetti.  My lasagna was not edible, lacked life, reminded me with frozen section heated a few times.  On to the puttanesca, it was supposed to be a pungently delicious dish except pasta was not made that day.  It had an overpowering taste of anchovies and lacked ingredients specifically olives but we succcessfully found about 6 capers.  On a positive note, the owners son had high integrity and did not charge us.", "author": "Na H."}

He made me up a custom dish of spaghetti with the Abruzzo sauce and it was awesome.

The lasagna was soft, almost mushy. There were thin layers of ricotta cheese, tender pasta and tomato sauce. The butternut squash cubes were on top and felt like an afterthought. The flavor of the sauce overwhelmed the flavor of the butternut squash.\n\nThe owner, an Italian man named Massimo, is extremely chatty (in a nice way).

However, the trays were all different sizes so one tray of salad was much larger than one tray of prosciutto and melon or a tray of vegetables. I believe I asked what size the trays were so I could be clear on how much food I was getting. If at any point they had told me \"hey just looking at this order, it doesn't sound like this will be enough for 125 people.\"  I would have gladly kept the order the same, or upped the quantities. but that isn't what happened. They listed out the portion sizes on the menu, but when it showed up, that wasn't the case. We had to cut a lot of stuff in half to make it go further. Every place is different, so I have to do my best to estimate. \n\nWhen you're sending a representative from your restaurant, if he isn't in a position to handle something like that, someone from your restaurant should be and just because he's not in a position to help, it doesn't give him the right to be rude. I've worked in restaurants for many years. If the customer wasn't satisfied, I'd want to make it right. The owner told me it was my fault and that there was nothing he could do to help me. It's really stressful to feed 125 people and when the caterer blames your for what happened, it's really infuriating.\n\nIn the end, whether it was my fault for not ordering enough or the restaurant's for not providing enough, isn't really the issue. It was how they treated me after. It was an all around unpleasant experience and this isn't a place I'm going to use again.

We've been back several times and the specials were mouthwatering each time. The most recent trip a few weeks ago we had fish meatballs with spaghetti. They never over-sauce the food, and the pasta is perfectly al dente. This is the best lasagna and pasta place in SF.", "author": "Yale Z."}

He even opened up a new container of mozzerella which gets shipped here on Mondays straight from Italy to illustrate its freshness and quality. \n\nThis type of effort is something that is lacking quite obviously with many new restaurants that seems to be popping up here in SF where the owner doesn't work to appease the patrons. It's more the attitude of \"if you don't like something, tough\". \n\nBoth hubs and I stopped by on our lunch break and we each picked up a panini and a lasagna.

I am happy to say that there weren't any burnt noodle edges or any unwanted crunchy textures.  Although, a branch of rosemary did find it's way into my meal.  With that being said, the flavor of rosemary was overpowering and I didn't really taste the homemade marinara or the wild and meaty taste of mushroom.

Since we could today, we wanted to go somewhere special, recommended by friends. The restaurant has indoor and sidewalk seating. It's an unpretentious place- everything is served on paper plates. It's owned and run by a family that fairly shine with love for what they do. The son greeted us, mom was on the register, dad was cooking and everyone was watching over the tables together. We overheard the dad tell another table that they name the restaurant after his daughter. They were all attentive, warm, and generously spirited - very genuine in how they made us feel like old friends. We ended up spending along two hours eating lunch, though I felt like we'd been there for only 30 minutes or so. \n\nWe had Caesar salad, the pork pappardelle special, the sausage lasagna, gelato and a biscotti. Everything was excellent. The lasagna and gianduja gelato were particular great. The lasagna is a generous portion, with paper thin sheets of pasta, just the right amount of homemade sausage with fennel, and the sauce! The sauce had this richness and the sweetness of tomatoes cooked for a long long time with care and attention. It was a beautiful, subtle, nuanced sauce. I've never had lasagna like this before and didn't know the dish could be this interesting and delicate. \n\nAll that and it was pretty inexpensive to boot! Our whole meal, with salad, two entrees, and dessert was only about $40. (Speaking of money, it looks like they take American Express and are on Credibles.) \n\nWith so many places to eat in the city, 9 times out of ten we aren't impressed enough to return. This lasagna is now in our list of very favorite things to have and we can't wait to return.", "author": "M B."}

The plates are dixie paper plates on small wicker holders neighbored by little paper napkins. The soup comes in little plastic containers like the kind you used to use when all your bowls were dirty as a kid, and you needed something to hold your goldfish. They contain food that surprises me every single time with how tasty it is. I do not understand how it still blows me away, despite coming here for nearly a year. \n\nThis is simply good food. Other restaurants take the claim that they are 'simple' and 'good', but these words have lost their meaning through over- and mis-use. This place *lives* those words. \n\nEating here feels like living in some parallel universe where that quaint, sepia-toned idea of antiquated Italian countryside ristorante exists, but it's in San Francisco -- home of smug pretension -- fighting back with such authenticity that you expect to be smacked on the back of your head with a wooden spoon used to stir marinara by your Nonna for letting your food get cold because you've been lost in how rare a place like this is. \n\nI considered not writing a review, because so many others have said what I've said, but better worded. I considered leaving a 1-star review so that people won't discover this place and leave me unable to find a table at lunch -- but quickly dashed that idea because I could never do that to the people running things here (a family, father and mother making the food, and son running the front).

Very pleased with the meal; ordered Chicken Rigatoni paired with Caprese Salad, both of which had great distinguishing flavor as well as a remarkable freshness. The gentleman who assisted (our) table, John Franco, did a phenomenal job touring me and my brother through the menu, recommending the Rigatoni con Pollo which includes chardonnay saut\u00e9 that he made from scratch earlier that day. It turned out a great choice as it watered in my mouth, very \"al dente\" like true Italian pasta should be and amazingly delicious! For dessert we enjoyed a scoop of gelato each which by the great flavor and smooth consistency one can spot it to be the real thing-By far, the best artesian-made gelato I've had, paired with a made-from-scratch biscotti, Y-U-M! John Franco suggested a limoncello to top off the meal which did us a great deal in our tum tums to bring the good food flowing down nicely; a satisfying after feel. Aside from a great authentic Italian meal, I absolutely grew fond of our server John Franco who made the experience from sitting to closing the meal an all around delightful experience for me and my brother. John Franco has a wonderful, witty, all-giving personality which is a complement to the great food. Rarely do me and my brother encounter service derived from the heart like Franco's.

I tried the Abruzzo with spicy sausage and the mushroom - both delicious. The pieces I got had that amazing crust on the sides... as well as on the bottom, perfection.

I found the lassagna mushy and good but not special. Stouffers frozen comes to mind. It was not hot, on a paper plate, and just didn't stir any taste buds beyond satisfying my lunch hunger. My friend had the eggplant lassagna, even more mushy. Salad was good, hard to go wrong with greens and a simple vinaigrette.\nI don't know the food seems uninspiring and expensive for the offering.

Marcella's Lasagneria is a lasagna focused restaurant that serves unique flavored handmade lasagna, something I have never been to before. Walking in with my friend during to-go only hours, the lasagna maker/owner came out to describe the lasagna himself, and his passion and specific descriptions made the experience excellent. Since we could not decide which lasagnas to order, the owner described each lasagna's ingredients, taste, and his own recommendations and opinions. To say the least, his delectable descriptions did not help us decide. We ended up getting three lasagnas to share: verdura, mushroom, and bolognese. Each one was delicious beyond belief; it was obvious that the lasagnas were freshly made by hand. The ingredients were perfectly balanced with melted cheese and creamy sauces that were full of meat and veggies. The only downside of this place is that they are only open for weekday lunch, so as a student, it is difficult to find time and come eat here, but I will make time since I became completely obsessed with this place immediately and cannot wait to come back and try more lasagna!", "author": "Annie C."}

They make six different types! My friends and I tried three kinds, the pesto, Abruzzo, and wild mushroom. All three were awesome and all three of them had their own distinct flavors:\n\nPesto Lasagna - Ummm... pesto-y. When mixed with the cheese it made the lasagna very creamy. Also, a nice strong presence of olive oil. Delicious!\nAbruzzo Lasagna - Spicy Italian sausage lasagna. Marinara sauce was very well done, a bit on the sweet side. The sausage gave it a nice kick. \nWild Mushroom - A bit lighter, mushrooms are not overcooked, nice a soft. They use a red wine sauce in addition to the marinara which adds a slight bit of tartness.\n\nThe pasta is wonderful. Most lasagna is pretty heavy but because they use such thin pasta, it maintains the lasagna texture without all the starchiness of normal lasagna.\n\nThe service was excellent. They moved tables around for us, took out their phones to show us pictures of some of the food there, and were just really friendly overall. He was definitely Italian from Italy... hilarious guy.\n\nCan't wait to go back!\n\nCheers!", "author": "Andrew B."}

I was super excited while at the same time having no clue what could make any lasagna so different from the numerous lasagna I have had throughout my existence! \nThe first ting I noticed was the intense scent of homemade marinara. It was intoxicating. The next thing I noticed was how effortlessly my fork cut through the noodles. It was like they were made of butter. Then the taste.... OMG!

We were hungry and it was the closest restaurant.  What a happy surprise. \n\nA caprese salad and order of lasagna were plenty for two of us. \n\nThe salad: anybody can match the greens,they were fresh and good.  The tomatoes:  I can do better in Sacramento from my backyard plants or the farmer's market, but oh, the cheese.  It is real, fresh, buffalo mozzarella flown in from Puglia.  We don't have anything that matches that flavor. It is mild, but the flavor blooms in your mouth and is just different and lovely.  The salad dressing is mild so it doesn't overwhelm the cheese, that great big ball of cheese. Really, it's plenty for two. \n\nWe shared a huge hunk of the  Abruzzo lasagna. My husband likes heartier food and I feared the \"sausage\" would be big and greasy.  Not so. It is finely ground fresh pork gently spiced with salt and pepper and fennel. The \"sausage\" mixed with sauce and layered with the impossibly thin pasta was delicious.  It wasn't greasy or heavy, just perfect with a salad.  The flavors are subtle and so balanced.  \n\nMas and Gianfranco are friendly and happy to talk about their food.  We loved it and will be finding more excuses to go to SF for lunch. We'll  bring a cooler next time to take food home.\n\nThis family owned and run place is a gem.", "author": "Nancy W."}

Marcella's does not serve you this awfulness, but instead gives you a deliciously light version, with noodles clearly made from fresh they're so soft. The mushroom and the eggplant lasagnas were both amazing. We ordered a side salad, which they split for us onto separate plates, and it was perfect: balanced, not over dressed, with greens that seemed super fresh.\n\nMy friend asked if they had gluten free lasagna. They didn't, but we were told that with 24 hours notice, they could potentially make a whole pan of lasagne that way as long as we committed to buying the whole thing. Seems fair enough, and I think it's pretty cool they're willing to do custom orders like that.\n\nIt's a neighborhood, family-run place, and it's a place that deserves lots of support so they can find the firmest of footing. Great service, great food, and a nice spot to sit outside.", "author": "Anne F."}

I had found this place one Friday when I was craving Italian while on a business trip in the City. Came across Marcella's so I checked out the reviews and the pictures looked so mouth watering I said to buddy of mine who was here from Ireland lets give this place a shot. Let me start by saying the Abruzzo lasagna is a must try. Filled with spicy Sicilian sausage that was freshly made covered in thick layers of pasta and might I say the cheesiest mozzarella ever also the house salad had a very good vinaigrette that complimented the lasagna very will. John Franco was the gentleman that took care of us and made me feel like I was at home. His service alone is what sealed the deal and from here on will be coming in regularly when I am in the area to eat some lasagna.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-10-13", "description": "I went here in a rush and asked what was fastest to prepare -- they said the lasagna and it would be ready in 3 minutes.  I ordered it immediately, and yet 30 minutes later, still nothing arrived.  Two tables who had ordered after me already received their food and finished it.  When I got up to leave, the food finally arrived but I left it there because I didn't have time to eat it anymore.  They gave me a full refund, which I appreciated, and I'm pretty sure that this was a one-time screw up, but it made for a terrible experience.  \n\nIn all the time I had to sit there and watch the other tables eat, I noticed that the food really looks like it's been microwaved.  It's served in a Stouffer's microwaveable tray -- so it's no wonder they claim it can be ready in three minutes.  If you look back in the kitchen, the place does look legit -- they have lots of chefs in the back preparing what seems to be authentic food. I couldn't help but think that it's as if they hired actors in the back to create the illusion of a legit establishment, but really they are just nuking food.  Kind of like my friend who sells \"gourmet artisan cakes\" but really uses Betty Crocker cake mixes and icing.  \n\nThe tables near me seemed to enjoy the food -- I just didn't get a chance to try it because they were so slow. However, based on the presentation and slow service, I don't think I'll go out of my way to go back.\n\nMy advice to them: serve the food on a plate and get it out of that Stouffer's packaging.  And maybe have table-side parmesan cheese that isn't from a Kraft container.\n\nMy advice to you: if, like me, you scout out this place and plan to go out of your way to Dogpatch to stop by for a quick bite, you may want to reconsider.", "author": "Mark D."}

We wanted something light and fast, and we were in the neighborhood, so we stopped in at Marcella's Lasagneria.  We tried to order salads, but Gianfranco would not hear of it.  We must try the lasagna.  No no, we wanted something light. He assured us that their lasagna was not heavy.  We gave it a shot.  WOW!  This was probably the best lasagna I have ever eaten! It was so light and delicate and had amazing robust flavors.  I had the butternut squash, and tasted my colleague's bolognese lasagna. Both were divine!  I don't know how you can fit 6 layers of pasta and filling into a piece of lasagna that is only 1\"  to 1.5\" high, but they sure did it.  The layers were very thin, delicate, and delicious.  I ate the whole piece (and part of a second) plus some bread, and felt perfectly sated... not too full (as I had feared). It was the perfect lunch.

I'm a huge fan of chicken caesars but allergic to the anchovy paste in the dressing. They advertise homemade dressing without the stinky fish. Their salad was delicious. But something happened today that changed all that. As we do a few times a week, I ordered a chicken caesar with extra chicken and my coworker picked it up on her way. The older gentleman at the counter (who I found out to be the owner) not only tried to charge her a considerable amount more than was we are normally charged but was very confrontational about it. By the end of the transaction, I was still charged a $1.50 (ok, I can live with that not a big deal). But when I open the salad box, the extra chicken was absent and I am not paying $14 for mostly lettuce when their reg price chk caesar is $9.75. I walked over hoping this could be resolved easily but was met with disdain by the gentleman who accused me of taking advantage when I explained the situation. He threw his hands up and told me to wait. So I did, patiently. When we came back around I explained that my coworker had just been in here and ordered extra chicken but extra was not in the box. He yelled that he doesn't know what extra means and if I wanted another portion I need to order another salad. I let him know that I come in several times a week and that hadn't been known to me. I've always been charged $3 or so extra and had gotten an extra helping of chicken. He disappeared in the back for a few minutes and then presented me with a few extra bits of chicken. Nothing like what I had gotten in the past. I was tired of arguing and was hungry so I took the salad and left. If you are fortunate enough to encounter the younger gentleman who works here then YAY! He has always been really nice and respectful. This should not have been a big deal. I asked for extra and paid for it. But unfortunately because of the owner I will not return. He was very rude and is in dire need of customer service skills. They have however earned free advertising. It's a shame. I really liked this place.", "author": "Katharine R."}
