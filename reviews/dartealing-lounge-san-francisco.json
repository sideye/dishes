Honestly came off as overwhelmed. \n\nWe noticed we stayed 40 mins past closing after the fact, which we felt bad about, but staff didn't inform us of this at any point. They should have a policy in place for this to make things easier on themselves. \n\nAlso: pricing + split fees are confusing, which wouldn't have been as annoying if staff was able to take the time to walk us through things & tell us how much our meal would actually cost as we were ordering.", "author": "Maya S."}

I had called in and had to make a reservations, but once my mom and I entered we saw that the place was completely empty. I felt that it was over priced for the tea and you have to purchase minimum amounts in order to get certain items. When you share items too there is a fee to do that so you end up paying half of an additional order just to share. We ordered a tea pot and shared a dessert, but the dessert did not seem that fresh. Overall I would say it is a place to maybe have some overpriced tea and get some cool tea party type of photos. I think I may have had a better experience coming with a group and ordering the towers of snacks and desserts and going all out, but of course would have paid so much more for it!", "author": "Sophia K."}

Despite every table being reserved, we were the first party to visit.\n\nThe decor and crockery were a colourful mish mash of different china sets and furniture, not unlike what you'd accumulate if you exclusively collected second hand dining sets. This was more quirky than anything else, but lacked the refinement of the more formal teas elsewhere.\n\nThe tea menu itself felt pricey at around $35 per person (give or take) for your choice of one tea, a couple of savoury dishes, some finger sandwiches, a scone with cream and some small pastries. Yes, it's cheaper than going to one of the high teas in London but at those, they generally bring more food than you can possibly eat and you have the option of multiple teas. Plus, there's something to be said for the ambience of a 5* hotel versus that of a ground floor restaurant in SoMa...\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend going once, but maybe not twice.", "author": "Sunil S."}

Having English-style high tea seems like such an anomaly in SoMa and yet, here it is, a proper tea room in hipster central. Spit-spot. I had to convince Jamie W. that this would be an experience to treasure since we've been on a tea binge of late. Considering this was obviously not once a Victorian-era parlor, the owners have done a fine job furnishing what was obviously just a plain room with hardwood floors into something where you could picture Vanessa Redgrave sitting with Emma Thompson in 1910 London (photo: http://bit.ly/2rEXfXf).\n\nBig hats and gloves would be involved, you know. Cute name by the by. A little too cute. I get the Darjeeling tea connection. Would you be impressed if I told you I've been to Darjeeling? Yeah, I didn't think so. We were there for tea and not finger sandwiches, scones, or crumpets. Those edibles looked elegantly good in fancy triple tier servers, but we just wanted tea. We did notice that the menu stated a $14 per person dining minimum, but the kindly server luckily didn't hold us to it since it wasn't fully packed on a late Sunday afternoon (photo: http://bit.ly/2rFbOtX).\n\nWe ordered an $8 pot of a hearty fruit herbal tea called Painted Ladies since it offered an infusion of berries and sweet apples (photo: http://bit.ly/2pXPPlh). The tea set definitely came from Grandma's house or at least a nice consignment store selling Victorian-era china. It was a tasteful hodgepodge of porcelain (photo: http://bit.ly/2q5quSC). The space looks like it accommodates large parties or just couples and at least one laptopper who must have thought he landed in one weird Starbucks. Their afternoon teas range from $33 to $48, so when Vanessa and Emma are in town, I know where we'll go.\n\nTEA - 4 stars...lovely loose leaf tea in a \"Howard's End\"-type setting except it's a refurbished SoMa space\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...spit-spot\nSERVICE - 4 stars...very nice to us, the last of the big spenders\nTOTAL - 4 stars...if you are looking for a bit of Victorian London in SoMa, then blimey, you're in luck", "author": "Ed U."}

The tea was great but we weren't super impressed by the petit fours, and the person came by only occasionally.

The tea itself was expensive, but quite good: ordered Parisian Earl grey.\n\nThe place is mostly selling ambiance, which has potential but needs a lot of work. When I first walked in, the air smelled extremely stake, but either I got used to it quickly or the staff noticed too and opened a window. Place is decorated in French Country style, but there is significant dust, plastic tabs of some sort stuck to the ceiling where something used to hang, and the curtains and chandelier chain covers were never ironed to remove the fold creases. The walls are scratched where chairs hit them, and some of the windows are broken and taped, and graffitid. The combination of all this makes the place feel a little dirty, not cozy.\n\nFinally, the service wasn't great. I think the one waitress was overworked and kind if tired. She wasn't rude at all, just mostly indifferent. It took a little over 10 minutes between ordering and getting my tea, but I expect most customers come here to relax and take their time.\n\nHonestly, I think the place deserves only 3 stars, but I  want an independent small business like this to do well, and I think they could improve a lot with a few changes.", "author": "Christopher N."}

Not a huge deal but just the first time I ever had to do that (I've been to a couple of other tea rooms).  \nThe teas came out first and we really liked the Wolves of Winterfell, rooibos with hints of toffee and caramel.  Kings Landing was ok, it wasn't too strong in the mango flavor.  \nThe food came out in a two tiered tray - the sweets were on top and savories on the bottom.  There were two different scones and both were pretty good.  The sandwiches were good, nothing outstanding but I did like the variety in selection choices.  Tomato spinach quiche and sausage rolls were nice and we were already getting full and warm due to the many cups of tea we were having.\nThe place wasn't entirely full that afternoon and we noticed there was only 1 server - hard to get her attention though.\nThe place has a very cutesy feel to it and agree with other yelpers that you can't tell from the outside.  \nIt was still a good experience but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here next time.

I'm a big fan of black tea that's bold and you can add milk to. \n\nI will note I called and left at least three messages to make a reservation and got no call back.

The sweets, scone, crumpet, various random desserts were NOT freshly baked. The mini eclairs were straight from Costco and were frozen, macaroons also from Costco.  The 'sweet cream' was not sweet but tasted like it was cut with cream cheese.  \nThe sandwiches were flavorful but they were just on white bread with the crusts cut off, nothing that warranted the $7 per sandwich price. Same with the sweets, don't charge $52 for a sweets assortment that isn't made in house.\n\nThe tea was an herbal tea and was weak, it never really steeped well or change color, it also had no flavor. I'm not sure they understand how tea really works.\n\nThe decor is sloppy. Upon arrival it has a vibe like it used to be a sushi bar but then they added all this kitschy 'tea room' stuff so now it's a tea room.

We were all pretty full so we ordered 4 types of sandwiches (cut into quarter slices, a cinnamon bread, matcha cheesecake, and 3 pots of tea.  The sandwiches were all light and good.  My favorite was the blue cheese one....if you love blue cheese, I highly recommend it!  However, the salmon sandwich could have used a little bit more salmon.  All three teas we had were delicious (Sorry, I can't remember the names).  We started with a green tea with tropical notes, continued with a green tea with floral notes, and then ended with a black tea with chocolate flavors.  Though not entirely intentional, the way we paired our teas and sandwiches worked out nicely!\n\nOne thing to note is that the area isn't really the nicest area - Dartealing is located under a freeway overpass and as soon as my Uber pulled up, there were 5 cop cars surrounding the building...", "author": "Lisa Marie R."}

They were all good - jasmine is definitely more of the \"you can find anywhere\" so I'd recommend going for more exciting teas.  \n\nThe pricing of the tastings were a bit high - food bites included.  It starts at $27.  I would stick with the basic tea tasting of sandwiches if I were you.  The day I was there, they didn't have some items from the Knightsbridge High Tea, but neglected to tell the table so that was a little disappointing.  And even without the English sausage roll, I was charged for the full price.  If I knew, I would have ordered something else.  The sandwiches were on the dry side without enough filling.

It was pretty busy, but we were lucky enough to have a table open up shortly after we got there. I'd definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand, especially if you have a group larger than 2 people.\n\nDartealing is a pretty cute, cozy spot located kind of randomly in SOMA, not really around anything at all. The only other tea lounge I've been to in SF is Samovar and compared to that one, which was more trendy, Dartealing has more of that quintessential afternoon tea vibe with its floral, patterned tea pots and cups.\n\nThey have a LOT of unique teas to choose from, full tea services and food a la carte. Honestly though, the tea wasn't particularly special. Maybe my friend and I just didn't pick the right ones. We asked for recommendations and went with two of them, but weren't very impressed.\n\nWe ordered the BLOOMSBURY FULL TEA for 2 ($52), which included 2 pots of tea, 4 tea sandwiches, green salad, tea bread, scones, macarons and shortbread cookies.\n\nFor our tea, we got:\n     * DEBUTANTE BALL [subtle floral notes of jasmine, rose, creamy undertones, smooth finish] - I love floral teas so I went with this one for the jasmine and rose, but I guess the description wasn't kidding when it said \"subtle\" because I couldn't taste anything floral at all. It really just tasted like plain green tea to me, and a really light green tea if anything.\n     * LAST MANGO IN PARIS [special blend of red rooibos with ripe, juicy mango] - My friend opted for a fruity tea. The mango was definitely noticeable, but I wasn't a huge fan.\n\nFor our sandwiches, we got:\n     * SMOKED SALMON MOUSSE & DILL - We each ordered the smoked salmon because we both lovee smoked salmon. We didn't realize it was going to be mostly mousse though, so we were unfortunately pretty disappointed. Some of the sandwiches had a tiny bit of smoked salmon but otherwise it was mostly a creamy, mayo-like paste.\n     * TURKEY & PESTO CREAM - Pretty much what you would expect: slices of turkey with pesto.\n     * DARTEALING CURRIED CHICKEN - Kind of like the salmon in the sense that it was more of a paste/spread rather than actual chicken. Maybe more like very, very shredded chicken. Flavor is pretty good though so I'd recommend it if you like savory food\n\nI really enjoyed all of the sweets too. The tea bread was some sort of yummy banana bread. The scones had a nice crispness on the outside and soft, fluffiness on the inside. The macarons were perfectly chewy!\n\nMy general impression though is that afternoon tea is really more about the atmosphere and the hours you spend chatting with your friends and less about the tea service itself, despite it being a tea lounge. I've been to Samovar in SF and Tea Time in Palo Alto and felt the same at both places as well. Not really complaining though. I still love taking time for afternoon tea, but $26 each is pretty pricey for some light tea and food, so I'd recommend just ordering a pot of tea and something separate to eat rather than a full tea service.", "author": "Jessie L."}

Also my black tea with tones of bourbon and vanilla was fantastic.  A wonderful, wonderful pot of tea!  \n\nBUT\nWe were the only 3 people in the place for two and a half hours, and the wait service was STILL sub-par.  She didn't clear our plates.  She didn't check back at all - not even to see if we needed refills or if the tea had gotten too cold or too strong.  We had to call out to her.  She was too even unmotivated to talk to the person in the kitchen - even though I was asking her direct questions about the food that the waitress couldn't answer.  And she sat us at a very small table for 3, with every other table open in the entire restaurant.  It really was a nice table, but there was not enough room for our food and tea.  Really, it annoyed me because we could have sat at a four-top and been more comfortable but that wasn't given as an option.\n\nThe food was fine, but nothing to write home about.  The savory scone was a bit too peppery, the peanut butter scone was very nice but small, and the crumpets were too hard to cut through.  \n\nAnd the price for what we got was nuts - though I admit they did give us each our own pot of tea, whereas I'm used to sharing with my friends at other tea places.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed and won't return.

The tea did not disappoint! My friend and I both opted for the Covent Garden Tea service for 2 (slightly cheaper than when ordering separately) which included mainly savory items (a mini spanikopita (sp?), cucumber cup filled with tuna, and your choice of 2 types of sandwiches, cut into quarters) as well as a scone, a mini cake, a cookie, and a petit four. The scone was still warm, and served with a dish of clotted cream and a little jar of jam, yum! \n\nBetween us, we ordered the turkey and pesto, fish and chips, curried chicken, and tuna sandwiches. The selection was pretty diverse, and they all sounded good so it was hard to pick! I thought they were all tasty, although be fore-warned that the turkey pesto sandwich goes a little heavy on the mayo. The fish and chips has literal potato chips on a sandwich with some breaded fish, very unique!\n\nFor my tea, I ordered Her Majesty's Secret Service, which had a lovely creamy texture and a slightly buttery flavor. It was actually a good amount of food, and I was definitely too full to eat any dinner after, so come hungry! It was relatively quiet when we came on a Sat afternoon, but that might have been due to the July 4th holiday, so it might still be a good idea to grab a rez. \n\nI'd definitely come back, a great spot for catching up with friends!

I personally thought the area was a little bit sketchy, but the streets are busy so no worries.\n\nOn the outside, the little shop is a bit plain and nondescript so if you weren't looking for it, you might walk past it. Inside is a completely different story. The little tea shop is decorated in Victorian decor. There are gorgeous tea pots and cups, all of which were different! So it was fun to look around and study the different designs.\n\nThey have so many options on their menu! My friend and I ended up choosing the Bloomsbury Tea Service. Each set comes with eight mini sandwiches (you get to pick two flavors), a scone, a shortbread cookie, a slice of tea cake, a salad, a macaron, and a entire pot of tea. So between the two of us, there's a ton to eat.\n\nWe each got a pot of tea. We ordered the Earl de Versailles which has hints of lavender. I thought it was the perfect combination of flavor. The other pot is Currant's the New Black which contains black currants and other berries. This was just as good, especially if you're a fan of fruity infused teas.\n\nHoney lavender cream tea sandwich - I was a little disappointed with this one since it seemed so simple and not very lavender-y. There was lavender with cream and a touch of honey on bread. Some bites had lavender and others didn't.\n\nBerry Cream tea sandwich - This was similar to honey lavender cream, but there was so much more flavor. The berries were jam like and packed with flavor.\n\nFish and Chips tea sandwich - We thought this was an interesting combination for tea, but oh my god, it was soo good. It was savory, slightly crunchy, and a perfect way to balance out the sweets.\n\nDartealing Curried Chicken - while the curry flavor is there, I was slightly disappointed with this sandwich. There was something about it that I didn't like as much as the other sandwiches.\n\nThe scones were delicious but really dense. I think this should be saved for last. After eating this scone, I was completely full.\n\nThe macaron was disappointing. I actually couldn't quite tell what flavor it was and it was sweet without being special. I expect a lot more from macaron.\n\nThe lavender shortbread cookie was so amazing. It had a hint of lavender in every buttery bite.\n\nThe poppyseed tea cake has the texture of pound cake. I thought it was really good. Slightly sweet and perfect with tea.\n\nAfter everything, I didn't even get to the salad, but it looked really fresh.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a place for a girl's day out, or a little get together.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-13", "description": "Afternoon Tea is a lovely way to while away the hours of the late afternoon, breathing deeply and relaxing over a delicious cuppa, as well as nibbling at some tasty accompaniments!  Dartealing Tea Lounge does a lovely job of helping you achieve this calm and cozy bit of rest in the middle of your day!\n\nOnce you enter from the busy streets of SoMa, your mood is immediately transformed by your cozy, quaint, and traditional English surroundings.  There are tasteful decorations of fine china, vintage lamps, upholstered furniture, and a variety of low tables between, giving the impression that you've entered someone's living room or parlour.\n\nYou'll be seated according to the size of your party, of course, but especially when they aren't busy, they'll generally be happy to accommodate you at any table/sitting area you request.  \n\nThis is not a formal tea service, so don't go expecting that:  Your utensils will be in a basket or cutlery tin on your table for you to help yourself to, your teacups and plates will be mismatched, and may not be fine bone china.  And when your pot of tea arrives, you will be told how much longer to let it steep before you pour it yourself.  This casualness is comforting and expected at this price range...but if you're used to higher end tea service, where your tea is poured for you, etc., this may be an adjustment.\n\nYou'll be given a choice of tea sandwiches to go with the specific tea service you ordered.  My personal favorite, by far, is the Dartealing Curried Chicken!  This is their take on the uber-traditional British favorite \"Coronation Chicken Salad\".  For those not familiar with this concept, it's basically a chicken salad with curry powder (not \"hot\" spicy, just flavorful) and mango chutney with the addition of plumped raisins.  \n\nBe aware that at Dartealing, most of their tea sandwich fillings are a paste of the ingredients, as though all the items were put in a food processor and pulsed a few times (which is, I'm guessing, how they're made).  So while they are tasty, it can give the impression of being a spread on bread, with a gooier consistency than most of the tea sandwiches I'm used to being served at other tea salons.  \n\nAlso, the teas themselves are often brewed too weak for my preference, because they don't put enough tea leaves into the pots for my taste.  Maybe they've never had any complaints, or maybe this is a cost-cutting measure?\n\nThe miniature desserts are a-ok, nothing to write home about...but this is generally my feeling on mini desserts as part of afternoon tea.  For me, there's so much else that's sweet, to finish with desserts is gilding the lily!  That is a personal preference, though, and not a knock on Dartealing.\n\nThe big highlight of Dartealing's tea service?!  THE SCONES!!!! They are light, flaky, flavorful, and always very fresh!  Served with fruit preserves and \"royal cream\" (not quite the thick clotted or devon cream I'm used to), they are to die for!!!  The scones come in different flavors every time I go, and I assume they rotate regularly.  Be aware that if you want lemon curd (from a jar, not fresh) to go with your scone, they will charge you extra.\n\nThis tea lounge is WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE, which is such a relief and so nice!  Best of all, if you use a mobility scooter but don't want to take it to your table, the employees will let you park it in the front foyer of the restaurant without any hesitation!  They will also run out to help you with the front door if they see you about to enter or exit!!\n\nBe aware that while they close at 6 pm, last seating is at 4:30 pm, and by 5:30 pm they might be starting to turn off some lights around the back of the store.  If you are aiming for 4:30 pm but are running 5-10 minutes late, you can call them and ask them to put in your order in advance, which they have been generous enough to do for me on several occasions in the past.  It is best, though, to try to arrive on-time, though, as tea service is usually made to order and isn't something that one can rush through...this is especially true for larger parties!\n\nDartealing also has some china pieces for sale in the front of the store, a fact I've taken advantage of in the past (hello, hot pink tea cups!!!).  And they also sell scones to-go...they aren't cheap, but they're delicious, and a great fresh baked good to bring with you to a bridal or baby shower!\n\nDartealing remains one of my favorite afternoon relaxation haunts in San Francisco, and I heartily recommend it to anyone looking to enjoy a wonderful, quaint, British tradition!!!", "author": "Amy L."}

( I would later find out this inquiry would deem me and my entire party \"Intimidating\" - straight from the horse's mouth, Pauline)\n\nImmediately after,the service changed. All employees huddled in the back and all tables left unattended for 10 mins. Once dispersed, We noticed Kirsten, not our server, giving us looks, staring, awkwardly dead giveaway that the hens had been cackling about our group. She's hard to miss since she's dressed as if she rolled out of bed in her Jammie Jams (baggy Tshirt.) We shrugged her off until she slammed both the desserts and the cream on our table, hard enough to rattle the silverware.\n\nAutogratuity, a whopping 20%- labeled as a \"service charge\" but our server clarified its gratuity. We were not advise before arriving or after arriving there was any additional charge? The service charge needs to be stated before the meal, and if a gratuity, we are allowed to tip based on our service. This was not 20% service. Talking behind the back of your patrons, leaving tables unattended for long periods of time, charging us for service of 9 and serving 8, rude treatment and stares from staff. \n\nIF based on the service (my server),  and overall I would have rated 3 stars. I wouldn't have even left a review, not worth my time. I figured a mental note not to return would suffice. Then Pauline , yelled aggressively across the room waiving her pointer finger in the air Sha NAY NAY style \"WHO IS SHARON I NEED TO TALK TO HER\" (Like a child on a schoolyard instigating for someone for taking their swing) I compare this to a child because the entire encounter lacked common sense, maturity, and professionalism. This now made Dartealing review worthy. Once she reached the table, she slammed the receipt down and started ranting about how our group was making her servers feel intimidated, and how we were the ones at fault and how oh, \"that's why she owns a tea shop and I don't.\" How is this relevant, or constructive ? All her rants and attempts to intimidate me failed. I gave her honest valid feedback of the issues I've stated in this review and more. All which she could not deny. She accused me of predetermining my experience , and I asked how she came to that decision ,nothing but crickets..  Her employees are a reflection of her, now I understand the service.\n\nAnyways Congrats Pauline you made this place a must review.You will probably reply my review like how you bickered with me in front of your other guests. Embarrassing much? We see the way you reply other negative reviews, and wish we had taken those reviews more seriously. Boo I ain't the one to bully. Maybe you should just stay in the kitchen.\n\nI still enjoyed my birthday because I have the best friends in the world, no thanks to Dartealin", "author": "Sharon N."}

Smoked Salmon Mousse & Dill - yummy but kinda bummed that they don't have a sandwich option with actual salmon vs. salmon mousse\n2. Dartealing Curried Chicken - didn't like this. expected the spice to be more \"asian curry\" taste versus \"indian curry\"\n3. Ham and Horseradish Cheddar - A OK\n4. Turkey and Pesto Cream - Good but nothing amazing\n5. Brie, Pepper Jelly, Green Apple - Kinda weird tasting. Not a fan.\n\nScones - AMAZING. I loved them. Crumbly, buttery, and not too dense. Wouldn't mind going back to this place just to have the scones again.\n\nTea cookies- Good, kind of reminds me of the costco butter cookies that come out during Xmas\n\nPetit fours - The usual, overly sweet, and nothing out of the ordinary\n\nToffee pudding - First time trying it. Not my cup of tea because I don't really like caramel and toffee kind of just tastes like a sweeter version of caramel to me. Was surprised that the pudding actually comes out warm.\n\nService was EXTREMELY SLOW the day we were there. They were busy and I understand there's only ONE server so she can only go so fast but I don't get why they just don't hire more workers...It's not rocket science.

It definitely has the feel of an authentic tea service, and has a pretty good selection of food and teas to choose from. I highly recommend making a reservation as far in advance as possible because it's a pretty popular place and slots fill up pretty quickly.\n\nI came with a group of four, and we decided to get two different tea services which each served two people. I selected the Covent Garden Tea, which came with cucumber cups, two sandwiches per person, scones, petit fours, the cake of the day, and shortbread cookies. For the sandwiches I tried the smoked salmon mousse and dill and the turkey cranberry which I believe was a seasonal special. For my tea I got the snickerdoodle, which really lived up to its name! All of the treats were delicious, and surprisingly more filling than I thought they would be since I ended up having leftovers to take home.\n\nI will say the service can be a little iffy. Our waitress let us know at around 2:25 that the next reservation for our table was at 2:30, which didn't give us much time to prepare to finish up, so we felt really rushed towards the end. Since afternoon tea is something that's meant to be relaxing and enjoyable, It would have been nice to have an earlier warning. We were pretty turned off by this, but luckily the rest of the service had been good enough for me to let it slide. I definitely recommend Dartealing if you're searching for a nice afternoon tea!", "author": "Jaymie S."}

Fees for sharing (not plating separately, just both eating off the same tray), minimum price per person, fees for splitting tabs. The food and tea were both good but just did not justify the price. The decor was a little fussy but cute, although a little at odds with the waitress dressed in athleisure wear (also not what I'm expecting at $20-$40pp restaurant).\n\nIf you can stomach the price I could see this being a fun place to bring a kid, especially if you did a full tea service.

My friend and I were strolling through SOMA on our way to another restaurant when we walked by Dartealing and were lucky enough to get seated without a reservation! With that said, I would definitely recommend making a reservation because it was pretty busy.\n\nDartealing offers several different tea services, some including salads or crumpets and some without. We opted for the Covent Garden Tea ($56 for 2 people) which was a mix of small sandwiches and petit fours and of course - scones (a MUST have for afternoon tea). I really liked that we were able to pick two sandwiches were person so we were able to try four different sandwiches of our choice! They offer 20 different sandwiches with a variety of flavors like seafood, meat, vegetarian or sweet. So depending on what you're craving that day, you can pick your flavor! The sandwiches tasted fresh and the scones were hot when served. I did notice that we were not served jam with our scones but we did get clotted cream.\n\nThere was a large tea selection as well, I picked the Earl de Versailles which was a mix of earl grey and lavender. Absolute fragrant heaven! I love that they have several earl grey options here for earl grey lovers like me.\n\nService was okay. There was only one server and she was busy with a full house but she was friendly. Definitely plan on spending some time here since the service is on the slower side.

We made reservations on a Saturday right when it opened.  The lounge stated that we would only have 20 minutes prior to opening to setup.  We arrived 30 minutes prior to opening because we wanted to maximize the time we had to setup.  We noticed that someone was inside and knocked hoping to get a few extra minutes, but we were completely ignored until another worker arrived right at 20 minutes prior to opening.  Despite being promised 20 minutes to setup we had less than 15 minutes to do so.  While setting up the owner rudely stated that 2 of my tiny girlfriends should not be standing on a bench because it was the 1700s or something like that.  (Um, side note, the bench is big enough to fit 4-5 full grown adults... so 2 of my girlfriends would no way break this bench.)  The owner pretty much complained about every decoration we had or where it was placed.  I would understand the owner's complaints if we had not informed the owner prior to the event, but we cleared it with her.  Talk about customer service...\n\nOn to the actual bridal shower... we made reservations for 25 people, but Dartealing only setup for 22 people.  (Why even make a reservation when the setup is not correct?!)  The tea service didn't being until 45 minutes AFTER our reservation time.  Keep in mind, the max reservation time at Dartealing is 2 hours.  Once most of the party had a round of of tea, the food came out (this was probably close to an hour + into the reservation).  The sandwiches were decent (i.e. hit-or-miss) - I enjoyed the curried chicken & chutney and the brie, pepper jelly & apple.  The teas were okay - none were really memorable with the exception of the cabana boy.  There was a fruity tea that was too strong and fragrant and the earl grey was quite disappointing.  The dessert selection was varied enough for everyone to enjoy something of her choosing.  The presentation of the food and teas was typical of a high tea lounge.  Honestly nothing special.  Kinda expensive all things considered.\n\nThis space is tiny.  This place feels so cluttered to the point it looks unorganized and dirty.  There were some cobwebs by the window area...  When cleaning up, the owner again angrily mentioned that we shouldn't be standing on the bench...\n\nThe workers didn't seem to like what they were doing (i.e. no smiles) and at minimum was decent at times.  The customer service was below average.  Unless I'm proven otherwise, I will not be recommending this place to friends nor returning (so I guess it'll be difficult to be proven otherwise... whatevs).  Just disappointing.  The bride-to-be enjoyed it and, despite the mediocrity of this place, it justifies the one-star.\n\nI'm not from SF, but I'm sure there are better places to spend your time and money for high tea.", "author": "Sola L."}

It's so overly Victorian and quintessential afternoon tea. It's fantastic. You have the floral stuff, the prints, the tea cozies, everything you could possibly imagine in your typical tea setting. We saw a minimum charge for each person and got confused so we ended up each getting an entire pot of tea which was WAY too much for two people lol. The tea was fairly good though - I had the Jasmine and Jade and the SO had the Rice-Too-Crispy which was also quite good. We also split the scones of the day which were some lemon flavored scones.\n\nOverall, the tea was quite delicious -- I actually really enjoyed the rice tea quite a bit. Scones were also pretty delicious. \n\nThis is an awesome place to just sit around and chat while enjoying some afternoon tea service. They have a couple more fancy, fuller sets of afternoon teas as well. Service is super friendly here, and it's a relatively quiet and peaceful place to spend the afternoon.

Came here with my boyfriend around 1130 on a Saturday morning without a reservation and luckily they were able to squeeze us in despite having a couple larger parties already there. The decor here is adorable yet typical of a tea room, but the tea cups and saucers are all mismatched and add a little quirkiness to the vintage ambiance which I loved. \n\nWe decided on the covent garden tea service which included cucumber cups, little tartlets, 8 tea sandwiches (choose 4 different ones), petit fours, shortbread cookies, and two scones. I usually come to tea rooms for the atmosphere and I don't usually have too high of expectations for the food, but I would go back here just for the scones alone. One was a lemon and lavender I believe and the other was an Oreo scone. Both were still warm and soft on the inside while still having that crisp outside that I've come to love about a scone. Now I'm no scone expert but you just have to trust me and try them! The tea sandwiches were pretty good as well, and I would recommend the turkey pesto and the fish and chips! Stay away from the salmon mousse, this was the only part of my brunch I was thoroughly disappointed with. Sadly we got pretty full off the scones and the sandwiches (surprisingly)  so I only nibbled at the desserts, but the bites I did have were awesome.

I came twice in two weekends because I enjoyed my first experience so much that I brought my mom the second time to relive the experience with her again :)\n\nAbout a 10-15 minute walk from Downtown & MUNI/BART, area is not sketchy (as its in the SOMA - I mean, you might see a bum sleeping on your way here but eh), and if you park on a non-game day, it should be pretty easy to find.\n\nLiterally looks like a British grandma's living room (in a cute and quaint way!). Perfect environment for high tea. A mixture of larger and smaller tables. They don't get too crowded, but it's safer to make reservations. I was able to walk in on a Sunday around 12:30.\n\nService is great here! They're really attentive and helpful if you have any questions. Someone's always around to help.. sometimes at other places, I feel like the workers disappear or are just kind of idle.. when they refill your tea, they even add some tea leaves (not JUST hot water) so that your tea stays flavorful. Big plus!\n\nI was here with my mom for about 2-3 hours and they refilled our tea 2-3 times. Didn't feel rushed at all.\n\nFOOD & TEA:\nI recommend getting the rare teas (just fork up the extra $3!!) because they are really quite special.. I had some of the standard teas and they just taste.. standard.\nMy favorite I think is the Breakfast Candy (almond & caramel undertones). The Jasmine Mist (muscat!) was really beautiful as well.\n\nOverall the food is really good as well. In a nutshell: sandwiches are great, scones are just OK, and desserts are decent - (I actually like the shortbread cookies the most vs the macarons, cakes, and tarts)\nSandwiches are moist and super flavorful. I had a variety of 'flavors' and I honestly really loved them all!  My favorites were curry chicken and brie + green apple, though I think it is really about preference.\n\nThe timing for food is pretty good, tea comes in a timely manner a bit after you order, sandwiches maybe about 15 minutes after your tea -- and then they time dessert based on when you seem full from the sandwiches.\n\nLOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Already recommended to a coworker and will probably continue to sing their praise for a while. And their prices aren't bad either, about $20-25 per person which is on par or even cheaper than other places.\n\nThe only minor point is that it gets warm in here since the place is relatively small and the kitchen is near the back - but they do try to keep it cool by opening the doors and having fans. Maybe the caffeine from drinking all the tea too :P", "author": "Emily C."}

The decor is very whimsical/boho and very from the menus to the tea pots were cute cute cute. The servers are extremely nice and help create a laid back atmosphere where you can just sit back, sip tea, and relax with friends. \n\nI found the menu and pricing slightly confusing. $8 for a pot of tea but there is an extra per person fee for splitting food and tea, and a $14 min. per person. The preselected high tea options seemed pretty expensive at $27 and $32 per person, so my friends and I opted to share the Petit Sweets Melange and Heritage Scones. The scones were warm and delicious, we all agreed the lavender flavored scones were our favorite. The Petit Sweets allows you to choose from an assortment of cakes, macarons, and pastries- they are definitely very petit desserts but its a good option if you want to sample a bit of everything.

And there was a huge wait to get sandwiches and then another to get sweets.\n\nPlus the food was not good.\n\nAs the sandwiches went, the chicken curry and the brie and apple were fine. The ham and horseradish sandwich was passable. We left behind an apple caramel sandwich (a combination that sounded good at the time!), and also wondered what the strange white stuff was that came with it. The most egregious sin of all was the tuna nicoise. My friend took one bite of hers and was repulsed. These were not finished by anyone. They were too fishy.\n\nThen there were the sweets. The espresso cookie was bland, the jelly-filled bar cold. The scone smelled and tasted slightly of hummus (odd), and while warm at least, was very bland. The brownie went unfinished. I have never been to a tea place where so much food was left untouched and not because we weren't hungry.\n\nBiggest plus: I like that the menu fronts appeared to be hand-decorated. And yeah, that's the highest compliment I can pay Darjealing Lounge.\n\nThe back of restaurant was strange with stairs leading to other businesses.\n\nThere is a dearth of good tea places in the South Bay, so it was doubly depressing to finally get to go to tea in San Francisco and have such a terrible experience.\n\nI would consider two stars but $31 per person is downright robbery for our food.

We asked her for some tea recommendations and felt a little overwhelmed with the tea selections. There are just so many to choose from!\n\nWe ended up ordering all different types of tea to try everything out. We got the chai black tea, a caramel tea, memoirs of Provence, and a green tea. They all tasted really bland to me. Even at the end when it seeped and got really dark, the flavors weren't very strong for any of them. I've had high tea before, and the tea definitely had stronger flavors than these. I'd have to say my least favorite tea was the memoirs of Provence, which smelled like cough syrup to all of us.

We visited on a Sunday that happened to be a Sunday where the Blue Angels were in town, which we think might have had something to do with the fact that we basically had the whole place to ourselves for a solid 3 hours! The service was exceptional, as you can imagine being the only customers on a Sunday for that long! We ordered the tea service for 2.

Following the seating, we admired the beautiful mismatched teacups and cute menus, gawked at the large selection of teas with witty names, and peeked at what the other parties were having. The place is set up with a few small tables, a few large tables, and some comfy-looking couches. We were at a table near the front, and found everything clean and cozy.\n\nService was a bit slow, but man was it worth it. We ordered the Covent Garden Tea for two, and had the Butler's Secret Stash and Debutante Ball. The former is a creamy, toffee-flavored black tea that is amazing with milk, and the second is a lighter green tea with a delicate rose fragrance. For sandwiches, we had the curried apple and egg (AMAZING, I was hesitant about curry+apple+egg, but I was so glad we got it), dill cucumber (I don't like dill usually, but this was pretty great), lavender honey (probably my favorite), and berry cream (very good, but probably the most lackluster of the bunch).\n\nThe crumpets may have been my favorite part- crunchy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. They bring you butter and jam, which was great on top of them. There were also lemon poppy seed cakes, two macarons, and two shortbread lavender cookies. I'm not a fan of shortbread so I didn't eat it, but apparently they were amazing.\n\nOverall, I would definitely go here again. It's not so pricy for high tea compared to some other places, and everyone is so friendly and happy to suggest teas to try.

On one hand, the food was really quite good and a great value but on the other hand, the service was extremely lacking (borderline rude) and the interior is very gimmicky. \n\nSERVICE: As I mentioned before, the service was extremely lacking. When my party arrived for our reservation, we were flat out ignored for around 15-20 minutes. What was puzzling was that the restaurant was pretty empty at the time so it seemed weird that we were ignored (we could see the servers just hanging out at the back;) Then when they finally came over to greet us (after noticing that I was looking at them for awhile) they said that they still had to get the table ready and went back to rearrange tables etc. If we have our reservation at a certain time, it would seem logical that they would have the table semi ready. Moreover, besides taking our order and bringing out our dishes we were pretty much ignored. We had to flag down our server every time we wanted our tea refilled etc. Looking at the other reviews, I see that service seems to be a continuous problem at this establishment and so hopefully management can improve in this area because it is really holding the restaurant back. \n\nFOOD, TEA, & VALUE: The food and tea here was actually really really good for the price. The Afternoon Tea included about 6 sandwiches per person, salad, a scone, two tea cakes, a short bread cookie, and a pot of tea for around $24. I had the Bourbon Vanilla tea and it was VERY good. It smelled and tasted like vanilla. I felt like there was more food than lovejoy for a cheaper price. Also, since we could choose 3 different type of sandwiches, there are more variety  than lovejoy. In general, the sandwiches were more saucy than at other tea places which help the sandwiches stay moist and not dry. \n\nCurry Chicken: I thought this was really great and saucy. The chicken was shredded so it had the texture of a chicken salad and the curry was perfect. \n\nTurkey Pesto: REALLY good. The pesto had a really strong pine nut flavor which I like (some people might not like it as much.) Also I think there was mayo and sun dried tomatoes which made it seem really unique compared to other turkey pesto sandwiches at high tea places. \n\nFish and chips: Great fish flavor and perfect crunchiness. \n\nScone: AMAZINGLY soft. I really really liked the scone from here but it didn't seem to come with all of the fixings (lemon curd, jam, etc.) It was extremely well done, however. \n\nATMOSPHERE: I think this place is a bit too dim and gimmicky for my liking. There were clothe streamers hanging from the ceilings but part of them had fallen down. You sit on armchairs and drink tea from  VERY mismatched sets which I was not crazy about. It didn't feel as open, airy, and inviting as other places.\n\nAll in all, the food and value make this place a hot contender for best tea place in the city but its service is really holding it back. Also the decor could also use some improvement.", "author": "Jocelyn K."}

They have a nice selection of teas. I was really happy with my selection, which was called \"Song of the Dragonwell\". It had a lovely jade green color and a mellow chesnut flavor, just as promised. In fact, many of the names and descriptions of the varous blends of tea were delightful to read and to contemplate. There were several I would want to try just based on the written word.\n\nThe tea sandwiches and most of the assorted sweets were just fine. I especially liked the tiny creampuffs filled with strawberries and the espresso petit fours. I was less enthralled with the scones. they were a tad bit too hard. I hate to be a mreanie, but they are missing an entire star because of this. When you go to afternoon tea, getting the scones right is a must. They did get the accompaniments (lemon curd, jam, and clotted cream) right. \n\nService-wise, the girl who waited on us was really nice, and fairly attentive. Especially considering the place was fairly busy. She did seem harried though. Which meant part of our order was wrong and we had to track down our own silverware. Neither was a big deal, but they detracted a bit from the serene experience that afternoon teas is supposed to be. \n\nI also had an issue with parking. Due to road construction and rush hour, the best I could do was either a pricey pay lot or 1 hour parking. That problem can be easily be remedied by carpooling or taking public transportation.\n\nTea service, in general is pricey. I was being treated, so I was basically happy, even with the less than positive aspects of our visit. I don't think my friend, who was paying, will go back.

First of all, we got there a little early to set up.  The server saw us standing with all of our things outside, but made us wait in the cold for another 15 minutes while she was \"setting up.\"  We could see that all she was doing was turning on lamps.  We were told beforehand via email by Pauline that we would be provided areas for cake and photos.  When we were setting up, the server seemed surprised when we asked for a small table to set up the guest book and welcome sign.  I felt like we had to really push them to let us have a small table.  They were extremely rude when we were trying to set up decorations. A lady came up to us (I think she was the owner) and told me very crudely that we brought too many decorations and they aren't used to this amount of decor.  What's ironic, is that we actually sent Dartealing a photo of our centerpieces beforehand, and they said they'd be able to accommodate us.  We also got in trouble for standing on one of the benches to put up a banner (apparently the bench from from the 1700s and very fragile).  While I understand where they were coming from, they could have gone about it more politely.   The service was slow, and we overall felt very unwelcomed.  Mind you, we also spent more than $1000 that afternoon.  At that premium, I truly expected top of the line service.  Instead we were treated like crap. \n\nI found the tea sandwiches to be ok--a little dry, nothing too special. The scones were rather hard and dense.  The tea itself was flavorful and unique. But overall, given our experience with customer service, we will not be back.", "author": "Jen C."}

Secondly, they have creepily low ceilings, which added to the Alice in Wonderland effect with some of their tall waitresses. Aside from that, the decor is mostly cutesy inside. Mismatched lounge chairs, books, hats you can try on, but alas, shitty plastic tables. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best. Having had clotted cream in London and high tea at the Rotunda, I came here with high expectations and was SO disappointed. Their smoked salmon was HORRIBLE - I was not expecting a pate. The brie sandwich was mostly bread with less than a centimeter thick of brie. Ham and cheese was my favorite and actually quite tasty. The desserts were sub par as well. Where were the petit fours? Why did we have so many weird tiramisus? The scones had large chunks of white cream in them? The cream was literally just fat in a dish. And seriously, presentation SUCKED! We got served in 2 courses which alone was weird. I was really hoping for everything to come out on those cute tiered platters, but nope! It all came out on a plate. \n\nLastly, to top off my 2 star review, service was horrible. Super slow for anything. No attention to detail. Waited for 15 minutes for a refill of my tea.. were they fetching the water from the well before they boiled it? (oh wait no, she just forgot and had my tea pot sitting on a table until I reminded her). \n\nOnly good thing was the Parisian Earl Grey. VERY yummy!

It's probably when she is 6 months pregnant, like I am today.\n\nCelebrated my 28th birthday here with 10 of my closest friends. The staff was wonderful, attentive and very VERY accommodating to changes in menu, number of people etc. Its truly a charming tea room, which mismatched china and vintage furniture. Definitely more spacious than Lovejoy's and probably less crowded, but more or less the same vibe. \n\nI have been to Dartealing for afternoon tea once before with one other person for their regular menu. As prior reviews have mentioned, the fish & chips, spicy garlic and turkey pesto are some of the best tea sandwiches on their menu. However, during winter they serve a special menu in lieu of their regular menu. There are different sandwiches and the tea services prices are a few dollars higher. \n\nFor my birthday I pre-ordered 5 Indulgence Tea services (good for 10) with Turkey Pumpkin, Chicken Cranberry, Brie Apple, and Honey Ham with Watercrest sandwiches. It also came with Warm Chocolate Peppermint Scones, Tea cakes, holiday cookies and Bread Pudding. Since I am pregnant, they also let me include a few Cucumber and herb sandwiches on the side. All the food was pretty good and definitely more than enough for 10 people! My favorites were the Brie Apple, the Chicken Cranberry and the Cucumber herb. The scones and tea cakes were really delicious as well. I liked the bread pudding but it was a bit too rich and sweet for my taste. \n\nOverall, I truly loved having my birthday at Dartealing Lounge.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-11-30", "description": "\"All you're supposed to do is once in a while give the boys a little tea...\" -- Tea and Sympathy (1956)\n\nA long-standing family tradition, the Friday after Thanksgiving the girls go to afternoon tea.  We look for an English Tea service somewhere in the Bay Area - you know, bottomless pots of tea, tea sandwiches, pastries with clotted cream, lemon curd, jams, etc.  We have been doing this since my niece was 2 or 3 years old (so probably 10 years?).\n\nThis year we came to DarTEAling.  A quaint little shop off 3rd, we were seated right away and handed menus.  Our places already had tea cups, extra small plates and paper napkins.  Silverware was in a cup on a table off to the side with a sugar pot (no cubes, pure sugar). There was a cake plate in the middle of the table awaiting our selection of food.\n\nOur server was nice to make suggestions for what we should order - there were 4 of us (one was my 12 year old niece).  The limit the kid's tea to 10 and under, but what 12 year old wants tea and curried peanut butter and jelly sandwiches?  So they do need to rethink that.  Luckily, we ordered the Afternoon Tea for 2 (thanks to my Yelp check in, there was a discount) and a Taste Tea for 2 (which only came with 1 pot of tea).  This allowed me to add on a pot of Cocoa for my niece.  She picked a sandwich that seemed plain (turns out it wasn't really).  \n\nWe ordered our selection of sandwiches and I explained my treenut allergy (Again, need that neck tattoo I'm so tired of explaining) and just asked that she point out anything with treenuts so I could avoid it.  Instead, our entire platters came out with no treenuts.  Kudos.\n\nWe received our 3 pots of tea first, then the cocoa.  My niece also got a little cup of whipped cream with sprinkles on top (she wishes they had asked her since she hates sprinkles - I ate them off the cream for her).  On the 2nd serving of cream, I asked for no sprinkles and they obliged.\n\nAfter much waiting, we received out raspberry jam and lemon curd...and then we waited some more.  Finally, our sandwiches, salad, scones, sausage rolls, cranberry bread slices and macarons.  My niece loves macarons and prefers chocolate, so I asked what they had and they only had fancier flavors - so she ended up with espresso chocolate.  Luckily, she liked them.\n\nWe also ordered 4 crumpets, but we waited for so long for those - had to remind her twice and they came so late we were too full to really eat them.  We were pretty much ready to go when the server came by to say \"I'll let the kitchen know you are ready for the rest of your service.\"  The sweets.  So we got more scones (luckily a different flavor), cranberry bars, more shortbread and cream puffs.  We really didn't have room, but we ate a little and got a box for the rest.\n\nThere was only one server working - which was the issue.  What should have been a nicely paced tea, was 2 and a half hours and food took forever and the gaps were too long.  The food was delicious, mostly as described (bacon and eggs is really an egg salad with chunks of bacon and what I guess is paprika since it is electric orange).  Everything was quite flavorful and I would go back, but they really need to work on the pacing.  My pot of tea was cold by the time the last plate of food was delivered and never got the chance to have it refreshed.  Also, the tables are too small for so much stuff.  Plus, they might want to consider better kid-friendly options.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy it quite a lot.  Service was the biggest issue and is why this is 3 stars instead of 4.", "author": "Lindy F."}

(Will there ever be the option to give 1/2 stars on Yelp?)\n\nPlenty of street parking on a Sunday around noon, and though we'd made reservations, I think we could've walked in and gotten a table with no problem. Not sure if this was out of the ordinary though, so I'd make reservations again just to be safe. It's decently sized place, and open, so you're not bumping elbows with the table next to you. Some of the tables have big, comfy armchairs as seats too, so it's easy to sit back and relax over a cup (or 2 or 3 or...) of tea with whoever you're with.\n\nAt just over $20, I'd say it's pretty comparable in price to other tea places since I felt that the quantity of food was a tiny bit less than others. I could be wrong though; it's been a while since I last had high tea. For the taste-tea service, you get 4 tea sandwiches (only 1 kind though), a scone, mini tea loaf, sausage roll, 2 tea cookies, and a petit four along with your bottomless pot of tea (I barely finished half the pot!). I tried both the brie & chutney and curried chicken and I liked the chicken a lot better.

It was not of my choosing to go to a tea place! All jokes aside, I was actually pretty down to have tea with the gf and be a true sir. \n\nWe went on a Saturday around lunch time and waited shortly to be seated as the place was already full of people. The selection we chose included 8 tea sandwiches (4 types), 2 tartlets, 2 cucumber cups, 2 scones, and petit fours. The sandwiches we chose were smoked salmon, fish & chips, turkey pesto, and brie and pear. The salmon one sounded like it would be really good but there was only salmon the size of a dime on each one and it was overpowered by the cream. The other three sandwiches were fantastic: the fish & chips was tasty with a nice crunch and the brie always pears well with pear. The turkey pesto was my favorite one. The other items were great also, but the best part of the meal goes to the scones. They were so soft and warm on the inside and so delicious with the cream! I did not think a tea place would have such good food!\n\nThis far in the review on a tea house and I still have not mentioned the tea! My gf chose a mango type of tea and I got one that had coconut. It was interesting but even though I like everything coconut, I probably would choose something else. The mango one was good though, but the real star of the show was not the tea. I think that since this place has good food, it would be worth checking out. It is pricey for the amount of food but we were stuffed by the end.

Dartealing feels like a cozy house with mismatched porcelain and chinaware (and questionable bathroom postcard decor). Most people come on a reservation, and there is almost nothing else to do in the immediate vicinity, so reservations are advised.\n\nWe did the Afternoon Tea for Two ($48 total), which came with two pots of tea, 12 finger sandwiches (3 flavors), salad, two scones, and 6 small sweet pieces. The tea list is very expansive. I got the Cabana Boy, which is good if you're looking for a fruity flavor that retains a strong tea flavor. Sandwiches were whatever (lots of bread), but some interesting varieties (my favorite was the Brie/Pepper/Apple). The scones were the best takeaway - freshly baked, not-hard-triangles, and unique flavor profiles (we had a lemon cardamon? rosemary? some kind of herb) and a cream spread that resembles at least the texture of clotted cream.\n\nI think the High Tea set actually looked more appealing, because they swap out some of the small dessert pieces for heartier savory items.

We went there our first time shortly after it opened and there were definitely kinks to work out in their service but I let it slide since I knew it was the owner's dream to open up this cute tea shop. However, it's been at least 5 months since that first experience and things still haven't gotten better.\n\nI really hope the owner reads this review because this is the perfect example of where passion does not meet execution.\n\nWe came here for the annual Fall Buffet. I live at the Palms and received an email saying that we would receive a goodie bag and \"cake and tea\" after attending the buffet for $29 a person.\n\n3 of us came in the afternoon. Let me up front, the food here is pretty good and the decor of DarTealing is adorable but the service here led to a disappointing experience here.\n\nFirst, at the front of the room there are these delicious looking cupcakes in a cake stand. I heard a patron asking about whether she could have one and our waitress basically told her \"oh, they should be out in the other buffet section\" (they weren't) thereby telling her no, you can't have one.  Here's the thing, if guests can't eat them, please don't display them. And if guests can eat them, please let them, especially if they ask for it. The thought is that if it's a buffet, you should be able to eat anything.\n\nSecond, the buffet had specific seating times, i.e. 12:30-2:00pm was our time. The tea room was not even 1/2 full during our seating time and when we arrived it was even emptier. However, our waitress still came by with our check at 2:00pm. I understand that if the tea room was full, there is a need to clear out the patrons to prepare for your next seating but this was CLEARLY not the case and it's sort of off putting to get your check when you are trying to enjoy your scone.  Like my hubs was saying, isn't the whole point of afternoon tea relaxing and enjoying the afternoon unhurried?\n\nThird, one of the couples came in between the seatings and there were clearly things lacking in the buffet. The man asked the waitress and she said, oh sorry you came in between the seatings and he responded, \"so? does that mean I don't get to eat anything?\" she went to the back and then brought out some sandwiches and scones. Again, I don't own a business but if I did I wouldn't want to alienate my patrons.\n\nFourth, we felt bad for staying beyond our given time so we asked for the check. It took her 10 minutes to come by to get the check and I kid you not, 30 minutes for her to bring it back. In fact, I had to ask her, um we gave you our credit card 30 minutes ago. She came back with and apologized saying that she forgot about it because the phone rang. By this point, there were about 5 people in the entire place, that's really not excusable.\n\nLastly, and one of the biggest disappointments was that we came here because they specifically said you will get a goodie bag of \"tea and cake\" to take home with you. We got a puny little truffle and one tea bag along with a coupon that expires in less than one month. I'm sorry but if you are going to say, \"tea and cake\" goodie bag, then give out tea and cake! One piece of truffle is not cake and one tea bag? Geez..that's not a goodie bag...\n\nSo I wanted to love this place since the beginning. I love afternoon tea, it's my very favorite dining activity and I hope that the owner will retrain her staff to really listen to the customers and treat them like guests who will want to come back.", "author": "Betty C."}

The best description I can come up with is a coffee shop but with tea - and expensive. Yes, more expensive than Starbucks. :O \n\nLots of flowery stuff everywhere too. It seems to be popular for bridal showers and things like that. I am not really into that kind of things - showers etc, so to be fair please read my review with that in mind.\n\nThe teas were good. There were like 6 different pots. The server told us what each one was in the beginning and she brought out the food and did the same. Afterwards, we never hear back from her. She made us feel like we are just bothering her, so we did not really bother asking anything again.\n\nThere are scones, small sandwiches cut into little triangles, french toasts and macaroons. They are ok, not super delicious and I think I am not alone in thinking that because we had lots of leftovers. The strawberry cake that someone bought from Schubert's beat all that stuff.\n\nThey also timed your reservations. We only got two hours. Very interesting.\n\nThe bill came to $35. \n\nWhile I have a great time hanging out with the girls, this is not my kind of scene.", "author": "July N."}

DarTealing is so charming and cute! \n\nMy cousin and I (and our boyfriends) were lucky enough to make it on Oct 3rd for their chocolate pairing and everyone including the boys enjoyed it! I didn't think chocolate tea can have such an interesting taste together.\n\nWe started off with the Violet Mist. I loved that it was decaf and I absolutely loved the taste of it! I actually liked it better sans cream! Then we had what felt like an unlimited supply of yummy sandwiches! We all agreed on the white fish mousse and the curry but I actually really enjoyed the cucumber as well!\n\nI was iffy about the salad-- the purple parts were too bitter for my taste.\n\nAnd then-- the magic of the chocolate pairing began! \nWe started with lighter teas and white chocolate and eventually ended with darker. I won't list all the teas we tried becuase that's practically the entire menu but I will give some honorable mentions!\n\nThe Cabana Boy was a green tea with strawberries. From first scent, we were in love!  We also enjoyed the chamomile lavender but our ultimate favorite of the day was the Lapsang Souchong. It has a very smokey taste to it but it reminded us all of dim sum and left us with a very warm feeling.\n\nI will definitely be back to DarTealing!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-11", "description": "Updated in response to the owner's comment:\n\nFirst of all thank you for your response and I appreciate your opinion but I have a few things that I also want to address:\n\nThis is actually my second visit. My first visit, which I paid full price, was better but mediocre. I decided to come back and give you a second chance because of the travel zoo deal hoping that it would be better since I really do enjoy afternoon tea. The fact that you found it necessary to bring it up in your comment implies that I am not as valued as a customer paying full price and therefore not entitled to the same level of service and quality. If that is the case, you should list it in the fine print of the voucher so people are aware that since they are going to be getting a discount, they are going to be treated as second class citizens and not entitled to the same service as someone paying full price.\n\nAlso, as someone with an MBA who runs a multiple facilities, budgets, staff, etc. I do understand what it takes to run a business and your point of view but I also understand the importance of customer service which I feel your business lacks. I'm assuming that the reason you made the business decision to offer 25% off was to entice people to try your place in hopes of gaining a returning customer so I am baffled as to why you would take this stance and treat the customers that decided to take you up on this offer like this.\n\nAs for the coffee, it's clearly poor quality. I actually really enjoy dark coffee so that was not the problem. I also enjoy beverages with spices but this clearly didn't work for me. Also, the cream that I asked for twice, was regular milk which did not help. Your staff should learn the difference between whole milk and cream.\n\nAs for the lychee tea, we didn't notice the extra fee on the menu. In fact, before writing this review, I went to your site to double check and it is not on there. I do understand that you are in a sticky position since I can see your point in how some people might get offended but one thing that would have made the situation a bit better is if the waitress didn't have such an attitude when we asked what the $3 was for. All we wanted was a clear explanation. It's not something that we would have had an issue with if we knew ahead of time.\n\nAs for the cream, I completely understand that you are not going to take the time to weigh/measure it so they all come out of the kitchen identical. That would be ludicrous but I can tell you that our serving was significantly less than others. You can look at the photo, I only wish that I took a photo of the second serving so you could compare. In fact, when we ordered the additional scone it was twice as much as the first time when we had 2 scones instead of one which doesn't make any sense. All I needed was about a half of teaspoon to finish my first scone. I ordered the third scone because I had so much cream left from the second serving that I didn't want to waste it. When it arrived, it came with an additional side of cream that I didn't expect so instead of throwing it out because there was no way we were going to be able to eat all that cream, I sent the cream back which I'm sure you were able to serve someone else since it didn't even hit the table. Your waitress should have suggested ordering an additional scone for $3 as an alternative to ordering just cream for $2 with all the fixing as an option. If she would have taken initiative to do so, that would have solved the problem from the beginning although it doesn't change the fact we were given a significantly smaller serving the first time around but then again, why should I expect any customer service since I used a coupon. Oh and thank you for not charging me for the cream that I sent back that you were able to serve someone else and that you shouldn't have charged me for in the first place.\n\nAnd lastly, having a nail salon is not a negative but I don't know why it required such a long winded response. It almost seems like you are using this as a forum to advertize. As someone who gets a gel mani and pedi every 2 weeks religiously, I don't have an issue with nail salons and I'm actually quite used to the smell. It was the person I was with that thought he was crazy when he told me he smelled nail polish because he didn't notice the salon next door. The odor wasn't very strong but something should be done to keep it out of your establishment.\n\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to comment and good luck to you and your business.", "author": "Diane M."}

Take the time to spend a bit of time here, relaxing in the cozy confines of the charming folds of lovely comfort. Everything about Dartealing is adorable -- the menus, the servers, the cups.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-25", "description": "I've never been here during peak lunch hours, but whenever I go around 2pm on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, it always seems like the crowd is just beginning to thin. \n\nI've had the Afternoon Tea Service for Two as well as several teas and scones. My thoughts on these are as follows:\n\nThe sandwiches are fantastic. I have no complaints on the ones I've tried. For the smoked salmon mousse & dill, just note that it's a salmon mousse, so don't expect large pieces of salmon in your sandwich. I was iffy about trying the curried chicken sandwich at first, but it was surprisingly delicious, and I would definitely order again. Finally, I also highly recommend the brie, pepper jelly, & green apple sandwich, especially for huge cheese lovers like myself. The textures work well together, and the crunch of the green apple is perfect against the silkiness of the brie. I enjoyed all these sandwiches so much that sometimes I kind of just want to walk over to DarTealing and order their sandwiches much like I would in a deli. But they're not a deli...so I stop myself. *sigh*\n\nFor the teas, I greatly, greatly enjoyed the very cheesily named Somewhere My Love (regardless of the nostalgia that Doctor Zhivago brings me). I believe you need to pay a little extra for this tea, but I thought it was worth it. I was initially worried that the vanilla would come out too strong (I tend to shy away from strong vanilla flavors), but  the vanilla tones came out just right, and the tea itself was perfectly rich and creamy. (Also, as a note, 2 bottomless teas are ridiculously excessive for 2 people)\n\nThe crumpets were nothing special. I didn't really enjoy mine much. The scones, however, have the perfect texture. They change the scones every now again, it seems. I once had poppy scones and I've also had rosemary scones. They were both delicious. Scones tend to be too dry or too crumbly when not done well, but I must say, DarTealing's scones have always pulled through for me. The textures and flavors have been perfect every time.\n\nA word of caution to fellow scone lovers though, DarTealing's cream is nowhere like the clotted cream they tend to use in London. The cream that they use here is much, much lighter, with a texture that is very similar to whipped cream. That's probably my biggest disappointment as a huge clotted cream fan.", "author": "Clarisse V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-21", "description": "I have visited several tea houses in the SF Bay Area, as well as the Seattle area, and Dartealing is my favorite of all of them.\n\nMost tea houses have really good tea OR really good food OR really good scones (which belong in a category of their own) OR really good ambience, but it's rare to find a tea house that combines all of these qualities. Dartealing is such a place.\n\nI generally only ever get the afternoon tea services here, so my review is centered around those.\n\nI recommend Dartealing for anyone looking to enjoy a solidly delicious afternoon tea service with friends for a couple of hours, particularly if being able to hear the conversation is important to you. :) It's very relaxing here.\n\nSOUND/AMBIENCE\nI like coming here for lunch with friends during weekdays, as it's rarely so occupied as to have a wait. More importantly, I can actually hear my friends as we converse whenever we eat here. What! \n\nThe interior is tastefully Victorian (stab in the dark; I know not my time periods well) and replete with comfortable armchairs, as well as little tables with regular chairs.  Utensils are available in tabletop pots, by the way, in case you're wondering why your meal doesn't come accompanied by forks and knives.  \n\nIt's a very comfortable place to spend a couple of hours with your friends chatting and enjoying fragrant tea whilst nibbling on nummy sandwiches, or to work for a few hours on your laptop.  If I recall correctly, the music is quiet lounge jazz, which is just perfect.\n\nSERVICE\nThe service can be a little slow, but they are exceptionally friendly and attentive.  I think they operate on a policy of letting you enjoy your meal and trying not to be underfoot, so you do need to flag them down if you'd like to refill your bottomless pot of tea or move to the next course of your afternoon tea service, but I generally am fond of the staff here.\n\nThat said, because of the nature of afternoon tea service, I would advise blocking out a good two hours for the afternoon tea, as it takes that long to really enjoy the experience.\n\nFOOD\nRare is the tea house that serves scones that are fresh and not rock-hard or dry.  The accompaniments of lemon curd and delicious Devonshire cream complete the scone experience.\n\nFurthermore, I love their sandwich options *so much*.  They have an abundance of interesting sandwich options, and I encourage you to try them all. My favorite savory sandwich is the curry chicken; my favorite sweet sandwich is the speculoocious ginger snap, which is just as delicious and mouth-watering as it sounds.\n\nThe salads served with afternoon tea are tastefully tossed in a light vinaigrette, and appealingly simple. I like me some salad without dreadful tomatoes adorning its crown, and Dartealing serves me well in this respect.\n\nThe dessert options are tasty and varied, never the same between two afternoon teas, and always freshly made.\n\nNevertheless, I always like saving one of my Speculoocious Ginger Snaps sandwiches for last, as I like it even more than any of their dessert options.\n\nTEA\nI love the blends available at Dartealing.  I also love that you get a bottomless pot with every afternoon tea service.  The china here is exquisitely fun and beautiful, and sipping tea from it is always a pleasant experience.  Just try to remember to use the strainer whenever you pour yourself a new cup: I'm dreadfully guilty of forgetting and having to pluck tea leaves from between my teeth.\n\nMy favorite flavored black tea blends are Her Majesty's Secret Service (\"Hints of bourbon vanilla sprinkled with pieces of vanilla bean blended with black tea\") and Citizen \"Rosebud\" (\"Premium black tea sprinkled with rose petals with just a tiny hint of smokiness to balance out the floral notes\").\n\nFavorite rooibos: Caramel Carousel. That's a mouthful, both tasteful and difficult to say. \"Melange of toffee and caramel.\"\n\nFavorite Pu'er: The Emperor's Cup - Black Pu'er tea: \"Earthly Pu'erh leaf balanced with rich chocolate & a minty finish...a robust cup worthy of royalty.\"  One of the best chocolate mint teas I've ever had: perfect with a touch of milk and sugar, and actually minty/chocolately without tasting medicinal.", "author": "Karena T."}

If I have to stick a pinkey up, I'm going to gag.\n\nCame here on a Sunday with a group of 10 females. We got a set, because evidently they do that with a big group. Even though we called almost a month in advance, they told us they would only seat us in 2 separate tables. Sad...but then we arrived and they sat us at one table. Happy? Confused.\n\nThe sandwiches we got:\n1) turkey and pesto cream - I could only tell it was the turkey pesto because it was greenish.\n2) smoked salmon and capers - Couldn't taste much of a difference.\n3) dartealing curried chicken - Probably my favorite. It had flavor.\n4) smoked ham and horseradish cheddar - I could barely taste the horseradish...or ham....or cheddar.

If you come here without the set, focus on the curried chicken. And maybe the egg bacon. Everything else is kind of bleh.  It came with scones, sweets, and salad. Salad was well dressed. Scones everyone else thought was great, but I begged to differ. It was pretty dense, and I know scones ARE dense, but these were too much. Maybe everyone else has not had good scones (see John Campbell's Irish Bakery).\n\nThe teas were ok, but since we had so many people, they didn't have enough of the tea catchers for us all. How sad. They just put it in a bag and let it seep. Overall, the teas we got were pretty good. Her Majesty's Secret Service was likely my favorite, but I'm a coffee person.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-09", "description": "My favorite tea place. Period. \n\nLook, I love Lovejoys as much as any other tea junkie, but I'd much rather be at Dartealing than any other place. There are times when I don't want the extra frills and whimsy of Lovejoys. I have to face the facts when it comes to my tastes: when I go to Lovejoys, I automatically feel the pressure of looking prim, proper, and forcing myself to say, \"I am treating myself here. I am treating myself here.\"\n\nYes. There IS a point where you really need to keep calm and carry on. Tea is supposed to be a time of relaxation. And Dartealing, precious place, is truly the one place where I felt totally, absolutely, 100% content. To those that know me, this is a huge feat.\n\nQuick reasons why I will always choose Dartealing over Lovejoys:\n1. Dartealing is nowhere near as crowded.\n2. Dartealing has a pleasant atmosphere that has never been too loud or uncomfortably quiet.\n3. The staff here are lovely, and they are pretty good at knowing their clientele. Being here makes me feel like I'm visiting a good friend's home rather than a yoga center or a fantasy land meant for young adult writers.\n4. Parking is dirt cheap on weekends. Seriously. I came in on Saturday, and the meter only cost A FREAKIN' QUARTER PER HOUR.\n5. It's only a block from work. Personal perks, yeah, I know.\n6. The menu is superior, especially in terms of tea, which is the reason why I'm going in the first place. Different scones every day, a special sandwich of the month, and a massive tea menu that seems to rotate every once in a while.\n7. I could actually get reservations. On a Saturday. Without having to wait two bloody hours. And the reservation process was painless. They request that you pre-order your food ~3 days in advance, and this is so they can get your food to you quickly.\n8. I went in by myself on a Friday afternoon for lunch. They were excellent about explaining how the menu worked, and were happy to work with me to get some selections going.\n9. I love how you can smell the scones baking from wherever you're sitting. The flavors always vary - so far, I've been happy to have an orange marmalade, an almond butterscotch, and a lavender honey scone. Oh yes.\n10. Usually, I'm a huge stickler about service. But I've always come in at a time when it isn't busy, and I've never felt awkward about asking for a waitress. They always apologize if there's a wait, and I seriously don't mind. Stick a bottomless pot of delicious tea in front of me, keep it refreshed often enough, and I am good. Go ahead and serve other folks first. I'm here to relax, have tea, and stuff myself full of sandwiches and sweets.\n\nOkay. Maybe it wasn't so quick. But there are numbers, so they're at least organized nicely. The clotted cream is a bit too close to butter for my tastes, and that's one thing I'd choose Lovejoys for, but that's not enough to sway my decision. When I came in for lunch on my own, they simply split the \"tea for two\" order in half, both in price and in food - honestly, that was more than enough. It is the perfect way to treat myself when I don't want to think about work and life in general. I get there, I sit down, I order tea and vittles, and I am absolutely, wonderfully, blissfully content for the 1-2 hours I'll be there. And it's because Dartealing is the sort of tea lounge that I look for: not overly stuffy, not trying too hard to be whimsical or zen.

I highly recommend! The same waitress helped us both times and service was excellent. I really wish I could remember her name because she was incredibly sweet. We had pretty large groups and she was very accommodating. Even put up with us staying past closing for us to chat and help us take pictures. \n\nThe food overall (sandwiches and pastries) was a solid 4. There were a few items that really didn't suit my taste, but the set menus provided such a wide assortment that you're bound to have a few items that you find tasty. The sandwiches under \"Veggies & Sweet\" were probably my favorite because of all the unique fillings (honey lavender!). Some of my friends didn't like them as much but the \"Land & Sea\" sandwiches had more traditional centers, which were preferred. At the end, they give you a tower of pastries that I thought was adorable. I'm usually not a big fan of scones, but I thought they were decent here. I think that says a lot because I actually normally hate scones. I thought the chocolate mint (?) one was okay, maybe even a bit tasty, paired with the cream they provided. Some of the other pastries were either a hit or miss for me, but I liked that they were generally not overly sweet. \n\nAs far as teas go, my favorite is definitely the Breakfast Candy. There were a few other flavors worth mentioning but I unfortunately don't recall what they were. \n\nThe total is a bit pricey compared to your average meal, but I thought the food to money ratio was better here than the other high tea places in the city. At the end of the meal, we were actually quite full (though part of it was likely due to all of the tea we drank). And for those of you wondering, PARKING is incredibly easy in this area.

My friend and I shared a bottomless pot of the \"Champagne of the Himalayas\" (because let's face it, how totally baller do you sound saying you drank \"Champagne of the Himalayas\"?). It was excellent--piping hot and perfectly brewed.\n\nWe also got a platter of sandwiches: roasted red peppers and hummus, chocolate peanut butter indulgence and turkey pesto. They were absolutely delicious. I love the non-traditional offerings like pesto and chocolate peanut butter. Mmm! The meal also included a garden salad, which was pretty forgettable.\n\nA word about the teapots: Some of them are rather poorly made and can spill a lot of scalding hot liquid on you if not held properly. Don't be afraid to ask for a different teapot if that happens. \n\nService was okay. It's largely staffed by Asian women whose grasp of English ranges from good to no-speak-English.

Anyway, we decided to try this place.  The location is awful, surrounded by drunk and drugged-out homeless all around.\nThe place is very small but nicely decorated.  They kept the main door open with its iron bars and I had my eyes on the main door as anyone very sketchy could have walked in any moment.\nThe tea cups are all mismatched but I think that adds to the charm.  They are thin porcelain with wide rims so you can taste the flavor of the tea better.\nThe d\u00e9cor is nice and there is a lot of it.  The texture on the walls is kind of nice, it looks like wallpaper but it is not.  It all looks a bit kitsch though.\n\nThe server was wearing a t-shirt and jeans. I think a more grown-up and polished uniform or clothes would have been more appropriate.\n\nThere are hats and gloves, like at LoveJoy, for people to wear.  I do not understand why having tea has to turn into a clown show, but, oh well.\n\nThe prices were high, especially for such a shitty location but I guess it is SF and you gotta live with it.\n\nThe tea selection was nice and there was a nice description next to each tea so I appreciated that.\n\nThe sandwich selection is pretty vast so that was good. Unfortunately, all the sandwiches tasted the same, mayo, mayo, mayo everywhere or something very similar to it.\n\nThere is the option of a salad with the sandwiches and you get a few leaves drenched in vinegar so that the vinegar touches also all the sandwiches. Gross.\n\nWe did not get an offer to refill our tea pots until we were ready to leave.\n\nAll in all, it is OK.  Better than the Fairmont, LoveJoy, and the Tea Shoppe that is located in a smelly polo equipment store.

The spiced raisin chutney and the brie was pretty good.\n\nEverything else was bad. Out of a long list of things not to like, the stuffiness and heat was the worst. Within 5 minutes of entering the place, I was uncomfortable; by the time we were ready to leave, I was miserable. There is no moving air in this place, and the temperature was way high. If you stuff a large number of people into a \"cozy\" space, you have to have some ventilation. (This wasn't just me, I shared a word with another customer while waiting for the bathroom who remarked on how hostile it was.)\n\nThe food was not great. The sausage in puff pastry was a lot like eating a microwaved frozen thing. The Welsh rabbit tasted a bit scorched with little black bits on the cheese and burned edges on the bread (not deep brown, char black). No, I wasn't going to send it back and give the kitchen a chance to correct it because it was obvious at a glance, and if it was an aberration the waitstaff would have caught it at the pass.\n\nThe bathrooms were kind of dirty. Someone was waiting to get in the men's room, so I decided to use the sink outside the bathrooms to move things along...no way to dry my hands? Not even a place to put paper towels, like an empty dispenser that needed refilling? No wastebasket for used paper towels? Come to our fancy tea lounge where we expect you to wash up like like you're a Boy Scout on a camping trip.\n\nThe wait to get the bill was far too long, especially since the waitress could see I was uncomfortable.\n\nBesides the oppressive heat and stuffiness, the biggest problem with this place is it presents itself as a somewhat high-end experience (and certainly charges high-end prices) but it delivers nothing close to that.

Found this place through yelp and decided to give it a try based on the rave review...boy, it did not let us down! \n\nOur party consisted of 8 adults and 7 young kids. All the way through the staff was uber accommodating and friendly, which was impressive to say the least. They would come ask if we are ready for the food so when we eat, and keep the scones warm in the oven until then. This alone earns so many points from me!\n\nDuring the planning process before the party, the staff was also helpful and promptly responds to any questions.\n\nWe had four flavors of sandwiches and teas. Sandwiches: lavender, fish fillet, curried chicken, and another I forgot. Teas: Jasmine, Earl Grey and Watermelon Rooibos (my personal favorite out of them). I even purchased two bags of the Booibos tea when we were leaving the restaurant. \n\nIn summary, this tea lounge has great service, excellent food, and a very chill ambience to go with it. Highly recommended!", "author": "Ed L."}

Just the right amounts of cute, kitschy, and delicious. \n\nWent here with roommates for my birthday, we got the Afternoon Tea service for three. What ended up on our table: \n\n--Three bottomless pots of tea. \n'Breakfast Candy': So, so good! Well worth the extra $3. Black tea with almond and caramel flavors. I ended up buying two (sort of expensive) ounces of this to take home with me. \n'Lapsang Souchong': Tasted like a campfire in a tea cup, very smoky and strong. I personally loved it, though my boyfriend wasn't as enthused. \n'Jasmine & Jade': A very good jasmine green tea. \n\n--A whole lotta sandwiches (we got to pick out five flavors). Curried chicken, brie/jelly/apple, hungarian egg, tuna, and cucumber herbs. Really liked all of them. \n\n--Three scones with devonshire, lemon curd, and raspberry preserves. Why can't I make scones this good? Why can't I eat devonshire cream by the bowlful? Why can't I live here forever? \n\n--3 bite-sized butter cookies. Yum.\n\n--6 bite-sized fruit tarts. Yum.\n\nWe were all full by the end of our tea, which was really unexpected. My two tea companions were both manly men so that says something about the deceptively dainty-looking food. \n\nDon't come here if you're looking for fancypants tea service with matching tableware and linen napkins. DarTealing is sweetly casual and relaxed, like having tea in your favorite grandmother's living room rather than the queen's tea room (though my grandma is a queen in her own right so there goes my analogy, oops). \n\nDo come here if you want to drink lots of fantastic tea and nibble on tasty sweets and sandwiches, all served by really nice and accommodating people.", "author": "Angela N."}

Its surroundings are not the best, but once you enter you feel like you are in a different world - a safer one that you and your female friends would be forced to conclude is \"cute\". One thing that sets it apart from other high tea places is that the atmosphere is cozy rather than prim.\n\nI love the Blooms and the Covent platters - they are priced comparably to the other (low-end) high tea places I've been to, but you get more for your money. It's enough to serve as a full brunch, especially when the people you go with are city-dwelling women. And it all tastes fantastic. I haven't tried a sandwich flavor I didn't like, but curried egg and apple is my favorite. The scones are scrumptuous, go perfectly with tea and creamy butter, and come in different flavors on different days. My favorite so far was tiramisu, and I don't even like tiramisu by itself. With the Blooms, the salad also provides a great refreshing touch.", "author": "Martin L."}

The decor is super cute. There is a set of vintage glassware on a pass through shelf between the tea room and salon next door   Even the enameled clothespin that they use to present the bill to you is cute.  Everything is super shabby chic and tasteful. Five stars.\n\nI came a bit early because I didn't know exactly how long it would take to get there. It was also abnormally hot for San Francisco.  It was in the higher seventies and the tea room had no AC. (Not unusual I think for San Francisco). I waited in the waiting room awkwardly for about five minutes. I flagged a server down to check in and I told her that I had a cancellation and we would only be one person less than\noriginally anticipated.  Sure it was my fault for coming early but a glass of ice water would have been really nice.  Perhaps this is where things went south.  This is just dicta. Zero star reduction.\n\nThen my friends started coming. A lot of people also thought it was hot and asked for ice with our tea. We had ordered some fruity teasanes which happen to be really refreshing while iced.  We got the dirtiest look when we asked for the ice. Then the ice didn't come and we asked again. Someone commented \"Did we offend her?  I'm sure it's nontraditional.\"  They also set the table for six. And we asked for an additional set up. Minus one star for the ice incident.\n\nI then got a call that one additional friend was coming  \"we'll work something out\" says the server.  Who doesn't. About an hour later we had to ask two additional times about the cups meanwhile not everyone had cups. We used the cup the ice came in for one person and one guest just sat at the tea place with no beverage. Not to mention at the third request I got an \"I know!\" from the server. Then three cups and set ups came. Minus one star for cup incidents.\n\nLemon curd and jam. Hello scones. Where's the curd and jam?  We sat with our food for a while and ate the itty bitty sandwiches. And waited for the lemon curd and jam.  After a longer while we asked for some lemon curd and jam. And then the server gave us a glass container with lemon curd and a tiny bit of jam. \"This is all the jam we have!\" Really?  At this point in the service, we were all a little annoyed.  One of my friends said \"they probably had hella jam back there\". Someone else said \"you better use all that jam because (the server) looks like she's going to kill you\". We used all of it and it was good. One star reduction on jam incident.\n\nBTW anyone who's interested in an easy lemon curd recipe Ina Garten has a delicious one online.  My fridge is full of it right now.  No joke.\n\nWhen you place your order you are told there are refillable pots of tea. Nobody offered us more hot water for teas. Or cold water in lieu of tea. But at this point I wasn't so thirsty that I needed more interactions with their serving staff. This may have been avoided by someone saying \"Hi, how are you doing so far?\" during our visit.  Minus one star for not performing as promised.  \n\nLastly the bill came. It had an unexplained charge for \"split\" and tip precalculated and added into the total. And suddenly everything became clear. Why pay attention to that table who wants ice, jam, cups, and water when you're just going to add in gratuity anyway?  They also failed to account for the deposit I paid ahead of time, but fixed that. Minus one star for generalized bill snafu.\n\nAs to the food it was pretty unremarkable except for the quinoa salad which was delicious and the cutest little fruit tarts ever.  There was some white cake which was suffering in the heat. It was quite sad. It had cute pink and white frosting and it was melting off the cake.  I'm sure it was quite beautiful originally.  And I wasn't sure which sandwiches were which visually.  It would've been nice for them to explain them to us.

It doesn't look like anything from the outside, but I saw what looked like a really cute tea place when I looked inside.  I came back a week later with my husband.  The decor is really cute, as you can see from the other photos that have been posted.  One ding is that the chairs at our table were really uncomfortable.  I saw some nicer chairs and a cute sofa at the other tables that fit the theme better and are probably more comfortable.  The tea selection/variety was also really good.  However, the food wasn't good.  The sandwiches had way too much mayo - or whatever cream they use.  They were almost inedible.  The cakes weren't that good either - they didn't taste fresh and the cake was dry.    So all in all, the decor is cute and the tea is good, but the food is bad.

The Palace was way out of budget, Lovejoys in Noe seemed to be targeted at a demographic that still feeds tea to their teddy bear, and DarTealing had just the right amount of kitsch to make it special, but a legit menu and selection of teas that make for proper tea time.\n\nSince then, I've dragged nearly all my friends there. I schlepp across the Bay Bridge for a) the ambiance b) the extensive tea menu and c) the honey lavender cream tea sandwich. I'm never disappointed, always find parking, and always leave with a surprisingly full tummy! \n\nI'd tell you what I recommend, but frankly - it's all good. My usual is the Afternoon Tea Service for 2 - the perfect amount of tea sandwiches (good luck choosing your 3 options, btw), salad, scones, and petite sweets. Honey lavender cream is my ultimate favorite. Cucumber is phenomenal - and sort of a staple, the Curried Darjealing Chicken is delish, etc.etc. (I think you get the point). \n\nI find the $42 (or $48 - can't remember) to be fairly reasonable when split among two people.

I was super against a tea house since I had a horrible experience at crown and crumpet (bad food and rude owner/manager) and both lovejoy's and C&C have a similar policy that you had to pay the difference for no-shows in your party, ie: if only 6 show out of 10, you pay the $20+/person difference.\n\nFor a casual, girly time eating nibbles and drinking tea, I really did not want to deal with a strict cancellation policy, but we found Dartealing last minute and they were very accommodating, no cancellation charge or penalty for having a smaller party. The ladies there were really nice and best of all the food was really good! I am usually a fan of hot, flavorful asian food not tiny crustless sandwiches and scones, but everything was very delicious, there was enough fat to apease me while still being delicate, and the clotted cream was AMAZING, alot like cream cheese icing, whipped and less sweet, the birthday girl felt it should be incorporated into a more mainstream part of the American diet...(just what we need :P) \n\nAnyhoo, the service was a bit slow, but we had the place to ourselves. The bathroom was clean and I am guessing all of the relaxed atmosphere and casual reservation policy is due to the somewhat random location....(it is in SOMA, not a pretty stroll in noe valley or ghirardelli square like lovejoys and C&C respectively)\n\nWe all went shopping afterwards, just drove a couple blocks closer and it was really a great way to start the day. Oh yes, the nicoisse salad was SUPER delicious, there were 2 fried sunny side up eggs on top, everthing dressed and tossed with fresh green beans and tomatoes, soooo good to round out all the starch in the sandwiches, I reccomend the turky pesto, brie chutney and curry.", "author": "Lily G."}

Parking there during the day wasn't as tough as I thought it would be (all the meters take credit cards), although I don't recommend going when the Giants have a home game. It's an adorable and comfortable space, and the staff there has always been sweet and welcoming.\n\nHaving checked out other major tea lounges in SF (namely Lovejoy's/Lovey's which have very similar vibes and menus), there are some key differences to note:\n\n1) DarTealing has the best scones, by far. They're huge with a nice crunchy crust, and have been baked with fresh lavender. I could not get enough.\n\n2) Afternoon Tea for 2 is $48 (compared to $39 at the Lovejoy's places), but I think it includes more. There are definitely more desserts and you don't have to pay extra for lemon curd. They are also very generous with the devon cream.I also think the tea sandwiches at DT are a bit larger. DT also has a Yelp check in offer of $40 for Afternoon Tea for two, which is a wonderful deal.\n\n3) As far as tea sandwich selection goes, I think all the places have a lot of variety. I do have to say that I really disliked DT's smoked salmon and dill sandwich. They add chives instead of capers and it was so creamy (but not exactly cream cheese) and chive-y that I couldn't really taste the salmon. It was also sweet, somehow, which I didn't like because I prefer a more savory salmon sandwich that emphasizes that wonderful salmon flavor. It's also the only sandwich I am guaranteed to choose every time at any place that serves tea sandwiches, so it's the only one I can compare across tea places. \n\n4) I do really like the DT sandwiches with olives, because they use the green olives with pimento that I love, so I especially recommend the havarti and green olive sandwich.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great tea lounge. They also sell loose leaf tea, pastries, tea service china, and tea accessories. I highly recommend it if you're in the area and check in here on Yelp, but skip the salmon sandies until they balance out the flavors.", "author": "Rachel A."}

I was delighted by a never ending pot of peach black tea that was served in a adorable floral pot. The ladies I lunched with and myself ordered a tea that came with a few sweets and scones, and each set came with a choice of two sandwich flavors. My favorite was the fish and chips, what a cute way to capture a British classic. The scones were delicious, and came in inventive flavors. While perhaps not the most traditional, still very much enjoyable. I was so pleased to also get to meet Pauline the owner and Chef, she is wildly interesting and even inspiring. \nSide Note: to everyone complaining about service being slow, you should know that tea is not to be rushed.

It wasn't too busy, but it definitely picked up after we arrived. We had the standard Covent Garden tea for two. We picked 4 sandwiches, which were all stellar, and 2 teas, which were pleasantly flavorful. The scones were delightful as well. I wish there was a larger option for pastry flavors, I'm not a fan of coconut and didn't have the choice for another flavor. Service was great, I appreciated the staff periodically checking in and seeing if we needed anything. I also appreciated that the staff knew all about the teas, which flavor profiles were best matched for your preferences, and weren't at all pushy with their suggestions!

Secondly, the largest error: please revise your Yelp discount's fine print so large parties are not confused on how many they can use. Lastly and most importantly, I hope the staff and management are clear that customers generally expect to receive their full orders; hence we were very disappointed in getting less tea pots than we'd ordered.  \n\nIn ALL my years of dining around San Francisco- and throughout all of California- I've never ordered something and received less food/drink than the menu specified. I sincerely hope this problem is remedied, whether by stocking up on restaurant ware or giving customers notice of this lack before they order.\n\nRegarding food: The smoked salmon sandwich was a rather tasteless, I'd recommend more smoked salmon or capers in it.

If, when we'd left, my grandmother had been smiling and had felt like a Queen (or at least a Lady of Quality!) this would have been a four-star review and the rest of the issues would have been footnotes.   (For the record, my observations on your restroom would have been the same had this been a five star review.  Decor in a shared bathroom is hardly your deal, and doesn't count against you, but I almost always note accessibility issues in my reviews, such as having to maneuver through a crowded tea-room to get there.) \n\nI work in the food service industry.  I've worked in it for almost two decades, at a variety of restaurants ranging from nice sit-down affairs to fast-casual joints.  I know how hard it is to smile and put on your game-face for every table -- but that's the job.  If you can't do it, you shouldn't be working in a restaurant.  Bottom line is that your employees were craptacular at that particular and very important aspect of their job while we were there.  Maybe it was just a bad day, but from several recent reviews I'm seeing here I doubt it.   \n\nI certainly would be willing to visit DarTealing again - the actual tea was incredibly delicious and I'd love to try it again - but I wouldn't do so for any sort of special occasion until I'd reassured myself that your staff had improved dramatically.", "author": "Jess C."}

Of course, I presented the offer as soon as I sat down, but they didn't tell me it wasn't valid for that day until the very end...  \n\nWhile this was very annoying, I was disappointed with everything all throughout.  They say \"6 tea sandwiches\" when they actually mean ONE tiny, dry, sandwich, cut up into 6 pieces.  That's just wrong.\nAnd this being a tea house, you'd think they'd have good tea, but the tea my husband got (I forgot the one) had a very fake, chemically vanilla taste.  It was vile.  I had a green tea that was a very light, green color, and tasted like hot water + some boiled spinach.  But at least it didn't taste like cancer-y chemicals, so that was a plus.\n\nThis place is basically a huge rip-off in every way.  The portions are shockingly tiny, the food is dry (not enough dressing in the salad, the scones are dry, the cookies are dry, etc...).   I have a hard time understanding why this place is still in business.\n\nOh yeah, the waitresses are all basically rude 19 year old girls.  They were anticipating a large birthday party, and ignored us the entire time, while they moved chairs around.  At one point, I (very politely) asked for some custard to spread on my (dry) scone, and the waitress rolled her eyes.  \n\nTea for two + a very light, unsatisfying, snack = $50\nVoucher or not, I don't recommend it.", "author": "Pooja D."}

Maybe I could have a bridal shower or birthday here!\" \n\nI had checked the menu online before coming and thought the tea for two for $43 would be our choice. But upon seating, we realize that everything had to be ordered ahead of time - ok, that's reasonable. So everything was already ordered. The teas were nice, but then the food started coming out. Very awkwardly. The sandwiches came out at different times, making for very awkward passing of tiered plates around the table. And because the sandwiches came out at different times around the table, I didn't get to try most of them, and at times I had to split (an already tiny) sandwich with my partner.  Also, I didn't like that they didn't offer to change our plates, so I felt messy with jam on my plate, and cupcake paper mixed in with it, along with salad dressing remnants. \n\nI also hated how they took the cupcakes and petite fours away to \"pack up\" even though we had just got another round of tea. So halfway through my next cup, I felt like a petit four, but opps, it was no longer there. \n\nTIP: Don't  pack up the left overs until we're ready to leave! Jeez!\n\nAt the end, I had about 5 tiny sandwiches (pretty much the equivalent of 1 whole sandwich) , a tiny cupcake, half a petit four, a scone, and about 5 cups of tea. My partner the same. The bill? $40 a person!! You got to be kidding me. What a complete RIP OFF. I would never subject my friends to shell out $40 for crumbs. \n\nSo final verdict: BAD for large groups.

Once you move past the randomness (and borderline sketchiness) of the location, the tea lounge itself is darling. My friend and I were on the hunt for a spot to host another friend's shower. We'd visited all of the popular tea spots in the city and were moments away from making a final decision. This place was a favorite. The set up is nice and it's just the right balance of shabby chic. They also have a private room available for parties (although the private room is a bit odd in that it seems to be connected to the next door spa/nail salon and has a visible massage or waxing room right next to it). Nevertheless, it seemed perfect for our purposes. We spent $70 ordering a spread of tea so we could check it out for ourselves. Everything was tasty and well presented but this is where the fun ended. \n\nFor starters, there only appeared to be one server in the entire place. While we had no real complaints about our service, I wondered how it would be once the place became more crowded. Would we be able to have our own server if we rented the private room? The server took us through the private room, we decided it would be perfect and the server told us the owner (who is apparently also the lone party planner) would be in momentarily and could answer any other questions we had about it. \"Great,\" we told her, \"please send her over when she arrives and it's convenient--this is definitely where we want to have our friend's shower.\" After repeated requests throughout our tea, however, we were told that the owner was indeed there, but refused to meet with us and would only correspond about it online (Wednesday through Friday, as it says on their website). \"But we'd like to put a deposit down right now and lock in the date while we can, would she just be able to stop by our table for a minute to confirm?\" We were repeatedly told no by our server--even after the woman who appeared to be the owner arrived and glanced at us several times while fielding phone calls from mere feet away. \n\nI understand being busy, but the place was by no means packed at that point and we were there inquiring about booking their private from for up to 25 people and paying whatever it took to do so (for several hours). It was a bizarre approach to customer service and one we decided not to endorse and in turn, wouldn't be giving our business to. If it's this difficult to merely inquire about booking, how tough will it be to actually plan a special party at this place? For the record, the people at both Crown and Crumpet and Lovejoy's were immediately responsive, during far busier tea services. Both places took the time to enthusiastically send someone over to answer questions and provide helpful information, making the prospect of a throwing a shower with them far more appealing. Interestingly enough, the friend I was with is in the advertising business and responsible for massive amounts of party planning (and referrals) in the bay area, so there's no telling how much business was actually lost with this experience...", "author": "J G."}

I was visiting a friend in the city when we decided to go for tea, since we haven't gone in some time.  We wanted something a little more traditional and DarTealing fit the description.  We arrived a tad early and they hadn't opened yet, but it was so close to Yerba Buena and Union Square that we ended up walking around first.\n\nWhen we came back, we didn't have a reservation, but luckily, they seated us promptly.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThis tea room is very fun and whimsical.  I felt like I was in Alice in Wonderland.  The furniture was mismatched, I was in this wooden chair and my friend was in this cute armchair.  The settings were also mismatched which I loved, because it didn't seem strange at all that nothing was the same.  It was also a great conversation starter.\n\nMenu:\nWe ended up choosing the indulgence tea service menu which was $55, decently priced.  Now let me get into the actual food.\n-Sandwiches\n  Turkey & pumpkin butter creme \n        This seasonal delight reminded me of Thanksgiving, both the turkey and pumpkin.  Very tasty.\n  Honeyed ham and Gruyere\n        I love Gruyere so I had to get this.  The honeyed ham was a perfect balance to the cheese.  I liked the \n        sweetness with the naturally creaminess and saltiness of the cheese.\n  English Stilton cheese and fig\n        I think this was by far my favorite.  I have never had Stilton cheese before, as far as I know.  But the \n        sharp taste with the lightness and sweetness of the figs were amazing.  I want to make this for lunch \n        every day.  I honestly could not stop eating these.  I made sure to eat the other sandwiches first so I could \n        save my last bite for this one.\n-Freshly-baked English sausage rolls\n        These little rolls were a great start.  They were very savory surprisingly with less sausage and more rolls.\n-Tea scones with Devon cream\n        I love tea scones and Devon cream.  There are never complaints here.\n-Holiday petits fours and Christmas shortbread cookies\n        I wasn't a huge fan of these compared to everything else I had eaten, but they were still a delight.\n\nTea:\n-Earl de Versailles\n        My friend actually ordered this and I tried it.  It was very fragrant and I normally don't add a lot of milk or \n        sugar to my tea so that I can taste it.  This tea doesn't need much sugar and I think no milk.  The \n        French lavender seems to tone out Earl Grey a bit, which is nice.\n-Her Majesty's Secret Service\n        Honestly, I got this tea because I loved the name.  It is a Ceylon Orange Pekoe with bourbon vanilla.  \n        This tea smells wonderful from the bourbon vanilla and is very light in taste.  I added milk sugar, but \n        it is honestly not necessary.  But tea smelled so sweet that I felt compelled to add sugar so that it \n        tasted just as sweet as it smelled.\n\nI love this place and am already planning to return.

How wonderful to be asked!!  We opted for the table as far from the group as possible (it really didn't help, it is a little place).  \n\nGot there at about 10:40am and were warming welcomed in early by the staff.  It was absolutely adorable inside, similar to Lovejoy's with the mismatched china, but decor similar to Crown and Crumpet, though not nearly so pink.  Comfy chairs, plenty of space for each table to have a bit of elbow room, and two tiny kitchens, one that the food comes out of, the other tea.\n\nThe menu is quite expansive.  We spent a good 20 minutes trying to figure out what tea to have, in the end asking the staff for their recommendations.  They brought out the jars of tea for us to smell and make up our own mind.  We had the Parisian Earl Grey (which was a good earl grey with more vanilla) and Her Majesty's Secret Service (which was divine with the desserts).\n\nThe food was excellent, with the fresh baked, still warm white chocolate lavender scones being our favorite (not to heavy on the lavender, just a good balance to the sweet white chocolate).  My mother ordered the Afternoon Tea Service and I the Taste-tea Service, so that we could try the most things on our first visit.  Sandwiches that were chosen were the Darjeeling Curried Chicken (I thought it could have used a bit more of the chutney, bit overpowering on the curry), Smoked Salmon and Capers (Yum!!  No changes needed and will be ordering that again) and the Brie and Kicky Chutney (Also very good).  The sausage roll was wonderful, with a very flavorful meat in the center of a light, flaky roll.  The plates also came with the most wonderful red velvet shortbread cookies.  Do try the lemon curd as it is home made and very tasty.\n\nThe staff!  I have not had such service in a long time.

Of all the tea places in SF I've visited, DarTealing has the best sandwiches. \n\nThe scones were good and fragrant, but the clotted cream was a bit strange.  Maybe they were variations of the traditional clotted cream but they were a little too sweet. \n\nThe teas were decent.  We had English breakfast, Jasmine Jade and Chai.  If you were a pure tea lover, go to Samovar.  Tea here is good enough to wash down your food, but not something to savor on its own. \n\nThe service was sweet and pleasant.  They did forget our chai but then again, I admit a large party can be a bit of headache to keep track of sometimes. \n\nReservation is recommended: it's a full house on a weekend afternoon, and 3rd street isn't exactly a fun part of town to walk around while waiting for your table, unless your idea of fun is to sit under the freeway and count the cars going by.", "author": "Candice B."}

The perfect little tea house nestled up on the most random street on 3rd/Harrison. My friend and I made a reservation for a 2 for 1 $25 deal on a Friday afternoon (last seating 4:30pm).\n\nWe got our choice of seating and chose two sofa chairs. There was a huge menu selection and I picked the Chai (bottomless, what what!). Also included were three sandwich options (both of us got three full sandwiches, or 6 total). We chose eggs & bacon (sooooooooo good!), fish & chips (sooooooo good!) and apple (sweet, but still good).\n\nTo top it off, it came with a plate of freshly baked warm scones and biscuits/cookies. Needless to say, we ate everything. We had an amazing 1.5 hours catching up in the intimate, cutely decorated setting. Felt like Alice in Wonderland. Great date spot!", "author": "Jeanne C."}

And I was just so thrilled with the place that I dragged my very manly, 6 foot, burly husband to join me one Sunday afternoon for some crumpets and croque monsieur (I have the pictures to prove it).  El Hub isn't even a tea drinker...they DO have beverages for people who don't necessarily drink tea...\n\nAwesome ambiance, great selection of teas (my personal fave is the Creamy Dreamy Earl Grey and the Coconut Rooibos).  I love the decor, the details of all the china pieces.  It's not trying too hard like Crown & Crumpet.  Other tea places in the city are okay, but I am already smitten with this place.  I like how Pauline tweaked her menu, very very different than some of the other tea houses I have been to.  Lots of different sandwiches to choose from!\n\nOne setback is on the last visit, there was a large group of girls (around 10) and they were awfully noisy and then our little private space was invaded...LUCKILY it was at the end of our meal and I can't even deduct a star because I know when I go next time with my group of girls, it may not be the quietest either!", "author": "Meesh K."}

They're very forgiving if you're new to this, since all of their special blends are very customer-friendly. The descriptions are all provided, and even if you don't know much about tea, you can just pick one that sounds good to you. The teas are all very good, too. We came as a group of 4 and were able to select our own pots of tea: Coconut Creme Rooibos, Her Majesty's Secret Service, Apple-a-day, and Something-something dragonwell. There is a wide selection of sandwiches, easily catering to vegetarian tastes, and the flavors are unexpectedly complex and interesting. I would highly recommend the strawberries and creme, which is creme cheese with strawberry jam, a touch of balsamic, and a hint of lavender. Even the salad was surprisingly delicious. The desserts were ok. The scones were good, though, with little British touches like clotted cream and lemon curd. The decor inside is so adorable; my friend now wants a tea parlor in her dream home! \n\nAlso, it's fairly easy to park; there's a small lot near South Park with metered parking. \n\nA couple of points: this place is rather small, can be easy to miss since the exterior is pretty nondescript.

The service and food were adequate, the teas delightful, and the service pleasant but seemingly at a loss to accommodate our large group...\n\nHOWEVER, after my most recent visit to DarTealing Lounge, the only thing keeping me from giving this lovely little spot a 5-star review is the memory of the fact that they didn't know how to handle all the tea pots on the table when I hosted a party here. The food on my second visit was much better than on my first (I suspect because they were hard-pressed to put together all the sandwiches needed for our large party the first time around), the service phenomenal, and I love that the scone and petit fours flavors are always changing. I also love that DarTealing offers lime curd, rather than the standard lemon, and the owner is very sweet, extremely knowledgeable, and very accommodating. I highly recommend the Pinky Minky, Creme de Coconut, and Her Majesty's Secret Service teas, as well as the From Pear to Eternity.\n\nThe verdict:\nCome for an intimate tea for two, and don't forget to buy a tin of your favorite tea to take home, but if you're in a group of more than four, stick to Lovejoy's.", "author": "Elle Q."}

Oh, and you cannot forget the tiny square of opera cake and lemon cake. It is not even a piece of cake, but those tiny square desserts that I am pretty sure were from Trader Joe's petite cake box.

For the $$$$$$ that they charge, they definitely do not provide the service. Do not believe what they advertise, you will not get the le petit minis, nor the macaroons. If you have a deal, expect to get the left overs.\n\nIt was painful to have to pay 18 % tip for horrible horrible place like this.\n\n1 star only because the decor was cute, but otherwise, you can take your $40 to the store and have a FEAST for 2 people.", "author": "Karina A."}

Dartealing remains a lovely spot with excellent food and tea, but all of the new surcharges are ridiculous. The $25 Serendipity is perfect for two, why charge $8 to split? I guess you're \"encouraging\" us to order two of the $15 service which would be too much food and doesn't include scones. $2 to split a giant pot of tea, really?\n\nAlthough a minimum of $30 for lunch is much too high, its more the principle that bothers me.

This place is charming, not overly pink or cluttered.  \n\nWe got the Afternoon Serendipi-Tea for Two.  The tea names are so intriguing.  She got Her Majesty's Secret Service, a black tea with hints of bourbon vanilla.  It was definitely hints of vanilla since we could smell the vanilla but not taste it at all.  I got Casablanca After Midnight, a rooibos tea with mint and mocha, which overwhelmingly tasted like mint.\n\nWe choose three sandwiches: darjeeling curry chicken, smoked salmon and capers, and smoked ham and horse radish cheddar.  The curry chicken was the most unique tea sandwiches we encountered and we voted it our favorite.\n\nThere were also two scones, tea cookies/pastries, and petite fours.  There was a chocolate chip scone, which amazingly, we did not know existed.  We finished the tea desserts happily, feeling satisfied with the whole tea experience.", "author": "Rose C."}

The tea choices are amazing (and delicious) and the food was great. It was a relaxing and enjoyable day, thanks to the ladies at Dartealing.

My friend and I hosted a baby shower for 20 people on Sunday.  The party was a hit!  My mom, my friends and the guest of honor loved it.  We were the first people in there and the staff was very nice and accommodating.  The food, as always was delicious.  I imagine tea sandwiches to be plain and boring but not these!  There are a ton of menu items to choose from.  Even their scones are flavored (I think ours were lavender).  They let us bring champagne for a corkage fee and they had wonderful glassware for us to use.  The tea varieties were stellar.  We chose Royal Earl Grey, Paper Lantern, Apple A Day and Last Mango in Paris.  The sandwich flavors we chose were Curried Chicken, Brie and Chutney (crowd favorite), Bacon & Egg and Roasted Red Pepper and Hummus.  In the past I have had their Asian Chicken Salad, Chicken Pesto Brie Tartine, sausage roll and cream puffs which are all tasty.  I have not had their Croque Monsieur or Madame but I am sure they are wonderful.  In addition to the food, the decor is great...so many details, just like their nail salon, Polished Lounge which is next door.  Both these businesses are some of my favorite in SOMA.  \n\nLastly, a note about the wonderful owner Pauline.  I loved working with her...she was very professional, easy going and nice.  She was responsive to my emails, always answering my questions and assisting with anything that I needed.  I noticed there were some negative reviews about her not responding to emails in a timely matter, however her email signature states that all communications regarding events are done from Wednesday through Friday.  Saturdays and Sundays are dedicated to events management and that they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.  This may be the case for some people feeling like she was not responsive to emails.  I can vouch that this is not the case, she certainly responded to my emails within a few days and I am very happy with my experience and will definitely recommend Dartealing to others for an event, lunch, or even just a leisurely afternoon tea.", "author": "Lily M."}

We went at 11 and were starving a few hours later so we ended up going to dinner at 5pm because we were that starved.\n\nThe place was cutely set up, and that's kind of the only thing it going for it.\n\nHere are my complaints:\n\nFirst, the lady seemed annoyed that we even had a deal. I don't understand that, if you get so grumpy when people have deals why do you even offer them in the first place? They served us and tried to be pleasant but it was obvious that they weren't happy. \n\nSecond, no milk or cubed sugar. I know this sounds particular but it's afternoon tea, cubed sugar is part of it. They also don't have clotted cream, it tasted like whipped cream cheese. Clotted cream is standard, generally so not sure why they cheaped out.\n\nThe portions are tiny. We were starving a few hours later and this has never happened to me at any of the other tea places I've been to and I've been to quite a few.\n\nThey're a little lazy with sandwiches because they could have cut off the crust but clearly didn't on some of the sandwiches. We had curried chicken, smoked salmon, and the ham sandwiches. They were only okay.\n\nThe scone is TINY. It's a third of the size of normal scones, and the baked goods they attach are store bought. You can definitely taste the preservatives. I had one petite four, mini cookie, tiny cream puff. Also most places give you much more bang for your buck.\n\nFinally, THEY CHARGED A FORCED GRATUITY OF 18% FOR TWO PEOPLE. TWO PEOPLE?!!? They didn't even service us for the most part. \n\n\nSo, needless to say I'm never coming back here and advising everyone else I know not to come here. It's not in the least worth the money. If you want something around the same price just go to lovejoy's in noe valley and if you want amazing tea time go to The Fairmont. This place is not worth the cost.", "author": "Lilly K."}

Charming little place with adorable mismatched teacups, teapots, and saucers. The decor was adorable, but not over the top frilly or like-your-grandmothers-house. The restaurant was on the small side, so if you happen to come on a busy day it can get pretty loud in there. Reservations typically last about an hour and a half, but they were a bit slow in bringing out the food so we stayed a little longer. \n\nWe picked the $25 tea service, which came with unlimited tea, 8 sandwiches, salad, scone, and petit four. Curried chicken, cucumber,and  salmon were a few of my favorite sandwiches. Yum!!! Salad was ehh, no wow factor. Scone was pretty amazing, but sadly I was so full by then I only managed to finish half. I was looking forward to the sweets at the end, but the petit four was SO sweet I only managed a nibble. \n\nOverall, it is a bit expensive for what it is...but you are paying for the cute girly experience. Service was not the quickest, as there was only one server. Metered parking was plentiful and the allotted hour and a half is more than enough time for a small party. Do keep in mind that if you've confirmed your headcount with them, you cannot cancel any of your guests. A bit aggravating, but completely understandable for such a small establishment. The owner Pauline was nice enough to lower the tea services to $19 each for those who did not show up to our party. Definitely a great place to celebrate something special.

Coming from the perspective of having had a lot of supposedly 'authentic' tea lounge experiences, i can tell you that my mother and I loved this place. We got a bloomspot for two and got the cucumber, mediterranean, and turkey sandwiches. I loved the turkey and my mom love the cucumber, but the mediterranean wasn't that great. BUT the tea was amazing. My mother had mint lavender and i had the SoMa tea. They were both fantastic. We were both really full for dessert but the dessert was really good as well, especially the crumpets. \n\nIn response to some of the yelpers who had negative reviews about this place, I feel that they have nothing to compare this tea lounge to. Go to any other comparable tea lounge in sf or better yet, in london, and you won't be complaining about service. Side note: service in london is notoriously horrendous so if you want an authentic tea experience, the worse the service, the more authentic :). But perhaps we weren't so picky about the service here because we have had some really really bad tea experiences \n\nAdditionally there were a couple of ladies near us with a bloomspot as well who began harassing the wait staff about the gratuity that had to be paid. First if all u miserable chepos who feel that you can demean people because YOU didn't read the rules of the coupon....NEVER BUY A BLOOMSPOT AGAIN YOU MORONS. You ladies who spent about 10 minutes telling the staff how they were \"punishing\" them by asking them to pay gratuity are disgusting.

Goat cheese and sundried tomatoes is really strong in flavor so if you're not a fan of super strong or potent cheese, this might not be for you. \n\nTheir scones are really good--not overly sweet and just the right amount of moistness. \n\nOne of the highlights was their bread pudding.

And even though we were the last customers and were talking and sipping tea for 45 minutes after closing time, they did not rush us, and not only that, service was excellent from beginning to finish.", "author": "Loraine T."}

We got here, we were the only people there. The service was horrible. There was a younger girl working the room and she was busy the entire time, on her iphone. She never came by to refill drinks, she never came by to check on us. We had to go up to interrupt her netsurfing so we could get water and the bill. \n\nI was originally excited because the place was decorated very spaciously. However, the food took a while to come out. For sandwiches, I wonder if they had to go make the ingredients from scratch every time a customer orders. Otherwise, why would it take so long? It's not like the stuff is cooked? The place was totally empty with one other table besides us.\n\nI ordered coffee instead of tea because I'm not a tea drinker. Yes, I realize it's a tea place. The coffee was watery and had no taste. The scones were not very fluffy and tasted very bland.\n\nFor the price we had to pay, go to Lovejoy's. I was thoroughly disappointed here after having gone to Lovejoy's so many times. They have much faster service, much better food (and their coffee is AWESOME for coffee drinkers), friendlier staff. The staff is always whipping between tables with teapots checking on folks.  I'm STILL hungry after paying $25 for myself. Will not be back here again.", "author": "Elena R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-11-16", "description": "This is a warning to anyone using a Bloomspot or other similar service: they will do their best not to honor your deal.\n\nThis place looked cute so I wanted to try it and bought a Bloomspot deal for it. I called a week before my Bloomspot deal's expiration date to book a reservation and was told that they were booked for the day I wanted to go. I let them know my availability and was told that they might have a slot available and would let me know. The girl who answered the phone - she said her name was Ashley - was extremely rude and disrespectful.\n\nThey did not call back. I eventually called again during their working hours and there was no answer. When I finally got a hold of them, the girl rudely told me that I needed to check the website and figure out when they were open, even though I had called during their operating hours.\n\nShe then told me they had me down for 4:30 on Thursday, having randomly assigned me to someone's canceled slot without bothering to confirm it with me. When I told her I would not be able to make it to such a random time on such short notice, she said, \"So you want to cancel?\" as though I had reserved that spot to begin with.\n\nAfter that point (a little over a week after I first began trying to make my reservation) my coupon expired. Ultimately this was not my fault, as there was no mention that I had to call a month in advance to make a reservation. I tried rescheduling but was told that they could not honor my coupon as it had expired, although I had been pursuing a reservation for a week before its expiration date.\n\nAfter insisting that I would complain, Ashley told me that they would provide services to me for the value that I paid for the coupon ($26) but not provide the actual service that I bought ($46 value).\n\nI went online to see if I'd had an isolated experience, but found that almost all of the other Bloomspot users had similarly terrible experiences with this place. I don't want anyone else to fall privy to their shadiness, as I wouldn't be surprised if they did not even provide the full service to everyone who purchased a deal, doling out smaller portions along with their surliness.\n\nIf the owner of this establishment is reading this: I would advise you not to have anyone like Ashley on your staff. Even if I had been able to use my deal, her demeanor over the phone when I was trying to make a simple reservation was unpleasant, unprofessional, and a turn-off for any customer.", "author": "Rachel L."}

A group of us booked a table to celebrate a major milestone in our friend's life - her new baby due in just 2 weeks!  And we met up at Dartealing for tea and then next door for pedicures.  \n\nUnfortunately, what started out as a 3 to 4 star experience ended very badly.   One of our friends booked the table.   She later called (the morning of the tea) to let them know that one of the group had an emergency and could not make it.  She also mentioned it as we were being seated.  The waitress took away the tea service and did not comment on it.  \nWe enjoyed the tea, sandwiches and scones, and generally it was a nice atmosphere.  The egg salad was not very good (avoid!), but the curry chicken and shrimp salad were excellent (definitely order!).  The tea was good, though it was strange that they just kept allowing it to steep and steep which ended up making some of it quite strong.  Also the water got cold quickly, but I am not sure there is any way for them to prevent that.  The scones were excellent (order!) and the key line curd was quite a good addition.  Together, they were a bit over sweet (scones are usually less sweet, I think).   The cr\u00e8me puffs were good but the petit fours tasted odd (avoid!).  All in all, a pretty good experience though the food was a bit hit or miss.  \n\nI wish the meal ended then because I would be writing a 3 or 4 star review of this place.  When the check came, the waitress included the price of the meal for our friend who did not come.  My friend who set the reservations said that we had mentioned on the way in and also left a message that morning she would not arrive.  So the waitress went to get the owner, Pauline.  The owner said that her policy was that we had to notify her 48 hours in advance of cancellations.  My friend who set it up said that there was no policy in the email.  So the owner left to check.  When she came back, the owner said, \"You are right.  I forgot to include the policy in the email, but we served you the food anyways.   And you ate it all so you should pay for it.\"  Perhaps she did not notice the two boxes of leftovers 5 or 6 sandwiches plus a scone, 3 petit fours, and most of the shortbread was leftover!   We were appalled at her attitude and tone for something which was HER mistake.  Half of the group wanted to argue, but two in the party (including the guest of honor) were concerned about the scene we would end up creating so in the end we paid and left to make our pedicure appointments next door (also owned by Pauline).  \n\nTwo comments about Dartealing:\n- It was a mistake on the owner's part and *she admitted it*!  And then she proceeded to *insult us*!   If she had said, \"Hey this is an honest mistake on my part, but I am a small business owner, can you please pay for the final portion?  I will not charge you gratuity for it since she was not here\", we would have paid and left happy.   Instead she insulted us for her own mistake.  Was $25 + $5 gratuity worth insulting your customers including the guest of honor who is due in 2 weeks?  I think not.  \n- The cream puffs were good.  They had a lavender glaze on it which was a bitdifferent.  Alas, it was too good to be true.  There was a box just outside their back door (on the way to the bathroom) for cream puffs called \"Belgium Minis\" - I guess they are not homemade and just added some glaze to it. :(  They should not pass it off as if it is homemade if it comes out of a box that looks like it came from Costco.  The thing was that the difference between the $19 and $25 menu was the cr\u00e8me puffs (good, but store bought) and petit fours (not good).  So save your money and buy some from the store instead of adding the extra $6 to your meal.  \n\nAll in all, this left a bad taste in our mouths.  None of us would recommend Dartealing given the insulting owner and complete unprofessionalism.  Next time we will try Samavor which is down the street.  The husband of someone in our group went there during our tea time and raved about it.  Since we found Dartealing on Yelp, I wanted to warn our fellow Yelpers about this bad experience.  Go to Dartealing at your own risk and hope that there is no dispute on the bill.", "author": "May L."}

I had the Serendipitea for Two with 3 sandwich choices (smoked salmon, brie & chutney and curried chicken - in order of preference) - all were delicious.  The tea also comes with a salad, which I've never seen before, but it was fresh and good too.  I wish there had been more pastries (we each had a scone, a small biscuit/wafer, a petit four and a mini-eclair), but what we got was delicious (and probably for the best since we were stuffed by the end). The tea choices seemed overwhelming, but we were both very satisfied with our rooibos options.  I would definitely go again!", "author": "B. Y."}

If my friends weren't married already, I would throw them a party there! \n\nFood: Excellent! The sandwiches, salad, petit fors and cookies are all delicious! All other high teas I have gone to are mediocre but theirs was really delicious! And the scones were to die for! The texture was perfect--not dry at all. Crunchy crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. They provide devonshire creme and jams but you really don't need to put anything on them. \n\nTea: Many assortments to choose from. Almost overwhelming because there's such a wide selection but it's fun to look over and make a selection with friends. \n\nService: Very friendly! The first time I went, I went with my mom and baby. I know it was risky to take a baby but I wanted to check this place out. I happened to go at the right time because there wasn't too many people there. We ended up staying for 2+ hours because my baby fell asleep half way through and that gave me and my mom time to enjoy the tea. The staff never once made us feel rushed or annoyed that we had brought a baby. They were very sincere and down to earth. Some tea houses I've been to before give off a snotty attitude but this place was not anything like that all. I had a chance to talk to the owner and she explained she did this because it was something she enjoyed and loved growing up. I truly feel her passion shows in her work. \n(On my second trip there with other Friends who also had babies), the staff was just as nice--even after one of the kids broke one of their china!!! Again, the staff were really kind and never once did they make us feel unwanted for bringing in small children. \n\nso in a nut shell, what I feel is noteworthy: \nFood: A+ \nService: A+ \nLocation: A/B \nAtmosphere: A+ \nParking: Street parking \nPricing: $$ \nBathroom: CLEAN! \nWill I go again, YES! \nRecommend: Baby Shower, engagement party, afternoon party/meeting, girls' day out, birthday party", "author": "Yumi O."}

I had to ask them to give me a fresh bag because it wasn't steeping well.  I wonder how many times they would have reused it. It's bottomless tea, I would think they would always steep from new leaves. Also, I didn't like that it was in a bag, I like my loose-leaf tea loose. I think the tea steeps better that way.\nThe tea itself was delicious. I had a Roobius Coconut Biscuit or some other cookie name on the end. I had it with soymilk. It tasted like English tea cookies. The tea selection was  great! The sandwiches on the other hand were not. The curry chicken was very good, but the other three: turkey, salmon and cucumber were not that tasty. Lovejoy's has a much better selection of tea sandwiches and are always super delicious. I also thought it was a bit pricey for what we got. My scones were delicious but tiny.   \nI would definitely go back for the tea, but not the food.", "author": "Stacya G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-18", "description": "DarTealing is by far the best tearoom in the Bay Area and you get alot for your money from the bottomless tea, tea sandwiches, salad, scones, petit fours, and tea cookies. Unlike other tearooms that leave you hungry and frankly, feeling a little ripped off, DarTealing offers the perfect full meal at a great value. \n\nThere is so much to love about DarTealing it's hard to know where to begin so let's break it down:\n\nThe Food \nIf you're a foodie like I am, this place will not disappoint. Having been here at least a half a dozen times, I can honestly say that I've tried every single sandwich and they are all fantastic. It is so easy to get carried away with these scrumptuous sandwiches that you may find yourself eating an equivalent to half a loaf of bread, as I have done on many occasions. They have an extensive selection of sandwiches but not all are offered at once which is okay because you will want to come back often. They have the traditonals (smoked salmon, cucumber, etc.) and the whimsical curveballs (fish 'n' chips).  If you do manage to pry yourself away from the tea sandwiches, you should absolutely try the croque monsieur which is perfectly cooked (not soggy or too rich) and any of their entree salads. \n\nThe Sweets \nI do not exaggerate when I say that their scones are the best I've ever tasted in any shop or bakery. They are light and fluffy with the right amount of moistness and oh-so buttery that they practically melt in your mouth. I could eat these baked mounds of heaven every single day of my existence. My favorite is the strawberry flavor but there are other non-traditional options like apple bacon and white chocolate lavender. \n\nThe Tea \nEqually matched to their large sandwich selection is their teas which come in many delicious flavors. If you want a bit of a jolt try their caffeinated Dreamy Earl Grey or Kyoto Cherry Rose. Personally, I could consume gallons of their decaf Coconut Custard and Creme Caramel.\n\nThe Service \nThe waitstaff is friendly and eager to please. They can help guide you through the extensive menu and make very helpful suggestions on food pairings.  \n\nThe Decor \nI have been here with girlfriends and manfriends and the decor is inviting to both sexes. The cool interior colors, antique furniture,  artfully decorated walls, and hodge podge accessories create a wonderfully calm ambiance that only adds to the delightful meal. \n\nFinally, you can wear off the inevitable food coma by hopping next door to Polished Lounge and getting a mani-pedi to complete your total body pampering.  What's there not to love?", "author": "Kim N."}

We were all exasperated by 2:00 when we were finally seated.  2:15 rolled around and nobody had said hi and no sign of tea or anything else.  We actually had to flag down one of the servers to request service.  The epitome of lousy service arrived at our table and actually said this: \"I heard you ladies would like to order\" No hello, no sorry for the wait, nothing!  My niece couldn't let that go and told her she was rude.  She rolled her eyes.  We finally got some tea at 2:25.  Then she scolded us for having commandeered one of their \"regular\" menus (it was laying on the table) instead of their special holiday menu.  Finally got our sandwiches, etc. but not anything I would describe as exceptional.  This place needs SUPERVISION, a HOSTESS, a MANAGER on duty.

I'm here at least once a week (sometimes twice when I can escape from work) for lunch and it's my boyfriend's new fav. brunch place. First, there's the amazing selection of tea. I've tried most of them but keep going back to a few favorites--Coconut Roobois, Tuscany Pear, Ginger green tea....actually they're all good so you can't go wrong. Next, there's the food. Oh my goodness the FOOD is incredible! Pauline (the owner) knows how to whip up an amazing Asian chicken salad and definitely the best croque monsieur ever. I don't know what she puts in those little sandwiches but I can't stop eating them (they look small but don't be deceived--they're super filling)--I've tried almost all of them and each one is better than the next. The side salad is always fresh and organic. And then when you think you can't eat anymore, they bring out a tray of strawberry scones with clotted cream (YUM!!), jam, and lemon custard---so surely you must devour these. A bit more tea please and then of course, dessert--petit fours, tea cookies, mini eclairs dusted with chocolate....Ahhh...Did I mention the adorable decor? Makes you feel like you've stepped back in time into an English tearoom from a Jane Austen novel. Then when the last drop of tea is done, it's time to head over to Polished Lounge next door and take a little snooze while getting your nails done.
