Also known as David's Bakery - Patisserie - please put this place on your list.\n\nWhen Mr. E came back to the hotel, he was raving about what he'd seen in the window at David's. We went there the next day and were not disappointed. I wanted to find David and slap him! (that's a good thing, btw)  I got the aptly named \"Chocolate Decadence\", and Mr. E had the \"7 layers Marzipan\" - both are indescribable. The language is inadequate - or my English hasn't reached the heights where I can do justice to the 6th dimension of flavor to which these delectable treats transported us.\n\nI was able to think before I took my first bite, and captured \"Chocolate Decadence\" before I devoured it (with no shame).

And SF is not a cheap place to run a restaurant, especially when you're in Union Square and near all the hotels and theaters. So for anyone who wrote a review about the decor being shabby or the prices absurd...I challenge you to find another diner in SF that doesn't have the same woes (Mel's food isn't better and is even more overpriced!).\n\nAnd they have beer here, Stella draft, which I haven't found in many diners period. And Dr. Brown's Soda.\n\nFood was good. It didn't knock our socks off, but it was pretty much what I'd expect from a diner. I also think you have to stick to Jewish fare if you come here. My Reuben sando was stacked full of moist pastrami on perfectly crisped rye. And the bread wasn't soggy by the time it got to me because they gave me a bottle of thousand island dressing to add --- bonus points for letting me pick my own sauce level. My boyfriend has the shakshuka which we often make at home. It was peppery, both in sauce and with extra chunks of peppers, which he enjoyed.\n\nService was also quick and efficient. Lots of elderly ladies who come here to read books, so it was a quiet crowd. Ideal when you came in with less than 4 hours of sleep like us.\n\nMy only complaint was that my side of cole slaw was way too small when my boyfriends extra side of potato salad was huge. \n\nWe left satisfied overall, though - it's what I expected.

Not. I should have heeded my intuition when we walked in at 12:30 and the place was almost empty. \n\nTo be fair, my husband was pleased with his pastrami on rye. I, on the other hand, was less than thrilled with my meal. I ordered scrambled eggs with lox and onions and challah toast. The eggs I got were tasty, but what I got wasn't lox. It was smoked salmon. I know. Lox is smoked salmon. But there's a lot of ways to smoke salmon. This was like a big, heavily smoked salmon fillet cut into hunks. It just kind of hung out with the eggs. Lox is pink and thinly sliced and mixes in with eggs. \n\nThe challah toast was questionable as well. It was yellow bread but it was two perfectly uniform slices shaped just like white bread . . . not exactly challah, kind of challah-like bread.The whole meal was edible but totally inauthentic, like nobody associated with the restaurant had ever eaten at an actual Jewish deli.\n\nAnd speaking of Jewish, the place says that all its breads are kosher. That means they don't make them there, whatever the menu says. Also, anything coming in kosher isn't kosher the minute it is opened there, because the place isn't kosher at all. Maybe no big deal but it struck me as a little bit disingenuous. I guess you can fool people who've never been to a Jewish style deli or an actual kosher deli, but the whole experience was a little disappointing.\n\nI would add that the service was slow (a half hour wait from the time we sat down to the time we ate), a little offhand (oh sorry, I forgot you ordered tea), and not at all welcoming.

It wasn't until after we left that I saw it got 1 1/2 stars, it deserves far less.\n\nIt wasn't very busy for a Sunday morning yet it still took a long time to get our food.  When we did get our food it wasn't even hot!  My scrambled eggs were brown and WAY OVERCOOKED, my friends eggs were basically raw, our toast was hardly even toasted and the coffee was terrible.  I nearly fell over when we got the bill, $58 for 3 horrific meals!!!  I can't even believe this place is in business.

We entered about 7pm and just a few customers, I had forgotten how big this place is.  We had the chicken broth with noodle, leg of chicken (1/4 chicken baked) and I had the Reuben.  It's all real food, not the Sysco Datto MSG crap so often found in American restaurants .  My wife was raised in ROMA Italy and wiill get sick about ever third time we go out to eat in the US because of our \"better living thru chemistry\" approach to food.  But here she felt great.  The soup was bland but real, and fresh, a simple base, not over salted, very enjoyable.  The baked chicken 1/4 was excellent, my reuben was real corned beef, not the colored chemical fair injected with datto/MSG from Sysco which is sold everywhere.  What a treat, a normal meal, at a fair price.  Service is like Europe, sorta happens when it happens so relax and enjoy the ride.", "author": "Gage H."}

They had an old-school deli menu, though, so we decided to get a pastrami sandwich on rye, to share.\n\nHonestly, I didn't think the sandwich was that bad. The flavor was definitely in the meat, it wasn't dried out, and the bread was a nice touch. The potato side salad was pretty dismal, though, barely touched it. I think the greasy feeling that set in after a few bites of the sandwich, that lasted for hours after, is what turned me off the most. It felt like the oils from the meat were all around me, and it wasn't a very pleasant feeling.\n\nYou pay up front, not where you ate, but there's only one person who mans both the entire counter and the register, so it can be a bit of a wait to leave if there are other diners in.\n\nIf you're in a bind, and for some reason NEED a deli sandwich, this place can help you out, but I wouldn't seek this place out specifically.\n\nAlso, they apparently close at 2 pm on Mondays, which I found a little odd.", "author": "Claire S."}

No vegetables, just noodles at the bottom of the container, and a bunch of pulled chicken that didn't look all that appetizing. I could barely eat 1/4 of it.\n\n#3. The grilled cheese sandwich was barely grilled on the outside. Not much butter on the bread. The cheese while EXTREMELY generous, was too generous. No one needs 7 slices of cheddar cheese on their grilled cheese sandwich. A slice of cheddar, maybe an Emmentaler, and one other would surely suffice. Again, literally inedible. \n\nI couldn't be more disappointed in a restaurant in the heart of Union Square. What a waste of good property.

The Pavlovian response kicks in and all of a sudden I wanted chopped chicken liver with schmaltz, lox with cream cheese on a toasted bagel, matzoh ball soup, pickles and three or four egg cream sodies.  \n\nTo start...\n\nBut a When Harry Met Sally story, this is not.\n\nAny schmuck knows It takes but three ingredients to make an egg cream soda:  seltzer water, milk and chocolate syrup.  That is my second-place beverage vice, behind Japanese Milk Tea.  Is it so much to ask for to ask of any restaurant, these three things?\n\nApparently, it is.  \n\nThis was my first of many mistakes here - my tuchis should have been outta that seat and back on the street.  It's been years since I've eaten here, and I don't remember kvetching about it at all.  \n\nThe Cadet ordered Hungarian Goulash,  I had a bite.  Feh-lacid (egg?) noodles with beef and bell peppers in unmenschionable sauce that lacked even a hint of paprika, which is a mortal sin. Side of bread, which he buttered copiously,  and a Dr. Brown's  black cherry soda.  \n\nI  followed suit with the beverage, side of pickles and chose a \"Deluxe\" Sandwich, the classic Corned Beef on... You're out of Rye?  \n\nChallah...!\n\nEven a shiksa like me knows you should never run out of rye.   The pickles were an abomination and my coleslaw was completely anemic, lacking any tanginess at all.  \n\nThe sandwich fell flat - I have no idea where they get their fatty, pre-sliced product, but it's awful.  I managed to consume a quarter of the pitiful offering and considered it a mitzvah, as our server seemed to know how bad things were.  He made an earnest effort, so I didn't skimp on the tip.  \n\nIt's amazing how much a hungry Cadet can eat, because he was willing to down the remaining 3/4 of my sandwich.  Under normal circumstances when I am confronted with abysmal food, I will simply pay my check, leave the entree and make a polite exit.  Usually, forever.  Or, I will order another full entree and ignore the first one.\n\nI observed the other patrons at the counter, listened to the patter of the kitchen staff, and noted who appeared to be responsible for this horrendous offense of a meal.  They are charging authentic New York Deli prices for free-lunch cafeteria food.  \n\nGoy vey.", "author": "Kim D."}

Sure, I've done the whole white linen fancy pants dinners here in the city, but sometimes hitting a casual joint is right up my alley.

Formica laminate tops.  Vinyl seats that swivel.  A step up to the counter.

I've been craving meat lately (no surprise there given my cravings for a big beef steak) so I elected the hot Corned Beef Sandwich on Rye.  My friend had the salami sandwich.  \n\nOkay.  So I've been to delis in New York and had to pay through the nose for my 6-inch corned beef/pastrami affair of  love ($22) for a sandwich.  Half-price on the West coast.  Cut that 6-inch to 3-inch.  Stupid healthwit Californians  :p  My sandwich came out thick, juicy and steaming.  Accompanied by a half scoop of potato salad and a pickle spear.  Not a bad sandwich.  I asked for a side of mayo and proceeded to accessorize with the spicy sweet mustard.  This smoothed the dish and I ate the entire thing.\n\nMy friends Salami sandwich was pretty thick with good slices of salami.  I could only imagine how rich that thing must have tasted.  During this process of mastication, we were initially the only customers.  Soon, a bunch of men started to take up seats around the counter. \n\nI like this atmosphere.  Old school.  Waitress leaves you alone but always around to ensure the coffee was kept level for the tourist at the end poring over a map of SF.  Total tab was around $20+ but what does one expect when so close to Union Square.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-12-19", "description": "I'm a bit ambivalent about posting a 2-star review for David's because they saved my bacon on a chilly November night with hungry children who were denied balloon animals at the Union Square tree lighting.  Hell hath no fury like two little girls who were told to get out of the line for balloon animals.  And I love delis in general, so it bothers me to slam one.  But for a variety of reasons, I think most people would be better served spending their money elsewhere.\n\nFood:\nI ordered the chicken liver sandwich with fries and an Anchor Steam; lots of chopped chicken liver on toasted white bread.  Not bad, but should have specified rye bread.  The missus had a reuben with fries and a Blue Moon.  Both the sandwich and the beer disappeared quickly, but she commented that \"it's a good thing I'm hungry because otherwise I might not order this.\"  Ordered a bagel with cream cheese and a side of bacon for the 3-year-old.  The bagel that was served was poppyseed (oh no!  possible meltdown imminent!) and the 6-year-old wanted a grilled cheese with fries (do 6-year-olds ever eat much else?!). Kids ate their meals quickly given the promise of \"anything from the dessert case.\" \nDessert items looked great; we ordered a coconut macaroon, a slice of chocolate layer cake, and a slice of 7-layer marzipan cake.  Marzipan cake was a home run; the other items didn't dazzle. Kids chose black-and-white cookies and seemed content. Dessert items seemed pretty expensive to me, too.\n\nService:\nOne server was managing the dining room as well as the U-shaped diner space.  He was definitely hustling, and that was much appreciated.  The food did not take long to arrive, which was paramount at the time, so during our experience, I have to say the service was the best part. It was a little weird that the bagel my 3-year-old got was poppyseed; I guess we just assumed it would be a plain bagel, but were not asked our preference.  I also wasn't asked about the type of bread for my sandwich, and until it arrived I didn't realize that.  Not terrible, just weird.\n\nVibe:\n\"Worn out deli/diner\" vibe.  In an almost depressing way.  You halfway expect some old guys reading the paper and smoking cigarettes at their usual stool in the diner, but instead I only saw a Persian (?) guy playing a game on his iphone behind the counter separating the dining room from the diner. It's too bad, because this seems like a cool space that could be excellent.  And maybe not so long ago it was just that.\n\nFamily-friendly:\nYes.  Lots of menu items kids can eat, and they can make as much noise/mess as they want.\n\nSummary:\nThis seems like a place whose best days are behind it.  The food is not bad, but not great.  Maybe new ownership would revitalize and lift it up again.  It is fair to say I probably won't be back.", "author": "Aneesh B."}

(the extra R is for emphasis)\n\nToday I was craving some matzo ball soup and a nice pastrami sandwich - like the ones I used to enjoy at Katz's Deli in NYC. Jewish deli's are few and far between in San Francisco so we went to the closest one downtown.  Unfortunately, it's in Union Square and even more unfortunately, it was absolutely, horrendously, stupidly awful and wayyyyy overpriced. \n\nWe ordered a small matzo ball soup, pastrami on rye and corned beef with salami and rye - to go.  The matzo ball soup was just a spoonful of broth and a matzo, no noodles or carrots or any other goodness that's usually found in matzo ball soup.  Those couple of mediocre bites cost us $9.95. But that was the least of our concerns.  The sandwiches were the biggest joke I've ever experienced, even more than Tyra Banks' singing career.  Neither of them had any condiments whatsoever, it was just fatty pieces of meat between thin dry slices of bread; after removing all the fat, only half the meat was left. The crapastrami sandwich was $11.95, about $10.95 more than what it was worth. And the \"corned beef and salami\" turned out to be just corned beef; they even had the audacity to charge $16.95 for that piece of dog poo! \n\nJust when we thought it couldn't get any worse, the granny with the bad attitude at the register barked at us when we mentioned the highway-robbery prices, \"didn't you see the price on the menu?\" There were no prices on the sandwich board behind the counter from where we ordered, you ninny! \n\nDO NOT EVER EVER EVER GO HERE.  You will feel like a big sucker like we do right now.  They give all Jewish delis a bad name.  This is the problem when businesses are used to catering to tourists that will never come back anyway, they don't need to even try to be good.

Something terrible must have happened...\n\nAnd sadly it did.  I came with a group of friends for dinner at Katana-ya.  As we were walking there we couldn't help but notice the gorgeous looking display of decadent desserts in the window.  Katana-ya had a wait list, and so we decided to come back here for some dessert before dinner while we waited our turn.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nThere was a very bored, curt, almost rude woman behind the dessert counter.  She told us to go sit down and we would have the desserts explained to us.  After she had delivered her little monologue, she seemingly decided she'd had enough of us and turned her back.  My friends and I went and settled in at the stools next to the counter.  It was an awkward situation because we were pretty much being ignored by both the lady behind the counter and the lone waitress.  Finally a man lumbered out to help us.  He brought a tray filled with desserts out and then proceeded to try and recite the items to us (his recitation sadly had only a small degree of success).  We should have been tipped off at this point, but all the desserts just LOOKED so scrumptious that we went ahead and bought some.  \n\nPrices were fairly hefty.  Most items were around $8 for dine in.  We wanted our things to-go so that we could wait at Katana-ya for our table, and that ended up knocking the price down by at least half.

I'm a creature of habit, it seems, which is sad, and yet, I keep doing it. \n\nAbout ten years ago, I stayed at a hotel up the street from David's Delicatessen and basically haunted the busy deli for several meals, mostly for the delicious pea soup, amazing mocha cakes (think adult Ho-Ho's) and fantastic bread. I always meant to return, but life gets in the way, and hadn't until two years ago, when we went for a severely dismal breakfast -- and expensive! I apologized to my guests, who were trusting me to make restaurant suggestions on their first trip to the city. I didn't know what happened! Must have been an off day, I said in apology, because this place is normally amazing. Then I went back a year ago and had another \"off day\", forgetting about how bad our breakfast had been the previous year. Apparently it takes a year to forget a bad experience, because last week I found myself walking down Geary Street, hungry, and saw David's and thought \"Hey, that place is really good!\" \n\nYes, I'm a bit stupid.\n\nIt's bad, you guys. It's so bad. The meatloaf was reheated and grey, the mashed potatoes had a hair in them and the veggie accompaniment was so overcooked that the broccoli had turned to grey green mush puddles. The challah bread, supposedly freshly made every day, was at least a week old, or had been left in front of a fan to expedite the staleness factor. Also, as other Yelpers have said, I got a glass that had someone else's lip prints on it. This suggests that the dishwasher at David's isn't using hot water to melt the waxes in lipgloss, which has more terrifying implications than just a gross lip print. It was like I had wandered into a \"Waiter there's a fly in my soup\" joke.\n\nDon't do it, guys.

He was attentive enough, but didn't seem to understand my initial order of corned beef and potatoes, an item on the breakfast menu. He was convinced I wanted to order the corned beef hash, and after a long day of airports and homeless people, I gave in after two attempts at correcting him.\n\nThe menu is pretty expansive for what we took to be a hole-in-the-wall diner and our meal started out well. I was pretty excited to order some cream soda (I hadn't had any in at least five years) and my boyfriend got Russian cabbage soup. The soup was pretty amazing. It tasted a little like sweet minestrone and had lots of vegetables. I had high hopes for the main course, but I was let down pretty badly with my corned beef hash.\n\nThe corned beef hash was covered by three poached eggs, which were the only thing that made the meal at all palatable. The corned beef hash was mostly just finely-chopped fat and had the mildly offensive taste of old, congealed grease. The accompanying hash browns were almost as greasy and completely flavorless. I had to utilize a ton of hot sauce to make it through half the meal. Luckily, it came with a toasted bagel so I was able to fill up on that.\n\nMy boyfriend got a corned beef sandwich (we must have really been craving corned beef that day) which turned out to be pretty good.

Bad food (you know how they describe food as cooked with love -- this was cooked with disdain), awful service, dreary environment. I'm not sure how this place stays in business.\n\nIn detail: Ended up here for Sunday brunch here with my husband and in-laws after two other venues we tried were either too crowded or didn't have eat-in options. My mother-in-law is fond of delis, how bad could a deli be? We were seated in a smallish side room, the waitress was somewhat slow to take our order, but so far nothing alarming. The room was frigid, uncomfortably so, but again I would overlook this otherwise. A few other tables were seated after us as we waited for our food. And waited...after about 30-40 minutes of waiting and watching other tables who were seated after us get their food, we inquired with our waitress. She told us that what we ordered takes awhile, apparently the corned beef hash was slowing the whole order down. Our food finally arrived...I had eggs with onions, with a side of fruit. It was the most pathetic plate of food I had ever seen...my eggs were cold, there were 4 or 5 chunks of fruit thrown on the plate. The \"special\" corned beef hash was old, dried corned beef cut up and mixed with mashed potatoes. The blintzes were clearly defrosted and topped with disgusting, processed blueberry sludge. There were no apologies for the massive delay in the food. When we left, my father in law (who is the most gentle and generous guy), went up to pay and said this was the most memorably horrible meal he has ever had. The cashier took his money and handed him the receipt. The whole experience was kind of worth it because as we were waiting in front of the restaurant for him to pay I noticed a young couple slowing down and peering in to the deli. I said \"Don't do it\" kind of under my breath. But they heard me and ran, and we got our laugh for the day.\n\nSo to all of you: \"Don't do it!\"", "author": "Bekki H."}

It reminded me of the \"I Love Lucy\" episode where Lucy and Ethel open a restaurant, and run out of food, only this situation wasn't funny.\nWe both ended up getting a corned beef sandwich on rye. Both were good, but no dressing on the bread whatsoever. I had to ask for the mayo, the mustard, and the guy also gave us hot mustard and a dressing of some sort. The guy was in charge of the counter and the cashier. There weren't that many people (which is probably a testament to how bad this place is), so he wasn't overwhelmed.

I hadn't looked at the reviews for this place before sitting down, so when I Yelped it, I was a little nervous. But, I'm not sure what all the negativity is about. \n\nOur waitress was nice. Our food took a little longer than the people sitting around us, and she apologized for that. Not super friendly chatty, but certainly not rude. \n\nThe place was clean. There were no dirty dishes strewn about. When customers left, the staff was quick to clean up, for the most part. It got a little busy right before we left and there were maybe two plates that hadn't been picked up. But, as far as I could tell, there was really only one person working the counter. During breakfast, there should probably be at least one more. \n\nFood was good - for a diner. Better than a Denny's. The corned beef hash was actually quite good. And while the blueberry pancakes weren't what I was expecting (blueberry jam folded into the pancake, instead of blueberries in the batter), they were pretty good. The hashbrowns definitely could have been crisper, but that's usually true wherever I order them. I like extra crispy hashbrowns, and should have asked for them that way. The coffee was strong, but not very good.

Another 15-20 minutes after ordering, nothing else (including soup) had showed up.  We paid for tea and left.\n\nKind of freaky.  In the 30-35 minutes we were there, we saw one large family group get dessert for kids, but it appeared no one else at a table got anything and no one got hot food.

That's all I ever order here.\n\n I have had pastrami in New York at Carnagies and had it shipped overnight from Katz's. I also tried the Millers East West Coast Deli a few blocks away after reading the rave reviews here last weekend. Disappointing pastrami and rye @ Millers. Decent but I would call it a 'vanllia' pastrami and rye. Nothing stands out about it.\n\nKat'zs pastrami was excellent except the lousy rye bread loaf they shipped can't compare to what I can get at some local stores.\n\n I immediately went to Davids after getting the Millers pastrami and compared them head to head. Millers use Boars Head Brand meats, which is not my favorite. The meat had more spice and less fat, it was dry. David's uses Sinai -Kosher brand and it's more fatty but juicy and so tasty and spiced just right for me and the rye has a nice crust. This pastrami and rye has personality!!!\n\nI have been going here off and on for 23 years and it's always been the same. Service has been decent but if you go in 3-4 people you might not get your food all at once. I recommend a pastrami to go. In my opinion, Katz's really isn't a better pastrami...at least not much better enough to have it shipped out here. I'm happy with this and so far I am not impressed with people's tastes on Yelp regarding pastrami and rye.\n\nAnd for all the east coast transplants complaining about the food here, order it online and get it shipped.and stop whining.

My favorite is their pastrami sandwich.  My friend had a ruben.   We had to order half because the portion was huge.  Their menu has a host of diner/comfort food that makes the choice hard.  You should see the desserts in their display window!  I saw a fruit salad float by in the arms of the waitress- you get a good value for the money.  It is not cheap, but it is very fairly priced.  Also, they are nice.  I asked for a pastrami sandwich to go to put together later, the guy gave me extra rye bread and packed it well.  It was my first time there.  If you want a table, there are tables in the back.  The dining room to the side is not always open.  It is clean.  Free refills on the coffee, which is good.\n     My friends that come with me didn't like the way it looked when we walked from Mason up to the door.  Once we we were served, their tone changed.

Well, maybe \"learning\" is the wrong word. \"Learning\" impilies that you are adapting your behaviour from past experiences. I still keep making the same blunder over and over. I keep refusing to accept my first inclination and I question myself and take another path leading to disaster.\n\n  So is my experience with David's. I had every intention of going into Katana-Ya for a bowl of one of life's great foods: fresh ramen. The sun was shining, it was warm, verging on hot and for some reason the thought of a piping hot soup and the sweaty college students crammed in there was turning me off... and I walked past David's. As much as I love ramen, love a good Jewish deli... and I haven't been to one in YEARS... Still haven't.\n\n  People kvetch that this place still looks like a 1960s, pleather and formica ensconced lunch counter. True, and to me that reminds me of being a kid in SF and it also reminds me of Zim's (RIP *sniff*), so as far as I'm concerned I'm so down with the decor. What I'm not down with is the crap food, the ridiculous prices and the apathetic-cum-hostile service.\n\n  I had a pastrami on rye with swiss, a bowl of pea soup and an iced tea for $25. The iced tea was like making love in a canoe, it took 15 minutes for me (the only patron) to get a small bowl of watery, flavorless pea soup (with not even a single packet of saltines), the potato salad was room temp and completely flavorless (small pieces of potato coated with some dry, tacky sour-cream residue and nothing else), the rye bread was freakin' stale, the cheese wasn't melted and the pastrami was strangely dry and lean while dripping with grill grease. Oh yeah, and I expect a good brown mustard at a freakin' deli fer cryin' out loud. They have the yellow stuff and a \"hot\" honey mustard out. I asked the waitress if they had any brown mustard. She pointed at the honey mustard and said \"yeah - that's brown mustard.\" I asked her if that was the only mustard they offered and she got irritated and said that was it and stabbed her finger at the honey mustard and through clenched teeth said \"BROWN. MUSTARD.\" Riiiiiggghhht. It *is* a brownish color, I can't argue with that! Sheesh.\n \n  Is there such a thing as a good Jewish deli any more? Have the chain grocery stores and Subway's and Quizno's put them all out of business? I really wanted to like this place, but damn, I'll never set foot in there again.

I thought the place looked good, oh but boy was I wrong! It took ten minutes to get a menu, after we sat ourselves, and only got a menu and water after waving a waitress down. There were only two waiters, who both seemed to disappear into the kitchen often and for long periods of time. It took us 30 minutes to get our food, and cost $23 for 2 people ($9 for an omelette!)! The omelette were overcooked, the hash browns barely cooked, and the challah tasted stale. For a Jewish deli, the waiter not knowing what challah is is crazy! He knew it as egg twist, uh. They included the tip, (the waiter took 10 minutes to bring the check after we requested it) and the cashier was rude and gave me a mean look when I requested to not pay the tip. It was the most awful breakfast I've ever had, and was glad to see the many many other bad reviews of this place.

The first clue something was wrong was no one was in the place. 2nd clue -- everyone working here is ASIAN, not Jewish. ??? I should have walked out right then. But, no. I ordered Borscht, though it wasn't like any borscht I've ever had -- it was more like some kind of generalized kitchen sink vegetable soup, no beets, no flavor, no sour cream. My husband ordered stuffed cabbage -- not good at all, and the vegetables on the side were distinctly frozen mixed vegetable medley. Also, the service was awful, and it doesn't look very clean. Never again. Whoever owned David's before must have sold it and these new owners don't have a clue about Jewish cuisine. This is really bad, trust me.", "author": "Christine K."}

My dad has been telling my brother and I stories about this place for the last, well, forever.  Apparently he used to live a block or so away \"back in the day,\" when he was first out of the military and living at the officers club on Post.  This was their weekly, if not daily, haunt.  Couldn't tell whether I was disappointed for myself (having to eat the food, worry about the cleanliness, etc.), or felt worse for my father who was clearly dismayed to see what had become of the place.  The food aside, I really think they should just ditch their extensive menu and run off the few things they actually have on hand verbally.  I was embarrassed for the servers who had to repeatedly explain that almost every item we wanted to order they didn't make anymore (at all apparently) or didn't have the ingredients for.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2005-07-06", "description": "Any resemblance between this and a New York deli is purely accidental. Over the years, David's has deteriorated from a passable source of Jewish delicacies into an insult to those who know their kishka from their knishes. Sky-high cakes and oversized pastries fill the windows and lure diners into the dingy interior, where a U-shaped counter dominates one side, with booths and formica-topped tables surrounded by rickety chairs filling the other. The sticky floor suggests that a mop is used less often than it should be, or perhaps gets a daily workout without the advantage of soap and hot water. If you stick to the sweets, you may get a sugar rush, but at least you'll be satisfied with your selection. (That's not to say all baked goods are a winner - the ridiculously overpriced bagels are a disgrace.) The preparation of real food appears to stymie the kitchen. Sandwiches overloaded with meat may look like their Manhattan cousins, but the corned beef was dry, the pastrami fatty and greasy. Platters of cold fish - sable, salmon, and herring - looked appealing but tasted less than fresh. Brisket of beef was accompanied by frozen vegetables and obviously canned gravy. Horseradish short ribs were tough and bland. Our grumpy waiter looked like he was one of the originals from the early '50s, and he moved accordingly. After an unexplained overly long wait - the place wasn't very crowded - our orders were brought to the table haphazardly, first two, then one, and finally - about five minutes later - the last. The only saving grace was the variety of Dr. Brown's sodas - including the traditional Cel-Ray - available.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

I've lived in Southern California for 35 years and go to San Francisco generally twice a year. I always made David's my first stop for lunch. But never again. It's obvious that it has taken a nose dive, and you want to stay far away. My last visit was a real shock.\nMy wife and I went in, and the first thing I noticed was that the window full of what was once a wide array of delectable baked goods, is now pretty meager looking. We then took a table in the dining room. There was one waiter for the dining room and the counter that you would not call \"Flash\". I never had to look at the menu. It was always pastrami sandwich and a knish to share. First thing he told me was that they did not have knishes. I'm Jewish. Jewish delis have knishes.  When we ordered the sandwich, I asked the waiter to bring us some kosher dills (pickles).\nThe sandwich that arrived was inedible. Pastrami is not a lean meat, but this was so fatty, I couldn't look at it. So I asked the waiter if he would exchange it for an extra lean (as described in the menu) corned  beef sandwich. This was not much better. It too was fatty. And seemed like it was heated in a microwave that dried it out before placing it on stale rye.\nWhen he brought the check, I noticed that I was charged $4.95 for an \"order of pickles\" (what was one, maybe two pickles sliced). Real delis bring you some pickles for the table when you sit down. I asked the waiter if this was right, and he smiled and told me yes. When I went to pay the check, I complained to the lady at the cashier, and she told me she was sorry. Jewish delis have a relative at the cash register. And Asian restaurants have Asians at the cash register. The lady that took my cash was Asian. I'm not making any statement other than I have to believe that the place changed hands.\nNow the absolute worst part. Despite the bad meal and being overcharged, I left a $6 tip on a $32 (after tax) meal. Once outside, I heard a tap on the window. I looked at the window, and it was the waiter flipping me the bird! No kidding. I went back in, and he took off out of sight, so I told the cashier, who again acted like I was the problem.\nIf you go into David's thinking you're going into a good Jewish deli, you will have made a big mistake. I too wish I could give negative ratings for the food and service at David's.", "author": "Jeff M."}

The dining room itself is a bit dingy with a few tables and a large U-shaped counter in the front room, and more seating in a back room.  Their menus are huge, in size and in the number of items offered.  The food here is mostly a resounding \"meh\"--I think the sandwiches are tastier at Miller's East Coast West.  The pastrami was sliced thin to the point where it was more like \"chipped\" meat, and it was greasy (as oppsed to fatty and good).  I do like David's sour cream potato salad, though.  The front window showcases their tempting pastry items and those are pretty darn good, in an old fashioned way.  I would skip the deli and stick to the baked goods.  That's probably the reason why they put a huge challah, and not a pastrami sandwich, on the sign.", "author": "maiko h."}

Something was terribly wrong with the cheese blintz. It was an entirely different recipe. Unrecognizable glop with a sour, truly unpleasant taste like old cottage cheese. The cabbage soup was passable, but has lost its authentic taste. High points for our waiter -- an earnest and attentive fellow -- who removed the blintz from our bill without my asking. The Asian cashier was bored, curt, and impatient as we selected pastries on the way out. The apple strudel was unrecognizable as strudel -- hard crust, gloppy and overpowered with cinnamon. What has happened to those middle-European tastes I love? Ah! It seems that that it is no longer a Jewish kitchen. No wonder.  Sadly, I will not return.
