We had arrived 10 minutes early, and the host still seated us! He gave us a seat by the window, and even had nice conversation with us. For our meal, we decided on ribeye and filet mignon with a side of truffle tater tots (serves 2). We got both of them medium rare, and they both came out juicy and flavorful. And the truffle tater tots brought tater tots to a whole new level, being tender with a hint of the truffle flavor that wasn't overwhelming. For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding, but we were very full from the meal itself that we weren't able to finish it. I personally would not get this again, as I prefer a more homemade taste of bread pudding.\n\nHowever, the thing that sets this restaurant apart from others is the view and the live music. Even during the day, the view made the meal even more enjoyable. And the live piano was such a lovely touch!", "author": "Julia S."}

We were in town from Seattle and I had this night planned for quite some time. We show up this evening to our reservation and are turned away. The reason, my business casual attire wasn't good enough. \n\nNow mind you the web site front page only says \"Business Casual\", I had on a starched and pressed pair of golf shorts due to the weather and a nice shirt. The pompous host quickly told me I wouldn't be allowed in the restaurant.

My girlfriend picked Leatherneck Steakhouse and made a reservation the day prior for Wednesday, January 3rd at 7:15pm for our party of three. We had requested a table by the window for the view, but since we showed up early, none were avail. Before we ordered, a table freed up, so they were nice enough to let us move.\n\n*Dungeness Crab Cakes: sweet corn relish ($15)\n*Prosciutto & Mozzarella: warm tomato relish, pesto, on crostini ($12)\n*Corkage Service Fee ($20)\n\nWe brought a bottle of red wine, so we started with that and the apps above. I didn't care for the crabs cakes as they were kind of mushy, but the prosciutto and mozzarella were tasty. Especially with the warm crostini. They also give you complimentary bread with butter, roasted garlic, balsamic and olive oil. I love roasted garlic, so was super happy this was included.\n\nEntrees: includes a Classic Iceberg Wedge with blue cheese dressing, all steaks are certified angus beef\n*Ribeye: twelve ounce ($34) \u00d72, one with Leatherneck Steak Sauce, one with Roquefort Butter\n*Filled Mignon: six ounce ($36) with Bearnaise\n\nAll entrees come with a salad which is always a throwback to me. (I grew in my dad's old French restaurant and he included a soup of the day or house salad with each main, so it reminds me of my younger days.) The salads were a good size. The dressing had a subtle blue cheese flavor. I ordered my steak rare, but unfortunately, it came out about medium well. Same thing with my gf. I hate complaining, but it was way too overcooked, so we sent them back. The second round came out blue rare which was under, but we didn't want to complain again. Also, I was kinda full by now, so it was better for leftovers anyways.\n\n*Roasted Wild Mushrooms & Shallots ($10)\n*Fried Brussel Sprouts ($10)\n*Truffle Tater Tots ($10)\n*Provenance Cabernet Sauvignon ($60)\n\nWe ran out of wine by the time our entrees arrived, so we got another bottle. It was more full bodied than the one we brought, so it was a good follow up. The sides were tasty. I enjoyed the mushrooms and brussels. I do love my veggies. The tots weren't the traditional tots. They were kind of churro shaped instead. And I didn't get much truffle from the side. Since it was our friend's bday, they gave us what I think was a passion fruit cheesecake. I took a bite and it was creamy with a nice tartness\n\nFun special occasion restaurant. And such a great view. (Probably even prettier if it weren't raining. We had the worst luck with weather that day!) The atmosphere is classy (but not stuffy) and makes me feel like I'm in another decade. Definitely a good place to feel a little fancy and get your steak on.", "author": "Elena N."}

The wild mushroom and arugula are both delicious, as well.\nThe 12 oz rib eye is little over cooked but is acceptable. It is very tender. I tried the leatherneck steak sauce, which is good. I think it is the repressive and traditional sauce for this restaurant.(just guessing from the name) \nNothing special for the side asparagus hollandaise $10. \n\nThe only thing I am very unhappy unhappy unhappy about this restaurant experience is that our waiter never stopped by and asked for our feeling about the food. I mean Never! Can you believe that it happened in this kind of restaurant? I do not know the reason. Maybe he is too busy to forget.....\n\nOverall, the food and the environment are both nice.

Since we had no knowledge of this clothing policy and it was hot as fuck, he did not bring pants.\n\nSo we walked out of the restaurant and noticed that a couple  of the other men in the restaurant were wearing shorts. We asked if we could sit at the bar and order food there and they said yes. We sat at the bar table for 10 mins without anyone acknowledging us and when I went up to the bartender and asked for a menu, he answered rudely and then said he could only give me the wine list and that happy hour is only for hotel guests.\n\nWe ended up eating at Morton's Steakhouse down the street where they happily served me and my shorts wearing fianc\u00e9.", "author": "Melody K."}

Interesting plate setting. I cut up the salad myself. I tend to notice a lot of high end restaurants like to throw a twist on sale appearance. This one was probably the best I have seen so far without having to feel like I'm making my own salad. I had the roasted garlic mash potato and the 12 oz New York Steak Strip! The steak was cooked medium well. Very juicy and tender. All sides are $10 and can serve two. The mashed potatoes were incredible. However, I did think the mashed potatoes had a bit too much salt, but if you ate the steak and mashed together, the saltiness wasn't noticeable. I tried their steak sauce and it was delicious. I'm more of a vinegar based steak sauce person as this sauce seem to have a bbq based. I skipped out on dessert, but did view the menu.

Had never been there before but seen decent reviews on Yelp as well as a few other sites. \nWe showed up about 30 minutes early This last Saturday at about 5:30 PM. I approached who I believe was the host and let her know we were here and that we were open to been seated early but preferred to have a few drinks.  She didn't even let me finish my sentence before she rudely interrupted me and told me to walk down the hallway. So me and my wife made ourselves down the hallway to find I guess what they call the lounge for happy hour but there were no seats available. So I went back to the host and explain to her that there were no seats available and if she can accommodate us some house. She pointed to an open seat on one side of the room and another open seat on the other side of the room and told us if we really wanted to have drinks I could sit over there and my wife could sit over here which made completely no sense why would I not want to sit next to my wife! I try to explain to her that wasn't going to work she didn't showed me the elevator door and told me I could leave or I can go sit at my original table and not participated happy hour at that point I told her she was being extremely rude and I wanted to speak to her manager. \n She then brush passed me rolling her eyes and mumbled something under her breath about Trump being president. At that point me and my wife were extremely offended by her comment considering were both Latino and the host is Caucasian, we knew what she was trying to imply. So we left.\nLucky I was able to meet Pete who is the restaurant director In the lobby of the hotel I gave him a rundown of what was going on and what happened and how we were beyond offended by their host  attitude and racist remarks. He offered to buy us a couple cocktails and a glass of wine in an attempt to make things better in hopes that we would stay.

We came early for our reservation, but the hostess seated us right away at a window table. I ordered a filet mignon medium rare and we got a side of mashed potatoes to share. In all honesty, I'm not a huge red meat person, but I felt like the cut I got was not the quality I would have expected from such a high end steak house. It was also rarer than I would have liked. That being said, it was excellently seasoned, and the mashed potatoes were delicious. The view of San Francisco's Finanical District and the live piano really made the night for me. \n\nI will say that while I enjoyed the ambiance, the service was subpar. We got drinks at the bar before being seated, and it took what felt like forever to even get the bartender's attention despite there being very few people there. When we finally were able to order, he had the personality of a dead fish and poured two whiskey sours of completely different sizes. It seemed as if he just didn't care. When we were seated the service was very slow, and I had to flag down a waiter every time I needed something even though it was not very busy. \n\nAll together, I had an enjoyable time, but some improvements in the quality of service would be appreciated.

There's no dress code, yet many of the gentlemen are wearing jackets; a few even don ties.

Entrees all come with a salad. There's a good selection of side dishes, but so far we've only tried the creamed spinach and truffled tater tots, both so good that we order them on each visit. \n\nThe food is excellent.

The wait staff , actually the whole staff was extremely kind  and got us seated 20 mins prior to our reservation.  An amazing jazz pianist was filling the room with ambiance and as a drummer myself I was happy to be seated right next to him.  So for an appetizer we ordered mozarella wrapped in prosciutto with a tomato and pesto spread on thin sliced toasted bread. Absolutely delicious!  The wine I believe was the Pinot noir and was very tasty.  They also bring out a fresh basket of bread with butter and a grilled clove of garlic. For our entree we both ordered the filet mignon medium rare. Out of every steakhouse I've been too, this was hands down the best tasting filet I've ever had. It just melted in my mouth.

Seriously, how many restaurants can produce these vibes? If you're looking for a unique meal with satisfying food, solid service, classy ambiance, and an opportunity to learn about our armed forces, then look no further than this hidden gem. Not to mention, Leatherneck Steakhouse offers one of the most spectacular views of the Financial District--probably one of the best kept secrets in SF. \n\nI believe reservations are required. The steakhouse is located in the Marines' Memorial Club & Hotel. You enter the hotel, pass the lobby, then take the elevator up to the restaurant. Stepping out of the elevator and into the dining room, you're greeted by the restaurant bar and a piano playing. \n\nLeatherneck caters to an older crowd. A majority of the patrons belong to the private club (all active or retired members of the military). This amplifies the patriotism you feel when dining here. This also means the furniture and decor are rather outdated. However, I miss that old-fashioned feel; it's tough to find these days with businesses all caught up in the hipster craze. \n\nThe restaurant delivers classic American fare, highlighted by steaks. The menu is short and simple. All entrees include an iceberg wedge with blue cheese dressing (throwback to the '90s!). I ordered the New York Strip (12 oz) while my partner had the Rib Eye (12 oz). We came with another couple so we opted for two sides: Truffle Tater Tots and Roasted Wild Mushrooms & Shallots. We also had two bottles of wine and desserts. All in all, the food was pretty good. My NY Strip was cooked medium with a nice char on the edges. The meat was a faint pink and tender. My boyfriend enjoyed his Rib Eye as well. Let's talk about the tater tots though! The kitchen nailed it. These babies were deliciously crafted cylinders of mashed potato: crisp ridges, creamy centers, golden brown, and irresistible. You MUST order the tots. It's essential, just like a table right next to the windows. \n\nLet's talk about that view now. Please reference my photo. Phenomenal, right? If you ever get tired of staring into the eyes of your date (which I would never!), this view is just as dreamy.\n\nThe service was friendly and professional. It actually teetered on the edge of quirky but it's all part of experience. The final touch to this lovely dinner was the piano playing in the background. Talk about charm and elegance. Can't beat live music like this!\n\nPrices are on par with other steakhouses. After your meal (or before), you can explore the hotel. Each floor, including the lobby, are decorated with glass cases of military uniforms, photos, medals, and exhibits. It's essentially a museum in a hotel. The displays pay tribute to our brave service members who gave their lives for our country. It's truly an honor dining at this establishment.", "author": "Judy H."}

The restaurant is located on the top floor of the Marines Memorial Club, with a breathtaking view of the city. Make sure that you make a reservation, because it is required! \n\nThere was a pianist playing lovely music throughout the night. As soon as we were seated the waiter brought out a bread basket with butter, balsamic and olive oil, and grilled garlic. I highly recommend trying the grilled garlic as a spread on the bread, I was addicted! \n\nThe menu offers a variety of different steaks, as well as some seafood options. All of the entrees come with a wedge salad appetizer which is very tasty. I ordered the 8 oz Filet Mignon. The filet was delicious, very tasty, and perfectly cooked to my liking.\n\nAll of the sides are $8. We chose to order the truffle tater tots and the macaroni and cheese. While the truffle tots were very tasty, the macaroni and cheese blew me away. Must try! \n\nLeatherneck was a great spot to choose for our celebration.

They are RACIST. I have been to countless (Michelin Starred) restaurants all over the country. I have never felt so disrespected by a restaurant. My sister and I were turned away. Supposedly, the restaurant was full even though they were practically empty. My sister and I were about to leave, when a couple behind us came in. They asked, \"Table for 2?\" The guy who turned us away answered, \"We can make room for you.\" My sister and I were in shock. Obviously, this never happened to us before. She went back in and said, \"Why was that couple seated and we were not?\" At that point, the man started screaming at my sister. One of his female coworkers was siding with him.

We split it between 3 people and it was plenty to taste.\n\nFood- For the main dish, I spilt the filet and scallops with my one coworker. The filet was really good and juicy and cooked perfectly medium rare (4.5/5). I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce on the scallops though, and they seemed a tad overcooked, but that part could be wrong. I wouldn't get them again though (3/5). For sides, we got the truffle tater tots, which were good but I was honestly too full to eat them (4/5) and the mac and cheese (4.5/5), which was probably my favorite thing that we ate.\n\nOverall- I wouldn't chose to come back here again, but if someone wanted to go then I would join.", "author": "Jenna G."}

However, Leatherneck impressed us. We ordered rib eye and filet and both were sooooo good. I'm sad to read that others didn't have this same experience because these really blew us away. The flavor and quality of the meat were fantastic and they were cooked perfectly. We ordered a side of mac 'n cheese and mushrooms and both of these were delicious as well. With your meat, they include a wedge salad that was full of flavor and a nice surprise since other steakhouses rarely include anything with your beef entree. They were generous with the dressing as well which is different than some places that leave you eating plain lettuce after the first few bites. Also, they bring you bread with butter, roasted garlic, AND olive oil and balsamic. I loved that we got to enjoy all of them!\n\nService:\nThe service was great as the waitstaff were friendly and prompt without making you feel rushed or that you were waiting too long. One of us ordered a drink that was forgotten, but it was okay.\n\nAmbiance:\nThe interior is beautiful and has such a lovely view of the city. We came early and were able to watch the city transform as the sun set. There was live piano music which was a nice touch.

To our delight, there was a pianist playing tunes. We were seated right by the beautiful windows, and had excellent service. The food was great.

For half an hour no one came by to check on us. When we waved someone down they said they would send our waitress over but she still never came by.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-11", "description": "A classy steakhouse restaurant located in the Marine club hotel near Union Square in San Francisco.  This restaurant is certainly under-reviewed, if not under-rated.  Perhaps thanks to it locating inside of a hotel, not a lot of non-hotel guests tried it or perhaps hotel guests don't bother to write reviews.  Regardless, dining at this place implies you will be listening to some live piano melody during your stay and you don't need to raise  you voice to hold a conversation with your companions.  The restaurant has very good service.    The waiters and waitresses are attentive, with the right degrees.  In terms of food, you won't regret having the crab cake as an appetizer: ample crab meat cooked to perfection.  It does serve some 25 days aged steak if you preferred those along with the \"standards\": filet mignon, porterhouse, sirloin, ribeye, etc.  steaks are well cooked; nothing too dark, grilled or over cooked.  As for the desserts, they are all house made and you won't go wrong with their cheesecake--a very favorable sour-- to draw the period for your meal.", "author": "Edison T."}

I was looking for a steakhouse in the area and was pleasantly surprised to find this one which also came with a great view of the city!\n\nIt's on the 12th floor of the Marine's Club building and the customer base seems to be older, white folks so don't expect a very hip vibe but do expect an old school, classic steakhouse vibe. This means chairs come with clever, unnoticeable wheels so you can easily slide in and out of the table. This made my life a lot easier when I was stuffed at the end of the meal and I could leave my table with ease!\n\nThe food:\n\nRib eye (12 oz) - Perfectly charred on the outside and cooked medium rare, just the way i like it. I'd say not as good as other steakhouses i've been to but its definitely up there. \n\nTater Tots - Get these! Not like other tater tots in that its not ground potatoes but I think they are mashed potato tots. So they are super light and crispy on the outside. Ask for extra steak sauce so you can dip these in it.\n\nPrime rib - Very good, obviously not as good as a place like house of prime rib but It was pretty damn good, very flavorful. It didn't come with any au jus but you can ask for the horseradish sauce which complements it well.\n\nTIPS - \n1) Ask for sauces. I recommend the steak sauce and the horseradish sauce. They will gladly give you more than one if you ask. \n\n2) When making the reservation, ask for a table next to the window. We made our reservation the night of so we had to take what we can get.\n\nOverall, i'd come back for sure! This is a great place to go on a romantic date. I think the food is reasonably priced and you can't beat the views.", "author": "Sheena N."}

The food didn't blow my mind or anything, but the reasonable prices and the exceptional view make this place still worth going to. \n\nThey won't guarantee you a window seat (as one of the hosts rudely explained to me since I wasn't a member at the hotel, equal opportunity needs to be given to both groups if the situation arose). We got seated in the middle aisle of tables and still had a wonderful view. It'll just be awkward because the people with window seats will feel like you're staring at them the entire time. As for dress code they have, they don't really enforce it. In other words, I felt stupid for getting all dressed up because when we got in the elevators with people in t-shirts shorts and flip flops they were also seated no questions asked. There is a piano playing in the background which is nice and romantic, if you're into that kind of thing. \n\nTook someone here for a special surprise birthday. We both ordered the prime rib, mine medium rare and his was medium. The meal started off with a wedge salad, which was alright. Their caesar dressing was a little runny and honestly I hate having to fight for my salad when I'm already hungry in the first place. Like my date said \"wedge salads are just the restaurant being too lazy to cut it up in the first place.\" \n\nThe prime rib was served simple with a few greens on the side. The steak wasn't anything memorable or mouth watering. The steak comes with a complimentary sauce, if you don't request one you want, they'll give you the horseradish sauce by default. The side of mac n cheese we ordered was actually more memorable than the steak. It was cooked and then covered with breadcrumbs and then put under a broiler. Just how mac n cheese should be done.\n\nAll-in-all: the view made up for the average food and service. I feel like this place is a little try hard.

We had our annual family xmas dinner celebration here amd it was the biggest mistake ever.  We had a party of 7. The worst service ever and i even complained to their manager and that was useless since we still didnt get any better service from that complaint. We had asked a server name Ken was standing waiting at the side bar to just take a picture of us that we were right next to him.  He said no he is busy yet he just stood there waiting for the bartender by the time the bartender tended to him we could have gotten 5 pictures already. Another incident with Ken was when my sister asked him while he was by the machine to place orders where the restroom is. Yet the same word came out of his mouth saying he is busy. It doesnt take much to just point straight ahead and say over there. We were served our salad wedges whom requested them and had to wait 10min after starring at the salad since we had no utensils. I went to talk to the manager and he didnt even bother for me to finish talking till he walked away from me looking and then i told him the service needs to be much better. He said he will take care of it. I sat down and nothing happened. I had to actually yell out my servers name miguel and tell him we need utensils. If the manager was going to take care of it and still i had to ask for utensils then i now why the service is bad. Only time i saw the manager come is to place knives at our table before entr\u00e9e came out. Never did he apologize for the lack of services. Then dessert comes we had to wait 15min after all but one of use getting our dessert. I had to yet again flag miguel our server about the missing dessert before all of us can start. He forgot and said a dessert my bro ordered and it was even wrong.  There were more issues i had but to much to write. I will never set foot in this place ever again. Its very sad that it was our family xmas dinner out to have gotten the worst service ever", "author": "L U."}

Their house salad seems home made with light cream and mild, creamy blue cheese (not overpowering). The prices weren't overpowering for steak either.\n\nAnd YES! Truffle tater tots! They're more like tiny vessels of truffled mashed potatoes, lightly fried to perfection. Creamed spinach also perfect (not runny, perfectly seasoned and gooey). Seriously, their food is spot on and simple.\n\nSuper bomb view. And a pianist and musician taking me back to the 1940s.\n\nOverall a really nice hidden gem. It's so quiet, though. Only half the restaurant was in use (probably 10-12 tables total, only 1 large party) and I prefer a more lively restaurant, so 4 stars from me.

Sadly, she got neither, but got very rude treatment at an expensive price.  \n\nShe saved her money (a lot for this age), made a reservation through Open Table, got dressed up, and invited her teenaged friend.  She indicated through Open Table that it was a birthday celebration, and her friend also told all the waiters.  \n\nShe was devastated to be told quite unapologetically during her dining experience that she'd have to move to a table without a nice view because someone else had a reservation.  She reminded them that she also came with a reservation and that it was her birthday.  They said her time at the nice table was up, regardless of how long it took them to serve the food!  Still, she was forced to move.  \n\nAfter hearing the staff sing happy birthday to a young child there with a family, my daughter's friend once again told the waiter that it was my daughter's birthday, to no avail.  They ordered their own deserts and even asked for candles to use in order to conduct their own birthday moment, but were denied.  Furthermore, no staff member ever acknowledged her birthday in any way!  \n\nMy husband and I were getting texts throughout this experience.  We were so crushed for my daughter and decided to call the restaurant to see if we could alert someone to treat her with more kindness.

My boyfriend made the reservations a few weeks in advance for our short stay in SF (we live in Reno, NV). We did not think about it when making reservations, but wish we would have thought to ask for a \"window seat.\" We were in the middle, and the view was just not the same! We were pretty disappointed, but we realize this was our fault, not theirs. \n\nIt took them longer than expected to bring us water and a menu, but we soon received our waters and ordered our meal (filet mignon for me, prime rib for boyfriend and mac and cheese to share). The service dwindled from there. I'm not sure if it was our age (25 and 28, much younger than the rest of the crowd) or what, but our waiter was not too pleasant. Very short (no, I'm not talking height!) and only checked on us once. We definitely expected better service.\n\nThe salad comes with bleu cheese, and I'm not a fan. So, I requested ranch dressing only to find out I had two other options: thousand island or vinaigrette. I opted for the vinaigrette. \"Salad\" is served. A corner chunk of iceberg lettuce with some dressing drizzled on top. Pathetic. I had about two bites and didn't finish the rest. Vinaigrette does not go well with iceberg lettuce. I was expecting a GREEN salad with lots of goodies on top. Very disappointing.\n\nSteaks and mac and cheese were delicious. My boyfriend decided to order the truffle tater tots as well after we had received our meal, and you could tell our waiter was not pleased. Not sure what the big deal was. The tots were also very good! \n\nOverall, the experience was okay. I'd go back for a special occasion, but there are some things I've learned!

Perfect location in the heart of Union Square.  Not touristy and not a mob scene.  Great views and natural light since it's on the top floor.  Fun atmosphere with tons of stately looking men in collared shirts quickly and efficiently devouring their steaks.  Classic food with innovative twists.\n\nRoasted Garlic: A simple touch that is so appreciated.  Most places don't offer roasted garlic and, when they do, they charge at least $5 for a bulb that was less than 50\u00a2.  Here it's offered gratis alongside the butter and makes for an amazing bread spread.\n\nIceberg Lettuce Salad: Classic.  Included with the steak purchase.  I'm normally anti-iceberg, but there is something retro about cutting into a quarter of a head doused generously with chunky blue cheese dressing.  Granted, this could have been heavenly with bacon, but  the creamy dressing against the crisp watery lettuce sufficed to keep my palate interested throughout.\n\nPrime Rib: I asked for a medium cut and this was more like medium well, with only a hint of red.  Guess the lesson is to ask for a notch rarer than what you desire.  Loved the sides of the cut that were engulfed by crispy fat wafers resulting from hours of slow braising.  The inner meat was too tough for my tastes, but probably more a factor of the aforementioned doneness issue.  Wasn't a fan of the house steak sauce since it tasted too much of cloves, but the b\u00e9arnaise was exquisite!\n\nTruffle Tater Tots: Best. Side. Ever.  Imagine mashed potatoes mixed with black truffle then extruded and deep fried to look like mini churros.  Don't even dare taint this with ketchup!  I'm shocked that no other restaurant in San Francisco has tried to bootleg this.\n\nBread Pudding: Massive.  Dense.  Full of hearty goodness, but probably too heavy a pairing after a big steak.

We enjoyed breakfast in the dining room and happy hour in the lounge. The breakfast buffet had a nice selection of hot and cold items and the selection changed daily. They also offered made-to-order omelets, but we never ordered one. The servers were attentive and they began to recognize us after the first morning. The lounge was fairly small, but there were some tables set aside for happy hour in the dining room. The bartenders were aloof and they rarely smiled. Bartending is a social job, but they seemed to be more interested in watching television than interacting with guests. However, we returned to the lounge every evening because of the talented piano player, Jerome Clay. He was warm and friendly with a great attitude and he had a smile from ear to ear. He offered us his playlist and he played several songs for us. We will return to Leatherneck Steakhouse because of our experiences at breakfast and with the piano player.", "author": "Dan R."}

We thought the view was absolutely gorgeous but it didn't make up what was lacking in the food and service that we received. \n\nFor appetizer, we ordered the calamari and there wasn't anything special about it that made us go, \"Wow!\". It was very basic. I mean, it was good, don't get me wrong, there just wasn't anything special about it to make it memorable. For our entrees, I ordered the prime rib and my boyfriend ordered a steak but I forgot which. The prime rib was on the fatty side. I love prime rib and its fattiness but this prime rib was just too fatty. I'd say 35% fat. So I couldn't eat a good chunk of my entree. On the other hand, my boyfriend enjoyed his steak and have no complaints. We also had the truffle tator tots and my boyfriend enjoyed those little tots! Lastly, we had bread pudding for dessert and I honestly don't remember if I liked it or not. That's how unmemorable some of their food items are. \n\nAs for service, I felt as though our server didn't even want to serve us. He gave off a certain vibe that kind of made me feel uncomfortable. Also, I was kind of expecting Leatherneck to greet my boyfriend and I when we checked in with 'Happy Anniversary' or something because I made the reservations months in advance and I stressed that it was our 6 year anniversary so I wanted it to be extremely special. The whole time it was as if we were there like any other night and they didn't really make us feel like we were celebrating. I mean, my boyfriend and I knew but I guess I shouldn't automatically assume the restaurant would put cute little details here and there to indicate that we were celebrating. I feel as if the least they could do was to write 'Happy Anniversary' on our dessert plate. Maybe I was just expecting too much from a restaurant who appears to be romantic because of the view that comes along with it. \n\nAll in all, I wouldn't come back to Leatherneck to celebrate anything.", "author": "Rosa T."}

I'm not sure why they did this? I understand shifts ending and the need to prep for the next day, but this did feel very very odd.\nA warning, the female bathroom was dirty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-08", "description": "My friend and I came here yesterday night for her birthday after she made reservations a day prior. We had hoped for a seat near the window, but from our knowledge, you cannot specifically reserve tables because they run on a first-come-first-serve basis. Also, make sure to dress formally- you will get turned away for not complying with the dress code.\nMy experience with the food was okay. We enjoyed the calamari for appetizer. I got a salad which tasted really terrible. I had ordered my prime rib medium-well and I guess the waiter heard medium-rare. It was also mostly fat. My friend had already requested a new entree after they put sauce in her burger even though she explicitly requested no condiments so I was too shy and was scared that we would seem too \"high-maintenance\" if I asked for my food to be done longer. That was my mistake. Also, when she got her burger and told the waiter she didn't want sauce, he said that she should've told him as if it was her fault, even though I clearly heard her ask for no condiments. She said her burger was okay. We got the warm berry crisp for dessert and enjoyed it. I wouldn't be able to tell you if the prime rib was worth the money because I didn't get to find out myself. \nNow here's the part that ruined the entire experience for us. We were trying to enjoy our meal and fortunately were seated by the window and were enjoying the view, but within less than an hour and a half the servers had asked us if we were done at least three times. We started getting frustrated with their impatience because it was her birthday and we were only trying to have a good night like everyone else there. I had noticed that the tables around us were not having this problem with the servers, not even the people behind us who had been there even longer than us. Eventually, a server came up to us and said that there were reservations for our table coming in a few minutes. We were ABSOLUTELY furious. Another lady quite rudely came and told us we had been there for an hour and forty minutes (we had been there for an hour and twenty minutes) and must either leave or move tables as if it was our fault that we had eaten longer than they hoped we would. I have eaten at reserved tables for three hours before but was never \"timed.\" We hadn't even had dessert yet and didn't want to leave so she stubbornly moved us into a corner away from the window even though there were many other open tables closer to the window. We were so angry. We made reservations like everyone else. We were paying lots of money just like everyone else. The server told us once again that there was an hour and a half time limit (which didn't seem enforced at any other table but ours). I told the server that if I knew our dinner had a time limit we wouldn't have came. I feel like we were the youngest group there (we were both minors eating alone) and that maybe they thought it wouldn't be a big deal with us. We both feel utterly disrespected. Also, my friend had written a note that it was her birthday on the reservation online. We both explicitly told them multiple times during the dinner that it was her birthday. But they never said anything. However, someone at a different table got sung happy birthday. Our requests had been ignored as if they didn't want us in there any longer. \nI have been to cheaper places with better experiences. I had high expectations and this restaurant wasn't even close to meeting them. NOT AT ALL worth the money. We could have enjoyed our night a lot more at any other restaurant and not have to pay nearly as much as we did. If you are hoping for an enjoyable experience that isn't rushed or rudely interrupted, then this is certainly not the place.", "author": "S J."}

Grab your reading glasses because I'm about to go off!!!!! \nYelp, if you were real I would kick you in the teeth! \nI took my girlfriend to San Francisco for valentines day, I thought this would be a nice place for dinner since it had a view, WRONG! \nThe day of valentines, I called just to check on our reservation; I wanted everything to be perfect. While on the phone with the \"hostess\" (an older Asian lady)  I ask, \"Is this a romantic place\" WHAT? she says,  I repeat \"I'm bringing my girlfriend and we never been there so I was just seeing if this place was nice for a romantic dinner\" she replies rudely, \"well it depends on what you consider romantic\". \nI'm speechless, I was just looking for a little validation that I made a good choice in picking Leatherneck Steakhouse. \n\"Well do you think this is a good place to bring a date for valentines? Do you have candles on the table or anything?\" \nIn a very rude annoyed voice, \"Well it all depends, I'm not sure what you would\" \"DAMN IT, JUST FORGET IT!!!\" I interrupt her\" JUST FORGET IT!\"  and I just hang up on her.\nRight there, I should have just said forget this place, but, its valentines and everywhere else is booked! So I stick to the plan. \nWe arrive at Leatherneck which is inside a hotel and proceed up the elevator, I notice that there are quite a few elderly people milling about. My girlfriend who is in her mid 20's is dressed sexy, like a girl who is in her mid 20's. I'm dressed in sports jacket and nice shoes etc. So we take the elevator up to the 12th floor which seems like a cool ride,  a ride that would build the anticipation for a romantic evening. \nWell when the doors flung open we unknowingly step out of a time machine into the year 1968! \nNow I was not there, but I imagine 68 was just an ok year, it wasn't \"the year of romance\".   As we walk in we I see the old ass, rude lady and rather than me wag my finger in her face and tell her about good service, I simply give her my name and we proceed to our table. \nI am in shock, \nAs we walked to our table (like in the movies)  the music stopped, and the entire room looked our way with mouths open.  A woman, head down, about to put soup in her mouth, dropped her spoon in her soup and it splashed in her face but she didn't blink an eye, her mouth was open and  she stared at us in disbelief. \nOK, OK, now that really didn't happen, but it sure felt like it...\nThis place looks as outdated and tacky as saying \"bling\" do describe shiny jewelry. It looked like an old raggedy lounge in the back of an Arizona bowling alley where  they threw in  tables and chairs and called a \"steakhouse\". I mean, I'm not rich, but I have been to some nice restaurants in my time, this place wouldn't rank as decent. \nIf you added up the age of every person,  the average would be 70ish \nI kid you not, the men had long eyebrows and looked like Andy Rooney from 20/20. I love older folk, but this was not the scene I was looking for on a date.\nFirst of all, the chairs had arm rest and rolling wheels, I assume that is to help the older people to get in and out from the table. \nAnyways, we sit down and the music starts and people go back to eating and talking,  I notice we are in the middle isle of the restaurant, that spectacular view of the city, we get no part of. \nMy girlfriend is giving me \"the smile\", the this place sucks sweaty balls but I'm going to smile and act like I'm happy, smile. Immediately  we see a couple leaving the coveted table by the window area and I beg our waiter to move us, he was very nice and says he will see if we can move. He walks over to the manager and I can see them talking. I'm thinking in my head, please please lets us move there. I notice the manager peak over at the two of us, then proceed to shake his head. I was optimistic and thought, \"maybe hes saying: NO problem, move those nice people at once!\"\nNot a chance, the waiter comes back apologetic, saying he cant move us. \nFive mins later, another couple comes and sits in the prized window seats.\nI'm really unhappy and so is my girlfriend. We are sitting in this center isle with people buzzing by us on both sides; like a table in the middle of the sidewalk downtown NYC. So as the manager walks by, I asked him why we couldn't move, he replies, \"we cant just move people\" , in the most rude tone ever and walks away!  This was suppose to be first come first serve and we had not even ordered, It would have been no consequence to move us. We decide to just leave. I give the manager a good lashing on the way out!! To conclude my essay on leatherneck steakhouse, if you are under the age of 40, read my entire rant, and you still dine at Leatherneck, you may want to seek Therapy from a board trained, highly qualified Psychologist or MFT! \nI have done my part, I have warned the masses, I have returned with the tablets from high among the clouds,  the commandments read..

There is history in all the walls, and a lot of it is walking around, a lot of elderly folks with great history, and of a different generation when respect meant something. So conduct yourself accordingly and be prepared for the ambiance. Yes the view is incredible, make reservations and be polite, the lady at the counter is older and has been working there forever, which is nice to see people not get tossed to the curve because of age, so be polite, most restaurants worth your while show that kind of loyalty, try the Basque cultural center for example.\nOk the steak is not the greatest to you, but for the price and view, good luck finding better. However to me it becomes the greatest steak simply on those merits alone. But it is delicious. \nLASTLY, have a little class when visiting, this place honors servicemen and women, there are Generals, Dignitaries, I sat across from a former Secretary of State, there are police officers in uniform, federal agents, E-1 through Admirals, and spouses of fallen Hero's etc.  Please Show some culture, education, and class unlike that clown that posted a one star bellow.

Then you leave and find yourself torn between shouting out its praises, or keeping it a secret so it doesn't turn into one of those places that you need to call three months in advance, or promise your firstborn son to, just to get a reservation. \n\nTonight that is precisely what happened to me and my group of five. \n\nNo, I hadn't given away my yet-to-be-conceived firstborn. We happened upon what is clearly one of the best-kept secrets in the city. Who knew there was a steakhouse in the Marines' Memorial Club that could rival Alfred's in San Fran, or Smith & Wollensky in Manhattan, or Luger in Brooklyn (or for those of you who like chains, Ruth's Chris and Morton's)? Unless you are a retired Marine, sailor, or soldier, you probably wouldn't have known, either. (For the record, this restaurant, and I believe the hotel in general, is open to the public. So there's no need for you to enlist just to get a juicy steak here!)\n\nThe food was excellent. We feasted on several appetizers, not realizing how sizable the portions were. For our entrees, our group ordered t-bones and rib eyes, each of which were seasoned, seared and fired up to juicy perfection. Coffee and desserts were equally amazing, and I highly recommend the raspberry crisp and the bread pudding. \n\nService was friendly and efficient. Our server was very attentive and came back repeatedly to refill our water glasses and wine goblets, also to check if our food was to our liking and if we needed anything. The hostess also came by and talked to us for a few minutes before she moved on to the next table. She's like your grandmother or your favorite aunt whose smile warms up any room and makes sure you're eating well.\n\nAnd the view! Whether you're a long-time San Francisco resident or a visitor in town for only a week, you'll love the sweeping view from the 12th floor, which is high enough to see the top of the Trans Am building, yet still low enough to see people walking on Sutter and nearby Union Square. \n\nI see Leatherneck as a good place for business dinners, birthdays, anniversaries and other special occasions. But you can also go there if you just want a quiet dinner of juicy steak with a bottle of red wine. I think there are three dining room sections where you can dress up or dress down as you wish. \n\nWe'll definitely go back to this place the next time we're in the Bay area, next time I'm booking a table for dinner around sunset.", "author": "heidiologies g."}

When I heard the name, I immediately thought it was some funky place in the Castro.  I'm just sayin'.  \n\nTurns out, it's on the 12th floor of the Marines Memorial Club (near Union Sq.) with some of the best dining views in the city.  'Leatherneck' is the adorable bulldog mascot whose likeness sits in the lobby and dots everything from the silverware to the table decorations...love!!\n\nFood is old school...iceberg wedges anyone?  There's a pianist most evenings and a bar filled with interesting conversations of war exploits from all eras.  Just get your best 50s vibe on and roll with it, because the steaks are awesome and much more reasonably priced than Morton's or Ruth's Chris.\n\nI've been back for lunch and that's another treat...on a clear day, the views are phenomenal.  The atmosphere is calm, service is very sweet, and you'll find yourself thinking that you'd fit in better if you just had a martini in your hand...\n\nOh, unlike the snooty Olympic Club next door, non-visitors are welcome to dine and even (gasp!) to stay in the hotel.

I was looking for an experience, not just a decadent food or a well-reviewed restaurant; specifically I wanted an amazing, classic view of the city in an upscale restaurant that had traditional ambience.  Yelper Adam B's description, \"the closest you'll get to Mad Men in San Francisco\" for me sealed the deal like Don Draper as I often long for the bygone era (minus the messy social issues) of sorts, well at least to enjoy with my father in his heyday. My family has been staying almost exclusively at the Marine Memorial Club for years as it's my father's favorite hotel in San Francisco, especially as a retired USAF Colonel. It only seemed fitting that I'd take him for a nice dinner upstairs. \n\nMy brother and I both started with the out of place for a steak house appetizer shrimp and scallop ceviche served \"up\" in a martini glass loosely wrapped in a leaf of butter lettuce. The ceviche was fresh, cilantro loaded and surprisingly spicy. After a few bites my brother and I looked at each other simultaneously and frowned, \"Do you feel that?\" I asked. Gulp. \"Ahhh! Fire! Hot! Hot! Hot!\" We'd both gotten an unexpected bit of habenro realizing we'd overlooked this crucial little ingredient on the menu. \n\nLeatherneck is a steakhouse so I felt somewhat obliged to order, well, a steak - the 6 oz filet and for my brother, the miso glazed salmon with Asian vegetables. As expected, both of our meals were delicious along with the super rich truffle tater tots we ordered as a side as all sides are ordered separately and come family style. Despite feelings of culinary regression, they are totally gourmet tasting of rich, earthy, gooey mashed potatoes encased in a fancily deep fried shell. I could only eat two. \n\nService was impeccable, our waitress was most attentive and I'd expect nothing less of a steak house serving proudly atop a hotel that exists as a living memorial to the USMC. \n\nPS - Leatherneck has a dress code and in an age with increasing casualness, I was excited to don my new salmon hued, drapey, belted H&M dress with classic black satin Max Azaria sling backs. Most of the other patrons were smartly dressed as well, men in jackets and such, except for the distracting man at the adjacent table wearing a baggy velour tracksuit! Is this 1999 and can I ask him to leave, he's spoiling my ambience?!", "author": "Renee S."}

The views were fantastic! One can see the East Bay and the Bay; the ball park, part of the TransAmerica building and a commanding view of the Union Plaza area, altho you can't see the plaza itself.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm and charming, with live piano music, nice linnen and fantastic service. Meals include a nice set up of bread with soft butter balls, a cooked garlic glove and fresh veggies/olives with a pimento cheese dip. \n\nWe had the Ahi tuna tower and the oysters rockefeller to start. B loved her tuna with avacado and crab. I enjoyed the oysters, but the spinach was a little stronger than the rest of the dish.\n\nI had the Alaskan halibut, which was very tasty and tender. B's steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned well enough that nothing was needed to top it. For sides we enjoyed the chard and I do highly recommend the truffle tater tots. Really tender inside with wonderfully crisp exterior and a perfect hint of truffle.\n\nFor dessert, she got the chocolate pot, a mousse with cherreis and topped by whipped cream. When our server, Cynthia, lit up when asked about the bread pudding, I was sold. It was warm and delish with whipped cream on top. I wanted to marry this dessert.\n\nThe service was very warm and attentive and not at all rushed, which was great as B and I had a lot to discuss. A nice meal shouldn't be any less than 90 minutes, so I seriously suspect those who complain about how hard it is to get their servers attention! There were plenty of people to assist any of our needs.\n\nI suggest a dinner reservation to allow for the watching of sunset, as the colors are spectacular and to see the city change from day to evening was magic and romantic.\n\nTheir menu is small but varied and the prices are not bad for the value. Spend some time checking out the floor below (beautiful library) and the ornate lobby of the hotel.\n\nAnd while it's labeled as the 12 floor, realize that there are 2 floors not numbered, so it's actually the 14th floor.

Perfectly seasoned, not overly cooked, and they had a great sauce drizzled on top (not quite sure what it was but it was delicious!) Next was a simple wedge salad, with a blue cheese dressing that was to die for! Then I had the sea bass, and my boyfriend had the glazed salmon. We shared because both were incredible. Every bite I took just melted in my mouth. I loved the food so much, for the first time in my life I asked if I could speak with the Chef to give him my compliments. He came out right away, and was very nice and thanked us for being there. He recommended the passion fruit cheesecake for desert. Now we were quite full, but the way he talked about the cheesecake seamed like we just had to try it. We shared a piece and OH MY GOD it was unbelievable! Anyone going there just has to try it! We also had a bottle of their house red wine with dinner which was a cabernet sauvignon, and was quite nice.\n\n The service was superb, the views were breathtaking.

Yum! All of the entrees also come with a wedge salad with blue cheese dressing. \n\nFor my main course, I got the filet mignon, cooked to my specified medium rare, with a nice, tender texture and seasoning on top. I would preferred slightly more of a char on the exterior for textural contrast, but it was a nice piece of steak nonetheless. \n\nSides are a la carte and say they serve two. I was dining alone (in town on business) and the server was nice enough to bring me a half order of asparagus when I asked (and only charge half the price, which I didn't ask, but certainly appreciated). I love asparagus, but these were steamed (vs. grilled or sauteed, which are both superior methods in my opinion) and over-cooked.

Ideas included:\n\n- go away for the weekend\n- party at one of our homes\n- party at the old folks' home where they live\n- dinner anywhere their heart desired\n\nWell, their hearts desired to eat at the Leatherneck Steakhouse.  None of us were enthused, but went along with the program.   We thought it was an odd choice since my family is not very pro-military.   My dad was in WWII, but doesn't talk about his experiences, which included the Battle of the Bulge and liberating a Nazi concentration camp.\n\nThe manager of the MM Club was very helpful and gave us a wonderful, semi-private table in the back of the restaurant.   The room itself is lovely - great view, very bright and they have live music.   When we arrived one of the hotel guests was drunkenly serenading the rest of the bar and restaurant with her version of Memories.  \n\nWe had brought our own table decorations, flowers and place cards and the table looked beautiful, set with heavy cutlery, crystal glasses and these way cool salt and apper shakers that had the Leatherneck emblem - a bulldog - engraved on them.  We were taking bets on which one of the four sisters would rip them off.\n\nThe server that was assigned to us was a bit of a problem.  Her English was very poor, and she never approached the table unless I called her over.   She basically stood against the wall for the evening.  It became a little tiresome to beckon her over to take the orders for 12 people, to ask questions about the menu, to order cocktails, etc.\n\nThe food was actually pretty decent, and we even managed to make the vegetarians in the party happy with mac & cheese, salads and truffled potato puffs - yum.  The carnivores enjoyed steak and pork chops that they carved up with their scimitar shaped knives.   My fish entree was also good, even though the crab in my crab cocktail had seen better days.\n\nWe had a bit of a disconnect with dessert.  We had brought separate, special desserts for both parents and they were stashed in the restaurants kitchen.  When I told the server that it was time for dessert, she brought out the two desserts with candles and we all sung happy birthday - but she hadn't taken anyone else's orders, so we all sat there and watched my parents relish their tasty treats.   At this point, we had been at the restaurant for nearly three hours, and we all wanted to leave, so the rest of us skipped dessert.\n\nAll in all, a good place for a special occasion - and the price was right too!  We ate n' drank like fools and it was less than $900 - a bargain by SF standards.\n\nOh - and my parents had a blast, thanks for asking!", "author": ".Hon H."}

The entrees come with a classic relish and an iceberg wedge salad. Sides like mashed or baked potato, creamed spinach, mac & cheese, etc are $5 each but serves two.

We wouldn't have returned if the first experience hadn't been great. As with the first visit, our food was excellant.\n\nThe problem was the service ... crappy service with a smile ... we arrived 15 minutes early for a 7:45 reservation only to learn that they hadn't started seating their 7:30 resesrvations yet.\n\nWe thought, Oh Well, sit at the bar, get a bottle of wine we'd take into the restaurant later. We asked the bartender if we could do that and were told sure. What did we want? Me: A wine list?  So I tell him we want a bottle off the MMC Merlot. He brings over a partial bottle and is about to pour glasses, I remind him we wanted a bottle. So he comes back and sits the bottle in front of us and walks off an putters around the bar. Finally, we had to ask him to open the bottle and pour our wine. WTF? In a restaurant of this caliber, with the hostess stand in the bar, it should have been obvious we were waiting to be seated and really weren't purchasing a bottle in the bar to have it opened when we were seated.\n\nFinally, 20+ minutes after our reservation, we were seated with semi after thought appologies.\n\nTable service was almost not there. Water wasn't refilled. At one point, my wife pulled a bottle of water from her purse and refilled her glass. Food was slow to arrive. We had to ask for steak knives and if it hadn't been for an alert busboy, we'd have had to box our leftovers ourselves. Table is cleared we were never asked if we'd like coffee, dessert, etc. Finally, after each of us got up and went to the bathroom, we had to flag down someone to get our check.\n\nSomething should have been comped for the late seating, like the hostess might have suggested to go to the bar and have a drink on them? They should have been well aware of the slow table service and again offered some kind of comp.\n\nAfter thought verbal appologies don't make up for late seating and slow service.

I arrived early and seemingly there was a full reservation list and most of the tables were taken. We were seated as soon as a table became available earlier than our reservation. This was a nice touch. \n\nThe Salad simple enough was a quarter cut wedge of Iceberg lettuce served with your choice of dressing. In my case I ordered the Blue Cheese and it was nice balance, not too pungent or overpowering blue cheese. I ordered the Seabass it was served in a Safron broth with Manila clams. This was excellent and on this dish alone I give this place high marks. It was perfectly cooked, not overdone, maintained its moist center. \nMy friend had a  New York steak and it seemed a little more than Medium Rare in temperature, but still in the neighborhood of \"Warm Red center\" (barely)  We had the Calamari appetizer, it was well executed with the nice crunch batter. This was served with a a homeade cocktail sauce that was suprisingly well balanced with just enough horseradish to give it the right kick. \nWe also had two sides that are \"a La Carte\"  The Creamed Spinach  was good, but the real kicker was the Truffle flavored Tater tots. This was a nice rendition of mashed potato, a good truffle flavor, reconstituted and shaped into two inch long, Tater Tots then fried.  My other critiques it  that it could have been done with a hotter oil so as to reduce its absorbtion of oil. \nThe service was very attentive to a fault, and anticipated our needs. He made good suggestions without being pushy. The views are great from this location, you can see across the San Francisco city Skyline, and its about 2-3 blocks from Union Square. Looking out the window off the 11th floor (I think thats the correct floor) you can see clear across into the Sir Francis Drake Hotel and the top of it is the Starlight Room. \nThe whole place is rich in history and great tribute to our Armed Forces.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-01", "description": "A hidden Gem in SF - if you are in to steak and a great view come here, but make reservations first.  You don't have to be a Marine to visit, eat at the restaurant, or stay at the hotel - so head up to the 12th floor and let the experience begin.  If you are in to happy hour the bar holds happy hour from 4-6 for guests of the hotel - non guests are welcome as well, but you pay for your drinks. I personally like to get there after 6 - sit at the bar have a drink then head in to dining area for dinner.  Your view is of Union Square, and across the skyline is the Starlight Room & the Bay.  The sunsets are amazing to watch from the 12th floor as the amount of light that fills the place is amazing.  I've read the reviews and while I can appreciate an honest review,  I can say we've  never had a bad experience here and we go regularly.  Just because you have (for example) eight people at your table doesn't mean one appetizer serves all of you - I mean if you ordered crab cakes you probably get two so of course - it's not enough appetizers for everyone at the table.  Also -if you run out of bread ask for more these servers are literally there to make you happy. The meals also come with a salad that is HUGE - so I'm sure once you've had bread & salad you won't be complaining your hungry once your dinner is done.  The pork chops, prime rib, steak all excellent choices, and you get to choose side dishes if you so desire to go with your meal. They are big enough to serve at least 2 people easily so you can share.  It's a somewhat romantic spot, and some evenings they have a pianist come in and play for a few hours which definately sets the mood.  I am a fan of the Marines Memorial Club & The Leatherneck Steakhouse!  p.s.  Try the Leatherneck Ale it's great!\n\n\nP.S.

My friend found it on Yelp and made reservations for 7. The restaurant was nearly empty. I must admit, when we all walked in with jeans--and I with my suitcase--I was concerned.  They have a dress code, but we must have been okay. And, c'mon, the place had only a few tables of serious-looking diners. However, my concern was again piqued when a matronly manager-looking woman ran up to me as I followed the hostess back to our table and asked if she could help me. You know, in the 'Can I HELP you because you sure seem to be in the wrong place, sweetie?\" way. I then heard her say to the hostess \"Did they just walk in off the street?\" Frankly, that started things off a bit wrong for me. For all she knew, I was a decorated Marine. (I'm not, but that's not the point. I have seen Marines wear jeans before, even for dinner.) No matter, the rest of the evening made up for it.\n\nThis place is old skool.  It would be fun to dress up in 60s clothing and have a Mad Men themed evening here, for example. I had a Manhattan to memorialize this. The only way to go is old. I had the French Onion soup, which is as expected but satisfying. The lettuce wedge with blue cheese was another retro touch.  I ordered a fillet, which was cooked to my specifications (I'm a medium gal) and creamed spinach and mashed potatoes to share with my friend. We remarked at the end that we easily could have split those with more people, even if it says \"serves 2\" on the menu. I think that if we as a  group of 7 ordered 4 or 5 to share, that would be sufficient. The only thing was was regrettable was the red zin that I ordered to accompany my meal. Since a portion of proceeds from that wine go to our troops, I'll forgive that. (Combined with the fact that I had just spent 2 days tasting all variety of delish reds in Napa). \n\nThe views were fantastic, and they gave us a great table to watch the urban pageantry. Despite my initial experience with the manager, she later came up to make sure everything was as expected. Our waiter was efficient and friendly. The only problem posed was when we tried to pay with 6 credit cards. The waiter, though, fixed the issue by running separate tabs, which some of my party balked at, but I found truly accommodating when you think that they probably don't do this that often.

Well, lots...and not always what you may think. What about Leatherneck Steakhouse? Sound romantic and elegant? Conjure up warm service and great city views? Turns out it should. My boyfriend and I went late on a Sunday evening. There was live piano music (and there's a huge printed playlist, with styles all over the map, in case you want to make a request).\n\nWhy don't more people know about this place?? \n\nWhen a collection of delicious little slices of bread arrived at our window table with a whole roasted head of garlic, I knew for sure I was in the right place. The timing was good, too, because I needed something to soak up the very generous mixed drink I'd brought over from the bar. We ordered crab cakes to start. I'm a fairly tough crab cake customer. I just don't get dropping a few specks of crabmeat into a mess of breadcrumbs, frying it up and sticking it on a plate with a mound of mayo -- but THIS...this was a fistful of juicy chunks of Dungeness magically held together just well enough for a forkful to get from plate to mouth intact. The corn salsa it came with was yummy, too, a nice change from aioli. \n\nA wedge of iceberg lettuce with blue cheese comes with every entree order. Now it still makes me laugh to see iceberg -- the poor, anemic cousin to REAL lettuces with flavor and texture -- on a high-end menu. But watching my boyfriend devour this dish, grinning and grunting with pleasure (is that too much information?)...well, I guess it's the cheese.\n\nAt the Leatherneck, you order side dishes separately from the entrees, and each side serves two. I wanted to share just one side; BF wanted us each to pick one. I'm thinking, 'Too much food,' but actually it makes sense. An entree usually comes with a veggie and a starch; two sides, right? So he ordered Filet Mignon and I got roasted chicken, with sides of asparagus w/hollandaise and garlic mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious and came to the table hot. The real standout, though, was the filet. He ordered it medium-well (a crime in my book, but I love him anyway). It was as tender and juicy as any properly rare filet I've ever had -- really memorable.\n\nSadly, we were too full for dessert. Maybe next time we'll eat dessert first, just so long as I get my crab cake.\n\nThe Leatherneck Steakhouse is in the Marines' Memorial Club at Sutter and Mason Streets, which houses a really nice hotel and banquet rooms for members and their guests and businesses that hold conferences there.", "author": "Rosie M."}

Also, make sure to ask for the \"yelp\" glass of wine, not only did they give all 5 of us a free glass, but they were not shy on the pour! :)\n\nOverall, had a fabulous experience and would definitely return!", "author": "Cassandra C."}

It's not a super fancy place, and the service was a bit on the slow side although very very friendly. Nice ambiance as they had a pianist playing beautiful music at the bar. We ordered a filet mignon and a ribeye - both were cooked as we ordered, and tasted great. Had the bernaise sauce and horseradish sauce on the side. Based on other reviews, we had the truffle tater tots - definitely a MUST HAVE - and the macaroni and cheese. The wine list is unique in that it featured wineries owned by military families. We enjoyed a tasty pinot noir. For dessert, we had the chocolate pot de creme. All in all, a very nice evening and the food was really good. I'd defnitely come back here the next time I'm in San Fran.", "author": "Karen D."}

The truffle tots were salty and tasty.  We didn't even use katsup.   The mac and cheese was creamy goodnes.  Service was awesome.  My Makers Manhattan was 7 dollars.  Yep.  Beautiful night, beautiful view, great food, great price.  Awesome service.  Ask for Eddie.", "author": "Tommy M."}

The pianist sang happy birthday and came to the table to personally tell my dad happy birthday and gave his latest CD a little cheesy but cute. My only complaint were some fruit flies or gnats. I look forward to going at night to see the evening view. The steak was so tender no steak knife needed nor did we need any steak sauce. An iceberg wedge came with the entrees which the waitress pointed out as we ordered but since I don't like blue cheese salad dressing she allowed me to substitute to a dressing I liked thus saving me the cost of ordering a different salad. How cool is that! All in all a great experience would give it 5 stars if not for the gnats or fruit flies. I hope they see this review and handle that. Also dress code is mentioned when u make reservations which I loved This place is a class act though dress code loosely followed. Saw some folks in attire that did not class up the place.", "author": "Vicky P."}

We had made reservations to get in, prior, by calling. We were all decked out in our penguin best, and eye-catching dresses as we stepped out of the elevator, which turned a few heads just with our arrival. A quick drop of a name, thanks to the prior reservation, and we were IN. The bar is pretty small, and very crowded. But, to have the opportunity to enjoy a cocktail, and a nice view, both inside the bar and outside to the city, made it worth the extra effort. With most of the clientele being of military relation, the courtesy level was extremely high. And, when was the last time you encountered that in a crowded bar?  Live piano provided the music, as several used the musical device as a bar. Good conversation was enjoyed by all. Did I mention the military personnel? Yeah, just wanted to make sure.", "author": "Greg S."}

We didn't want to go somewhere noisy and crowded.  Leatherneck Steakhouse fit the bill perfectly.  We had reservations and were seated promptly upon arrival.  A few minutes later we were given bread, butter, some vegetables, and a nice roasted garlic spread.  There was a live piano in the background and people talking quietly at their tables.  Although we did not have a window seat, the view of downtown San Francisco was incredible.  The word to describe the atmosphere is \"classy.\"\n\nWe ordered a prime rib and rib-eye steak and shared an ice burg lettuce salad, asparagus, and mashed potatoes.  It was just the right portion for two people.  The meat was tasty, succulent, and done just right.  The rib-eye was lean with just a bit of fat trim for flavor.  I didn't put any sauce on it since a good streak should stand on its own.\n\nThrow in a glass of wine and it was truly an enchanting evening.  Since this restaurant is tucked a few blocks away from Union Square, it probably doesn't see a lot of tourist foot traffic.  That provides the peaceful and upscale atmosphere which is sometimes lacking around that area even at nice restaurants.", "author": "Brent V."}

Finally found it in the marines hotel on the 12th floor.  Sat at the bar next to a couple awaiting their table which added good conversation.  Vodka tonic was light but good.  Ordered steak at bar s waiting to get seated.  Was excellent.  12 lean ounces and plentiful.  I will be back when I'm in sf on business again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-12-09", "description": "These other reviews make me think there are two Leatherneck Steakhouses in San Francisco.  The one I visited last night with my family was terrible, with problems from start to finish.  \n\nThe bartender was rude and made the worst sidecar I've ever had.  I couldn't drink it.  Not enough bread or appetizers for the table.  My uncle's fish was undercooked.  My crab was overcooked (and they were \"out of\" the crackers and little forks, which the waiter told me with no apology or suggestion for how the hell I'm supposed to eat my \"crab leg dinner.\"  Um, ok?).  My aunt's fork (which was apparently a score) was dirty.  Service was terrible.  The entrees arrived at different times and we had to ask them to bring the side dishes we had ordered.  They weren't hot.  My stepmom had to try three times to get the waiter to take her drink order.  I ordered two glasses of Zinfandel and they came in two different glasses (one a cabernet glass), again without explanation.  The berry crisp was inedible: not hot and no \"crisp.\"  One star for the tater tots, which were great, which was no surprise.  How can a tater tot not be great?  \n\nIf someone could let me know where the other Leatherneck Steakhouse is, the one with the good food, I'm there.", "author": "Pammy C."}

I had two lovely ladies visitng from Brazil and they wanted a good steak.  We were greeted in the bar by a 75 yr. old drunk Marine with plenty of \"salty\" war stories, oh, but wait it gets better; then a 40 something linebacker type couldn't stop staring at the ladies kinda creepin them out, shoulda left then, but we wanted that 4 star steak.\n\nI have to say the ervice was good and the prosciutto and mozarrella (warmed) was excellent.  I ordered the NY Steak and my frinds had filets.  The NY actually couldn't be cut with an sharp steak knife and was so tough and sinewy it was inedible.  The filet's were definitely tender, but it tasted old and with absolutely zero flavor; like eating a dishrag!\n\nSorry, I'm not out to trash the place, but come on, better than Morton's; don't think so", "author": "Kenneth B."}

I did some research and searched for a good, fairly priced steakhouse and boy did we enjoy this little hidden gem.  The views of the city are amazing, the piano player is incredible, and the maccaroni and cheese was TO DIE FOR.  Hands down the best mac-n-cheese I have EVER had.  They serve compementary bread, butter, an entire roasted garlic, and also veggies with a delicious cream cheese and sun dried tomato spread.  Our entrees also came with a bleu cheese wedge salad. We had the fried calamari which was some of the best I have had.  My husband had the New York Strip and I had the Ribeye, both were cooked perfectly.  We ordered the truffle tater tots as they seemed to be the big rave here on yelp - and this turned out to be the only thing my husband and I wished we had not ordered. They were very bland and had little flavor.  They may have been better with some sort of sauce to dip in (I dipped in my bernaise sauce and still was not satisfied), but I recommend skipping them altogether.  Overall - HIGHLY recommend Leatherneck Steakhouse!", "author": "Kendall M."}

Wow. This was a first for us. We were seated right next to the windows. Pure old school. Relish tray and even roasted garlic for the bread. The entrees come with a wedge salad with blue cheese and sides were extra but were plenty for two people. Wife ordered the filet a notch more rare than usual and came out perfect. Every thing was delicious. Our server Miguel took care of us but was not pushy, just right. Great experience. Elevator down and onto the street to become part of that awesome view from the 12th floor of the Leatherneck.", "author": "Don Z."}

You are abut even with the start light room.Penguin is right on with the views of the park etc etc. Took wife and cousin for wife's 35th and had great time . Started with calamari french onion soup and the oyster Rockefeller .. all were great. dinners came with wedge salad with their own dressing that was quite impressive.never would have tried a \"wedge\" of lettuce unless it was given to me.but that's just me. roasted garlic for your bread. the Mrs had the prime rib good size and \"pretty good\" her words. Cousin Dre had the shrimp pasta that she \"loved\" her words. and a Beef dish with a 6oz American Kobe which was awesome in flavor aroma and presentation. we all shared the asparagus hollandese , massed potatoes. so good we had to finish those first since they don't travel well. the ladies had way more food so they some to go.

I was very annoyed and pissed off because the male hostess i talked to the phone lied or forgot or something and did not write the name. it was my brother's birthday and i was pissed that he didn't even write my name like he said he would. the hostess said he didn't even have a table for us and that we had to wait until happy hour was over. he didnt even TRY to accomodate us after not even putting our name on the list in the first place. (im not sure if he was the hostess or not that i talked to on the phone). he just said wait for happy hour to be over. i said okay we'll do that but he didnt even ask for my name or phone number.  For that i am never going back because of the TERRIBLE service. i didnt even try the food... but dont come back here due to poor service and when the employees don't try to accomodate you after forgetting to put your name on the reservation list.", "author": "Sharon E."}
