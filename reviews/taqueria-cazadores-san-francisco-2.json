The food though, was really tasty. I ordered a plate of nachos with carne asada and shrimp tacos. The tacos were good though I wish there had been more shrimp in them. The highlight for sure were the nachos - they were hefty and had a lot of asada as well as nachos and cheese. I liked that the jalpe\u00f1os weren't super spicy yet added a nice kick. The portion was also massive and we couldn't finish it despite being two people. \n\nOverall, a great place to order from and I want to check out the restaurant in person!", "author": "Valeria S."}

I suppose a lot of them are employees in the area. \n\nI can only comment on the cheese quesadilla because that's what I ordered, but it was a tiny bit pricey for what I received! I guess it has to do with the guacamole that they include as a side along with sour cream. I like that they also include a bag of chips on orders over $8. In the end, it was just a normal cheese quesadilla and it did fill me up. Maybe next time I'll try a burrito!", "author": "Katrine U."}

All of their dishes are super fresh! From the fresh sweet tomatoes in the Pico de Gallo to the fresh lettuce used in their salad. They really put an effort in sourcing fresh ingredients. Not only that, they even offer vegan refried beans (which is really rare, since most mexican taqueria uses pork fat or old fried oil to cook their beans). Another highlight is their guacamole, it's absolutely delicious! Well-seasoned and well-balanced with the right amount of acidity and spice. After one bite, you'll be going back for more and more! Their red salsa is addicting but also really spicy. This is definitely one of my favorite Mexican place in San Francisco.", "author": "Fei S."}

Just say they ruined my 30 minute lunch. Instead of telling me they have no more ingredients, they still decided to serve me. They could have told me that going to the taco truck across the street will give me better food service, but they wanted to be greedy and just take my money. \n\nI ordered a super chicken burrito. When I arrived back to my office, I took a bite of a big chunk of rice. The second bite had more rice and a little bit of refried beans. Third.. fourth... fifth.. rice and beans! All they had left was rice and beans! Where's my chicken? Where's my Pico? Where's my cheese? Where's my sour cream? HELLO? Do you think I wouldn't have noticed? I paid $11 for a rice and bean burrito? \n\nAfter work, I saw two men working on the truck. I believe one of them was the owner. My coworker and I walked up to them and I told them the situation. The owner had the nerve to ask me who made my burrito. He put me in an awkward position because it was the old man he was standing with. \n\nHe pulled out $11 from his pocket, gave it to me with no apology. \n\nIf they recommended the truck across the street, I would have gone there to get my food, but I would still be a returning customer once they opened back up.

When my coworkers suggested we grab good, quick Mexican for lunch, I had no idea they meant this place, but I'm glad I discovered it.\n\nThe food here was better than the food truck options at OTG Civic Center in my opinion. Tasty, cheaper and bigger portion sizes. There's a little seating area if you want to stay and eat. They give you complimentary chips too, which were so much better than the usual tortilla chips you get with Mexican food. Theirs were thick and crunchy and not overly salty.\n\n* TACO SALAD ($7.25, add meat +$1.50, add fish/shrimp +$3) - 4.5/5\n[beans, iceberg lettuce, sweet salsa, pico de gallo, guac, sour cream]\nI was honestly expecting a sad salad with mostly lettuce and a little bit of meat sprinkled in. Instead, this was a loaded salad served in a giant tortilla bowl! I got mine without beans and with chicken, which was a little inconsistent - some very moist and tender pieces, some on the dry side - but there was a good portion of it. My favorite part might have been the tortilla bowl, which was thick and crunchy just like their chips, but the bottom got a little soggy from all the liquid from the salsa.\n\nDefinitely recommend stopping by for a quick lunch or late night food!", "author": "Jessie L."}

They have several different salsas and I am a fan of the dark red one and the salsa verde. Chips come free. I've gotten the regular burrito, super burrito, and California burrito-- all great depending on how hungry you are and your protein of choice. The pastor was pretty spicy and the carne asada is my usual go-to. The shrimp quesadilla is excellent as well. I also love their gooey refried beans. Service is great.

The wait is usually at least 20-25 minutes, and at one point they were charging more than their menu prices (and without disclosing it as such) which was very off-putting.\n\nConclusion:\nI really want to love this place because they have livened up an ugly corner, hired local transients, are conventiently located, and are family-run.

Fish taco comes with a big piece of fish, not just flakes of it. And it's so clean. When I eat the taco, the sauce doesnt drip all over the place & it's not soggy. He uses good to go containers! He doesn't just wrap the taco in foil and throw it at you like most places. \n\nHe might be slow at taking the order but when he gives you your order, he makes sure you have all the sauces, etc you need. \n\nMy co worker loves their vegetarian quesadilla. .", "author": "Jessica L."}

The chicken tamales had a lot of meat in them, but the flavor was kind of bland, even with a bit of green sauce ladled on top. I'm not sure I'll have them again. On a brighter note, one of my usual choices, the crispy beef taco, didn't disappoint. I don't think I would ever go out of my way just to eat here, but I've never had a bad experience.

There isn't much seating so this is more of a grab and go thing (I mean, it's basically a permanently parked food truck).
