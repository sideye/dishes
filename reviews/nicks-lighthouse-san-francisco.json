I feel like all the restaurants on this block are about the same quality so look for whoever's menu looks most interesting to you. A few of the other restaurants on this block have rooftop seating if that appeals to you, but it's the same food served for a higher price. This restaurant only has one dining room inside. \n\nOften times their staff stands outside trying to convince you to pick their restaurant to eat at. In this case we were offered free bread and free soup and salad. The bread is San Francisco's famous sourdough. We also shared a clam chowder and lobster bisque which were both quite good although the chowder was served just a tad bit lukewarm and I wish it had been hotter. \n\nI highly recommend trying the Dungeness crab and cioppino, both of which are famous in SF. My favorite was definitely the cioppino. The broth was delicious and comes with basically every kind of seafood: crab, clams, mussels, shrimp, scallop, and fish. You'll definitely want to use the sourdough to finish off the broth and garlic butter sauce that comes with the Dungeness crab.", "author": "Catherine Y."}

My family has made many trips to San Francisco over the years and during each trip, we make sure to head over to Fisherman's Wharf for a meal, usually consisting of raw oysters, clam chowder, fish & chips, and occasionally some dungeness crab or lobster. \n\nNaturally, on our honeymoon, I dragged my husband here to get some easy street fare. I've never sat down in the restaurant behind the seafood stalls because of the outrageous prices they charge just for a table. The food that we would order is coming out of the front, why go inside for a huge upcharge? \n\nThis time, we were terribly disappointed. We stopped by Nick's so I could get 6 raw oysters. We wanted clam chowder in a bread bowl as well, but seeing the state of the chowder sitting in the tub, we decided to find it elsewhere. He wound up getting some shrimp cocktail along with our oysters. \n\nWe stood around for almost 10 minutes as the seafood guy chatted with the cashier girl. He had no idea our order was in because he wasn't paying any attention, and only when the manager yelled at him to get the oysters did he start shucking them. To his credit, he threw in an extra one for making us wait.\n\nThe oysters were pretty disappointing. They came out of a chilled cardboard box and while they didn't taste dead, they certainly didn't taste fresh. There was this weird muted metallic taste and the texture wasn't crisp and clean at all. We only ate 6 of the 7.\n\nI really wasn't a fan of the manager. He was being obnoxious and waving two huge lobsters around, trying to get tourists to stop and pose for photos with the lobsters. The photoshoots usually ended with him carelessly throwing the live lobsters on a table until the next unsuspecting traveler came along. Not cool dude.\n\nDungeness crabs are all pre-cooked and re-boiled when ordered. Same with lobsters. You can't really ruin something that's already good plain.\n\nIf you're still determined to come here, just get some seafood. Skip the chowder and the fried stuff. DO NOT sit inside unless you just love throwing money away. If you order by the stalls, it's reasonably priced for average food on the Wharf.", "author": "Belinda J."}

So we had some at Boudin and at the Chowder's on Pier 39, both were good.\n\nLater in the evening we walked by this place and decided to try some more. This was easily the best chowder we tried in our trip.\n\nWe ate outside, which feels like eating street food in a fish market. After seating we found out they have a full restaurant behind the street-food counter. They have a broader menu than chowder including fried fish and other things which we did not try.\n\nBut, great spot for clam chowder.", "author": "Gerardo D."}

Market price for dungeness crab was $19/lb. I ordered a crab which they offered at about $30 (for outdoor eating). For some reason the price jumps to $40 when eating inside. When the crab finally did come out it was drowning in a garlic butter sauce (what a shame). About halfway thru consumption i could swear some of the legs were missing (i could be wrong).\n\nIn short, if you give this place a try, dint get any sauce, like the garlic butter.

They have an outside area where you can eat your food in a counter or sit inside. We opted to sit inside, and wow its a small area really busy with tight seating, they gave us a round table booth for the two of us and good thing it was only two of us because it was tight trying to sit down. \n\nI ordered the Dungeness crab special which you can order a half or a full with soup. If your not that hungry a half order of crab will be good for one. The waiter told me the full  one is enough for one but yeah I was struggling to finish since my friend was allergic to shell fish. \n\nI got the clam chowder - which was okay they need to add more clams, the crab was prepared spicy garlic style. I love spice and garlic, but so I was kind of sad that I couldn't taste the garlic, they need to add more. The crab was good though very fresh easy to take the meat out of the shell considering they crack it for you, and big piece came out which I love. It was very messy wished they gave me a bib. I was struggling to keep the napkin attached to the neck of my sweater since I didn't want crab juice all over me. \n\nThe service was good even though they were really busy, she came by to take out the plate for the the empty shells, refilled our waters and gave new bowls to place the shells. Overall, I've giving them 3 stars because the taste was a okay. I've had better clam chowder and if you tell me spicy garlic, I want to taste the garlic.", "author": "Julie Ann I."}

Came to SF with family rather than business and the crab just wasn't as good as we remembered.  Still love to watch the production as the workers seem to make it a musical demo working through hammering the knuckles of the crab to make for easier consumption.  It was expensive.  In fact, shortly after returning to home, we were able to buy two crabs for the same price at Costco.  Definitely something to do if you are a tourist or if your company is paying for your meal.

I cant decide if I want to give this place 3 stars or 4 stars. \n\nCrabbing season has officially started and I was CRAVING fresh crab so we came here. This stall had the most decent looking crabs (no legs missing, doesn't look too dirty/muddy) so we bought one crab for the 3 of us to share. Right now the crabs are going at about $17 per pound, which is still a bit pricey but I think it's really worth it. \n\nThe reason I wanted to give this place 3 stars is because the stall is sooo dirty. Crab shell pieces everywhere, seafood juices all over the place, smells like seafood due to the giant boilers, it's just grimy in general. I probably could have bought crab at a better location but my cravings were so bad I didn't care about how clean the place was, I just wanted my food LOL\n\nAs for the crab, it was so good! They will crack it, heat it up for you, and you can either eat it there or take it to go. The crab was super meaty, sweet, tender, ugh just thinking about it makes me want to drool. I took the crab back, my absolute favorite part, and devoured the shit out of it. The tomalley was so rich and flavorful! I know you're not supposed to have too much of it due to the high cholesterol it contains (or so ive heard) and because of the domoic acid level problem from last year buuuut IDGAF. The crabs here are a solid 5 stars.\n\nOverall i'm going to even it out to 4 stars. The crab here is great but the cleanliness makes me squeamish.", "author": "Shannon C."}

The restaurant is in the middle of Touristville, so is impossibly crowded.  Walk up, wait, and hope that people finish up their meals and get out so you can snag a table.  We waited perhaps 15-20 minutes.  Not bad.  \n\nFirst, the food - thumbs up.  I ordered the Lobster Bisque, the seasonal green salad and a Whole Cracked Spicy Garlic Dungeness Crab.   I never received my Bisque, but I tasted my wife's and liked it.  The salad was salad but their Thousand Island dressing was creamy and superb, likely house made.   Further, the crab was insanely good.  That Spicy Garlic bath they cook the thing in is just delicious .  It wasn't spicy to me, and it wasn't overpoweringly garlicky, it was just really, really tasty and worth the extra $3.   Seriously, go for it.   Also, at a market price (at the time of our visit) of only $34 for the whole crab, I truly felt like it was a reasonable price.  \n\nSecond, the service - thumbs down.  Things started out great but attentiveness to our table degraded rapidly as our visit progressed.  We ordered drinks but were not ready to order food immediately after being seated, so asked our server for \"one more minute\".  Friendly, he replied \"I'll give you two\" as he smiled and moved on to another table.    It was more like 20 before I was finally able to flag his attention again, and I was ready for another Anchor Steam at that point too.   That would be the theme for the remainder of the visit - lots of time between visits by our server, lots of water refills that took way too long, several requests for things that had to be requested a second time or never came at all - so the lunch we figured would take an hour ended up taking almost 3.   I never got the Lobster Bisque I ordered, but I did not get charged for it either.\n\nI hesitated between 3 & 4 stars.   I liked the garlic crab so much that this was a tough choice, and our waiter was super friendly (when he was available).  The place was incredibly busy the whole time we were there, so I have to give them some credit for that, but still.  If the service had been great I would honestly have gone 5 stars because of the food and pricing on the crab, but I just can't do it.   It's a 3 banger.", "author": "Scott M."}

The pasta was your average pasta and I found the seafood to be quite fresh. The clam chowder was my favorite part. You can never go wrong with calm chowder from most places in San Fransisco.

Unfortunately I did not order it myself. But we will go back again to try it.\n\nCons\n\nIt looks like they fired the house cleaner back in 1950. The amount of dust which has accumulated in the place is atrocious.\n\nArchaic interior design leaves something to be desired for a restaurant his prices indicate they generate quite a bit of revenue.\n\nCommentary:\n\nSet a tour of the southern entrance of the fisherman's wharf is Nick's lighthouse seafood restaurant. When tables are Available a gentleman will be outside calling to you to let you know that the tables are available in the truck more than welcome to come and dine. The restaurant is in a very small compact space however it has more of a cozy intimate feel than a small compact feel. Which is a good thing. \n\nAs I look at the pace of other people, the food look fresh I came out rather quickly and it look like it was enjoyable. My issue with all three things which we ordered was that they were way too salty. It was sourdough bread with Parmesan and butter I don't understand how that salty enough to make me feel like I was going to have a heart attack. The Crab chowder with sludgy chunky and did not have a great flavor. It to was overloaded with salt. The fried zucchini however was excellent. Unfortunately they did not have any marinara sauce to go with it. I asked for marinara sauce and I was actually bought tomato bisque. Ironically enough, that was the one thing that was not at all salty. However, when we looked around at the dishes of other people, some of the food they chose the excellent so maybe the appetizers that we decided on one of the best choices at the restaurant. We are particularly interested in returning for the deep-fried platter. It looked phenomenal!\n\nConclusion \n\nThe place could use a good rate of deep cleaning like extensive deep cleaning like someone needs to shut it down for a week and just grab it from top to bottom and buy some new ceiling tiles and replace the ventilation system which is caked up with dust. After that, and decreasing the amount of salt and the dishes by 75%; this place could be a real five star treat talked in to the boardwalk. But for today, it's simply gets three stars.\n\nI would go back to this place again. Ultimately I just know it's a 3 Star Place.

I popped over to the city with my friend to buy some new pants and afterward, we decided to pretend to be tourists for a bit, so we headed to fisherman's wharf to find a place for clam chowder and seafood!\n\nWe settled on Nick's because there was a man outside yelling that there was one table left so we just figured, what the hell, let's do it.\n\nWe sat down and were immediately greeted by our waiter.  He was pretty pushy and we were suckered into buying a calamari appetizer.  I'm not that upset about it though because it was decent.  a little tough though.  I don't like pushy waiters, because I can definitely order for myself, but I get it.  It's a tourist spot and I guess I can respect the tactic, haha.\n\nOur clam chowders were DELICIOUS though!  I ordered the capelloni (I think that's what it was called)  and it was ok.  Not amazing, but it was ok, there was some nice crab inside with shrimp.  Not amazingly fresh, which was a little disappointing.  My friend ordered the seafood pasta, which she really loved.  My favorite part was definitely the clam chowder though!  It honestly took the place of my favorite San Francisco clam chowder from another restaurant I frequent in the city.  \n\nGREAT SOURDOUGH BREAD!\n\nI'm not sure if I'll go back for a whole dinner, but I'd definitely go back for just a bowl of clam chowder!  I'd say to just go here for the soup.", "author": "Kevin K."}

Well, you don't! You just kinda go to where your body gravitates or whoever sold the better pitch!\n\nEven though we just had brunch, we got lured into Nick's and were immediately seated in a cozy circular booth.

All of the restaurants offer basically the same type of food, just a matter if which one appeals to you. They all have a hot boiling pot of water, just waiting for the crab to be dumped in. There are even salesmen outside trying to lure you into their restaurant. They're really pushy...reminds me of people at an outdoor flea market. Honestly, I can't even tell you why we chose Nick's.\n\nWe ordered a whole dungeness crab which was about $30. Yes, it's overpiced. But then again, you're in a touristy area. The crab tasted fresh, without a doubt. There was plenty of meat in the claws/body of the crab. By ordering the crab, it also comes with a side. We decided on getting the crab chowder and it was pretty good! I wish we got more than a cup though. \n\nMy biggest complaint was the size of the tables inside the restaurant. SUPER crammed. You can barely move once you're seated cause the table is so close to you. Not a relaxing environment at all.

I ordered the linguini and Dungeness crab and It came with ur choice of soup (ordered the lobster bisque) or salad.  The food came out pretty fast.  The seafood was fresh and the taste of the sauce was good.  They offered a generous amoint of crab bits,  seems like every bite there was some amoint od crab in it.  The pasta was cooked well, not too aldente or too mushy.  Would've given them a 4 star but they double charged us food we didn't order which would've been a problem of we didn't catch it and the place was to cramped to enjoy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-11-26", "description": "Long story short: Their crab sandwich gave me food poisoning and as a sandwich it was abysmal as well. The crab chowder was quite acceptable though (which is why it's 1/5 not 0/5)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn Thanksgiving morning (having completed a successful and healthy bowel movement), I decided to go on a long walk and grab a light meal before the main event at a relative's house. I walked from FiDi to Liguria bakery hoping to get some Foccacia, but they were closed. Discouraged, but not defeated, I trudged onwards to Fisherman's wharf. \n\nAfter observing the sea lions for a bit, I meandered over to the section of the wharf with the sidewalk shacks and restaurants. After browsing the menus posted outside, I made my biggest sober mistake of 2017: entering Nick's Lighthouse (not a euphemism).\n\nIt was fairly empty at the time, so service was quite prompt. I made my decision pretty quickly: A small cup of crab chowder and the Crab sandwich. Once the chowder came out, I went through it pretty quickly and it was quite delicious, especially since I had doused it with hot sauce. \n\nThen came the sandwich: Bread was solid, lightly toasted, fresh. But what was inside...well let's just say I'm avoiding mayonnaise for a while. It was extremely heavy on the mayo, they probably should have described it as \"Mayo sandwich with some crab\". There was also some finely chopped crab, and what looked like the occasional fleck of celery and/or carrot. Anyway, it wasn't that great, I only ate around 1/3 of it before calling it quits. I paid, grabbed a ride share, and eventually made my way to the South Bay by early evening. \n\nBy the time dinner was served, I knew there was something wrong. Despite the small volume I had eaten, I was still feeling unusually full, bloated even. I also felt lethargic and feverish. I had a few bites of what my hosts were offering, but I really wasn't in the mood to eat. Shortly after, it began. \n\nNature called, and being a somewhat civilized individual, I went to the bathroom to answer. However, this was a case of \"What goes down, must come up\". \n\nFor those of you that have seen the exorcist, my projectile vomiting was like the movie, but with better aim. For those of you that have not seen the movie, imagine oatmeal/porridge  coming out of your mouth with the force of a Saturn V rocket launch (link below). However, instead of the colour or smell of oatmeal, it has this disgusting brownish red colour (think Utah Sandstone, but wet) and a putrid marine bottom feeder stench that only a seagull could love. That smell is likely to linger in that bathroom for a while, the residents may need to move out.  \n\nThe \"pandemonium vomitorium\" continued on and off for a solid 45 minutes. I kind of wish somebody could have caught the event with a slow motion camera, it would have made a great viral or national geographic video on bodily functions. When I skulked out of the bathroom, I realized I needed to return home. Since I had pretty much emptied out my insides and because of the skilled driving of Lyft driver Zyed, we had an uneventful ride. \n\nI drank some water and it appeared I could keep down liquids. I thought my condition was improving! I was wrong. A few hours later, the other end started to fire up instead. Mud coming out of a wood chipper is my most apt description and should suffice. I had a sleepless night since I had to get up and use the bathroom roughly every 45 minutes. \n\nThe next day I went to work. Later on when looking for lunch options, everything was closed except McDonalds because of Black Friday. I had my 6 piece McNuggets, and I successfully kept it down...for two hours. Then it came back up....the other end continued to fit the wood chipper description. \n\nBy Friday night I was mostly back to normal, but the point is, Nick's ruined my Thanksgiving.", "author": "Parvez A."}

We originally had the place next door in mind but the exterior format confused us.This was one of the poor choices we made that day. \n\nThe service was just okay but at times my friends and I felt neglected. We would have to wait to catch their attention as they stood there chatting. The food wasn't that good either and would go cold super fast because of the rotating fans above us. I ordered the lobster based soup and my friend got the clam chowder. The clam chowder was bland in flavor and a bit watery. The lobster soup was good because of the lobster bits and was the only thing I really enjoyed. We also got calamari rings which were mediocre. \n\nIt does have a view of the dock and the interior is interestingly decorated. The tables can even be merged with the removal of the small wall in between the tables.  The bathrooms in particular were not clean. I waited for the female stall to open up to see a male staff walk out. The male stall was entirely fine but either he really had to go or he couldn't care any less. It felt uncomfortable using the stall after he did. Not pleasant at all. \n\nI paid with my credit card but they told me it didn't work so I gave them cash instead. Turns out it did work when I went to the Starbucks at the Wharf a little while later. Don't really know what was up with that.

When we asked for the check, the tip was already added -- which was fine and reasonable. On the customer copy of the receipt, the total amount was correct. On the merchant copy, the prefilled total was exactly $100 more than the customer copy.

How will I start. First service. I understand that they are busy but, no one even set our tables up they didn't get gave us utensils or plates or napkins to eat. We have been trying to gain someone's attention but everyone seems to pretend that they are busy (busy chatting with one another). So as a result our appetizers are out and guess what we still don't have utensils. So we have been starring at our appetizers for a good 10 minutes before some one actually noticed that we can't eat because we do not have freaking utensils. Anyway on to the food. I am very disappointed with the food and its price. We ordered crab cake as an appetizer and guess how much it is for 1 piece of crab cake! It's $16. And imagine my disappointment when I turn around and check their menu in their food stand outside. They are selling the crab cakes 3 for $10. I was pretty mind blown. Okay on to the most exciting part, their special. We order Bouliabasse which came with Dungeness Crab, Jumbo Prawns, Manila Clams, Calamari, Mediterranean\rMussels, Sea Scallops, Fresh Fish, Tomato Sauce, Parsley, Garlic, Green Onion, & White Wine. It is very bland and swimming in its sauce. Plating is dirty and it's look is not very appealing to eat. With that being said, they forgot to give us the clam chowder which was supposed to be an appetizer. With the crab cake and the bouliabasse our with 2 sodas our total was almost $70. Imagine my disappointment. So let me warn you. Stay away from this place. And just eat on the food stands.

I should've checked Yelp first before sitting down but it was too late when I finally realized. I tried to keep this review short but unable to describe how bad things had gone down in just a few words so please bear with me......\n\nWe each ordered a Boston clam chowder but total disappointment. They were bland, needed to add a bit of salt and pepper in order to enhance the so-called flavor. It was just thick, heavy-creamed liquid with some small pieces of celeries, 2 small pieces of potatoes, and listen to this.......four.....only 4 tiny cut up pieces of clams in the entire bowl of soup and they were so tiny, I had to fish them out! My husband's bowl has only two tiny pieces! Guess I was the lucky one!! Needless to say, I fished out whatever clams I can and put the chowder aside.\n\nHe ordered spicy garlic Dungeness crab, which was quite tasty, but the crab was very small for a Dungeness crab - so small that we even wondered if San Fran has a law against keeping crabs this size. However, it was fine because it actually tasted good so we thought things will be good from here but...........\n\nI ordered a piece of grilled salmon, telling the waiter that I don't want my salmon to be over cooked, prefer \"medium\". However, My salmon ended up being wayyy undercooked! The outside looked fine but it was still raw in the center. I asked the waiter to have the kitchen cook it some more but when he brought it out the second time, still raw in the thickest cut! The waiter then asked the manager to come talk to me so I explained what happened and that I am not eating sushi. He offered to have the kitchen cook another piece for me or I can order something else but given what happened to both of the items I ordered, I lost confidence in their kitchen so I told him (in a very polite manner throughout the whole ordeal) that I just want to cancel the order. He was reluctant at first but still obliged at the end.\n\nUnfortunately to my surprise, he charged me $7.00 for the small plate of house salad, that was supposed to come with each entree, because I had returned the salmon due to a fault on their end!! I spoke to our waiter (still keeping my kool) and he said it was his manager's decision. He then took our check, came back 2 min later and we found out he had put $7.00 inside the pocket. We were speechless with mixed emotions. We don't want or need to be pitied, just the principle of things.

As we walked around the Wharf, all I wanted was a fresh lobster roll (not the cold ones in the market cases). Chef Nick was greeting customers with a lobster and crab to take pictures. I asked if he could make me a lobster roll. Chef Nick said \"I'll take care of you. And you will love it!\" True statement!\n\nI've had lobster roll in other cities like Boston. Hands down Nick's Lobster Roll is at the top of my list. Fresh, warm, lobster served on fresh, buttered sourdough bread. Chef Nick even made me a delicious lobster tail, cheese, and veggie bake with the extra lobster meat. It was a little price but well worth it!!", "author": "Carolina A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-06-25", "description": "This is a hole in the wall joint, but I have found and loved places like this. But not this one. \n\nThe ambience is what you'd usually find in a tourist area, loud and crowded. But aside from what you'd expect, the waiters here are rude and don't care at all. I felt as if they feel that they'll get paid and a tip regardless and if someone doesn't like them, oh well...they'll be seating another round of people in 30 minutes or so. \n\nWe all ordered the fish and chips. I ordered an additional dozen oysters on the half shell. The fish and chips combo was $13.99. Came with either a bowl of clam chowder or green salad and Cole slaw. I'm not crazy about fish and chips but I went with the flow because I wasn't paying and didn't want to make things difficult. But I was looking forward to my oysters at $25. While waiting for our food, we had to ask for water. We also had to ask for napkins. The napkins were linen and everyone had a table setting except my niece. She politely asked the waiter for a napkin, and the waiter pulled one from the unfolded pile and just dropped it on the table as he rushed off as if he was inconvenienced and had no time to make sure we had what we needed. We also observed that all the other tables were being served bread baskets with butter by bus boys once they sat down. We didn't get one until we asked for it which arrived 5 minutes before our food. Perhaps they didn't see us because we were a party of 8? Bread when arrived was warm, soft and pretty good. Not amazing but pretty good. We were the first table along the wall of the front entrance. Don't sit there! The place is already tiny enough and that area gets a lot of in and out traffic. The waiters are constantly squeezing two at a time, through the little walk space and their rears and body is way to close to you. One of the bus boys takes his breaks along the front entrance wall drinking a dark beverage out of a glass that has no ice and stows it there whenever he needs to go and serve someone, then returns and drinks leaning against the wall. I'm wondering if the beverage was an alcoholic one. Whatever, but his beverage was sitting on a ledge that was 12 inches away from my head. That is kind of an inappropriate place. Staff food and drinks should be stowed in the back and or somewhere not visible to customers. I was uncomfortable sitting and eating a meal at the bus boy break spot where they leave their drinks. Clam chowders and salads, whichever you chose finally came. I got the salad. The salad dressing was a balsamic vinegar with spices, burns, two cherry tomatoes, and a slice of red beet. The dressing was really strong and spicy. Kind of hot. I didn't care for the salad but I ate it because I needed something refreshing. I tasted my sons clam chowder, and I've had better clam chowder out of a can. The chowder was flavorless. The amount of clams was decent. Again, I've had better out of a can. Fish and chips arrive pretty quick, but my oysters never came. I quickly asked for them. My waiter seemed to have forgotten but quickly remembered my appetizer and pointed to them outside at the shell fish sidewalk setup and said, \"oh, they are out there\" Lol after a pause between us both I wondered if I was suppose to go and get them myself but he broke the awkward pause and said I'll go get them. Everyone started eating. I didn't dare try the coleslaw because coleslaw is not prepared the same everywhere. The fish used was not what any of us expected. We thought that we'd get thick, long pieces. Or maybe either thick or long. Instead it was hardly anything. Each piece was the length size of my pinky finger at the smallest and the length size of my middle finger at the longest. The average thickness was a thumb size to a thumb size and a half. There was more batter than fish. When I peeled the batter off I was left with fish shavings and a pile of thick batter. Not to mention, the fish had no flavor and neither did the batter. Not even salt. It was very bland. The oysters were not bad but I've had better and prettier for less than $25. But it was fine cause at least I had oysters to eat since there was no fish in our plates. \n\nCheck arrived quick and it was $192.48. Gratuity was included (no wonder service wasn't that great). I also ordered one glass of Chardonnay and got my mom a Stella. \n\nOur waiter Jeremiah was alright. He wasn't great or anything special but just did the minimum to keep it moving. The dinner bill is what I expected for 8 people and what we ordered, but it wasn't worth it with the added 15% gratuity. I probably wouldn't come back here again. And I'd have to agree with the other posts about this place, that service isn't great, clam chowder is better from a can and now me adding fish and chips order is flavorless. I don't like giving negative reviews as I often like to give my experience to share on Yelp and allow readers to make their own decision on whether or not my review is negative or positive.

I ordered Half of lobster the waiter asked me if I wanted boil, grilled, with their spicy sauce? I said grilled & with their spicy sauce since my cousin its really good & I saw on yelp that it does look delicious. When I got my food it was a boil lobster with cocktail shrimps on top & I was not happy at all. But I did not want to send it back because everyone seems like they were half way done eating or done eating & I didn't want to wait even longer to get a new lobster & make everyone wait for me so I just ate the lobster the waiter brought out. There was no butter for the lobster & I forgot to asked for it so I ate it plain so it wasn't all that good.\n\nOur waiter was busy & we can see that but my cousin asked the waiter for butter & he kinda gave her an attitude & its not like my cousin was rushing him, gave him an attitude or anything she just asked him. The waiter we had seems to be kinda rude/snobbish from the beginning & he got my order wrong too.\n\nI gave it 2 stars for the food that I got & the waiter.

If you don't want to sit in their dark restaurant, go across the way to the circular chowder restaurant with private outdoor seating, get a beer and enjoy outside seating, the bay breeze, and the best crab in the world.\n\nThe crab meat was soo juicy and sweet.  Their spicy garlic sauce is so mind blowingly good without overwhelming the crab.  I'm not even overexagerating, its so good you'll probably lose your memory.  Nothing that happened prior to eating this will matter, its like a re-birth.  The first time I tried this, My girlfriend and I each got our own crab (around $30) and after we paid, we noticed this family of FOUR sharing one crab and we thought \"shit...maybe we shouldve shared,\" but boy was I glad we didn't share because we both destroyed our individual crabs.  I'm not even embarrased because I know you're probably thinking I'm a hungry sasquatch right now, but if you haven't tried it, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.\n\nIt is a MUST if you're at the wharf, this is good for breakfast, brunch, lunch, mid afternoon snack, linner, dinner, AND dessert.  thank me later.", "author": "Mimi T."}

The fish and chips were aight with the tar tar sauce but as soon as you touched it the batter comes off, it also want really crunchy at all. No matter how much lemon you add you could never really taste it. The crab sandwich was subpar at most. The sandwich did nooot have a good bread to stuffing ratio. It was a simple and classic crab sandwich and although those may be plain they can taste pretty amazing, thats what makes em classic. But this sandwich, though be classic with a simple bun and crab mixture, was not very amazing at all. The bread was overwhelming a very tasteless and watery crab mixture. The crab looked kind of fake, as if it came out of a can. The mixture was mixed with some pieces of celery and maybe some green onions but it tasted like that was literally it. No mayo no garlic no ginger or butter no black pepper. Maybe even no salt. It was a big watery crabby mess. It didnt help that the two pieces of bread that sandwiched it were crunchy but wayyy tooo tough and maybe a bit overdone. It was soft only about halfway through each piece of bread. But at least the customer service was nice enough.

The food was not good at all, but besides the food not being good our server inflated the tip and included an extra 15 dollars charge to my CC. I called the restaurant to try to get a refund for that amount and it was a nightmare! The General Manager was very unprofessional and ill-mannered and did not apologize for any of the inconvenience this has caused me. He began by asking me if I had worked at a restaurant before and I replied that I have, then he continued to state that I should understand that things like this happen and that they are going to refund me (without providing any confirmation of the refund) and what more do I want. Furthermore, he stated that it's not the end of the world and it's not like I got ran over by a food truck. WOW this guy is the last person that should manage a restaurant. So If you want to avoid nasty food and a nasty attitude DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!  I ended up having to file fraudulent CC charges through my bank because Nick's Lighthouse did not want to refund the inflated tip amount.

Low and behold, she chose Nick's Lighthouse. \n\n Eduardo seated us in a booth and shortly after Edilbert introduced himself as our waiter.  Being the tired, hungry, confused tourists that we were, we kept mistakenly calling Edilbert, Eduardo until he finally let us know he was not Eduardo and so we settled on calling him Ed.\n\nAnyway, Ed was a very remarkable waiter that was not easily flustered by demanding out of town tourists.  Even when the women at our table complained that they could not find any lobster in their lobster bisque, he just replaced it with some kind of crab chowder.\n\nI have a heart problem which prevents me from eating things with a lot of sodium so I settled for a crab sandwich and some unsalted fries.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-24", "description": "After my group of friends from Michigan had a full day of sight seeing in San Francisco, we found ourselves at Fisherman's Wharf feeling the pangs of hunger and weary from all the walking we did all day long.  One of our companions had this strong desire to eat crab legs.  According to my boyfriend, crab isn't in season at this time, so she would have to settle for fresh frozen Dungeness.  She didn't seem to believe him and started asking employees that stood outside at some of the seafood restaurants.  When she realized her California dream wouldn't come true, we let her pick a place to eat at so she would settle down and let us all find a spot to just eat and relax. \n\nNick's Lighthouse was the chosen eatery.  Eduardo, who was standing outside guided us through the crowded and noisy restaurant.  We were lucky to find two adjacent tables that sat side by side - four of us at one table, and three at the other.  We also had different servers.   Menus and water were served quickly as we tried to seat ourselves in the most cramped seating arrangements I have ever had to endure.  Our stomachs were pretty much touching the tables, as I tried to place my purse, camera and jacket snuggly to the side of me.  I guess the goal is to try and fit as many patrons in as they can!  Maybe because this is a seafood restaurant, they took the term \"packed like sardines\" too literally! \n\nOur waiter Edilbert was great, he made our somewhat tense dining experience more bearable.  Since I wasn't that hungry, I ordered clam chowder in a bread bowl.  Had I known we were going to get complimentary sourdough bread already, I would have just ordered my clam chowder in a regular bowl.  The sourdough was delicious, but it was just too much bread for me.  I really hated wasting the rest of the bread.  My boyfriend got a crab sandwich while my sister and girlfriend got lobster bisque.  The chowder was very good, but the lobster bisque apparently lacked flavor, including the lobster portion of the soup.  My girlfriend complained to Edilbert, and he kindly exchanged their soups for crab bisque which contained chunks of crab.  Everyone at our table enjoyed our meals.  The rest of our party at the other table didn't seem quite as satisfied, and seemed to keep quietly to them selves.  Although I did notice they were giving their waitress a hard time.  I guess if they were Yelper's we would hear all about it! \n\nWhen we were ready to leave, it took some maneuvering to get out of our booth.  Then we decided to use the rest rooms before leaving, and found ourselves in a very narrow hallway waiting to use a single cramped restroom for the women.  When all was said and done, it was a relief to get away from the noisy crowds of people within the small spaces, back outside to the open air again!

To be honest, I only tried one item - the Clam Chowder.  I opted for the pint, not a bread bowl.  Being from Boston, MA I would like to believe I know what clam chowder is supposed to be, and what it is not supposed to be.  The only thing the Chowder that Nick's version has in common with what I believe chowder to be is that is was creamy, and had potatoes in it.  The similarities end there, there were virtually NO CLAMS in the entire pint (I tasted maybe 3-4 small pieces of clam), and worse yet had little to no seafood/clam taste.  \n\nFor $9.52 for a bowl of soup, it is highway robbery.  I didn't mind paying the money when I assumed I would get a halfway edible bowl of soup.  I would up eating a little less than half and tossing the rest -- it just wasn't worth eating.  \n\nI have had a few chowder's in my life that I would consider truly awful, this is right at/near the top of the list.  Perhaps their seafood is better than the soup ... but based on this, I wouldn't necessarily bet on it if they are doing anything to the seafood other than boiling/steaming it.\n\nHighly disappointed.", "author": "Jeff S."}

It consisted of 5 shrimp, sauce rice and cauliflower and the amount of food was little for the price (about $26 with complimentary bisque).\nMy pasta alfredo was far more satisfying, with a great amount of pasta and sauce, enough shrimps and an interesting but pleasant addition of lightly cooked tomato. The scallops rumoured to be included were on the scarce side but the dish was still very good. More food that my companions main order.\nThe service was very casual and as our break request was completely overlooked I'll drop my review score. I'm also dropping score because of the sub standard meal my companion had which was pricey for how basic it was.\nIf you eat here, the chowder in bread bowls would be a good choice, or stick to the specials menu.", "author": "Anthea W."}

Small restaurant, small booths, very cozy feel. \nWe came in for lunch two weeks ago. My friend and I were in the mood for a seafood fiesta! We were hungry and wanted everything! So we started with 1 dozen oysters, then 2 clam chowder bread bowls, the cheese bread, crab cocktail, tiger shrimp cocktail, fried seafood platter and a crab pasta. Yes.. We eat like piggies. Overall the food was ok. I've had better else where but once again, I like the ambience of this place. \nNow this is where things go down hill. Our server Olga, was just not very friendly. She didn't really seem like she cares too much about our table. After taking our order she just came and dropped off food without saying what it was or anything, Just drop off and go.  Rarely check on us to see how we were doing. The busboys/water boy were pretty friendly. Actually the other servers were quit lively with their tables. \nNow here the worst part, the bill.  We look at the bill and there at the bottom, a hand written extra charge. Hmm what is this? No description, just a written amount added to the printed check(look at picture). I asked the gentleman server was this a tip? He says yes. I am now surprised, a tip is added for a party of 2?! His explanation was... Well we get a lot of tourist, so we just suggest it.  Ok? So You just add a tip for small tables also? He says we aren't obligated to give it, smiles and leaves. Seriously? This was the first time I have ever seen this. I asked the tables around us who got their bills and none of them had the written tip. So why us? Our neighbors joked that maybe it's because we had a large bill. I work in the food industry. This is not something we would ever do. And because I'm in the industry I still give her the 15% tip she suggested. Although... I would have gave her more. Even with the lack of attention.   I almost didn't want to give her a tip at all. This really irritated me. \n\nSo Nicks lighthouse, this will be the last time I visit your restaurant.

We shoved ourselves and our bags in the corner and the kids order the cheeseburger meal, hamburger meal, shrimp pasta and pasta.  I ordered a side of garlic fried potatoes, garlic bread and a cup of clam chowder.  As we waited for our food, the smoke from people smoking outside drifted into our dining space.  When I asked if they had to keep the door open, the waiter said he had to keep at least one door open...while the other waiter proceeded to fold the clean napkins with his butt facing directly to my left just 2' away from my elbow.  My thighs may be thick but the draft from the door still made me shiver and grumpy.  When the bread came, we grabbed it like starving hyenas only to find out the butter provided was colder than the air outside, unable to spread onto the sourdough, chewy dinner bread.  So...as we waited for the rest of our food, I noticed the thickness of the sticky, clumpy looking dust bunnies that gathered on the ceiling panels, around the ceiling vents and frosted on the decor all around the room.  When the garlic fried potatoes aka garlic fried came, it was a small serving for the $5.95 I paid (Harvey's had a bigger portion that looked fresher for the same price).  We feasted on it and my nephew even ate the chunks of garlic and scallions. The clam chowder was then served in a cup and it was ok but small for the $6.95 price, nothing worth bragging.  The appetizer garlic bread was proportionally small, super oily and salty and looked like it sat in the oven too long.  The aftermath of chewing that bread felt like chewing the same gum for 2 hours, and not the Bubblicious kind but the Trident kind that comes in tiny cubes that runs out of flavor in 3 minutes.  Finally, when I was done with appeasing my stomach, I had to use the restroom.  OMG! There was only room for 1 person to stand and wait in the aisle for either bathrooms so I waited in walking traffic between customers, waiters and others that had to pee.  Once inside, it was just big enough to sit on the toilet and stand to wash my hands...luckily I'm petite but a thicker version but still fit in there.  It was finally over.  We paid which included the 15% gratuity the waiter graciously included for us for the service/butt traffic that crossed us several time while eating our meal (\"butt traffic\" meaning people having to turn to their side either facing their crotch or butt to move along the walkway by our table).

None of them remember the restaurant, but all of them said they ate fresh, delicious seafood with gusto.\n\nWhich is what got my mother started on this whole seafood thing; when she came up to visit a couple weeks later, her only request was to have seafood at Fisherman's Wharf.  It didn't matter which restaurant, but she wanted seafood.\n\nFine.\n\nAfter a few withering looks at my mother, I agreed to take her to the heart of the action and we walked down Taylor, looking inside the restaurants to see if there were any open tables.  It was Thursday around 2:30 PM, so I was surprised to see most of the restaurants super crowded; one even said they only had bar seating.\n\nSo we saw some open tables at Nick's and walked in.  My mother requested \"fresh seafood, like lobsters, crabs and oysters\" and our waiter suggested the Imperial Platter ($110), which included one lobster, one crab, a bunch of shrimp, oysters, clams, and he'd throw in either soup or salad for us.\n\nSince I don't eat much seafood or shellfish (I'm actually allergic to lobster and oysters), I can't comment on the price of the whole platter, but it was seriously enormous to the point where I was questioning if we would actually be able to finish it all, even though we didn't order anything else.\n\nI received the shrimp louie salad as my starter, and my mom got the clam chowder, which she really enjoyed.  My salad wasn't bad either, especially when they brought out a hunk of crusty sourdough for me to dip in the remainder of my Italian dressing.  Then came the platter, and between the two of us, we managed to finish the whole thing: I polished off the shrimp and crab (which was gigantic and had plenty of meat in the legs and body), and my mom ate the HUGE lobster and the clams/oysters.

Um, wipe your seats down please! My waitress even saw me get up and start wiping whatever it was off my pants and making quite a fuss out of it...and she walked right by me. No questions, no concerns. Also, when I tried waiving her down to take my order she just kind of waved me away and said she'd come back, but I had to waive her down once more. And at the end when we got our check, she pointed out a paper to us in a condescending tone, \"This shows you how to tip in America\". HELLO if you would maybe pay attention while talking to your customers, you would notice that I spoke perfect English? I don't know if she was being racist because she was giving exceptional service to the caucasion couple in front of me.\n\nBesides the lacking customer service, the food is pretty decent:\nLobster bisque in bread bowl - They actually give you the stuffing of the breadbowl whereas some places do not. I've only hd lobster bisque twice in my life and unlike my first time, it was delicious!\nLinguine marinara - served with red peppers and cocktail shrimo, really good! definitely recommend.\nSadly, their Boston clam chowder disappointed.

I ordered the Lobster Bisque bread bowl, but wasn't impressed. I expected more substance to it. It was soupy, needs more spices, and wasn't fresh. I also tasted my friends' crab chowder and the clam chowder. Both were okay, but between the 3, I would go crab chowder with the because it tasted more natural with chunks of crab and also because it is more appropriately spiced. The clam chowder is also okay with less texture to it. Lobster bisque was a disappointment. Large bread bowls are ~$8 for the lobster and ~$9 for the clam/crab\n\nThe chowder I had in Seattle was a lot more fresh and creamy than at Nick's Lighthouse. My biggest problem with this place is the freshness of the chowder. You would think being situated in Fisherman's Wharf that they'd have better chowder? Guess not. I'll try other places before coming here again.\n\nSERVICE [4/5 stars]: I found a small strand of hair in my bread bowl. I notified my waiter and he began to poke around it as if he didn't believe me. However, he didn't ask me any further questions and quickly got me a new one. I think the service here is pretty good--I really liked that he didn't ask questions; but it did bother me that he had to inspect it as if he doubted my judgment.

Here it is I can't find a good job as a waiter because I don't \"have the 3+ years experience\" on paper, yet alot of these \"good\" restaurants give the very crappy waitstaff a chance just because they have the \"experience\". It pisses me off. Our waitress never came back to our table during the meal, PASSED BY US LOOKING at us but did not stop at our table to check on us (she was not busy. At all. The other tables she had she halfway tended to as well them disappeared somewhere), and gave me short, snippy attitude-like answers when I asked a few questions in beginning. Had to flag her down for more drink.\n\nThe look of the restaurant is no where near superb, then again it's Fisherman's Wharf do you expect to sit in plush cotton or silk booths??  \n\nI may only return because of lunch specials and clam chowder, but really should not return because of their stupid rules about not sharing (some $10 min order, then $2 if you SHARE an entree??

We were seated at a booth right by the bar, where apparently, the employees eat and speak loudly to the man doing the books at the other side of the counter.  It was distracting and rude and we felt boxed in by the employee sitting there.  I could hear the man behind the bar complaining to the on break employee that business was slow and he wasn't making any money.  Not really something to be talking about with customers in earshot.\n\nI ordered the Crab and shrimp stuffed caneloni and my husband ordered the smoked salmon linguini.  While waiting for our meal we had a cup of lobster bisque with sourdough bread.  The bread was blackened/burnt.  The soup was super salty and tasted like it came from a can.  I did not detect any lobster in my soup.  I've made lobster bisque and I can attest this soup was not homemade or fresh.\n\nWhile waiting for our meal I noticed the lights and grapes on the ceiling had layers of dust caked on them, the wooden walls were filthy and peeling, the booths were dirty and torn and the cramped tiny restaurant had a dingy smell of filth.  When was the last time anyone cleaned the carpets or dusted? Yuck.\n\nOur food came out suspiciously quick, as if it had been premade and sitting under a warmer.  My cannellonis looked delicious, but tasted like nothing.  There was no seasoning at all, the two small cannellonis were bland.  One bite tasted like rotten food, so I spit it out.  Disgusting.  There was a side of broccoli which also had no seasoning whatsoever.\n\nMy husband's salmon linguini had more flavor, thanks to the salmon.  It was more edible than mine but was definitely not memorable and not worth the price.  I only ate one bite of my food but my waitress didn't even bother to ask if I liked my food.\n\nAwful place that I would not waste my time/money on again.  Just thinking about the experience makes me lose my appetite.  I had high hopes for Nick's, but next time, I'll be smart and go get some yummy Boudin.

Me and my bf were walking around fishermans wharf looking for food when this place caught my eye. Because out of all the other seafood places, this one looked the most fresh. \n Anyways, I wanted lobster and all they had were the big ones so we ended up choosing that one. We were just gonna eat outside but seeing the restaurant is connected and it would be less messy, we decided to eat our order inside. We had a older server (a Filipino old man) who wrote down the lobster and half dozen oysters we ordered. He gave us bread and soup, but forgot about our waters. So we asked the busboy for water and he gave us attitude. \n Our waiter was not there helping us out the majority of time, the only thing he really did was give us soup and the food. He didn't check up on us and wasn't the friendliest. After we finished our food, we asked for our check. \n The check came to a total of 215.00 for the lobster and etc. No big deal because it's San Francisco and when you're eating at a tourist attraction, of course it'll be much pricier. However, we saw on the second receipt a service charge of 28.00 was written which I guess was the tip he wanted us to give him. I was not going to give this man that much tip. He didn't provide the best service and was expecting to be given that much tip for giving us bread and soup. I at least gave him a four dollar tip for bringing the soup to us. He stood there and didn't want us to leave. He kept on telling us that's the service charge. But the thing is, we didn't know there was going to be a service charge and he definitely did not deserve the tip! So we kept on telling him that was all we were going to give and he sighed really loud letting us know he's annoyed and walked away. \n WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Like I said before, If he was there the majority of the time we were eating to make sure we were doing okay, then yeah I would give him that tip. But, he didn't do anything really and was expecting the tip to be handed to him. I'm pretty sure that's not the way it works here. The food is good, the service is HORRIBLE, and they definitely need to work on the layout too. They're trying to be a high class restaurant by the wharf, but the inside of the restaurant was not the cleanest and their servers are definitely sketchy. Lesson of the day is always make sure you check the receipt so they don't charge you something without telling you.", "author": "Karebear W."}

What we found was so much more.\n\nWalking through the fog past all the vendors and the smell of the sea we walked into Nick's with no expectation other than hunger for crab. We ordered a couple Caesar salads, Lobster Bisque and fresh Whole Crab with a bevy of butter to dip into on the side. There is nothing like chewy crusty sour dough bread, slathered with a little butter, paired with the briny sweetness of Dungeness crab with a spritz of lemon on it.    They boil crab continuously and it smells great as you approach the restaurant.  \nThe saut\u00e9ed filet of sole is my absolute favorite preparation:  capers, butter and lemon - the sour tartness with the fresh fish would be one of my favorite tastes.\n\nKeep in mind Mark and I had worked together for over 10 years opening up restaurant's throughout the country. This was and is one of the best meals I have ever eaten. Great attentive unpretentious service, not a 5 star restaurant though a 5 star experience with a good friend, that's all you need.\n\nSince then I have introduced countless friends and family to a small jewel in San Francisco.\nI look forward to my next visit and will continue to... \"\n \n\nThe environs:  great walking area just don't trip on the tacky tourists - this spot has authentic roots even though its surrounded by tackfest.  Great to walk along the wharf.  Best to get there on foot on bike.  Parking will run almost $40 for the day.  Cutest place to stay in the Wharf area is the Kimpton Argonaut hotel.  Charming and stylish in a sea of corporate sameness.  My favorite time to visit the wharf is before Easter.  The area blooms with an amazing display of tulips, all along the water.  I used to make a special trip down on my bike after work to view these beauties with the backdrop of the bay and the bridge, fresh air blowing in my face.  Two more favorite to do's in the area:  visit the gorgeous frog and mermaid sculpture in Ghirardelli Square one of my mother and grand mothers favorites, and stop in and see the chocolate making process in the Ghirardelli restaurant.  Smell the giant vat of chocolate being \"conched\" (refined).", "author": "Bradley B."}

The redheaded waitress said to us, \"Sorry, you haven't ordered enough food. We can only serve you if you order a minimum of $10 per person.\"\n\nI'm not usually one to make a scene but this pissed me off so much that I asked to speak to her manager because the restaurant was half empty. She refused to allow me to speak with her manager, who was actually the guy out the front giving out the free samples and inviting people inside. She replied \"My manager is very strict about this.\" So in disbelief we had no other choice and stood up and left.\n\nWhat despicable service.

Unfortunately, it was just O-K.\n\nI ordered the crab chowder in a bread bowl, and my BF ordered the clam chowder. The crab chowder was flavorful enough, but lacking any significant evidence of crab. Most of the crab in the chowder seemed like it was those tiny shredded flakes of the leftovers that they would normally stuff into a sandwich.  My BF seemed satisfied with his clam chowder, but didn't rave on about it.\n\nMy main issue with this place, and with chowder bread bowls in general, is there is never enough soup to thoroughly enjoy all of the bread.  So I ordered a 2nd bowl, and this time I went with the clam chowder.  It was good, but I've had better in Monterey.\n\nOur server seemed rushed and uninterested in us, or in the tip we might leave him. When I ordered the 2nd bowl of soup so I could enjoy the rest of my bread, he pointed out the tear in my bread bowl and said the soup would all pour out.  I assured him I was aware of the tear and would add additional soup at a slow rate, so as not to make a mess.

This is our second time coming here and the crab dont disappoint each time. We order two crab on spicy and the other one reg for the kids. I love how the spicy flavor merries together and you can taste a hint of beer in between it was so yummy with lemon squeezed all over too. We also got a mix fried platter combo that came with fries fried shrimp popcorn shrimp fried fish calamaris but it wasnt from here it was from china station just a few steps away. The staff here was friendly but i caught one of them picking his nose then he went and got a lobster thank god he wasnt the one handling our food. Not too mention he licked his dirty lil fingers after he picked his nose too. I found that disgusting lmao my sister and I was laughing at him. Besides all that this place is on the pier it gets pretty packed here if you dont want to stand on the side to eat you can opt to dine inside. We did the outside since we were sightseeing and headed to the goldengate bridge after. The line do get pretty long here but they have the best spicy crab and garlic butter crab.", "author": "Mary S."}

Quite frankly all these restaurants seemed great, I bet each would offer a great meal.  Nick's for whatever reason seemed to have the longest line, that was really our only differentiating factor.  Nick's also offered a crab chowder, so we figured why not.  The seating here is not very comfortable, the table is very small and everyone is packed as tightly as possible. We tried the crab chowder and their lobster bisque.  Both were excellent, the crab had nice chunks of crab meat and potatoes.  For entree we tried the classic cioppino, the tomato sauce had the right mixture of alcohol, cream, and acidity.  The stew contained wild scallops, salmon, jumbo shrimp, and mussels.  It was a very solid dish.  Afterwards we had the chili half cracked crab, which was very good as well.

We eyed all the crab cakes, fish and chips, shrimp/crab cocktails, po boy sandwiches.... all looked delectable.  When I saw the whole crab, my mouth was drooling!  I stopped drooling when I saw the price tag at $12.95/pound!  If each crab was approx 1-1/2 to 2 pounds each, we'd be paying over $20 for it!  Although my love for crab is deep, I wasn't in love with the price. \n\nWe opted for plain fish and chips, so we went for the \"red carpet\" feeling, as that's what they were saying to entice people to eat at the restaurant.  They explained their fish being dipped in beer and a special flour mixture before deep frying.  The guy who worked there (found out he's from Fiji) told me that if we didn't like it, he wouldn't charge us.   So we tried it, as I didn't want the bread crumby dry looking fish out on the street.  When it came out, it wasn't what I expected.  It didn't have the flakey crispy batter on the outside of the fish.  Meh - it was okay.  We ate it though, and they still charged us for it.\n\nWe also had the clam chowder and the lobster bisque.  Clam chowder was really rich and creamy.  Delicious!  The lobster bisque tasted like cream of tomato soup.  Not much lobster flavor at all.  The free sour dough bread tasted really good when you dipped it in the soup!\n\nFor $22, it was okay.  We got more food for eating in the restaurant, than eating outside.  So I guess it wasn't too bad. \n\nThe one thing I really didn't like are the tables.  The seats in the booth are really close to the tables, and you can't move either the chair or the table.  Plus, the seat is so short (not long enough from your butt to your knees), so you are sitting really straight, and it's really uncomfortable if you have a bad back.\n\nOh, one more thing, the owner (or whomever) was yelling at the workers to clean the bathrooms because a customer complained about it.  I don't think you should be yelling in the dining room to clean the restrooms in front of all the patrons.  Just not something I want to hear when I'm eating my food.\n\nOverall thought?

Our waiter brings her food back and proceeds to tell us that the kitchen was closed so he did something special for her. I got the Saute Shellfish Platter which sounded good when they described it on the menu, but  In reality i wouldn't serve this dish to my dog. this is how they described the dish i ordered, Saute Shellfish Platter Dungeness Crab Legs, Tiger Prawns, Sea Scallops, Calamari & Fresh Fish. They lumped all of the fish together in some indistinguishable blob and added bay shrimp to it which cooked down to nothing. My meal as a whole was inedible and the only thing that was edible was the sourdough bread. I do not recommend this place to anyone unless you want a disgusting overpriced dinner in cramped booths.

The service was laughably bad. \n\nAs a local now for more than year, I should have known better than to go to the Wharf for seafood. Next time I have family in town looking for good seafood, I'll choose to go to any number of the slightly more expensive restaurants where I know we'll get better food, service and a nice bay view.\n\nThe good: We got seated right away and the food didn't take longer than expected to reach our table, for the most part (see below for exception). And nobody got sick. (Think positively, right?)\n\nNow to be fair, our server was bad enough that he should have been fired. So assuming so, your experience will hopefully be pleasantly uneventful! \n\nThe bad: It started with two waiters telling us separately that they'd be right with us. I wish the other guy got the table... The guy who eventually won out forgot to give us our appetizers before the entrees, and only brought them when we pointed it out. He gave us at least one wrong entree at first. For another entree I'm pretty sure he lied on the spot and said it was the correct fish (\"Uh, what did you have? ...Sure yeah it's that.\") At one point he just put a bowl of clam chowder on the table that the kitchen accidentally made. \"On the house!\" Random. \n\nTo make up for all this he offered us some lobster (but actually grabbed us crab from outside) and $10 off, which he did partly by changing the entrees to cheaper options (including what we suspected the actual fish to be in the b.s.-ed fish entree) and slipping us $4 in cash. Huh?\n\nThe worst part was that he messed up splitting our the bill between two cards. The first try, the sum was way over the total bill. After we pointed this out, he said he voided the first charge and re-charged them the correct amount. When we asked for the confirmation of the voided charges he responded by saying \"We've been here for more than 80 years.\" I'm sure you have, but that has nothing to do with proving you canceled the charges. \n\nSure enough, today we found out one card was charged twice and the other card was charged only the first, higher amount.

The soup could have been a bit more flavorful since I'm dipping bread in it, but I was quite satisfied with how fast it filled me up. Don't let the size of it fool you because it's much more filling than you think. Although there aren't any seats since this is an outdoor market, the price of only $6 per bread bowl made up for it. My first experience eating clam chowder bread bowl was great, so I think this is the place to go the next time I'm craving for something like this.

We were staying at the Omni and the referred us to Nick's, telling us all about a cauldron and an \"experience\" and la-de-da-de-da. \n\nSo, we went there even though we weren't keen on being trampled by tourists taking pictures of seagulls. Once we got there, I didn't see any such cauldron, but it was mostly because I was too scared that one of those shiny, painted men were going to jack my wallet. \n\nThey asked us if we wanted to go inside and we opted in, since the amount of flying rats upped the odds of getting poop in our food. \n\nWhen we got inside, it felt really crowded. When they sat us at a table, it felt like you had to sit straight up or you'd run the risk of getting bruised from the table edges pressing into your ribcage. \n\nThe decor was cute, but kind of bipolar. There were these really cute grape lights, like a wine country theme...but then there were also airplanes hanging from the ceiling. I'm sure there must be some relevance, but it was lost on me. I didn't see a lighthouse in sight. (Really, though..I could have been IN a lighthouse and not noticed, because I was too concerned with how to crawl past all of the people inside in the case of a fire.)\n\nThe food was okay. We split a whole dungeoness crab ($30), and a 1/3 of a load of sourdough bread, a cup of lobster bisque, and an order of onion rings. The crab was good, the bread was warm upon arrival, but the outside quickly got H.A.R.D, the bisque tasted like tomato soup with a weird lobster aftertaste (I'm sure Gordon Ramsay would go all crazy and slam it down and swear about it if he'd been there..) and the onion rings didn't really taste like anything. They were served with some thick, nasty ranch dressing and the waitress forgot to put them on the ticket, so they arrived after we were done with everything else.\n\nThe last thing I've got to comment on is the bathroom. There is an old curtain over by the pick-up window and the bathrooms are in a VERY NARROW hallway behind it. The bathrooms themselves are the size of a small coat closet.

And, while Nick's was doing brisk business, it wasn't a great meal by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nThe chowder was, unfortunately, fairly tasteless and watery. The crab cakes were far from fresh and were like a mouthful of sand in consistency.

The Ice Cream man was out and so was the corn/ mango lady in her homemade push cart.. We needed to get out the house and take advantage of the perfect Bay weather. So the folks and I decided to play tourist and head across the bridge to peep out the scenery one time .\n\nWe ended up near the cannary, pier 39, fishermans wharf area.\nI tried a few of these crab joints back in the days. They mostly have the same items but different flavors. We ended up at Nicks Lighthouse near the end because the other joints had lines that were ridiculously long. We ate at the food stand in front, not the restaurant. A few of us ordered the calamari/ fries, crab cakes, fried shrimps, fish sandwich, raw oysters and clam chowder.\n\nI myself got the clam chowder in the breadbowl. It was around six dollars. The taste was OKKK, It should of been more thicker and pack with more flavors. Some of the folkers hated on the chowder pretty hard. But it wasnt that bad.. and I wasnt mad... I was hungry, the sun was shinin, and thats all that mattered. And also, this chowder doesnt hit the back of the throat like filthy Campbells and Progressos.I also had samples of the other thangs that were ordered. Fried calamari and crab cake were pretty good. But really, everything was what I expected. Your typical fried stuff, fish n chips style., nothing special. Didnt get to try the fresh crab though, Maybe next time.  The portions were good sizes.\nIf I can remember correctly awhile back, I think Vendor #1 or #2 had the best clam chowder and fried calamari but I forgot the names of the restuarants.\n\nAfterwards, We did the tourist thing, peeped out the streets and piers. The silver robot dudes, break dancer crews, bush man, and those folk tale singing band guys. Alot of fob/ european tourists with cameras/ camcorders out and about all day. It was pretty nice, havent been out there in awhile.\n\nSo anyways, all these things were just teasers. The folks and I decided to head back to the town and stop by Lucky Seafood to pick up two boxes of oysters and do up a BBQ live. And we did.\n\nBasically, a friend of mine makes a much meaner chowder than this joint. Its called \"The Ms Trans Famous Clam Chowder(tm)\" which is much muy delicioso. (Trademarked 2008. Oakland, California U.S.A)\n\nSo 3 Stars Nick, thats all you get mang''\nI might be back, I dont know..only time will tell", "author": "Rudy R."}

There wasn't much room between me and the table.  We also sat next to the restroom.  The lady in the women's restroom was taking her sweet time so I peeked in the men's restroom.  I saw a pubic hair on the rim.  Okay... I decided to wait.  The restroom was tiny.  It was slightly larger than a restroom on the plane.  \n\nWe had the fried calamari, clam chowder, the spicy crab, a beer, and a glass of wine. The food was just okay.  For Fisherman's Wharf, I kind of expected the clam chowder to be better.  The crab was not so fresh.  It had been previously cooked and reheated.  I like my crab freshly cooked after I order it.  It makes a big difference and I can tell.\n\nService was slow at first, but he was attentive thereafter.  He constantly changed our plates of the crab shell.  I sensed a little bit of attitude as he told us to wait when we asked for the check .\n\nWhen the check came, a tip of 15% was added to the bill for a total of $85.

The lobster tanks outside were a pretty big drawing card, but in retrospect, I doubt they actually had anything to do with the restaurant. The interior was old-timey and comfortable. The creaking floorboards and mish-mash of wall decorations gave it a legit feel, like old sea-faring fisherman might have once eaten there. But if the food was anything like it is today, they probably would have left without paying. \n\nI got soup in a bread bowl, as tourism dictates, and the bread was good (it was from the bakery across the street, which serves its own, probably better soups). The lobster bisque, however, was pretty terrible. It had the flavor of tart tomato soup and had weird hard bits of something in it. I speculate, with ample disgust, that they were parts of lobster shell, based on their appearance. I got this disturbing mental image of somebody throwing a whole, live lobster into a blender with a few cans of tomato paste and pushing \"liquefy.\" I ended up dining mostly on the top and outer edges of the sourdough bowl. \n\nThe place was also more expensive than the food and service seemed to justify. I guess if it's on the water, they can charge whatever. The saltwater and barnacles/wood and vinyl atmosphere gives you enough of the fisherman experience that you don't need to order a breadbowl. Go there for the mood, not the food (I don't mean that to be a rhyming catchphrase) and just get a couple beers. Or at the very least, opt for the clam chowder.", "author": "Colleen D."}

However, everything else is kind of a letdown.\n\nFirst of all, the staff is so aggressive trying to get people to come in that it kind of felt like I was force dragged in even though I was intending to eat here anyway.  Sitting down at the table, we had to shoo away at least three flies that were running around our table.  Our waiter was not very friendly, and after we ordered the fish and chips with lobster bisque and a crab chowder, he asked \"That's it?  Nothing good?\" as if he was disappointed that we did not spend an arm and a leg on the whole lobster that he offered us as a the daily special.  First he got the order wrong and gave us clam chowder instead, which we said was fine as long as we didn't get charged the extra cost for crab chowder.  We did not get sourdough bread to start with nor with the fish and chips meal like we were supposed to, and our waiter seemed annoyed that we asked for it.  We also did not get water until we asked for it midway through the meal.  After finishing, we sat there with empty plates for 15 minutes with our waiter (and other waiters) passing by us and paying absolutely no attention.  Finally, they did not want to validate our parking because we were a couple dollars short of $10/person.\n\nThe service was so poor that the food didn't really even matter too much at that point.  But just to note, the fish was not breaded very well, was a bit soggy by the time we got it, and did not taste particularly fresh.  The clam chowder was nothing special.

While Alioto's and Scoma's get alot of attention, they're too fancy and pricey for the everyday diner like me. Nick's has two dining options - the restaurant and the food stand outside.\n\nThe restaurant: \n- Crab Louie is amazingly crisp, cool and fresh. They are very generous with the shrimp and the garbanzo beans and strips of red beet add an unexpected texture and flavor. I'm not sure if they make their dressing in house, but it's fantastic. I've tried to replicate it at home, but I can't quite get it right.\n- Seafood pastas are generously portioned, and their seafood (prawns, scallops, clams, mussels) couldn't be any fresher if you plucked them out of the water yourself. I'm able to taste the slightest trace of fishiness, which is why I won't eat seafood from just anywhere. \n- Fish and chips - crisp and not overly \"bready\". The outside is fried just right without overcooking the fish inside. Topped off perfectly with steak cut fries\n- Service is attentive and I've never had to wait for a seat. For two people, the bill is usually between $40-$45 (including tip) without alcohol.\n- Three hours validated parking at the lot across the street.\n\nThe food stand: \nEven though I have the option to eat inside, sometimes I prefer the experience of eating my food (while standing) out of a paper carton, huddled in the crowd on the sidewalk watching the tourists, snacking seagulls, and street performers that make the area so distinctly San Francisco. \n\nFood options at the stand are limited to what you can eat while standing... \n- fish/shrimp and chips\n- clam chowder (in a cup or bread bowl but I recommend the bread bowl)\n- ceviche-style seafood salad marinated in lemon juice\n\n\nEverything is fresh, flavorful and tasty. You can exoect to pay about $20-$25 for two people AND you get one hour of validated parking at the lot across the street.

Which I totally misheard as \"Red Bull\" which is the reason I agreed to get my skinny beautiful butt out to the wharf.

So that alone, was a bad thing.\n\nI dislike Europeans so much because they are so slow. In a tiny restaurant where everyone is waiting for a table an European couple took their sweet time taking out quarters, 5 dollar bills, and 1 dolla bills trying to figure out a tip when they had put it on charge. They double checked, they took their glasses and made sure not a single drop or soda, was left in the glass. I was getting so mad.\n\nThe Red Bull Bread Bowl was nothing good.

We were headed to Chowder Hut across the street when a man with broken English waved us toward him in front of what looked like a fish market bazaar. He pointed at the menu items and it seemed good, we asked him if they carried any beer, to which he replied \"we have a full bar.\" So we were sold! The beer that they carried for \"a full bar \"only included Budweiser, modelo and corona. That isn't what we consider a fully stalked bar but we were already sat so I ordered anyway. I got a Bloody Mary and the linguini with mussels in a white wine sauce. The linguini had no flavor whatsoever! I added salt, pepper, butter, lemon and hot sauce before it was edible ! The mussels tasted like they were frozen then recooked. They had a strong fishy taste and odor to them. Not fresh at all considering that we were at Fishermans Warf. My boyfriend ordered a Long Island ice tea, he asked if we could add a shot of Jaegermeister to it which the server said that shouldn't be a problem.We got the bill to find out they charged us $10 to add one shot to our drink. Not once did the waitress let us know that they would charge extra for that, let alone $10. We also noticed while we were drinking it that it didn't we really couldn't taste the jaeger. So we asked to speak to the manger. He came over holding a dirty shot glass telling us that they had put one shot in our drink and that it cost $10. I told him that was ridiculous, and  that a bottle cost that much and that we are not going to pay that much for a drink alteration. He began to make a scene in his own restaurant  and yelled us. He eventually gave in before he stormed off. Not to mention the waitress never checked up on us, filled up our waters, asked if we wanted desert or smiled at us once.

We drove, so we parked at the Pier 39 parking which had 1 hour free parking with validation. Eating clam chowder would not take one hour so it was perfect. We came to the stand and first asked if they did validation for Pier 39 parking. They first said they weren't too sure but then they confirmed that they did. Great but then they added that they had a $10 minimum purchase policy for clam chowder. No big deal since there was 5 of us and we were going to share. So we ordered a clam chowder with bread bowl and a popcorn shrimp. The total was $13.\n\nActual food review: The chowder was good and the shrimp was generic. The chowder had a good flavor and was decently chunky. Warning: The popcorn shrimp is deceivingly big because it has a bed of curly fries underneath all the shrimp. Not worth the $6.50 (approx.) that they charge. \n\nWe finished up and went back to the parking lot. Thinking we were all validated we went to exit the lot but the machines said they could not read the validation card. We had to call over the attendant and ask to figure out what was wrong. After the attendant came back with the card, he told us that the card got corrupted/ruined and that there was no validation. We had to pay $7 for the parking.\n\nAs a result I am furious. I may be a little harsh but the people working at Nick's essentially scammed us into buying an extra item by lying to us that they validated for Pier 39. Because they lied we lost another 7 dollars on top of the 6.50 that we paid for the popcorn shrimp that we would have never bought.\n\nSure this may have been an isolated case but if Nick's employees are willing to lie for a quick buck even once, I would avoid this place. There are plenty of other places to get some good/better clam chowder.", "author": "Samuel J."}

Nick's however was still open so we went into the restaurant to stay out of the cold.  \n\nAlthough we came here originally for clam chowder, we ended up ordering half a dozen oysters on the half shell, a cup of crab chowder, a cup of lobster bisque, and their sourdough garlic bread.\n\nThe oysters came first and I was excited to see how big they were.  But the cocktail sauce, which tasted too much like ketchup, kind of ruined it for me.  Why would cocktail sauce taste like ketchup?!  Good thing I still had my Tabasco and lemon.  Otherwise, a fit would've ensued.  Lol.\n\nOur bread came next.  2 slices, heavily coated with butter, garlic and basil.  It was good but honestly, $4 for 2 thin slices of bread?!  It's bread for crying out loud!  2 more slices wouldn't hurt!  Maybe I'm just too used to complimentary bread when I eat out.  Like in Dolce's, Ketchup, Morton's, Cheesecake, and even CPK.  Oh pooey.\n\nNext came our small cups of crab chowder and lobster bisque.  The crab chowder kind of tasted like clam chowder.  Except it's crab.  Or at least that's what they claim is in there.  The lobster bisque on the other hand was really good with its strong flavorful lobster taste.  Don't expect to find any pieces of crab or lobster in the chowders although you will find cubes of potatoes.\n\nIt was about $31, not including tip, for the little seafood we were able to indulge in.  For the price, I will not be coming here again since I know there are better places adjacent to Nick's.

Man - he LOVES Dungeness crab! Anyways, I brought him to this area where there are 4-5 different street vendors selling everything seafood - crabs, oyster, calamari, crab cakes, clam chowder.  As we were browsing through, someone from Nick's Lighthouse was screaming for us to dine at their restaurant.  We just wanted some Dungeness crab and calamari, that's it.  I asked the guy if we would get the same deal inside the restaurant as we would if we purchased the same food from their street vendor and he said yes.  So my husband decided to try it out.  At least we can sit somewhere and eat.\n\nOkay, so here goes the experience....\nIt was a nice beautiful day in SF, beezy but sunny.  As soon as we stepped inside, it was dark.  The restaurant has their lights dimmed, in the middle of the afternoon.  C'mon.  I wanted to enjoy the sun.  We sat at a booth near the door.  Our booth was super cramped.  My husband and I were busy stepping on each other's feet and it sucks when you are wearing flip flops. Ouch!  When the waitress came by to take our order, I asked for the price of the Dungeness crab.  They sell a 1.5 lbs crab for $27.50.  Outside they sold it for $10.99 per pound.  But they had to iterate that the order comes with a salad.  As for the calamari, the menu stated that it cost $11 & change, while the vendor sold it for $7.99.  My husband felt bad to leave, so we decided to stay and try it out.\n\nCouple of complaints:\n1.  The salad that came with the crab was soggy.  The leaves look wilted.  Appearance was not appealing.\n2.  We order a half crab (3/4 lbs).  The plate was huge, but the portion was small.  They covered the whole plate with wilted salad and a few pieces of crab.\n3.  Calamari, horrible.  No flavor.  Appearance: not good.  It look like they just grabbed a bunch of squid, battered it, and tossed it in the fryer.  The calamari was still doughy all clumped together.\n4.  Service, horrible.  The waitress came by only to take our drink order, food order, and to deliver our meal.  She didnt come by anything in between to ask if everything was ok.  I needed a refill on my drink and I had to track her down.\n\nCompliment:\nOnly one.  ONLY the crab tasted good.  but how can you screw up its natural flavor????\nOhh wait, there's one more.  The complimentary sourdough bread was decent.\n\nOverall, the experience at this restaurant sucked for me.  I would never go back there.\n\nIf anyone happens to visit Fisherman's Wharf and wants Dungeness crab, just stick with the street vendors.  The guys that call out to you only wants to lure you into their restaurant and spend twice as much for the same food as their vendor.\n\nAs for a recommendation of where to get the best Dungeness crab..... anywhere.

Where else can you immerse into total tourism, kitschy stores, bright lights, all day long and long into the night and man, everyone is always so happy bc they are all on vacation!  \n\nMonday night at 7:30 pm, super quiet all around the wharf, but as always at the heart of the wharf, the first few street stands and corresponding small-ish casual dining rooms are stil bustling.  We cruised the strip, and the touter at Nick's seemed nice enough.  Sure, the booth would have been cramped for more than 2, clear sound of lots of dishes banging around in the kitchen, very kitchsy grape-shaped lights, but our waitress was super friendly and I like the charm of all the random old SF photos and posters, new and old.  \n\nWarm sourdough bread.  Ah, the taste of sourdough is a true reminder of where we are.  Despite (or esp?) with the fancy new Boudin bakery building in view just across the street.  Why does sourdough bread beg for slathering of butter?  \n\n13.95 for Red Snapper special, allegedly sauteed in garlic, lemon, butter, and caper sauce, was *exactly* what I expected:  totally mediocre.  Not that flavorful, squeezed lots of lemon on, capers weren't that salty, sauce was bland.  I always do enjoy the super fluffy Uncle-Ben's type rice, soaked in more lemon.  Steamed veggies were pretty ok.  Bowl of clam chowder that came with my meal was thick, a little salty, but flavorful.  And the right oyster crackers!\n\n11.95 for Fresh Fish and Chips special:  ok.  Breaded in cornmeal, the fries were OK, the fish was OK, the cole slaw was OK, the tartar sauce was pretty good.  Bowl of lobster bisque that came with this meal was again thick, a little salty, but still flavorful.  Again, those oyster crackers!\n\nIce cold water through a super skinny red mixer straw was fun.  \n\nSo, the food was probably more like 2 stars, but it's exactly what you get, and I add one star bc I love the wharf.  The place was packed the entire time we were there, the booth seats slide up when you slide forward a little bit, not to mention were a little saggy, but seriously, you don't go to these little strip restaurants for the food, do you?

Because of my first experience My BF and I (along with sister and brother in law) decided to make a stop here again since we had such a great first experience...boy were we SADLY DISAPPOINTED.\n\n2nd experience: We decided since my sister is pregnant to sit inside and eat rather than enjoy the outdoor stand up informal curb side brown baggie beer that we did last time. It's way little inside. The waiter was HORRIBLE...we waited to even get our drink orders for a good while. refills of water let alone Sodas were impossible. This time around we ordered off the menu, fried calamari, sauteed shellfish platter, new york steak sandwich, fresh blue point oysters, and spinach linguine portifino. DISGUST! The calamari was mediocre..nothing spectacular despite how RIDICULOUSLY OVER PRICED IT WAS. Oysters were not shucked (you would think....a place that charged as much as they do would've shucked them) The sauteed shellfish platter (AGAIN RIDICULOUSLY PRICED) consisted of over cooked crab, TINY (AND I MEAN ITTY BITTY) little shrimp, squid, scallops, and some other stuff thrown together and sooo flavorless. This dish came with vegetables (that were the highlight of the meal for me) and rice..OMG HARD CRUSTY grains of rice. The new york steak was soo plain and sour dough was beyond the normal toughness I just about cut the roof of my mouth. And finally the poritfino was a tasteless disappointment...the linguine honestly had the texture of Chinese egg noodles. After this experience and our HORRIBLE waiter...this place would've EASILY gotten 2 thumbs DOWN if it wasn't for the first experience. NEVER AGAIN will we eat inside if we even eat here ever again. \n\nI'm gonna recommend just the front curb side area if you're interested. The Staff is friendly in the front and have a great sense of humor and the sea food is very fresh. DO NOT SIT INSIDE..you will be greatly disappointed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-08", "description": "If you've never been to Fisherman's Wharf the most popular area there is Pier 39 which has a nice string of booths filled with crab, clam chowder, shrimp cocktails, and all kinds of wonderful fresh seafood. The problem that most people have with said booths are the price.. its really not that cheap. You're looking at a sourdough bread bowl of clam chowder for about $6, a steamed crab at $10 a pound, and a $7 shrimp cocktail. Of course, the attraction is that since the food is so close to the bay its going to be fresher. The crab is definitely going to be fresh before you eat it.. the crab is still very much moving before you heartless wenches snuff out its life in a giant vat of boiling water\n\nHow will Mr. Crab provide for his family if he's dead? *sigh* what a cruel world we live in. But since I am Chinese, I've helped with the genocide of the crab population. =P\n\nIf you've ever been to the strip of booths you would notice that every booth has a restaurant right next to it. Almost every booth (could be every) is actually just a small food outlet for quick eats that is owned by the enjoining restaurant.\n\nSo for our dining enjoyment we picked Nick's Lighthouse. What did we base our decision on?\n\n    * Is there an amazing clam chowder?\n    * Does their crab crack readily beneath your fingertips?\n    * Do they validate 3 hours of parking so you don't have to pay any money for this tourist trap we call Fisherman's Wharf Pier 39 parking?\n\nIf you picked #3, then you know how cheap I am, and you'd be absolutely right. Luckily our choice wasn't a failure since the food actually turned out quite nice.\n\nYou walk past all the boiling vats of water, glasses of shrimp and into a bustling restaurant with tables/seats packed closely together. A table of four is expected to sit at a booth meant for 2 large sized people. With Ryan and I there we already met the requirement so it was a pretty tight squeeze. We quickly ordered because by this time, I haven't had a bite to eat for a good 7 hours (which is an atrocity that always should be immediately rectified).\n\nKathy's main goal in coming to Fisherman's Wharf was to eat clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl (speaking of which has anyone seen the new Bourdin Sourdough Bakery store? WOWSERS! that thing is gigantic!) so she ordered... clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. I asked her if it'd be enough and she nodded yes. (Later we would learn.. it was not enough due to the dent in my entree).\n\nI'm not sure how much Kathy liked the clam chowder but I loved it from the spoonful I took. If you like Monterey Style thin soupy clam chowder this is the chowder for you. I've never been a fan of the thick ultra creamy clam chowder (which Kathy is, but she said she liked it). I like mine thin with a little bit of cream but just packed with clam and potatoes. Luckily this soup met all my expectations! Its the perfect type of clam chowder to put crackers in because the crackers just absorb right in. Usually when its nice and thick the crackers still have their crunch because it can't absorb all that heavy cream.\n\nA+++++ clam chowder! Reminds me of when I was a little boy buying a quart of Monterey Clam Chowder on the Monterey Boardwalk warming up from the steaming goodness.\n\nNext we have a seafood pasta with spinach linguine.\n\nTons and tons of seafood piled in here. Giant Tiger Shrimp, clams, mussels, and diced tomatoes. Just a really great crustacean mix in the pasta. I didn't have the opportunity to try any but it sure did look tasty!\n\nFinally, my dish, something I affectionately call the Heart Attack. A giant heaping serving of cholesterol and death. AKA: Fried Crab Legs, Scallops, Prawns, Oysters, Calamari, and Fish.\n\nThis was heaven on a plate. The crab legs were so moist under the fried batter, when you bite into it and with a lil tug with your teeth, the crab parts like the Red Sea. Just giant chunks of crab legs fried. You don't have to deal with cracking the shell or anything!\n\nGreat pieces of Calamari, the perfect thickness where you can pop it in your mouth, chew a few times and swallow. The scallops were great, the fish was super moist like the crab, and the prawns were giant giant fried shrimp.\n\nI mean .. you really can't go wrong with fried food. The only bad fried seafood is when the meat is just too stringy and disgusting. But its so incredibly hard to mess it up, you really have to go out of your way to buy 1 week old seafood to make it taste bad. The only odd thing was the fried oyster. Its kinda weird when its a little bit crunchy on the outside and then gooey on the inside. *shivers*. Decent quality oysters but the two and two just don't match for me.\n\nThe home made tartar sauce was also A+! Just the right amount of zing to it!\n\nSo if you're ever in the neighborhood and you need your parking validated, give Nick's a try!", "author": "Charlie F."}

Since all the stands serve pretty much the same type of food for the same price, there was no particular reason why we happened to pick this stand. We didn't go into the restaurant; we just ordered crab from the stand. It cost $10.95 per lb, and they expertly chopped up, cleaned, and packed the crab to go. The crab was perfect, really delicious. They gave us some seafood sauce and wedges of lemon, but I didn't like the seafood sauce at all. It tasted a little funky. I know this might sound weird, but I like eating my steamed crab plain or with ketchup. I had saved some ketchup packets from McDonald's earlier in the day, so I was good to go.\n\nMy husband ordered a crab sandwich, which cost about $6.95. He liked it, but I didn't think it was that great. I suggest that you stick to the seafood in its natural form. Next time I might be tempted to try the raw oysters or the other seafood offerings.\n\nI know a lot of the locals complain that Fisherman's Wharf is too touristy, but as a tourist, I think it's great! I love all the tacky souvenier shops, the busy atmosphere, and the seafood stands. I even bought myself a cheap but cute jacket from one of the stalls - I had forgotten how COLD San Francisco can be in the summers.

Right this way!\" We were hypnotized, we followed him. We were seated at the very end of the restaurant (by the kitchen and restroom) and thought, \"Nice! We have a view!\" \n\nA waiter came by to give the menus and to inform us that our waiter will tend to us shortly. Fifteen minutes went by and still no one came.

When I get my card statement, surprise surprise, the charge is there. I call their office and speak with the general manager. He said the no-receipt, free-food policy is there to protect them and not for the benefit of the customer and that they wouldn't reverse the charge. If they have a policy like that, it should be straight forward, and they shouldn't jip a person who calls them on their policy by coming up with a technical excuse. When people think receipt, they think of something that lists what they purchased (the itemized receipt), not the credit card receipt. Just think about it. No one can use a credit card receipt to return an item. Stores always ask for the receipt that lists the items purchased. Like I said ... dishonest. \n\nAs for the food, I ordered the fried calamari and my friends ordered clam chowder.

Their lunch special included a choice between calm chowder or lobster bisque and a shrimp salad. Don't be mistaken by the waiter or waitress. He or she will elusively offer you a soup in a bread bowl without warning you that you have to pay extra for the bread bowl. We made that mistake, an extra 4$ mistake. Dont be fooled into thinking that you will be eating small portions when in fact you will be eating more than you can imagine. The meal included complimentary bread and butter before you can scarf down your bowl of soup and entree. The waitress arrived with our soup as promptly as we ordered. The Lobster Bisque was a delicious bowl of red creamy, hearty soup. However, the lobster seemed to the missing element in the soup, odd for a soup called Lobster Bisque right?\n\nAfter downing a bowl of soup, eating bread from both the bowl and the appetizer, you can't even comprehend why you ordered an entree in the first place. We played it safe, ordering only the Cod and fish. The Cod and fish was coated in a thin, spiced batter and the fries were cooked in a special seasoning. Sadly to say, the fish and chips were not out of the ordinary. However, we give them credits toward their coleslaw. The coleslaw was both sweet, savory, with a tangy kick. The restaurant was a quaint little joint with chairs to small for comfort and a meal bigger than the table can hold. Now we present the verdict; the KB rating. We give Nick's Light House a rating of 2 stars because of its overall service and lack of lobster in a soup labeled lobster. We also rate them a 2 because they did deliver on the amount of food they serve.

After over twenty years of going to this awesome place, the clam chowder hasn't changed and the food is fantastic. On this trip I ordered a bowl of clam chowder with the spicy garlic dungeness crab and it was incredible. It wasn't hot but full of great flavor that danced on my tongue. I always look forward to coming back for more and if you go, try the clam chowder, it's to die for!", "author": "Jay S."}

I ordered a  sourdough bread of chowder and my wife ordered a plate of fish pasta. When the bill came at last we found out there were three separate items on it, 1) the sourdough bread of chowder; 2) the seafood pasta and 3) the fish. I asked the lady server if she made a mistake on my bill by charging our meals, the extra fish that I had not ordered; she then explained to me the seafood pasta came only with plain pasta with sauce but she ordered for us a separate extra Halibut (only 8 small diced pieces) on top of the pasta but charged each item separately as follows: the creamy sauce pasta ($13.90), the extra Halibut on top ($25.00). It added up this plate total cost was $43.90. Isn't it fair to charge this plate with this scaring amount of money on such meal??? $43.90 for a plate of pasta with 8 small diced tip bit of Halibut on top; the lady server should have told us the additional charges on the fish before she placed the order to the kitchen. And to our last surprise, she even added the tipping of 15% on the bill without asking our permission to do so. I would say this lady server's doing was absolutely wrong and should be fired or be trained for her job again; her action is like highway robbery and this restaurant should know of this if all these are not the restaurant's policy. For sure, we will never go back into this restaurant again and will let our friends and relatives know about it.

The first time we did that, it was early evening so we went next door and bought a beer from the crab restaurant and sat outside under the heat lamps and ate with a nice view of the ocean.  It was pretty deserted so nobody bothered us, except for an older woman asking us for our empty beer can.  The next time we stopped by there we got the same thing plus the chowder in the bread bowl.  Then we stopped by a liquor store and got some champagne, then hightailed it back to the hotel a few blocks away and I had the best dinner.  It was DELISH and the oysters were rocking too!

We decided to wait inside Nick's.  The servers were pretty accommodating and tried their best to find a seat for 8 people in their tiny little cramped space.  After 15 mins, a family of 7 finally left and 4 servers immediately cleaned that table.  It was super fast that we were quite happy with it.  We ordered their specials since most of their dishes is over $15.  Their specials ran from $11-15.  Not too bad and it includes soup or salad.  I ordered their Fettucini with shrimp and scallops while the rest ordered the other items on their specials menu.  Quite satisfied with their dishes as they give plenty of it.  This was my second time at Nick's.  My first time was when I went to SF with my husband and treated him out for his birthday.  He got the crab and I had to fish out the meat for him.

My 12 year old son loves clam chowder, but was thrown off by menu listing only Boston Clam Chowder, not New England. So he opted for the crab chowder instead. My mom ordered the salmon, which turned out to be the best item we got that night.\n\nThe crab chowder was surprisingly lacking in crab - more of a potato soup in a bread bowl. The Garlic bread, while not exactly burnt, was dried out and crumbly.\n\nMy steak sandwich was more fat than steak and served with nothing more than a limp piece of lettuce and a one tasteless slice of tomato on a bread roll (the bread was the best part of my meal). I had to ask for mustard, Catsup and Tabasco to make the steak palatable.\n\nMy sister took one bite of her linguine and said it tasted like it had been cooked in fish stock. She ended up eating the fries off my plate and nothing else.\n\nLike everyone else on this site - we experienced the small seating arrangements, but we also got the joy of being moved to a different table after we had settled down and ordered. It was offered to us as \"a table near a window with a view\", but the view consisted of the trash cans on the back deck and a faint glimpse of the tops of some sailboats at the docks.\n\nBut my mom really enjoyed the Salmon so for that and the fact that the waiters were nice and understanding, I reluctantly give Nick's 2 stars.", "author": "Eric Z."}

I let that slide and we got our calamari and she brought us our chowder.  The calamari was ok and the chowder was not good at all.  There was not one clam in his chowder and I took one bite of mine and asked to change to a salad instead.\n\nShe took my chowder to the cooks and I could here her yell to them that I didnt like the soup so i wanted a salad instead. (2 other tables sent back their chowder as well to get a salad and she did the same thing) Then they started laughing and she finally brought me my salad which wasnt even fresh at all.\n\nIf that wasnt bad enough she brought me my fish n chips and I didnt even want to eat them from the look of the fish.  I took a couple bites of my undercooked fish and fries and after everything i couldnt  eat any more.  She brought us our check which was about $4o total for all the food we didnt eat.  She looked at my full plate of food and in a surprised voice asked if I was done, didnt ask if I didnt like the food she just took it away and brought us our check.\n\nAlso during our meal about 3 other tables got up even before they ordered, which we should have done in the first place!\n\nSave your time and patience and skip out on this place.  There are so many other great restaurants with good service and delicious food to go to instead of this dissapointment!", "author": "Chelsey L."}

It was hot, creamy, very rich with excellent crab flavor, and several sizable crab pieces. The second time my friends wanted to sit inside the restaurant and I ordered the crab chowder again. Unfortunately it was only warm, not as creamy, and had fewer crab pieces. \n\nRecommend getting the cup of soup versus the soup bowl. You can save a dollar and not waste the bread. The soup is filling enough. \n\nYou can get 3-hours free parking in the lot right next to these stands if you spend $10 at any one stand, which is easy to do.", "author": "Helen H."}

We've grown to love the dungeness crabs, chowder stands and the \"bush man\" Today since it was a weekend and streets were crowded we decided to dine in at Nick's Lighthouse right behind their outdoor seafood stand. They were all eager to get us seated with space to park our stroller. But no sooner than we had walked in that we were utterly disappointed at the service and food. Our waiter named David was extremely rude. We hate being judged by service people because we look young and dress casually. When my hubby asked for more crackers for his salty chowder the waiter brought it over and literally tossed it on the table. The fish and chips were totally soggy and bland. Not to mention a TINY portion. Their oyster po boy would've been okay if the bread hadn't been grilled until burnt black inside..i can't believe they still served it! And their cole slaw...wet..overly sweet..that's all you taste is sweet. Their alfredo pasta with shrimp and scallop...no seasoning and very runny. The best thing about our meal? The two Stellas we ordered upon arrival. Of course it was good since the restaurant had nothing to do it with so they couldn't really mess it up. Will not be returning here. Please go somewhere else...try the asian seafood stand on the corner, they have much better selections and if you're looking for a restaurant in the area try the franciscan or even aliottos.", "author": "Francine N."}

Most of the dishes (i.e. chowder, oysters, etc) are similar to the other places, but what makes it stand out is definitely the crab.  First off, unlike some of the surrounding restaurants, you get the whole crab.  Secondly, it isn't cooked until you order it.  I've been to some places on the wharf that brought me out a cold partial crab.  Unacceptable in my book.  Now whenever I'm in the city and want crab, Nick's is the only place I go to.  The restaurant is small, but so are all of the surrounding places.  I wouldn't recommend it for very large groups since the seating isn't really set up for that.", "author": "Noe G."}

That is more than enough food, btw (spent about $50 with tax)\n*Fried calamari - BF liked it, but I think it lacked a bit of salt. Fried perfectly, though - not rubbery, got the nice crunch going\n*Crab cake - Had a good amount of crab in it, no big chunks\n*Clam chowder - Not thick, more like a soup with a broth undertone. Not the place to go if you want something chunky\n*Chilled seafood platter - The weirdest thing on here for me was the calamari vinaigrette. Not so much on that, but the crab, oysters, and tiger prawn (not deveined...hmm...still in shell kind) were all good.  Also didn't like the chilled clam on a half shell, but that's a personal thing - never had a clam raw before that.  \nIn general, this place has a cheesy tone overall but is a good place for families.

I have to say, the service outside is way better outside than inside. The first time I ate inside, it was fine. The second and LAST time I ate inside was with a group of friends and the service was HORRIBLE. The entire time, the waiter had a snarky attitude which I assume was because we were a group of young diners. We ordered some fried shrimp from the outside portion of Nick's Lighthouse and brought it in. The waiter felt the need to rudely let us know we weren't allowed to do that, even though it was allowed the first time I ate inside. It seemed stupid that we couldn't bring it inside considering it is the same business and we were still ordering inside food! After that, the waiter was still rude and rushed us while he took our order.  He didn't even come back to check on us after we received our food and no one came by to refill out waters. \n\nAlso, it is super cramped inside. The tables are too close to the seats in the booth. When I went to the bathroom, it was occupied so I had to wait in the small \"hallway\" for the person to come out. When the person finally came out 15 minutes later, it was an male employee coming out of the women's bathroom! \n\nFinally, when we were ready to leave, the waiter brought us the bill. He wrote in a 15% tip at the bottom. It looked like it was a required gratuity and there was only 4 of us. We were really displeased by then. We asked him why it was written in when there was only 4 of us. He then explained that they usually write it in due to foreign tourists who come in that don't tip. It seemed like an extremely stupid excuse! I don't know if it ever occurred to him that maybe the tourists that don't tip were just not satisfied with the service! Then he asked us how much we usually tip, I said 20% when I'm pleased with the service. Then he tried to argue that I just wasn't satisfied because he told us that we couldn't bring in the outside food. If he really wanted the tip, he wouldn't have argued with us and would NOT have had the bad attitude the entire time. Needless to say, we did not leave a tip!\n\nDon't waste your time eating here!

That's a great price for a filling a decent meal. The place isn't the most aesthetically pleasing and I was examining my water glass for dirt stains, but my meal was relatively good. The seats are very uncomfortable but my food arrived quickly, was piping hot and the shrimp tasty. I didn't care for their sourdough but given how much of it is in SF, who cares. Eating at a stand would have cost me at least $10 so this was the best value for my buck. The space is cramped, service was rushed, I mean rushed...very, very rushed...but that's to be expected as they expect high tourist turnover and few repeat customers.", "author": "Gary B."}

So, friends and I decided to visit again and it was quite a disappointment.  The food was still good, but the service was nothing great.  First, the waiter failed to ask me my options with my order and just served me whatever he came up with, I guess.  Secondly, our server only checked on us ONCE and by that point, we had already finished eating.  We had to ask someone else to refill our water and for some napkins.  The waiter took a looong time to pick up our check and took an even loooooooooonger time to bring it back.  I mean there was only 4 other parties eating and there was no reason for our wait.  There are so many great seafood places to eat at Fisherman's Wharf and you HAVE to stand out with service for repeat business.  I don't plan on returning here again nor recommending it to anyone else.", "author": "Jennifer N."}

However, as my boyfriend and I have decided; Good food beats out good service.  We love the crab cakes!  The specials are always decent, as are the prices.  We've eaten at about every restaurant on the wharf, so it must say something that we come back here every once in a while!  I'd recommend it, but just warn not to expect constant and attentive service.", "author": "Kendra R."}

Stood in line for 10 minutes while I watch the mexican waiter bring in four of his ese friends without having to wait in line. They got the preferential treatment while we had to wait 30 mins just for bread and water.I also witnessed them skipping out on paying the bill. Cramped dining area, left little room to do much of anything. Ordered the fried combo platter which promised an assortment of seafood including crab legs. They skimped on the crab legs and filled it up mostly with fries and calamari. DO NOT EAT HERE! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!!", "author": "Jamal J."}

It was definitely kind of weird how they sort of jump at you and grab you in the restaurant as if you're going to run somewhere else. The menu is very similar to those that are on the same strips and once again they do not carry whole fried clams as an appetizer (which leads me to the conclusion that people do not like fried clams). I asked the server if he can make it as a smaller portion because I definitely cannot finish the whole entree portion myself, they gladly said yes for $15. I mean $15 dollars is not very cheap, nor very expensive for clams and I have gone to places where they charge $25 dollars for a plate before. As we patiently wait for our food to come in a very crowded atmosphere, the clams came out in a very small plate with 5 pieces of clams on there. Do the math guys! It's 3 dollars per piece and each pieces were the size of a quarter and a half. Talks about being ripped off. The other items including very bland clam chowder, crab chowder with very little crab, so little that you can't even find or taste it. After my super disappointed meal with very little service we leave with a very empty stomach and heads to Burger King on the way home.", "author": "T Is For Tom N."}

But givin its on the strip of Fisherman's warf where there's all the crabs out... the atmosphere is quite fun and bustling.  INSIDE the restaurant the atmosphere wasn't as great.  It seems like the waiter is too busy serving people.  The host while we're waiting in line suggested that we get a COMBINATION platter as an appetizer since we have a group of five.. so we did exactly that... AND IT WAS HORRIBLE.  do not repeat the same mistake as me.  The sauteed seafood platter looks like u can make it at home.. and since it is an entree. it comes with rice and veggies and not a lot of seafood.  Don't get that as an appetizer.. u're better off ordering two dishes from the appetizer list.  The entrees were not bad however.  I had the seafood canelloni.  It was really cheese which i looove. it's stuffed with crab and shrimp.  My boyfriend had ordered the manila clams with the hwite sauce.. but they took it out with RED sauce instead.  The waiter was just like oh try it.. if u don't liket it i guess we'll jsut try to make antoher one fo ru... soooo we werne't tooo happy with that.  The clam chowder was ok.  So over all.. this place was just.. OK.. not a must... i think there's better ones out htere on fisherman's warf.. oh i must say the Clam chowder at boudins was better than at Nicks.

It is a tiny little place tucked in one of the side streets off of the main Fisherman's Wharf.  There is a guy standing outside like a barker, drumming up business.  The decor is very simple.  Comfortable booths.  Only thing is, they keep the door open so if it is cold outside, ask to be seated in the back because you will freeze.  I started with the lobster bisque which was delicious.  I have had some great lobster bisques and theirs is right up there.  For the main course we each ordered the cracked crab which was delicious.  None of us used any drawn butter or cocktail sauce.  The wines are so so.  It is kind of a family restaurant sort of place so I didn't walk in thinking there were going to be great wines but I think they could do better.  All in all, I will definitely be back.  It is a great value and the service was very friendly and attentive.", "author": "David S."}

(should have ordered something else) i know it's my fault that the other dish i tried was pasta and they're clearly a seafood place.

We were walking around Fisherman's Warf with a friend from out of town and the guys outside the restaurant were trying to get us to come in.  We past by first time, but then wandered back and decided to try it.  They stuck the 3 of us in a corner booth with a table that was way to bid for the booth, so we weren't very comfortable, but we were hungry and it all sounded good.  I don't even know who our waiter was supposed to be...we had someone take our order which included a couple of beers and an ice tea.  It took them 10 minutes to get us that and then we finally got to order.  When the food came the soup my friends ordered was not very good and the entrees were worse!  Mine was edible, but very boring and the pasta was very dry without much sauce at all.  My friends food was worse...the fish and chips one of them ordered just looked awful, so I can just imagine what they tasted like.  Oh and speaking of the fish and chips...they didn't bring out any vinegar with it and 10 minutes after she asked for it she walked up to the bar to get it herself along with mentioning that we all needed drink refills.  We mentioned to 21 other people that we needed drinks, but no one seemed to want to take care of it.  It even took them forever to get our check.  In fact it took so long my friend was ready to just estimate the bill and leave something.  I was adamant that I didn't want to chance leaving more that what we owed, so we waited and dug through our purses to find exact change for the bill so they wouldn't even get a penny tip!", "author": "Rhonda M."}

The day was coming to an end and we were all craving some crab, we walked around and decided to just pick a random place near by.  My boyfriend decided Nick's Lighthouse and so we went to the host and asked him if they is room for 15 people and to my surprise he accommodated us immediately. We didn't all sit together but was split amongst 3 tables nearby.  The staff were friendly and courteous even though we were a rowdy group due to the majority of the group being young guys.  We ordered some crab, appetizers, raw oysters, cooked clams, some white wine and a dish of pasta with shrimp.  The spicy crab was really good, the oysters were fresh and yummy.  The pasta with shrimp did not really have any taste though.  Overall, we had a good meal with some good service.  The place is a bit small and have to maneuver your way around but we will definitely come back.", "author": "Noreen W."}

Seeing that Nick's did have a really long line of patrons outside eating from their sidewalk stall, my husband and I went into their sit down dining room. We were served by the grumpiest Mad Hatter (Halloween) ever. Rude and pushy. The booths are way too small and close together. We started with sourdough that was so burnt it tasted like charcoal. Our lobster bisque was the highlight of the entire meal as my Cod Fish and Chip and my husband's Pasta with bay shrimp and scallops we're worst than getting freezer dinners from the groceries store. The Cod fish was no where near fresh. The flesh was falling apart and the batter was soggy upon arrival. The fries were limpy somewhat resembles microwave fries. Coleslaw was so bland it tasted like straight up cabbage and mayonnaise without salt nor vinaigrette. The pasta dish tasted like hospital food. It was really bland with RUBBERY bay shrimps and scallops. It was definitely a reminder of the time we visited San Francisco and how not to eat at Nick's the next time we visit.", "author": "Jamie T."}
