What makes the bartender with a ponytail good-knows his sports and fills your beer when desired.

I am a HUGE GB Packers fan and it's nice to go somewhere where I can watch the games. That was the positive part of the bar.\n\nSome of the guys that go there are terribly rude. I had a Baltimore Ravens fan (he was a chubby white gentlemen) literally tell me to my face \"I want to punch you wearing that damn jersey\" (I was wearing my #52 Clay Matthews jersey). I was shocked. Thank goodness my boyfriend was there and told the guy to leave. He was a drunken mess. And I think he is a regular because as he was leaving he turned around and said \"fuck you\" to me and the bartender laughed it off. I'm sorry but on what planet is it ok to speak to a female that way? The same guy also bumped into a different girl and threw a drink on her. And that STILL wasn't enough to kick him out. When I complained to the bartender, he laughed at me and walked away! That is NOT ok. You should make sure your female customers feel safe from jerks like that!\n\nAfter the incident, I told my boyfriend I wanted to leave immediately. We got our bill and we were over charged $83. I requested to see the break down of the charges and I wasn't given it! They just ran my card. I was so appalled we left. How can we have an almost $100 dollar tab when the beers are $3 a piece and we had 7 between the 2 of us?\n\nAll in all, I am so disappointed with the lack of action from the bartenders and so-called security and disorganization of the servers.

The place always seems to be either insanely crowded when there's an event going on or empty almost to the point of being awkward when there's not.  I agree with the previous reviewer who says you can never get here early enough -- hence why I haven't ever made it here for a game.\n\nThe place is pretty spacious which is refreshing compared to a lot of the other places on Polk that seem barely wider than my apartment hallway (cough cough Buccaneer cough Bullitt cough cough).  The spaciousness goes out the window when a game is on though; people are spilling from the front window like out a can of sardines.  \n\nThe crowd seems slightly less yuppie douche (but on the flip side, perhaps more greasy) than some of the other places nearby.  The selection of beers on tap is good, but annoyingly they don't sell by the pitcher.   Pretty reasonably priced in my experience, and they have good specials as well.  I've been pretty pleased with this place but given how popular it is I would recommend skipping it if you actually want to pay attention during the big game.", "author": "Molly B."}

Here.\"  I motion to the cash hoping he will take it and end the conversation.\nBartender \"I don't want your money.\"  \nWHAT?  Then what the heck was all that about?  Now I am mad.  I would've gladly given him TEN bucks if I could have avoided this confrontation.  \nMe \"No really please, take it, I am happy to pay, it is only 2 dollars, I was just surprised, that's all.  I want to pay for it.\"\nBartender, \"nope, and usually we charge 3$ for it.\"\nI really don't want his condescending charity.  I don't need free drinks.  \nMe: \"then please put it in the tip jar\"\nBartender, \" I am the OWNER, I don't take tips.\"\nI GET IT DUDE, YOU'RE THE OWNER!!!\nMe, \"then please take it and put it in the tip jar for your other bartenders\"\nhe takes it, I enjoy my 2$ water infused with bubbles.  \nCOMPLETELY UNNECESSARY \nIf I were a bar owner, here is how i would have handled that situation.  \"Oh really, you've never been charged for it before?  well, i am sorry for the inconsistency.  this is something that we usually do charge for.

Name more than one or two other bars or restaurants on this street who have matched that! They must be doing something right.\n\nIt's not a perfect bar, but it's a nice place to get lost when it's not jammed for a big game. You can sit at the bar or grab a nice long table, throw down some food from a nearby restaurant, drink a beer, catch an obscure NBA or NHL game on one of the zillion flat-screeen TVs, and waste away.\n\nThe jukebox is state-of-the-art where you can download any song available on the internet. That's also good on a slow night.\n\nDon't come here expecting the bartenders to be charming actors. They have been jaded from having survived a month of drunken Saturdays and Sundays, where they have no doubt worked their ass off for hours on end with no time for small talk. This is where there's room for improvement.\n\nIf you go there on a Sunday afternoon, you will have the pleasure of running into Serge, the owner, who started it all 20 years ago. He also grew up down the street, so he gives the place local cred.\n\nGreens is a place  you can walk into no matter what you're wearing and not feel so out of place, another nice option for this neighborhood.\n\nThe walls have great memorabilia. And the pool table in the back is one of only two in the neighborhood, the other being at the cubby-hole Buccaneer. \n\nBottom line: great selection of beers, lots of room, any game you want to watch will be on  a state-of-the-art flat screen TV, pool table and great jukebox. One star off for the often-aloof bartenders.  So don't go there if you want to strike it up with the bartender. Strike it up with someone else in the room!.", "author": "Nitram N."}

I would probably come a lot if it were in my neighborhood and not on the other side of town.\n\nLike most of SF, it can get crowded, but you should be able to find yourself a seat for the game if you show up a bit early.  There is no food, which is somewhat annoying but mitigated by the fact that you can send a friend to get takeout at many restaurants down the street and they don't mind if you bring it in.  You can even order delivery to the bar itself from certain places.\n\nThere are lots of TVs but no sound on any of the games.  Draft beers of the non-yuck variety are 5 bucks.  Many people here even on a big sports day are not here to watch the game.\n\nAnd I have to mention the rudeness of some of the patrons, because beyond people's general glaring (and a mocking mimic of my \"excuse me!') as I tried to maneuver the crowds, I had two really eyebrow-raising experiences there in just one afternoon.  \n\nFirst, after sitting down at an empty table at which a friend joined me a few minutes later, I was confronted by a pair of guys who told us that \"they were sitting there\" and had just gone over to the bar to order drinks.  No problem, we said, here are two or three empty seats and we certainly don't mind sharing the table.  Not only did they insist they needed the whole table for their not yet present friends, but one suggested that what I had done by sitting down while they were apparently hovering somewhere in the vicinity while leaving nary a sweatshirt to mark their place was \"a real dick move.\"  We were able to negotiate a solution, but unnecessary conflict is never a positive.\n\nLater, I was waiting in line for the ladies' room staring a door that seemed like it would NEVER open.  The woman in front of me in line finally broke down and started knocking to see what was up.  The door IMMEDIATELY opened and out popped another woman, on her cell phone, who said \"Sorry, I didn't realize there was a line!\"  To be fair, I guess you would not technically know whether or not there was a line if you are LOCKED inside the only bathroom stall in the place, on the phone.  But really, could you just step outside?\n\nI personally will never go back here, but if it's around the corner from you it's definitely worth checking out.

Dumbass' commentary: Come on ref, that's a three second violation. Now I understand why other parts of the country say that Californians don't know sports. I'm embarrassed.", "author": "The Sock S."}

PRESTO!!   The result is society's current incarnation of a modern sports bar, and only a good location saves Green's from being a mundane one.\r\n\r\nI talked to a guy who used to tend bar here.  He called it \"an event bar\", i.e., a normally quiet spot for midnight-mass sports fans to hang, hoot, and holler on big-game days.  People tend to show up in groups to watch the game, but all too often wind up yakking on their phones or flirting with someone at a nearby table.  Polk Street was part of my homeward jaunt from a regular client, so I used to cruise by this place mid-week at around 6:30 on Wednesdays. Unless something big was happening, it looked like any other neighborhood bar.  The place gets popular during March Madness, the NBA finals, and Sundays during football season.  Come the Super-bowl or any other highly anticipated game, The Upper Filmore/Union Street crowd flocks here droves, and it's packed to the rafters with the see-and-be-seen crowd.\r\n\r\nAn open-air patio looks over Polk street, while a pool table fills up the back.  Regular days have coverage of nearly every conceivable sporting event from Giants Games to Cricket Matches displayed across a massive array of televisions.  Some of the pictures on the wall are cool...but a lot are little more than filler, and the decent stuff gets lost in the shuffle amongst  eyes that are too young to remember, and too callous to care.  Game audio fills the room on key days...but otherwise the music is young, hip, and moderately loud.\r\n\r\nCome game day it's packed with the young, the beautiful, and their usual throngs of pursuers.  If this is your scene, it's the place to be.  If it ain't, join me for cheaper drinks at a place with uglier patrons, half the screens, and twice the soul....", "author": "Mike W."}

They pointed me to Greens.\n\nI went in and liked it immediately.  Very relaxed atmosphere and lots of TVs with sports on them.  The bartender was very friendly and let me watch the game on the big screen in the back room.  He even turned the sound on loud for me to hear it over the raucous ambient noise.  He also charged only $1.75 for a glass of beer.  He did all this knowing that I was going to nurse that beer thru three periods of hockey--I just give that not-remotely-a-serious-drinker vibe.\n\nSo, thank you Greens for a good experience, and if I'm ever back in your neighborhood, I'll stop in again.
