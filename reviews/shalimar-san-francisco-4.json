I was excited to try the goat karahi dish and my boyfriend got the chicken tikka masala, and we ordered a side of naan bread. \n\nMy goat dish was good - but not the best. It had a gamey flavor which I liked, it actually tasted a bit like lamb. But overall, I think it could've had a better flavor and mix of spices that I crave when eating Indian food. The mix of spices was good at best, but not overwhelmingly amazing. Same with the tikka masala. I actually enjoyed my boyfriend's dish better than mine, but I've had some pretty amazing chicken tikka masala dishes elsewhere so this was a bit underwhelming. Naan bread was yummy though.", "author": "Carina P."}

He threw out some options walking distance from our hotel and we landed on Shalimar because he's a huge fan and he knew it would be fast and filling.\n\nFast and filling, it was... It was also pretty greasy and divey.  After placing our order (note - you do so at the counter) and helping ourselves to cups and a pitcher of water, we sat down and waited for our food to arrive.  We shared Chicken Saag, Chicken Tikka Masala, Okra and Eggplant, and I had rice too.  A lot of food but we're both good eaters and almost cleaned our plates.\n\nEverything was moderately priced + heavily spiced and seemed very authentic (although since I've never been to India, I don't know that for sure).  Service was okay but not super attentive.  The place itself is super casual, cash only, and does not serve alcohol.\n\nWhile I had a memorable meal with Don, I know there are tons of other restaurants to choose from in the city, so I don't know that I'll be rushing back anytime soon.

If you're feeling good about those work your way to the other chicken curries they offer (maybe even work your way to the Brains Masala).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-22", "description": "The small one block stretch on Jones between Geary & O'Farrell hosts three Pakistani/Indian restaurants namely Shalimar, Chutney and Pakwan that I decided to try, to find one that I could stick with on a regular basis. Shalimar was the first one simply because I ran into before the other two. Shalimar is located in the heart of the hood so apart from letting you know that you have to basically ignore panhandlers on your way here and back, I'm going to spare you other details.\n\nMy first visit was on a Friday at around 9 pm. The place was completely packed which did not matter to me as I wanted something to-go. After going through the menu I decided to get their specialty brain masala ($8.99) and a couple of plain naan ($1) to-go. To my surprise I was able to pay by card. I parked myself on one of the chairs at the entrance and looked around to see a really dirty restaurant. Without exaggeration this entire restaurant needs a good scrubbing from top to bottom. After what seemed like a long wait, but was only about 20 minutes I was on my way.\n\nThe brain masala seemed to have been hurriedly put together. The masala was definitely under-cooked and had the taste of raw spices coming through, but it was eatable. Overall a very average and nothing to write home about.\n\nAfter my first visit, I've been back a couple of times and have tried the Chicken Korma ($.7.99), Chicken Saag ($7.99) and a bunch of lamb dishes all at or below the $10 mark. My experience has been mixed at best. At times when the food is cooked correct it's great. Other times you know that it has been put together hurriedly, especially when they are busy.\n\nOne major difference is very evident when you dine-in v/s get something to-go. When you dine-in the quantity of food that you get is drastically less than what you get something to-go. It even tastes better. So if you can deal with a dirty restaurant dinning in would be a better option here.\n\nPrice-wise Shalimar is the cheapest of the 3 Pakistani\\Indian restaurants in this one block stretch. Chutney that is just across the road is about 15% more expensive and Pakwan that is one block down is about 30% more expensive. Quality of food wise it sits in-between Chutney whose food is better and Pakwan whose food is worse than Shalimar's.\n\nOverall, this place can be hit or miss. What you get is not bad for the price especially when it is done right. I prefer to go to Chutney for dine-in but don't mind getting to-go from Shalimar. Considering the overall package of price, quality of food, service I feel Shalimar is A-OK at best.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

You don't come here to be impressed with the ambiance, shiny service or to be catered to with big smiles and profuse apologies. You come here for the amazing food and it's affordability. If this sort of thing troubles you, then don't eat here.\n\nThe whole enterprise is very straightforward and pretty easy to figure out as long as you're not expecting someone to hold your hand. The staff are quite a friendly bunch but they are very busy and very focused because they work their asses off. This is a densely urban restaurant, not outback steakhouse--you only need to ask if you have a question. If you expect to be closely catered to with extensive directions and being shown to your table, then don't eat here.\n\nPick up a menu and stand out of the way while you decide. Know what you're ordering when you approach the counter, and be quick about it as surely numerous people are now standing behind you. Off to the right of the counter there's a fresh chai dispenser so you can enjoy a hot cup while you wait for your food, serve yourself. Enjoy your awesome food but don't dawdle, this isn't a hangout. It  usually very busy and other customers would like the table. If any of this puts you off, then don't eat here.", "author": "Travin T."}

If you like saucy chicken dishes that go great with naan and/or rice, get the Murghi FOR SURE.\n\nGet this straight, if you have never been here before- You are coming for the amazing food, the intoxicating way all of these spices come together and create these dishes... omg. You are NOT coming here for: The ambiance, neither outside nor inside, nor the friendly service. You will walk in, be confused, realize you have to obtain a menu from someone that works there, choose your food, walk up to the unofficial counter area, order your food, have the dude maybe/maybe not tell you that you need to grab your own drinks, then sit down and wait for your food. You will be brought a plate, napkin, fork and spoon. A person will bring you your food. He won't say much to you. You will get tears in your eyes from joy when you taste their complex curries. You will consider ordering more. You will scrape any sauces left in your bowl with your naan. You will then be confused as to whether someone will bring you your check or if you flag the guy that brought you your food down. You will pay, and be impressed at how little that meal cost you (yes, they take cards!) Your friend from out of town will compliment you on your insider's knowledge of great San Francisco hole in the walls.

Well, my socks are off in the gutter someplace on Jones St. tonight.  Shalimar is awesome.\n\nMy wife and I picked this place because the review ratings were high, and it was just around the corner from our hotel.  We knew nothing about the menu or the protocol to follow for such an authentic Pakistani restaurant like Shalimar.\n\nWhen you enter the place, you know it's the real deal, because it is loud, the guys in the kitchen are working hard, and the wonderful smells of cooked meat and spices fill your senses.  A guy pointed us to a table and handed us a menu, but it wasn't real clear how things worked here.  Finally, we figured out that you need to go to the counter in the back and tell the cook what you want.  Also, it's good to note that you can go get your own water (and maybe even soda) and sauces from the fridges back by the kitchen.  And while we are talking protocol, it's up to you to go up to the counter again to pay the bill when you are done with your meal.  Now there may be some exceptions to the procedure, as we did notice that some tables were delivered their tickets, and water was sometimes delivered to some tables.\n\nNow onto the food.  We ordered Chicken Jalfrezi, Nihari, Garlic Naan, and Shalimar Chawal.  Everything in this meal was nothing short of excellent.  Both the Nihari and the Chicken Jalfrezi were seasoned beautifully, and the chicken had a slight sweet taste to it.  The garlic naan was delicious as well, and the rice tasted great with the sauces from the chicken and beef.

There's no real system on finding a seat so you need to be aggressive (3 tables got snatched because we weren't sure how the system worked- and ended up waiting 20 minutes before finally sitting). You pay at the end when you're done eating.\n\nOrdered: Chicken tikka masala ($7.95), bhuna gosht (grass fed lamb, $8.50), naan ($1), and shalimar chawal (basmati rice with spices and lots of flavor, $2).\n\nCurries are less than $9 and overall this place is the best bang for your buck in terms of delicious Indian food. Don't forget to grab a cup of their (free) milk tea, sauce bottles, and a pitcher of water.", "author": "Lauren K."}

When I arrived, it was packed. I was impressed. I was greeted, seated, and given a menu. Then I sat there.... and sat there... and was finally told by a customer that I have to go up to the cooking area to order. A-ha! Ok! I ordered the chicken tikka masala, the palak paneer and the garlic naan.\nEverything was served in small to decent sized portions. If you're dining with a large group, I would recommend ordering double of dishes you like. \nSo, how was the food? I would say the food was pretty good. I've had better. I've had worse. I wasn't wowed or overly impressed. \nThe service wasn't friendly or welcoming. It was more matter-of-fact/ get in-get out. Don't expect service with a smile here. The interior of the place is definitely not dine-in friendly. Again, it's more matter of fact. The kitchen is open to the dining area making for a very warm dining experience. \nI won't be rushing back to eat here again. It was just ok and nothing really stood out. 3 stars.", "author": "Dottsy Z."}

Awful...uhm, awfully tasty! \n\nOne of the highlights of our dining experience at Shalimar included the lamb brain $8.95, that had been handsomely cooked in butter, onions, tomatoes, and spices. This delicate dish was texturally pleasing and had a distinctive flavor that I can't completely describe. Minus its greasiness, this dish was good. Make sure to scoop up every bit of brain with their garlic naan, $2.50. \n\nIn addition, we were thoroughly impressed by how moist and savory the Murgh Tikka Lahori $7.50, was.  The smoky flavor and the gorgeously charred exterior of the chicken leg were pleasing. So far, this was one of the more yummy tandoori charcoal barbecue items we've encountered. \n\nOther dishes we ordered included the daily special: Goat Karahi $9.95, (diced goat cooked in northern spices), which had robust flavor. I love goat and this dish hit the spot. Beware of its greasiness though. \n\nI was disappointed by the Chicken Tikka Masala $7.95, which was devastatingly greasy and watery in texture. I am accustomed to a thicker, rich, creamy sauce. Despite the fact that the chicken was swimming in a watery sauce, once I bit into a piece, it was noticeably dry. \n\nPreferences, preferences. My fianc\u00e9 actually really liked the dishes from here, but I was completely turned off by how greasy the dishes were, especially the Chicken Tikka Masala dish.  How unfortunate. I think I'll stick to the dishes at Pakwan, and only resort to this place if we're really hankering for some lamb brain.\n\n+ BYOB :)", "author": "Merica S."}

At 10:00pm I arrived and ordered tandoori chicken,Biryani and a few plates of tika masala and naan. I am of Indian descent but the owner who is  5'6 black hair with a little white hair. Wears a rinkled dress shirt a gold chain took our order. My family has been coming here for years and we got treated unfairly because we didn't order our food in Hindi. We sat for 45 minutes and we watched as a 3 gentleman ordered and in less than 15 minutes they received what we ordered.  We confronted the owner and politely asked why we have waited so long. He claimed the tandoori kitchen was closed. Once we expressed the unfairness he started cursing at us because we asked, How can it be closed when we ordered a little after 10pm and didn't received our food for 45 minutes and the gentleman that walked in received the same dishes we ordered In less than 15 minutes. It happened at least 3 times. I believe this was discrimination and unfairness we faced. I will pass the word along to my Patel side of my family and let them know never to eat there. I wish I could give 0 stars. May Allah judge you on your character on how you treat customers based on your assumptions. We ended up leaving because after the incident we didn't feel welcomed and it was at least almost an hour we waited.

We walk in and I think to myself \"Should we be even dining here??\" The ambience is so bad that it gives a bad vibe to the entire dining experience, being in downtown San Francisco you expect more. We should have listened to our instincts and moved on to a different restaurant but because it was getting late, we anyhow thought of giving the place a chance with their food. Well, we were terribly wrong!!\n\nOrdered Murgh Tikka Lahori for starters which was okay. For main course, we ordered Murghi Korma Shahi, Paneer Masala, Palak Paneer, few Garlic Naans and Onion Naan. You might at the least expect the non-veg dishes to be delectable but it was just not good! The gravy was so watery and there was nothing Shahi(Royal in English) about it as the name suggests it to be. I can't even start talking about the Paneer dishes!! The Paneer(Cottage Cheese) in both the dishes were so dried out and hard that it was difficult to eat them. Palak Paneer was really awful and I don't even believe they used Palak(Spinach) to prepare it. Seemed like Saag(Mustard Greens) to me!! Lacked salt and all other essential spices.\n\nHygiene seems to have gone on vacation at this place. We were first seated at a table which was not properly cleaned after the previous customer, we had to ask for it to be cleaned. The kitchen is quite open and you can see the chef's and other employees in the kitchen. None of them were wearing a hairnet. The restroom(just 1) was in a very bad shape with toilet papers on the floor and the floor was wet.\n\nI'd never come again to this restaurant!!", "author": "Harshada K."}

The butter chicken and naans were dripping with oil, and extremely heavy. \n\nI guess the best part was that the place was BYOB, so at least there was a couple bottles of wine to wash down the oily, heavy curries and naan.

I don't know if it is the spices from the food dancing in my stomach or the mixed emotions / reactions from our dinning party. Last night, we drove into San Francisco looking for another dinning experience. An old friend of ours was excited to introduce us to an Indian restaurant, he warned us that it was not fancy but the food was fantastic. \n\nBe prepared for the \"total immersion\" program. This restaurant is the \"hole\" of the Hole in Wall place. You get the whole experience of the Calcutta / Bombay by way of New York City Indian restaurant. It starts from the time you park your car with all the street urchins and panhandlers offering to take care of your car, to them escorting you to the door of the restaurant. Luckily, we got a table by the window so we could see them make faces and ultimately given a dollar for their troubles. \n\nThe restaurant transforms you to a place in India, except for the crowd. There were girls in beachwear, Indian families with crying kids, tourists reading their Zagot guides, techies with their Google glasses and Indian Cabbies. We were 4 deep at the counter waiting to order. The menu is a large paper / newspaper / place mat. The items were so inexpensive, IE. tandoori items for $2., curries $7. After you order you sit down and clean your table. The floor has reminisces of the previous dinners meals. You get all you can eat marinated onions, jalapenos and Chai Tea. Paper cups, mismatched plastic plates and prison silverware are the table settings. A couple of flies buzzing your food is always a treat. \n\nThe food tasted good and had lots of spices. The cuts of meat are a mystery though. We had some weird cuts of Chicken in our curries that I have never seen before. The Lamb chops were as tough as any wildebeest I have ever had. None the less there were lines out the door. The food is greasy but that is what the Naan bread is for to soak up all that sauce and flavor.\n\nIf you chose to dine here you need to come here with an open mind. Remember this is Mumbai without the 18 hour plane ride. Imagine you are spending Rupees instead of Dollars. And when you, leave your stomach will feel the same as if you were on tour of the Taj Mahal. \n\nGood:\nPrices\nAuthentic Indian Flavor\nChai Tea\n\"The Experience\"\n\nBad:\nCuts of meat\nLocation\nCash Only\n\nUgly:\nParking\nLack of Police Escort \nRest Room\nFloor Tables Chairs\n\nHey this place is not for most Westerners but they have Zagot stickers every where.", "author": "George F."}

All three items were very good and went well with the naan and basmati rice we got. I also tried a cup of mango lassi and I would not recommend it.

I had already tried Shalimar from take out at friends house but this was the first time I went to the restaurant. The location of the restaurant is my least favorite (tenderloin neighbourhood) because it is a bit unsafe but we were hungry and at 10pm you don't have too many options in the city because it's too late for dinner. The three of us went to Shalimar and the place was pretty small and crowded so had to wait briefly  for a table. I must say, I wasn't impressed with the place at all because it was a bit dirty :( and having lived in Mumbai for so long, I don't like to be reminded of that but this is something you can expect if you want to eat this type of cuisine, I've had a similar experience in Santa Clara too at another Pakistani/Indian restaurant and I guess it's ok for once in a while eating out at these joints. We ordered dal fry (which was ok but I expected way more flavor from that dish) but also i'm biased because I get to eat Indian food at home all the time so perhaps i'm too demanding :P, mutton gosht which my husband (who is indian) loved it but i wasn't too happy about it and also because mutton is a not my first choice of meat or dish, tandoori chicken legs was probably what I enjoyed the most - succulent and not too spicy and shared tandoori roti, garlic naan and alo paratha - the garlic naan stood up and was soft and fluffy and some of our friends say it's just the way its served in Pakistan too so must be authentic. Overall I liked it but wouldn't say this was a great experience.

I was appalled at the lack of organization and it was a free-for-all attitude. But when in Rome, do as the Romans do. You have to quickly adapt to the situation in order to survive. It's fight or flight and I choose to fight. I quickly figured out that I had to be aggressive in getting the menu and placing the orders. Once I got the hang of it, I couldn't care less about the rest of the people and let my killer instinct set it. I scanned the room and quickly grabbed a table. \n\nYou can't be Mr. Nice Guy here. Nice guys finish last. \n\nDo you want to know if a place is good, just scan the crowd as it was mostly locals with brave souls and native Pakistani and Indians that pack up this joint. Don't expect good service, don't expect anyone to greet and seat you, but do expect great, authentic food at very reasonable prices. \n\nI love lamb, and this place is lamb heaven. They make it in different ways, but the grilled Lamb Chops are out of this world superb and cooked to perfection. I would suggest that you devour these right away while they are still warm to enjoy the texture and flavors that oozes out from first bite. You also get different textures in one bite from the soft, medium rare in the center to the crispy, charred state that forms around the exterior. \n\nIf you're the adventurous type, they also have Lamb Brains. Yeah...this one's nastee. One bite and your calories will quadruple and might require a bypass surgery. It's creamy, delicious goodness that you can slather on a Garlic Naan (more on that later) or mixed with Basmati Rice. \n\nThe Chicken Kabob and Grilled Chicken are also fantastic. Both packed with wonderful flavors and aroma that is making the homeless person sleeping outside salivate in his dreams. Yeah, I'm cruel...but you have to be in order to get what you want. And I want this food in my belly and you better get out of my way when I'm hungry. \n\nAnd to go back on the Garlic Naan, there are Garlic Naans and there's Shalimar's GARLIC Naan.

Sure, you feel like you need to wear asbestos underwear to use their toilet. Oh yeah...and it is on a particularly seedy stretch of Jones in the Tenderloin that isn't spotlighted in any of the guidebooks. But, damn, the South Asian dishes are good here. Good in a no-nonsense way with some surprising twists. In fact, I actually think the food is even better here than at their slightly more civilized location at the edge of Polk Gulch. I came here in the middle of a work day because I was finishing my shift at a work-related conference around the corner at the Clift Hotel.\n\nI decided to take advantage of the remaining daylight and grab a late lunch at 3:30PM. As it turned out, nobody eats at Shalimar at 3:30PM, so I had my pick of the formica tables and rickety chairs. Even though I was seriously tempted by the Lamb Brain Masala (next time), I went for the more mainstream Tandoori Chops, four of them for $10.95, nicely marinated and accompanied by a few raw onion rings (see photo). Deliciously tender with a kick of masala spices and the bones quite gnaw-worthy. With them, I went for a $6.95 plate of the simply named Okra.\n\nThe dish was described most accurately as \"ladyfingers\" since they leave them whole rather than chop them as most Indian places do. They're cooked with onions and a big fistful of Shalimar spices sweetened by just a hint of ginger (see photo). Although it was oilier than I was hoping, there was no denying it was delicious especially when mixed with a $2 plate of Shalimar Chawal, a house specialty of basmati rice cooked in a rich stock of savory spices, onions and saffron (see photo). Stuffed. But I needed all that food to energize myself for the aggressive jog down the Jones Street hill. And oh yes, the restroom wasn't that bad.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...really good and unique Indian-Pakistani dishes served in a no-frills manner\nAMBIANCE - 1.5 stars...well....\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty speedy and friendly when they're not busy\nTOTAL - 4 stars...go during the day if you can, take a little more risk in the evening", "author": "Ed U."}

It was open till midnight and we headed right over. We ordered their specialty goat dish which I cannot pronounce or spell, the vegetarian eggplant, 2 garlic nan's, a mango lassi and all three desserts on the menu! LOL it was amazing. every dish was delicious. I couldn't believe that after 20 years this little hole-in-the-wall was still here in the food was still sooo good. The place was packed , the service was great it was a great overall experience. To top it off when the bill came it was about half as much as my usual place in the East Bay.

Cafeteria-style tables, paper menus with curry splotches on them, and a harried-looking guy behind the counter who calls you \"bhai-sa'b\" (roughly, \"bro-sir\"). That's right, I got bhai-sa'bed in the Tenderloin. In fact, the entire ordering conversation took place in Hindi/Urdu, though I didn't realize this until a moment later. I've seen a couple of these dhaba-type places in Canada, but Indian restaurants in the US are usually not quite so casual, and everything normally costs about 50% more.\n\nI suspect that the people running this place are Punjabi, and probably from the Pakistani side of Punjab. The default red meat here is beef (though there are a couple of lamb dishes on the menu), and there are a few classic subcontinental Muslim dishes like nihari and haleem, and biryani without any of that raisin-and-cashew nonsense. There's also a tandoor, with the usual array of naans and kababs. I like that you can get a single serving of kabab for a couple of bucks, rather than having to order a whole plate of them.\n\nI got a chicken tikka masala, seekh kabab, and naan. The food was a bit greasy (OK, technically submerged in a pool of grease), but that's to be expected at a place like this. Not the tastiest Indian food you can find, but satisfying in a diner-ey sort of way.\n\nI'm glad this place is here, and that it offers some dishes beyond the usual palak paneer and chicken tikka masala and naan that you get at every other Indian restaurant in America.

This place stays true to its core, the decor is very pedestrian, and dining hall smells like an Indian restaurant, self-serving chai, water, cilantro/tamarind sauce...  I had the chicken karahi, rice and they are as flavorful as I can recall.  The chicken was served with bone, which requires a little getting used to.

It's noisy and chaotic during lunch rush but the servers will take good care of you.   But here's the skinny on the food because that is the reason you will go there again and again:\n\nDishes look individual but portions are generally sufficient to share.  I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer, Basmati rice, and garlic Naan.  The Tikka Masala was perfectly spiced and had generous portions of tender barbecued chicken.  Just absolutely mouthwatering. The basmati rice was light and expertly cooked and just complemented the chicken. The Paneer was very thick and spiced amazingly, with huge cubes of cheese embedded.  The naan was so garlicky and buttery that it almost oozed out of the middle.  It was so rich it might better be an appetizer, with regular naan to soak up the sauces of the main dishes.  Oh, and Free masala tea! I saw beautiful Gulab Jamen in the fridge but was just too stuffed.  There is always next time! \n\nPrices are amazing considering this is San Francisco, and portions were generous enough we could have ordered one of everything instead of two. $21 total ( It is off the rich path around Union Square by just a few blocks but the neighborhood seemed fine to us, so out of towners nearby should try it too!

You wouldn't call what they serve \"food,\" as much as \"grub\": the stuff you might find if you wandered down an alley in the Fabric district of Manhattan and discovered the cafeteria where the seamstresses and cart-pushers eat their lunch. It's certainly authentic grub - probably very near what you would get from a street vendor in India - but it's not the kind of thing that you want to think about very much as you're putting it into your body.  \n\nAnother way of describing this place is that it's the opposite of a very conscious vegan restaurant, where the food is lovingly and thoughtfully prepared. The food is cooked in industrial containers and ladled out onto a paper plate before being plopped onto the counter. That may be exactly what you're looking for - it does have a certain no-frills charm to it - but again, it doesn't leave you feeling healthy aftewards. The amount of heavy oils and creams in each dish seems greater than what you would find in most Indian restaurants.  \n\nIf you are the type of person that would not mind eating a plateful of fried food, for example, then I think you will enjoy this place a lot.

Visited a few weeks ago on a trip to California for school and this was one of the best, most authentic ethnic restaurants I went to, which is saying something for San Francisco.  Their selection of food was good, and the free tea with dinner was a great bonus.  They didn't have saag paneer which I was a little disappointed about, but the alternatives we chose were good enough.  One piece of advice I'd give to the owners/staff is to make sure to keep the door closed when it's cold outside!  A customer didn't close the door all the way when they came in, and after a few gusts of cold air were blown over to my table I decided to get up and close the door myself.  That's not really something a customer should have to do.", "author": "Jenny C."}

Looked more like a bowl of soup. Sorry if that sounds disgusting, but it may be helpful to someone looking to try something \"different\". The Garlic Naan is amazing and the Basmati Rice is good as well. The service is not all that great here so don't come here in a rush.

We ordered garlic naan, plain naan, onion kulchi, a beef dish, tandoori chicken and daal....all of which had NO FLAVOR. Even my first forays into Indian cooking when I got married 17 years ago had more spice than this. The one upside was that when I asked if there were nuts in the dishes we were ordering (my children are allergic), they very firmly said no and my daughter had no issues whatsoever ; usually at Indian restaurants they either don't know or don't care to be careful about cross contamination so tandoori chicken is usually the only thing that my daughter can safely eat.  So if you really  want something \"different\" than the usual American fare then go ahead and eat here - you won't get sick but you won't be eating anything with any kind of flavor that remotely resembles real Indian food.", "author": "Joyce T."}

And when I say he took me to Shalimar, I mean he essentially carried me there after six too many cocktails at Rye, ordered for the two of us and stuck me with the bill, which I only know because I woke up with a Shalimar receipt in my pocket, and the aforementioned Tandoori chicken smell.\n\nAnd as my memory slowly returns to me, the one thing I know is that I shouldn't be complaining, because this filthy little Pakistani spot slings some seriously delicious food.

I ordered the garlic naan and it was the best tasting naan I have ever had in my life! And the prices were so cheap! And it was open late! \n\nOne of my main downsides was that it was a bit confusing. I was not sure how to order, pay, sit down, or take my order to go.

I'm not typically a fast food kind of girl, so I popped into Shalimar to see what I could get. \n\nThere was a guy behind the counter who, focused on pressing some naan dough into place, barely acknowledged me, but oh well. I wasn't there to make new friends. \n\nI ordered the Lamb & spinach with a side of their freshly baked naan, which was the best part. The lamb & spinach was just ok. I managed to scarf it down even though I was surrounded by uncleared tables full of dirty dishes.\n\nI was alive again! Still a little spacy, but alive! \n\nNow for the important part: As a lot of people do that are dining alone, I was looking at my iphone since I did not want to sit, staring into space. \n\nIn the entire restaurant on this particular afternoon at about 3 pm, there were 5 people in the restaurant. Me, a guy in front of me, two guys behind my table, and the guy behind the counter. The guy in front of me finished at about the same time I did. \n\nI paid, left, headed out to tackle the next thing on my to-do list and realized I left my phone on the table! I rushed back and saw that my table had not yet been cleared, but my phone was gone. \n\nThere were still the same remaining 3 guys in the restaurant. I asked the two at the table, \"Did you see a phone on this table?\" \"No, ask that guy.\", one of them replied, pointing to the guy behind the counter. \n\nI asked him. He looked right at me, wide-eyed and said \"A phone? No, no phone!\" \n\nI set my bag down and said, \"Alright, I KNOW I left it right here, so either YOU have it, or one of YOU have it.\" It was clear I was not leaving until I got my phone back. \n\nThe guy behind the counter says, \"Oh, do you mean an iPhone? Well, yes, I found an iPhone on that table. Was that yours? Just one moment. \" \n\nHe knew it was mine. He goes to get it out of his bag. Within just a few minutes, he had scooped it up, turned it off and put it in his bag. Turning it off keeps the tracking from working so I would not be able to find it had I not returned immediately. \n\nWhat remains of the idealistic, small town girl in me would love to think that he had turned it off to conserve battery power, and that he stashed it away safely with the intent of tracking me down and getting it back to me, but well...YOU decide.", "author": "N B."}

We are made to till the soil, or to chase prey and toss rocks and spears in order to eat.  Sadly, our intellectual evolution has outpaced this simple reality, hence the problem we have with obesity and the many diet related diseases that now plague our entire species.  Luckily, there still exists a few restaurants that understand this basic deficit in the dining-out experience.  Kudos to Shalimar for recognizing that we were meant to struggle for our meals.  They very wisely placed themselves in one of the most difficult areas of San Francisco for parking.  Not only that, but they are also happily situated in an area that has not just-coincidentally been used by the producers of The Walking Dead for several of its more terrifying scenes.  As I ushered my wife and kids past and around the hundred or so human-flesh starved residents of this area, I actually did notice as we continued hiking upward toward the restaurant my hunger was growing at a measurable rate--apparently in response to the number of calories it required to simply get to the restaurant.  On the way there my 2 kids got to learn about law enforcement, deficiencies in our mental health care system, human anatomy, social injustice, the impact of the welfare state, and we were able to collect several samples of human scat for later research.  \n\nBut, once in the restaurant we were treated to the biggest surprise of all.  This was by far the BEST Indian food we've ever had.  I really don't know what else to say because any description I could give would pale compared to our tasting experience.  We chose a variety of items, and I wish I could say there were ups and downs, but everything was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS.  I know that San Francisco is a beautiful town with some very deep wrinkles in some areas.  It is a testament to just how great this town is when even within the wrinkles there is beauty that outshines the best that any other town has to offer. \n\nThink I'm gonna risk my family's life to eat here again?

I like their butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. They also deliver so that's a plus plus plus in my book!

I don't know what authentic Indian food reallly tastes like since this is only the 3rd Indian joint I've tried.. but I imagine this chicken tikka masala to be MY version of what \"authentic\" would be. :D They could've given me more chicken though- I think there were only 10 little pieces and the rest was  just sauce.\n\nBeef Jalfrezi- cut pieces of beef sauteed with onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes. GOOD, but greeasssy greasssy greeasssy! \n\nGarlic naan and onion kulcha- decent. I really enjoyed their rice though! MOIST!\n\nTotal for dinner? ~24bucks.\n\nI still prefer Little Delhi...

You can come up with your own version of \"Spot it\" to keep yourself entertained while you eat. Here are some of the things you should see during your visit:\n\n1. A familiar face serving you. Yup, that \"server\" has been there for at least a decade. Not that one would expect Pakistani restaurants to lose their wait staff to the competition on account of the quality of their service.\n2. Meat to bone ratio in the mutton dishes. Likely weighted in favor of the bones. In the restaurant's defense, they probably want you to keep sucking that bone marrow... \n3. An Indian family or two from the Punjab amongst the diners. You can spot them from their turbans. Preferring to eat at Shalimar than at an Indian restaurant (rarity)\n4. Greasiness of the curries. I even overheard a few Chinese (possibly Taiwanese) customers find the food as greasy. They probably didn't appreciate that the restaurant holds diving competitions for the pools of oil on your plate.\n5. Cleanliness. Noticeable, by its absence. The restaurant has probably not been cleaned since it opened.\n6. Someone with beads of sweat on his forehead, declaring \"the food is ridiculously good\" or \"they must put crack in it\".\n7. Confusion while paying. So, they've teamed up with Pakwan in deciding which restaurant causes more confusion. At Pakwan confusion revolves around when your order is ready.

It is bad enough that the poor sob had to spend the last days of his life imprisoned by his son, but it's worse to have one of his beautiful, cherished gardens, Shalimar share the same name as this dirty restaurant.

My favorite was the Chicken Tikka Masala and the garlic naan. The meatballs weren't bad either. The real winner was the MANGO LASSI! I've only had one other like it, and my aunt makes it using real mangos and carnation milk. It literally tastes like a fresh, sweet, ripe mango in the form of a shake. I couldn't stop drinking it!

I was running down the street to get a few bottled waters from the car and this lady asked me for change.

An order of a dish and naan can feed me for 1.5 meals. I have tried their Chicken Tikka and Daal, along with their rice and naan. The Naan, like other reviewers have said, is pretty good, but I think that's about it. The Chicken Tikka Masala is so so oily, that whenever I get it for takeout there is an obvious layer of grease sitting on top of the actual sauce, it looks and tastes very unappealing. At first I thought that maybe it was a one time thing, but when I tried again for the second time, it was the same. The Daal is alright, though nothing special. I think I'm gonna have to start walking a but farther to try some other Indian restaurants.", "author": "Emily H."}

Sure, be weary about the neighborhood. The location is not the best. But, who cares! Clutch onto your purse a little tighter and don't talk to strangers.\n\nTrust me. Its worth it!\n\nThe food is awesome. We ordered the following:\n\n*Chicken Tikka Misala\n*Tandoori Chicken BBQ w/sauce on side- yum!\n*Naan- warm, tender, & served piping hot\n*Punjabi Basmati Rice- topped w/cilantro & savory spices\n\nTo end your meal, have their special house tea.

Since the portions were not large, I don't think the prices are a great deal. \n\nAs to the quality of the fare, if it were excellent, then I could forgive the rest of Shalimar's many deficiencies.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not memorable and only average at best.  The chicken dish was particularly uninspiring, with its bland curry and dried-out white breast meat.\n\nHaving traveled extensively through the Sub-Continent, I've experienced great South Asian cuisine.\n\nTrust me.......this is NOT the place.\n\nP.S. --  You can do much better at Pakwan (SF--16th St. location) with its fantastic Lamb Biryani.

As a quick Indian fix it is adequate but not for much more. I just had a tikka masala and naan. The food came out within 90 seconds, I kid you not. The curry was fine. The naan was too heavy and dry. It had clearly been sitting around for a while. Both were hot, though so reheating isn't a problem here.  I should say that I am really familiar with Indian food. Here is the thing:  They don't care. They don't care about the food, the environment, or the interaction. I'm ok with that as I read up, and went in with my eyes open. Having said that, I was still surprised by what a dump the place is.

The Chicken Tikka Masala is delicious, and definitely a no-fail kind of dish for someone who isn't willing to take the risk of trying something new or unfamiliar. Not to say that it isn't completely worth the 8 dollars you'll spend. I usually order it with rice and naan (I love to dip my naan in the extra masala ;D). The Chicken Kofta is really good if you love meatballs and can tolerate spicyness. I usually order rice with that one. \n\nAnd then, there's the GOAT KARAHI. The goat meat is deliciously marinated and comes with little bones that you can suck deeeelicious bone marrow out of! If you've never had goat before, don't be scared!

We wanted to try the mutter paneer because it's supposedly a favorite here, but they were out.\n\nFor you first timers, let me break it down for you.  If you're eating in, grab a table and don't wait for someone to take your order.  You have to grab a menu from the counter where you'll see the open kitchen and order at the counter.  They'll ask you where you're sitting and then they'll bring your food to you.  Don't ask for water, just walk to the refridgerator next to the kitchen and grab your own pitcher of water and cups or any other drink you want.  The service is really slow because it's so busy and the ordering system is really disorganized.  We have plenty of people who sat down before us get their food first.  Don't hesitate to ask about your order and you'll get it quick.  It really sucked for us because we got our dishes, but had no naan to sop the sauce with!  \n\nThe chicken biyrani was good. I loved the cooked slices of lemon in there and the tender chicken thigh meat.  Don't be afraid to eat the lemon, but beware of bones and random unedible spices.  Shalimar ain't fancy!  The chicken tiki masaal was good, but a bit too greasy.  I didn't mind it though.  It just made the naan taste better haha.

The restaurant itself isn't fancy either, the decor is barebones, canteen-style.\n\nFood:\nThis is where Shalimar really shines. The food is really, really good - and probably the only reason I go here. The Sindhi Biryani is hard to find here, most restaurants do basic Biryani but this place really does a good Sindhi Biryani. They also do a very authentic Nihari and Haleem. They also offer entrees that a lot of other Pakistani restaurants don't. Their food has a very home-cooked taste to it, and the food is never too oily or rich. It IS pretty spicy though.\n\nPrice:\nThe prices are pretty good compared to competitors. The servings aren't HUGE but the food is rich enough that you don't need a lot. I would say the food is worth the price when it comes to quantity/quality.\n\nService: \nThe staff is fairly friendly, the food comes out fast and I've never had any problems here.\n\nOh, and be prepared to walk out of here smelling like food.

Recently, my girlfriend and I stumbled upon Shalimar and we fell in love with the place. \n\nThe food is amazing. I crave it almost every day. It's unbelievably fresh and the spices are great. I've had several experiences with them, and the level of spiciness (for the same dish) varies by chef from very little heat to eye-watering, belly-burning fire. Even though I can't really tolerate spicy food, it doesn't really matter to me. The food always tastes amazing and feels substantial and authentic. \n\nTo be clear, I would never eat-in again. The tables are disgustingly sticky. There is one waiter who brings your food out, but the experience is largely self-service. The smoke billowing out of the cordoned off kitchen is thick and dark gray. I have asthma, so sitting there for 45 minutes was a suffocatingly hellish experience. My girlfriend has runner's lungs though, so her watering eyes, coughing, and general face-shielding really put the smoke cloud in perspective for me. Never. Eat. In. Moreover, there aren't a lot of tables and there's isn't any sort of organization, so the dinner rush coming in just hung out in the aisles between the tables and circled patrons who seemed to be leaving soon. Four separate couples hovered around our table for ten minutes while we were finishing up. Not awkward or rude at all, guys.

I mean, I really love delicious food, and I find delicious food at third world prices to be near irresistible.  That's what led to my rather flawed decision to patronize this hovel.  Oh, and I guess we saw a \"Zagat Rated\" sticker placed crookedly on the window.  \n\nNow, normally, I can easily ignore flaws in service, decor, courtesy, cleanliness, etc. in a restaurant when the food is excellent.

We aren't just talking cheap diner sort of filth, or even third world country filth here.  We are talking full on retch-inducing horror movie filth.  It coats the walls, the tables, everything.  When we sit down, some annoyed looking guy (the owner? a vagabond?) comes over and without speaking or even acknowledging our existence, literally body checks us as he pushes his way to the table to wipe it with a cloth that looks like he stores it in his ass.  That was clue #1 that we had not chosen wisely.  Unfortunately, we decided to \"keep it real.\" \n\nThis is where it turns into the next Chapelle Show episode of \"When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong.\"  We aren't sure if you order from the annoyed looking guy with no concept of personal space, or from the counter, as there is no sign or other indication.  We find some paper menus and look through the choices, all of which sounded delicious and were priced quite low.\n\nWhen the dude with the dish towel in his ass didn't come back, we decided to approach the crumbling plexiglass counter.  There, he magically appears and looks quizically at us while holding a pen.   We order a few things and then he says \"No.\" and grabs our menu to cross off several things.  Apparently, they were out of those items.  We then order other things, which apparently were acceptable.  My poor brother and I both order a mango lassi, which turns out to be bad decision #23 that night.\n\nWe go to grab a soda we had ordered from the fridge and to our surprise, we find the \"Lassi Vat.\"  It's a large dirty plastic bin without a lid, filled with mango lassi with a soup bowl floating in it.  The annoyed dude comes over and reaches into the lassi with his bare hands to fish out the soup bowl and uses that to pour lassi into two plastic cups.  These are brought to our table for us to consume.  Bad decision #24.\n\nEventually, some food arrives.  I am confused as it doesn't look like the Jehangir's favorite lamb chops or the chicken korma or the palak paneer that we ordered.  We ask the annoyed guy with the ass towel if this is our food and he points at all the dishes and names them.  We remind him that we didn't order any of those things.  He looks more annoyed, takes them and leaves.  My brother asks me if it is because we are infidels that the service is this bad.\n\nEventually, correct food arrives.  Some of it.  We inquire about the rest of our order and are ignored by ass-towel guy.  The food is delicious, however, and we think that we've finally justified the 37 bad decisions up until that point.  \n\nThis is when keeping it real goes wrong.  While eating the chicken, I notice there are shards of bone in it, as if it had been violently hacked with a meat cleaver, paying no attention to the bones.  Unfortunately, I notice this while chewing when a thin shard of bone penetrates my lower gums, causing an impressive stabbing pain.  After a startled pause to figure out what the hell happened to my mouth, I carefully use my fingers to remove it, and note the wonderful flavor of my own blood.  Awesome.  That just happened. If the inevitable food poisoning wasn't enough reward for keeping it real, an oral abscess would really top it off.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes of applying direct pressure, my mouth stops bleeding and the remainder of our food arrives.  It's also tasty, though eaten more carefully.\n\nA large arabic family arrives and sits near us.  My brother wants to see if they experience the same awful service, or if they are treated differently from infidels.  An older woman in the group looks around after sitting down, sees the table, and eyes the annoyed ass-towel dude approaching her and pretty much loses it.  In broken English she tells her family that it is too filthy and they must leave.  Good decision #1 for them.\n\nWe finish and leave, so I can spend the rest of my night in the bathroom.

Walking home on a rainy evening not too long ago I thought of Shalimar... \"Tonight... You.\"\n\nAt entry the experience was much the same. Very busy, very aromatic. Simple setup, cafeteria like, with the kitchen and all the related hustle and bustle clearly viewable from anywhere in the restaurant. Many cooks moving seamlessly through the small kitchen like an intricate dance, it was a busy night, always a positive sign.\n\nI skimmed the menu and honed in on the mill juli sabzi, the exact dish I raved about from Lahore, and concluded what better way to really compare than to get the same dish? I took my order with rice and onion kulcha and hit the road. \n\nI headed homeward with excitement to compare apples to apples, or I suppose in this case sabzi to sabzi. I inspected the food and delved right in, first the rice. Rice and breads are canvas to the Indian/Pakistani culinary arts, too many places slack and think you won't notice when in reality bland rice will sap flavor from the dish instead of complimenting it. I sampled some by itself and found it good and authentic, complete with a stick of cinnamon and bay leaf, but honestly it wasn't AS flavorful as I'd hoped. Don't get me wrong the rice was solid, but comments from the rabid Shalimar zealot coalition had me anticipating my jaw to be blown clean off the hinge with rich flavors.\n\nThe main course again, a satisfactory dish but just not nearly as epic as I'd been lead to believe. It was a bit oily for my preference which can drown out individual flavors that would normally work so well with the spiced rice and subtle breads. I clearly recall sitting in my living room staring at my bowl, wondering what I must be missing to reach such moderate conclusions on food others find phenomenal.\n\nI would come back and likely will, I had my eye on a few other menu selections. Frankly though the end result was food that was 'good' but not great, service  'polite' but not friendly or speedy, and taste buds 'content' but not enthusiastic. I reckon that's a three star review if I've ever experience one, don't you agree? Sorry Shalimar fan club, I tried my best..", "author": "Justin N."}

Well, if you ask my buddy Aaron, Lahore doesn't even come close. Myself, on the other hand, sees this feud as more of a friendly sparring match where both spots come out the victor. \n\nApparently, Shalimar was one of the first Indian/Pakistani eateries to set up shop in the Tenderloin, and if you know anything about the 'Loin (besides the junkies and pools of vomit), you know it's home to plenty of fantastic restaurants of this variety. For setting the bar, you have to throw these guys props.\n\nThey have wacky stuff like lamb brains that you can order, but if you stick to the simple stuff, you'll be blown away. The saag is outstanding, the chicken masala is some of the best I've ever had, and their naan is incredible. Best of all, it's CHEAP! Like Lahore, the prices are in the $6-$8 per dish. A total steal for food of this quality.\n\nIt's always good sign when folks of world descent pack a restaurant serving food from their native land. Much like observing a sushi place where much of the clientele is Japanese, Shalimar had a fairly high concentration of Indian people enjoying their grub. When you see that going down, you know you're in for a real, authentic treat. \n\nBeware - the city recently cracked down on BYOB restaurants.

Nice pungent, greasy chicken tikka marsala. An amazingly thick, chunky, and delicious saag. Some whole-lentil dal that's tasty if not surprising, and a fantastic set of naan. With prices ranging from dirt-cheap to slightly less-dirty, and served up in cheap plastic plates that have seen many moons. The mise en scene was that of an Asian night market, filled mostly with locals, where you get the best of blue collar food at even-bluer-collar-prices.\n\nWe were shepherded into Shalimar by a local who claims it's some of the best Indian in the area, and I am tempted to believe his assertions. As we sat in the little space sipping beer from discrete paper cups (they told us no more BYOB, so we hid it) we watched them pull giant skewer after giant skewer of seasoned chicken from the oven, the pungent smoke hanging thick in the air. Doused in a thick red curry, that same chicken descended upon my palate like rickety speedboat full of Somali pirates descends upon an unwary container ship navigating dangerous waters. Quick, sneaky, then POW! My taste-buds have just been held ransom, and the only thing that will save them is a combination of garlic naan and more tikka marsala. \n\nI unfortunately found this place on my last night of a week in The City, but Shalimar has instantly become my new go-to Indian when I am in the area. I fear that I have been permanently ruined on Portland Indian food now, since none have come close to the filthy brilliance dished up by Shalimar.", "author": "Don B."}

I had Bhuna gosht , it was oily and very spicy( not in the right way )I also felt it was salty.Naan was cooked to perfection and the Lahori kabob was yummy . It is very bland looking place and service is blah ... The guy forgot my order and asked me again after 10 minutes what I ordered. Also curry came first and naan came after 5 mins :),they forgot. I drafted this review waiting for bill, I guess I will remind them :). Also there is a sign which says no alcohol but guy next to me bought his own corona so they are discreetly BYOB . For now 2 stars but maybe I will come back to give a second chance.\n\nBetter Indian/Pakistani places in SF for sure!! Try Pakwaan I gave it 4 stars based on my dinner there.", "author": "Sudhir D."}

However, if I haven't been to a place before, first impressions - especially about the service - matter. \n\nWhen we first stepped in for a late lunch, we weren't quite sure how things worked here. It wasn't clear how to order - at the counter or do we just sit down? But where is the menu? Ok, it's folded to the side in a mess of a pile. There was also no acknowledgment that we even walked in. Once at the table someone came by with plates and water and made no eye contact whatsoever, which we noticed seemed to be the style here. Then, we see our food come to the counter. Do we get it ourselves or is someone bringing it over? We saw someone else pick up their own food and no one ever really gave us direction, so I go to grab our plates only to be yelled at by the guy on the other side of the kitchen. I couldn't even understand him clearly, but I eventually got the message. Feeling like an idiot, I sit back down and 3 minutes or staring at our food on the counter, someone brings them over. Oh, and I also ordered a mango lassi, which was still missing after we got our food. I was giving them the benefit if the doubt that maybe they were out and had to prepare a new batch in the back. But, nope, 10 min later I saw some guy take a jug out of the fridge and pour a glass (only 3/4 full). Maybe it was being chilled? Ok, probably not. \n\nI get it. I love hole in the wall places with \"flavor\" & \"character\", but not places that make me feel like an idiot. I mean, now that I know how things work if I ever go again it will probably be better, but the way this place made me feel probably is enough make me not care if ever eat that tasty lamb dish. \n\nA simple \"we'll bring it to you when the food is ready\" when ordering and perhaps putting the menu display over the counter or at least a sign that says \"order here\" would have go a long way here.

The seating is self-service and they won't let you order until you've secured a table. We came at 8:00 and it took about 30 minutes to get a table and another 30 minutes to get our food. There were a lot of groups, so if you are a table of 2, it's really difficult to get a table. There were a few 2-party groups who ended up joining together to get a table. I usually rate an Indian restaurant on how well they make chicken tikka masala and this was good, but not great.

I came here yesterday with two friends, and we paid a total of $24, not including tip (more on that later). \n\nThe curries are very flavorful. We ordered chicken tikka masala, daal masala, and the buhna gosht. The most notable was the bhuna gosht, which had lamb cooked in all kinds of spices (I pulled out a few cloves from my curry). The lamb tasted quite a bit like beef, to be honest, so I loved it, but I couldn't really taste the lamb. My favorite part of the meal was dipping the naan into the curries. Their naan tastes unsalted and was very fluffy and delicious on its own, even without the curries.\n\nI would give this place four stars for just the food, but I'm taking away one star because of the service. We threw down $30 for our $24 meal and asked for change, so we could leave a tip (I thought a 25% tip was pretty hefty for a place where you order at the counter). The guy looked at us funny when we asked for change, and then gave us back a 5 and a 1. Clearly he was hoping for the 5 back. I almost didn't give it to him and wanted to leave the $1 on the dish, but I was in the company of good friends and didn't want to make a scene, so I just took the $1 and left the $5. In my opinion, people who work in the service industry should know to leave behind lots of $1 bills for change, so they can be assured of having a good tip, as opposed to none, which I've done to some bartenders who decided to give me big bills back.\n\nOther than the awkwardness come tip time, I had a positive experience and would come back.

While I did not think I could drag my family around looking for Shalimar without some major pushback (group consisted of teenagers, high maintenance tween and tired hubby), after our touristy visit to Union Square, I found this location fairly close by according to my iPhone....and decided to walk to it. The walk was fun as we got to see a diff side of SF.\n1st off, Shalimar is not a fancy place. Not a date night place. \nFlagged a guy to get us a table as we were exhausted after the walk (ppl from the East Valley dont walk that much).\nMenu had all the standard stuff - tandoori chicken, nihari, mutton chops, biryani, Korma, Karhai, Naans, etc.\nOrdered 8 dishes for us 5 (ppl from the East Valley don't have many great Pak food options and get excited at places like Shalimar). Everybody relished the dishes - Mutton Chops, Seekh Kebabs, Nihari, Karhai Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Magaz (Brain), piping hot naans, Mango Lassi, Chai. Can't recall the dessert we ordered but it was inhaled pretty fast.\nThe walk back to the trolley was going to be easy as we were stuffed and we could walk off some of the calories we'd consumed. BUT....the area at night looks a bit tough - blessed are we that a very kind SF Native (he happened to be walking along our path and noticed the fear in our 10 eyes I think) walked with us and helped us find a cab to our hotel. \n\nBottom line - this is a simple looking place with some very good food!

Except its popularity really defies logic: the place is in the middle of the homeless cloaca of Tenderloin, it's a true \"hall in the wall\", stinky, extremely basic, with dirty bathrooms and being Pakistani, they don't even serve alcohol...Oh, you might say, but surely all that doesn't matter before their wondrful, authentic, delicious food?\n\nWrong.\n\nI am an Indian food connoiseur, even if it comes with a \"Pakistani\" label like Pakwan or Lahore Karahi. I have to say, Shalimar disappointed me on every count of every dish I ever ordered there. Curries are extremely greasy. Chicken tastes like it doed of natural causes. Lamb is sinewy and tough. Rice looks like it came from a yesterday's vat. Even nan tastes too sour and is not crispy like in other places. \n\nSo, what gives?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-07", "description": "After hearing a lot of good things about Shalimar, I was glad to finally make it out to this tenderloin hotspot to try it for myself.  We went on 4th of July at about 9 pm at night, which I would assume would be a relatively quiet time to have dinner.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Even at that hour, Shalimar was completely full; every table was being used, and we had to wait a good 15 minutes before being seated.\n\nOne thing to note about Indian restaurants: you will usually leave smelling strongly of Indian food.  Shalimar is no exception.  In fact, the restaurant is so small and compact with no barrier between the kitchen and tables and seemingly no ventilation, you will undoubtedly smell like Indian food for a couple days after eating here... not that that's bad or anything...\n\nI was a little overwhelmed when we arrived because of how crowded it was.  I was also confused because there was nobody to seat us and there weren't any waiters.  Everybody was hustling and bustling around and seemed to know what to do.  By watching other people seat themselves and make their way to the counter to order, we figured out what to do.  They have these huge menus that you essentially circle everything you want to order.  You then take the menu up to the counter and hand it to the chef who asks you where you're sitting and then tells you to take a seat.  \n\nThe wait seemed a bit long, but that's understandable for being so crowded.  However, I would definitely recommend having more than 1 server bringing food out to the entire army of hungry patrons.\n\nWhen our food finally arrived, I was impressed with the massive feast before us.  Between the three of us, we ordered tikka lahori (tandoori chicken breast), murgh korma shahi (chicken curry), aloo palak, sindhi chicken biryani, a ground chicken curry (never seen this at an Indian restaurant before, 2 orders of plain naan, 1 order of garlic naan, and rice.  \n\nEverything tasted decent; however I had a lot of trouble getting past the amount of oil resting on top of all the curries.  It was literally just a puddle on top, more than even the cheesiest of pizzas.  It was kind of gross!  Now I've seen oil on Indian food before, at Naan & Curry, but never at a more authentic/ non-fast food Indian restaurant. \n\nAside from the unfortunate visual disappointment, the food was quite tasty.  We especially enjoyed the tikka lahori which was spiced and cooked perfectly.  The chicken breast was nice and crispy on the outside, while still being tender and succulent on the inside.  All of the curry's tasted fine.  I would skip the chicken biryani.  It didn't offer much more than the plain rice and the chicken looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.  I will compliment the garlic naan; it was great.  It was packed to the brim with yummy garlic cloves.\n\nAlthough I left satisfied, I'm not sure if I would come here again.  I've been fortunate to have found other much better tasting Indian restaurants in the bay area.  Don't get me wrong, the food didn't taste bad.  However the location is pretty seedy, it's very crowded and thus service is slow, the curries are way too oily, and bathroom stinks like no other.  I have a fleeting suspicion that my expectations for Shalimar were so high because of all the positive things I've heard about it, that I was ultimately disappointed.  Therefore I would advise to try it for yourself.  Just don't go in with any expectations...", "author": "Timothy C."}

If there was chai somewhere, why did you hide it from me? It was on the menu though so I'm pretty sure it wasn't free. If that was the case, what the hell? What Indian restaurant charges for chai? \n\nAlso, their menu is pretty limited, but they do have a better Indian/Mexican ratio than Chutney's. They ran out of garlic naan, and the dude made me deliver the bad news to my friends who already ordered some, and who got mad at me and refused to believe. What the hell, why would I lie about that?\n\nAnyway, mid-meal I see them bring in a huge partially filled tub of some greasy sauce.

On top of that the \"aaloo paratha\" we ordered didn't show up until we were done with the food.\n\nWe ordered chicken tikka, naans, aaloo paratha, and curry.  The food was not that great and none of us enjoyed it especially after eating the burnt naans.  I went up to the counter to pay the bill and told the cashier about the naans.  My intention was to let them know about our bad experience and nothing else.  However I was completely shocked by his response.  He immediately said that we should have returned the burnt naans right away and that people use this trick to ask for discount.  Shocked by his inappropriate and rude answer, i told him that we did ask the helper but the cashier didn't seem to care.   He then mumbled something and then rudely threw the cash register receipt at the counter and said he took out one naan from the bill.  Wow, really?? Instead of just saying sorry or a simple apology the cashier basically assumed that we are trying to trick them into giving us some sort of discount.  This is unbelievable.\n\nWe left the restaurant feeling completely disgusted.  This is a very popular restaurant and I am sure they didn't care if we never went back there, but they should learn how to deal with their customers.  No business does well for ever and if they continue to maintain this type of nasty attitude who knows if they will always be this popular.  Even one star is too much of a rating after this experience. We are not going there any more.", "author": "Aamir W."}

First of all, I grew up in northern India, so trust me when i say I know what north Indian food should taste like. This place offers absolutely nothing like that, despite their claim. First of all, the servers are straight up rude, won't respond to you unless you excuse yourself multiple times to get their attention. After the initial struggle of finding a place to sit, we order our dinner (you have to walk up to the register to put in your order!). My lamb bhuna was a bland mixture of watery curry mix of some sort with precooked chunks of lamb. Nope, that's not how mom used to cook. Rice was an oily amalgamation of long thick rice with rice color. Big fail again; I asked for basmati rice, not whatever you had available. Paneer masala was worst I have ever had (after living in places like Texas, LA and Seattle). The only good thing was the naan because it was plain, simple, made in an actual tandoor (indian oven) and felt like home-Either. The place does not feel very hygienic either. And to top that, a homeless woman walked in (probably looking for something to eat in a freezing cold night) and these guys practically manhandled her, dragging her out by her arms and legs. You couldn't give the poor woman some bread/curry and let her walk out on her own? It's Christmas night tonight FFS! This is the most over-hyped place in SFO. Either the yelpers on here don't know what Indian food should be like or they have a very poor taste in patronizing an establishment that is worth the vote. Top 50 place in America?

Consider myself a connoisseur of mughlai cuisine.  Worked and travelled all over India (IMHO, the best non-veg curries are in Amritsar) and searched for the best street food wherever I travelled in the sub-continent.\n\n***\n\nSummary: if you want to have fairly 'authentic' (for SF) mughlai food (including something of the dhaba experience to boot) then go to Shalimar.\n\n\nReviewers: most goras are clueless. If you wrote \"I had the CTM...\" Hey, you just outed yourself whitebread. :-)\n\nAbout the Oil-slick: get used to it. Authentic mughlai cuisine is all about that.  Places that don't have it... I avoid them, they're compromising themselves for the weak of heart and stomach.\n\nCleanliness: to John B R. \"Indian pork chops\" yeah right, in a halal muslim joint? Others--oh well there's always Chipotle. Anyways, man-up and grow a pair.\n\nThe Food: I have low expectations when it comes to Indian fare here. So I was pleasantly surprised by Shalimar. They serve nihari and other more obscure (at least in Americastan) Mughlai khanna.\n\nWe ordered the  Saag Gosht, Nihari, Chawal, Dal, Naan and I made a special request for Tandoori Roti. The nihari was fairly close to the versions I've had in Delhi, though doesn't hold a candle to Haji Noora's: http://eoid.org/2006/11/06/haji-noora-ki-nihari/\n\nThe beef was very soft--of the correct consistency--showing that it was stewed for a very long time under low heat, as it should be. \n\nI had to ask the guys for the requisite garnish of chopped chilies and lemon wedges, since they didn't serve them with the dish. And I had to go and ask for a plate of onions and jalepenos (something they give to their regular south asian customers automatically, it seems.).\n\nThe saag gosht, daal and chawal met my expectations and were quite good. The naan was okay, not wonderful, but good. \n\nThe big disappointment was the tandoori roti. This everyday staple was akin to a dry cracker; far worse than any you would get from even the most basic roadside dhaba.", "author": "Tak N."}

Now mind you, I'm no foodie nor one to go to expensive restaurants. I didn't go to Shalimar expecting ambiance. In fact, I fully expected it to be small and squalid, cheap, and likely minimal customer service. But I will gladly take all of that if the food is good. Shalimar was all of these things except one: the food was just as terrible as the rest of the experience. After wading through the expected tourists and panhandlers in the Tenderloin to get there, the place was full, but quickly emptied out. We got seated and were given a marked-up paper menu, then realized after deciding on food and sitting there that we needed to go up to the counter to order. Then we sat back and waited. And waited. Even though the number of employees working likely exceeded the number of patrons in the restaurant, we still waited for over a half hour to get our food. I made a special request for a knife to cut into my tandoori chicken, which was way overdone and rubbery. Rice was lukewarm; the chickpeas, meh.They were out of the lamb dish my husband wanted to order and the lamp chops he ordered instead suffered the same overcooked fate of my chicken. By that time we both smelled like the inside of a tandoor oven and tried to pay up and get out of there, but apparently for this (cash-only) transaction, you have to wait for the indifferent waiter to get to your table to reconcile the bill.\n\nTo top it off, on the way back to the car, we nearly stepped in human excrement on the street. A product of the neighborhood, but definitely epitomizes our experience dining at Shalimar.", "author": "Megan K."}

The entree was nearly entirely spinach, which normally I don't care for, but the oily goodness alongside the fresh garlic naan was heavenly. For a moment, I wished I could keep eating, without the constraints of health and diet. I've only been here once, but based on this single experience, I feel safe ordering anything else here.\n\nI ate half of the saag ghost and one garlic naan, which is one sizable serving. I then ordered another garlic naan and boxed the other half to take home. I later found out the delicious garlic naans are $2.50, and my bill came out to $13. I don't regret it all.\n\nCome here if you're craving South Asian meat and curry dishes. Again, this is not a pretty sit-down restaurant where you take your time drinking and mingling.

I pulled up Yelp on my phone to search for places near our hotel that were cheap and had good reviews, and since I haven't had Indian food in a while I figured I'd give this place a shot. \nI looked up the menu online ahead of time and once I figured out what I wanted I headed down there to order. Ordered the beef jalfrezi, chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, onion kulcha, and a box of rice. It was on a Thursday night, the wait was just like the guy at the front said (about 15 minutes). They actually accept cards so that was nice (I was expecting to pay cash). The reason I knocked 1 star is definitely for the cleanliness of the place...it really has a grimy feel and you can see the kitchen past the register and that doesn't look very organized either. Also the waiting area is tiny, and as more people started to come in we went outside and there are definitely some seedy people roaming the streets but overall were harmless. \nNow the food itself was really really good. The chicken and beef were both SO tender and juicy. There was quite a bit of sauce but it was perfect for mixing with the rice and dipping the breads in, mmmm. There was also so much food that my boyfriend and I had a hearty dinner and then still had enough for lunch the next day. I'm sad this place isn't closer to home because I would definitely want to come back and try more items here.", "author": "Vita S."}

Well I have to be honest and say that my paneer tikka masala (they call it something different on the menu but its essentially the same thing) was just too greasy for me. Now, I know that paneer tikka masala isn't exactly a light dish to begin with, but it does generally tend to be quite delicious, so it's a gamble I'm willing to take. This was just tooooo much though. I only ate a very little bit of it, due to that.\n\nWhat I DID really like about Shalimar, though, was the experience of ordering the food (we took it to go). It's cash only and i was about $5 short. The guy behind the counter heard our discussion about finding an atm and said, 'it's cool, just bring it by next time you come in.\" Wow, what a kind gesture. And my BF still swears by their chicken tikka masala.

( I kept seeing this women walking back and forth with pitchers of water, only to later realize that she was getting water for her own table and that it was self service.)\n\nI didn't know where to order, so I watched on as some other people came in and headed to the counter. We followed and stood next to them, and as soon as they order I asked if they had food to go. The waiter said \"yes\", and that he would be back to get our order. When he came back he handed me the menu, and I soon handed it back to him, and told him to choose a couple dishes for two people. \nHe proceeded to do so, but son realized that this is a cash only place. We headed to the ATM and back, and with in 10 minutes our food was ready.\n\nI couldn't tell you what I had, but I think it was a chicken curry dish that was hot and spicy, and a lamb dish that was savory and sweet. Along with that we had some rice, and naan bread. Everything was spiced perfectly, and it was very aromatic. We got back to the room and ate with our hands. It was an authentic Indian dinner in our modern hotel room!  .\n\nThe 1st  bad thing about this place is the location, it's not the best neighborhood.

And when you are there you have to try the naan.  That's the best thing they do.  They also make excellent kababs (tandoori chicken, lamb chops, sheekh kabab).  But they do some other things very well too, like haleem and nihari.  Some days of the week they have karahi chicken /goat - again something you don't want to miss.

No, you don't have waiters that respond to your every whim. No, there isn't a waiting list. Yeah, you have to order your food at the counter, get extra silverware yourself if you need it, grab your own jug of water from the refrigerated shelf. But Shalimar isn't supposed to be the kind of restaurant where everything is strictly organized. It's supposed to rough around the edges, similar to the neighborhood restaurants you find along the streets of India and Pakistan. Classic, authentic Indian/Pakistani food is considered that which is consumed by the majority of the population. Most restaurants in these countries reflect the fact that the majority of the populations in both India and Pakistan consist of working low to middle class individuals/families. The working class mentality (working hard, placing tremendous emphasis on brotherhood and nationalistic pride, putting in the effort to get what you want out of a situation, not used to being waited on hand and foot, etc.) permeates through the very framework of the establishments that these individuals frequent. The owners of Shalimar figuratively picked up the experience and delicious food of the local restaurants in Pakistan and India, and brought it here to share with all of us in Northern California. \n\nTaking all of this into account, I once again stand by assertion that this is the best authentic Indian/Pakistani food you're going to find in Northern California.", "author": "Amber K."}

But it really is the best damn hole west of the Indian Ocean!  I've been to Shalimar a couple times now, and both times we had delicious meals.  The 35-45 minute wait to eat here proves that this is a gem!!\n\nThe Shalimar folks have a little system down where you order after your wait in line (and the long wait will allow you to fully decide on what you're going to order).  Then you find a seat, you eat, and lastly, you pay.  I'm not sure why it's done this way, but it works and is pretty darn efficient.  \n\nBe sure to try:\n- saag gosht (lamb) - $6.95.  The lamb is melts-in-your-mouth tender and comes with lots of spinach!\n- beef jalfrezi (spciy!) - $6.95.  Be sure to order some chawal with this to soak up the oil and spice.\n- paneer masala (cheese) - $5.95.  It's cooked cheese so it's guaranteed to be delicious.\n\nWhen I came here last weekend on a Friday, my bf and I got two curry dishes, the Shalimar chawal, and the garlic naan.  All of it came to $20 even.  \n\nAnd now I am considering erasing this entire review as I'm reluctant to let the secret out....", "author": "Kira K."}

It's an Indian restaurant that Indians actually go to eat. \n2. 3 out of 15 tables are vacant at 6 p.m. on a Thursday. \n3. You clean up the stuff you normally ignore, like spinach. \n4. You find yourself thinking about every plate three days later. \n\nI am fairly new to Indian food. My friend and I had chicken tikka masala and beef jalfrezi, then saag chicken and bhuna gosht two days later. I didn't know what to expect, but the flavors blew me away. My friend kept marveling at the whole grains of cardamom in the tikka masala's cream. \n\nI would have liked a strong cup of Darjeeling, but then the experience would be too perfect. :) \n\nBy the way, the naan was very fulfilling.

He offered to recommend and order a few items, so we said sure. Chicken tikka misala, the standard naan bread, and a few other items were ordered.\n\nI'm not the sort to back away from spicy food (\"too spicy\" is an oxymoron, IMO). Due to what I think is my obvious nationality (skin color somewhat akin to snow), I've found the staff in establishments that serve potentially spicy food will tend to \"mild it down.\" I encouraged them to serve it full strength.\n\nDamn, that stuff is tasty. Still not overly hot to the taste, but deeply flavorful; much more so than the food in other Indian/Pakistani restaurants I've been to.\n\nLike soooooooooo (insert 50 more letter \"o\"s here) many other good restaurants, this place is a total hole-in-the-wall. Totally unassuming exterior. You could walk right by it and either not notice it, or just dismiss it outright as some dumpy greasehole which you wouldn't recommend even to your worst enemy.\n\nThe interior decor is, um....lacking. Oh, Hell: there's no polite way to put it: it's ugly.\n\nFortunately, the food is quite the opposite.

You know a place is legit when it's PACKED at 9:30pm on a Monday night.  There was a line to get tables, AND a line to order.  \n2.  You also know a place with ethnic cuisine is legit if the percentage of customers who are of that restaurant's ethnicity is greater than 75%.  Lots of Chinese folk in Chinese restaurant = Legit.  Lots of brown folk in Indian eatery = Legit.  So this place was definitely legit.\n\nSome other awesome points:\n+ AFFORDABLE!  Entrees are about $6-$7 each.  \n+ TASTY!  We got chicken tikka misala, bengan bhujia (eggplant curry), and the chicken kofta, all of which were so flavorful and superb.  Set my mouth on fire, but I actually enjoyed it all, which signals mad props for the food because I normally shy away from the spicys because it makes me OMG DIE.  Their naan is also fluffy and fantastic, and the garlic encrusted one was great.\n+ FAMILY-FRIENDLY!  My friend says that sometimes you can measure the awesomeness/legitimacy of a place by the number of kids running around.  It was like 10pm, and this place was still packed with giant families with kids.  Loves it.  \n+ LOCATION!  The location is not crap, and honestly, the TL isn't as scary as people say it is.  You just have to keep to yourself, and you'll be FINE.  Plus, there's really some stellar eats here, including this fine joint!  It's so close to so many watering holes, which is very convenient, and I noticed the other night that there's a hookah bar right next to it too.  Nice!\n\nA couple notes: Like Naan 'N Curry, you order and then it's self-serve.  No-frills eating is great.  We were a little confused with the ordering system at first because it seemed like there were several lines, so for other n00bs, just letting you know that the line by the door is for waiting for a table after you've ordered, and the lines by the counter are for ordering and paying.\n\nFinal word: I still have a soft spot in my heart for Naan \"McD's of Indian Food\" 'N Curry, but this place is really freaking delicious too. \n\nSo many choices for good cheap eats in this City, and now another great place!\n\nThis is gonna make decision-making a lot harder.

Everything was delicious, albeit the curry dishes being a bit too salty.  The naan was warm and fluffy and the rice was perfect.  The rice custard was unnecessarily too sweet, though still delicious!  It was exciting and thrilling, yet scary, to eat because there were all sorts of mystery solids inside, all sorts of nuts and pods.  And guess what?  Everything cost just $17.85.  Super cheap!\n\nAnd their green chutney sauce, was AMAZING.  I'm a condiment whore and when there are LARGE squeeze bottles at my disposal, I go to town!  Actually, before I went to town, I went to heaven first when I saw how many full bottles that they had in their fridge.  I used it on everything except for the custard.  And when I had nothing else to use it on, I squirted it into my spoon and drank it like soup.  So good!  I ended up eating over half the bottle on my own.\n\nCompared to all the other Indian restaurants I've been to, this one actually has surprisingly good service.  Plates, utensils and napkins were brought to us, and when the food was brought out, each plate was introduced instead of just tossed onto the table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-12-21", "description": "Shalimar, a diamond in the rough, a temple of gluttony, a purveyor of fantastical gastronomic aphrodisiacs. Or simply, the place that serves the best Pakistani/Indian food this side of the planet. I love food and I have a special place in my heart for Mughlai food - the lavish cuisine invented by Mughal chefs, through careful assimilation of ingredients and craft of Arabic, Mongolian, Persian, Portuguese and Vedic schools, to please the keen palate of Kings who considered their food to be as much art as the Taj Mahal. That very cuisine, in one of its finer forms, by way of globalization, is being dished out at less than 5 bucks a plate, smack in the middle of our beloved Tenderloin. \n\nDon't pay heed to the misguided folks here who are comparing lesser places like Pakwan and Lahore Karai to Shalimar. It's insulting at best and blasphemy at worst. Shalimar stands tall, offering its magical repertoire, with in-human consistency to anyone who brings dollar bills and a growling stomach.\n\nEverything on the menu is worth trying, though certain dishes will bring you closer to Nirvana than others. One of my favorites is the Chicken Kofta, the ambrosial balls of minced chicken in a piquant curry, quite unlike anything else I've come across in my illustrious career of devouring Mughlai food. Then there is Nihari. Nihari is a beef stew from Pakistan and rather hard-to-find due to the holy status of the Cow in certain parts of India. It's sinfully good and sinus-blasting hot. Originally a delicacy, this is one of the many Mughal dishes that is cooked overnight to imbue that mouth-melting consistency and deep spice flavor into the beef. I like to eat it last, on its own, with rice and nan, because its distinctive aroma is best appreciated solo.  The only acceptable accompaniment is a plate of cool raita, which serves well to pacify the peppered palate.\n\nThe nans are brilliant. They are best if they are straight out of the oven. Order them as you go and if you feel your nan has been sitting too long, just order a new one. Be stingy with rice, use it only to finish off the curry in dishes like the Kofta and Nihari which are brimming with it. Most of your carbs should come the wonderful nans.\n\nAnother delight of note is the Tandoori Chicken. This is a whole leg of Chicken, marinated in yogurt and dry spices and slow cooked in the wood burning oven. It's deliciously tender, mildly spiced and fastidiously observed by the chef to ensure it retains its original juices. Tandoori Chicken makes a perfect appetizer. However, since it's slow cooked and in high demand, it might turn up after the other dishes, which is fine too. But, please, hold the leg in your two able hands and bite into it with your teeth! As the adage goes, \"eating Indian food with a knife and fork is like making love through an interpreter.\"\n\nThe Tandoori Lamb Chops are the Lamp equivalent of Tandoori Chicken. These are every bit as succulent and substantive as their Chicken counterpart. I tend to alternate between the two.\n\nI often order Haleem, a hardy dish made out of wheat, lentils and beef which has the consistency of mashed potatoes. Haleem has a very mild flavor, and it stands out due to its mostly pure Persian heritage. It's comfort food, Pakistan-style. The palak (aka spinach) dishes, chicken and paneer, are well executed, though they don't make my soul sing. People swear by them, so perhaps you'll enjoy them too. The subji (mixed vegetable) is quite good and nicely rounds up the diet.\n\nFor the devoted foody, or the simply adventurous, the menu also offers Brain Masala, as in lamb brains lightly fried in onions, tomato and spices. I order it from time to time, usually out of alcohol imbibed bravado. The taste is rather hard to place, somewhere in the vicinity of cheese or scrambled eggs, but with an undertone of something quite complex, perhaps a mammalian brain.\n\nThere are, of course, other delectable items on the menu, but I won't call them out because I don't believe they are as inspired as the wonders I mention. Please do try them however, as they still leave a lot of what passes for epicurean in the dust.  Whatever you order, you can be certain of one thing: the talent and the love, that the merry-band of unassuming lads behind the counter pour into every dish, will stand out, clear as day, unsmirched by the cloying pretense of high-food or the hubris of gourmand chefs.\n\nOh, and remember to BYOB.", "author": "Vipul V."}

I actually went to the loo before leaving my house so I wouldn't have to use the one at Shalimar.  \n\nI'm in a bit of a food coma so in no particular order:\n\n-I had dinner with my significant other who is Indian.  He frequents Shalimar often so they recognize him.  It's Saturday at 7pm, the place was packed when we walked in. . .the SO and the host (owner?) start talking to each other in Hindi what sounds to me like a lot of shouting.  A table is immediately cleaned off for us.  \n\n-Shalimar is dirty.  One of the guys who works there wiped the table off with a rag that must have been soaked with oil, ghee, who knows but I sat down and rested my elbows on the table and they sort of stuck.  So I rubbed whatever it was on my elbows to moisturize, got some napkins and gave the table another wipe.  \n\n-Smoky smoky smoky.  My eyes were burning.  This place is smoky!  The grill was smoking off the hizzle and literally we could have all used a pair of goggles.  At one point, a lady (Indian) got up from her table, opened the front door and stuck her head out for a few mins.  No, she did not walk out of the restaurant, she stuck only her head out.  I smell like grill right now.  \n\n-Eating at Shalimar is messy.  I'm not so crazy about eating with my fingers.  I had to let that go tonight at Shalimar.  You know when people shake a champagne bottle and pop it open P. Diddy style while partying and spray it all over everyone?  My SO was just about doing that with the green chutney sauce, sure it's good but is that normal? \n\n-Extreme eating.  Totally extreme eating.  The food here was really good.  I couldn't stop eating the naan and yogurt sauce with the green chutney sauce.  We ordered some saucy homemade cottage cheese thing, grilled tandoori chicken, daal, lamb.  It was all spicy but not so spicy that I can't taste anything now.  It was still spicy, my nose was running, my eyes were watering (from the smoke), our table was unbalanced and the water pitcher kept slipping towards the edge, plates were stacked, children were running around waving cell phones in the air with funny music playing on them, people yelling from the front of the house to the back. . .this meal was extreme.  \n\n-The SO spent the better part of his childhood in India.  He says that Shalimar is the bomb.  Watching him eat at Shalimar was fun.  In all the chaos of Shalimar, he was calm and looked right at home.  That is saying something.  I felt like I was watching a movie happen around me.  Is it always like that at Shalimar?  I don't know but I do know that it was the most eventful meal I've ever had.", "author": "James M."}

But you can figure all that out from the other reviews.  \n\nGas rating: 500\nIt is clear that many types of food give me gas.  Some experiences have been so memorable that I still refer to them by title such as the Broccoli casserole incident of 2005, or the garlic-fry incident of the 2006 Giant's-A's game.  But this incident my friends will go down in history as the gassiest I have EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE.  \n\nObviously Indian food is going to give me some gas.  I'm not naive.  We were having girl's night out, and there was some talk of going dancing afterwards, and I knew this wasn't a good idea.  But we were enthralled by the idea of bringing our own wine so I went along with things.  \n\nBut then...it happened.  One of the girls' ordered garlic naan.  And I loooooove me some garlic.  There was an incident over the summer where I consumed half a head of roasted garlic, and after two days of excreting garlic gas and sweat I vowed to moderate my garlic consumption.  But this night, the garlic spoke to me.  It said - you're with the girls.  No one's trying to hook up tonight.  We'll all be gassy.  You're going to have gas anyway, it's Indian food.  Might as well indulge.  And indulge I did.\n\nWords cannot describe what happened to me for the next 12 hours.  We went out dancing and within an hour, it became clear that I was not fit to be out in public.  Every time I took a sip of beer, out would come a noxious, floor-clearing burp.  I tried doing walk-by burpings where I would burp and then leave the scene of the crime, but really, there are only so many places you can go in a club.  I couldn't dance, I couldn't have a conversation with anyone and I couldn't sit in a corner for fear that the air would become so foul they would call a haz-mat team.  So I left.\n\nLittle did I know, the burping was only the beginning of the cycle.  Several hours later, as the food traveled downward...so did the gas.  It was girl's night out so we were going to have a slumber party, but for the sake of slumber and friendships, I decided to go elsewhere and sleep in isolation.  Actually, I left to have gas in isolation because let me tell you, there was precious little sleep that was had.  I had gas All.  Night.  Long.  That's right people.  I didn't sleep for the whole night.  My gas was loud.  It caused my body to move from the explosions.  I could feel it building in waves.  It was awful.  \n\nThe next morning, the only thing more awful than the gas itself, was my own breath as I was brushing my teeth.  It was garlic, and gas, and Indian food.  I wanted to kill myself.  No one who can create that smell, deserves to live.  I brushed for a looooong time.\n\nMoral of the story - don't eat the garlic naan unless you plan to spend the next couple of days at home.  Alone.  With the windows open.  And the fan on.  And do yourself a favor.  Go buy some Gas-X.", "author": "Soo C."}

In Pakistan, the competition is way fierce as to who makes the best of each. Word of mouth spreads like wildfire, and can easily make or break any place.\r\n\r\nWhen Shalimar opened up in the 'Loin an eon and a half ago, it was way dingier than how it is now (if you can imagine that). My dad was the first to discover it walking through there (why my dad was walking through the Tenderloin around the early 90's is beyond me). But with the food and the Punjabi bantering amongst the owners and cooking staff, along with the feel of a local dhaba from the homeland, my dad was hooked and soon he'd drive the entire family almost an hour into the city just to eat at Shalimar. And they had it all. The naan, the chicken, the kebabs were all excellent. And they were all spicy - just the way we liked it. So what if there were a couple cockroaches on the wall. Who cared? It felt like the homeland, yo.\r\n\r\nThat was then. A few years later, two upstarts called Pakwan and Taj Mahal joined in the fray, and soon the Tandoor-loin was in full effect, with each restaurant branching out into chains, each with its built-in fanbase. Pakwan may have won the battle in the Mission, but Shalimar has consistently held its own in the Tenderloin, regardless of the onslaught of Chutney, Naan N Curry, and countless other places. Each time I've gone in they've never disappointed. They don't skimp on their spices for anyone. You can either handle the heat or you can't. \r\n\r\nThe Tenderloin institution definitely boosted Shalimar's name into the top echelon of Pakistani restaurants amongst the most loyal and hardcore community, Pakistanis themselves.  Hence, when Shalimar opened its Fremont location, it immediately became a massive success and every other Pakistani restaurant saw its sales plummet. Pakwan opened up in Fremont soon after in a red barn, but it stands empty. People only head there if Shalimar's too crowded.\r\n\r\nBut all the success in Fremont can be pointed back to this humble Jones St. restaurant, for that's where its reputation started building long ago. I enjoy all the non-grilled salaans (saucy dishes) as well, but it's the kebabs, naan, and chicken which had me coming back time and time again. Excellent.

Issues with griminess and seediness are all part of the Dionysian experience.\n\nThere are two very different ways that human endeavors can approach perfection.  One is classical moderation - finding just the right harmony between just the right things, putting every element in the best possible place and in the best proportions.  The other is just welcoming AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE of EVERYTHING that's remotely good.  You take some of this and some of that... and then more of this and more of that.  Shalimar is more in line with the latter school.\n\nThat's what this cuisine is all about.  It was invented when someone first said, \"Hey, let's cook something in ghee AND oil AND butter AND cream, and we'll flavor it with onions AND garlic AND chillies AND cilantro!\"  The ambiance is just being consistent with their approach to aesthetics.  The whole point is to feel like the animal that you are.  The wild orgy of your dreams has to be in a sleazy motel, not a church.\n\nWhen you ask Shalimar to clean its bathrooms, you are asking Jackson Pollock to work on his shading.

I could live on their chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, daal masala and garlic naan for the rest of my life and be a happy woman.\n\nIt's cheap, poorly/barely decorated, almost always smoky inside and requires you to visit the Tenderloin but the food is excellent and the staff makes up for what they lack in the way of warmth and personal interaction with efficiency and consistency. I like that it's way casual and maybe even a little scary to some because that means there's less competition for food that I really want and suckers out there who have never had truly good garlic naan.\n\nMy Shalimar tips:\n\n1) Call in your order and pick-up. Since walking around the TL isn't especially fun and street parking is almost impossible at night, getting someone to drop you off and go around the block while you pick up delish Shalimar is a great way to go. They put your curry dishes in paper take-out boxes and wrap them with plastic while the food is still so hot that it's almost like shrink wrap - and just as hard to remove later. This makes it easy to transport by car (or even Muni) without worrying about awful oil stains or spills.\n\n2) For the least sketchy walk to Shalimar, go west on Geary from Union Square and make a left at Jones. This way you only have about 1.5 blocks of true Tenderloin to brave.\n\n3) BYOB. Good thing there's so many liquor stores in the area to choose from.\n\n4) Try the mango lassi. It's yummy and good for spice relief.", "author": "Kristina A."}

We came here on a tip from a friend who said we had to come here when we're in San Francisco because it's what he eats every other day when he's in the area.\n\nHe warned us it was a dirty joint and upon curious visual inspection of the kitchen (which is exposed), I could confirm that. But all of this didn't matter because I had heard such good things about the food. And if it's that good, I'm cool with a cash register sitting right next to the grill.\n\nSo when my wife and I walked in, all of the tables were full, but a table of two stood up almost immediately and left. We waited confused whether to wait to sit there or wait to be seated...? It's not clear how it works here but we stood there by the door for about 2 minutes anyway looking confused and presumably out of place, then we just sat at the dirty table; we didn't want to lose it!\n\nThen this nice man who I thought I saw sitting at the table next to us walked back over and said, \"here, let me get those for you\" and he took this dishes away and then he used one of the soiled paper napkins left on the table to wipe it crumb free for us. Then he informed us: \"You order at the counter. I'll bring you some menus.\" \n\nOK, so the service is pretty friendly...  We thanked him, then, as he started to walk toward the door, I asked him, \"do you work here?\" He said, \"no, I just eat here. I just wanted to help you!\" And he smiled and walked out wit his wife. Hmm...? That was nice. Without him, we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nSo we have the menus and their 2 feet wide, printed like newspapers. The selection is huge and the prices are ridiculously cheap so we ordered tons of stuff.\n\nLamb brain masala - chopped lamb brain in a creamy, spicy masala sauce. Surprisingly delicious. Rich! Very rich... and sort of fatty tasting, at least the consistency was fatty like.\n\nGarlic naan - a thick buttery, freshly baked round of naan bread stuffed with tons of fresh garlic and herbs. Great for dipping in the raita.\n\nRaita - theirs was a thin one - yogurt with cucmber, chopped raisins. Perfect to cool the heat from the entrees.\n\nKofte kebab - a little on the dry side but full of spicy complexity.\n\nTandoori chicken leg - Delicious smokiness that penetrated the meat. Well marinated but not too sweet. And it was moist and hot. Very good!\n\nMurgha chicken something... AKA \"the king of curries\" on their menu - pretty good but it didn't stand out from all of the other good stuff on the table. Bone-in chicken pieces in a reddish oily curry. Good but not wow.\n\nThe meal also came with a plate of sliced onions and jalapenos sprinkled with indian spices. They were good to throw in the naan with the kofte and wrap it up.\n\nYes, the kitchen was grimy and greasy but it lent to the experience.

I was at the Prescott Hotel and decided to boogie down the street in my leisure suit jivin to P-Funk (okay not really but it would have been cool, you must admit) and find something interesting to munch down.  I initially stopped at the Halal Chinese place up the block and wasn't impressed by their five-item buffet, so I stopped in here.  It is certainly a proliteriat-style joint.... not much going on in the way of decor.  Off-white walls, granite-topped tables (cheap ones, though), open kitchen that looks like it was installed a half-century ago.\n\nThe ordering process was a bit odd... go up to the counter, look at the menu (which is on newsprint, in newspaper format??  interesting...), choose your items, order, and then go sit and wait.  Don't pay till you've eaten.  I was a bit turned off by the lack of samosas and pakoras... samosas are one of the ways that I guage an Indian restaurant so I was crushed.  The prices are quite fair... $5.95 for a vegetarian entree, $1 per piece of naan, 2 papadoums, or a bit of raita... not bad at all.\n\nI'd not heard of this place, or how it's been voted best restaurant in SF or in the top 50 restaurants in the US by various journals when I stopped in.  But when they brought my paneer masala to the table, I could certainly see why it's so storied.  It was absolutely wonderful; the sauce was rich without being so imposingly dense like so many other rich masalas are, and the paneer was perfect; firm without being squishy, flavorful without being too intrusive.  The fresh naan was fluffy and light, and the rice was quite flavorful as well.  Wow.  I'll certainly be back here.\n\nThe lack of samosas or pakoras is disheartening, and while what little service there was wasn't impolite, it was very blah and somewhat uninspiring.

Got two chicken items (Murgh Boti Tandoori and on the special I think was called Chicken Jalfrezi), garlic naan, rice, and some chick pea thing and it was a lot of food for 2 people and was $15 per person after tip (though it's self-serve, so tipping ettiquite is in question).  It was the best Indian I've ever had, though I don't have it a lot.  I'd probably get plain naan next time because the garlic was too powerful for my taste, but I still loved all the parts of the meal in concert.

Even the SF cab drivers will tell you -- catch a cab anywhere in the city, ask them to take you to Shalimar near Union Square and they'll all smile and rave. Eat where hard working people on late shifts eat -- they don't suffer foolish food gladly. \n\nSome random thoughts:\n\nI came here with a couple of buddies in the midst of a minor bender once. We were as hungry as only late night drunks can be, and so ordered gluttonously, expansively, with wild gestures and lust for tandoori in our hearts.  We filled the table with curried lamb and skewered chicken and garlic naan. We ate okra.  364 days a year, I am not an okra kind of guy, but we ordered it here and I ate it ravenously.  At some point we came down off our beer high and noticed that we'd embarrassed ourselves. I mean -- I think I had to give the shrt I was wearing away when the dry cleaner failed to defeat the curry stains I nailed myself with that night.  We literally filled the table with food and stared at the unconquerable leftovers with shame. The bill?  I think maybe $30 (including tip).  \n\nI fed a table full of engineers like kings for $200 during the 2007 Game Developers Conference here. My beer bill from the liquor store at the corner was more expensive than the dinner tab.   \n\nAs other have mentioned, this is a cheerfully BYOB establishment. You'll want to buy some booze (I recommend the Redhook ESB or a standard Sam Adams) from the liquor store at Geary & Jones before heading in, then ask around for the bottle opener. Someone somewhere at some table will have it.  If you're on the wagon that night, you will have a religious experience with their thai tea.", "author": "Sean F."}

The place is run by a disdainful man lovingly referred to as the 'Soup Nazi.' He's called this because he is very specific about how customers can get the soup and he doesn't care what you think or say about his establishment or methods because he knows in the end you do what he wants because he has the best soup in town. \n\nShalimar is like the beloved 'Soup Nazi' in that it has horrendous settings and terrible customer service, but at the same time the best Indian food in the city leaving you helpless to shun the place.\n\nLet's get the negatives out first. Shalimar is possibly the dirtest restaurant I've ever been in. I think I've been to food stalls in third world countries that are cleaner than this place. If you want an extra fork, good luck with that. They keep a few up front, but they are in no hurry to\nrefill them once they're gone. The glasses and plates have more spots on them a junkie's arm. \n\nIn terms of customer service remember that patience is a virtue. My wife and I waited 45 minutes for our food until I had to remind them of our order. You can also plan on standing at the counter for a while until someone helps you.\n\nHowever, with all of that being said..... Shalimar is the best Indian food in San Francisco. There goat gosht is mouth-watering, and the seekh kabab is spiced well and lip-smacking. Their naan is fresh and doughy. Shalimar's food is a little oily, but I've never been one to shy away from oily food. \n\nAll in all Shalimar is the best Indian food in the city.

If you don't make eye-contact at the right moment - you might just lose the guy :) The food is always right though, and it finds it's way to your table ~\nI love to eat in this hole in the wall, but it's a good take-out place if you don't want to deal with the atmosphere (or the lack of it) ~", "author": "Shipra K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-07-04", "description": "We had high expectations for this restaurant after our close friends highly praised and recommended it for us. After getting lost through the winding streets of San Francisco, we finally reached it, parking the car in the parking lot adjacent to the restaurant. The restaurant didn't make a very good first appearance; a shabby building and extremely long, packed lines.\nOf course, all this wouldn't matter if the inside of the restaurant and food was good. Sadly, it wasn't any better than it looked from the outside. Because of the packed building, the waiter said we'd have to wait for 2 hours before a table cleared. Instead, he led us out of the back door, and into the other, empty room. As we sat down, the first thing we noticed was the intense stench. In front of the room was a muddy field and vacant, empty home. It reeked of rotten meat and wet dirt; we quickly closed the door.\nUnfortunately, the stench wasn't lessened too much. In the room was a totally soiled bathroom, and the door leading to it didn't close. We moved to the tables farthest away from the bathroom, but that was when we noticed yet another problem; pests. Yup, the room was infested with various insects; cockroaches were on the ceiling lamp and scuttling across the floor, flies were buzzing continually around the room, and spiderwebs hung in the corners of the room. The tables were sticky, and felt like some toddler had spilled orange juice all over it. \nEven this wasn't enough to deter us from the promise of amazing food, though. The waiter finally trudged over to our room and took our orders. We tried to ignore the 'scenery' outside and the stench, and waited...and waited...and waited. I realize that this waiting business is common in almost every single Indian restaurant, but the combined stench and dirtiness prolonged that 40 minutes into 40 hours. Finally, the waiter once again appeared and set down the plates, cups, and utensils, and went back to bring the food. One look at the dirty spoon was enough; we decided to eat with our own hands instead.\nAfter using a napkin to turn on the faucet in order to wash our hands, the food FINALLY arrived. Eager to try the oft-praised and seemingly legendary food of Shalimar, I dug in, pouring Tikki Boti Masala, piling Tandoori Kabab and Chicken, and finally, the famed Garlic Naan. When I finally ate I realized...the food wasn't so great. It wasn't BAD - the Kabab had a slight onion-y flavor to it, the Tandoori was average (even though about half were burned), and the Masala was good (if very greasy)...but it wasn't GREAT either. After I finally finished my dinner, I realized only one thing was amazing - the Naan. Excuse me, but I hadn't come all this way, in this filthy restaurant, waited the better part of an hour to taste NAAN. \nAs I left the building I made a vow to never come back again. This was by far the worst Indian restaurant I've ever been in. The neighborhood and outside appearance was unwelcoming, the lines were long, the other room reeked of stenches, the restaurant was practically infested with pests, the wait was long, the waiter service was unsatisfactory, and the food was, at best, sub-par.", "author": "Adnan P."}

The first time you go in there, you are not quite sure if you're supposed to wait to be seated or help yourself.  We ended up standing around for a couple of minutes trying to figure it out, and no one came to greet us or anything.  We also could not find a menu, until someone pointed to a stack of menus that looked like newspapers.  This in itself is okay, except some had a lot of oil stains on them so it was kind of hard to read.  After ordering, we picked up our own plates and utensils, which looked like they were washed but a little wet.  One of the plates still had a little bit of caked on food on it, so we had to get another one.\n\nAlso, the area is not the best.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-11-29", "description": "Dear Yelp,\n\nThank you for endowing me with all of the great friends, exciting experiences, valuable entertainment, and exquisite information that you have provided over the years.  I am delighted to tell you that I shared a lovely dinner at Shalimar Restaurant last evening with several of my Yelp friends.  As much as I would like to acknowledge my compadres as an expression of gratitude in my letter to you, their names will remain anonymous.   \n\nDinner itself was quite the experience. Although utterly lacking in decor, and possibly even verging on the filthy, Shalimar's dumpiness and Tenderloin backdrop provide an abundance of character.  When I spotted an ideal parking spot on Jones Street directly fronting the restaurant, one of the Tenderloin's many characters (this one happening to be lacking teeth) accommodated me, reserving the spot for me and then, carefully directing me in my parallel parking effort with his indispensable valet services.  Upon exiting my vehicle I was more than surprised to find that he fancied payment for this service, which I had understood was complimentary.  When I told the toothless valet that I did not have any cash on me, I was utterly flabbergasted to hear the two words that would next fall from his dentally-challenged orifice:  \"fuck you\",  two words which sent me on the scoot to the restaurant's front door to await the others.\n\nAs I waited, I went into the Shalimar for my first peek: it is stark, austere even.  I ask if they take credit, but its cash only.  By this time, one of my cohorts has shown up, so we go down to the corner store to get some cash, passing by the toothless valet and several of his friends.  \n\nWe come back and are joined by our other Yelp companions.  We go inside and order lavishly.  We order all kinds of dishes. So many dishes. Chicken dishes, lamb dishes, vegetable dishes, saffron rice, naan.  Here was a south Asian feast and it was all really good.  We had gotten some beer from the corner store as well and were just having a jovial time of it.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the beer flowed, stories began to trickle forth.  Stories of Yelp.  First gossip.  And then, not just gossip, but full-blown stories rich with colorful detail.  As I listened intently to the stories unfolding, my jaw just dropped lower and lower.  These stories were about sexual relations.  You know, hooking up.  \"FTF's\" (Friends That Fuck). \"Fuck buddies.\" Three-ways. Copulation. Fornication.  \"DYL\" tours.  *Borderline orgies*.  For those of you who don't know or get what I'm talking about, TOTAL DEBAUCHERY IS WHAT IS BEING DESCRIBED TO ME.  My eyeballs boggled and nearly popped out of my skull as I watched the words fall whimsically from my Yelp companions' moistened lips.  My earballs burned and throbbed as I listened to these stories, gasping at some of the particularly detailed anecdotes.  Neighboring patrons glared at our table as the volume rose with every boisterous hoot, every raucous holler and every haughty, self-satisfied belly laugh.  The stories even inspired me to add a new character to my \"Cast of Yelp Characters, Act Two\" (please see \"Yelp Slut\" http://www.yelp.com/biz/lsu5qhNB1NEFWn4bApeHOA?hrid=xbkIxSTqkRuDVnKgB6-UQg).\n\nIt was 10 pm when we finally finished.  I must admit that, by the end of the night, I was a bit queasy from all the dizzying and shocking tales of Yelp depravity.  This wasn't helped by the insistence of two members of our party that we order \"jalebees\" for dessert, which turned out to be India's version of deep fried cheetos and tasted like they had been marinated overnight in the Ganges River (the south part). \n\nThe point of my letter, Yelp, is this...\n\nPLEASE COPY ME ON THE MEMO NEXT TIME YOU ARE PLANNING TO HAVE WILD WANTON DEBAUCHEROUS CARNAL LUDE ROMAN EMPIRE-STYLE ANIMAL SEX. \n\nThank you for your attention in this matter.

BYOB and crack a freshie while you await ecstasy on porcelain.  if you need to use the bathroom, feel free to step into the full suite, complete with shower stall cum paint storage closet.  \r\n\r\nafter you gut down on the tastiest indian food in san francisco, you roll yourself out of there and start to notice the extended list of health code violations.  and you do it with a huge smile of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nif you are under the influence of intoxicants, don't forget to pay because they ain't bringing you a check.", "author": "W G."}

If anything, this Shalimar is slightly better than the Fremont location, in that the \"waiter\" does show sympathy to those poor souls waiting at their tables for water and a menu and actually bring those items to them, rather than making them go up to the counter and order like everyone else.  Believe me, there is no such sympathy in Fremont.\n\nIn any case, onward to my meal, which was great...not as great as that of the Fremont location, but good nonetheless.  We ordered the usual- plain naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, tandoori chicken legs, chicken kofta and a new one for us- the bangun bhurjia (eggplant).  The naan is super-fresh so no complaints there- its great to eat alone or with the curry.  The tandoori chicken leg- also super-fresh- comes slightly charred and smokey, with a delicious spice rub on the outside that has you licking your fingers.  The chicken tikka masala- definitely spicy, definitely tasty, but perhaps with a touch too much ghee.  The chicken kofta- one of my favorites- is a milder curry, so it gives you a break from the spiciness of the chicken tikka masala and the lamb curry.  The chicken meatballs are tender and full of flavor.  The eggplant was fabulous- almost like the Indo-Paki version of baba ghanouj.  Lots of great flavor and spices, though you do have to be careful not to bite into one of the whole cloves or cardamon seeds.  The only disappointment was the lamb curry which was mostly all bone. \n\n4 stars for the meal and the freakishly good free chai tea, which is so freakishly good because they don't use too much cardamon.  Even after being completely stuffed by the meal, we'll manage to put away two to three cups each.  I'm subtracting one star just because my stomach didn't agree with that much ghee.  I'd definitely recommend going, but for a better experience overall, head over to their location in Fremont.", "author": "Angela H."}

The ambiance is pretty bad (thus 3 stars instead of 4) and of the three we visited that night, this one had the most tandori smoke floating around.

I ended up only trying three different vegetarian plates and have yet to try the chicken tikka marsala. One of my friends was vegeterian and another was a health freak so I had to put a hold on my chicken dish. Next time though I will and most definitely order that dish as I heard good things.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-09", "description": "I know people who will drive three hours for Shalimar's seekh kebabs, which are the real reason to go.  Shalimar is, and it's pretty well established, the best Pakistani food spot in the Bay Area.  The, uh, ambiance isn't for everyone.  Or, really, anyone except those nostalgic for their favorite corner dive in Karachi (when it was bombed out by India during the last war).  I sympathize with the people who never want to set foot in Shalimar.  I've got a pretty strong stomach but \"the rag\"...  the orange, crusty, tikka towel that is overdue for its annual cleaning is enough to make me get take out 9 out of 10 times.  \n\nBut for those who want the experience here is my best advice:\n\n1. There is no line.  There are only polite people waiting in a line that doesn't exist.  Just walk up to the counter, say \"ayar\" -- means buddy in urdu -- and place your order.\n\n2. Fire to plate.  I only order stuff that I can see go from the sanitizing influence of a the fire straight onto my plate.  E.g., naan, tikka, kebabs, etc.  I don't do saag.  The only exception I allow is for the basmati.  Break this rule more than three times at your own peril.\n\n3. Cash only.  You won't want to walk around the neighborhood looking for an ATM. \n\n4. Bring your own drinks.  If you like beer feel free to bring your own.  You won't be judged.  Even though, strictly speaking, you're going to hell.\n\n5. Free chai.  Cups of tea are free.  Don't forget to pour in about three tablespoons of sugar.  I think that's sweetened and condensed milk in there, which would explain why we all like it so much.\n\n6. Time the naan.  Wait until the naan is fresh.  This may require a little hovering.  But, if the naan stack is down to 2-3, there's a fresh one coming.  Pretend you're studying the menu.\n\n7.

We'd been wandering around the city all day and, after spending more time debating where to get dinner then it would actually take us to eat it, we were ravenous by the time we settled on and arrived at Shalimar.\n\nWe ordered half the menu and then waited. Now, let me say one thing: my family eats really slowly. I was the \"fastest eater\" but I guess that's not saying much as my family, until fairly recently, consisted only of myself and my parents. So, in general, no matter how hard I try, usually everyone else at the table has had their plate cleared except me and I've still got half the entree to go. I have heard kids from larger families describe the face-stuffing-races they and their siblings engaged in to make sure they got their share of the food. Well, once the food arrived at our table, I got to experience that first hand.  In under 15 minutes, possibly less, all the spicy savory food did an amazing disappearing act! In those 15 minutes the conversation was limited to comments like \"mmm, this chicken is awesome,\" \"pass me the nann,\" \"did you try the tandori boti?,\" \"is there any more aloo keema? \"you want the last potato? I'll split it with you.\"  Once we realized that, short of licking the dishes, there wasn't anything left on the table to eat we took a breather. And debated getting more food. The light and fluffy nan? Another aloo keema? should we try something else?\n\nBut after letting what we'd eaten settled for a few moments we decided more food could wait for another night and so we move on to the  grand finale, an order of the Gulab Jaman, warm gooey syrupy spheres of heaven. \n\nI'm looking forward to going back, especially now that I know it's BOYB. Maybe next time I'll take my girlfriends so I won't have to eat Cookie Monster style.", "author": "Camille H."}

Cooks and dishwashers seem to trade places with each other regularly and periodically half the crew walks out of the back door as more come to replace them without missing a beat. There is only one constant behind that counter, a tall dominating figure, who seems to tower over the others, causing them to cower as they pass by on their way for more Naan. I'll call him the Alpha Man - he says nothing, just points and stares at the others who seem to understand his silent orders - watching this makes me anxious and afraid, I feel like at any minute he is going to point at me and I will have to run back there and mop the floor or something - he definitely runs this place. \n\nThe small army that runs Shalimar is only concerned with one thing - making great tasting, authentic food - they don't care if you're comfortable, they don't even care if you come back - they know they're good at what they do. Swagger.

When I lived in SJC I did make the trek up to their Fremont location a couple of times for take-out and it was pretty good. Finally on Friday me and a friend hit up the Tenderloin location for some good eats and the inevitably good people-watching that always comes with being in the Tenderloin. They have 2 other locations as well - 1 in SF and 1 in Santa Clara (though their website still claims coming soon eventhough I see it has reviews up already). This one I'd qualify as a pseudo-hole-in-the-wall . . . not super concerned with decor but with cool wall designs and great aromas wafting about.\n\nWe had no luck with street parking so decided to fork up $7 to park just across the street. My friend needed cash, so we hit up the ATM that's to the left of Shalimar . . . only to wait we listened to it dial-out once, tell him there was a \"dispensing error\", then try dialing-out again only to return with the same message. Meanwhile, I enjoyed watching the yocals pacing up and down the street, muttering to themselves or possibly anyone close enough to them that were listening & also happened to be fluent in crazy.\n\nOn to the food. It was fantastic. I have to withhold one star because they couldn't keep up with the demand for their chai so everyone had to keep going back up when a fresh pot was put out. This does support the fact that the chai was smooth and delicious. We almost ordered more that could fit on our table: lamb chops which were brilliantly spiced and tender, chicken tikka masala which very good & not  too rich, curried garbanzo beans in an attempt to have something kind of healthy, palak paneer which I love but have to watch out for pieces of some spice seed they don't grind up that I don't really care for, we also ended up with some grilled chicken breasts that I don't recall ordering, and of course some fresh garlic nann.

Then we moved onto the rest of the feast. We were adventurous and tried the Goat dish which comes with bones and all. The meat is tender and spices are perfect.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-18", "description": "3.5 stars\n\nA couple nights ago my friend Matt and his wife Karla took me out for some delicious Indian and Pakistani cuisine on Indian row in the 'loin. I had heard high praise for Shalimar, as well as some cautionary tales (greasy, do not use the bathrooms, etc). It is definitely a no frills greasy spoon without any pretensions; I found the place to be clean, if sparsely and simply decorated. But it's not about the ambience, or for that matter the service here (we were given dishes we did not order twice, you need to pay attention and be vigilant as the plates start arriving!) It's about greedily eating some of the most authentic, perfectly seasoned Indian and Pakistani food around. Each place setting is provided with a 'Shalimar Times,' basically a four page tabloid printout explaining what Shalimar is about, with a menu on the inside. An excerpt states, \"SHALIMAR'S CULINARY PHILOSOPHY: 'No substituions to fit the local tastes, no frills or nuevo cuisine, but sensible, genuine, tasty hearty and wholesome food.' In each guest we look forward to 'many happy returns.' \" The interesting word usage and liberal smattering of quote marks makes for entertaining pre-meal reading.\n\nOn to the food. We ordered 3 types of flavored naan (onion, garlic, and spicy potato). All were flavorful and properly moist and chewy. Okra and tomatoes was delicious - rich and velvety fresh okra, piquant from the simmered tomatoes, and very savory and authentic from a liberal use of hing. Pureed eggplant (bengen bhujia) was tasty, with a good amount of onion and a strong cardamom seasoning which was the dominant flavor of this dish. Even better was the tandoori chicken (murgh boti tandoori), crisp and well seasoned with spices and vinegar. The standout dish, however, was saag gosht - a combination of tender braised lamb and spinach, with ginger, coriander, and a more mild blend of spices.\n\nNo wine to wash this food down. It's a BYOB and I was caught unprepared, no riesling on me and neighborhood shops are fine for tall boys of beer but that's about it. So it was all washed down with a Bass ale. Which was fine, even Riesling would have a tough time handling much of this food. I wholeheartedly reccommend Shalimar for folks who can deal with a slightly sketchy neighborhood, poor service and a slightly louder than usual blend of hip-hop and Bhangra. At Shalimar, it's all about the food.", "author": "joe m."}

Shalimar awarded the coveted SIXTH STAR !!\r\nOfficially the standard by which all other sources of sustenance are judged !\r\n\r\nWhen you come in, don't sit down.\r\nYou go up to the counter and order first.\r\nIf you come in and sit at a table and wait for service, you'll be waiting a really long time (and people will laugh at you).\r\nLet me interrupt this diatribe to mention that the food absolutely rocks at Shalimar - sure, the place has it's drawbacks, the toothless woman sitting on the sidewalk outside, the dirty silverware, the pools of oil on top of some of the dishes, etc. But if you can get past the sheer grossness of the place, you're in for a treat. Some hints: Murgh Boti Tandoori (chunks of white meat chicken flash-cooked in the Mesquite Tandoor - top pick. Chicken Tikka Masala - if your heart can handle the cholesterol of the heavy cream that's used in it (check out the refrigerator shelves crammed with the stuff), it doesn't get any better than this. The Lamb Boti (Tandoori Lamb Chops) is supposed to be awesome as well, but I don't eat mammals. Don't miss out on the mint sauce (remember to wipe off the tip of the container before squirting the stuff directly into your mouth), the traditional rice, or any of the Naan. Another fun tip is to take a pool with your companions on what the tab is going to be - you can order the exact same dishes on every visit, and your check will always be different.

Ordering - which is done at the counter - can be a challenge, and you might be stranded there watching the counterman chop massive piles of chicken if you don't assert yourself and shout out your order. It helps to know what the different dishes are in advance. Palak paneer had a clean, spinach taste and tender chunks of cheese. Chicken tikka masala was nice, but lacked character; chicken saag had more kick and was a better choice. The lamb chops, unfortunately, were cooked almost past medium-well, and were dry as a result, but the aromatic rice was flavorful enough to make amends. Portions are large and prices are reasonable.

We did take out last night along with some friends - had tandoori chicken, naan, palak paneer and chicken tikka masala. The palak paneer was ok with feew pieces of paneer but the other dishes were excellent. The place itself is a hole in the wall and there is no customer service but the food more than makes up for it. Love coming here.", "author": "P From CA C."}

For those that manage to get past the homelessness of the area, there is no respite.  Disappointingly not homey or fresh tasting.  As to ambience...please:  a hybrid cheap asian restaurant -sticky table, fluorescent light...dirty vibes.

First, the bathroom might have been the worst I've ever had to use in the U.S. and worse than 98% of the restrooms I used when I went to India.  (I'm talking about the bathroom outside to the left.)  I don't think the bathroom has ever been cleaned and looks like people have just peed all over the walls for the past 20 years without anyone doing anything about it.  Second, on the way back into the restaurant after the bathroom experience, I saw large buckets of chicken and meat sitting outside in the alley.  That's right, buckets of raw meat, hanging outside not on ice or anything, probably about to go into the kitchen and onto diners' plates.  To be fair, I have no proof of what actually happened with that meat, but I'm just saying... kind of gross.", "author": "Rebecca S."}

No, really love this place. I'm gonna have shirts made up. If anyone has a room in the TL for rent, hit me up. I wanna be closer to this place. I'm super upset my friend is moving out. Which brings me to my story. We were hanging out here, having a house cooling party, and I got a powerful hunger. I had read \"The Namesake\" that day (super easy but engrossing read), and was feeling Indian subcontinental. So I asked for some decent Indian food close by. Shalimar was thrown out, mostly cause it was close. And good. So I trekked the one whole block. Crazies leaping out of trees, over exposed breasts heading to the Ambassador, the whole nine yards. Of course, Shalimar was just as hectic indoors as it was outdoors. And cash only. And kinda took a second to figure out. And then find a menu. And I for sure wanted take out. I don't think I would ever eat sitting at a table. But maybe drunk. Cause curries and beers is like cigarettes and coffee. Anyway, the food was delish, even eating off a laptop desk in a tiny Tenderloin studio.", "author": "Matt L."}

Sure, I expected to have a delicious meal but I didn't realize how much I'd enjoy the various dishes we ordered.  We ordered some of their lentil and chick peas dishes and those were very good.  The lamb curry was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of spice.  The tikka masala was the best I've ever had!!!  Shalimar also had potato naan, onion naan and garlic naan,  all of which were soft and had a slight sweet taste.  The portions were very generous and I appreciate the free chai and low key atmosphere.  I am sure to be back soon.", "author": "Mika S."}

The tandoor meat dishes are really well prepared, the food is relatively fresh and the spices are well proportioned.  Highly recommend it and would go back.  Very diverse crowd and pretty busy.

It's cheap, the menus are printed on newspaper, and there's not much atmosphere.  Saag Paneer tends to be my go-to indian dish, and I wasn't particularly impressed by it here.  However, one of my indian friends swears by this place, so maybe it depends what you get.  No liquor license, so it's the always exciting go-to-the-corner-store-BYOB experience.  Not crazy about it, but if you're short on cash, this place might come in handy.", "author": "Patrick P."}

Located in the heart of the 'loin its a bit of an adventure, but hey its part of the fun (who doesn't like goth strippers...). When your on your journey be sure to stop for refreshments at the liquor store on the corner as its BYOB. Much like most people I cant help but order the Chicken Tikka Masala... oh the excellence. Unlike all the other places I mentioned above the Masala curry at shalimar is *alot* spicier than most places, instead of the cream light orange/tan color found at most places you get a rich and spicy deep dark orange curry. I've tried several other dishes and all are at or above par to other places i've been, the eggplant is especially good.  Anyway, stop reading this get your butt on MUNI, bring a couple friends, and be prepared to have a great time contemplating how the Buddha fasted with such great food around.", "author": "Chris F."}

I like Shalimar, it's cheap, convenient (relative to where I live), and it has good Chicken Tikka Masala. One of the great complaints I have (the 0.25 stars it is missing) is that the Naan is just mediocre. Its neighbors have better Naan (Naan N Curry / Lahore Kirahi).  Beware, if you walk in for more than one second, you WILL smell like it even if you leave right after. So don't check it out until you're ready to order.

It started as I was tired which is always a good way to get going. Then toiling went south. \nafter opposite of fred toiling I went to force freding practice but I was the only one in attendance.\nI then called Urban Diversion about the location of happy hour and was told jones and geary. I was angrily looking for the joint cursing google and ud when I saw that I had made a mistake and that I was on O farrel. \nonce I was at the joint I decided to hit shalimar. I called them on the phone and asked about their credit card status. I did not understand their answer so I assumed they were part of the 21st century movement away from cash.\nWhen I got there they said cash only and pointed me to one of those no name atms which charge $4. As I am not a fool I freded down to union square and withdrew $20. I hate carrying cash. I returned to shalimar where they gave me three $5 which was good because I hate presumptive tips. After all of this the chana masala was good. As they are in a dodgy neighborhood they need to accept credit cards. I would pay a surcharge if that would help but as a business do not whine.", "author": "Marcus R."}
