For a while I had been saying I wouldn't go to this Starbucks if not for the convenient location to where I work because drinks are often made wrong. This morning was the last straw. I put a mobile order through and it was like the batista didn't even read the ticket. I knew ahead of time they often skimp our on syrups and toppings, so I ordered with extra toppings and an additional pump of syrup. It came to me with no whipped cream, no cinnamon Dolce sprinkles (all part of the default recipe) and it did not taste nearly right.\n\nThis isn't even to mention the staff. I've had maybe 2 good experiences with them and I've been going at least twice a week for months.\n\nIt's convenient to the mall but it's not worth it. Visit one of the cafes in the mall for your coffee (caffe central and Cafe bellini are rather nice) or head over to the DavidsTea.\n\nAll this I know is my fault for continuing to go here knowing the service is bad, but hopefully I can spare a few of you from having your morning starbucks ruined.\n\nAnd I don't want to sound like one of those girls, but my fianc\u00e9 works for starbucks. I know the quality and the standards of service that should be provided across EVERY starbucks location. This place doesn't meet them. \n\nThe extra ten minutes to walk over to union Square or 4th street before I get to work are worth getting my orders right.", "author": "Madison H."}

After walking from the Civic Center Plaza (Lotus Live, courtesy of the Asian Art Museum) my brother and I arrived at the Westfield Shopping Mall. We were hungry and we wanted a quick bite to eat. I did not want Chipotle or Panda Express food for lunch. We decided on the Starbucks near the Powell Street Station. \n\nThe young baristas were courteous and pleasant. One heated my tomato mozzarella panini and gave it to me promptly. My brother had the steak and egg breakfast wrap and a grande iced vanilla latte. I had to wait a while for my tall iced skinny cinnamon dolce latte. There was a line of customers and the place was busy. \n\nThis Starbucks is one of those order to go places. There is no seating. It is just a basic kiosk. I am seldom disappointed with the food, beverages and the customer service at most Starbucks. However, when I took the first sip of my beverage, it lacked the cinnamon. My latte had a bland taste. Barista forgot to sprinkle the cinnamon, the drink had more ice than latte (2.5 stars). I can only surmise because of location (Westfield) that the tall latte cost me 30\u00a2 more than my local Starbucks. \n\nLesson learned. Go to a Starbucks where they have tables and chairs. \n\nGenerally, I give Starbucks a 4 star rating, but sadly I cannot do so here. The 2.5 star rating is rounded up to a 3 star rating.", "author": "Carol C."}

The ONE and only staff member making the beverages was visibly disconnected to the quality of his drinks clearly as my Caramel Machiato was just warm water and whatever sweetener served to me in a dirty cup that got syrup all over my hands just before I walked into  bart. Standing there against the wall, because there was not one single chair nor anything else to help relieve the pain of this visit forcing you to watch the misery of each of the staff members in motion, I had noticed the barista made an extra ice water that no one claimed so I asked if I could please take it and he smiles, shrugs, tells me \"I don't care what you do.\" All while the third staff member was looming around while crying and trying to find ways to help what obviously looked like a stressed environment with the most scared pouted face - crying while refilling the napkins!\n\nIf I was looking for a watery milky warm random beverage this is the #1 spot to come in for.

So bad that I couldn't wait to write this review.\n\nI came here tonight (12/27) around 5:30pm to a line to get my usual drink. The line of six people ahead of me was expected, it being holiday season and all and this location is pretty good about getting people in an out in a timely manner.\n\nI'm second to next in line and all of a sudden, a guy comes out of line and just comes up to one of the cashiers (it looks like they were friends) and starts talking to her and the cashier pours him a green tea and sends him on his way, no money paid. When you have a line going OUT OF THE DOOR, this is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE as we are paying customers and we should be helped out first. Unfortunately, this is NOT the first time I have seen this happen at this particular location.\n\nI finally placed my order for my drink and then I sit and wait 20 minutes for it. Apparently, a gentleman in front of me ordered a bunch of drinks and they were unprepared for that...which would be believable had I not seen just ONE barista working the espresso machine and FOUR in the back restocking things. Seriously? CALL FOR HELP.\n\nAmidst all of this, one of the women waiting for her drink kindly asked the barista for a drink of water while she waited and she was told that she had to go all the way back in line (which had doubled in size at this point) to get it because the Barista didn't have any cups...WHICH WERE IN ARMS REACH. It looked VERY LAZY on her part and very RUDE. Like I said, mind you there were other employees just lollygagging in the back rearranging coffee beans, etc.\n\nOnce the woman who requested water left, the baristas started to make fun of her saying \"ain't nobody got time for that!\" completely within earshot of everyone waiting for their drink.\n\nOn top of all of this, I NEVER GOT MY DRINK. I had to go back to the barista and ask for a refund. I was fed up with waiting and the HORRIBLE service I received.\n\nI've been a loyal patron of this location since it opened back in 2005-2006 and I've watched the staff change numerous times and I must say that this set right now makes this location look AWFUL and I doubt I will ever return here after this f***ery that went on tonight.", "author": "Trav M."}

I remembered Starbucks sent me a member exclusive email a few days ago regarding a free tall Caramel Macchiato drink with the purchase through my registered Starbucks card which is definitely different from the massive posts around the net a week ago regarding a free Caramel Macchiato. \n\nSo, I went in the shop, took out my Starbucks card and showed my phone with the email from Starbucks regarding the free drink. The Caucasian male Batista behind the counter said, \"I need to see the actual coupon\" and showed me one of those coupons from a week ago regarding a free drink. So I told him this wasn't the same as the free drink from the week before.  I received a personal email with a code. He said \"I need to see the coupon on your Starbucks account\". Really? I registered the card under Starbucks to receive emails from them so I showed him who the sender was and told him to enter the code. He got annoyed and entered the code. \"The code is not valid and have been used.\" I have not been to Starbucks for the past two weeks so there was no way I could have used the card and code. After trying to tell him to try the code again and that the email is indeed from Starbucks for the next 15minutes, he started giving off attitude like I was trying to get a free drink. Since I did not want to hold up the line, I just ordered another drink. While I was waiting in line, I saw this lady that just went up to another cashier, showed her a code from her phone and ordered her free drink. \n\nThat incident ruined my mood. If I see that Caucasian male ever again at Starbucks, I will be sure to get his name. Funny thing, I walked down the street to another Starbucks and asked if I can use the coupon and was told that as long as I had my registered card I was able to get it. Bottom line, I did end up getting my free drink, but the customer service and workers' attitude at the Westfield Starbucks needs to be fixed.", "author": "Shanna C."}

I mean i hate to be at work 9am on a storming day, who wouldnt?! but i dont walk into work looking all grumpy! Minus 1 star for them!\n\n2nd of all, these people work SOOO SLOWWWWWWW. i mean c'mon, how long does it take to get my cup of brew coffee?? in top of that, the workers left their ears at home! they don't ask if you want a certain thing. \n\nExample of leaving their ears at home. I ordered a cup of coffee with  morning bun. i dont know how she heard WARM...  NO, i dont want my cinnamon bun warm, thank you very much! giving me a half ass sorry that i seriously don't need if you're not sincere about it. MINUS 1/2 a star\n\nExample of NOT ASKING: i order the oatmeal, not my 1st time ordering their oatmeal but at least other Starbucks would as if i want water in there or no. because some people don't like to walk around eating oatmeal in downtown! without asking me they decided to just add hot water in my oatmeal. when i said I DONT WANT WATER, it was already too late. the girl with the glasses & dark skin. (YOU CANT MISS HER, SHE IS SOME KIND OF ASIAN WITH LONG HAIR.) gave me the DEADLY stare like she was going to slice me up into pieces again DID not apologize to me. \n\nI am avoiding this place  from now on! I'll walk across the street to the starbucks on Market and 4th where people are much more friendlier and don't look like they ate $hit before work.

Seeing that they are located in a BART station, where people are trying to get in and out of there probably more quickly than other Starbucks, they should consider working maybe just a teeny bit faster. I've missed my train and almost missed my train multiple times waiting for my drink. I've gotten there at least 10 minutes before most of my trains too, so I've definitely allowed enough time. Some things I can point out for the management at Starbucks (it just might save you guys some more bad reviews): 1) stop having your employees mindlessly chat with customers when there is a long line of customers waiting - there's a difference between being friendly and chatting up a storm like your catching up with an old friend 2) if there are 4 baristas on the floor, have more than 1 making the drinks... Seems like a no brainier when there are 10 drinks to be made - are you guys just lazy or have no common sense? 3) make the drinks a little quicker, I've had my drink put out before I've even finished paying at other Starbucks and it tastes great, while you guys take forever and frankly I've had way better tasting drinks.
