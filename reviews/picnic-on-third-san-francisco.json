Picnic on Third serves comfort-style food crafted in unique ways.\n\nThere's good news and great news depending on how you dine here. If you are one of the many MealPal patrons that frequent this place, the 20 meal plan gets you a very healthy portion of a protein (usually chicken) and a side for less than six dollars! If you just order the standard meals, you'll get two large sides of you choice plus the protein and personally I find this option to be way too much food. Those people who complain that the MealPal portions are too small are clearly used to eating at Chipotle or something for lunch because it's more than enough.\n\nI've had a bunch of different dishes here. I think my favorites have been chicken that has featured a mustard dressing of some sort but honestly all of them have been really good. They have plenty of great veggies every day but personally I'm partial to their broccoli and brussle sprouts.\n\nWhat's not to like? The space is pretty plain. You're not going to want to hang out here and chill out. Recently with Mealpal they switched from \"veggie of your choice\" to a pre-ordained option which is kind of a bummer because a lot of us have dietary restrictions where we were relying on Picnic for veggie options, and now they often have rice a couple of times a week (not to mention root veggies like carrots) which can be off limits for some people.\n\nAll in all, a great place for breakfast and particularly lunch.

A lovely ambiance and I loved the yogurt and granola dish sweetened with homemade apple butter. This place is full of cuteness. \n\nMy only minor complaint so far is that the tea service is about normal for SF/America, which is to say, not that great. Nice selection of fancy-looking tea (Lavender Earl Grey!), but the little spoons at the tea service station are too short for the tall mugs, and there's no dish provided to deposit the used tea bag, for those of us that don't want tea to steep forever. An option for a pot of tea would be lovely for communal tea. Like I said, this is all minor and par for the course for American tea service, but given how cute this place, I think some sort of dainty, well-thought tea service might be a nice addition, perhaps?\n\nBathrooms: Only one single-occupancy unisex restroom, but spacious, clean, and functional.", "author": "Jimmy H."}

But after a few times I find myself having a bit of a mixed reaction. \n\nFirst, let's describe this place a little. They serve a menu from one cuisine daily, so you something a little different every day. They have a few proteins to choose from, and there's always a vegetarian option. There are also special drinks, desserts, or something to snack on that you can buy. The restaurant is small, and you order first before finding a seat. \n\nEverything they have sounds good on paper, especially if you are diverse tastes. It will always be interesting. \n\nMy main gripes? Both times I went, there was a little something off with my dish. I usually get one of the main compositions (meat or vegetarian), and I remember a little bitter taste or a little weird flavour in the dish. Not sure if I munched on a bit of a spice pod or a burnt bit - but it stuck, and sorta made the dish much less perfect than it would have been. \n\nPlus, the dishes are a bit pricey! I realize this is in the city, but I don't work for a fancy start up and so dishing $14 for a normal plate of food seems a bit much. There are way better deals in this part of town. \n\nHowever, the \"one cuisine a day\" concept kept me coming back. Guess I'm still intrigued by surprises!", "author": "Alice C."}

But sadly, they're no longer offering weekend brunch! I don't work around the area so unfortunately probably won't get a chance to return anytime soon.\n\nI really liked the vibe of the place. Small, quaint, lots of light, casual, laid-back atmosphere. The menu isn't very big, which makes ordering easy, and the food is pretty simple but still delicious. And pretty healthy, well-balanced options overall.\n\n* OVERNIGHT CHILE BRAISED PORK ($13) - 4/5\n[poached eggs, cheddar grits, braised collards]\nI'm usually not a fan of Southern-influenced dishes like grits and collard greens, but I actually really enjoyed this. The pork was tender and flavorful; the eggs were nicely soft-boiled with a runny yolk; the grits were creamy and buttery, but not at all heavy; and the greens were tender and not overly sour. The chile salt on the eggs was a nice touch too.\n\n* CORNED BEEF HASH ($12.50) - 3.5/5\n[fried eggs, fingerlings, brussels, horseradish]\nSo they actually ran out of corned beef when we came and said they would substitute with a pork instead. Little did we know that pork actually just meant some simple bacon, not pulled pork like I was expecting. Had I known that, I would've asked them to use the chile braised pork instead. I think without the corned beef, this dish was pretty lackluster. The only saving grace was the brussels sprouts, which were delicately crispy and buttery.\n\n* STEEL CUT OATMEAL ($5)\nServed with some sort of sweet jam and nut butter. I'm not really an oatmeal person but I did like the jam and nut butter.\n\n* HOUSE YOGURT & GRANOLA ($5)\nI wasn't expecting much from yogurt and granola, but the yogurt was surprisingly good. Thick and not too tangy. Good granola too.", "author": "Jessie L."}

When I asked for a menu, she said it was on the chalkboard and gestured to the wall behind us. (I should clarify, she wasn't being rude per se but just very lackadaisical and seemed zoned out, which is whatever.) \n\nThey basically had three options: chicken, pork or vegetarian, with sides of asparagus, slaw, or rice (you pick 2 sides). I ordered the pork with asparagus and slaw after another employee told us you could substitute the sides. The pork was cooked well and was super tasty and hot, but there was a ton of fat. The asparagus was limp and room temperature and the slaw was weirdly oily.  My sister went with the vegetarian option which was literally one deviled egg, with like...probably two cups of rice and asparagus. I felt bad that her meal looked so unappetizing.. the deviled egg portion (seriously one egg?!) was a joke, on top of a huge mound of rice with some limp asparagus. Little dinner rolls were included which was nice but the rolls are clearly pre-packaged (similar to Hawaiian rolls, but with salt on top).\n\nThe total came to $27 before tip ($14 for the pork, $13 for the vegetarian) \n\nBecause this place is close and other reviewers have glowing reviews, I'll probably give them another shot, but as it stands the combination of extremely mediocre service and somewhat half-assed food, for now it's a 2/5.", "author": "Sarah L."}

A mix of regular and sweet potatoes is fried with crispy lardons, Brussels sprouts, and topped off with a fried egg.

I chose to eat the two-hash which has potato totters with a lightly fried egg, brussel sprouts, green onion and bacon bits. Even though it was a light lunch, it was super delicious it felt pretty healthy compared to most other lunches I've had in the city. Everything was lightly fried or baked\n\nI really liked how everything blended together very well in the dish, they put a lot of thought of which ingredients to put, how much to put and even plated it fairly well. I really enjoyed this meal because it tasted so good together and I'll definitely be back again.\n\nMy friend got the pancakes and they were really filling but delicious. They had this cranberry-maple syrup sauce with real cranberries and pancakes that were made fresh with a unique batter that resulted in a nice thick pancake. You could feel the coarseness of the pancake as you eat it, like it breaks down into chunks, it's hard to explain but it makes it feel like you're eating authentic pancakes.", "author": "Christopher L."}

It's an incredibly popular lunch place in SOMA, and most everyone I know loves this place. \n\nExcept me. \n\nI've been here about four times so far, and the menu's always changing. But I've never been blown away by the food--in fact, I've always been slightly disappointed in my order. One time, it was a curry; another time, it was some type of poultry (which was overcooked). Today, I opted for the pastrami creation, which came with green beans sauteed with slice almonds and a latke. The pastrami wasn't great. The green beans were...uninspiring would be the best word, I guess, as much as food can be inspiring or not. There were several I ate that made me suspect these were canned, but I highly doubt they are.

My friend and I were looking for a spot near both of us and she suggested Picnic. I was a little hesitant due to my prior lunch experience but Picnic's brunch truly blew it out of the water. This is a hidden gem that doesn't require you to get up before the crack of dawn and wait for hours in line to get served.\n\nThe brunch menu is small but each item is well thought out and executed. I ordered the cornmeal cheddar pancakes, which sounded interesting and tasted amazing. It was a feast for the eyes and the belly. The pancake batter was light and fluffy. The prosciutto and green onions added the right savory flavors to balance the dish. It was definitely an unique dish I haven't seen elsewhere.

The service here was especially friendly and helpful with one member immediately coming up to me to explain the menu and tell me about the business as soon as I walked in the door.\n\nThe menu here seems to change ever day with the two owners also being the chefs. Each day they choose a different theme (like chinese, southern, indian, etc.) Your options consist of three plates, two of which are meat and one is vegetarian, but you have the option to get any of the items ala carte. There are also pastries from a couple of different bakeries around town.\n\nToday's theme was indian and I tried the Masala Roasted Chicken, the Lamb Curry and the Ginger Cauliflower, all ala carte. Both the chicken and the lamb were both pretty good. The cauliflower was not so great. \n\nAn issue that comes to mind while ordering and eating is that all of the dishes are simply sitting out in bowls and served from there. Perhaps this is because the business is new, but everything would be very much improved if they were kept under warming lights or some other way to keep it all heated up.\n\nOverall, I liked Picnic on Third a lot and I look forward to returning here to try foods from the different themes that the chefs come up with.

I was tempted to get the mango salsa they offered at the end, but everything was a la cart and I'm trying to save for a wedding so I decided to hold back. I just might go crazy one day and pile everything on! \n\nThe place was pretty packed during lunch so it can be hard to find a seat but my coworker and I got lucky and were able to grab the last available table. Someone helps with pouring water and utensils are available at the table. \n\nOverall, good dining experience and I would come back but it would have to be when I allow myself to splurge on lunch every now and then. Btw - although the portions are small, I only ate half my meal and when I had the other half for lunch the next day, it was even more delicious! Haha...", "author": "Jennifer T."}

Picnic on Third is one of the noteworthy. It's a concept that is so obviously great that you wonder why it didn't happen sooner. It is a literal picnic on 3rd Street. The seating is counter, communal, or tables for two and the menu changes daily with three inspired \"Chef Compositions\" which is a selection of an entree, (options are usually a choice of beef, chicken, seafood, or vegetarian) with choices of sides. There's also the option to order a la carte to mix and match.\n\nThe menu follows a different theme each day. I came in on a day the menu was South Korea inspired. Since I usually opt for the veggie I got the Gochujang Roasted Tofu, which came with vermicelli noodles with green onion and bean sprouts, daikon with water spinach, cucumber and carrot salad, and house made kim chi. I've looked at the menus since and saw a Spanish inspired menu as well as a menu inspired by \"German Immigrants in 19th century New York.\" Oh the the brilliance of gourmet cuisine in a quick service setting. The possibilities are endless.", "author": "Clare B."}

Also means that you can keep going back without having to sacrifice food variety!\n\nThey have both takeout and seating options. Friendly laid back vibe and cool decor. I hear they made the tables themselves out of butcher blocks & pipes (neat!)\n\nAnd the coffee - oh the coffee! - possibly the best latte I've ever had.

The meal was Israeli/Mediterranean themed (I believe they change every day) and I love love loved my Israeli couscous (little pearls of goodness in your mouth!). The kale sale was also really good and I usually do not opt for kale or salad! One thing that was a bit weird was their \"baba ganoush\". Normally, baba ganoush is a creamy eggplant dip (similar to the consistency of hummus). Theirs, on the other hand, was more like softly boiled eggplant.

The food is varied as the menu changes everyday so all cuisines seem to be equally represented. The flavors are also very unique and interesting - MUCH better than Whole Foods.\n\nThe thing that I like the most about Picnic is that you can order (veggie) sides for $3. So, whether you are very hungry or just a little hungry you can get the appropriate amount of food. I've found their sides to be decently large so two sides for a total of $6 is a good deal in my book. This is actually one place where it pays to be vegetarian/vegan.

I have come here numerous times with various coworkers and taste many valiant attempts at fancy recipes yielding very whatever tasting results. Forgetting to blanch the greens, not tenderizing the meat, not using enough spices...  These are all mistakes I expect to taste at home, not in a restaurant that changes well over $17 for lunch and a drink.  To top it off, the food was served room cold.  It reminds me perfectly of coming home late and half-microwaving leftovers for dinner, very homey.\n\nThree coworkers and I came here for lunch, and not a single person cleared their main entree.

First of all, \"Picnic on Third,\" what a sweet and whimsical name, especially with South Park so close. \n\nWith a plethora of lunch options catering to the tech crowd, I have to say the food scene in that area of 3rd Street is really difficult- there's Darwin, HRD, and Garaje all within walking distance! Picnic on Third's concept is fun, hipster, and very trendy. Their menus rotate every day and is always inspired by a global cuisine, which is really fun to just read about on their website You can pick any of their combinations - there's always at least one vegetarian option, or choose an entree and sides a la carte.\n\nThe cost is one of the bigger issues. While you can get a whole plate full of food, it will run you a good $14, which isn't really a good value for just lunch. Secondly, I think the food is really hit and miss depending on which cuisine/day you choose. I came to try Filipino food with adobo and I found it mostly bland. I got a lot of rice, which made me fairly full, but I didn't think it warranted a $14 price tag. \n\nIt's really a pity because the space is fun, bright, and communal feeling, with lots of tables picnic-style.

So the line is due to the menu of fresh ingredients which changes daily. The day I was there, all items were Mexican inspired, with a chicken, pork, and vegetarian choice. The line moves quickly because the food choices are limited to three plated dishes each day. You can deviate from the set choices, or you can add a la carte items. They will also box your choice nicely if you are one of those local high-tech workers who barely has enough time to grab lunch. They only take credit/debit cards, so they have swiping down. Within a few minutes of getting in line, you're sure to have your food.\n\nThe portion size was good for lunch. Since the menu changes daily, critiquing the individual items doesn't seem productive.

Since we got there near the end of lunch, a few of us went back after lunch for desserts. They don't make the pastries there, but have a high-quality local baker who supplies them daily - all were yummy. We also had well-made coffee.\n\nThere seem to be a number of places popping up in this neighborhood, but Picnic on Third has a great model. Somewhere in-between cafeteria service and high-quality sit down food. Seems to me to be a great recipe for success.", "author": "MaryFran L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-22", "description": "I dropped into Picnic on Third for the first time today while visiting my mother in the city. I've been dying to try it out since I first heard about it, but never had a chance to make my way up to the city until now. I was not the least bit disappointed or unsatisfied. I came in hungry and left full. An old friend and classmate I went to school with just opened Picnic on Third with a friend of hers, but let it be known that I don't let this bias influence my opinion. Anyone who knows me knows I'm highly opinionated and I don't mince my words.\n\nI'm not a self-described \"foodie\" by most people's definition, although I like to think I am, so I'll jump straight to the point.\n\nThe menu changes daily and is centered around a theme, with a few different compositions available to satisfy the vegetable, meat, and seafood lovers. And we're not talking generic crap like a plate of spaghetti and marinara sauce or a bowl of chicken pho that you can get at any corner joint. It's true homestyle food that I'm sure would win over any gourmand. It's like the stuff your mother made for you at home, but with pizzazz, originality, and restaurant quality.\n\nThe staff is super friendly and always willing to help. The dining area and kitchen are super clean and spotless, even with how busy it can be during lunch. The environment is unique; somewhere between old American and 19th-century European ambiance, with neutral colors tastefully done and old-fashioned long-filament lights on the walls. I dig it. \n\nOnly credit / debit cards are accepted. While I'm sure this may inconvenience some people, it's the opposite for me. I almost never carry cash, and San Francisco is riddled with restaurants that would rather shut down and file for chapter 7 than take your credit card, so this is a nice change.\n\nI've been a type 1 diabetic since I was 19, so I drink tons of water. One of my biggest complaints with some restaurants is they don't refill my water very much or at all (though, to be fair, I'm like a camel for the aforementioned reason, so I'm usually lenient about this). But here, several carafes of fresh water sit on a table with a box of cups and a bowl of lemon slices so you can serve yourself as much as you want. A-okay with me!\n\nBut perhaps my biggest rave about Picnic on Third was its ability to take three foods I normally cannot stand - cornbread, chard, and carrots - and turn them into something delicious and enjoyable enough for me to return for seconds (provided I have enough of an appetite). I'll definitely return soon with friends. Places like this make me wish I lived much closer to San Francisco. It's a very refreshing change from all the Vietnamese, Mexican, Chinese, and sandwich restaurants that seemingly make up 90% of the Bay Area's dining establishments. But most importantly, it's original and delicious.", "author": "Niels M."}

We ordered the two egg hash (4/5) and the scramble (3/5) with ingredients that change. Today's special ingredients were avocado, salmon, and asparagus. I wasn't that impressed with the scramble since it was basically scrambled eggs topped with a couple pieces of salmon and some asparagus. I wish it had come with toast or something to make the meal a little more substantial. Positive was that the salmon was fresh and did not taste fishy at all. The two egg hash was a lot better. Loved the shredded roasted Brussel sprouts and aoili that came on the potatoes. Also got the fruit bowl and their iced Vietnamese coffee special with a grand total of $40. The Vietnamese iced coffee didn't have the depth of authentic iced coffee and tasted more creamy like blended coffee ice cream. Good, but just not what I was expecting.

No, I'm not in the business of having $13 lunches everyday but one could just order a side or two, or a main ($7), and be comfortably sated, or augment it with home-brought stuff.

No amount of descriptions & sneak previews could have prepared my senses for what lay in store today. As I walked in, my sight was captivated by the upscale yet welcoming design & decorum of the space. Before I could consciously appreciate the ambiance, my sense of smell was uplifted by the plethora of aromae which only furthered my hunger. This led to the best part, as I chose my side dishes of farro verde and roasted winter squash and my main dish of crispy confit duck leg with fig compote. With \"just a damn cup of coffee\" to wash it all down, I sat at one of the homemade tables to enjoy one of the best meals I've had in quite some time. The food was gourmet in quality, taste, preparation, & presentation, lacking just the small portions & inflated prices one expects to accompany such fine fare (my whole lunch was under $15). The staff was friendly & helpful, explaining the nuisances of their cuisine and providing prompt & efficient service when needed. But in the end, the best part was by far the food. Once I began to dine, I lost all awareness except for the plate in front of me. The meal was nutritionally well-balanced and downright tasty to say the least.
