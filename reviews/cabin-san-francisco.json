I've brought my dog here several times, weekday nights, weekends, even late night on weekends, and it has never been an issue. The bartenders always seem happy to see dogs come in and even have treats to give them. \n\nThe dog thing is pretty awesome, but that's not the only cool thing about this place. The drinks are great, the ambiance is comfortable and welcoming, and the people are always friendly. Wednesday game night is always really fun too!

We got here just as the first quarter of Game 2 of the NBA Finals began, but there were still a few seats at the bar open. We immediately sat and was greeted by one of the bartenders. They've got about 6-8 beers on tap (don't really remember the exact number), wine, and JERKY! I'm 100% sure there are other drinks and some food, but those are the only ones that I ordered/saw myself (without looking at the menu).\n\nThere are AMPLE TVs along both walls. The Cabin itself is more like a very long hallway. But there is still room for a line of people to stand in front of the bar with the people sitting there as well. It wasn't too loud like other places I've been too, but still had high energy (I mean, everyone is cheering for the warriors so).\n\nAll in all, if I need to go to a bar that isn't going to be too crowded for a sports game...this is the place!", "author": "Kerynne T."}

We came for drinks, bites, and to watch the Warriors play the Cavs. The place itself isn't that large so I wouldn't recommend coming with a big group unless most of you are fine with standing. They were offering 3 food options from a place around the corner called 1760. \n\n$11 Crispy chicken tenders - WHAT. The price is just wow. $11 for 4 small chicken nugget sized pieces of meat. Overpriced, but I'll have to mention that they tasted good with the green sauce that came with them. We were also absolutely starving and needed sustenance. Ordered out of desperation.\n\n$11 Duck slider - Offered on the menu, but we decided against it. \n\n $8 Pre-packaged Righteous Beef Jerky -  Multiple flavor options, but again overpriced for what you get. We got the Sweet BBQ version and it was really dry and tough. Would not recommend.\n\nCocktails for ~ $11 each. \n\nPros:\n- TVs by the bar to watch games \n- Great alcohol selection (Lagavulin, Laphroaig and more)\n- Draft beer selections are solid\n- Dollar shot with purchase of draft beer on dollar days\n\nTips/notes: \n- Not good for groups of more than 2-4\n- Bar area gets crowded easily \n- If you get bar seats and it's crowded (like on game days), be prepared for people to be all up in your personal space\n- Not good for dates if it's crowded, people will be poking in between you to order drinks \n- Pretty noisy, be prepared to talk loudly or get close and comfortable in the hopes of having a conversation \n- We found out that outside food is allowed. This would've been good to know before ordering the overpriced food. We ended up getting pizza from around the corner :D\n\nOverall an A-okay place, but I'd only return on a calm day when the place isn't packed.", "author": "Saachi G."}

Our fearless leader who plans said outings worked with the staff to show our games with sound and even offer drink specials from time to time. I had always tipped my hat for accommodating large groups (sometimes 40+ people) who are rowdy watching their team ultimately suck. \n\nAs of late I have grown a whole new appreciate for Cabin outside of football season.\n\nD\u00e9cor: vie been about 20x and just realized IT LOOKS LIKE A LOG CABIN INSIDE. Maybe I was just so focused on my games, but I just saw this. It has a warm, home-y touch to it with scenic paintings and fireplace on the TV. Aside from the themey d\u00e9cor, there are about 12 televisions playing everything from sports to family guy. Ask nicely and you can easily have your own screen to watch your team, or golf.... Or hell, the bachelor if that's your thing. Nobody is judging.\n\nDrinks:\nDare I say, best bloody Mary in San Francisco. Bold statement, I know, but I've tried most (if not all) \"best bloody\" in SF and theirs is up there. Perfectly spicy, enough vodka to get you feeling up to par and beautifully garnished. After one, you're ready to conquer the world..... or at very least, be a contributor to society.\nAmazing rotating craft beers on tap, a large and well thought out cocktail menu, a $25 fernet flight (if you're feeling frisky) and one of the largest bourbon/scotch selections in SF (along with barrel aged house cocktails).\n\nFood:\nNo frills light bar bites. Gourmet jerky, nuts, etc. I've been told you can bring outside food or have food delivered, but don't quote me on it. With the abundance of food around Polk, you can't go wrong.\n\nService:\nGame changing. Rebecca and Jen are the nicest and most welcoming bartenders on Polk street, hands down. Everyone is welcomed, engaged and served timely. If you have questions, they answer without the tude of other bars and are super easy to talk to. Every time I come in, Rebecca remembers me, my drink and my story. I don't feel like I'm in a random bar on Polk, I feel like I'm talking amongst friends. Advice to management: these girls deserve a raise and are absolutely an asset. \n\nA friend said it best, \"it feels like a non-Polk street Polk street bar\" and for all the above stated reasons, my loyalty and patronage is with ya!\n\nTips:\n-Effective March 1 there is a new cocktail menu\n-FANTASTIC reverse happy hour (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabin-san-francisco?select=_hGA6OHv30iG0qA7GfMTMQ)\n-great, huge window in the front great for people watching and nice, sunny days.", "author": "Ryan L."}

From what I've heard, I wasn't missing out on a lot - another dive bar on a part of Polk Street that is out-growing dive bars.  Well, out went Parilla next door, in came 1760 (que Swank!).  Out went the Red Devil, in came Harper and Rye.  Out went Bigfoot, and in came The Cabin.  (Still waiting to see what replaces Big Apple Foods)  So, gentrification is a fact of life in SF, and Polk Gulch is upgrading too.  Not that this was a marginal neighborhood before, but now it is getting even classier.  The Cabin is a good compromise in terms of the changes.  \n\nI like a friendly dive bar.  Generally, this is because I want to relax and not feel like I'm on display.  I like bartenders who converse - I like fellow patrons who are interesting to shoot the breeze with.  But, I'm getting older, and I do enjoy being in a place where I don't get spare-changed in the bar, or find myself next to a person who is way over the line.  I like my Upper-Polk (PolkNob?) standard of Street/Bar behavior.\n\nThe Cabin is definitely not a dive bar, but it's not a super high-end cocktail lounge either.  This falls into the category of a nice bar which is nice-casual.  If you're in during the afternoon or weekends, it's pretty relaxed.  Lots of TV's, so it's not a bad place to watch the games.  I hear Sundays get busy for 49ers.  The after-work vibe is pretty much on par for the neighborhood - it's the folks who live on Upper-Polk, West Nob Hill, Russian Hill - generally a late-20's'/30's age range.  It's people who want to relax and have drinks and a conversation.  You can feel fine in a suit, or shorts and a t-shirt.  I'm almost always in work clothes.  BTW - I dig the log-cabin feel (which I think is a remnant from the Bigfoot days)\n\nBrass-Tacks:  They have a nice cocktail list.  Very nice full bar (it is actually a lovely presentation) and a good range of beer, wine, spirits.  Prices are about as expected, and there is a Happy Hour.  I've thought the bartenders are all pretty solid and have been good to chat with.  Overall, nothing missing, but nothing truly exceptional or cant-miss.  It's not as high-end as a Redford or Harper and Rye, but it's also not super casual.  It's relaxing and a good after-work spot, with lots of TV's.", "author": "Adam S."}

I've been coming here since the place was \"Bigfoot\" (a much more unique San Francisco bar that of course no longer exists because god forbid there's a place that seems to contain a soul in SF anymore), the bartenders were nice enough, but definitely stiffed us on our drinks. Our two drinks cost $30 including tip.I saw the vodka gimlet on the menu and asked for gin instead, I was asked a preference and just picked a gin from the bar, but wasn't told until the bill came that my choice would hike my drink from $11 to $14! You should absolutely let a customer know that sort of thing instead of assuming it's alright. To add insult to injury the drink itself was mediocre at best.\n\n  My boyfriend ordered a Knob Creek neat, they gave him less then a shots worth and it was $12.50! Give me a break!

Last call we went for the tangy and feisty Cabin Quencher ($9) and the Yellow Tricycle ($11), which was the only drink of the evening I wasn't fond of, but that's probably just because I don't like Prosecco. \n\nDrinks were made quickly, bartenders were friendly ( shout out to the bartender who kept calling me baby girl- hayyyy), and the music was loud, but hey, it's the weekend, live a little.

I don't usually go out of my way to write reviews for bad service but this was something else. ( I'm also a bartender so this just annoyed me even more) as we walked in I noticed there was a tall guy working along side a girl. We sat down waiting patiently for a drink and after a few minutes of the bartenders still chatting and not leaving conversations finally came over and acted annoyed that he had to even get our order. The guy had a very monotone voice on purpose and made sarcastic comments about how he had to pour us drinks. Still at this point I wasn't angry and was trying to be in high spirits. It came to the point where we had to pay and I put money out there and so did my friend. The bartender took both of our money and stayed at the register for over 10 minutes. I figured maybe It was a money switch or something with their bank they were fixing. Another 5 minutes passed and the guy turned around and started talking to the other bartender and engaged in a conversation with another customer. At this point we start signaling both of them to come over to which I see the guy look in our direction and quickly ignore us and turn away. The girl eventually comes over but acts like nothing happened. The guys continues to ignore us up until we leave and looks away from us anytime we try to make contact. Working at a bar I've seen other bartenders pull this crap on people to scam them and play dumb but really? I would have tipped you decent anyways but not near a $30 tip off a half of pint we each ordered. Especially after  being rude during most of the initial interaction.

If you come during happy hour (anytime before 7pm any day of the week) you'll get $4 drafts, $3 bottles and $5 well drinks. Perfect spots for sports as they have plenty of TVs. If you get there early, get a table in the back. It's my new go to place for World Cup, NFL etc... Older crowd (late 20s early 30s) than other Polk bars.\n\nThey have a 50% off Groupon right now. Make sure to have it on your phone as they dont accept printouts.", "author": "Jeremy B."}

Cabin is a cleaner, slightly more sophisticated upgrade from the old digs, Bigfoot.\n\nThat's where the good news ended though.  My drink, the jalapeno margarita, was straight up heat in a mason jar.  The heat was so overpowering and the drink lacked the hint of sweetness one craves in a margarita. I had the bartender add a little sweet and sour, which didn't improve things.\n\nBf ordered one of the blackberry cocktails which actually tasted like nothing. Didn't know that was possible.\n\nAttentive service and I was all for the low-key vibe, but won't be running back to Cabin.", "author": "Brianna M."}

Great surroundings complete with the most comfortable bar stools for us to sit on while watching Sunday night football. I especially love the whiskey sour here (no egg white foam but equally delicious). They make it with their own personal sour mix that has egg whites in it and you can tell! The drink is a perfect combination of sweet and sour. They also allow you to choose your own whiskey. They top it with a special black cherry (not the usual overly sweet maraschino) that has an amazingly balanced cherry flour.  The bartender was extremely helpful and informative. He spent the time to go over different beers they served and even allowed us to have a taste before deciding. Great cocktail prices! A go to bar on Polk street!", "author": "Caroline T."}

I was there on a Saturday night and it was insanely packed and loud and hot and extremely difficult to get a bartender's attention. That is a lot of \"ands,\" I know, but that's because there were a few too many things that made me not crazy about the joint. Oh, and the drinks were mediocre at best and overpriced. My friend ordered a vodka tonic and it tasted like lightly flavored water. I hate tonic, vehemently, and I couldn't even tell that it had tonic in it because it was so watered down. No bueno, Cabin. No bueno.", "author": "Stephenie S."}

The first thing I noticed when walking in is that the vibe was super chill and the clientele were older and seemed like native San Franciscans. I also noticed the fireplace on a screen in the back - pretty funny. \n\nWe sat at the bar and were immediately welcomed by the friendly woman bartender. She talked to us about her day and we had great conversation. Highly recommend this bar for happy hour (cheap prices) and to get a quick drink before a dinner reservation on Polk St. A full bar with a really extensive selection (3 shelves of hard liquor at the bar).", "author": "Harmony P."}

But it was way too packed and a bit more fancy than I was dressed for. Cabin was much more my pace. Laid back and dare I say, cabin chic? It was a cool cozy atmosphere but most importantly were the welcoming bartenders, Rebecca and Jason.

First off they need business which is why I think they are running a Groupon. Secondly, the workers there are rude and don't seem very happy to work there. Maybe when the  owner finally realizes that customer service is number 1 then maybe they will become a place where i spend my money on an overpriced cocktail.

Later, being the klutz that I am I spilled my red wine all over their tables and floors and I felt so bad and the employees couldn't have been nicer! So sweet about how it always happens ( I doubt with red wine) and insisted on getting me another full glass. I tried to refute saying it was all my fault for not being more careful and the lady was so beyond nice not taking no for an answer. My group was already trying to leave so I feel bad I didn't stay after them pouring me a new drink but I will definitely back! Thank you for proving that there is hospitality in bars!", "author": "Julie P."}
