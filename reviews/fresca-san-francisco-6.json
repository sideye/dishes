Everything looked delightful, so I was pretty not picky when it came to deciding what I wanted. My partner and I ordered the salmon Benedict's, and the steak-something, and it was really good for the most part, but the steak dish was a bit salty, which is probably why it comes with rice but At that time I was cutting back on carbs so I wasn't eating the rice which is probably why it was a bit salty.

Host was attentive, it wasn't too crowded, ambiance was joyful for a good time. We ordered a round of sangria and a couple other drinks to start the night. Sangria was a good deal at $25 for a pitcher/carafe. \n\nWhen the whole party arrived, we began ordering a few food items and drinks. The waiter began taking our order and shortly realized our party was too big for him to memorize all of our orders. He forewarned us that he may forget the order and will try his best (why not just carry a notepad?).  Food came out at a timely manner, but not too surprisingly he brought an extra dish we didn't order. Food was solid though. \n\nAfter our festivities, we had to wait for maybe 30 minutes for the bill despite flagging them down multiple times. We eventually got the wrong bill. When we got our bill, they charged us for the extra item. We eventually just got up to pay since we were tired of paying. \n\nOverall, food and drink were solid and the HH deals were great.

I'm pretty sure I've been here once during happy hour, I might've been way tipsy, I never wrote a review but remember good vibes.\n\nFor our holiday lunch, our group chose Fresca. We loved the food: mouth puckering ceviche, amazing lamb meatballs in a foie gras gravy (get this!) and delicious lomo saltado. Since my boss was with us, I had to stick to a non alcoholic grapefruit spritzer :P\n\nHowever, service was pretty much non-existent. Our waiter would disappear or maybe he was off talking to the chef or playing bartender, but aside from our table, there were only two other tables he was serving. Why wasn't he more visible and available?\n\nThere must've been something wrong in the kitchen too. Our food took too long to come out. It took an hour before everyone got their entrees. Also, our portions for the lomo saltado varied a lot. Someone got more meat than fries, I got more fries than meat, and the most petite girl in the group got a huge mountain of both. (I wouldn't complain if they gave me that plate instead)\n\nI could not, with good conscience, recommend this place for lunch. Happy hour looks interesting with the $1 oyster offer, which pretty much is a winner since they seem to have a monopoly over that in this street. Otherwise, pass.", "author": "Janice C."}

I was wondering where the cucumber, coconut, and cilantro were though. Perhaps they were made into the sauce? On top of each fish was a red pepper, but I love spicy food so I didn't mind. It was just weird that their menu didn't mention it. I think their menu needs a little updating, but this dish was still absolutely delicious.\n\nPlantain chips [$5] - If I didn't get plantain chips, I probably would've left hungry. These chips were perfect with the tuna. Every piece was crispy and crunchy. I highly recommend getting it with your ceviche.\n\nService was great. Our waiter refilled our water every time it was low, even when we were paying for the bill and chatting.

I love pisco.\n\nMy roomie and I went here one bright Sunday morning to scope out some brunch, as one does on Sunday in San Francisco. As delicious as the $15 bottomless mimosas sounded, I was still scarred by a particularly boozy birthday karaoke event the previous Friday, so that'll have to wait for next time. Knowing nothing about it other than the menu description, I ordered the ceviche and a bottomful mimosa.\n\nAfter an unremarkable wait, the food came out. As a first time experience, I loved the ceviche. The sauce was delicious, the fish was firm and flavorful, and the veggies complimented the ensemble well. There were some sort of nuts on the side, though, that I really wasn't into. The crunchiness didn't gel with the texture of the rest of the dish, but I've heard they're common with ceviche, so I guess it is what it is.\n\nIt was a little expensive though, it ended up being about $25 after tax and tip for each of us. It was good, but I'm not sure it was *that* good. Ah well, I'll probably be back soon for the bottomless mimosas.", "author": "Shawn W."}

I finally took the opportunity to stop by and I learned that sometimes you really can judge a book by its cover.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n1/2 Stars for Taste --\nEverything was good, nothing was great. We ordered the paella, mussels, and calamari to share family style. My favorite thing of the night was the sauce that the mussels came in. I ended up dipping everything in it, and I'm not ashamed to admit, maybe even just straight up drinking it. Honestly, the paella and calamari were nothing to write home about, I think they use the same seafood mix (salmon, calamari, scallops) in both and just add mussels/shrimp to the paella. My one major gripe was the mussels themselves. There were a few hidden in the bunch that tasted like the bathroom smells, making me seriously question their freshness. (I eat a lot of seafood, so anyone tryna tell me that that is how mussels are supposed to taste can shove it.) I was on a date, so instead of spitting them out, I said a prayer and decided to take a chance with my iron stomach of an immigrant. A major bummer because the sauce was so good, I would come back for it without the mussels and just ask for baskets of bread.\n\n0/1 Stars for Value --\nCrazy overpriced for what it is. The paella was chock full of seafood (salmon, mussels, shrimp, calamari, scallops), but came in a small portion, definitely not worth $30. Splitting one dish and two small plates with no alcohol came out to about $40 per person including tax and tip. I would pay that for a quality seafood meal, but Fresca did not deliver. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nI think there was one waiter and one busboy for the entire restaurant so they were understandably very busy. The wait for food was longer than average and it was hard to find somebody to flag down. \n\nI'm going to give a pity half a bonus star because I would come back and give the happy hour a chance. I really wanted to like this place and I wanted to come back and try the ceviche, but my experience with the mussels really has me leaning toward taking my money somewhere else. \n\nTL;DR -- Overpriced for the quality and portions. Order the mussels for the sauce, but the mussels themselves are like the Russian Roulette of gastroenteritis.", "author": "Abby W."}

It's pretty standard to find both options at restaurants in Peru, so it was nice to see them both on the menu here too. And they were both very good; I'd say an 8 out of 10!\n\nTo eat we shared the ceviche chifa (tuna, avocado, plantain chips) and the anticuchos con pollo (chicken skewers).The ceviche could easily rival some of those in Peru - very fresh tuna and the most delicious, savory ponzu sauce at the bottom. In fact, it was so good we had to dip the crispy yuca and chicken skewers in there too. \n\nService and ambiance was fine. I can't tell if they're trying to be more of an intimate date-spot or just a casual, neighborhood spot; I saw an even mix of couples/dates and friend groups. *shrug*\n\nIn any case, if delicious Peruvian food is what you're after, Fresca won't let you down!", "author": "Jeannette N."}

I love to come for bottomless Mimosas and Brunch and you get 2 hours to drink so let me tell you that a lot of beverage can be consumed within that time, especially since they fill you back up when they see your glass has some missing! The shredded pork eggs benedict is the freakin bomb. It is cooked to perfection and there are so many flavors jam packed into it that I can't help but smile with each bite. This isn't my favorite thing here though. My absolute favorite are the sweet potato pancakes. These things are AMAZING! They are topped with sweet plantains and a whipped cream topping. They are the right amount of sweetness and if you are looking to transcend into a higher sense of being then I suggest you eat these. Like right now. They also have good music playing, and for me it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside since it feels like a piece of my culture is coming out of the speakers.

I had a friend recommend the Lomo Saltado but because I don't eat beef, I had them replace it with chicken. $23 for dry and overly salted chicken?? No thank you... luckily their cocktails were decent but still very disappointed. I also ordered the lamb meatballs based on fellow Yelpers' reviews and was not disappointed - YAY! The empanada sampler was a little pricey, but I'm glad we got them. I usually write longer reviews but I really have nothing else to say... overpriced Peruvian food that didn't seem too authentic. I'm sure they can upcharge more due to its close proximity to UCSF and students so they get quite good business regardless of their quality of food.\n\nAlso, there was a really loud and obnoxious large party sitting opposite me and my date.

Inside, there's ample of tables to accommodate any size group from a couple to a good dozen friends.  The ambiance around the bar/entrance area feels a bit hectic and loud when it's packed, but the calmer seating area adjacent to it provided an amber-hued, intimate setting just right for conversation and connection.  It also boasts gender neutral bathrooms which make it convenient for any patron.\n\nI went here with some friends for a catch up date.  We made a reservation (which I totally recommend for Friday and Saturday nights if you have a party of 8 or more).  Our waiter came over pretty quickly and took our drink order.  There certainly were a lot of Pisco cocktails, but as I wasn't in the mood for alcohol, I went for the purple corn cider (Chicha Morada).  As some of our party was still on their way, we ordered some appetizers to keep our hunger at bay while we waited.  We put in a few orders of chicharron de pollo.  Our waiter sort of disappeared after delivering our drinks and appetizers, which was okay until our last two friends arrived and they wanted to put in an order for drinks.  When we did find him, we selected our mains.  My favorite at any Peruvian restaurant is the Lomo Saltado, so I had to totally sample their version.\n\nThe mains took some time to come and getting water in the meantime was pretty impossible.  The bar area was full but the main dining area wasn't only half filled.  Our waiter seemed to disappear again and only returned with our main dishes without the water.  We reminded him again before we dove our forks into our food.  My dish was delish and fresh.  The only thing it missed where crispier fries.  They were beyond limp, but luckily the meat and the sauce along with the peppers and onions were absolutely scrumptious.  My one friend swore by the rainbow trout while another has the braised pork shoulder.\n\nI guess the great thing about having a waiter disappear is that the dinner didn't feel rushed.  We were able to enjoy the food over laughter and funny stories.  We did eventually get our water and the check, thought that took some sleuthing.

Ice only available when wait staff came around with water.  \n\nHusband and I ordered \n1) Tuna Ceviche $17 with side of fried plantain chips $5 = $22.

Taste wise this was my favorite dish with layers of texture and flavor.  \n4) Albondigas - lamb meatballs $14.  Five small lamb meatballs slathered with cream sauce and sprinkle with peas.

We came here during breakfast/brunch, so we didn't get much of the authentic Peruvian food, however we did try some very tasty things. I ordered the Salmon Gravlox Benedict, which was extremely delicious. The poached eggs were prepared to perfection and there was a very generous amount of salmon on top of the breakfast muffin. In addition, I really liked that the dish was not covered in hollandaise sauce, but had just the perfect amount on the eggs. My friend ordered that Huevos En Cazuela and this was quite an amazing dish as well. This dish was full of saut\u00e9ed shrimp, spinach, mushrooms, egg, jack cheese, and \"chupe\" sauce. It came along with a piece of crunchy and flavorful bread on top, which was perfect for dipping into this flavorful dish. This dish was slightly on the spicier side, but not overly spicy. We also decided to get the tequeno appetizer (similar to little deep fried wontons), which I highly recommend!! This appetizer was so crunchy and full of the best crab/shrimp/cream cheese flavor. It came together with a sweet honey dipping sauce, which made it that much more better! \n\nIn addition, I really enjoyed the Saturday atmosphere of this place. The weather was very nice during the day and the restaurant had their windows wide open, which gave it the feel like we were sitting outside. \nI definitely want to come back to try more of the appetizers and authentic Peruvian main courses, which seem to look amazing! \n\nAlthough the food was impressive, the service, not so much. Right as we walked in, there was nobody at the front of the restaurant who was helping guests to their tables. Instead there was a gentleman in the back who was counting money and not even looking up, until we moved closer to the center of the restaurant. I somewhat didn't like having to get the hosts attention because I feel like this should've been his responsibility and I didn't feel like it was professional to be counting money while the restaurant had many other guests seated. \n\nI'll definitely be willing to give this place another chance because the food was very good.", "author": "Julia K."}

The pricing is good, as it is considerably higher for their dinner menu.  The first couple of times I've ordered this Peruvian favorite, it was stellar to say the least. But I've definitely noticed a dip in quality of their beef the last 2 times I ordered here.  The beef did not taste fresh, and was extremely \"beefy\".  I don't know if the beef was old, expired, or just bad quality, but based off of those 2 unedible experiences, I've decided to stop ordering this dish here.

Saw Fresca on Eat24 and decided to order delivery for lunch. I placed my order around 1:15pm and it arrived a little before 2:30pm. I had requested napkins and utensils, but unfortunately none were provided.\n\nCeviche sampler: tasting of six ceviches ($38)\n*Ceviche chifa: blue fin tuna, ponzu, onion, sesame, pickled daikon, avocado, peanuts\n*Ceviche alianza lima: shrimp, scallop, seasonal fish, calamari, coconut, onion, cilantro\n*Ceviche barranco: seasonal fish, aji amarillo, cilantro, onion, green papaya, basil, quinoa\n*Ceviche sangriento: seasonal fish, pisco \"bloody mary\" leche de tigre, red onion, cilantro, avocado\n*Tiradito nikkei: blue fin tuna sashimi ceviche, ponzu, scallion, chalaca salsa, truffle oil\n*Tiradito pucusana: salmon sashimi ceviche, passion fruit tigers milk, cilantro, purple corn, onion, aji amarillo\n\nI love ceviche. What better way to satisfy my ceviche craving than by ordering the sampler?! This is actually a lot of ceviche, so I understand the $38 price tag. My favorite was the tiradito nikkei. I couldn't taste the truffle much, but I enjoyed the fish and the flavors. In general, I enjoyed the tiraditos. Out of the 4 ceviches, I enjoyed the chifa the most. It had the best flavor without an overbearing acidity. The alianza lima was very mellow in flavor. I liked the assortment of seafood. The other ceviches were my least fav. Not much difference in terms of flavor. I know some ceviches were supposed to have avocado, but that seemed to be missing in my sampler. Maybe they were having an avocado shortage?\n\n*Paella: saffron rice, chicken, chorizo, clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops and fish with green peas, pimento sofrito ($29)\n\nThe paella was chock full of seafood and the rice was very flavorful. I kept eating this even though I was getting full. Very comforting.\n\nI really wanted to try the Pollo al abrasa: Mary's farm free range rotisserie chicken, french fries, green salad, cilantro dressing, but unfortunately, they were out, so no chicken for me! It was probably better as I couldn't finish the ceviches and paella over the course of two meals. There were still leftovers!\n\nI've been going back and forth between giving Fresca 3 or 4 stars as I enjoyed their paella, but most of the ceviche was underwhelming. Decided they deserved 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4. I'd love to try their chicken one day. Maybe I'll use that as an excuse to visit one of the other locations.", "author": "Elena N."}

Then came the entrees. \n\nThe seafood paella was well-seasoned and had plentiful clams, shrimp, and calamari. I'd say this is a must-have at Fresca. \n\nUnfortunately, the duck (arroz con pato) was too acidic for us. Hence, one less star. The sauce overwhelmed the dish and ruined the natural flavors of the duck and cilantro rice. \n\nThe adobo de chancho (slow braised pork shoulder) was tender and flavorful. The roasted yams paired with the canario beans filled us up. I'd recommend this dish as well.", "author": "Joanne K."}

The wait won't be crazy (not compared to an hour and a half, which many insane people will think is reasonable for places like Zazie, Mission Beach Cafe, and Kitchen Story) but the food won't be out-of-this-world stellar, either. You know what there will be? Ample seating and bottomless mimosas. So, again, depends on what your goals are.\n\nThe last time I came here, I was with a friend and we were pre-gaming a free Kelly Clarkson concert in Golden Gate Park (I know, I know..). While my interest in the event was of a more ironic ilk it turns out the people we met up with at the park were avid friends so I peed in a bush and left..but I digress.\n\nMimosas.\n\nTo receive bottomless mimosas from here, you need $14 and the capacity to drink at least two, to make the price worth it (they're $8 for a single glass). You are given a time limit of 2 hours (challenge accepted).\n\nBefore moseying to see Kelly C, my friend and I drank a ton of mimosas and did so on basically an empty stomach, only splitting an order of the Peruvian donuts. Don't be like us. Eat something more substantial when consuming copious amount of orange juice and champagne.\n\nToday I was integrated in a party of 5 and we did well. My boyfriend and I split an order of the mussels (under small plates) as well as the chicken hash (under \"Brunch\" on the menu). They were both okay, nothing really to write home about, but the chicken hash far superseded the mussels. The mussels were in a sauce that lacked substantial flavor and only came wth one piece of grilled bread to dip, which seemed unnecessarily scarce.\n\nThe chicken was also just okay, the size of the poached egg it came with was underwhelming and again, could've been seasoned better.\n\nWe started arriving at 11:00, were a complete party by 11:20 or so, and had no trouble being seated, probably didn't even need the reservation I had made the night before. The place had filled up substantially by the time we paid our check, closer to 1pm. \n\nService was awesome and attentive, our server was very personable and he checked in on us at all the right intervals.\n\nI behaved myself and had 2.5 mimosas.\n\nThey're my second favorite thing to have bottomless~*~", "author": "Megan D."}

This was our second time around and second time with bad service. The restaurant was probably only 2/3 full when we sat down and our negative experience started shortly thereafter.\n\nThe waitress got our drinks and a couple of appetizers. We said we needed a few more minutes to order a couple more appetizers. 20 minutes later, she hasn't come back and our drinks are nowhere to be seen. I see our drinks sitting ready at the bar idle for 10 more minutes and not one appetizer has come out yet. We ordered two of the mussel appetizers and only one came, we had to point that out TWICE before they brought the second one. Then out of the blue, they bring out a third a charged us for it.\n\nWe order our entrees and a bottle of wine. We get our entrees in an acceptable amount of time, 10-15 minutes but no wine bottle which I would expect 2-3 minutes after I order it. When we get our entrees I point out that we have not received our wine. 10 minutes later, no wine and I grab a manager who says \"right away\", 10 minutes later, nothing. At this point nearly everyone is done with their entrees and I flag another manager about the wine and they finally bring it when we basically are on our last bite of our entrees. So at this point I've asked the waitress about the wine and two different managers. It took nearly 30 minutes to get the damn bottle. What I found super odd is that there were two managers and two waitresses working, seems like an odd ratio. Should definitely have one more waitress and one less manager on duty.\n\nThe food is really good. But I will likely not go back just for the really bad service.", "author": "Nic B."}

Here, they don't even give the standard, 15%, as an option.  Instead, the three suggestions start at 18% and go up.  This is bs.  When I was a kid, the standard tip was 10%.  Then the service industry successfully began this subtle campaign to raise the bar to 15%, which is where it has stood until 5-6 years ago, when, again, the industry has slowly started trying to almost subconsciously raise the bar again.  Don't get me wrong; I'm a full on union guy, SEIU supporter, hate corporations, and hate Donald Trump.  But I also don't have unlimited resources.  The tip is based on a percentage of the bill, and the price of restaurant food constantly goes up, meaning the tip itself, which is based on a percentage of the bill, goes up correspondingly.  There is no justification for the percentage itself to also go up (notably, in SF, as of maybe 5 years ago, they now get the SF Healthy, a valuable new perk). My salary doesn't go up like that, so eating out in restaurants either becomes cost prohibitive for me, or else I have to feel like a cheap bastard when I leave the waiter maybe 18% (which is around where I tipped when the minimum was 15%), which they are trying to make on the low end of the scale.  And to add insult to injury, Fresca calculated the various percentages not just on the food and drink, but on the tax and the SF Healthy charge as well!  If you're going to lay out suggested tips, do it on food and drink alone.  THAT is the standard.  Eff this place.", "author": "Chuck P."}

However, this location appears to be new and is amongst the plethora of restaurants on Irving Street.  We chose this primarily because the ambiance looked nice from the outside. \n\nOur waiter was kind enough to tell us his favorites for every section of their menu even though we ended up going zero of his selections. I did appreciate the effort so one star for that. It's a Peruvian place and therefore ceviche was a requirement. There's multiple choices but we ended up with the ceviche puerto which had a nice mixture of seafood in there. I still have to figure out how they get such darn huge kernels. Also had was the skewer sampler. I liked all the options except for the fish skewer. It wasn't bad but fish just doesn't belong on a skewer to me. Beef heart skewer was bomb.com though. At this point, I was stuffed but gutted it out since the roasted chicken we ordered came out. It tasted like half a roasted chicken and I'm not sure I would place it way above the full roasted chicken I purchase during Costco runs. Nonetheless, the yucca fries we were able to substitute in place of the regular ones was delicious. I highly recommend doing this for all your plates and forget the baby greens. Your body will thank you but your mirror won't. \n\nTwo more stars for the food and I'll add another star simply because the restaurant stayed open way past their closing them to allow us to finish our meal.

A year can bring many changes in the business and neighborhood, and we were hoping Fresca stayed to it touches after our last dining experience.\n\nD\u00e9cor Setting - Modern/Contemporary surrounding and the lighting can bring a little intimate due to the dimness.  The glass windows facing the street brings in fresh sunlight during the day and toward early evening, as seating can be arrange to accommodate small to large parties.\n\nTherefore, it is time to Chow Down!\n\nDrinks -\nWe started with a little taste of something different and selected Bruce Cost Passion Ginger Unfiltered in a bottle.  This was mild, not too sweet, and truly unfiltered per the label.  A refreshing drink if you want to stay away from soda.\n\nThen we got an Amigo en Oaxaca and if not mistaken, it had egg white mixed into the drink.  Thought this was interesting and it sure is pretty interesting drink.  The lemon slice gives it a hint of acidity while the alcohol really took over the taste with each slip.  \n\nStarter - Tiradito Nikkei, Ahi tuna, ponzu, scallion, chalaca salsa, truffle oil.\nThis arrived with a (4) slice of Ahi tuna bath in ponzu sauce and drips of truffle oil, topped with diced scallion, small amount of chalaca salsa, and green onion.  This is tasty, but for $14 dollar on (4) slice, I think we could have passed as we were hoping there were more than (4) slices and thinly sliced.  \n \nSecond arrival - Chicharron De Pollo, crispy fried chicken, aji amarillo, salsa criolla, five spice mayo.\nThe next arrival is very similar to the Japanese Chicken Karaage.  The fired chicken is moist and not dry, while the five spice mayo gave it a little kick.  Nice fun bite but not for the price of an appetizer as it can get pricey if you have a large party.     \n \nThird arrival - Causa Chiclayan, fried halibut, avocado, olives, cherry tomato, quail egg, butter lettuce.\nWe could have passed on this as this is a miss.  The fried halibut wasn't dry and wasn't something to remember after eating.  We were hoping the fried halibut brought in some texture crunch with each bite but it went flat.\n \nForth arrival - Lomo Saltado, saut\u00e9ed steak strips, onion, tomato, cilantro, French fries, soy, white rice.\nThis dish is tasty.  The sliced saut\u00e9ed steak strips had a perfect size for each bite, tender, and favor were all there.  We hoped the fries were more crunchy and fresh and not so soft and soggy.  We understand the sauce can seep into the fries causing this, but had experience fries similar where the fries spoke loudly - crunchy.  \n \nFifth arrival -  Bisteck A Lo Pobre, grilled certified angus new york steak, canario bean tacu tacu, fried egg, plantain, chimichurri.\nTalk about a steak!  Good size and cooked to the way I've requested.  The steak was tender with nice grill marks.  The canario bean work perfectly with the rice with slice grilled onion.  As for the plantain, I wished it was more cooked so the sugar would come out more for caramelizing.  Overall, I didn't think it came out similar to a loco moco Hawaii dish, and at the end, it is a dish I enjoyed.  \n \nFinal thoughts:\nEven though we haven't been to Fresca for the longest time, it did bring out some good food and some dishes we could have passed.

There a few things that went terribly wrong with our romantic dinner that I just can't let go. \n\nFirst thing, I worked that night until 9:30 and we booked our reservation for 10pm. When my husband made the reservation they said it was totally fine and reassured him they would be open late enough for us to enjoy the meal. The reservationists failed to mention it was a prix fixe menu at that time. \n\nWhen we arrived at 10, we were seated and our waiter came  over about 10 minutes later. We ordered a bottle of wine and first course. When he came back with the wine he informed me that unfortunately they were out of the scallop appetizer. One of three choices. So I went with tuna since I love seafood even though I chose tuna for my main course. We ordered main course at that time, I got Tuna, my husband the steak. When appetizers arrived, the waiter informed me that unfortunately they are out of the Tuna. Wait, what?? Only after we've eaten the appetizer I didn't even want have you told me you don't have a fish entree. So I chose the vegetarian paella since I don't eat chicken or steak... The vegetarian paella comes out and it was disgusting I had to send it back. I mean who puts vegetarian paella on the menu anyways, it tasted like bland frozen vegetables and packaged rice. So at this point I haven't even eaten a main course. \n\nTime for dessert... We ordered one of each. After we order, the waiter says to us he is out of one and so we both had bread pudding. It was awful, truly terrible. I couldn't even eat it and I was so hungry at this point from only eating the appetizer. \n\nThe waiter brings the bill and he hasn't even taken off a single thing from the bill. He charged me full price for even the entree I hadn't eaten and the disgusting dessert we hadn't touched. The $60 prix fix was a joke. He told me he tried to ask the manager but she didn't take anything off. I asked to speak to manager at which time she came over after having been at the bar the entire time. She apologized and took off a small portion, we still ended up spending over $80 on a crazy bad experience and terrible food. \n\nI will never go back here due to the way they ruined my first Valentin's day married to my husband. I wish the reservationist would've just told us from the beginning that it would be too late and the kitchen may be sold out, or from the minute we sat down our waiter should've been up front about everything that was not available or from the last interaction the manager would've taken upon herself to make it right.", "author": "Lisa H."}

At 7 pm on a Sunday night (prime dinner time) the whole place started with 3 tables and maybe had half the restaurant filled when we left at 8:30 pm (New place). I have to first say that its a $$$ kind of meal, not $$ as yelp says and we got two entrees and a appetizer. \n\nThe lamb meatballs had a nice crispy texture, the inside was not dry at all, and also without an over whelming gamey taste. The gravy sauce was decent but was slightly on the bland side. \n\nMy Lomo Soltado was a worth it dish with steak strips, fries, rice, and onions in soy sauce. The meat was just right with a decent amount of pieces and my favorite was the tomatoes in the dish to counteract the sauce being on the slightly salty side. \n\nThe boyfriend got pork shoulder with rice and beans and after one bite I really didn't see anything special about it other than the meat being tender.", "author": "Maybo H."}

I wish it had a tad more salt and spices which would have made the dish much more desirable.\n\nFor entrees I got the pork shoulders with rice and beans. It was just typical pinto beans, and again lacking seasoning. The pork itself was well seasoned, but it was far too chewy and hard to tear apart. My girlfriend had the tenderloin beef strips. They were very good and definitely the highlight of the meal. The beef was very well prepared and seasoned, and the accompanying frites were pretty good.\n\nI'm giving this place a 3 stars because I don't think it's worth the cost (at least $30 per person) for the overall quality of the food.

Not bad for a Wed evening. We perused the menu with curiosity, wondering the difference between ceviche and tiraditos. Our waiter provided explanations and offered his recommendations. We ultimately chose ceviche sampler, beef heart skewer, paella, and the steak sirloin entree. We also took the waiter's advice on the plantain chips to accompany the ceviche. \n\nThe ceviche sampler was probably the highlight of the event. We thought that it'd set the tone for the rest of the evening, but it fell far short of our expectations. Great variety, but small portions. \n\nIt's about 745pm now and we searched for our waiter--where's our food?! He returned to the kitchen and brought out our skewers, claiming that it was \"straight out of the kitchen\". Really, did it take 45 min to grill up two baby skewers of beef heart? Really. Anyway, the sauce paired well with the meat, and overall a tasty appetizer. This dish hasn't SKEW-ed our evening yet. See what I did there?\n\nOur entrees finally came through. The steak sirloin had an interesting flavor, but to be honest, it tasted more like an Asian stir-fry with rice and all. Nothing spectacular, meat was a bit too chewy. The paella was more like salt-ella. Every single bite was full of salt. No amount of lime could make it tolerable. Our waters couldn't be refilled frequently enough. To-go box? NO THANKS. We told the waiter that it was extremely salty. No feedback was given. Don't blame him. \n\nThe check summed up to a whopping $120. Not worth it. Based on my keen glances around the room, our orders were misplaced somewhere out of order. Other customers that were seated at the same time, had received their orders before us. I don't think the food should've taken that long to prepare--1+ wait is long.", "author": "Matthew G."}

I've heard the cuisine is much more traditional than what was served at Pasi\u00f3n. \n\nI ordered the Aji de Gallina and Pan con Lomito. I was excited for the latter as Lomo Saltado is my usual favorite Peruvian dish and I have never seen it in sandwich form. \n\nThe Pan con  Lomito met my expectations. The pieces of steak was cooked perfectly at medium rare. There were slices of tomato and red onion. The french roll was also nicely toasted. When you take your first bite, juice from the steak is surely going to drip, making a very juicy bite. The french fries were the same as the ones from Pasi\u00f3n: crisp and delicious. \n\nThe Aji de Gallina was less exciting. It came with olives, half a hard-boiled egg, and 3 slices of potato, along with a side of white rice. The chicken was moist, but lacked flavor. The dish was saved when the waiter brought their cilantro aji-styled sauce. This sauce was well-seasoned and made this dish very scrumptious.

If you're here with friends, co-workers and the like, the lighting might be on the too dim side for you at dinner time, but for an impromptu date night it was perfect.  Our waiter was attentive and always came back around to check on us at the right times.  Plus, our waters were always refilled without us having to ask, eternal big bonus points for that.

The Ceviche stole the show for me, plentiful hunks of tuna that blended perfectly with the sesame, daikon and peanuts (looking back, I wish I could have kept the leftover drippings that accumulated to pour over my paella later - so good!).  The Tequenos are basically happy puffs of cream cheese, so you can't really go wrong there - and the dipping sauce is yummy.  Paella was delish, though I do recommend letting it cool off a bit so the flavors can really sink in before you dive into it.

We waited a few minutes to be seated . After being seated it took them 10 min till anyone said anything to us. They took the order after 15 min. Our food was served after 45 min. \nAt the end we were late and asked take our son's ice cream to go. When we were stand Ng by the kitchen I saw one of the staff take the ice cream scoop by his hand from a bucket and put it in the ice cream cup. Ofcourse I wouldn't have made my son eat that. On top of that the brunch food on a Saturday was 1star taste wise anyways , terrible crab scramble . My stomach hurts since then.", "author": "Ahmed S."}

I have tried the sweet potato pancakes, salmon eggs benedict as well as the pulled pork eggs benedict. ALL delicious! \nThe pancakes are definitely my favorite so far, mainly because I love sweet breakfast foods, but the salmon benedict is a close second. At first it has a very strong and unexpected taste, but it definitely keeps you coming back for more.\n\nThe service here was great, the waiter was very attentive and had good suggestions for us during our first time here. I was surprised at how empty it was during brunch on a Sunday, though the cheap and easy Art's Cafe is next door. Still, I have been sending everyone I know over to Fresca to try the brunch.

Luckily, we were given a great table that was somewhat secluded. I noticed some diners (usually groups of two) were seated pretty closely to separate parties.\n\nOur server was friendly and helpful. I originally planned to order Bistek A Lo Pobre (New York steak with a fried egg and plantain), but he made the halibut special ($28) sound so mouth-watering, I decided to try it. WOW, it was just as wonderful as he described. The halibut was buttery and melt-in-your-mouth. It came on a bed of spinach and a fried rice cake and the entire dish was surround by a creamy, spicy sauce. I LOVED it!\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered Paella ($29). It was a large portion and pretty tasty. The shrimp were large and cooked perfectly. His mother ended up ordering the Bistek A Lo Pobre ($28) and it was also tasty. The portion was HUGE. This is easily a two person entree. She has tried this dish in Peru and thought Fresca's version was just as good. The plantain is what adds a unique flavor to this dish. My finance's dad ordered Lomo Saltado ($22), tenderloin steak with onions, tomatoes, fries, and rice) and it was flavorful, however the meat was a little chewy.  \n\nFor drinks, fianc\u00e9 and his mom tried the Pisco Sour Classico and Morado Sour. They're bitters with foamy egg white in them. These were quite sour and not for me, however my fianc\u00e9 enjoyed his drink.\n\nOverall, I loved my halibut special and I liked the dishes my family ordered. Our dishes were so satisfying and big that we didn't have room for appetizers or dessert. I definitely recommend Fresca and know I'll be coming here again.", "author": "Amry K."}

NO LINE OUT THE DOOR!!! BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS!! And...the BEST damn pancakes ever (sweet potato pancakes!!) May I also suggest the crab omelette...off the hook! Also really fabulous coffee. I think my favorite thing is that you can get breakfasty things or lunch things, so if eggs 10 million ways aren't your thing, they are sure to have some amazing peruvian meaty dish that will be.\n\n3) Fabulous dinner menu - the ceviche is fresh and delicious. My husband got the Lomo Saltado - the flavor was unreal, as was the tomato broth with my catch of the day, mahi mahi (cooked perfectly). Satisfying, delicious, and reasonable portions.\n\n4) Finally - the service. It is always very good. Last night we had Ivan - he was totally on point (thank you for writing our order down, it drives me nuts when waiters don't do that and then come back 5 minutes later wanting to know what it was you wanted again).

Hunger battled the knowledge of bills looming on the horizon as we sat on the verge of leaving.  \n\nLong story short, hunger won out.  The only thing that appealed was the paella to share and we ordered a couple of small appetizers for immediate consumption.  This was the right thing to order.

I would definitely come back. \n\nShort version: get the skewer sampler and the Lomo Saltado. You will be happy.\n\nGood stuff first: We only tried two things, but the food was absolutely fantastic. We started with the skewers sampler and I was impressed by the great charred flavor they were able achieve. The flavors were spot on and skewers tasted like they were right off the grill -  and I had to negotiate with my wife who got to eat the last piece of which one (chicken, sole, steak and mmm mmmm chorizo y shrimp). We also had the Lomo Saltado which, when it came out, I was expecting to be disappointed ( cause it looked somewhat sad). But, alas MFer, I was gladly mistaken. It was god damn delicious. Fries were crispy, steak was perfectly cooked sauce was amazing and the rice soaked up everything in the most delicious way possible. \n\nHigh five to the boss man for axing Pasion. That place was poop. This place, however....is the opposite of poop. It is delicious.\n\nGripes last: Did you remodel this place??? The only major complaint is that the decor (especially the awful bar) reminds me of my previous poor experiences when this place was Pasion. It's just generic and shitty in general.

There was no part of this experience that was commendable in any way except that the bathroom was remarkably clean and spacious and that our server was not awful. We had brunch as a group of four. I ordered eggs benedict with pulled pork and rosemary bacon, along with one of their cocktails, while the other three people in my party ordered bottomless mimosas. \n\nThere was zero rosemary flavor to the bacon and it was limp and undercooked. An inability to provide good bacon at a brunch place is a huge red flag-- alas, this was not the end.The eggs benedict came with two hard-boiled-- not poached-- eggs. Everyone at my table had some sort of dish that advertised poached eggs-- we all received eggs hard-boiled as rocks. I'm unclear on why this restaurant seems unable to poach an egg correctly- there are literal buzzfeed videos that break it down simply. The fries that came with my benedict were limp and soggy, and I asked for aioli but got this super watery, cilantro sauce instead. The hollandaise sauce atop my eggs was weirdly lemony (but in a dishsoap kind of way, not a tasty citrus kind of way)-- and finally, the pork had zero seasoning. zero. I don't understand how you can call yourself a peruvian place when you're clearly completely averse to spices. \n\nTo add insult to injury, the place ran out of their \"bottomless\" mimosas barely forty minutes into our meal. My friends asked multiple servers for refills, was told they were coming, and finally our server showed up with the check and shrugged. there was no offer to comp the mimosas or provide another beverage in its place. To my mind, this is the literal least that could have been done-- if you charge people for a 2-hour bottomless drink, and can barely serve them for half that time, you comp the drinks or provide something else in its place. The waiter showed up with a refill when we were getting up to leave, which-- thanks dude, really helpful.\n\nAn absolute disgrace of a restaurant.

I was really happy that there wasn't a wait since my fave brunch spot (kitchen story) could easily be a 2hr wait.

I didn't really want to move since I was comfortable but we did anyways to help the host out. So we went along with our brunch, waiter was sweet, and the food was ok etc. So at maybe 1045am I notice the table that I was in get seated with 4 people which I'm like ?????? because you asked us to move to seat 4 people which is really stupid cause that's how many people we had as well....... My friends complain amongst each other as to why we had to move when that table got filled by the same amount of people and no significant change had been made.  BUT then, the host has the nerve to really come up to my table and tell me that I need to leave right now because the party of 23 is here. I thought this was the reason why we moved in the first place to resolve the party of 23 issue. He told my table and another table next to mine but didn't tell the booth table (my original table.) So I have no idea why they got to stay at their table for however long they wanted to when my party arrived first......So I basically got kicked out because I was in the way of the party of 23 but my original table didn't get kicked out. So if I was still in that table I would of been able to enjoy a lot longer because they were not in your way of the party of 23.......Terrible.", "author": "Mauricia L."}

My cousin and I were seated promptly, and that was the highlight of the meal.  \n\nDrinks---\n\nAfter both ordering the lomo saltado lunch special, our fountain beverages arrived.  When my cousin first tasted her soda, she said, \"There is something wrong with this.  There are no bubbles. It tastes weird.\"  I tasted my soda, and I agreed with my cousin.  She ordered a replacement soda, but this time she switched from cola to lemon lime.  She didn't even get a full sip before she said, \"this one is worse.\" We discussed the problem with the waiter, and he \nsaid there was a \"problem with the lines all week.\" He offered to bring her a replacement drink, and she chose lemonade.  The lemonade was good, and I, too, decided to switch drinks.  \n\nSalad\n\nOur lunch specials came with a choice of soup or salad.  We both chose salad, which was supposed to be a mixed green salad dressed with a creamy cilantro dressing.  The salad looked and tasted like it was dressed with olive oil.  I couldn't taste any cilantro, and it did not appear to be a creamy dressing.  I do not like my salad swimming in dressing, but I really couldn't taste any cilantro.\n\nMain course - Lomo Saltado\n\nAfter the disappointing drinks and salads, we both hoped that our main course would be better, but our experience managed to get worse.  Upon the arrival of our plates, my cousin tasted her french fries and said, \"wow, they didn't salt these at all.\"  I tasted mine and said, \"I must have gotten your salt and mine.\" My fries were pretty salty, but after a disappointing salad, I was hungry.  I got about four bites into my meal, when I discovered a large black hair in my lomo saltado.  My cousin saw me pulling our the hair and said, \"Are you serious?\" I said, \"yes.  A hair.  This is a horrible meal.\"  \n\nI told the waiter about the hair, and they offered to make me a new entree.  As hungry as I was, I declined the offered.  My cousin couldn't and didn't really enjoy her meal because she was concerned she too might find a stray hair.  \n\nThe Check\n\nWhen I received the check, I noticed that the waiter did not charge me for my meal, which I appreciated as I only had a few bites before I noticed the hair.  The bill came out to a little more than $16, and I gave a $20 bill.  When the check returned to me, my change was only $3.  Thats right.  They didn't even give me the proper change.  I was so angry that I didn't even say anything; we just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. I'm surprised I bothered to leave a tip.  \n\nOur waiter was very polite about the issues with the drinks and the main course, but I feel insult was added to injury when I didn't get the proper change. I felt cheated.  This last experience left me with a horrible memory of Fresca.  I am sad because I used to love it, but I guess I need to find a new Peruvian restaurant.", "author": "Gabrielle W."}

It came with rice & fries...really rice and fries? I didn't eat the rice, the fries were of the shoestring variety properly cooked, crispy on the outside tender inside. However, the fries should not be the highlight of the dish. The beef although well seasoned was chewy and was a bit on the salty side. Service was excellent and we were served in reasonable time. I never complain about price but a few cuts of less than quality beef and the rest being 2 starches I think it was way over-priced. This is not a place I'd go back to.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-05-30", "description": "First, let me clarify, this is a review for the weekend brunch and the 1 star is a review of the overall unpleasant experience. If I were rating the food, to be fair, the flavors were fairly complex and would rate somewhat higher than 1 star.\n\nI had a poor experience for dinner at their restaurant on West Portal years ago and the experience was so bad that I never ate at any of their locations again. Today, my family and I were looking to try a different brunch place in the neighborhood and since they opened fairly recently and have pretty decent yelp reviews, we thought we'd give it a try.\n\nThe restaurant is clean and we got there shortly after it opened at 10am and it was pretty empty, only 1 other table had diners. We ordered the crab omelette, the pork benedict, and  a side of bacon. \n\nOur waiter seemed quite friendly at first, chatting us up about the cold foggy weather. But the problems hit quickly after we ordered. Considering how there were very few customers there and I saw a full kitchen staff on the way in, the food was quite slow in coming, at least a 15 minute wait. \n\nHowever, the bigger issue was that when it did come, they got my husband's order wrong and did not bring our child's side of bacon. The busboy who was much more competent told us later that unfortunately, the server got the order wrong and completely forgot to even order the side of bacon. At least he was nice enough to apologize, no such behavior from the very incompetent \"server\" who tried to pretend like nothing happened. Pretty pathetic considering that our table was the only one he was actively serving!\n\nThe flavors of the crab omelette were tasty but only the egg part of it was somewhat warm. The crab and avocado inside were deathly cold which within minutes made the whole thing equally cold. A chilly omelette is pretty gross! The side of potatoes that came with it were pretty good but the portion size was completely skimpy. A $16 dish came with way fewer than 10 potatoes and just the omelette. No other sides like fruit or toast.\n\nI decided to give the \"waiter\" a second chance and provided my constructive feedback to him in a nice tone re: the cold filling in the omelette and the fact that he forgot part of our order and got basically 2/3 of our order wrong. I thought perhaps he would try to do something to make up for his errors and try to have the customers leaving the restaurant more satisfied. \n\nBut nope, all he said was that he'd tell the people in the back and tried to explain to me that the crab needed to be cold. I then proceeded to explain to him that I've had other crab omelettes in other establishments that had much warmer crab filling. Once again, no apology and no attempt to give us a break on the check or any other gesture to let us know they care about our business.\n\nSo FRESCA, as a native San Franciscan, I'm done with you. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. There will absolutely NOT be a 3rd time at any of your restaurants for any type of meal and you can trust that I will be telling everyone I know not to eat at your very over-priced and generally lacking restaurant!", "author": "Judy M."}

Our waiter was really aloof and kept rushing us. HIs whole demeanor was rude. We asked about the difference between ceviche and tiradito, and the staff member who explained it didn't do a very good job of telling us exactly what it was, because he basically said that it was just like ceviche just in a \"different shape.\" It sounded good, so I ordered the sampler. When it arrived it came in a really gaudy display that took up the whole table, and was basically just a 4 different pieces of sashimi in a different sauce, not really like ceviche at all. \n\nFor my main, I ordered what was described as a sweet potato stew, but when it came out it was in a GIANT CERAMIC TUB, and was almost overflowing. It was basically a ton of bland mushed sweet potatoes with some cubes of white cheese and green beans. I wanted to cry. My husband ordered the same thing and we just looked at what we ordered and knew this was such a bad idea coming here.\n\nThe whole tab came out to over $75. I couldn't wait to get the f out of there. Such a huge rip- off for lackluster service and bland over-priced food.

I told him I was able to do that previously at Pasion, but he just said no - didn't even ask the manager, so instead of a sale for a half pitcher, we just got water.  I can understand if I said \"I want half a steak\".  I didn't want multiple glasses of sangria as then we'd have to flag someone down and wait for a new glass.  That's why we like having the pitcher there to refill ourselves.\n\nOrdered the beef heart skewers that came out on a wood cutting board - the juices dripped onto the table as it was placed down.  This should be served on a plate or a cutting board with an indentation to hold the juices.  Dipping sauce was a little too much like mayo.  The beef heart was good aside from the dipping sauce.\n\nPaella was good, wasn't given a small bowl for the shells like usual.\n\nI ordered the braised pork shoulder.  This wasn't moist enough and was served with white rice and beans.  Since it wasn't that moist, they should have had more of the braising liquid so that the rice would have some flavor too.

The rice was SO SO salty it gave me a headache and I can't even think about eating my leftovers, my mouth is still recovering from the sodium onslaught. The dining room is loud(which is not surprising as it has been for the last two restaurants that have been in this location) and I found myself struggling to hear my partner, even though the restaurant was not full. The staff was friendly and prompt. I don't know why this locations food is lacking compared to the others, but I won't be returning.", "author": "Sophia C."}

Everything is so delicious, but the line gets long during dinner time. Would love to come back.", "author": "Eleanor C."}
