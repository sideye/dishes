After about two hours of taking in Japantown's 51st Cherry Blossom Festival, King Lee's, which BE Nom Nom, INDEED!  \n\nNot too crowded but always has customers.  Plenty of parking and the ambience is homey and accepting.  Normally, I would worried about restaurants that may have an outward appeal, \"that could use improvements.\"  On the contrary, King Lee restaurant's personality and soul attracted my attendance to their miscalculated rated establishment; was the tantalizing smells wafting persuasively out the front door.\n\nSimple menu, good prices, and a perfect list of Lunch Specials. Boy oh boy!  Hot tea came out, and it was still hot after three tea cups, oh, and actually tasted like green tea.  (Free by the way!) Then the awaited arrival of my Salt and Pepper Wings and complimentary steam rice.  The sweet and attentive waitress/hostess was very professional and busy, and at this point, the atmosphere started to work for me.  I felt at home.\n\nThree bites, just three, well-prepared and palate-pleasing!  I literally stopped eating just to write a quick review. (which I am now fixing.)\n\nJust delicious, just aroma appealing, just my kind of wings!\n\n(Going to enjoy my hot green tea and wings leave me alone, oh and it was less then $10.00!). \"This was written earlier\" -Me\n\nAmazing!\n\nFYI: If you like decent food for the right price and proportion, this place's lunch specials are available between 12-3pm, but anytime is the BEST time to come in!!!", "author": "Matthew A."}

I did not see any peppers in the dish.  While the slices of beef were nice and large, there was also a certain level of oiliness.  They did include the sides of hot sauce I requested.  Upon delivery, the food was basically room temperature.   The portion was pretty large.\n\nThe General's Chicken was also very bland.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The portion was large and almost all chicken.  The was no pesky broccoli in the way.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3om64eu\n\nDelivery - The order was placed at 1:41 PM.  The estimated time for delivery was 2:50 PM.  The actual time of delivery was 2:54 PM.   The delivery was relatively prompt.  But at just over an hour, it is certainly not the fastest of delivery options.  The delivery person was professional and polite.\n\nThe order minimum is relatively low ($15).\n\nPacking - The food was neatly packed into traditional Chinese food containers.  However, upon arrival, none of the food was very hot.\n\nPrices - The prices were pretty much inline with what I expect for Chinese food delivery.  For orders over $15, there are options for coupons.  I chose the free pot stickers. \n\n1  General's Chicken (Hot)  $ 7.75\n2  Steamed Rice  $ 3.00\n2  Canned Soda  $ 2.00\n1  Mongolian Beef (Hot)  $ 7.75\n1  General's Chicken (Hot)  $ 7.75\n\nSubtotal  $28.25\nTax  $2.40\nTotal  $30.65\n\nOverall, this was mediocre Chinese food.  There are certainly better options out there.  It was not particularly bad.  It filled me up.  But there are a lot of Chinese restaurants that offer delivery.  I can't really see ordering from King Lees again.\n\nFortune - The first fortune cookie did not have a fortune.

King Lee's is located near the Fillmore Safeway plaza, right next to a Panda Express. I decided to skip the $5 lunch specials at King Lee's (includes soup, egg roll and rice) and order from the meal since I wanted the walnut tofu and the King Lee's special veggies. With rice for two and three free egg rolls came to $20 with tip and can feed 2-4.\n\nThe walnut tofu is really different, I have a love/hate. Its overly sweet much like General Tao's or Sweet & Sour but it has a mild, almost milky/savoy flavor which is nicely complimented by the toasted walnuts. There are very few tofu dishes like this. I could see myself trekking across town for the walnut tofu. The King Lee Special Veggies contains green beans, eggplant and fried tofu triangles in a mild spicy sauce. It can be oily at times, much like all Chinese food but the flavors are good and consistent.\n\nThey made the food for take-out in less than 5 minutes. King Lee's dining room is dirty. If the kitchen is anything like the dining room I can imagine some scary stuff happening, but I have never gotten sick. I have never ordered delivery, but now they are on Grub Hub. My take out experience was awesome! If I am back in the hood, I will be here at King Lee's getting food to-go.", "author": "Shannon Z."}

Although the place is empty most of the time, they do mad work take-outs and delivery so don't let that fool you into believing the place sucks.\n\nThey have a very good menu full of authentic and Americanized dishes. It is like taking a restaurant out of Chinatown and planting it in Pacific Heights. They know how to cook it to get those taste and flavors of real Chinese food. My favorites were the salt and pepper squid and fried pork chop. Like the usual Chinese restaurant, you get great bang for your buck.

I've come to really appreciate their food.  Some have told me that their food is often oily and stomach pain-inducing.  \n\nI've now had their food on numerous occasions and have yet to encounter the physical effects they describe.  As a matter of fact, I've tried many of their dishes by now and have enjoyed most of their meals.\n\nChicken Fried Rice\n-the chicken is very tender, bursting with flavor in every bite... hard to believe, right?  That's what I thought too until I bit into that chicken... on two different days.\n\nBeef Chow Fun\n-now THIS is an oily dish.  Then again, when is beef chow fun ever NOT oily?  The dish here, however, is pretty flavorful with not too much soy sauce flavor, but not too bland like some places I've tried.  The beef is well cooked, meaning not UNDER-cooked, and the overall meal was enjoyable.\n\nBeef and Tofu\n-At this point, this is probably my favorite dish.  The sauce that covered both the tofu and beef was the game changer.  While I'm not sure what exactly the sauce was, it was a good mix of tangy and salty.  Maybe a little garlic somewhere in the mix?  I'll have to try more dishes to determine how this compares with what I've had so far.\n\nGarlic Chicken\n-Tasty chicken, but too much crowding of the veggies.  It seemed almost like they put so many veggies to take up the space where the chicken should have been.  What the heck?  The meal was good, with a pronounced garlic scent and flavor, but it might not be a good idea to have this during lunch at work.\n\nHot and Sour Soup\n-A good sour kick in this soup, I'd call this a legitimate H&S item to have even when comparing it to other full fledged Chinese restaurants, formal or informal.  The price comes in at a mere $5.00, but has enough soup for 3 people.  I recommend this to anyone who likes H&S Soup.\n\nTomato with Tofu Soup\n-Bland, leave it alone.  The tomatoes couldn't even save it.  Nothing could have saved this watery bowl of disaster.  Where's my H&S Soup?\n\nQuick delivery, solid food most of the time, great prices... 4 Stars, easily.", "author": "Johnson N."}

Alas, this is the system we're stuck with.\n\nI've actually only had it delivered, so I can't attest to the dine-in experience but I've walked by it on the way to Harputt's and it looks nice enough. The delivery is unbelievably fast, I think they may have a secret network of underground tunnels throughout the city with their delivery boys manning supersonic rocket sleds. When I lived in the Haight I'd sometimes have it more than once a week so I began timing them to see how quickly they could make it. Most of the time it was in the twenty minute range, already dumb fast, but the fastest ever was 13 minutes. Think about that for a second. It must take at least 12 minutes to actually cook the food, pack it up, and hop into the sled. Needless to say my food was always fresh and piping hot, though sometimes the bag smelled suspiciously of rocket fuel.\n\nThere is a guy a couple of reviews away from me who said the delivery took 45 minutes and he lived four blocks from there. I'd bet that King Lee was punishing him for sloth; the old man Lee is a fair but stern monarch. \n\nLike I said everything is always fresh and hot, crispy vegetables and good fried rice with no peas in it.

And it ended up being one of the worst chinese food experiences I've ever had.  \n\nBroccoli beef:  The meat was stringy and tough with a very high fat content.  It was like having slivers of fat in your mouth that you had to chew to enough of a pulp to get it down your throat past the gag reflex.  I understand that this can't be helped entirely and its bound to happen.  But it was every single piece of beef in the dish.  In other words:  totally inedible.\n\nPrawns with Cashew Nuts:  Prawns were probably in the sun a little too long out back.  They tasted overly fishy, and not in a good way.  Again, this dish was totally inedible.  And quite a bummer since i was looking forward to this dish. \n\nVegie chow mein:  The highlight of the meal (since you could eat it.  Although since i spent $25 on the three dishes combined and ended up eating just this one, it was kind of an expensive carton of noodles.  \n\nAgain, I've been here before and it was okay in the past; not great, but okay.  This time was horrendous.  Be prepared to take your chances. \n\nOh, and be sure to have it delivered.  The restaurant itself is pretty gross.  You definitely don't want to eat there.", "author": "Andrew S."}

They both wanted Chinese and I was happy to oblige.  We looked for the highest rated Chinese resto with the best prices et voila King Lee surfaced.  We ordered the Mongolian Beef (nice spice, not as much green onion as I am used to), Chicken and Veg (TERRIFIC--great variety of perfectly cooked veg, I'll get this again), Chicken Chow Mein (perfect--not greasy and good flavor), Hot and Sour Soup (a bit different from I've normally had it, but I think I liked it better--it tasted more fresh).  I liked that they don't include MSG and that they deliver!  I will definitely order from King Lee again.", "author": "Jenn A."}

You get free egg rolls/ hot & sour soup with orders over $15, but you need to ask for it or they won't give it to you. Delivery is also free within something like 30 minutes of driving time. Anyways the food is really good. I love the garlic chicken and also the sweet and sour pork. It tastes very fresh and they pack the to go boxes to the top so you get a lot of food for your buck. Prices range from about $4.95-$10.95 per item, but as I said you get big portions which means lots of left overs. Oh yeah, either get the food to go or get delivery, the place looks like a homeless shelter.", "author": "Josh S."}

Probably at the same level as other good Chinese I've had, but delicious. \nChicken Fried Rice- I like to get this instead of plain white rice. Very good. Not dry at all. \n\nAll this cost $32 and was delivered from the restaurant to the Tenderloin in 25 minutes. That's crazy.

The egg rolls, while there were only three of them, were really good and fresh tasting.  They weren't like those processed or over-fried egg rolls that turn your bowels upside down.  The egg drop soup was to die for and came in a giant Tupperware thing.  I had a second helping of the soup, and I'm not even that big a fan of soups.  The szechuan beef was pretty good, not too spicy, but a few pieces in there that were more fat than meat.  But the chicken chow mein??  OH my god.  SO good.  While I was eating it, I noticed that it was fresh.  I never knew chow mein could be fresh.  but the flavoring was perfect, the sauce wasn't overdone, the chicken was very tender, and the noodles... oh man... the noodles were like little golden strands of heaven in my mouth.\n\nI have found my home base for ordering Chinese delivery.  :D", "author": "Emily K."}
