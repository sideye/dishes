Is there really more to life than this?\n\nSeriously, I've been waiting to visit a place like Freshroll. Pick your own protein (tofu, pork, shrimp or chicken) and pick your own fillings (cucumber, noodles, bean sprouts, carrots, etc.). There are four sauces to choose from (Grandma's peanut sauce, citrus ginger, sweet & sour chili, and Vietnamese vinaigrette). Three spring rolls are ~$10. They also have banh mi sandwiches, rice or noodle bowls, and pho noodle soup. Unfortunately, they ran out of the broth for the pho when we arrived.\n\nI got the lemongrass pork for all three spring rolls. Inside, I got extra noodles, extra cucumbers, crispy shallots, and scallions. You're allowed five total (noodles are included by default). Avocado is over a dollar extra, so no thanks. I also got a couple containers of the peanut sauce. The sauce was nothing spectacular, and it was freezing cold -- but the rest of the meal was quite good. I would absolutely try this place again.\n\nStill, good food doesn't overshadow shoddy service. Most of the employees were nice, but one woman in particular was very clearly not happy to be working late on a Friday and wanted to go home as soon as possible. She was packing up the chairs and tables despite over 15 minutes to spare til closing time, when customers were still walking inside to order.

On top of that, the rolls are wrapped like fat mini burritos. What on earth is going on here?! The wrap was also dry and not hydrated properly. The peanut sauce tasted like a supermarket generic brand balsamic vinaigrette. All wrong. Just all wrong. \n\nThis is pretty much the chipotle of Vietnamese food. The ingredients for the rolls are also soooo Americanized that you can't even complete an authentic Vietnamese roll. Just like chipotle.\n\nIf your Vietnamese food isn't being made by Vietnamese aunties, or at least Vietnamese people or Asians, well, you might as well just tell them to give u the ingredients and do it yourself. If you see college kids doing it too, just starve yourself and call it a fasting diet. Spare your wallet. \n\nMy friend and I came here due to hunger. What a tragedy.

We typically use the location in Fidi on Bush but we had other business in Soma nearby so we ordered from that location. The online order was placed at 11am. This location opens at 11:30am. Knowing that it's prime lunch rush time I gave a little leeway and showed up at 12:30 (even though the order was supposed to be ready at 12) when I arrived I was told the order wasn't ready and hat it would be another 10-15 minutes. I asked why since I placed my order before they even opened and the person behind the counter said they were very busy. So I waited 15 minutes and checked in again. I was at this point told that the food wasn't ready and they needed another 10-15 minutes. The line was out the door and I get it. I've worked in kitchens and deli's during lunch rush. But this was just poor service. There were people that came in after me that were sitting down and eating. Meanwhile I had a team of hungry workers. The order was finally ready at 1:10- sort of. They didn't get all the drinks and I had to grab my own from the drink case. The ones I ordered were not in stock. \n\nThis is not a worker issue. This is a management issue. If you have a customer spending over $100 on spring rolls and you don't have the decency or capacity to communicate the errors with them or support your team to push through everything, then maybe you should not be managing a business. Nobody attempted to make this right with me. And when I asked the person behind the counter why my food was over an hour late, he pointed to the line out the door and said \"as you can see, we're a little overwhelmed\" BUT WERE YOU OVERWHELMED AT 11AM WHEN OUR ORDER WAS PLACED? OR AT NOON WHEN IT WAS DUE? SO OVERWHELMED THAT YOU COULDN'T CALL WIH A HEADS UP OR OFFER TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS ERROR???", "author": "Rubie K."}

What I will say is why there is a star missing is that I would like more protein options as well as different flavor profiles. If you mix the sauces and the marinades of how the meats are cooked its basically the same thing.

But if not, my go-to is the tofu (that comes out around $11). You can pick up to five toppings and they have a pretty sweet selection: parsley, cucumber, bell peppers, crispy shallots, lettuce, carrots, pickled veggies, and so on. The last step is picking out your choice of dip: Vietnamese vinaigrette, peanut sauce, sweet and sour sauce. Side note: if you guys are feeling pho, that's only available M-F after 3.\n\nIf waiting in line isn't your thing, you can also order ahead online (huge plus for those ordering on their lunch break).

My boyfriend got the banh mi sandwich and the lemongrass pork filling of pretty tasty, but the bread was not the best. It was a little flimsy for my taste. We prefer either a stronger baguette or a flaky Viet roll. I also tried the beef pho which was pretty good, but the broth was a little lacking in flavor. I wasn't too surprised because it is very Americanized.\n\nI also tried all of the sauces and I can say hands down that the peanut sauce is the best. It was so delicious on the spring rolls. The rest of the sauces are kinda bland though, so there isn't much use for them. The service is great, but they work so slow.\n\nOverall, I love this place, but I don't love the high prices. Regardless of the price, I will definitely be back.", "author": "Theo T."}

My husband and I decided to give it a try.  The place is connected to the mall so you have to park in the parking garage. The place is a decent size.  \n\nThe server didn't ask us if we have been there. We were puzzled at how to place an order.  So you have four options:  \n1.  spring rolls (3 pieces)\n2. Sandwiches  \n3. Vermicelli bowl (dry noodles)\n4.  Pho bowl (soup noodles)\n\nWe decided to try their spring rolls.  So how you order for spring rolls is you tell them what kind of filling (chicken, pork, tofu, or shrimp for $1.15 extra).  We ordered shrimps.  The shrimps they served wasn't the big shrimps that are made for this dish. Then you tell them what kind of greens.  We order the combo which comes with everything like bean sprout and jalape\u00f1os.  (The jalape\u00f1os has some kick though). Then they amaturely roll up the goodies. It's almost like they intentionally make it look bigger so you feel like it's worth $10.  It's hard to eat bc the food just fall apart. Both the filling and sauce lacks flavor.  When a spring roll is rolled correctly the rolled is tight with lots of filling. Easy to hold, eat and enjoy.  Don't expect that here. Very disappointed. But kudos for their first attempt of a fast food spring rolls.", "author": "Hollie H."}

I only go here if I can get here before the noon rush, though; otherwise, the line is out the door and takes a while. The peanut sauce is quite yummy. The tofu is meh. It is crispy, which is nice, but it hasn't been cooked with any flavor. This is fine by me, because I can dip it in the sauce. But then I don't have enough sauce for the rest of the dish. Overall, I find the ratios of stuff a little off for my personal tastes -- a little too much rice, not enough tofu. The other thing that makes me not love this place is that the tofu is in long strips, the vegetables are in long strips. My bowl would be way easier to eat if the stuff was chopped up a bit. I mean, I don't really want to attempt eating at my desk at work with long strips of carrots hanging out of my mouth every time I take a bite. There is no easy way to cut them.

In fact, we ordered the \"standard\" bowl with no substitutions whatsoever and I would've loved to just pick that off the shelf and go to the cashier straightaway. Fine if you want to have a second line for those picky folks, but whyyyyyyy do you make me stand in line while I could already be happily eating my lunch in the nearby park? We have only a limited time to have lunch after all! Grrrr. \n\nFood is actually quite tasty, especially the bowl. Make sure you get the peanut sauce and dribble some of it over the rice. Yummy!", "author": "Uli B."}

Not sure why there's so many high reviews but the protein option didn't look appetizing. Usually, when you walk into Chipotle the meat is hot and looking real good where you're like yes! I want barbacoa today. Well, none of the protein options were like that. The strips of pork and chicken looked questionable and the shrimp seemed like it was sitting out for awhile. I went for the tofu which was a bit stale. Definitely not piping hot or crispy from the fryer. It said a lot when I asked for nuoc mam (vietnamese vinaigrette) & they didn't even know what that was. Also surprised they don't even serve egg rolls with these bowls. Definitely doesn't do the vietnamese vermicelli bowls justice and not repping too well in my opinion. They should check out east coast's rollplay.", "author": "Anh N."}

I am from Northern Virginia, which is crawling with amazing pho places, and every time I get pho, I have to get the \"summer rolls\" to start.  I was so excited to see build your own rolls on the menu!  What an innovative and easy concept-- I am surprised this is the first time I had seen it.\n\nI had the rolls with \"the standard\" (I had actually asked for a little of every topping but quickly changed my mind when I was told it would be two dollars extra :P).  The meal came with three rice paper rolls filled with your choice of meat, rice noodles, lettuce, bean sprouts, pickled vegetables, cucumber, and cilantro, which is pretty standard for any summer roll you may have had before.  I had the chicken, which I thought was very flavorful, probably due to the fact that it was most, if not all, dark meat.  I loved trying all the sauces as well.  My favorites were the sweet chili sauce and the peanut sauce.\n\nI also got an order of the taro chips, which the samples at the cashier had tempted me to do so.  The portion size was a little disappointing given the price ($2 for the size of a small fries, but remember, chips have larger volume then fries do).  The chips were hit or miss-- some were crunchy, some were a little soggy. I question how fresh they really were or how long ago they had been fried.\n\nThe three rolls were quite large and very filling.  For a $9 meal I was sufficiently satisfied and full for the rest of the day.  I am glad that I can finally get summer rolls outside of a restaurant setting, but they are not much different than you would expect.", "author": "Michelle W."}

The quality and service of Freshroll has steadily declined since my first visit and now it's terrible.  \n\nFor those new to Freshroll, it started like the Chipotle of Vietnamese food.  They offer sandwiches, spring rolls, salads, rice bowls, noodle bowls, and Pho soup - all with the same set of ingredients.  Pretty tasty for the most part.  \n\nBut overtime, Freshroll has become more like the \"Subway of Vietnamese.\"  The quality of the food has only gone down a bit, but the service has dramatically declined, and prices have slowly risen.\n\nI'll share just what happened today (Mar 13, 2015) as a representative example.\n\nThey have made the menu so complicated in order to price discriminate.  Gone are the simple days of \"Choose your type, choose your protein, choose your toppings..\" Now every permutation of items has a different cost.  Shrimp costs $2 extra, Steak costs $1 extra, Fried scallions is $1 extra, avocado $1 extra, etc.  \n\nAnd, if you go over 3 toppings on the sandwich, they charge $0.50 per topping!!  You get 5 toppings on the salad, but the 6th will cost another $0.50 each.  Of course, $0.50 isn't enough for avocado, so that's an extra $1.00.  When I asked for extra jalape\u00f1o, there was an obvious pause as she decided if that would cost an extra $0.50.  (It used to be that toppings were all included in the price.)\n\nAfter fighting my way through the line like a broken record, \"Yes, that's fine, I'll pay the extra fee...\" I get to the checkout.  I ordered a side of taro chips for my two entrees (for a friend and me), and then I asked for sauces.  They said I could only get two pre-packaged sauces.  I remember being annoyed by that during my last visit, but I assumed at least it was 2 sauces per entree - no, two sauces per order, and no extra sauces for ordering the taro chips, which are presumably designed to dip in the sauces.  \n\nOf course, when I went to pour my own sauce, they were out of my favorite, the Orange Ginger sauce.  When I asked for more, I got a frustrated, \"I told you, only two sauces\" look.  After he realized they had run out of self-service sauce, he begrudgingly got me two more sauces.\n\nRather the sauces to me, he tried to cram them into the salad bowl.  This is pretty disgusting, especially given the slovenly appearance of the clerk, but also that he had been handling money without gloves - the same hands that carried the bowl and shoved it deep into my salad.  \n\nBetween the nickel-and-diming and the poor service, I was already pretty disappointed.  So imagine my frustration when I get home and notice there are no taro chips!!  \n\nI was tempted to go back to get the missing items, but I decided to pass - I don't think I want to step foot in Freshroll again.", "author": "Greg B."}

They make your food in the assembly-line-style similar to chipotle's process. It's pretty quick, and it's always nice to watch them prepare your food. One bad thing though, is when it gets crowded, the cashiers tend to be a bit slow or inattentive as it seems there is no specific assigned cashier. There's 2 cashier spots but sometimes only one is filled despite the growing line.\n\nThe food is good! I got the 3 fresh rolls with lemon grass pork. For fillings I got lettuce, cucumbers, pickled carrots, and avocado (avocado is +1 dollar). The food is nice and fresh, they did a pretty good job with the pickled carrots too. It's also pretty clever of them to put lettuce leaves between each spring roll so they don't stick together!\n\nIt's a pretty nice place to stop by for an early dinner or late lunch (I came during those times and the line wasn't as long).

I definitely understand more of the hype now.\n\nFirst of all, it may have a Chipotle-style assembly line, but I wouldn't recommend coming if you're expecting a super quick, fast food-style meal. Their assembly line may be reminiscent of fast food, but there's nothing fast food about it. Ingredients are FRESH, and lines take longer than expected, only because it takes a bit more time and care to compile all of those fresh ingredients for your meal, particularly for the spring rolls.\n\nMy boyfriend and I opt for either the spring rolls or a noodle bowl (usually one of both so we can steal bites of each other's), both with lemongrass pork and \"the standard\" fillings. The term \"the standard\" is deceiving because it sounds like you're getting the bare minimum, but it includes a generous amount of a bunch of different fillings. Seriously, they completely stuff the spring rolls and bowls. So much so that sometimes the spring roll rips open, and then they tear the whole thing apart and re-roll it in a new spring roll wrapper for you. \n\nOne of my favorite things about this place is THE SAUCES. Omg. They're all SO good that we usually dine in, just so we can grab all of the bottles and make sure that we have enough. My boyfriend's favorite is the peanut sauce, but I love all the others just as much. Do yourself a favor and try all of them.\n\nWhen available, I like getting a side of the chicken pho broth. It's flavorful without a drop of oil/grease, and perfect for chilly days.\n\nTheir check-in offer doesn't show on the Yelp app, but make sure you show the cashier your check-in anyway for 10% of your purchase!\n\nOverall, it's simple, no-frills Vietnamese food done well with super fresh ingredients at a pretty affordable price.

The peanut sauce is pretty good. \n\nThis restaurant is relatively inexpensive for the amount of food you get, but if you start adding on extra ingredients (shrimp costs extra, for example), it comes out to be more pricey than you anticipated.

The tofu itself? Extra crispy.\nThe toppings? Plentiful and stays true to traditional Vietnamese flavors. Pickled veggies, lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumber, mint, cilantro, green onions. They get more creative with pineapple, fresh carrots, bell peppers, and avocado. They took away the Thai Basil as an ingredient, but they offer fried shallots for $1 more.\n\nI love mine with extra herbs, so pile on the cilantro and mint please! I opted for the extra fried shallots, but he barely sprinkled any on so I don't know if it's actually worth it or not. At least they don't skimp on other ingredients if you ask them for it.\n\nI added a side of taro chips for $2 and that was probably the best thing about this place!\n\nOnce you pay for your bowl, add your choice of sauce. Peanut sauce, sweet chile, a 'Nuoc Mam' of some sort, and a ginger-tasting one. All are vegan except the mam, which is fish sauce. Even though the peanut sauce was probably best for spring rolls and dipping, I liked this one the best and used it to dress my noodles. Of course, don't forget about the sriracha!\n\nIt has a clean and modern decor, and it is in a very central location. So be wary of peak lunch/dinner times and convention days where the lines can grow very long.\n\nFreshroll in the end was very tasty, modernizing the traditional Vietnamese cuisine and putting it in a fast-casual setting.\n\nLastly, they have cucumber water.\nI'm sold.", "author": "Lanie L."}

At first glance, this place looks like some sort of cheap Subway meets Lee's Deli type place. But don't be deterred by the cheesy green exterior. This fast casual eatery is quite the Saigon surprise. \n\nThe concept is like an \"Americanized\" Vietnamese Chipotle. Choose your style of food (soup, sandwich, bowl, or spring roll); choose your protein (chicken, steak, pork); and then select the sauce you'd like to pair with it. I wound up ordering the spring rolls with grilled chicken and paired with sweet and sour chili sauce. But if you want other sauces, they have others to choose from on the counter. The spring rolls are filled with a delicious medley of lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumbers, cilantro, pickled veggies, and jalapenos (optional). As you can tell by the healthy ingredients, this is far more healthy than your average burrito. I was also amazed by the generous portions for just $9. My 3 spring rolls were the size of a baby's arm (ok, weird comparison, I know - but you get the idea). Truth be told, I could only get through two of the rolls before I finally caved in to my full belly. \n\n* For you pho lovers, please note that they only serve pho after 3pm on weekdays.\n\nMy only gripe with this particular Freshroll was the cleanliness of the place. There were many tables that were in desperate need of bussing. It's not exactly appetizing when you sit down for lunch and have to wipe down the table with a napkin and dispose of the previous diners' plates.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid SOMA lunch spot.

He took me here after noticing that I was craving pho.\n\nThis looks to be one of the more unique lunch options if shopping at the Metreon. It's a simple dining spot with indoor and outdoor seating and the corner area closest to the entrance is a prime spot for people-watching along 4th Street.\n\nThe restaurant aims to serve all-natural meats and locally-sourced vegetables. Their sauces are available to add after getting your food. I like that their model keeps the menu options simple, limiting to 4 different types of orders of Vietnamese food: 3 Freshrolls (spring rolls, $7.95), The Sandwich (Banh Mi, $6.95), The Bowl (think rice or vermicelli bowls with choice of noodles or white/brown rice, $7.95) and pho ($8.95), which is supposed to be sold after 3pm. The No1DP and I came at noon and though we ordered different items, we noticed that some people eating before and after us were eating pho. If this applies only on weekends, this should be made more clear. \n\nNo1DP ordered 3 Freshrolls containing 2 garlic shrimp and 1 chicken. Though he liked his rolls, he was surprised that jalape\u00f1os were quite spicy and had a hard time getting through his rolls.\n\nI got their garlic shrimp rice bowl containing lettuce, jalape\u00f1os, cucumbers, and scallions.

Everything costs about the same, around $10 if you don't add any extras and everything tastes pretty similar. The food is surprisingly filling, but to a person who likes eating chicken and meat like me you might end up with a rather unfulfilled feeling a little after you finish eating. The line to the restaurant is always super long! It goes out of the doors most days during lunch so my suggestion is to go during off-peak hours and the wait shouldn't be long at all. \nI recommend this place if you are looking for food with a very \"fresh\" taste to it as it is very good and probably the healthiest food I have eaten in a while.", "author": "Itzak H."}

The other day, a close friend of mine from Las Vegas came to town and wanted to grab lunch. I quickly jumped to the opportunity to reconnect with a friend from my past. The good thing was they were moving to SF VERY soon! They also suggested this place as they've visited this joint time and time again. I was super excited to try something new! \n\nHoly freshness! I loved the first impression I got from this place. We're talking about the Vietnamese style Chipotle. You approach the restaurant and think, clean eatery. The bright green colors makes a very vibrant restaurant. Nice modern table tops, high tops and window seating. In this eatery, you stand in line, just like Chipotle, walk through a line and pass through wiindowed food casing, like Chipotle, and choose the items you want, just like Chipotle. You can either choose: 3 freshrolls, a freshwich, the bowl or pho noodle soup, starting at $6.95. From that point, you can then choose the protein, veggies and sauces. \n\nFor my visit, I got the bowl for $7.95. I started with brown rice, half of  lemongrass pork and half grilled chicken, added avocado for $1, \"the standard\" veggie combo minus pineapple (lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, cucumbers, jalapenos), basil, carrots, scallions and pickled veggies. For my sauce, I got the Vietnamese vinaigrette. The flavors were on point! I think the vinaigrette and pickled veggies really tied everything together. The basil and scallions for me also solidified the vietnamese flavors. The meats were marinated nicely and really brought that savory side of the dish. \n\nAll in all, I really liked this place! It was quick, easy and had so many options. The lines are long, but I promise you, they move quickly. I work a couple of blocks from this place, so you know I'll be back very soon.

Freshroll is essentially the Vietnamese version of Chipotle. You order the type of food you want (fresh rolls, sandwich, or bowl) and can then customize the meat and veggies that go into it. It's fast, healthy, and delicious!\n\nI definitely recommend getting the 3 fresh rolls for $7.95. My go-to is always the lemongrass pork with lettuce, basil, cilantro, scallions, bean sprouts and pickled veggies. The rolls are made in front of you, so you know the food you'll be eating is going to be fresh. I've also tried their chicken pho broth, which was delicious. Their lychee iced tea was also on point, so I wish there was a stronger fruit flavor to it.\n\nThe only reason I'm docking off a star is the price. Last time I came to Freshroll, I paid more than $13 for the 3 fresh rolls, soup, and a drink. While I would be fine spending that sort of money in a sit down restaurant, I thought that the price was slightly ridiculous for a place like Freshroll. I understand the food is healthy and fresh, but more than $8 for three rolls that normally could count as an appetizer?

You get two sauces with your freshroll and I agree, peanut is the best. \n\nI really liked that you could request a change to the fillings (hell no to cucumber) and overall, they were pretty damn delicious.

You even get your choice of self-serve dipping sauces to choose from. \n\nPricing is around $8-12 depending on your protein choice and in San Francisco I think anything healthy around the $10 mark is a deal. Initially I was really interested in grabbing a hot bowl of pho but they don't serve it until after 3 pm, which was a total bummer. Still I enjoyed my three custom made summer rolls and found them to be quite filling. It's like eating a rolled up salad and now you don't have to worry about the carbs in the bread of a sandwich.

The setup is very similar to Chipotle with sandwich, bowl, spring roll, or pho (only available after 3pm) options.\n\nI got two bowls and two sandwiches (1 pork and 1 chicken of each) and got a little bit of every vegetable for the bowl. My items were lined up as so on the assembly line: bowl, bowl, sandwich, sandwich. As one girl finished my first bowl, another girl asked the man next to me what veggies he wanted on his bowl. Then she started filling up MY bowl with what the guy wanted. I had to stop her as she was putting a plethora of cilantro (as requested by the man) in my bowl. He and I agreed to switch bowls since he also ordered the pork in his. The staff really needs to communicate when it comes to filling the orders.\n\nWhen I checked out, the cashier fumbled to put my items together in a bag. Was it their first time filling a somewhat large order? \n\nI left and got back to the show to eat my lunch only to find that my bowl had brown rice :( I requested for white rice, but remember when that guy and I had to switch bowls? Sad.. Brown rice has higher levels of arsenic than that of white rice so I try to stay away from it.\n\nMy bowl was mostly salad with lots of veggies and I had to dig to find the meat and rice. I was also not impressed with the .10 charge for a bag. I get that I'm in SF and there is a charge for a bag at grocery stores and retail clothing stores, but for takeout lunch? At least tell me there is a charge so I can be environmentally friendly and opt for no bag.", "author": "Nitar L."}

Choice of a few fillings - tofu, pork and beef - and choices of traditional/standard veggies and some less traditional like avocados (guess we are in California) make for great finished product. While I was ordering my rolls, I felt like I was at a taqueria crafting my perfect meat and veggie mixture (rice paper) wraps. \n\nI quite enjoyed my traditional pork and beef rolls. I opted for the spicy chili sauce and peanut sauce and because I love sriracha I put slather a healthy squeeze in the peanut sauce. I'm a fan. Meats - tasty and grilled well. Veggies - standardly fresh when expected to be fresh and pickled just right when expected to be picked. \n\nAnother time I ordered the noodle bowl (but really wanted pho), they offered a small side of the pho broth and I made the bowl a pseudo bowl of pho back at the office.

Had a fairly decent experience here and I've been dying to try this place ever since I started working in San Francisco. It was pretty busy around the 11:30am lunchtime. It's in a fantastic location, right near tons of office buildings, a couple of museums, and public transportation.\nI got a bowl the other day with noodles, lemongrass pork, all toppings (lettuce, pickled veggies, bean sprouts, extra cilantro, cucumber, crispy shallots, and jalape\u00f1os), and the regular sauce that comes with the bowl. I didn't want all toppings but the ladies that were behind the counter didn't wait for my response after asking, they just piled everything on. I was fine with eating it still but I didn't really want a couple of things. I also asked for a side of what I thought was Sriracha mayo. I double checked with the cashier that it was sriracha mayo and he said yes but unfortunately it wasn't. It tasted more like a honey mustard or thousand island type of sweet orange sauce. So yeah totally unexpected. It tasted great on the lemongrass pork though but not the whole bowl itself. \nI would eat here again, it was quick and easy and overall didn't taste bad. It wasn't too expensive either, about 10 bucks. The service is just not too great, but the employees are generally nice. I feel like they get a little overwhelmed by how busy it gets. Hopefully my rating can go up a little the next time I come in though. I would definitely love to try the rolls next.", "author": "Cymone S."}

Anyway, I chose 2 grilled chicken and 1 garlic shrimp with \"The Standard,\" which includes lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, cucumbers, jalape\u00f1os, and pineapple. Then I added pickled veggies for free. Any other additions are free except for avocado, which is $1 more. \n\nI then proceeded to pay and I was asking what kind of flavor Izze drinks they had and the cashier just seemed very irritated and his coworker next to him was rude when she told me the drinks were actually behind me, which was my fault because I wasn't paying attention to the drinks when I walked in, but she didn't have to be rude. I was definitely expecting better customer service.\n\nThe grilled chicken rolls were good. The chicken was flavorful and everything was fresh. I especially loved the pineapple because it was sweet. The garlic shrimp roll was mediocre. You couldn't taste any garlic at all. I definitely won't be getting it next time. \n\nOverall, I think that this place has a cool concept. Like others have said, it's very reminiscent of a Vietnamese Chipotle in terms of choosing your protein and then what you want to go with it.

I went with two pork rolls and once chicken roll, with the works, all paired with their peanut dipping sauce.  I split the rolls with my girlfriend and didn't think it would be enough food.  Surprisingly, I actually got decently full from my half of the rolls and I thought they had great flavor.  The three-roll meal is about $8.50 and one roll is about $4.25, so definitely not the cheapest bite in the world, especially if you only get one roll.  However, the quality is great and they make it right in front of you, so you can be sure it's all fresh.\n\nService was fast and friendly and there's lots of seating in the dining area as well as outside.

I immediately thought of Freshroll, mostly because I had it in my mind to have Vietnamese food.\n\nWhen we walked in, it was evident that this was probably going to be closer to a fusion experience rather than an authentic one.  Not really a big deal to me, think of what goes through your mind when you walk into a Chipotle for the first time after thinking you want an authentic burrito.  Speaking of Chipotle, the ordering system works very similar to that.  My process went as follows:\n\n1) Pick your Style: Vermicelli noodle bowl\n2) Pick your Protein: Lemongrass pork\n3) Pick your Veggies: Bean sprouts, cucumbers, scallions\n4) Pick your Sauces: Vietnamese Vinaigrette (aka nuoc cham)\n\nIt was all placed very nicely into the bowl and my friend got a Vietnamese Iced Coffee along with her Pork noodle bowl.  I love nuoc cham, especially full-flavored and less diluted by water nuoc cham.  Freshroll's version (and then calling it vinaigrette...really?) was mediocre and was watery with not too much flavor in the bottle.  What I did like about the bowl was the pork.  It had a really good flavor to it and they gave me a very generous serving. The veggies were also good, and at the end of the meal, I really thought that while it pales in comparison to somewhere like Bun Mee, for being around Westfield and City Target, this was a solid lunch spot.

My boyfriend loves this and refuses to get anything else because he thinks it's the best bang for your buck. Granted, it is the cheapest out of the 3. \n-If you want something a little more light and refreshing, but still has substance, get the bowl. I personally love the bowl because you can load it with veggies and the fish sauce adds such a nice flavor.\n-I would stay away from the spring rolls. Don't get me wrong, they're still delicious, but for the price of 3 spring rolls, you can get the bowl which, in my opinion, has a much greater quantity. \n\nMy only caveat with this place is that the line is super long if you come during lunch hours on a work day, but it moves fast enough and it's definitely worth the wait.", "author": "Betty W."}

Same goes for the bowl. The spring rolls, though... that's where they really excel. For a mere $10 (including tax, not tip), you get three rice paper-wrapped rolls with your choice of fixins and protein. I always get the crispy tofu (double tofu, if I can afford it), lettuce, bean sprouts, pickled vegetables, red bell peppers, and jalepenos. \n\nCritical California con: the avocado never looks fresh, so I skip it. \n\nThis is probably the healthiest option that is close to my job, unless I'm in the mood for walking three blocks for a $13 build-your-own salad from Whole Foods (also a solid option, but too out-of-the-way for a 30 minute lunch break). Plant-based is the type of vegan I SHOULD be, but I more often than not catch myself eating Gardein fried \"chicken\" strips or other junk foods. Freshroll makes it super easy to eat something both delicious and nutritious. Most of the employees area really cool and they know about vegan options, which I really, genuinely, wholeheartedly appreciate.  \n\nThere's always a rather intimidating line at lunchtime on a weekday, so either go before or after the noon-time rush, or I guess order online, if you're in a hurry. I like watching my food being made in front of me, so I'll sometimes brave the ferocious queue and eat my lunch with a quickness. I guess in the end it's still fast food (wink wink, bad pun, ha ha ha). \n\nAs far as sauces go, the peanut sauce is my fave, but I also dig the sweet and sour. If you are vegan or vegetarian, do not get the vinaigrette, as it contains seafood. \n\nI am a spring roll snob, and these pass the taste test. I still think my favorite spring rolls were the ones at The Plant Cafe, although I have not eaten those ones in quite some time.

Afterward, I got to choose what type of veggies went into my rolls (note, they have pineapple as an option, which is very unique) and then I pay for my food.  \n\n tried this place out last night and really liked their garlic shrimp and lemongrass pork spring rolls.  I also ordered the crispy tofu and their chicken, but didn't enjoy them very much.  \n\nThis place is pricy for spring rolls (nearly $3/roll), but they do boast fresh and organic ingredients.  If you want to have a crispy scallion roll in your spring roll, you gotta cough up an additional 75 cents.  Also, if you order their bowl option, you can pay $1.50 more for a small side of chicken broth.  I was willing to pay for it, but they ran out by the time I got there.  SADNESS.\n\nI'd come here again, but next time I will pass on the chicken and tofu.  I'd rather pay the extra money for the garlic shrimps.  Those were quite good.", "author": "May W."}

The rolls were good and the place had a good amount of variety for your rolls.  It gets crowded during lunch time but it is worth the wait.  I liked the idea of eating these rolls for lunch.  I got three roll 2 chicken and one shrimp.  I preferred the chicken roll.  I probably needed 4 or 5 rolls because I got hungry 2 hours later.  I would come here again in a heart beat.  It is a little hard to find a table during lunch time because they are so crowded.  The service was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-23", "description": "I can tell these Chipotle-style Asian fast-food operations are starting to proliferate because the budget-conscious, assembly-line approach works for subs and burritos - so why not noodle bowls and rice paper rolls? By coincidence, I tried the nearby Bamboo Asia the other week, and that takes the same concept but goes for a contrived triple play by covering India, Japan, and Thailand. Freshroll wisely doesn't attempt a far-flung tour of the Far East. Instead, they focus strictly on Vietnam and consequently doesn't suffer from the Jack-in-the-Box syndrome of spreading itself too thin across a continent.\n\nI've been twice now - the first time by chance on their opening day, the second a couple of weeks later to see if some of the preparation jitters by the neophyte staff were ironed out. I think it's decent fare, nothing all that extraordinary and nothing that offensive, right in the middle. It's pretty easy to grasp what they're doing here once you study the menu once. You choose one of seven fillings and/or toppings (interestingly, none of them beef) - two variations on grilled chicken, another two using pork, one combo pork and chicken, one shrimp only, and one veggie option with tofu.\n\nThen you decide the vessel upon which you want them to place your ingredients - a roll trio, a super-roll, a vermicelli noodle bowl, a rice bowl, or a lettuce bowl. I went with one of the chicken choices in a lettuce bowl both times since I'm trying to watch my carb intake. I thought the grilled chicken in the Californian ($8.45) on my first visit was not as good as it was in the 49er ($7.65) on my second visit. I think the slight kick of the jalapeno and the twang of the pickled veggies were a better match than the blandness of the avocado (see photo). I also noticed an improvement in the execution on my second visit wherein the chicken was more effectively mixed with the lettuce versus simply putting the poultry on top.\n\nThis enhancement prevented a potential mess on the counter since you minimize the manual mixing needed to produce a truly integrated bowl. At the same time, I still thought the lettuce bowls were a little too light on all the secondary ingredients mentioned in the description and the sauces a bit on the watery side. Interestingly, unlike Bamboo Asia, the b\u00e1nh m\u00ecs and pho noodle bowls listed on the menu are handled separately from the assembly line. They also offer sides, extras and Vietnamese iced coffee to keep it as real as they can. Given the owner's enthusiasm in responding to customer feedback on Yelp, I look forward to seeing continued improvements in this most welcome establishment.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...decent production-line Vietnamese fast-food, fresher than you would expect\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...clean and streamlined (see photo)\nSERVICE - 3 stars..amiable enough though a bit on automatic pilot\nTOTAL - 3 stars...solid effort worth checking out over time", "author": "Ed U."}

I believe you also have the option of rice if you didn't want noodles. \n\nI will say this is a modern take on traditional Vietnamese food. Of all the asian rolls you can think of- Chinese eggrolls, Filipino lumpias, the Vietnamese spring roll is the healthiest. Fact. :D\n\nThe decor is very \"fresh and simple.\" Nothing over the top, and these days, simplicity is severely underrated. There is a big open kitchen and you can see people working and prepping in the back. It's also SUPER CLEAN and spacious. \n\nOnto food. I ordered the 3 freshrolls. You had options on protein- grilled pork, chicken, and tofu. I picked one of each. Then you get to pick your veggies- I had pineapple, lettuce, pickled veggies, and bean sprouts. They recommended the crispy stick, and that was an awesome texture to the roll. And lastly, your sauces. You had 4 options - the peanut sauce sweet and spicy chilli, citrus gingers, and the traditional Vietnamese vinaigrette.  The roll is actually pretty big, so the prices are pretty decent.\n\nI really enjoyed my rolls. It was fresh, clean, and delicious! I also had their Vietnamese limade, and I have to say, of all lemonades made in the world, the Vietnamese have it down to perfection.\n\nI would recommend everyone to come here.

As it turns out, it is 2 doors down from Chipotle, but unlike their neighbor, the spring roll assembly process is inefficient and slow, so expect a 20+ minute wait if the line reaches the door.\n\nThe idea is that they serve bowls (rice, noodles or salad) and spring rolls with your choice of toppings. The variety of veggie toppings is impressive, and surprise surprise, very fresh. They skimped on the proteins, and the proteins were average (think Sanraku from the food court.. tasty but you know what you're getting into when you order \"Bourbon Chicken\").

After that, you'll choose what carbs, protein, and greens you want. \n\nI like to get the bowls because it gets me stuffed and the fresh rolls. I usually eat my bowls with brown rice and lemongrass pork or grilled chicken.\n\nMy favorite things about this place are the pineapples they put into the meal and the Tangy Citrus Ginger sauce.

I mean ... who serves bell peppers and avocado with their spring rolls / vermicelli in Vietnamese food?!  Such a Californian thing to do, haha.  \n\nThis place offers nice healthy portions, and if you're trying to get the best bang for your buck, I'd go for the vermicelli/rice bowl. It's like Chipotle, so you can pick as you please with all your favorites and they literally have no hesitation about piling on as much as they can!  Of the meats available, the lemongrass pork was probably the best and would be my recommendation.  I also liked that they offered a tray of taro chips during lunch for people waiting in line to try.  Lightly salted and tasty!!  \n\nThe spring rolls were a bit on the expensive side though ... almost $8 for 3 rolls?!  I know they're larger than normal spring rolls, but holy jamoly.. you could buy at least 2 more spring rolls with $8 at a normal Vietnamese restaurant.  I don't think it's worth the price you're paying, but if you're feeeeeening spring rolls, I guess this will do.  The add-on crispy wonton wraps are a nice touch and it reminds me of Brodards in SoCal.\n\nI also got the lychee tea, but it was nothing too memorable.  It had more of a longan flavor than lychee flavor to me.\n\nBut overall, I think I would come back.  Not a bad lunch place and the service is super friendly!

(AK47)\n\nPerhaps the most popular is the Spring Rolls. You get 3 of these per order. They have a large white formica board on the counter, and the worker places 3 square rice paper tiles, wetted, on it to form the wrapper. (These are usually round in most Viet places, and unseen in the kitchen). Then they add your protein choice (i.e. lemongrass pork, chicken, etc) to each square, then a deli choice of veggies, and then they wrap it for you, just like Chipotle, except smaller and 3 times. \n\nI ordered the Banh Mi (pronounced Bun Me, like the other sit down Viet-Resto-For-White-People on Fillmore near California, called Bun Me, haha, I get it!). They toast your french roll and add your Puzzle Pieces to it. I went with as many authentic Viet ingredients as I could, just to get a comparison of a real Banh Mi, like form Saigon Sandwiches or Lee Sandwiches in the South Bay. \n\nBut to keep their close ties to their inspiration, Chipotle Mexican Grill, they asked if I wanted Chipotle-Aioli sauce on it? I said ok, just to try the \"fusion\" puzzle sammie.\n\nIt wasn't bad, but for $7.95 for a sandwich you can get for $3.50 in a Viet Sandwich store, it was weak. \n\nIt wasn't so bad that I left in pieces, but I did leave puzzled.  \n\nWhy pay double for assembly line Viet sammies for twice the price? \n\nI guess the nearest Viet diners are a few blocks away in the T-Loin. Actually, there is one across the street trying to serve sushi, aka Viet Diner dreams of Sushi, but it is a nightmare. \n\nOK, the rent here in the Metreon is expensive, and there are actually some Asians who stop in here, either curious, or wanting a small hint of familiar flavors and foods, and not having a lot of time to eat and think twice. \n\nBut mostly it is conventioneers from Moscone, or busy/hungry people who parked in the City lot at 5th and Mission, or Techno nerds who are used to eating puzzle food and who's employers are smaller and don't have their own kitchen, or people who work down here and have tried the dozen places in the Metreon, the dozen more in the Westfield Mall, and the dozen more close by, already, and are bored. \n\nOnce they get bored of this place, they can go next door to the original Puzzle Food....

First of all, no matter the length of your flight, food seems to be a thing of the past if you're not in first class. So, no matter the fact that the length of my trip was longer than had I flown to another continent, there was no food to be had for me on my journey from Miami to San Francisco. Add to this the paucity of delicious Asian food offerings in the Magic City and you have for one starving and pho-on-the-mind Johnny T. I knew that one of the first things I would do upon landing in the city by the bay would be to get *some* sort of Asian food delight.\n\nLuckily for me, Freshroll was near my hotel and favorably reviewed by friend and colleague. Done... and what a good idea it was. I don't know whether it's because I'd gone months without eating any sort of [fill-in-the-blank Asian ethnicity] food for nearly a year, but I was very impressed with Freshroll. Yes, it's a Vietnamese Chipotle [point of order: how awesome for Chipotle's branding that they're the default when it comes to make-your-own ethnic food?]. But don't take anything away from them. You *will* dine on delicious food. Plus, it's fun to make things up as you go along.\n\nStep one: choose your vehicle (roll, bowl, sandwich, or soup). The vermicelli noodles were calling my name. Plus, I like to slurp my lunch whenever I have a chance. Step two: protein (lemongrass pork... stop here. It's all you need to know). Step three: vegetables. If you have a hard time choosing, the standard order is lettuce, sprouts, cilantro, pineapple, cucumber, and jalapeno. Yes, ALL that. In your bowl. Because I'm a special snowflake, I settled on carrots, jalapeno, pickled veggies, scallions, cilantro, and peppers. Step four: sauce. You have the choice of peanut, ginger, sweet & sour chili, and some sort of vinaigrette. I said 'and' and not 'or.' Don't limit yourself. I settled on the first three. Just when you think you're done, there's a drink to be sipped. Be like me and suck down a jasmine tea/limeade mix. Holla!\n\nBut, wait. There's more. Make that isht a combo!! That means you get the drink AND a cup of chicken broth to go with your concoction. Add to this wondrous plate a bottle of the rooster and you are good to go. Granted, I was starving and Vietnamese food-deprived, but I tore the meal up. Despite mixing everything together, I was able to - pretty easily - pick out the various ingredients and flavor profiles.

Had a nice grilled flavor and was flavorful. The tofu was surprisingly not as bad as I thought and had lots of flavor too. The overall wrap was good and was pretty fresh. I think how good it is depends on what combination of ingredients you choose - \"everything\" seems like a good choice. There are also 4 different sauces that you can go for it. The peanut one is the best :)\n\nI also got a lychee green tea. It was pretty good - just not sweetened. \n\nOverall, a great place to get a healthy meal that you create.", "author": "Sophia Y."}

It's OK and fixes the craving, but it's nowhere near to some authentic Vietnamese dishes. \n\nI wandered in craving a bowl of vermicelli. They have all the right fixings, but it just doesn't have that taste. I got everything except the jalape\u00f1os. Vermicelli bowl with chicken, cilantro, cucumber, sprouts, romaine lettuce and pickled veggies. They have you pick what kind of sauce it comes with. One is the traditional sauce, another is peanut, another is chili and I think the last one had something to do with ginger. Anyhow- I took the traditional sauce because how better to compare to the typical vermicelli bowl?\n\nThe chicken was pretty bland. Nothing special about it. It tasted like it was stuck on the grill without anything added to it. Honestly, the only flavorful part of the dish was the sauce. But I expected it to be Chipotle-ish anyways.  \n\nOverall, this place is good for a fix and it's reasonably priced. But it's not the same as the pho hole-in-the-wall spot.

It still has it's share of challenges, but everything is trending in the right direction: \n\n- It feels like a healthy lunch (even if it isn't since I put pork on anything I order here).  The brown rice bowl fills you up and leaves you feeling pretty good about yourself at the end of the meal.  I love that they don't nickel and dime you picking which toppings you want: I just get all the veggies and call it a day.  \n\n- Don't bother with the chicken -- it's underseasoned, bland.  But did I mention the pork?  It's good, real good.\n\n- The \"vietnamese vinaigrette\" isn't very vietnamese-y.  It's mostly sugar, and could use a serious helping of fish sauce and chile to give it some flavor.  I find myself dousing my bowl with Sriracha to help things out.\n\n- The online ordering system is a great alternative to standing in line.  There's no signage about how you're supposed to pick things up: just leapfrog the line and bully your way in.  (I also don't understand why they force you to enter all your credit card info online... and then ask you to pay with your card when you actually pick it up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-26", "description": "I enjoy coming to this place to get a quick lunch or dinner because they are pretty fast with their service and I don't feel like I just ate half my daily allotment of calories. If you haven't been, it's pretty much the \"chipotle\" of vietnamese spring rolls, though you can get other things like pho or rice bowls. I think. I've never tried those, but I've heard they're good as well.\n\nA-OK? Why just ok? Well for almost $10 you get 3 rolls, which aren't small and they do contain a decent amount of your meat choice, but I could get a lot more food for the same price next door at chipotle. Oh well, it is good food nonetheless and I'd say it is worth it. \n\nTheir prices recently went up, too. Supply prices or production prices must be rising  because they changed their topping inclusions. What used to be their \"Standard\" mix of toppings has turned into their \"choose 5 toppings and we'll charge you for extra\" additions. And lettuce is included in part of your 5. Well that just decreased the variety in my roll... So on to my gripe:\n\nAlso, for only having 5 toppings they sure seem to skimp on portions. I know, you can't over stuff the rice paper or the whole roll will explode. But really, I asked for cilantro as one of my toppings, and i got about 1-3 little leafs per roll. How is this even going to add to my taste experience? In one bite I'll get a taste of freshness, and in the next, just vermicelli and lettuce. Want jalapenos? One bite of meek, mild mannered innocence and the next an onslaught of arsony on your unsuspecting mouth. Want one half of your roll to taste completely different from another bite? Well then this is perfect for you. \n\nSeriously, if you are giving me a choice of vegetables which are definitely much cheaper than the meat you are providing me with I would like a light but healthy smattering of them across the length of my roll. Not one small cilantro leaf, or two slices of jalapeno, or a single small lonely pineapple shoved into the afterthought end of my roll. I would be happier with my $10 if I got more even toppings.\n\nIn the end, though, I enjoy the taste and decent satiation from Freshroll. The biggest factor is WHO is rolling your roll. The best flavors and toppings won't hold together a roll that is exploding through its torn wrap, and much like the Chipotle burrito that an employee tried to fix with an extra tortilla your rolls will turn out sad looking and limp.", "author": "Kevin S."}

How can someone put together boiled vermicelli and some raw vegetables and make it taste so good?\nI first visited this place, as an intern, with my colleagues who were raving about it. I was largely underwhelmed because my palette at that time was used to heavily flavored food. I begrudgingly accompanied them a few more times whenever I didn't feel like choosing.\nWhen I returned as a full timer with a more mature palette I started appreciating this place better. At one point of time I couldn't get enough of it with my frequency of visits going up to four times a week. I usually get the vermicelli bowl with veggies and tofu. Here is a breakdown of the ingredients: you can choose a base, from vermicelli, white or brown rice follwed by veggies which is either a standard offering or your choice of 5 and you top this off with a choice of sauce. I usually get lettuce, cilantro, bean sprouts, pickled veggies, pineapple, crispy shallots I was wondering what makes the food taste the way it does, well, to start with you have the vermicelli which is bland and soaks up the sauce providing a good base for the rest of the ingredients to build on. Then you have the jalape\u00f1o being hot, the pineapple being sweet, the picked veggies being sour, the tofu being a little salty and the crispy shallots being a little bitter. There you go! A mix of five major tastes known to mankind. I am not sure if all of this thought went into the making of this dish but the outcome is so good and healthy. \nYou can switch the vermicelli for brown rice if you are looking for something with a low glycemic index. I have also tried their namesake, fresh rolls, which is good, but not as filling. Their banh-mi sandwich is definitely not the best I have had because I feel the tofu in a banh-mi sandwich should be a little soft and juicy as the rest of the ingredients are dry and theirs clearly is not. All in all, this is a must try if you are near the AMC Metreon, what more, you might even find me standing in the line.\n\np.s.

Found it by chance on a desperate search for food places still open late at night on a Friday when I was at the Moscone Center for a conference.\nAll I can say is that I wish there was a Freshroll in the suburbs of Seattle, because I only had it once and I've been craving it again ever since. Got a vermicelli noodle bowl with tofu and all the fixin's, and a jasmine-lychee iced tea.\n It was a little messy in there from people not bussing their rubbish or leaving food residue on the tables that wasn't really consistently being cleaned up by staff and it crowds up easily, but I'd still go back again in a heartbeat. Great flavor, good prices, just overall a great place!", "author": "Jannah M."}

They definitely seem to prepare more rolls but wouldn't mind returning to try one of the other options. \nThere was a little bit of wait when I got here during the peak lunch time but the line didn't seem to take too long.

You can jam on a close to salad-bowl like quantity of toppings on top of it and create an every-bite-is-a-different-flavor kind of situation. Pretty solid.

Chipotle style ordering really is the perfect way to describe it so I'll jump on that bandwagon.\n\nI decided to get the 3 rolls for $7.95.  When they're first making it, you'll probably think \"wow they could add a little more noodle to that\" but after they add the meat and veggies, these spring rolls become plump little suckers.  I got both the lemongrass pork and the chicken and prefer the former.  Pork pieces were more tender and flavorful.  Towards the end of when they're making it, you'll probably think \"wow they roll these things super slowly.\"   \n\nThe biggest disappointment has to be the sauces.  They're very watered down -- the peanut sauce didn't taste peanuty enough and the Vietnamese vinagrette didn't have enough fish sauce.  Hot sauce is Sriracha and luckily they don't dilute this.  What I do like is the number of vegetables you could put in your spring rolls.  The list literally keeps on going and I feel like I'm eating something healthy.", "author": "Shannon L."}

So many new places are popping up around the Metreon and we figured we'd give one of them a try! I don't usually eat Vietnamese food since I kind of just associate it with pho (which usually isn't vegetarian), but Freshroll seemed like it had veggie-friendly options. The interior was bright green, clean, and modern looking with a good amount of seating. Their concept is similar to Chipotle's where you choose the inside fillings, but here you pick whether you want it in a bowl, sandwich, or spring roll.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Crispy tofu sandwich ($6.95): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/freshroll-vietnamese-rolls-and-bowls-san-francisco?select=ZMcZKO332231gTuVUUYk-A#ZMcZKO332231gTuVUUYk-A\n- Chicken bowl + vermicelli noodles ($7.95)\n\nThe \"standard\" toppings that they recommended for my sandwich included pickled vegetables, jalapenos, cilantro, and Nam-Nam sauce (but you can also pick your own). I'm not sure what the sauce was made of exactly, but I liked it a lot! The bread was perfectly crispy and although I don't think the tofu was seasoned much, the flavor of the other ingredients more than made up for it. For a couple dollars, you can make your meal a combo and get a drink + pho broth or taro chips, which we did. The limeade was super refreshing..I'm a sucker for fizzy drinks. If you get the pho broth, you can make your own pho by dumping it into the bowl! Great for this cold winter weather.\n\nThis is a nice sit-down restaurant for a quick meal!", "author": "Jessica C."}

In fact, I need to try each of them with the first few bites of my meal in order to crown the winner and proceed move exclusively with that sauce for the remainder of the meal.\n\nAll the sauces were pretty good, but in this case, for me, I went with the factory manufactured Sri Racha for the remainder of my Lemongrass Pork Sandwich.  Only Tony the Tiger can express how great this sandwich was.", "author": "Sebastian N."}

What prompted me to finally write a review was when I recently went to pick up a lunch order for a 12:00 meeting for 10 people. We had placed our order online at around 10:30 for pickup at 11:45, well outside their requested 45-minute lead time. When we arrived at 11:45 and the staff started quizzically picking up orders that were for 1 or 2 people and looking at the labels, I knew we were in trouble. Turns out that they had received the order -- they eventually found the printout -- but hadn't bothered to make it. My coworker and I had to stand and wait for 15-20 minutes while they made our food, and not once did anyone (1) apologize, (2) let us know how much longer it would be, or (3) try to compensate by offering us a free snack or, literally, ANYTHING to demonstrate they were sorry for wasting our time. Finally we got the food and the meeting started 20 minutes late, after everyone sorted out their food and figured out how many mistakes FreshRoll had made in preparation (extra avocado requested and paid for not actually on the salad, etc.) because they were rushing. There are plenty of food options in the Metreon and nearby (as well as in the Westfield Mall food court) don't bother with FreshRoll.", "author": "Gaelen X."}

But, in dire need of food before an event I was hosting this past Saturday, I finally dropped in, looking for something a little healthier than my Super Duper burger the night before.\n\nThe process is simple enough: decide if you want spring rolls, banh mi, or a bowl; then choose your protein, veggies (including premium options), and sauces. The standard three spring rolls with basic veggie additions will run you a cool $8.63 after tax, which is a good value considering it made for a good two meals, personally.\n\nAnd while they won't blow you away flavor-wise, they're quick, convenient, healthy, and actually fairly tasty, and well worth considering if you're looking for lunch or a light dinner in the area.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A fairly new and spacious venue, the only thing that might be a minor accessibility issue are the high glass display cases, which require that you speak up a bit in order to project your voice over to the person putting your order together.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out, so I can't comment, but I imagine they're completely accessible.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Yes, I have high standards when it comes to restaurant cleanliness... but I just don't want food poisoning, and with raw food I think you need to be extra careful with your prep methods.

Normally a Vietnamese coffee MUST be made fresh from expresso before anyone pours in sweetened condensed milk. I grew up with Vietnamese coffee so I was disappointed to see that my favorite coffee was made wrong. They could have brew some french roast into individual cups and let it stand until someone orders it--that way the coffee doesn't stale with the water and the condensed milk. \nSecond, the stale coffee taste made me lose interest quickly. The added sweetened condensed milk wasn't stirred so it sat at the bottom of the cup. \nThe store could have provided thin red straws solely for Vietnamese coffee because it was meant to drink slowly in case a person gets too jittery too fast (this coffee is traditionally very caffeinated).\nI'll come back for the food, but not for the Vietnamese coffee.", "author": "Jackie T."}

As someone who can never resist ordering the salad rolls at pho restaurants, this place was a must-try for me. I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the pork and chicken options because I'm so used to having shrimp, but they actually turned out to be very delicious. The meats were much more flavorful than I had anticipated and it's great that you can pick out the ingredients for your roll. Be wary of the cilantro - it is not for the faint of heart. Personally I found it a bit overpowering so I'd probably ask for less next time.\n\nAs for the sauce, their \"Grandma's Peanut Sauce\" was spot on. It's so critical that the sauces are good because they can easily make or break the roll. I ate two sauce containers worth of this sauce because it was so yummy :)\n\nOnly reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is for the price. Although they claim that the three rolls are as filling as a bowl, I'm a little bit skeptical. The meal was a little pricey considering that I didn't feel very full afterwards. It's also an extra $2 if you want garlic shrimp to be one of your meats. The shrimp wasn't worth the extra because they were all very small and didn't have much flavor.

Because I ate at the restaurant, I took one bottle each of Sriracha and Grandma's peanut sauce to my table with me. While the food isn't bland--the sauces and the grilled chicken helped in the seasoning department--it is very plain, in that it's simple and clean, like something you'd find at Whole Foods. That's not a bad point in the least, but if you're looking for bold flavors and hot food, just know that even the sandwiches at Freshroll look more like salads than sandwiches. \n\nWas it worth the wait? I wouldn't make this a destination spot, or even a grab-and-go spot, but I would come back if I had the time to wait in line.", "author": "A.L. H."}

I ordered a bowl with vermicelli noodles, tofu, and a spread of veggies. The line upon arrival around 12:10 was pretty long but it moves fast. You choose either a sandwich, rice/noodle bowl, roll, or pho (only after 3pm though) and then add veggies on an assembly line. Basically this is the Chipotle version of Vietnamese food.\n\nPros:\n+ Very healthy - nothing was oily, the sauces were light, and veggies seemed fresh.\n+ Gluten free and vegan friendly\n+ Tofu was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of crispy outside and salt\n\nCons:\n- Kinda boring - like Chipotle this place gets the job done for lunch but overall flavor is lacking and you could definitely make the same thing at home for half the price.", "author": "Sarah S."}

It's not extremely authentic if that's what you're looking for, but then again, it's not suppose to be - it's fusion! The restaurant is set up in sort of a fast food manner (the closest thing I can think of would be like Chipotle). You have several options - noodle bowl, sandwich, or spring rolls - along with your choice of meat, made right in front of you. Prices are cheap (~$8-10) and service is extremely fast. ingredients are fresh and the condiment section is so full of everything! \n\nWhat surprises me is how healthy it is. There are both vegetarian and protein options (tofu!) and still super filling; very rare for restaurants these days. The spring rolls were delicious; my favorite part is that you can mix and match whatever meats you want! Go crazy! The sandwich is great too, stuffed to the point where it was falling out with assorted veggies and meat. I recommend the taro chips too; sound weird, tastes great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-19", "description": "Walked by this new place on the way to the movies. It's basically a Vietnamese fast casual restaurant. There are three basic types of food you can get: fresh rolls (basically an summer roll), banh mi, or noodle bowl.\n\nFor each of these, you get a choice of meat, veggie toppings, and sauce. The choices for meat was slightly disappointing - there were only 4.  Why isn't there beef? I guess pork works. Actually the lemongrass pork was pretty yummy. The veggie toppings had good variety, though I wish when they were making my banh mi, they asked if I want the other veggies that don't normally come on a banh mi, like scallions or bean sprouts. Load 'em up, I say!\n\nThe fresh rolls look pretty good. You get 3 for $7.95. They take three squares of rice paper, dunk them in water, then pile on the rice noodles, meat, then veggies. Then they roll them up right there. Next time, I'm definitely trying the fresh rolls. They look pretty filling.\n\nOverall, the food was pretty good. Great flavors and portions were pretty decent. The only major complaint I have is that the assembly line is really slow. They kinda take forever with each person. They need better training. Like for example, if one person is holding up the line because they're making the fresh rolls for a customer, the other person starting off the order can totally help finish the next order in line, instead of starting a new order. Otherwise, it kinda takes the meaning out of fast casual. But other than these little hiccups, the dining experience at Freshroll is pretty great!", "author": "Sherry L."}

Fresh rolls?\n\nFreshRoll is a modern Vietnamese-American(?) shop serving all the typical Vietnamese food items: rolls, bahn mi sandwiches, or noodle/rice bowls. Since it's nice to have something healthy and fresh, I opted to get three Freshrolls ($7.95). These are rice paper wrapped rolls with your choice of meat and veggies. I chose the lemongrass pork meat and was mesmerized watching the counter person grab a small handful of cooked rice noodles and split it amongst the three rolls. The overhead menu makes things pretty easy by highlighting a standard grouping of veggies for people who have little patience or little experience in putting things together. The good news is that you can ask for any or all the veggies they have on the menu. I really liked that! It was really odd to see slices of fresh pineapple (but hey whatever!). Personally, I would recommend getting the traditional veggies like cilantro, pickled vegetables, and for the crunch-factor adding the cucumber, bell pepper, and/or bean sprouts. At the cashier, you can get a choice of sauces to take away or there are cups to fill up with your sauce of choice in case you just can't wait to dig in.\nTwo Freshrolls was just enough to fill me up. The third roll made for a great light dinner/snack later (Tip: don't refrigerate anything in a rice paper wrapper otherwise you'll have to microwave it to unstiffen the wrap). \n\nEven though my thrifty conscience was screaming in the back of my head, \"You can get these rolls in the Tenderloin for about 2/3 of the price!\", it's nice to be able to grab some  healthy Vietnamese food from a clean shop in the neighborhood.", "author": "Joanna T."}

Bummed they've raised their prices and now only let you get five ingredients in the rolls. It now seems to be about $12 for three rolls, just with the standard five ingredients - no extras. It's actually hard to tell what the actual price is since their menu and prices are so confusing! All I know is two sets of rolls set us back $24.

Great flavors that made a party in my mouth that I didn't want to  stop :)\n\nIt's my first time at Fresh roll and decided to do their combo- 3 rolls, taro chips, jasmine tea and extra order of pho broth.   I chose the lemongrass pork and the chicken with their recommended fillings- lettuce, cilantro, cucumbers, pineapple (yes, trust me!) and all the other goodies.  They also had sauces, my fave was the citrus ginger.  The broth was well seasoned and tasty.   The homemade taro chips had the right kind of crunch and lightly salted flavor.

I really feel like you get a decent quantity of food for $7-8 and it's so damn tasty I can't help myself.  I tried the banh mi sandwich for the first time here and was pleasantly surprised that it was as filling as the rolls and the bowl.  I also tried the pho (they only serve 50 bowls and only after 3pm) and while still good, I highly recommend the other 3 options.\n\nAll the protein that you get with your meal tastes so good.  The pork is flavorful and tender, the chicken marinated very well and the even the tofu is crispy and absorbs the other ingredients very well.  The assortment of fresh veges they have is spectacular- I always get the standard and add pickled veggies.\n\nI can't believe I've written this much and haven't talked about the sauces yet.  In addition to the abundance of sriracha, the vinaigrette, peanut sauce, ginger and chili sauces wil compliment your pho, sandwich, rolls or bowl very well.  I can't help but drown whatever I have in a mix or various ones each times I'm there.  \n\nWhile I don't fee like its the most authentic Vietnamese food you can get in SF, it's reasonably priced, incredibly tasty, quick and fresh.

They use the same size wrappers so they're really not any bigger than other restaurants. The second time I came I opted for the bowl instead and with this I was pleasantly surprised.

How about streamlining the assembly line so the orders can move faster? Hire more people? Or prepare the ingredients in a way, so it'll be easier to put together?

The menu is setup very similarly to Chipotle; you choose your dish (rice, noodles, spring rolls, or sandwich), then choose your meat and fillings.  I'd say the prices are pretty similar to Chipotle's as well.  \n\nAnyways, this place is reliable, the ingredients are fresh, and the lines are always long around lunch.  I've always gotten the rice or noodle bowl, so I cannot yet vouch for the spring rolls or sandwiches  But I've never been let down.  This is the kind of place that I don't feel too guilty eating at when I'm on a health kick.  You can load your bowl up with add-on veggies and feel good about yourself.  It's a win-win. :)", "author": "Kristen F."}

I had shrimp spring rolls (aka Fresh Roll) and well, it's really fresh, which is absolutely essential.  I think the accompanying nuoc nam was on point.  I also appreciated the fact the rolls weren't stuff with an endless amount of noodles.  \n\nI also had the grilled pork banh mi.  I think the bread is where most places go wrong, but not here.  The bread is delicious, which enhances the high quality ingredients.  The pork was grilled to perfection (with some caramelization). I also like the spicy aioli sauce on the banh mi.  It's different, but it works. \n\nPlus, the taro chips are a great and healthy side.  It's tasty and novel. It has just the right amount of salt. \n\nLastly, I really enjoyed the jasmine-lychee iced tea.  I was initially skeptical.  After taking a sip, I really wish I had a gallon of it.  The iced tea is truly lightly sweetened which the subtle flavors of jasmine and lychee.  I'm going to need gallons of that from now on. \n\nI would definitely swing by more often if I could!", "author": "P L."}

Pick your style, pick your meat, pick your toppings, pick your sides.  Initially I wanted spring rolls, but ultimately decided on the noodle bowl.  The lemongrass pork is significantly better than the chicken, and I would recommend using the fish sauce to give your bowl some added flavor.

The lemongrass pork was a little tough and overcooked, but had a good lemongrass flavor to it.

A few months ago, I would have rated this higher.  \n\nThen\n-Rice bowls get stuffed with a good heap of rice and lots of meat; could barely close the lid\n-Rolls were kind of on the small side\n-Lines were medium long and wait was about 10-15 min (throughput of 1 person/30-40 sec)\n\nNow\n-Rice bowls have about 0.5-1.0 inch space from the top because they give much less rice and meat\n-Rolls seem to have a little more meat\n-Lines were medium long, but wait has become longer; 20-25 minutes (throughput of 1 person/minute+)\n\n\nUnfortunately, I'm the bowl type of guy and they seemed to have adjusted the serving size of my favorite item.  So now the value is much less.  But what killed it was the 20-25 minute wait with about 15 people in front of me.  \n\n|--Yelpers: stop reading here--|\n\n\nDid you guys become less efficient or was it just one of those days?  I stared at your assembly line, and there's always a bottleneck at the veggies and cash register section, with the rice/rice paper server running back and forth from the veggie station to help of the the traffic jam at the veggie station.\n\nRecommendation:  Beginning of Line\nAlso, I recommend you find a better way to hold your spring roll rice paper stack.  The stack was held upright in a silver tin.  The server gets her glove wet when she dips the paper in water.  However, when she goes to grab more papers, the entire stack gets wet.  As a result, the entire stack ultimately sticks together.  After 10 seconds of watching the server struggling to separate the wet stack of rice papers, I see her toss the entire thing in the garbage and. I'd say at least 10-15 of rice papers were wasted.  That's about 3-5 orders right there.  Now I know that those cost less than a dollar, but why waste if you have to?  \n\nMaybe beforehand, layout some wax paper (or any thin sheet) and place three spring roll sheets on it.  Create a big stack of these sets.  Then, when ready to use, just grab a set, lay it on your cutting board, and slide the paper off leaving the spring roll sheets on the board.  Reuse the wax paper.  This way, you don't waste any sheets and it's faster to put onto the cutting board.  Downside?  Requires preparation in advance.  But I think benefits outweigh the cost, because the savings you have from throwing away the spring roll papers probably pays for itself.  \n\nRecommendation: Middle Part of Line\nAlso, you have to fix the veggie station.  It's just not working.  The problem I see is that a customer sticks with a single server, who is responsible for grabbing all the veggies and custom making that order.  The problem is that brings variance where one customer will almost always take a different amount of time than the other, so you get a traffic jam that just builds up.  \n\nWhat you need to do is copy Chipotle.  No, you are not doing what Chipotle is.  There's a key difference.  In Chipotle, the server is responsible for his area of ingredients, not for sticking with the customer.  If you really think about it, each guy does one section of ingredients, whether it's the bean section or the salsa section or the lettuce/guac section and passes it on.  I suggest that you rearrange your veggie station and don't duplicate it into two.  Have one section where the veggies are arranged in a row.  \n\nFor example, have heavier/larger items such as cucumber, lettuce, pineapple at the beginning.   Then have the end of section as garnishes to put on top.  Have one server responsible for this first half, and then have her pass it on to the next server to fill out  the rest of the order.  Traffic jam?  Whoever is less busy, just help the other.   Right now, the two servers are jumping over one another and sticking with the same customer through the line.  \n\n\nRecommendation: End of Line\nIt baffles me that with all the jamming in the veggie station, that there's another jam at the cash register.  That, I can't figure out.  I was probably too annoyed by the wait to pay attention to what's going on.  You guys use Square, which should be fast.  So I don't know you're jammed up here.  I think you guys print out a receipt and require us to sign?  Why not just skip that part?  Lots of other places ask the customer for a receipt and the response is almost always no.  This saves a ton of time. \n\n\nWhew.  This review will probably go unread, but at least I'm trying to be constructive here, which is more than I can say about many other Yelpers.  Put back your sign that says 'please be patient as we're still learning' and try adjusting.  Also, please put more ingredients in your bowls.", "author": "Jon K."}

Good thing she did, because I definitely didn't!  She even suggested the Crispy Goodness, which really is just that - pure crispy goodness if you like a little crunch in your bite.\n\nThe pork was very flavorful and moist.  I highly recommend the Crispy Goodness and the pineapple (included in the standard) really adds another dimension to the roll.  Going with the standard fixings was a great combo/ratio of tastes and textures. I got the iced tea to accompany it which I enjoyed more than the coffee (what can I say, I'm a southern girl).\n\nOverall, a great experience.

Four sources of protein are offered, but then there's a lot of options for toppings (sauces, veggies, fresh herbs, even some types of fruit!) You can also pick out some sides such as chips, veggies or broth. Everything is freshly made in front of you.\n\nWhat else can I say about this place other than *it's delicious*? I ordered the crispy tofu on a sandwich with standard toppings, and I was seriously ecstatic about the taste. I've never had tofu on a sandwich taste good until today, and I'd be more than happy to get this in rolls as well.

I first met the owner of Freshroll in 2007 when we worked together in finance, and from the beginning his game plan was to open a Vietnamese restaurant. He never deviated from that game plan, and in 2012 is living out his dream.\n\nHaving traveled throughout Vietnam a few years ago, I can safely say the best Vietnamese food is in the centrally-located city of Hue. Not surprising given the quality of Freshroll's offering, the owner's family is from Hue, Vietnam.\n\nI wanted to get a good sampling and so I got both the pork sandwich as well as shrimp fresh roll (also known as \"goi guon\"). The pork sandwich was absolutely fantastic; one of the best Vietnamese sandwiches I've ever had and without a shadow of a doubt the best I've had in the US. I wasn't as much of a fan of the freshroll, but I think that would be a bi-product of: 1) I'm a goi guon snob and my bar is extremely high, and 2) I had just had the sandwich and there existed a psychological diminishing marginal returns factor, and it was tough to maintain that level of satisfaction the sando gave me.\n\nNet-net, Freshroll is a place an excellent Vietnamese lunch that someone can get at a reasonable price. I'd recommend showing up either early (11:30) or late (2:00) because the line will get fairly long fairly quickly.", "author": "William R."}

Due to the ability to customize your order, you can fine tune your choices and get the exact taste you are looking for.\n\nMy go to choice is the 3 Rolls with Chicken and Pork. I like spicy foods, so I double down on extra fresh jalapenos and siracha.  The 3 rolls option is just enough food to keep you satisfied, but not so much that it makes you feel like you've crushed a burrito gut bomb before heading back to your desk for a snoozy food coma at the office.\n\nOne big gripe is the line can get long and Freshroll hasn't perfected their operational efficiency and needs to really get faster at making the rolls.

I love that it's pretty straight forward and they give you all the options of sandwich, bowl , or salad. They also have meat and veggie options. They offered Spring rolls but didn't try it and had a bowl of the lemongrass pork. (ooh so yummy)\n\nPros:\nI love that you can see them make it in front of you. You can tell them to do more/less of the veggies. Try the pickled Veggies. Those have lots of flavor! The taste is better than most places similar to here.  Also, I love that they have a variety of sauces you can use to add additional flavor to your meal. \n\nCons:\nIf you're a commuter, it's easy to get to by Bart/Muni/walk. However if you drive, parking is $$ since there's only really the 5th/mission garage and not much street parking. Also if you have a big group, there may not always be enough seats.", "author": "Phillip D."}

Sauces. Sauces. I think the peanut sauce is a family recipe; but my favorite was a fresh and zesty citrus ginger dipping sauce. Tart and sweet; I always opt for peanut when I'm dipping my rolls, but I think I became a convert after this one sauce.\n\nI personally really love Vietnamese food myself because the flavor palate is tart, contrasting, fresh and light. I really like Freshroll because they creatively take these themes and make it really accessible and \"handy\" - they roll it up in rice paper; or stuff it into a sandwich, or pack it into a bowl.

What more could you ask for?\nWas looking for something healthy-esque in the SOMA area. Yelp tells me there are rolls & bowls a few blocks away. Yelp tells me this place has a 4.5 star average. So off we go! \n\nThe setup and ordering process reminds me of Chipotle, but like Chipotle's shiny little Vietnamese cousin. Anyway, so we got: \n- 3 freshrolls, with chicken, pork, tofu (pretty good, very filling)\n- 1 freshroll sandwich, with pork (so very tasty!)\n- 1 bowl, with brown rice & tofu (a bit bland, so I added diff sauces = yum!)\n- 1 Jasmine ice tea (wonderfully refreshing)\nTotal came out to about $26. \n\nWith each option you choose a meat/filling: pork, chicken, tofu, shrimp (may cost extra for shrimp). The pork and chicken are tasty. The tofu needed more flavor, so I  added sauces which makes it much better. I did not try the shrimp. With the bowl, you also choose rice, noodle, or salad. \n\nThen you add some garnish stuff: sprouts, lettuce, peppers, pineapple, light vegetables, spices, etc. There is a lot to choose from or they suggest \"the standard\" - which is their suggested combo of garnish. A couple of my personal faves were the pineapple and pickled vegetables.\nWARNING: Be careful about getting hot peppers added - they are HOT! It came as part of \"the standard\" and I wasn't really aware of how hot they could be. And if it is in a roll and it sneaks up on you, then KA-POW! Call 911! Your mouth is on fire! Seriously, this stuff can get hot. So be careful.\n\nFinally, you can add extras like soup, taro chips, etc. I got their Jasmine ice tea which was very refreshing and lightly sweetened. Also, they have several sauces you can try like ginger, sweet & sour, peanut - all are very good. I recommend trying them with your meal.\n\nLocation is on 4th, outside the newly remodeled Metreon structure. Bright and white inside. A few little signs on the counters that say something like, hey we are new and trying so please be patient with us - which I appreciate that they're just honest about that. Very friendly service!

I just snacked on the very last one a few hours after eating the first two. The chicken rolls are far better in my opinion, but I'm very partial to chicken over other meat. The pork just tasted a little dry and had less flavor. The chicken was tender and very good. I think my favorite part is that they let you get as much/many sauces as you want. They also have sriracha, which is close to my best friend when it comes to sauces. I'm a big sauce fan, so to be able to take as much as I needed was excellent. \n\nI really want to try their pho, but not sure I'll be able to during the week.

I'm half vietnamese and have never seen a place try to appeal to a massive non-vietnamese crowd the way that Freshroll does.  They appeared to be somewhat newly opened and were quick to offer simple explanations of the ingredients and offerings.  It was obvious they were used to doing so.  They take a Chipotle approach to their business in that you choose what you want (roll, boll; etc) and they make it in front of you as you choose the type of meat and stuffings.  I had 3 different types of rolls there (there were 4 different types of meat to choose) and loved all of them and ended up coming back there 3-4 times during the week I was in San Fran.  This place is quick, cheap, and very clean.  \n\nThe only item I didn't like as much was their vietnamese coffee.  Vietnamese coffee can be hard to make in large batches and the version they had was somewhat dumbed down for a non-vietnamese pallette.  All in all it lacked the chickory and strong concentrated taste that is a signature of vietnamese coffee.  They noticed we didn't like it and asked why and were very apologetic about it.  Still a very good experience.  I recommended this place to one of my coworkers there with me on the trip and they loved it having never tried vietnamese wraps before.  \n\nDefinitely worth checking out.", "author": "Michael L."}

You select your meat, and you have the option of rolls, sandwich, rice bowl, or pho. I got the rolls with the pork, and taro chips.

And I actually enjoyed it a lot and thought the quality of their fresh rolls was kind of high for a fast food type of Vietnamese joint. But I was starting to notice a slow decline in quality of the food and the energy of the employees during my last few visits. I finally came back after about a two month absence and found myself extremely disappointed in my meal. It wasn't quite the same - the \"zing\" in their rolls that I used to get on the first, second or third bite seemed absent now. And the vermicelli bowl just disappointed me even more. It was all just plain bland, bland, bland. Where I once found the chicken and pork to be cooked well (texture-wise) with lots of flavour i thought was now slightly tough, overcooked and lacking taste. Plus the vermicelli tasted a bit mushy too and seemed like it had been sitting out too long. \n\nAnd gosh it's expensive here. I guess I must have ignored it before and a disappointing dinner makes you think about how much you just paid. $20+ change for 3 rolls and a vermicelli bowl?? What was I thinking! Overall I'm not sure if I'll be coming here as often as I used to. I think the high traffic coming from the convention goers has finally turned them into an assembly line where quality takes a back seat to profit.", "author": "Mercy D."}

I will say that at first glance, it's slightly pricier than your average spring roll and at first, I felt like the portion sizes were a little on the smaller size (you get 3 large spring rolls but it was a little light on the meat).

The sandwiches here aren't terrible or bad, they just aren't worth the seven dollar price tag. I can get a bigger and tastier Vietnamese sandwich a couple blocks down on Larkin Street for a mere $3.50. \n\nPros:\nThe Taro Chips were tasty and light. They also only cost two bucks.\nThe Iced Tea is lightly sweetened yet refreshing. It's also only two bucks.\nGreat customer service and super friendly people who are willing to take questions and give food recommendations.\nThey have fresh cucumber water and samples of the taro chips for customers to try for free.\nDifferent sauces to choose from.\n\nCons:\nSmall portion size for a sandwich that costs seven dollars.\nA little overpriced for street food with the exception of the chips and iced tea.\nSandwich wasn't mind-blowingly amazing, just okay and filling. For seven dollars, I'm expecting more.\n\nA good option for people who want a healthy, light meal.

BUT, why is it that for the few times that I have been here, the person who rings me at the register, always pisses me off.  It's never even the same person. The first time, all I did was ask for a tray, because I got a combo meal. I couldn't hold it all in my hands. But when I asked the guy at the register, he looked really annoyed and said \"No we don't do that here.\" Was it really that dumb of a question? It's fine if you don't have trays, but don't give me attitude about that. Another time, I told the girl at the register, I wanted my food to go. The girl at the register thought I said \"for here\". Then here comes another annoyed look. It almost seemed like it was too difficult for her to cover my fresh roll box with a plastic cover? So here I am again, struggling to hold a combo meal, but this time I'm taking it to go. And it wasn't until I already put my food in my own reusuable grocery bag, that she asked if I needed a bag. SO THOUGHTFUL. It almost seems like the people at the register are miserable. I don't want to eat food, knowing that people who serviced it to me appear to be miserable.

But now, compared to the rolls they make at Freshroll, the Slanted Door ones are like poo poo. That's right, I said it. They're like turd logs. Freshroll is giving Charles Phan a run for his money. \n\nA couple of girlfriends joined me here for dinner last Friday and we were all blow away. The ingredients were super fresh. We ordered chicken and pork (really tender w/ lots of flavor) in our rolls and tried all the different dipping sauces. The sauces were good individually, but when you get all of them and mix em up together, the combination of the flavors will blow your mind. The crispy goodness (fried, crispy green onion), DAMN! My mouth is starting to water just thinking about it. And the jasmine lychee iced tea - LAWD HAVE MERCY!!! It is the perfect blend of floral and fruit, with just a hint of sweetness. If you're like me, someone who can't stand artificially flavored super sweet drinks, then this beverage is for you. It's probably one of the best iced tea beverages I have ever tasted. And the customer service was superb. We were somewhat indecisive about what to order (everything looked so good) and the owner was really helpful and patient in helping us through the selection process. Everyone else was incredibly friendly. Can't wait to bring my mom here for lunch this week! I will definitely be a regular.\n\nNB: I have VERY discerning taste buds.

I am so glad I gave their pho a shot.  The best part has to be the broth.  It is clearly made from scratch, you can smell the chicken and spices - it is so aromatic and flavorful.  The noodles are thin and the portion of beef is very generous, and thinly sliced so that it cooks perfectly in the hot broth.  I have had the beef pho two days in a row now and will keep Freshroll on my \"go to\" list when I need some good soup.", "author": "Christina P."}

The rolls and sauces have always been tasty since the beginning, but the rolls now don't fall apart super easily anymore, and the staff seems friendlier and more trained.  Sometimes the line is out the door during lunchtime when there is a conference going on across the street at the Moscone Center, but hey, that 15-20 minute wait is worth it for my spring roll craving!

I have frequented this place about 3 times since opening and I love it.  its clean, trendy, and hightech, but enough chit chat on to the food! \n\nThe Freshroll w/ shrimp and kah runch style is my fave.  I would also recommend the Citrus sauce (a cooler version of nuoc nam).  It is pretty cool that you can get the Freshroll made to your specifications, the assembly line reminded me of a sandwhich shop, but Vietnamese.  Also, Kah runch style is when they roll a small spring roll type thing into the summer roll, it makes for a pretty neat texture profile.\n\nIf you want something even more filling than the Freshrolls i would recommend the noodle bowls.  They definitely don't skimp on the meat and one order of these bowls will certainly fill your belly.  I'd recommend extra preserved veggies if you do order this.\n\nLast but not least the banh mi.  These banh mi are definitely some of the best i have had in the city.  Buns are grilled on the inside like an in and out burger bun, which provides a really nice crisp.  Lots of meat and the special sauce is awesome.  I'd recommend adding jalapenos for some kick, but hey I like my food spicy.  I also like getting the special sauce on the side because dipping the sandwich into the sauce makes for an awesome experience.  The special sauce reminds me of a spicy thousand island dressing but thinner and without the relish.  Super tasty.", "author": "Steve T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-12-29", "description": "I have had several recent experiences that have compelled me to post an updated review. I was originally a big fan of this place. But for those of us who ate here when it opened the change for the worse is noticeable.\n\nWhy it is worse.\n\n1. The staff. In my last 3 visits the staff has been, at best indifferent, if not unpleasant. In particular, one team member who rang up 2 of my last 3 visits didn't even say hi. She just said \"2 fresh rolls and a chicken bowl. Any thing else?\" \n\nWell I should be more complete. She did say one other thing on one of my visits. I'll get to that as I comment on the second issue.\n\n2. The portions. In particular the Chicken bowls are now a joke. They now \"measure\" the rice. However, the staff never actually fills the measuring  bowl. They use it as a scoop. Invariably I have noticed they fill the bowl about half way and then have a little extra coming over the top of the 'scoop' and they dump that into the serving bowl. \n\nThis ties back to my comment about being more complete in item 1. 3 visits back, when they prepped the bowl, I noticed I could easily see the bottom of the bowl and I asked if they could add a little extra rice. The prep guy did that without blinking. \n\nAs I got to the register, the less than friendly person mentioned above, not only said \"2 fresh rolls and a chicken bowl\", she proceeded to say \"... and 1 dollar for a side of rice\". I said I didn't get a side of rice and she looked at me and said it was for the extra rice I got in the bowl. I snapped back... and I admit I 'snapped' back, because I was already irritated at this point that the initial portion was so small and she had already been less the courteous prior to her comment. I told her I have never had that happen before. She proceeded to tell me it was policy and she needed a manager. But she couldn't find one so she didn't charge the dollar but told me again it was policy. And the whole time she just kept making faces.\n\nSo lets review all the problems with this scenario. I) I would not have asked if the serving weren't so ridiculously small to begin with. II) If you have a policy to charge people for a full side of rice when they ask for a little extra rice then warn them in advance. III) Don't try to make excuses especially if you plan on removing the charge anyway. Just say 'sorry that was not mentioned when you made the request. I will of course not charge you. But for future reference....'\n\nBut frankly the larger issue is the tiny portion to begin with. \n\nI went tonight, which will be my last time for awhile, and they not only still did the tiny rice serving thing, they put a really small amount of chicken (not even a full level spoonful of that). There was at least a full inch between the top of the chicken and the top of the bowl. But to add insult to injury, if you look at the photos the bowls are filled to the top.\n\nFrankly I can go to Sorobol, pay 1$ more than what Freshroll charges and get enough chicken and rice to feed both of my kids and have leftovers. But I cannot even come close to saying the same for what Freshroll is serving. And at Sorobol they are always friendly. \n\nI am just disappointed with how this place has changed.\n\nThe only thing that it has going for it is that the food is still tasty. \n\nBut truthfully, tasty food doesn't really make up for poor customer service and cover for that feeling that you are being taken. \n\nThat business model works for their primary customer, transient convention goers. But we locals expect more! \n\nNot sure if the restaurant today really reflects the owner's aspirations. I recall talking with him when he first opened and I don't think the place today lives up to his vision.. but people change and his restaurant sure did too.", "author": "Alan B."}

First I have to say, the place is really clean and modern. Two adjectives I don't normally use to describe a Vietnamese restaurant. They have a nice layout, clean white lines and an open kitchen. Doesn't look like much is going on back there, as most of the food is pre prepped and ready to roll a la chipotle style. 8 dollars will get you a combo of 3 rolls ranging from tofu, bbq pork, lemon grass chicken, or garlic shrimp. Pick your toppings and sauces and you're all set. Eating here I've come to realize Vietnamese makes a perfect lunch time meal cause its light, healthy, and won't make you feel tired afterwards.

Their rolls are far from being fresh.\n \nThe vegetables are tasteless and semi-mushy - I  suspect they are GMOs and not organic. \n\nI ordered two rolls with chicken and one roll with shrimp. The chicken was blend and to my surprise I found a piece of cartilage in one of the rolls. Although the shrimp roll was a notch better, it tasted more like water down ceviche than a traditional Vietnamese shrimp. \n\nThis is Vietnamese food banalized to people that have no palate or any knowledge what a Vietnamese cuisine is supposed to be. There is nothing fresh or Vietamese about it. The owners should change the name to 49rs Roll - it cater well to that particular kind of customer, they even have a dish named after them. \n\nThis place is an insult to the Vietnamese culture.", "author": "Marcello C."}

Don't forget to get the crunchy green onion stuff because it really makes a big difference in your roll.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not really a spring roll guy.  Probably because most places that offer spring rolls are in the TL and you don't really associate those restaurants with \"clean & healthy.\"  Don't get me wrong; I like my sketchy hole-in-the-walls but maybe not every day (and certainly not when I'm in a lunch rush).\n\nThe staff was really friendly.

We got super hungry and after hitting up Bloomingdales, walked to the Metreon and found this new Vietnamese place called Freshroll. I'm actually super excited a place like this opened up in SF because I am Vietnamese and from Orange County ( the best Viet food in the world) so there is a lack of good viet places to eat in the city and also I have super high standards for Viet food. I've never been to a place like it, it's like the Chiptotle concept where you put fresh meats and veggies in a rice paper and you dip in one of their many sauces. I think I ordered the 49-er roll I don't quite remember the name but it was the one with chicken. You can customize it so I substituted the  jalape\u00f1o for the tofu. Alls I got to say is that it was sooo delicious!! The rolls were big, tasty, super fresh, and the meat and sauce were very flavorful. It's the perfect low carb meal ( if u ask for no noodles)  but super satisfying at the same time. They have banh mi ( Vietnamese sandwich) on the menu also and I saw pho which I'd like to try next time. Prices were pretty cheap too, I got 3 fat rolls and it was like 7 bucks and I had 1.5 rolls left for later. I'm still thinking about the rolls a day after eating them because they were sooooo yummy but couldn't go again today because I had dinner plans in Palo Alto.

That meant eating out at lunch. Freshroll was about 2 blocks away, so I decided to give them a shot. Had the 3 spring rolls for $7.95, the taro chips for $1.95, and the limeade for $1.95. So definitely more than what I usually spend on Vietnamese food, but still awesomely delicious. The spring rolls were rolled tightly, and you could taste the freshness of the pork and the shrimp. Definitely get the taro chips, they were just the right blend of sweet and oily(probably still healthier than regular potato chips.)

The veggies tasted supremely fresh and crunchy, with big, real leaves of deep green lettuce - not that shredded Iceberg you get at Chipotle. \n\nThe ordering experience is seamless and easy, and the price is fair for what you get. I went with the spring rolls option, their recommended choice, with the standard fixins - sprouts, cucumbers, pineapple, jalepenos (love that they include those in the standard), and added pickled carrots to boot. Gotta take advantage of the unlimited veggie toppings...\n\nThe end result was an incredibly fresh-tasting set of three Vietnamese spring rolls on steroids. I was pleasantly full after eating two of the three, and am looking at the third sitting on my desk next and eagerly awaiting eating it as my mid-afternoon snack.\n\nThis is a delicious, fresh-tasting and healthy lunch option if you're in SOMA, and I highly recommend it.

Therefore, it's great that an order of the fresh rolls come with 3 rolls and you can choose to have different meat and toppings on each one so that you're not limited to eating three of the same thing. Most (by most, I mean all) spring rolls I've had before are usually stuffed with 90% noodles, one lettuce, and a shrimp cut in half. The rolls here are stuffed with meat, probably about 10-15% noodle and the rest is filled with fresh veggies, carrots, optional toppings such as jalapenos for that extra kick, pineapple, etc. The meat is very tasty and flavorfull. I think my favorite is the lemongrass pork with the 49er? topping (the one with the jalapenos).

We got super hungry and after hitting up Bloomingdales, walked to the Metreon and found this new Vietnamese place called Freshroll. I'm actually super excited a place like this opened up in SF because I am Vietnamese and from Orange County ( the best Viet food in the world) so there is a lack of good viet places to eat in the city and also I have super high standards for Viet food. I think I ordered the 49-er roll I don't quite remember the name but it was the one with chicken. You can customize it so I substituted the  jalape\u00f1o for the tofu. Alls I got to say is that it was sooo delicious!! The rolls were big, tasty, super fresh, and the meat and sauce were very flavorful. It's the perfect low carb meal ( hold the noodles)  but super satisfying at the same time. They also have banh mi ( Vietnamese sandwich)  and pho which I'd like to try next time. Prices were pretty cheap too, I got 3 fat rolls and it was like 7 bucks and I had 1.5 rolls left for later. I'm actually going to be call Freshroll on my way home from work so I can pick up some dinner tonight. YUMMMMS!!", "author": "Maria D."}

You have to crawl over the people in line to get your sauces and to the trash can.  The food is very good.  My main gripe is that they just can't handle a lunch rush.  You could see the people behind the counter struggling with getting the bread toasted and rolls takes a very long time to make.  What should have been a quick lunch took almost 40 min. from line to finish.  I will try this again, but only if it isn't busy.", "author": "Michael S."}

Topped with pork and the \"traditional Vietnamese\" toppings is the way to do. The vinaigrette sauce is the perfect compliment, and I barely used half of the dressing.  Pretty good spot for $9.

I still need to try out their bowls and bahn mi, but the quality of the ingredients and the level of service (even chatted with the owner a little and everyone was asking for feedback) definitely makes me want to revisit.

I came in eagerly into the store at 8:35 hoping to order a b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwich.  As soon as I walked in, the clerk at the counter said that they were closed. I left wondering why they were not following their own time schedule given that they were supposed to be open until 9 PM. I then went to chipotle and order a nice burrito bowl. I made it back to my hotel room and wrote this review while they were technically still supposed to be open. Sad they lost a customer because they were lazy and closed early.", "author": "Vasanth S."}

I'm a huge fan of Vietnamese spring rolls and already knew that I'd be ordering some kind of roll.  Being able to create your own roll and add your personally favorite ingredients is genius!  They also have set veggie combinations you can try with your meat.  I opted for the shrimp roll with \"Californian\" veggie combination which came with avocado, cucumbers and sprouts.  The rolls also already include vermicelli noodles.  In addition to the rolls, you get a choice of sauce.  The menu suggested \"Citrus Ginger\" with the \"Californian\" so I decided to try it but also ordered a peanut sauce because that's always my favorite.  I'm not a big fan of ginger, but the Citrus Ginger sauce was pretty amazing and the ginger wasn't overpowering at all.  You can never go wrong with the peanut sauce :).\n\nEach order of rolls come with 3 rolls.  At first, I didn't think this would be enough food.  I order spring rolls at pho restaurants all the time as an appetizer and can usually eat spring rolls and half of my bowl of pho.  These Freshrolls, however, are bigger than your ordinary spring rolls and I was full after my second roll.  \n\nMy fiance chose to order a rice bowl with chicken which he said was pretty good.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful and he finished the entire bowl.\n\nI think the easiest way to explain Freshroll is that it's the delicious and a much healthier version of a Chipotle (ironically, there will be a Chipotle opening soon next door).  I'll definitely be coming back here to try their other variations.  I also want to try their Vietnamese Sandwich, which I hear is pretty amazing.", "author": "Monique C."}

You can tell service and food quality are high priorities.  My wife and I bought 2 orders of rolls, both including chicken and pork - yes, both awesome. Food was extremely fresh, filling, and we both left feeling light and healthy on our night on the town.  It's worth the short stroll for folks in the FiDi for lunch, quick and healthy for movie goers, and perfect for out-of-towners here on conventions.  Will be coming back soon!", "author": "nick h."}

It's quick, streamlined, and the food is filling which I didn't expect.  I talked to the owner who told me they just opened a few weeks ago.

Its the Chipotle of americanized vietnamese food. If you're not in a crunch, the tenderloin has far better options to get your spring roll fix (or banh mi or pho) but I do like the fresh ingredients here.

Unfortunately, the service needs a lot of work so my coworkers and I will NOT be returning.  Too bad as we work in the neighborhood with the public.  The cashier, who appeared to also be a shift manager (or at least bossy with the others) has no customer service ability or knowledge of her pricing/product. She tried to grossly overcharge me, but then when I said I would change my order or walk away,  wink-wink she said she would give me the price I was asking for - which is the price I should have been charged in the first place.  She blamed it on the owners pricing structure and not her own confusion.   She didn't seem to have great bandwidth, and when I tried to explain to her (in a nice tone with the best intentions) how I thought she had misunderstood the owners' pricing, she got very nasty.   Not a good start.\n\nI would come back for the food, but unfortunately, as most restauranteurs know, bad service can chase away customers .  I am one of those.", "author": "sweaterhead x."}

Pineapple is a great add-on for the sandwiches.\n3.  You do NOT need the nam nam sauce for your sandwich.  they sorta assume everyone should have it, and they will put it on unless you tell them no.  There are other sauces, such as vietnamese vinegarette, that go better with the sandwich.  Bottom line:  save yourself the extra empty calories from the mayo-based nam nam sauce. \n4.  show up slightly off hours like after 2pm to avoid lines which can extend through the place out the door.  when we go in at 230-3 on saturday we do not have a long wait.  \n\ni have been in several times, and the owner is meticulous in providing a positive experience.", "author": "eshwar k."}

Most of these new roll places (sushirrito, Spice kit, u-sushi) simply don't have the variety to be able to eat there on a regular basis.

When I want a healthier lunch option this will be my go to place.  As a vegetarian, I can't comment on the meat, but I will say that the tofu is lack luster ( which is why i docked a star).  The first time I went, I ended up pulling it out of the rolls.  Now I skip the protein and load up on veggies.  I have tried all of the sauces and I think my favorites are citrus ginger and the chili one.  I'm addicted to the taro chips.  I have found the service really friendly, but I have never come during the lunch rush ( I have walked by and it seemed chaotic) I come for late lunch or to bring home dinner.  Some people have commented on the lack of Vietnamese authenticity, but I think the restaurant is trying to put a California twist on the Vietnamese roll, which I enjoy.", "author": "Whatsnext M."}

Sadly, the balance of ingredients was way off -- almost no noodles (come one, those noodles cost next to nothing), which left each roll about 1/3 the size of a real goi cuon.

Has a very basic menu with 3 choices of styles (spring roll, a bowl of noodle or a bahn-mi sandwich).and a variety of ingredients/filling.  I went for the noodle.  The flavor is very fresh and light, nothing greasy.  An addition of a variety of sauces adds different dimensions to the fresh flavor.  What set them apart for me is the friendly employees and the manager who greets everyone and made sure everyone was great.  Now this is unheard of in a fast food joint but it's very refreshing.  Keep giving out good food and great service and this place will be above the rest.", "author": "Tabp F."}
