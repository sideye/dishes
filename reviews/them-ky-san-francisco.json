As a food destination, SF has really become quite bifurcated between cheap ethnic places and expensive fine dining establishments. \n\nAs much as I enjoy the experience at a Michelin-starred restaurant, sometimes I just want to eat some deep fried fish with some white rice and eat with my hands. This place probably serves the most inexpensive and still good quality deep fried fish (Tilapia for $9, Pompano for $10) in all of SF.  The service is OK but it can get quite loud. There's a lot of great ethnic places in the area but this restaurant holds its own.  Note that they accept cash only.", "author": "Andrew S."}

The food is nothing wow but acceptable. It has like a classic comfort kind of food mix chinese Vietnamese cuisine. I've always loved their pancake(rice cake) with eggs which I always ask for extra egg. A very close person of mine (rip) introduce it to me during my high school years and it has been and will always be our favorite. Service isn't perfect to others expectations but I've always had great service so I'm happy. This place you can say has a history with me growing up along with those who grew up in TL.

So, we made our way to the TL, putting our lives in danger, in the name of good food!\n\nThe concept of \"the dirtier a place, the better tasting it is\" applies here. Also, since it's cash only, you know they're hustling! That's just more justification why this place is authentically delicious.\n\nWe got the catfish in a stone pot, some sour soup, and the taro pancakes with egg. Everything was pretty tasty. I like how they have pictures of everything on the walls. Service is typical Vietnamese restaurant where they pretty much take your order, deliver the food, and you don't see anyone again.\n\nAnyway, great place for some amazing Vietnamese food in the TL!", "author": "Marlon T."}

The people and workers are much friendlier and efficient. More importantly, they did not call me, \"Sir\". \n\nI was here for dinner. I had #84; Five-spiced chicken with shredded pork and an egg mixture over rice. For $9.00, the hefty portion was just the right amount and cooked to perfection. The grilled chicken is very moist and not too arid. \n\nI also ordered a colorful jelly drink with my meal. For $3.50, I get a concoction mixture of colorful jelly and beans in creamy sweet milk.

I like the option of having it \"dry' style so that I can add as much liquid as I feel like.  one time it was super good but sometimes it's hit or miss.  The sauce was amazing but they lose one star b/c I like consistency and it's not exactly consistent here.  The Cha Gio/spring roll wrapped in a soft wrap is good, but they used to have another type here that was better imo. \n\nThey have a Chinese pancake here; I think Shanghainese style & it's very good with the sauce. I highly recommend it, but sometimes it's very burnt.  So i'd check it first personally, especially if you plan to take it to go.  \n\nIt scares me that their cleanliness or food safety is 57/100 what really??!! It's posted on yelp but I'm not sure how accurate, anyone saw a sign there?  And negative that they DO NOT accept credit cards.  \n\nHowever, yes of all the negativity I would still come here due to the fact that I notice they give free food to some neighborhood hobos that peep in to ask for just rice or noodles and I think the bum is a regular?  That type of act of kindness makes me feel like I'm doing something good by just eating here.  This is part of the business ethics so personally I think it deserves to be in the review.

I came here for lunch with a coworker and we shared the taro cake appetizer place and Ariel ordered the combination beef parts pho (don't know how else to call it, but it has beef balls, stewed beef, tendon and sirloin) and I had the beef stew pho. \n\nThe taro cake is en pointe. I love taro and the egg batter isn't oily at all. The little bits of peanuts and pickled daikon added crunch and a bit of salty/sweet to the dish. The fresh scallions added a freshness element. I think it's a must order.\n\nThe stewed beef pho is also great. The meat and tendons are cooked down and the stew is so flavorful. My only complaint is that the rice noodles are slightly overcooked and could be a bit more chewy, but that's a minor complaint.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place.

If and when I would though, Them Ky was usually my go-to choice - solid food, reasonable prices, and plenty of seating.  So while it's great that two of the three are still true, the most important one (the food) is nothing like I remember.\n\nAs my friend and I flipped through the menu, it looked as though a handful of items had been added since my last trip.  Since it's been a couple of years though, I can't say for sure.  Regardless, I stuck with two of my usual orders at Them Ky - Beef Pho with Rare Steak and Well Done Flank (Tai Chin?) and a BBQ Pork Banh Mi to take back home.  \n\nWhile the noodles and rare steak in the pho were fine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/them-ky-san-francisco?select=lB5No76lFJslYC81aTd5eg#0JF_dZVeHjDpoqdoPH41jQ), I thought the flank was a bit tough and that the broth was a little funky.  I can't really describe it, but rather than a rich and savory flavor, it tasted somewhat fragrant to me.  Perhaps it was just one bad mix of seasonings (or the spoon they gave me that smelled like bleach), but it didn't seem that way before.  Although it was edible, I admit I added a decent amount of sriracha and plum sauce to cover it up.\n\nAs for the banh mi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/them-ky-san-francisco?select=lB5No76lFJslYC81aTd5eg#YupN36mDq86flORUBkhp8w), it's still pretty decent, but I remember liking it more before than I do now.  I don't know if it's my preferences that have changed or the rolls that they use, but I wish the bread was a little lighter.  Again, that's just what I prefer though; otherwise, it's still a pretty good sandwich and the meat still nicely seasoned and flavorful.\n\nI'm sure at some point I'll be back in the TL again for another bowl of pho, but I'll probably look to try a couple of other places before I come back to Them Ky again.\n\nCASH ONLY.", "author": "Mike L."}

It's that creeping feeling you have when you step into a family-run restaurant that looks rather run down with the slightly faded photos of their specialty dishes on the wall, but you feel like you committed yourself because you're the only one in the place about to eat their food. Your conscience overrides any health concerns you are about to face by sitting down and ordering something off their menu.\n\nAfter all, what's so bad about a stomach pump when you're helping a business survive for another day? Them Ky is not quite that bleak. There appears to be a stream of regulars who come here and trade bon mots with the ladies who run the joint. The food didn't appear to be hazardous either since here I am writing this review in an upright position several days later. My motivation for coming here was that they serve Steamed Chicken. Yes, many people chafe at the concept, but I happen to like it if it's prepared right.\n\nThey prepare it decently, but the portion is quite skimpy with a whole lot of rice to offset the plate (see photo). No chopped ginger and garlic to spread on it either, just a nondescript sauce for dipping. I guess I shouldn't have expected too much for $6.45. I had better luck with the $4.75 Shrimp-Pork Rolls, which turned out to be a pair of jumbo-size spring rolls filled with a lot of lettuce and cellophane noodles. At least they served the right sauce for that - a thick peanut one with chopped peanuts on top, an ample amount for dipping (see photo). Will I return?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-21", "description": "As someone who grew up eating pho and around people who know how to make the best of them, I must say that this place does it right from the first slurp to finish. I've been to several places in San Francisco and West LA where the soup was either sweet or diluted, beef was already well done, side dish of sprouts were unclean and not fresh, or somehow certain key ingredients were skipped over. You won't find any of those weak links here in your piping hot bowl of pho.\n\nI come here a lot. This is not a place to bring a date or to find decent services, but I'm always assured to have a pure a hole in the wall comfort food experience. In my previous visits the server was always absent minded and won't pay attention unless I was with a big party. But in exchange I find them offering one of the most dynamic menus when compare to similar types of pho restaurants. \n\nMore importantly their food lives up to its billing as I find their pho tai gan ($6) and dac biet xe lua ($6.45) top notch and hard to beat. I have had their pho with rare beef and tendon several times. The broth is always rich and flavorful anchored by a nice depth of bone marrow taste. The soup is served very hot so that their still firm noodles and rare beef and buttery tendon can be appropriately steeped with fresh servings of jalapenos, sprouts and basil leafs. It's hard to imagine a more complete bowl of pho. Whereas some places have their soup base inconsistent from opening to closing, my experiences here have been as good as it gets regardless whether I was here for brunch, late lunch or last night's dinner.  We are talkin' about smackin' pho power with tons of street cred straight out of the Tenderloin.\n\nIf you are ever tempted to get an appetizer, try their egg roll with shredded pork rolls with lettuce ($5.50). It comes with two huge spring rolls tightly wrapped with layers of lettuce, shredded pork and crunchy delicious Vietnamese egg rolls at the core. This was one of the most unique and delicious rolls I've tried. In my previous visits I also enjoyed their com ga hap Hai Nam ($6.45) and com bi cha suon nuong ($6.45). I thought the Hai Nan chicken was really great with their rice nicely seasoned, and although the pork chop was decent, I've also had it better at Pho 99 in Daily City. The only item that I would not recommend is their oxtail over rice which I thought was too boney and the stew itself was dry and not very flavorful. \n\nThe culmination of these experiences leading up to last night made this my go-to place for pho. I must try their taro pancake with eggs ($6) for my next visit, among a whole slew of other interesting dishes that I have mentally bookmarked. Aside from the service, my only complaints are their super hot tea that makes the cup hard to hold and their chopsticks are not the cleanest. Adding my list of positive experiences to good prices, it's been 4.5 stars every time I'm here.\n\nB.B, this place has a fried chicken leg dish with your name on it.

The noodles weren't bad, the meat was a bit tough, and the soup was pretty well-seasoned.  The only problem was the smell of the soup... I couldn't detect it, it smelled and tasted a bit like... there was cabbage or kale in there. Or something. This is when I drank the soup straight, without noodles, veggies or anything diluting it.  It was kind of unpleasant.\n\nI don't think I'll come back, since I prefer Sao Bien across the street.

I had to scout for an available waiter. \nSecondly, one of my friends got the wrong item. Thirdly, the most important factor of a 5 star restaurant, the quality of the food---which was below average. \nOur group ordered Hainan Chicken Rice, Chinese and Taro Pancakes, none of the items were delicious at all. The chicken was bland, they gave me some kind of sour sauce that I was supposed to dip the chicken in to compensate for the lack of flavor. The Chicken dish was inauthentic and not good. I have had Hainan Chicken Rice before and I can guarantee that is not how the dish should be served with. \nThe pancakes could only fool people to think they are good only if those people are STARVING and HAVE NEVER HAD Chinese/Taro pancakes before.\n\nLastly, poor food safety score (I just found out when I log onto Yelp to rate this place).

So far so good, it was a total stumble.  I can't say the decor drew me in - it is very spartan, with the main decoration being color photos of the food on the wall, but the pictures are large and they do actually do the food some justice.\n\nI can vouch for a solid Pho Ga.  I tend to go against the grain and eat my Pho without noodles, which in some countries I believe is a felony!  But I like my chicken soup with extra Gai Lan and the folks at Them Ky are OK with that.  I at least don't get the stink eye for being a non-noodle eater.\n\nI recently ordered a beef Banh Mi with my soup at lunch time.  This sandwich was a steal and a half at 3 bucks.  I found they serve grilled marinated beef sannies here- which was a delight, albeit a bit rare to find.  Banh Mi usually seem to be of the pork, chicken or tofu variety.  The beef was tasty, some marinated top round probably, but hey it had flavor and was not too chewy.  Best part is that there was some real grill flavor here, which is hard to find these days. I'm no native Vietnamese but I'd bet my bottom dong( oh wait, trying to be funny saying \"bet my bottom dollar\" turns out its a weird pun on the Vietnamese currency), that real Vietnamese cuisine prides itself on mastery of imparting great grill flavor to its meats.\n\nI mean 3 bucks?!?  Fresh and tasty! The  All veggies super fresh, and a little mayo to boot. \n\nNote:  Been coming back here a lot for the aforementioned Banh Mi.  Solid every time.  Best eaten right there- fresh with the meat still warm.  Not much for ambiance there, but if you can get over that hump and focus on the food- its worth it.  \n\nBy the way, they do a great job with to go food orders.  I get the Pho Ga here often, they serve it with steamed skinless breast meat, and tons of herbs.  Their broth is basic, but flavorful, and you can dress it up when you get home. \n\nSummary - dingy atmosphere, but the food is consistent, a good value, and if you don't like the ambiance, order your food for pick up.

Them Ky, which I thought was a fluke, was randomly chosen by a friend based on cheapness and yelp reviews (golden rule: only go to restaurants with 3 or more stars, always). \n\nIt's a party of six and it's a Wednesday night, but this place is full of people and the energy is great and it's loud and it the air smells like 20 Asian dishes combined, which are both indicative of any great Asian restaurant.

Forgoing asian tradition, we all order individual dishes. I try a little of everything everyone orders. The broken rice plate is GREAT. Their pho ga is SOOOO GOOD.

Noodle dishes, rice plates, and dry noodle bowls are large portioned and less than $7-$8. Our most recent visit for our family of 5 was only ~$40, with an order of 2 large pho bowls, 2 rice plates, and 2 noodle dishes. \n\nAlthough the pho bowls are huge and filling, they aren't amazingly delicious, and sometimes require a bit more hot sauce and soy sauce to further enhance the flavor. This can be placed on the dry noodle bowls as well. The rice dishes, however, are not bad, and the beef is usually marinated well. \n\nThe fried noodle dishes are offered with either Chow Mein (which is thin yellow noodles) or Ho Fun (which are the thick white noodles). Last time, we ordered one of each. We were given the choice of either \"dry\" or \"with gravy\", and for both we chose the \"dry.\" Both dishes were good, but I recommend having the Chow Mein with gravy, because the \"dry\" noodles were bland. \n\nThe decor is clean and has been remodeled in the last 2 years, and they've added pictures of dishes on the walls, which could be great marketing. \n\nThe tapioca drinks are cheap, ranging from $1.85 to $2.30 depending on what flavor you get. On my last visit, I bought a mango flavored drink, and I could not be more disgusted. The tapioca was too soft, and the drink was way too sweet. I had to dilute the whole drink with a cup of water to make it drinkable. -1 star. \n\nSome disadvantages: \n- Servers are not as polished - language barrier, forgetting an order sometimes\n- Parking is a hassle on nights and weekends, there are a few meters around there and in front\n- Cash only, as is a lot of Vietnamese dishes", "author": "Vivian L."}

Problem is, the pieces of meat in the soup were definitely not the best parts of the chicken.  If you don't mind eating chicken and being visually reminded of the fact that you are eating a bird, don't sweat it ... you'll be fine.  :P\n\nThe fresh shrimp and pork rolls were pretty large compared to most other Vietnamese places.  At first, I was impressed by the girth of these rolls, but after a bite or two I felt like there was too much lettuce and noodle and not enough \"good stuff\" that adds flavor ... needed to have less filler (hence, being as thin as most other restaurants) or most shrimp, pork and mint.  Bland, and the dipping sauce was way too thin and slimy.\n\nWas it awful?  No, I guess not.  Did I feel like puking afterward?  Yeah, I did.  Poor tummy...\n\n2.5 stars because the broth was that good.", "author": "Jenny K."}

The place was packed, reaping the rewards of their absent competition.  Luckily, we got a seat and ordered.  More people continued to file into the restaurant and we found ourselves moved from our 4 top table into a makeshift community table.  We didn't mind bumping elbows with strangers, since we just wanted to eat.\n\nI got the shrimp pork rolls w/ lettuce and a large Dac Biet Xe Lua, special combo w/ rare slices of steak, well- brisket, flank tender & trips.

I've been there twice & thoroughly enjoyed it. Not to HCMC, but to Them Ky. I've been to HCMC once. Definitely never going back there again. Something to do with sex tourism, 13 million people and a Gucci store. Ask me about it later if you really want to know.\n\n\nAnyway, the food there is authentic and delicious. Cheap. Never paid more than $20 for 2 people and we left food on the plate. A good sign is that it's usually filled with Vietnamese (ok, that's an assumption on my part: they look \"asian\" and speak \"vietnamese\").\n\nI haven't tried the pho, but the folks I was with were raving about it. I had the bun: brilliant! and the tofu salad with shrimp chips: excellent! and the shredded pork and shrimp spring rolls: nice! \n\nOn their appetizer menu, they have \"radish pancake\" and \"taro pancake.\" I asked what that was and was told \"Pancake made with radish or taro.\" Somewhere in there, there's an egg involved. I'm trying that next.\n\n\n**************************\n\nUpdate: I did try the pancake. Let me start off my saying that our waitress was pretty surprised that I ordered it. Yes, nice Vietnamese lady, yes, I do want the radish pancake. Then, it took like 20 minutes for them to bring it out. My eating pal was almost through his entire giganormous bowl of pho. We were guessing that they went out to get some of the ingredients to make the damn thing.\n\nI'm not even sure how to describe this ... \"pancake\" ...other than to say it's made with rice flour, it's thick, it had some shredded radish in it  and some fried egg  and green onion. It's served with a yummy spicy soy-based sauce. By itself, it wasn't anything special. A little rubbery, a little chewy, a little bland. The sauce made it really snap. \n\nI dunno that I'll get it again. It was pretty good. Kinda weird. But there's a million other things I want to try there first.", "author": "Yasi S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-14", "description": "Remember that friday a few weeks ago when the weather was TOO NICE?  It triggered allergies that triggered a migraine that triggered vertigo similar to the roller coaster ride in Great America.  In that altered state, I thought, in my infinite wisdom, that I would take a bus ride down to the heart of the tenderloin, and have a steaming bowl of Pho.  Perfectly safe, since the sun is high as those women of the night planted on the sidewalk next to a dump of poo.  \n\nI got off the 38.  Walked down the block or two down larkin.  There was a playground that turns in to where the wild things are.  And then I saw Them Ky.\n\nInside, I was seated by the door.  What is up with all these places that put single diners by the door?  If we are cut do we not bleed?  If there is a draft, do we not get cold?  Well, it wasn't too bad since I get very very warm when eating pho.  And it was the perfect place to watch the crazy lady show.  \n\nI ordered the rare steak and tendon pho.  Because I love ligaments.  As i waited, a crazy lady in a wheelchair came in, ordered 7 rolls with butter, opened every individually wrapped roll and dumped a king's ransom's worth of sugar in each roll.  All from her wheel chair, all while shouting in clipped, demanding, assertive asian language that the proprietors understood but when entirely over my head.  \n\nMy soup.  There was so much meat on this.  So much tender beef, so much tender meat.  This is the largest portion of meat on pho in my recollection.  The broth was ok.  i think.  But this opinion may be colored by my migraine/infinite wisdom.  \n\nThe people who run this are really really nice.  They are, by far, the nicest asian people serving food in a commercial setting that I've experienced.  And the prices are terrific.  Aw, what the hell, I'll give it the 5 star perfection.  where else can you get a bowl for $6?  \n\nI'll have to go back and pay more attention to the broth.  But it's pretty darn tasty and they have much variety.\n\nUPDATE: 07.08.09\n\nI went back here because I'm doing this thing where I order the rare steak on the side.  And also, I'm trying to retrain the amount of basil and bean sprouts I put in to the broth.  And finally, because I'm trying to figure out which places have the deadly MSG (I'm allergic) and which places are not death.  A bit dramatic, I know.  But I've got nothing else going on in my life.  \n\nToday, i ordered the steak and tendon.  Now, I don't know what makes places do the different slices of tendon, but I know that in the end, it does make a difference when it comes to texture and eating enjoyment.  The tendon today was not so good.  But there was a lot of it.  But it was sliced thin.  \n\nThe steak I ordered on the side.  See that?  I'm growing up.  I'm eating my pho in a deconstructed manner that would make top chef cringe.  This platter of beautiful RED RED RED RED REDRUM REDRUM!!!  steak beautiful color bright red.  It was a generous serving and it was bright red!  I mention this because i've been served \"dull red\" and even \"red with splotches of brown!\"  The things that one takes for granted, like red meat.  That is still red.\n\nThe broth was good today.  It was not the deep color of Nam something something something.  It was a clear.  And when I remembered to take a sip before corrupting it with basil, it had a singing clarity that was once reserved for small italian boys.  Next time I think I'll not put in bean sprouts because that makes the broth cool down too quickly.  And I'll ask for the broth to be xtra hot.  EXTRA hot.  I only just re-grew the roof of my mouth after a tragic Imperial Roll accident.  \n\nThe ventilation here is perfect so when i start getting meno-pausal symptoms, the cool breeze of crazy TL brings me right back to reality.", "author": "Christina C."}

I really really wanted to like this place as I have yet to find my Vietnamese pho place in little Saigon. \n\nThe pluses: Upon entry I noticed the spacious seating in the well lit room. The tea was brought out promptly and I was seated immediately by a very friendly/sweet woman who waddled around. \"What to order?\" I though.....might as go w/ the standard of pho since that's a pretty good determination of the quality of the food for the place. While deciding, the phone rings twice and its not that annoying phone ring...its this old school Castlevania, Final Fantasy, Legend of Zelda esque tune that brings those days rushing back. \n\nPho came out after 2 mins later and it was absolutely huge. It was screaming hot so I gave it 5 mins.  \n\nThis is how I eat my pho:  \n1. Put in all the sprouts, mint, peppers and lime.\n2. mix\n3. Drink about 2/3 of the broth. \n4. Eat the rest; savoring the goodness. \n\nEverything went fine from 1-3 but while drinking the broth I couldn't help thinking how salty the broth was. I shrugged it off by convincing myself that it couldn't be THAT salty.....then I started feeling my mouth getting parched and my lips cracking. Ok...this might be a little salty for me. \"Lemme just finish this up.\" I think to myself.  The noodles...and the meat were all fine...but this broth....its really starting to hurt me head.....speaking of which...what is this condensation on my brow? Am I actually sweating?!? Is my body desperately trying to purge salt out of it? It is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I never wast food...ever....but I get down to the last cup of the broth/salt mixture and I just can't take it any more. I'm feeling real light headed now and my heart is pounding like a hammer. I get up and pay......looking for a comment box to suggest less salt/seasoning....there isn't one. \n\nMy head is throbbing as I go home....I actually contemplate gagging myself. Now I have eaten LOTS of things that are unhealthy but have never contemplated purging..until last night. \n\nIf anyone from Them Ky is reading this, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put less salt in the pho....end.

It was early, around 6:30pm on a weekday and the place seemed pretty empty with a few occupied tables. I like how they have pictures of their items on the menu, making ordering a bit easier, but then again, it makes me want to order multiple dishes, more than I can feast on! So I ordered the bun bo bue for $6.95 and my friend ordered the seafood noodle soup. Our order was taken by a very sweet and lovely grandmother. As soon as we sat at the table, she asked for our order, when we told her we needed a few more mins, she came back a few more mins, and then while we were enjoying our food, she'd come by to check to make sure we were doing alright and if we needed anything else. I wish she was my grandmother. This restaurant definitely has a \"family owned\" feel to it. Anyway, I really liked my bun bo bue. I got a very large bowl, and I believe I asked for a small. Although I also asked for it to be spicy, it wasn't spicy enough. Next time I'll ask for extra spicy. As for my friend, his bowl of seafood noodle soup looked good, but he said he got a stomach ache after that. I'd definitely be back!", "author": "Vinkin Ken T."}

The five stars are for the bbq beef sandwiches.  Basically, if you like the meat that comes in a vermicelli bowl, you'll definitely like these sandwiches.  They take that same bbq meat, either pork or beef, and they stuff it into bread along with the regular pickled carrots and some peppers. No frills otherwise, but oh-so-delish.  My friend calls them \"crack sandwiches.\"  If I could, I would eat these for lunch every day.

Unless you drive right up to the door you will almost certainly walk past a few others on your way and wonder whether you would be just as well off stopping in one of those.  Though I haven't visited them all I can with great confidence say keep on going.  Them Ky is some great eating!\n\nLet's start with the service and setting.  The range of Vietnamese restaurant choices in the area go from somewhat chichi to dive and this place is definitely on the dive side of the scale.  But within that context the service is entirely fine and the place is totally clean.  No deductions there.  So then it becomes all about the food.  For the most part you will find the similar menu options at many places throughout the city but this one also has Vietnamese sandwiches and in general has an extensive menu.  I tend to use Pho Hoa (the one on Clement) as my base level of decent pho as for years it was in the rotation of fallback plans for any evening where the dinner decision was a struggle.  From there I had on several occasions tasted worse and somewhat better pho.  But from the first taste of the broth at Them Ky I knew I was on a whole new level!  It had a rich, full color and flavor.  And that was before I spiced it up with jalapenos, sprouts, basil, lemon and ceracha sauce (all of which was very fresh).  My friend ordered and loved the tofu salad with shrimp chips and we also had the shredded pork and shrimp rolls which were very fresh and tasty.  Add in that 2 of us ate, with something to drink and a nice tip, for ~$20 and Them Ky ends up being fantastic!", "author": "Jay W."}

After awhile I come here for only 4 items on the menus because they are freaking delish! All the other plates are pretty good but nothing to rave about. My top 4 items are:\n\nPho Dac Biet- One of the best in the city, flavorful, not too strong, not too weak. They have all my favorite meat toppings and the pho noodles come out just right. Not too hard or too soft.\n\nBun Bo Hue- The spicy pork soup is yummmmmy! I love the thinkly slice cabbage, lime, and herb condiment that it comes with. You get thinly slice pork and blood cubes. If you didn't grow up eating it then it won't be for you. You can ask for it w/o and save them some money on waste. I tried bun bo hue in other restaurants but this is one of my favorite.\n\nBBQ Meat (of your choice), shredded pork, and eggloaf over rice- A wonderful dish if you want to get full. I love it because of the variety on the place. Comes with the sweet, garlic, lime-chili dipping sauce and sliced cucumbers and tomatoes.  You can also get it with grilled shrimp or pork chop and egg rolls.\n\nLastly I love the grilled chicken over rice. Deliciously marinated and grilled hot and served over rice with dipping sauce and pickled carrots and diakon. If you love chicken this is the dish for you! Another variation I like is the steamed chicken over rice that comes with ginger oil. You can drink that stuff! No kidding!\n\nThere's 3 hostesses... which other ppl already covered so I won't do that here. If you are looking for a good meal at decent prices. Try one of the dishes above.
