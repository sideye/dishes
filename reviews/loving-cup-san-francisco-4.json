As it was late, we didn't have many options, but we both had massive sweet tooth cravings and didn't want to have to walk too far. Luckily, I found on Yelp that Loving Cup was open and not too far of a trek from Davies Symphony Hall. \n\nThe interior is large, bright, and airy - I was there at night but can imagine what a pleasant place this would be to hang out on a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon. We shared a large Dirty Hipster with a vanilla base, which came in a massive cup - it was almost too much froyo for the both of us. The Dirty Hipster is comprised of Oreos and Nutella, which is one of my favorite combos. All their frozen yogurts are freshly churned, and made to order, which is why your dessert may take a while to come out. It tastes heavenly, and decadent - definitely a little more indulgent than your typical froyo shop!\n\nOverall, this place is a lovely creamery, although a little pricey (I forgot exactly how much, I think around $7-8 for a large?), but definitely worth the splurge if you are in the area and have a hankering for freshly churned ice cream! Although I personally loved the Oreos and Nutella combination, I would recommend ordering something that incorporates their fresher/non-prepackaged ingredients, like \"fresh ground peanut butter, chocolate chunks, fruits and berries, house-made salted caramel, and locally roasted espresso beans\" that they advertise on their website. These fresh and locally sourced ingredients might be where Loving Cup shines more; I will definitely experiment with new flavors when I'm in SF again!", "author": "Claire L."}

It was still good, but definitely not what I really wanted . \n\nAs another example, the pumpkin flavor would have been an added pumpkin mixture. Seems kinda strange honestly. Like chocolate plus pumpkin seems like too much going on. \n\nThey are definitely unique with what they offer. So if you like soft serve ice cream, this is the place for you.\n\nIf you like tart froyo, this is not the place for you.\n\nService was on point, the \"yogurista\" really took the time to answer all my questions and explain and show me what the toppings were. Thanks for her patience!\n\nMy vanilla chocolate swirl w/coconut was creamy & decadent. A good level of sweet, not too over. Didn't melt on me, so it was not watery. \n\nWould I come again though? Maybe just to try their peanut butter. But other than that, not what I'm looking for in a froyo place. I'll still give it 4 stars for what it is though!\n\nPlenty of tables for you to sit and chat, which is a plus!", "author": "Angela C."}

Yes!\n\nFOOD: Loving Cup offers froyo made by the cup (with custom mix-ins) as well as some classic + creative takes on rice pudding. \n\nFroyo base is fantastic, and there's nothing more refreshing after dinner than having some berries blended in. The heavier picks are delicious if you have space too--the dirty hipster in particular (Oreos, coffee, and some other goodness) is a favorite of mine. \n\nRice pudding is sadly average. For a lower price and higher flavor, I would opt for Trader Joe's rice pudding instead. The coconut flavor was fine, but given the subtle coconut flavor was more like rice pudding with coconut than coconut rice pudding. The cookies and cream was surprisingly good, but the cookies do get soggier than I'd like in the pudding (vs. ice cream, where the freezing retains a touch of the crunch). Overall, the price is so absurd that unless you are looking for a one-time organic blah blah indulgence, I would get the froyo and call it a day.\n\nSERVICE: Order at the counter and sit down if you like. People are always nice at the register and surprisingly quick to turn out orders considering froyo is made one cup at a time on one machine.\n\nAMBIANCE: Cute little Hayes Valley cafe that seats ~15 at most on stools and at tables.

Like the first time I ever tried Loving Cup.  Now, I'm not saying I did an awful job; I just don't think anyone would call my Chocolate Froyo, Strawberries, and Cookie Dough combination a classic.  Although, now that I think about it, it couldn't have been all that weird since it actually tasted pretty good!\n\nNow, despite how the nearby Smitten gets more foot traffic and buzz, it'd be a mistake to overlook Loving Cup.  Specializing in rice pudding and hand churned frozen yogurt, their offerings are certainly more unique (I don't know of anywhere else that specializes in rice pudding).  What's more, their stuff is delicious!\n\nAs tempted as I was to get one of the tasty looking rice puddings from their display case, I knew I had to take another shot at their frozen yogurt.  However, instead of creating my own concoction again (you start with vanilla or chocolate froyo and then pick what toppings you want mixed in), I opted instead to go with one of their house favorite flavors - MOCHA CHIP (Chocolate Froyo with Espresso Beans & Bittersweet Chocolate Chips).\n\nThough it may not be one of their more creative/interesting flavors, I still thought this was pretty darn good!  Texturally, thanks to the churning process that mixes in the toppings, the froyo has a sort of creaminess that's very unlike most varieties of frozen yogurt out there.  What's more, the chocolate flavor isn't overly sweet or bitter and is reinforced nicely by the bits of chips, as well as the espresso grinds.  Much better than my creation from before!\n\nBesides the difference in my order, another reason why I enjoyed this experience a bit more than my first is because of how this location is quite a bit larger.  Compared to their original spot on Poke Street, this one is much more spacious, offering plenty of room for customers to wait for their orders without feeling cramped, in addition to a bunch of tables for people to sit and relax at.  Which is kind of a big deal when you just want to catch up with some friends or get a little cozy with your date.\n\nFOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down for now, if only because I'd still prefer a scoop of ice cream over froyo, but Loving Cup, I'll definitely be back to see you again soon!", "author": "Mike L."}

In NYC, there are lines around the block for this magical, caloric, sweet gloppy goodness. NYers were always a little ahead of the dessert curve.\n\nLoving Cup is an adorable spot in Hayes Valley specializing in rice pudding (which is what got us in the door) and in custom blends of extremely rich frozen yogurt. The rice pudding selection is slim compared to its NY doupleganger, but all the offerings looked delicious. Our order of cookies and cream was a sugar bomb.\n\nin the frozen yogurt, is there any self-respecting foodie that admits to liking the stuff?  Usually its about the toppings. Even words like hand spun and pro-biotic that make the medicine go down with slightly more superior feeling karma aren't the deal here: it's the taste.  Ethos aside, the yogurt here is delicious and custard like. You'll be surprised how rich it is.  I did a simple blend in of marshmallow into their base chocolate, and was pretty happy with that.  They have recommended blends with three and more combinations, and all sounded creative and varying degrees of delicious. Cups and spoons are compostable, so you can feel even better.\n\nThere was barely anyone here at around 6pm on Friday night, but I ask you San Francisco, is there anything wrong with eating rice pudding for dinner?  It may be  time to take that notion seriously.", "author": "Rachel H."}

Unlike most froyo places where you choose your flavor(s) and then add toppings on top of the froyo, Loving Cup only has two flavors of froyo - vanilla and chocolate - and has a number of \"toppings\" that are actually blended into the base flavors. They have a few base-topping recommendations, but with this concept, there's essentially an endless number of froyo flavors you can create. \n\nThe only problem and the biggest reason I struggle to give Loving Cup more than 4 stars is the price. A small cup is $3.75 (medium $4.75, large $5.75), which includes only one topping. Any additional topping is an extra $0.75. I don't think it's worth paying more than $4 for a small cup of froyo, which basically limits my froyo creations to basic flavors that would be equally as good or better at other places. \n\nI ended up getting the VANILLA BASE WTH ESPRESSO ($3.75), so basically a coffee/espresso froyo. The texture of the froyo is pretty smooth and creamy, but I would've liked a much, much stronger flavor, which I think would be hard to accomplish in general given Loving Cup's concept. \n\nSince I like more intense flavors in general, I honestly wanted to give the froyo just 3 stars, it gets an extra star for the unique idea. They also have various rice puddings here. I haven't tried them yet, but might opt for one of those next time.", "author": "Jessie L."}

So now you know it wasn't invented by the old woman in the white support hose and black hairnet at your elementary school cafeteria. That was Mrs. Crabtree in mine. Yes, I know she was hot, but remember when she scooped the rice pudding into the dull pink melamine bowl and put a vanilla wafer on top. That was the last time I ate it before the recent wave of rice pudding when Jamie W. and I discovered the first Loving Cup location on Polk where we fell in love with it again.\n\nNow this Loving Cup pops up, and Hayes Valley denizens can bounce between having rice pudding here and bread pudding at Schulzies. Is it fair for one neighborhood to have both? Oh sure, as long as I'm not wolfing it down every day although i was surprised to find out a small cup is only 195 calories. That doesn't seem too decadent. Besides, this one has more seating and seems a bit more relaxed. Yes, I know they offer frozen yogurt, but I never pass up the rice pudding. I can't. Must be in my DNA. There are only six ingredients in their creations: non-fat milk, arborio rice, eggs. sugar, salt and vanilla bean.\n\nI'm rarely there when they have anything beyond their standard selection of Madagascar Vanilla Bean, Cinnamon Rum Raisin or my personal favorite, Coconut.

I wasn't much into froyo that night so I decided to give their rice pudding a try! \n\nAll rice pudding are Madagascar vanilla based and then added with their own little twist. So I got the oreo pudding, bf got something that was similar to a butter finger?! And my little brother just had plain choco froyo w/ rainbow sprinkles.\n\nThe oreo puddding was sooooo good! But honestly, a little goes a long way. It was really too much for me to finish and I had a size small. You can get sick of it easily. Bf loved his size medium and finished it all! \n\nCustomer service was great. The lady was very patient and accommodating since it was out first time there. They do offer cups of water which you put in a snow cone up!!! Their water dispenser was leaking for the longest time and no one ever bothered to fix it so -1 star for that.\n\nAlso, their bathroom didnt have any seat covers....

I'm a huge fan of their frozen yogurt (the combinations! so many to choose from!), but rice pudding is something I've always been a little so-so on.  That being said, after wandering around in the SF sun this past weekend, I was in the mindframe to try something new.  Rather than stress out over what to get, I went with what looked like the best option to me: the Coconut Rice Pudding was calling my name.  The sweetness of the coconut in the rice pudding reminded me of the Hawaiian dessert haupia, but I couldn't be more surprised in reading their menu board in seeing that a Small rice pudding sets you back only 195 calories and 3.5 grams of fat!

Loving Cup's rice pudding all has milk, but the frozen yogurt can be made with a banana-based vegan yogurt (and your choice of added flavors). The banana flavor is strong, so I'd recommend adding a bunch of stuff if you want to cover it up, but the texture is great and it tastes pretty good. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that the frozen yogurt was made from a base with whatever flavoring (nuts, fruit, chocolate, etc) you could want. I once had something similar in Guatemala, and was excited to find it here. The yogurt did not disappoint; the chocolate base is good and rich, and the selection of toppings is wide and expansive. The yogurt itself is smooth and creamy, but the chocolate chips make it rough, so don't add them if you want it smooth. The menu of suggested combinations is super helpful, and you can always tweak them slightly to your preference.\n\nThe price is about average for frozen yogurt, and I would definitely come back if I'm in the area.

Loving Cup is a bit different than other froyo place I've been to, as you pick your base (chocolate or vanilla) and then choose ingredients to mix in. I decided to try a vanilla base froyo with Nutella and cookie dough mixed in, and my boyfriend decided to try the Dirty Hipster, which is a vanilla base froyo with Nutella and Oreos mixed in. Both of our froyos were absolutely delicious. \n\nI'm a bit of a froyo snob, so I was thoroughly impressed with Loving Cup's concept and execution. Each froyo is hand churned to order, and their ingredients are all natural, probiotic, fat-free and made with live active cultures. Also, according to their website, each 5 oz serving is 120 calories, but I'm sure that depends on your mix ins. \n\nOn our second visit, my boyfriend and I shared a small Oreo rice pudding, which was actually pretty big. Loving Cup's rice pudding is premade, so you have the opportunity to try their flavors before making your purchase. While I didn't care much for the rice pudding, my boyfriend liked it quite a bit.\n\nOne thing I really like about Loving Cup is the way they do their customer loyalty cards. After nine purchases, your tenth froyo is free, which isn't too hard to achieve if you come in groups, as Loving Cup gives you credit per order, not per visit, which I really like. \n\nIn regards to their customer service, it's a bit of a hit or miss. The first time we came here, we were greeted kindly by two workers, who were more than willing to tell us exactly how Loving Cup worked and what flavor combinations they thought would work well together. However, the second time we came, we were given somewhat of a cold shoulder by the worker on duty. She seemed to be in a bit of a bad mood, and spent most of her time talking to a customer who seemed to be a friend. She seemed a bit ticked off when we asked for a sample of rice pudding and when we wanted to place our order, as it disrupted her conversation with her friend. Oh well.\n\nOverall, Loving Cup offers quality froyo in a clean and great location. It's also open pretty late, even on Sundays, which I really appreciate since I tend to eat late.", "author": "Janelle C."}

It's basically a dessert place that sells rice pudding and froyo options. I know what you're thinking: ah yes another froyo place. FALSE. This froyo is actually pretty different. They have two flavors: vanilla or chocolate, and then you basically blend a topping into the froyo.  It's not like the Coldstone or DQ concept where it's added in with the ice cream and then mixed. When you get the actual cup of froyo, it looks as if the froyo basically dispensed the toppings with it. Sounds kind of weird but is a simple and well executed concept. I just really like having my toppings with my actual ice cream.\n\nI got the vanilla with graham crackers and gummy bears. Good froyo with good toppings, what's to complain? If you're too lazy to create your own, they also have pre-created ones that you can just order from.

You're not just getting toppings slapped on--you're getting them WITH the frozen yogurt. And that in itself is amazing. You can make this treat as light or as decadent as you want, and there's no wrong time to stop by and devour it in minutes/seconds.\n\nMy favorite combos:\n1) Blueberries, raspberries, granola, and almond butter (vanilla base--it tastes like breakfast!)\n2) Coconut, pineapple, and mango (vanilla base)\n3) Espresso and toffee (chocolate base)\n\nBut really, you can't go wrong. Try as many combinations as possible!\n\nThe rice pudding is just as divine.

As you walk in there's the counter with a glass display filled with rice pudding and other non-important items hehe.

But I do believe that it is yummy anyways. There were 6 flavors to choose room.. coconut raisin, cookies and cream, lemon vanilla, vanilla bean, and other flavors I have forgotten. I think that all of them tasted very good but I went for the vanilla bean.. sort of original and reminds me of tapioca.\n\nThey also sell hand-churned frozen yogurt haha I just didn't have any.\n\nI wound recommend you you coming here if you're on a date and wanting rice pudding haha it's a nice environement to chit chat and nice workers to be around.", "author": "Connie V."}

I didn't have to go all the way to Polk Street to get my fix. A little sad though that it ended up replacing a former tea house that was a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. Despite this, I found the Loving Cup takeover a refreshing and suitable addition to this charming little district. It's a stone throw away from many eateries (i.e. Patxi's, Le Boulange, Stacks, etc.), which I think works to its advantage as people tend to balance out their palates with something sweet, but not incredibly indulgent or guilt-inducing. There are plenty of tables and chairs. Every time that I've been here, I've never had trouble getting a table for myself. It's very spacious! I even noticed one girl taking a whole table for herself with her study materials spread out. The employees are very friendly and helpful in narrowing down the choices for me. Overall, I've had nothing but wonderful experiences the two times I've been here. \n\nFor the price of a cup of coffee, the froyo mixed with fruit (1 mix-in included) can make you feel very healthy. I personally enjoy tasting a flavorful combination, so vanilla & raspberry was a perfect mix. Just be wary that the seeds could get wedged between your molars. They have a list of popular combinations with clever names attached to them (i.e. Have you done your homework, Larry?), Most are pretty common combinations, including strawberries & graham crackers. I have yet to choose from the menu because I've always had a craving for fruit, which I would prefer alone. But whatever your preference, the sky's the limit as to what you can put together. \n\nLet's not forget about the rice pudding. I love love love the cookies and cream rice pudding. You can really taste the chunks of Oreos in almost every bite. YUM! I think the bittersweet chocolate chip was just okay. It was bland to me probably because I wasn't able to taste the chocolate.

Im not sure the name of the person who helped us but she was a ray of light! Her sweet attitude more than made for the lack of sugar in the rice pudding. Maybe she unknowingly absorbed it all? \n\nWe've since been back and while our ray of light wasn't there, neither was the sugar. So far we've had the coconut, lemon and Madagascar vanilla, each one lacked much sweetness. For some this might be alright but for me it's not what rice pudding is all about. Rice pudding is supposed to be comforting but here it was more like a pizza with no cheese, Thai food without chili, spaghetti with no meatballs, you get the idea. The texture and the flavors were there, so kudos for those, but dang check the amount of sugar in the recipe. \n\nThe frozen yogurt was pretty good and a nice alternative to the long lines down the street at the other dessert place. It's probably healthier here too, even with some of the fun mix ins LC offers. Oh, there's lots of seating here too, so take a load of and stay a while.", "author": "Alexander C."}

We were hanging around Civic Center area for SF Pride, and walked the 5-6 blocks over to this location (the other location up Polk St is walkable, but about double the distance).  It was busy inside, but there were only 2 people between us and the counter in line, and we waited about 5 minutes after ordering - sufficient time to go to the bathroom.  The tables outside were open, so we sat outside for some prime time people watching.\n\nI got the chocolate fro-yo with dark chocolate chips and espresso beans - chocolate overload!  They blend everything together before serving it, and I love how there are toppings in every bite.  If you get fro-yo at a self-serve place, usually your first 1/3 will be toppings, and your last 1/3 of the bowl will be just fro-yo.  You wouldn't know it was non-fat by eating it, either.  They give a generous amount over the top of the bowl, which is always a marker of a good place - don't skimp!  The prices on the menu are a bit misleading*, but the value proposition makes sense - customized, high quality fro-yo mixtures in downtown SF will cost this much.  A self-serve place might be $1-$1.50 less if you just pay by weight, so you are paying for them to mix it and a little bit of a premium.  \n\n*The regular prices are listed on the menu as getting 1 topping for free, and $0.75 for each additional topping - all of the recommended creations have 2 toppings, so you need to add the $0.75 to the listed prices - there's no \"$5.50\" listed anywhere even though that's what you'll pay for a medium-sized recommended creation (like a 'Dirty Hipster', for example)", "author": "Ben K."}

Most of the time though, it's pretty good. \n\nPro: It's made-to-order.

When me and my girlfriend order she told us the total and just swung the iPad around and walked away to talk to the guy. I then asked for a frequent card to be stamped and she just took it without acknowledgement and stamped it. I made it a point to say thank you to let her know I appreciated her service. The whole time she didn't even give me eye contact and said something under her breath. \n\nThis happened with another cashier the previous time as well. Not friendly or seemed helpful at all. They just seem that they don't want to be there. \n\nAll the while the guy is making the ice cream greeting customers and wishing them a goodnight.

Their rice pudding is well-known and I was a bit hesitant to try, simply because I had a preconceived notion that rice pudding is supposedly heavy.  One of workers was really nice to allow us to sample all their flavors prior to decision-making.  After my first sample, I find that their rice pudding had the thickness of oatmeal and the consistency of Chinese-style porridge (jook), however unlike oatmeal or porridge, it was not dense, but rather unexpectedly light. Sounds confusing, but it's something one MUST try to fully understand.  After sampling all their flavors, I ordered the Cinnamon Rum Raisin with strawberries and extra rum raisins.  BOMB.COM  It's light enough where I wanted more, but had to save my stomach...boo =(  too bad I was full from dinner because I really wanted to return, that same night, for more.\n\nThe location is in an hipster area, but it's definitely located perfectly off a few short blocks away from the noise of cafes, restaurants, and bars.  After enjoying a meal, drinks, and/or coffee, guests can stroll over, taking a break from crowds, (where people may have a harder time hearing conversations) and settle down with a great cup of rice pudding (and be able to chat comfortably with friends). \n\nPrices are very reasonable for their quantities; will return (possibly try the Polk St. shop) for their customizable fro-yo", "author": "Jessica S."}

Bland even with all the mix-ins. \n\n It was my first time trying Loving Cup, I ordered through Postmates because they hella got me with that promo today for 2 free yogurts. For some reason there was no option for an additional order that i could purchase so I deleted my free yogurts and had to go to the regular page to order and ended up ordering 3 pints and you know...i just didnt want the  postmates delivery guy to come all the way here just for two little ass yogurts.\n\nWhatever. Anyways. So I ordered 3 different mixes:\nChocolate w/espresso and peanut butter, \nVanilla w/ mango, pineapple and coconut, \nand Vanilla w/ strawberry, almond butter and graham crackers. Those don't sound gross right?! Well they were all pretty blah.\n\nThe vanilla base seemed a little icy and tasted like watered down milk with not even a hint of vanilla. The mix-ins were pretty weak in taste as well - my strawberry, almond butter and graham cracker tasted like special k cereal w strawberry and low fat milk. The one with the pineapples and mangoes should have been bursting with flavor but it didnt. The chocolate one had a better texture, it was smooth and thick probably with the help of the pb. Flavor wise, it needed more chocolate and the pb was still lost in there somewhere. The only flavor that was strong was the espresso. \n\nI think the bases should have been able to stand alone -which is obvious that it can't- and that adding all these mix ins would be an extra bonus for your taste buds -those didnt help much either.

Dessert was sounding good after pizza so we walked in to check things out. To our pleasant surprise, they had rice pudding in a small variety of flavors as well as frozen yogurt. You don't see rice pudding too often so we decided to go with that. We didn't even ask for a sample taste first...we just went for it. I had the vanilla bean rice pudding with homemade caramel sauce... So delicious! My daughter had the coconut rice pudding with homemade chocolate sauce. They lined the cup with the chocolate sauce so it made a chocolate shell and then they filled it with the rice pudding. Yummy... The next day we had to go back. This time I tried the frozen vanilla yogurt with caramel sauce and my daughter went back and ordered the coconut rice pudding with chocolate sauce again. While the yogurt was good, I'd recommend the rice pudding over the yogurt any day. Or just order a cup of that awesome caramel sauce :)", "author": "Edie U."}

I got one with nutella and it was divine haha. I don't remember what else was in it, but the nutella. Would definitely come back for some more nutella FroYo!", "author": "Christina C."}

I went with it because it's seasonal, but I sampled the oreo rice pudding, which was amaaaaazing. Dirty hipster also sounds really good.

My favorites are chocolate froyo with cookie dough and almond butter, and the cookies'n'cream rice pudding.\n\nWhen I first found this place, I was obsessed with it. I've been there probably ten times over the past year, and I'm sort of over it, but that's just me. It's still a fun and tasty place.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the tablet they use. They scan your credit card and then turn around a big screen that says \"How much do you want to tip?\" with a couple amounts and a big red zero at the bottom with an asterisk that says you're a terrible person and everyone is judging you right now. Ok so maybe that last part isn't explicit, but the idea is obviously to guilt trip you into paying more than $5 for your little ice cream cup and I don't appreciate it.", "author": "Chris M."}

I've only had the yogurt, I ordered a small dirty hipster and enjoyed it as I walked around the neighborhood. I will definitely be back because it's addicting and I want to try the rice pudding but I'd suggest more friendliness from staff please!", "author": "Madeline S."}

They are a fun store too, good atmosphere and pretty quick turn around. My only complaint is that the fro-yo isn't rich enough for my wants, but the fact that you can put in everything you ever wanted makes it quite tasty!", "author": "Ezra B."}

I got a vanilla base with almond butter and banana, and it was amazing. I went close to their closing time, so it wasn't very crowded, but the place isn't that large so I could imagine it getting a little cramped while busy. The amount of combinations you can choose are a little overwhelming, but seriously, it's awesome. (They also play cool music).", "author": "Lauren F."}

I love it all, the location, the space design, the friendly service. I like pudding, specifically the flavors they offer, but what I LOVE is the blended frozen yogurt. I am a local in the hood and tonight was my first visit. I chose the toasted coconut, almond butter, chocolate fro-yo blend and it was insanely YUM! I cant wait to go back for the cinammon crunch fro-yo and the mocha chip fro-yo and the thin mint and well you get my drift. This place is a must if you like this sort of thing! In moderation , of course :)", "author": "Leila B."}
