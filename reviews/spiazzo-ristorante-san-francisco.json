Not a problem here because even when it does get crowded the clients here seem to like a quiet cozy meal. \nYou start off with the fresh bread and tomato cream spread. \nThe food was perfect and tasty no matter what you order. \nNote don't fill up on the food because you wouldn't want to miss the tiramisu .

When we arrived we got seated right away. The restaurant is very small but looks like many families like to eat here. Parking can be a bit hard, there are alot of metered parking outside, but it depends on time of day, it gets busy as there are other popular restaurants near by. For starters we ordered calamari, and clams. I was not able to eat the clams but my friends loved it, but we were not too impressed with the calamari. Maybe it was the way it cooked, it was just fried and topped off with veggies, with a spicy sauce. I ordered penne pasta with chicken and veggies, and my husband orders the seafood pasta. I was not too impressed with my pasta, the sauce tasted water down, and the chicken was cut in chunks. It was really nothing special to me, but the seafood pasta looked pretty good, only that there were only a few pieces of it. All in service was great, but the food was not that great. Unfortunately I probably will not come back as its pretty expensive and I didnt really like my pasta or the way it was cooked.

You should totally go here.\n\nHealthy portions, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. \n\nGot the special calamari antipasto - which was very large. calamari where quite nicely fried and the sauce that comes with it was just the right of spice and not balance for me (I'm at the medium spice tolerance level). \n\nAlso got Eggplant Parmigiana antipasto. The eggplant was thinly sliced and stacked instead of thick slices - which I think I prefer thick slices, but my husband apparently prefers thin slices, so he was stoked - he usually doesn't eat the eggplant but he did here. I will note that the inside of it was a little cold - so that's a ding. \n\nSpecial pesto and chicken ravioli were solid. They tasted very much like pesto, although they came in a light cream sauce which I quite enjoyed. The sun dried tomato and mushroom paired nicely. The chicken maybe was a little dry? (or maybe I just don't really like chicken?).\n\nGnocci were definitely fresh. The sauce was very simple - and therefore not a good choice for me (but that's why I didn't order it) - but I think it's what my husband was looking for. \n\nBread comes standard (important feature). It was French bread - as a bread snob I was unimpressed - but the tomato dip that comes with it is quite nice. \n\nCame in on Sunday night around 6:30 and got a table for two without reservation, but it did look like those that arrived just after us had to wait a few minutes.", "author": "Sarah C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-22", "description": "Pasta and parking... already makes for a decent meal in SF. \nI guess that while it may convince you to check it out, it's not very helpful so here is the full review.\n\nSpiazzo is a cozy Italian restaurant nestled in the restaurant row of West Portal. It's mostly traditional, not hip like Delarosa and not exorbitantly expensive like SPQR. Think of it as a more intriguing, non-chain version of Olive Garden.\n\nThe menu is expansive, with a wide selection of apps ($15-20), pastas (~$17), pizzas (~$15), and entrees ($15-25). There's also an extra page for specials, which are a tad more pricey (~$19 pasta and $23 risotto) but also more interesting. While there isn't really anything mind-blowingly unique, the options are solid and you're bound to find a dish matching your carvings. Although I'm a fan of simple pomodoro pastas, I would suggest getting a meat one since the vegetarian and seafood pastas only differ by $1-2. \n\nI tried the pappardelle with lamb... because pappardelle and lamb are my weaknesses. The chunks of lamb were tender and juicy, the pappardelle consisted of extra-wide ribbons of pasta, and both held together seamlessly with the hearty tomato sauce. The pastas are huge (even the raviolis are giant size), and we all got boxes. \n\nWe also shared a calamari appetizer, which was also a large portion size with satisfying assortment of lightly battered calamari, octopus, and tiny shrimp. The complimentary bread was decent too, warmed and with a nice crisp to the crust.\n\nService was excellent; the server was very accommodating and offered to help us move to a roomier table when we found out there would be more people joining our group. He also took one of the dishes to keep warm while someone in our party took her kids to the bathroom. \n\nOverall, the dining experience at Spiazzo was classic and on-point. \nI guess pasta and parking in SF never really could go wrong after all.", "author": "Edna C."}

We were seated around 7:20pm.\n\n*Burrata E Prosciutto: fresh mozzarella shell and stracciatella, with 12 months aged prosciutto and kalamata olives + EVOO ($16.95) x2\n*Fried Calamari: calamari, baby shrimps, zucchini deep fried with arrabiata sauce, spicy ($18.95) x2\n*Insalata Alla Cesare: caesar salad ($8), add Anchovies (+$3.50)\n*Pizza Tricolore: 1/3 Margherita with fresh tomato and basil, 1/3 Four cheeses, and 1/3 Pesto and Mozzarella ($16.95)\n*Sangiovese Pasqua ($34)\n*Barbera d'Asti ($36)\n\nWe all shared appetizers and wine. I enjoyed the burrata and prosciutto. The burrata was creamy while the prosciutto added a nice meaty saltiness. I adore anchovies so I ordered the caesar. It satisfied my veggie craving, but it was over dressed. I also could have used more anchovies! The pizza was a nice way to try a couple different pies, but it seemed like it was only a half and half versus a sampling of three pizzas. I thought the calamari was average. It was a pretty big portion though. The wines were moderately priced. I liked that we could get decent reds for under $40 a bottle.\n\n*Gnocchi Romoletto: italian potato dumplings with fresh tomato, basil, mushrooms and secret spices of the chef ($16.95)\n*Spaghetti Alla Vongole: spaghetti with fresh clams, garlic, white wine, a touch of chili peppers in a tomato sauce ($17.95) x2\n*Spaghetti Portofino: spaghetti, prawns, scallions, white wine + garlic sauce ($19.95)\n*Fettuccine Con Gamberoni: egg fettuccine, fresh tomato, garlic, a touch of chili pepper, white wine, basil, prawns and green onions ($17.95)\n*Ravioli Con Pesto E Pollo: large ravioli, pesto and chicken filled, in a light cream sauce, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach ($19.95)\n*Filetto Alla Dolce Vita: grilled grass fed filet mignon with mushrooms, prosciutto in a marsala wine sauce ($27.95)\n*Garretto Romanesco: braised lamb shank with mushrooms and green peas in a tomato wine sauce served with risotto ($26.95)\n\nI ordered the filet since I'm a big meat eater. It was cooked rare and I adored the mushrooms, but it was a little too sweet for me. And the prosciutto didn't seem to go with the wine sauce. I'm not a big pasta eater, but hands down, my favorite dish was the ravioli. So creamy and comforting. Mushrooms and spinach are two of my favorite vegetables, so I adored them in this dish!\n\n*Tiramisu ($7.50)\n*Creme Brulee ($7.50)\n*Chocolate Mousse Cake ($7.50)\n*Zanze's Cheese Cake ($7.50)\n*Graham's Tawny Port n/v ($7.95) x2\n*Graham's 20 Years ($12)\n*Harveys Bristol Cream n/v ($7.95)\n*Vin Santo di Toscana ($12.95)\n*Coffee \u00d73\n\nBirthday celebrations always ended with dessert and drinks. Now, I'm not a huge dessert person, so I only sampled most of the desserts. My favs were the tiramisu and cheesecake. Both were light, creamy, and not too sweet.\n\nFun place for a birthday celebration. Although the restaurant isn't really equipped for bigger parties, they made it work.

My rant is this.  It should be the company's (restaurant business owner) responsibility to pay for their employees benefits, health insurance included.  If a restaurant is unwilling to pay for their employees health insurance it's the employees responsibility to secure their own either through their own paycheck (revenue from tips included) or to find another job or career where insurance is covered if they opt not to buy into paying for their own health insurance.  Alternatively, if the bleeding heart liberal community of SF really wants the customers to pay for employee's health insurance, I'd suggest the more digestible method is to have restaurants just increase their prices by 5% behind the menu and closed doors so it's not so blatantly a \"here's the lower price we charge, but here's the bigger price you have to pay\" - - sort of like how some airlines charge for baggage or hotels that charge for parking or resort fees - - if they just rolled those desired revenues into their base price fee you'd not get so many customers rolling their eyes and protesting in anger.

Since they used boxed/dried pasta, it becomes so important to make sure to cook to al dente, but the spaghetti was a little too overdone, which brought the rating down to 3 stars for me. \n\nThe flavors were generally up to snuff for classic Italian cooking. The seafood had a slight fishiness to it, like it had been sitting around for a day or two too long. Other than that, it was an enjoyable dinner.", "author": "Sheewon B."}

We've passed by this ristorante in the past without giving it a thought, but the thought of a plate of pasta sounded just right for Sunday supper. Fortunately it wasn't very crowded at about 7:30PM, and we got a table right away surrounded by bottles of wine on their dining room divider (photo: http://bit.ly/2gA2x5s). The menu was chock full of items that sounded like comfort food for paisans like us. OK, we're not real paisans, but you know what I mean.\n\nWe were first handed quite a bread plate with huge slices of rustic goodness accompanied by a creamy tomato sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2gc49z7). We tried to control ourselves for the carbs to come but to little avail. The Bruschetta seemed a tad pricey at $9.50, but we understood why the moment it arrived. The toasted and buttered garlic bread slices were as big as rice paddles and topped with Kalamata olives. Two were piled high with fresh tomatoes and basil in the traditional way, and the other two were spread with pesto and piled high with sliced mushrooms marinated in olive oil (photo: http://bit.ly/2gtSJcx). Really delicious, especially the unexpected mushroom bruschetta, and their abundance made us second-guess our soon-to-arrive entrees.\n\nJamie went for a pizza as is his natural want, and it was the $16.95 Pizza Capriciossa topped with prosciutto, artichoke, mushrooms, mozzarella, and just a smidgen of tomato sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2fiBSYd). All the ingredients were tasty, and the crust was not too bready. However, a bigger ladle of tomato sauce would have been welcome to lubricate the gullet as it went down. I was in a seafood mood, so I ordered the $16.95 Spaghetti Alla Vongole, a heaping plate of thick spaghetti pasta with fresh clams, garlic, white wine, chili pepper flakes, all of it in a light tomato sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2fJsXzW). It was frankly just what I wanted even if it wasn't a culinary masterpiece. Neither of us could finish our entrees, so we had enough for our respective lunches at work the following day. These paisans will return soon. Yeah, I'm talking about me and Jamie.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...old-school Italian, well executed and certainly plenty of it...just more sauce on the pizza, please\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...nothing remarkable and a tad squeezed when it crowds up like on Saturdays\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty reasonable though not overly friendly here\nTOTAL - 4 stars...now we gotta place to eat like paisans...mangia!", "author": "Ed U."}

The wait on this Saturday evening wasn't bad because we had reservations however there were several groups waiting on the curb in front of the restaurant. Once seated, I could see that the restaurant(roughly medium sized) had every table filled with customers enjoying themselves. It's a festive, fun atmosphere here.\n\nWe decided to order a bunch of appetizers to share and then each order an entree. Out of all the apps, I really only enjoyed the Calamari and Burrata. Both I could eat by myself. The calamari had a nice black pepper kick and the Burrata was creamy and fresh. For my entree, I went with the Spaghetti All Vongole(spaghetti with fresh clams, garlic, white wine, in a red tomato sauce). I thought my dish decent however not extraordinary. The tomato sauce was a little on the sweet side for me and could have been fresher. The clams were plumb and fresh enough. We then ordered a bunch of desserts to share(Tiramisu, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Zanze's cheese cake, chocolate mousse cake). Out of these, I especially enjoyed the Tiamisu.

Brodetto Di Vongole, sauteed clams with garlic, white wine and a touch of red pepper flakes served with garlic crostini $11.95   \nThe broth was not good.  It completely filled the bowl and was tasteless--sorry to write this.\n2. Eggplant Parmigiana (Special that night) $11.95  \nThis was ok.  The eggplant was thinly sliced and covered in a nice tomato sauce.  I was expecting it to be breaded and fried first but, - it wasn't.  I prefer the fried version.\n\nMains:\n1. Pollo Imperatore, Free range/no antibiotic chicken breast stuffed with mozzarella, prosciutto and spinach in a marsala sauce with mushrooms $20.95  \nNot good at all.  The chicken was so dry that it fell apart with just a fork.  It was confusingly tasteless too.  How could this be with prosciutto, mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms etc??  \n2. Peperoni Ripieno (Stuffed Pepper-Special that night)$ 22.95\nThis large red pepper was densely stuffed with ground sausage and chicken and covered in a spicy sauce.  I asked for Angel Hair pasta instead of the risotto that it usually comes with.  It presented well but, again the flavors were off--you could only really taste the spiciness.  \n\nWe didn't finish any of the dishes.  I am hoping that we just ordered the wrong things.

We arrived on Sunday about 1730 hours and were seated at a cozy spot for 2 in the corner of the restaurant by the front window.  The bench seats were comfortable and the restaurant was clean.  However, it was chilly seated there and the hostess was wearing a jacket and scarf.  Our server was a charming young lady who seemed genuinely appreciative of our business.  Some bread was brought over and we were just a bit disappointed.  I was expecting some quality french bread with butter or olive oil.  We were given some slices of soft brown and white breads with a tomato like spread.  It wasn't that bad, just unexpected.\n\nWe shared a crisp Cesar salad ($8+$1 for splitting). Afterwards we had a petrale sole (~$25) and a scallops and shrimp mixed with capellini noodles (~$29).  These entrees were ordered off the special dinner insert.  The house chardonnay was $9 per glass. Both entrees were excellent in presentation and taste.  Afterwards we split a scrumptious chocolate mousse cake (~$8).\n\nSo why are we giving it just 4 stars instead of 5.  Well a party of 3 women, two men, one toddler, and one baby was seated next to us.  The mother brought a couple of huge diaper bags and laid them on the bench seat essentially pinning us in.  The adults were loud and the toddler was playing with a smartphone and kept throwing it on the floor.  At one point, he nearly tip their table over and spilled water.  These people certainly know how to ruin the dining enjoyment of others with their self-centered behavior.

We ordered the clams as an appetizer - good if you love seafood like me, but mediocre if you're like my boyfriend who needs more substance. To put it simply, it was literally clams in broth. 2 stars for the lasagna my boyfriend ordered, it was delicious. However, the ravioli con pesto e pollo I ordered (which many others seem to have loved) was extremely salty. It's saving grace was the spinach. Now that I'm writing this review I realized not only was my dish extremely salty, I didn't get a bite of chicken. Unless the chicken was finely ground into a powder, I'm fairly sure they forgot to add it. I may come back to try another dish. Their complimentary bread and tomato dip was very good.

It's a small, neighborhood joint that serves decent sized portions of food.  It was a Friday night and there was a line of people waiting to get in.  Being small and most likely family owned, the kitchen was having a very difficult time getting the main entrees out in a timely manner.  They ran out of one of the items we had ordered and only informed us when most of the dishes were brought to the table.  Another guest didn't receive her meal until 15 or so minutes after most of us received our meals.  Another guest of our table did not receive her side order of grilled chicken breast until we were pretty much done with our meals.  Perhaps the kitchen needs to be beefed up during the demanding times (ie weekend dinners, etc.) or they need to reduce the number of guests they can serve at any one time.\n\nSo, why the 3 not 2 stars?  Our server, of course!  Michelle tried her very best to accommodate us through the tough time.  It all started out well, though.  She took our drink orders, got the bread with their delicious tomato based dip served, took the appetizer order, got the appetizers delivered quickly, gave decent suggestions, and was attentive to all of our needs.  You could tell, she was getting pulled from all directions but that did not deter her from keeping her cool or smile!\n\nFood wise, everything was good and traditional.  They even made a custom dish for the wifey (fettuccine alfredo with prosciutto and peas).  Though everyone was happy with their respective meals, I was a bit disappointed.  The sauce served with the Duck special of the day was overly sweet.  That, combined with the richness of the duck made it difficult to really enjoyed.  I ate about half the meal and took the rest home.  The next day, I looked at the leftover and decided to throw it away.  I would have preferred a tart sauce to balance out the richness of the duck.  I remember when Il Fornaio offered a duck with a tart sauce that I really enjoyed.  We capped off our meal with 4 different desserts (chocolate pot de creme, creme brulee, apple tort, and tiramisu).  All but the pot de creme were very good.  The pot de creme was too thick and very concentrated.  One could not eat much of it unless they wanted to go into a chocolate coma!", "author": "Gene D."}

While we reviewed the extensive menu and lunch specials sheet, she brought bread, both white and wheat ...I think homemade, but dry. My sister loved the pur\u00e9ed red pepper spread and told me it would make the bread less dry. I loved the spread, but the bread was still dry. My sister had the Spaghetti Portofino which was perfectly-cooked al dente pasta with huge prawns in a light cream sauce. Mmmmm. I had to take a bite of hers before taking a bite of my own Spiazzo Salad. The salad was also pretty good. Thin slices of chicken breast, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and halved hard boiled eggs over a Caesar salad. The salad was huge and very fresh. The dressing was amazing. Creamy and lots of it. The salad would have been better with anchovies. Also, when the chicken was still warm, it was tasty. I only ate two slices because once the chicken cooled off, the dryness factor set in and became inedible. I left them on the plate.

I chose this place for my husband's birthday (3/6/17 is the day we went around 5pm) based on all of the positive reviews, but unfortunately i had a very different experience than most of these reviews. I will start off with the service - it was basically rushed and dismissive. Tonight was supposed to be a special night for my husband, and service was definitely lacking. Our waitress never asked us if we needed our drinks or wine refilled. I had to try to get her attention, and was unsuccessful at doing so. I finally caught the attention of a young waitress with short, dirty blonde hair and politely asked her if she could refill my soda. She seemed very bothered by this simple request, and when I thanked her she didn't acknowledge me with a smile or a simple \"sure\" or \"welcome \". She simply ignored me and slammed the glass on the table. After my husband and I had ordered our food, I went to the back to ask the waitress if a happy birthday dessert could be arranged, and she quickly dismissed me saying someone else will help me (right when I was talking she talked over me). The girl that helped me arrange the dessert was the same girl that refilled my drink. She could of asked my husbands name if she knew they would be singing happy birthday to him, (since when they were singing happy birthday to him they didnt know his name, and it felt very impersonal and rushed). We also didn't get any napkins when given dessert. Again,  it was impossible to flag someone down. She seemed very bothered by my request, and lacked any personality - no smile, nothing. For a restaurant with such high prices and after reading all the positive yelp reviews I seriously expected a lot more. \n\nThroughout my meal I constantly felt uncomfortable as the kitchen cook or whoever he is kept staring at me the whole time. Everytime I turned around he and another cook would stare. It was quite rude and extremely unprofessional.  \n\nI also called the restaurant earlier today and asked if the birthday dessert was comped, and the guy on the phone told me they don't do such a thing, yet I just saw in another review that the owner said this is something that is frequently done. Strange...\n\nIn regards to the food, everything was oversalted, and lacked flavor. There was not one thing I enjoyed besides my sprite. The food we got wasn't even worth 1/4 the price we paid. \n\nI'm summation, this restaurant could of gotten 3 or 4 stars, but due to the cold service I gave it one star, and will not be back.", "author": "Emily G."}

My tone was polite in letting the waiter know that the pasta sheets were really mushy and it was inedible. No apology. Clearly this colored our opinion of this restaurant. Dining isn't only about the food. \nThe petrale sole was pan-fried and done to perfection although the ice cream scoop potatoes on the side were not. \nWe also ordered the tortellini in a cream tomato sauce that was very good; the pasta was al dente and the filling creamy and well-seasoned.\nI and my family however won't be back nor will we recommend this restaurant to anyone.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-20", "description": "Awesome Italian! My two friends and I came here because I wanted to eat around the West Portal area and everywhere looked good but we were trying to stay around $15/person so this was our pick. We sat down and were immediately given our waters and bread very shortly after. Before I even talk about what we ordered, I'd like to give praise to their bread because it was DELICIOUS. It was obviously homemade because you don't get bread that soft and warm store bought. There was also this, I believe, sun dried tomato dip/sauce for the bread, and it complemented it so well. We all expected and wanted butter, but we killed our first serving of bread and sauce and they brought us another serving willingly (: \n\nSo we ordered and I got the fettucine alla genovese, and my friends got the fettucine con gamberoni and penne alla campagnola. My dish, the genovese was good! It had pesto and cherry tomatoes. It should've came with some mushrooms, but I personally can't eat them so I asked for them to be excluded. I enjoyed my dish because who on earth doesn't enjoy pesto&pasta? I feel like the mushrooms would have definitely elevated the dish, but I still enjoyed mine. The penne alla campagnola was solid. Our busser told us that was his favorite when we finished, but I thought it wasn't very special. I will commend the chicken in the dish, though, because it was super juicy and tender which was surprising. Last was my friend's fettucine con gamberoni, which I dipped into QUITE a few times. I think it's tied with my genovese, but it was in a different category since it was seafood-ey. \n\nLooking back on the dishes, they were all really good, but no more deserving than a really solid 4 stars. Spiazzo is authentic; they make their own bread & pasta, and actually grates you cheese from a block. They have more than kind and friendly service with above average food, but not deviating far from it. I would have definitely overhyped and gave it way better accolades if I didn't reflect on it just now because we went to eat here on beyond empty stomaches, which made everything taste better. I will still stand by the bread, however, because I kept eating that after our plates were taken away. Solid 4 stars!", "author": "Holly P."}

We made reservations for a Saturday evening, and showed up about half an hour early.  They were still very accommodating despite having a large birthday to attend to.\n\nOur waitress was fabulous and exemplified great customer service.  I wish I remembered her name to give her a shout out.  We ordered two fish dishes, the salmon and the sole.  The salmon wasn't to my liking, but my bf liked it (a little fishy).  The sole was great; it wasn't grilled though, it was made in a batter.  \n\nI had a glass of the sauv blanc and my bf had a glass of the pinot noir.  The sauv blanc was on point, but the pinot noir was served really warm.  I think it should have been chilled just a bit more.  \n\nThe dessert was the chocolate pot (forgot the actual name) and it was AMAZING.  It was a mix between fudge and a pudding.  I like chocolate, not chocolate-flavored things, but this was very delicious.  \n\nAlso to note - they serve Zanze's cheesecake here!!

Place is extremely crowded and busy, so one might expect some kinks and delays in the service.  However, this is the first time I have ever had a restaurant simply substitute a dish because they ran out of what was ordered.  Now the waiter said that the cooks simply didn't fill the order when they ran out of the rack of lamb, and that he was never informed until we asked when our dishes were coming (an hour after ordering). But then instead of asking what we would like to substitute he said that the cooks would substitute filet mignon for the lamb.  Really?  Without asking whether that is acceptable?  And when the dish came, it actually looked more like flank steak, which is probably why we got charged for the flank steak dish (CA-Tagliata).  I accept the fact that everyone makes mistakes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-09", "description": "Upon returning to this fine establishment it reminds me why I hold Spiazzo to a higher standard than most restaurants. And every time I visit they live up to their elevated level of quality, decadence and service. \n\nRecently they have added house made breadsticks to their welcoming bread sampler accompanied by their unique tapenade. The breadsticks aren't Olive Garden-esque doughy, nasty breadsticks but also aren't a traditional hard as a rock, pretzel-like breadstick. They're a slightly crispy well seasoned addition to their happy welcome. \n\nCannot say enough tremendous things about their specials menu. It's quite large without being overwhelming with too many options. And it changes seasonally which is the mark of a restaurant on top of utilizing the best ingredients available per time of year. \n\nOne of my favorite dishes is the cold seafood salad. The seafood is precisely cooked to maximize the fresh seafood flavor without being too robust or fishy. It's well dressed with a mustard, garlicky based sauce and pairs well with the bruschetta. \n\nThe Eggplant Parmesan is stacked with such grace and elegance that one would think the chef graduated from MIT. Not overloaded with marinara sauce and cheese, it allows the eggplant to breath and sing into the mouths of its diners. \n\nThe aspect I appreciate the most of Spiazzo is the ideology that the customer should be pleased with everything they order. If you request extra sauce, additional meats, no meat, extra cheese, pink sauce - even if it's not on the menu, they make it happen. The servers treat you like royalty and don't give you a nasty look if you ask for something outside of the normal realm of spaghetti and meatballs.", "author": "Rosalyn W."}

It wasn't until a couple of my friends put some serious limits on where to go for dinner one night that Spiazzo even came to mind.  Italian in this area of the city that's not Olive Garden?  Who knew Spiazzo was just one of a couple of places that could fit the bill?\n\nWalking in, I liked the feel of the restaurant - a little nicer than other casual, Italian joints but with a relaxed, neighborhood type of vibe.

I didn't like the prawns, but the scallops were okay and I liked the sauce.\n\nEven though I don't usually care about the bread a restaurant serves, Spiazzo's seemed a little weird.  Typically, fresh bread has a soft and fluffy core, but this one was dense and \"chunky\" (no other way to describe it).  Also, the service left me a little mixed - \"cold but efficient\" as my friend described.  Our waiter wasn't that friendly and didn't say more than he needed to, but he didn't mess up and was pretty quick.  Hard to complain when he didn't make a mistake.\n\nEven though it didn't really bowl me over, I can see why people might like Spiazzo.  For me, it's kind of like how Il Borgo was for me - fine if you're in or live by the area, but not somewhere I would go out to specifically.", "author": "Mike L."}

They brought out bread with individual butters and their house made dipping sauce which I believe is roasted veggies with a definite hint of bell pepper.\nOff top, I knew I wanted the polenta with Italian sausage (u can order with or without meat). This is the dish that keeps bringing me back to this place. You haven't tasted polenta until you've had it here with the generous portion of sausage and meaty mushrooms. It's also served with a whole head of roasted garlic on top that literally \"falls off the bone\" for lack of better words. Each clove comes out with ease and compliments the dish well. We ordered it as an appetizer but it can very well serve as a small meal.\nFor the main dish, I ordered the prawns with angel hair pasta (cappelini). To my surprise it also came with scallops! I didn't read that far into the description on the menu, I just stopped at jumbo prawns and ordered. Ooh wee, lemme tell you, the dish was so delicious, as we say in Hawaii, \"it broke my mouth\"! Both the scallops and the prawns were huge! No skimpin on the scrimp here!! I usually like to squeeze a lil lemon on my seafood, but didn't even have to here. The lemon, garlic, wine sauce was balanced to perfection.\nThe Mister ordered chicken marsala. You know it's good when the table is quiet. He didn't say a word except to offer me a bite. I kindly declined as my dish was all I needed and it was delectible.\nThe champagne comes in an individual small bottle and was cold and bubbly. Got my fix.\nThough there was limited time left, Oscar never rushed us, and made sure we received superior customer service regardless of the fact that they would be there cleaning up after us after closing time. This restaurant is cozy and comfortable, yet lightweight elegant and is definitely authentic Italian cuisine- Oscar relayed our order to the chefs speaking full blown Italian. They executed the order promptly and they perfectly pleased our palettes. Left a $20 tip for a $77 check. With the food, service, and ambiance, it was worth every penny.", "author": "Tiffany A."}

I am a creature of habit and always get the same thing at every restaurant I go to, and I come here for scampi lido. It. Is. So. Good. But this time as I opened my menu it looked different, and to my shock it wasn't on the menu anymore! Now, I'm not a dramatic person, but since my favorite pizza place (Paradise) down the street was recently sold and has already gone a little downhill, I was really worried the same was happening here (it's not - phew!). I asked the waitress with what I'm assuming was a horrified look on my face if they've changed the menu and she said they have a little bit. I asked if it would be possible to get the dish still and she said it should be fine. It came out and was really good, as always. At the end of our dinner she let me know that whenever I came in again it would be no problem to make it for me.\n\nThis might seem like something small, but I really, really appreciate you guys going out of your way for me when you didn't have to. This is why Spiazzo's is and continues to by my favorite restaurant. Thank you for once again making my birthday a happy one!", "author": "Melissa C."}

Water and bread with a tomato based dipping sauce immediately brought to the table.  Bread, similar to a foccacia, was heavy and lacked flavor.  You will need the sauce.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the carpaccio and the clams (7 to 8 clams) in a garlic/parsley/lemon broth.  The carpaccio was good while the clam broth was a bit to salty.\n\nFive entrees ranging from specials to pizza were ordered and none stood out.  Tri-Colore Pizza was average, Lamb Meatballs with Risotto sounded better than it tasted and meatballs were dense.  Seafood Pasta in a tomato sauce was large dish with clumpy pasta, Half Duck with Poached Pears and Risotto was a bit too sweet with the duck smothered in the sauce- I still have it in my fridge two days later...Veal In a Piccata type sauce was salty according to the sig other.\n\nOrdered Tiramisu and Tartuffe...liked the Tartuffe more than the Tiramisu.\n\nFood is average while we had excellent service.  Waitress was kind of funny as when she greeted us, we asked how was she doing and she answered she is \"normal\".  Interesting answer...  The place is nicely decorated which appealed to us rather than the pizzeria a half block away...looks can be deceiving.  Noticed the Owner/Manager is a bit intense as he was animately instructing his waitstaff.  Something I would have done away from Customer view...Interesting that we were seated comfortably at a table that seats six and two parties of five came in while we were finishing dessert.  The two parties were seated by the Owner/Manager at rectangular tables that normally seat four comfortably with a fifth seat at the end of a table.  They looked cramped and I am not sure if either party was offered our table knowing we were wrapping up...Thus, be mindful of YOUR dining experience....\n\nWill not be going back as there are so many other Italian options in the city.

In town for a short four days, I've been running around like mad trying to eat as much new food as I possibly could. \n\nWith my coupon in hand we rushed back from Berkeley late in the evening to make our 9:15 reservation. I usually don't like to arrive at restaurants a short time before they close so I was a little uneasy when we were a few minutes late. The place was almost empty; only a few tables finishing up their meals.\n\nDespite the late hour we were greeted with smiles and brought to a table. Our waiter was a wonderful Italian guy with a beautiful accent and all the attributes you could look for in an Italian waiter. Super friendly and extra willing to talk to us about the menu, give recommendations, and describe each dish as it came out (I'm in to food so I love this!).\n\nWe showed him the coupon as we ordered and he scanned it without any issue (sometimes staff are really confused with a coupon on an iPhone). He was no less nice or present knowing that we had 40 free dollars to spend. He encouraged us to order as soon as we could since the place was closing. Not pushy at all and he still talked to us about dishes for a while. \n\nTrying to spend the money we had, we ordered the Bruschetta to start. Unlike other places there were three different kinds; he told us about each. One was the traditional tomato & garlic, one was mushrooms with a pesto base, and the last was an eggplant medley with garlic and spices. All three were superb. I ordered the gnocchi, which were heavenly. Great flavor in the tomato based sauce and plenty of it (I hate dry pasta!) At first the portion looked a little small for the $14 price tag, but then I remembered that this was italian food and a little goes a long way. I ended up taking at least a third home.\n\nMy friend got the salmon pasta which I did not try as I don't eat salmon. She said it was wonderful. Some of the best she had had. The salmon was well mixed into the sauce so there were no major chunks. We finished off with Spumoni ice cream cake which was delightful.\n\nBy the time we were done it was at least 30 min after they closed. Our original waiter apologized and said that he had to leave but the cook would take care of us.  After he left the service was still wonderful. We wrapped things up and gave them an extra big tip.\n\n4 stars for the food/atmosphere/price.\n\nOutstanding service bumps it up to 5. I highly recommend this place.", "author": "Connor D."}

We made a reservation and still had to wait a half hour for table. Server never once looked at us... He kept rushing away and I had to signal to call him back. The bruschetta is wonderful: two large pieces of tomato bruschetta and two large pieces of mushroom bruschetta. Very fresh and tasty and filling. Do not order unless more than two to share.Asked for Parmesan on the pasta and he put it all over my seafood. Again - not attentive at all. The only thing that made this 3 stars was the food. I had excellent  scallop and shrimp scampi and it was a very generous portion; had to take half home. My husband had the stuffed pepper and reported it delicious and another large portion. So.

If your friend cooked you this food for free you'd think they did a good job and you'd be impressed. But this is a place where I spent $45 on entrees, and I was not. \n\nI had the stuffed pepper and my boyfriend had a seafood pasta dish. The pepper was full of veal and italian sausage, so why was it so gamy? And not just gamy, also kind of sour. It was not gross; in fact it tasted okay. But it was $20+. How'd it get gamy? There is a secret ingrediant in there that *needs* to come out! \n\nThe seafood pasta dish was a little more successful. It had prawns and scallops. It was okay, but the scallops were not tender. My guess is they were previously frozen, and then they were over cooked. I couldn't do better, but I also wouldn't charge myself that mark up! (It was also a special. Did they just get an especially good deal on frozen scallops?)\n\nOur service was good though. Friendly aussie who steered me away from pricier glasses of wine out of what I took to be geniune appreciation for Montepulciano. I appreciate that, I also enjoyed the wine. \n\nThe restaurant does have some cheaper pasta dishes, I'd give them a try.", "author": "Luke M."}

Yummy (Italian!) food, friendly service, great portions, flexible!\n\nOn a whim, I made reservations for Mother's Day dinner, my treat. I'd been here before with friends on a lunch date but I thought Mom would like this place. If she likes Olive Garden, she'd like authentic Italian, right?! The guy who picked up the phone and took my info was really welcoming. There's polite, and then there's reeeeally welcoming. He was the latter.\n\nFast forward to 2 days later. Parking was pretty easy, considering it was 6pm on West Portal on a Sunday, Mother's Day no less. We parked virtually in front of Spiazzo and walked in to find our table waiting for us. Our waiter had an Italian accent, which really impressed my dad for some reason. I guess being served by SFSU students at Olive Garden doesn't quite cut it for him. I had a special request for a sauce replacement and he was happy to oblige. He kept offering us plates so we could share. We didn't wanna give them more dishes to clean up afterward but he insisted. Everything went smoothly and our water glasses never went past the halfway point.\n\nWe were never pressured or asked to order dessert, but we did. We ordered the cannoli and their cappuccino. Again, they were accomodating with any specifications we had. My mom isn't a coffee drinker, but she'll want a cup every once in a while to go with whatever she's eating. We asked for them to make it into a light cappuccino, and they did so happily. Like I said before, great service.

The staff were extremely friendly and hospitable, especially as we were famished and unfamiliar with the menu. The \"vibe\" or milieu\nof this place is very welcoming and positive.\nThe pizzas are generously sized personal, thin crusted creations with just a few very fresh toppings that don't overwhelm and a light sprinkling of cheese-basically the style of pizza that we had in Europe. The prosciutto, artichoke, and kalamata olive was heavenly. The fuitta de mar included  A LOT of very fresh clams ( still in the shells!), scallops, Calamari, shrimps, and mussels. The sausage pizza came with whole links which were unusually split lengthwise.\n\nI will save you the time and just recommend that you order the mindblowing salmon penne pasta which is served in a creamy Parma Rosa style sauce.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-10-30", "description": "This review concerns not the food, which I would evaluate at about 2.5 stars, but a serious flaw in communication among the staff that resulted in a very poor experience for our party. As in some other reviews here, our party intended to use vouchers for the meals - two of them, applied to our party split into two groups (and seated as far apart as you like). We suspected the restaurant may have a problem with this, so we called them in advance and explicitly asked whether it was permitted, and were told it was fine. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were again told it was fine. Only after the food orders had been taken and preparation was underway were we then informed that it was not fine at all, and that they'd only be accepting one voucher. The problem is not the voucher policy, but the fact that the staff told us one thing up front, twice, and then changed their message well after the meals had been ordered. A third of our party left, and despite the sincere efforts of the waiter, the meal's atmosphere was very unpleasant.\nWe've eaten at this restaurant many times because we live very near it, but the quality of the food is average when compared to other restaurants of its type in San Francisco. It is therefore the small touches and manners that matter the most.", "author": "David C."}

On a tangent, anyone else bothered by the notion that more and more of my white friends know more about Asian religion and spirituality than say, ooo...actual Asians? Ask a hipster what a chakra is, and he/ she will most likely tell you.

Salmon could've been a bit more tender.\nZuppa-something. the seafood and pasta dish in tomato soup base. The soup is the best part, and be smart and ask for more foccacia bread to mop it up.\nSeafood combo pasta in white cream sauce. - very generous portions.\nthree meat combo- italian sausage, chicken palliard, and lamb shank- not bad..the sausage was a bit salty, the chicken a smidge dry and i wish the rack of lamb was cooked medium, but overall, not a bad plate, and worth the value. \nChicken marsala - classic dish was good, as evident from the person finishing the entire plate and licking it clean.\nTiramisu cake..nice, sweet, but wish it had more rum flavoring. \nSweet polenta and white chocolate pudding. a very heady and interesting combo- not for everyone, but you should try it at least once.", "author": "Jerry C."}

It was a Saturday night around 7:30 p.m. and we ended up at Spiazzo on a fluke, after choosing not to wait 30-40 minutes for Latin American food across the street.  \n\nSERVICE:  We walked in and they seemed pretty busy, but we were seated right away for a table of four,  right in the front near the window.   Perfect.  We were met with friendly, warm and VERY attentive service from the get go and this was consistent throughout our meal.  Their timing was great from refreshing our waters, to taking our order and clearing plates-- the service was neither over-bearing nor did we for a moment feel we'd been forgotten about, which can so often be the case at restaurants, especially on a Saturday night.  \n\nFOOD:  The bread they brought out was so fresh and we LOVED the olive dip that came out with it.  We ordered a Pizza Margherita, the Risotto, Zuppa Di Pesce and two items off of their specials-- an entree and an appetizer, none of which I can remember the names of, at the moment.  Everything came out together shortly after finishing our appetizer.  Everything was absolutely spot on!   Flavorful and fresh.  Unfortunately, we were all too full to have dessert.  Had we not had a show to get to, we would have ordered some desserts to go.  \n\nWhen I looked at the check, which came to $89.51, I whispered out loud to my family, \"That's it?\"  I was easily expecting it to come to much more for all that we got and left a nice tip.    \n\nWe will definitely return again when we are back in town and craving Italian. We would love to further explore their menu.  We will be sure to give ourselves plenty of time so we can relax into the experience a little more.  We didn't have to tell them we had a show to get to-- their service was so great, but we all agreed it was a place to come back to when we aren't feeling bound to a deadline to get somewhere else.  \n\nI have been lucky in my travels to have eaten in some fabulous restaurants in some great cities-  NYC, Seattle, Portland, L.A. and Minneapolis and have had a yelp account for years, but just never got around to actually posting a review-- mostly just using the site to find restaurants.

I have not experienced a fraud as systematic since the subprime crisis of 2008.  Similarly no one will go to jail, no one will be held accountable.   Let me explain.   My girlfriend and I went out for a post-fight dinner.  We thought an Italian dinner would allow for truth and reconciliation.  She ordered the fettuccini lobster.   However instead of lobster it was imitation crab.  The horror, the deception.  (Note my girlfriend is an aficionado of seafood having spent summers commercial fishing with her father.   She is like a young Jacque Cousteau). When she pointed the error out the owner did not acknowledge the culinary fraud perpetrated.   Let me absolutely unequivocal - I shutter to think about the allergic reaction that could have taken place.   The owner should be ashamed as he has tarnished the gastronomic delights of Italy and challenged culinary nirvana.  This west Portal establishment should avoided at all costs.

The pasta and broccoli became mush and the chicken was completely devoid of any moisture. This seriously is one of the most simple dishes that any half decent cook shouldn't be even remotely capable of messing up every aspect. \n\nTo make matters worse the service was awful. Our server got half of our group's orders wrong. True the restaurant was filled, but it was filled with people above 60... No offense: but seniors do not require so much attention that the waiter would be completely frazzled when he gets to our table that he couldn't tell the difference between salmon and seafood. \n\nSo we got our dishes and my friend noticed that it was the wrong dish, and the old italian man who i thought was the owner of the restaurant, but i guess he's just some random senior waiter, exclaimed \"I can't believe he made the same mistake again\", referring to the server who took our orders. \n\nThankfully, to the restaurant at least, one of my friends who we were waiting for, but never had the intention of eating, walked into the restaurant and decided to sit down with us. The old man sold him the dish, (my friend usually falls for the sales pitch), and was vague about whether or not we had to pay for their mistake. \n\nBy the time the receipt came, we were all already so disappointed with our meals that we couldn't take any more losses to our dignity. Lo and behold, the incorrect dish was on the bill. It was pouring that day, and we were already late so we paid just the meal prices but no tip.

It was good to see the place doing decent business for a Tuesday.\n\nWe were immediately greeted by a genuinely welcoming host.  The restaurant felt warm and inviting, with good lighting and an open kitchen.\n\nOur waitress was a tall, young lady who said it was her first day on the job.  We wouldn't have guessed it because she was great - attentive and friendly.  A plate of warm focaccia and wheat bread soon arrived at our table, along with glasses of water.\n\nWe ordered the Italian sausage and pepperoni pizza as a starter to share.  The pizza gets a solid \"A\"!  The crust was perfectly thin and crispy/chewy, with a an outside ring/crust that seemed buttery.  The tomato sauce on the pizza could have had more flavor or zest; perhaps it was a simple tomato sauce rather than sauce that was spiked with herbs/spices such as oregano, basil.  There was just the right amount of cheese and topings on it so you get a perfect mouthful with every bite. We definitely would order pizza again here, quite a few other on the menu to try.  It was a good size pizza, a bit too much for two, but perfect for 3 people as an appetizer.\n\nFor an entree, we ordered spaghetti and clams in tomato sauce.  Usually you see linguine & clams on menus, done with a white wine and garlic sauce. The spaghetti and clams dish here had outstanding flavor - that really pops in your mouth; we were glad to have a chance to try something different. The deep rich flavor might be from the slices of lightly browned (roasted?) garlic.  We would rate this a solid \"A\" dish if the spaghetti were more al dente.\n\nThe other entree was the fettucini and shrimp in tomato sauce.  This dish was pretty good, with lots of chunky tomatoes in the sauce. However, having tasted the sauce in the clams spaghetti dish, the sauce in this dish seemed muted in comparison :(  The fettucini, however, was near perfectly al dente.  If we order this again, we would ask for the sauce they use for the spaghetti alla vongole dish!\n\nPrices are moderate here, and well worth it given the generous portion size.

My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. I hightly recommend anyone visiting Spiazzo to try it!\n\nFor my main dish, I ordered the spaghetti portofino. YUM!!!! The spaghetti was cook perfectly. They did not skimp on the shrimp and scallop. The sauce wasn't heavy and didn't overpower the dish. My bf ordered a scallop dish (I don't remember the name of the it) that came with veggies and angel hair pasta. His scallops were wonderfully cooked! It had a nice color and sear to it. And the sauce......YUMMY!! \n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone. I will definitely be going back there.", "author": "-Kelb H."}

You can order the exact same meal just a few weeks apart and the result isn't remotely similar. We live in the area and hear the same from neighbors who have dined here over the years. Disappointing because the owners are very courteous and provide good service. However there is obviously a consistency issue in the kitchen.", "author": "Cody L."}

The boys and my Mom decided to come here last night as it was getting pretty late and they wanted Italian food. I didn't care one way or the other.\n\nAlthough it was 8:15 on a Saturday night, and pretty full, they seated us right away. Mom goes there often enough that everyone who greeted her treated her like family. I was surprised that the owner and wait staff remembered me, even before Mom arrived, but that is just how friendly and warm they are there! \n\nAs people has already mentioned, the service is amazing, and as soon as you are seated, you are greeted with a hello, menus, and the most wonderful home made breads and red pepper tapenade. OMG, it was so yum! \n\nThe boys knew what they wanted right away from having having spotted another diner's dish as they walked to the table...they ordered the penned al salmone. They loved it! These boys are 9 and 11. The older one is a teen but did not join us. Mom ordered off of the dinner speacials, some chicken, pesto ravioli, which she loved. I, needed something with meat, ordered the grilled skirt steak in balsamic vinegar sauce. \n\nFor dessert, the boys ordered creme brule' and some yummy chocolate ice cream cake concoction.

The family wanted to go somewhere inexpensive and cozy, not some big chain, something \"San Francisco\" (since Mom and Dad were going to be driving up from Mountain View and wanted to go somewhere that would be easy for them to get it and drive through the whole city.  Brother and his girlfriend live up in laurel Heights but had never been here before) and somewhere where the majority of of party had not been to yet.  So our choice was easy, SPIAZZO'S!!!\n\ni called the night before and made reservations for 7 @ 7:30 on a Friday night.  Not a problem I was told, God I love it when things go my way.  i spent most of the day at work on Friday thinking about what i would get at Spiazzo's that night.  And all that we ordered was delicious and keeping within my high expectations for Spiazzo's.\n\nI had a Ceasar salad to start.  Fresh, crisp lettuce and a tangy flavorful dressing.  Very pleased.  We all shared 2 orders of the Bruschetta.  And I have to say that I had never had this before, BUT I WILL EVERYTIME I COME HERE FROM NOW ON!!  The order comes with 2 traditional bruschetta pieces with tomatos and evoo and baslcamic, but it also comes with 2 mushrooms bruschetta pieces.  THIS WAS WHAT GOT ME!  Absolutely to die for.  I could have ate 2 or 3 more of those, no problem at all.  As my main course I had my staple favorite.  Fettucini con Gamberoni ... Great at usual!!  Plump perfectly cooked prawns and spicy sauce.\n\nMy main man got the dinner special chicken imperratore.  This is usually one of his favorites, but this time it came out just a little too cooked.  But he still loved it and licked his plate clean.  Mom had the Chicken Piccatta, which is devoured and raved about.  Dad had some sort of pasta Portofino dish (shirmp and scallops in a light wine sauce) which he also loved.  Littlest brother had one of the pizzas (Ham and artichoke and olives) and I couldn't have gotten a piece if I tried! He loved it!\n\nFinished off with a Creme Bruelle, beautiful!", "author": "Chelsea C."}

Of all the years I lived here, I have never visited Spiazzo until tonight. My parents were feeling something European tonight, so we decided to dine somewhere close to home. \n\nUpon arriving, we were warmly welcomed and immediately seated. Mind you, it's a Saturday evening during prime dinner hours. The restaurant was packed, but the servers were quickly to make adjustments so that we wouldn't have to wait outside in the cold. \n\nDinner consisted of two antipasto servings - The Chef's special seafood salad and an assortment of mozzarella, prosciutto, bruschetta, red and green bell peppers, and artichokes. Big portions, enough for four people to share. Nicely seasoned and very filling to start with.\n\nMerlot. Best way to go. My dad also really enjoyed his Pinot. \n\nMy entree tonight was the Chef's special risotto consisting of Italian sausage, mushrooms and pears. Yes, pears. I never would have thought of including sliced pears in risotto, but once I tasted the dish, it made sense. Delicious. I boxed half of my meal to bring home for lunch.\n\nDessert was tiramisu and a plate of biscotti. The tiramisu was an extremely HUGE portion, especially for the price you're paying. Typically I'd expect a serving of 2'' by 2''. This was more of 4.5'' by 4.5''. Enough for four people to share. Biscotti was good, but very difficult to chew if you didn't have a hot beverage to dip it in. Be sure to order a cappuccino if you decide to order this. \n\nOverall great service, great food, great prices. Will definitely be coming back again.", "author": "Teresa Y."}

Afterwards, I commented how I remembered why we didn't return.  Like some of the other reviews, the food isn't bad, but it also isn't good or memorable.  It is no better than what we are able to make at home ourselves.  The gnocchi, spaghetti and spaghetti with clams were bland and needed salt.  Our guest ordered tricolore pizza and said it was good.

We looked online before going to see what was on their menu and there were two lamb dishes one $22.95 the other $25.95.  The voucher stated we could have two entrees worth $24.95 each.  It also stated you had to call before going, make a reservation and let restaurant know you had a voucher. When we got there the manager/owner, not sure which, gave us a menu which did not have any entrees of a higher amount, certainly no lamb, and he stated the more expensive items were specials of the day and we could not order them.  We honestly feel he had special menus ready for anyone who purchased a voucher!  We were told we could get two entrees, share a salad and share a dessert.  I told him with the entrees on that menu, pastas, personal pizzas and a couple of chicken items our total savings at end of meal would be bout $5.00 not the 50% off as indicated on voucher.  He told us how did we expect him to make any money if he allowed us to purchase the more expensive meals. My husband and I are professionals who own a home in West Portal and eat out about 3 times a week and a few times have used Living Social vouchers and never had any problems.  From my understanding restaurants participate in these promotional offers not to make money but to acquire new customers.\n\nWe left, did not care for his attitude and thought he was being dishonest.  We went down the street to the new Restaurant Trattoria de Vittorio, which was outstanding.  We paid full price for meals and a bottle of wine, the money was not the issue it was the principle of it.\n\nOh yes and when we got home we went online to Spiazzo's website and looked at their regular daily menu, not specials, and both lamb dishes were still on the menu.\n\nI will never set foot in that restaurant again and will tell all our friends neighbors and family what occurred.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-03", "description": "Came here last night for dinner with family, made reservations via OpenTable for 7pm for a table of 7. First off, this place is small. There are no big tables, each table is a 4 person booth/table. But they put us in the back in a booth and they tacked on a table so it could accommodate 7 people. Definitely not a good place to come for big parties larger than 8. \n\nAlso, this place is busy on a Monday night! It was pretty packed when we first got there and more and more people kept coming in as the tables were turned over. That must be a good sign that it's this busy on a weeknight. The patrons are more of an older, sophisticated, wine-drinking type of crowd, not your family-type of joint. \n\nEach table gets a plate of foccaccia-like bread with marinara-like sauce and butter. The bread was delicious, light and fluffy, but not exactly like foccacia-texture. Though I do think it was suppose to be foccaccia. The marinara was cool that they give you a sauce instead of the usual butter, but it didn't taste exactly like just marinara and it was orange... I went with the butter instead. Others in my party liked it, I didn't care for it too much. \n\nOn to the food... every dish that came out looked so yummy and delicious and I don't think anyone had a complaint about the food. They have good size portions especially! And the price is totally reasonable! I ordered the Zuppa di Pesce. I know it says Zuppa in it and it was more of a soup-like item, I just wish it had more pasta and less soup. I guess that would be more of a Tutto di Mare. But either way it was delicious and lots of fresh yummy seafood and the soup broth was so good! My husband's aunt ordered the clams and pasta dish, and the clams are SOO huge! Not your typical linguine and clams item. And it had a lot of pasta with some sort of sauce. My husband ordered the lamb meatballs with risotto, which did not look like risotto. It was rice i swear. But the lamb meatballs were very good, not gamey at all, fluffy with breadcrumbs and also crispy on the outside from searing it. My mother-in-law got the salmon pasta and she raved about how good it was also. So much pasta and salmon mixed into it. My husband's cousin got the ravioli with spinach and chicken I believe and the ravioli were also a large portion size! So you're eating more filling than just the pasta. \n\nOne downside to the place, the service of our waiter. He was definitely italian, but he was ALL over the place. He took the order of my mother-in-law then he walked away to take another table's order. Then he never returned to us until we beckoned another waiter. Then in the middle of taking our large party order, he refilled our bread and sauce! He definitely tried and worked hard, he just seemed very scattered-brain. \n\nParking was easy with street parking in front, or maybe we got lucky.

Open Late!\n\nI arrived at Spiazzo after looking for another char-broiled hamburger joint.  The place was closed but Spiazzo was just around the corner.  Plus I spied Spiazzo on the first pass and wonder if they had service as poor Spiedo in San Mateo.  Then there was the other thing.  You know,, The thing.  The thing I have with Italian food.  I'm generally a sucker for a plate of good pasta set before me.  The lure of Spiazzo was just too much to resist.\n\nWhen I walked int the door it was already 9:20 PM so I was expecting to hit the pavement pretty quickly.  Instead I was welcomed and told there was plenty of time left.  (First star easily give for staying open late).   The smile and warm greeting set a nice tone.\n\nSince I was alone I wanted a window seat to pass the time watching the other girls passing by.  Spiazzo accommodated my request.  Water and wine soon followed   I was surprised how quickly it came since the place definitely was not empty.  Still being tied mentally to the hamburger lust I was sort of lost for what I wanted to eat.  So a glass of Pinot Noir seemed to be a good middle of the road choice.  Even by the glass the Pinot was good.  Not something I can say for every restaurant.\n\nThe table setting is your average mid-scale SF style with cloth napkins  The only negative was a plastic tumble used for the water.  It served the purpose but looked a little cheap next to the wine glass.  Still I can't really complain because everything was clean neat and tidy.\n\nBread was dropped by the table  Due to the Americanization of Italian eateries butter was brought. (Ack!)  Luckily the people at the table next to me had just left so I was able to steal the olive oil and balsamic.   Which it turns out was better for the bread anyway.  The bread was like a Focaccia bread without the \"cia\".  The slices as well as the rest of the loaf were extremely dry and brittle.  Had I tried to use the butter the bread would have fallen into crumbs.   The oil and balsamic just made the bread better.  (but still fell apart on the way to my mouth).  The bread's flavor was good though.\n\nI finally gave up on trying to decide on the choice for my meal and decided to go with the ole standby choices of Insalata Caprese (Capri Salad) and  Tortellini Salsa Rosa (tortellini with red Tuscan sauce).   Every \"standard\" Italian place in Kali generally has these two choices on the menu.  They are generally safe and comfortable dishes with a nice little flavor and a bit of tang.\n\nOne pause for a menu note.  Spiazzo 's menu is way too busy!  Like they were trying cram in all things, for all people, at all times of the day.  I suggest splitting off the dinner and lunch menus.  No one likes to read tiny typeface in a darkened window area after the sun goes down.\n\nThe waitress, ( Ismini.  such a cool name for a lovely person ) brought the salad quickly.  Overall it was good.  The only problem was with the tomatoes.  The slices were cut too thin for my preference and the color could have also been better.  Especially for a a dish that features raw tomatoes as a visual component.  Otherwise the Insalata Caprese was done right with a good mozzarella and nice leaves of fresh basil.  I already had the oil and balsamic at the table and these top the salad very well.\n\nI finished my salad fairly quickly and the next surprised was the quick arrival of the pasta.  The pasta itself was good.  Cooked to perfection.  The cheese filling of the tortellini tasted great.  The Salsa Rosa was pretty good.  Certainly tasty enough.  Maybe just a bit too separated but that may have been the style the chef wanted.  Ismini presented some pre-grated Parmesan cheese  for topping the dish.  I would have like to have seen it grated at the table for the price charged for the meal.\n\nThe last thing I had was a cup of perfect cappuccino.  yes perfect.  Sized nicely.  Fresh made.  Perfect foam.  Excellent taste.   Raw brown sugar at the table.  Perfect temperature.  Perfect texture.  I would stop by again just for the window and a cappuccino.  Being served again by the pleasant Ismini would be nice too!\n\nMeal Price on 2009-05-22:\n$ 6.95 - Glass of Pinot Noir\n$ 8.95 - Insalata Caprese\n$12.95 - Tortellini Salsa Rosa \n$ 2.95 - Cappuccino\n$ 3.02 - Tax\n$34.82 - Total\n$ 6.50 - Tip  (forgot that you don't tip the alcohol)\n$41.32 - Grand Total\n\nValue?   If Spiazzo improves the points I have listed above that I would say the value is about average.  If there is no improvement then......\n\nAbout the location,,, yea you might have a little problem parking.   This is SF people!  A minuscule walk of 150 feet and you are sure to fine a spot.  Muni and cabs are right out front too.\n\nI will give a 3 and 7/16 stars for this visit and recommend Spiazzo as a good place to take a date for a late dinner.  I will actually check off four since they are open late.", "author": "Chris R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-11-07", "description": "My husband and I have been loyal Spiazzo customers for over 20 years. If you want gourmet Italian food in an unrushed, romantic atmosphere, go somewhere else. If you want unpretentious food in generous proportions at reasonable prices served promptly, Spiazzo will fill the bill. \n\nThis restaurant is very popular with moviegoers (Cinearts at Empire is just down the street), and is always packed and noisy on weekends. You'll have a better experience if you can come on a weekday, when the pace is more leisurely and you might have a chance at getting one of their comfortable upholstered booths. Service here has always been very good. The servers are friendly and efficient.\n \nI recommend the following dishes, which have been consistently good over the years: Minestrone (vegetarian), Spaghetti Bolognese (the best I've ever had), Salmon Fantasia, Spaghetti Calabrese (vegetarian), Pollo Piccatina, Chicken Marsala, the grilled Pork Loin and the Pizza Vegetale (If you are a vegan, they'll gladly omit the cheese).  All the pizzas are baked in a wood-fired oven. Occasionally on the specials menu they offer Pappardelle with Lamb Sauce. Don't miss this dish; it's heaven on a plate!\n\nUnless you like tart flavors, I would avoid the fish dishes that are prepared with lemon sauce and capers or artichokes. The kitchen tends to go a little too heavy on the lemon for my taste. I also don't care for the fish dishes that are prepared with spicy tomato sauce; the strong flavor of the sauce overwhelms the delicate taste of fish, and it's tough to find a good wine pairing. \n\nSome have complained about the Caesar Salad, but I happen to like it. It's a bit small and unpretentious, but has a pleasantly tangy dressing (and no anchovies). Even better is the more generously-sized Insalata Etrusca, with marinated white beans, shaved parmesan and fennel on a bed of mixed greens with a tart balsamic vinaigrette.\n\nFor dessert, I highly recommend the sinfully delicious house-made tiramisu or the chocolate pot de creme. I also like the chocolate brownie cake, the spumoni cake and chocolate-dipped biscotti. The cannoli is OK, but it's imported frozen from Italy so it doesn't taste as fresh as a locally-made product.\n\nIn 20 years, I've only had to send one dish back -- a fish dish that had an oily \"off\" taste. The waiter said it was fresh, and I believe him, but it just didn't taste right. No problem, no attitude, they were happy to prepare a different entree for me.\n\nFor those who say they've had a bad experience at Spiazzo, all I can say is that either you are awfully hard to please or you must have been there on a rare off night. Spiazzo may not be the trendiest restaurant on the block, but it has a loyal following, and for good reason.", "author": "Midge A."}

I could eat that stuff all day... \n\nWe went for lunch. Initially we really liked the place, as it reminded us of a good Italian place we had been to in NYC during our last visit.  Quaint, not noisy, the two of us sat in a comfy booth towards the back. \n\nI ordered the tortellini soup (4.95) and the canneloni lunch (9.95)...also the caesar salad (7.95) and the fusilli with sausage (9.95 or thereabouts.) \n\nBoth arrived REALLY quickly (to our surprise- almost 'too fast'.)-- and my soup was just tepid-hot, with four tortellini floating in the centre. TEPID SOUP is NOT OKAY in my book. Soup should arrive steaming burning hot. Period. Unless it's gazpacho but I hate gazpacho so it's not even an option. The caesar salad looked like it had been made at a Sizzler, just a bunch of tossed romaine shreds doused in cheese and dressing. \n\nThe canelloni were actually OK- of course I was REALLY hungry at the time and I was craving anything warm... it had a good combination of cheese filling and sauce, so I totally ate the whole thing. The fusilli with sausage, however, arrived almost over-cooked and the sauce itself was nothing I couldn't have just made at home.... we were pretty disappointed! \n\nI don't see this place as a neighborhood gem at all.. perhaps  it is more like that Cheap But Nice Pearl Necklace that Aunt Millie gave you for your birthday when you turned 18.... However, I admit that it seems a lot of the people from the area do like it, and I understand why... large portions, good bread, and relatively low prices.

The service was attentive, so that's always good too.\n\nI ordered the Pizza Quattro Stagioni: prosciutto, kalamata olives, artichokes, and mushrooms.  Not realizing that \"stagioni\" means \"seasons,\" I was a bit surprised when I saw the pizza, each quarter covered with only one of the items listed above.  Basically, it was like getting 1/4 artichoke pizza, 1/4 mush pizza, etc.  I was hoping for a bit of a mixture instead.\n\nNonetheless, the pizza itself was tasty if not a bit too cheesy.  The crust is thin and the cheese thick, so I used a fork/knife method to eat.", "author": "Naoko M."}

Five of us went there on a Friday eventing 7pm, it was crowded, everyone's convivial, fine.  To drink I ordered carbonated water (agua com gas).  They brought a glass of sparkling water, not a bottle with a label, and as soon as I drank it, I knew why.  It had a heavy taste of chlorine.  I'm used to drinking filtered water at home, so the chlorine taste was quite distinctive to me.   They must carbonate their own tap water to save costs.   They should at least use filtered water.   Terrible taste, IMO.    Next complaint:  the salad was so drenched in oil it was inedible, really.   The waiter never asked what we wanted on it,  it just came with a ton of oil.  None of us could eat it.  We just left it.  The rest of the food was okay.  One additional note:  not much choice for vegans.  Roasted potatoes and salad, that's about it.

Being the geniuses that we are, no one thought about making reservations for a party of 5 at 7pm on a weekday. Thankfully, the restaurant was not full (usually a bad sign...) and we were seated immediately by a lovely waitress that was very accommodating. Not only did we not make reservations, we had the nerve to bring in a birthday cake and requested them to store it for us while we surprised our friend who worked across the street. I must give them high praises for their friendliness and high-quality customer service.\n\nAfter a terrible attempt at ambushing our friend, we brought him over to Spiazzo and were again warmly greeted. A charming, older Italian gentleman handed menus to us and made suggestions. From the vibe that I got, he is either the manager or the owner.\n\nWe ordered the Penne Al Salmone, Fussilli Allas Genovese, Spaghetti Portofino, Pizza Tricolore, and Pizza Spiazzo. Each dish was extremely hearty and tasty. There was a good amount of salmon in the Penne Al Salmone but it was strange to see the salmon flaked and mixed with the pasta, instead of being served as a whole salmon fillet or even chunks. My friend said the pesto was good, but was rather heavy. She ended up eating barely half the dish. The Spaghetti Portofino came with a few plump, juicy shrimp and fresh, lightly seared scallops. The sauce however seemed really thick and creamy and should have been lighter to allow the fresh seafood to shine. The pizzas were good but not mind-blowing. It had a thin crust and came piping-hot. There was the perfect amount of cheese and the various toppings added the perfect amount of texture and savoriness to the lovely sauce and melty mozzarella.\n\nAfter we finished the dishes (or rather, the ladies at the table packed their half-finished meals in take-home boxes), we asked the nice Italian gentleman to bring out the cake. As sweet as can be, he brought out the cake and some plates and silverware. Then, he led us in a rousing rendition of Happy Birthday. However he threw us a curveball and began to sing in Italian. It was extremely charming and endearing. I wish he was my uncle, but I will avoid my uncle issues in this post... To make things even better, when the bill came, we were surprisingly not charged a cake-cutting fee, as is standard at most other institutions. We felt obliged to tip generously and thank him profusely. \n\nBottom line, the food was good and the service was amazing. If the dishes were lighter and the pizza was more spectacular, it would be receiving five stars from me.\n\nThank you, old nameless Italian gentleman.

Generous portions were served, but only one was not finished. I had the gnocchi, which had classic flavors that left me pleased. It was actually better than the gnocchi that I had in Italy. Last but not least, make sure you save room for dessert. Make sure everyone gets something different, I highly recommend the chocolate truffle.", "author": "Margo D."}

I've been fortunate enough to have traveled to Italy before and every time I bite into Spiazzo's Penne al Salmone, I'm instantly whisked away to the picturesque restaurant along the coast where I first tried this dish. I've never had the made-in-Italy counterparts of other dishes on the menu and therefore can't speak to their authenticity. I can, however, tell you that they are delicious as well. The Spaghetti alla Vongole ranks among the best renditions I've had. The sauce is well-seasoned, brimming with flavor, and with the perfect consistency. I adore the generous use of roasted garlic in the rosso sauce. The clams are also sizable, in contrast to the puny ones I have had on many occasions at other establishments. The service is exceptional. Even during a busy service, the staff are attentive, friendly, and never try to rush you. When you dine here, it's easy to forget that you're a restaurant where the food costs the same as (sometimes even less than) Olive Garden, which I assure you will not taste half as good.", "author": "Jenny C."}

We've been coming here for years and the food consistency hasn't gone down, nor have the prices expanded ridiculously. \n\nAntipasto sampler: bruschette (one tomato, one marinated mushroom), prosciutto, fresh mozz, canellini beans, marinated artichoke hearts, basil-all good, fresh tasting. Decently priced. \n\nI usually order the penne al salmone: which is a pretty good sized serving of penne with a salmon tomato cream sauce. Not too rich or oversized. Last time there, I got the last order of osso bucco and savored that winey, tomatoey, meaty sucker to the end. The veal was tender and easily fork cut. I've never had a real clunker meal here; everything is fresh, cooked to order and toothy. That being said, I have to mention that the pizza could be better. It's never to the point where I don't want to eat it-but don't come to Spiazzo for the pizza. The crust doesn't quite get that blistered crispiness of a real 500-600 degree oven. If you have small children, steer them towards the spaghetti bolognese and they'll be happy campers. \n\nMy bias also comes from the waiter that used to be employed here who gave me a Hello Kitty notepad when I was 12 or 13, when I admired the one he was using to take orders on. They are also Italian owned and run. That my friends, is a NEIGHBORHOOD restaurant.", "author": "Alexis W."}

I don't know if they changed chefs or what, but the pasta I had last night was very mediocre. It was pesto tortellini and the sauce was pretty bland which meant I had to salt it.  It was also kind of creamy which pesto shouldn't be, and the menu didn't mention it being a creamy pesto so that kind of threw it off...also, the portion was less than satisfying; way too small. After I finished, I sopped up the leftover sauce with some bread (something I rarely do at then end of a meal unless I'm still pretty hungry). I don't understand what's with all the skimping.\n\nAnd this is what really skewed my opinion of Spiazzo's...I ordered my spiazzo favorite- Zabaglione- and it was absolutely terrible.  I don't know if it was old or what, but the recipe was so different from how I remember it being that I almost didn't finish it and I was tempted to send it back.  It was mealy (think cream of wheat texture) and tasted weird. I ate it all because they were busy and I didn't have the energy to complain, but I won't be ordering that again....it's sad to see your menu favorite take a quality nose-dive.", "author": "L.

When we walked in, I noticed right away that the restaurant was packed. Always a good sign in my eyes. Everyone was extremely busy, but they quickly cleared a table and seated me and my companion. Warm bread and water were quickly brought to our table. We had just enough time to peruse the menu before the waitress came over to take our orders. We asked what the restaurant was known for (as is our custom) and the waitress quickly apologized and said it was her first night. She had come in for training and the restaurant was so busy that the just set her free to get started. Nothing like diving right in. We ordered the Portabello and Spinach salad to share for a first course and Gnocchi and Lamb Risotto for our main courses. Even though the place was busy, our salad came very quickly. The flavors were great. The portabello was meaty and grilled to perfection and the dressing was made from what tasted like a very good balsamic vinegar. The spinach was fresh and crunchy. Thumbs up for this dish. The main courses came not too long after. The Gnocchi was very good. They were firm, but not too heavy, and served in a tomato sauce with prosciutto and mushrooms. The Lamb Risotto had an earthy flavor (due to the presence of much nutmeg) which I love. The only drawback was that it was slightly over salted. The portions were huge with enough left over for 2 lunches the next day. All in all a great experience.\r\nOn a funny side note, the couple sitting next to us were quite a floor show. Obviously drunk from too much wine, the woman kept getting louder and louder. Nothing the server did was good enough for her as she chastised her for \"not having enough fun with the Parmesan cheese.\" When her entree came (some kind of chicken with a white sauce) she took one bite and called over the server. \"Does this sauce have flour in it? I specifically requested the sauce to have no flour in it.\" Now - I don't know about you guys - but I've never seen a white sauce made without flour, at least not in your average Italian restaurant. Now, I understand that some people have serious food allergies and to that I am very sympathetic. However, this woman had been eating foccacia by the fistfuls earlier. Hello? Bread is made from FLOUR! Anyway, I guess you had to be there.\r\nIf you are in West Portal, check this place out.", "author": "Jamie M."}

I was kinda skeptical while I was skipping through the restaurants on west portal strip however the whole dining experience turned out to be out of this world. It looks pretty dark and not very welcoming outside but the table tops are nicely lit and napkins are precisely ironed. My friend and I ordered the spring mix salad to share and by the time they arrived we were amazed that our split portions were very generously filled with crispy greens. The dressing was light and satisfactory. Then I ordered the house special Pollo Arrosto the half rotisserie chicken and it was cooked to perfection. I loved the half baked-half fried potatoes and steamed veggies accompanied by huge portion. For $15.95, my portion was enormous and it got me full. My friends $11.95 angel hair pasta with fresh garden tomato sauce was to die for. He couldnt finish his portion cause it was gigantic. The wine by the glass was real bargain and they were fat splashes. The staff was extremely friendly and they were on top of their game with cleaning and serving on a timely manner. I will go back to this soon. :)", "author": "Emre T."}

Had to send back the salad (it was literally frozen) and the sauce on the chicken tasted like Campbell's cream of mushroom with heavy cream and lots of salt added.

Spiazzo Caffe is a very good place to enjoy a great, inexpensive meal out with friends.  The staff was very pleasent, and even though our waiter had a VERY thick Italian accent (none of the four people in our party could quite understand everything that he said) he was able to take our orders and give recommendations with very little difficulty.  My wife ordered the Minnestroni while I tried the Saltimbocca Alla Romana, which is veal with Prosciutto and cheese in a wonderful sauce served with vegetable and garlic mashed potatoes.  Our food came incredible fast and the waiters were very attentive.  I loved the food.  It wasn't the best veal I've ever had, but it more than did the trick for $16.

The menu: interesting and always available changing special; selection of wines: broad; waitstaff: friendly, knowledgeable and authentic; food: remarkably well prepared and presented. A co-worker, with family in Italy, said it was as close to home as he's experienced. My favorite used to be: steamed mussels and clams followed by Penne al Salmone.   I've now grown to love the white bean salad (the Insalata Etrusca) and skipping around the menu now to try everything.  My husband loves lasagne (which they now have on the menu), but he's growing to learn to try the other things on Spiazzo's menu because they are wonderful as well.  The pizza that I've had from the authentic pizza oven has been fresh and inspired.  When you go, expect a different experience: you won't be rushed.

However, tonight we realized that at the core of this business is dishonesty.  We arrived a little after 7 with no reservation.  The restaurant was full.  We put our name in with the hostess that was clearly in training.  She said it would be five minutes.  We gladly waited and witnessed a single diner come in after us and ask for a table and then a couple who were appeared to be regulars also ask the wait for a table.  Both definitely had no reservations because we heard the exchange.  We waited outside while the woman who seemed to be the regular hostess had some discussion with the trainee as a two top table became available and they seated the single diner.  Then a booth opened up and they seated the regulars.  I asked as to when we might be seated and why the diners who arrived behind us  were seated ahead of us and was told by the trainee that they had reservations.  Clearly a lie.  This in of itself, while disturbing, wouldn't prompt me to write this--it gets better.  Once we were seated--next to the single diner that took our table--I heard him order a half bottle of Pinot Noir by its name.  The waiter returned with a bottle of a different winery.  The diner noticed the difference and asked about the discrepancy.  The waiter said \"this is your Pinot Noir\".  The diner repeated that this was not the one he ordered and the waiter said \"oh, we don't have that one, we have this one\".  The waiter obviously intended to try to put one over on that man rather than explain that the one he chose was not available.

Maybe it will be on the specials menu in the future. Oh and the special of flank steak with gorgonzola- orgasmic but really really rich.", "author": "Kat F."}

I would like to give 3 stars because the service was friendly and the ambiance is nice, but I can't get past the mediocre food.  I might return, but its not my first choice.", "author": "S E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-05", "description": "I'm giving this restaurant three stars based strictly on the service alone.  We had a wonderful waitress and our service was fabulous.  As for the food, I have had better Italian food and I make better Italian food at home.  The bread was a touch dry and would have tasted much better if we had been given a little olive oil to dip it in.  I ordered the Insalata Etrusca which would have been good had it not been oversaturated with balsamic vinegar, unfortunately.  As for the main course, I tried the Tortolloni in Salsa Rosa and though the tortolloni were cooked properly--al dente--the sauce tasted a little bit too much like Campbell's Tomato Soup mixed with cream which was disappointing and the pieces of Italian parsley sprinkled on top were not chopped in small enough pieces.  As for the atmosphere, the tables are well-placed, the lighting is perfect and the decor is very nice.  I may revisit this restaurant at some point in time and try another selection (including one of their desserts which looked wonderful) but with all the great restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area, I usually don't find myself going back unless I had a fantastic initial experience.  This just wasn't one of them.", "author": "Rabbit B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-01-12", "description": "Decent Italian, I've been there twice and the service is pretty good, even on a Friday night. The food comes very very fast, which is the problem-I got the feeling that they wanted us out right away. When it's a busy night I guess they like to feed 'em and leave 'em. We got the check and the waiter stayed a foot away waiting to take the payment. I don't care how many people are waiting to get in, I don't like to feel rushed. I'm hoping for better next time.", "author": "Mandi A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-07-14", "description": "We  had been coming here regularly for over 10 years, and have always loved the food and ambiance.  We just went back to Spiazzo after a break of at least 9 months, and were terribly disappointed.  It seemed as though the ownership changed or something essential changed: my favorite salad (pears/gorgonzola/walnuts) which I ALWAYS got, was now without any flavor, the dressing watery and bland, and the salad bitter.  The spaghetti used to be flavorful and rich and now it was without any flavor at all!!!  The bread was stale (always served with butter, but these days I would think a real Italian restaurant would put olive oil on the table with small dishes for pouring...).  The mixed-antipasti dish was not very good at all, expensive....and had two slices of bruchetta (mushrooms on one slice was cold as if from refrigerator), some beans, some roasted peppers (a bit slimy and soft) two tiny and thin pieces of ham and a few other veggies. Finally, the whole meal went so fast with dishes coming quickly and taken away the second we put down our forks.  Not so relaxing as usual.  I wouldn't recommend Spiazzo.....and this is after years of our recommendations.", "author": "andrea h."}
