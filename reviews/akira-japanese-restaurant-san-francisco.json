I sat at the bar and, while waiting for my boyfriend who was stuck in traffic, decided to start with an order of agedashi tofu - this was delicious and a great start to the meal. At this time one of the chefs also approached me and kindly told me to take my time with the menu and let him know if I have any questions. My boyfriend and I then ordered a variety of items:\n\n-Chawanmushi: light flavor, love the uni on top, a little small for the price (3.5/5) \n-Miso Grilled Cod: amazing flavor and beautiful texture, again a little small (4/5)\n-Scallop/Uni/Monkfish/Quail Egg Spoons: such a great value and absolutely delicious as well, remember to eat it as one whole bite to get the full experience!! the monkfish especially was amazing! (5/5)\n- Engawa Nigiri: thiswas the only one that was seared and  was nice and fatty; to be honest, I enjoyed this more than the o-toro (5/5)\n- Shima Aji Nigiri: probably my least favorite out of the bunch, but this is mostly due to personal preference, this one was a bit more firm in texture (3/5)\n- Young Yellowtail Nigiri: fresh and tasty (3.5/5) \n- O-toro Nigiri: melt in your mouth !!! (4.5/5)\n- Amaebi Nigiri: so nice and sweet, one of my favorites (5/5) \n- Hokkaido Scallop Nigiri: also super sweet !! (5/5)\n- Sea Eel Nigiri: i'm used to having the barbecue one but this one is even better, though a light bit sweeter (5/5)\n- Soba w/ Tempura: the tempura were perfectly crisp and the soba still had a great bite! The broth was a little salty for my taste but was fine for my boyfriend (3.5/5) \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this meal and can't wait to come back to try more nigiri!", "author": "Janice L."}

Each dish was fresh and delicious.  Highlights include the tuna belly, fresh abalone, fried cod, and mochi ice cream at the end.

Came here with a party of 5 and seating is pretty limited but they managed to squeeze us in. I saw this spot have great reviews on Yelp and wanted to try it for myself. My opinion? Some of the best sashimi in SF! They have a very small selection of non fish items so expect to order sashimi or rolls here.\n\nI ordered the chirashi don which is sashimi over rice. The sashimi was extremely fresh and tasty. I believe the types are chef's decisions but there was a good variety including tuna, salmon, shrimp, tamago, egg, octopus, and mackerel. Didn't care for the octopus but tuna, salmon, and mackerel were fantastic. Texture was amazingly tender. The rice had a great sweet vinegary taste with tiny slivers of nori. Portion wasn't huge but I walked away feeling satisfied.\n\nService was friendly and accommodating, food came out quick, and prices are reasonable.

The miso was fine, but both the unagi and the dragon roll did not taste flavorful at all, and the dragon roll tasted like the rice was burnt. This was probably the most disappointing sushi I've ever had, and I've had my fair share - especially for the price. To top it off after I finished my food, I wanted to try ordering some other rolls - because hey, maybe I just got unlucky with the ones I chose. I proceeded to try and catch the eye of one of the numerous waitresses in the small establishment for 15 minutes, menu in hand. No such luck.

I'd made it for Saturday by mistake; in addition, my date was late. The host was able to fid me a table for two and, when my friend arrived and wanted a quieter table, the restaurant accommodate us. That put them ahead from the start.\n\nThen the fact that there were three Japanese beers that I'd not seen before, always a bonus and my friend knew she wanted to try a special appetizer: tuna tartare. Delicisously subtle flavours of tuna with avocado and a little sesame. Since there were several fishes I don't often get to eat, and she's not a big rice fan, we proceeded to order nigiri: mackerel, bream, halibut, salmon. That left room for one more so we had the tuna. Each was fresh, not seasoned and very  tasty.\n\nI'd hoped for som egreen tea icecream and left room for it but there ws one.

I came here with my family for dinner on a week night. It's a cozy restaurant with maybe only 25 seats. My mother order the omakase set and I got to try a bit of everything. It took awhile for the omakase appetizer to come out. They had already served main courses to my dad and brother before she got her appetizer. The appetizer came in a dish separated into 3 compartments which had squid, jellyfish and octopus. The sashimi (tuna and salmon) and the nigiri that came with the omakase were excellent. There were 2 soups that came with it as well as a grilled butterfish that was a little bit too burnt. One soup was a winter melon soup and the other soup which came with the nigiri was the red miso soup. I didn't care for either. For the omakase dessert, you could pick either ice cream, an assortment of mochi ice cream or a green tea cheesecake. We got the mochi ice cream which came in 3 flavors mango, strawberry and green tea. \nFor an omakase, the pricing ($65)  is pretty good compared to other restaurants' omakases. The plating and presentation were all very beautiful. However I think your money is better spent on getting the sashimi or nigiri which are very reasonably priced and delicious.", "author": "Vivian C."}

First off the service is very nice and parking is pretty easy (at least on a weekday). \n\nFor my meal I got the chirashi ($19) and one of the daily specialty rolls (salmon belly outside, crab inside- $14). The chirashi is pretty small and reminds me of the one at Sanraku. The pieces of fish are thin (in a good way) but wide. The selection was pretty typical (1 piece each of maguro, hamachi, tako, escolar, saba, albacore, ebi + 2 tamago). The tamago had good sweetness though wasn't very well made. Rice was very well flavored though which was a huge plus. Quality of the fish is decent.\n\nThe roll was very disappointing though. The crab gets kind of washed away by the salmon, spicy mayo, and jalapeno. The salmon belly itself was thin and not very flavorful. Definitely not worth the $14. \n\nOverall, Akira is a decent sushi spot. I'd still consider coming back but I definitely will steer clear from the rolls in the future.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Down! \nThe hubs and I came to Akira on a casual Thursday night when we were just a bit too lazy to cook dinner.\nHaving planned this earlier in the day, I made a reservation ahead by calling the restaurant (they no longer take OpenTable reservations). Seemingly, tonight a reservation was not needed, though we have seen the restaurant bustling with people on the weekends.\nQuickly seated, we ordered ourselves hot sake, tempura, and miso soup. We put in our roll orders too, a spicy mango roll and an Akira roll, assuming it would take some time. Boy were we wrong! \nService was so quick! We had our beautiful rolls sitting in front of us minutes before our appetizers arrived. \nMildly overwhelmed, we worked our way through the warm miso and the crunchy tempura, excited to start the main event...\nThe mango roll was tasty, the mango adding an exotic touch. Only downside was the rice felt a little too... squishy? Smooshy?\nThe Akira roll was divine!!!! On a health kick, the hubs and I kept evaluating how it is such a simple and HEALTHY roll- cucumber and fish! Definitely coming back for this one!\nLocation, service, and food rocked our boats! We'll be back!", "author": "Roma R."}

I visited here with some friends on a busy Saturday night, without a reservation, but the hostess was willing to accommodate us like it was no trouble at all. We sat right up against the sushi bar and the chefs were friendly and gave out great recommendations. The wait service was also fantastic.\n\nI had the Atlantic roll (quite honestly the most delicious) but the Spicy Mango roll was also incredible. I would recommend going straight for the specialty rolls part of the menu if you're going to dive right in, because this is a place that's doing them right. Plus, the portions are a great size, what you would expect. Lots of these trendy sushi places in the area seem to be cutting the size of their sushi smaller and smaller and you end up needing several rolls just to get a full dinner size, but here you get almost 10 pieces of sushi with each roll, so I was impressed. Absolutely worth checking out, but be smarter than me and make a reservation, because the place is tiny and we definitely just got lucky.", "author": "Veronica B."}

We ordered the preset sashimi plate that was $45 dollars with assorted sashimi, all tasted fatty and fresh. The oyster shooters were interesting, and there were strong Sake in it. I didn't like the cod appetizer, as it was not clear from the menu that it was going to be breaded and fried. I'd prefer the miso baked kind.\n\nThe service could be better.\n\nThe servers had a difficult time to put the plates on the sushi bar, where we were sitting. They came with plates from behind, and we had to lean to the sides for them to insert the plates in between us. That was awkward for them and for us. They could have just serve us the food from where the sushi chefs were; from the front instead. Also, the servers do not take the plates as we finish them, therefore, as they bring the new plates out, they don't have place to put them.

Having a view of ingredient boxes wasn't a too appetizing sight.  This place could benefit from turning the lights down and picking one genre of music to stay on.

I usually don't notice these kinds of things unless it detracts from the meal -- as you can see it did.\n\nThere were individuals waiting in line at the tight door area to be seated, which creates an awkward flow of traffic when trying to leave.\n\nOverall, we'd give it another try... maybe... if we were starving for sushi and restricted to this area in rush hour.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-02-26", "description": "The Occasion:\nMy friend's birthday dinner.  The restaurant made a note of this, but did nothing to celebrate (not even place a candle on the desserts we ordered), let alone say happy birthday.\n\nThe Wait:\nFrom the time of ordering, we waited 45 minutes for our drinks to arrive, and 80 minutes for our food to arrive.  We were a group of 5, with 2 orders of 7-course omakase, and 3 orders of individual entrees.  The individual entrees came out first, after 80 minutes, but the 3 of us were completely finished with the entrees before the 2nd course of the 7-course omakase was served.  Keep in mind the first course was 1 bite, so 2 of us awkwardly waited for our 3 friends to start and finish (after they waited until their food was cold, but commenced without us because they were starving and our food did not look like it was showing up anytime soon), after which the 2 of us awkwardly ate as the 3 of them stuck around waiting for us to start & finish dinner. \n\nThe waiter also kept saying \"1 minute, 1 minute!\" in between each entree when in reality each was another 20 minutes.\n\nThe Service: \nWhat kind of $$$-rated restaurant 1. serves a piece of generic mochi ice cream as the omakase dessert, and 2. brings it out before your 7-piece sushi omakase entree ??? \n\n\nThe Food:\nThe omakase came out of order, with no explanation from the waiter, and with 1 course from the 7-courses completely missing (they never brought it out).  \n\nThe 7-course omakase contained rather generic dishes for 'omakase' such as miso soup with mushrooms as 1 course, preserved jellyfish as a 2nd course (this is a common $0.99 / bag at Chinese markets for something 10X the size), and 2 pieces of mochi ice cream simply cut in half as a 3rd course.\n\nThe Bill:\nOver $300, including us paying for dishes they entirely skipped from the 7-course \"omakase\" sets.\n\nAdvice to Management:\nYou have a lot of staff - they are clearly running around in chaos and panic.  However, anyone without restaurant operations management experience can tell you that the logistics of the operation is highly disorganized.  Staff are visibly not assigned particular roles, with 1 main waiter bringing out 95% of the dishes for the entire restaurant, and the remaining 5 waitresses running around, but always without anything in their hand, checking up on the girls who are checking up on the girls who are checking up on what the male waiter is bringing out.   In other words, you have 4-5 wait staff achieving nothing, all while the 1 waiter is receiving all the heat from a restaurant full of hungry staff.  As a result of being overwhelmed, the waiter was cancelling random parts of orders without issuing refunds on the bill so that he can catch up on being less behind.", "author": "Colette C."}

Was glad that we could be accommodated, as I called earlier that evening to be told it was fully booked. \nThe place itself is not somewhere you would stumble upon, so thank god for Yelp. It's a very nicely decorated dining area, and there was a nice atmosphere. \nI have to say this is the best sushi I've had in SF. And possibly ever. Everything we ordered was top notch and it's really good value. The bill for 4 including beers was only $160, and we had lots of dishes. \nThe stand out items are the grilled asparagus on the appetizer menu, and the pink dragon rolls on the special rolls menu. Also tried the tuna sashimi among others. \nThe reason for not giving 5 stars is the service was a little slow and not overly enthusiastic, and there is a very limited wine menu. \nOtherwise this place cannot be faulted.", "author": "Derek M."}

When I first arrived, I was seated at the table closest to the door and when another party left, I asked to be moved since it was too cold to sit where the door opens and closes. Our server was friendly and helpful.\n\nWe got 3 rolls - Pink Dragon, Spicy Mango, and Seared Salmon Belly (on specials menu). We both agreed that the Pink Dragon (with shrimp tempura) was the best and the Spicy Mango was not as good as the other two. We also ordered Sake (salmon) nigiri, which was not as buttery as I like my salmon. In addition, we had the Miso Gindara; again it was good but I've had better black cod at other Japanese restaurants. We also shared a bottle of Dassai Nigori sake. \n\nThe portion sizes were small. Somehow the rolls seemed tiny and the nigiri sushi was compact and the cod was mini-sized as well. For the same price point, you can get a lot more in terms of quality, quantity, creativity, and value at Elephant Sushi. Akira is good; there's just better out there.", "author": "Yi Z."}

With such high rating on Yelp , I went in on a Valentine day with high expectation. \nNo wait at all and the restaurant are pretty empty . \n\nGot seated with the staff are friendly . \nThe menu selection wasn't big , there is a law of the lunch menu which can't be applicable for dinner. But on the Don and noodles section it did not specify it is for Lunch only . So I wanted to order the Unagi Don but the waiter said that Don/ noodles place are for lunch only . \n\nBig bummer ,  if Don and noodles are for lunch only then what else can we order besides nigiri , sashimi and appetizer . There is a $65 omakase included nigiri , dessert and appetizer but does not seems worth it so I didn't get that. \n\nSo I asked the waiter if I can get the chirashi don ($19) the most expensive Don on the menu and he said yes. Okay ... so .... he just said the Don are only for lunch but I can only order chirashi for tonight .... okay....  another skeptical part is , I asked what about the udon he said he need to ask the chief . So we ended up with a chirashi , a Kobe dragon and rainbow roll . Plus two pieces of Hokkaido scallops nigiri . \n\nOverall , the portion are really small , especially the chirashi .... very disappointing. The fishes are not fresh .... but i enjoyed the Kobe dragon roll ! \n\nThe Hokkaido scallop priced at $8 for two , don't order that .... it just taste super ordinary like the one you can buy on the street anywhere .\n\nA side note is ,Tea is $2 each , they did not tell me when I order them . \nI will probably not come back again , because of the quality is not fresh and it is just not worth a visit .tsubasa sushi are way better , on the same district .", "author": "Priscilla F."}

This was definitely not the case at Anita, though. It was here, for the first time, that I actually think I was able to understand what people mean when they say they had great sushi. \n\nWe went with the omakase, split between two people, as well as the spicy tuna and roasted duck.\n\nRoasted Duck: 4/5\n\nMad juicy and flavorful. Duck was more medium to medium well, but certainly not overcooked. It was well salted and delicious with a squeeze of lemon on top. The one thing I didn't love about it was the chewy fat that came on top. It had a nice caramelized too, but it wasn't the kind of melt-in-your-mouth fat like pork belly that I don't mind eating -- more rubbery and tough.\n\nSpicy Tuna: 4/5\n\nSpicy tuna rolls, more often than not, are just spicy mayo rolls with a little bit of tuna mixed in. This was not the case here. It was very tuna forward -- it had a good blend of fat in it with some heat and a nice soft texture. The rice was well seasoned, too -- a balanced mix of vinegar and sugar.\n\nOmakase: 4/5\n\nCan't pretend that I remember everything we were served, but there were a few standout dishes. The grilled fish was probably my favorite. It had a very light coating of marinade -- a sweet and salty, almost teriyaki-like glaze which infused it with flavor but didn't overwhelm. The fish was unbelievably tender and flakey, and the grilled skin at the bottom was a concentration of crispy, umami goodness. Also loved the nigiri we were served -- each fish had its own distinct, subtle but delicious flavor. I especially liked the white fish which was just barely seared on top -- velvety, buttery and delicious. The dessert was very good, too -- a small piece of green tea cheesecake that was small, dense, and rich. Not too sweet with a nice firm set and green tea flavor.\n\nThe atmosphere was modern and relaxing, from the limited number of tables to the soft lighting and black and mahogany accents. One thing I would change would be the music, which consisted of late 2000s and contemporary pop -- to be honest, I liked the relaxing, traditional music playing in the bathrooms! \n\nWhile some plates were better than others, the menu was creative, high-quality and diverse, and that, plus the gentle ambience, made for a fun night out. I'd recommend it to anyone near the area.", "author": "Emily M."}

I was really amazed. Then it was topped with jalape\u00f1o to give it a spicy kick. I also got the pink dragon & spicy mango which was two flavorful rolls., and again I was blown away of how yummy the fish was.\n\nAlso, I overheard a women telling the waiter and sushi chef how much she loved the melon that was served there. The sushi chef thanked her for the comment and even gave her a whole melon to take home! I thought that was such a nice gesture from the sushi chef.

Akira is the perfect Japantown spot to eat some authentic sushi/sashimi for lunch. They have a number of lunch and daily specials that make Akira a worthy lunch selection that won't break the bank. What you need to order ASAP is the hamachi carpaccio (simply wow). The lunch bento box is also a nice (under $20) deal, which we ordered and shared, but I would probably order two items off the menu next time to replace the bento box im addition to the hamachi carpaccio. I would even consider just 2 hamachi carpaccios for lunch. It seems that dinner is somewhat pricier so definitely try out lunch first.

It was about 7 pm and the lighting inside was so dark we could barely see our menus! Guess that's something they're going for though. \n\nService was great, I loved the warm hand towels they gave us before the meal. \n\nOur party of three started off with three rolls to share, and edamame, and we were pretty hungry. The rolls themselves were on the smaller side, but the fish was very fresh and the rolls were well-prepared. We ate them so fast, we had to order another roll because we were still hungry. \n\nWe finished the meal by ordering the mochi trio, which was just a fun little taste of ice cream, but nothing very special. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience and the service was excellent, but I would've appreciated some larger rolls. The total for a party of three came out to be about 65$, and for the broke students that we are, probably can't go there again anytime soon.", "author": "Jessica M."}

Maybe I went on an off day, but the fish was definitely not fresh (aside from the salmon, which was fine). I absolutely love raw fish (it's one of my favorite things to eat), and I am always interested in trying new sushi places, but this one really let me down.\n\nThe redeeming factor was the waiter, who was really friendly and patient, and when I was weary of the sketchy uni (it looked, smelled and tasted really off), he apologized and took it off the bill. An extra star (and tip) for that.\n\nThere are literally dozens of better sushi places in SF than this one.", "author": "Jen K."}

We were sat immediately and the service was awesome. We really enjoyed the flavor of the miso soup and cucumber seaweed salad. I ordered the wallu nigiri and hamachi belly sashimi. The wallu was bland for my taste but the hamachi belly was ok. It was tender, however, most sushi restaurants I've been to put a little sauce to enhance the flavor of the fish or to put their twist on it. Everything that came out had spicy mayo, which isn't original and certainly not my favorite. My friend ordered the pink dragon roll which was really good and the special roll they had for the day. It was just ok. For the price we paid for the food and it being mediocre, I don't think I will be back. \n\nI'm rating two stars for the service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-10", "description": "3 stars = \"A-OK.\"... that about sums it up. I think Japanese food is one category where high reviews on Yelp really can't be trusted, and this is a perfect example. It wasn't BAD, but it wasn't GOOD. It's exactly what you would have expected from a \"Japanese\" (quotes intentional) restaurant in SF prior to the opening of more authentic and legit restaurants in recent years. It's in fact better than most of those places, and some of the dishes are a priced very fairly. However, I made the mistake of expecting them to have some of their \"over rice\" items such as the chirashi during the dinner service, and upon discovering that they don't, made the immediate uneducated decision of adding the sashmi moriawase (combination) for $45. That's $3 a piece of fairly \"basic\" fish, and a huge chunk of my final bill. Fail. This is one of those restaurants where clientele will remark such things as \"they give you thick pieces of fish there and it's fresh!\", which just shows me that they don't really \"get\" Japanese food. /End snobby rant.\n\nMaybe I'll come back some day during their lunch service and try some less ingredient-centric items and get a better value for my money there.", "author": "Kazu O."}

The interior of the restaurant is nicely decorated, so I can tell the owners really tried to make it look elegant. (Didn't get a chance to check out the restroom.) The restaurant itself is pretty spacious but doesn't offer lots of seating--maybe 20 people (not including bar seating). The inside of the restaurant was cold (but it's also been cold in SF recently). Servers were very attentive and friendly; chefs were friendly as well! When my boyfriend and I first arrived, there was only one other party, but as we left, three other parties were seated. \n\nNow on to the food . . . Food was averagely priced--not too pricey but also not too cheap. We ordered three rolls one nigiri and the total came out to about $45. My boyfriend and I were big fans of the tempura roll! The unagi nigiri was also good, but the two other rolls were just ok. My boyfriend thought the fish were too cold when it was served to us, but again, it may have just been because the whole restaurant (and city) were cold. \n\nAkira is still relatively new in a predominantly residential area, but once the word gets out, I'm sure it'll be packed in no time--I'd come back again to support a local business!", "author": "Jessilyn C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-11", "description": "This was, without a doubt, the best sushi I've ever had. It may be a little pricier than the train places, but it is worth the extra cost. This is a small place, only 9 tables and a handful of bar seats, so on a busy night you may want reservations. The hamachi toro is to die for. If you have any questions whatsoever, Chef Min, Judy, and staff are very friendly and knowledgeable, and it's clear that Chef Min loves what he does. I'm visiting from Oregon and would literally come back to the Bay Area just to eat here again.", "author": "Eric K."}

The ambience was relaxing, the \"kaiseki-style\" presentation of the food was charming and the service was friendly. If you strip away all these surface qualities, however, you'll find that the food itself is only so-so \n\nAkira tries hard to be authentic, but in the end it's just an above average Californian Japanese restaurant (I'll admit to being something of a Japanese food snob because I spent a lot of time in Japan and Asia and had plenty of great Japanese food). We had the Omakase dinner. The three small appetizers were OK but nothing to write home about. The sashimi was thickly-cut and bland. The sushi wasn't memorable because the vinegared rice lacked texture and taste. The soup tasted similar to my home-made miso soup. I barely noticed the simmered beef dish.\n\nWhen the mediocrity of the food became apparent to us, we looked around to examine the clientele. I don't think there were any Japanese there, which didn't surprise us.\n\nWhile our overall experience at Akira wasn't bad, we won't be coming back because the food was so ordinary.", "author": "George C."}

First off, I am allergic to soy, usually a non issue with sushi but I made sure to talk to him at the outset about it since some sauces contain soy. Three of us ordered several rolls and nigiri which we enjoyed. As a spurge, we ordered one last roll, their special spider roll for which we waited, no exaggeration, over 20 minutes. When it arrived, it was clearly covered by a soy based sauce. My husband asked him about it and reminded him of my allergy. The waiter acted like he got caught in an uncomfortable position. It was in fact soy and that he \"forgot\" to mention it to the appropriate person. No apology, no couple bucks off, nothing in place of it for me. Nada. He blew the opportunity to make things right.

Crispy and perfectly rolled. \n(This restaurant even have their own self-named Akira Roll!)\n\nOverall, the restaurant is very clean and modern.

I love sushi but admittedly don't have the most refined palate, but from my own past experience, the fish was fresh, the rice was a perfect consistency, and I especially appreciated that the sauce for the dragon roll was light as to not detract from the unagi. One friend in our party who worked at a sushi restaurant also remarked that the food was excellent, and was told that Akita receives shipments of fish on a daily basis, so rest assured the fish is consistently fresh.\n\nTo finish off, we were given complementary dessert (sesame ice cream garnished with some puffed rice and sweet black bean). Again, clear attention to detail.\n\nAkira is a welcome new addition to the neighborhood, and it's clear that they're here to earn their business and respect. You will love it if you're looking for a restaurant with great service without coming off as stuffy. If they continue down this road I expect they will be here for years to come. We will be back!", "author": "C L."}

Cod was perfect as well as everything else I had ( duck appetizer,  udon, caterpillar roll, salmon belly, miso).  Service was top notch and atmosphere made me want to make this a definite date spot.  Well done!", "author": "Russell D."}

When we arrived, they said they didn't have it and wouldn't even acknowledge it.\nI even showed the hostess my call history and said I spoke with a man at a given time.\nShe went ahead and sat walk ins before us and was very condescending.\nOur waiter was no where to be found all night, and the sushi got worse as the place got more crowded.\nThe one star is for the sweet sushi chefs. Our first pieces were the best of the night, but then the people didn't know how to handle the faster pace required for bigger crowds.\nThe truffle carpaccio was awful but we couldn't bring ourselves to tell the chef. The fish was too cold and Carpaccio is meant to be thin slices. It was thick pieces alternated with thick pieces of avocado then poured on waaaaaay too much truffle oil. Plus, the presentation was a big thumbs down.\nThe craziest part, was we got our bill and it was missing half of our order!\nWe kindly let them know and no one, not the waiter, or even the manager who brought it back to us said thank you or even acknowledged the fact that we caught it.\nI will not go back here. The fish quality was pretty decent but the management and staff were scattered and unprofessional.", "author": "natasha c."}

The owner was very nice and obviously passionate about serving only the best. The seared Salmon belly roll was incredible. So lightly seared that it's still raw, but the sear brings out all of the flavors. If you love sushi you absolutely must come here.", "author": "Steve G."}

I wouldn't recommend it for non-sushi lovers (the dinner menu doesn't offer much for those who can't handle raw fish), but if you're looking for sushi this is the place.", "author": "Natalia N."}

My fiance and I were celebrating our anniversary, and although they took reservations, we were late so we lost our spot.  The staff was still friendly and kept checking in with us to let us know how long the wait would be.  Everything we ordered was amazing!  Salmon sashimi, big eye tuna roll, Akira roll.. but my two absolute favorites were the Bluefin tuna belly Nigiri and the Cherry Blossom roll (tuna and salmon).  Melt in your mouth, super fresh, deliciousness.  Our server was amazing, he was really patient while we kept ordering additional food, and was always around for us when we needed anything.  Food came out very quickly, and with a smile.  All around great experience, and my our favorite sushi spot.", "author": "Lyra F."}

I live around the corner and was excited to see a new place and new ownership take over Ah Lin Chinese. The owners Judy and her husband were great and personable. The fish was fresh. We got the black cod and were not disappointed. It was perfectly cooked and buttery. The spicy tuna roll is spicy! Which I love. The pink dragon and spicy mango rolls were also wonderful. The price is decent - the reason it wasn't 5 (I would rate this 4.5) is I wish they had a few more creative rolls, but all in all this will definitely be one of our go to sushi places.", "author": "Meredith P."}
