They care about your drinking experience. One unique thing that I appreciate about their menu is they vary the level of intensity with espresso pulls and Americanos. They suggest water or soda water backs. My head was spinning with choices. Happy times.\n\nBaristas are approachable and fast. I went in a little after typical rush hour, around 10, and was served quickly.

The barista/cashier seemed friendly but there wasn't much chatter between the three of us - kind of awkward silence as we decided what to order.

I didn't try the cold brew but my friend said it was one of the best she's had - most times cold brew turns out to be underwhelming with lack of depth in flavor and body.

If you do not like dark chocolate, I would avoid this but since I love all chocolate this was a winner imo.\n- Latte: All good.\n- Hot chocolate: Will hit the spot but is nothing special.\n- Breakfast burrito: pretty yummy but small for the price you pay.\n- Coconut Chocolate Chip Cookie: Nom nom nom, get it!\n\nStaff is happy to answer any questions, but do not expect any warm and fuzzy chit chat.", "author": "Ellen H."}

The free wi-fi was also pretty speedy, clocking in at 13.63 Mbps download and .72 Mbps upload.  However, something about the place was off-putting.  There was no music or charming touches, and it just lacked character.  If I go to a coffee shop to work, I don't want it to feel like an office.  I want some cozy touches.  I notice some other reviewers have described the atmosphere as \"contemporary,\" so it really depends what you're looking for.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't bother with food here.

But things seem to flow much better now, and I've had some espresso at this location that was even better than what I remember having at their other spot.  The staff, in general, is very friendly. Their pastries are always outstanding, but sometimes sold out.  Once they gave me a cold empenada, but I told them, and they made me a hot one.  Problem solved.  My girlfriend ordered an \"iced separator\" the other day when it was hot out, and wow was that thing good.  I read some of the other reviews.  Who are these dummies?  What kind of a person calls a business in San Francisco to ask if parking is difficult?  This is SAN FRANCISCO.  Parking sucks here.  Driving sucks here.  Parking at their other location is nearly impossible some days.  This location actually has lots of parking every time I go.  Metered and hourly.\n\nBottom line is that if you like amazing coffee from nice people in a beautiful space, Contraband is worth checking out!  Watch your step!", "author": "D N."}

But the actual drinks were less than subpar. The chai latte was the worst. Americano is underwhelming. Drip coffee is decent but nothing to rave about.", "author": "Jessie S."}

The coffee and tea is okay for sf standards but not great.  It's very clean and sterile with beautiful wood tables and a very young hipster staff.  I guess I'll just keep on walking.", "author": "Andre G."}

The wood counter tops are gorgeous .\n\nThe Barista was on point. Super friendly and  awesome attitude. My latte couldn't have been better. Theyre slayer espresso machine is pretty cool. While the espresso is hard to beat. \n\nThey didnt have any prepackaged beans... but the barista was more than happy to bag me some fresh ones. All while sharing knowledge on different roasts. I felt very comfortable and was happy with his knowledge. I can only imagine this place will get better.", "author": "Cody C."}

I asked a simple question about parking and spoke with two different people. They both had really bad attitudes and said \"I don't know what do you want me to tell you there's street parking.\" I asked do I have to pay? Is it every two hours? Is it difficult to park? It's fine if you don't know, but at least try to find the answer or ask someone who may know. That's basic customer service skills. They gave me attitude as if I was being a huge bother for calling in.", "author": "Florence K."}

Needless to say, the cocoa was rich & dark & the chai was amazing. Definitely try the Bhakti chai for a more traditional type...super smooth & a nice bite of ginger. \nNext time we go back we'll actually have to get some coffee!", "author": "Saul L."}

Tangie ( i am sure i got that wrong) made a super tasty Latte and was the kind of person who would make me want to come back to a business with how accommodating she was. Temp was nice on the drink not too hot or cold and i did not feel the need to add sugar. Super place to grab a cup. Will come back here every chance i get.
