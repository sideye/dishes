I was there on a date tonight when a group of people in the corner got a bit loud. Sure it may have been obnoxious but they just seemed to be having a good night.\nThen a blonde woman in a tank top jumped up from her table and yelled \"shut the f*** up\" and began arguing with the group. She then stumbled over to the table and identified herself as the bar manager while telling the group to get the f$&@ out! How embarrassing and unprofessional for a manager who was clearly intoxicated to be addressing guests in this way. \nI had brought my date in to show them a great bar and was sadly disheartened by our experience. We left for another spot and honestly felt bad for the group that was singled out for enjoying themselves.

It has really great lighting, the bartenders are super accommodating, the drinks are great and they know what they are doing.\nKnow what you want- theres no drink menu here, so for all of you who can only order a drink that you read off a list, try another bar.\nI'm blown away that they give out bar snacks for free during happy hour when their drinks are already discounted. You can't get anything for free anywhere! Plus that bar mix is SO good.\nI had a well tequila cocktail during happy hour that was $8 and 100% agave, none of that weird grain alcohol stuff, it bumped to $10 after happy hour was over, but the drink was still just as delicious. For those of you with higher standards than well cocktails, I think for a dollar more I could have had Herradura, so I guess if you like that, it's worth the extra buck.\nThe music changes depending on who is working, I really like the variety.\nIt tends to be busy alot, so I think word has spread about this well established place. But you can still go in during the week days and have a nice quiet corner to yourself.\nWeekends can be busy and sometimes there are customers who leave their half eaten food on the tables and all over those white tablecloths... GROSS! But the bartenders attitudes are great, we get served quickly and someone always comes by and cleans up the messes left behind. It's really impressive that such a small bar can pack such a big punch!\nI've seen some bartenders handle obnoxious customers or underage folks trying to get served without id's and they are always really professional, even when those dopes argue with them! Like that will help your case? ha!\nAll in all if you're looking for good ambiance, great drinks, fun time and some people watching- this is the place for you.

We'd been many times and have always been treated nicely. Last night changed our opinion of the place completely.\n\nWe walked in; no one was sitting at any of the tables and the actual bar was about 75% full. We sat at the end of the bar and waited patiently for the bartender to come over. After a few minutes, the only bartender ( a blonde girl ) came over and just looked at us. My girlfriend asked her \"Do you do Mojitos\". Bartender, \"No\". My GF \"oh, what's your favorite cocktail to make?\" Bartender, \"Budweiser bottle\". I then said, \"Budweiser bottle is your favorite cocktail to make?\", her response, \"yep, I can just grab it and be done serving you\". She then walked away from us as a rude smart ass would do. \n\nHere's the thing, I get it. I realize a bartender doesn't always have time to make a suggestion, but there are no cocktail menus on the counter and we just don't know what they could make. (obviously not mojitos). My GF was trying to be nice by saying she would try any easy cocktail that the bartender would make. Also, the bar was no where near full and she could have made a simple suggestion for a cocktail that is similar to a mojito. \n\nNow what she didn't know. We were out having a drink because we had just gotten some terrible news. We wanted to go out and just have a nice night out. This \"little girl\" with her bad attitude made an already sad day, that much worse.

I felt really awful at first, I spend my workday building people's self-esteem up so I feel like a jerk if I ever do the opposite, but then she came back and explained that a) she didn't want to say the names of the drinks, and b) they were all awful. So after we finished our drinks, she made us a pair of shots called The Last Word, which were gin, liqueur and lime juice. While it didn't qualify for the game, it was a classy move on the bartender's part, and thus, I thank her. She was great.\n\nAs for the bar itself, my friend wanted a divey place in the Mission. I didn't, but she had a rough day and wanted something low-key. There are plenty of dives in the Mission, but this one is less of a dive and more of a hideaway, and that's why I love it.

We walked the two blocks over there and entered the bar without being IDed or running into anyone at the door. We purchased an assortment of drinks at the bar, roughly one for each of us.\n\nSo we are standing there having our drinks and the bar tender came around from the bar and told one of the party that he had to leave now, and kicked him out. As it turned out he had carried a beer into the bar that he had been drinking at the party. He apologized, gave his beer to the bar tender and left without a scene.\n\nI approached the bar tender and apologized for my friend bringing a beer and explained that it was an accident. She told me that we were not allowed to bring our own alcohol into the bar. I told her that we had just bought a round of drinks as a party and once again told her that it was an accident and that we did not mean to be rude or break any rules and asked if she would allow our friend back into the bar. She told me that if she \"caught any of us trying to sneak liquor into the bar again\" she'd kick the entire party out.\n\nI promptly left. Again this is one experience that I had so it obviously may not be the norm at this bar but it was very insulting and pretty irrational.\n\nWe had just walked into the bar and bought well over $100 dollars in drinks, we were not belligerent or making a scene, one of us happened to still have the half-empty can of beer from the party in his hand.

I'm marking this one on the calendar as a reminder of the good days when I'm 70.\n\nThe bathroom here was clean and swept clean, almost on the hour, since I found it immaculate for a dive bar.

An ex of mine worked there years and years ago and I remember going to meet her, or even pick her up, and having to deal with a tidal wave of smoke (mind you this IS after the smoking ban in CA). So I avoided it like the plague.\n\nSo now there is no smoking so I figure its safe for a trial run on a Friday night. In the spirit of full disclosure; I worked a gig that night and lugged a ton of gear in and out of my truck and the venue, so I was tired. I also hadn't really eaten anything remotely of substance that day and had 2 beers. So I was on the fast track to nap-ville on my couch when I ventured out.\n\nI have to say that the crowd was actually pretty cool. Granted 1/3 of the place was my friends, but still, everyone seemed interesting and varied. There was one horrible idiot yelling and speaking as loudly as humanly possible, but that happens everywhere...So far so good.\n\nPerhaps the above info contributed, but all I wanted to do was have a few drinks, loosen up, and hang with the crew. The problem with rating a bar, specifically a dive-bar, is that its mostly based on the patrons, the price, and the service. I'm a DJ and complete music snob but I could care less about what's playing in a dive-bar so long as its not ridiculous. (and by care less, i mean, ALMOST ANYTHING is acceptable and gives the bar its \"divey character\") I also don't really deduct any points for decor unless its smells like urine (think: carpet at storyville), or is a little too chichi for what it really is. It should be dark, weird, and even confusing; check.\n\nSo we have people: good; prices: not bad; service: a roll of the dice. After waiting 10 minutes for one bartender to finish chatting with friends (mind you I was standing right next to one of said friends), I finally got some service. Ten minutes in a small bar way under capacity, while tired and almost hung over from 2pm drinking, is an eternity!!! Honestly if she had said, \"hold on a sec\", I'd have been fine. \n\nThe funny thing was the other bartender was busting ass to cover the rest of the bar, get ice, restock, etc. Anyway, I get this ditzy, \"hi\" like she's surprised I wanted something. I order, and get a very weak drink. I kinda figured it might just be that type of place, but upon getting a good pour, smile, and proper acknowledgement from the other taller bartender, I realize some people are just not made for the service industry.\n\nAm I being picky? Yeah a little. But first impressions mean a lot, and it wasn't that busy. So perhaps I'll go again and even give her one more try, but until then, 3 stars is what we have.", "author": "Morgan A."}

The one you met emerging from the fog while you were walking down that San Francisco street, heels clicking on the pavement, echoes into the cold city night.\"\n\nI don't claim to be a master of the rendezvous, and certainly never with a mysterious stranger emerging from fog.  Does a fog machine count?  I don't think I've even done that.  Usually she's just sitting at the bar.  \n\nOn a positive note, this is the closest bar to my house, and it's a pretty good one.  Decent but limited selection of beers on tap (Boont Amber is enough to get me through a night), dim-light and laid-back atmosphere, music selection varies from *mediocre* to *pretty awesome* depending on the bartenders in control, but it's never awful.  The ratio of men-to-women is often a little high for my tastes, but the crew of regulars along the bar always make for a good time.

A few minutes later, the crew had agreed to the plan - which involved grabbing a few drinks and just hanging out, laid-back-style. I was thinking \"weekday lounge plan\".\n\nParking isn't nearly as bad as other places in the Mish, and I had the parking Gods smiling down on me when I realized the spot on the street right opposite the bar was vacant. Automatic plus for that.\n\nStrolling in, I immediately realized that ranking the lone palm amongst the \"lounge\" category is some yelpers idea of a joke. I'd say \"neighborhoody dive bar\" is a better characterization - what with the cheap neon sign outside, the black drapes, the slanted mirrors on the walls and the 3 dimensional art. And the bartender appeared to be the *only* employee - which meant that serving a drink took her a good 10-15 minutes at a time. And since she was more interested in serving people closest to her, I was less than thrilled with the service. Also, plastic isn't taken here. Automatic minus one each for these two.\n\nFortunately the presence of the crew was a positive, so I didn't worry too much about the venue. It got a little more crowded towards the end, but as my friend remarked, it was a major sausage-fest in there after a while. And a lot of older \"we live around here and walked\" types, very few women. Minus one for that also.\n\nThe womens restroom was clogged and my friend had to use the mens, which caused some minor consternation to other male patrons and was the subject of much hilarity for us - but they deserve a minus one for this as well; specifically because the bartender on being told of the clog, busted out a plunger and got busy.

Too salty.)\r\n\r\nAs usually happens after massive hangovers, I swore off drinking. It lasted eight days. Then I decided to swear off just hard liquor. That lasted for at least a month. Then I went to the Lone Palm.\r\n\r\nI never thought I would say this about anywhere, much less a drinking establishment, but the Lone Palm is simply not a beer environment. The dim lighting, cloth tablecloths, Egyptian decor, and odd yesteryear-classy atmosphere drove me to order a gin and tonic. And another. And another. And before long I was staggering to the BART wondering how my resolution had gone so awry and how such strong drinks had been so tasty.\r\n\r\nSo now, thanks to the Lone Palm, I'm no longer on any wagons. But I have learned to keep my cupboard stocked with some non-tuna fish foods.", "author": "Liz G."}

They have a full bar, but also a good wine selection, which can be hard to find.  Drinks are reasonably priced, which is kind of in contrast to the white tablecloths on the tables.

I could have read somebody their Miranda rights during the time the bottle was fully inverted over the glass.  I order a second beer when she's about half way done with her drink, and she chimes in and orders another one too.  I watch the bartender while he mixed her second, and again the bottle went inverted-vertical.  Familiar words went through my head:  \"You have the right to remain silent...anything you say can or will...\".  Somewhere around \"...provided for you at government expense\", he flipped the bottle back up again.  It took her awhile to finish her first drink....after which we decided to get something to eat.  An untouched double-tall Greyhound sat beckoning on on the bar. I pointed to it and said \"You DON'T have to drink that\" right before  starting to pull a hooded sweatshirt over my head.  My hands went through the sleeves and my head poked out into open view only to see her holding the glass to her lips at a 45 degree angle, after which she defiantly slammed the empty glass on the bar and flashed me her best \"don't tell me what to do\" shit-eating-grin.\r\n\r\nEver watch the old \"Road Runner\" cartoons?  Ever see what Wiley Coyote looks like after a failed attempt at Road-Runner hunting and a big rock drops on his head?  The rolling eyes, the staggering gait, the slurred speech and a complete loss of all basic motor skills?  That's what my date looked like the second we stepped outside and the cold air hit her. I poured her in a cab and got her back to my place. When we got home, I pointed to the couch....\"That's where you're sleeping\".  The next morning she couldn't find her car keys.

I went there on a recent Friday and ordered a ginger ale for my brother and a Maker's Mark for my boyfriend. The bartender managed to fuck that up by mixing both drinks in one glass (I just want to know what kind of a dipshit thinks it's a good idea to ever mix Maker's Mark with ginger ale). When I told her that I had actually asked for two separate drinks, she gave me a lecture on how I ordered wrong. She then proceeded to pour my brother's ginger ale into a shot glass. When he gave her a dirty look, she took my boyfriend's glass of Maker's Mark and dumped out half of it. I wanted to deck her. But the best I can hope for is that she get fired when enough people realize what an asshole she is (by the way, my brother wants it to be noted that she had plumber's crack).", "author": "Pia S."}

All the seating though can be bad because the place gets pretty full and theres absolutely 0 room to dance if the mood strikes. Funky decor and cheap drinks make it  a worth while stop.
