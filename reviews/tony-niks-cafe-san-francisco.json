{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-09-22", "description": "Honestly, I don't know how this place has such great reviews given how creepy and aggressive the bartender is. I came here with a girlfriend and we ordered two drinks. Quick, ordered and were ready to sit down. The bartender took a look at the check after I signed it and wasn't happy with the tip I left. He said that he made an extra drink because he overheard my friend ordering from the other bartender and supposedly thought he was to make it. He told us that if we wanted that drink we needed to leave a bigger tip of $10 (which is the price of the drink). \n\nIt was very weird and my friend and I were thrown off by how aggressive he was being, so we changed our tip amount. He then left and was nowhere to be seen.\n\nMy friend told the female bartender, \"I think that is our drink. The male bartender said that we could have it because he made it as an extra.\" She responded, \"Oh, this is for a person down the bar.\"  \n\nOverall the whole interaction was very weird and really ruined my experience at this bar. Because of this I won't be returning. I've never experienced such an aggressive/sneaky bartender. He was overall just creepy. \n\nThe drink he made was alright at $10, but it was hard to feel comfortable at that point. \n\nI recommend you take your business elsewhere. So many better bars on this street.", "author": "Mads J."}

This place looks like your typical dive bar from the outside but on the inside is this old school, classy bar with the friendliest Bartenders you will ever meet. A and I were able to snag a few seats at the end of the bar. The tables in the back of Tony Nik' were rented out for a 40th birthday party but I am sure that is a nice place to hang out with a date. The space is dark and intimate, the perfect place to take your SO.\n\nWe ordered from the cocktail menu written on the board (apparently they always have the same cocktails and just changed the name for the holidays) and chatted with the bartender as he made our drinks. He was really personable and spent a lot of time crafting our cocktails. At the standard SF $12, these were quality drinks. We were really enjoying the vibe at Tony Nik's so decided to order another round as we finished ours. A ordered another one of the cocktails on the mirror whereas I decided to try my luck and order a Matador. A Matador is a cocktail I had in Osaka 1 month prior at a similar bar and is a classic cocktail with Tequila, Pineapple Juice and Lime Juice. I thoroughly enjoyed it in Japan so I figured that a classy bar like Tony Nik's would be able to recreate it. The bartender didn't know what the drink was but offered to try his hand at making it since he had all of the ingredients on hand. \n\nHe did his best but unfortunately, the drink was TERRIBLE. Not enough lime juice and it tasted like rotten sun tan lotion. A and I just paid and I resolved to finish it since I wasn't going to complain over something where the bartender had tried his best. After about 5 minutes, our bartender checked up on us and specifically on how I enjoyed my drink. Something you should know about me, fellow Yelpers, is that I cannot lie with a straight face. He immediately saw I didn't like it and instantly offered to try again since he was determined to make the drink correctly.  He immediately went to work and used more lime juice (plus upgraded my Tequila from the well - thanks!!) and the new drink was 10x better. Now that is AMAZING customer service which really is difficult to find. I learned my lesson to not order Matadors but even more than that, we gained a new favorite bar. If you are in the North Beach area and are looking for a place to have a few nice, calm drinks, you need to stop in.", "author": "Carrie W."}

Like that?  \n\nWhen I apologized, for maybe having offended him on some way, He responded, \"You haven't shut up since you got here.\"  \n\nI tried to diffuse the situation by explaining I grew up in the Northeast and had a penchant for speaking in a loud voice but did not intend to offend him.

They stayed for 1 drink and left...I asked, \"What's with the antenna?\"  He replied, \"They're a bit ditsy.\"  I said, \"I don't know, it looked like they were having some sort of ladies night out thing, like a birthday or some other celebration.  \n\nHe said, \"Their too old to be acting so young and having so much fun.\"\n\nSeriously, absolutely incredible...\n\nI would definitely return, to get his name and the owner's number...", "author": "Charles L."}

Said cocktails are created by cool, unpretentious, bartenders lacking hipster credentials.  This is a plus.  The bartenders are skilled at \"surprise me\" orders so go ahead, live dangerously.  \n\n5.  A lack of hipster credentials doesn't imply a non-hipster crowd but the night I visited it was a perfect mix of ages (20s thru 60s) and types (locals, tourists, suburban, urban, hipster, and non).\n\n6.  Tony Nik's soundtrack is infectious.  Fantastic music to accompany your imbibing but tuned to a pitch over which one can still hold a conversation.\n\n7.

Adventurous souls and those with insider knowledge will walk in, belly up to the bar, and groove in the mid-century lounge ambiance.  This is possibly the coolest bar in North Beach.   \n\n6.

With an unassuming entrance in the middle of North Beach, the bar looks like a dive from the outside. It's quite the contrary.\n\nInside, the decor is clean, classy and clearly modern. It's longer than it is wide. The actual bar lines the left side as you walk in; there are small tables in the back with some booth seating.\n\nAgain, my friends ordered so I can't comment on the bartenders. However, they do make some great classic drinks! We ordered the following: old fashioned, martini, negroni, gin and tonic, and a whiskey on the rocks. All of them were very good. My negroni was craftily blended, smooth and strong.\n\nThe general atmosphere is pleasant, especially when you consider it's in the middle of a rowdy district. It's laid-back, and both the older and younger crowds seem to coexist peacefully. Scattered throughout are couples/two person groups and larger parties. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. They keep the music at a decent volume that still allows for great conversation.\n\nThis place has the thinnest bathrooms I've ever seen! There's one per gender. There actually ended up being a line for the men's while we were there, which I thought was unusual.\n\nIt never got too crowded (although we didn't stay super late).

The place was where the old school SF sportos would bullshit. He poured a short, stiff drink and could make a pot of coffee last a week.  He was an old school, cash on the bar SF bartender.\n\nI think Butch would like the new Tony Nik's.

I went here after spending most of the night at a different bar in North Beach. I was throwing a going away party as I'm moving to a different city this week. The first part of the evening at Tony Nik's was fine. My friends and I found a place to sit in the back and enjoyed our beers.  I went outside with a friend to have a chat and upon coming back in, went up to the bar to order a beer.  I'm standing at the bar, I make eye contact with the male bartender and  we nod at each other. As this is happening, he calls last call.  He then comes over to me and says he just called last call therefore I wouldn't be able to get a drink.  I pleaded with him saying that I was already at the bar when he called it, that we acknowledged eachother and that I think I should be able to get a drink. He was insistent in not serving me so I proceeded to ask the other bartender (or perhaps she was the barback) if she could help me in getting a drink.  He yelled at me that I wasn't allowed to do that.  I then walked away from the bar back to my friends.  \n\nAt this point, I was just ready to get out of there when the bartender comes up to me and my friends and starts yelling at me again! Telling me to go look in the mirror (whatever that means?).  Meanwhile, my friends and I are just trying to leave.  We go outside, I'm talking to the bouncer who was incredibly nice and friendly the whole night.  I'm telling him about the customer service of the bartender and how I thought it was inappropriate.  The bartender then follows me outside and starts yelling at me some more!  It was absolutely uncalled for and ridiculous.  I told him I thought he was being incredibly aggressive and that it was inappropriate.  He then proceeded to tell me that he was being \"assertive\" not aggressive, blah, blah, blah.  \n\nIt's too bad that this bartender was such a jerk because I really liked this place and would have recommended it previously to anyone who was curious about a good spot in North Beach.  Not anymore.", "author": "Hannah F."}

One of the guys who was in my group of friends while studying there - it turns out he's living in SF for three months while he hangs out with his girlfriend who lives in South SF.  He lives in North Beach, and gives me a call so we can catch up.  \n\nNow, I'm all excited and he suggests Tony Nik's.  Having never heard of it before (living in Duboce Triangle, you don't get up to North Beach that much).  So I get there, small bar, good (read: dark) lighting, only two guys in the whole bar.  Who, of course, are gay - because my Fairy Godmother is looking out for me...I haven't been to a \"straight\" bar in a long time, so once I do, the blow is softened by encountering some of the gays.  Phew.\n\nSo I order a drink, siddle up to the bar, and tell the patrons about who I'm about to meet.  So we're having a great old time.  Then my friend comes in and it's a great time catching up.\n\nThen.  Well, I've considerably eased up since my college days, and I should have known that seeing an Aussie friend from college would be a drinking match waiting to happen.\n\nFast forward - 6 Vodka-Tonics later...all is good, but then he tries to kiss me, which is no good, no good at all.  Coincidental timing -- right about this time, the bar starts to fill up with people (and its quite small) so I take this as my cue to leave (that is, after the fat man next to me asked me to feel his behind...and oh yes, his date was next to him).  \n\nGot soaking wet waiting for a cab too.  But, I'd definitely go back - the bar was lovely.  Despite the unwanted advances.  I'll give it four stars, because there's no window to climb out of in the bathroom.", "author": "Leigh c."}

I was pretty good to go and probably didn't need anymore drinks. However, we ventured to this bar/lounge and had a blast. It's not that big at all, but it's very modern and stylish inside. The bartenders were fast and courteous. The music was pretty chill and the crowd was great. \n\nThe other day, I took off from work and just went into the city. After cruising around by myself for a bit, I decided to go into this place again and see how it was when I was more sober. It was still great. There were only a few people inside and I ordered just a beer. The bartender was playing music off his iPod and it was groups such as Thievery Corporation, Nightmares on Wax and other chill groups.\n\nI would recommend coming here with a small group of people (like 2-4) to start your night off.

The Texans who we ran into Friday night were more of a 1.5...\n\nMy boyfriend and I had just enjoyed a lovely Persian dinner down the street by Grant and Green.  We decided to stroll into TN's before going home and  we sat ourselves at the corner of the bar by an aggressive hippie who kept telling my BF to give him more space.  \n\nAfter a drink in, we were startled to hear the bartender barrate a trashed Texan (aged 50 years).

Suffice it to say, things began to worsen.  \n\nAbout a drink later my beau jumped about a foot into the air.\n\nApparently the drunk skank had been goaded by a fellow Texan to stick her tongue in his ear.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-04", "description": "Tony Niks is by far my favorite cocktail den in North Beach. The bar is a throwback to an older more refined era. Most unusually this is manifested in the pure cleanliness of the place. A cleanliness most often reserved for high end hotel bars. The exterior is non-discript, the only noticeable feature being the small wall of glass bricks. Upon entering the small house of spirits you are greeted with a medium length bar on your left with a small area in the very front holding a 2 person table between the window and the curve of the bar. The table and bar comprise a full half of the space. The remaining half holds two diminutive bathrooms and a dark but comfortable lounge area. The back half is partially separated by a curved wall of glass bricks mirroring the front. The bathrooms are just large enough to house the commode and a very tiny sink. really all you need and an efficient use of space. The lounge area comprises of a few tables and very well appointed benches and chairs. Candle light is the principle source for this lounge area. \n\n   Tony Nik's is run by the grandson of the original owner. The grandson takes pride in keeping it as close to original as possible and running it with the same care and ideals as similar gin joints of the era. That said, it is the cocktails and the bartenders that are on point here, complimented by a clean and sophisticated space. Come here for classic cocktails and superior service. Tony Nik's will not be a house that involves intensive modern pretentious mixology utilizing the herbs, spices and other odd ingredients that bartenders scavenged from the kitchen thinking they are a beverage chef. \n\n   The original drinking dens are going the way of the beautiful old movies houses that once use to liberally populate the city.

The decor is sophisticated and cosy, and the bartenders are affable.  This is where you go for a well-made martini, not a drink made in a blender or that tastes like an alcohol-laced smoothie.

I was here last night, and after realizing how long it had been since my last visit, I remembered why I like Tony Nik's so much:\n\n- on weeknights, there is always a place to sit (weekends can be crowded, but that's okay)\n- you can actually hear your companions talking\n- the bartenders are super friendly and nice\n- a lot of the patron's are locals and not skeezy like at some other NB places\n- the atmosphere of the place gives off a good vibe\n\nI really feel like this place is great for all sorts of occasions, whether it's a drink with coworkers, a place to take a date, or whatever.  I've been here for all sorts of reasons (including New Years a few years ago, as well as a Halloween party) and I always have a fantastic time.", "author": "Lindsay B."}

Had they done so anywhere else, they might not have managed to hook me, but that night, they made a believer out of me (and I think were also the impetus for me dying my hair dark brown on a dare, but that part's a bit fuzzy).  I've come back many a time since then, and whether it's for the martinis or a beer, it's still one of the best low-key spots around.", "author": "S T."}

Tuesday nights rock...with a woman dj spinning some awesome classics, the ambiance is nothing short than perfect. Sebastian is a kick ass bartender and wouldn't trade him in for the world.

It was great then, and it's just as great now. Very clean. Great decor. Great cocktail selection and good staff. It's a little off the main drag, so it's pretty much a locals spot (which is a good thing). Only negative is the bathrooms. While very clean, they're smaller than a airplane bathroom. I'm a pretty big guy, so maneuvering around to wash up afterword was an adventure.", "author": "Josh D."}

It's been a while (general aversion to North Beach) and don't ordinarily bring ousiders to the quality niches in the City.  Still don't bring just anyone to the Pig.  The interlopers, however, love the city so you can't fault them, perhaps me.  Anyone who loves walking the streets and avoids the Wharf and a cable car, except the California line, deserves a shot.

So while I am willing to admit to spending far too much time there (which shows my lack of creativity) I feel that I am greatly suited to write said review.  Whether or not you enjoy Tony Nik's really depends on what you're looking for when you got out for a cocktail. If you're looking for a really sweet or highly entertaining (Tom Cruise in Cocktail-esque) bartender to make you fancy blended drinks, then this is NOT the place.  If you are looking to be considered for or to find  \"The Bachelor\" San Francisco male or female, once again, this is probably not the place. If you are looking for an eclectic sampling or North Beach residents (and yes we tend to at times be loud and drunk) and some tourists who are often unwisely referred to the place as another SF \"attraction\",  or a kick back place to hang with friends you bring with you, then Tony Nik's will be right up your alley!", "author": "Andrea S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-02", "description": "I never liked lemon drops before...UNTIL I CAME TO TONY NIK'S! The lemon drops are about $8, which to me isn't that bad in the city. My friend was the one who is responsible for getting me into this place. We go here every other week as part of our \"bi-weekly gossip sessions.\" The reason why I love it so much is that on Sundays it is very quiet and chill. The ambiance is nice and the bartenders in the evening are really cool. I really believe me and my friend make Dave's shift on Sundays so much brighter! I also had the chance to meet the owners and knowing how nice and friendly they are makes it that much more enjoyable to go there. But be careful when there is a big event in the area when you go here because this bar gets packed fast! Especially during the North Beach Festival! But if you go during non-busy hours and want to chill and have a drink this is the place...and the main reason I gave it 5 stars was because the bartenders play music from their own iPods and Dave plays the greatest old school hip-hop music!", "author": "Christine S."}

Tony Nik's staff and management was top notch in making our party easy and completely stress free! We brought in a few things to eat from a great deli a few doors down (La Spiaggia) and let our friends fend for themselves at the bar. The service was friendly and fast, we did a champagne toast for 35 people and had the glasses poured in less than 5 minutes, and they even heated up the arancines we brought and helped pass them out.

Often we go in to grab some drinks before dinner (or after Mass *gasp*) - turns into dinner!  The bartenders are great.  It's one of those bars you feel completely comfortable walking in to and plopping down on a stool even if no one is there.  It's just that inviting.  It's great to watch people walk by outside (tourists, for example) who sort of peer into the door as if it's some sketchy bar.  You just want to yell 'keep walking!!'", "author": "Jocelyn D."}
