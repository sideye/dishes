The non sushi items like the Matcha Ushio-jiru, fish broth Umami soup and and wagyu dish were also excellent. My favorite will always be the Toro and it was sooo good.

As with the other Yelp reviewers, I enjoyed the bar seating as half of the experience was getting to interact with the chef and witnessing the craftsmanship first hand.\n\nI'm not going to go into detail of every piece I had, but I liked that not every course was nigiri. The menu included hot items such as matcha soup and the wagyu stew.\n\nOverall, the tasting menu took me on a real trip. The courses were uniquely smoky, herbal, and buttery. One of my favorites was the torched chutoro so I also got the Ji Kinmedai, \u00e0 la carte, which was also torched and as equally delicious as the chutoro.\n\nI would highly recommend Kusakabe to friends and family looking for a quality omakase restaurant for a special occasion.", "author": "Sylvia Y."}

Again, this place is very deserving on its Michelin star! I tried the 11 course omakase last time so I opted for the petite omakase this time (8 courses...$98). I like the petite one because it was actually very filling and affordable but  I also had room to try some a la carte after . I got the liver Pate and salmon and boyfriend got the eel (fresh and never been frozen, flown straight from Japan that morning) after our omakase \n\nEverything was amazing!! We requested in advance to be seated by the bar and got lucky that we were seated by chef kusakabe's section and got to watch him in action throughout dinner. He was so sweet...we even got a picture with him!! Can't wait to come back again for another special occasion.\n\nEveryone in your party has to order the same omakase. And a la carte is only available after your omakase...so you can't just walk in and order sushi rolls only.", "author": "Caitlin P."}

We spent more than $1000 here for my birthday and we were satisfied.  \nSadly, not tonighy.  It's still pretty good but some of the dishes are not as fresh as before.  Of course I am being super picky here because this is a Michelin star sushi restaurant and it's usually $200 -300 or more a person after alcohol before tips and CA fees.  \n\nThe wine pairing is quite disappointing at the end unfortunately.  Somehow I don't really feel sweet wine goes well with sushi but the first couple choices were awesome. And she would pour our next table full glasses Everytime but 1/4 or 1/3 when it comes to our table. \n\nThe service is also another reason I am not giving 5 stars.   I think the attitude should always be nice and sweet unless the customers are rude and unreasonably.   I don't think requesting a japanese sake menu is unreasonable.   I only recognize the sakes in Japanese.

Kusakabe left me savoring each bite and wishing I had enough room in my stomach to eat more. It was by far one of the best omakase experiences I've had in my life. \n\nWe came here on a Friday night on a last minute reservation. They only do two seatings a day. The restaurant is on an unassuming street across from the Transamerica Building. It's worthwhile to call ahead to get a seat at the bar so you can watch the masters in action crafting your dishes right in front of your eyes. They have a larger table near the front of the restaurant for parties of 4+, a two-topper behind the bar area and a main bar area. \n\nThe service was thorough and attentive. They bring you a hot towel and a glass of water the moment you're seated just like in Japan. We ordered the petite omakase ($98) and the yuzu sake (forgot how much this was). You can upgrade to the regular omakase for an extra hundred dollars. You also have the option to order a la carte after the omakase if you're not quite full or dying for seconds of a particularly good piece. We thought the petite was the right amount of food. \n\nEven though the meal lasted 2 hours, it felt like a blur. The quality of the fish was very high and super fresh. Every dish was impeccably seasoned. I struggle to remember the name of each piece of sushi but everything tasted incredible. We didn't realize that our chef was Kusakabe himself until the end of the meal. Dude is such a low key G. I highly recommend this place for a fantastic omakase meal in SF!", "author": "Laura Y."}

We went here for my birthday dinner / anniversary dinner during our trip to SF. I had heard good things about about this place and was looking for somewhere to eat omakase at.\n\nWe sat at the bar like I had requested and were greeted by the chef once we sat down. He went over what we did like, what we didn't like and asked if we had any dietary restrictions. I had filled out the food allergy part on the online reservation thing so either he was just asking to confirm or that information does not actually make it to the chef who is serving you.\n\nI cannot remember his name but he seemed like he was the head chef there. Throughout our meal we talked about sushi we had, had before and various random things that came up into conversation.\n\nHe gave us a detailed description of each piece that was put in front of us and had instructed us to use our hands and not our chopsticks. I had remembered people doing this at the omakase we had been to before back home but our chef there did not mention anything about using our hands. Since my chopstick skills are not on point, this was definitely easier for me but also added to the experience.\n\nEach piece of fish was fresh and you could just tell it was great quality. The meal left us both satisfied but also left a well worth hole in the wallet. You may see the prices for the omakase on the menu online but if you order drinks, the price of your total check jumps like expected. I would come here for special occasions or when you are ready to spend a lot on a meal.

Everyone was busy but they communicated well and weren't bumping around or reaching over another person which was quite impressive to me.\n\nWe went for the 11 course omakase menu which was $168 per person (not including tip or alcohol) which may come off as steep to many people but one must remember that you're there for an experience!  All of the chefs and wait staff were knowledgeable and were keen to explain every little ingredient in every dish which was very much appreciated (though so expansive it started to go over my head after a while).  They must have sensed this as they brought me the ala cart menu to let me know exactly what we were having which was a nice touch.  \n\nOur chef was young but very precise and I could see the focus he had on every dish.  Speaking of dishes, they were excellent and quite unique in flavor.  This establishment favors meshing of multiple ingredients to create a very delicate but complex flavor profile which is different from other sushi omakases I've been to.  \n\nAll in all my favorite was no doubt the A5 Wagyu beef, Uni, eel, and tuna.  I was quite happy (and full) by the end and they were kind enough to place a new copy of the ala-cart menu as well as the omakase menu into an envelope to bring home with you!\n\nIf you're new to the omakase experience you can always try their \"petite\" omakase which is 8 courses but at a more reasonable $98 per person!", "author": "Bob L."}

When you complete each dish, the chef will work on the next dish for you, and you can watch him make it right in front of you.  Some dishes included scallop and uni straight from Hokkaido, wagyu beef from Miyazaki, and other kinds of seafood that I've never heard of.

I ended up eating here at Kusakabe for Cinco de Mayo and selected their 11 course omakase. Long story short...it was amazing!\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, I was treated very well by all levels of staff. The hostess was incredibly helpful and polite. Servers were super attentive; my glass was never less than half full. My sushi chef Patrick was very friendly and informative about each item that was presented to me.\n\nThe restaurant had a very warm, intimate atmosphere. Very inviting and good for a date night. There were all around little touches I really appreciated like the little hooks near your knee to hang any small bags, how when I came back from the bathroom my napkin was made up again, or the meticulous way they place and plate all your dishes/utensils (even positioning my pen I brought to take notes...what can I say, I'm a nerd!). They treat you right here!\n\nAs for the food...amazing. My favorites were the toro, golden eye snapper, sea bream milt w/ quail egg, wagyu beef, and scallop w/ uni. Really the only item I thought was just okay was the fried carrot and tofu cake in broth.  But that's just being nitpicky. They prepare these items very well. I still can't get over how tender and soft the scallop was; I never thought a scallop could almost melt in my mouth!  \n\nAfter the meal they give you an a la carte menu where you can order more stuff if you choose (I ordered a second helping of the sea bream milt :)).  I really wanted to try more of the stuff on their menu, and am curious to see what all they offer during other seasons. This is an easy 5 stars for me. Kusakabe served some of the best sushi I've ever had in my life!", "author": "Alfie B."}

This place has been on my bookmarks for a loooong time and I was so happy I was finally able to try it.\n\nWe had to wait a little so our 8:15pm seating could all be seated at the same time but no worries. We had some complimentary yuzu sake while we waited. So refreshing! It was so good we ordered some at the end of our dinner!\nBig shout out to sushi Chef Ken! He was very accommodating and friendly, chatting it up with us while he was preparing our fish. \n\nOrdered the Grand Omakase menu and it was so filling! I was dying by the end of the meal.... So it is definitely worth the price! Can't believe how accommodating they were. I was asked what kind of fish I like most, any thing I don't like, etc. I told him I didn't like green onions, cilantro, etc. When I received my soup and it had green onions in it, they were super apologetic and immediately made me another one. I was fine with it but they insisted!! Chef Ken also asked us our favorite sushi places and told us his. Definitely kept those in mind. At the end, I was asked if I wanted to keep a copy of the menu. I just said yes and they gave me this huge envelope to put the menu in with their name on it. So special haha!\n\nI was extremely full and extremely happy after my meal! By the time we walked out the door, it was almost 12am... Can't believe we spent almost 4 hours here....

I've been to a couple other Omokase restaurants in the city and KUSAKABE has been a standard that everyone raves about so I was happy to snag a last second reservation on a Saturday.\n\nDid it live up to the hype? Yes. Everything was so good that it's hard to choose a favorite--you're just going to want anything again. This is the best value omokase in SF (starting at $98) so don't miss out on it if you're a big fan of high-quality sushi. One thing I did miss out on is the A5 Wagyu Beef so be sure to get that (may not be on the $98 menu so get the more expensive menu ($165)or add it a la carte). Service is excellent and the ambience is best described as Japanese ceremonial (just not sitting on a tatami on the floor).\n\nPro tip: If you want a seat at the bar, make your reservation as early as possible and specifically request bar seating. Yes it's worth it because you can interact with the chefs and, more importantly, snap good photos of the sushi! The lighting at the bar is ideal for pictures (versus sitting at a table where it's a bit more dim (I sat at a table--see my posted pictures). Only do table if you're on a date and want to focus 100% on the other person. But, even if you were on a date you should probably do the bar!\n\nSecond pro-tip: Close your eyes as you bite into heavenly bliss for enhanced umami taste sensation!", "author": "Marlon T."}

This place was everything I dreamed it would be and quality was definitely on par with what I experienced in Japan.\n\nKusakabe is Kaiseki style - a Japanese  style of serving food as a multi-course meal. The service was exceptional and all the dishes were amazing. I can see why it's so popular. Be ready to throw down a pretty penny though. For two people with the Grand Omakase option and a couple drinks  I think the total bill came out to about $500 including tip and tax.\n\nToro, uni and the cod smelt were definitely the highlight dishes of the night. I never had cod smelt before and didn't even bother to ask, but was admittedly taken a back post swallow when I found out I had just eaten fresh cod sperm.

Although it lost its Michelin star for 2017, my experience here was first-rate, and I'm hoping it regains its star when the 2018 ratings for the Bay Area are announced this coming week.\n\nOccupying a prime location directly underneath the Transamerica pyramid, Kusakabe is a sleek, modern venue dominated by a large sushi bar that seats about a dozen people. There are also small tables up front that seat another 10-12 people. Because of the limited amount of seating, reservations are virtually mandatory, although I lucked out by walking in as the first in line 20 minutes ahead of opening time.\n\nEven though pricey omakase menus are a dime a dozen in the West Bay these days, I found the top-tier course to be an impressive value given the quality and quantity of the pieces of fish that came my way. In total, there were about 28 pieces to the omakase experience, including items like the amuse bouche, soup, and dessert.\n\nTo start, a modestly fatty series of nigiri that included zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), hirame (halibut), and katsuo (bonito) helped prime the appetite. Next, the relatively chewy sumi ika (Japanese cuttlefish squid) with uni (sea urchin) and sayori (Japanese half beak cured with ryuhi konbu) provided textural contrast. This was followed by a plate of hon maguro (center loin bluefin tuna), kasugodai (bamboo leaf cured young red snapper), and tairagai (ear shell clam) that offered a variety of contrasting seafood flavors. Next came a multi-course presentation of baby sea eel, wagyu rice cracker croquette, crab cake, Washington oyster with caviar, octopus with octopus roe, tuna cake, and egg cake, all of which offered unique tastes and textures.\n\nThis was followed by a palate-cleansing bowl of soup, which opened the way for a course of shima aji (stripe jack), a super-delicious piece of copper river king salmon, and ebodai (Japanese butter fish), followed further by bafun uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin) and a deliciously seared piece of shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel with sansho pepper). Next came the ultimate in savory fattiness: a piece of toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and an exquisitely heavenly piece of wagyu beef. Then, a course of umimasu (lightly poached Tasmanian ocean trout), ji kinmedai (golden eye snapper) and gyoku (fresh lobster omelet with organic egg), followed by dessert, rounded out what was a truly indulgent omakase experience.\n\nBite after bite, everything was simply amazing. Service was also helpful and professional, and all in all it was fantastic value given the price, quantity, and quality of what I got. Highly recommended!", "author": "Vincent L."}

We had the pleasure of sitting at the bar, served by Chef Kusakabe himself. It was a pleasure watching him skillfully and meticulously prepare his kaiseki-style sushi. The chef was a very gracious host, patiently explaining in detail each beautiful piece of nigiri. \n\nHighlights of the meal included cod milt with uni. Milt is nearly impossible to find here in the US (I couldn't even find it in Japan). The chef gently explained that milt is \"a type of egg.\" Since I knew what it was, I asked him if it was a \"male egg\" which he nodded. I've not had milt before, but I must say that it perfectly complemented the uni and it was incredible. Other favorites were the amazing toro, Hokkaido uni, and A5 Wagu beef. \n\nThe service was friendly and efficient - our sommelier helped us choose some pleasant and crisp sake to accompany our meal, along with a nice pinot noir as the dishes got progressively heavier. \n\nOverall - the meal was very expensive, but also of incredibly high quality and was well worth it.

The first was sashimi in a plastic box from Draeger's. The second was poke in a plastic box from Costco. The third was supposed to be Kusakabe's hyped-up fare served on their many mini marvelous plates. It didn't happen. I'm going back to the plastic boxes.\n\nThe sashimi from Draeger's was light and nuanced. The poke from Costco was hearty and so fresh that I could almost see it wriggling. Kusakabe could learn from both. Flashes of brilliance were overshadowed by an excess of salt and smoke. Fresh it (mostly) was not. At ten times the price of the plastic boxes, I expect better.\n\nSF's gastronomist googlers can rip me for not knowing of what I speak. They may be right. I am just a blue collar stiff who, on rare occasion, experiences their everyday privilege. Even so, I also just know what tastes good. For the price, this didn't taste nearly good enough.\n\n- Bar Seating... Good Luck with That -\n\nWe requested bar seating in the online reservation form. I then called the next day and requested bar seating with a live person. Many weeks later, we were the first at the door. It didn't matter. We got the distant corner.\n\nWe were then told that it's first reserved for a particular day, first served at the bar. I'm sorry if I missed it, but I didn't see that on their site. It would have been nice if they had told me that when I called in. We waited weeks for our reservation. We would have waited a few more to get bar seating.\n\nIf what we were told is true, your best bet is to make a reservation as far out as their system will allow. Having said that, I've now read some reviews that suggest their bar seating policy is inconsistent.\n\n-  Excellent Service -\n\nThe service was outstanding. We loved every one of the staff. Well... except for the young lady who was just a tiny bit snippy. That nitpick aside, they were all extremely nice and very efficient.\n\nEven so, the service didn't justify the price. Yes.

My friend and I decided to go all out and did the 11 course. On top of that we each ordered sake. We're not to familiar with sake, so we asked our waitress. All she asked was what type of alcohol do we usually drink and she knew exactly what we'd like! I don't quite remember the name of the sake we had, but the one that I chose had a fruity after taste. It matched my taste bud and went well with the meal!\n\nWe had the pleasure of meeting Chef Kusakabe and we were lucky enough to have a seat in the center of the bar, so we got to see each chef prepare each dish.  It takes teamwork to shape the perfect experience for the customers and the staff here were definitely well trained. They're also really friendly; my friend and I had a nice chat with the chefs and got to learn about how they ended up at Kuskabe. Each plate was phenomenal and perfectly executed in a timely manner. The fish was very fresh, especially the uni. I've had bad experiences with uni so I was very hesitant to try, but the uni here changed my viewpoint. Although it says 11 courses, within each course were more plates. In the end, we had at least 17 plates of food. We were beyond full and could barely finish our dessert. However if you're still hungry, they do offer a la carte items! Since we came here to celebrate my birthday, they gave a free dessert so I chose the tofu tiramisu! This was fantastic because it was light and not too sweet.

After researching a couple of restaurants in SF, I decided to come here for the \"Grand Omakase\" ($165, 10 courses). All of the courses were delicious and thoughtfully made, and watching the sushi chef create each piece made the dining experience even more wonderful.\n\nEach course was amazing, with the perfect fish to rice ratio and just the right amount of sauce and garnish to bring out the true flavours of the fish. Moreover, I liked the different textures of all the dishes and how the dishes were ordered to make the eating experience really enjoyable. In particular, my favourites would be the bonito sushi and the wagyu sushi. I'd never had bonito sushi before, but its smokey and rich flavour stuck in my mind long after the meal. Moreover, the wagyu beef was so silky, decadent, and packed with umami that it was one of my favourites even though it wasn't fish. \n\nI was lucky enough to get a seat at the bar, and I'd say that half of the experience was watching the sushi chef work his magic! It was so enthralling to observe him assemble each perfect piece of sushi, and I also really enjoyed listening to the description of each course as it was being served. The servers are very professional, and the atmosphere here is upscale but not overly formal.

I wasn't sure if i could do the 10 course or the 7 course.  But i knew i wanted to order a few items a la carte, so i went with the 7 course menu.  When they seated us, they sat us at the bar! I love sitting at the bar because that's where you get to watch all the action.  My chef's name was Patrick and he was a great host and chef the whole evening.  The way this place works, is that you are supposed to use your hands to eat the sushi.  There will be some dishes that will require chopsticks.\n\nTo start off the night, we got the sake flight.  It's 3 different types of sake- Junmai, Ginjo, and Daiginjo.  The Junami sake we got was the Heart and soul- this was my 2nd favorite of the three.  The Ginjo sake was the Flying dragon- this was my least favorite.   The Daiginjo sake was the Sophisticated Mind- this was my favorite and by far the strongest among the three.  \n\nAnd now the begin the 7 course menu\n\nThe ichiban Dashi was like soup.  This soup had a very refreshing taste to it. \n\nSushi Prelude- Zuke Chutoro and halibut was fresh and sweet.  The smoked tuna was ok, but i'm biased, i never liked anything smoked\n\nSashimi-Also fresh and felt like it melted in your mouth\n\nHassan- 6 kinds of chef's assorted les petit.  This dish included a clam in a creamy corn sauce, which i loved.   The soft shell crab was really good.  The beef tartar was on a rice cracker which made it the perfect combo.  Jellyfish and the asparagus with shrimp was my least favorite because i normally don't like jellyfish and asparagus.  The oyster was sweet and super fresh.  There was no particular way to eat this, so i did it from least to favorite.  Save the best for last right?\n\nSoup- This fish soup was sweet and you can tell the spent time making this to get it to have this flavor, because i know that fish soup isn't easy to make.  A bonus to this soup is that it came with noodles. \n\nSeasonal Sushi- Yellowtail- really good,  Mackerel with egg yolk - this one was my favorite.  I love egg, so i loved how this was topped with egg yolk.  The first fish was a fish from a salmon family- this was ok, but it was really hard to top the Mackerel one! \n\nFinale- Scallop with Santa barbara Uni-  This one was tasty.  The scallop was so fresh along with the uni.  \n\nA la Carte-  Bafun Uni- This was like a party in your mouth.  Yes, it did give you the melt in your mouth taste and i wished i had more. I wanted more, but i was starting to get full\n\nWagyu-  This was good, but i think i liked the uni more. \n\nFor dessert I got the Cream Brulee- by far the best creme brulee i've ever had. It was perfect and not too sweet. \n\nYuzu sorbet-  this was very refreshing and perfect if you're a yuzu lover.  \n\nThe service was great and attentive.  They comp. my bday dessert which i didn't expect.  I will really want to come back again, but next time i'll try the 10 course menu and try all their uni selections!

This meant we were about 15 minutes early, and when we walked by their doors were still locked. We strolled around the area a bit (nothing to see though), but it would've been nice if they had a sitting/waiting area for people who are early. Impossible with how small the place is though! They have enough bar seats for maybe 20-ish people, and then a couple 2-4 tops to the side. \n\nWhen they called to confirm my reservations, I asked for bar seating and I believe they said they had it available. I don't think there was an option to make a note when I made the reservations online. \n\nHighlights of the Grand Omakase:\n- Bonito: This was smoked and topped with spiced radish. I'm not usually a fan of smokiness, but I remember really enjoying it. \n- Baby anago with quail egg: Very interesting!

The fuji sake w/ cherry leaf had a bitterness that I didn't really enjoy, but I think it was intended.

I've tried numerous Michelin Star Sushi places in the city and the best Sushi spots in So Cal and this is by far my favorite.  Yes, it's better than even the sushi at the Tokyo fish market (albeit more expensive; but so is a flight to Japan).\n\nKusakabe blends traditional and modern perfectly. It provides multiple complex flavors with each bite. It's made to please everyone and it's quite different than Omakase's edomae style, for example. It's very San Francisco's and it incorporates things like avocado. That being said it still keeps the tradition of sushi and respectfully modernizes it and elevates the flavor profiles. Nothing quite like it.\n\nMake sure to ask to be seated at the bar so you can converse with your chef and make it a personal experience (bonus points: ask for the main Chef, Mitsunori). Ask them about why they are there and how hard they had to work to get where they are. Trust me, it will change your perspective on sushi and you'll find a new appreciation for the art (oh and if you don't know proper etiquette, they'll teach you that, too). Already experienced at fine dining and sushi? You can have more complex conversations about the specific sushi, techniques, ask for the Wagyu Beef's certificate, etc. \n\nI've done table seating, too, and it's a completely different experience. That being said, if you want to minimize the interactions with chefs, the staff, and want to just eat your food in peace and privacy, you can go the table route.\n\nThe food is amazing, the pairings fit well, and the staff is perfect. \n\nSo what should you get? I'd say if you are going, might as well get the grand omakase! And while you are at it, at the end go crazy and get things like toro with uni, gold flakes and caviar (if available). Their wagyu is also A5 Grade 12! Make sure to enjoy every bite. If you are more of an expert with a developed and specific taste, you can go with the regular omakase and get exactly what you want a la carte after to maximize the customization of your meal and have more of exactly what you want.", "author": "Mario B."}

Online reservation is very convenient, unlike some other restaurants calling them is the only way to make reservation. We were very excited for this meal because it was both of our first time having omakase. Seeing all the great reviews and mouthwatering photos of the sushi gave us really high expectation for this place. We were 30 minutes early(we though there would be traffic but there was none) but was seated promptly. We were given three menus: omakase/petite omakase menu, sake/wine pairing menu, regular sake/wine menu. The server didn't tell us there was an a la carte menu but I heard the server at the next table told his customers and explained the difference between the two omakase menu. I wanted to do the petite omakase and ordered from a la carte menu afterwards, but my boyfriend wanted to try the full omakase. It was his birthday so I let him pick whatever. We didn't do the pairing because we tried wine pairing at another restaurant on my birthday and I was buzzed half way through and couldn't enjoy the rest of the meal. However we did ordered an 8oz sake to drink slowly throughout the course. The first half of the menu was AMAZING. The fish were very fresh and flavorful. The second half of the menu was not as amazing as the first half. Maybe because I was getting full since I ate a lot in the morning. I should have thought it through. For the last 4-5 courses I was shoveling food down my throat without really spent time tasting them in my mouth. I was so full I had to give a few pieces of my sushi to my boyfriend. I am sure the sushi courses would taste a lot better if I had the appetite. However I didn't really enjoy the petit plates and the wagyu tongue stew no matter if I was full or not. Reading the reviews I know most people love these two courses, but maybe I have a different palate. I liked the fish a lot more. Honestly I don't think we would have missed out if we had picked the petite omakase. Frankly speaking Im not being entirely fair to the restaurant since I got full half way. So I asked my boyfriend if he enjoyed it and he said not really. The only thing he liked was the uni. But I will definitely bookmark this restaurant and come back here again with a very empty stomach so I can update a fairer review next time!\n\nI totally forgot to take pictures of the second half courses. I was so full and just wanted to get them over with.", "author": "Lisa M."}

This was my first Japanese Omakase experience, so I probably should've went with the bar seating. We chose the regular omakase and added the wagyu sashimi from the a la carte menu. The quality of the fish they used was the freshest I've had in the city! Everything was presented beautifully. We also got the sake pairing with our omakase, and unless you're willing to drink A LOT during this meal, I advise you to pass on this (it's not cheap either haha). We got a super generous amount of sake for every course, so much that I shamefully did not finish and avoided eye contact with the server every time she took away our glasses. Overall, it was a good experience. Next time, I'll definitely get a seat at the bar and no sake pairing.", "author": "Nancy C."}

We enjoyed the entire experience and so did everyone around us. We had a couple next to us visiting from NY, which has TONS of food, but they still thought Kusakabe was good.\n\nThey do a 7 course omakase for $98 or a 12 for $165. Near the end of your omakase, they give you an a la carte menu, so you can always order more! We did the 7 course and both got a  wagyu nigiri from a la carte and that was such a good amount. GET THE WAGYU NIGIRI!!! This was mind-blowingly good. We still talk about it and we regret not getting another 1....or 2...or 7 lol the sake creme brulee was so good as well.\n\nI really liked our sushi chef, who took time to answer any questions and who gave me the best dang uni ever haha he must have heard the longing in my voice when I was talking about how much I love uni, because for our last course, he subbed out the fish and gave me uni!!! They recommend you eat all the nigiri with your hands so that was super fun. We didn't take too many pictures because we couldn't help ourselves from devouring everything right when it was placed on our plate....hey.....don't let the freshness go to waste!!!\n\nYes, Kusakabe is $$$, so it's not a place I can eat every month, but it is a nice place to go and celebrate something.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-07", "description": "Since Kusabake is an omakase restaurant,\u00a0I was hoping we can sit in front of the sushi bar to see\u00a0how they prepare\u00a0the sushi and serve it right in front of us. However, it was disappointing to find out\u00a0party of two or more were not able to sit by the sushi bar and we had 4 people. I feel like that is part of the experience if I was to dish out $200 bucks for a meal.\u00a0\n\nWe were seated promptly by our reservation time at 8:15 and we chose the Grand Omakase\u00a0because of the delicacy menu options (Truffle, A5 Wagyu beef, Hokkaido Sea Urchin, Eel from Tsukiji Market and Toro bluefin fatty tuna belly). An important thing to point out is we were NEVER served the Toro bluefin fatty tuna belly like the menu stated. Instead we were served Negitoro, which is minced fatty tuna with micro onion on a roasted seaweed. Those are two very different things, I wanted to ask why we were served the negitoro instead of the fatty tuna belly, but since my friends didn't mention I didn't want to be particular. Now that I think about it, I am quite angry that the manager didn't mention anything at all about switching our menu.\u00a0\n\nAnyways, a review on the food that we DID have. It was a 10 course menu (with 2 soups) and it was more than enough. A tip for everyone, if you want to do a la carte towards the end, I suggest you choose the regular Omakase with less courses. Actually with the Grand Omakase, there is a course with non-sashimi/sushi dish. So if you here for the sushi/sashimi definitely choose the regular Omakase then do a la carte at the end.\u00a0\n\nOne thing to note about the sushi here is that they seasoned all their rice. At first it looked like brown rice, then we realized every piece of rice has soy sauce seasoned so the flavor is even throughout. My favorite sushi\u00a0would definitely be the Oshinogi with Scallop+Uni sushi,\u00a0Nata with poached egg on spoon, the uni sushi and surprisingly the Shima Aji (stripe jack) which is the chef's choice of sushi. The Hassun which included 6 small plates was also very tasty, I love how the food is like art. The wagyu beef tartare was one of the most delicious tartare that I ever had.\u00a0The most disappointing course would definitely be the seared A5 Wagyu sushi, they over-seasoned it with too much pepper and salt overpowering the taste of the wagyu. It felt like they wasted a perfectly fine piece of meat, except the meat itself had a bit too much lines in it.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Kusakabe for Omakase on a special occasion or if you are visiting from out of town. It seems like a popular date place, you can impress somebody\u00a0by bringing them here and eating in front of the sushi bar. It's a shame we didn't get to sit there to watch as the sushi chef prepare our dishes. There might have been 1 or 2 disappointment, nevertheless it was a good experience. And I figured out why they lost their star;\u00a0it was not perfect like it should be.", "author": "Gloria C."}

Michelin one star for the past two years, yet was taken away the star this year, unfortunately.\n\nPlus: all their uni was from Hokkaido (I personally did not like Uni from the west coast - it was big in size yet less flavorful), so made it a great combo with either the scallop or the vinegar rice itself. Also, the wagyu beef was seared just to the right level of tenderness, and carried a little smooth texture on top, very unique taste!\n\nMinus: the cooked sweet fish was a bit bitter that I did not find myself quite fond of. \n\nThis is my first Kaiseki in the west coast and pros certainly overweighted cons. Kusakabe definitely worth a star in my opinion, compared with some of the east coast sushi places. \n\nLast piece of advice - don't miss the dessert part, as it was not included in the Kaiseki fixed menu.", "author": "Elaine H."}

Of course, no unwanted particles (no sand whoot), and the oyster was not super briney, but rather smooth and citrusy. \n- Croquette was interesting. Sweet miso on top.\n- Baby eel bowl: the flavours was very clean, crisp, and clear.

Let me tell you that this experience was life-changing. The food was phenomenal: there were a lot of firsts thrown in there that my boyfriend and I have never tried before or expected to be on the menu; the plating was simple but impactful; the course was designed around each other in perfect, delicious symphony.\n\nI believe we had the spring seasonal course. We enjoyed some of the dishes so much that we had to call back the waiter to tell us what it was again -- and then we took notes because we loved it so much!! Here are some of the notable favorites:\n- Japanese amberjack with plum base, cured kelp, and mountain yam\n- Kasugodai (cured) with bamboo leaf and red snapper\n- Two week aged otoro (fat of tuna)\n\nThis was an anniversary dinner and they gave both of the desserts we ordered on the house! Dishes were cleared in a better than timely manner -- it was like they were reading our minds! We were served at our own pace but each meal was made just in time for the plating.

The chef takes your a wonderful sushi dinner experience with omasake menu options. It was just an incredible experience something I would love to do again. \n\nFirst I must say the severs are just so well versed in the history of the food and all the menu items. They went into detail explaining what we were eating. It is traditional to eat with your hands. They start with providing warm hand towels to clean your hands and then they leave you a tiny finger cleaning cloth. The first dish is a warm soup a pallet cleanser. Very mild flavor but still very good. Each dish was beautifully plated and served. It was like honestly hard to eat it because it was like food art. Each dish was incredible, I just can't put into words how wonderful each piece of sushi was. The fish was fresh, flavorful and just melted in your mouth. The flavors on each were do dynamic and different. They offer a drink pairing with each dish but we had their house matcha instead. It was incredible. The hot tea was perfect for keeping us warm and for prepping our palate for the next serving. \n\nOverall a beautiful and incredible sushi experience. This is definitely for a real sushi lover.

We celebrated his birthday and were lucky enough to get bar seating.

Friendly hosts, servers and sushi chefs made the entire experience even more enjoyable. We were so happy to get bar seating. We checked in early around 7:30 hoping that if we came in early it would determine our seating place. However, it looks like it depends on how early you make your reservations and your party size. The smaller the party and the earlier you reserve, you'll likely get a bar seat. \n\nWe started with a nice warm hand towel and then the dashi broth which was honestly one of my favorite parts of the meal. We decided to chose the regular omakase and order a la carte afterwards. Some highlights from our meal was of course the dashi broth, blue fin tuna, red miso broth, and the list goes on. Everything was wonderfully made and delicious. I found myself closing my eyes and thinking holy crap with every bite I had. To finish our meal we tried the wagyu beef which is a must!!! It's included in the grand omakase and available on the a la carte menu. Definitely worth the $14 for each piece. \n\nAll in all, this is a must if you're a fan of sushi or if you're celebrating an event.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-11", "description": "Kusakabe is an experience. You go for the chef-led omakase and are presented with course after course of beautifully-formed, high-quality dishes that take your palate on a little tour of Japanese flavors and techniques. The dining room is small and reservations are required, but I got to come with a group of seven friends, and it was a great experience trying and discussing all the different courses together. This is not your typical, run-of-the-mill sushi, so be prepared to splurge (the base menu comes at a hefty $98/head), and come with an appreciation for the quality and cost of purveyance of the ingredients. \n\nCourse #1: a subtly-flavored dashi broth. Nothing unusual (after all, there are only three ingredients in this fish-based broth), but very clean tasting and a nice way to start the meal.\n\nCourse #2: The zuku chutoro (bluefin medium fatty tuna) was seared on one side, giving the fish a great texture to complement its flavors. The hirame halibut with its own liver had a slightly spicy kick, and the cold-smoked bonito (katsuo) resounded with the flavors of the wood smoke.\n\nCourse #3: Bluefin sashimi and poached amberjack (a surprising favorite of mine). These pieces were served simply with soy and yuzu onion sauces, and came with little slices of fuji apple and radish. You had some of every flavor here--sweet from the apple, bitter from the radish, salty/umami from the soy, and tart from the yuzu. \n\nCourse 4: By far the most beautifully plated, the \"Hassun\" came with an oyster with caviar in the center, surrounded by five small dishes--Japanese sardines with mushrooms and broth, the Wagyu beef fritter (mostly potato, but it had the distinctly funky aroma of raw Wagyu), the jellyfish (paired with crunchy pinenuts and cucumber), and a sweet tai (red sea bream) sushi roll with asparagus in the middle. But my favorite dish was definitely the soft-shell crab, which was so creamy on the inside and delicately crunchy on the inside!\n\nCourse 5: Red miso soup with a duck and lotus root meatball, layered with soy cream foam. Delicious, umami soup with layers of flavor that change as you sip, and the lotus root adds an unexpected, pleasant chewiness to the meatball.\n\nCourse 6: My favorite sushi of the meal was the shima aji, the stripe jack with daikon radish, which was so buttery in texture and had a scallop-like flavor. The cherry salmon and the kasugodai (red snapper with crystallized egg yolk) both melted in your mouth as well. Unbelievable!\n\nCourse 7: a finale of toro (fatty Bluefin tuna) and a nori roll with bafun uni (sea urchin) and ikura (fish roe). The toro is definitely the best I've had in the US, but there was too little uni in the roll to really appreciate its briny flavors.\n\nCourse by course, everyone is served at the same time, and the staff explain each and every component--the work that goes behind each of these dishes/components is indeed immense! After the omakase meal, we were given an a la carte menu, from which we could order even more sushi or sashimi. I got the aori ika (big fin reef squid), which was extremely creamy in texture, though not particularly vibrant in flavor. \n\nAnd then we went for dessert! We ordered one of each item to share, and each of the desserts was so unique. The yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet was nice and refreshing (slightly acidic and herbal flavors), the (unsweetened kome koji) ice cream had sweetness imparted to it from the same fermented flavors that you find in sake, and the Daiginjo sake kasu cr\u00e8me brulee had the same fermented flavors as the ice cream, but was much sweeter and decadent.\n\nOverall, a great meal and definitely something to experience! The restaurant itself is small but homey and authentic (the bathroom even features an automated Japanese toilet). The service is the epitome of Japanese hospitality and the prices are exorbitant, so make sure to come with an appreciation of the work, care, and quality that goes behind each bite of food.", "author": "David K."}

If I could describe the feeling of being cradled and rocked to sleep as an adult, it would be my experience at Kusakabe.\n\nWe got stuck in awful traffic coming up the peninsula and ended up getting to the restaurant 45 minutes after our reservation time. The most stressful part of the trip was not being able to get a hold of anyone at the restaurant because their phones shut down after 4pm. I left a message anyways to let them know my situation and they ended up calling me back to confirm. When we arrived, they seated us immediately and didn't give us too much crap for being so late. :-)\n\nThe main reason for dining here was to celebrate the BF's birthday and eat his favorite food, sushi. My sushi tolerance typically doesn't extend beyond a rainbow roll so it was exciting to see what really good sushi should taste like. I also let the restaurant know in advance what the occasion was and they were FABULOUS about making the evening special for him.\n\nWe went with the Omakase ($95/pp) option and an 8oz of the Kenbishi Junmai sake (yum).\n- First brewed broth: Great start to the meal to cleanse the palate with gentle flavors from the dried Konbu (kelp)\n- Zuke Chutoro (bluefin fatty tuna) was my favorite. I ordered another one a-la-carte at the end of the meal.\n- Loved the fried fish and crab claw that came with the oyster dish!!\n- We ordered the Houji-cha ice cream for dessert and brought it out with a candle so I could quietly sing happy birthday :-) (also comp'd the dessert)\n\nAt one point, I dropped my chopsticks and before I could swoop down to pick it up, the chef made a few gestures and a new pair arrived...magic. I also mentioned to our server that it would be hard to remember all the names of everything we ordered so they packed the menus for us in a large envelope and wrote 'happy birthday' on it.\n\nFrom the quality of our meal to the thoughtfulness of our chef and the entire restaurant staff, they went above and beyond to make this event truly memorable and special.", "author": "Kat C."}

We were literally the last ones in the restaurant the night before the news broke that Kusakabe lost its Star. Compared to Wako, Kusakabe was probably not as worth the money and the fish at Wako was of slightly higher quality than here, hence the -0.5 stars. However, it is still a reasonable meal at $98 for the quality of the fish and craftsmanship of the nigiri. I would definitely recommend trying to get a reservation if you have a special event to celebrate. \n\n[Omakase]\nA-la-carte menu is always the best part of omakase, in my opinion. I go to experience the A5 wagyu beef nigiri, and it blew my mind. My other favorite roll was the Toro. I didn't know fish could taste like this (I guess it does at $15 extra per piece). I also really like the Sashimi. Oyster set was very creative. Since it was my birthday, the restaurant gave me a sorbet on the house that I thought was really nice! Otherwise, desert is extra. I did still feel hungry after my regular Omakase, so I would recommend maybe upgrading to the Grand.  You're going to want to spend more on extra nigiri at the end anyway so you might as well.\n\n[Service / Decor]\nOur chef was great. He explained each piece to us and, sitting at the bar, we were able to watch the nigiri come to life right before our eyes. I really like the decor of the restaurant. It was slightly larger than the overage Omakase, but still cozy and well lit. \n\nOverall, I think Kusakabe is a great restaurant that offers great Omakase with pricing in line with comparable restaurants. I did like Wako slightly more, but both are still worth trying.", "author": "Alice Z."}

It is really awesome. I think there are 7 pieces of nigiri and 1 nori roll. The condiment of each nigiri is so well-matched. My favorite one is the Scallop with Santa Barbara uni on top. OMG, it is really amazing. The portion of the rice is not a lot which is really what I like and should be what an authentic nigiri be like.  \nFor other places i've been to like Hinata, they put too much rice for nigiri. \n\nThe environment is comfortable but the table is kind of too high. \n\nReason why I gave 3 star even though the food is really good is below. \nI got there at around 535 and my friend hasn't got there yet. I explained to the staff saying that my friend will be late for maybe at least 30 mins because of the traffic. And she looked unhappy. I told her that I could just sit down and order for my friend. I said the chef could just make two portion of the sushi and put my friend's portion in a plate or something. After my friend comes, he could just enjoy it. \n\nShe was like, there's \"no place\" to put the nigiri. we don't do to-go box. And then she kept suggesting me that my friend has to be here before 6 otherwise, they can't serve us. I was like.. THIS IS CRAZY. I already got here and do i have to just waste money and eat nothing? She explained to me that the second-seating guests will come at 8pm so there is no enough time for the chef to serve us if my friend comes after 6. I told her that we eat very fast. But then she pushed back again saying that even if you guys eat fast and chef can't make the food fast. It still has to depend on the chef. She even said that if my friend comes after 6, then the chef won't have enough time to serve all the food ( even if we paid the same price as others....\n\nAt the end, my friend came at around 5:50PM. And then she took us to our seats. We finished at around \"7PM\". ( i was like.. how come there won't be enough time if my friend come after 6..) Also, there's a small plate in front of everyone. But she said that there's no PLACE to put nigiri if I sit in and order for my friend first.\n\nI totally understand that she wanted us to enjoy an authentic and comfortable eating environment for omakase. But i feel the way she communicated to me is like.. \"YOU can't eat until your friend comes and you are going to just throw your money to trash can WITHOUT eating anything if your friend doesn't come before 6 even if I AM already here\" \n\nAlso,The bathroom is broken and the staff told me that she will have people take me to another bathroom. \n\nBased on the experience with the front staff, suggest people have to be arriving at exactly the time you reserve and no one in your group could be late. \nFor me, I will not come again even the food is REALLY awesome.", "author": "Tina H."}

We opted for the regular Omakase course and almost every single piece of sushi we had was as amazing as the next. The flavor and texture of each nigiri was exactly the way I like it, and I really enjoyed the rice which was more tart than some sushi places. The ginger also tasted less sweet and more sour which I enjoyed as well.\n\nThe stand outs for me were the Shima Aji (stripe jack) and the Katsuo (bonito) which was lightly smoked with cherry wood. The subtle smoky flavor was aromatic and complemented the perfectly fatty fish topped with the momiji oroshi (grated daikon radish with chili peppers) which added a hint of spice. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! \n\nWe were lucky enough to score a reservation at 5:30pm but arrived a bit early and were seated at the sushi bar. I don't think I would want to dine here unless I was guaranteed the sushi bar. It really makes a HUGE difference in both the service and the taste and flavor of the sushi and when you're paying the same amount, why not opt for the option that's twice as better? \n\nThe excellent service, GREAT sushi, and the glass of ros\u00e9 I had puts Kusakabe in the top 3 best sushi experiences I've had in the US! The ONLY reason why it may not be number 1 was because the bafun uni had a slight ammonia flavor which I couldn't get past. I have an EXTREMELY sensitive sense of smell so to others it may taste perfectly fine! \n\nOverall I highly recommend this restaurant for any special\noccasion or if you're in town looking for great sushi. It is on the pricy side but much more affordable compared to high-end sushi places in Manhattan or LA.", "author": "Sarah A."}

Just the quality of the food and service should automatically give this place more than 5 stars. Reservations must be made in advance and I believe there are 2 seatings - one at 5 and another at 8. I made my reservation months in advance.  This place is very small and a little hidden but has a cute entrance through a curtain. The inside had a very nice ambiance going on and was very intimate. There was bar seating and a few table seating on the side but I suggest you choose the bar seating (or hopefully you get lucky enough to get bar seating) because you get the watch the sushi chefs make your omakase and have them explain each and every piece to you.\n\nTheir omakase menu changes from time to time but their dinner is priced at either $95pp or $150 pp for their grand omakase. I say you should get the grand omakase because it's so much more worth it if you're already going to spend $$$$ - might as well go all out! I also recommend that you try both the a5 wagyu and the toro... AND the UNI!! I can tell you that their uni here is to die for!! Specifically their deep sea hokkaido uni - it literally melts in your mouth and taste like heaven for a few seconds. (It is also their most expensive item on their ala carte menu) everything on their menu was just mouthwatering.\n\nThe service here is incomparable to other places - they treat you like a king and queen from seating you and even putting your coats on. They are also quick to refill your drinks/clean your tables and all other manners they are quick to address. Please do make some time if you come to the later seating. We sat down at 8pm and probably did not leave the restaurant till 11pm. Also if it's your birthday - tell them in advance!  They will comp you a item from their dessert menu. :)", "author": "Sherry L."}

There are two menu options: petit omakase ($98 for 8 courses) or omakase ($168 for 11). The biggest difference is the wagyu dish. We chose the omakase. While there are technically 11 courses, some come with multiple pieces of sushi or bites of food. Overall, I was very happy with the quality and preparation of food. It is comparable to some of the best places I've been in NYC. My only complaint is that for $168, it should have included dessert. We got the yuzu shiso leaf sorbet which was light and refreshing but feel it should have been included. My husband's favorite course was the wagyu; mine was the scallop", "author": "Musetta S."}

Nonetheless, I want to share my thoughts on my experience on one of the best meals I've had.\n\nWith a part of three, we made reservations a couple months in advanced to sit at the bar for the full omakase experience. Doors don't open until exactly 5:00PM. Through the curtains is a narrow hall and doorway. Upon entering, the host will ask for your reservation and you will be seated in your designated spots. The space is narrow, with not very many seats, hence the limited reservations each night and it usually doesn't get too loud. \n\nYou'll get a chance to look over their two menus: the first for omakase ($95 or $150) and the other for drinks. We opted for the $95 and some sake, of course. They started us off with some dashi broth, which was really nice on a cold, rainy evening. Then came the sushi. While there are chopsticks provided, we used our fingers for the most part. There's a bit of cloth for you to wipe your fingers on between pieces and some food items are much easier to handle with chopsticks, so there's no pressure. Each piece of sushi was so special and the taste so unique. The Zuke Toro was the most unforgettable one, so much that later on, we ordered another round a la carte. Super excited that there was some uni involved as well. Chef's assorted Les petit plats was just so pretty to look at and even better to eat.  We finished off with some tea and creme brulee. \n\nOur Chef Matt was very willing to answer our questions about sushi, the restaurant, his experience as a chef, etc. and interacted with us. Definitely added to our experience and understanding of what we were eating, so I would recommend sitting at the bar. \n\nIf this is what heaven tastes like, just kill me now.

My boyfriend & I ordered the $98 omakase that included the 8 dishes. Every dish was executed in a very timely manner. The starter soup was very good & soothing especially for the cold SF weather. As for the nigiri, Kusakabe's style has more of a hickory smoked/ bonito flavor and the other dishes were beautifully presented to us...but after a while I felt like it tasted ehhhh...the ratio of the fish and the marinated rice tasted the same dish after dish....we ordered a few more items such as the organic lobster omelette and the Miyazaki wagyu....Wagyu was lightly salted and it was good...I felt like we could skip on the lobster omelette because we couldn't taste any lobster....despite my rating on the restaurant itself....everything else was impeccable!

The sushi was probably some of the best sushi I have ever had in my life. The fish was really the star and all the additions added did not overwhelm what you are ultimately here for, which is the fish. Kusakabe did a brilliant job of elevating high-quality fish through the use of umami soy sauce, shiso leaves, yuzu etc. These ingredients brought out the flavor of the fish and gave it something extra.\n\nThe stars for me was the Kegani which was Hokkaido crab with quail egg (this is usually served with shrimp but since I don't like shrimp, they substituted with crab), Hotate (Hokkaido scallop topped with uni) and Zuke Chutoro (bluefin tuna).\n\nDishes that I was not too crazy about were les petit plats and the wagyu rib cap (tasted too fatty and oily...yes, I like marbled meats but this was too much). The Miyazaki wagyu they served later nigiri-style was much better in my opinion. \n\nWe definitely felt full afterwards and felt that we had a very enjoyable and special experience.

There is street parking and some pretty cheap parking garages close by. We sat in front of Chef Ken and had an amazing time. \n\nFor drinks, we started off with the sake flight ($50) and some Koshihikari Echigo beer ($9), which I really enjoyed - I've never tried it before and I've never seen it in any Japanese restaurants I've been to. We decided on the Grand Omakase ($150 per person), it comes with 25 items. They start off by asking if you have any allergies and what your favorite type of sushi is, then you start your dinner! \n\nYou wipe your hands with the towel they provide and the chef explains that you eat the nigiri with your fingers and they seasoned it already so there's no soy sauce. You use chopsticks for everything else. It's really fun because they explain what they're serving you each time and they wait until you're done before they serve the next item.\n\nI won't go into too much depth because their menu changes a little every night depending on what is fresh. I tried so many different things and even though we were served some sushi that I'm not usually a fan of, I decided to try it anyways and it was worth it because everything is so fresh and tasty. \n\nAt the end, if you choose the Grand Omakase, you get to choose between toro or wagyu. I decided on the toro and then decided to try the wagyu from the a la carte menu afterwards. I HIGHLY recommend trying the wagyu if you haven't tried it before! Don't get me wrong - I love toro and I always order it where ever I go, but only a few places have wagyu so I recommend giving it a try! I can't even describe the incredible taste... It was lightly salted, a little sweet, semi- seared...just amazing, trust me and give it a try!!\n\nAt the end, we had Daiginjo Sake Kasu creme brulee for dessert paired with some dessert wine, Sauternes Chateau Laribotte, Bordeaux, France 2009, which was so delicious and a great way to finish off the night. \n\nThis restaurant can be pricey depending on what you order (if you choose to order a la carte, drinks, etc.), but the regular Omakase menu is $99 and you can always order a la carte if they don't serve you an item you want to try!

You can make a request but they don't really promise you a seat at the bar/table I think. We did the grand tasting which I would NOT recommend because we were both ready to vomit by the end of the meal and we were so uncomfortable. Its an absurd amount of food and for $70 more than the regular omakase, you could just order whatever you wanted off the a la carte menu instead and it would be cheaper and you'd get what you actually wanted. \n\nWe shared a bottle of sake which was plenty especially considering how full we were after all the food, If we got the sake pairing we never would've made it out of there alive.

If not, the grand omakase works too. \nSide note, all the chefs and everyone behind the sushi bar is relatively young, ranging from 25-35? Not to say they are not skilled, but I'd prefer an older chef for a more expensive menu.\nSide side note, our chef was very very cute, which added to our experience =)", "author": "Crystal Y."}

It took us 1.5 months to find a decent reservation and the wait was so worth it. This restaurant is amazing- definitely worth the Michelin star. Reservations are super competitive though, so don't expect to last minute plan it but keep hopes!\n\nWe had the opportunity to seat right in front of Chef Kusakabe which was amazing because he explained every little detail about each fish and we saw all the finishing touch. Lily T. & I opted in for the $150 grand omakase which included 25 items. Each piece of nigiri was a die for. Perfectly seasoned, no soy sauce required, and also added with some citrus and wasabi depending on the nigiri. I love for a fact the Chef also asks you if you're allergic to anything and if you had any favorite fish so they can do a little remix. \n\nMetered street parking was easily found before 6 pm. The nearest garage is 2 blocks away at the Embarcadero Garage ($3/hour after 5 pm).\n\nSome of our highlights were:\nFatty Tuna\nUni from the North\nGolden Eye Snapper\nJapanese Squid with Uni\n& the sushi finale: toro & A5 Wagyu beef. (OMG, melt in your mouth....) \n\nNice interior, excellent food, and above & beyond customer service. Not once did I need to flag down a waiter down for tea. Everyone had a smile on their face.  Major props! Kusakabe was my first Michelin star restaurant and I definitely felt the \"VIP\" treatment.\n\nThanks, Kusakabe! I'll be back.", "author": "Danny L."}

We were a party of four with two from Southern California and two from Hong Kong so very familiar paying a premium for high quality sushi, but everyone was left perplexed.  Before knowing the price (friend and I were trading meals), I thought it was a solid 3 to 4 star meal as there were some highlights, but also low lights, but then when I learned it was over $800 per couple (including sake pairing) then it became one of the most overpriced meals of my life.  As mentioned, some courses really shined, though they use sauces or smoking that overpower the fish rather than letting the product truly shine.  Also, the wagyu was some of the most stringy fatty rather than marbled I've ever had.  Overall, very disappointing meal and have had way better for significantly less to boot.\n\nPS - Who has ever heard of a 4 ounce wine pour?!

It's such a delight to watch everything being prepared.\n\nI went to Kusakabe with the boyfriend a few weeks ago for an anniversary dinner and it was just fantastic. It was the first time either of us had omakase and went with the Grand Omakase menu. Definitely come with an empty stomach because we were just STUFFED by the end of it.\n\nWe were seated at the sushi bar and our chef asked us for any favorites/dislikes/allergies. We personally didn't have any dislikes, but one person seated next to us apparently didn't like uni, and the chef was mindful of that through the entire meal and substituted other fish for her.\n\nEvery piece of fish is thoughtfully prepared and oh so tender. It's awesome to hear about each piece, what fish it is, and what preparation had gone into it.\n\nThe only thing that I was a little less impressed with was the A5 Wagyu beef with a poached egg; it came out on a hot, mini-cast iron skillet, and had a sauce poured over that was supposed to sizzle and help cook the meat. Unfortunately, we were the last of three couples who were being served at the same time and our skillets had cooled down where it barely sizzled and all the ingredients were a little more under cooked than I think it was intended to be. It was still pretty tasty and honestly a fairly minor thing.\n\nIf you're looking to step up your sushi game, I highly recommend it.

For a \"kaiseki\" styled sushi I was expecting much more creativity with the plating, flavor creativities, and texture creativities. Other than the Hassun (6 mini platere) I wouldn't call the rest \"kaiseki\". If kaiseki is the value customers are paying then Kusakabe needs more creativity on the flavors and efforts on the presentation. Sequencing is also important. Avoid soup / noodles in the middle of the menu; it is really filling after all the rice from sushi, difficult to enjoy the rest of the dishes if you get too full... The taste was good overall, thus the 4 stars. However, hamo/eel had a small bone that pierced through my gum when I bit into it. Restaurant waived my dessert as an apology.\n\nThere was a big turn off for me very early on... as soon as I got seated, there was a small fly flying around. Landed on my water cup, on the table, even the cutting board! (the chef turned around to work on other plates - it had since flown off, so he didn't see it landed there, so the next thing I know was pieces of sushi being placed on the same board where fly landed). \n\nMy chef was very friendly, 5 stars for him. I gave the staff overall 3 stars because I kept on having to dodge the server for water refills. Ideally, he could've waited until the water was at least half way down, or find a gap and ask if we'd like the water refilled. I almost hit his arm once or twice because I wasn't expecting an arm to come in between to refill the water when it was at a 60-70% level. Nice/friendly server, though lesser refills would be great. \n\nPrior to this, we had been to Wakuriya and sushi Kashiba, had really high expectations coming into Kusakabe, maybe bit too high on my end. My fiancee enjoyed it at Kusakabe quite a bit, mine was so so. For fine dining, experience matters. How much attention to detail matters, reaction of customer (case of frequent water refill) and environment (fly) really matter. Food can be good, chef and server can be friendly, it only takes a bit to ruin the 5 star experience. Perhaps my review may be on the harsher end, I definitely had very high expectations after all the good reviews. Customers want to make sure the cost is equals to the value expected. I hope Kusakabe continues to improve. Who knows, maybe I might just come in on a wrong day? Maybe I should give it one more try?\n\nThank you chefs, staff.", "author": "Sonya M."}

Came with a group of seven on a Saturday night with a reservation made a few months in advance. We arrived for the 5pm seating and received a very friendly welcome from the staff as we entered through the door.\n \nWe ordered the $98 regular omakase, which was a fantastic, well-decorated, seven course meal. Every item was unique and delicious - prepared extremely carefully by the wonderful chefs. Some of the highlights of the meal: amberjack sashimi (very meaty), raw oyster and caviar (extremely fresh), akadashi soup with duck and soy cream foam (savory, rich broth and duck flavor), and the toro (phenomenally fatty and fresh). The servers were friendly and very detailed in describing each of the items in the courses.\n \nAfter the omakase, they present an a-la-carte menu so that you can order additional pieces of nigiri. Hearing very positive reviews about their A5 Miyazaki Wagyu nigiri and after tasting fantastic Kobe beef in Japan, definitely knew I had to try a piece. My expectations were high and the Wagyu nigiri blew past them with ease. The beef was super marbley and tender, and the umami and fatty juices just burst in my mouth with every bite. This is definitely my recommended must-try, extremely worth the $14 for the piece.\n \nAfterwards, we ordered a couple desserts to share. We started with the yuzu and shiso leaf sorbet, which was very refreshing and tangy. Next we had their kome koji (ingredient used to make sake) ice cream, which was very unique, although unsweetened. Finally, we tried their daiginjo sake kasu creme brulee - also great, very rich and sweet creme brulee with a bit of sake kick. Very great to share with a group.\n \nThe bill came out to be about $115 per person pre-tax/tips. For the high quality of the food, and the very attentive and friendly staff, definitely felt the price was worth the unforgettable 3-hour experience I had at Kusakabe.

They were able to seat us promptly even though we were early.\nWe sat at the table right next to the door partition. It was a smallish place, so it was a bit tight for the servers to get past me. I felt bad since I didn't realize this until we left. They were all nice enough not to say anything! \n\nThey had two choices: the regular omakase (8 courses) or the grand omakase (11 courses). We opted for the regular $98 omakase menu. After we ordered, they gave us the dashi broth, along with warm towels and other eating utensils. We had more than one server bring us our food, and each one explained what they had placed on the table. I got too excited when they brought the sushi out so I didn't get to take pictures of the first sushi course. It was a piece of cured bluefin chutoro sushi that had a wonderful smoky flavor, paired with a piece of fresh fish served as is (not cured, marinated, etc.). You have one piece that was heavily flavored with soy sauce contrasting with another that was light and fresh, no frills. It was a very thoughtful pairing that not only didn't overwhelm my palate, but brought out the flavor of each piece of sushi. This theme continued throughout the meal with the sushi plates. \n\nEventually, after a few rounds of sushi and sashimi, they brought out the Hassun, which consisted of 6 tiny dishes, and was the most beautifully plated out of all the courses. I loved that you got a tiny bite of everything, rather than one entree. I won't go over everything, but wasn't blown away by the taste of the overall dish. I'm sure people who love clams would like the cold clam soup. I felt like it really brought out the flavor of the clams. I didn't particularly like it, but that's because I'm not a huge fan of clams. There was a lightly fried shrimp and taro, like shrimp and taro karage. Tasted like what you would expect. It also came with something that tasted like wagyu croquette, covered in crispy rice. It was quite small, so it was difficult to taste the wagyu. \n\nWe ended the meal with more fresh and melt-in-your-mouth sushi: a fun and delicious DIY hand roll served with scallop sushi topped with uni. They brought out an add-ons menu if we wanted to order anything a la carte. We were pretty satisfied, so we didn't add get anything else. After that, they came out with what I think was a yuzu sorbet, with a candle, on the house! I had forgot that they called ahead about a week before to ask if we were coming for any special reason. I had mentioned to them on the phone that it was my boyfriend's birthday. It was a nice surprise. The sorbet itself had a nice citrusy flavor, and came in a really cute little tea cup. \n\nIn general, I really liked the quality of the sushi and sashimi, along with the their flavors and the little additions and sauces served with them. This was the main reason fo coming here. There warm dishes and soups weren't bad, but they definitely weren't the stars of the show.

The level of detail and care put into all Japanese dishes has always astounded me. I am a huge fan of donburis, udon noodles, and of course, sushi. However, a couple of months ago, I had a totally new, mind-blowing, and quite frankly, life-changing culinary experience with Japanese cuisine. For my birthday, my friend took me out for omakase style sushi in San Francisco. The term \"omakase\" is a Japanese phrase that means \"I'll leave it up to you(the chef).\" The whole sushi meal is decided by the chef, and is tailored towards which fishes are in season at the time, and whatever flavors the chef wants to present that night, so it is a meal you should go into with zero expectations. \n\nWe went to KUSAKABE, a 1-Michelin starred omakase restaurant placed in the heart of San Francisco, California's financial district. This meal consisted of 15-20 different types of nigiri, or slices of raw fish/meat over rice. We were seated at a simple, wooden bar, and were assigned 1 chef for the entire night to take us through the omakase experience. Every piece was placed in front of us, one at a time, after we had finished each previous piece. Everything was extremely simple and clean, but it was some of the most fresh and most melt-in-my-mouth sushi experiences I had ever had. I practically melted along with each piece of sushi in my mouth. \n\nPriced at $165 per person for the \"Grand Omakase\" dinner, you better bet you're going to get a mind-blowing food experience. I can go on and on for hours about each piece of sushi I had that night, but I will just point out some of my highlights:\n\n- One of the most memorable and unique pieces was the Tsukiji fish market squid nigiri with crystallized egg yolk and a single yuzu leaf. It was almost \"rubbery\" in texture but extremely smooth and silky, the egg provided a creamy accent, and the yuzu was a pop of fresh lemon taste. This single bite was the most unique, and most harmonious pieces of food I have ever eaten. \n\n- The next piece that truly stood out to me was the A5 wagyu beef nigiri. It was a raw piece of A5 wagyu beef placed on top of rice, and torched so it was seared on top, yet perfectly rare in the middle. A5 is the highest possible grade of beef, and it was marvelous and extremely \"meaty\" tasting. I had never had beef that was so fatty, pure, and clean tasting before, and I'm not sure how many more times in my life I'll be able to have beef that good. My jaw physically dropped after this one. \n\nKUSAKABE provided a life-changing Japanese food experience and I hope that everyone has the opportunity to try omakase sushi at least once in their lives, especially if they love sushi and Japanese culture. Even if you don't love or know much about Japanese culture, though, this would be a great introduction. If anyone ever wants to learn more about omakase too, and the history of it, I would highly recommend watching the documentary \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi,\" which is about a famous sushi chef in Japan whose restaurant takes reservations 1 year in advanced because it is so well-known for its omakase. I hope to try different omakase restaurants in my life when I am older and have more money to do so. But for now, I will just fondly remember and dream of this KUSAKABE experience", "author": "Alana L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-22", "description": "In an ideal world, I would like to have a well-orchestrated sushi omakase dinner on the regular for the following reasons.\n- Raw fish is delicious.\n- When a chef knows what s/he is doing, I'm more than happy to have the chef execute their well-thought out prix fixe menu.\n- I don't have to order. Ordering is not my forte, as I am indecisive by nature. \n\nNeedless to say, Kusakabe does an excellent kaiseki.\nReservations here are highly recommended, and require a credit card to reserve. They are only open Mon- Sat, with 2 dinner seatings a night (5pm & 8pm) and a capacity of 29 guests. \nThe cancellation policy is very strict. \n- Cancellations w/in 48 hrs result in a charge of $30 per person.\n- Cancellations on the same day or no shows result in a charge of $95 per person.\nI have to admit I was glad that they do not accommodate children under age 5. Apparently the venue is not large enough for strollers and high chairs, but we all know that a crying infant or hyperactive toddler could ruin any dining experience. \n\nMr. Joy and I were a few minutes late for our reservation, but they were very nice about it. They hold reservations for latecomers for 15 minutes. Our empty seats and place settings were waiting for us when we arrived. The dining area consists of a very long sushi bar and a couple of tables by the door. Our sushi chef explained that the restaurant design deliberately omitted the glass fish case so the patrons can easily see the chefs prepare food. The tables are also deliberately the same height, so even people who do not sit at the sushi bar can get a good view of the sushi chefs. So thoughtful.\n\nOur server asked us the usual 'Do you have any food allergies?' We replied 'No.' She also asked if we eat raw foods, and we confirmed we do. I'm sure that is part of their protocol to double-check everything, but it would be a pity if someone who does not like raw food made a reservation here and wasted a seat.\n\nYou can choose between the Omakase ($95) or the Grand Omakase ($195). They are very similar, but the Grand Omakase is more robust in volume. Both end with toro & A5 wagyu.  Everything was presented beautifully and seasoned excellently. There is no soy sauce or wasabi, so that's one less thing to think about. Most people eat the sushi with their hands, as is the traditional way, but they do provide chopsticks too.\n\nOf course I enjoyed the buttery toro (fatty tuna). The wagyu had beautiful marbling. The zuke chutoro (medium fatty tuna) was also excellent with a light sear on top. All the accompanying flavoring agents were excellent. I especially enjoyed the yuzu onion sauce. The only thing I wasn't so fond of was the squid and mountain yam. Once your omakase has concluded, they offer you the a la carte menu of sashimi. Each order comes with one piece. \n\nOur chef was truly friendly, entertaining, and hilarious as he shared stories about being a sushi chef. When he brought out the blowtorch to sear the wagyu, I wanted to take a picture, but he was too quick for me. The couple next to us also wanted a picture, so Chef Ken turned on the blowtorch just so we could document the moment. When the chefs weren't busy preparing bites of perfection or entertaining guests, they were collaborating with each other. I was surprised to see three chefs working together to put together the presentation for one dessert. \nThe food was very delicious with a very solid fish selection. What put it over the top for me was the amazing hospitality that made it a great experience.", "author": "Joy W."}

While some of the food was good, others were terrible, and none were particularity memorable. I'd like to give this place more stars for their service, but the length of time it took to bring out some of the courses was just unacceptable.\n\nWhile the nigiri portion was good, nothing was O-M-G-I-NEED-MORE status. I also disliked how some of the sushi was drenched in ponzu. When it comes to omakase, pre-saucing is great, but I like the fish to speak for itself. My friend on the other hand, had the best experience of her life. RICE A+.\n\nThe fish from the sashimi portion of the omakase was good, but the fish was WAY too cold due to being served on a bed of shaved ice. It was really hard to enjoy the fish, though I could taste the freshness of it.\n\n....................my least favorite part of the meal with the box of assorted small plates. I'm sad to say the oyster was EXTREMELY fishy and dry, and the squid was so ridiculously fishy I had to spit it out :( Everything else in this box was just whatever to say the least. They really need to think about omitting this filler of a course in their omakase menu. NO bueno.\n\nService upon arrival to the end of the meal was spectacular. BUTTTTTTTTT the length of time between each course was just outrageous. One gap took 22 minutes... 22 FREAKING MINUTES!!! The entire meal was inconsistent. I was not a happy camper :( I'd like to note that they gave us creme brulee on the house for my friends b-day, and the entire restaurant sang happy birthday to her :)\n\nI really wanted to like this place, but I was unimpressed and underwhelmed. Needs a lot of work and tweaking of the menu IMO. If this is your first omakase experience, I think you'd love it. Don't get me wrong, the food was good and I appreciate the effort and art that goes into each course, but was still disappointed with a lot of minor things that just added up as the night went on.", "author": "Anna M."}

This is the closest experience to omakase (based off of food taste and quality and critical methodology to serving perfect dishes) I experienced in Japan, albeit bougier. The service as soon as you enter the door is impeccable. Our chef was Brandon and we were next to the couple being served by Chef Nori so we were able to hear some of his information as he served them. If you go, get the Omakase, unless you have a very small appetite I don't think the petite Omakase is enough! Also don't miss out on the wagyu tongue- hot damn. Every piece was worth it and savory. Our last piece of fatty tuna was decadent. A couple fun facts: they get fish deliveries daily, their rice is brown because they use red vinegar in their sushi rice (traditional method), and they make a point to know if you're celebrating something. I really felt that they hosted my husband and me very well. I also loved that their bathroom has a toto Japanese toilet seat. Don't get scared that the seat is warm lol. I do recommend the sorbet and tofu \"tiramisu\"- the sorbet is palette cleansing and the tofu tiramisu is just tasty without being overly sweet. I'm coming back soon!", "author": "Krizelda M."}

It is a lot bigger than most places I have been too. Fully packed on the weekends and weekdays. I was told that their menu just changed!  Twice a year the menu changes so it's great to try something so fresh and recently created. \n\nRight away you notice how they have 3 times the more chefs at the bar than the normal 2/3. If I were you, request for the bar when you make reservations. I though this might be a drawback, but it wasn't!!  One thing I really like about Kusakabe is that they even make all the hot dishes/non-sushi dishes in the front!  It always make the experience better. Talk to the chefs. The head chef does stand at the front and the rest of the chefs follow. It's not ranked -- I asked. \n\nTypical pricing $95 for the normal omakase and $150 for the upgraded version.  \n\nSame review: \nKansan Sui - $40 dry and sweet. I asked for a little sweet, but it did come out a little sweeter than I like. Great first sake. Goes down smoothly like you are drinking water. \n\nTedorigawa Kinka -$33. Dry and little sweet. I honestly like this better than Kansan.  Make your money's worth and try this out.\n\nKen - $53. Served in a wine glass so you can swish and see the colors. Taste more like sake. More dry less sweet. I would definitely rate this behind the tedorigawa. \n\n\nOmakase review: \nI honestly had high expectations from this place bc I have heard 'okay' reviews, but the ratings on Yelp were really high. I ended up trying the grand omakase which supposedly has higher grade fish/seafood. The sushi plates at the beginning were awesome!!! I would say that the sashimi dish was okay but definitely have to rave about the ankimo. Great quality...melt in mouth type of experience. The sashimi section came with 5 different sauces that are to compliment the sashimi pieces. I think that the sauces were creatively made and tasted very good. I believe the fish can stand on its own with a ponzu sauce, but this is definitely a different experience. After the sashimi dish, there was a soup that was AMAZING!!  it was mixed with vegetable pur\u00e9e and Agedashi soup base with some type of fish. Probably my favorite dish of the night. \n\nWe finished off the course with more sashimi. There wasn't a cleansing palette dish afterwards. However I ordered the Yuzu sorbet which was nice and refreshing. \n\nOverall I had to rate the place 5/5. The service is great and the food was great. Based on my friends' previous reviews, I do believe that our menu was different from there's. I can't complain. I would definitely come back again and enjoy another experience at Kusakabe.", "author": "Jackie N."}

It was $95 pp, but I heard that they now offer a $150 prix fix menu. Definitely another reason why I need to come back. :']\n\nIt's a rather small restaurant (12-15 people), and I love how the majority of the seating is at the bar. My favorite! Lighting was also amazing, and the service was indeed Michelin star worthy.\n\nSome of my favorites were the Zuke Chutoro, Ocean Trout, Striped Jack, Red Snapper, and A5 Wagyu. I especially loved the torched fish/A5 - the perfect amount of smokiness flavor and felt like it melted in my mouth like butter. What differentiated this restaurant from others was how the chef managed to mix the perfect amount and selection of oils/sauces to best emphasize the true taste of the fish. Some even had wasabi mixed in beforehand! Traditionally, you don't need to dip the fish in the soy sauce, and you're supposed to eat the nigiri with your hands (Erick T. actually did this). But... I ate most of my nigiri with chopsticks and dipped my fish in soy sauce anyway because I love soy sauce. I actually think the sushi chef got a bit offended when he saw me do this. Whoops, sorry! \n\nThe one thing I actually really wished was not on the menu was the box of assorted small plates (oyster, squid, etc.) I have a very picky palette, and they were all honestly just too fishy for me. I ended up giving most of them to my boyfriend. Maybe it won't be on the menu when I come back?\n\nOrdered sake pairings for the both of us ($75 pp), which I highly recommend! I thought their selection of sakes in comparison to that of other omakase restaurants was far more tasty and unique. But if you don't drink much, I suggest only ordering one tasting. Surprisingly, they pour you BIG shots/glasses, and I died halfway through my meal. Don't want to be stumbling out the door like I did. Our waitress was also able to answer all my questions about the choices of sake for each dish and was very informative. Thank you!\n\nOverall, Erick T. and I were blown away by how delicious everything was for the price and how shockingly full we were! But who knows, maybe it was the sake that filled us up.", "author": "Christina L."}

The grand omakase consisted of 25 pieces, displayed on 7 \"dishes\". The entire dining experience was amazing from the start to finish. We first started off with the Ichiban Dashi, a small soup. Next was the sushi prelude, then a sashimi plate, hassun (beautifully plated), soup with a cube of tofu with umami tamago - so goood, sushi chic and lastly the sushi finale which consisted of fresh white eel and your choice of either toro bluefin fatty tuna or A5 grade wagyu beef. \n\nAfter the omakase, there's an a la carte menu. My bf and I ordered 2 additional pieces each. One from the omakase earlier and a spoonful of uni. \n\nAlthough we were pretty satisfied, we wanted to end the meal with dessert!

We did the \"grand\" omakase for $150 but we got 22 items! 22! (Disclaimer: this may not always be the case.)\n\nIn my opinion, I felt that the sushi was the star here. They have non-sushi items as part of the kaiseiki but there are places like Wakuriya that really excel at that. To me, these items at Kusakabe were a little mild for me, with the exception of the beef croquette.\n\nMy favorites: zuke chutoro, toro, barracuda, Copper River sockeye salmon, BBQ white eel, beef croquette, and Canadian ebi (we added this). You can't add any items from the a la carte menu until after you've finished the omakase so if you don't want to gamble, do the $95 omakase and get more of your favorites later.\n\nWhat I love most is the relaxed ambiance. I highly recommend you sit at the bar so you get your one piece of sushi at a time. It really helps you appreciate the beauty while it's on its little pedestal. And of course you get to converse with the chef making your food. That's always nice.\n\nI giggled when I saw at the bottom of the menu that they make rolls upon request.

A few people recommended that a sushi fanatic like me should try Kusakabe, since I'm always missing the Japanese cuisine that was served in Hawaii (which I still think is the best place to get authentic Japanese cuisine here in the US). Anyway, I gave this place a whirl back in October of last year and have highly contemplated going back--and will. This review is long overdue but I've decided to write my dining experience here since I stepped foot in the intimate restaurant last Fall. \n\nUpon arrival, you are greeted by their hospitable staff, there's only 2 rounds per night--so do sign up early. Since I was eating with my family, we chose a weeknight, and only had to book 2 weeks in advance. We were given some type of kelp-y/seaweed-infused tea, which we were told was a palette cleanser. I thought it was delicious, I love snacking on seaweed (yes, it's a thing Asian people do). \n\nAnyway, once most of the people arrive +/- a few late birds, the chefs start prepping. We didn't get seated in front of the master, but we did get the second most experienced chef in the restaurant, which was great. He was very informative and friendly and taught me a few things about how and why this restaurant is slightly different from \"traditional\" omakase places. And the way the menu is set up is that every few dishes after amazing nigiri, will be a warm dish. And this is because it balances the digestive system so as to not overwhelm it with just nigiri/raw/food that is served in a cooler temp range. I thought that was really neat and interesting. \n\nI couldn't remember the names of all the different fish that were served unless I jot them down on my phone, but seriously--what kind of a dining experience would that be? I decided that posting the date I went to the restaurants would be somewhat helpful because the fish served on the day could be seasonal. So that's for any seafood/sushi connoisseurs out there. But check out that glisten and shininess of those nigiri pieces! It's AMAZING, and a sign for amazingly fresh fish. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the experience and the chestnut ice cream I ordered at the end had small chunks of real chestnut in it (yay!) I love how that fitted into the seasonal theme of the menu. \n\nOh, and my motivation for finally writing this review?

The additional courses that you get for the latter is definitely worth the extra $50 ! Go big or go home ! \n\nThe dinner experience went by so fast like a blur (probably because everything was delicious and it felt like floating on clouds in heaven). My favorite is hands down the toro - you can never go wrong with toro- but every single nigiri and sashimi serving was incredibly fresh. The kussi oysters and the croquette are my second favorites and lastly, if you didn't order the $150 omakase, I would definitely order the uni off of the regular menu. The uni was so light and wasn't overwhelming at all (like most restaurants). The almond ice cream was also a great finishing touch so definitely order dessert because there should always be room for dessert. \n\n::Service\nThe servicing was incredibly. Everyone was very attentive and knowledgeable. Sadly, we didn't get a chance to sit at the bar, though the experience was just as nice to have our own table.

I made the reservation a month in advance and I am not sure if that is why but we were served by Chef Kusakabe that evening.\n\nI took my husband to Sushi Yoshizumi for his 28th and that was amazing too but...we liked Kusakabe better.\n\nWe went for the general ($98) Omakase because I had wanted the option of ordering a-la-carte after the omakase.  Ultimately, our bill was $350 including tip for the two of us (yikes) but we ordered several a-la-carte items and it was well worth it.  \n\nLooking back, there were some courses in the omakase that I thought were great but not phenomenal as the a-la-carte items turned out to be.  For example, if I were to come again...I could do without the sashimi and the plate with 5 different stuff inside.  They were great, but were not in the same caliber as some of the a-la-carte items we ordered after the omakase, in my humble opinion.\n\nOne thing I did not appreciate was the overuse of phones and talking of the guests.  That was a bit annoying.\n\nThe dishes that really stood out to us were the following:\n\n-uni with scallop on top\nThis is an amazing combination.\n\n-ika (a-la-carte)\nChef mentioned that the squid was aged for 10 days.  This was something I had never had in my life.  Well worth the $10.50/nigiri in my opinion.\n\n-kyoto style(?) eel (a-la-carte)\nThis was phenomenal.  I can't describe it.  Best.\n\nI wish I could order a-la-carte alone.  Maybe if we spend tens of thousands of dollars and become a regular, we can?  One can hope, right?", "author": "Gina C."}

I tried shirako for the first time, which I later found out was fish ballsack, but more on that later. \n\nSo for all the wine-ing and dining Shawn C. has been doing, I couldn't have thought of a better way to return the favor than with a reservation here for his birthday. I somehow managed to secure a Friday reservation just two weeks before via OpenTable. Based on other reviews, reservations here seem to come with a hefty wait, but luckily we didn't have to experience that. \n\nThe omakase is $95pp, with the option to order a-la-carte items at the end. It was worth every single penny. Everything was pretty amazing, mind blowing, orgasmic, you get the idea. \n\nI won't go through everything, but here's the special mentions:\n\n- Every piece of nigiri was to die for. Perfectly seasoned, no soy sauce required, and skillfully made one-by-one in front of you (if you're sitting at the bar of course). Jing was our chef for the night, he's pretty awesome. Shout-out to Jing!\n\n- Our soup, the Yaki-Goma Dofu & Kyoto style Saikyo Miso with snow crab, was unlike anything I've ever tasted before. Sweet and savory at the same time, the dofu was textured like mochi with a hint of sesame. SERIOUSLY SO GOOD.\n\n- SHIRAKO AKA FISH BALLSACK, or milt, \"the male genitalia of fish when they contain sperm, used as food.\" Thanks, Wikipedia. The dish was actually called Yuan-marinated Hokkaido cod with its own Shirako & Satsuma Imo. Yes, I ate fish sperm, and yes, it was 9287473 times better than what I thought it was going to be. Perfectly fried on the outside, yet so creamy and oozy on the inside.. Okay, I'll stop now. \n\n- Sushi finale.. dat toro. Oh my god, it dissolved in my mouth. \n\nWe received a complimentary yuzu sorbet for Shawn's birthday, and all the employees sang happy birthday to him! He turned bright red - mission accomplished! \n\nThank you, KUSAKABE!

We learned a lot about where they source their fish and the insanely quick shipping they have from Japan to SF. \n\nOverall, the service was on point and the food quality was just amazing - The Kaisui Uni was literally THE best uni I've EVER eaten in my life. The finale of toro and A5 wagyu was so delicious too - seriously, melt in your mouth good! We also ordered the shrimp a la carte which was huge and you get to eat it in two ways, the body quickly poached over rice and the head deep-fried! I also really enjoyed the BBQ eel with sansho pepper, super fatty eel and no bones in it at all.\n\nThis experience was more than I could've asked for and I 100% will be back!!

The omakase is only $95 per person, which is super affordable compared to a lot of other options in the city, and the quality is still exceptional. It's definitely not the most extensive omakase menu, but I left feeling pleasantly satisfied, rather than too full to move. And, if you want more of a particular fish, or just want something that wasn't included in the omakase courses, you can also order additional things a la carte.\n\nThe omakase has a good mix of warm dishes, quality fish, and other courses. The non-nigiri items were really unique. Two that I remember were a soup with a small meatball / dumpling and a fish marrow gelatin type thing (part of a mini 4-course plating). For the finale, I would definitely recommend getting both the wagyu and the toro options!! You do have to pay extra in order to have both, but definitely worth it. Sooo delicious.\n\nFor dessert, I got the pumpkin pudding with caramelized sugar on top. Kind of a twist on a traditional creme brulee, with a slightly different texture.

The freshness of the fish is unreal, but again, weird, as some fish had little to no taste. Then there where whoppers like A5 and uni that were total flavor bombs. If I had to sum this place up as a band it would be Fugazi. Slow parts that make you almost tired and question why you are there and then all of the sudden you get smacked with this wicked over the top noise and feedback.

I went to Kusakabe a few months ago (back in Octoberish of last year), and decided to finally get around to writing a review.\n\nI heard GREAT things about Kusakabe, especially after learning that the chef was originally from Sushi Ran (probably my favorite sushi joint currently). I went in with high expectations, especially because Kusakabe had 1 star at the time. I've been to Maruya before, and I'd have to say, I think I'd rather go back to Maruya next time (or try a new omakase spot) instead of returning to Kusakabe. This might be a personal preference, but I prefer my nigiri completely raw... where a lot of the nigiri at Kusakabe was partially seared or torched. I ordered the grand omakase menu, and although it was yummy, it didn't quite hit the spot for me. \n\nIf you're looking for simple, fresh, raw nigiri - this place isn't it. It's definitely more for the type of people who might not be used to completely raw fish, and still prefer a bit of searing or torching. They also have a lot of small appetizer type of dishes (delicious) in between. I guess I'm a bit picky with sushi, but I definitely did feel pretty underwhelmed. I was full by the end, but I expected something else when it came to the nigiri.\n\nKusakabe is a great place for people who might just be getting into the sushi/omakase craze, who might not entirely love raw fish.

She's never been a lover of raw fish (or so she thought), as sushi in China usually isn't the best. I think the other reviews cover everything, but I wanted to share a story of the service I experienced there - spoiler alert, it was impeccable.\n\nDuring the part of the Omakase where they bring out a plate with oysters and tempura, they serve an onion sauce. My gf, who was enjoying the experience immensely, excitedly took photos and was enjoying the presentation of the food, when she noticed this eyelash in her onion sauce. Honestly, if she wasn't the detail oriented person that she is, I don't think we would have ever seen it.\n\nHowever, she mentioned it to the maitre d' and he immediately took it away and replaced it with a new sauce. Everyone who worked at the restaurant apologized to us (including Kusukabe, *swoon*), and suddenly we were being treated to another carafe of some ridiculously expensive sake ($200 a bottle !!). It was just an eyelash! I was impressed with the service and then hospitality we experienced, possibly because of the extra alcohol we were served.\n\nSide note, I think that this course of the omakase kind of broke up the flow of the meal in a bad way - you are eating sushi and it is awesome, then you suddenly wait for a period of time for the next course to come out, and it's this collage of different dishes together on a plate that you spend some time working through, and then you resume your sushi experience. I'm not sure how to improve it, but I felt like it threw me off my rhythm a little.\n\nAlso - for those of you getting the sake tasting, it's a ton of sake.

This was my first Michelin star dining experience and I am so glad it was as it was absolutely amazing. \n\nWe started off with the Omakase courses which were 7 courses for $95pp. I wasn't a huge fan of the seaweed drink they give you to cleanse your palette. My favorites of the courses were the chu toro and copper salmon nigiri, although pretty much all the nigiri they served as part of the omakase were delicious. Each piece was specially seasoned and super fresh. I loved the turtle soup dish (can't believe I ate a cute little turtle), but  shockingly, it was amazing. The dish with two crispy fish in a truffle sauce and shishito pepper was another favorite of mine. Pretty much licked the dish clean because the truffle sauce was so tasty. I also really enjoyed the 5 piece le petit sampler plate of the chefs specials. Huge fan of the crispy eggplant and the tuna over rice piece. \n\nFor the last piece,we chose the a5 wagyu sushi. I gotta say that I was not completely blown away with this piece. I actually think that Sushi Sams in San Mateo has a better A5. I mean it was definitely good, but not as amazing as I was hoping for. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of sushi al a carte. My favorites being the kaisui uni (completely melt in your mouth!!) wish it was a bigger piece though, Santa Barbara uni, bbq unagi (soft and very good), toro (amazing), chu toro (they season this extremely well, lots of flavors). Each bite was complete heaven for me. \n\nThis was my boyfriends first time trying Omakase and he normally doesn't like to eat raw fish other than salmon and hamachi, however, he loved every single bite of their omakase and is now addicted! Uh oh..\n\nTheir sake is also very good. I had a glass of reisling, but next time I'd probably refrain from getting this just so I could order more sushi! \n\nService was wonderful. The only suggestion that I have is to be more careful and remember if people have specific food restrictions. I asked for no wasabi in all the dishes, however, we had to remind our waitress at least 3 times and there was still some wasabi in my sushi :( which took away from some of the taste for me. They made it up by giving us free dessert for our anniversary. Desserts were delicious, I would highly recommend the pancetta and I'd probably skip out on the corn ice cream next time. \n\nMake sure you make reservations months in advance if you want to sit at the bar and you can probably get in a months in advance if just for a table. Place is tiny and they have 2 groups for seating, one at 5pm and another at 8pm.\n\nWould I come back? Absolutely! This place is definitely not cheap, but it's worth it to splurge for a special occasion or if you want to take yourself out for some high quality japanese food/sushi. The omakase itself is actually a good amount. It won't get you buffet full, but it's definitely enough and if you order a few pieces al a carte, you should be good to go!", "author": "Susan M."}

I was given a surprise birthday dinner here by my fiance, and was treated to a rather amazing omakase experience.  I failed to take notes (it's my birthday so I get the day off, right?) but the short version is that they serve you tons of amazing small dishes including several unique nigiri.  The thing that makes them so amazing here is that they choose rather exotic fish / seasoning / sauce combos that are both (1) unlikely to be found at other restaurants (2) f!cking delicious.  (The closest thing I know to this exotic-nigiri-centric experience is probably Sugoi sushi in the mission, though their special nigiri combos were a bit more hit and miss.)\n\nAnyway, there were probably zero misses on our menu, and of course two of the hits were fatty tuna.

Im probably one of the biggest sushi lovers that you'll ever meet so I was really excited to try this restaurant. Unfortunately it didn't satisfy what I was hoping for. \n\nMy friend and I came for our end of the semester celebration. We both ordered the 95 dollar Omakase. The raw fish here is honestly really fresh and it just melts in your mouth. The halibut from the Sushi Prelude was killed 3 hours before it was served to us. However the Dashi broth was too salty for my liking. Also some items from the Hassun were not for my taste such as the lobster salad with the jelly like thing on top and the persimmon salad with the lotus root chip on top. Despite the few items that did not meet my expectations, the rest of my meal was delicious. I especially loved the final course where they served us baby sweet white shrimp and toro. \n\nThe service here was wonderful. They brought out our food really quick and was on top of refilling our drinks. Every time they brought out our food, they would give us a very detailed explanation of what it was which is something that many restaurants lack. There were 7 sushi chefs making our meals and 3-4 servers. \n\nOverall, the experience was great but I don't know if I would come back again. The service and 80 percent of the meal was wonderful but if I am going to pay over 100 dollars for sushi, I expect everything to be delicious. \n\nFood: 4/5 stars because of the items I disliked \nService: 5/5 stars \nEnvironment: 5/5 stars", "author": "Joyce C."}

I've never had omakase in my life because I live in Houston.  Houston isn't exactly known for the best, freshest sushi.  Thus, when I decided to make a trip to San Francisco, I decided that I'll lose my omakase virginity there.  After much research on Yelp, Kusakabe was the one.  \n\nI made a reservation about a month in advance for a seat at the bar.  Note that you'll have to provide them your credit card information in order for them to reserve a spot for you, and you have up to 48 hours before your reservation to cancel.  Otherwise, they'll charge you.  \n\nThey serve dinner in two time slots: 5pm and 8pm.  The host informed me that the 5pm slot is a bit more rushed while the 8pm slot is a bit more relaxed.  Luckily, I had picked the 8pm time slot so there was no way they would ever need to rush me out of there.  \n\nI arrived about 20 minutes early since I wasn't sure where the exact location was and didn't mind having to wait, but the host kept apologizing which was very nice of him.  After about 10 min, he was able to seat me and introduced me to my sushi chefs.  It was amazing to see them prepare all the dishes in front of me.  It was a show of its own - no date required to enjoy your dinner.  In the beginning, they ask for your favorite fish as well as any dietary restrictions.  Then, the dishes start coming.  Don't worry, they don't start preparing the next dish until you are done.  They also explain the dish so you know what you're eating.  Once you are done with the omakase, they will also hand you a dessert menu and a a la carte menu in case you want to order more.  The dessert menu wasn't as enticing to me as the sushi menu so I ordered another piece of sushi.  \n\nAll in all, the entire meal came out to a little over $100 which was completely worth it.  The meal took about 2 hours, which flew by quickly since I was enjoying my conversations with the chefs.  The environment was fun, entertaining but also relaxing.  I definitely enjoyed it and am glad that I came here for my first omakase experience.  I'll definitely come back if I'm in San Fran again!", "author": "Miranda L."}

We reserved for the 8pm and hoped for the bar. I truly recommend to read their disclosure prior just to fully take in the experience and understand what they prefer you to do. I.E., eat the sushi with your fingers, no soy sauce, light perfume, etc. \n\nAs many people have seen the Jiro Netflix documentary, I was so excited about finally trying omakase legitly. We were hoping to be seated right in front of Chef Nori as he is the owner and is a daily chef as well.\n\nWe got there at 8pm and were greeted right away by the host and the chefs. We were seated at the bar and were brought warm/moist cloth and every single thing brought to us was described intricately with a reason behind it. The chef in front of us managed us and two other parties. Our chef was Patrick and he asked if we ever had omakase before, if we had any allergies, any favorites, etc. We were pretty much open to everything. We did the grand omakase and they have a sake pairing, but I advise to maybe not do the sake pairing so you don't get toooo drunk. Patrick gave us a specific description for each piece and he was super nice to answer our annoying questions of how he started out and ended up at Kusakabe. I really appreciate how super clean all the chefs presentation were as well as their preparation because you literally watch them create the pieces in front of you. We were mainly being groupies watching Chef Nori's every move as he was further down the bar serving someone else. Nonetheless, Patrick was super nice and fun to talk to, making the experience really nice. \n\nFollow the directions, eat with your hands! For your birthday you have a choice of a complimentary dessert and Patrick recommended the sherbet, especially if you are really full after the dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-04", "description": "The growing trend of Japanese restaurants opening in or near downtown is clearly at a fever pitch.  Last year, a friend presented me with a gift card (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MdG5viokZhOm2Qpn12kRBQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q). Due to scheduling logistics, it's been difficult to find a person and the time to enjoy this experience with me.  On a recent Friday, I was able to make a 5 pm reservation for two at the table near the host stand, basically at the center of the restaurant.  There are only five tables available which explains the difficulty in securing reservations without early notice.  The remainder of the seating is on the L-shaped sushi bar which seats around twelve or fifteen.  After my guest arrived, here's what we enjoyed:\n\nAmuse\nKonbu cha - Translates to kelp tea, this is more like a soup to me.  Sorry, I drank this without taking a picture as I thought it was \"just tea\".  Perfect elixir for foggy SF evenings.\n\nFirst\nNigiri toro, halibut, bonito (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DmkADPQrPhbu7Ri_PhcvaQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - The first and the third were my favorites... how can you go wrong with those two?!\n\nSecond\nSashimi scallop and maguro (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rkKjr_pOWEbDC8rDxyMNDA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pristine, fresh, and tender.  They were a nice contrast with one being soft (scallop) and the other firm (maguro).\n\nThird\nUmami tomato soup (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KJTATBDka63tOnd0NxlrGw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My eyes widened as I searched for the tomato element.  There is a large meatball at the center of this which reminds me of the chicken meatball at Delica in the Ferry Building.\n\nFourth\nHassun, oysters served with French caviar and four petit plates (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qyg_iiz7Brq9vioVpmRjcQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Like the second, fourth, and fifth plates (from the left) the most.  The first one was a bit fishy for me.\n\nFifth\nYuba wrap (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zblfKmWoBNJU3ka25XU1RQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Indulgence!  Probably my best description given that there was foie gras in the center and summer truffles shaved on top.\n\nSixth\nNigiri Stripe jack, salmon, flounder (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SbCSmsZ56nNn2sCv3h6Tkw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Clean flavors and nice prelude to the highlight.\n\nSeventh\nSushi finale, grade A5 Miyazaki wagyu steak (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oy2eVTsOqhr7JkiXmBY9cQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) -  All I can say, is \"look at that\"!\n\nAfter completing the tasting menu, our waitress kindly offered us their supplement menu in case we wanted to try something else or weren't full from the original meal.  \n\nI chose the Lobster omelet sushi (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=87ql3El1K0eKkdX_xYd-tw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  It's actually a flavored take on tamago (egg) sushi where the lobster flavor is infused with the egg.  Enjoyed this as it was an interested take, but just don't get caught up on trying to find the lobster.\nThere were also three desserts on the menu (one being panna cotta), but nothing was attractive to my guest so we passed.\nAs many described, this is authentic Japanese cuisine served in a fine dining atmosphere without the stuffy dress code.  As I walked to use the loo, I noticed a couple of awards to the proprietor as sushi maker of the year, not something that's commonly seen in these parts.  \nYes, I will be back, but need to make sure my dining companions are as open minded menu wise as me.", "author": "Mike C."}

When someone is doubtful that paying a lot for good sushi is worth it, bring them here. \n\nMy husband and I were visiting from Chicago were able to book a spot for a weekday evening with less than a month's notice. We did not make a selection for seating preference, and we ended up sitting up at the sushi bar, which ended up being a great experience as we got to interact with our sushi chef and see how each piece is made. \n\nFOOD:\nWe were blown away by the food from the first bite. We went with the full Omakase menu and did not regret it one bit. They have a petite omakase menu which is a little shorter and cheaper, but I would recommend going with the full menu as some of my favorites were in the full menu. They do ask for allergies beforehand, and were careful to avoid any allergens (mine was scallop). Each item is thoughtfully made and presented, and we did feel full after our meal. I loved almost everything they put in front of me, although I felt that the tofu w/carrot could have been a little more flavorful. At the end of the meal, you get an a la carte menu where you can order extras, but we were stuffed. Despite this, we still ordered dessert--not because we had room, but because we were certain that the dessert would be amazing. We got the creme brulee, which was AMAZING. Was hesitant at first because I was not sure I could handle something so heavy while being so full, but their version is definitely lighter and more refreshing, but still creamy. I would say this is my favorite version of creme brulee that I've had. We also got the sorbet, which was also fantastic. I'm not a fan of heavy desserts, so these two were absolutely on point.  P.S. I still dream about the Zuke chutoro and the wagyu. \n\nAMBIANCE: \nLovely, warm, serene. Lots of wood and clean lines. Good for both dates and outings with family or friends. \n\nSERVICE:\nGreat service. Entire staff is very polite, attentive, genuinely friendly and personable. Very approachable and easy going staff, despite their attentiveness, which I greatly appreciated (overly formal staff makes dining a bit too awkward for me). Did not have to try to flag down help or anything. Fantastic attention to detail. \n\nPRICE TO QUALITY:\nAbsolutely worth the splurge!

I booked the place for my birthday dinner and psyched myself up for what I was hoping to be an amazing meal. We walked in on a Friday night at 8pm for our 8:15pm reservation. My friends and I were greeted by the host in the front and promptly led to our seats at the bar. The sushi chef in front of us introduced himself to us and asked us about our preferences for fish. We went with the regular omakase over the grand one. The whole experience itself was fun. You got to watch the chef make all the nigiri in front of you. Fresh from their hands straight onto your plate. Our chef was super friendly and let us try to guess which fish was coming next. \n\nMy favorite item of the night was the sashimi of tuna and scallops that came beautifully arranged atop a bowl of ice. The scallops were amazingly sweet and the tuna just melted in your mouth. This item earned 5/5 stars for me and I wish I could have eaten it all night long. Other honorable mentions were the hamachi+mackerel (forgot what the name of the fish was) and the cherrywood smoked tuna. Both were very unique in flavor and the fish was super fresh and supple. \n\nWhat disappointed me the most were the hassun, the toro, and the wagyu beef. The hassun was gorgeously presented, but of all the items on the dish, not a single one stood out to me. The toro was chewy and nothing near the melt in the mouth quality I was hoping for. Same went for the wagyu beef. It was so chewy that I ended up swallowing the beef whole. For $15 extra a piece, I was quite bitter about ordering it after eating it. \n\nFor $100 for an omakase, I would most likely not be coming back here anytime soon. The quality of the fish was decent, but the items themselves were nothing to rave over. I will say that if you want to come here, ask for a reservation at the bar. It is well worth it. I honestly think the whole experience was as good as it was because we sat at the bar instead of at the tables. The food itself gets a 3/5 stars for me, but the service was a 5/5. \n\nCons: \n- Pricey (but most people come here knowing they are going to have to dish out a good chunk of money for this meal)\n- Hard to find parking (true for a lot of places around SF though)\n- A lot of courses were lackluster and left me wanting more \n\nPros: \n- Great service \n- Sushi chef was super friendly and accommodating\n- Gorgeous interior decor and nice ambiance", "author": "Diana C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-31", "description": "In the last 3 months I went to three different Japanese restaurants that served an Omakase style menu. Omakase stands for a meal consisting of dishes selected by the Chef. I highly recommend this because you get to taste a wide variety of fresh fish and flavors that you may not normally would order. You will likely try something that you have never tried before and be pleasantly surprised. \n\nOut of the three Omakases that I tried, Kusakabe, by far, was my favorite. (The other two places I went to was Kabuto in Las Vegas & Kru in Sacramento, feel free to check out my reviews for them.)\n\nKusakabe stood out above the other two primarily because of their flavors. It's been a long time that I tasted something and was wowed over and over again. Servings come in bite sizes so it's okay to eat the whole thing in one bite and wait for it.... ah... foodgasm!!!!  No exaggeration, the food was so good that we kept ordering more and more from the \"second menu\"; we couldn't get enough.\n\nThe second reason why this was better than the other two was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. From the Hostess, Grace, to all the waiter, waitresses and of course, the Chefs, my cousin and I really enjoyed ourselves. We sat at the bar and everyone was very attentive and was more than happy to explain and answer any questions that we had. The Omakase in Vegas was so rigid that you almost didn't want to ask anything or even speak. I like to learn about what I'm eating and have fun while I'm eating. The Staff at Kusakabe, definitely provided that atmosphere. \n\nThere are approximately 15 seats at the bar, a large table for 8 or so, and three small tables for parties of two. If you go, try and get a seating at the bar; you'll have the most interaction with the Chefs and you get to see how everything is prepared; it's a real treat! \n\nOur meal started with a Welcome tea made of Konbu cha or kelp tea; it tastes much better than it sounds... drink up!\n\nOur first bite was Zuke Chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce), maaaaaaaaaaaan.... ah...sorry... another foodgasm just thinking back... this had such a powerful flavor; you'll be very surprised. And the rest of the meal continued on with every bite just as good as the first.\n\nThe most surprising dish was the Suppon umami soup with Domyo-ji Manjyu (Soft shell turtle soup with sticky rice). I know, it's hard to comprehend that you are eating a sweet innocent turtle but you just have to have an open mind and try it. YOU WILL WANT MORE!\n\nIn addition to the Omakase menu, we also ordered: \n\nAyu (Japanese Sweet fish with grated Japanese cucumbers)\nJi Kinmedai (Lightly cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper)\nUmimasu (Tasmanian ocean trout lightly poached)\nKohada (Gizzard shad with crystallized egg yolk)\nKaisui Uni (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin)\n\nI would eat each and every one of those over and over again. \n\nHot tea came with the meal but we also ordered Yuki no Bosha \"Cabin in the Snow\" Junmai Ginjo sake which was light and fruity, went well with the meal. \n\nFor dessert we had the vanilla panna cotta with Ume caramel and Fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... go for the fresh corn and white miso ice cream parfait... delicious!  \n\nThe grand total for our meal was $351.26 (tips not included) but it was worth every penny and I would go back again and again... pocket book permitted, that is!", "author": "Tinah Y."}

I made reservations early to celebrate my husband's birthday here and we were not disappointed!  The service from the beginning was impeccable, definitely of michelin star quality.  Also, we were seated at the bar, right in front of Chef Nori which made the night even better because we got to see him at work and he was the one that served each piece of sushi to us one-by-one.  We got lucky to get the VIP seats of the night!\n\nWe opted for the regular omakase which is $95 per person, as compared to the grand omakase which was $150 per person.  Regardless of which one you choose, you also are given an a la carte menu at the end of the meal, should you want to supplement the meal with any extras.\n\nThe regular omakase includes 19 items which are mostly sushi/sashimi but supplemented with a few other courses like a soup and some other small traditional Japanese bites.  Each of the sushi were handcrafted with care and paired and presented with exquisite precision.  I loved the flavors that he would complement each fish with without overpowering its flavor.  The sashimi plate was presented with two sauces: an onion yuzu sesame seed oil and soy sauce.  The yuzu sauce was delicious and just melted in your mouth with the scallop and tuna that it was served with.\n\nThe entire night felt like being transported back to Japan.  Even the bathroom was complete with an automatic Japanese-style toilet with too many buttons for me to count.  The night ended with the entire staff singing \"Happy Birthday\" to my husband and bringing out a yuzu sorbet with a candle.

My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our 3 year anniversary here last week and it was a good choice. Getting reservations weeknights was easy but seemed more difficult for a weekend. \n\nWe had reservations at 8, we arrived a little early and were seated at the bar, which is definitely the way to go for any omakase. I forget which chef we had but he was pretty cool to chat with. The omakase had 7 courses which was more than enough. The starting toro was a great way to start the meal. I really loved how they really took into consideration what fish you like and gave you fresh nigiri within the fish groups you like. I can't say that I didn't like anything in the omakase cause I liked everything. Well the only exception would be the ice fish in the chefs petite plate , it tasted ok but not my favorite fish but everything else was exceptional. \n\nThe toro at the end was mouth watering and good! Definitely a great way to end the meal. When the omakase is over they hand you a a la carte menu to order anything extra. We love Uni so we ended with ordering that and extra toro, a5 waygu beef nigiri. A5 waygu was also great, it was fatty and slightly torched but it was so good! I would definitely get this again but I still love toro more! Kaisun and bafun Uni were the two Uni that we ordered and both were creamy with a good texture. It was melt in your mouth good and they did not have a weird fishy taste like some other units we have had in the past. They tasted super fresh especially since they were both imported from Japan. \n\nOverall, we really liked the omakase, but anything from the a la carte menu really racks up the tab. A\nGreat place for special occasions and for sushi purists. Definitely a place to try at least once! \n\nTotal for 2 w/ tax & tip: $314", "author": "Stella J."}

At $150 pp, it is definitely a good value for the quality and amount of food.\n\nThe atmosphere of Kusakabe is friendly and inviting. My boyfriend and I felt very comfortable sitting at the sushi bar, and enjoyed our time making conversation with our sushi chef Brian.\n\nThe quality of the fish was in a class of its own, and I am definitely going to be dreaming of it until we find another chance to return. It's hard to pick a favorite of the night, but I'd have to say aside from the obvious A5 Wagyu and toro, the white Alaskan salmon was to die for. \n\nAt the end of our meal, the whole staff and restaurant sang happy birthday to my boyfriend, and the sorbet they gave him was the perfect ending to an already perfect meal.", "author": "Mara A."}

I made a reservation for dinner.  Arrived 20 minutes late but they said it was no problem and would love the reservation to 6:30.   As we were being seated the host told us that we should \"probably order the smaller\" prix fixe menu because they were very busy and wouldn't have time for the 11 course menu.  We said we wanted the 11 course.  We were then told that several of the courses would be served all at the same time.   Then at the end of the meal we were told there was only enough time to either order more a la carte or dessert.  We were told if we didn't order more sushi we would be comped dessert.   Instead we got our bill for $168 per person.    While the food was good (unfortunately a couple of the dishes were completely tasteless$ and the servers were nice, I was astounded that we were put on a time clock for our dinner.   If they book too many people that is their problem.   At $168 +++ per person that is just outrageous.    We will not be back here again.   Never have been treated like that before.

Gorgeous and delicious all of them! Interesting things like little itty bitty squid and tiny baby translucent eels. The only dish I didn't care for was the turtle soup. It has a sharp flavor and I felt guilty about the turtle I had as a pet growing up. All the sushi pieces have been elaborately prepared with complex sauces or smoking.

I mean, seriously, I'm sure owning your own home is overrated.\n\nKusakabe operates under a omakase menu style with a $95 or $150 option. We opted for the $95 option and it is pretty much set although the sushi chef has a little bit of wiggle room with 5 different seasonal sushis of the day. He will also ask you at the beginning what type of fish you usually like! Pro tip: MUST sit at the bar. After your omakase is done you can opt to go a la carte to try other types of fish.

Standouts will be emphasized with CAPITAL LETTERS!\n1. First brewed dashi: A light broth with tons of umami, good to kick off your appetite\n2. Sushi Prelude: \n-SEARED CHUTORO comes standard and was amazing!\nTwo kinds of seasonal sushi of the day: \n-Hirame (Halibut with halibut liver and shiso leaf) - I'm not usually a fan of halibut but this was really good quality and the shiso leaf added freshness while the liver added creaminess\n-Katsuo (Lightly cherry wood smoked bonito) - Smokey flavor added a lot to this one and the smooth tuna texture had a great mouth feel\n3. Sashimi course: Maguro and Hokkaido Scallop with fresh wasabe & yuzu onion sauce. Both really good quality, the scallop was sweet and delicious with a good portion and the yuzu onion sauce was intriguing.\n4. Hassun: This was 7 bites served together and you are free to eat it in any order. I chose to try and eat it in order of lighter to heavier -\n-Baby Eel: This was something new, not too much flavor but the broth it came in was delicious\n-DUCK BREAST: refreshing to get a bite of meat and it was well cooked and served over broccolini\n-Salmon wrapped in daikon: Good salmon flavor, tastes more refreshing with the daikon\n-Kusshi oyster: Fresh oyster, yum\n-Rice octopus: Good texture and flavor\n-Tamago with snapper: This egg was super fluffy and sweet tasting, not like your usual tamago\n-TORO ON BOX RICE: The toro was amazing and the rice perfectly seasoned\n5. SOUP: Spring hamaguri soup with fresh bamboo shoot, wakame & shiitake mushrooms - perfect to have something warm. The clams were perfectly cooked, broth filled with umami.\n6. Sushi Chic:\n-BURI (Wild Yellowtail): Basically the best yellowtail ever. It had more fattiness like chutoro but tons of that delicious yellowtail flavor. See picture for amazing fattiness!\n-Kuromutsu (Japanese blue fish): Very light flavor but nice bite and texture\n-COPPER RIVER KING (Wild Alaskan king salmon with Oboro Konbu): Best salmon ever, so much flavor and the bit of seaweed on top gives it a touch of earthiness. \n7. Sushi Finale:\n-WAGYU (A5 grade Miyazaki Wagyu strip loin): Lightly seared and salted, it's definitely the best wagyu sushi I've had. The sear is key!\n-TORO (Bluefin fatty tuna belly): Ridiculous. Watching Chef Kusakabe cut this fish and then watching the chefs gingerly pass the pieces down the line and then watching your chef assemble the sushi is a ridiculous level of anticipation. And it was worth it.\n\nAt this point you're essentially devastated that your meal is over and it's time to make some tough decisions. We added:\n-KAMASU: Lightly seared Japanese Barracuda - great sear flavor on a slightly fishier taking fish. Definitely a good add.\n-TORO: What, again?? We needed to have another bite but this time our sushi chef seared the toro gently and added all sorts of other goodies. It completely changed up the flavor of the toro and was so worth it. MUST do again.\n\nNext time I will add:\n-KAISUI UNI (Deep ocean packed Hokkaido sea urchin): If you're looking for a different type of uni this is an interesting bite. Creamier texture, lighter flavor, more sweet. We watched the guy next to us eat it jealously.\n-JI KINMEDAI (Cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper): I didn't over this because I had it at Akiko's before but the guy next to us, again, said it was the best. Dammit. Next time.\n\nAll in all it was an amazing dining experience and I can't wait to go again! It is a SAN FRANCISCO MUST.", "author": "Christina L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-17", "description": "4.5 STARS. Took my mommy to a lovely dinner at Kusakabe yesterday to celebrate late mommy's day. My mother is just as crazy about sushi as I am (if not more) and after taking her to Wakuriya for her birthday, I had to find a comparable restaurant for Mother's day. Kusakabe is definitely of the same caliber as Wakuriya but the experience is entirely different.\n\nOmakase style dinner is pretty much the Japanese version of prix fixe except with a little bit more excitement to it because certain parts of the menu (specifically the sashimi) will change depending on what the sushi chef feels like making. That being said, the chances of you liking every single type of sashimi may not be 100% but that's to be expected with any tasting menu. Still, while certain cuts of sashimi were too thick or too chewy for my taste, there's no denying the freshness and quality of the fish. Of the omakase menu, my favorites were the Shigoku oyster with caviar with the petite plates, the miso glazed alaskan halibut, and the grade A5 wagyu beef. SO DELICIOUS. I'll have seconds of those three dishes, please.\n\nAfter the omakase (which lasts about 1.5 hours), they give you an a la carte menu to order from (you can only do a la carte after omakase). We tried the Aoebi (steamed blue prawn with crystallized egg yolk) - yummy but not what I expected. I imagined the crystallized egg yolk to look and taste different but it kind of just looked like yellow dyed roe and didn't really taste like anything. The steamed blue prawn was delicious though but I'm not quite sure if it's worth $7.5 per piece. We also tried the Sakuramasu (Japanese cherry salmon with cherry leaf) - yummy and melts in your mouth. The cherry salmon did not have the typical milky taste people tend to associate with salmon; the taste was milder but still delicious. For dessert, we each got a scoop of sweet potato ice cream which was super yummy! :)\n\nAtmosphere is slightly busier than Wakuriya. They had about 4 servers and 5 sushi chefs (W only has one server and one sushi chef). The place is also slightly bigger and was able to accommodate approx. 20 people when we were there. \n\nDining experience lasted about 2.5 hours and was paced perfectly. We didn't feel rushed throughout the meal nor did we have any awkwardly long wait time in between dishes.\n\nPricing wise, the omakase is $95 per person which I think is very reasonable for a Michelin star restaurant. Their a la carte items are more expensive if you consider each piece of nigiri is priced at around $7 to $15. This adds up fast but still, I would recommend trying one or two items from the a la carte menu and of course getting dessert!\n\nOnly street parking available but we found parking easy enough! There are a bunch of metered parking spaces available on Washington Street.\n\nTo sum it up, GO GO GO. Don't even think about the price or whatever else is stopping you. Just make that reservation!", "author": "June Y."}

What a treat.\n\nThe sushi is absolutely fresh and wonderful.  I loved his technique of smoking fish.  He placed the sliced fish on a cherry board and used a torch to burn the surrounding wood which gave the fish a slight hint of smokiness.  Delish!\n\nWe did the grand Omakase tasting menu with the sake pairing.  It was very good.  The portions were not enough so we ordered a few more items.  The wagyu beef was so good we got seconds of that.  He also had 3 types of uni that night: regular uni from Hokkaido, short spine uni from Hokkaido, and regular uni from Santa Barbara.

We were lucky enough to be seated right in front of Chef Kusakabe! \n\nThe kaiseki began with kelp tea, something I've never had before, but exactly how you would imagine it to taste.\n\nThe sushi prelude consisted of zuke chutoro, halibut, and bonito. The halibut was served with bits of halibut liver, adding a nice kick to each bite. \n\nThe sashimi had hokkaido scalop and blue fin tuna nestled in shaved ice with fresh wasabi and yuzu onion sauce. I found the scallop surprisingly not chewy and delicious. I'd highly recommend using the sauce to give the sashimi lots of flavor.\n\nThe \"kamo dango\" duck and \"asari\" clam Miso soup with Mitsuba leaf\nlarge clam tasted amazing and overflowing with flavor. The duck meatballs were quite a treat. \n\nThe hassun consisted of 5 different petite plates. Cod egg, black salmon, shigoku oyster with french daurenki caviar, toro with salmon flakes, and wagyu beef. My favorite was the cod egg since it tasted the most unique. I've never had caviar before, but it just tasted salty.\n\nThe warm dish was a tofu-chwan-mushi with fresh steamed dungeness crab and nameko mushroom. It tasted so good and I wish I could have had more.\n\nThe sushi chic consisted of wild hamachi, japanese barracuda, and alaskan king salmon with sakura leaf.\n \nThe sushi finale is either the bluefin fatty tuna or miyazaki wagyu beef. My giflfriend and I split one of each. The bluefin fatty tuna just melts in your mouth and so does the wagyu beef because of it's high fat content. The wagyu is seared on one side and raw on the other side.\n\nAfter the Kaiseki style meal, we were presented with the a la Carte menu. We opted for the shirayaki (fresh bbq white eel) and the hokkaido sea urchin. This sea urchi tasted extremely creamy and is the best I've had. It is shipped from Japan and packed with ocean water to maintain the freshness. The piece of shirayaki was thicker than most unagi, had a crunchy skin, and sauced perfectly.\n\nFor dessert we had the yuzu and shiso-leaf sorbet. I really enjoyed this dessert and it was not very sweet at all with lots of natural yuzu flavor.\n\nThis place really encourages eating sushi the traditional way, aka with your fingers. I thought it greatly added to the experience and having Chef Kusakabe serve us personally was a HUGE plus. In between dishes, we had the pleasure of watching him masterfully prep the sashimi. I'd highly recommend coming here and sitting at the bar.", "author": "Edward W."}

My lovely BF surprised me with reservations here for our anniversary and oh my god it was such a beautiful and creative dining experience.\n\nReservations become available online 2 months in advance and for the true omakase experience you gotta sit at the sushi bar so you can watch your chef can personalize each part of the meal to your liking :) \n\nThey only serve omakase, a $150 grand set or the $95 set, with options for add-ons at the end of the meal. Feeling fancy, we opted for the grand set and if you're looking for a time to splurge, this would be it!\n\nThe omakase experience is unique to each restaurant but the creativity and care that goes into each piece is where Kusakabe really shines. Each dish was well-thought out and went beyond just the typical nigiri. Before our meal our sushi chef asked us if there was anything we didn't like or really liked. I really dislike wasabi and usually for omakase they add it to every piece of sushi. However our chef made sure to only put a small amount for all my pieces and I couldn't even taste it!\n\nI believe the menu changes seasonally, but here's what we had:\n- Ichiban Dashi - first up was soup, like a fancier version of miso soup, probably the best soup I've had using dashi broth!\n- Sushi prelude - next we were served 5 pieces of nigiri sushi, one was the king of all sushi - the toro tuna! So soft and buttery, each and every piece. The other 4 pieces were seasonal and the chef makes sure to tell you where each fish comes from :) I believe we had scallop from Santa Barbara!\n- Sashimi - next we were given four different types of sashimi paired with 4 different unique types of sauce/toppings. One included truffle shavings and another was mussels. The flavor combos were so good, although some I liked more than others but definitely all flavors I had never tried before.\n- Hassun - the creativity continues with a box of a random assortment of seafood in all shapes and forms. But presentation on point for errything. Honestly some weren't that tasty (there was a weird seafood cracker that I didn't like) but again, just so unique and such detailed preparation.\n- Soup - this was a creamy cauliflower soup with abalone and abalone mushrooms. Tasted like a lighter version of clam chowder but seriously soo delicious!\n- Sushi Chic - more nigiri sushi including uni (sea urchin) from Santa Barbara! I'm not a big uni fan but oh boy this one was so buttery and creamy and slightly sweet. Definitely can taste the quality and freshness!\n- Sushi Finale - ended with Unagi (BBQ eel) and a choice of toro or wagyu beef. I'd recommend the wagyu beef since it is so tender and they sear it right in front of you with a touch of pepper. It just melted in my mouth like butter. How is this possible?! \n\nOn top of the amazing food was amazing service. They surprised us at the end with sorbet at the end to celebrate our anniversary!

Had 1 spoonful, then I ordered 3 more for myself. My second favorite would be the baracuda. Although the fish was only seared, the crisp on top and the sweet taste was perfect.\n\nThe wagyu was mediocre probably because they added too much salt.

The experience was excellent from making the reservation to enjoying the meal.\n\nSince then we've probably eaten here 3 more times. They now have a \"Grand Omakase\" option. Value-wise it's great and it's also very filling. Let me break my experience down. \n\nOMAKASE: a set menu of deliciousness. All 90% of the sushi served is nigiri. The fish is fresh and the flavors are not overwhelming. Good and simple does the trick. We recently had the \"grand omakase\" and it was filling for me. Why opt for the GRAND version? It has more sushi pieces and popular items that are usually ordered are already included. In the end, the GRAND will save you more money.\nThe regular Omakase is still an excellent option. The experience and quality of fish does not change with the regular omakase. Only difference will be the portion and maybe the wagyu beef at the end. \n\nSAKE: Kusakabe offers a wine or sake pairing. My husband always tried the sake and I would take little sips just to try (I'm a lightweight.). Let me tell you, this place serves some of the best sake! I'm definitely more of a sake person than wine. You don't have to do the pairing but I do suggest the Dassai \"Centrifuge.\" It's light, sweet, and not too dry. \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: Excellent. I have nothing more to say except that they are on point. \n\nCON: pricey but it is high quality.

This was my second time doing a bougie omakase, my first was Sushi Nakazawa in NYC. Your experience will differ based on how talkative your chef is - ours was a little too reserved for my preference.\n\nThe sushi and sashimi courses were flawless - standouts were the white eel (OMG so good, with a slight crispiness on top ahh), uni (melts in your mouth delicious), chutoro, wagyu. However I didn't enjoy the kaiseki dishes as much, but that is true in general, not due to any fault of Kusakabe.\n\nWhile I liked the omakase at Nakazawa better (there was no yellowtail in this omakase, and I wish the fatty tuna at Kusakabe was fattier!), but you definitely get more food at Kusakabe.

Overall no regrets! But with all the amazing sushi places in SF I probably won't be making a return visit, at least for a long time.", "author": "Christine Y."}

Kusakabe basically puts any sushi I've ever had to shame.  And, after some discussion with my husband, it's possible that this would outrank our sushi experience in Tokyo.  I initially was skeptical about a prix fixe menu at a sushi place, but to be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way - Chef Nori knows what he's doing.  And before everyone goes crazy about how you can't get full off of a prix fixe sushi menu, just know that if you're inhaling your sushi at a pace that you can't enjoy it, well then you've done something wrong.\n\nI'm sure the menu changes frequently here, so in the interest of wanting to make this consistent, the outstanding items we had here were the Zuke Chutoro and the Miyazaki Wagyu beef sushi.  The most beautiful plated dish of the chef's four assorted small plates with the oyster, and Kusakabe made miso soup insanely amazing when it threw in some black truffles for mine, and a duck meatball for my husband.  Each sushi piece we had was mindblowing, and while we agreed that all the fish we had leading up to the finale was amazing, the last pieces of the wagyu beef and the bluefin fatty tuna was really what pushed things over the edge.  The bill was, well, what you'd expect at a place like this, but in all seriousness, if you could only throw down money at an amazing dinner, and you appreciate the delicate attention to detail, please choose Kusakabe.  I must absolutely come back here again!", "author": "Lisa I."}

Your food is great, it is stellar.  But, even the last few bites will leave a horrible taste and memory given the service we were provided with last night. \n\nIt appears much of the service staff have changed over the years.  They do not care about the diner who has opted for the longer Grand Omakase menu, willing to spend more and enjoy their meal, as keeping a schedule is more important than allowing the customer to finish their meal.  Gone are the days when the maitre d himself would go above and beyond to serve, even giving you his personal cell number, to have all aspects of your dining experience taken care of. \n\nWe were late by 10-15 minutes from our reservation at 5:45, and make no excuses for that.  The quality and presentation of the food was wonderful, and as the Omakase finale approached, the chef offered a la carte menu to us. We were excited to try some other items as some of us were still hungry.  The chef was in the middle of preparing the a la carte items when a woman came to us at around 7:45pm, said that there was a seating at 8pm, then briskly walked away.  The front of the house proceeded to unceremoniously kick us out. They immediately stopped service on hot tea and water.  We tried to chew through the last few pieces with nothing to wash it down with. Bits of rice were left in our mouths as we tried to lick it off our teeth, swallow a few more times than usual, and did our best to finish the remaining pieces.  There goes $30-$40 worth of fresh sushi we did not get to enjoy.  We were not served any dessert as we saw ice cream being scooped and what looked like berries being served to the rest of the parties. \n\nFor hospitality staff to utter a couple of short insincere 'sorry's', then summarily dismiss your customers, having them get out of their seats, stand up against the wall while waiting for the staff to run their credit card, all the while leaving the area unbussed and unset even as the customer leaves leave is not only complete opposite of the Japanese embodiment of spirit, heart, and kimochi, it is simply outright rude. \n\nIt wasn't even 8pm yet when we were ushered out the door.  We were literally standing against the wall by our seats at the bar, holding the folios in our hands against our forearms as a surface to sign the receipts on. \n\nTo add insult to injury, the party to our left stayed longer than we did, and continued to chat the evening away in leisure, even though we both had the Grand Omakase, and they had started earlier.  They were still seated after we left! \n\nWhy offer us a la carte if your FOH is going to kick us out before we can barely finish them?  Why are you punishing us for choosing a longer, grand menu and paying 70% higher price for it? \n\nIt is truly disappointing to see this in what should be considered a quality, classy experience. \n\nI love you Kusakabe Taishou, but, please, onegai, don't bite the hand that feeds you. \n\nTo those who are interested in trying: \n\nIn all fairness, this is one of the better places to get sushi, hence the two stars.  If you decide to go, you need to be the flexible customer, not the staff.  Order the regular omakase instead of the grand, so you are not as rushed.  Save yourself the 70% upsell, because you won't be allowed to savor or enjoy it.  Do not order any additional a la carte items because they will cut the service short and kick you out.  It is your fault for ordering too much food.  The FOH is inflexible and will give you fake crocodile smiles and alligator sorry's as they hurry you out because all of a sudden, it's a few minutes to 8pm and it's your fault you are still sitting there, ruining their schedule.  It's your fault for not keeping time, so you basically forfeit the rest of your meal. \n\nFor $200 not including drinks and tips, your money could be better spent elsewhere.  Go to Omakase, go to juu ni.  Avoid Kusakabe until the front of the house b*tches are let go, and trained experienced staff who know the meaning of service are back.", "author": "Bruce F."}

It apparently took my boyfriend's boss 6 months to get a call-in reservation. My boyfriend used the app \"Reserve\" and secured a reservation a month in advance. The app also pays the bill automatically once you are at the restaurant. \n\nKusakabe was my first Omasake and Michelin star experience. They offer a $95 prefixe menu and automatically add tip to the bill. If you are still hungry after the prefixe (which is a lot, trust me), they have an optional nigiri selection for added costs, including octopus and sea urchin.\n\nThe sushi is incredibly flavorful and they hand-grate their own fresh ginger and wasabi (sweeter and more delicate than ready-made wasabi). Kusakabe uses soy sauce, teriyaki, and lemon to enhance the delicate flavors of fish, so no need to add it yourself. The mushroom dishes were inventive and interesting, but too many for my liking (even though I love mushrooms). You are free to make specific requests in case you don't like a particular food like mushroom or egg, but do this in the beginning; they will ask you.\n\n1/12/15 Prefixe Menu Critique:\n1. Ichiban Dashi - Great broth to get the belly ready for the feast ahead.\n2. Sushi Prelude: \n     Zuke Chutoro - Bluefin tuna cured in soy sauce sauce and seared with a blowtorch.\n     Two seasonal sushi - My favorite was the halibut, which was cut thin enough to see through. My boyfriend loved the tuna with lemon.\n3. Sashimi - Perfect dish! The tuber slice was a nice added crunch. \n4. Umami Soup - Personally, though there was too much mushroom for my taste, but overall good, delicate dish. Quintessential umami flavor. Not sure if I liked the rice and lotus root dumpling, but I'm glad I tried it. \n5. Hassun (Le Petite Plats) - I did not enjoy the mushroom or egg plats, but the others were wonderful. My favorite was the warm truffle croquette and caviar oyster.\n6. Warm Dish - The flavor was too subtle. It needed a kick like an added spice. By this dish, I was getting sick of the mushrooms, so I did not eat the mushroom portion. I'm also not a fan of sweet potato (satsuma-imo), but it was an interesting dish because of the combination. I wish it had an added crunch to contrast the soft foods. If you are brave, look up Shirako, which is in the dish.  \n7. Three kinds of sushi - All delicious!\n8. Sushi finale (Your Choice) - I chose A5 Grade wagyu beef, lightly seared. My favorite sushi of the entire meal! A wonderful finale. \n\nFor my birthday, Kusakabe also gave me a complimentary dessert, Chestnut ice cream - a unique dessert, but not something I would crave. They also sang \"Happy Birthday,\" which was absolutely adorable. \n\nOverall, this was a fantastic experience! I would definitely recommend Kusakabe to any foodie or sushi lover who is willing to spend big bucks. Go ahead and indulge.", "author": "Joanna S."}

Being from Boston, we also happen to be seated next to someone from Quincy. Small world.\n\n[Service]: Your dinner experience is impacted depending on where you sit for sushi. I prefer to be seated at the sushi bar, and this time was no different. You are able to mingle with the chef if you like, and get his opinion on what is best that day. Being able to be served by the chef as soon as it is ready is a much better experience than being seated at a table and waiting for a server to bring your food. With that said, the food came out fast.\n\n[Food]: I would like to begin this section and mention the konbu cha (kelp tea) was surprisingly good--I had to hunt some down for myself. Onto the food: Kaiseki style omakase. Konbu cha followed by delicious chutoro, great way to start. At the bar, we're asked what kind of sushi we like, and were tailored to that for the sushi chic (might be different for dining room table). Finally, you have a blue pill or red pill kind of choice for either toro or wagyu. At the time when I went, there were two soup bowls that were between servings of nigri or small plates. Not only for cleansing the pallet, but this kind of progression gives it a sense of peaks and valleys (tea, solid, solid, soup, solid, solid, soup, etc). What holds this back though is probably the rice vinegar. The nigri was good, but it didn't have a wow factor.\n\n[Decor]: The sushi bar is near the entrance. I am not sure if there is a dining room area in the back, so I am unable to comment on it. It is clean and simple. The lights are more focused on the table and not directly above where you sit. Exposed brick wall and what appears to be a single cut of wood for what is the sushi bar table. I would have liked the seats to be a little higher.\n\n[Atmosphere]: You won't need to shout here to be heard. There are much more intimate places you can take someone to, Kusakabe is more for social event. Being in downtown, there were some business types as well. I would not say there is a strictly enforced dress code, but it is an unspoken rule for fine dining establishments. Do you really want to eat at a Michelin Star and look like a hobo? Polo at minimum.\n\n[Pro-tip]: For the sushi finale, just order the other one a la carte. They're both different taste and texture, and just too delicious to not have both.", "author": "Gary W."}

About 2 days before, I received a call reminding me of my reservation and some questions about food preferences or restrictions.\n\nThankfully, I was also able to get a seat in front of the sushi bar and even in front of head chef Kusakabe as well. I cannot even begin to describe how transcendental the experience was. It felt like we were transported away from SF and the hustle and bustle of Silicon Valley and invited into Kusakabe's own cozy home. \n\nThe dinner started with a kombu-cha which blew our minds already with the amount of umami it contained. We then had zuke toro, bonito, the sushi chic, a jaw-dropping turtle dumpling soup, followed by more nigiri. While I cannot remember some of the specific fishes or the order of them as I'm writing this review months later, I do remember each piece being distinctly delicious. Chef Kusakabe brought about a lot of flavors that I haven't experienced in nigiri yet; he seems to love using citrus and acid as a way of lifting flavors and stimulating the senses. At every step of the dinner, Chef Kusakabe took the time to explain each piece of nigiri to us and what would taste and experience.\n\nWe ended our omakase with pieces of Toro and A5 Wagyu beef both of which were so good that I wished I would never have to swallow and could just keep chewing them forever. We followed the omakase with some more pieces a la carte such as Kamasu (barracuda) and Kohada (gizzard shad - it was also my first time having Kohada and Chef Kusakabe was kind enough to explain the fish to me). \n\nThe bill was pretty steep but when you see the love and inspiration that goes into each piece as well as the thought and quality of material, it was definitely worth it.

Kusakabe is my absolute favorite  fine-dining experience I have had so far! It was my first experience of the Japanese fine-dining and gave me my first touch with kaiseki as well.\n\nKaiseki is an artful method of preparing and serving food -- the entire meal is a balance of taste, texture, appearance and colors. So of course presentation is of huge importance, and every dish you receive is poetically beautiful. After just returning from Tokyo and a few kaiseki-style dinners there, I am so grateful that San Francisco can boast hosting Kusakabe. \n\nYou will experience the respectful, careful, and loving attitude towards the ingredients here. You will definitely notice the superbness of all the ingredients that are used, from the soy sauce to the toro. ALL of the dishes made me feel happy, every piece was a beautiful mix of flavors. A few of the new flavors I experienced here was the kelp konbu cha, a surprisingly sweet and buttery scallop, truffle with unagi wrapped in egg, and the zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce). \n\nAnother a la carte item I encourage people to try is the BBQ white eel. I found this very special since most of the unagi you will eat in your life is pre-packaged and frozen. The chefs at Kusakabe buy their own eel and prepare it themselves. Even the sauce is prepped in-house, eel-based.

I had to book a reservation month in advance because they get really busy as it is a fairly small restaurant.\n\nTheir service was a bit lackluster considering the price and stature of Kusakabe. I felt neglected throughout the meal. I don't know if it had to do with the fact that my girlfriend and I were the youngest of age in the restaurant. However, that shouldn't be a factor in providing good service right?!\n\nNonetheless, I had an amazing time sitting at the sushi bar because I was able to admire Chef Nori's knife mastery. You can really tell he loves what he does because each dish was carefully prepared and plated. Every part of the Omakase was delicious ranging from appetizers to the final part. All the fishes used were very fresh and melted in my mouth immediately. Words can't describe how much flavors filled my mouth every bite I took. My only criticism is the A5 Waygu was oversalted and not tender. Kind of disappointed. And there was more soy sauce than I liked on each piece of nigiri.\n\nOverall, if you love fresh sashimi, you can't go wrong with Kusakabe and Chef Nori's skills. But, be prepared to spend big bucks to satisfy your hunger!!!!", "author": "Ronny Y."}

The second thing to note is to not get caught in the hype.\n\nKusakabe's food is good, though not exceptional. My bf and I got the Omakase plus the supplements. Some dishes were creative and I enjoyed the spread with the oyster, firefly squid (?), shrimp and the dish with the green puree (incredibly creative!), but was not impressed with some of the other dishes and experience.\n\nMy bf and I especially enjoyed our other experience at Hinata because the chefs seemed more open and collaborative. There was another chef that night that was being passive-aggressively rude to our chef by grabbing the fish spread before our chef and bumping into our chef. This was probably the main point that contributed to not a perfect experience since it made me and the guests beside me feel awkward to see the chefs like that.\n\nOverall, the fish quality is great, creativity is here and there, the service was average to below average.", "author": "Vi T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-27", "description": "tldr; can be hard to get/make reservations, but well worth it. would recommend getting the shorter (and very affordable!) tasting menu and adding nigiri pieces over the grand menu\n\nYup. Definitely the best nigiri in SF. I feel iffy about the omakase and my experience overall, but having gone to quite a few different sushi restaurants in the city, Kusakabe was definitely not a disappointment.\n\nCame here on a Saturday night to celebrate the SO's birthday. We got 5pm reservations and I was pretty amazed at how quickly the restaurant filled up. Within 10-15 minutes, almost every seat was taken which gives you an idea of how crazy popular this place is. \n\nPro tip. Show up early. I don't think they seat people in a particular order, it was basically just first come first serve for the bar. I noticed the first couple that got seated got the head chef so that's also some incentive to come earlier than later. \n\nAnyways, we had a super nice dude serve us our sushi. My friend had come before and recommended the grand omakase ($150/pp) so we went with that. Our menu items were: \n-ichiban dashi (fresh brewed broth from dried kombu and katsuo-bushi\n-zuke chutoro, bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce and four pieces of seasonal sushi\n-Chef's four kind of sashimi with Italian summer truffle, and Yuzu onion sauce\n-Japanese oyster with caviar\n-Hako-Zushi of the day\n-Six kinds of Chef's assorted petits plats (oyster, fried crab claws, eggplants, etc)\n-Snap pea surinagashi (soup) with crispy Arare Alaskan Kinki and white bean paste\n-Hokkaido sea urchin and three kinds of seasonal fish\n-Shirayaki fresh BBQ white eel\n-Toro or Miyazaki Wagyu beef\n\nIn general I thought the nigiri pieces were killer. Super delicious, really well done. Easily the best in the city. Unfortunately, the other things, where were more tapas style, I was not a big fan of. I thought they were fine, clearly well executed, but just not as standout or memorable.\n\nI think the real move here is to actually get the shorter omakase and then if you're still hungry, pay extra money for extra pieces. That additional $50-60/pp I think would have been better spent on actual nigiri pieces which were really just WOW. Fish was super fresh, the combinations that they had were so creative and innovative, it really was a different league. \n\nWhat surprised me and disappointed me about the evening was the service. The SO and I had a really unpleasant experience with our waitress. Overall, I just felt like she gave us a lot of attitude, was pretty condescending, and treated us as if we were kids who had never eaten at a nice restaurant before. A couple of examples. I asked for what teas were available, and she started off listing them off in the Japanese form (e.g. hojicha) and the translation, but then stopped, and started to just give them in English cause I presume she thought I didn't know anything about Japanese tea. I'm no expert but I at least know what I'm ordering... then she came back and forgot my order... The SO also asked for sake recommendations, and he admittedly doesn't know a ton about sake, but she gave him a bit of sass about his lack of descriptors for what he wanted. It just gave us a really uncomfortable feeling while we were dining. I was also surprised because generally a Michelin restaurant slays at service. Frankly, I've been to triples when I had less eating experience and people were never condescending to me. That was the low point of our meal.\n\nOtherwise, everyone else we met was fun and great. Our sushi chef was a really knowledgable nice guy, and most people were friendly. They brought out a yuzu ice cream with a candle and the restaurant sang happy birthday to the SO which I thought was cute and a wonderful gesture. \n\nUltimately, Kusakabe I think does have the best nigiri in the city. I think people's opinions of the omakase will vary depending on how much they like nigiri, but it's definitely pretty 50-50 nigiri and non nigiri pieces.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

At each restaurant, we had the full omakase menu.  \n\nOverall, Kusakabe's quality of fish is on par with both Omakase and Wako.  However, we felt that the execution of many items was subpar.  Several nigiri and kitchen items were overpowered by some component of the dish, whether it be too much cucumber rolled within trout, too much acid (lemon) on the oyster,  or beans that dominated the crab salad.  We just want the fish to shine.\n\nOn the plus side, Kusakabe's rice was well cooked and seasoned.  We liked that, proportionally, the balance of fish to rice was just right.  Wako, on the other hand, served too much rice and it was not as well flavored.  The items that really stood out for us at Kusakabe:  Cauliflower/abalone soup, Bonito, Scallop w/uni, Toro, Wagyu beef, Medium blue fin tuna, white eel, and homemade sesame ice cream with hot sauce (additional fee for dessert).\n\nAmbiance wise, Kusakabe is much more casual, loud and impersonal than Omakase and Wako.  The kitchen is busy, busy, busy, and there is much more limited chef interaction at the bar as compared to Omakase and Wako, both of which are quiet, subdued, and intimate.  It really depends on what you prefer.  If you're on a casual friend's night out, go to Kusakabe so you can talk and laugh as loud as you like.  If you're in the mood for ambiance and peace, both Omakase (especially) and Wako should fit the bill.\n\nSpeaking of bills, they're all priced the same, but we felt that Omakase served larger pieces of fish.", "author": "Gina T."}

I have been to higher end sushi restaurants in Tokyo before, and this place is definitely close to what I had experienced. The dessert was on the house because of my birthday.

The quality of the fish is extremely fresh, the technique that goes into slicing, seasoning, and delicately balancing the flavors of the nigiri (because rice is important too!) is impressive. You don't *just* get kanpachi or sake, you get the kanpachi belly that's seared in house-made yuzu and torched by the chef. \n\nDo I think $95 is steep? Most definitely. This isn't the kind of place where you go in and out for good sushi, you definitely go to experience the atmosphere and sample the skills of the sushi chefs. For those who are curious, Mitsunori Kusakabe, the owner, is the only one who slices the sashimi, an important distinction since the way the fish is cut can really make or break the sushi!\n\nI could go on and on about the freshness of the fish, and the never-before-tasted flavor profiles of the omakase, but I'll just let my pictures speak for themselves.\n\ntl;dr - delicious, worth a try, great for a splurge, fish is fresh!

I got to sit at the bar and observe the sushi chefs, who no doubt were quite skilled.  The service was good overall, but the reason behind 3 stars was the fact that there were too many hit and misses. \n\nSome of the pieces of fish I ate like the zuke, was simply fantastic. However, right afterwards, the halibut I had, that supposedly came in live that morning, was overpowered by the lime zest and citrus juice sauce that they use, where the fish wasn't even tasted.

I'd have to say this repeated itself over and over again throughout the omakase meal. \n\nMy part also ordered a large amount of Ala carte items after the tasting menu. This was probably the best part of the meal. The buri, a wild Japanese yellowtail was the best piece of sushi all night.

The server kindly said \"happy birthday\" as we arrived and gave us a dessert on the house with a cute candle on the side of the dish as decoration. Although there were some difficulties prior, such as an employee calling me rather confusedly not knowing what to do even though I clearly stated in the notes on my online reservation on the lines of \"anything birthday related is great, if not, that is absolutely okay too\", they still went through with making our time special in the end. We chose the petite omakase; I thought it wouldn't be enough, but I was VERY full and satisfied at the end of the course. There is a wide variety of seasonal fish served as nigiri (3-4 courses), one course of sashimi (I've never tasted tuna like this before-- barely fishy, so tender) and a couple of other eccentric, almost experimental looking dishes because of the choice of plates/dishes/cups and interesting concoctions of food. Service was fast and everything was handled professionally. The first nigiri served to us blew our minds away with the seared nigiri (I forgot the fish but it was so good); it was clear that they planned out the order of the courses to leave us constantly amazed. \n\nOf course, I don't understand the point of reading reviews for high-end or reservation-only restaurants. The experience is entirely up to you and your previous similar experiences. Many negative reviews I see on here are because of people being overly critical of the choice of the chef (again, all about the experience... the chef's choice of serving is theirs, not ours) or purely because they do not respect the orderly fashion of omakase and complain about the staff showing any kind of opposition.

What I loved, was how friendly and attentive everyone in the staff was! \n\nFood: 6/5 Fresh. Delicious. Melt in Your Mouth. Sushi Perfection! Toro and Wagyu are must haves! Those are the first thoughts that come to mind! The amount of detail that our chef, Ken, put into every single dish was astounding! After we finished the omakase menu, we ordered several pieces a la carte and Ken personalized each one to our tastes. Ken is not just a sushi chef, he is an artist and makes every dish into a flavorful masterpiece! \n\nOverall:5/5 With a Michelin star, Kusakabe is not cheap, but it is by far the best sushi I've ever had and worth every single penny!", "author": "Korinna C."}

Each dish and each piece of nigiri was deftly created and well thought out. Unlike most places, the sushi is served with the sauce brushed on, and each bite delivers a satisfying balance of flavors that brings out the natural taste of the fish. My favorite was probably the bonito, which had this nice smoky taste and a little bit of heat from the wasabi.\n\nThe attention to detail really is extraordinary. We were watching the chefs prepare the chi ayu (basically long thin fish) for frying and they were dusting every fin and tail and then painting their bodies with flour in preparation for frying. Speaking of which, the chi ayu was served with a charcoal miso sauce and peppers which was really tasty; it had a nice earthy quality to it. \n\nService was attentive and though dinner was long I never felt bored because it was a joy to watch the staff at work. Overall I great dining experience.", "author": "Becky L."}

We ended up getting two more 8 oz sakes, and in the end, the sake and food cost about the same. Sake definitely complements the sushi, though.  I love their glassware (design, thinness). Sadly, it's pretty much all from a special source in Japan and is not easy to get\n\nWe did the grand tasting ($150/person) and some add ons.\n1. Dashi to start: served warm in a small cup\n\n2. Sushi: I love their rice, and I liked each piece of the sushi to the point that there was no clear cut favorite\n  - Seared chutoro: nice and fatty, cured with soy sauce, love the sear \n  - Hirame: wild halibut with halibut liver and shiso leaf\n  - Katsuo: smoked in cherry wood, topped with garlic, chives, radish, and it tasted almost like bbq  \n  - Hotate: super sweet and tender, topped with uni \n  - Baby snapper topped with crystallized egg yolk \n\n3. Sashimi: the maguro and barracuda were meant to be dipped with either house grated onion with yuzu, chive, and salt or traditional soy sauce + wasabi\n  - Thinly sliced salmon wrapped around cucumber with a bamboo charcoal miso: the miso was very unique \n  - Red snapper: wrapped with ankimo, topped with Italian summer truffle and sitting on a ponzu truffle gelee.  I couldn't taste the truffle much, but the gelee was good \n  - Kamazu: barracuda with micro onion\n  - Maguro\n\n4. Hassun: this was a beautifully arranged platter with lots of flavors and textures\n  - Oyster with caviar\n  - Tempura crab: coated in rice crackers\n  - Shrimp cake with sweet corn: best eaten warm; good with dipping salt \n  - Nasu agedashi: served in a little glass bowl with kani and ikura; this dish is very light\n  - Squid: very thinly sliced, with baby kiwi, toasted pine nuts, and wakame. The wakame was my favorite part of the dish\n  - Box sushi: tuna topped with bonito flakes\n  - Box sushi: tamago with a layer of crab underneath, topped with a goji berry \n  - Fried fish with red onion and a vinegar dashi\n\n5. Soup: Puree of cauliflower, which was very rich tasting. It came with a sweet potato paste in the center for more sweetness and thickness, abalone, trumpet mushrooms, abalone mushrooms\n\n6. Sushi Chic and Sushi Finale \n  - Shima aji: topped with daikon and yuzu\n  - Arctic char: with sea salt and yuzu \n  - Sanma: with grated ginger lime zest, and chives\n  - Uni, but I opted for non uni, and it was a torched oily snapper cured in kombu, which was really good \n  - Shirayaki: BBQ white eel, finished with a light drizzle of sauce and sansho pepper. I like that the sauce doesn't obscure the fish\n  - Wagyu (you could also choose toro): A5, super smooth and buttery\n\nExtras: prices range from $6-15 per piece (tamago vs uni)\n  - Jin kinmedai: golden eye snapper smoked in cherry wood\n  - Kisu: whiting cured with bonito and konbu\n\nWe were too full for dessert by the end.  It ends up being a lot of food.  My only complaint is that there's only one bathroom, so there can sometimes be a wait. \n\nService is always impeccable, and Chef Ngai did a great job of educating us on the dishes. Definitely get a seat at the sushi bar. I've done a table once, and it was NOT the same.

I booked our reservation months in advance (it's near impossible to get a reservation on a weekend without booking weeks/months in advance). A few days prior to our dinner reservation, the hostess gave me a call to confirm. She asked if there were any special occasions that we were celebrating; I told her it was our anniversary.\n\nWe were warmly greeted and seated in front of our dedicated sushi chef right next to the head chef. My girlfriend and I decided to go with the $150/per person Grand Omakase, which was a 25 item dinner. The sushi was some of the best I've ever had and the experience was very intimate -- our sushi chef making conversation throughout our meal and explained each course as he made it right in front of us. Service from the staff was excellent throughout our entire dinner. \n\nAfter our dinner, my girlfriend and I ordered one of the desserts. When they brought it over, they lit a candle, congratulated us on our anniversary, and said that the dessert was on them.

The only thing that matters, is that it tastes wonderful. One quick note, the Chef will ask you if you have any preferences or dietary restrictions at the beginning of your meal and will cater around it which is a nice plus. Luckily for me, I was a free canvas to eat whatever they put in front of me.\n\nService is what really shines here.

Being an avid sushi lover, I knew he would be thrilled to be treated to one of the town's boasted Michelin star Japanese restaurant. Not only did I note on the reservation, but also called & left a voicemail to confirm that this was a birthday celebration. Sadly, there was no mention or even the slightest acknowledgement of my requests. Call me naive, but I was hoping/ expecting better service at a Michelin star restaurant- $400 meal.\n \nAny ways, whomp whomp- at $95 per person, you'll get an omakase (set prix fix menu). No doubt, it's some of the freshest sushi I've had in SF. However, there were also items I didn't thoroughly enjoy, such as the kelp tea (known to help cleanse palate- left a weird after taste) and the soup (which I found rather on the saltier end). \nAs for the grand finale of the omakase, I'd highly recommend the A5 wagyu beef nigiri, from the texture to taste, it was utterly orgasmic (this means a lot coming from a person who doesn't even like beef).\nFor the uni lovers, one MUST try the Kaisui uni (14.50 a piece- hokkaido sea urchin) and Bafun Uni (13 a piece, Hokkaido short spine sea urchin). I can honestly say that each bite was simply heavenly & worth every darn dollar. Hands down the best uni I've had in my life thus far. \n\nVerdict: avid sushi lovers should come try out this place. it's by no means a place to regularly frequent for date night, but it's totally worth a try.

In fact, the final pieces of fish- the chu toro and the wagyu beef- which I looked forward to the most, was the most disappointing. \n\nThe chu toro was what you'd expect, but there was no special touch from the chef that brought out anything remarkable about it. \n\nThe wagyu beef, I expected to melt in my mouth like a buttery fish. However, it was stringy and I ended up having to spit out a portion of it that was unchewable. My biggest culinary regrets was that wagyu beef.\n\nThis was extremely disappointing, as the bill ended up to be almost $500 for the two of us. This is the most we'd spent on a sushi omakase, and it was extraordinarily... unremarkable!\n\nPerhaps it had to do with the fact that our personal sushi chef (he made sushi mainly for us, but also made some dishes for people at the tables) was extremely young and was making sushi only for a year or two. He did not seem to put a personal touch on anything and made the pieces as if following a cookbook. Reading some other reviews, it seems like Kusakabe simply lacks creativity in their work.", "author": "Valerie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-04", "description": "Chef Mitsunori Kusakabe has emitted his global culinary footprint at various Nobu establishments as well as his Michelin star restaurant, Sushi Ran. In 2014, he opened KUSAKABE, the brainchild of his life's work, which features sushi and other plates prepared in the \"kaiseki\" style. \"Kaiseki\" style is typically a multi-course meal that features \"Five Colors, Five Tastes, Five Senses, Five Methods\" - a little bit of everything, if you will. \n\nOmakase means that you'll leave it up to the chef to determine a series of plates for your meal. Our server happily obliged to accommodating any allergies or preferences.\n\nWelcome Tea: Kelp Tea\nThe kelp tea tasted more like a palate opener broth than a tea.\n\nSushi Prelude: Zuke Toro, Halibut with Halibut Liver, Smoked Yellowtail with Daikon Radish\nEach of these pieces of sushi were prepared with the utmost attention to detail and they were presented so beautifully! Be sure to sit at the bar to take in the full experience.\n\nChef's choice sashimi nestled in shaved ice with fresh Wasabi & Yuzu onion sauce: Tuna & Scallop\nThe presentation of this dish was very pleasant and unique. The yuzu onion sauce had a tangy, salty flavor that paired perfectly with the sashimi.\n\nMiso Soup with Homemade Duck Meatballs:\nNot my favorite dish of the meal, but definitely one of the best miso soups I've ever had.\n\nChef's Petite Plates:\nThe petite plates were served on a rectangular dish with separate compartments that tasted just as good as it looked. \n\nEgg Custard:\nI loved the medley of mushrooms and thin slices of green onions in the egg custard here. The texture was great and the flavors were not too overwhelming salty.\n\nWe polished off the rest of the meal with a few other sushi pieces like the King Salmon and finally came to the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, a choice of either Toro (Bluefin fatty tuna) or Grade A5 Miyazaki Wagyu beef. I opted for the Toro, which did not disappoint. If you find yourself curious to try any other varieties of fish or the Wagyu beef, you can order it a la carte at the end of your meal.\n\nI only have one recommendation for this place and that is: go!

I would HIGHLY recommend trying to get a spot there -- it's great entertainment watching the chefs carefully prepare sushi, and you get to eat the pieces one-by-one just like in Jiro. We got the grand omakase, which was well worth the upgrade, at $150 per person instead of the $95. All the fish were incredibly fresh, with fantastic pairings of roe, caviar, green onion, and other house made accoutrements (they even make their soy sauce in house!), and just the right amount of soy sauce and wasabe. The sake was also very nice, and the restaurant let us try a few samples before we decided on one. Some of the best service I've encountered here in SF! We had to run to catch a flight, so couldn't order more off the a la carte menu post omakase, which was disappointing given how much we enjoyed the dinner! \n\nWould definitely come back for a special occasion!", "author": "Christine H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-19", "description": "Chef Nori Kusakabe created this new sushi restaurant, across the street form the Transamerica building, based on ancient Japanese dining traditions of \"Goshoku, Gomi, Gokan, Gohou\" one of the essential tenet in creating Kaiseki menu that is translated to \"Five Colors, Five Tastes, Five Senses, Five Methods.\" \n\nThis is a meld of European Fine dining meets Omakase Sushi from a skilled chef. They have recently received a Michelin Star for their efforts. \n\nIt is essentially a fixed price, set Omakase (Chef's special choice) that everyone eats, in a multi-course fashion, for about $95/person. You can go a la carte and off the menu, but only after your Omakase fixed menu commitment. So it is a little bit Sushi Nazi, but in an elegant way. \n\nI came some time ago with a sophisticated international dining companion. I was ecstatic with the real Japanese traditions and quality, she enjoyed it, but thought it was a little too controlled theatrics. But that is the nature of Michelin starred, fixed priced Chef's menu dining in most cases anywhere.\n\nChef Kusakabe does all the knife cutting of fish. His 4 young assistants, 2 on either side, help prepare the other dishes in the Omakase. He personally presents and announces the dishes to you. Seating is limited to a long sushi bar. \n\nDon't ever come here looking for cheesy mayonnaise rolls and oyster shooters that you like at your local Korean/Chinese owned, Mexican made, \"sushi\" joint. It would be an insult to everyone here, and a total embarrassment to yourself. You might have to commit Harakiri.   \n\nHighlights from our meal (see pics)\n\nWelcoming Tea: Konbu cha -  kelp tea - very soothing\n\nSushi prelude -  Zuke Chutoro - lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in a soy sauce, plus two other seasonal nigiri sushi\n\nSashimi - Chef's special sashimi nestled in shaved ice with fresh wasabi and Yuzu onion sauce\n\nSoup - Italian black truffle miso soup with Eringi and Shimeju mushrooms\nor...\nKamo-Dango, duck miso soup with Mitsuba leaf\n\nHassun - Shigoku oyster with French Daurenki Caviar and four kinds of Chef's assorted petite plates\n\nWarm Dish - \"Kinki\" big hand snapper, \"Mizoreni\" (ice/sleet-like) with Matsutake mushroom\n\nSushi Chic - 3 kinds of seasonal sushi of the day\n\nSushi Finale - Toro - bluefin fatty tuna\nor....\nGrade A5 Miyazaki Wagyu beef\n\nHonto ni oishikatta!\n\nIf you want a dining experience of high end elegance, combining thoughtful fresh ingredients with simplicity and harmony, in the Kaiseki tradition, come here.  \n\nIf you want a roll dripping with velveeta sauce, go to Safeway.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

My guest and I were extremely full when we left. Alcohol was reasonable priced. \nDefinitely looking forward to another meal here soon. Reservation are difficult to obtain, book in advance. \nMy 2nd meals, 4 months later, was once again absolutely fabulous!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-17", "description": "THE REAL DEAL!\n\nYup, this place is the real deal.  I got a seat right smack in the middle of the sushi bar and right in front of Chef Kusakabe himself.  Omakase is the only option ($95).  At the start of the meal you will get a menu for sake and drinks as well as the option for a sake pairing ($75).  The chef will also ask you if there is any foods that you are allergic to or don't like to eat (e.g. shellfish, etc.).  I like everything.  He also asked me what my favorite fish is and I told him \"uni\" although I don't know why he asked me that (uni was not served in the omakase to me).  He also asked what I wanted for my finale (toro or a5 wagyu beef - you can read my choice below).\n\nThe waitress will give you a hot towel to clean  your hands and a small finger towel to clean your fingers after each piece of sushi.\n\nThe omakase started with a small cup of kelp tea.  It was good and had a good taste of the sea in the tea.\n\nWe then had 3 pieces of sushi - Zuke chutoro was very good and smokey.  Perhaps a little strong to start the meal but it certainly hit you over the head with flavor.  He then served a hirame (halibut) which was very fresh and subtle and salmon.\n\nNext up was the sashimi.  There were 2 pieces of scallop and 2 pieces of trout.  The trout had an almost salmon like consistency and slightly smokier taste.  The sashimi came in a small bowl on top of crushed ice.  There were also some small vegetables as well as a dipping sauce of soy sauce or grated onions w/ lemon.  The onions with lemon went well with the delicate flavor of the scallop.\n\nThe soup included a piece of cooked red snapper as well as some soba noodles.  It was hearty, warm, and comforting.\n\nThe petite plates included baby squid in soy based sauce, egg and shrimp wrap, oysters, small block of rice with negi-toro and caviar on top, and a fried ball of rice with seasoning.  The small block of rice with the caviar on top was the clear winner here.\n\nFor the warm dish, it included risotto with wild small mushrooms, monkfish, and ankimo (monkfish liver).  the ankimo was not prepared like little soft blocks but was instead seared similar to how one would prepare foie gras.  It had the texture and taste of foie gras as a result.  Very nice.\n\nWe then had 4 more pieces of sushi including kohada (nicely prepared and not as sour as most other places serve it) and some others.  For the finale, I had the A5 wagyu beef.  My logic was that toro is awesome but I eat a lot of toro.  I rarely eat A5 wagyu beef.  The wagyu beef is seared on one side and then flipped over so that the top is still raw.  It was full of marbling and flavor.\n\nAfter this, you can choose from the a la carte menu.  I chose to add the kamasu (japanese barracuda) which was good.  I also got the shirayaki (white eel) which was cooked with the torch and tasted more subtle (in a good way) that most unagi sushi.  And I got the baby squid as a sushi.  This was the same baby squid that was served earlier but it was still excellent.  Most of the sushi on the a la carte menu ranges from around $8-$15.  The best item is probably the kaisui uni which is a hokkaido uni brought in from Japan.  The uni is caught in Japan and rather than take out the uni and put it into a wooden box, they put ocean water with the uni and transport it that way to the US.  I have had this before so I didn't order it but if you haven't tried it and you like uni, I recommend giving it a try.  It is served on a spoon with sushi rice and uni on top.\n\nThe dessert menu is separate and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was an excellent palate cleanser for the night.  The sorbet broke apart easily which showed that it's freshly homemade.\n\nMy meal for 1 sitting at the bar with tip was around $150 (I didn't drink alcohol).\n\nSpeaking of palate cleansers, the ginger was also pretty good although the taste was a little more lemony than other restaurants.\n\nOverall, I think this is the best sushi in the city.", "author": "Dan P."}

The omakase offers a fresh, creative, and visually pleasing dining experience. Super satisfied with the quality of each bite and overall quantity. I didn't realize that everyone in your party had to order the same omakase. Naturally, I would have opted for the lesser of the two, but in retrospect, I'm glad I had the grander experience.\n\nWe sat at the bar and were treated to three hours of Chef Nori's masterful sushi skills. We were well taken care of - 5 stars for the stellar service! I enjoyed Chef Nori's explanation of each dish as well as learning about the fish's origin. \n\nIf you appreciate high-quality sushi and sashimi, I highly recommend a visit to Kusakabe.", "author": "Brianna M."}

We got seated as soon as we got in. There's only 2 seating (5:15pm and an 8pm one) - we had the earlier seating. The hostess was super friendly and gave me great recommendations for the right sake to pair with my omakase. I had the Tedorigawa Kinka \"Gold Blossom\" - and I usually don't like alcohol, but it was very light and smelled sweet and INDEED went well with my meal. The omakase each night may change, but it is a set menu for everyone and you can order more nigiri at the end of your meal if you're still hungry. Everything was delicious and the executive chef was the one serving me the other night so yay! The setup is very traditional seating, but they also have tables if you wish to sit there - but I would recommend the more authentic route and getting to speak to your chef throughout dinner. We started with Chu Toro with the sides seared - yum!  Halibut with the mint leaf were an interesting combination, but super fresh fish throughout the night. My boyfriend's favorite was the Alaskan King Salmon - he says its the best salmon he's ever had haha - he ordered seconds after our omakase meal. I had another toro because it's my favorite! The Miyazaki Wagyu was also phenomenal - makes me miss Japan so much! The best part of the night was everyone singing happy birthday to me, and to my surprise - they all knew my name! Got my complimentary sorbet with a candle in it too! Bathroom smells good and is super clean too. Would love to return :)", "author": "Amanda C."}

I can not describe it any other way. \nI came here with my girlfriend for our anniversary, with reservations of course. They cannot guarantee seating at the bar, but luckily we got it. We even sat next to the executive chef, who made most our food.\nThere's 2 options for the Omakase: a $95 option and a $150 option. The $150 option has a few more pieces and some rarer fish/meat. The $150 option comes with the grade A5 Wagyu beef, which is probably the best piece of meat I've ever eaten. \nSince everything is amazing and there are way too many pieces of sushi, I'll highlight the best ones.\nThere are about 22 items total in the $150 menu. \n-The lightly seared bluefin was amazing. Explosive start to the meal. Then it's 4 pieces of sushi followed by a small plate of sashimi. All sooo delicious.\n-Then its a plate of assorted pieces such as an oyster with French Daurenki caviar, a Hako-Zushi and some delicately made finger foods. \n-Next dish is a Hamaguri soup with bamboo shoots and mushrooms. The soup was pretty good but there was some broken shell in the clam.\n-The next 5 pieces are different types of sushi. Our chef asked us if we have any favorite fish. I said hamachi and my gf said salmon. So the chef made us exactly those and it was amazing. Then theres the Uni and the BBQ eel, which were both way better than I expected. The Uni was so fresh and the eel was cooked to perfection.\n-The finale: The A5 grade wagyu beef and the bluefin fatty tuna. A perfect end to the best sushi restaurant I've ever had. \nI was really full after all this, but it was so good I wanted more. I cannot wait to come back here again.

Like I don't think people understand... I eat that s#!T for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (and times in-between). I'm in relapse from sushi rehab. I've been to Japan and I literally have eaten at every high-end sushi restaurant on the entire island of Manhattan (including Masa which I thought was garbage).\n\nWhile visiting San Francisco for work, I was searching high and low for sushi spots. I went to one that was highly rated and I couldn't even stomach 2 pieces of sushi. I had to leave. I was extremely disappointed and felt like the SF sushi scene was hopeless. Then, I saw everyones glorious Yelp reviews. Knowing that I was let down before by you guys (my fellow Yelpers, come on now), I was skeptical. I decided to book a table at the sushi counter and I went by myself (this again reinforces how much I love sushi).\n\nI arrived and when I was seated, I saw the menu which said Kaiseki style menu and almost lost my s#!t. Kaiseki?! What? I thought it was omakase SUSHI only. I didn't read the online menu (clearly). I felt really upset and was sure that I wouldn't enjoy my meal. Don't get me wrong... I love kaiseki but I was craving sushi only (and lots of it).\n\nThe meal started and I was told that after the kaiseki/sushi menu, I would be able to order sushi by the piece. I felt relieved and at least loosened up a little.\n\nI was blown away at how amazing each dish was. There was a lot more sushi than I expected (most of this menu is sushi) and the prepared dishes I loved as well. This place is a lot better than most of the very high rated sushi spots I frequent while in NYC. The tuna sashimi was the best I've ever tasted in my life and I was shocked because usually I don't like my sashimi so thickly cut. It straight up melted in my mouth and the sushi was just phenomenal. I won't describe every dish individually because they will likely change often and even if they don't, why ruin the surprise?\n\nIf anyone complains about price, what I would tell them is:\nPlease stop dining at establishments that clearly state a prix-fixe menu price and then go blast it for its price.

Try to sit at the chef's counter if you can when you make the reservation. We had Chef Kusakabe the first time, and Chef Ngai the second time. Both were great, but Chef Ngai was really funny and entertaining to talk to. \n\nEvery piece of nigiri was made with such dedication and focus, you truly cannot NOT enjoy your meal. We had a few a la carte nigiris afterwards and they were all great. There's 3 types of unis, the santa barbara one is the one you can get everywhere. Try the kaisui uni! It's so good and the texture is like butter.\n\nOn the omakase, for the 4th and 8th course, you can choose between: duck miso soup or black truffle soup. I think the black truffle soup is a lot better and tastier! (I love black truffles!). You also have to choose between toro at the end of wagyu A5. You can get either one again on the a la carte menu after the tasting, but go with the toro if you order nothing else! It's just so good!!\n\nMy other favorite sushi places in the city are Akiko's, Ichi, Maruya, Daigo, Pabu and Umi. Kusakabe, is definitely on or above par from all of the sushi places in SF.

Most of the pre-fixe is sushi which all tastes great. As so much of the menu changes (and it is pre-fixe), it's hard to recommend any one thing. I did find that their sushi was better than their warm foods (which were good but not great). In the end the choice between Toro or Grade A5 Wagyu is hard. The toro tastes amazing but if you really want to have something different, go with the Wagyu. I found it to be an amazing new taste (it's prepared like sushi) since I've never had that preparation before. \n\nWe did try the hokkaido deep sea urchins as a la carte and found it to be amazing. I can tell now why Santa Barbara sea urchins just aren't great.\n\nThe service was incredible. It's what I'd expect at a michelin rated restaurant. They were friendly, funny, and attentive but not overbearing. Food was fast and delivered with the right amount of breaks between servings.

This is the first place I've been to around here that not only satisfied me, but left me with a big ass smile on my face during and after the meal.\n\nRequest a sushi bar reservation, and watch the chefs at work. Even if you've never been to a real, legit sushi joint, it's easy to notice the technique and the precision of their work.  Just watch their hands, very carefully.\n\nThe rice is perfect, from the texture to the flavor to the \"packedness\" of the nigiri. The temperatures of all the dishes are perfect. The fish doesn't come straight-out-of-the-fridge. Delicate flavorings like salts and yuzu rind shavings are used in a precise, controlled manner.\n\nThe non-sushi dishes were just as fantastic. The hokkaido scallop in the \"zukuri\" (a.k.a. sashimi) course had this sweetness that you don't get out of usual scallops. The bite-sized croquette had a nice crunchy texture on the outside. The most interesting non-sushi dish for me was the chawanmushi (egg custard) -- it had a little bit of ume (sour plum) hidden away in the center, for a really surprising (in a good way) contrast of flavor. I've never had that in chawanmushi before!\n\nHighlights of my meal were probably the chuutoro zuke (soy sauce-marinated seared medium-fatty tuna) which was just packed with so much flavor and a melt-in-your-mouth texture, the A5 Miyazaki wagyu nigiri (This is one of the extremely rare wagyus that are actually legitimately Japanese. Most places in the US do not have real wagyu/kobe/etc imported, even though they use that term), and the sashimi.\n\nThe dessert, a matcha + azuki chiffon cake, was extremely light, fluffy, and tasty as well.\n\nService was excellent, and everyone on the staff was very friendly.

Also, keep in mind, they only serve Omakase here (an a la carte menu is available only after you finish your Omakase).\n\nMichelin star well-deserved.", "author": "Michele L."}

Their cc system was down, so luckily i didn't have to give them my info to reserve.\n\nSo one thing I noticed is that they don't wash hands or clean them between touching different fish and I also noticed that they use their wet hands to dip into the salt to garnish but don't wash hands between to prevent cross-contamination.  So I'm guessing that the salt container has the taste of all types of fish in there until it is cleaned. And that taste is then transferred to whatever fish they are garnishing. \n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that Chef Kusakabe cuts all the fish and there is one other chef that helps with assembly. (He also didn't was hands between handling each fish.)\n\nThey only offer omakase ($95) and only afterwards, can you order a la carte.\n\nStarted off with the welcoming tea, konbu, which tastes just how you would expect it to taste, kelpy.\nNext was the sushi prelude: Zuke chutoro.  This was ok. A bit slimy.\n\nThen came the snapper, and bonito which were ok.  These too, were slimy. \n\nThen on to the sashimi which were two pcs of bluefin tuna & scallop with soy sauce or some yuzu garlic dipping sauce. These were Ok.  The yuzu garlic dipping sauce was interesting.\n\nUp next was the miso soup: summer truffle miso soup, or duck dumpling miso soup.  The broth was the same for both options but with different ingredients inside.  I thought for miso soup, they were too oily.  But I did enjoy the slices of truffle in them for the truffle one.\n\nBBQ unagi eel with monaka rice cracker sushi with yuzu and sansho pepper, I thought wasn't bad. But it wasn't your typical nigiri.\n\nThe small plate of tomato three ways: poached, sorbet, and fried was refreshing but nothing amazing.\n\nThe trumpetfish & flying fish with golden caviar, was next.  They were decent. \n\nThen came the wild Alaskan king salmon, bluefin toro and grade A5 Wagyu strip loin. You can choose either bluefin or the Wagyu but we just got both.  The Wagyu was a little salty for my taste but it was good.  It melted in your mouth but the flesh was firm, if that makes sense.  I'm not a fan of salmon so that dish was so-so for me. I thought that with the cherry leaf did not mesh well together.\n\nThis definitely did not fill me up so ordered 4 more pieces on top which were ankimo, two different kinds of uni, and shima-aji.  The ankimo wasn't bad.  The uni from Hokkaido (Bafun uni) was sweet which i did enjoy.  But it was a tad too watery in texture.  The shima-aji was unmemorable.\n\nOrdered the tofu ice cream with the monaka cracker which didn't taste like tofu to me.  The yuzu and shiso leaf sorbet was good and refreshing.  The texture was slightly too icy but the taste was good.\n\n$360 for two, before tip and one beer & tea.  I didn't think it was worth it for the price.  And the fish were pretty basic/limited I thought. I think for similar rate, you can get better quality fish at Akiko's.\n\nI like a lot of variety since I eat a lot.

Their Michelin star is well-deserved.\n\nEchoing other reviews, BOOK YOUR TABLE IN ADVANCE...it could take a month or so.\n\nI was so excited to finally try Kusakabe, especially since it's extremely hard to find legit sushi nowadays with restaurants drizzling an excessive amount of sauce to fuse into the Western culture and to also mask the fish's lack of freshness.\n\nThe omakase itself from beginning to end was like a roller coaster ride (except, I kept going up and up...the down was when I finally left). Every piece of nigiri or dish presented to us was SO EXCEPTIONALLY DELICIOUS. The fish literally MELTED in our mouths. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Everything was plated nicely which made it that much more appetizing too. What I really appreciated was Chef Nori's knife skills. He does all the cutting of the sashimi, and there would be assistants on each side of him that makes the nigiri rice. We got suuuuper lucky though, because we sat in the middle right in front of the chef, so not only did we get to admire his skills, but we were also served PERSONALLY by him! Dream come true for a sushi fanatic like myself. My only regret was the sushi finale, we expected it to go out with a *BANG* but it was more of a silent *bang*, the A5 wagyu and toro was slightly chewy. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend the king salmon, zuke, and uni. Those were all items that I got multiples of on a-la-carte (minus the uni, that's not part of the omakase...go figure). I also enjoyed their corn miso ice cream. MUST GET to finish off your meal!

That one meal experience changed everything. Now on to Nori San. He is an expert sushi chef that I would say has mastered his craft, as well. And it was by chance and an absolute pleasure to be sitting at the bar, right in front of him, and being personally served by a master. It was like having front row seats to watching the master in action. \n\nThe whole meal was traditional in some sense (i.e. rice portion, rice temperature, no personal soy sauce), but non traditional in other ways that work. They offer only one choice -- $95 omakase dinner which is explores kaiseki principals to create a multi-course sushi menu. It was fascinating to watch him meticulously slice each fish and assemble it. Of course we ate everything that was offered on the menu, even getting both options where there were options. The finale for example, we were offered a choice between toro (bluefin fatty tuna) or grade A wagyu. I couldn't choose so I had both! The a la carte sushi menu was provided after our meal, and we ordered more than we had planned, but no regrets. The sushi here ranged from $8 - $15 each. The highlights were definitely the following and I recommend ordering the below four: \n\n- Uni (Mendocino sea urchin)\n- Bafun Uni (Hokkaido short spine sea urchin from Japan)\n- Shirayaki (fresh BBQ white eel)\n- Hamo (Kyoto pike eel tempura style) -- MUST TRY!\n\nTo finish off dinner, there were three options for dessert and of course we said we'll take all three, please. The yuzu sorbet, tofu ice cream and the matcha tea creme brulee were all more than amazing. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.\n\nWe had dinner here two weeks ago and Chef Nori said he had only been opened for two months. Making reservations was as easy as leaving a voice mail message. Personally, this place will become Michelin-rated in no time.

There are plenty of sushi joints in SF and many claim to be legit but this place truly explores kaiseki principles in their refined omakase menu. This place keeps the options simple and offers all guests a $95 omakase menu with the option to add a la carte items. The restaurant itself is located right next to the Transamerica building and the d\u00e9cor is simple with multiple seats at the sushi bar with around 6-8 additional tables throughout the dining area. Although I was unable to sit at the sushi bar, I highly recommend folks do this. Even from my seat, it was quite a delight to watch the sushi chefs at work. We were seated immediately and servers came over to take our drink order. There is a good selection of Sake here so I am already a fan.\n\nThis joint is the true omakase as the chefs determine what they will prepare daily depending on the availability of product and the season for certain types of fishes. One thing I want to warn yelpers is that this is a true dining experience and not purely just a sushi joint. If you are coming here to just eat sushi, you have the opportunity to order the a la carte but don't write off the rest of the menu. ON the day we went our menu consisted of the \"tea\", sushi prelude involving a few pieces of nigiri, a sashimi selection, miso soup, unique sushi, sushi plate, sushi chic, tomato tomato tomato (not a typo), and sushi finale. I won't even need to go into to detail but the presentation was just spectacular and the freshness of the fish was mind-blowing. This is without a doubt the best sushi restaurant in SF. The sequencing of the dishes was great to allow palette cleansing and just perfect consistency and rice ratio. The simplicity of this establishment and its ability to deliver masterful ingredients was amazing. I was thoroughly full after the course menu but I have to recommend EVERYONE to try the Toro AND the wagyu for the sushi finale. The toro was nothing like I had ever seen/tasted and just absolute melt in your mouth. \n\nThis entire experience was top notch and I appreciated the simplistic approach to fine cuisine. This is definitely a joint that I will come back any day and bring out of towners too. I can't wait to try the next omakase based on the masterminds behind the sushi counter.", "author": "Dan M."}

The omakase experience was amazing and definitely one I'll always remember. I would recommend sitting at the bar if you get a choice, as I think it makes for a much better experience interacting with your chef and talking with them about the food. They are definitely masters at their craft and I had a great time watching them put their skills into action.\n\nThe meal starts off with some brewed dashi to warm the stomach quickly followed by 3 pieces of nigiri. We then moved to a sashimi course, a soup, and some other Kaiseki style dishes, before capping it off with another 3 pieces of nigiri. For the last nigiri you get your choice of the blue fine toro or the grade A5 miyazaki wagyu beef. It was a difficult choice but I ended up going with the toro. All the food was amazing in terms of tastes and aesthetics. The pieces of fish on their nigiris usually are brushed with some kind of sauce and/or are cured/subtly cooked in a certain way to elevate the flavor of the fish. I think that's what separates their sushi from other sushi that I've had.\n\nDessert is complimentary for your birthday :) I got the chestnut ice cream which the chef makes himself. My friend got the pumpkin pudding which is also pretty good and comes beautifully presented.

Not to get all Sun Tzu on you, but \"worth\" is something that only you can answer for yourself.  \n\nFor me, this place was worth it and then some.....and then some more.  It wasn't just eating sushi, it was the whole intimate experience.  The 4 of us were fortunate enough to get seated right in front of Chef Nori-san.   Having him explain everything he was doing, the region where this particular fish came from, why this time of the year is best for this fish, and why he chose to highlight certain tastes or textures was beyond what I can eloquently explain.  The worth of this experience alone, I would do it no justice in my attempt to describe.  \n\nThe best comparison that I can draw is that this experience was like being invited to Chef Nori-san's personal kitchen at home and having him host the dinner party, minus the credit card part at the end.  ;-)\n\nOur 5pm dinner reservation turned into a culinary odyssey beyond the constraint of time.  We left close to 9pm, but it did not feel long at all.  Time just went by...like at French Laundry.  However, at French Laundry, neither Thomas Keller nor his sous chef ever came out to explain anything (and the sous chef was my boss' nephew).\n\nBack to Kusakabe...my recommendation is for you to go as a couple or no more than 4 people and try to get seated in front of Chef Nori-san or Chef Ken.  (They were two powerhouse chefs that made Sushi Ran what it is.)  So, no longer need to visit Sushi Ran.  If you go with a large party, you miss the whole intention of the intimacy of the Chef's Omakase.  If you want to eat with a large group, go get some pizza.  \n\nIt is a whole different experience to sit at the counter interacting with the Chefs masterfully working on their craft versus sitting a table far away staring at your beer drinking buddies.  This applies to both Kusakabe and Sushi Ran. \n\nI am envious that you will be going soon.  This was truly a wonderful experience.

The quality of fish is probably some the best in SF, the preparations are more creative than at Omakase or Maruya, the two other high end kaiseki style places in SF. The atmosphere is more relaxed than at Omakase and the technique probably better than the current chefs at Maruya. The sushi is prepared in other styles than the Edomae with lots of marinating, layering of flavours and even wood smoked. \n\nTL:DR If you want to experience sushi and sashimi beyond rolls and at the highest level of skill and quality of fish this is probably one of the two best places in SF (Omakase being the other place). If you think rolls with avocado and huge slabs of brightly coloured fish is sushi you will be probably not like this place and whine on yelp about small pieces and other stupid comments that show your ignorance.\n\nAll the deets:\nPrice-one set price of 95 not including drinks or tip. \nTwo seatings at 5pm or 8pm-if you show up a bit early for the 8pm they can seat you if there is a space free. Always sit at the bar. There are four tables but you loss the interaction with the chefs and getting to watch them work. The focus is mostly on the sushi and sashimi so although it's coursed and plated like kaiseki there aren't all the courses and dishes you would find in a full kaiseki meal in Japan.\n\nAs part of the omakase we had 8 pieces of sushi, 4 pieces of sashimi, a turtle soup, a \"risotto\", a wonderful arrangement of small bites they billed as a petit plats. They put tamari on anything they felt needed it beforehand and only the sashimi was served with wasabi. There were so many flavours already in each piece of sushi several of which were fermented or served with shiso or other small garnishes meant to compliment the fish. They did give us a menu with the omakase order for the night and for the last course which was sushi you could pick toro or wagyu.  They did not end the meal with a Mizumono, a seasonal dessert so we ordered the chestnut ice cream that came with chestnut chantilly creme and bits of waffle cones. It wasn't too sweet and nice way to end the meal. The meal start with a kelp tea. We ordered additional buckwheat tea.\n\nBeside the sushi that came with the omakase we also ordered the Sakurani, 8.5, Tea braised Hokkaido octopus and Shimaaji, 8.5, Stripe jack with sweet daikon radish. We didn't get them because we were still hungry just because we were greedy and wanted to try them. Like most authentic places the sushi is by the single piece.\n\nBeside the spectacular quality of the fish, the highlights was the petit plats particular the Shirako with moutain yam and the uni egg with black truffle. The egg was only one bite and the Shirako dish was only two bites but they were perfect in terms of flavour, texture and presentation. I also really enjoy the turle soup which was the Futamono with rice ball filled with turtle meat in a broth. \n\nThe Gohan or rice course was underwelming with a very small amount of uni. The cherry wood smoked sushi was also a bit too heavy on the smoked flavour.\n\nThe chef who served us was Chinese while the owner and head chef is Japanese. The coursing is traditional with a blend of warm and cold dishes. The service both the chefs and other wait staff was friendlier than at Omakase or Maruya.\n\nThe space is small but fully wheelchair accessible including the bathroom.

And yes, the price tag is quite hefty ($95 for the Omakase) but it was beyond worth it for how fresh, delicious, and flavorful every single item was. The attention to detail was impeccable. \n\nWe were seated by the sushi bar for optimum viewing pleasure and ordered the omakase along with a bottle of sauvignon blanc to share (paired perfectly with all of the raw fish). The omakase included ~13 pieces of raw sushi, each one perfectly curated to the last detail. Our favorites were the fatty tuna, the uni, the salmon, the unagi rice cracker and the tamagoyaki (not part of the omakase but since we are fatties, we also ordered a la carte after the omakase...). I might just go back for 5 orders of that fatty tuna - it was just that incredible! \n\nThe only downside - don't expect to be incredibly full with the omakase. We were still a bit hungry afterwards and had to order some a la carte pieces and dessert (the green tea creme brulee was off the charts!).

I made a reservation two days before dining there and had no problem getting the reservation. There is only one set Omakase menu which is $95 per person. After you finish the omakase set, you have the option to order from the a la carte menu. The a la carte menu features sushi or sashimi (one piece per order) and ranges from $6.50-$14.50.\n\nWhen we arrived at 5:15PM, there were already a couple people dining at the sushi bar. We were seated at a regular table. (I suggest sitting at the sushi bar for a better experience). Because we had a flight to catch later in the evening, we didn't take 2-3 hours dining there. In fact, we were out of the restaurant by 6:30pm. So, it is possible to go through the entire Omakase in an hour! The timing of the food is pretty good. Once they take your plate away, the next plate comes on no more than 5 minutes later. As for the fish, I have to admit that I've had better \"melt in yo mouth\" sashimi at other restaurants. The more outstanding items were the \"Zuke Chutoro\" - seared bluefin fatty tuna & the A5 Wagyu beef. If you love the A5 wagyu beef and want more, order it from the a la carte menu for $12. I had the truffle miso soup which tasted just like miso soup.. didn't really taste the truffle at all and that was 1 course. The BBQ unagi croquette was masked by the mushroom and potatoes, I didn't taste the unagi at all. For $95 pp, the menu served very little food. You'll probably need to order from the a la carte menu to get full. \n\nAs for overall ambiance and experience, it was just average. The place is simple and modern.

I could of drank an entire tea kettle of this because it was that good.\n\nAt first I was disappointed with their small fish selection but after giving it some thought, Chef Kusakabe's prep is truly unique and unlike anything I've ever had. For example, the striped jack was infused with just enough smoke to give it a deliciously smoky flavor without ruining the integrity of the fish. I'm not one for deep fried sushi but the crispy sesame oyster sushi was genius. It was encapsulated with a carblicious, deep fried crispy sesame and shari exterior while the oyster maintained its raw state. \n\nOther favorites were the chutoro and otoro, both of which that were luxuriously fatty. Can't forget about the A5 wagyu which was torched just enough to start melting some of the intense marbling. It was like beef buttah but Akiko's ridiculous prep with truffle oil and shaved black truffle will always be my favorite.\n\nI saw ankimo (off the menu) being cut and I had to get my foie gras of the sea fix. It was good but doesn't hold a candle to Ino's. \n\nMy least favorite nigiri was the tamago. It had a nice sweetness to it but totally lacked any soft fluffiness. Nothing beats Tani's tamago. I love soymilk and was excited for the soymilk ice cream. While it was beautifully presented in a flower shaped cone, the consistency was very granular and more like a sherbet. \n\nIf you're a sake/shochu drinker, I highly recommend the Crystal Dragon Ginjo (6 oz - $26): http://bit.ly/1oWa6Qu which was incredibly smooth with a subtle melon finish. \n\nService was polite as you would expect from most traditional Japanese restaurants (Ino's excluded). The omakase dinner is a slow paced meal so expect to be here for at least 2 hours. \n\nMetered street parking was easily found before 6 pm. The nearest garage is 2 blocks away at the Embarcadero Garage ($3/hour after 5 pm). \n\nAll in all, a pretty solid grand opening day but I would like to see a larger and more exotic fish selection in order for it to be solid 5 star experience. \n\nBack to that \"I pay, he puts out\".

I've worked in the hospitality industry for close to 10 years and I greatly appreciate the art of food and beverage. Looking forward to sharing this experience with a visitor from out of town, I was told to arrive early so that we get to pick a seat at the bar. It also states its a first come first serve bases. Well, that was not the case. My guest and I were the first to show up to the 5pm reservation, we waited outside for 30 minutes and then there was another couple who arrived. Being the first people there, the host sat the other couple at the bar and went to sit me and my guest at a table, I told her we had requested to be seated at the bar and that I was told to arrive early to be seated at the bar. She did not listen and just stated that for the time being this was the only seat because everyone else had older reservation and followed with a response of \"Thanks for your flexibility\". The experience was horrible and quite honestly you feel robbed. Starting off with poor accommodations really ruined the experience for me. The presentation of the sushi was beautifully done but the whole course seemed to be a really expensive appetizer. I've had fresher sushi in Alameda. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone, it's a scam and the only one gaining something out of it is the owners. Their reservation process is also a scam,they hold your credit card information, if you show up you pay what the menu cost( which varies) and if you don't show up they will charge you either way. All I wanted to do was leave and couldn't because they would charge me either way, so I had to sit through a very unpleasant experience. The reason why I'm giving ONE STAR is because of the impressive toilet seat in the restroom. Who would have thought a $900 dollar toilet seat could make a poor experience better....", "author": "Mindy G."}

That being said, Kusakabe definitely is one of the better places for sushi in SF. I think this is one of the places I've been most excited about trying in recent memory. It did not disappoint.\n\nI visited Kusakabe with a couple of friends and we were fortunately seated at the bar. In my opinion, the experience of an omakase meal is maximized when you are eating at the sushi bar, as opposed to at a table.\n\nRather than bore you about my opinions of each dish I consumed, I'll just say the staff are really accommodating and attentive. The chef that was preparing the majority of the meal asked us if we had any preferences at the get go so that he could tailor our experience based on that (for example, a friend didn't like ikura, so he excluded that from one of the dishes during our meal). Since we couldn't decide between the o-toro or the wagyu beef, we decided to get both, and also added an ankimo a la carte at the conclusion of our meal. I couldn't resist but be super basic (like, super super basic) and take photos of each of the dishes we were served.\n\nAlthough there was a seemingly intoxicated customer who was acting quite immaturely and kept on pestering our party along with other restaurant patrons with offensive behavior and remarks, the staff were responsive and professional in handling the situation, which I definitely appreciated. We were still able to enjoy the meal in spite of this customer's antics, so that was definitely a positive.\n\nWhile it is pricey, you'll get a fine dining experience that is well worth it - and the quality of the food is perhaps some of the best you can find in terms of Japanese food/sushi in SF. I'd definitely recommend Kusakabe and think it's one of the best sushi experiences I've had in SF and in the Bay Area overall.", "author": "Jared L."}

At first I was disappointed with the amount of food we got for the price point, but the more I thought about the meal and experience I realized how much thought went into each course and my appreciation for Kusakabe grew. For instance, for one of our first pieces of nigiri, a small mint leaf was placed between our halibut and rice with a touch of lime (? I think) and the mix of all the flavors worked so well together. Also, some of the other nigiri was lightly seared just to give the fish a slight smokey flavor. \n\nSome of my favorites from the night were the fatty toro and the crispy fried tofu with crab. We ended the meal with the matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Sometimes when you have a matcha green tea flavored dessert, the matcha flavor is either too strong or the dessert is too sweet. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e here wasn't too sweet and the matcha flavor wasn't overpowering, definitely a perfect end to an amazing dinner. \n\nThe dinner took exactly 2 hours and all the courses were timed perfectly. I also appreciate how Chef Kusakabe himself served everyone the nigiri.", "author": "Cindy A."}

Kusakabe was recommended to me as \"the best omakase in San Francisco\" and easily exceeded that bar. To start, I love Japanese food. By that I mean I am a voracious consumer of sushi/sashimi, yakitori, ramen, and basically all food things Japanese. Kusakabe rocked, pure and simple. It was probably my favorite omakase meal since my first experience at O Ya in Boston many years ago. \n\nKusakabe's omakase is served in the kaiseki style and, for the quality of the meal, is priced quite affordably at $95pp. There are a total of eleven courses, with an option to order additional items a la carte at the end of the meal. The entire experience was like a culinary symphony of thoughtfully orchestrated flavors, textures, and even temperatures - beautifully balanced and never in excess. Each bite of nigiri was delicate and nuanced in flavor. The thick slices of sashimi were fresh and melted in your mouth. There is also a very harmonious transition between the cold and warm dishes. Some of the courses that were particularly memorable included the zuke chutoro, the wagyu beef, and the hokkaido uni. \n\nI also loved the ambiance at Kusakabe. The space is intimate and inviting, with an understated elegance. Service was impeccable, on par with what you would expect at a high end Japanese establishment. The chef was warm and friendly. He was approachable when engaging with guests but never intrusive.  At the end of the meal, the staff served delicious complimentary desserts to us for our birthday.

Do not expect to walk out of here feeling completely full and satisfactory with the amount of food they serve unless you entire another meal's worth of sushi a la carte (aka either you need to shell out about $250-300/person for a very full and satisfying meal, or naturally eat portions the size of a tennis ball, or you might possibly need a second dinner). \n\nI've eaten at sushi places from the best in LA (Sasabune and Sugar fish) and Japan (Tsukiji Fish market) and the list goes on. I can't say that the quality here is beyond what I've had before or up to par. But I can say, that it is close to par and given that I haven't been able to find a satisfactory sushi restaurant in the Bay Area (still need to try Sushi Ran), this is the best sushi restaurant I've had in the Bay thus far. (And don't tell me to try ICHI 'cause I have and it was stupid and ridiculous and I hated it) \n\nThe sushi here really is unique because most of the fish here aren't just slabs of fish, they're more creative than that. And the few pieces that are just slabs of fish are the best in quality and unique fishes that you wouldn't normally find in other sushi restaurants. \n\nThe most memorable of the night were: \n-smoked Golden Eye Snapper: had this a la carte, but it was the most unique combinations and complex layers of flavors ever. \n-A5 Wagyu nigiri: The softest, fattiest, most texturally pleasing piece of (uncooked) meat you will ever eat in your life. \n-Tuna marinated in soy sauce (then torched): very creative and unique piece of sushi (the date really loved this one) \n\nAs for the miso soup, I definitely preferred the summer truffle mushroom miso soup over the duck meatball because it was lighter in broth and closer to miso soup than the duck meatball (the duck fat made the duck meatball soup on the greasier side) but nonetheless, both were good and you can order one of each to try both! \n\nDefinitely will be back again when I can afford to cash out $300-400 on dinner (that won't keep me full)", "author": "Judy B."}

There were four dessert options and I wanted to try them all, but we decided on the soy ice cream with monaka and kuromitsu and the yuzu and shiso sorbet.

Also be sure to mention that you are celebrating your birthday because they provide the dessert for the birthday celebrant on the house. I got a sweet potato ice cream which was really good and he got a Yuzu ice cream. After our courses we even ordered braised octopus, smoked eel and uni.  $400  later we were finally done. This place ain't cheap but the price is worth it for the impeccable food and service they provide. No wonder within the 3 months they opened they got their 1st Michelin star.

A friend of mine had mentioned Kusakabe a while back, and so when we needed a catch up dinner they picked this magical place and made reservations a month ahead of time online. \n\nThe decor is beautiful and modern. Looking into the restaurant there is a section up front with tables and then a long bar where omakase would be served. \n\nWe of course decided to partake in the omakase- and honestly they put the OH-MAI in omakase. I now see why this year they earned their first Michelin Star. \n\nI ordered a beer to go with my meal and then it began. Course after course of deliciousness. Our young sushi chef also patiently waited for me to take a snap of each course, before explaining what the item was. I would notice the mental sweat drop forming each time he'd have to wait, but then he just laughed when nonchalantly mentioned that this was not the first time he'd seen women do this at restaurants. \n\nOver the course of dinner we'd gab with chef about going back to Tokyo and how he saves up at least 10k every time just to eat the latest new foods. 10k for just food during a month long trip. That's a lot of noms y'all. \n\nThe final course came and you could choose between seared A1 waygu and super noms otoro. I actually picked the waygu and nommy nom noms it was indeed.

And up until the first bite of nigiri, I was skeptical. \n\nTo start, we were given a cup of kelp tea, which definitely wasn't a favorite. Sea-y (yes, that's a word... now) and tart, it was a strange combination that my tastebuds wanted no part of. So, once I washed away the flavor with some sake, I was ready to eat.\n\nThe prix fixe menu's not set in stone, so don't be intimidated.\n\nEvery. Single. Nigiri. Was delicious. There wasn't a single one that I chewed quickly and had to wash down with water. You know what I mean. No. Nothing of the sort. I told the waitress at the beginning that I loved salmon (sake) sashimi, so that Chef Nori can accommodate to that style and flavor. The boyfriend opted for eel (unagi), so a good deal of the fish was buttery, creamy, and BBQ/smoky-flavored. Exactly what we love.\n\nWe also opted for the sake pairing which went well with each menu item, but didn't blow my mind. I'd say that's optional, if you're interested.\n\nFor the final course, if you're trying to choose between the bluefin fatty tuna (toro) or the marbled beef (wagyu), I'd say go for the toro.

The highlights for me were the fatty tuna, uni from north Japan (not to sound like a snob, but the Santa Barbara unit doesn't compare), and the les petit plats. Also, it's more expensive but recommend everyone to pick the grand omakase $150 for 25 items. The couple next to us got the regular omakase and they definitely felt like they missed out. Anyways the real purpose of this review is to really give props to the wait staff and just overall service of the restaurant. Not once did I need to flag a waiter down and my drinks (beer and tea) were constantly  being poured and asked if we wanted more. Echigo beer was great. Everyone had a smile on their face and the sushi chefs were super helpful and polite.  Last but not least is the toilet. It's got one of those future toilets from Japan which includes a seat warmer, push button seat up/down, and a booty wetter. 5 stars just for the toilet itself lol. I highly higggghly recommend kusakabe!", "author": "Jennifer P."}

I logged onto Reserve (great iPhone app that does what you assume it does) and made a same-day reservation at Kusakabe, which I've heard isn't easy. There are two seatings per night : 5:15p and 8p, so we opted for the later option. They have an a la carte menu but the per person minimum is quite high, so everybody does the omakase. For $95 per person, you get something like 12 courses of super fresh, flavorful, eclectic, carefully prepared sushi, sashimi, and other stuff (like soup). It was just fantastic. The service was impeccable (wound up leaving 25%), which was to be expected since Kusakabe has a Michelin star !\n\nAt the end, you're given the choice between toro and A5 wagyu beef. Naturally, we did both (as I'm aware most people do), for the a la carte price upcharge of $12. Now, I figured, since we were already there, I may as well order some items off of the a la carte menu since you can't just stop by and order a couple of things without doing the omakase. So I got a couple of hand rolls, to try some things I've never had before. Between the toro, bluefin tuna, white salmon (fantastic), and others, I can confidently say this is the best sushi I've ever had. And well worth the price. The check for 2, with some extra items, and a big tip, was around $350. Not too bad considering what you get.", "author": "Chris H."}

You expect wasabi and soy with traditional sushi but usually don't see it with the high end sushi places.  Kusakabe seems to cater to the tourist market with tuna soaked in soy as their \"signature\" dish.  They spend a lot of time explaining the dishes and how to eat them - which is great for those that aren't familiar with traditional Japanese dishes.  The fish was fresh and they had great choices but in the end it's just an \"insert whatever fish here\" presentation.  With omakase they have a chance for so much more.", "author": "Brad S."}

I am talking about the entire quality of omakase for it's price (in SF) along with it's service.\n\nWe dined here a couple weeks after they had their soft opening so they were still trying to figure out some kinks.  So I originally had a reservation at 8pm and they called me to ask if I was okay to change it to 8:30pm.  That was fine, I just had to eat a little snack before since 8:30pm is considered a pretty late dinner for me.  \n\nAt 8:40pm or so, we got seated at the bar, in front of one of the sushi chefs Ken.  He and other staff were friendly, place was clean, but no purse hooks under the counter :(\nKen introduced each food item while serving us and I enjoyed looking at him prepare our food.  Every item was fresh and tasted decadent.  Just looking back at the photos make my mouth water.  We also order extra sushi from the a la carte menu after omakase to try, which also tasted great.  The couple next to us arrive later and so we got to witness how the chef \"made up the lost time\" to get them caught up with the omakase menu.\n\nI am pretty sure if I go back again now, they will have ironed out the kinks with their reservation times and the experience would be perfect!", "author": "Iris H."}

Our smiling waitress, Hiromi  (who is also a sake expert) making sure we were treated like royalty.  A truly elegant dinner. \n\nWe sat with the owner/chef Chef Nori which was just great fun.  We loved watching him make us a perfect dinner and talking to him about his food!  It is such a personal experience.  We have sat with Chef Ken too which is also so special!  \n\nWe arrived promptly at 5pm and sat there for 3 full delicious hours.  We had incredible sushi at Koo in the Sunset the night before so normally we would not have wanted sushi again the next night but after the first bite, we craved more!   Again, all the preparations are so good.  The fish is so fresh.  We found though the preps add so much flavor they did not overwhelm the delicate fish.  \n\nThe first 3 nigiri, Zuke chutoro that is cured in soy sauce, 2nd marinated hirami in Konbu with it liver on top with lime zest, a squeeze of lemon juice and soy and then the 3rd nigiri is Konbu smoked katsuo with ponzu all were so good the night was off with a memorable start.   I can still taste the intense smokey flavor of the katsuo that gave way to the rich flavor of the fish.  It was delicious.  The Chef explained only the outside of the fish is smoked so the interior keeps its natural flavor. \n\nA sashimi bowl followed miso soup and a beautiful plate of 5 small bites.  First was a tomato with tomato ice which was intensely tomato flavored, then Kona crab, a perfect Higoku oyster with a bit of caviar, blue fin negi toro and bite of shrimp.\n\nAfter B.B.Q. Unagi and matsutate croquette and 3 more perfect nigiri the sushi finale of toro or grade 5 Miyazaki wagyu beef was eaten with delight. We always do both!  LOL\n\nFrom the after omakase menu though quite full, we decided to try the gyoku, a fresh lobster omelet; another smoked katsuo.\n\nAnd then an off menu fresh not frozen unagi seared with a crispy skin.  It was just delicious. \n\nUnder the guidance of Hiromi, we splurged on some special sake, Dassai \"Centrifuge\" Migaki23 Junmai Daiginjo which we loved a bit too much. \n\nDessert of a light yuzu sorbet and a chestnut creme brulee were just a small sweet bite after such a full dinner.

YES PLEASE (whilst my wallet cries). \n\nThe fish are incredibly fresh, and each sushi has a distinct flavor, so you get to explore a wide palate. In addition, some of the courses are imaginative and the aesthetics effectively match the taste. My favorite dishes were probably the salmon bou-zushi style (the rice was a combination of different rice grains), the chutoro, the agedashi tofu (the tofu is fried with a fluffy but crunch outer covering and it comes in a savory sauce/soup), and the otoro. The shrimp temari was also very adorable; it came in the shape of a ball! \n\nFor a la carte after the omakase is completed, we also tried the squid, hokkaido uni, and flying fish sashimi topped with its roe. After sushi, we got the matcha creme brulee and soy milk ice cream for dessert. The soy milk ice cream came between two wafer-like cookies, and could be eaten as a sandwich; light but nicely sweet. The matcha creme brulee, on the other hand, was probably the best I have ever had, part of the reason being the matcha flavor.

If God came down from heaven to get sushi THIS IS WHERE HE WOULD GO (If he could get a reservation). Yes... it's that freaking good! Chef Mitsunori Kusakabe is a true visionary, I have ate several of his restaurants and have been wanting to try this place for quite some time, but sadly when I come to the bay it's usually with very little notice which prevents me from being able to make a reservation in time (YOU NEED A RESERVATION). \n\nI was having a rough day and just needed something to go right today. I was tired, cold, angry and hungry and just needed a good meal to cheer me up. I took a chance even knowing the extreme difficulty of attaining a last minute reservation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-31", "description": "Dining at Kusakabe is truly an experience. I have few other meals to use for comparison, but Kusakabe's simplistic omakase offering leaves your experience entirely up to the chef, who has crafted the menu based on seasonality and quality of ingredients. Each guest must first complete the $95 omakase menu, and then there is the choice to order more dishes a la carte. My boyfriend and I came for his birthday dinner and were seated at the sushi bar for the full experience. \n\nThe first course was a kelp tea, which reminded me of a light seaweed soup. The light umami flavors were the perfect way to cleanse your palate for the meal to come. The next course was a sushi prelude, which included four different cuts of nigiri based on both the chef's choice and your personal preferences. Each piece is served individually, with both wasabi and soy sauce painted and melded into the nigiri for a complete bite. My favorite of the prelude was the seared fatty tuna, which had the delicious charcoal flavor of the sear paired with the rich buttery flavor of the fish. The next course was sashimi in ice, which featured fresh raw scallops and tuna. The presentation was beautiful, and I was extremely surprised at how fresh the scallop was. The soup course was next, which was an umami broth with a crab and tofu cake. I could drink bowls and bowls of this soup- the flavor was amazing and the fresh pieces of crab added a nice brininess to the bowl. The hassan course followed, and this was by far my favorite. The long platter featured five small bites- cucumber and ice fish, tomago and unagi, fresh oyster, tuna nigiri, and then a crispy soft shell crab fried with rice crackers on the outside. The crab was the best, with the rice cracker breading adding an extra element of flavor to the typical fried crunch. Next, the hot course was a miso glazed halibut on top of a garbanzo bean puree. This dish was somehow the heartiest of the night, despite the fact that the halibut was extremely delicate and flakey. The sushi finale then follows, with another three pieces of nigiri. My favorite here was the cherry salmon, a particularly fragrant and bright salmon with a slightly sweet flavor. For the final course, you're given a choice of the wagyu beef or otoro. I went with the otoro, which was the perfect last bite and testament to the quality of the ingredients and food that Kusakabe puts out. \n\nMy boyfriend was given a free birthday dessert, which was a shiso sorbet. The clean flavors of the shiso left our palates light at the end of the meal, and I couldn't have asked for a better dessert. Kusakabe is a must-try in San Francisco, with few other sushi restaurants that offer something similar. The entire ordeal lasts about 2 hours with just the omakase, so schedule a block of time to just truly enjoy amazing Japanese cuisine!", "author": "Ashley T."}

Aside from that, the only other super fancy meal I've had was Coi in Little Italy. \n\nOk, so with that said, Kusakabe is pretty awesome. I can't remember exactly how many plates, but I'm thinking there were almost 10 courses which included small izakaya style delights, creative small dishes, FREEESSSSSHHHH nigiri, a light and fluffy soup, and a choice of A5 Wagyu or Otoro as the finisher. \n\nI wish I could eat at places like this more - its soo fun to be taken through a journey of food where everything just goes well together. I even got pretty full towards the last few courses, but the food was light enough to stomach and not get that shit feeling when you force yourself to eat the last couple pizza slices cuz you dont wanna waste it.\n\nThe fish was sooo fresh - perfectly prepared. I don't wanna hype, cuz I hate hyping it but there were times that I would eat some of the courses and I didn't wanna chew or swallow it.

Similar to that feeling you get when you first walk into EDC and see the cosmic meadow for the first time - I didn't want the moments to end. (^_^)\n\nAnyway, if you've been to Jiro's or his son's place, don't expect the same environment. This place is very casual and relaxed. The staff is very friendly and accomodating. And honestly, I think the price is right where it should be - I actually was expecting to pay alot more. \n\nI'd love to go here again, and again, and maybe again too. Awesome restaurant. Just thinking about it makes me wanna go there right now.", "author": "Jeff L."}

Came here for birthday celebration for wife.  Made reservation for 5:15 PM on a Saturday, and we arrived at 5:05 PM, and the restaurant was almost half full already.  We were immediately seated at the sushi bar as requested and were served a very delicious kombu soup immediately.  Now they have two different price Omakase- regular Omakase for $98 and Grand Omakase for $165.  We chose the grand omakase as it was a celebration.  My previous review is enthusiastically seconded with our latest experience - each piece of sushi and other servings (soup, sashimi, etc) was a work of art, wonderfully tasteful both to the eyes and in the mouth! They have a good selection of sake (unfortunately, though, the sake I liked before, Crystal Dragon, was no longer available), wine, and beer.  I had the Ichigo rice beer, for which I recently developed a taste, which went wonderfully with the meal and quite a bargain at $9 a bottle. For my wife's birthday, they served a complimentary refreshing sorbet with a candle!  The total tab with tip was $500, and we consider it to be worth every penny, and we would nominate Kusakabe for two additional Michelin stars to their current one!\n\nReview in 2016\n\nThis was our third time at Kusakabe, one of the best Japanese restaurants in the country.  We had a special guest and the three of us were seated at the end of the counter, and we were served by a younger colleague of the main chef.  The sushi was as usual outstanding, and the other dishes (sashimi, soup) were very good, though we remembered the last time when the contrast in temperature and texture of one of the dishes was just outstanding.  Service was as usual excellent.  The noise level at this end of the counter near the tables was a little louder than we usually like.  We will come again.\n\nFirst Review in 2014\n\nEach piece of sushi, hand made and immediately served,  is a work of art, the flavors bursting in the mouth in symphonic celebration.  And sashimi, served on shaved ice, had such clean and delicate taste that it was a discovery even for our palates which are quite accustomed to eating sashimi and sushi.  Kusakabe serves omakase ($95 per person) followed by an a la carte menu.  With sake and a couple of more sushi from the a la carte menu, our dinner cost about $350 with tip, and considered it to be worth every penny.  A truly memorable experience", "author": "Hoyle L."}

For perspective, I'll compare Kusakabe to Omakase, which I went a week earlier.\n\nKusakabe Pros\n- Considerate sushi chef who asked if I had any dietary restrictions, and what fishes I liked or disliked... Best of all, he accommodated my wishes to minimize soy sauce and salt usage, so I can taste the fish.  \n- Well-thought out sushi kaiseki where the fish flavors are brought out. Examples are:\nhotate (scallop) was sweet and simple.  \nYuan marinated Hokkaido cod with its own buttery/milky Shirako and Satsuma Imo\n- Open Table reservations\n- Better value for your money than Omakase ($95 vs $150).\n\nKusakabe Cons\n- Servers could be more attentive (pour tea, sake etc)\n\nOmakase have attentive servers.

I waited two long months to get a table here and fasted from sushi for two weeks prior to my reservation date since I really wanted to satiate my hunger for sushi.  I had incredibly high hopes yet once again, a Michelin star restaurant has not only crushed my dreams but left me $300 in the hole and my stomach growling.\n\nI may be one of the few diners that didn't fall head over heels for this place.  Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of the omakase served but for the price I paid, I would have expected to be completely full and satisfied.  My boyfriend and I each went with the omakase and as each course came out, we were hoping that the portions would increase. We waited until the very last course to see how we felt and decided not to order a la carte and tried the two unique desserts instead.  We ordered sweet potato ice cream (unique but very light in flavor) & green tea chiffon cake with azuki bean paste (way too much matcha and not enough sugar so it ended up just tasting bitter and bland).  \n\nI have no problems dropping a few hundred for a good, satisfying meal but this restaurant left completely feeling hungry and ripped off!  I forgot to mention I drank two personal-size pots of tea with my meal, which I usually never ever have liquids during a meal since it fills me up too quickly.

Almost.\n\nThere is an effort made to flavor the rice, but it just comes off as rough and unrefined.  There's an unpleasant edge to it.  Comparing it to the rice at 15 East in NYC is interesting - because 15 East occasionally (well, often) ended up with rice that was too forward, too in your face.  But even though it was almost too much, it still tasted pretty good.  You got the sense of what they were trying to do.  Just it went too far in the flavor profile.  It had personality.\n\nBut Kusakabe, it's not like they go too far or not far enough in flavor (e.g., lacking personality like Wako), but the direction of the flavor is just off. I don't know if there was a bitterness to it?  Hard to put my finger on it.  But it just had a slightly abrasive personality, and the issue was still there even after they switched to a new vat of rice, midway through my meal.\n\nFish preparations try to be too fancy for their own good.  What's up with the zuke being aburi'd?  Why marinate something if you're going to torch it?  Or vice-versa?  When I asked, I was told that it's because zuke can often be tough.  I guess that's true.  But out of the dozens of times I've had amazing zuke in Japan, I can't recall once thinking it was tough and needed the torch.  \n\nStill, had a few pieces that were quite good.

Quality: while i am not expert by any means for fish, i know that i shouldnt be getting sinewy pieces in my wagyu and my toro.  The taste of the wagyu was good unless all i was left with was the sinew.  Very delicious taste. \n5. Menu size: the course was a little smaller than i expected, granted they tried to pack variety into the meal.  1 dish would consist of a single soup but then it would be followed by a medley of fish, from egg yolk with wagyu peices, small oyster with caviar, baby eel, etc. this would be followed by the a la carte menu with sushi prices going from 8.50 to 14.50 with uni being the 14.50 option. \n\ntl;dr: 2/5 because of quality of food, ambiance, and because (partly my own fault) of my expectations of the Michellin star.", "author": "justin c."}

I like the doing away with dipping your sushi in the soy sauce altogether, as the chefs brush the soy on each individual piece of sushi before serving it to you. I also love that it is highly recommended that you eat the sushi using your hands. The quality of the fish was sublime, and it's a little off topic but the ceramics they use for each platter are incredibly beautiful. I came here with a friend for her birthday and we got treated very well, with a delicious complimentary dessert for the birthday girl.\n\nSo why no 5 stars? I personally felt that some of the dishes that were in the omakase weren't necessary and brought the standard down a little for me, considering the price tag of $95. The Hassun course, of the chef's selection of petit four for our table, had the Shigoku oyster topped with caviar. My companion and I strongly felt that the caviar did not really add to the oyster. One of the other selections from the petit four was an anago dragon maki. For an establishment like Kusakabe, I was not expecting to have maki that seemed like a slightly upgraded version of any other restaurant's sushi. \n\nCan I say it was the best sushi I've ever had in my life?

Being a lover of Japanese food, we decided to give it a try (especially given that Maruya, our other choice, had lost two of its main chefs). We came here during dinner on a Saturday and the restaurant was pretty packed. The omasake was filled with extremely fresh fish. One thing I will say though: the server asked us for our favorite fish, which we responded salmon and yellowtail (sorry for being unoriginal), but we weren't served with any of them! However, there was ALOT of blue fin tuna. I love o-toro and chutoro as much as the next person, but may have preferred to have more variation of other fish (sorry again! I know, first world problem right?). But regardless, the food and its quality is top-notch so it wasn't even an issue. One thing they served that did stood out to us: a crab leg that's coated in crispy rice. That bite was heavenly! I wish I could've had seconds! After finishing the omasake, we were given the choice to order more off the a la cart menu. However, being a fan of dessert, I opted to go straight to dessert, and ordered one of each dessert (there were only 3 so I avoided being seen as the crazy dessert lady). The dessert was HEAVENLY, especially the sweet potato dessert. I really wanted to order another one, but decided not to over-bloat myself. Overall, an A+ experience. Definitely would come again!", "author": "Sharon L."}

Just looking at the pictures made me reminisce of my trip to the Tsujiki fish market years ago.  Maybe I have bad luck, but when eating Sushi in the States I often find myself staring at some dish that resembles pink jello when I go to other restaurants.  Not at Kusakabe though.  No way.  \n\nEvery dish is perfectly plated and presented.  The sushi fresh and glistening.  The service relaxed, but attentive.  The atmosphere was was interesting given the small real estate.  I hate sitting shoulder to shoulder a couple feet apart with the patrons next to me, each of us overhearing each others conversations.  That, however, is often hard to avoid in this city.  \n\nInterestingly enough, the tables was a little long, making it slightly difficult to speak without announcing everything to the tables next to us.  If I had to do it again, I would probably try the bar.  At least there, one would get a view of the chefs at work and one would be able to turn to his/her dinner companion for private conversation.\n\nMy favorite dish was one of the first ones -- the Zuke (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce).  If you follow 7x7 Big Eats, you will know that Kusakabe is on that list for their A5 Wagyu Nigiri.  At the end of the meal, you get the choice of either the Toro (fatty tuna) or the Wagyu.  I opted to spring for both, adding one a la carte.  To my surprise, the Wagyu was good, but I actually preferred the Toro.  For dessert,  I would recommend the Yuzu sorbet (small portion).  For drinks, all their sake seem to be on point and their Koshihikari Echigo Beer was quite smooth.  \n\nDefinitely would recommend, but be prepared to shell out serious dough if you want the true experience.", "author": "Bert N."}

There were clearly several regulars dining the same night. I chose the standard Omakase which was mostly nigiri sushi with some kaiseki style courses. In summary, it was delicious and some of the better sushi I have had in the USA. There is significant reliance on citrus flavors (yuzu, grated lime) in the preparations.\n\nI deducted a star because a nigiri piece I added a la carte had dry, par-boiled, and poorly vinegared rice. I believe this piece was prepared by an assistant chef and feel sorry for his diners that night. Also, the finale toro piece was cut with tendon intact leaving a distinct chew to the piece.

It is a dining experience I will remember for the rest of my life--along with four or so other memorable meals I've had in Valencia, Napa, SF, and Florence.  It's the first sushi restaurant in SF to receive a Michelin star, and Chef Kusakabe deserves it for his originality and meticulous attention to detail.\n\nThere is one choice on the menu, the omakase, which is well worth the $95 fixed price.  The items are listed on a sheet of paper by your place setting.  One single piece of each item is placed on your plate.  There are some 12 or so pieces total.  Each one is a delicate work of handcrafted perfection, with a variety of subtle flavors that merit paused appreciation and wonder.  Then, as the omakase winds toward a grand finale of your choice (either bluefin toro or wagyu beef) a nigiri menu is brought forth and other individual delicacies become available for your selection.  These include thee different kinds of uni: an outstandingly smooth one from Santa Barbara (where more than half the world's uni originates), a deliciously delicate short-spine variety from Japan, and a third deep-sea variety which I reserved in eager anticipation for my next visit.\n\nChef Kusakabe stands behind the sushi bar personally crafting each piece with the assistance of five other chefs. The attention he gives to each cut of the knife, each dab and brush of sauce, and each stroke of flame from his torch is worth watching.  Sit at the bar and watch.  It will greatly enhance your experience.\n\nSome of the memorable items included zuke chutoro, Wagyu beef, striped jack, and Japanese red snapper.  The seasoning delicately enhanced the flavor of the fish without detracting from it.  Wow!", "author": "Zeus M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-18", "description": "I'm not going to hold myself out there as an expert, but in my opinion, Kusakabe has served me perhaps the best sushi that I've ever had.\n\nThe one thing you need to know about this place before making reservations is that you'll be required to participate in an Omakase (Chef's tasting) menu at the price of $95. (You can order additional pieces later on in the dinner, but  pure a la carte is not an option). Compared to other omakases I've had, this is perhaps the most expensive, but I believe it's certainly worth it.\n\nEach prepared nigiri, represents to me the quintessential bite of sushi - the rice and fish are in perfect proportion, the rice had the perfect texture, each piece was seasoned well, and the fish is just so luxurious it basically melts in your mouth. The highlights for me were the Katsuo, Zuke Chutoro, and the Wagyu Beef pieces.\n\nThe other bites kind of left a little bit to be desired as they were sort of one note and not quite as lively or bright. The standout, though, was the raw octopus with persimmon which was a really tasty dish with the contrasting textures of persimmon and octopus pairing quite nicely with the sweetness of both complimenting each other very well. \n\nHowever, I have to deduct a star based on their inability to accommodate our reservation. As a Michelin Star establishment, they should be able to keep the reservation at the scheduled time. We were not able to get seated for over 45 minutes after our scheduled reservation, and even that took a little bit more prodding by the girlfriend to get done (Even though I'm the lawyer in the relationship, she's better at negotiating tough situations).\n\nWe were given 10% off our bill at the end of the day, which isn't insignificant given the cost of admission, but I would've still appreciated a timely reservation more.\n\nI hope to try this place again and hopefully a future reservation will be held up to the scheduled time.\n\nAlmost a perfect experience.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

Sushi Ran is known to have some of the best sushi in the Bay Area and you are considered quite the lucky duck if you can snag a seat at the sushi bar for an omakase. but things have changed. for better or worse, who knows. maybe unbeknownst to the general population of eaters but definitely noted by the frequenters of the popular sushi restaurant, Kusakabe has left to open a restaurant with his own name. he serves one omakase kaiseki style menu ($95/ 8 courses) each night with the option to add nigiri, sashimi, simple maki and dessert a la carte to follow. the space is sleek and simple yet inviting once greeted by a host or server. while there are some tables near the front of the restaurant, it provides as a sort of waiting area until your seats at the sushi bar are ready. they don't want anybody to miss out on experiencing watching the chefs at work. \n\n\nfrom Sushi Ran Kusakabe brought with him Chef Ken Ngai, who we were happy to be entertained by. he created our simplistic sushi masterpieces for the evening while also making us feel welcome and playfully bantering with us or our neighbor guests. the sushi was incredible! beautifully simple, fresh and colorful. the hot dishes were also very good and adequately gave us breaks between raw fish dishes. if you truly appreciate good sushi, i absolutely recommend this place. it's only been open for about two months now and has not had very much press or advertising yet has received a lot of buzz. get your reservation sooner rather than later or you'll likely begin to see a month long wait list!", "author": "Regina C."}

After a somewhat disasterous dinner at Pabu the night before, our fingers were crossed as we head to Kusakabe.\n\nWe had the earliest reservation at 5 pm and we were the only ones there.  So, we had Nori-san's full attention for about 30 minutes until others starting to arrive.  I didn't really care about the kelp tea as many others did.  Just by looking at the rice, I already know it's not the kind I like.  I think it's the type of rice he uses.  Maybe we were there too early, the rice was still a bit warm when served.  I feel the sushi had too many accoutrements on them.  A dash of this and a sprinkle of that.  Some were overpowering the taste of the fish.  The duck dumpling miso soup was good.  But, the bowl was really shallow and you can't tell by looking at it.  I did not like the crispy rice cracker tofu.  It was oily.  And, once you pour the konbu dashi broth over, it made it soggy as well.  For the sushi finale, you get to pick between toro or grade A5 wagyu.  We wanted them both so it's an add-on.  We also each added the $14 a piece kaisui uni.  The uni was divine!  The ingredients they use are definitely top notch.  But, you get what you pay for, right!?  Not sure why the dessert is not included with the omakase.  Anyway, dessert is not their forte.  The top of their maccha creme brulee was not even caramelized hard enough like it should be.  Boo, creme brulee is one of my favorite dessert.\n\nOverall, it was an ok experience.  I feel the dining atmosphere was a little intense and stuck-up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-20", "description": "Hands down this was the best service experience I have ever had! \n\nA little back story first. My boyfriend has been recently diagnosed with having a lot of food allergies. We're talking everything from eggs to gluten to onions, potatoes, plus many many more which makes eating out often very difficult for us. Sushi has been our go to thing since it avoids a lot of these things. A few days before our reservation, the restaurant called to confirm our reservation but also took the extra step to see if there were any food allergies. I gave them the extensive list and they read it back to me just to make sure that they had everything correct. Awesome service before we even walked through the door.\n\nCome the night of our reservation, we got there a little early so we sat down and I had a glass of wine while waiting or our seat at the counter. There isn't a lot of seating available which makes a much more intimate setting which was really nice. The place didn't get loud so you didn't have to shout over other people in order to have a conversation. When you sit down, they show you the menu of what you'll be eating that evening. Right off the bat I noticed a few things that my boyfriend wouldn't be able to eat and became a little nervous but really shouldn't have. They had it covered. The sushi chef had a printed out list of all of his allergies and let us know that for the menu items he couldn't have, they would create a new item for him. Talk about going above and beyond.\n\nTo explain the level of customer service, I'll describe one situation. One dish was a tuna and scallop sashimi over crushed ice, a leaf (can't remember what it was) and this slice of Japanese tuber. Having no idea what tuber was, we were about to eat, when the chef informed us that tuber is in the potato family and insisted in completely remaking the dish even when we offered to just not eat the tuber. For other dishes where there was crab (which he also can't have) he would make a completely new dish for him. Sometimes I was jealous because his looked so good that I wanted to have it. On top of it, if you are gluten-free, they have gluten-free soy sauce!!\n\nNow on to the important stuff. The food. WOWZA! So good. So fresh and so fantastic. Everything that I had was amazingly delicious. The fish was so fresh that it literally melted in your mouth. You could be absolutely toothless and have no problem eating this sushi. What was incredible was the ingenuity that the chef has. This sushi has a modern twist on it which makes it so fantastic and unique. There was one dish that the chef described as a sushi taco. Rice cracker on the bottom, avocado rice and unagi. AMAZING. Every dish was unique in it's own way. There were some pieces that I wish I had more of. The truffle miso soup with mushrooms was such a delicious difference from your typical miso soup. I only wish that the bowl was bigger and had more soup because it was so good! I could go on and on about how good eat piece of sushi was but chances are you won't have what I had. But trust me when I say that you won't be disappointed.\n\nNow you should know that this place is not cheap, but it is really worth every penny. From the execution to the service, this place is 5 stars across the board. Every experience there will be unique. If you have food allergies or a specific diet, this is a great place to go to because they will go above and beyond to make sure that you have an incredible experience. Thank you so much Kusakabe for the amazing meal and for having such a wonderful wait staff. No other restaurant can compare to how well you treat your customers!", "author": "Sabrina D."}

The matsutake really hit the spot with the flavor and all of my taste buds were jumping for joy. I could eat this for days.\n \nsashimi: Hokkaido scallop, hokkaido wild yellowtail sashimi, came presented beautifully on a bed of ice with some leaf shavings of some kind- i forgot what they were but generally I dont eat scallop and it was delish.

Everything was so so good, each piece of nigiri flavored to the maximum and paired with the right accompainments.\n\njapanese tapas- shigoku oyster with french caviar, red crab sushi, lobster and shrimp small bite, and otoro sushi bite, + Shirako, aka japanese salmon sperm!\nFinisher was otoro- good but somewhat chewy not 100% buttery\n\n\noverall everything was executed very well, from the service to presentation to each course and bite...were of the uptmost fresh...and the flavors of the nirigi sushi bites completely blew my mind...or as the hubby said it \" made me think about the flavors\"....which never happens!\n\nFor every course of the menu, they really pulled out all the stops to provide top notch, high end seafood ingrediants. No \"BS\" tomato courses observed when we went. Maybe Chef saw the reviews and upped his game so he can score another michelin rated star??\n\nSomeone at japanese places they will skimp on some courses and giveyou \"filler\" stuff, but not at kusakabe...everything was really top notch, did I say top quality already??\n\n$240 out the door for 2 with omakase and 1 asahi reserve. We were full by the end and headed to smitten to round off the night with minty ice cream.\n\nI can't wait for spring so I can go back to try their new menu. Definetely not a weekend night type of place, for sure a special occasion place to go with someone special or who is also a japanese foodie conousier like myself...for those looking for jive ass rolls, go to kitaro on Geary st please.\n\n For those nigiri purisits and japanese foodies like myself, you NEED TO GO NOW.\nonly sit at sushi bar, dont do the table!", "author": "Petri Y."}

I had to literally wave down someone to order more sake after my small tasting cup was dry 15 minutes.

Trust me, every now and then, I don't mind getting yelled at.  If you can teach me a way where I can enhance my dining experience, I'm all for it.  They recommend using your fingers to eat so they do have a wet cloth for you to wipe your fingers after each piece of sushi.\n\nOmakase.  So, yeah.........prefix set with an option to order more at the end.  Stick with the chotoro, ocean trout, and the salmon...........it's gud.  I wasn't too fond on the duck dumpling and was underwhelmed with the A5 at the end, it  just didn't melt in your mouth.  Every now and then, it's great to not go to a restaurant with so many different types of rolls.  It's all about the fish here so I didn't have my California roll.

It's not easy to get a reservation here but if you happen to walk by and the doors are open, maybe you will be as lucky to find that others have cancelled their reservations. \n\nThis is an experience. You don't order anything, you don't do anything. You just enjoy the show that they've meticulously planned out for you. I've tried a few omakases in my life but the art that they put into theirs is like no other. I'm not one to spoil a fantastic movie, but I'll say that they will take care of you. \n\nAfter the climatic ending with either a wagyu or toro nigiri, you have the option to order a la carte.  If you're still up to it after that masterpiece of a show (I always am), I suggest you order the three Unis side by side to compare the taste. Not to mention, my one and only sushi chef doesn't use seaweed to overpower the delicate taste of the Uni. Divine. \n\nDid I mention my favorite chef, ken (whose departure was the reason I stopped going to sushi ran)? He's fantastic.

For that, I appreciate it.\n\nOne thing with reservations - if you want to sit at the sushi bar, make sure to come earlier than you are supposed to and try to get the earlier reservation times. Apparently, outside of reserving a spot in the restaurant, where you sit is first come first serve. I was severely disappointed as I told them I would not want to make a reservation unless I could secure sitting at the sushi bar (twice I tried), just to find out they made the reservation but we were sat at a table. If they told me in advance, I would have went elsewhere for the occasion. \n\nAs far as the food, everything was very good. Ika with persimmon in oil and salt, snapper in sweat broth, and potato croquette with wagyu come to mind. Also, I would highly recommend miso with truffle over the meatball one. It is infinitely more delicious, especially if you like mushrooms. Nigiri (good temperature, good texture) were all good and comes in the order they should be eaten. Every time there was a platter of 3, eating from left to right gave me an experience of good, better, and best. The pacing was good.\n\nSo why not 5 stars? Other than the hiccup with the reservations, I think it's because the star of the meal was not sushi. I think I was expecting the sushi to wow me but in the end, it was the hot items that wowed me. Also if you aren't a small lady, you will leave hungry. Another thing - they sing happy birthday obnoxiously to every customer that has a birthday. It's seriously not appropriate for a $100+ dining experience and ruins the mood they set to achieve. Very very tacky.\n\nI think in the end, it was a good experience but not a good enough one for me to return over and over...I'm on the fence. Maybe it's a bit over-hyped.", "author": "Julie K."}

Their sushi bar has 17 seats total so unfortunately, it didn't happen this time. It can only handle parties of 2 or 3. \n\nThe meal last night was still the best sushi of my life. Honestly, if I could, I would refuse to eat sushi anywhere else (in the US... still need to go to Japan!). It might have topped last year's meal because the 'Hassun' was so exquisitely plated and delicious that it was by far one of my favorite dishes I've ever had in a Michelin-star restaurant hands-down! \n\nSpecial credit needs to be given to our server Gabriela. She's probably one of the best waitresses I have ever had in a restaurant. She was so apologetic about the sushi bar seating, which was honestly not needed because I was forewarned ahead of time that it might not happen. \nShe started me off with a complimentary taste of the Dewazakura Yukimanman \"Snow Country\" Daiginjo Sake (~$200/bottle). She gave us small tastings of other sakes before we decided on the Masakura. She did not rush us at all throughout our meal even though a colleague of ours was running late from a meeting. My friend mentioned she wanted a glass of wine over the sake, but settled on the sake after tasting GOOD sake! During the meal, I suggested to my friend she should still get her glass of wine if she really wanted one! A few minutes later, Gabriela must have over-heard because she brought over a taste of white wine! She has excellent booze taste buds!! She brought over a very crisp, refreshing glass that went perfectly with the seafood we were having. Her kindness, her attentiveness, and her management of the pace of the meal made it a truly memorable experience for us. Thank you Gabriela!

Did Jiro (from the movie, Jiro, Sushi of Dreams) influence more and more restaurants to do Omakase?  I don't know but it does seem that there are more and more Japanese restaurants that only do Omakase or offer it.  \n\nHaving read about the new Japanese restaurants and in particular quality Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, my wife and I chose Kusakabe because the price seems to be the most reasonable (Omakase wise at least) and we know of the chef's pedigree (Sushi Ran).  The restaurant which is situated right across from Transamerica building offers mostly counter seating and I would recommend counter seating as the chef will drop off sushi piece by piece to you.  It has a very clean feel(good since it's sushi) that has a LA vibe(lounge music going on in the background with intimate lighting).\n\nTo start off with they offer you a piece of toro and man was it beautifully put together.  Then it was followed by a couple pieces of sushi.  What did I have?  I can't remember but the key here is to offer you piece by piece so you enjoy it by itself.  And no, you there's no soy sauce given, they flavor the sushi themselves meaning they may sear it, they may add a bit of soy, they may add shiso leaf or a piece of liver to enhance the flavor but only one dish, our sashimi course which was really fresh came with mirin.  All the nigiri were delicious and fresh.  There was one course which came with five bites which included an oyster with caviar and yuzu, egg white with eel, and crab meat with rice.  The course was beautifully presented and had lot of unique flavors.\n\nAlright now the hot food I thought was a bit lacking.  The duck meatball miso soup.  The duck meatballs were pretty average.  There was another fried wagyu meatball and I couldn't taste any wagyu beef in there so that was a bit disappointing.\n\nService was pretty good although the counter is kind of tight and hard for the server to get in and out to clear your plates.  I appreciate the tiny towel they gave for our fingers (keeping it clean to pick the sushi up).  It was also my wife's birthday and when we ordered dessert, they remembered and brought out the candle and sang happy birthday which was nice.\n\nFor $95, the type of food, the quality of food and the service is a good deal however if you're a big eater you won't be full.  You will need to order a la carte and that's where it can get even more expensive.  For example uni (regular one) is $8.50 for one piece and toro is $12 for one piece.  If you order a few more pieces, that can easily add up.  I would also like to see more explanation into some of the food such as the five bites, it would have been more interesting if they said eat this first, this second, third, fourth and fifth to really enhance the flavors and etc.  \n\nOverall my wife and I both liked the place and I would say it's better than Sushi Ran.  We definitely will come back and hopefully the sushi will just be as good.", "author": "Pierre L."}

There were a lot of memorable bites, however, I felt that it was very overpriced compared to sushi in LA and NYC.\n\nThe presentation, customer service, and overall ambiance is very upscale and on point. I was never left with an empty glass of wine, they cleaned up and presented each following dish beautifully, and the waitress and chef explained each piece of sushi before eating.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy our dinner at Kusakabe, but there were a few disappointments. The set menu was about 12 dishes. Two of the 12 were annoyingly anticlimactic. One was a kelp tea, or basically warm sea water in my opinion. Another was tomato three ways (poached, sorbet, dried), which was actually tasty but should not be considered a DISH. So for $95+tax and tip, you're eating 10 pieces of delicious nigiri, something you could do for less than half the price at Maruya in the Mission.\n\nOur meal was not filling either. We ordered 3 additional items which racked up the bill quite a bit. Be prepared to pay something closer to $160 a person. The uni was nothing special, which was a great disappointment.\n\nEven so, Kusakabe is actually one of the best sushi spots I've tried in SF... Don't get me wrong, I'm all for upscale cuisine.

I have been to many of the \"best\" sushi restaurants in san francisco and was very excited to try Kusakabe after hearing rave reviews both on yelp and for the 1 Michelin star they received. \n\nSERVICE: We arrived 5 minutes early for our 8pm reservation and were told it would be another 10-15 minute wait, which we were fine with. They asked me to leave a cell phone number and suggested we get a drink nearby. We got a drink nearby and at 8:30pm had still not received a call so we walked back over. We were seated right away which was strange, especially since 10 minutes after we were seated they called my cell phone to seat us - clearly they didn't even know we had already been seated. \n\nWe then asked the waitress for her hot sake recommendation. After a brief discussion, we chose a sake and then soon after a cold sake was brought to our table. At this point we were too exasperated to complain and just went with the flow and drank up. Sake was very good...cold or hot...but again not what we wanted.\n\nFOOD: The fish is certainly high quality and you get what you pay for. The toro and king crab were the highlights but were unfortunately not enough to offset the poor initial service or impress.  Overall compared to some of the higher end sushi bars in sf (akiko, ichi, ozumo) I was far from impressed in terms of the flavor, creativity, and tastiness of the fish. Unlike many yelpers I don't knock off stars because the sushi bar down the street is cheaper. Even for a elite level of sushi, the restaurants in a comparable category blow it away. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Restaurant is beautiful. All the staff were friendly and welcoming. \n\nTLDR: High qualily fish but lacking in creativity and flavor. For the same amount of money you could have a much more delicious and filling meal at other high end sushi bars. Again, this review is not complaining about price, as I don't mid paying a lot of great sushi. I had high expectations but it grossly under delivered. As I said I have never written a yelp review but was so underwhelmed I thought it was necessary.\n\nEdit: The manager reached out to me and apologized for the wait.

IMO this was a mistake as the few extra pieces do not really justify paying 50% more. In fact I felt overstuffed at the end, so much so that it was difficult to enjoy the Grande Finale of Wagyu beef and Toro sushi. Speaking of Toro, I was pretty disappointed to see a major vein running up the center of the fish (I saw this was true for the Toro that everyone else received, too). I'm sorry, but you would never see that in a high end sushi restaurant in Japan. The whole point of dining in these places is to enjoy a quality of fish that you cannot find in your average neighborhood joint. Now to be fair the atmosphere is nice, the staff is attentive, and the menu features many price points for sake. The food itself is beautiful (though the tourist taking photos of every piece are a bit annoying). Some of the sushi is really, really good, and the all important rice is top quality.

They continually checked on us to make sure we were enjoying everything (and we were).\n\nThe food was worth every penny. The fish was so fresh, and each piece of nigiri had a unique flavor. The non-nigiri dishes were fantastic as well -- miso soup with duck meatballs, assorted sashimi, and wagyu beef, among a few others.\n\nI let them know it was my birthday when I made my reservation, and they did the whole happy birthday she-bang with soy milk ice cream. It was the cherry on top of a great meal.\n\nDon't even think about it. Just make reservations and go, before it becomes impossible to get a table.", "author": "Amanda L."}

We did the Omakase tasting ($95) with sake, followed by creme brulee and were Japanese full (satisfied but not uncomfortable).This was the best sashimi I have had in SF and was comparable to fresh fish we had in Hokkaido.

I thought it was going to be an out-of-this-world experience given the reputation. The sushi we got was quite good, but nothing that made us crave another piece. The appetizers and sashimi sampler were typical Michelin star style - teeny portions and pretty unimpressive.

My son is only 5 and previously the restaurant allowed him to bring in his own sandwich while my wife and I enjoyed our sushi.  Our son stayed quiet throughout the meal and behaved extremely well.  It was a good experience with the food and staff so we decided to come back right after New Years. \n\nWe made reservations almost 2 months ahead to plan for our New Year Dinner.  The day before our reservation date, the restaurant called and told us they have issues with children.  The mgr told us that the walkways are narrow and that there maybe be hot soup that could burn kids.  We told him our son behaved previously and sat in his seat the whole time without moving around.  The truth then comes out from the mgr telling me that I have to buy an omakase menu for my 5 yr old son because he is occupying a seat, not because of concerns of narrow walkway or hot soup!  \n\nA little irritated at this point, I told the mgr it's no problem and i will pay the $300+ amount of sushi for myself and my wife while my son cannot eat raw seafood and will just bring his own small sandwich.  The extra $100+ will go into drinks as well as the ala carte sushi after the omakase.  In fact, I offered to pay the entire amount upfront on the phone.  Nope, not good enough with this restaurant.....they want to instead make some simple roll (no raw ingredients) for my son and charge him the $95 omakase price.  This is the most absurd thing I have ever heard trying to extort $ out of a toddler even though we offer to pay the entire $300+ up front.  My son has been to Benu, Coi and even French Laundry without being treated like this.\n\nI was so fed up, I decided to just cancel the reservation for next day.  The mgr has the balls to ask me to reschedule due to this cancellation.  Needless to say, they lost me as a customer for good. I will instead enjoy my New Years dinner with my wife and son at Akiko's instead, which incidentally has no issues with my toddler son.", "author": "Kent L."}

We booked 2 months in advance for the 5pm seating (they have 2 seatings per night) immediately following a 2pm Book of Mormon show and opted to sit at the bar to watch the chefs at work.  We got lucky and were personally served by Chef-owner Kusakabe.  What a treat to watch him prepare each dish.  As far as prix fixe menus go, this one is very reasonably priced by SF standards.  The serving staff is incredibly attentive and helpful as well.  As soon as I dropped my chopsticks on the floor, a brand new set magically appeared before me.  Each server and chef explains each dish and answers each diner's questions in the most helpful manner possible.  Dining here was a spectacular treat, and we consumed the most unique and delicious sushi here.  The flavors and textures of each dish were perfectly harmonized.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-08", "description": "Kusakabe was such an awesome experience. This place has a similar concept to Jiro's where the menu is preset, people are seated at the bar in waves, guests are served in the order they came in, the sushi chefs only serve you the next piece after you consume what is currently served, and everyone gets the same items on the menu. Being an indecisive person who can never choose something off a menu, this was the perfect place. I have a very keen tongue for unfresh fish, but I can say this place serves pretty fresh fish. Every item served was very fresh. The only piece I was slightly disappointed by was the Toro - blue fin fatty tuna served at the end but it was better quality than most toro's I had in the bay. \n\nWhat I really liked about the place is the concept of eating with your hands and the superb service. The table setting includes a small black towel to wipe your fingers after picking up the sushi. Since the restaurant is small and customers come in in waves, it gives the wait staff the opportunity to attend all the customers throughout the night. Our glasses were instantly attended and every time I dropped a grain of rice or a drop of my drink on the table, someone would come by immediately to wipe it off.\n\nThe sushi chef, Ken was also very attentive. During the night, we met a very friendly couple who sat next to us. They came in a little after us so they were served a few items behind us on the menu. Ken noticed we were engaging in a deep conversation about the food so he served the couple slightly quicker so they were caught up to us. \n\nWe were given a menu to order additional sushi items at the end. I got the Kaisui Uni and the Ayu. The Kaisui Uni was a miniature version of the large uni you normally get. It was probably the best uni I had in the Bay Area. The ayu was also very yummy. It was a sweet and buttery burst of flavor. \n\nI came here for an anniversary so the restaurant served the Yuzu sorbet dessert with a candle which added a nice touch to the end of the night.\n\nOverall amazing experience and every bite was texture-full with a burst of flavor. Keep in mind the drink menu is printed on BOTH SIDES. The back side has the Japanese Sake, Ginjo, Daiginjo, and Sparkling drinks.", "author": "Karen C."}

And well let's just say I'm very surprised that they have or ever received a Michelin Star. \nLet's start with the not so great. Our waiter  must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed that day, he was really abrupt with me, dismissive - all in all not the type of service i'd expect form a Michelin rated restaurant. \nThe most annoying thing I found is that they had a very limited wine menu, 4-5 whites and the same for reds. We enquired about 2 of the red varietals, only to find out they had run out of those. 50% of their red wine list - Gone!? I don't like Pinot's so we were left to choose from their most expensive variety at the time a Barolo. Now I'm sorry, how do you have all of 10 wines on your wine list to manage and run out of 50% of your reds? That's just plain... well, I don't even had a word to describe.  And every time I quizzed the waiter about it, he rudely brushed me off. Didn't even have a logical (if there even is one) explanation for it.\nThe next example of rudeness we encountered was the same (having a bad day waiter) dropped a wine glass near my table while I was in the restroom. When I returned I was looking for my napkin and my friends told me the waiter used it to clean up the broken glass. When I asked for a replacement he tossed one into my lap. \n\nFood: Yeah it was really good, I'll give them that much - not the best i've ever had.... but really good! Unfortunately it comes part and parcel with me and they really let us down on all the other important stakes I judge a restaurant by.", "author": "Julia B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-21", "description": "I have been waiting to write this review until after I had the pleasure of dining at Masa, in New York. Masa (450$ per person for omakase-+150$pp for kobe supplement), is highly regarded as the best quality sushi and sushi experience in America. \nI have dined at Kusakabe 6 times now and I will continue to frequent this spot. Kusakabe is on the same level as Masa. Kusakabe blows all other SF sushi restaurants out of the water, including Akiko's and Maruya, by far. The experience that dining at Kusakabe delivers far surpasses all sushi experiences that I have had in the US, other than Masa, which is just as good. I will go as far as to say that Kusakabe is the French Laundry of Sushi.\n\nAfter returning from Japan, I have had a difficult time soothing my crave for the love of good sushi. In the Bay Area, it's almost appalling that we don't have great sushi bars, considering the large Japanese population. I had temporarily eased my fix at Sakae Sushi in San Mateo, but after discovering Kusakabe I can finally sleep peacefully at night knowing that quality sushi as great tasting and painstakingly prepared as I found in Japan, can also be found right here in San Francisco. It really is a dream come true, if you are a fellow sushi-lover and self-proclaimed sushi connoisseur, you will surely understand. \n\nThings that you need to understand before you dine here:\n1. True Kaiseki style (Omakase) means that the chef's have prepared a menu for the day, depending on availability of product, and season of fish/food. Adjustments are made accordingly to individual diners tastes. You will be asked at the start of the meal, \"What is your favorite sushi?\" \n2.The menu differs from day to day, week to week, depending upon availability. You will trust in the sushi chef(either  Mitsunori Kusakabe or Ken Ngai) to deliver a mind-blowing, taste-bud tingling experience to your body & soul for 95$ per person. \n3.After you have enjoyed the set number of courses (about 10 filling courses), you may order nigiri/sashimi or hand rolls from the a la carte menu.\n4. Do not come here without a reservation, you won't be seated. Reservations are booked weeks in advance so I recommend scheduling them far apart and many in between. \n5. This is not solely sushi, course items include a choice of soup( summer truffle, or duck dumpling, both miso based), wagyu beef, konbu cha (which is meant to be a palate cleanser ), as well as a small plate that varies with each visit. \n6. Please note that a true omakase takes time, as each piece of sushi is delicately prepared to perfection in front of your eyes. Expect to dine for 2-3 hours and enjoy every minute of the experience.\n\nAt just 95$ per person, some may see this as a deal, others as a special occasion splurge , either way, regardless of your budget,  you are truly getting the finest fish and quality ingredients in the world at Kusakabe. You will leave feeling warm, fuzzy, satisfied and enlightened. \n\nI am an Uni fiend, so I love to try all of the uni types available on the a la carte menu. My favorite is the Bafun Uni, if you love uni, you will respect the way it is prepared at Kusakabe. \nI am hooked on the summer truffle miso soup, which I expect will soon disappear as we move on to winter truffle season. I am highly anticipated any new supplements to the menu as I know they will be just as delicious.\nI prefer the wagyu beef over the toro option at the end of the meal, but it's personal preference as both are wonderfully prepared. I love and seek out the highest quality beef in the world.\nAll of the desserts are great, my favorite is the yuzu sorbet as it is so light and refreshing, yet packed with flavor.\n\nOne of the greatest aspects of Kusakabe as an establishment is the impeccable regard for simplicity of design, which is, to me, the most challenging aspect of cuisine to master. Everything, down to the sushi bar itself, which is made from a singular piece of soft, bleached Japanese wood called hinoki, is meticulously thought out and strategically placed.\n\nI can only describe my experiences at Kusakabe as divine and addicting. I would recommend Kusakabe to all people with an open mind and appreciation for artistic cuisine and world-class food.", "author": "Alexandra C."}

Without question, Kusakabe did not disappoint! This was our first time at an omakase style restaurant, so we were not quite sure what to expect. However, we will try anything when it comes to food so we went with the $150 selection and finished with the Toro, and we each ordered wagyu a la carte after the meal. There was not a single piece that we did not enjoy. Our favorites were of course the Toro and wagyu, but the barbecue eel was right there with them. It was amazing. After the omakase, a la carte wagyu, bottle of wine, and tip, it was just under $500 walking away. Pricey, but well worth it for a once in a lifetime dining experience.

Outstanding value as well at $95 per/person for the Omakase (the Omakase is mandatory - a series of small courses chosen by the chef for those not familiar with this concept - afterwards there is optional a la cart extras). The Omakase is mostly sushi, but there is a soup course, a hot course and a couple other items to add a nice variety. At the end of the Omakase we were satisfied but definitely had room for more.

First of all, their web page only talks about their $95 Omakase menu (on the front page at least), but when you get there they try to upsell you a $150 version.  The differences between the two weren't very clear, so we just went with the $95.  The sake parings are very expensive as well, so we just ordered drinks a la carte. The food was interesting, and unique, but nothing really blew us away.  I think our favorites were the cherry salmon and there were also some interesting smoked sashimi and nigiri.   Everything was fresh and well presented.  And the quantity was sufficient for this type of place.  The restaurant ambiance was nice.  So even though I was tempted to give only 3 stars, and even though there are a number of other restaurants I'd rather go to for the price, I'm bumping it up to 4.", "author": "Gordon L."}

Although we had reservations through Open Table and were seated immediately at 5pm when they opened, there were a few tables that remained open during our meal, so I don't think a reservation (for a table at least) is *required*. Taking the advice of fellow Yelpers, I noted in my reservation that I wanted to sit at the bar, and wow, what an experience. You sit a foot away from the sushi chef delicately prepping each piece of the tasting menu and it is something that you do not want to miss. The tasting menu is the only dining option that Kusakabe offers (to my knowledge), but they are very accommodating if you have dietary restrictions. When our server came to take our order, we had make a choice for which soup we wanted (course number 5 or so), and also our last dish (wagyu or fatty tuna). End to end, each dish was fantastic. I was skeptical about whether or not I would be full after our meal, but I was stuffed. I was also skeptical about whether or not I'd be able to tell the difference between all the different types of fish in the tasting menu and I can absolutely tell you, with fish of this quality, you can absolutely taste the difference.

It was really an art and how they were so disciplined to keep their area clean. We were lucky to sit at Kusakabe's seats. \nEach dish in the omakase was phenomenal and an eye opener starting with the salty kelp tea and tuna sushi to the deep ocean uni. When you sit at the bar, you can pick up the sushi with your hands which totally reminded me of a place in tsukiji market. The chefs are at a personal level and the offer so much fresh fish on the omakase. The wait staff and chef will talk to you asking what kind of fish you like - they later use this to build your seasonal fish dishes. You can order more sushi; although we were filling up I really wanted to try the uni. They offer 3 types and after talking to the chef, we went for the deep ocean one.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-13", "description": "The sushi here was excellent.  No doubt about it.  Ingredient quality and presentation were first rate.\n\nThe house-smoked katsuo was the best katsuo I have ever tasted (and I'm a katsuo fanatic).  Other sushi items were very fresh and prepared with proper proportion of ingredient vs rice (really important for things like uni).  By the way, having three types of uni to eat was very nice.\n\nOddly, there was very little focus on ebi (only one steamed ebi was available).  Perhaps that was just a function of ingredient availability.    Also, a little disappointing that there was not more salmon available (other than white king salmon, which, as a fish, never ceases to underwhelm).\n\nSo, why, given the generally excellent sushi, only 4 stars instead of 5?  \n\nFirst, the restaurant was bloody uncomfortable.  It was HOT!  I primarily used my napkin to wipe the sweat from my head while eating.  It started hot and it stayed hot the whole evening.\n\nSecond, the omakase menu was frustrating.  I come to a sushi restaurant to eat sushi.  I don't come to eat soup, to eat croquettes, or to eat many of the other little items that were presented.  The hot soup and croquette were the real insult given my already overheated condition.  And, I was too hungry and paying too much money to just not eat the soup, etc.  They should have an all sushi omakase available.  We soldiered through the omakase and then ordered lots more sushi.  But, dining out should be joyful and no \"soldiering\" should be required.\n\nThird, the counter (where we sat) was designed for people with no legs.  Amputees step right up, Kusakabe has the seat for you!  My 152cm wife was ok sitting at the counter, but for me it was agony.  Was I supposed to cut off my legs at the door?

To be honest, I was pretty stuffed after the omakase but I just can't turn down uni or ankimo when I see it.  A la carte nigiri was per piece and the hokkaido uni was $14/piece. Ouch.

The fish was the best I've had.  At the end of our meal, our chef (chef Ngai), asked if we would like to re-taste something or try something new.  Picking from various elements that we liked, he created a unique sushi for us: rice, wasabi, and toro - flame kissed by a torch just at one corer; garnished delicately with garlic, chives, and lime zest with a citrus glaze.

There is a symphony of taste in this small piece of chutoro on rice. All the other sushi was delicious, subtly flavored at times and well presented. The fish-rice balance was perfect and the rice itself was good. Our chef was personable and our conversations enhanced the quality of the dining experience. The waitstaff was appropriately attentive without being obvious. We had a marvelous dinner and I have to work hard to find some minor points to add as a critique. \n\nThe sushi in the Omakase menu was superb but the duck miso soup was only 'very good' in my opinion. The dashi was perhaps too plain for my taste. I had expected more from the kaisui uni I had after the Omakase, the very small portion on a spoon was tasteful and I can still remember it well, a good sign of its quality and complexity, but I prefer the traditional presentation of uni on a bed of rice held in by a ring of high quality nori to fully fill my mouth with the scent of the sea. Also, I have seen chefs grate wasabi just before forming their sushi and was told that they do this because wasabi loses its heat in about five minutes after being grated. I did not gain much from the pre-prepared wasabi that was being drawn from a small bowl.  \n \nWhen we first sat down, I asked the chef what fish was particularly good today and got the response that first time customers typically get in a high end Tokyo restaurant, \"it is all high quality, fresh... it depends on your taste\" (i.e. \"we don't know you at all and will save today's best find at the market for our valued customers\"). After the Omakase, he recommend the \"lightly cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper\" and it really was exceptional. After a more visits, he may be more open in sharing his views on the day's best finds. \n\nOverall, a great meal, a solid one Michelin star restaurant.", "author": "Andrejs S."}

Super expensive.  To be honest, I think it should be about 75% what it is, but hey, it's michelin rated, so they can do what they want. I'd definitely like to go back at some point. Just for ze fishies. Nomsssss.", "author": "Shannon B."}

The chefs are also super friendly and easy to talk to. They take the time to ask you what type of fish you like to eat and always ask customers for their thoughts after each dish presentation.  It is just too bad each bite cannot last forever....the toro is SO good.", "author": "Lusha W."}

We especially loved the truffle mushroom miso soup.   Divine!!!!  We also launched into the a la carte menu which is available after your omakase meal is completed.   We opted to try the trio of uni options with other amazing pieces per recommendations by our chef.   Very pricey meal with our a la carte additions but very, very delicious. We have tried other high end sushi restaurants (Maruya in SF, Sushi Sasabune in Honolulu, Sushi Ginza Onodera), Kusakabe ranks among our best sushi experiences. Limited bar seating with a few table seating options.", "author": "Irene M."}

My boyfriend took me here tonight for a special dinner and we were both speachless by the amount of beautiful masterpieces we consumed throughout the two hour meal. I love sushi, but I am always skeptical of those really fishy slabs that I always get in mediocre sushi restaurants so I always end up ordering basic things (aka tuna). This place has a prix -fixe menu so I was able to expand my horizons. Not only does this place have the most amazing melt in your mouth tuna I've ever had in your life but EVEEY SINGLE THING tastes like butter heaven with a hint of something new and fragrant in each piece. I had no idea that sushi could be so amazing, and I love sushi. This place brings sushi to a godly level. We both agreed that our favorite was the bonito. I belive it was the third piece of sushi you reviece, amazing it's cherry wood smoked and I didn't even want to swallow it it was so good. After our prix-fixe we had the bamboo cured snapper and the flying fish with golden cabiar on top. The flying fish was amazing. The bill was pricey but well worth it. This definitely isn't a n every week kind of place but it's amazing for a special occasion. I would reccomend this place to my closest friends, and everyone I know! Wow!", "author": "mackenzie e."}

The ambiance is very close to what you would expect to find at a similar establishment in Tokyo.  You should absolutely request seats at the sushi bar if they are available, and even better if you are seated right in front of the chef, who is a master artist.  Everyone in the restaurant is friendly, polite, and unobtrusive.  You could tell our server was truly invested in making sure we had a wonderful experience, and was excited to share her recommendations with us.  The sushi itself is incredible.  Each piece was expertly crafted, with complex flavors blending together beautifully.  I especially enjoyed the kisu, which I had never had before, and the o-toro finale was out of this world.  The truffle miso soup course was also excellent, with a depth of flavors I had never had before in a soup.  The aji was also incredible, as was the Hokkaido uni (deep sea) that you can select a la carte after the omakase menu is complete.  The chef explained each piece you received, and was also pleasant and friendly.  Kusakabe truly brings a taste of Tokyo haute cuisine to the Bay Area, something we had always lamented was missing from the restaurant scene.  We are so happy that Kusakabe is here!", "author": "Michelle C."}

I also expressed distaste for uni and ankimo--i enjoy the flavor, but very much dislike the texture (it's like snot!). i had so much ginger, green onion, uni, and ankimo tonight. it was all soooo good. everything i normally avoid, was delicate and balanced.\n\nmy friend rm came once before, and recommended the salmon with sakura leaf. that's seriously some of the best sushi i have ever had. something about the sweet nuances of the leaf...i ate 3 pieces. gluttonous.\n\nthe duck and mushroom misos were quite nice. the first toro was probably the third nicest bite. second fav was the sweet fish (ayu). \n\nservice is sick, in the good way. rm was curious about some sweet sake describe with \"yogurt.\" the waitress had the person who wrote the menu come out and explain it. when a neighboring guest requested barracuda for all 3 of us, and they only had 2 portions left, the kickass chef was kind enough to portion it into 3 for us.\n\nrm, you da bes.\nbarry, you're number two.\ni'm going to be hungover tomorrow. order the centrifuge sake. and the snow country sake.\n\nhow am i going to ever top this meal? it's only wednesday...", "author": "grace l."}

I heard some time ago that chef nori and ken were striking out on their own.  They didn't disappoint.  The ex GF and I enjoyed a wonderful anniversary omakase meal that took over 3 hours.  The key is that it didn't feel that long as we enjoyed course after course.  Chef Ken even re introduced Ankimo to us as we have not had prior good experiences with that dish elsewhere.  It was much different this time around as the flavors were much more delicate and balanced compared to other times where the pate flavors were overbearing.  Oh yeah and plus one to all those who said be sure to try the Uni that is on the ala carte menu. Service was attentive yet not smothering.   More or less a perfect experience", "author": "Palmer L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-20", "description": "We went there a week ago on the early seating and the place looked very spartan but elegant in a very Japanese way.  The sushi counter is made of a rare wood that is quite long and is the focus of the room where 'Nori' the owner/chef holds court.  The menu began with Chu-toro and ended with Chu-toro which should tell you the procession is a bit off.  In the best Omakase meals, the chef should lead you into an opus from the first movement to an finale which you enjoy a exhilarating ride of sensory pleasures.  However, the fish is some of the best cuts I've had in SF.  Some of the other ingredients were less stellar such as the Compari tomato rather than a heirloom which is just coming into season now.  The most troublesome is that after a 9-10 course meal....one should not be given an a la carte sushi menu to augment the prix fixe in case one is still hungry.  This would not be needed if it was a true style Omakase where the chef would sense your level of enjoyment as well as the adventure in your palate.  Here it is simply a prix fixe menu with supplements.  The service was very attentive and we did enjoy the experience but it pales still to the real thing in Japan and other parts of Asia.", "author": "Gregory C."}
