We chanced upon it while walking to the bill graham for a show and since we needed to fuel up, we stopped by for a burrito. The people who work there are super nice, my friend was talking to them in Spanish and they took the time to carefully explain all the questions we had and gave us extra salsa later! We split a vegetarian burrito- it was so delicious! It had rice, beans, sour cream, avocado, pico de Gallo, onions and cilantro. The burrito was folded well and was HUUUGE, two key aspects of a good burrito. It was cash only, but they have an atm inside. Would definitely come back", "author": "Kulmeher D."}

Regular Taco (Carne Asada) $2.67:  Your standard carne asada taco.  Got the beef, some green onions (well, I guess that's a bit different), a little cilantro, and diced tomatoes and onions.  Two corn tortillas.  The meat's alright--grilled but a bit dry.  Flavoring is good.  5/10.\n\n2. Super Nachos (Carne Asada) $10.25:  Why more than $10?--cause it's HUGE.  I mean, probably the biggest plate of nachos I've ever had in my face.  Heaping piles of beans, jalapenos, and meat... and a generously complimenting amount of whole jalapenos and a good amount of avocado.  Same asada--okay quality.  Could use more melty cheese, both more melty and more cheese.  Don't particularly like the chips--they use the cheap bulk kind.  Kinda stale and tasteless.  But the avocado--there's quite a bit of it!  Kinda different to just use scoops of fresh avocado instead of guacamole, but it works.  Overall it is indeed too much for one person, but you also pay for that amount.

I've been to all the most popular taquerias in the Mission, but for years, I've ignored this compact one in my own backyard. Well, it's not exactly in my backyard, but it is a stone's throw away. Just don't throw stones please. For Jane Kim's sake, there's enough crime in this area with all those surly-looking guys in the hoodies and the baseball caps on the corner of 7th and Market. Hurry up, CVS, open, open, open! But alas, I finally tried it when I decided to take the 5-line to get home. Since it turns onto McAllister instead of staying on Market, I felt this was the moment of the apocalypse when I should give it a try finally.\n\nIt's OK, not wow but OK. On my virginal visit, I went for the one-two punch of a $6.22 Vegetarian Burrito and a $2.39 Vegetarian Taco. The former seemed a bit overpriced, while the latter was quite a bargain, so net-net, I have to conclude it was decently priced grub. The burrito had all the standard ingredients, but satisfying as it was, the moisture of the tomato and lettuce made the sour cream especially drippy and the rice in need of an O-Cedar sponge (see photo). The taco, on the other hand, was liberally covered by all its vegetarian ingredients, the most prominent being a fresh avocado half scooped on top of a mound of sour cream and chopped tomato (see photo). That was good stuff.\n\nWhat I did notice on the way out is that they sell Menudo on the weekends for $9.66. I came back the following week and ordered it to go. It's ladled into a large Coca-Cola cup (...guess they save the plastic containers for special occasions) with warmed flour tortillas, chopped onions and cilantro, crushed oregano and chili peppers, lime wedges, and chips and salsa. Pretty good but not at the level of Mexico Tipico's. There was no tripe, just a lot of bones with leftover marrow and gristle but in a nice rich broth infused with red chili paste (see photo). Truth be told, I've had it a couple of times since my discovery, both times bringing it home to assemble and heat up. I'm no menudo snob, that's for sure.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...good veggie taco but the convenient menudo is what draws me back\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...just a hole-in-the-wall but well-kept compared to most Mission operations\nSERVICE - 3 stars...quiet and efficient\nTOTAL - 3 stars...my go-to place for a late-night menudo run", "author": "Ed U."}

He was the guy preparing my 2 veggie tacos, and he knew I always get a large agua fresca (cantaloupe flavor).  He recognized me right away.  I must have a face that people don't forget...lol. \n\nSince it's my first time at Taqueria Castillo B, I'm just gonna start off with a three star rating (actually 3.5 stars).  I notice this place serves fish taco ($3.45), whereas El Castillito does not.  Thus, next item on the menu to try - their fish tacos.

This place has several things in common, the most salient being that it's located in a really dicey area. \n\nThe long-shuttered Hibernia Bank is just a few steps away, St Anthony's dining room (and the waiting 'customers') is just around the corner, a smorgasbord of homeless, drug-addicted and mentally ill people are hanging around, and the ever-present scent of...oh let's say \"eau de pissoir\"... is all over the sidewalks.\n\nThings that make you go, \"eeeewwwwwww!!!!\"\n\nThe restaurant itself is actually much cleaner, fortunately. There's a reasonable amount of seating for the square footage available, the food is fresh and kept sequestered from grabby hands, and the menu has a reasonable variety to it.\n\nI had no qualms with the price, and it was pretty good quality food, too. Not the most outstanding Mexican food I've ever tried, but nothing wrong with it. One of my co-diners had a shrimp number that was \"al diablo\" (or some such Satanic description), and I believe I'm going to try that when I next wander in here.\n\nYeah: if you don't like seeing the worst of what our current economy has to offer, if you don't like seeing firsthand why \"drugs are bad, mmm'kay?\", or if you feel guilty having good Mexican food within a diagonal block of a soup kitchen, then you most certainly should go somewhere else.\n\nIf you have more of a spine, though, then feel free to drop by.\n\nFor now, I give it 3.2 stars.

They cook up the meat when you order it, rather than just scooping it straight from the warmer to the tortilla.\n\nAnd the little things that make or break a taqueria -- Good:  good level of cleanliness; horchata is good.  Bad:  chips are from a bag; no salsa bar or pickles.", "author": "J S."}

The service is sort of snarly at times --- not just aloof, but enraged at customers' daring in ordering food.  Some days this is not the case, but all to frequently it is.  They also have a nasty tendency of overcharging for things. \"You receive regular nachos --- but you pay for the super!\"  (though given that's only about $2 more, it's forgivable)\n\nIf the food was excellent in any way I would accept these indignities, but this is somnambulent Mexican fare.  The only bright spot is the green salsa.", "author": "Gustie L."}

I should have known not to order from this place when I initially saw the meat sitting out uncovered and flies buzzing around everywhere. Alas, I was super hungry and didn't think much of it at the time. BIG MISTAKE. I got the worst food poisoning of my life from this place, and it lasted for 2 days. I didn't even get anything sketchy... I ordered a chicken burrito, which is usually one of the safest options to get at a Mexican restaurant. I ended up talking to some other people about this place, and it turns out that a lot of people have gotten sick from their food. Honestly I feel like this place should be closed down until they can get  their health standards up to par.

Dirty, a random street person sleeping at a table, and a guy out front asking for change. However, without question, this is the best Mexican food you can find in the Loin...or Downtown for that matter. I would even go so far as to say it rivals many of the taquerias in the Mission.\n\nThe ingredients are uber-fresh, the service is fast, and the prices are cheap. Burritos are amazing--very generous portions, and some secret salsa they use that gives it just a bit of a kick that I really appreciate. While I eat there at least once a week, I've only put a small dent in their menu, so I can't say everything is amazing...But I'll let you know.\n\nIf you speak Spanish (which I don't) you have a huge advantage. Watching people in line, they seem to make you whatever you like--from sandwiches to wraps to plates to crazy breakfast entrees. Some of what they've made others ahead of me in line had me glancing up at the board to figure out what it was, and telling myself I need to learn some Spanish.\n\nAs far as service goes, yes, they can be a bit...short. But only when they have a line out the door. For the most part, they are friendly, attentive, patient, and never pushy.\n\nWell worth the 5 or 6 bucks.
