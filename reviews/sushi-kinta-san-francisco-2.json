Don't go here. \n\nMy colleague and I both got the lunch box: teriyaki chicken and rice with four California rolls served with miso soup in a coffee cup. Simple enough right? I am in no ways a good cook and I guarantee you I could make something that tastes better than what I had to force down earlier today. The chicken did not look like chicken. The chicken did not taste like chicken. The sauce that it was drenched in didn't even taste like teriyaki sauce. The miso soup was decent, but I'm a sucker for miso soup. The rice was odd to say the least. To be generous, the California rolls were bearable. Imitation crab with rice that felt like it's been left out for quite some time. I didn't know it was possible to mess something as simple as a California roll up. My colleague literally threw up his lunch. I don't usually write Yelp reviews, let alone bad ones, but this place is just that repulsive. Please do your taste buds and stomach a favor by going somewhere else.", "author": "Justin D."}

It's a small place but it does have a couple of tables inside to dine-in. I've been here a couple of times to get their Lunch Box (~$10) which contains chicken teriyaki, rice, tempura, California roll and miso soup. \n\nThey are pretty generous with their portion especially for the rice which is of a decent quality. The tempura & California roll are average. The tempura is vegetable and shrimp combined. It is fried correctly and not too oily. The chicken teriyaki is very good. The chicken is soft and juicy but it is drenched in teriyaki sauce (so get it on the side if you prefer). The miso soup comes in a coffee cup (the first time I returned it back saying I had not ordered coffee :)).\n\nPeople behind the counter and courteous and order fulfillment time is less than 5 minutes. Food consistency is maintained across visits. I'm not sure why this place has such a low rating but what you are getting considering the location and price seems to be a decent deal to me.

If you're hesitant to check this place out due to the low Yelp rating, JUST IGNORE IT AND GO!\n\nI work a couple blocks away and have been coming here quite a bit since mid-2013 when I first discovered it. It's my go-to spot for a delicious and cheap sushi lunch. I've taken plenty of friends and co-workers here, and everyone has really liked it so far!\n\nI've never ordered their bento meals or curries but go straight for their sushi, which is solid. My usual order is a caterpillar roll, a 6-piece order of salmon sashimi, and a miso soup, all for $20.92. (Yes, I've ordered this combo so many times I've memorized how much it costs. Don't judge.)\n\nTheir miso soup really hits the spot on a chilly winter day. I was pretty cold when I headed into the restaurant today and it was exactly what I needed to warm up to a nice toasty room temperature. And their salmon sashimi is surprisingly decent for the price you end up paying...it's definitely the most consistently fresh salmon I've had at any sushi joint in downtown. And considering that I've been here countless times, that's saying a lot! :)\n\nI've heard from some of the people I've taken here that their other dishes - specifically their curry and teriyaki chicken - are really good too, but I cannot personally vouch for them.  \n\nThere is some limited seating inside but it isn't a big space. I think they have enough tables for maybe 10 people perhaps? And then there's some additional bar seating on the side. I usually come anywhere between 11:30 and noon, and I've been lucky enough to always find a seat for two people. \n\nThere is a bit of a wait for your food, especially around prime lunch time, but I don't mind. There's only one guy making the sushi rolls so it's understandable if they're a little bit backed up. \n\nThey used to be cash only, which was the only thing I didn't like about them, but starting in December 2014, I started noticing a new sign saying that they now accept credit cards!!!

What happens when these two things happen at the same time? I end up at places like Sushi Kinta.\n\nSushi Kinta gets one more star than it's neighbor, Crepe N Curry, for it's food.  I had their chicken curry rice bowl for lunch today and while it hardly holds a candle to places like Japacurry, it wasn't overly offensive.  I even ate all of it. The rice bowl comes with an absurd amount of potatoes that are WAY too big to eat without a knife, and yes, they use the same chicken that is used in the chicken teriyaki.  And yes, to confirm, they give you miso soup in a coffee cup.  The curry was uneventful, but more flavor than I think what people on here are saying.\n\nWhere it gets knocked one star: There are signs (and Yelp reviews) all over the place that say it's Cash Only.  There's even one of those stupid robot looking ATMs conveniently located right by the register in case you forgot paper.  In waiting for my food, two people walked up to the counter to order, placed an order with the lady at the register, only to realize that they didn't have cash on them and proceeded to walk out.  The woman, who I thought was going to tell them they had to come back since she had yelled behind the magical mystery curtain the orders, proceeded to call them back to tell them they could use their cards after a whimsical credit card machine that was squirreled away underneath the register appeared.

I said, \"I would like to place an order if that's okay.\" He goes, \"yeah what do you want, hurry up!\" At this point I was beyond shocked... so I finally decided to say something about his attitude. I told him that I will not be told to hurry up & that it's just plain rude. He goes, \"okay, go buy somewhere else, don't come here, if you don't want hurry up then go somewhere else\" and he hung up. I don't care how good your business is or how many people line up daily to get lunch there, as a business owner you should never think for one second that a customer lost is just a customer lost and that it's okay to blow off a customer since one customer is not going to make a huge difference in your profits...

I've been a few times recently and can only give the place a meh of a review.  Sad.  Today's unagi donburi was so-so, the salad was chopped iceburg with a really watered down thousand island dressing and the miso was very thin (and I mean on flavor) with 2 small pieces of tofu in it.\n\nI think I will have to find some other place to satisfy my craving for Japanese food, it's not going to be easy in FiDi.", "author": "Donna H."}

Being at a fairly good location I thought it would serve some decent Japanese bento boxes, but thought wrong.  I tried the \"Lunch Deluxe Box\" that was just under $10 and included chicken teriyaki, tempura, and california rolls.  The tempura was sub par and of low quality... almost looked like they made it in a mad rush.  The california rolls were acceptable but then again, who messes up a cali roll?  The quality of the chicken was also very low... actually made me question if it was even chicken.  Plus they must be the only place in the Embarcadero that don't accept credit cards- you're in the financial district!  Methinks not.", "author": "Daniel L."}

I'm Cantonese, but I hate it when Chinese people hate Japan for their actions prior to WW I, but turn around and open a Japanese restaurant. How pathetic!\r\n\r\nAnyways, I stared at their menu for what seemed like 300 secs, and nothing was really enticing. The typical japanese stuff.. nothing exciting. \r\n\r\nWell, here it is again, my CHICKEN TERIYAKI test.  Folks, Japanese restaurants live and die by the infamous dish. If it doesn't taste good, most likely the restaurant will fail at everything they put out.\r\n\r\nSK is no exception. When I got a seat, my teriyaki seemed to be hot, but when I examined it closely, it wasnt really meat.. it was more like quasi fat, meat by-product that barely passed the USDA health inspection! Rice was decent, and I ate more of that than the chicken itself. The Cali roll was nothing to write home about... consisting of seaweed, rice, weird avacado mixture that seemd to come from guacamole, and imitation crab meat. \r\n\r\nMiso soup is Miso Nasty! Whats with some fake seaweed and miso soup without any real miso in it!\r\n\r\nSick, absolutely disgusting and tasteless. Even the ginger was bitter. Ordinary Japanese place looking for a quick buck.

It happens every time when I let hubby decide on where to eat...I've yet to learn from my mistake.\n\nUpon walking in, I knew it was not authentic - the people behind the counter were speaking Cantonese.  That's cool - let's not judge...yet.  Hubby wanted a hot bowl of udon so we ordered:\n\nseafood udon - this was a chinese version of seafood udon - the udon was not chewy but doughy.  It came with pieces of iceberg lettuce.  The seafood was 2 shrimp, 2 slices of  pink fish cake, 2 white fish ball.

First my friend and I hesitated and looked around for more sushi places, to compare. Since the other one was closed we came to this one... which we shouldn't have.\n\nRight when I walked in the door I looked at the menu and everything was pricey. My first reaction was \"wow! they're lunch box special is so cheap! ( less than 7$) I ordered that and after I learned the person running it spoke a language other than Japanese so I became skeptical of how good the food would be. My miso soup was served in a cup, such as the foam cups you'd get coffee in and my terriyaki chicken, rice, California rolls, wasabi, and this pink stuff ((which i like alot)) was in a to-go box.\n\nWhen I opened it I didn't really think the 'chicken teriyaki' was really teriyaki, or chicken as a matter of fact. I tried it and it was too soft, and I could of sworn it tasted like ham! Although my friend said, \"wow! this chicken is so tender! its really good\" I however, am used to eating quality cooked chicken since my mom, I must say, is an excellent cook :3 Anyways, the rice was alright and there's nothing special to say about their Californian roll. Now what really bothered me was their miso soup. It was hot, yes, but disgusting. Mine didn't even come with tofu, and came with what looked to be a square cube of imitation sea weed. (?) I didn't want to be rude, but when the two woman who were there went into the kitchen side I quickly threw it away... :\\\\ It was just gross to me and my friend said \"its alright....\"\n\nThe only reason why I was surprised with the price is I went to another restaurant across from the Peace Plaza in SF that's called Iroha (its upstairs). I bought a similar lunch box for 12$ which consisted of Teriyaki on two sticks, rice, wasabi, and an assortment of sushi (such as eel, salmon, crab,etc) and WONDERFUL miso soup! It was delicious! So thats why I was surprised with Sushi Kinta's miso soup :[ However their customer service was good and the woman who served me was polite. I don't think I'll ever be coming back here and wouldn't recommend  to anyone either unless they feel like wasting their money.\n\nI guess here, for the cheap money you spend on a lunch box you should expect the same quality in return.", "author": "ZEEBRA W."}

Sushi Kinta is not a sushi place I would go on a date night, but for a nice lunch to curb my hankering for sushi on a weekday, it's perfect! First, I almost missed it (small place), when I walked in the staff was super friendly and asked what I wanted but of course, I'm one of those people who needs to peruse the menu before I decide, so I step back and say I need a minute and the sushi chef there asks what kind of fish I like (Yellowtail) and he recommends the spicy yellowtail roll and I add on small order of salmon sashimi (another thing I'm addicted to) and a miso soup for good measure. They ring me up (CASH ONLY!!) and I wait about 5 minutes for my food. The spicy yellowtail was delicious! A little spicier than I had expected but pleasantly so. The sashimi was fresh and he added a couple extra pieces. The miso soup was pretty good (it comes in a coffee cup, don't mistake it for tea). Overall first experience, better than I had expected! Especially after reading all these reviews. I've been there about 3 times since and they still remember me and always add a few extra pieces of sashimi or a roll to my order. The place is nice to go to when you want to treat yourself to a quiet yummy lunch (although I definitely would recommend it as a nice little lunch spot for you and another person).

They do have bento lunch boxes (but WHY does every Asian eatery fall back on broccoli and carrots--when there are tons of Asians vegetables available in this town????) and I would get the salmon box a couple times a month, once in a while I'd spring for the unagi bowl--both are passable but I think microwaved.  I also have to give them credit for changing their sign once they found out that the \"white belly tuna\" wasn't tuna at all but escolar--they now state that which not many other places do.
