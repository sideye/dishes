There is plenty of meter street parking and paid private lots towards the rear of the Cafe.\n\nTheir donut selection consisted of all the regular donuts seen at many other typical shops. \n\nI tried the Old Fashion Maple Donut. The donut had more of a soft interior and left an oily layer in my mouth. The donut seemed average and nothing stood out to separate it from other donuts I tried. The price of the donut is a little steep. I don't mind paying more for a good product. In this case the quality of donut and price did not match. \n\nConsidering the price and average donut is why I gave it a low Rating. Next time I'll probably stick to my regular go-to shop but their location and hours are convenient from my work.", "author": "Paul V."}

My personal favorite is the vanilla cake with chocolate icing and rainbow sprinkles.  Airy, fluffy, fresh, and only $1.  There are plenty of different kinds ranging from $1-$2.  Yes, there are sometimes flies in the cases, but these doughnuts are worth it.\n\nBLT w/ Chips:  Shockingly good.  The BLT comes with plenty of thick bacon, with fresh L&T, and the bread is always the best part.  Fresh and chewy.  Just a standard bag of chips, but the price is reasonable.\n\nBagel with Cream Cheese:  DON'T GET IT.  This was the only terrible thing I ate here.  Just go to Safeway and buy a bagel with cream cheese.  This is what the Manhattan food vendors at 42nd St feed tourists.  It's a cheap soggy bagel with a slab of processed cream cheese product.

I understand they are busy and things get a little hectic sometimes, especially right around the 8:00-9:00AM hour before people head to work. But on more than one occasion, a customer walked in, jumped to the front of the line, and got service immediately with no questions. On one occasion, I said something to the worker, because I didn't think it was fair for TWO people to be helped who weren't even in line, and he got REALLY snappy with me.

When I lived in NYC, I used to come to SF for vacations and be soooo excited about getting fresh and different doughnuts in San Francisco rather than the stale limp thing that passes as doughnuts at Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme (I am sure they just inject fat into Krispy Kreme doughnuts and that's why everybody likes them...I really do not enjoy Krispy Kreme doughnuts whatsoever, and that's saying a lot from a gal who enjoys almost any fatty food product concocted on this planet).  Everytime I was visiting SF, I would buy two doughnuts from All Star for the plane ride back. \n\nPlus, now that i have learned from the information-minded Yelpers that this All Star is open 24 hours...that just made my day.  One of these days, I really want to do the midnight run for doughnuts that I keep on hearing about.  Ya know: show up in the middle of the night and smell the just-fried doughnuts thing.\n\nThey also sell cheap sandwiches.  The person who introduced me to the sandwiches raved about their Philly steak sandwiches.  After I had All Star's Philly steak sandwich, I was convinced my friend had never had a genuine Philly steak sandwich in his whole life.  But it's still a cheap sandwich that's decent, just not a Philly steak sandwich.\n\nMoreover, when I walk to work on weekends (because I have to procrastinate as long as possible to get to work on a weekend...as well as try to get some retail therapy on Market St. to convince myself to step a foot into the office on a weekend day) I stop by and get one of those long doughnuts with custard in the middle.  By the way, last time I was at Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme, they didn't have those long doughnuts which lets you fool yourself into believing you are having the same fatty content as just a regular smaller doughnut.\n\nI like the Marina All Star doughnuts better...but this one is closer and not in the Marina, and open 24 hours.  \n\nSan Franciscans: wake up and smell the doughnut...this is better than Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts.", "author": "Sooj O."}

When I saw the sign for the All-Star Cafe, my mouth started to water as I thought back to an awesome meatball sandwich I had back in Vegas.  \n\nI go in hoping I would be able to relive that taste but unfortunately they didn't have a meatball sandwich on the menu.  Instead I opted to get a philly cheesesteak.  The best thing about the sandwich was the fact that even after not being able to get back home for another 20-25 minutes to eat it, it was still toasty and delicious.  I was getting a little full halfway through the sandwich but found myself eating the whole thing.  If I ever feel like going to that part of town again, I think I'm gonna get me another sandwich.", "author": "Joel J."}

I'll have to knock a star off though...I was behind 3 other people waiting for phillys as well and the idiot on the grill made everyones order one at a time (I know it's not a big grill but you can at least do 2 at a time). I thought i was gonna miss my bus home and muni isn't exactly reliable at 2 AM in the morning.", "author": "Mike A."}
