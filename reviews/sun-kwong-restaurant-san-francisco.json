Le bf and I loved the place when it was run by the nice old Chinese lady a few years ago. Recently, they have changed owners, and I'm even tempted to say they have changed owners twice in the past year or so. The old Sun Kwong that I knew no longer exists. \n\nI used to associate Sun Kwong with super cheap and delicious Chinese food. Everything now is far more expensive than it previously was (by about $3-5/dish), and nothing tastes as good anymore. The service is also pretty bad, considering there weren't many tables full when we went on a Saturday night. It is also very cold inside, even with the doors closed. \n\nWe ordered:\n1. Sun Kwong Special Chicken rice plate\n2. Hot and sour soup\n3. Fried wontons\n4. Chicken chow mein\n\nThe only thing we liked was the chicken chow mein. That was solid. Everything else tasted bad, in one way or another. \n\nThe place is so bad that I really want Yelp to delete the previous positive reviews that were written when the little old Chinese lady ran the place. This place only resembles the old place in terms of the physical address, but nothing else.\n\nI am so sad to have a lost my favorite cheap Chinese food place in the city. I don't recommend that you go. When I saw the recent negative reviews, I honestly thought people were overreacting and wanted to try it for myself. Those people ARE NOT overreacting. It really isn't good anymore.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

We heard there were new owners and the reviews on yelp improved so we decided to give it a try. \n\nThe first time we came we ordered BBQ pork egg foo young, salt n pepper pork chops and a veggie dish. The egg foo young was very good, pork chops were dry and meat tasted old, the veggie dish was just ok. \n\nWe came a second time for the egg foo young and ordered fried chicken wings and BBQ pork chow mein. The chow mein noodles were soggy and BBQ pork was old and dry. The wings were bland and seemed old (skin was dark and looked like it had blood clots). When we bit into the wing it was raw. We showed the older lady (who does not speak english, but nice) and she called her daughter the server and they apologized and took them back. \n\nA few minutes later, they brought back the same wings re-cooked minus the two we tried to eat.  The wings were still uneatable and unappetizing. They noticed we did not want to eat them and asked what was wrong, I told them they look old and dark and pointed out the blood spots, again they both apologized. \n\nWhen the bill came, we were charged for the horrible wings. I could have argued and insisted they take them off but didn't have the energy. We really wanted to like this place since it's only a few blocks from home and there are not too many good chinese restaurants in the neighborhood.  We will definitely not be back!", "author": "Rpm M."}

So this seems pretty fitting for my 500th Review!\n\nSun Kwong is awesome! It's incredibly cheap! We'd usually order about 3 items and it would last us the two of us for two days! We'd get two meals for 2 out of it for about $20. That's nuts! \n\nWe've ordered a variety of dishes, but always a noodle. They do noodles really well! I really like the Oyster Clay Pot too. Plus, the portions here are gigantic. Every dish here is at least decent but pretty much everything is good up to great! I haven't had one like really stand out, must order dish though. I waffled between a 4 and 5 stars, but I just love this place.\n\nWe've ordered here so many times. And the woman who works here is so nice! My husband tried to leave her a tip for take out and she came running after him trying to return the change, and she wouldn't accept it the tip. \n\nPlus after we moved, we were really craving some Sun Kwong, so we drove over. We couldn't find any parking; it's terrible in this area, so I ran in and asked if we could get the menu so husband and I could browse it while idling in the car. The amazing woman who works there, then brought us out tea to our car! HOW COOL IS THAT!\n\nWe placed our order, and she said it would about 20 minutes. Then I figured I'd go in to collect, but she brought it out to us in our car before it was even 20 minutes. This place rules. \n\nIt's our little neighborhood secret.", "author": "Rebecca G."}

I wish I could rate this place a complete ZERO! \n\nFirst off they don't know how to speak English. It was such a hassle just to order chicken WITH pork fried rice. (Theres no such thing as rotisserie chicken here and apparently you cant order chicken wings with fried rice, you have to order it separately) lol They kept getting my order wrong, I dont understand how hard it is... \n\nHaving visited China myself, they act exactly how people act in China it's like they are yelling at you and look at you like you have 2 heads. So she doesnt even tell me how much the order was, just takes my $20 bill. As she's handing me back my change, I simply ask how much was it? And shes like $5.50 for fried rice & $6.50 for chicken wings. And I said okay and I guess the way I said okay, she's like go across the street and they charge $9.50 for wings as if I offended her. Like look lady! No one was trying to offend you. It's so annoying with language barriers, this is why I hated China. This place was so unprofessional! \n\nNow to get to the food: DISGUSTING!!! The fried chicken wings were undercooked!!! And the pork in the fried rice was black, like come on! And the soda cans they gave was FILTHY! This was ordered as take out and I took 5 bites and threw it out, that's how horrible this was! Mind you, I am not a picky eater!

Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the service. Called in a pickup order and immediately after I finished speaking the woman hung up. Did not provide information on how long the food was going to be or any other information about price so I called back to confirm. Woman said food would be ready in 15 minutes. Okay maybe they are just really busy. We have heard the food and service is great.\n\nStarted heading to the restaurant to pick up the order. Tipped the woman, who gave us the food and ringed is up. Once we got home we opened the meal to find string bean chicken (which is really just a massive serving of sprouts) not sweet and sour chicken as we asked. \n\nCalled back in hopes the restaurant would try to rectify the situation only to get the answer that if we wanted the order corrected that we would have to go back to the restaurant in order to get the correct food. Not only was the woman on the phone extremely rude and rushed us off the phone, but when we got to the restaurant to pick up the correct order. The woman completely ignored us. She even pretended not to speak English when we returned. \n\nAdvice to restaurant - serve the customer better. Repeat back and confirm the order. Let the customer know when the food will be ready and how much it will cost. When the customer has an issue don't put the burden on the customer to \"return\" the wrong dish, but provide them with a solution that doesn't involve them coming back to your restaurant and being greeted in a terribly rude manner.\n\nAdvice to consumers - don't put up with poor customer service.

I must confess: I'm not actually the biggest fan of Chinese food, and can't actually tell if the food at Sun Kwong is good or not. Also it looks exactly like what you'd imagine a family-run Chinese restaurant to look like. HOWEVER my best friend, who loves cheap Asian food, was so bowled over by this place that I'm surprised he didn't move in on the spot. Here's his Facebook status:\n\n\"Officially my favorite restaurant in San Francisco (no one else will like it remotely as much as I do though, so be aware of this fact). Literally $5 for more food than you can eat, and $8 for the luxury 5-8 course option. As one review puts it, \"Prices for everything seem to be stuck in another dimension.\" Thanks for living right next to this place Ava\"\n\nHe liked Sun Kwong so much he literally organized a COWORKING session here. Because he is insane. Can you imagine 18 techies with their laptops eating Chinese food while they write emails in a (pretty cramped) restaurant? I can. Because it happened. \n\nSo, yes.

There were maybe four cuts of carrot with the dish, and they were probably the tastiest part (carrots are so cheap, why skimp on those?!)\n\nAnyway, I suppose you get what you pay for, but I would advise trying any other options first unless you are really close by and pressed for time, or you love super bland dishes that make you appreciate the last Chinese restaurant you went to more.", "author": "Taylor S."}

I'm just glad it exists more in Nob Hill than in Chinatown, although I'm not sure why. Gives me a solid option for low-cost chinese food literally a block from where I live.\n\nAs long as you manage your expectations, this place works well. It's mom+pop, so the interior and seating isn't too fancy, and probably falls under the category of \"acceptably old and greasy\". \n\nThe food is pretty solid, American-friendly Canto fare. That means tasty bean sauce fish cubes over rice, broccoli beef, etc; you get the idea. It's good. Not amazing, but a solid good.\n\nSure, the prices might have gone up a little no thanks to gentrification and all that jazz, but c'mon, are you expecting grass-fed beef below $10? Or organic sweet and sour pork? No? Good. You'll do just fine here and enjoy yourself some comfort food.\n\nMy favourite items are the string been with minced pork and the bean paste fish.

The three of us each ordered soup, but she told us to only get two soups - and then we ended up with enough to serve at least six people - so, know that an individual soup order will serve multiple people. The hot & sour soup was a bit vinegary for my taste - we all preferred the wonton soup. I found the chow mein to be very plain but still tasty, and not OVERLY greasy. The klassic sweet & sour pork was actually pretty good - there was lots of nicely cooked meat. \n\nI prefer Sun Kwong to U-Lee, which seems to mainly be highlighted for its enormous, but otherwise not terribly interesting, potstickers.

The place may have changed owners over the past 50 odd years but it looks just the same as I remembered it -- 9 tables of varying size in the small space w/a high ceiling in front & a drop down ceiling in back.  The walls & ceiling looked clean & recently painted in contrast w/the greasy & yellowed walls as I recall from my childhood.  The old stick-on floor tiles also looked clean & regularly swept & mopped. These are big pluses for any Chinese restaurant dive like Sun Kwong.\n\nI arrived \"late\" for lunch around 230 & the place was pretty much empty.  I ordered a pai gwat fan (spare rib rice) plate wc was listed on the menu for just $4.25 ($5 w/tax) This dish is in the class of my \"go-to\" Chinese (more specifically Cantonese) comfort foods.  The pai qwat was sauced a little too heavily (too much soy) but it wasn't too salty for me & the meat was fall off the bone tender as it should be.  Not the best pai gwat I've ever had but it was eatable & certainly worth $5.  \n\nAdd the atmospheric milieu of the sound of the traffic coming & going, the drone of the cable car cable running underground, the occasional clang of cars running over the cable hatches in the road, listening to Cantonese being spoken by the staff and the sound & sight of the cable cars (the clang of their bells & the rumble of their wheels on the tracks) passing by & you've got one of the purest San Francisco experiences.  \n\nIt's certainly worth a 2 block walk up the hill (wc allowed me to take a peak at the Spring Valley Elementary school yard wc brought back even more memories because it was the 1st school I attended way back in 1955. Spring Valley is also one of the oldest schools in SF (having been built in 1910 after the 1906 fire burned pretty much everything down west of Van Ness) & was virtually 100% Chinese until the 1960's when de facto discrimination was finally abolished in the City.  So, there is some historical significance in taking the walk up the hill as well.\n\nSo, if you're looking for some passable, cheap & authentic Chinese food & want to experience the uniqueness of SF, a little time spent eating at Sun Kwong will be well worth your time.

First off it is too greasy, I get that noodles are supposed to be oily during the cooking process but it is overall too much oil, more than average. The flavor would be OKAY if there weren't charred bits/remnants of dirty-wok in my food. This made it taste a little bitter. Again it'd be fine if my noodles themselves and the food itself was charred but there were actual little bits as if you were to scrape up a dirty wok. The noodles were also not all separated there were pieces that were still together and stacked 4-5 pieces. Sauce was not completely covered on all noodles... the list goes on. Anyway for $5 and a less than 10 minute wait time for take out I guess it's a quick fix.", "author": "Curieux V."}

I had high hopes because 1) everyone who eats here is asian 2) the prices are pretty darn cheap 3) the menu selection is humongous (like abc cafe/washington st cafe big).\n\nI really wanted to like this place, because the food came out looking absolutely delicious and i really liked the waitress who clearly was also one of the owners.   \n\nWe ordered the fried chicken wings, the house combination chow mein (hong kong style, which means fried crispy thin yellow noodles), and the shrimp with lobster sauce.\n\nI'm kind of convinced I ordered wrong, because the food at the other tables came out piping hot and looked amazing. Our food came out smoking hot and looked almost as good too, but I was underwhelmed by the taste.\n\nFor starters, the ice water they served tasted funny. Specifically, it tasted like vegetables had been washed in the water. I can't imagine a scenario in which that could have happened, but it was a distinct and unmistakable taste.\n\nnext came the free house soup. little more than a chicken broth cooked with lotus root, its a lot like other house soups you'll often get at other authentic chinese restaurants. warming but almost by definition, nothing to salivate over. \n\nThe fried chicken wings were undercooked in the center. had a nice crispy outside, but the inside still had an undercooked look and taste to it (bloody, etc). Additionally, they were just fried with no spice to it, so the only flavor was the sweet and sour sauce served on the side. \n\nThe house chow mein was well cooked, but had a funny taste to it. Like the pan it had been cooked in still had detergeant residue on it and seeped into the food. Couldn't quite place it, but it was definitely there. The gf mentioned that MSG tastes funny to some people - since she couldn't taste it - but since i assumedly eat msg like its my job and have never had a problem before, i don't really think that was it.\n\nThe shrimp with lobster sauce looked good, although I've never seen the dish served with a brown tinge to it. maybe soy sauce? black bean sauce? whatever the brown, I was looking forward to it making it particularly tasty, but it was surprisingly bland. Needed both salt and pepper. Tasted pretty yummy with white pepper though. \n\nEgad! I am really tempted to try this place again since its so cheap, and the food comes out so hot (which imho is half the deliciousness for cheap food!), but two different items came out with a chemical-like taste to them, one came out undercooked, and one came out bland! no hits! sad. \n\nOn the plus side, the fortune cookies were better than usual (who knew that was possible?) also, it gave me a really awesome fortune saying something great will happen to me in exactly 3 months from yesterday). now that's a fortune.\n\n20.05 before tip for two people with leftovers, which cements this place as a cheap eat.", "author": "James W."}

I'm Chinese so I think I know good Chinese food. It was \"eh\". The only reason I'm giving it three starts is because it is really cheap and the waitress was nice. Which is actually really hard to find in a Chinese restaurant. But I agree with other reviewers below. The food kind of tasted metallic. I got the Hong Kong style seafood chow mein and chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. The noodles in the chow mein were fine, but the seafood tasted like it was old.

The waitress asked if I wanted it on the rice or separate.  I only initially understood \"on the rice\" and went for that.  In Taipei everyone eats rice separately from a bowl in their left hand, which is the way I prefer it too.  Sadly, my moment of understanding came too late.\n\nFirst came a barley soup (on the house?) with a huge chunk of beef joint (oh so Chinese) sitting in the center.  That was decent.  Very little meat involved but it wasn't introduced as such.\n\nNext, I got my main dish, your typical beef with all sorts of vegetables. It instantly fogged up my glasses.   After a while I realized that the reason was because the rice was blisteringly hot, not the food.  In Asia I scarcely remember having blazing hot rice, anywhere.  I think it might've been to warm up the food (the food on the edge of the plate was quite cold).\n\nNonetheless, when the waiter brought out the check, it came to $4.75!

I grew up near here and my family would order from here at least 5-7 times a month. Multiply that by 20+ years = some kind of figure I can't fathom. Now that I moved back to the 'hood, even hubby who is new to this area quickly made it one of his favorite take out places. I'm not going to lie and say this is the best Chinese food you'll ever eat, but the overall taste and price make it worthy of  4 stars for a take-out joint. The food is cooked home-style which is tasty, cheap, substantially portioned, and not too greasy. The owners (the wife is the server; the husband is the cook) are super friendly and will always offer you a cup of tea while waiting. \n\nI think I've eaten every thing on the menu at least ten times - maybe eleven?  - and it's an extensive menu - but these 5 are my top favorites which I order time and time again (they're all only  $5-$6 each). Generally everything is A-OK but the beef can be hit or miss:\n\n1) Salty fish & chicken fried rice - Another yelper said they make the best one in town, and I would second that! The dish comes out with a beautiful smoky flavor filled with lightly seasoned bits of chicken and salty fish. I like that they chop up the salty fish small enough so that the whole order has a consistent flavor. Other places keep the bits bigger, but then you either get a mouthful of plain rice or a mouthful of just salty fish - ick! Here, the entire order is perfectly blended and every bite tastes as good as the next. They also add in some shredded lettuce which keeps the smoky flavor in check. An indicator of a good Cantonese restaurant is if the food has wok \"mei\" which = a smoky, wok essence. Hard to define, but essentially it's when the chef has cooked the food on a very high temperature wok (you should see actual flames shooting up under the wok) such that the flavors are sealed in with a slight smoky taste. Few restaurants master this, but Sun Kwong does it great on this dish.\n\n2)  \"hung toe yee fu won ton\"  I don't even know what this is called in English, and it's not listed on their menu. Basically, it's a soup where the won tons are first fried, then added back into a soup made out of swirled egg, minced bbq char siu/pork and minced shrimp. It's garnished with cilantro and green onion, but I usually ask them to skip the cilantro. Overall, it looks like a red colored egg-drop soup w/ wonton. I like this dish because the wonton skins take on a different texture and get a distinct yet mildly smoky flavor when fried first. This soup is so good I once saw a group of Chinese workers come in with their own metal pots (some big enough to qualify as vats), and literally ask Sun Kwong to fill up their pots with this soup!  I must not be the only one that thinks it's good....    \n\n3) Tomato Beef chow mein - This is a uniquely American-Cantonese (perhaps even only SF) dish. Several times I tried to order this down in LA and they didn't know what I was talking about or it came out horribly wrong. The tomato beef chow mein here is exactly like how it's supposed to be: a sweet, thin yet substantially tomato-tasting sauce. The one at Sun Kwong comes out with juicy pieces of tomato, onions, and red & green bell peppers. I typically don't order beef from here, but this is one dish that I would still order w/beef. The one across the street at U-Lee is also pretty good, but I like Sun Kwong's better. \n\n4) Pipa Tofu  (\"pei pa dow fu\") - I don't know if they list this on the English menu but it's on the Chinese one. They're braised tofu pieces shaped like Chinese lutes, hence the name. The tofu mixture has a little finely minced bbq pork (I'm guessing it's this but never asked) and some cilantro. The mixture is then molded into lute shapes, quickly fried so the outside is brown but the inside still soft & moist, then braised with a light sauce. It's a very light and delicate tasting dish (tofu doesn't have a lot of flavor by itself) but if you like fresh tofu, you'll probably like this. \n\n5) Steamed pork cake w/salty fish (\"ham yu ju yok bang\") This is a very traditional home-style Cantonese dish, the kind your grandma back in the village would make. It's probably best to eat this one there rather than take-out. The steamed ground pork mixture comes out soft and fluffy, has the right amount of spices, and with a nice layer of juice.  The salty fish piece in the center is big enough to flavor everything. As such, it's great comfort-food made especially well here, but if you've never eaten it before, you may not like it. Chinese people would think it looks great, but I've seen non-Asians shying away from this dish based on looks alone. It doesn't look gross, but it just doesn't visually resemble any kind of  known Western dish except maybe a steamed, wet meat patty surrounded by juice.  (See! I told you that it probably sounds weird!) But seriously, if you can get past the visual look, it's a really tasty dish.", "author": "Colleen L."}

I believe that this is a family owned establishment and im all for supporting family owned businesses. I sat down and the nice lady brought me a newspaper and I ordered beef chow fun and egg rolls. The food was good and different then your run of the mill Chinese food. The egg rolls were very tasty and came with sweet and sour sauce, which I think was made from beets.", "author": "Bradley P."}

It's hard to find the right combination of rice noodles, meat and veggies outside of my own kitchen, so I'm glad that this place is so close to home.  \n\nSun Kwong isn't much to look at and not quite a place known for their ambiance. However, if you value a good value - this is the place to go for a quick fix if you're not sure what to do for dinner.  Their Sam See Mai Fun is one of best in the city. Chinese foodies talk about the amount of Wok-Intensity (Wok - Hei) that makes a good restaurant -  the chef definitely has that magic touch- which turns Americanized Chinese food into something quite authentic and tasty!", "author": "Caryn L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-19", "description": "Decent food, at pretty much the best price ever? The couple that owns this hole in the wall, have been running this restaurant for twenty-five years strong. I have so much respect for people who start their own businesses.\n\nThe waitress says the business can be slow because parking is so difficult (which I strongly agree). The customers there were CLEARLY regulars at Sun Kwong. So friendly, and sparked conversation with the waitress.\n\nHasd the basic fried rice fix, peppered chicken, and veggie and tofu. It was decent food, and so cheap!", "author": "Melissa E."}

She always remembers what I like to order even when I haven't been there in a while.  Large portions at low prices.  My friend and I used to go there all the time and order soup (the best hot and sour soup), potstickers, and two entrees.  We would leave FULL with leftovers and never pay more than $20 total with tip (actually, we would usually kick down a couple extra bucks for Yolanda.)  Sun Kwong is definitely a hole in the wall, but is my favorite place for good, cheap Chinese food.", "author": "Sara H."}

Huge, huge portions for dirt cheap prices all served in what looks like the owner's personal kitchen.  Most entrees are huge, good, and under $6.   One time, I dined on a 6 course family style meal with 6 people for less than $40!  And it was all really good.   It is all dished up by a mild mannered, sweet woman who is the owner.  It really feels like home when you are dining here.\n\nSome of the things I have tried and liked are sweet and sour pork, potstickers, wonton soup, chow mein, chef's special chicken, beef with broccoli, and so on.  There are also a lot of really authentic items if you are so inclined. The chef who is the other owner will also cook up special requests.  So, if you have a favorite dish that mom used make (my mom is white as hell, so she only made bland white people Chinese-inspired food), then ask for it to be made.", "author": "t l."}

I much prefer U-Lee, which is cati-corner from this place. The clientel is predominately Asian here, which attests to its more authentic Chinese cooking. I am just too used to Americanized Chinese cooking, having been away from the Bay Area for too many years. As a kid growing up in SF, I ate all the authentic stuff, but no more. I can't believe all the stuff I ate then...\n\nNote that I gave Sun Kwong only 3 stars because I am not a fan of too authentic, \"down-home\" Chinese cooking. However, someone who is, may well give them 4 or 5 stars. So my rating does NOT imply that their food is not good, just not my cup of tea.\n\nSusan, the waitress and wife of the cook, is very friendly and courteous.", "author": "John C."}
