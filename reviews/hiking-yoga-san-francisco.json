We took BART and got off Embarcadero and walked less than 5 minutes to meet up with everyone else at the Ferry Building under the clock tower at 9:50am. \n\nLaurie was our instructor and kindly checked us all in as we trickled in. We got in a circle to introduce ourselves and then started our hike. \n\nThere was a total of 4 stops:\n\n-The first stop was in a little grassy area. We started with some light stretches and breathing exercises. Then we went down Vallejo and started heading up on those steep hills. \n\n-The second stop was in a little neighborhood surrounded by trees and flowers. The view of the bay was gorgeous. This was my favorite spot. This is when it started getting super hot. I was dripping in sweat because of the sun beating down on me. We did some yoga stretches. \n\n-Our third destination was at an even higher hill overlooking the city. Laurie taught us some partner poses which I really enjoyed.\n\n-Our last and final stop was at the Grace Cathedral, where we took a group picture together.\n\nAfterwards, Laurie and her husband Scott led us back to where we started (for those who wanted to head back to the ferry building). Throughout the whole 1.5 hours, Laurie and Scott made sure to make conversations here and there with everyone (it was a group of about 20 people). They are such a sweet couple!\n\nAs for difficulty, I definitely expected it to be a little bit more challenging since I'm not very flexible, but it wasn't too bad, especially since there was more hiking than yoga-ing. As for my mom, she was super exhausted from climbing since she doesn't get out much.\n\nAll in all, I had a wonderful Sunday morning with a great group of people. I definitely would recommend Hiking Yoga! :)", "author": "Lincy H."}

My trip was short and limited on the events I took part in, but I'm beyond glad that I this was one of listed (paid) events that were showcased for this gorgeous city. I like unconventional, nontraditional things and thought this fell into that. I enjoy both hiking and yoga but I don't think I would of ever looked into such an activity for a city type trip, otherwise. OMG, amazing...but soooo painful, in a good way...afterwards. ;)\n\nSo many wonderful things came out of this. I'm a big time walk about type of person and feel there's certain things that can only be appreciated while on foot.  San Francisco in general isn't car friendly to begin with. And though I've visited The City a few times before, I was able to really appreciate some really cool spots that are not quite known of.\n\nSo the hiking part...whoa, that was no joke. You want to be able to pace yourself with the pack and obviously there's going to be a mixed group of people. With that in mind, I will say you need to relatively be in good shape as there are hills and stairs (yep, those windy roads and stairs that SF is know for) that you'll have to tackle. The instructor/leader will not hesitate to keep going..so even if out of embarrassment, you're gonna  want to keep moving. Those inclines are what will make you feel the burn HARD but the feeling you get when you get to the top makes it all so worth it. That's when you'll have a chance to briefly catch your breath, do a Yoga pose, get centered and then take in a quick view (or pic) of the beautiful scene. You'll be overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge and Treasure Island at different secret points. We did 4 different poses which stretched over our 1 1/2 hour hike throughout the streets of SF. The hike will take you to pass through or stops at parks and landmarks such as the  Grace Cathedral Church, Coit Tower, which you'll end up at. \n\nThis is seriously one of the coolest things you can do in this city. If all else, it'll give you an excuse to indulge afterwards in whatever those traditional things we all do while traveling. You know, all that eating and drinking stuff we likes to do.", "author": "Cat A."}

We saw this on Groupon, were intrigued and bought tickets. Little did we know how much of a workout this was actually going to be. Our guide, Christiane, was great and very friendly! We met at the clock tower at the ferry building and started our 1.5 hour journey promptly at 10am. She took us up 4 very steep hills and stair climbs all of which led up to beautiful views and some yoga! The hills make you breathe heavy but you soon feel relaxed and as calm as ever when the guide leads you through the yoga poses. The journey comes to an end at Coit Tower where you enjoy a longer (and a bit harder) yoga session. This last session leaves you feeling rejuvenated and peaceful! \n\nOverall, this was a fantastic experience, especially for the Groupon price of $10.

But then I ran, or rather, hiked into it again on Groupon and I was sold.  For $10 I could try it out.\n\nSigning Up for a Class:  Their online system I found both simple and difficult.  I liked that you could clearly see the options and make sure of your class.  But . . . I didn't like how I didn't know how to pay with my Groupon (or at least I just didn't, but emailed - they were very nice in helping me) or how I couldn't sign up for my husband as well (I'm sure they have their reasons).\n\nThe Hike: We signed up for the Los Gatos hike this last weekend.  Again, I guess I just didn't see it, or where it said, \"Four Mile Hike\" or \"Steep Areas\" or \"Rocky\".  But . . . maybe I'm just BLIND.  The first hill is pretty killer and it continues to be steep in places.  There isn't a lot of shade, so seriously bring sunscreen, water, and possibly a hat.  It's rocky, so watch you step.  On the way down, be careful of slipping.  With all that said about the problems, I still enjoyed the hike part (I just need to get in better shape).  I want to try the hike in Woodside next.\n\nThe yoga part was nice and so was our instructor, Lisa.  She made sure what levels we were at, if there were any injuries,  included some new moves and I loved the couples moves.  Now my husband and I can incorporate these into our yoga together.  I felt like a bit of a silly hippie doing some of the moves in front of some uber macho bikers, but it was all worth it.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience and I'm looking forward to enjoying my next yoga hike.", "author": "Sabrina A."}

Read their website or other reviews for a description.\n\nWhile Hiking Yoga say they cater to all fitness levels, they don't. They cater to really active people, and it left inactive people to be clumped in the back as the group breaks up and there is no longer a social atmosphere, rather a catch-up atmosphere. \n\nI am definitely not as active as other hikers that participated on the hike, and I was always upfront about that. I was reassured that I would have a great time, and the hike caters to everyone. There were 2-3 leaders in our group. One of the other groups was cancelled, so they merged 2 groups together.\n\nI felt really bad for the last lady in the group...she was so behind in the group. One of the group leaders and I waited for her to catch up. He looked distraught waiting for her.  When she finally reached him, he told her, \"I have to catch up with the rest of the group. I am going to leave you here with my friend, who will finish up the hike with you.\" \nTurns to the friend and says, \"I am sorry you came from out of town to hang out, but can you help with this?\" The friend obliged, the lady looked pissed, and I didn't blame her.  When we finally reached back to the Ferry Building, the leader was like, \"I don't know where my friend and that lady is...I think they are lost. Not sure how I am going to find them.\"\n\nHonestly, the hiking yoga journey I went on did NOT cater to all activity levels. And shame on the leader who ditched his slower client. Not sure why he HAD to catch up with the front of the group, I asked one of the other hikers if he made a speech or something when he caught up to the group, and she said no, the leader was just talking about the rest of his day plans. \n\nLame. I will walk through the city on my own! \n\nDid make a cool contact in the group that day.", "author": "Anisha G."}

The group was either young (college age or slightly beyond), or baby boomers. Christiane advised us that we would be walking about 3 miles an hour for 90 minutes, with some uphill for cardio, 4 stops for yoga ending up at the Campanile for a final stretch. \n\nThis hike is not for someone who does not exercise regularly - the hills are challenging at the 3.0 mph pace. Unlike one of the negative Yelp reviews from 2011, Christiane did circle back, look back, wave, and had people looking out for the ones who were slower (moi). I got so overheated that I had to stop a couple of times going up hill, but didn't want to get left behind - even though I knew my way back (home) but I wanted to hang in there.\n\nWhile we didn't see Maybecks and Morgans as promised in the PR hype on the website, the walk was pleasant, we saw some views, she warned us that some of the views would be occluded by fog and they were. \n\nThe people in our group were very pleasant - and it was easy to talk to each other. A nice hiking yoga experience - but you need to be able to do the cardio and the yoga moves. I opted out of some of them because some of the stretches and poses could have introduced new injuries as I only do restorative yoga poses. You just have to know your limits and know what not to try if you've never done yoga before - you can really injure yourself as a yoga novice. \n\nThere is no judgment when you can't keep up or do the yoga poses. Christiane encourages you to do what you can and to have fun along with exercising.\n\nTruthfully though, for my fitness level, I wouldn't go again, but I bought two hikes and have to take the second before the end of October, so I will go again knowing what the challenges are, and opt out as I need to, or I will share my hike with someone who is able to participate more fully in the experience. I met a very nice woman who walked my pace so that was a bonus - we chatted as we hiked.\n\nChristiane's  fitness and energy is inspiring. \n\nRecommend that a different level of hiking yoga be offered for people who are not as fit -- on level ground instead of the climbing which puts a lot of stress on knees (that last climb up the stairs to Cedar - I think - was a killer); and was for me almost too much cardio-wise.", "author": "Mamie L."}

They started off nice and easy, but got progressively more challenging. By the third yoga station, my legs and core were definitely working to hold the poses. I have terrible balance and would occasionally fall out of some of the poses, but I found Christiane to be super helpful and encouraging. She spent time helping each person in the class, making adjustments to his/her form.\n\nThe instructors - Christiane was so nice! She was great to talk to, and her soothing voice seems to have been made for teaching yoga. It really helped me focus and center myself at each station. Plus, she was great at spending time with everyone in the class both while we were doing yoga and hiking - she also did a good job of making sure the group didn't straggle too far apart during the hike.\n\nThe views - On both of the hikes that I've been on, I really appreciated the routes we took and all of the scenery along the way. It's easy to go through everyday life without really enjoying your surroundings, and Hiking Yoga gives you the chance to take it all in. I live in San Francisco and went to college in Berkeley, and during the hikes, we visited areas of both that I had previously never seen or spent much time in.\n\nThe only drawback/consideration:\n\nParking - If you park in a metered spot, you may have to cut out early if the class runs over the allotted 90 minutes. Which means you'll have to miss some of the yoga at the last station. Boo.", "author": "Stephanie K."}

Before I did it, I thought it would be in the woods, like actual hiking, but it's more just walking (quite vigorously, however) in neighborhoods. The San Francisco one meets at the Ferry Building and goes up around Coit Tower and down the other side, then back up to Coit Tower for the final yoga stop. The Berkeley one meets on the Cal campus and goes up into the neighborhoods north of campus and then loops back through campus for the finish. They both have great scenery, and both leaders that I've had (Laurie in SF and Christiane in Berkeley) were very friendly. Laurie's yoga stops were more involved, even including several partner poses, which I always think is ambitious when you don't know how comfortable people are going to be with touching strangers. Also, what if you have an odd-numbered group? Maybe she just counts and doesn't do partner poses with those groups...anyway, it was cool. The SF one is definitely harder than the Berkeley one. I did it yesterday and my thighs are sore.\nI'd definitely go back to either one.

In the beginning we were told that if attendees were lagging behind (due to fitness levels) the group would circle back and pick them up so we could all do our yoga stops together. \nI'm a pretty fit person, so I did fine for the first two climbs and yoga stops. Its a bit challenging to do some yoga moves on inclined/uneven pavement, but I managed just fine. Christiane was attentive to the class and walked around adjusting us where necessary. The idea is you get a really vigorous hike in, then stop to recover your breath with some yoga poses. After the second stop I found myself in the back of the pack with a really nice lady who was on her 4th yoga hike. \nThe group left the two of us behind. We rounded a corner and saw no one. We called the instructor and left a voice message after walking around Grace Cathedral looking for everyone (we were both under the impression that Grace Cathedral was our third stop). \nLuckily for me my fellow yogi was a laid back soul as well and we had a good laugh about being left behind, then took off to see the Fairmont Hotel. She was a local and I was an out of towner and I think we enjoyed each other's company for our little detour. \nPlease note: this is NOT for anyone who is not cardiovascularly fit. This is a good way to see some really interesting neighborhoods in San Francisco (and get a heavy cardio workout in!). Do not expect this to be anything like a regular yoga class. Of course I wasn't able to complete the session so I'm not sure what the last stop is like. \nWould I do it again? Probably not in San Francisco. I might consider it in another city but honestly I'd prefer either a hike in the forest, a walk in a city, or a \"typical\" yoga class over this hybrid. Glad I tried it and enjoyed the conversation I had during the hike, but it's just overall not for me.

The only downside for me? As it turns out, I think I just don't like yoga (I've tried a few different classes at a few different studios...maybe I just haven't hit my groove yet). The first few \"yoga stations\" (I think there are 4 over the course of the hike, with the last one being the longest) were fine for me, and didn't involve really difficult poses. But when we got to the last station, the yoga became a little more serious, and I wasn't a huge fan. But the awkward/uncomfortable poses were a small enough part of the whole experience that I'd definitely do it again. (And, I mean, the company's name is \"Hiking Yoga,\" so it's not really reasonable to complain that the workout involves yoga ;) )\n\nI think this would be a great thing to do with friends visiting from out of town (as long as they're up for a work out), and it's definitely a great thing for locals who want to take some time to appreciate their home.

My concern was that I'd be gasping and slowing everyone down.\n\nAnyway, I went to tonight's 5:30 session, with Greg as the instructor. He was fantastic: extremely positive, well-trained, and helpful. And it was a great mix of cardio and yoga, which he was able to adjust to the varying experience and fitness levels of the 12 people who showed up (a few people bailed at the last minute, but the max group size is 16). We saw areas of Russian Hill, Telegraph Hill, and other areas I've never seen in my 13 years here.\n\nAside from the exercise, the great views, and Greg's expert instruction,  the best part (and one that I absolutely didn't expect) was the high level of social interaction. It was a diverse group, half male and half female, with two couples and a few tourists. But because you're stopping every 10 minutes or so to do the yoga, you invariably get mixed around as you move on to the next stop. Everyone was very friendly, and it reminded me yet again why I have a hard time imagining life anywhere but San Francisco (at least in the US).\n\nAnd that was true whether I was chatting with the woman visiting from Scotland, a young gay couple, a woman who happens to live 2 blocks from me, or anyone else. This is a special area that is home to and attracts many great people, and this was a special experience. I usually don't sound so sappy, but this course was so much better than I'd expected!

We'd only ever done yoga as part of the P90X regime (it's hard!), but we enjoy hiking and thought it would be a great idea to get together and get out of the house.\n\nBefore the hike, Eric who's the founder and our designated instructor sent us a email to confirm the time and location.  We were initially concerned about cancellation because we had booked several months in advance, but it turns out that we worried for nothing.  We also wondered about yoga mats and whether we would mind grimy used ones, but it's actually not needed (for the tour we went on, at least).\n\nAs for the hike, it was the four of us joined by another couple, also first-timers.  Eric chatted with us about his background, sports, and fitness while we waited for the appointed time to begin.  He is friendly and knowledgeable, and it certainly doesn't hurt that he is tall and incredibly fit.  We started out with an easy hike and warm-up yoga at the first station (a larger area along the trail), then alternated between stretches of hiking and yoga at different stations.  Eric was very good about explaining the different positions, building up on difficulty and offering alternatives, and gently correcting incorrect postures.  My favorite was the couples' and group yoga at the last station.  There were 4 total, and the whole hike lasted 2 hours, which was half an hour more than we paid for.  I had a very positive experience and would definitely recommend Hiking Yoga to friends.\n\nPros:\n- Great for yoga newbies.  It's OK to tip over laughing, and Eric is very encouraging.\n- Great for get togethers.  Think yoga in the morning, lunch, then shopping.  Or just to get the hubby off the couch.\n- Great if you like nature and variety.

The trails weren't crowded at all, which was a pleasant surprise considering it was a beautiful fall day and the weekend. The trail we took was challenging but enjoyable, and the view from the top (at various points) was stunning.\n\nAs for our instructor, Emily, I can't say enough good things. She was completely personable and knowledgeable, and she has this wonderful positive presence--a great person to spend your Sunday morning hiking with!\n\nIn addition to the natural beauty and multiple trails, the park has an added little bonus--at the top of the parking area, there's a beautiful restored stable, full of equally beautiful horses, that you can walk through and enjoy. Which we did, very much.\n\nIf you want a great workout in beautiful surroundings, I'd highly recommend taking your yoga hike in Woodside.", "author": "jessy l."}

I love finding hidden spots in SF. I don't do yoga often, though I have been doing the Dailey Method intermittently. Still, what's not to love about a hiking/yoga combo?\n\nAs it turns out, nothing.  It is awesome.  I highly recommend it for locals who don't know about the garage that looks like a castle in North Beach, or about any number of parklets sprinkled down alleyways or up narrow stairs.  I also can't think of a better way for someone from out of town to get a true SF experience, not to mention phenomenal views.\n\nI joined the Hiking + Yoga + Dinner series kickoff for Cinco de Mayo.  After our 4 mile power walk with yoga breaks from the Ferry Building up Vallejo stairs through North Beach and up to Coit Tower, we then strolled down to Union St. to find our group's table ready and waiting at Don Pistos (which was fantastic and deserves its own review).\n\nWhile the \"we've burned 1000 calories\" is a bit of hyperbole, the workout was sufficient.  Yesterday would normally be a run day for me, but walking up hills and holding yoga poses worked different muscles, so yay for cross training.\n\nIt is easy to get in touch with your inner yogi in a nice, enclosed studio.  Try centering when doing the downward dog in front of tourists. I think there is something to be learned here about getting over being so concerned about what other people think.  I don't know if that's a part of yoga, generally, but certainly is in this class.\n\nHighly recommended.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

My friend bought a Groupon for me and I didn't look up the Yelp reviews prior to the hike.  This is definitely a HIKE with a little bit of yoga thrown in.  Don't get me wrong, I loved it, but it is not for the faint of heart.  It was a pretty hot morning and the sun was beating down on us while we power walked and stopped four times to move through our yoga poses.  According to my GPS pedometer, we walked a little over 3-1/2 miles in 90 minutes.  The pace is VERY fast.  If you thought this was going to be a little walking through a pretty park and mostly yoga, you would be very wrong.  And by you, I mean me.  Other than making sure you have a towel for the dripping sweat and plenty of water, I would also suggest parking somewhere other than 90 minute or two hour meters.  The hike went a tiny bit long and we had to leave early to get back to the car to avoid a ticket.  So BART in or take the time to find neighborhood street parking (or find a lot with longer term parking).  After a hike like that, you don't want to miss out on the final delicious stretch and centering around the peaceful water fountain.\n\nSide note from my second attempt to do hiking yoga:  If you are going to be late, don't bother showing up.  My BART train was delayed and I should have been only a few minutes behind the group.  The poor girl apparently doesn't know her lefts from her rights and told me to meet them in the wrong spot.  I was practically running to find them, only to determine later that I was headed in the wrong direction.  It was frustrating and I was never offered a make-up date.", "author": "Lori M."}

We met at a convenient spot on campus a few blocks from BART. I think there were 14 of 17 sign-ups who showed and that's a pretty good turnout. We started on time. Christiane was considerate and waited a few minutes for the last folks to show but when they didn't. she got us out there and moving. And move we did. The Berkeley hills are just that, hills, and Christiane was clear that we would be getting an aerobic workout along the way. Love it! For the first part of the hike, we all stayed pretty much together, and when I stopped to take photos and got behind a bit, I ran to catch up but the group had slowed down to wait. Kind of the \"no man left behind\" thing. During the hiking, we passed some pretty spectacular homes with lush gardens and expansive lawns, lemon trees, and blossoming cherry. The vista views, which we caught on several occasions, were pretty awesome. It was clear and sunny (but cold and windy at the start so I'm glad I dressed in layers and could adjust as needed). \n\nWe stopped at four different locations along the way to practice various yoga poses, and I appreciated how Christiane gave each of us a bit of personalized attention as well as demonstrating how we would do these poses in an outdoor environment. The mini-mats didn't come out until our final stop when we needed them. I loved doing tree pose facing these enormous trees encircling the park where we stopped. I really felt one with nature and it was an uplifting moment.\n\nI also loved the \"take a poem\" house. People are so cool. Someone just digs poetry and wants to share it with the world (or at least their little corner of it). We pretty much each went up and took a sheet from the board or basket and tucked it away like a fortune.\n\nWe ended about 15 minutes later than the scheduled 11:30 but Christiane let us know when it was 11:30 in case there were people who needed to leave. I don't think anyone wanted to. We really were having a good time.\n\nSo, in my opinion, a must do if you are into nature, hiking, yoga, the outdoors, checking out new locations, taking photos, shooting the breeze with new friends.\nWell worth the price. Professional, organized company. Great guide. Time well spent.\n\nMy friend and I went over to the Sunshine Cafe afterwards for a simple breakfast of eggs, roasted tomatoes and organic brown bread.

At the end we go to choose between one last brutal (again, temper 'brutal' with the knowledge of my current fitness level) incline or a relatively flat walk to the ending spot at Grace Cathedral.

Our particular walk up Vallejo Stairway, Greenwich Stairs? to Coit Tower, down the Filbert Steps, was a good workout - I was mildly sore in my calves after. Eric says the route changes, but I'm not sure how often I would want to do it, perhaps every so often.

This workout is a must for yoga enthusiasts because it takes the experience from the stuffy, staid studio outside while providing a natural stimulus of fresh air scent from the local gardens, green grass and bay breeze.  This is not a cake walk; you will get a significant cardio push while pausing intermittently for some yoga exercises in between. \n\nEric, our leader and instructor is perfect for this sort of thing.  He knows the nuances of the city, especially those hilly streets and stairwells surrounding the North Beach neighborhoods.  He's not type A, but a great motivator and just a good guy who enjoys the experience.

You need to have some cardio endurance because the walk is brisk and about an hour with many breaks. The entire hike is about 90 minutes. It is just a great way to see the City and areas you'd never imagine going. We saw the most gorgeous city views. A great couples thing to do, too. Try something different, and you will be pleasantly surprised. Our instructor was Eka, and we really enjoyed him. Learned so much about breathing and different energy flows. He taught us about healing injuries of various sorts from carpal tunnel to bad knees along with how to live as an urban yogi. Two thumbs up!", "author": "Lisa M."}

Christine, went fast enough to keep the advance people engaged, but not too fast that the rest of the group couldn't keep up. We stopped at 3 different spots along the way to do some light yoga and stretching. Gorgeous views all throughout the hike. Dress in layers. You WILL be sweating. I would probably bring a water bottle, because there might not be a drinking fountain til the end. For sure, the most I've accomplished before noon. LOVE IT! :)", "author": "Kate C."}

We get to 'hike' throughout the city, up and down hills and then stop in several places and do yoga.  Felt very refreshed afterwards and calm.  Greg is an ama zing instructor.  Strongly recommend taking the class!", "author": "Smriti S."}

We formed a group for a birthday celebration to have Eric, of Hiking Yoga, treat us to a session in our home turf of Santa Cruz, CA.  Without ever having been to DeLaveaga Park, Eric scouted the area, communicated professionally and flexibly with me, got the weather to cooperate, and led a fantastic experience of hiking and yoga.  We all especially loved the partner work.  Eric creatively dealt with muddy trails by coming up with lots of standing yoga poses and by using mats on top of picnic tables.", "author": "Allison C."}

After everyone checked in she told us we would be going at a fast pace and stopping at the Rose Garden. My friend and I got stopped at a traffic light and saw Christiane almost running up the street never once looking back. It felt like she was on her own hike! We yelled after her since we got caught at a red light. By the time we were able to cross she was way up the hill and when we got up there we couldn't find anyone. We asked someone for directions to the Rose Garden and when we got there the group wasn't there! We ended up staying at the Rose Garden a while and then left down hill. What a disappointment! When I got home there was an email saying that we should take cardio training beforehand! She was totally rude and we never got to experience hiking yoga. I heard SF is much better, but after that experience, I'm not rushing over there. I'd recommend go on your own hike and take a yoga class. There wasn't any interaction with the other people, and Christiane clearly was doing her own thing and didn't care about the group.", "author": "Marjorie W."}

My favorite aspect of the hike is discovering new things about The City- hidden alleyways and vista points, walking through neighborhoods you usually don't walk through is great, helps give you a whole different perspective on San Francisco.", "author": "Oleg Z."}

We started off immediately with a nice brisk walk and before I knew it we were going up hills and passageways I never knew existed. the 1.5 hours flew by even though it was raining. It was such a unique way to see the city and get my exercise too. Can't wait to try it in San Francisco too.", "author": "Ellis K."}

I would (and have) recommended hiking yoga to any friend or co-worker, whether new to the city or a long time resident, who loves the city and enjoys a good workout. I have been yoga-hiking five times now, and thanks to the instructor Eric's endless knowledge of off the beaten path trails and spots around the city, it has been a new and exciting experience every time. Hiking yoga is a rare, uniquely San Francisco work-out that combines the beauty of San Francisco's urban environment with the fun and challenge of both yoga and hiking. I would describe hiking yoga as having three equally-awesome components (with the first two being implied in the name):\n1) Hiking yoga includes hiking at a good pace up and down the hills of San Francisco, moving through the FiDi, Chinatown, North Beach, Knob Hill and Russian Hill. Eric is flexible as to the number and location of the hills, so if you have something particular you want to explore or challenge yourself with let him know. However, the hiking component is definitely intended to get your heart rate up and burn off those garlic fries so you should show up expecting a cardio workout. \n2) The second component is yoga. Each hike includes three different yoga stations, which are usually flat spots with incredible views. The yoga is used to break up the challenge of the hiking, so yoga usually occurs every twenty minutes or so after some strenuous uphill. I was pretty much new to yoga and felt somewhat lukewarm about it before hiking yoga, but standing scenic spots around the city, I really enjoyed yoga for the first time. Eric has a lot of experience teaching yoga, so he also helped me to feel comfortable and pick up yoga technique quickly.\n3) The last component is kind of a sight-seeing/city tour aspect because the instructor is also a city guide and knows tons of information, historical and present, about the city. Since I am new to the city, Eric worked in everything from Grace Cathedral to Caf\u00e9 Trieste. He also seems to know a lot of cool spots and facts that even long-time SFers on the hike were not aware of.\nGroups range in size (usu. 2-5) and the price is totally affordable (currently $15 for 1.5 hours and $10 your first time). \nHiking yoga embodies everything that is great about SF and I will miss it dearly when I move away!!! Appreciate what you have here and check it out!", "author": "Aurora S."}

Eric and Megan were good leaders with lots of knowledge of the City.  I loved how they took us through parks and scenic areas of the City I was unfamiliar with.  It was quite a workout with a fast hoof up the stairs to Coit Tower and beautiful cool down stretch with yoga poses at the top and meandered through hilly and shady spots through North Beach and Nob Hill.  It's a fantastic way to spend your Saturday morning with the Ferry Building Farmers Market at the end.  I would highly recommend it and do it again!", "author": "Ruby B."}

Eric is great and knows about fabulous stairways and nooks...It kicks your butt so it's not good for couch potatoes...though I did hear him say that he adjusts the level according to how the group is doing...two of us were huffing and puffing at the back but we caught up at the yoga stops.  Loved it.", "author": "Julie G."}
