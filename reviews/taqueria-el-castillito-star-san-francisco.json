No where else have I had such good Mexican food (though I haven't been to South America yet!).\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't feel this restaurant lived up to the standard in other places around town.\n\nFirstly, the area is not the best. I can't blame the restaurant for that but it would be much nicer if they took card. There's currently a cash machine by the entrance but since it's not from a brand bank (and once again since the area doesn't feel the safest), I don't feel especially comfortable taking money out.\n\nRegarding the food: I was recommended to try the California burrito-which I did-but I wasn't satisfied. It tasted pretty bland. The portions where big so that's a benefit I guess. \n\nWhat really put me off though, was the apparent hygiene and sanitary standards. To get the nachos, clients themselves grab a little bucket of chips from a pile of these buckets. You inevitably touch other people's and this could be instantly improved by just handing it to people. Someone else's review also mentioned a cockroach or something. I don't think this is too crazy considering the look of the place. I think a deep clean is in order.\n\nThe staff were nice and helpful though, a redeeming feature of the restaurant. Also, I think some of the other burritos could be good - I was put off by the apparent sanitation and may have judged the food too early.", "author": "Michael C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-25", "description": "A BOMB ASS BURRITO IN THE TENDERLOIN?!?!?\n\nAmidst all the Vietnamese and South East Asian Restaurants in Little Saigon lies El Castillito, an unassuming taqueria where you can get one of the BEST burritos in SF! For the price of one bowl of pho, you can get a GIGANTIC burrito enough for 2 meals. Skeptical? Yup, I was too...\n\nOver 2.5 years ago, when first I moved to the public sector, some of my co-workers raved about this taqueria in the TL. After having an awful case of food poisoning, I was weary of taquerias especially one that was located in the TL. Plus, back then I wasn't an avid Yelper, so it didn't even dawn on me to Yelp it.  So while my co-workers would grab a burrito at El Castillito, I would go to Saigon Sandwich at the corner to grab a banh mi.\n\nFAST FORWARD 2.5 YEARS...\n\nI owed one of my friends dinner and he wanted a burrito, so after a quick Yelp search it led me to El Castillito. It was close to my work and with an overall 4 Star Rating, I thought I give that a shot. As per Yelper's recommendations, I got an Al Pastor Wet Super Burrito (burrito smothered in a red chili sauce, topped with melted shredded cheese, sour cream and slices of avocado). It came with free chips and salsa. The total was just ~$7.50! I had to carry the heavy box with two hands so my clumsy self wouldn't drop it. I later get a text from him saying, \"Where did you get that burrito? It was the BEST burrito I've ever had!\" Ok, now my suspicions were alleviated.\n\nThis was 2 weeks ago and since then I've come to El Castillito twice for their Lengua Burrito. I get it with no beans and with avocado. For just $6.04 (including tax), I have two mouth-watering, coma-inducing meals. \nPic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RF-ciAQlmV2BO4lVvmfrkg?select=sa_3eNwjrk5asAn2gyZo8Q \n\nThe burrito is GIGANTIC with a 70/30 ratio of lengua to rice. Packed inside a warm, soft freshly grilled flour tortilla skin is lengua SO soft that it melts in your mouth like buttah and is perfectly seasoned to bring out its natural rich beefyness. The seasoned rice is al-dente, yet soft and the accoutrements of pico de gallo and cilantro gives the burrito moisture with a burst of freshness while the thick slices of avocado add a layer of butteryness. \n\nBeing a muscle, lengua can often be tough and chewy. If cooked properly, lengua should be soft and more tender than a fine filet mignon. So, lengua is normally my go-to meat to test how well a taqueria can prepare and cook their meat. The braised lengua at El Castillito BEATS the one from El Farolito, Pacho Villa, El Toro, and Taqueria Guadalajara; just to name a few. And it's second best to the lengua at La Taqueria which is much pricier at smaller portions. So, if you're a lengua fanatic like myself, you MUST try the lengua burrito at El Castillito!\n\nThe tortilla chips are nothing to rave about as they taste store bought, BUT make sure to grab several containers of the Salsa Verde--it's like liquid crack! The salsa verde is fresh, rich and creamy from the small bits of avocado and adds a nice, mild kick to your burrito.\n\nSOME THINGS TO NOTE:\n\n*CASH ONLY (there's a Wells Fargo ATM next door)\n*Closes everyday at 10 PM\n*The area is sketchy so try to find parking on Golden Gate or on Larkin where there's more foot traffic. Even though Hyde is just a block down, it's a lot MORE sketchier.\n\nHuge, mouth-watering burrito BUSTING with meat at the seams? CHECK!\nLiquid crack salsa verde? CHECK! \nDirt cheap prices? CHECK!\n\nDon't let the location fool you (like it did me), El Castillito is truly a hidden gem in the TL!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

If you'd like, you get a handfull of tortilla chips tossed into your bag, enough to have a chip with almost every huge bite of deliciousness.  You can also grab a little bit of red or green salsa.\n\nI can't finish a burrito to myself so I always eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner.

Last time I checked, SF sales tax was 8.75%. According to one friend, I was probably given a \"special\" tax , perhaps because I \"had a nice looking coat on\" or because I had my $10 bill out and ready to pay (eager to eat as I was).\n\nI ordered a torta listed as $5.85 and got a pepsi for $1.15. Let's check the math -- $7.00. After sales tax, the woman at the register rung me up for $8.75. HUHH? Anyway, I paid it, and as I sat down, did a double take in my head over the transaction that just happened. How did I get taxed almost $2 on a $7 meal, when a coworker that ordered after me was only taxed .82 cents on his $9+ meal? This was not the first time this happened to me here either. This was the second time, and I realized today that the first occurrence was probably not a little one-time slip-up that I should have let happen.\n\nThis is how the conversation went with the cash register lady after I went to ask about the \"odd\" tax on my meal. FYI, I am not the type of person who shouts at people in customer service when I'm upset, so I did this politely:\n\nMe: Excuse me. Can I have a receipt for my order?\nHer: Oh no, I don't have any receipts.. heh.\nMe: Um, OKAY... well, I'm wondering why I paid $1.75 in tax for my torta and pepsi.\nHer: *stares at me* Okay...\nMe: My coworker only paid .80 cents in tax for more expensive food, why was my tax almost $2 more?\nHer: *shrug and silence*\nMe: Is the torta $5.85? *looks up at $5.85 listed price on board*\nHer: Uh... no. It's $6.25. So see, you're total was $7.40. Okay?\nMe: Well, that's still not right.\nHer: I don't know. *awkward look, then looks away*\nMe: Fine, okay.\n\nI lost my appetite right away, and my uneaten torta is sitting on my desk. It will be eaten of course (don't waste food, folks) but not anytime soon... I'll probably give it to my boyfriend or my mom. I'm boycotting this place for good, which is really too bad because the food itself isn't that bad.\n\n...But discriminatory taxing and feigned innocence when you're caught leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Make sure you don't get cheated if you come here. So much for a \"cheap\" lunch.\n\nP.S.

It's spacious enough if you and some friends have time to sit down for a meal, and I've never seen more than 5-6 people in there during the evenings (I tend to drop by between 4P~6P). The staff here is gracious enough and pretty laid back. They've miffed the occasional order due to not paying attention, but never to the point where it grew annoying. Refried beans instead of black? Whatever, it's cool, man.\n\nThe food itself is good, and I've never had a bad experience in that regard. It seems slightly pricey compared to some of the other places I go to, but that may be because it's so close to the Federal building and the courthouse - taking advantage of those government types who need their Mexican fixings. Proportionally, the amount you get is alright for the price; it's difficult to finish an entire super burrito which is in the area of $6.\n\nOverall I've never found a reason not to come back to El Castillito, at least on work days when I'm in the area. There aren't many decent, cheap places to eat in the area, and this is one of the very few.

I feel like they over salt the meat because it is not fresh, and they don't want it to go bad.  It never looks to clean to me, so I'm always afraid that I'll get food poisoning from the veggies.  I proceed with caution to say the least.  I prefer a more carefree burrito experience because I do enjoy eating.  It stressful to calculate my risk as I make each selection.  \n\nWith all that effort, I just go to the one on McAllister.

I've been equally pleased with both the carne asada and chicken versions of the burrito, and will undoubtedly soon be tempted by the carnitas dangling alluringly from the spit.  You have your choice of fillings, and definitely go for the spicy salsa.  The first time I bit into an El Castillito burrito, I thought they had given me the white girl version of the spicy salsa, but a few more bites past the chopped tomatoes and onions and into the coarsely chopped peppers proved otherwise.\n\nPerfect for lunch with enough left over for dinner.\n\nUpdate: I am adding an extra star for the fact that they always are really cool about letting me take my dog in with me for my take-out orders (and judging by the guy asking me if my burrito was to go or for here, perhaps letting me eat inside with him?!)

There's another one closer by, but these guys are much better and well worth the couple blocks' walk (and after eating one of these guys' zeppelins, you'll need it).\n\nI went to another taqueria nearby to try it out. That was a mistake--they fumbled with the ingredients and left me with a rather bland, poorly-assembled burrito that took forever for them to put together. That sort of thing will not happen here. El Castillito's taqueria-ninjas assemble hefty burritos with lightning speed and precision that reminds me a Japanese sushi chef, or the German soccer team taking penalty kicks. The carne asada is pleasantly juicy, they're good about grilling your tortillia before making your burrito, the salsa is spicy but not overpowering (you can get it with mild salsa if you wish; they're also good about asking you what you want), and the overall experience is truly satisfying.\n\nFavorite dish: super carne asada burrito, $6.35 out the door. I can finish one in one sitting if I'm fairly hungry, but I don't really need to eat for another ten or twelve hours.", "author": "Adam E."}

This is critical... nothing pisses me off more than these half-assed taquerias that add cheese last (on top of the cold salsa, etc.)\n\n3) They actually throw the meat on the grill once more and get it all hot and crispy.  What a concept!  Again, half assed places spoon it right out of the soup....unacceptable.\n\n4) They use slices of fresh avocado...way better that guacamole.  Especially when you're adding onions and salsa anyway.\n\n5) They add cilantro on top of the meat....amazing.\n\nAll in all, they have the assembly of these things down to a science.  Every ingredient is prepared to its optimal flavor and then added to the burrito at the perfect stage.  The whole thing comes together in an orgy of flavor.

Now that I am blessed to work in the TL, its a regular lunch time stop. My personal fave are the quesadillas, because they are basically rice-less grilled burritos, and completely delicious.
