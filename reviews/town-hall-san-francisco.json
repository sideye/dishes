Glad we went!\n\nThe venue is nice, service was friendly, and the food was nicely presented and was quite good. \n\nWe all ordered different cocktails and the fried chicken sandwich. I chose to get the Blushing Mule and opted for chips as my side for my entree.\n\nLoved my order! Cocktail was tasty and refreshing. Fried chicken sandwich had a lot of great components to it too (taste, juiciness, great bun and chicken) though the apple slaw didn't stand out at all in terms of taste or texture. The slaw got lost in the spicy aioli and the crunch of the fried chicken breading. Chips were average, wish I was given more to go with my sandwich. \n\nOverall, this was a great experience! I'd love to go back to try more things.", "author": "Sofia R."}

This is probably (and please correct me if I'm wrong because I want more HH before my commute!) the closest happy hour to the new Salesforce Transbay Terminal. Earlier this week, there was an accident on the bridge that prevented any buses from getting into the terminal for the start of rush hour. We were told to take BART or wait it out. I decided to look for a tipple and keep an eye on Google maps to see when traffic cleared. First check: 2.5 HOUR delay. Yikes.\n\nI ordered an $8 HH red wine. It was the Velvet Devil Merlot from WA which I've had before. Not great, but serviceable. Also got the blackened shrimp for $9, pretty nice, would order again.\n\nThe bar was crowded, but as long as you get a seat, you should be fine. They are busy here, but it's not too hard to flag down a bartender when you're right in front of them.\n\nTraffic was down to a 30 min. delay, so I asked for a slightly dirty gin martini, bartender's choice on gin. He opted for Plymouth, which is a solid, solid choice. A well-made cocktail, olives were tasty, and it was $12 when I got the bill--absolutely reasonable for the area.\n\nI also tried the fried chicken tenders. Would have liked more seasoning in the batter, but the texture was good, and if you're into sweeter sauces, the Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce was fine.\n\nThanks, Town Hall, for making a bad situation slightly better :)", "author": "Lydia C."}

Perfect, I thought. Given the prime noon time slot, I expected the restaurant to busy. Within moments of sitting down, we immediately ordered our food and drinks just to be safe. 10min passed, 20min passed, and before I knew it, it was already 12:45pm and our food had not arrived. Even water and drinks took a while to get to our table. When we finally flagged down our server, her only response was that this was normal for the noon crowd.\n\nWhen the food did arrive 50min later, I was so darn confused. I ordered a full portion of salad and a side of chicken, yet the tiny amount of salad on the plate made me question if they even got my order correctly. The salad was well seasoned but the chicken was dry and had no flavor. And of course at this point, I had 5 mins to scarf down the food and pay for the meal, which did not add to the fun.

I hadn't done much research of the menu ahead of arriving, and I was catching up with a client that I hadn't spoken to in a while, so I ended up panicking a bit when it came time to order. My client chose the fried chicken sandwich, which the waitress mentioned was their signature dish and staple of the restaurant since it opened in 2003. After asking for a couple other recommendations to avoid being unoriginal and getting the same thing as my client, I too chose the fried chicken sandwich, given the other suggested options would have caused me to swell up like a puffer fish (due to my seafood allergy). She did also recommend the duck confit (which sounded a bit heavy for what I was up for that day), the Salmon, and the Fried Cod Po'Boy. \n\nThe fried chicken sandwich was a big hit, though it was more than filling, and I didn't have any interest in trying to finish the gourmet chips that accompanied my meal.", "author": "Ravi K."}

SMOOTH, right?  They confirmed they would do it, and because I know they drop the ball on things, I made sure to confirm before lunch got going.  OF COURSE they were stammering and stuttering that they didn't have the info.  So instead of schmooze my client like I'm supposed to, I had to run back to the office for the company card.   FINE. I'd like to add that the manager on duty acted like he didn't care, not at all.

It's like serving a quiche, by making eggs and putting on a dish, making ham and slicing herbs and placing on another dish, and then serving a small glass of cream on the side.

First, big shout out to the bartenders: Kyle and Tara! Those two both made my first experience at Town Hall, the best experience! I met a friend here during happy hour and after looking at the jazzy reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I was quite excited to come here.\n\nUpon approaching, I quickly noticed the construction happening around the area (don't let this discourage you, it's totally worth it). Parking is NOT the best here but it helps that BART and Muni station is 5 minute walking distance and the Temporary Terminal is literally across the street. They have a patio that is right in front of the entrance but the inside is such a great set up! A communal table located near the entrance on the right, bar area on the left, and all the way in the back is the dining area. The inside is very spacious and the d\u00e9cor is attractively decorated and compliments the wonderful, friendly staff. \n\nI hear lunch time and happy hour is golden here, meaning you won't be disappointed! They have a small happy hour menu but it's straight to the point.\n\nTHINGS TO ORDER:\nLunch time- WasSup with that Fried Chicken, tho? OMG, Flavorful, juicy and so pleasing to my taste buds! The homemade chips just compliment it even more! Don't come here without ordering the Fried Chicken, I warned you! \n\nHappy hour-They have a wonderful small menu of different varieties of food. I would encourage you to order the Jambalaya (although it was not flavorful) it was okay, nothing to brag about. Tuna Tartare- very tasty and satisfying! Ask for some of those house-made chips as well!\n\nDinner time: I am telling you now: Roasted Veal Meatballs! (That's all she wrote!) No, but seriously, that dish is DELICIOUS! It's a whole meal of its own, hurry and order it! If that is not pleasing to you and your still hungry call that server over and order the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, this was pretty good as well. Let's just face it; Town Hall serves some delicious ass fried chicken! \n\nThe service was EXCELLENT! My food came out quickly after I ordered and EVERYTHIN' was sizzling' HOT! I had the pleasure of Tara and Kyle serving me and they were fun, attentive and knowledgeable. Make sure you chat-it-up with them! \n\nFYI: If you come with a big group, make reservations!

First off the corn bread, it was a bit sweeter than I expected, though that might have been due to the fact that I missed the word \"corn\" in the menu, so I was expecting a lot more jalapeno flavor. Still, I thought the jalapeno flavor was a bit lacking, and it seemed more like ordinary corn bread. Not bad, just unexpected. Now onto the jambalaya, which was served in a small to medium-sized plastic soup to-go container. While the jambalaya did not skimp out on sausage slices, I think it could have been more flavorful; I was expecting it to be heartier than it actually was. \n\nOverall, I can't say that I had an amazing foodie experience thus far, but I am still looking forward to trying more of their menu, in particular, the fried chicken sandwich.\n\nTL;DR: Jambalaya was ok, but I'm still excited to come back to try their other menu items.", "author": "Ed W."}

I made a booking as I always see how busy it is when I walk past it and thank goodness I did, our reservation was at 6:45 and this place was absolutely packed. \n\nWe had the jalape\u00f1o cornbread for starters - it was good but nothing I would crave again. My friend has the the fish (bass) for her main and she really enjoyed it. I had the chicken and waffles... oh my word, best fried chicken I've had in SF!!!! The waffle was good too but lacked a bit of taste. The portion was huge as well, 4 pieces of chicken and the waffle. I literally brought back more than half the meal back home. Even reheated, the chicken was so tasty. I would definitely go back just for the fried chicken and waffle dish. We had the Butterscotch and Chocolate Pot de Cr\u00e8me for dessert and I really enjoyed this, it was very light yet tasty especially after a full meal. But be warned, there is more butterscotch than chocolate so my friend didn't enjoy it but I like butterscotch so I thought it was good. \n\nThe restaurant is a bit noisy since it's so busy so I wouldn't recommend it for an intimate dinner but for casual meet ups, it's a great spot. We had a glass of wine, a latte, starter, 2 main meals and a dessert which came to about $130. Wine per glass is pretty pricy here. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely go back!", "author": "Damain S."}

They give you a small basket with about 8 small biscuits to go with this cured, thinly-shaved pork plate with a small round of butter and lightly spicy, sweet jelly.  The biscuits are so good, I really can't describe why, they were light, had a light crunchy outside and a comforting, moist inside.  I'm not really one for biscuits because they usually are bland & dry but everyone at the table, (there was 6 of us), said after the meal these biscuits were the best thing of the meal.\n\nSt. Louis Ribs:  6 good sized ribs with a side of bbq sauce.  The meat was perfectly tender & I loved the bbq sauce but throughout biting the ribs, there was a surprising, unpleasant tang of SALT!  If it wasn't for this, these ribs would have been perfect.  I liked the sweet, slightly gritty cornbread muffin and the not too tangy cole slaw.\n\nBerkshire Pork Chop:  The person who had this said it was o.k., a bit bland if it wasn't for the surrounding droplets of huckleberry sauce, (I looked at her plate and all of the sauce was sopped-up, yet there was 25% of her pork chop uneaten).\n\nSide of Fried Okra:  Everyone commented how it was good that the fried okra was light and wasn't overly greasy, but unfortunately it came to our table cold, (not even lukewarm).", "author": "Johnnie N."}

We arrived at a nearly empty dining room, no fault of theirs, it was a Sunday in San Francisco, and the room filled up as it got later. We started off with a cocktail. I wanted something w Canton ginger and a base of either vodka or tequila. The best most lovely pinky spicy cocktail emerged. Margie our waitress said the bartender just made it up. Kudos! Sunday nite is meat and 3, a Southern thing where you order your meat and choose 3 sides. I choose fried chicken, fried okra, cole slaw and summer veggies w lebnah. My husband, prime rib w smashed potatoes, roast corn, and creamed spinach.  My fried chicken was the best I've had, crispy with a flavor that defied my ability to name it. But where fried chicken is often chicken that's been fried This chicken had an extra oomph to it. Ricks prime rib thick and juicy and very little fat very much what you would expect at one of the better prime rib houses in The City. All the sides were excellent. The really nice thing was it was an inclusive 45.00 per person, the prime rib an extra 10.00. For this we got soup or salad...the soup Early Girl tomato...pure tomato essence. I had the salad w chilled bib lettuce & blue cheese. Ok, THEN the Desert! Chocolate mousse w a layer of butterscotch pudding on top and shards of toffee candy. YOWZA. Coffee press and we were more than satiated. Loved loved loved Town Hall. Service good and the flat charge of 45.00 if not a steal, certainly worth every cent.", "author": "Chery C."}

A has been raving about Town Hall's grab 'n go counter which he has been frequenting via MealPal so we decided to try the real thing. We had a bit of a hard time finding the entrance but once we were inside, we were sat promptly. The interior of Town Hall is beautiful and warm. I wouldn't necessarily say it is modern but its not dated either. I felt really cozy here with my only gripe being that the bathrooms are in the second floor next to the private dining space but, if that's the layout of the restaurant, so be it.\n\nAnyways, we decided to order a round of drinks in addition to our meal. We had:\n\n-Rosemary's Baby ($13): This was mine and it was delicious and light. I really enjoyed this cocktail and especially the beautiful vivid color!\n\n-Town Hall Old Fashioned ($13): This is what A had and he liked it but didn't really taste all of the special flavoring such as the bacon or maple. I liked it better than a usual Old Fashioned when I sampled it, personally.\n\n-Bacon Wrapped Trout ($28): My main and it was GOOD. Especially with the cornbread stuffing. The dish was a bit rich but it was really yummy and I finished it even though it was a bit of a struggle. I highly recommend this but I was a bit freaked out by the fish head on my plate.\n\n-House Smoked Ribs ($27): This was A's entree and it was DELICIOUS. He demolished it. The meat was tender and the sides served with it were delicious. Neither of us personally LOVED the BBQ sauce that came with it since it was too sweet but that's a minor gripe.\n\n-Butterscotch and Chocolate Pot de Creme ($10): We split this for dessert on the recommendation of other Yelpers and they're right, this is a show stopping dessert. It is HUGE and with the candy on top, I felt like we were having dessert chips and dip. A bit rich but you should know what you're getting into when you order a dessert like this. We definitely looked like barbarians eating this but it was totally worth it.\n\nThe service at Town Hall was quite attentive and we got our food and drinks promptly. We didn't even have time to demolish the bread basket (yummy sourdough at Town Hall!) that we usually do which was probably better for our waistline. I am taking off a star since I think we ate something we didn't necessarily agree with at Town Hall. Neither of us had food poisoning but we didn't feel great in the middle of the night or the morning after. We did go to a few bars after dinner so that may have been a factor and I don't want to accuse Town Hall of anything. Just something to keep in mind. It also may have been that the food was so rich that we had issues since we aren't used to eating food like this. Regardless, we definitely plan to come back and recommend it if you're in the area.", "author": "Carrie W."}

They won't take your order until everyone in the group has arrived, and the last person ended up coming around 12, so we didn't get our orders taken until about 12:15. Being that a couple of us had a hard stop at 1, this made for an extremely rushed lunch for us. By the time we got our food, we had to also ask for a box to take back half of the meal as we didn't have enough time to eat it all. I think overall they should have had more staff working. This place filled up extremely fast during the lunch rush and I don't think the service could necessarily keep up with that pace. \n\nAs for the food, I got the Faith's Ham and Cheese toast. I guess I should have deduced from the description that it would just be a slice of toast with some stuff on it, but because it was listed under \"Sandwiches\", I assumed it would be more of a hearty meal. I would describe this dish like an Eggs Benedict, but with only one egg and one toast versus the two that you would normally get with a full meal. The dish was ok. The first bite was tasty, but after three bites, the sauce and the flavor became a little redundant for me. On the other hand, my bf got their pastrami sandwich which was definitely a very hearty meal. He took half of it back, and the sandwich was still good the next day, even when cold.  \n\nOverall, while this place is a decent place to come to when you're not in a rush, I was less than impressed with my experience here and wouldn't make this my first choice if deciding on a spot to eat in this area.", "author": "Anita L."}

The biscuits were mediocre - small, a little dense, and just didn't taste very fresh. The bulk of the meal was sauce and pork fat, with little bits of meat floating around in it. Honestly, it looked like some kind of pet food. The meat chunks were good and tender, but the flavor was mostly lost in the overly-sweet sauce. The cole slaw was fine. Very disappointing. Maybe the lunch deals are not representative of this restaurant's potential, but I'm not inclined to return and find out.\n\nCoworkers went for lunch today. Tried the fried chicken sandwich, which was good but not great. The slaw was bland and the pickles were very sweet, without any salt or spice to contrast them in the chicken.

The egg was poached perfectly however the choice of bread was not enjoyable. I couldn't tell you what it actually was due to how soaked, dense, and soggy it was from the sauce. Every bite was very heavy with no elements in this dish that adds brightness or freshness. \n\nCrispy okra - This is a side dish so you may overlook it on the menu. This was my favorite of the three! Piping hot okra fried in a cornmeal batter. Crunchy, crispy, savory, and not too slimy on the inside. Well balance of texture.\n\nDuck confit salad - The duck was overcooked.

Food has never disappointed.   And hey, that was a one time thing, right?!?!   But oh man, was this time so much worse.  \n\nOur waiter was a mess.  He asked us each thing two or three times.  Like would take a drink order, then leave for 20 minutes and come back to ask what we wanted to drink.  It was 40 minutes from seating to getting to place an order.  If it weren't for bus boys, we'd have never even had water or bread.    And even that was at the 30 minute mark.  \n\nEvery time we flagged him down to ask for the thing we'd asked for three time before, he actually rolled his eyes or seemed put out.  He literally got not one thing right all night. In a two hour stay (should have been about 50 min) we never once got refills on drinks, despite asking three times.  The order came out wrong, after him clarifying it twice after we ordered, and someone else tried to fix.   We actually heard him doing the same things to the two two tops next to us.  We were all in shock. At first we laughed. Hahaha, 30 minutes to order a Diet Coke and Arnold Palmer.  Then comedy turned to shock and then to rage.  \n\nThen, as if this couldn't possibly get worse.  He charged us for two alcoholic drinks, which we obviously didn't order.  He came back with two manually modified receipts.  However, both charges are pending and he didn't credit the first ones back.  So, it seems, Town Hall will be charging me twice for the same meal, only this time, they'll also be charging me for drinks I didn't have and an experience that was possibly the worst in SF. \n\nThe only redeeming thing was, as always, the food is very good. Too bad I cannot possibly go back ever again (except tomorrow to again get a fraudulent charge reversed).\n\nUpdate: Nicole just called to apologize.

A few that I recommend is their fried oysters with glazed pork belly and their BBQ Shrimp on top of toast and spiced sauce poured on top. \n\nA real popular entree is their Town Hall fried chicken which comes in 3 pieces of breasts and potato & spinach salad. The chicken is crispy and fried to perfection! I think they should just serve the whole bottle of Crystal hot sauce rather than inside a small cup. I also recommend their ham selection. The Tenneshootoe selection is the best! It's served on a wooden cutting board along with four fluffy mini biscuits, honey butter, and killer jalape\u00f1o jelly. Mix all of these together on top of the biscuit and it's on a whole different level of tastes. \n\nI recommend trying a few cocktails of their menu as well. They have special cocktails that are definitely worth the try such as their Town Hall Old-Fashioned (bacon-maple infused whiskey). End your night with ordering a dessert. I suggest having their Butterscotch and Chocolate Pot de Cr\u00e8me. This dessert is super delicious. It's almost like a fusion between custard, ganache, and pudding.

Here is a rundown of what we ordered:\n\nDRINKS:\n\nHe had the RUE 342. I'm not big on Gin but he is and he really like it. \nI had the Clipperton.

I don't like huge ones so i asked for smaller ones. \n\nFARRO VERDE RISOTTO: i'm not big on vegetarian options, but even i ate some of this. The risoto and corn and gouda. It all went so well together.\n\nFRIEND CHICKEN & BUTTERMILK WAFFLES: to. die. for. the fried chicken had a crispy batter that was well seasoned and the inside was so tender and juicy. it wasn't oily or greasy at all! the waffle was fluffy and the honey and butter just brought everything together.\n\n\nWARM JALAPENO CORNBREAD: you must get this to share for the table. it didn't even need any butter. The jalapeno gave a bit of flavor but it wasn't overwhelming. \n\nWHOLE ROASTED CAULIFLOWER: i wasn't a big fan of this, but thats because I don't really like curry. It wasn't awful, i just wouldn't order it again for myself. I did have a few bites. the currants and pepitas helped, but without it the curry flavor was just too much for me.\n\nAside from the food and drinks, the service was great! everyone was super friendly, i didn't feel we waiting long for anything.

I reserved a large group  in advance. They have a 24-hour cancellation policy, which makes sense, especially for bigger parties. 3 days before my reservation, I tried to cancel online, but was informed I had to call the restaurant. I did, twice that day and left a message. I repeated this efforts every day, until the day of, when I finally got a hold of an individual who informed me that it would be removed and because of my efforts/voicemails, there would be no fee charge. 7 DAYS AFTER MY CANCELLED RESERVATION, I have a charge of $120 on my card. I immediately called the general manager and requested it be removed. He assured me it was. A week later, it was still there. I called again, this time a lady assured me it'd be removed. Still a charge. I understand it take a few days sometimes for refunds to go through. However, with the outstanding card charge, I called a 3rd time, again explaining my situation and wondering why it wasn't removed. Manager again confirmed the refund. It is now 17 days after my cancelled reservation, and now I am getting the refund. It took me too many phone calls to make sure that they were being responsive. It should have been addressed without my worry the first time. Every call, it seemed that people did not communicate with one another and the restaurant was rather unorganized in that sense. Mind you, they were very courteous on the phone, but I feel that they should have taken a little more responsibility for the mistake. That was time I had to take to constantly check my transactions. I've heard many good things about Town Hall and their food  (especially the mac & cheese!) and it makes me sad that this was an issue. This review is meant as a word of caution, and also as a trigger to hopefully better manage FOH and BOH operations so that any hiccups in performance are not reflected in customer interactions and/or can be better resolved.

I have been Yelping for less long and today I went here for a grab & go sandwich and wanted to update my review and I was not aware of Yelp back in 2006.\n\nIn more recent years -they have a \"grab & Go sandwich stand outside. Friday is Fried Chicken and I while I was a bit disappointed they were pre-made, by the time we went across the street and found a place in the shade to enjoy them, they were still warm and I believe superior to either The Chicken Coup or The Bird.\n \nMy OLD review as posted on the Check Please Bay Area site in 2006 is copy and pasted below:\nI've read reviews that say Town Hall is not the kind of place you should go for an intimate date, HOWEVER, I contend that anyone who takes me on a date here is a superstar!\nThis is one of those places that feels like a big hug when you walk in. Everyone, from the hostess, to the wait staff, to the guy who fills your water glass, is professional, gracious, and welcoming without being stuffy or pretentious. This is exactly the kind of experience I want when dining out.\n\nThree of us started with one of their specialty cocktails, these are a treat -- beautifully presented, and not for the faint of heart, as they can pack quite an alcoholic punch.\nSince I'm well aware of their hearty entree sizes, our table spilt three appetizers. We ordered the tomato fondue, which my niece and nephew promptly scarfed down, the crispy tempura-battered squash blossoms bursting with four kinds of gooey cheese, and my favorite appetizer in the world: Faith's warm ham and cheese toast with the jalape\u00f1o cream, topped with a perfectly poached egg (probably a heart attack on a plate, but worth the coronary every time).\nThe braised short ribs were my entree choice. As expected, it was a generous portion, fork tender, beautifully presented, and yummy. My sister had the fried chicken. Tasting one bite wasn't nearly enough, I now want to go back ASAP and order it all for myself. (If I close my eyes as I write this, I can almost taste the crispy, blistered skin, and the super tender meat -- excuse me as I wipe the drool off my keyboard). Each one of us cleaned our plates, which is no easy feat.\n\nOver the years, I have developed a scientific \"hierarchy of desserts\" ordering protocol -- a gal has to have a system for important decisions.\nIn order of preference:\n1) Anything you have to order BEFORE the meal (this is rare)\n2) Anything served warm3) Anything chocolate-based\n4) Anything that is \"seasonal\" (e.g. pumpkin at Thanksgiving time) OR anything that is a regional specialty\n5) When all else fails: cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nBased on the hierarchy, I took charge of dessert and our table spilt three. We ordered the sticky toffee pudding, the jelly doughnut holes, and \"SF's best hot chocolate\" (I concur, it is SF's best!) Not a bite was left on the table. It's a close call, but I boldly elect the doughnuts as best in show.\n\nThe space is open with a lofty, New England feeling. Every detail is thoughtful -- from the rustic breadboxes to the way they present the bill inside an old library book. It is the kind of place I take friends who are visiting from out of town (even my snobby NYC friends!) For a few years, my quest has been to eat at every top 100 restaurant according to the San Francisco Chronicle (the count to date is 49) and this remains my all-time favorite place to dine in SF. I've been to Gary Danko, and Boulevard, among others, but there is something special about Town Hall that keeps me always wanting to go back.", "author": "Amy W."}

Table service was slow as well, our waiter was very nice and accommodating during the times he acknowledged us which saved the whole experience from being a complete bust. Ordered the cod and it came out completely raw in the middle. I really hate sending food back - but had to in this case. They seemed overly accommodating with this and very apologetic, management sent over complimentary champagne and an appetizer while we waited another 30min for our entree. They did offer to keep my date's food warm while we waited which was a kind gesture. Chicken and waffles is what he had, and it was wonderful although a very large portion! Favorites were the friend Okra and our waiter who was friendly and that's about it,... took about 30min to get our bill after finishing up.

Who does that? This happened three times! He poured a taste of Pinot for my friend and then, after she asked for a glass, he forgot and we had to remind him (I was already halfway done with my glass of bubbly). He was rude to other servers and just seemed WAY over is head. I understand that bars can be hectic, but WE WERE THE ONLY ONES AT THE BAR and he wasn't busy making other drinks! Regardless, it shouldn't be the guests problem - get your bar in order and hire people who can handle it. He was sloppy. Period.\n\nHe didn't write down our order and then came back 10 MINUTES LATER to ask us again because he forgot everything except for one main dish (we ordered 5 items) ! Again, unprofessional and unorganized. If you can't remember an order, then write it down. Quit trying to pretend to have skills that are beyond you.\n\nOur food was mediocre at best: fried okra (tasted like something from Denny's), BBQ shrimp (drowned in a sauce that made them sickly sweet), tuna tartar that was warm and tasteless. Sald was drenched in dressing. Yuck. The one decent items was the side of grilled zucchini.\n\nOn top of everything, I got a message from Opentable saying we never checked in - we certainly did - with the hostess - and told her we had a res but would be sitting a the bar instead - she nodded, didn't say a word, and walked away.\n\nWe expected more from Town Hall.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-16", "description": "Back when I first started Yelping, Town Hall was one of the most popular restaurants in SF.  It felt I would hear nothing but good things about the food and reservations always seemed to be a tough get (at normal dinner hours, anyways).  But now?  Oh how times have changed.\n\nNow, I don't necessarily mean that in terms of their food, though I have nothing to compare to.  Rather, I mean in terms of their popularity.  There still was a decent crowd on a Saturday night, but it wasn't exactly a full house either.  Not that I should really complain, since it meant we were able to snag a table for six the afternoon of.  Plus, I finally got to knock Town Hall off my list!\n\n-- TUNA TARTARE with Cornmeal Fried Green Tomatoes, Garlic Chips, Tabasco Green Onion Vinaigrette...$17\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=2IRYGeuG-2GwCRFsKmdbWQ)\nOverall, this was a pretty solid dish.  Although the tartare didn't amaze, it was still pretty decent and I liked the varied contrasts of the dish - the saltiness of the sauce, the freshness of the tuna, the spice of the vinaigrette, and the fried crunchiness of the green tomatoes.  \n\n-- TENNSHOOTOE, TN (?) COUNTRY HAM...$18\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=IT4YBScgybGabBO4IiGuww)\nI *think* we ordered the Tennshootoe ham, but I'm not sure (my friends picked).  In any case, while I didn't get to try the biscuit (my friend said it was \"ehh...okay\"), the ham was good!  The cuts were sliced ever so thin, tender, a bit smokey, and just slightly salty (in a good way).\n\n-- ROASTED VEAL MEATBALLS with Potato Puree and Green Peppercorn Sauce...$15\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=Y8bVLI1u56PaeDGwU7UO1Q)\nA perfectly fine rendition of a classic combo.  The sauce was great (really peppery/flavorful) and I liked how the meatballs had a nice balance between meaty and light/moist.  Despite all that, I'm not quite sure the dish warrants the price, especially since it wasn't all that amazing.\n\n-- BBQ SHRIMP with Worcestershire Sauce on Garlic Herb Toast...$17\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=RMSpacSdBzuYyAwwaJXRGQ)\nNot a bad dish, but, for $17, I was surprised it only came with one piece (albeit topped with a good amount of shrimp).  Even though the shrimp had a nice char on it, inside of the shrimp felt a little overcooked (not very juicy).  I did enjoy the toast (and sauce) quite a bit though.\n\n-- BUTTERMILK MARY'S FRIED CHICKEN with Baked Beans...$27\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=gpEcWOBDRp1q1rYpbjUB0g)\nAs a whole, the sides were just okay.  I don't recall their exact description, but I do know that the beans were fairly bland.  More importantly though, the chicken was terrific!  All three pieces were juicy, moist, and delicious.  Plus, the batter was just right - not too thick, not too thin, and very crispy.  Not sure it's the best fried chicken I've had, but it's up there.\n\nWhile the menu does change often, some dishes seem to stay the same or see only mild changes (e.g. the fried chicken is a staple, but the sides will vary).  In any case, there is an abundance of starters and entrees to choose from that is both modern and classic.  Just like with the decor, which makes Town Hall great for just about any occasion, from work dinners to dates.\n\nTHREE AND A HALF STARS rounded up, though I initially wasn't so sure.  Town Hall is worthy of four stars based on food alone, but the prices for the starters is a little steep (good thing we were all sharing!).  However, considering how easy parking and reservations were, as well as how nice the service was, Town Hall is still more four stars than three.", "author": "Mike L."}

Town Hall, however, is in one of the old buildings of the financial district with soaring ceilings and old beams. It can get quite loud in here when it's full and at lunchtime it definitely is. With lots of big groups and work parties, this is one of the few places in this neighborhood where you can meet someone for a nice lunch.\n\nMy friend and I decided to share a couple of things, a cheese and ham with egg on top, and the Cobb salad. When the waitress took our order, she asked if we wanted the entree sized salad? Now, the entree sized salad is not on the menu, so we didn't know how much it was or the difference between that one and the one on the menu. So there's this awkward moment before we ultimately say yes. \n\nThey split the salad for us and both were almost the size of an entree. A piece of fried chicken, boiled egg, fresh steamed green beans, and sweet ripe tomatoes. I think it was the best Cobb salad I've ever had but we were both full by the time the egg toast came. This was a strange dish. A ham and cheese sandwich swimming in a Chanel sauce with a fried egg, still runny, On top. There was no way this would travel so we had to eat it even though we were full.\n\nWith one iced tea, this was a $45 lunch. A bit pricey but worth it if the company is good.

Passing this place on a daily basis, I knew this was on my list to try. What a perfect opportunity!\n\nThis stand alone building sits in the middle of what seems like huge skyscrapers. You walk in and you're immediately warned that this place is an upscale dining experience. Exposed brick with eclectic art and chandeliers show some personality. Our server was super nice. You can always tell when you're in a fancy place. Service is somewhat relaxed in that they don't really bother you throughout service. It only becomes  a problem if you really need something, as most times they're not even around. We experienced that a little during our service. Not bad though, just noticeable. \n\nFor starters we got:\n-Cornmeal fired oysters, Herbsaint spinach puree, Hobbs' bacon and preserved lemon for $15. It was served on a bed of salt. The oysters were good and I liked the fried element. Kind of thought, they did a whole lot more of presentation than what the taste was actually worth, in my opinion.\n-Faith's warm ham and cheese toast with a poached egg and jalapeno cream and sides of fried green beans for $14. Now this was AH-MAZE-ING! No fluff to this dish. Just plain ole ham and cheese with eggs and cream sauce. Only difference is, the flavor was on point and so worth the dollar value. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n\nFor dinner I go:\n-Buttermilk fried Mary's chicken, collard greens, cornbread pudding and sausage gravy for $27. I wasn't a huge fan of this dish. My chicken was a bit dry although I did like the collard greens a lot. The cornbread was interested. Huge chunks of corn and it was a bit sweet. I guess I was expecting a traditional cornbread. To me, if you're going make a spin from the classic, it better be good. \n\nOverall, the place was OK. I would like to try this place again and give it another shot because I didn't NOT like it.

We placed our orders and the food didn't take very long to arrive. We ordered the stuffed piquillo peppers which were by far the best thing we ordered. The flavors and textures were perfect. For my main course I went with the ribs, which were good.... Flavor was good, fairly tender.... But they weren't anything I'd go out of my way to get again, they were served with an amazing corn bread, like possibly the best corn bread I've ever had.... Which may have had a great deal to do with the butter it was drenched in, delicious! The ribs also came with coleslaw, which wasn't overly watery... But I basically took one bite and let the rest. Over all the service was decent.... But at some point between the app and the main course our waitress asked if we wanted another round, I told her what I wanted and for whatever reason she automatically assumed my friend wanted the same exact thing  or nothing and QUICKLY walked off before he could place an order. Giving her the benefit of the doubt I assumed that she assumed he didn't want anything, but a short while later two of the exact same cocktails came out. I was very specific and said \"I WILL HAVE\" not we, don't automatically assume that just because one person would like something the other person wants the exact same thing.

As far as location, ambiance, and options - it could go 3 1/2 - 4 stars - but for me the food wasn't spectacular. But you don't have to trust me, there is a lot of stuff I do not eat so my options were VERY limited. Even then, I ordered a goat cheese salad and the goat cheese came in breaded, fried balls. Since I don't eat gluten, I had to eat around it. Benefit of the doubt here - I didn't specify gluten free. But the menu didn't say breaded and fried.\n\nSince there are so many options around, I probably won't be back. It was worth a shot, though.", "author": "Jess A."}

There will be none for you on the return. It is spectacular! Buttered, moist, slightly dense with a hint of spice. Oh and there are surprise bits sea salt on top. Amazing!\n\nThe food is delicious and the servings are enough to share, or bring the rest home. My group ordered the cornbread and fried okra for appetizers. Who orders okra as an appetizer? I abhor okra. As in I wouldn't touch that slimy madness if it were the last piece of nourishment on earth! Town Hall's fried okra changed my world! The batter was light, not fried to a crisp, but certainly not flaky. Right in the middle perfect. I was rehabilitated! The Aioli sauce was a nice compliment, though  clearly not needed. \n\nFor my lunch choice I went with the Crab Cake BLT. Served on French bread, the crab cake rests in between a remoulade sauce (similar to an aioli or tarter sauce depending on your taste preference), bacon, butter lettuce and grilled tomato with a side of house made chips. Wow! One, I couldn't finish the entire sandwich because it was so big. Two, it was soooooooo good! The crab cake was moist without being watery. The bacon complimented the soft texture of the crab cake perfectly. The chips could have had some salt on them. But hey, there's always table salt. \n\nBased on the location you can expect most of the diners here to be lunching buddies or partaking in work meetings. I was part of the work meeting crowd. Keep this in mind, as the restaurant can easily be on the louder side. At a table for 5 I had to lean in to hear the person at the head of the table. Their service is a well oiled machine.

Good luck there. A (not so) quick tour through Open Table led me to Town Hall, which at least has a good quantity, if so-so quality, in its Yelp reviews.\n\nNaturally, we arrived promptly at our reservation time, only to be told that the table earmarked for us had a group of people wholly unwilling to depart anytime soon. Thus it was that we found ourselves at the bar for about an hour, waiting for that reservation which was supposed to undermine said wait. (Somewhat) luckily for us, the manager and host were profusely apologetic. We were comped our (very delicious) craft cocktails at the bar, and brought a couple of appetizers gratis as well. I do recommend those crispy okra. Or was it green beans? My memory fades.\n\nYelp describes Town Hall as American (New), but fancy southern could also be apt. There's a distinct southern influence that permeates the menu, but it's just an influence, not the overwhelming taste and flavor. For example, the barbeque shrimp, my favorite of the appetizers we ordered, had that southern flair but didn't exactly scream N'awlins to me. Oysters are west coast, not Gulf, although that could just be season (or, more likely, proximity).\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my main course, the Yelp-approved fried chicken. Buttermilk coated, the chicken came in a faux cast iron and was thoroughly huge. Three chicken pieces atop a large heaping of mashed potatoes has my seal of approval. All the mains were big plated and hearty, which I get fits the Southern style.\n\nAll in all, Town Hall reminded me of the proliferation of comfort food slash American New restaurants that permeate Chicago. Out there, Ruxbin does it best, but Town Hall is also very reminiscent of places like The Bristol and Carriage House, and much better than overpriced downtown joints that shall remain unmentioned.\n\nBut was it worth the hour wait (even with comped alcohols), when we could have picked somewhere more lauded sans reservations while waiting at the bar anyway? I have to say no to that.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}

The flavors came together really well, the texture somehow light yet heavy (in a good way!). But the buttercrunch pieces were WAY too hard, and when sharing the dish we had a tough time breaking them apart. They should be broken up smaller.\n\n* Caramelized Banana Icebox Cake (toasted cinnamon filo, chocolate fudge sauce. $10) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=tZ6akpkh5IHjDYODPifP5g#XO5h_F8AqQq7QV5NuPnNNQ\nI thought the banana filo cake was great, but I didn't like the frozen aspect of it. I think it would've been a lot better at room temperature, and it being frozen seemed really out of place (as if they'd taken it out of the freezer and forgotten to give it time to thaw). It made the filo a little too crunchy, the cake a little harder to bite into and break apart to share. I couldn't taste the cinnamon too well; it could've had a much stronger balance to be detectable against the strong banana flavors.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

For the amount of money they charge, and the terrible customer service, go elsewhere.  There is a reason why other $$$ restaurants need to be booked far in advance, and this place you can get a reservation the same day.\n\nSpecifically beware of ordering a glass of sparkling water.  My friend did, and the next thing we know we are charged $36 for 4 bottles of bottled water.  The food was average or below average in my opinion.  The cornbread is covered in salt...shouldn't it be served with a sweet honey butter.  Salt is a complete contradiction to cornbread.  The tuna tartare was average at best and the fried green tomatoes had a terrible aftertaste.  I had the rockfish and it was so bland.  Don't they taste their food before it comes out of the kitchen?????\n\nAnd don't waste your time advising them that you have a special birthday.  Because they bring you out a sort of defrosted cupcake with frosting that is still hard like a rock.  That is cheap...why wouldn't they serve you one of their fresh desserts????\n\nNot everything was awful, one person loved her fried chicken and my other friend is on a very strict diet and they were very good about working with her...but how difficult is it to fill a plate with asparagus and arugela.\n\nThen to top it off the restaurant manager argued with us, not once but twice and actually followed us out of the place and told us how many times we interrupted him, while waving his fingers in our faces and telling my friend \"you interrupted me twice!!!!!\"  If a restaurant screws up this badly, don't you think their job is to be apologetic and offer some good will...anything a free dessert, another opportunity to come in so they can make it better for us, a glass of wine...anything.

It's located in the Financial District of San Francisco and seems to be a place where you can easily grab a table for a good meal. That being said my meal was also on the company dime so look up the prices before you stop by to make sure they are within your lunch time budget.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've dined at this establishment once.\n\nFOOD: I ordered the Beer Battered Rock Fish Po' Boy. But let me back up. My boss also ordered the Tuna Tartare, the Heirloom Tomato Salad, Warm Jalape\u00f1o Corn Bread. Now growing up I was not a corn bread person but I'll say, get the corn bread if you can. That was delicious. Actually all of the starters were wonderful. I may have enjoyed them more than the entree. Not to say the entree was bad by any means. The Po' Boy was a good sandwich, I've just been to New Orleans (the home of the Po' Boy) and experienced the best. But this is still a good sandwich. High quality ingredients all around that lead to a great food experience.\n\nDRINK: Even though my meal was on the company dime I only had water. Town Hall did have a selection of alcoholic and fountain drinks that I'm sure would satisfy anyone looking for something in that beverage category to quench their thirsts.\n\nATMOSPHERE: I wouldn't say anything special stood out about the Town Hall atmosphere. Just your standard big restaurant that looks fancier than your average big restaurant. Tables, a bar, and wood. Its not bad, just nothing spectacular that I noticed.\n\nSTAFF: The staff was incredibly knowledgable of the menu and offered several suggestions to a large group with a lot of questions. I truly appreciate a waiter than can not only offer suggestions but offer suggestions that turn out to be good. I was very pleased with the service.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable (but I didn't have to pay!).\n\nTown Hall was a great place for a work lunch paid for by someone else. I don't know if I'd stop by here just for a normal meal unless I suddenly get a nice promotion. I wouldn't mind stopping by again to see how they handle happy hour.

Always a plus!\n\nI tried to order as many recs from my fellow Yelpers as I could. In order of best tasting to just okay:\n-Cheese & ham toast\n-Fried okra\n-Cornbread\n-Fried chicken \n-Tuna tartare\n\nLet's go from bottom to top starting with the tartare. It was a bit too salty for me. The fried green tomatoes that came with it were a nice touch. Next, chicken. I know, I know this might be controversial because I think they're known for their fried chicken, but it wasn't too memorable IMO. The batter was too thick for my liking. Although the meat itself was juicy, the thick coating of batter made me feel like I needed ketchup or another kind of condiment to wash it down. Does that make sense? They do give you a tiny cup of gravy but I don't usually eat gravy with fried chicken (sue me). But shout out to those potatoes gratin! Best thing on the plate. If they offered that as a side I'd order it in a heartbeat.\n\nCornbread was good. Couldn't really taste the jalape\u00f1o but still yummy. Next, okra! That cilantro aioli makes that side! It is superb. If I were them, I'd bottle it up and sell it to the masses. They'd make a killing. Last, but certainly not least, that famous cheese and ham toast. Lemme tell you, people. It lives up to the hype! Some parts were crispy, some soft. Toasted cheese here, stringy cheese there. And the jalape\u00f1o cream, the friggin cream! I'm sure it's unhealthy as a mf'er but it is to die for. Two thumbs up!\n\nOnly gripe was the wait time for our entrees but our waitress did inform us about how packed the kitchen was and always stopped by to give us a food update. Can I just say that all service people should do this! Customers truly appreciate being informed of reasons for delay. 9 times out of 10 we will understand the issue and go with the flow. I've worked in the food industry for over a decade so I completely understand hiccups in the figurative (and sometimes even literal) machine. So service is top notch!\n\nBottom line, will I come back? Probably not. Alright, alright. Don't get your panties in a twist. My reasons are financial. It's not your typical diner; you have to shell out some of that paper if you wanna eat here . However, I do highly recommend this to all the full-pocketed individuals out there.

For dessert we had the butterscotch and dark chocolate pot de creme, gingerbread?, and hot chocolate. The hot chocolate is a medley of 3 types of chocolate much like the ones you would find in France. It was rich, very rich and it came with a mint french macaron.

The smooth cream with a little jalape\u00f1o kick compliments the crispy toast and the flowing yolk from the poached egg... adds intensity to the flavour. I'm not even going to mention about the fried okra. \n\nButtermilk fried chicken was so tender and cooked to perfection. Good quality chicken was used. \n\nGood sized meals and the bartender was very nice and attentive. \n\nThe gentleman next to us ordered the BBQ Shrimp and I can't get my mind off it. Will be back very soon to try it out.  \n\nI'm adding this place as one of my favourite place for comfort foods in SF.", "author": "Bomin K."}

Walking in the whole place had the vibe of a restaurant long passed its prime, I can't put my finger on exactly what it was, but I assume the city agrees given that we were able to get new years reservations on the 30th.  One of the waiter's was dressed in an all red outfit complete with top hat and shirt unbuttoned halfway to his navel (probably not coincidentally later in the night I heard him having a tough time with his nasal spray in a bathroom stall).  \n\nI ordered the bacon old fashioned and asked them to go easy on the maple simple syrup. What I received was kind of a weird chalky tasting mess. My friend's girlfriend asked for a normal manhattan because she did not like bacon, the server then proceeded to put both hands on her and thank her for being the first person he had net who did not like bacon, it was just creepy and weird.\n\nThe food was unremarkable in that it was essentially bad across the board. I had the fried chicken which for 30 dollars you would expect for quality higher than KFC, sadly, it was not to be. They fried oysters were overbreaded and did not taste fresh. There really was not a single dish that we enjoyed, combined with the poor cocktails and service I don't think I will ever be returning.", "author": "Norman A."}

Since starting my current position on Treasure Island nearly 8 years ago, I have lunched at Town Hall probably 25+ times.  It happens to be the closest restaurant for me to reach directly off of the Fremont exit when crossing the Bay Bridge, but it's strength rests in it's kitchen and not just it's location. \n\nOver the course of my many lunch visits, I have splurged on a number of 3 course leisurely meals as well as 'in-and-out' bar counter meals, and they have always delivered on all fronts whether or not I had time constraints.  I've only visited for a few dinners but those have been great as well.  From the delicious Acme breads, to their soups, butter lettuce salads, ahi tuna tartars (w/fried green tomatoes) , jalapeno cornbreads, to delicious chicken sandwiches and fish entrees, I have never had a disappointing experience.  Of course some meals I have enjoyed more than others, but there was never a meal with any sort of disfunction- everything is well orchestrated, generously sized, very well presented, and very flavorful.  \n\nBiggest win in the area and best bang for the buck.  Street parking isn't too bad within 2-3 blocks of the restaurant during week days.  Reservations recommended for parties of 2+ as there is a pretty packed house for lunch, but there are also a number of bar spots as well as a large shared table, so it's usually not complicated to get a spot fairly quickly.  I'll surely be back again soon.", "author": "Andy S."}

The ahi tuna tartare appetizer was spot on, but aside from that the rest the dishes we ordered were far below standard. We ordered the new york steak, seafood stew, and the salmon. I asked for my steak medium rare and it came out medium to well done... so i sent it back. They brought it back and it was STILL pretty much well-done. At this point i didn't want to send it back yet another time, so i just sucked it up and ate it. The salmon was way over cooked as well, and the seafood stew was just alright. If it wasn't for everything being over cooked, i think the flavoring of their dishes were pretty good. \n\nGood thing we ordered 2 bottles of wine - definitely the highlight of our meal :)", "author": "Angela K."}

Luckily, she was able to pull through!\n\nThe fried chicken is some of the best I've ever had. It comes with three pieces: thigh, breast, and drumstick. The chicken was fried perfectly without feeling greasy leaving incredible tender meat inside. I'm all about the dark meat, but even the breast was heavenly. \n\nSo why the three stars? Our group of 16 ordered everything on the menu and had a little taste of everything. Aside from the fried chicken, I thought everything else was mediocre southern food.

I could tell it was a delicious cut of meat by the texture, and it was cooked perfectly, but I could barely taste anything besides the overly spicy glaze (that had hints of sweetness, which if anything made the steak taste further disappear). The squash and beans as a side were minimal and unremarkable.\n\nMy SO got the mahi-mahi, which he said was good, if too mild, but the broccoli rabe was too bitter compared to the other tastes in the dish. The tuna tartare was fantastic, thankfully. The cornbread had good texture and was delicious with the salted top, but it had tiny chunks of jalape\u00f1o that could barely be sensed. (Where is the spice there??) The two specialty cocktails were unique and tasted great.\n\nRegardless of price, I thought the food was far below average.

It was dead. A sign of recession or were people still at work? It was both.\n\nWe waited by the bar thinking the host was going to come back anytime and one of the servers did say that the host was coming back. However, after waiting and standing for a good 15 mins without the infamous host coming, the one of the token male bartender told us that they don't open their dining until 6. Hmm, that would have helped... communication folks!\n\nWe then decide to seat at the bar to get drinks. They had all of Hanger One's goodies so that was plus. However, their female bartenders...perhaps it was their time of the month but damn, they were snappy and not at all \"happy\" - we waited until two of them finished talking (of course, how dare us patrons, interrupt their conversation!) In my head, they're really scoring points in my book!\n\nWe get our drinks, then finally gets seated. Our moods changed since our server and bus boy that helped us were far more friendlier than those bartenders! Thank goodness!\n\nS.O. and I ordered the following:\n- Buttermilk biscuits, Prosciutto de Parma, red pepper jelly = Wow! This was delicious! They gave plenty of prosciutto...it also came with two buttermilk biscuits but you can order more if your party is bigger.\n\n- Beeler Farms pork chop, creamed spinach, crispy cheddar grits, white peach chutney, tasso = S.O. and I both ordered this... and my gosh, it was a freaking pork chops! It was huge and looked good BUT looks are deceiving. Our pork chop was tasty and flavorful but it was hard. I wished it was tender... chewing was chewy but the white peach chutney did add a new flavor to the dish so that was good. \n\n- Butterscotch and Chocolate Pot de Cr\u00e8me topped with buttercrunch = WOW oh WOW! This was delicious! Our server told us that this is one of their signature dessert so we had to get it and boy, that was a good recommendation! The butterscotch just melts in your mouth and it was creamy and just the right sweetness. Having the buttercrunch to scoop the butterscotch, divine!\n\n- Town Hall's Coffee and Doughnuts warm brioche donuts, Blue Bottle coffee ice cream, chicory streusel = MY FAVORITE! Our bus boy told us that this is his favorite because it just melts in your mouth and he wasn't wrong! The doughnut holes was a good portion for two and the ice cream just went hand in hand. I actually wanted to finish this but opted to share it with the S.O. \n\nOverall, it was a good evening shared with my  S.O. but I'll probably opt out to go here for drinks/dessert rather than dinner. \n\nBig props for the S.O. for doing research and for continuing our date night routine!", "author": "Cath M."}

I'd been here before on a business lunch and left feeling pretty satisfied, so when a good friend of mine swung by town last Thursday and mentioned Town Hall as a good option near where he was staying, I was eager to try it out for dinner.\n\nI arrived early and grabbed a drink at the bar. Service here was quick, courteous, and efficient, and there's an extensive menu of cocktails, local and French wines, and local and mainstream bottled beers. \n\nThere was a bit of a wait to get seated in the main dining room. Other guests remarked upon this too; although the restaurant was fairly busy, it was not seated to capacity. We were greeted promptly and ordered quickly after sitting down. I opted for a tuna tartare starter; the only thing I noted was that there wasn't much flavor to it except a notably spicy kick to it. Although the starter was served quickly, the main courses came about 45 minutes after we were seated. I opted for the pork tenderloin, and it was a solid and fulfilling, if not particularly memorable, choice. My friend appeared contented with his choice of the ribs. For dessert, my friend had the key lime pie, while I had the chocolate almond torte. Although the torte seemed a bit small in portion at first, its sheer richness more than made up for it. \n\nMy friend, who is even more of a discerning foodie and global jetsetter than I am, agreed that while Town Hall is a good, dependable choice that is usually worth 4 stars, our particular visit merited 3 stars because of the slower service and an okay, but not exceptional, taste/quality/value proposition. There are many other good options for dining or drinking, whether for business or pleasure, in the SOMA/Ferry Terminal vicinity and just a short walk away in the Financial District.", "author": "Vincent L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-03", "description": "I dined here with a friend and got a lot of the food. We started with the pear and celery soup, then moved onto the bbq prawns, pork tenderloin, hangar steak, and finally the fried chicken. The food was all quite on point and the service was good even though our waiter (JD) got his whole section seated about the same time. I will admit there were a few times I looked around for someone to grab me something but that's just during the busy 8 o'clock hour so nothing to cry about there. \n\nAfter we finished the GM, Bjorn, was kind enough to wander over and chat with us for a minute. He was incredibly nice (JD was too just so y'all know) and gave us a free dessert which was pudding with maple/chocolate pieces in it. I was very happy with the hospitality and the gesture. \n\nOverall, each dish was good but not the best in the city. \n\nThe soup was probably my favorite dish overall despite my love of all things meat. It had a lovely creamy texture and \"thanksgiving stuffing\" flavor that made me want to eat it all day. Alas the bowl was shared between my date and I and I only had a small and delicious portion. \n\nThe bbq prawns were cooked perfectly and the sauce was wonderful. (I don't like seafood) but they were cooked very well and the overall flavors were awesome. \n\nPork tenderloin came out with brussel sprouts and some sort of masa/corn/potato balls that I didn't read about on the menu but they were good(although slight too dry).  The pork was charred on the outside beautifully but pretty raw in the middle. I don't mind medium rare but it was on the rare/uncooked side. Tasted good but was a little concerning. \n\nThe steak was cooked medium rare (much to the despair of my date who encouraged medium well) which was quite tasty. It came out with broccoli, charred peppers, and some potato cubes. Not the best steak but definitely enjoyable.  The actual piece of meat was very high quality though.  Actually I can think many better steaks in the city but that's ok becuas it's not a steak house. \n\nFinally, the fried chicken ....... People.... Just come here and order a soup to start and the chicken to finish. This was legit. I HAVE had better.... But barely. This fried chicken is exemplary! I would have eaten the whole portion if it had not come as the last dish. Whatever the potato cake side that comes with it is also great but the chicken.... Ohhhhhh the chicken.... I want to stuff my face with it all the time now! \n\nOverall our experience was great. The only reason for four stars instead of five is because we waited here and there for a few small things and there was some food that was not the best. Again, everything was great but not five star status. \n\nWill definitely be back at some point.", "author": "Nick V."}

I've dined at Town Hall previously, but wanted to come back and try the ham and cheese toast since it was added to the 7x7 list this year. I made reservations for a Friday night easily only the day before, which isn't always a good sign for a restaurant. Town Hall was pretty busy when we arrived, but they were able to seat us right away. We ordered:\n\n-Strawberry, White Peach, Field Greens, Thai Basil, Cornbread Croutons, Balsamic Reduction ($15, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=AEYh52RZsJQAO_lp2w0Fyw#AEYh52RZsJQAO_lp2w0Fyw): Really good, and I liked the combination of the strawberry, white peach, and basil in this salad. It was perfect for a hot summer day, and I would order it again, although $15 is a bit pricey.\n-Faith's Warm Ham and Cheese Toast, Poached Egg, Jalape\u00f1o Cream ($14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=AEYh52RZsJQAO_lp2w0Fyw#cMd1n6j4aE1X2S1fElqi6A): Yum! I felt this was a worthy addition to the 7x7 list, although I don't think I could eat this dish more than once a year since it's so rich. The egg was poached perfectly, and the jalape\u00f1o cream sauce was creamy and delicious. Highly recommended if you like creamy sauces.\n-House Smoked St. Louis Ribs, Texas Jack BBQ Sauce, Corn Muffin, Stevie's Coleslaw ($25.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/town-hall-san-francisco?select=AEYh52RZsJQAO_lp2w0Fyw#aB_lz2a0VUxiEziGWPvGiQ): They gave you a HUGE portion of ribs, which were tender, but the taste was just so-so. At least they tasted better once dipped in the BBQ, but the corn muffin and coleslaw were bland and disappointing. \n-Butterscotch and Chocolate Pot de Cr\u00e8me (Topped w/Buttercrunch, $10): We were too full for dessert this time around, but I had this during my last visit and it was delicious! They give you an entire bowl of pot de cr\u00e8me, which was smooth and creamy. It was a little on the sweet side, but I still managed to eat at least half. Highly recommended if you enjoy desserts.\n-Bank Note Scotch ($9): I loved that they had an extensive spirits list, and I chose Bank Note since I hadn't tried it before. It was surprisingly smooth for a cheaper scotch, and I would order it again.\n\nOur server was friendly and attentive, which was nice. My biggest complaint is the location of their bathrooms- you have to walk to the front of the restaurant and upstairs to use them, and there are only 2-3 stalls. Overall, Town Hall is a solid restaurant to dine at in the Financial District, but there weren't any dishes I feel the need to come back and eat again in the near future. However, I will be back for the pot de cr\u00e8me at some point along with the ham and cheese toast. Parking in this area was surprisingly easy to find on a Friday night, and we didn't have to pay for the meter since it was past 6pm (there was no Giants game that night).", "author": "Amy D."}

The food is off-the-charts delicious and the service, in my opinion, is on point. Wood Tavern is known for their fried chicken and it does not disappoint. My husband loved his fried chicken and said it was one of the best he's had. We also ordered the tuna tartare (yum) and the farro risotto. The risotto left something to be desired. It was tasty but in essence was basically a small mound of rice loaded with root vegetables. When I say loaded I mean LOADED. Hefty portions are always appreciated but the amount of relatively bland vegetables in comparison to the rice made the dish underwhelming.  Again, still tasty and very light but not the classic Town Hall dish I've come to love and appreciate. So my suggestion for dining at Town Hall is to stick with the classics (fried chicken, cajun shrimp, meat platter) and if you're a vegatarian/pescatarian the Sole is always a crowd pleaser and their vegetarian side dishes are awesome!", "author": "stephanie c."}

SF always has great restaurants. Unfortunately, this did not meet the mark. \nReservations were for 8:30 and we got there around then. We checked in with the hostess and I must say, she didn't seem too pleased to be there. But whatever. We waited at the bar area for a while. There were many parties who came in after us and were seated. I thought it was weird and we waited a bit longer. Finally about 20 min later, we checked in again and hostess said our table wasn't cleared yet. But then 5 min later sat us outside. Now this wouldn't be so bad, but a) it was cold and b) only 2 of the 7 or so tables were taken- so we waited for nothing. I was annoyed as a reservation should probably mean a table inside.  \n\nWe sat down and already had drinks. We got out menus and the food was somewhat Southern focused. We ordered the scallops & pork belly, biscuits, and the fried chicken to share. Scallop dish was a bit disappointing- small scallops, 2 pieces of pork belly and a cold lentil salad with it. Scallops were not as great as at other places. \nBiscuits- best part of the meal! We got 5 mini flakey biscuits with prosciutto and a spicy jalepeno jelly on the side. Amazing.  \nFried chicken- eh. Much better at Brenda's Soul Food. You could totally see the grease and there was no real flavor. The jambalaya it came with was really spicy. \nDrinks- forgot the names but both of them had a kick. \nI probably wouldn't come here again. If I was real southern food, I know I can find better.

He managed to get the kitchen to throw together a brussell sprout appetizer for our table (which weren't on the menu at the time) and we also shared the fried okra. He made great drink recommendations as well as helped us figure out what entrees we'd enjoy. I went with the fried chicken which was way better than I expected, and I had good expectations. I didn't care for the succotash that came with it, but I did like the mashed potatoes. I'd definitely return and recommend.", "author": "Candace R."}

These were my first wings with cheese on top. In addition to mellowing out the spice, the cheese added lot of great flavor. The toasted pepitas added an awesome crunch, and the herbs were very refreshing on top. \n\nThese wings got 5 stars. The toppings balanced out perfectly, hitting spicy, sweet, savory, herby, and cheese flavor notes. The wings were perfectly cooked. As a note, if you get a little nervous about seeing red near the chicken bones, you might want to ask them to cook it extra. A few of our chicken wings had red near the bones. \n\nI had the burger with the fried egg on top too. Fantastic!", "author": "Sue Y."}

Definitely much smaller than I was imagining for the price. However, it's worth the \"splurge\" every once in a while because the cod was amazing! It melted in my mouth, and the chili oil wasn't spicy (thank goodness for me).\n\nMy main issue was with the erratic service. We were on a 1-hour lunch break, and our waiter was attentive at the beginning. He came back to take orders before we even looked at the menu, and then he disappeared for nearly half the meal. We resorted to flagging down a waitress after 10 minutes of waiting since we were on a tight schedule, and our waiter only came back once or twice to serve the food which took at least 15 minutes to prepare.

It has never been one of my favorites, but living 2 blocks away means that it's convenient and usually a solid choice. On this occasion, I booked a table for 4 to celebrate my brother's birthday with family.\n\nI had actually checked earlier in the day to see if I could add a couple more people to the table, but was told that the restaurant was full. I was disappointed to see that the main room was almost completely empty when I arrived.\n\nNow, I won't fault the staff for slow service because I was not in a hurry. But I did have issues with every course - from the cold, hard biscuits with the sliced ham to the stale, fishy flavor of the oysters. I then had my first real mistake when I received a salad with bleu cheese that I had specifically asked to be excluded. I waited for the server to come by so I could ask for a correction (minor inconvenience), but when I didn't see him for over 15 minutes, I found a manager and asked for some help.\n\nFollowing a brief conversation with the server, the manager brought over my salad and the cocktail I had been missing. It was then that the server came by and - without a word or smile - slammed down utensils for the table, including steak knives. While I never felt threatened, I thought it was unacceptable behavior. I ask the manager for a different server and did not have any problems with service again.\n\nBut the damage was already done. As a courtesy, a couple of cocktails were taken off the bill, along with the salad. But I was already done with this place and paid the bill - forgoing the complimentary dessert that was going to be sent out.\n\nI refuse to ever return to Town Hall. I've had entire meals comped for less egregious errors. I've seen management respond quickly and thoroughly to use mistakes as a learning experience. I have a hard time believing that Town Hall cares about customer service or employee training after what I experienced.\n\nPROS\n- Convenient location with valet parking\n\nCONS\n- Horrible service\n- Drinks were on the sweet side\n- Oysters did not taste fresh\n- Only decent thing I ate was the sliced ham starter\n\nTIPS\nRead recent reviews carefully to see if they've addressed the problems with bad service; otherwise, avoid at all costs.

We started with drinks and apps, and I managed to sample veal meatballs, fried chicken, and some sort of mushroom spread on bread. They also had a seafood bar and I went wild for the oysters, clams, and lobster tail.\n\nWhen it came time for dinner, we were all seated and went through four courses. We started with the butter lettuce salad, which could've worked well, except mine was drenched in blue cheese dressing to the point that I couldn't eat it at the end because it was way too strong. The warm buttermilk biscuits were our second app, and that was much much better. The sweet and spicy jam complemented the saltiness of the prosciutto very well, all offset by the pillowy biscuit.\n\nMy main was the Alaskan halibut. That dish was spectacular, quite possibly the highlight of my day. The fish had a wonderful crispy skin and the texture of the meat was perfect. The sauce was so delicious that I just wanted to lick it off the plate (which I didn't obv, that would be improper). My bf's new york steak was also pretty good, but I was quite pleased with my fish and left his steak alone for the most part.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the pumpkin bread pudding but switched it out with my bf's pot de creme because the whisky was too strong for me. Both were too sweet and we couldn't finish either dessert, although the pot de creme was marginally tastier. \n\nOverall, it was a great meal with a lovely ambiance. We had a set menu, so I was a little sad that I couldn't try their signature bbq shrimp and grits, but it was still quite lovely.", "author": "Helen S."}

He loves fried chicken and this place is definitely known for it.\n\nFirst off, the food here is amazing! Every dish we ordered was fantastic and didn't disappoint. Rest assured that you're guaranteed a great food experience.\n\nUnfortunately less can be said about the wait staff. Upon being seated, our waiter was friendly and gave us an overview of the menu, telling us that \"everything on the menu is wonderful.\" However, when we expressed interest in ordering some sides for appetizers instead of their starters, we had the oddest experience. To be clear, two of my favorite southern foods are hush puppies and jambalaya. And there, listed amongst their sides, were those two standout items! Of course I wanted those instead of their less impressive starters! So when we suggested that, our waiter shut us down. He told us \"the chef has crafted the menu in such a way to match the sides with the entrees.\" And with that he left us to reconsider. That indeed soured the mood. He then came back and gave us permission to order the sides first...which really set us off.\n\nHere's how it should have been handled - you tell us how wonderful the menu is and how well crafted it is, but let us order any item we want when we want! :)\n\nFor the rest of the meal we were courteous but to the point about things. No doubt our waiter could tell, but I was trying not to let it ruin the meal. Thankfully the food was amazing, including the sides.\n\nIn the end, the waiter did apologize for the incident with the sides. It actually went a long way to making us feel better about the dining experience. I've been to many a restaurant where the service has been lackluster and with no apology whatsoever.\n\nBut I can't stress enough...I'm the customer. I want to eat your yummy food.

It is served with collard greens and a cornbread pudding with a gravy.  The collared greens were the stand-out item.  The bread pudding was not my favorite, more of a texture issue for me.  The chicken was pretty delicious, but for the price it was not amazing.  My husband had the pork tenderloin and it was excellent.  \n\nFor dessert I ordered the pineapple upside down cake, because it is one of my favorites.  Too bad this was not that great.

Our group also ordered the scramble and purgatory eggs.  I had the chicken-tasso hash with poached eggs, topped with pimento hollandaise for $14. This was not good...the bell peppers, yams and onions together created too sweet of a dish.  I had to balance this with a lot of salt.  Bluestem and Slow Club make better hashes.  \n\nBest dish of the visit was the cornflake-crusted brioche French toast with caramelized bananas, whipped cream and bourbon caramel.  This was $12.

It's similar to the banana French toast with bourbon syrup/caramel that Slow Club and Mission Beach Cafe both serve up, but Town Hall one-ups them in execution.

However, I just wish the taste of the food matched the ambiance and impeccable service. There are a handful of Southern restaurants much better than Town Hall in quality (Front Porch, Hard Knox Cafe, Boxing Room to name a few). \n\nWe ordered the meatballs, the fried chicken and the pork shank with ravioli and grits. The meatballs were juicy but lacked much flavor. The fried chicken was crispy but lacked juicy-fattiness. And the pork shank was dry, chewy and moderately hard with a very sweet-glazed flavor overpowering the entire dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-26", "description": "Actually there are two good reasons for me to update my Town Hall review from two years back. The first is the new lunchtime option of an open BBQ in the adjacent courtyard. Available weekdays from 11:30AM to 2:30PM, it opened a month ago with free BBQ for anyone who knew about it, so the line was down the block on that day. Lines have been more manageable these days since thy charge $8 for most of their items like a quarter-slab of the Smoked St. Louis-Style Ribs or the Grilled Andouille Sausage Po'boy. \n\nSince my workplace is very close by, I've since had a chance to try the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Hobbs Calabrese Link Po' boy with Peppers and Onions - both awfully good though my popularity back at the office dipped considerably with my post-meal gaseous state. I say if you're nearby in the FiDi, you should check it out because it was a smart ploy on the part of Town Hall to encourage traffic to their somewhat out-of-the-way location. Kudos for that decision. \n\nNonetheless, my second reason to update my review is that I have finally had dinner here after years of work-related lunches and happy hours at that community table. Jamie W. was rewarded by his boss with a $100 gift certificate, so we decided to have a full three-course meal there. Shoot the works, sorta speak. We went at the last minute, so we took advantage of their front red-tented area where you can sit amid white tablecloths, heat lamps, and like-minded procrastinators who didn't think to make a reservation. And best of all, you get more elbow room and are not treated like second-class diners. \n\nFor our appetizers, we went for two - one a hit, one a marginal miss. The hit was the $12.50 Roasted Veal Meatballs, Potato Puree and Green Peppercorn Sauce - unadventurous but hearty fare with the ground veal nicely prepared (see my photo). The near-miss was the $13 Crispy Squash Blossoms, Four-Cheese Filling with Basil Pesto and Cherry Tomato Sauces - overpriced and oversalted despite a nice concept and rather soggy considering all the effort placed on making it a more delicate treat (see my photo). \n\nSogginess proved to be a slight problem with Jamie's entree of choice - the $23 Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Toy Box Squash, Smashed Potatoes and Home-Style Bacon Gravy (see my photo). It looked like a home run, but I think in their effort to make the poultry moist, they steamed the crispy skin as well. It was still better than most fried chicken you would find in such tony establishments. I went for the $26.50 Peanut Tasso-Crusted Pork Chop, Spicy Dirty Rice, Fava Beans and Ham Hock Pepper Jelly (see my photo). That was one huge piece of pig saturated with way too many peanuts, but it was very juicy regardless. I just wish they warned me about the twine that was holding it all together. I was able to get an unexpected pre-flossing had I not noticed it pulling on my fork. \n\nAs a side, we had the $6 Warm Jalapeno Cornbread, which came country-style in a corncob baking plate. Really addictive. Dessert, usually their hallmark, was also hit and a semi-miss. The miss was the $8.50 Butterscotch & Chocolate Pot de Creme with Buttercrunch Pieces - a well-made but bland concoction more fitting at a retirement home along with jello parfaits and tapioca bowls (see my photo). Nirvana came with the $8.50 \"Rocky Road\", which combined small Chocolate Ice Cream Sandwiches with Smoked Almonds and three Toasted Marshmallows (see my photo). Perfect in its homespun, nostalgic simplicity. We ended up $20 north of the gift certificate, but that's OK. I'm glad we finally had the full dining experience. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...have to admit dinner was a mixed experience, but if I weigh it with the new-fangled BBQ and previous work lunches, it's still at four stars \nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...still like it inside or out \nSERVICE - 4 stars...consistent for sure \nTOTAL - 4 stars...Town Hall, you still have life in ya", "author": "Ed U."}

The risotto was too watery and had too many different ingredients incorporated into it that didn't go well with each other. Definitely not a fan.", "author": "Michelle L."}

The room had to be fairly nice with a view or good lighting, had to be intimate to allow for inclusive conversation (no 20 ft. table!), and of course the food and presentation had to be the finest.  I searched the City, but was coming up short.  Either the rooms were \"semi-private\" (not quiet the same, folks!), high F&B minumums for our small party, or booked for the date/time we wanted.\n\nI finally nailed it down to a few and am I glad we selected Town Hall.  From my initial email inquiry to my site visit to the actual event, Marissa Duncan, the Director of Events & Marketing, was on point - answering all my questions and accommodating our needs.  She worked with me in putting together pricing to maximize our experience within our budget.  She's the best.\n\nThe feedback I received from my Executive (and he's no easy sell) is that the food was excellent, the room and venue were nice and the clients seemed to enjoy it.  I'd say I hit a homerun with this one and I couldn't have done it without Marissa and Town Hall. \n\nIf you're looking for a place to have a nice, intimate private party - this is your place.  And by the looks of it (did my site visit during the lunch hour), it's the place to be with friends or colleagues for lunch!  Man, did the plates look good!!\n\n(By the way, 54Mint was my other choice, and I believe it is worth exploring for future.)\n\n[I say \"not good for kids\" only because I'd hate to ruin the experience!

The food was great.  Excellent selection of wines.  Our waitress was a total pro; super helpful and extremely friendly.\n\nMy two-star deduction is because we were of course sat at the cliche table next to the kitchen.  The table was so awful and in the way that the four top could only accommodate two chairs because its basically in the path of everyone in the restaurant.  Your choices were to either face the busy and noisy kitchen or have your chair basically in the walkway (either way, you had to sit next to your dinner guest because sitting across from each other was not possible).  My sophie's choice?  The kitchen. I can't tell you how many crotches and asses squeezed past our table that night.  It wasn't like we got a discount for sitting there either - this restaurant is expensive.  This table completely diminished the entire experience.

In addition, we had several guests who had food allergies, and they ensured that they would be able to get food that would fit within their dietary needs.\n\nWe had a few food shortage scares and some small hiccups, but the staff were so accommodating by offering us some extra food, drinks and dessert to make up for some of the small inconveniences.\n\n==4 Stars: The space==\nThe private dining room consists of a small bar area that leads to a larger dining room on the second floor. It's nice because it is separate from the main dining area, so it feels more intimate. The area is accessible via a staircase and an elevator. In addition, there are restrooms located on the 2nd floor, so guests do not have to go up and down any stairs. \n\nThe space can definitely accommodate a standing reception of around 50 people. If everyone needs to sit, the space would probably hold more like 30-35 people. We had a few tables with chairs set up. As we were serving dinner, people had to take turns sitting down to eat, but it worked out. I wouldn't recommend any more people than that simply because it can get a little crowded. \n\n==4.5 stars: The food==\nThe food was absolutely delicious. In fact, it was kind of hard to control our guests because they were so ravenous. \n\nWe ordered the veal meatballs (4 stars), the salad (4 stars), the fried chicken (5 stars), biscuits (5 stars) and glazed snap peas (4.4 stars). All of it was delicious. \n\nOne thing that we would have done differently is tried to have been a bit more organized with our guests.

While we were catching up and having some delicious bread, the time passed so quickly. A total of about forty minutes later, we still didn't have our food. The waitress had apologized a couple of times that there was a mix up and the kitchen was preparing the chicken of our grilled chicken salad. \n\nFinally the food arrived, by then it's almost 1:20. As we started to eat, my friend asked if my chicken was spicy and salty. A lady manager came over to apologize for the delay and my friend complained that the food wasn't very good. The manager asked how she could compensate for the mishap and offered some sorbet to us. We declined simply because we had to return to work by 1:30. We didn't have time to finish our food and asked the waitress that we would like to pack the rest to go. When she returned with the bill, she said the manager had removed one of the salads to compensate for the delay and that the food was not to our liking. We thanked her for that. I took the bill to the front and gave my credit card to the waitress to pay. All of a sudden the guy manager came over and apologized for the mix up and our bad experience of the food, that the entire meal was on the house! We were pleasantly surprised by his professional gesture. I asked the manager to pass my tips to our waitress. \n\nI've been to the Town Hall many times and honestly it was the first time of such a mix up and the food was seasoned a bit too strong.

I'm used to restaurants that cook with love and time.\nBut if you want to shoot for that level of care in your preparation, but at a large restaurant, you'd better have killer kitchen and seating organization...and good luck if you're attempting a menu as large as Town Hall's.  You can't have it all.\n\nWe arrived at 8pmish on Friday night and I think the root of the problem was that from the pristine tables, it looked like 75%of the tables had just been seated at once.\n\nAfter being seated we waited ten minutes to order. We ordered the veal meatballs to start.  Fifteen minutes later they arrived. Delicious.\n\nAnd. Then. We. Waited. An Eternity.\n\n40 minutes at least.  (Which can be fine...but maybe a disclaimer by dishes that take so long? And apps should be delayed to be better timed with mains.)\n\nIn the meantime it became freezing cold where I was by the window/vent (I was already wearing a wool sweater) and we had to spend a good 5 minutes flagging someone down.\n\nTime goes by and by.  Our waitress kept walking straight by... and believe me we were trying to make eye contact.\n\nFinally she comes by and explains that the trout I ordered takes 45 minutes to make.  Really?!  It's fish.  I cook a lot myself, I'm not an idiot.  She's super nice about it, but still.  \n\nThen it comes out: the kitchen only cooks for 6 tables at a time. So if you're in that last batch of tables...you're out of luck.\n\nSo 5 minutes later my trout, some hush puppies, and the bf's ravioli comes out.  But his is cold. \n\nWe look around for help...send it back...and wait some more.\n\nThe trout was really great.  The hush puppies are not like the North Carolina ones I'm used to.

The ravioli ended up being NC, but at many another restaurant, I would have thought the hostess would have come by to offer another glass of wine NC.\n\nDiners: sorry this review is so long...the food was good...but super slow, and a bit too noisy.\n\nManagement: please take note.", "author": "Petra N."}

But before I get ahead of myself, this joint is located right near the corner of Howard and Freemont. It is right across the street from a Charles Schwab Building and has a brick structure from the outside so it is hard to miss. The inside is a long hall and there are lots of tables that fill up quickly during lunch time so definitely try to make a reservation. It also gets quite noisy once people fill up so something to keep in mind. \n\nWe arrive and are promptly seated and the servers come over immediately and were very friendly. They were smiling constantly and were very enthusiastic. After perusing the menu, decided to order the tuna tartare to start and of course the Ham and Cheese toast. They serve a basket of bread which is nice and soft so plus there. The tuna tartare is solid here I would say but the spice overpowered the tuna a bit. After a few more bites I realized that the tuna may lack a bit of flavoring which is what causes the overpowering spiciness. Now the Faith's Ham and Cheese toast is very solid and I was surprised when it came out because it basically was drowned in the cream sauce. There is sweet, spicy, salty, and all other types of flavor emotions that come with this dish. As a warning it is SUPER rich and because of that I am not sure how often I could eat this but it was an excellent item to cross off for the 7x7 list.

Hostess, in her blue muu muu looking dress finally returns, but doesn't SAY anything.  I guess expecting a \"hello, thanks for waiting\" was too much.  Not even a \"hello\".

Usually people who stand at the entrance of restaurant aren't just standing there for fun.  So I say, \"HI, can we have a table for two?\"  Seats us on the patio, and then does say something like \"enjoy your meal.\"\n\nWe sit and finally the waiter shows up with some water.

There are way too many options in SF to overpay for just OK food.\n\nThis place is supposed to be known for their fried chicken. And while not always listed on the menu, it is apparently understood to those that love this restaurant that you can always ask and get the fried chicken.\n\nOn our first trip, my husband did try the fried chicken. Just OK. Was not sure what the rave was all about. \n\nOn our most recent trip, our friend who loves the chicken and chose this place specifically for her trip to SF from New England asked for the fried chicken and was told they did not have it. Keep in mind we had an 8:30 dinner reservation and did not actually get seated until closer to 9 so by the time we ordered it was after 9pm.\n\nWe wrote off the fried chicken and moved on. I ordered a sausage appetizer which had a fried egg on top. Nothing in the description of this dish stated peppers or spicy. I don't mind a little spice, but this dish was so spicy it was inedible. The egg which should have been runny, was a bit overcooked. I also ordered the hush puppies and a salad. The salad was very good. The hush puppies were good, but not traditional so a little disappointing. \n\nA few people in our party ordered the ono fish dish. My husband says his was cooked perfectly and very good. My friends mother-in-law next to me had the same dish and I could barely tell by looking at it that it was fish. It looked so overcooked. She did not finish her dish and said she was simply full. Could be true and she was just trying to be nice, but I consistently saw her nibbling off of others plates and she ordered dessert. \n\nAfter we had received our meals and had finished eating, we noticed a party of 6 next to us all being served fried chicken. We asked the waiter what gives and he said they did not have the chicken prepared when we tried to order over an hour earlier. WTF? You are known for your friend chicken and you didn't have any ready by 9pm but you had plenty ready by 10:00? I totally don't get it. \n\nBottom line and final conclusion, service is good and attentive, restaurant is noisy so hard to hear people at your own table for conversation, food is over priced and not worth what you pay for it.

First of all, Town Hall is one of the closest restaurant to where I live, yet I didn't dine there for close to a year.  I've made multiple attempts to eat there, but I was unsuccessful in getting a reservation at the time I wanted (I often call last minute).  \r\n\r\nDECOR:  Wood flooring with country side decor with tall ceilings.  Small out door patio seating with effective heating equipments.  \r\n\r\nFOOD:  Their burger comes with chips, but no french fries!!!  Hey, you pay a lot for a burger and you don't even get fries?  I've tried their whole trout with grits ($17).  Taste was excellent.  Fish was done just right and they didn't over salt it.  Grits had a nice subtle sweet flavor to it.  Very nice.  Portion wasn't big, but they give you nice sourdough bread, so I kept eating that.  \r\n\r\nSERVICE:  It was bit too slow for my liking, especially for lunch.  It took 30 minutes for our dishes to come.  For weekday lunch, that's bit too slow.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

Not sure what took them so long to let us know that they they were out of soup. They did try and compensate with a free dessert.

We arrived about five minutes before our reservation and approached the hostess desk. The hostess was cordial, telling us our table wasn't ready, but she wasn't helpful in telling us how long it would take, that we could decide to eat in their covered area outside (that area doesn't require a reservation) if we preferred, or that we could grab a drink at the bar and wait by their communal table across from the hostess' desk. As a first-timer, none of this was relayed to us -- we simply realized it after waiting around in a really cramped area by the hostess' desk for 20+ minutes and watching others do their thing. \n\nWe saw other groups getting seated before us and saw another couple who came in after us take a seat in the outside area. We finally asked a server in the area if we could sit there since we didn't want to wait any longer and our hostess had disappeared. We were told that we could (and that's when we learned that those tables don't require reservations, so we basically could have sat down a long time ago...). Right when we got seated, our hostess rushed over to us and said our table in the main dining room would be ready in a couple of minutes but we decided to stay in our seats since we were starving and just wanted to eat. \n\nI wish I could say that the seating was the only issue we had at dinner. Unfortunately, it just continued downhill. Our server was quick to drop off some waters and menus when we got seated, but he literally disappeared for 15 minutes before we could finally flag him down. I ordered the catfish and my husband ordered the pork chop. Then we had to wait another 30 minutes for our food, which is pretty ridiculous. We got no updates from our server and had to flag down another server to check on our food for us. Once he did that, our food came out right away.\n\nI dug into the catfish...only to find that it was not cooked thoroughly (it was hard to cut through the catfish meat because the inside was still raw). Our server did check in on us momentarily after we received the food so I told him what happened and he did take care of it by sending it back to the kitchen.

I ended up trying to mix sauces from other dishes to create the burst of flavor I was expecting from this dish.\nThe fried chicken had great flavor, portion is huge, but I try not to eat a plate of fried food. \nOverall, decent but not on my fav list of restaurants in SF", "author": "Pooja S."}

Even though it was pretty packed, we got a table right away. Our Waitress was friendly and prompt. Just like most upscale restaurants, they are very precise with the placing of utensils and rearranging them depending on what course it is. As well as things like folding your napkin for you when you crumple it up.\n\nAs for the food, I understand that it's San Francisco, but it's a bit pricey. I don't mind spending a good amount of money for fancy food, but I wasn't happy with paying $25 for fried chicken. It's not that the chicken wasn't good, it just didn't stand out from the rest of the fried chicken that I've had in my life...there just wasn't any kind of distinct flavor. Another thing is that the fried chicken was pretty close in price to a more fancy dish like the duck. Other than that, the side dishes that it came with were good...which were mashed potatoes with a bacon gravy and some sort of corn succotash like dish. \n\nI'm not going to name all of the other dishes that my party had, but I will get to the desserts. Since I didn't order them, I don't know their exact names...so I'll do my best at describing them. The first was some kind of \"sticky bun\", it was good...not great, but good. The other dessert was some sort of butterscotch/chocolate pudding concoction. Now that was utterly DELICIOUS..\n\n3/5 stars", "author": "Chad S."}

Here's the breakdown:\n\nI had a butter lettuce salad for an appetizer, and it was pretty tasty, but... no mention on the menu of the walnuts in the dish. The walnut flavor was somewhat overwhelming (which was odd, because there were maybe five walnuts on the plate). As someone that has an allergy to certain nuts, this rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nFor the main course, I went with their pulled pork sandwich, which was served with coleslaw on the sandwich, and a side of house made chips. The chips were OK, but over salted and tasted like the oil they were cooked in could have used a change. The sandwich was decent -- the meat was tender and delicious, but the juxtaposition of the meat to the slaw was unsuccessful. \n\nOverall, a decent meal, but I'm not rushing back.

Lots of natural light came in through the windows.\n\nOur waitress was super friendly and well-informed. We jumped on her recommendations for food (you should, too).\n\n1) The cornflake encrusted french toast with bananas on top. I will with certainty be ordering this again. It's rare to find french toast that isn't too overwhelmingly sweet, but here it's accomplished simply without too much fruit.\n\n2) The chicken and waffles (disclaimer, I am a huge chicken and waffles fan). It was boneless and skinless, which translates to low effort and healthy. The chicken was great quality. They put some bacon on top which went well with the syrup. The waffles were of the Li\u00e8ge variety (if you, like my waffle connoisseur brunch buddy, care).\n\nThey were nice enough to split both plates for us and bring them out one after the other.\n\nI sipped on a bellini and my brunch buddy had a glass of their ros\u00e9.\n\nI don't want to give it all away but I enjoyed this too much: they bring the check in an old book.

We've taken clients here for lunch and dinner, and met up w/ co-workers and friends for a quick drink right after work.  So here's what I have to say about my experiences:\n\nHappy Hour:  They have a cool cocktail list & are even willing to concoct something new for each guest.  The waiters are great and I get lost in translation when they start describing their drinks.  I get mesmerized w/ the vivid details and quite honestly, it makes me curious to try them all.  After our waiter recommended the \"Black Beauty\", I HAD to try it.  It had Gin, Antica, Honey, and Lemon Juice.  After each sip, the flavors just burst out everywhere...so good!  Other than that, I usually stick to their wine list: Chardonnay.  :)\n\nLunch/Dinner:  I love their food here, both entrees AND desserts.  Kudos to each entr\u00e9e I've tried.  The Tuna Tartare to start is delectable, especially w/ the fried green tomato.  I've never had it served w/ tomato but it's such a good pairing and tastes SO good.  It's really not meant to share... call me greedy but order 2 appetizers if there are 2 of you.  Their salad w/ buttered lettuce, Fuji apples, and candied walnuts does not disappoint, either.  My FAVORITE dish is their Guinness Battered Fish & Chips w/ Tartar Sauce.  It's ALWAYS good and the portion is plenty.  \n\nDessert:  I've tried the Butterscotch & Chocolate Pot de Cr\u00e8me and Beignets w/ Espresso Ice Cream.  Both are so DELISH!!  The Pot de Cr\u00e8me is something you definitely have to share because it is so sweet, and I will probably never be able to finish one on my own.

Especially the lady in the front, she seems as though she really hates her job. We had made reservations for 8:30 when we came in she was rude just in her demeanor. In addition to all the other people working there they seem a little off the wall. When we were sitting down they took forever on a simple thing such as bringing out a soda or refilling water at our table. It was about 15 minutes before I even was handed my soda. They have an excuse for everything!! While they try to cram so many damn tables in a tiny place, with no room to move just so they can make an extra buck. Just overall worse place for customer service with decent average food.", "author": "Austin S."}

Maybe because there are few Southern places?? To start we split the fried okra, some fried green tomatoes (we asked for them a la carte without the tuna) and hush puppies. The fried okra was bland although the batter's fried texture was light and crispy. The green tomatoes were decent although only good because of the dipping sauce. The hush puppies were something any Southern woman could do better. \n\nFor dinner I had the strawberry frisee salad and a side of cornbread. Cornbread was very good, strawberry salad came... without the strawberries. When I pointed this out rather than take it back and plate it properly they just brought me a small cup of strawberries, maybe a total of 2 or 3 chopped. Big No No. My husband and his mother had the fried chicken, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. My father in law had the blackened catfish, which he said was good but nothing to write home about.\n\nNext we ordered dessert-- the pot de creme and coffee. The coffee pot our waiter used was obviously faulty as it deposited a large amount of grounds into the cup. When my husband pointed this out he asked if Dan wanted a new cup, and after an awkward moment (because what an absurd question) he realized his mistake and just insisted on getting him a new coffee. Somehow it didn't occur to him that my mother in law's coffee was from the same pot (despite the fact that he had served her?!) and left her with the cup with grounds. At this point she didn't want to \"bother\" the waiter again, as if it were our fault as diners that my salad had been served without the main ingredient and that the coffee pot they used was broken. She drank a cup full of grounds. The pot de creme was very good, but kind of overshadowed by our less than stellar experience.\n\nTo boot my mother in law had asked for a box for her fried chicken as she had only eaten half, and it never came. Once the check came and we had paid my husband remembered and asked the waiter. \"Stand by,\" the waiter said, and returned a bit later with some fried chicken. It was more than had been left on my MIL's plate, which is great, but it was once again something they had dropped the ball on. \n\nTo end I would say this may be a great place to grab a cocktail and a couple apps at the bar, but do yourself a favor and skip having an actual meal here.", "author": "Kathryn M."}

However, there was a Giants game going on so that may have contributed to the quieter atmosphere. \n\nWhile I liked my snapper, and everyone at the table seemed to like their entrees (pork chop, flounder, and fried chicken), I thought that the stars of the evening were actually the appetizers and desserts. I loved the tuna tartare and heirloom tomato salad, and we ordered 2 of the pot de cremes for dessert, both of which were hastily passed around and devoured.

While my lunch was a solid 4.5 stars, both of my wife's dishes left much to be desired and she thought Town Hall deserves 3 stars, at best.\n\nI guess you could say her expectations were quite high.  Town Hall was, after all, opened by the Rosenthal brothers who basically \"made\" Postrio what it is today.   Apparently my wife was a good acquaintance with the pastry chef at Postrio back in the day, so she's got all the inside scoop (My wife is also a pastry chef so they used to trade recipes and know how.)   Anyway, she's been talking my ear off about Town Hall ever since we met six years ago.   Since my work is now less than 2 blocks away, I suggested we have lunch at Town Hall and my wife was elated.\n\nService was impeccable.  I must say that first and foremost.   Our server was friendly and our glasses were topped off without us having to ask.   They fold your napkin when you step away from the table, a nice touch.   5 stars for service.   Absolutely.\n\nFor appetizers, I started with the Tuna Tartare, Fried Green Tomatoes, Garlic Chips and Green Onion Tabasco Vinaigrette.  My wife went with the Roasted Beet Salad with hazelnuts and blue cheese.   She thought it was a bit pricey at $13, but apparently the high end blue cheese would explain the price.   While my raw fish was absolutely buttery and succulent, my wife was very disappointed with her salad, seeing no blue cheese on her plate whatsoever.   She was actually going to ask our waitress about it but then backed off in shyness.\n\nAs main course, I went with the Chicken fried pork chop, caramelized pears, creamy polenta, watercress and cider jus.   Again, I got lucky because that was a beautiful entree.   It tasted very creamy and warm, the perfect comfort food for a brisk and cold January lunch.   My wife was, yet again, disappointed.   She went with the House smoked corned brisket sandwich with melted fontina cheese on levain bread with sweet potato chips.   While her chips were very good, she thought the brisket was insanely salty and she couldn't taste anything else.   The bread, while oiled on both side, had apparently only been toasted on one side.   She'd also expected it to be a warm sandwich, which it was not.\n\nAll in all, not a spectacular experience for a first time.  That said, my wife assured me she'd be willing to try this place again, so let's hope for a little better food next time we come to Town Hall.", "author": "David O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-14", "description": "We came to Town Hall recently for a work dinner (so no I didn't pay for it). I know I'm a little late to the band wagon. Town Hall was really hot like 5 years ago and yet I never visited so I was pretty excited to catch-up.\n\nOverall the food was good but the service was really lacking. When we showed up at what we thought was the front entrance there was a bunch of people milling about with no apparent host or host station. It felt like we walked into some corporate event so we walked out and around the building thinking we were just at the wrong entrance. Nope. That was it. So we went back inside and still not host. Took a while for anyone to walk over and greet us. Our entire party wasn't there yet so we opted to wait at the bar. When they finally arrived and we wanted to be seated - again, the hosts had disappeared. After a few minutes I spied her chatting and talking with some friends to the side, pointedly ignoring us. Other people showed up looking confused and I had to let them know yes there was a host and they would be here eventually but they still look unconvinced. After 10-15 minutes she finally extricated herself from her socialization to come and seat us at our available table. So this was how the night started and how it continued. You know that feeling at a bar when the service is so slow that anytime the waiter appears you order another drink even if you still have a full one at hand? That's how it felt here. Service was slow. Food came out slow with long gaps in between.\n\nNow on to the food itself. A bunch of appetizers was shared by the table. Overall for $15 I would expect to get more than 3 tiny servings (approx 6 bites).\n\n* Tuna tartare - as expected, really can one go wrong with tuna tartare? I'm not a big fan of fried green tomatoes in general and Town Hall is no exception. Really hard green tomatoes with no flavor\n\n* Cornmeal fried oysters - best appetizer of the evening by unanimous vote and also the best fried oysters I've had. Super juicy and clean flavor.\n\n* BBQ shrimp - just plain weird. A few shrimp on top of a huge piece of toast soaked in sauce. Took people a while to figure out what this brown thing was under the shrimp. Looked very unappetizing so I didn't try it but it did disappear.\n\n* Buttermilk biscuits - pretty awesome if you make a sandwich by spreading the jelly on the biscuit halves and wedging the prosciutto in between. Only 3 tiny biscuits though for $14. Could really use more biscuits given the amount of prosciutto.\n\nMain courses are more solid. I had the soft shell crab with a side of crispy okra. The crab was really good. The crispy okra came out whole and the breading was a little too oily. Other people ordered the pork chop, duck breast and fried chicken and everyone liked what they ordered.\n\nDesserts were the opposite of the appetizers. Too much of a good thing. I got the butterscotch and chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me which was more like a bowl de cr\u00e9me. Gigantic cereal bowl of pudding. No one was able to eat more than half on their own. Couldn't even take it home. I mean, I'm sure I could but how do you box up a layered pudding in a doggy bag?\n\nOverall food is 4 stars, service 2 stars, value 3 stars if you avoid the appetizers.", "author": "Jean K."}

Street parking was easy to find, and we were seated about 5 minutes after arriving.  The decor is nice, sort of rustic with all of the wood and retro lighting.  We were seated in a corner, which was just fine because the tables are pretty close to each other.\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers:  the tuna tartare with fried green tomatoes and the oxtail ravioli with english peas and shitake mushrooms.  The tartare was good, nothing special, but tasty.  The fried green tomatoes were, well, red.  They were obviously not green anymore, but more like underripe red tomatoes with a greenish tint (you know, the kind you avoid buying at the grocery store).  They didn't taste bad, but I always think if you're advertising green tomatoes, that's what should show up.  Also, the dish didn't really flow for me.  Why did they pair the tuna and tomatoes?  I thought it might be interesting, but it was just sort of ... meh.  My boyfriend liked the ravioli, but I was unimpressed.  Oxtail is delicious... but not in their ravioli.  It was ok but I definitely wasn't left wanting more.  \n\nI ordered the fried chicken for dinner, he ordered the gumbo with shrimp and sausage.  The chicken was great, and the smashed potatoes accompanying it were fabulous.  We make fried chicken at home every once in a while and it's fabulous, and this was almost as good, but not quite.  We had planned on sharing entrees and I was really bummed that I had to take the gumbo.  It was not good at all.  Having been in the south and cooked a lot of Southern food myself, this dish was just plain undesirable.  The flavor felt thin, and I just wished my boyfriend would give my fried chicken back.  \n\nWe also ordered hush puppies which were yummy on the outside (the part where it was crispy) but the inside was just kind of bland.  Also, there was no sauce served with them, so you ended up with a dry ball of cornmeal and nothing to dip it in.\n\nLastly, I ordered a latte that was just... weird.  I drink lattes daily from lots of places and this one tasted a bit burnt.  I can't remember the last time I sent a latte back, maybe never.  \n\nThe server was nice and very prompt, as were the bussers.

The food at lunch is a different menu than the one they give at dinner, although, the portion sizes are just as large! I had the burger for lunch and could barely eat half of it. They served it with fries, so it was a large meal to eat during mid day. I definitely went back to work feeling sleepy from a food coma! \n\nDINNER: I came here for a Pre-Christmas dinner with my boyfriend before I flew to Seattle. I heard a lot about the fried chicken, but didn't end up getting it. The table next to us ordered it, and surely enough, it was a large portion! I ordered a steak dish which was cooked to perfection. It wasn't too large, in fact, the portion was just enough for me. I guess it really depends on what you order. Not every dish is \"large\" as I would expect since the lunch portion and the fried chicken was considerably large. \n\nThe decor inside is upscale, enough for a cute little date in the evening. You'll want to make reservations ahead of time if you are coming in the evening on a weekend, as they can get pretty busy. I don't know that I would come here again for lunch, but I would come back to finally try the fried chicken for dinner.", "author": "Jennifer R."}

Thought we would give them a try.\n\nOutstanding cuisine with a wonderful selection of down home, American dishes. I had the red snapper, my wife had the ribs (unbelievable), my youngest daughter absolutely LOVED the macaroni and cheese. The best part of the night was watching my oldest daughter take her first bite of the halibut. I think her exact words were, \"This is heaven on a plate!!\"\n\nAn excellent meal and a great dining experience. Service was spot on - Margie was our server and she ROCKED! We were pleased to get right in with no reservation (8 PM on a Sunday evening).\n\nLocating the restroom was an adventure, however, the hostess was kind enough to direct us through the labryth of stairs, hallways and corridors.

I came here with a few co-workers at around 4pm for a few glasses of wine and maybe some snacks. We were told we can sit outside, which we did, but the waitress didn't seemed to interested in brining us menus. After 15 minutes we had to go ask for some water and maybe to see a menu. Got a bottle of wine, some oysters (very good), and some shrimp skewers. Given the speedy service, by the time we got the appetizers it was close to 5, so we asked if they could make us a salad, the answer was no, we'd have to wait until the dinner menu at 530. ok. 505 we get ahold of the menu for the happy hour that apparently just ended and learned that there was a salad option, when we  inquired we were told that we just missed it and have to wait until 5. \n\nI'm sorry but what in the world? Three stars is generous and based solely on the wine which was pleasant and oysters which were good ... but not sure if I'd give it another go.

Needless to say I had a whole ton of fried stuff and it was all I could down before I was full. I would've rather gotten 2 portions of the fried okra instead-- the yucca fries with the sandwich were just like the french fries anyway.

Brought by my fellow coworkers and developer team (awesome team and very friendly might I add) me and two other interns had lunch here. The first thing I noticed was how you have two forks and two knives. Damn, seems too fancy for me. The menu came in a sheet of paper, kind of neat but most likely because the menu keeps changing so they don't have a permanent menu. \n\nAnyways, we ordered some cornbread as appetizers and I personally ordered the smoked salmon on rye with a green salad. The bread arrived first and holy crap was it good. The crust was crunchy and the bread was definitely fresh and moist. Absolutely delicious. The corn bread with jalepeno (I know kind of strange) came shortly after but wasn't spicy even though there was jalepeno in it. It tasted great but came in very small portions, but hell it's a fancy restaurant you kind of expect that.\n\nWhen the main course arrived, everyone ordered a burger with avocado mmmm and some fries that tasted just like chips (mmmmmmm even more). My sandwich came with a salad while everyone had burgers and fries which made me feel kinda hipster, but whatever I'm in SF health is kind of important here anyways. I took the sandwich and took a big bite out of it and my mind was absolutely blown. The bread was crispy and crunchy yet it was complimented with the smokey and savory taste of the salmon alongside the sour cream and avocado smothered on the bread. It was one of the best tasting sandwiches ever. I devoured the both halves and finished the salad which was fragrant and fresh. I helped my friend finish his fries which were very crispy and tasted really good.\n\nFancy? Definitely. Worth the price? I'd guess so. Service and speed? All the food came at the same time and the wait staff was friendly and quick. One of the top places here in SF? Not sure, but definitely something to check out.

Oh and don't forget the salt! \n\nCheese & Ham Toast - this was actually really good, but it was DROWNING in the jalapeno cream which was of course, salty. \n\nThese all came out pretty quickly and dinner seemed to be off to a good start, despite the constant need for water due to the saltiness of everything. A note to the wait staff - please leave a little room in the small glasses for water. There was so much ice in my glass that after 3 gulps I had no more water. \n\nSo we're girls, we're chatting, we're catching up. The time got away from us until finally someone stopped the talking and said \"where is our food?\" Indeed, over an hour had passed and we still didn't have our entrees. One gentleman, I'm assuming he was the floor manager (sorry I can't remember his name), but he came over and gave us the biscuits w/ prosciutto and red pepper jam appetizer - on the house. Nice gesture. He was actually very nice and apologetic and we appreciated it, but we wanted our food, not an app. \n\nFinally the entrees come out:\n\nWild Flounder - didn't personally try it, but my friends were complaining about it being too salty. \n\nGrilled Porkchop - overcooked to hell! The flavor was good and I loved the fried cheese grit cakes, but holy hell. The meat was so unbelievably dry that it was hard to swallow. And yes... VERY SALTY. \n\nFried Chicken - actually probably some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. Moist, juicy, tender and all that jazz. Coating was a little soft and not as crunchy as I'm used to, but still good. This dish actually had just the right amount of salt too. Shocking. \n\nWe were already there for almost 3 hours so we ended up skipping dessert. The night guy who brought out the biscuit app ended up comping some of our food and the 2 glasses of wine, but somehow the bill was still $155... Ridiculous. \n\nI have to say, this was one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences ever. To hear about a place for 3 years and to have people keep saying how \"YOU HAVE TO GO\" and then to have this kind of experience and terrible salty food. Just sad.", "author": "Jen D."}

So when a childhood friend of mine came to town to visit, I thought this would be a good choice for a nice dinner. I was a little nervous about bringing our 2 year old son with us, but we couldn't get a babysitter.\n\nAfter I made a reservation, I decided to look at some reviews here on Yelp and was disappointed to find that some recent reviews were less than stellar and one reviewer was treated harshly after bringing a 2 year old nephew to dinner. Feeling uncomfortable after reading these reviews, I tried to find another venue for dinner but couldn't get a table on such short notice for Saturday night.\n\nThankfully, our dinner experience turned out to be quite wonderful. As soon as the hostess checked us in, she asked if we would like some crayons and paper for our son which we gratefully accepted. We had to wait perhaps 10 mins for our server to appear, but after that our order was taken promptly and we didn't have to wait long between courses. \n\nThe food itself got a huge thumbs up, every dish we ordered was flavorful and generously portioned:\n\n- heirloom tomato salad - very fresh, loved the mint and yoghurt dressing\n- tomato mascarpone risotto - creamy yet refreshing. The fresh tomatoes made all the difference.\n- buttermilk biscuits with prosciutto and Red pepper jelly - a lovely savory/sweet combo\n- Ham, cheese and egg toast with jalape\u00f1o cream - decadent goodness!!\n\nWe shared ou mains family style and got to sample the best of what Town Hall has to offer:\n- BBQ Ribs - meat fell off the bone, the sauce was a standout\n- Pork cooked two ways - perfectly tender pork medallions and pork belly, paired perfectly with nectarines\n- fried chicken - juicy, nicely seasoned classic\n\nDessert was also great, but my favorite will always be the butterscotch and chocolate pudding, which was exactly as I remembered it years ago.\n\nOverall we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening and I was grateful that the restaurant accommodated our 2 year old as this is really a place for adults to enjoy and linger over dinner. (Another bonus was that the adjoining garden courtyard at 199 Fremont ended up being the perfect playground for my 2 year old when he couldn't sit still after we finished our mains.)\n\nI'm glad to say that I would still highly recommend Town Hall as a dining destination!", "author": "Melissa S."}

The portions are not obesity-adjusted, but right-sized to fill you up without feeling gross.  The restaurant is more FiDi power lunch than molasses slow service from someone you call ma'am.  The take away stand in the back provides much more exciting lunchtime options than those horrible Chinese steam table and deli sandwich shops polluting the FiDi.  Town Hall is a great way to experience the South without all the red.\n\nButtermilk Biscuits: A few tiny biscuits with prosciutto-style ham and peach jam topping options.  I really appreciate the ham and peach condiments since it adds a new sophistication to the biscuits.  The biscuits were a bit dry and needed some external butter addition, which is unfortunate.  It may be declasse, but I love me the butter-level in Popeye's biscuits!\n\nSeafood \u00c9touff\u00e9e: Excellent spicy broth with tasty crawfish.  More places in San Francisco should serve crawfish (especially the shelled version for us lazy folks).  The shrimps were a little shrimpy, a much better presentation would have had a few jumbos in there.  \n\nFried Chicken Sandwich (Take Away): You might dislocate your jaw on this one.  Two deep fried chicken breasts, spicy coleslaw and a thick rustic roll make this sandwich a tower!  The coleslaw adds a nice tangy contrast to the fried chicken since it is vinegar based without cream.  The chicken breasts are like adult-sized chicken tenders.  Very tasty and moist, but I wish the chicken was fresh out of the fryer instead of at room temperature.\n\nButterscotch Chocolate Pot De Cr\u00e8me (Take Away): Butterscotch, amazing how butter and brown sugar can create such magic.  Butterscotch on top of chocolate makes this two layer pot de cr\u00e8me a force to reckon with.  Thin toffee with dark chocolate covering add a nice crunchy contrast to the smooth base.", "author": "Adam B."}

The crabmeat was very tender and fresh and the peppers and sauce accented the flavor very nicely.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Fried Chicken that the waitress and hostess both recommended. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the skin was flaky and crispy and fantastic. The potatoes and bacon gravy were great but they skimped a little on the gravy. No problem though, because our thoughtful waitress asked me if I wanted more and brought me a little side dish of it! Tip secured.\n\nThe GF got a Special menu item that I don't remember exactly, but I know it was Monkfish and that it tasted great. Super fresh, flavorful and accompanied by a wonderful sauce.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Butterscotch Pot de Creme and loved it. Would recommend it to anyone who likes butterscotch pudding like we do.\n\nTheir tequila cocktail (The 212 I think it was called) was also very good. It probably accompanies fish a little better than fried chicken, but tasty none the less.\n\nThe only reason there is a star missing here is because everything is VERY EXPENSIVE. We had a great time here and may come back again someday, but the pricing will really hinder us. We can get high quality food at a lot of places in SF, without paying $200 (after tip).

I'm always a fan of the simplified menu...and I noticed that they had a scallops dish with risotto and they had Cowgirl Creamery fondue appetizer.  The scallops were baby scallops but tasty and he risotto was a bit on the crunchy side than I preferred. Maybe a little too crunchy...as for the fondue, it didn't really wow me.  I heard that this brand does excellent cheese but perhaps the kind they used for the fondue really didn't come over well.  The taste seemed off for an aged white cheese.\n\nAnd of course the noise level...we ate at 9pm but still the noise in the place was still at ear deafening levels akin to rock concerts and sporting events.  Our service was good as they brought out our main courses after we finished our starters.  \n\nAll in all, a decent place to go for a group meal if you don't mind the noise.  They have the 4% surcharge here added to your meal FYI so don't be surprised to see it.", "author": "Ben H L."}

In this economy you think they'd be thrilled with 10 people, but no, we were told we could have a table at 5:30PM or at 9:30PM. We finally were able to negotiate a 10 top at 7pm, after many, many discussions. Since they had made such a stink about our group size I figured this place was tiny. Not so, huge rooms, huge bar and upstairs seating as well. I have no idea why seating 10 was such a problem. \n\nCorkage: PROBLEM \nYou can only bring in 2 bottles of wine, for the entire group. There was 10 of us, 2 was not going to cut it. Also, there is a $20 corkage fee, you'd think since they put a limit on how many you can bring in it would be free. Also, our server told us that if we ordered a bottle the fee would be waived. We did, the fee was still there when we got the check. \n\nService: PROBLEM \nIt literally took 30 minutes for us to get our bottle of wine, most of our drinks took the same amount of time. The server spent the entire evening telling us how much her coworkers sucked. It was awkward to say the least. The rest of the staff was rude and also bad mouthing everyone else. The owner approached our table to tell us how horrible she thought one of the servers was, I would think you would do something about that instead of just complaining to the customer. Not to mention, one of our party was practically pushed to the floor by a server while walking back from the bathroom, she was appalled and offended. \n\nMenu: PROBLEM \nWe were given menus when we were seated, 10 minutes later those menus were taken away and we were told that we'd be ordering from a smaller menu due to our party size. We were never told this when we booked the reservation and the issue was handled rudely and unprofessionally. \n\nFood: SMALL PROBLEM \nReally, really overpriced. The food is decent, not the best I have ever had, but pretty good. But, the prices are unreal. $28 for 5 ribs and a small cup of cole slaw. Really, seriously? \n\nOverall: WE WONT BE BACK. \nI would suggest spending your money else where. There are 1000 restaurants in the Bay Area that can offer the whole experience without having to break the bank.", "author": "Blake W."}

More passion and less calculation would have helped this place be better.   It's meant to be a chic country setting which comes off as more Napa than New Orleans and then they pipe in loud blues music which caused a couple of couples to ask to be relocated.  In hind site, we should have asked to eat outside on such a nice day to make more romantic environment away from the crowd inside.\n\nThe waiter was excellent as was the Ham/Toast/Egg appetizer.  Even though it was rich, I knew then that it probably wasn't going to great.  There is something lacking that makes the best kind of American cuisine that has such a robust complexity you just can't stop tasting it.  \n\nThe seafood ettouffe was pretty good, but probably over stylized.

After a brief consultation (aka stage whispering like starstruck teenyboppers), we ascertained that yes indeedy, the distinctly pompadoured man was the one and only Conan O'Brien.

The biscuits and gravy were disappointing due to the fact that they were cold and they put an unwelcome dent into my food buzz.  My friends ordered the snapper, pork chop, and lobster and rabbit pot pie.  All received favorable reviews.\n\nBut the unequivocal piece de resistance was the butterscotch pot de creme.  It was silky smooth chocolate and butterscotch layered deliciousness.  The pieces of brittle in the dish were quickly inhaled as well.

For another, the meat was juicy and moist, but lacked seasoning...almost like they didn't marinate the chicken overnight or just not enough.  Overall good...but i've had way better... even bogangles in charlotte in uptown was better and not even close to the chicken at ad hoc.  Looks like i see need to reserve me a chicken knight to ad hocs to satisfy my chicken fix...or next time I'm in the south.\n\nThe pork chops were good that my friend ordered... big portion and moist..but again to me the seasoning just isn't there.\n\nAll in all not bad...just not great. Too many other places that serves better food in SF at this price point.", "author": "Vien C."}

Great service, great food, but so noisy after 7pm that you have to shout at your table mates (and waiters) to be heard.  Recommend it highly if you're feeling upbeat, energetic and looking for good eats but don't need to have an intimate conversation!\n\nFor an appetizer, don't miss the tuna tartare.  This one is really well executed and full of flavor. The addition of fried green tomatoes and Tobasco vinaigrette is inspired.\n\nSeafood stew was chock full of fresh seafood and had a really unusually flavored tomato broth, almost like a very thin mole (think dozens of different spices).  I would wager you could not find another like this at any other restaurant.\n\nFried chicken - if you are at all inclined, order it!  Really crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and very generous portion.  I had to share mine with my husband because it was just too much, and too good not to share.  He was not as thrilled with his halibut, as it seemed rather ordinary compared to the dishes others at our table ordered, so he was happy to help me out.\n\nWe are looking forward to returning and trying more of the goodies on the menu.", "author": "Virginia K."}

But I will no longer be recommending them or giving them my business due to ineptness and rudeness of the reservations staff and management.\n\nI was excited when my company moved to a new office south of market and realized that Town Hall was so close. At the first opportunity, I booked a lunch there for our CEO and 3 of our new hire executives. Today when we called to confirm the reservation - we were told it did not exist. The person looked it up via our phone number and said that the reservation was for last week and yes, people showed up to dine. (Not from our company, they didn't.) She said, well somebody used the reservation. Ok. Mistakes happen, can you still fit them in today, they are walking over now. Yes, but they will have to sit on the patio. OK. That's fine. Thank you.  2 minutes later, the phone rings and it is our CEO telling us they have no reservation for him. Really? We call back and ask to speak to the manager. After being grilled by the person who answered the phone about WHY we want to speak to the manager, we were connected. The manager listened to about 2 sentences and then tried to hang up. When we persisted on telling him the whole tale - his only comment was \"Well, they seem happy now.\"  Wow. I am sure it was just another customer to him and he wasn't mean about it. Just unconcerned and unapologetic. So, now we are a former customer and recommender.", "author": "MaryAlice C."}

The interior itself was very old-time rustic with antiques in spots and mission style tables and chairs.  Our bread arrived in a real antique wooden bread \"basket\".  I thought they were reproductions, but when I asked our waitress, she said they were the real thing. Looking around, I realized every table had a different one.  A really nice touch!  We started off with my boyfriend ordering Cabernet and me ordering one of their signature drinks \"Witches Knickers\".  It was tequila based and fantastic!  We ordered the butter lettuce salad with Point Reyes bleu cheese dressing and one was enough for both of us.  For our meals, my boyfriend had the salmon which was perfection and I had the rice crusted snapper which was one of the best fish meals I ever ate.  We ordered sides of tater tots with barbecue sauce and jalapeno corn bread, both of which were terrific!  For dessert, I couldn't pass up the butterscotch Pot de Creme and I'm glad I didn't!

With such a vibrant food culture, if you don't have a unique appeal or  \"wow\" factor then you're just another place that appeals to minute portion of the population who can afford to eat here and no longer the people.  In the end, it does serve its purpose but it really is all about the people.\n\nI do commend the service though.  I needed a private dining room for a party for a Thursday night and I had called on just that Tuesday before.  The coordinator was extremely efficient and quick in getting my menu set, contract approved, and even the tiny details.  Service on the day of the dinner was excellent was well.  They noticed that one extra person had showed up and swiftly set up another setting. \n\nYou should know that the private dining room upstairs requires a $2000 food and beverage minimum before tax and tip.  I wasn't sure if a group of 17 would be able to meet this but it did.  We chose a 4 course meal, 4 wines (multiple bottles of it), mixed drinks (from the full, standard bar), coffee, and tea.\n\nNow the reason for the 3 is because of the food.  I started out with a normal salad with peaches and a champagne vinaigrette which I thought was still too tart.  You have to each a bit of peach with every bite to balance it out.  Second dish was the tuna tartare which wasn't seasoned that intensely and you eat it with thinly sliced potatoes which doesn't add much to it either.  Third dish was the filet mignon which was cooked medium-well (I forgot to indicate how I wanted it) but still flavorful and tender.  Fourth was the infamous chocolate butterscotch pot de creme.  I was literally looking forward to this and this alone!  I was impressed because it's the richest, most delicious upscale version of pudding you'll ever have.  Sitting in the center is a double sided piece of chocolate and toffee.  Maybe I was too full or over loaded with sugar but I could only eat 1/4 of this but I wanted to finish it!  I really did.\n\nAnother entree option that night was the sea bass which turned out more like sea bream.  Usually this is served white, flaky, and plump but this was more like pan fried and like something you make at home.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed my time here.  The room is slightly bare bones, probably because we didn't have the amount of people to fill it.  I wouldn't recommend going under a party of 15 since this room can supposedly fill up to 40.  I do like that there are bathrooms and a bar just for us since we were upstairs.  It's nice to be removed from all the noise downstairs.  My only suggestion is to spruce it up a little and provide an area for peoples' belongings.", "author": "Shannon L."}

In the last three months I have been lucky enough to sample each of them. Town Hall is probably my favorite.\n\nThis restaurant reminds me of New England, where I spent a chunk of my college years. Town Hall looks like a colonial town hall but classy. In fact, it looks like the Great Hall in Boston from the outside (google it).  I digress--I don't miss the East Coast at all, but I love memories of the East Coast conjured up on the West Coast.\n\nAnyway, I came here for lunch. For an appetizer I had the tuna tartare, which was light and refreshing. The garlic chips were a nice touch. For my entree I had the crispy soft shell crab sandwich with sweet potato chips. There was a solid amount of crab in my sandwich and the sweet potato chips were addictive. As if the good food wasn't enough, the server was not bad to look at either. I generally don't like servers who recommend the most expensive items on the menu, but as I thoroughly enjoyed my food, I forgive the server for his unsavory behavior. Haha.\n\nThanks to fellow Yelper dan h. for this great meal!", "author": "Liz T."}

Our waitress didn't let on the usual \"just that, nothing else!?\" annoyance, which was appreciated.  \n\nThe pepper jelly biscuits and jalepeno cornbread were excellent starters and like others, we really liked the fried chicken, and were happy that we opted to share it.  The pot de creme and donut desserts were perfect and delicious.  Our drinks were unique.

We were greeted and seated immediately upon arrival about 15 minutes in advance of our reservation.  \n\nI loved the ambiance.  Great interior decor, especially the light fixtures.  Others have felt the tables were a bit close together but I found it very comfortable.  \n\nWhile many have raved about the fried chicken and pork chops, my dining companion and I were more intrigued by a number of the starters and we decided to compose a meal of them.  Our server was amenable to this and suggested  creating two courses of our small plates.\n\nWe started with the biscuits with prosciutto and the tuna tartare with fried green tomatoes.  I absolutely LOVED the biscuits.  They were SO delicious.  Sadly, they were very small, though adorable!  The portion of prosciutto was so generous, I wish there had been several more biscuits.  The tartare was good as well.\n\nFor our next \"course\" we had the peppers stuffed with crab, jambalaya, corn bread and veal meatballs.  All were yummy.  I could have had a much larger portion of the stuffed peppers.  It was a starter so I don't fault Town Hall for the portion size.  It was just so delicious that I wanted more!  The portion of meatballs was very generous and could be billed as an entree if it were served on a different plate.  \n\nWe ended the meal with the butterscotch and chocolate pot de creme.  Very tasty, especially the absolutely delicious butter crunch on top.\n\nOverall, it was a delicious meal.  The service was unimpressive, hence the lack of a fifth star.  It took far too long to get our water, drink orders and check.  I'm fine with some time during a meal but the elements before and after should be attended to in a timely manner.  Still, I would absolutely return to Town Hall.", "author": "Shauna F."}

Fried chicken - finger licking good (as colonel sanders would say it and probably agree if he were alive....may his soul rest in peace).

When we were finally seated, it took another 10-15 to get our drink orders and probably another 10 minutes AFTER that to get our entree order. At this point, we are all concerned about getting back to work on time. When our appetizers arrived, we were cutting it short, but when the apps were taken away, and we waited another 15 minutes for the main entrees. I had to ask for the check, which came before the food from our very reluctant waiter. I let him know this was a problem, and not with a hint of concern, he just said, the food takes 25 minutes, and shrugged his shoulders. \n\nI finally spoke with the manager who apologized, but that was it.

He also touched his face and hair during the entire evening as we watched him on the dining room floor...gross.  Our bill was $160+ ,($130 with a $30 tip), for two of us on a random weeknight, in our city of s.f., without dessert...at this price point I expect to be taken seriously and we weren't.\n\nWe ordered the ahi appetizer and the scallop appetizer.  Both were delicious.  The ahi was fresh and translucent with a nice lingering spice that was almost undetectable during consumption.  The brown butter and citrus combination with the scallops were divine on the cabbage and the citrus wedges were definitely paid some extra attention to as the citrus flavors were muted and balanced pleasantly with everything else. \n\nThe server didn't write anything down which is fine...if your going to actually remember.  He had to come back and ask us what our entrees were.\n\nI ordered another beer and it took ten minutes...come on!\n\nOur entrees were the ny steak and the bacon wrapped trout.

I used to live a few blocks away and I've had some real great experiences here, eating wonderful food with my family, meeting tre cool of Green Day (who apparently frequents their bar) but my experience there last night will probably prevent me from returning.\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived around 8pm last night (7/22/12) for dinner.  At first, the doors were locked, which was kind of strange, and instead of someone coming to open them, we got stared at for a few minutes like we were aliens before someone came to help, which was pretty lame on its own, but then to get the \"oh, do you have a reservation? no? wow, well let me see if something is available\" when your restaurant is half full at best and maybe 5-6 more tables were sat all evening is pretty annoying.\n\nSo we sit down, order drinks, veal/pork meatballs and entrees.  The drinks and meatballs come out pretty quick, but my girlfriend and I each cut one in half and the center was raw, not medium rare, not rare, but raw, like you can pick an individual strand of cold pork out of it.  I call the waiter over and he takes a quick look, agrees they are massively undercooked and even says something along the line of \"wow thats not good, especially with ground pork!\" (a+ for our waiter btw, he was incredible).  So he takes the meatballs back to the kitchen.\n\nA minute or so later a woman, who I assume was the manager (and also the same person who greeted us fairly gruffly) comes over and tells us that they normally serve the meatballs medium rare and shes sorry we expected something else.  (As I said, they weren't medium rare, they weren't even rare).  After this I went over and grabbed the actual recipe for the meatballs which is sitting right on the desk by the entrance and it clearly advises as the final step in cooking the meatballs \"cook the meatballs to medium\", as someone who cooked meatballs last week, this is very clearly correct.\n\nSo, in return for going to this restaurant, waiting for them to actually open their doors, starting with gruff customer service, not only do I get uncooked food, I also get attitude about it?  I mean, I've sent back maybe 3 plates in my entire life, but this was a no brainer, to have someone come tell me I'm wrong in this situation just really is unacceptable.  What is the point?  To protect your chefs?  To protect your reputation?  Honestly if there was a simple \"wow we undercooked these, our mistake\", it would be fine, but they made a very clear mistake and then went out of their way to make it sound like we were being dramatic by sending back an uncooked meatball.  I spoke with a friend who is one of the best chefs I knew about the incident and he said he would have made it very clear to this person that he would never be back to their restaurant, I was just a little too shocked at the treatment we received to even think about that honestly.  Hugely unfortunate, I wish we had just walked away at the locked doors and not had a chance to deal with this manager.  I genuinely wonder how she got the job.", "author": "Ryan J."}

No complaints there.\n\nThe entree, however, was a disaster.  I ordered potato gnocchi with fall harvest vegetables thinking it would be something light and healthy.  The presentation on the plate was nice, but that was it.  Every single piece of vegetable and gnocchi tasted like it had been slow stewed in grease.  I've never tasted anything that had been so thoroughly permeated with grease.  I had to drink a lot of water and eat bread to even be able to eat any of it.  I asked my husband to eat some of it since I hate to waste food, but we couldn't finish it.

The restaurant was not busy at all when he dined.  The restaurant space is lovely.  It's large and the dining room is really well done.  We had a cod fritter appetizer, which may have been a special, as well as a tuna tartare with fried green tomatoes.  Both were great, especially the cod fritters.  They were like little dough balls of fishy goodness. I had the fried chicken and it was very, very good.  I feel the breading could have been a bit more flavorful (spicy, etc.) but the texture was perfection and the chicken was moist and perfect.  What really won though was the mashed potatoes and gravy.  Unreal.  I'm not sure what the green was, but it was good.  My friend had the steak.  I don't think she was blown away, but no complaints.  We passed on dessert and had cocktails instead.  I believe it was an Island Mule and a Tiger Lily.  Both good, but not amazing.  Our server was a bit on the cheeseball side and I honestly don't think he brought any of the food to the table, although that may just be how the restaurant is set up.

Nevertheless, on the whole it was good. \n\nFor dessert, we had the red velvet cake and ice cream. It was good but not as good as the red velvet cake at Cheesecake Factory.\n\nDon't know what the hype is because the food was OK.  But I give an extra star for their impeccable service - fantastic! So attentive, courteous and professional.  The setting and ambiance is nice too, but it can get noisy.", "author": "Chilly W."}

The server was very helpful, he gave us the option to serve our appetizers as courses instead and also let us know the popular dishes. So for example, we each got a plate for our tuna tartare dish which was awesome! Note: there were only two of us so maybe that's why we were given this option.\n\nFor the appetizers, we got the 'Tuna Tartare with Cornmeal fried green tomatoes', the flavors were so interesting and we were more intrigued by the fried green tomatoes. We also got the 'Ham and Cheese Toast, Poached Egg and Jalapeno Cream', one of their specialties and this was extremely rich and delicious! It sounds just like what it is but so much better, it was completely topped with jalapeno cream. \n\nFor the entrees, we got the 'Pork Chop' (a specialty) and the 'Rib Eye', and we were both VERY happy with our dishes. The meat was juicy and extremely flavorful and the sides served with the entrees were very good. We also got the warm jalapeno cornbread served in it's little baking dish. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the 'Coffee and Donuts' and got fresh pressed coffee, it was the best way to end our meal. \n\nThe service was great, the servers as well as the bussers were very friendly and delightful. \n\nGreat experience, wish i was rich so i could go back again soon!", "author": "Eva L."}

The only reason I knock a star is a few silly things that were enough to rub me the wrong way.\nAnyways....\n\nFirst of all - the drinks were spot on. The full liquor menu was teeny tiny print (made me wish I had my grandma's magnifying glass w/torch attached) but the selection itself was good.\nThe wine list was perfect for our taste - I find it hard to get good Spanish options here; and I get it - northern Cali, Napa valley etc etc etc. But I grew up on my Rioja's and Tempranillo's and there's a real fondness there.  I really enjoyed the Rioja here.\n\nIn terms of food we split a tuna tartare, BBQ shrimp and 8 oysters between 4 of us, then I shared the duck prosciutto and the steak with the hubs. Both were delicious.  The waitress has described the portions as being generous so we felt confident splitting an app and entree would be enough. In all honesty the portions weren't that generous, but the food itself was rich - we actually couldn't finish all our food and we are folks who can eat. We love to eat.\n\nService and everything else was fine. We were there late and we were the last to leave; I know and I'm sorry about that. But we were catching up cousins after almost a year. Don't make 7 people hover over us. We genuinely got it and we were drinking up and wrapping it up. Sometimes it just takes a minute to wrap it up when it's been that long with frousins.\n\nDessert was delish - we did 'coffee and donuts' screw the ice cream, the donuts were yum! So much so we asked for a side of donuts. Of course they said yes but went ahead and did the whole dessert. And charged full price. But that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe only other thing that got to me was that my wine glass sat empty for a minute or two at the beginning of our meal and so I asked my husband if I should serve myself or wait for our server....he said serve yourself. Wrong! As soon as I grabbed the bottle and was about to pour she came jogging over doing a 'tut tut' at me. Not appreciated. My girl caught me straight away and said she knew what I was thinking but thought I was not properly understanding. Ok; I'll take a step back. Um - don't let my glass get empty when we're getting a buzz on. Or perhaps a slightly different approach when reprimanding a customer?\n\nAll in all I had a great night and will be back here.", "author": "Kym P."}

Fresh out of the oven, cute little bite-sized pieces, the jalapeno is so subtle yet adds just enough kick so you feel that zing on your tongue.. I am determined to steal and recreate this recipe! Also, the cornmeal fried oysters are absolutely beautiful. Crispy on the outside, gooey sloshy creamy goodness on the inside. I must warn you that one oyster was incredibly salty - I guess the chefs are a bit sloppy with the salt distribution - but again, this could have happened with any dish, so do not let this deter you from getting those oysters!\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the Tai rice-crusted snapper. The fish was soft and the texture was just how I liked it, but sadly, it was completely flavorless! The blue crab etouffee (the whole reason I chose this dish in the first place) left me underwhelmed, and the \"zuchini marmalade stuffed piquillo peppers\" tasted like they were pulled straight from a cheap caprese sandwich. My friend ordered the St. Louis ribs - they were nice and tangy, but not too different from the $12 rack of ribs from Sizzlers'. \n\nDessert - warm brioche donuts and blue bottle coffee ice cream - was a very creative play on \"coffee and donuts\" (how appropriate, since my friend is a cop!) and actually very delicious! Sadly, I could not get over my disappointment in my entree, which for the first time at such a restaurant, I did not finish and brought home as leftovers. The service was also so-so.

It is pretty hard to mess up stuffed peppers though.\n\nOther dishes:\n+ Buttermilk fried chicken, Anson Mills grits, collard greens, bacon gravy: REALLY good, but am I the only person who hates paying $23+tax/tips for fried chicken? ...damn it, I would totally still get it again.\n+ Butterscotch and chocolate pot de creme with buttercrunch: loved the buttercrunch, but I've had better chocolate pot de creme.\n+ Buttermilk biscuits, country ham, red pepper jelly: yay, it comes in 3 mini-biscuits and delicious thinly-sliced ham!\n+ Petrale sole with butternut squash puree, beech mushrooms, pomegranate sauce, potato gnocchi: *blinks* yeah, I don't quite remember this dish; probably not a good sign, eh? o_O\n+ Warning: the smoked andouille jambalaya is SPICY! It tasted good but I could only have a couple of bites :(\n\nI wouldn't come here with too large of a party, since everyone will want a bite of every single dish (it's THAT good!), and it was already a struggle making sure each of us had a decent bite of each item.", "author": "Tina L."}

Upon a recommendation from a bartender (Cynthia at Market in St. Helena whom we also enjoyed very much in Napa) we decided to try Town Hall in San Francisco.  We arrived on Thursday evening and were fortunate to find to seats opening at the bar when we walked in.  Our bartender Bob greeted us immediately and got us our first round.  He recommended one of their new cocktails (Normandie Rises, very good) and that we try the BBQ Shrimp which was insane.  Although the bar was slammed the entire time we were there, Bob and the other bartender Jamal were always focused on their guests with a sense of urgency and maintained a friendly smile and conversation throughout.  Next we split the fried chicken for our entree and finished with butterscotch chocolate pot de creme with toffee.  Everything we had was memorable.  A real treat to eat at Town Hall.  We had fantastic food in Napa and San Francisco but this may have been our favorite for the whole trip.

Best dishes are fried chicken (if you like it a little spicy and tart), the rotating selection of pork product (ham/prosciutto/whatever) with pepper jelly and buscuits (all three elements are impeccable), tuna tartar (perfectly cubed whole pieces of tuna delicately coated with avocado pieces and a spicy dressing served with crisp but not greasy sesame wontons), the pork chop (JUICY), the warm ham & cheese toast (too decadent for one person and really creamy), all of the salads (very whole, amazingly fresh ingredients put together in an elegant balance), and the sides - my favorite are the little finger sized cornbread. Always great fish dishes, accompanied by nice, light, seasonal vegetable ragus (like salmon with corn maque choux)\nAmbiance: southern, mixed.

I was there a few months ago but the memories of that amazing meal are still fresh in my mind...\n\nThe setting is chic: exposed brick, sexy candlelit tables and antique hardwood floors...it's elegant, but not over-the-top. There wasn't too much to the decorations in the space, but I liked it that way - it made the food speak for itself. \n\nMy appetizer was a small plate of buttermilk biscuits, fresh sweet/salty smoked ham with apricot preserves.  Although this may sound a bit strange for some people it was actually very good: a savory blend of salty and sweet.  The biscuits were a balanced combination of being soft inside and slightly flakey outside - who knew bread could be so amazing?  I'm not a huge ham person, but I really enjoyed this version: thin slices with a heavy pork flavor that really melted in your mouth.  The apricot preserves were amazing: sweet, but not too sweet, yet full of unadulterated apricot flavor.  Having all three items in your mouth at once was a marriage of several flavors that, amazingly enough, worked very well and made a boring appetizer something amazing.\n\nNext up was my entree and it was near perfection.  It may sound boring: buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables, but it really wasn't. The chicken was fresh and cooked to flawlessness - juicy inside and crispy outside with a lot of flavor.  The mashed potatoes were incredible since I can tell it was loaded with butter and cream (this is why I never make mashed potatoes at home).  The vegetables tasted like they had just been plucked from a near-by farm earlier that day especially for me...I really enjoyed the fact that the zucchini was not over-cooked and still had a bit of \"crunch\" to it.  The presentation was great, but it looked even better once the plate was clean and I had eaten every morsel.\n\nThe evening finished with what I can only describe as something sinful: caramel toffee bread pudding.  I almost always get chocolate for dessert, but I'm glad I changed my mind at the last minute.  First of all, it's a huge portion, second of all it was swimming in caramel and that was enough for me.  As with everything else I'd eaten there so far, it tasted fresh...someone had made bread pudding literally when I ordered it and I could taste the milk and eggs and cinnamon and other yummy goodness that went into the dessert.  The pudding was soft and decadent, yet hearty and wonderful.  Toffee encrusted the top of the pudding and oozed into the upper nooks and crannies - it was syrupy-sweet and buttery goodness. Did I mention it was swimming in caramel?  I've had homemade caramel before, but this stuff was something else: sweet, rich, slight salty and completely amazing.  \n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone...I'm not sure if they can completely accommodate those who are finicky eaters, but if you enjoy American Comfort food, this place takes the ordinary to extraordinary heights.", "author": "Ken G."}

Our table ordered:\n\nPeppers stuffed with crab: I don't normally like peppers but these were fantastic\n\nChowder (soup of the day): Creamy without being heavy, good flavor\n\nTuna tartare: I am not the biggest raw fish fan but this was delicious\n\nSteak: Fantastic cut of meat with amazing sauce!!!\n\nSalmon: Also very good (though I was happy I ordered the steak...)\n\nCoffee and doughnuts: WOW\n\nButterscotch dessert: Good, but really rich so I could only eat a few bites", "author": "Amy F."}

Showed up on Friday night to find a nice atmosphere, great waitress, cool vibe. Passed by a bunch of trendy folks (with really nice shoes) at the bar on the way to be seated in dining room. \n\nDrink menu was interesting but a good example of all of the the restaurants that are trying too hard to be unique.  My wife had a drink that was like a mix between concentrated lime juice and battery acid. I had a froo-froo drink which was OK and then went to the old standby, a Hendricks Martini straight up with xtra olives which was good. They make their own soda as well and Wylie requested one of the sodas with a little Absolut and it was good. \n\nI had the butter lettuce salad with bleu cheese (yum) and the flatiron steak mid rare. Steak was cooked nicely and tender with a very rich and tasty mushroom based (?) gravy on it. I know a lot of people don't like sauces on their steaks (me, too, most of the time) but this was a good fit and went down nicely with the pureed potatoes on the side. \n\nTo be fair, my friend Wylie gives this place 5 stars (he had the butter lettuce salad and the app BBQ shrimp as a main). But, it's my rating so I'm going with 4 stars with the right to change my mind on subsequent visits. Overall, a nice experience and a place that I would put in the Top 20 rotation for SF.", "author": "Robert W."}

It was creamy but light and flavorful.\n\nI had Salmon for my main course and my husband had the Flat Iron steak. We also had a side of cornbread, which was not noteworthy. The Salmon was cooked perfectly and had a delicious sauce and corn relish. The steak was served over potatoes and also had a rich sauce that was very good.

I really like restaurants that have a vision and execute well.  Nothing is more disappointing then a fusion restaurants that tries to do everything and something from each continent.  Think cherrystone clams with breadcrumbs, lemon, parsley, and garlic.  Perfectly seared scallops are served with a very filling and comforting jambalaya.  One of the best fried chicken dishes in SF was served with mashed potato and gravy and corn.  And the most decadent toffee cake, which being heavy and super sweet, we were able to polish off entirely because it was that good.\n\nThe wine list has some good choices, and I really appreciated that they had a decent by the glass selection that included some for $7 or $8.\n\nService was professional, although a little on the slow side.

Granted last night's reservation was for 8:30 (boo... us Californians eat early!), I was still excited and ready for my fried chicken fix.\n\nTown Hall did not disappoint. The buttermilk fried chicken was really good. It was perfectly battered. Not too much and not too oily. It was crunchy on the outside and the poultry was juicy on the inside. The pieces were tiny but enough for a serving. It was a tad on the salty side but when you just want to taste something satisfyingly unhealthy, it's really good. I coulda licked those bones clean, but alas- we were in public, worse yet a fine dining establishment in SF.\n\nThe chicken was served with yukon gold mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. Very good sides. Very comforting and a nice precursor to Thanksgiving. I can't wait for more of this. Overall, I would have to say Chez Panisse has the best buttermilk fried chicken, but Town Hall makes a nice second. \n\nFor dessert, the only thing that caught my eye was the pear cherry crisp with ginger ice cream. But did I get it? No! I'm embracing the life of a minimalist. No appetizers and no more dessert. No need for all those excess calories or pretending I have an dispensable salary. I was full enough on the main course. Quite content actually.\n\nMy friend had the duck and it was smothered with gravy. It reminded me of the mole sauce at Colibri. I'd like to go back to Colibri. She ate half of her meal and asked for the rest to be boxed up. Later in the car, way up on California Street, she had realized Town Hall never gave her her left overs. \n\nAs for last touches, instead of the lame black bill fold emblazoned with Amex logos, Town Halls serves the check in between old books. How cute! How cool! The title of the book was \"In Need of Change.\" How fitting for me. The dinner reminded me of a lot of things past and how much I need to go forward. I even shed a few tears.

It was Zac's birthday and since the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed, we swung by Town Hall on a whim. It was 9:30 on a Sunday and they closed at 10, luckily they seated us. We had Hillary as our server and she was amazing. Outstanding service. She was attentive, polite, suggestive- but not pushy. All of her suggestions were spot on and she listened to what we wanted. She made Zac's birthday special and was one of the best servers we have ever encountered. Please give her a raise or something! If you go to Town Hall ask for Hillary as your server! \n\nThe food was awesome. We had the shrimp, petrale sole, hangar steak and short ribs, smoked andouille jambalay, and for dessert the donuts with blue bottle ice cream and chicory streusel. I loved Town Hall and loved the service we received from Hillary. She gave us recommendations for next time and let us pick her brain for other restaurants to try in the city. She's amazing. I would definitely recommend Town Hall for anyone looking for a special experience or some good Southern food. The Kentucky Gun was also delicious. I will be back very soon!", "author": "Kristy H."}

We got there at about 8 and it was packed. The place is pretty big - there is an upstairs and a downstairs dining area. The ambience is pretty nice - lots of oak wood and trendy accents. We waited at the bar for them to get our table ready and I ordered the tastiest drink. It's called the Life of Riley, which consists of Skyy vodka, muddled watermelon & basil, and a bunch of other yummy goodness served up with sugar on the rim of the martini glass. It was delicious!!!\n\nWhen we were seated about 15 minutes later, we ordered a mix of their oysters on the halfshell. Would have been a good appetizer had the waitress not forgotten to put in the order. She was honest about it though and told us that she had completely forgotten and she was going to bring them to us on the house. Score! Waitress- you are forgiven. Oysters were fresh and worth the wait.\n\nFor my main course I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. What. The. Eff. This was so freaking amazing. The skin was so crispy, not greasy like a lot of the other fried chicken dishes I've had. The chicken was very tender as well. I can't speak to the sides besides I ate all 3 pieces of chicken first and could only manage a small taste of the sides because the portion size of the chicken was pretty large and by that time I thought I had to be wheeled out of the restaurant because I was so full. I ain't a small girl, either.\n\nI would definitely come back to this place next time I'm in the bay area. I would order the fried chicken again too. Mmm.", "author": "Carol L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-20", "description": "3.5 stars\n\nI came to Town Hall for a work celebratory lunch so we had the private dining room upstairs.  It was a mostly predetermined menu with 2 options each for the appetizer (tuna tartare or heirloom tomato w/ feta salad), entree (salmon or chicken paillard salad), and dessert (butterscotch/chocolate pot de creme or smores tart).\n\nThe verdict:\nTuna tartare - came w/ lightly fried green tomatoes, green onion tabasco vinaigrette.  I thought this was prepared quite well, with just a hint of kick in the tartare itself.\n\nSalmon - It's not on the main lunch menu (i checked the website) but it came with a fruit-oriented sauce, over a white corn macque choux and okra.  I think this was favored over salmon, and it was delicious!  \n\nChicken Paillard Salad - tasty, but a salad is a salad.  It was a huge mountain of lettuce studded with big thick chunks of bacon (yum!), good ripe avocado cubes, and a mustard-based vinaigrette.  \n\nPot de creme - pretty much awesome in a jar.  The toffee was really the highlight, delicious and not to sweet.  I couldn't taste too much butterscotch, but it might be because the chocolate portion was pretty rich (and so good).\n\nSmores Tart - this is definitely for someone who loves chocolate.  It's really rich, as it's a wedge of essentially solid mostly bittersweet chocolate with a graham cracker crust and salted caramel marshmellow on top.  Most people that ordered it couldn't finish the chocolate part but seemed to enjoy the marshmellow and the crust.\n\nThe service was fine, though the server's quick movements when pouring water ended up in some water/ice getting flung onto my appetizer plate.  She didn't notice and I didn't complain since I was pretty much done with the app, but I think she did do some water spillage from not waiting to finish pouring before moving her arm away on other occasions.\n\nThe food is good but the options seemed pretty plain and without too much inventiveness.  Granted, as I said it was a fixed menu so I didn't get to see the full range of the kitchen's skills.  That said, they used really good quality ingredients and the plates were executed very well.  \n\nI'll just have to come back again to get the full Town Hall experience!", "author": "Naoko M."}

The past year has seen an explosion of restaurants that are of exceptional quality and value, and value is the key here.  \n\nA couple of thoughts:\n1) The BBQ shrimp appetizer was served with the shrimp uncooked.  Yes, uncooked.  You did read that right.  They actually served the appetizer with the shrimp uncooked.  I know a slight oversight, especially with all of the delicious sauce served on top of it.  But, what the hell!??  The sauce they serve it in is a beautifully tastying worcestershire and butter and its dark.  Its lathers the shrimp and yes, at times, it can be hard to tell if the shrimp is cooked or not.  But obviously someone has prepared this so many times that they didn't even realize it.  Who is handling this stuff?  None of shrimp was warm.  Quite the egregious oversight.  Yikes.\n\n2) Prices for appetizers and prices in general are a little high for the portion sizes.  The food here has a certain American comfort feel to it.  Its definitely creole and Louisiana flavoring, and this is unique in this city.  Despite this however, it just comes off as a little overpriced for what you are getting.  The cheapest item on the menu is still the delicious fried chicken, and that is 23 dollars.  Not too bad, but everything else is closer to 30. \n\nChicken is still one of the best in the city.  \n\nDr. Louis drink is excellent....way too much ice though.  Had probably 5 sips and I was done.  Disappointing.  Went with the beer, and that was 6 dollars for a bottle.", "author": "Mark K."}

The experience at this restaurant really reminded me how it is difficult to find a good restaurants like in New York and Tokyo in San Francisco.\n\nI had butter lettuce salad with apple and walnut.  I was hoping to get a similar salad I had at the Chez Pannise.---a gem salad, indeed it was a gem salad, unlike other dished I had at Chez Pannise.(I cannot still believe Chez Panisse has one star. Do they deserve?)\nWell back to TH, it was too heavy.. I felt like eating Cezar salad I have at one of the pizza place, La Val, near my school.  Reason?  Too much dressing.  I love butter lettuce because it crisp, but when it is soaked with blue cheese dressing too much, it just lose its freshness.  Big mistake, a huge mistake.  It need light dressing such as only olive oil and lemon, because if the salad is fresh enough, it is good enough,  dressing should not play the lead role, let the veges play!\n\nI had Crab Ravioli with some fish, I do not remember.\nOne thing about how to cook fish... maybe because I am from Japan, where we cook very simple... You guys overdo fish too much...\nI am not French, I do not want my fish to be swimming in butter or oil. I think what they should have done is to crisply grill with olive oil. so that the skin or the surface of the fish can have a good harmony of crispness and moisture.  Instead of that, my fish was swimming... in a white sauce... The Ravioli itself was good, but I wanted more. I only had two piece. I would rather have more raviolis than my fish swimming in butter.\n\nFor desert, I had chocolate crisp bar with peanut ice cream.  It was ok, nothing that would blow mind, though. \n\nOverall, I am very disappointed by the experience at TH.. Maybe I did not go there when they had dishes of my taste.

I was particularly pleased by the adorable self-promotional cards they have next to their entrance/bar area that we checked out while waiting for a table. See, this place has got one good creative marketer working for them. Instead of plain business cards laying out waiting for customers to grab as they leave through the front door they have recipe cards that do the same trick. On these cards, recipes for dishes such as Tuna Tartare, Roasted Veal Meatballs, and New Orleans BBQ Shrimp are printed. I really liked this idea for a restaurant calling card and its something that I can see myself keeping and sticking into a recipe file. Totally smart marketing on Town Hall's part.\n\nAs for the food - my friend and I both ordered the fish and chips and it was so so so good. The fries were just perfect - probably double fried and the fish was absolutely light and moist. The fish was almost too hard to pick up and dip in the tartar sauce, because it was so delicate. I considered that to be a sign that the battered piece of fish was high quality. \n\nI definitely I like this place and will try and go back when I have a good occasion to enjoy myself at lunch.

I was looking over the menu and focused on the jalapeno cream sauce that came with the ham and cheese toast. After the waiter described the dish a bit more (bread with thin ham slices, topped with a slow poached egg and then topped again with the sauce), I was sold. It didn't have a side, so we ordered the tuna tartare with fried green tomatoes as a starter.\n\nThe tuna/tomatoes were a pretty decent.  While I prefer a firmer tomato, the batter was lovely. The tuna was not overly dressed, which was nice because the actual fish flavor came through.\n\nOur sandwiches came out, and instantly I fell in love.  I have always been a sucker for a good cream sauce, and this did not leave me wanting.  The jalapenos were quick fried with that same lovely batter as the fried green tomatoes, and the egg was done perfectly.  The bread was a bit crispy and required cutting with a knife, but all in all a fantastic dish.\n\nTo reward ourselves for picking such a great place, we shared the coffee and doughnuts...OMG.

Absolutely wonderful experience.\n\nThe food was fantastic from start to finish. I started with the frog's legs which were very good. I had never had frog's legs before so I wasn't sure what to expect, but they turned out to be tasty and the risotto that they were presented on top of was duly excellent.\n\nI went for duck as I often do when restaurants offer it. This was easily the second best duck I have EVER had. Only Spruce has impressed me more with duck, and I think they win because they used the breast as opposed to the legs (as Town Hall does), so there were no bones to contend with. The flavor was amazing. \n\nI also sampled some of the fried chicken which was a tad uninspiring, but nevertheless pretty good. I suppose any other meat after that duck was going to come up short.\n\nDessert was pot de la creme which was epically good.

Fortunately, my wife and I had reservations and were greeted and seated immediately: a plus. Water, bread and a menu were brought to our table as we sat down: a plus. Our waiter, Christian, was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. He gave us a really good tip: On busy nights it is a good idea to order the entree and starters at the same time otherwise, there could be a long wait between courses. \nTo start, we ordered the fried oysters floating on a green sauce (I think it was parsley) placed in the shell. A nice presentation and delicious, even without the green sauce, which was tasteless. Another appetizer we had was the muffins and prosciutto presented with a unique peppery jam. I had my doubts but the combination and quality of ingredients worked really well together. \nWe didn't wait long for the second course (Thank you, Christian) For entrees, we ordered the signature dish of fried chicken with mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts. A yelp reviewer called it the best fried chicken in the city. It was really good - crispy skin and juicy interior - but a couple of places in Oakland would give it pretty good run for its money. \nI ordered the pork ribs cooked Memphis-style that was accompanied by a killer sweet sauce, fried cornbread and roasted string beans. I loved it. Six meaty ribs with a spicy dry rub dipped that was enhanced by the BBQ sauce. It was really, really good but judging BBQ is so subjective because of the different sauces and methods of cooking.\nI was surprised that by late Saturday they had run out of a couple of desserts but the chocolate and butterscotch pudding topped with chocolate and butterscotch brittle was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Needless to say, it was eagerly consumed.\nThe beer selection was adequate and complemented the dishes we ordered. (I'm not sure wine would stand up to the spicy nature of the food.) \nOn the negative side -- and I'm being really picky here -- down-home southern food and upscale seem to me to be a contradiction in terms. I'm talking about peasant food - ribs and fried chicken - that should be eaten with the fingers not daintily cut with knife and fork, which was being done by most of the restaurant's clientele. I'm not a snob or anti-snob or a pinky-in-the-air type of guy. I know that's more a reflection of me and not Town Hall's customers but at the very least, a wet towelette or wet-wipe should have been offered after those mouthwatering ribs. \nThe other major negative was the noise level which was at least 5 bells. I thought I was at a Giants game it was so loud. Would I go back? Definitely - in spite of the overly mannered clientele and the feeling of sitting in the ballpark bleachers there are some interesting dishes I'd love to try. I love the casual dress and down home food. Prices were reasonable for the quality of food and ambiance.

It's too bad that there are a few factors that can mess up a good thing... \n\nWe came here as a group of 8 for for dinner and while I liked the ambiance and almost old-school industrial feel, there were several key points that were lacking.  Service was slow, even when they knew about our time constraints.  Not that the food took awhile, it was the nice waitress that took awhile to take our orders.  Another lacking quality was their drinks.  Their sweet tea \"something something\" was not good.  I guess it was supposed to taste like peach?  No.  I rarely EVER return drinks, but this one, I had to.  As a replacement, I took the safe route and got a beer.  Can't go wrong with that...  \n\nMy dishes were disappointing...The tuna tartar with fried green tomatos was okay...nothing spectacular.  I found myself trying to pawn it off onto other people because it was too much of a mediocre thing.  Of course, I had the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin...The pork was oh so tender, but I would've liked the bacon to be more crispy, rather than baked with the pork.   \n\nFear not, not everything was under par.  The fried okra side was super yummy, not too fried, but perfectly crispy.  A highlight of dinner would definitely have to be the catfish.  It was tender, a bit charred on the outside and flavored to perfection.  Another highlight had to be the fried chicken.  It was crunchy and juicy on the inside, but a bit on the undercooked side near the bone.  The ribs were alright, although the BBQ sauce was sweet, tangy, spicy and delish. \n\nOverall, I could've said that it was a \"Meh, I've experienced better\" rating (because I HAVE experienced better at better prices)...but I feel I need to give it another shot.

Mom and I had the Dorothy Parker (think lemony martini) and my sister got The Fine Line (tequila concoction). All drinks were superb and definitely refreshing.\n\nAs an appetizer we ordered several of the oysters recommended by our very nice waiter as well as the sardines. We had mixed reviews on the sardines, Dad and I really liked the smokey flavor, sister was not sold. The oysters were very tasty and fresh. We also split an order of the roasted beet salad (SO GOOD) but it definitely could have been bigger, or used more greens, there were just a few measly pieces of mache lettucs with beets mixed in with one goat cheese croquette to be found. Great flavors just lacking in size.\n\nAs an entree we all stuck with fish dishes, I had the grilled catfish with rice and okra, Dad had the fried Buttermilk Chicken (one of their staple dishes), sister had the Grouper and mom had the Sole. Everything was delicious but the real winners were the side dishes!! On the side, we made a game time decision and ordered the smoked andouille sausage jambalaya (salivating as I reminisce over this dish) as well as the cheese grits (so smooth and creamy). For a family of southerners, we were thoroughly impressed with these two side dishes, dishes that are hard to find this well done outside of the south. Next time I go, I'm just going to get the beet salad and a side order of jambalaya and I'll be set! I ate more of the jambalaya than I did my entree, honestly... if you love spicy and you love jambalaya... this is it!! Whew, okay, I'll stop.\n\nOn to dessert, we split an order of the 'Coffee and Donuts' as well as the Butterscotch and Chocolate Pots de Creme. Honestly, I could've done without both, neither of them knocked my socks off. (I actually wanted to try the cheesecake, but being the nice host that I am, I let the other women in my fam pick the desserts). They weren't bad, but when you're going to partake in consuming extra calories in dessert, I want to be floored ;)\n\nAll in all, the staff and service was excellent, water glass was always full, waiter was full of great recommendations and was very attentive.

Our evening at Town Hall was nearly perfect.\n\nI arrived first, was greeted immediately and checked in.  When I apologized for the rest of my party being a bit late, I was assured there was no hurry, and that I was welcome to sit at the bar until they arrived.  As I warmed the barstool, the informative bartender encouraged me to try new samples of things, and through her I discovered a new favorite - Old Tom gin.  When my family arrived, all smiles and joy, we were shown to our table.\n\nWhen dining out as a family, we always take the early seating (5:45 in this case) so other diners can enjoy some adult-only time afterwards.  We never felt rushed by the waitstaff despite lingering longer than most of the other family tables.  For this reason I rate this restaurant \"Good for Kids\", but note that there is no kids menu, or crayons on the table tops.  It's not that kind of a place.  Nor should it be.  But if your kids are well behaved, and good eaters you can add this to your list of go-to spots.\n\nNote: often the difference between a good and a bad rating simply depends on the waitperson one gets.  Surprisingly, I saw a textbook  example of a bad one on the payroll here.  Had he been assigned to our table, my rating would have been drastically different.  Luckily our server (John? Sean? - it is a bit loud inside the charming brick walls) was excellent - though enthusiastic and cheerful, he never crossed the point of appropriateness.  \n\nAnd his guidance on the menu was honest and accurate.  Our 8 year-old daughter wanted the tuna tartare but was concerned the wasabi would make it too hot until we were assured that it could be toned down.  In fact, the waiter returned with the dish and news that the chef was so happy a kid had ordered this dish that he would more than gladly tone it down even further if she still found it too hot.\n\nMy wife's beef was tender and perfect in every way, as was our daughter's duck breast - she even ate every bite, which is sometimes rare at that age.  My pork medallions (wrapped in bacon) were perfectly done, moist and tender, and drizzled in a reduction sauce that featured an Asian five spice that paired beautifully with a 1994 Napa Meritage (Rubicon) that had aged perfectly.  Drink these now, if you find any!\n\nSpeaking of the wine, the Sommelier (who helped create flawless service by assisting in other roles as needed) offered to decant and filter the wine, as there was a fair amount of sediment.  He did this away from the table, likely due to the lack of aisle space, but had I been paying attention I'd have requested table-side decanting just to keep an eye on things.\n\nWe'll be back, and I encourage you to go soon!", "author": "Dave C."}

They came piled like Lincoln logs and hit the spot with what might be the first piece of cornbread I've ever enjoyed. My buddy got the fried chicken, which was maybe better than the ribs. We also had the calamari starter, which came laid out in three little squids stuffed with a mince and topped with a black bean sauce. All delicious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-09-09", "description": "Sept 2012\nContext: we have been coming here for about four years mostly for lunch with several dinners as well. We have had such better experiences in the past that our expectations are petty high.  This was our anniversary dinner on a Saturday night at 7:30.\nAtmosphere: town hall has an enclosed, heated patio, which was empty the night we were there, a bar area with a large communal table in the bar area, and then a cavernous eating area with some tables abutting the windows, looking out on a not very nice street, larger tables in the middle and then two tops against the wall. Decor is contemporary neutral with large, unusual light fixtures.  When we arrived, they were about half full with steady business all night.\nService: we were greeted promptly at the door, our reservation confirmed, the guy went to see if the table was ready and we were taken to our seat. To the extent that service can improve, remain neutral or subtract from a dinner experience, this was sadly in the later. This has not usually been our experience here, but from the greeter to our server to the water person, I don't think we saw one smile.  Our server was efficient and reliable but not much else. From my perspective, good waitstaff is adapt at tuning into the diners needs and responding to them. This server was simply doing her job competently if somewhat impatiently. A few minutes after we sat down she showed up asking \"did we need advice on drinks?\" which I was totally not ready for. We hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu, so we indicated not quite yet which seemed to irritate her and she went off.  The remainder of the night continued in that vein with repeated requests for when we're we going to order the next course, etc.\nDrinks: we started with a glass of wine, a Barbara syrah mix recommended by the server. At no point did she ever suggest we try the wine, which I found unusual. In the past, if I ask what might go with a particular dish, the server will say a suggestion and then say, would you like a taste. She never did this and never once asked if we liked the wine either.  The wine was okay. She suggested it as a pairing for BBQ shrimp but it did not seem to go. I picked the seghesio zin for my next glass because I knew I liked it. This wine experience contributed to our disappointment because usually we come here for the wine. We like to have recommendations and try new wines. In the past, my favorite white wine glass came from town hall and a server's recommendation. I don't know if staff has changed or we just got a bad night.\nFood: the BBQ shrimp and truffle risotto were stand out dishes. Both were wonderful and I wish we had stopped there. The BBQ shrimp has five or six large shrimp served on a piece of bread covered in an incredibly rich, luscious sauce that I would call more of a,Louisiana hot cream sauce then BBQ but I would have licked the plate of the generous portion of sauce if it weren't quite so rich. The risotto was also incredibly rich and generously portioned.\nFor our mains,  I asked if the ribs or catfish was richer. The server said definitely the ribs because, she said, the portion was huge. But, when I got the catfish, literally covered in pork belly, I couldn't imagine anything richer. It was blackened but did not have much flavor other than salty. The other main we got was the pacific salmon with eggplant on potatoes. It was almost tasteless, not a good salmon prep.\nDessert is always the butterscotch budino and it was as good as usual, but also rich.\nOverall: big disappointment because of high expectations and because we know we can go elsewhere and get a much better experience. Felt like a wasted dinner out.", "author": "Vivek V."}

The place was packed at 7:30 with afterwork diners.  The restaurant is very spacious with a covered outdoor seating area, which looked cozy.  Since my friend and I couldn't make reservations, we sat at the bar area, which isn't too bad.  \n\nWe weren't too hunger, so we ordered four appetizers to share - butter lettuce, soft shell crab, barbecue shrimp, and Piquillo peppers.  My favorite was actually the butter lettuce salad - the portion was generous and very flavorful.  I wasn't too keen about the rest of the dishes - too much sauce on everything.  \n\nThe best thing about the experience was probably the ambience.  The place has a lot of character - it's urban and upscale without the slick polish of places that are trying to hard to be trendy. There is an upstairs, private dining area as well.  The restroom area is a bit inconvenient for people dining downstairs since they are all upstairs.  Also, parking is a hassle if you are driving in since it is difficult to get street parking at night.  I used the parking lot on Howard and 1st, which cost me $20 dollars.  Also, the price is on the high end.  Four appetizers and two glasses of wine came out to be well over a hundred dollars (including tip).  \n\nOverall, not a bad experience.

Split the bill after adding a 20% tip (although the waitress was borderline pushy) and it came to $75 pp.  Pretty much what we expected to spend.  That said, we did expect to eat for that price.\n\nFood-wise, Town Hall really fell short for our party. Particularly the Cajun seafood pot pie which two people ordered. Neither diner found much in the way of seafood in the meals. There were carrots and potatoes, and one pinky-sized piece of whitefish. Between the two meals there were no shrimp or scallops or crawdads. If there was any crab, it was a strand here or there -- most certainly not any discernible lumps.

They were so attentive to detail and made sure to get clarification on all of our preferences prior to the event:  the table orientation, the beverages we wanted to offer, the menu title created specifically for us...ect... Also, the service was 100% perfect thanks to Matt and Maritza.  They were so attentive and accommodated any special requests/questions and ensured that everyone was happy and comfortable.  I also need to add that what impressed me the integrity and ethics of this business. Apparently there was a small charge that was added in error to our bill the night of the event.  This was certainly not noticed by the event host who signed the bill and left.  Two days later, Marissa contacted us to let us know that they caught this mistake and that they corrected it by crediting the host's credit card with the appropriate amount. This is a breath of fresh air!  They could have easily said nothing and no one would have known, but the fact that they went out of their way to correct this speaks volumes about how trustworthy and honest this establishment and its' employees are.  Thank you so much, Town Hall, Marissa, Maritza and Matt!  We will absolutely plan future evens there.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

A must have is the pulled pork sandwich. But buyer beware you'll have to run a few marathons to burn off all that yummy goodness but it's SO worth it. \n\nOther dishes I've has are the Fried chicken sandwich. I think it's quite tasty with the spicy slaw but I kind of wish they served the chicken hot. Though it's nothing that a microwave oven can't fix. \n\nThey have a rotating special and today's was their steak sandwich. Usually it's quite tasty but for some reason today it tasted a bit bland. I should have gotten some BBQ sauce on the side to jazz up the flavors a bit. \n\noohh and the best part of grabbing grub from Town Hall's BBQ are the chocolate chip cookies. They are SOOOO yummy and gooey.", "author": "She R. A."}

As such, the first encounter (went with some friends) was a total \"WOW!\", and I found myself thinking what a great place it was, how great was the food, etc. \n\nThe second visit (I had already been to other places) was still a nice two thumbs up for the food (if I'd had three thumbs it would be a \"three thumbs up\"), but started noticing other details that went unnoticed on the first visit: our waiter had a bit of a snob attitude (i.e. my missus and I got the \"how would you not have dessert\" look). Anyway, I'm splitting hair here, the service was still alright... it's just that look that bothered me. \n\nThis is the only reason why I didn't give the place the awaited 5-star rating. The food was still amazing, the portions were perfect (which is something I was gladly surprised... coming from Barcelona I found the US' version of a \"portion\" something we would use to feed 5 people for a week), and the atmosphere was great. Wine was a bit expensive (much more expensive than in Europe), but that seems to be a US thing and not necessarily something related to Town Hall. \n\nMy top recommendation? The BBQ shrimp over a garlic herb toast with Worcestershire... in three words: A-MA-ZING!", "author": "Roberto B."}

It doesn't change often though and is somewhat limited.

I had tried to schedule a work team dinner here at a friend's suggestion, but booking out even 2 weeks in advance for a party of 10 + is very difficult.  Yet, for 3 individuals, it was not a problem at all.  The space is OPEN and the decor, definitely does remind me of a southern town hall meeting space.\n\nThe food is contemporary American comfort food.  Our table started off with a mixed blend of the oysters, which were fresh and delightful.  One friend ordered the Osso Bucco (melt in the mouth delicious).  I ordered the Fried Chicken, which was good, but I'm a hard sell b/c I will ALWAYS remember the fried chicken in the South where I grew up being succulent on the inside and crispy goodness on the outside.  This chicken was not anything to write home to mom about.  My friends ordered scallops, which were well seasoned and prepared.\n\nMy favorite was the osso bucco.  \n\nWith 3 glasses of wine and 1 iced tea and the 3 entrees with oysters, the cost with tax = 154.08.   \n\nThe service was SUPERB and ON POINT that night.\n\nI've only been there once and that was last year in 2009, but I would go back again to check it out with a group.

It was effing loud in this bitch.\n\nAnyway, back to my review. Holy mother of hell- I think I just had the best fried chicken ever! Oh my jeebus, that fried chicken was soooo mouth watering!  Each and every bite was very succulent and cooked to perfection. The breast meat was the best part. It was nice and juicy.  Oh ,and don't forget about the skin! Flavorful and crispy.  *Drools* I still can't get over how good it tasted. I bet they deep fried it in lard. \n\nMy meal also came with mashed potatoes. OMG, it was sooo rich and creamy! I think I just ate a pound of frickin' butter. It was damn good.  I LOVED it!\n\nWe also ordered their jalapeno cornbread. I was expecting a huge portion or bread.

I could probably eat one loaf of those. \n\nWe also tried their jambalaya and fried mac n cheese. Delicious.  BTW, this place is VERY LOUD and crowded! Not a good place to take a date. Wait, I take that back. You can actually sit outside. They have heat lamps and its not as noisy. Oh, and our server was very helpful and nice. \n\nI forgot to mention this place is kind of expensive. Expect to pay over $20 for an entree. I believe my fried chicken dinner was around $22-$25. Damn, that some expensive ass chicken but definitely worth it.  I got to sample everyone's dish.

We were seated immediately. There were a few empty tables and I believe some walk-ins arrived and were promptly seated, too. The community table at the front was packed.\n\nEverything from top to bottom was spot on. Our waitress (Taylor) was very knowledgeable about the menu, and we had lots of questions. She actually UNrecommended something because of our particular tastes. Service was prompt and efficient without being overbearing or intrusive. Plates and silverware left and arrived at our table unnoticed. We did not want for anything.\n\nI see a lot of people on Yelp complaining about 'bad' or 'slow' service, and I can understand that Americans (of which I am one) are bred to expect fast, discourteous service. If this is you, then by all means do not go to Town Hall. We were there for an hour and a half and were allowed to enjoy all facets of the meal at a pace more akin to an afternoon in the park, instead of a drive-through. I would not go here if you are in a hurry but this does not indicate 'bad' service. It was paced so that you could enjoy yourself, have some conversation, get some people watching done and have that dessert hit your table at just the right time.\n\nThe food was delicious, too. I had the ribs and they were grilled to perfection. The sauce on the side was good but unnecessary. My wife had a steak and it was way better than Epic Roasthouse. Those tater tots were ridiculous(ly delicious.) Also, try the house-made cranberry soda. Yum.\n\nIt was pouring rain outside on New Year's day and we didn't want to leave the warm comfort of this place, and we didn't feel under pressure to do so. The host/manager thanked us on our way out.\n\nMy wife and I are not, uh, 'classy' people and though there was a certain hipster vibe to the patronage, I felt like we were treated just like anyone else. Friendly and professional, even though I was just wearing a T-Shirt and flannel (a T-shirt that one of the bussers recognized and complimented me on.)\n\nWe loved our experience here and will certainly be back.\n\nUPDATE: My wife and I have come back to Town Hall several times since the original review, and each time the experience has been perfect. The staff is well trained and professional, yet amicable. The food is always fabulous.

Everything was quite good, though I think Town Hall risks being overshadowed by other, newer restaurants in this price range and genre (e.g., Wayfare Tavern) if it does not mix things up a bit. \n\nPros: \n- Quick seating, attentive service. Our reservation was at 5:30 on a Saturday, so anything else would have been inexcusable. But nonetheless, the service was good. And even during a busy lunch rush the service is usually pretty good. \n- The food is solid. I think everything I had was well-prepared. The croque madame (they call it something different) appetizer was actually really inventive and a bit decadent. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone good and the portion was HUGE. My friend ordered the excellent fried chicken (very flavorful, not greasy at all) which was also enormous.  Finishing three courses at these sizes will be a challenge. The crispy okra side is always a favorite. We didn't order dessert (even though we'd intended to) because we were full. \n- The waiter gave great alcohol recommendations for my friend who had a lot of things he liked and didn't like. I ordered a glass of zinfandel (the only one on the by-the-glass menu) and thought it was a really great representation of the varietal. I'm sad I didn't write down the label. \n- They were accommodating. We shared an appetizer, and the waiter suggested one suitable for that purpose. I hate cilantro, so the waiter asked the chef to prepare a lemon aioli along with the cilantro aioli. \n- The pricing is solid for the quality and the type of restaurant. \n\nCons: \n- The food isn't the most inventive. Perhaps this is a niche they are filling, as not everyone is into the latest molecular gastronomy and having savory foams cover everything. I prefer a balance -- such as Range. Or even Wayfare Tavern. But the food is really solid, just not the most interesting thing in San Francisco. \n- The location isn't ideal for weekends, or even weeknights. Great for a business lunch or dinner, but I tend to stick with neighborhood places for dinner. Nothing they can change, but a consideration. Parking can be a pain. I'm not sure whether or not they have valet. \n\nOverall, a solid four stars. I'm a fan, though with a couple of reservations.", "author": "Tom P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-01-21", "description": "Deceitful. Found overages totaling close to $100 on our bill. \n\nOn 12/17/13, our team went to Town Hall for our Holiday Get Together. For a group of our size 13, I had to sign a contract with the date, time, amount of people, agree to pay a 20% gratuity that would be automatically added to our bill, and provide a credit card number. I emailed the completed contract back. I received an email confirming they had received my contract and were confirming my reservation; however, it was the wrong date and for 14 people. Later I received an email from another person confirming the date, time, and number of people and that it would be at the communal table. I thought \" I guess they got their act together and must have noticed their error and were now confirming the correct information.\" No, the following week I get a phone call confirming my reservation but the lady rattles off the wrong date and wrong number of people so I asked who she was trying to reach, that she may be calling the wrong person. To my surprise, she said my name. So I told this lady, the information was incorrect and that I could resend (email) a copy of my signed contract with the details of my reservation.  All this time, we are still on the phone. She then says she received my contract and tells me she will correct the info and email me a confirmation. We are still on the line but when I receive her email, she has 14 people. I tell her my reservation is still incorrect. It's for 13 so she corrects it and we hang up.\nIf that wasn't enough drama, on the date of our get together, we place our orders and most of the food comes out except two orders of salmon. Those orders don't show up until almost everyone else is finished with their entrees. After all that waiting, one of the salmon orders comes out well done. It was supposed to be prepared medium rare. So that order has to be returned to the kitchen. While that's being done, three okra appetizers are being brought to our table. We say, \" we did not order these, most of us are finished with our meal. The hostess says they are COMPLIMENTARY so we accept them. They were not COMPLIMENTARY. And when the returned salmon order is replaced, the salmon is too rare and the person did not bother eating it. The drama continues...\nBeing that we have a large group, it was hard for me to know what people ordered so I went ahead and paid the bill. However, the next day when I was reconciling the bill and found out what each person had ordered, I saw that we were charged for those three orders of supposedly complimentary okra. Price for the okra is supposed to be $6 per order. We were charged $36 for the 3. So besides charging us for something that was supposed to be free, they hit us with a double whammie. 3 X $6 = $18. On the receipt, it shows 3 okras for $36. You think that was bad enough.\nIn reviewing the receipt further, I found that we were charged twice for the two orders of salmon. Each order is $22. On one entry on the bill shows 2 salmon = $44 which is correct, but further down there is another entry for 1 salmon for $44. So here we are double charged again.\nSo $36 + $44 = $80 that we are overcharged. This is not even including the 20% gratuity which makes it almost $100 that we were overcharged. So I emailed Town Hall and told them I would be in that afternoon to have them credit my credit card with these overages. When I get there, they took off these overages no problem.  When I said this was unacceptable, the two ladies apologized and then offered to invite us back. So I asked if this was going to complimentary. I said they can't expect me to have everyone return and expect them to pay for everything and probably get overcharged again. There was dead silence. Then Marissa said she would speak to the manager about maybe sending us a gift card. Well, here it is Jan. 21, more than a month later and no word from the manager. Not even a formal apology.\nOur food bill was $484 (with their overcharges) and our liquor bill was $638.40. A total of over $1,000. I guess they don't value their customers. They should have at least deducted the two salmon orders that came out so late. \nSo BEWARE people. Be sure to review your receipt. When I asked how this could have happened, they blamed it on the computer. But someone has to key in the orders of okra and salmon that weren't supposed to be there and why is the amount so inflated on the incorrect items. \nA very dissatisfied customer, actually many dissatisfied customers since no one from our group will return.

My friend's toast was very rich and probably heart-attack inducing if ingested to an extreme.\n\nAfter we finished our dinner, there was still some bread left over in the basket, so I took another slice and buttered it up.  While I was chomping away on my bread, our waiter came by and cleared our plates very quickly and wordlessly, taking our bread basket (which still had about 5 slices), my bread plate and knife, and everything else on the table.\n\nI sat in shock, because I still had my half-eaten buttered bread in my hand, hovering over my bread plate, which had just been snatched from under me.  What?!\n\nOur waiter then swooped in and dropped dessert menus on our table.  After having our little girly chat about the drama in our lives, we decided to both have dessert: the chocolate and butterscotch pot de creme and the chocolate brownie.  Both were absolutely delicious - I may come back here just for dessert.\n\nOverall, the price of this place just isn't worth it.  It's cute inside, but for a LOT of money, the service just wasn't up to par.  Thanks, but I'll take my money elsewhere, where I can probably get double the amount of food and more smiles.", "author": "Tori S."}

We had reservations and were seated promptly, after entering the brick building with red awnings.\n\nHere's what I got:\n-Soup of the day (potato leek soup): YUM. Smooth, rich, buttery and topped with olive oil and almonds.\n-Pulled Pork sandwich with french fries: Okay. The panini was nicely toasted and gave out a nice crunch when you bit down. The pulled pork was stringy and with a good amount of flavor.\n-Butterscotch & Creme Pot de creme: Rich. It was topped with 3 pieces of butter crunch and was super rich I took about 5 spoons and I was done. The color threw me off...the top layer was the same color of Thousand Island dressing and then there was chocolate underneath. I liked the chocolate better.\n\nThe food was okay, but the surroundings were awesome. I loved the feel of the place: rustic with lots of character. Loved the wooden tables and chairs. The light fixtures were unique and I LOVED how the bill came in an old hardback book. The place had a lot of charm and was filled with a lot of the business-type of folk.

Which is why this meal deserving of visual compliments drives me crazy.  Nonetheless, the meal was excellent for Lunch.  For $22, I got the following:\n\n-Asparagus Soup - Rich and creamy and simple to the eye.  It was full in flavor and lightly spiced.  It looked absolutely great just on a simple white bowl and plate.  Bread dipped makes it even greater.\n-Pig Shredded sandich with chips - chips were awesome....I can't look at kettle chips another way ever again.  The sandwich was humungus and I had to take leftovers.  The coleslaw in the sandwich made it even better.\n\nMy big sis had this which of course I had to HAD to try\n-Fish and Chips Garlic fries - excellent.  lightly breaded, it made up for my dissapointing failed attempt at fish and chips in SLO this past weekend.\n-Tuna Tartare on fried Veggie thing - the veggie things all new to me and it was perfect while taking bite sizes of it and spotting a few spoons of the tartare. \n\n-Butterscotch Mousse - dessert finished off with this very rich yet too thick for my taste dessert.  It had chocolate mousse on the bottom with a nice layer of butterscotch on the top.", "author": "Vincent K."}

I could only peer inside and see the people enjoying themselves, like I was in the movie \"Carnival of Souls.\" I even walked under the red awning and through the empty outdoor dining area without noticing the main doors and did a complete full circuit of the building muttering to myself before trying again and finally seeing the front door where I'd just been.

I liked the fried oysters a lot - very small oysters with lots of crispy batter on them, including a thick slice of bacon and some herbal and creamy sauce. Nice bites. \n\nWe split the ribs entree. They were very good but not spectacular. I think I'd prefer that same bbq sauce applied to a pork loin and sliced, to avoid all the work with the sauce/finger/licking. The macaroni and cheese croquettes can be skipped. Though very well prepared, the outer crust and the inner goo just didn't go well together, and the tomato sauce they're served with - salsa? - just doesn't have much flavor. That one is a thud. The asparagus were very tasty and very thick.\n\nThe only bad touch to the meal was that though they did bring wet towels for us, they were basically soaking wet cold napkins on a plate with a  couple of lemon wedges. They brought them when we weren't even close to finished, so by the time we picked them up they were ice cold and still very wet as opposed to warm and cozy like you'd want. Well they were very busy and were eager to please us so that is rather nitpicky. But this compounded the problem of getting very cold for the last 1/4 of the meal, probably because a door was  opened somewhere in the back of the house. \n\nFor dessert we had the butterscotch pot au creme. It was cool to eat with the layer of butterscotch with chocolate underneath, and the toffee was delicious. They bill it as their signature dessert and though it's fun, I don't think the flavor merits all the brouhaha over this dish. \n\nI was really looking forward to Town Hall. I had poured over the food porn pics on Yelp, and had high expectations. With regard to quality, my expectations were met, but in terms of having a completely unique restaurant experience, not so much. I'm glad I finally tried it. It's a very well executed restaurant and plainly has a lot of fans. That said I don't think I'll make it  a destination again unless several things are in confluence, in which case I'd  have no problem being there.\n\nWow, what a wishy-washy review!!", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

The place wasn't very crowded, but I stood at the front without anyone acknowledging me for a few noticeable minutes. Then one of the waiters (I think) who was folding napkins came up to me, I asked for a table for two, and he said he would go check for a table. Along the way, he tapped the hostess who was standing by the bar and told her about me.\n\nBut I was still standing there, still waiting. Finally the hostess left the bar and came up to me, saying \"How can I help you? Sorry it took so long, I was stuck chatting with so many people!\" Somehow I feel it should have been a higher priority to seat me than to continue chitchatting?\n\nMy friend joined me at the table a few minutes later, and still no one acknowledged us. I couldn't understand why, it wasn't busy at all and I was visibly ready to order. Our waiter finally came to take our orders and proceeded to tell us that they had ran out of the fried chicken. I think I gasped out loud. How does a restaurant run out of chicken?! With two hours before closing? He also told us that there were several other substitutions on the menu (probably because they had run out of things too).\n\nThe food was fine, but overall the service was exceedingly disappointing for the pricey-ness of the place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-02-24", "description": "The quality of service provided at a restaurant can either make or break the dining experience.  Unfortunately, the latter held true on a recent visit to Town Hall.  A few friends were visiting from out of town and we decided to eat at Town Hall since our first choice was closed on Sundays.  I had previously dined here before and had enjoyed that experience; expecting this visit to be similar.  I was dead wrong. \n\nSo what ticked me off?  It was a slow night and we were blatantly ignored by the waitstaff.  Like little school kids trying to avoid picking a particular person for a team, the servers seemed to be bickering amongst themselves to see who would get stuck with our table.  This was done right in front of us, oblivious to the fact that we could see everything.  We finally had to flag down the bartender to help find someone who could take our order.  \n\nWhile they tried to make up for it by bringing a free appetizer and a desert, the damage was already done.  I would have appreciated service levels befitting the caliber of restaurant they appear to be; rather than to be appeased by free food.  I can afford to eat out and always tip well for good service.  \n\nWhile the food at Town Hall is good, it's not spectacular or prepared in any truly innovative way.  They are known for preparing high quality staples of American fare -- and they do execute this very well.  But they better provide some decent service to go along with that, considering that a big portion of the menu is not unique.  What we experienced that night was totally unacceptable.  \n\nSadly, Town Hall will no longer be on my list of places to entertain.  They still have an awesome desert menu though, so extra star for their consistently amazing butterscotch pot de creme.  At least one thing there hasn't changed for the worse.", "author": "Wei K."}

However, the table was 15 minutes late.  As other reviews dictate that this seems to be a trend, I have to deduct points for it.\n\nFood was pretty good, but in this price range I've found far better.  I started w/ the ham n cheese, which - thank you yelpers - was fantastic.  I followed w/ the Ossobucco on the waitress's recommendation.  The sides were tasty, and the meat was good, but it was a little flat.  My wife started w/ the squash blossoms which were forgettable at best, then opted for the famed fried chicken.  It was good, as friend chicken usually is, but unsure if it was worthy of the high acclaim it has received below.

When the waiter brought it out I was thinking to myself \"what the hell is all this what gooey stuff?\"  But it turns out this gooey stuff is just like a symphony for the mouth is what it is.  The ham and cheese toast was really crispy and the poached egg dripping yellow was something my artery might complain about but my mouth and stomach was screaming YES!\n\nThe only reason I set foot in Town Hall is my good friend/foodie Michael R. told me the fried chicken here is delicious and this coming from a man who makes the best fried chicken ever, I had to go and try.  How the hell can Town Hall make their chicken so tender?  The crispy outside crunchy layer as you bite through into the flesh morsel of meat that is just so tender!  The chicken breast that I ate had no dryness to it.  Each bite was succulent and juicy.  Just perfect.   Paired with the mash potatoes, finger licking good gravy along with collard greens.  This is a dish you can't eat everyday but would love to.\n\nThe chocolate/Toffee creme depot is fantastic.  At first bite I thought it was way too sweet, but when my spoon reached all the way to the bottom then I realized the chocolate was slightly bitter which balanced the overly sweet layer on top  to make it a very interesting combination.  Just order this one dessert to share with someone because it's actually pretty huge.\n\n*Town Hall has some good picks and bad picks.  However, I have to say folks you gotta come just for the fried chicken.

I can't even remember what I had, but it was good, as I expected! We all liked our meals.  My memory of that was the ambiance/interior/decor really impressing me as well.  It kind of makes me feel like I'm in another place.\n\nAnother thing I like is that this restaurant has a few nooks/spaces that allow that allow varied experiences in different parts of the restaurants; it provides a degree of privacy as well.\n\nI overheard the bartender telling someone that they have two other restaurants, one being the Salt House, which I've passed before and have wondered about...I forget the name of their other restaurant, but she said it serves mostly seafood.  Exciting!  Anyway, when I have more money to splurge, I'll be back to all of those.", "author": "Liz C."}

Long story short, when I called to confirm the resos a couple of hours before dinner, the hostess said she had no record of one of them and she couldn't guarantee our seating. I had email confirmations for both of them, so I knew they were there, but the hostess persisted in disagreeing.  She wasn't exactly rude, but not exactly helpful either. So I was worried our big fun family dinner was going to be a disaster.\n\nFlash forward to two hours later when the loveliest maitre'd was awaiting our arrival. He had ironed out the whole mess and had reserved a big table where we could all sit together. The service was phenomenal--one waitress and two helpers working their asses off--and the collard greens were the best I've ever had.\n\nMy brother communicates with hand-gestures--he is disabled--and it takes patience to understand and engage with him if you've never met him before.

For starters, I was seated 20 minutes after my reservation time (boo). Then, once our table was seated, the service was only \"okay.\" But the real reason for the post is that I ordered a \"Town Hall Burger\" and, given they named the burger after the restaurant, I was expecting some pride of ownership. It was hands down the worst burger I've ever had. Why? The meat was terrible! I'm not joking when I say it may not have met FDA standards. It was incredibly chewy - yes, chewy - and when I sent it back to have it cooked a bit more, assuming the chewiness was due to it being undercooked, it came back JUST as chewy, only greyer. Yuck, yuck, yuck. I'm no hater, I have enjoyed Town Hall's patio and drinks in the past - but this was just so gross that I'm hoping this review will encourage the buyers to step up their ground chuck procurement.", "author": "Carrie S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-26", "description": "So, I was playing a light-hearted game of Word Association with a friend of mine. It had started off well and most answers were predictably benign. Things started to get a little uncomfortable when the mention of \"sex\" elicited the response, \"child.\" In a desperate attempt to put a halt to the psychoanalysis, we carried on: \n\n\"Air.\"\n\"Plane.\"\n\n\"Happy.\"\n\"Sad.\"\n\n\"Pudding.\"\n\"Bill Cosby.\" \n\n....\"What the hell? Bill Cosby? Come on! I say pudding and you shoot me back some guy in a sweater?\" \n\"Haley, what the hell is your problem? It was the first thing I thought of and so I just said it - \"\n\"Yeah. Ok. Fine. It's just that if you had TASTE, you would have said TOWN HALL. You would have said BUTTERSCOTCH POT DE CREME. WITH CHOCOLATE. But you didn't. You didn't say any of that....you said BILL COSBY!!!\" \n\nI went to Town Hall with my parents on a whim. For a Wednesday, it was surprisingly busy, but we found a seat right away. The host was considerate and let us know that the table was open due to its close proximity to the kitchen, but that was icing on the cake to my restaurant-industry father, who never ceases to bring on the chit-chat with everyone involved in the dining process, much to my embarrassment. \n\nFor instance, they bring us some bread. It's good bread, sure. I dip mine in olive oil and carry on with my conversation. My dad gets up from the table and heads over to the guy slicing the bread. My mother and I glance at each other, amused. If I were still going through puberty, I'm sure I would have turned beet-red and hid under the table, but as I get further past the braces-and-acne phase, I find these moments more endearing than mortifying. He comes back and sits down, pleased with his correct identification of the bread. The bread guy he assaulted swings over with another basket, and slaps a hand on my dad's shoulder, chuckling. This bread guy is my father's new best friend. \n\nSo, we get down to the Real Food. Butter lettuce salad, tuna tartare, fondue to start. Salad had slices of one of the crispest Fuji apples I've had in a while (I am a stickler for firm apples and have had horrible luck finding one the past few months). Tuna tartare was fresh and light, complete with fried green tomatoes, which I wanted to bury myself in, they were so delicious. Fondue was forgettable. \n\nAnd then, like a ton of bricks, they hit us. Both at the same time, both to share and fight over, both in the hands of a waitress who could not walk fast enough. \n\nFried chicken with corn, biscuits and gravy.\nSteak with white bean puree and a delectable, artery-clogging sauce. \n\nThe perfectly-breaded chicken was deceptively inviting; a knife through the center released a sinus-clearing cloud of steam, taunting my hungry stomach. The roof of my mouth was pissed, as I defied the thought to let it cool off, and inhaled the chicken. Unlike many, I've never been head-over-heels for fried chicken, but I can (did) definitely appreciate the combination of crispy outside, juicy inside. \n\nWell beyond full at this point, I ventured towards the steak. I rarely (HA. GET IT?) order a slab of meat for myself and so I didn't anticipate wanting much more than a few bites. One fork-to-mouth exchange and I was questioning why I would have ever made that assumption. Perfectly medium-rare, nice burst of mushroom and wine. I snuck the last bites before my father could slurp up the sauce. \n\nManufacturers make elastic waistbands for these occasions. We sat there in a communal food coma, waiting for someone to clear the empty plates that could have gone without a wash, they were so thoroughly cleaned. This is a good place to mention that service was sweet, but slow.  Part of why I had decided it suitable to eat anything presented to me (and more) was due to the fact that it took a LONG time to get it all out. Our waiter would zip by and apologize, but even my patient mother was getting a bit peeved. The only time this worked in our favor was after we had eaten the entire zoo, carousel, and gift shop. \n\nWith the passing time, we were able to digest and plan ourselves to further discomfort. My mother insisted we had to get the butterscotch pot de creme, based on her recent visit. \n\nI love my mother. \n\nThe majority of the food I mentioned above could be found elsewhere for a lesser price. However, the butterscotch pudding was worth every ache and pain my stomach growled out later that night. I considered getting my bag, silently unzipping it, tossing the bowl of rich butterscotch and chocolate into my bag, and RUNNING to the nearest alley so that I could be alone to lick every last drop. \n\nNot really my \"scene,\" I probably wouldn't go back just for a dinner. I would prefer to drop the dough in one of the many eclectic, smaller, just-as-delicious venues the city has to offer. \n\nThat said, if someone says \"pudding,\" you can rest assured my answer would be: \"TOWN HALL!\"", "author": "haley d."}

The menu is unique and well presented. For an appetizer, I had the tuna tartare that comes with lightly fried green tomatos. I would never normally eat these, but being I had no idea what they were until after I tasted them, I went for it. SO DELICIOUS! The wine list was great, we got a couple bottles :) To be honest, I can't remember the type of fish I had for the main course, but I do remember it was cooked perfectly.

I kept driving by this place on the way home and always thought it looked really warm and inviting.  We came without a reservation and they found us a table right away.  Not that they had no business, but the place is pretty big.\n\nThe interior IS warm and nicely lit.  There's just enough lighting too what you're eating, and give people a nice candle-lit glow.\n\nThe space is flanked by two brick walls in a long and narrow space.  \n\nThe bread was great.  Though not heated (I like warm bread), it's still moist with a slight chewy bite to it and crunchy on the outside ... just the way I like 'em.  Aside from the texture, it also has nice flavor.  My dining companion and I polished off two baskets of 'em.\n\nWe each had a salad (butter lettece with candied walnuts, apples and blue cheese; beet salad with fried goat cheese).  They both came out looking amazing.  The butter lettece was dressed and stacked pretty high with the walnuts and apple \"sticks\" on top.  While it looks great and all, it's hard to mix them together with this big stack of ingredients.  Flavor-wise, it's quite good, it's unfortunate that the apples weren't really sweet enough to complement the punginess of the blue cheese.  The beet salad was also pretty good.  The beets were a bit \"muddy tasting\" but that's probably more of a seasonal thing.  The piece of goat cheese, however was quite delightful.  It was covered with panko and deep fried.  When you bite into it, you get some gooey melted goat cheese with a bit of crunchy panko.  All in a nice warm bite.\n\nWe had the bacon wrapped trout and day boat scallops for our entrees.  The trout was an interesting choice as its flesh is usually pretty sweet and delicate.  While I love anything with bacon, I found that its smokiness was too heavy-handed and overpowered the trout.  The day boat scallops came on some chantrell mushrooms, brussel sprouts and over a puree of sweet potatoes.  The flavor of the mushrooms was almost non-existent, the brussel sprouts were great, the sweet potato puree was really rich.  One of the scallops was a bit over cooked (just a bit, but still ok ... it's more of a looks thing).  I found it unusual that they had only seared one side of them, not both top and bottom.  Perhaps they don't have a burner with enough btu???\n\nWe skipped dessert.\n\nOverall, it's a nice meal and one that I enjoyed.

We're always up for trying new restaurants in the area.  We had recently been to Foreign Cinema and had pretty good expectations about this place.\n\nPretty average in my opinion.  There were some great things about the meal, and there were some pretty bad things about the meal, and mixing the two together gives an average meal.\n\nFirst, the service was pretty mediocre.  We were all starving, and bread took its sweet time getting to our table.  We had to ask several times for refills on the bread.  \n\nThe wine was good.  The starters were pretty damn amazing.  I had the scallops which were pretty delectable, and my boyfriend had the BBQ shrimp.  Honestly, it was probably the best starter on the table.  The scallops were a close second, but the sauce the shrimp were served in was divine!  Someone also had the seafood chowder, which was pretty good as cream chowders go (I'm pretty damn picky about them honestly, no one uses pepper these days!), and someone else had the ham and cheese sandwich which looked great, and he said was simple and had a nice flavor profile.\n\nNow for the main courses.  These were a huge disappointment.  I had steak.  It was perfectly cooked, and probably the best main that we had, but it was lacking something.  I mean the steak at Catch (a SEAFOOD restaurant) is far superior to this steak.  Two people ordered the fried chicken.  Honestly, I've had better.  My aunt made better fried chicken.  It just was lacking something it needed, but I'm not sure what.  My boyfriend ordered the ribs.  Don't get them.  They overcook them, they are tough, and ridiculously tough to get off the bone.  It was pretty disappointing.\n\nFor dessert we had two orders of the pot de creme, and I got the apple galette.  The tart was pretty boring.  Also the crust was super soggy and a bit burnt, which I think is only possible by cooking in advance and reheating them.  The only good thing about mine was the blue cheese ice cream.  I've never had it before, and it was pretty damn tasty.  I'm gonna have to try it on my own sometime.  The pot de cremes were ok.

I planned on getting her a gift and a nice night out to a place we haven't been before. We had to go to  Cirque de Soleil after dinner so we wanted to keep it close to the hood. In proud fashion that any man would be proud of, I waited to the last minute to make a reservation. I got an early reservation so my procrastination did not cost me my relationship:)\n\nWhen you walk  inside, it was very \"boys club\" feel. There are a bunch of guys and a few women in business suits sitting in the lounge/host area having a drink after work. It was funny, this was the night that I told my girl to dress down as we tend to overdress when we go to restaurants. We did fine...we decided last minute not to wear our tracksuits.\n\nWe made our way through the small crowd  and realized that we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. The hardwood floor, brick, and dark and light contrasts on the wall gave it and the semi rustic feel. I felt like I was in a New England restaurant that has been around for years. All it needed was a weimaraner lying on an animal skin rug. The dog and rug of course are in front of the fireplace with a gun hunting rifle on it.  \n\nNo fox hunts or LL Bean here. We had Apollo: the super waiter. He was really warm and once the section filled up, handled it like a pro. He was attentive, funny and multi-tasked well (I was a waiter and appreciate the hustle). The menu is definitely New American but with a new-found twist on the classics. I love rich food. It makes me think of a grandmother cooking food to taste good; not an uptight LA cook appeasing moviestars with egg whites. By recommendation, we had a few starters and shared an main. It was more than enough. We had the tuna tar-tare, veal meatballs, and the butter lettuce salad. For a main we spit the Ribeye and fries. The whole portion must be for that dude on the front of Brawny papertowels. It was perfect for two. Desert was great....but of course everything looks great with a candle sticking out of it.  \n\nI would go back here in a minute. Just to have a side with few drinks.

I ordered the Town Hall Burger, which is served on foccacia instead of a bun with some really good crispy fries. The foccacia was really good and went well with the meat, but if you're going to \"reinvent\" the burger by serving it on square bread, why not a square patty? Yeah, it sounds like Wendy's, but at least you wouldn't have four meatless bites of burger. \n\nI also had a bit of Sooj's fish (she ordered fish and chips) and it was really good...a nicely battered and fried piece of fish paired with malt vinegar always hits the spot.\n\nNow we didn't have time to eat dessert because my car was parked at a woefully underfunded parking meter, so we got our sticky toffee puddings packed to go (and I wanted to bring it home for my wife anyway).

I ordered the pan seared scallops and they were perfectly cooked and paired with butternut squash puree. I highly recommend this dish. We also wanted to try something different so we opted for a side of the smoked andouille jambalaya.

I was on a long streak of caipirinhas so I ordered one when our waitress came by to take our order. It came quickly and I drank it down fast -- too fast. I noticed that when I'd finished the drink there was still ice brimming over the top of the glass. When our waitress came back again, I requested another caipirinha. I asked for a larger one or just less ice and I mentioned that I wouldn't mind paying more for it. \n\nA few minutes later the bartender came over to talk to me. \"Is there a problem?\" she asked. \"No,\" I said, \"I'd just like a bit more drink in the next one.\" She proceeded to list off the ingredients in a caiprinha -- cacha\u00e7a, lime juice and sugar -- as if I didn't know what's in a drink that I frequently order. \"I know,\" I replied, \"I'd just like more of those ingredients.\" Then, seemingly, there was a breakthrough. \"I could put less ice in the next one?\" she asked helpfully. I smiled in approval thinking I'd finally got the message across. What happened next was simply ludicrous. When my next drink arrived the cocktail glass was half full of liquid with a small amount of partially melted ice in it. I actually laughed at the absurdity of it. The rest of my group was amused as well. It was borderline unbelievable that they could present that drink to me straight-faced.\n\nLet me pose a question. For a restaurant that charges $12 for toast and $20 for fried chicken, would it really be an enormous travesty for my cocktail to contain more than exactly one ounce of liquor? We had about fifteen people in our group and probably spent $700 or $800 there (I don't know the exact bill since one member of our party graciously picked up the entire tab). Shouldn't I get a drink made however I want for those prices? If I were the owner of Town Hall it would certainly be worth it to me to spare a few cents worth of rum rather than serve a ridiculous insult to my patrons.\n\nIn short, the cheese toast was good but I won't be rushing back to spend $12 on it. The fried chicken was good but nothing special -- any professional chef should be able to make decent fried chicken. The incompetent bartending, however, means I'll be avoiding Town Hall like the plague.", "author": "Aaron V."}

The entrees look small on the very large plates, but they are certainly filling.\n\nSo, what did I have: the tri tip in a soy marinade and thin slices of maybe turnip.  The tri tip was good, but nothing to swoon over.\n\nOne of my friends had the pork tenderloin which turned out to be a structure with potato fingerlings at the bottom, pork tenderloin, chard, mushrooms, and pork slivers on top.  Really lovely sauce drizzled over the whole thing.\n\nMy other friend had the Atlantic char.  But what was amazing about her entree was the grits with spring garlic.  Just the creamiest grits ever...and I've made grits before with a whole cupful of heavy cream in it, but this beat out any grits I've tasted.  I don't want to know how much heavy cream and butter they put into it.  I could easily eat a large bowl of those grits and be content...well okay, maybe the grits and some of those lovely slivers of pork.  If only they would serve that as an entree.\n\nDesserts: we got the chocolate chiffon cake and sticky toffee cake to share.  The chocolate chiffon cake slice was large, but nothing to extol.  Get the sticky toffee cake.  It's like having a cake drenched in hot melted toffee.  \n\nGod help me, I am going back next week for another friend's birthday....soon, I will need a giant shoe horn to fit me into my clothes.\n_____\n\nUpdate: I went back for lunch with Arnold G. and ordered their fish and chips.  I have to say that the fish was quite tasty, but I think it's the most I've paid for fish and chips (which I tend to think of as solid Irish bar food).  Another weird thing: if you get reserve a regular table, it's louder than the communal table (where I was seated for my meal above).  Town Hall really needs to reconsider its interior design in terms of acoustics.  \n\nBut let me state again: that Sticky Toffee Pudding is culinary genius!  Get it.  You want it.  You must have it.\n______\nUpate again:\nTheir prime rib comes on a really nice puree of white beans.  However, if you like medium rare, order rare.  I am not sure when all the categories of steak doneness has changed...it seems no restaurant does rare anymore.  I ordered rare, and it was really medium rare.\n\nMississippi Mud Pie: Fantastic when you are craving chocolate that is even more intense in richness than chocolate.

This review was almost a 2 star, but I am glad to report it as a four-star with a major story involved!  My wife and I met my brother and his wife for a long overdue dinner on Saturday.  We arrived a bit early for our 7:30 reservation and got a nice 4-top table in the middle of the ground floor.  I ordered a bottle of Bordeaux for us (more on that later). \n\nBased on Yelp reviews, for appetizers we got two orders of the shrimp.  My advice - skip the shrimp and just eat the artery-clogging bread that is soaked in the sauce UNDERNEATH the shrimp - wow is it FANTASTIC!!   \n\nThree of us had a glass of the Bordeaux poured so we could drink it with our appetizers.  Our waitress, seeing a crowded table told us, \"I am going to put this bottle of wine on the window ledge over here so you have room.\"  One of us joked back, \"make sure nothing happens to it!\"  Her reply was, \"I will keep my eye on it!\"\n\nSo, of course, about 10 minutes later, an employee managed to knock over our bottle of wine.  AHHHHH!  Even worse, he knocked it over the back of a woman wearing a white outfit...  Double-AHHHHHH!  Even worse, when our waitress came running over, we told her \"our bottle was spilled\", and she replied, \"Oh no, it was not your wine, it was wine from her glass.\"\n\nStunned into silence, at this point, our dining experience was toast (and no, not that YUMMY toast with the shrimp...).  My brother and I both began deep breathing exercises and assumed our waitress would realize her mistake, but no, we ended up only getting a glass each out of the bottle.\n\nBack to the food:  the entrees came, and they were excellent.  The bone-in pork chop was an incredible meat-eater feast with wonderful flavors from the grits and some green stuff that may have been a vegetable.  Fantastic.\n\nBack to the wine:  after the entrees, not seeing any change, my brother (go Dan!) attracted the attention of the manager and told him what had happened.  He was nearly as stunned as we were by the service flubbing.  He offered us another bottle of wine, but we refused since we were done (except for dessert).  He profusely apologized and sent our waitress over to apologize as well.\n\nWe accepted their apology, and ordered the dessert.  Faithfully sticking to Yelp standards, I got the butterscotch pudding (whatever they call it).  It was great.  The chocolate cake across the table was not as good.  Stick with the butterscotch.\n\nThe save:  the manager came over again after dessert, apologized again, and comped us on the wine and desserts.  He really was horrified, and did a great job of convincing us that Town Hall does not usually operate that way.    His sincerity was obvious, and his handling of the check was the right thing to do.  In short, he took a near-disaster of a griping, negative experience and turned it into a very good dinner.  We will be back.

Either way, the noise level is no more than should be expected at a normal, popular restaurant.  \n\nMost importantly, the food was fantastic.  Kasey ordered the slow roasted duck, and having a bite or three or four of her entree, I can avow that this dish is a culinary juggernaut - sweet, savory and tender.  \n\nBecause I was in the mood for something light, I ordered the sea scallops.  I was a little concerned that the sea scallops (a delicate, light food stuff) were being served on top of an andouille jambalaya.  In my mind, that pairing seems something less than obvious.  I'd normally expect the spicy jambalaya to overpower the taste of the sea scallops.

Not overly noisy, but with plenty of \"buzz\" in the air. \n\nOur waiter was a very nice young man, friendly and attentive, but not so we thought he was going to ask us to come over to his house or become best buddies.  \n\nWe started with some reasonably priced cocktails ($7.00 for a Beefeater Martini and $8.00 for a Stolichnya Martini) both well made and brought promptly.  We opened our dinner with their Stuffed Peppers ($15.00) delish, and a Grilled Lamb Carpaccio ($15.00) a nice twist on the good old Beef Carpaccio.  For our entree my hubby had the Etoufee ($29.00) a nice assortment of fish, but I thought there could have been more; I had their FAMOUS Fried Chicken ($23.00) a delicious half chicken that was fried to perfection.  Along with this they served a mashed potatoes (I love mashed potatoes) and \"bacon gravy\" misstep.  If I was to have this dish again, I would ask for the gravy on the side.  First of all, it tasted to me like Cambell's Bean with Bacon soup, and that on mashed potatoes does not sound like good eats.  And it over-powered the potatoes, all I could taste was the gravy.  So order it \"on the side\".  The Panna Cotta ($9.00) was, Panna Cotta.  I mean it is what it is.  \n\nLindySez: I'd go back.  And the fact that they waived our corkage on the wine we brought in gives them an extra \"yeah\" from me.", "author": "Lindy B."}

Even after we flagged down our host (who left to go look for the waitress) it was a good 5 minutes until she appeared without so much as a care in the world.\n\nTip TH- most people who lunch during the weekday are workers and have a strict 1 hour time limit... please don't leave your patrons twiddling their thumbs wondering where the check is. Or if delays happen (I understand it gets busy sometimes but it was 1:45 and the crowd had basically left) just apologize to recognize the inconvenience it caused. I'm not asking for a free appetizer, discount, etc... just a quick explanation. That's all.\n\nAnd now that's it's the end of the day I realize I was too nice... I tipped her my customary 20% and in retrospect I really should have tipped lower.\n\n***UPDATE TO MY UPDATE***\nok, I've been back 3 more times since the last and have not experienced any of the previous delays... I think the key is making sure you get a reserved table and don't sit in the Communal Table, or if you do be prepared for a long-ggg wait... anyway, they changed their menu (again, yum!) and we had the fish tacos (no that was the last time).... eggplant sandwich, crab louie salad (um, that looked delicious but a little small, thank god I don't rely on foul weeds for my nourishment), and of course the tuna w/ fried green tomatoes.\n\nCan't wait to check out the newest sister restaurant! :)", "author": "Nenette Y."}

This place fails to disappoint, unless you are a vegetarian.

Town Hall is usually lively, which makes having a drink before dinner a pleasure. The hostess who seated us was very polite and promptly sought out my friend and me when our table was ready. Decent beer selection on tap and nice bartenders, too.\n\nNow to the food. As an appetizer, I had the crab cake, which was seasoned just so and was light and delicious.

We weren't even offered water or drinks. When he finally did appear, he brought the cocktail list (oh, so they do have one! why wasn't it left with the menus?) that listed some pretty bizarre combinations, including a gin-based drink called The Big Easy -- um, gin? New Orleans? -- and a margarita-like tequila concotion made with cointreau, lime juice, and Falernum. They all sounded so poorly conceived that we stuck with wines by the glass.\r\n\r\nMy starter was Smithfield ham and cheese toast with jalapeno cream.... which really tasted like something you'd get at TGI Friday's. It was positively sodden with pepper-infused bechamel (interesting but about 10 times the amount needed) and sprinkled with cold, flabby rings of jalapenos that had been breaded in the style of fried green tomatoes. My husband's appetizer, billed as \"barbeque shrimp\" was also served on toast, also with a drenching of sauce. He definitely got the worse end of the deal: his pool of brown sauce tasted of nothing except salt and worcestershire. Ew.\r\n\r\nMy main was a peanut-and-tasso-crusted Niman Ranch pork chop. The chop itself was brined to within an inch of its life... it was overcooked but still eerily moist.... spongy, salty, blech. The elements of the crust were so large that they fell off as soon as I cut into the chop. The accompanying mashed potatoes were good, but such a small serving that I literally had to lift up the pork chop to see if they'd been forgotten.\r\n\r\nMy husband had a a trio of rabbit: hilariously tiny frenched rack of ribs, roulade of breast with unidentifiable stuffing, and another roulade of leg wrapped in bacon. What was billed as mustard spaetzle were scattered across the top as garnish. The vegetable was lightly-mashed peas and a celeriac puree. All of the meat was completely unsalted and basically tasteless, and the breast roulade was utterly overcooked and dry. Needless to say, neither of us ate much of our mains aside from the vegetables.\r\n\r\nSince we were still hungry at this point, we split a butterscotch-chocolate pot de creme, garnished with buttercrunch. Sadly, this was the highlight of our meal, and it wasn't even good. The \"pot\" was actually a two-layered cereal-size bowl of pudding (nothing creme-y about it) and the top layer tasted exactly like butterscotch pudding from a box.\r\n\r\nService never improved from the early missteps: Plates were dropped off uncerimoniously -- it might have been nice to have an explanation of what the trio of rabbit included, for example -- and we got the distinct impression that our server would have rather been somewhere else for the evening. At least we had that in common.\r\n\r\nThe high-ceilinged space is decorated in an eclectic vein that feels historic without degenerating into old-timey kitsch. The light fixtures in particular -- including a Rube Goldberg-esque chandelier over the bar -- are particularly striking. The entry area was jammed with people waiting for tables and having drinks at the ill-placed bar, but the restaurant tables were only a little bit crowded. On the downside, the lack of booths and window coverings combined with brick walls makes for a very loud space with unforgiving acoustics -- there's no prayer of ignoring the coversations of the people on either side of you. Still, it managed to feel warm and urban and inviting... I only wish the food had been the equal of the space.", "author": "anita c."}

Our party of three was seated at 9pm and we started our evening with cocktails and soup, so far so good.  Then the waitress, manager and chef seem to forget all about what it takes to deliver a nice meal.  \n\nWe order a $100 bottle of Latour to pair with our fish dinner. Then 40mins later our dinners came out to which we where almost finished with the wine.  If that wasn't bad enough the waitress brought the wrong food.  \n\nThe second assault was the bacon wrapped trout; it was like a hockey puck sliding off the dish when it was placed in front of me for the first time.  After having to send back the wrong meal, the manager took the other two dinners to the kitchen to be held. Unfortunately NOT under a heat lamp, so when I got my LAME trout back it was cold!  \n\nI finished eating the four string beans on the side of the plate, went home and put some food in the microwave and had dinner at 11pm.", "author": "Noelle M."}

The food was good, but really lacked the \"wow factor.\" I felt like everything I tried had an interesting concept but was just out a little of the chefs' reach. \n\nWe started out with the crab fondue, which itself had a really delicious flavor, but the accompanying things you were meant to dip in the fondue seemed like really odd choices - broccolini and sausage. We shared the peanut-crusted lamb, which was a little on the boring side and the ahi, which my dining companion said was overcooked. \n\nThe space itself is nice - feels like a cross between a maritime museum and a prairie house - but the acoustics make it extremely difficult to hear.\n\nI think for the price point there are far better dining options in the city.", "author": "Lindsey S."}

But we still walked out feeling like we had a great time, and that's what's important.  Town Hall is just one of those restaurants that's fun to go to, serves fun food, and generally encourages a good time.\n\nSo it's predictably loud and crowded.  But not in a bad way: think convivial, energetic, with an appealing hodgepodge of patrons: amusingly over-botoxed socialites, youngish preppy couples, the requisite blue blazer-wearers, a family or two thrown into the mix - and everyone feeling at home.\n\nSure, the crowds mean our table was not ready quite on time.  All the better to order a fantastic cocktail.\n\nAnd yes, our waitress was a complete dolt.  But you could tell just by looking at her that, er, the light was on, but... so we lowered our expectations, resigned to the fact that we'd have to request bread and butter (I feel like such a chubster when I do that --- I mean, do I really neeeeeeeed crusty bread slathered with butter as a prelude to an enormous dinner?    Oh, the shame!), and got over it.\n\nAnd moved on to the food: New American with a Southern twist.  How can that not be good?  \n\nSadly, it's possible.  Potato and bacon croquettes sounded right up my alley (fried!  bacon!) - but were strangely bereft of both bacon and flavor.  Best thing about these gussied-up tater tots was the sinus-clearingly spicy mustard dipping sauce.   Veal meatballs over mashed potatoes (yes, this was an app - see why I like this place?) were great - well, the ones that weren't overdone.\n\nBut the mains: solid.  Peanut-crusted pork chop over grits (how much do I love grits?!) with sweet potatoes and bitter greens: excellent, with perfectly balanced flavors.  BF, not a fan of the sweet/savory marriage, wasn't as thrilled, so I happily traded him my pancetta-crusted trout over scallion risotto: again, well-seasoned, rich but not overly so: equally excellent.  \n\nI was afraid for one of our dinner companions for whom, being allergic to everything under the sun (dairy, nuts, eggs, shellfish, you name it), menus are minefields - one wrong turn into a whisper of peanut oil and it's instant death; but the kitchen readily accommodated and he pronounced his duck and wild rice entree tasty.  I love when people are happy with their food.\n\nI do wish I were happier with dessert, because desserts tend to be strong here.  Am I kicking myself for not playing it safe and going for the sticky toffee cake, which I know I love?  Yes.  Did I think the gingersnap crust overpowered the otherwise fluffy and yummy cheesecake that I did order?  Yes.  But did I also enjoy scooping huge spoonfuls of my friend's always-delicious butterscotch pudding (the enormous serving means I can be greedy without her getting annoyed - always a plus)?  Another yes.    \n\nAll in all, I like. The room is fun, the drinks are solid, and the food is indulgent.  Good times.", "author": "Melissa B."}

This may be the place to go for drinks and to hang out with friends, but as far as a dining destination it was a flop.\n\nIt is definitely an interesting space, they converted the old Marine Electric warehouse into a corner restaurant with big picture windows to view the hustle and bustle of Howard and Fremont streets.  Inside there are brick walls, wood ceiling and lots of hard surfaces to help create a noisy yet festive atmosphere.   Thats about all I liked about Town Hall.  The rest of the evening was disappointing.\n\nWe were sat and looked over the menu.  As I had never been here before I asked the waiter for recommendations.  He suggested their signature warm ham and cheese toast with poached egg and jalapeno cream as a starter.  Which I had heard good things about.  I also had the Tasso-crusted pork chop which was another recommendation.\n\nThe ham and cheese toast was way overhyped.  It was interesting for about one bite.  The presenation was a mess and it was way too heavy and just tasted like messy diner food.  It didn't translate well as an appetizer at dinner.  I found I was forcing myself to finish it, the dish was just too heavy handed in flavor. \n\nI was also disappointed in the pork chop.  I usually order the pork dish as way of comparing numerous restaurants.  As you can tell from my other reviews I get it just about everywhere.  This one just didn't excite me.  The pork was cooked well but it lacked any interesting flavors.  It was placed a top a medley of vegetables that resembled the cubed carrots and peas you get with a frozen dinner.  Overall, for $22 it was nothing special at all.\n\nThe desert was the lone bright spot.  The butterscotch pudding was very good but not enough to save the meal nor enough to get me to come back.\n\nI was also disappointed in our waiter.  After he took the order we didn't see him until our food arrived and it took a very long time to get the food.  It appeared as though they were short staffed or his section was just too big.  When the food did finally arrive it was just dropped off and he was gone again.  He didn't check back to see how we were doing, or to see if we needed anything.\n\nOverall, I found the food to be very heavy and fatty tasting.  The flavors are heavy handed and not very interesting.  With the one bright spot being dessert.  The waitstaff seemed overworked and frantic.  I haven't gone back there are just too many other places to choose from.\n\nAtmosphere:  3 stars\nFood:  2 stars\nService:  2 stars", "author": "Geoff H."}

Don't get me wrong, because you can't go wrong when you're serving mac 'n cheese and fried chicken, but I was left uninspired and felt that the overall experience lacked....dimension. \n\nThe food is salty, greasy, warm, and wonderfully buttery - but all those things aren't necessarily slam dunks in the culinary world. For starters, the ham, cheese, and egg toast with that jalepeno cream was hands-down amazing, but the crab-stout fondue was mediocre, at best; just had a funky taste to it that didn't sit right. Plus, it felt like they made it for the sake of having another rich app - too much. \n\nFor main courses, the sole was pretty good with lots of spice, but here is a good example of why I said this place lacks dimension. There were no distinct flavors that popped out at me - it was good, but I wasn't on a taste ride - and I like taking taste rides that take you in, out, up, down, and all around. I got that same bay seasoning in every bite, so it was just a slight texture change from the potatoes, romesco sauce, and sole. We also had the fried chicken, which was certainly tasty, but  lacked some crispness and was a little on the greasy side. The pork osso bucco was fine, but not as tender as other reviews.\nThe butterscotch pot de cream was delicious, but left me puzzled. There was something about it that was really well-done - but there was also something about it that reminded me of a Jello pudding snack...kind of odd. \n\nThe real downer for our experience was the ambiance. We were seated smack dab in the middle, next to the kitchen. The restaurant has a horrible set-up, so we heard more from the kitchen expo than we did each other. It was loud, and because the servers have to run all the way around to the front to get plates out, there was just a chaotic feel to it. You can tell they know this, as there were a plethora of extra wait staff and bussers around to help where they could, but having those extra people also cause the place to feel like cramped, crowded, and more like a cafeteria than a southern dining experience...and I don't want to pay that much for fried chicken if I'm at a cafeteria.", "author": "Erin M."}

We get there and are seating shortly after arriving. We wait and we wait and we wait till our waiter finally shows up... we order a few bottles of wine and then we wait and we wait and we wait some more. We were probably seated a solid 45 minutes before we even got our first drinks. Finally when we get back we went ahead and ordered all of our food because we werent sure we would ever see the waiter again. After finishing both bottles of wine and our apps - no waiter in sight - my fiance ordered a glass of wine from a staff member walking by and they promptly brought him the glass. As he was about to take a sip our waiter comes out of no where and snatched the glass from his hand and runs off. I have never seen anything like it. So we call over some other staff member walking by and ask what was going on and if he could get his glass of wine - they walk away and 10 min later our waiter walks back up and hands him the glass and he said he misunderstood and thought that it was for another table. I am not sure what is the misunderstanding or why you would think to snatch a glass of wine out of a customers hand?? The food finally came and we were all in a terrible mood by then bc the service was so poor hardly anyone ate their meals. We eventually had to get another random staff member to get our bill because our waiter again was no where in sight possibly because he was so embarrassed about his actions before. \n\nAll in all the service was very poor - which is super disappointing because we love their sister restaurants Anchor and Hope and Salt House AND go to those all the time. It is sad how poor service really affects your over all meal - if we had had someone who even cared about being there, serving us and doing their job we might have gone back.", "author": "Kate M."}

We got stuck at the bar since we had no reservation, but I guess it's one step up from the community table in the front of the restaurant.  The stools were pretty squished together that I think I annoyed the guy next to me when I kept bumping him.  Oops.\n\nMy coworker and I both ordered th etouffle with rice in the middle.  The shrimp was tasty, but the whole dish was on the borderline of being too salty.  Ok I guess that meant it was just too salty.  I also had a sprite and we got the bread, plus their homemade chips.  The chips were good so we gave some to our server behind the bar.  He was nice enough to refill my glass of sprite.  When I tasted it after my refill, I was wondering why it tasted so nasty and flat.  Oh duh.  It was water.  \"Excuse me sir,\" my coworker says to him, \"her water is flat.\"  \n\"That's because it's water,\" he replies.  Well... ok that was kind of funny.  But he switched it out with the sprite.  My coworker insisted we get the Sprite because it was an expensive restaurant that we had to get our money's worth.\n\nAfter a long wait, we got dessert, a sorbet and bread pudding.

But I guess if you're ranking it against the rest of Bauer's Top 100, maybe they're not flawless. But we went last night and it was the most satisfying restaurant experience I've ever had. \n\nAbout me: ex-chef, would much rather have a delicious, filling meal than a 2-ounce crazy chemistry experiement for $40. I'm pretty forgiving of waitstaff, take cocktails pretty seriously, but above all else I don't let small stuff get in the way of having a good time. I'm Anthony Bourdain but I don't like to travel.\n\nSo me and my lady were on our two-year anniversary. We got there about 45 minutes before our reservation hoping they had a bar, and they did. I had a Kentucky Gun and 710 Ashbury (both whiskey-based) and she had a Black Beauty and a Pim's something or other. All 4 were house cocktails, and well made, with an interesting balance of flavors, maybe not enough booze but then, I love a way-too-strong drink. On the list, the Kentucky Gun initially turned me off with the Tabasco, but there was a nice fruit-to-spicy transition in the drink. She liked both of hers, I think the best of the four was the Pim's whatever it was called. \n\nWe were sat on time at a small 2-person table (I'd left a note via OpenTable that we'd prefer not to get a communal table, since it was an anniversary, and it looks like they took care of us). Our server was friendly, informed, happy to give us more time even though we were seated around 9:30, and kept a smile all night. He had about the perfect balance of attention without being up our butts. I think his name was Javier -- Town Hall, if you're reading this, he was the best server I've ever had.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Cab, not one of their higher priced ones (I think it was $55) and I think it was probably obvious we weren't wine experts -- we might as well have thrown a dart at the list -- but it was a pretty good bottle. Server even beat me once to refilling her glass (it's a sin around here for me not to fill her glass).\n\nLike I said, I prefer to be satisfied than to be surprised, so I went with the Buttermilk Biscuits and ham starter. She had the Tuna Tartare. The biscuits were, without exaggeration, one of the favorite things I've ever eaten. The baked-to-order biscuits were deep-South-perfect, the Johnston ham was sliced incredibly thin and there was plenty of it, and the spicy, peppery jelly was an amazing complement. Slather some butter on a bite of biscuit, put some ham on there, and top it with the jelly, and I'm not kidding I may have never had more fun putting food in my mouth. She's a seafood freak, and was very impressed with the tuna. It was a bit spicier than she'd like, but she's incredibly sensitive to spicy, so that's not Town Hall's fault. It came with fired green tomatoes ( I think in a cornmeal crust or something) and they were spectacular. Both appetizers were rad.\n\nEntrees came out just in time. I was kinda surprised at the relatively basic plating of the entrees, but I have no problem with that. I feel like if you make the visuals too important you're not paying attention to the food enough. So \"basic\" is often, to me, a good sign. And I was right. Shit was on point. She got the Sole, I tried it and it was really damn good, especially the Concord grape reduction, but my New York steak was king of the night. I thought the meat itself had a bit of extra fat or silverskin in there, but that's what you get when you get it bloody. It was crispy on the outside, nice and red inside, and whatever the hell that sauce was, it was great. We were drinking, and I missed that detail. Mine even came with mushrooms, and I hate freaking mushrooms...but this time I cleaned my plate. Finally, this order was accompanied with a little iron pot of potatoes au gratin, and they were the kind you wish you'd grown up on. Share some fork space with the steak and the potatoes and that's what food should be, every meal. \n\nWe ordered the Butterscotch Pot de Creme, I got up to pee, and as I sat back down she says some other server guy had approached our table with a small plate, but turned away...she didn't know what was up...then here comes server #2 with a plate of three tiny cupcakes, \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate. It was an awesome thing to do (I guess they did see the OpenTable note!) and each cupcake was better than the last. We ate them in the order we thought we'd like them most: first a chocolate thing, then some cocnut German corporately thing, then something with nuts on top, and tuned out we liked them in reverse order of what we thought. Just as we finished, here came the Butterscotch pot, and it was incredible. Hard to describe, some kind of mix of butterscotch and chocolate creamy puddings with some crispy buttersctoch/toffee things floating on top. It was as ridiculous. We were both stuffed, but still I scraped the bowl clean. \n\nI'm out of characters, so, in short: perfect night. Thanks Town Ha", "author": "That Was A Good Drum Break .."}

We went here about a month ago for dinner when I was up in San Francisco for a conference. The place had good reviews on Yelp and we hadn't had any Southern-inspired cuisine in a long time.\n\nThe old brick loft building makes for a great environment. The restaurant is big, but still has an intimate feel to it. We arrived a little early and had a drink at the bar while we waited for a table. Town Hall serves up some excellent classic cocktails - most of which I wish I could take home with me to South Bay. That they'll make a Sazerac earns them bonus points in my book.The bartenders seem to really know what they're doing.\n\nAll of the appetizers sounded great. We had the buttermilk biscuits with ham and peach jam - heavenly stuff. Probably the highlight of the meal.\n\nThe fried chicken entree was also fantastic, just like they make it in the South! Having spent a couple of years in the South, it's hard to find fried chicken that takes me back to those long humid summers, but this did. Crisp but moist and tender on the inside. Just perfect. Too bad it wasn't what I ordered. \n\nThe pork chop started out on the right foot (or hoof, I suppose?). The peanut crust added a nice texture, and the side of rice and fava beans complimented it. About halfway in to it, in the dim light of the restaurant, I could see that my pork chop wasn't quite dead - in fact, it was really pink near the bone. I quietly brought this to the attention of the waiter who said he would chastise the kitchen and comped our dessert, but didn't comp the half-eaten entree. I was a few drinks in and on an expense account so I didn't bother to argue. Mistakes happen to be sure, but really, if you're going to send out a plate of trichinosis, at least comp the entree.\n\nThe service was generally good but a bit inconsistent. The staff was attentive when we were first seated, but it became increasingly hard to get anyone's attention as the night wore on. It was a Sunday night, so they weren't even especially busy.\n\nThere's a thousand restaurants in San Francisco I want to try, so while I can say that *most* of the food was great at Town Hall, and the drinks were outstanding - I'd even send a friend there (just remind them to cook the pork a little more, maybe) - but I'll have to get through the other thousand restaurants before I go back.", "author": "David F."}

If you're not put off by that, you're in for a treat because it's one of the finer eateries in the Financial district.\n\nTheir menu changes (I'm not sure how often) and comes on a sheet of thick paper.  Lamb, pork, chicken and rabbit(!) are served, along with seafood selections.  This is not a good place for vegetarians.  The portions are 80's movie rich-person-restaurant small, with a lot of plate to keep you company, but it's almost always effin' delicious and surprisingly filing.\n\nEat the bread they start you with - it's quality stuff.\n\nMy recommendation is the hamburger.

First, the prices - $24.50 for a pork chop? Second, not a lot of choices for vegetarians. And by \"not a lot\" I mean one - risotto. While a big plate of starch is good on occasion, I really wasn't in the mood for it that night. I ended up getting the soup of the day - asparagus with truffle creme fraiche. Tasty, but not memorable. I also had the butter lettuce salad, which I really liked. In addition, we had the squash blossom appetizers - outstanding. \n\nHere's the thing.

The fried okra, meatballs and other appetizers were deelish. I had the steak and it was cooked to perfection. It's a noisy place  so I wouldn't advise this place for an intimate experience but perfect for groups. Now let me get into why I only rated this place 2 stars. Our server was HORRENDOUS. I guess the \"The customer is always right\" message never got to him. This was a business dinner for one of my top clients and it was a pretty large group. We all ordered drinks and when they arrived, several people who ordered the root beer noticed they were flat. When we mentioned this to the server, instead of offering to fix it or bring something else, he argued with us! \"That's not possible\" he says. When our client offered him to take a sip, he still argued! I don't care if it came straight from the bottle, don't argue! Then he says \"so do you want something else then\" with such an attitude. That just set the tone. We went on to have an enjoyable evening despite him. Now here's the icing on the cake...when I, my co-worker and my boss were leaving (after the client had left, thank goodness), as we're hailing a cab, this FOOL runs out the door, chases us down to say \"you didn't leave the tip\"! Ok first of all, it was a group of 10 so we thought gratuity was already included but more than that, did he honestly think his attitude was worthy of something extra?!?! And secondly, he actually chased us down for it?!?!?! It wasn't like we skipped out on the check, just the \"extra\" tip. Here's a tip, find a new profession, perhaps a debating bounty hunter where you can argue and chase people til your heart's content! I don't think I'll be back despite the stellar food.

Thin layers of spiced cake, sweeten apples, and oat crumbles were all stacked on top of each other then topped with a large scoop of vanilla bean ice cream!!!! YUMMY! Since my friend is in LOVE with the butterscotch and chocolate creme, he had to order that for himself. I had a tasted of his and that was really good too. The bottom layer was chocolate and the top was butterscotch. It was topped with crunchy pieces of hard chocolate butterscotch candy.\n\nEvery course of wonderful. The prices are fairly more expensive, but the food was worth it. Although it was a Tuesday night, this place was quite busy, so the service wasn't that attentive. So that's why only 4 stars.", "author": "Denise L."}

Last, although not the best fried chicken I have had, it is better than most of the restaurants in the city.\n\nPeople say it is loud, and it can be.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-03-24", "description": "The point of fine dining is to enjoy yourself. From the AWFUL MARTINI to the UNDER-COOKED MEAT Town Hall has to be one of the most annoying dining experiences I've encountered. \n\nFor example, before we sat down for dinner, I ordered a drink from the bar. I found it hard to believe that they actually had two different size martini glasses. One might expect these proportions at a tacky caberet show in Reno or Waikiki but not at a restaurant that would like to be thought of as upscale. \n\nThey insisted that the larger standard size martini glasses were for juice martinis such as cosmos or lemon drops and the small martini glasses were for the classic martini. Either way,  they measure out meticulously, 2 ounces which they insist to be the standard. And, it may be the scientific standard but owner's Mitchell & Steven Rosenthal are penny-wise and pound-foolish.\n\nHaving just returned from NYC and frequented local pubs to renown restaurants such as Picholine, One If By Land Two If Sea, and Fiolrellos (across from Lincoln center) all these establishments served martinis in the conventional size glass that at least was a 3 to 3.5 ounce pour. Furthermore, Boulevard, Gary Danko and Hayes Street Grill in San Francisco all serve full pours around 3 - 3.5 which leads me to believe that the management at Town Hall are knowingly cheating their customers and unfortunately, not enough of them have spoken up about this rip-off or know any better.\n\nHere is a step=by-account of how Town Hall manages to create THE WORST MARTINI IN AMERICA...\n\n1) The bartender dumps the ice out of the mini martini glass and then proceeds to make the martini (which took several minutes) defeating the purpose of a chilled glass. (It is customary to immediately empty the glass of ice and then pour the freshly stirred martini into the glass optimizing the chilled effect.) \n\n2) I ask for two olives and he gives me one. \n\n3) Then I realize that there is no way two olives (conventional) would fit in this miniscule martini glass. (At least he did something right.) \n\n4) The olive is huge (the size of a walnut), thus displacing liquid and making it appear there is more vodka than there actually is. \n\n5) I bite into the thick, walnut-size, leathery textured olive and almost break my tooth on the olive pit (I can only imagine the olives came from one of those disgusting gallon size SYSCO cans.) Who in their right mind serves a martini with an olive that has a pit?!! \n\n6) This miniscule, wretched, worst excuse for a martini I've ever had the displeasure of attempting to enjoy is $12.50. I paid $14.00 in NYC but it was not a problem because the drink was 3 - 3.5 ounces in a standard martini glass and I expect costs are relatively higher in NYC.\n\nWhen we sat down at our table. I mentioned the penurious martini to our waiter who sent over a two-ounce measuring cup to try to prove something to me. She then sends over the manager who introduces himself as Mr. \"Can I help you with something?\", instead of introducing himself by his name and title. I have no idea who this stranger is standing next to me and ask \"who are you?\" He then properly introduces himself as the assistant manager and basically doesn't give a hoot about the size of traditional martinis, etc. because the house is packed and you can barely hear yourself amongst the din and clamor. \n\nNo apologies. They just do not get it. Or, they do get it as in, \"We, Mitchell & Steven Rosenthal, choose to be miserly with alcohol because most of our customers do not know any better and we will ignore the periodic complaints\".\n\nWe then order, and request well-done, the Beef short ribs and Hanger steak ($30). Then some random server places it in front of us and we ask \"Are you sure this is well-done?\" He says \"Yes\". (We assume he knows what he is talking about because we assume he was well-trained by the ma\u00eetre d' / manager and instructed by the waiter) However, this is not the case.\n\nThe beef short ribs were well-done and the hangar steak was so raw you could not slice it with the knife provided. Now, from my experience, the job of well-trained wait staff is to oversee the food as it comes out of the kitchen and if it does not meet the request of the customer or the standards set-forth by the ma\u00eetre d' / manager they send it back. A well-trained waiter is the intermediary between the kitchen and the customer. The beef short ribs were very good as well as the little tater-tots. The mushy blended-potato goo (a la baby food texture) was not necessary. \n\nThe appetizers were very good. We had stuffed peppers and the Ahi Tuna Tartar. \n\nIf you choose to go to this restaurant, only order appetizers and drink water (The wine pours appeared to be following the same game plan as the martinis) Who wants to be irritated when going out to dinner. It defeats the whole point. \n\nOur manager & waiter had an aloof attitude because the restaurant was packed, but with amateur service and a greedy alcohol policy the tide may turn.", "author": "VC m."}

I think that this is a very solid 5-star restaurant.\n\nOne thing that I can say is that this is a very SF restaurant.  There is a 'community' table in the front for people with no reservations or people dining solo.  \n\nWe started with the Veal meatballs.  They were (as most everyone else said) fantastic, cooked to perfection, the peppercorn sauce was a nice touch that wasn't over powering the delicateness of the Veal.  Along with that we tried the Tuna tare tare.  It was good, the fish was nice.  I think that the Tabasco vinaigrette was a bit overpowering.  Still very delicious.\n\nWe got a bottle of wine on our servers recommendation.  She hit a home run.  It was fantastic.  Paired with all of our entrees wonderfully.\n\nSpeaking of Entrees, they took forever.  I mean forever.  We are all used to waiting for our food to be prepared and having a casual dinner.  It took over an hour.  It wasn't until about 45 minutes that our server even said anything.\n\nThen finally 4 minutes before the food came out we got a few cups of the soup.  It was a nice gesture but really, we could have used it about 20 minutes before they brought it.\n\nI will say that the food was worth the wait.  The food here is fun.  You really want to just tear into it.  I had a Pork Chop that was crusted in Tasso ham and peanuts.  It was cooked to perfection, the starches that came with it were also good, not remarkable.\n\nThe others had a rib-eye and the rabbit.  Both were fantastic.  The steak (although cooked too rare) was really the most stand out plate.  It was served in a rich buttery sauce and a baked potato stuffed with Chantrele mushrooms, Fontina cheese and Craw fish.  The potato could have been its own meal.\n\nThe desserts were ridiculous.  Everyone here is correct.  The Pots de' Creme is off the chain.  We also had the dough nuts filled with Scharfen Burger (sp?) chocolate, it was good but I think that the pots de' creme is just too good. Go try it.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nGet anything with the Jalapeno cream sauce. It will change your life.", "author": "Thadd L."}

I say that because a lot of restaurants with a big rep seem to just fall flat.  \n\nReally liked the space, which is essentially divided into three sections: main dining area, bar and communal table.  There also is an outside seating area, but that looked like it was set up for a special group, and a private dining room.  Anyway, we ate at the bar, which is very warm and inviting, and very close to the kitchen so we got our food pretty fast.  Bartender was great--friendly but not in our face.  I dont know if it was because we got there early, but the noise level was very low, except for the barking orders coming from the kitchen, which was kind of entertaining.  This restaurant has great lighting fixtures.\n\nWe started out with the soup of the day, which was heirloom tomato with an herb biscuit and cream floating on top.  We also had the heirloom tomato fondu, served with fried squash, toast and broccoli.  Our final starter was the tuna tartare, served with fried green tomatos, garlic chips and a spicy onion vinaigrette.  We split the halibut, served with bay shrimp, sweet corn pudding, peas and morels, as an entree.  For dessert it was the butterscotch and chocolate pot-de-creme, with toffee chunks on top.  It was huge!  Best to split it.\n\nOverall, the food was great and flavorful.  Portion sizes are excellent.  Very cute how they deliver the bill inside of individual books, in which people have written comments.  Kind of like a portable bathroom stall.  I really dont have a complaint about this restaurant.\n\nOkay, one downside is that the bathroom is quite a long trekk from dining area.

I was told we didn't need to make a reservation.\nWhen we arrived, the hostess (charming) pulled menus and began to lead us into the restaurant, but she was halted a man to whom she yielded, so I imagine he was a manager. He spun all of us around and directed us to a long table between the two doors, basically the foyer. I balked because one door was wide open, and the other was open, with two red curtains, and it was cold and raining. He was very pushy, calling the table \"intimate,\" and we all finally relented so as to not make a scene. Big mistake. The door behind me led to the bathrooms, an upstairs room, and outdoors. The door to the outside remained open for the entire time we were there, and everyone in the place, including wait staff, was going in and out, huge garbage cans were dragged through the outside door, around 20 people clattered up and down the stairs (with potted orchids), one man dropped/slammed a bound pallet of dismantled cardboard boxes on the threshold that sounded like a gunshot. Meanwhile I fairly froze to death. And the wait station was right at the table, so waiters were clattering about right behind my husband and my son. We could hardly hear each other.\nMeanwhile, dessert, which is what we really came for, was lackluster. The peanut butter and chocolate torte which remains on the online menu, has not been a feature of their menu \"for a long time\" according to our waiter. \"We don't update the online stuff very often.\" Good to know. The pot de creme was...meh, the apple spice stayed warm only a minute situated between the January blasts of two open doors. My friend's coffee had large grounds floating on the surface. \nAfter we paid, I spoke to a manager (?) about the situation. She seemed sincere, but dense, telling me not once, but five times, \"Oh, that door is supposed to be closed at all times,\" as if repeating it would change the reality.\nShe made no offer to comp, but she did apologize, while reiterating the other manager's claim that the table was \"intimate.\" With a wait station 1 1/2 feet away, two open doors, and an endless stream of people coming and going...intimate, my a$$.

My favorite entree is the quail, which isn't currently on the menu because th is very picky about quality, and it's apparently hard to find a good piece of quail (get it?!--hardy har har) right now.  The fried chicken is quite yummy and comes as two pieces, a frenched breast and leg/thigh--perfect for sharing if you have a white meat lover and a dark meat lover.  \n\nAs for wine:  th's daily list (on the back of the menu) is pretty good, but if you have a pretty penny to spend, ask for the wine board.  There are some damn fine wines on that list.  I love the big, earthy Tuscan varietals, and th has been able to satisfy my cravings.\n\nIf you're table dining, as for Andrea; she is by far the best server I have had there, and she is hot and nice.   And if you're at the bar, order from Zeke. He rocks with the drinks and is very easy on the eyes as well.\n\nth is on opentable.com, so making reservations easy.

Due to the good times and vibe, we ended up staying there for dinner, and everyone loved the food (even a Texan who ordered the fried chicken).  And th had the quail back on the menu!  Yay!\n\nBtw, not many options for vegans, but the kitchen is willing to throw something (healthy--ick) together.", "author": "Kimberly Q."}

I got in my pajamas and settled down for the night after a long day of spitting and dick swinging. I tried to go to bed at one of the tables and couldn't find my bed side bible. I like to decipher the hidden alien text found within. They told me they only serve food and drink. What a shitty hotel.\nFinally onto the food and drink.\nThe menu reads like a comfort food menu. But what comes out is far more seductive and elaborate. Like a Rubik cube. But a sexy Rubik cube. Dan was kind enough to send out the toast with jalapeno cream sauce and fried egg on top. I did not even touch that mess but my friend did and she said it was amazing. She said the toast was still crispy even thought it was drenched in sauce. I am calling black magic on this one. She didn't eat the entire thing so she could save room for the entrees.\nThe entrees.\nShe ordered the Trout and it was cooked perfectly with the skin on it. I love fish with the skin on because it has way more flavor and I also like to pretend I am a bear (not the gay kind) stuffing my gut for the long winter. I ordered what sounded like a hearty soul food dish. Hangar steak, short ribs, and tater tots. I mean, they were called tater tots. No pommes tots or anything to disguise what they actually were. So I thought them to be less fancy. I was wrong. The tots were awesome. The broccoli rabe was thrown onto my friend's plate and I devoured the rest of everything. Short ribs were like butter. I shouldn't have asked for medium on my steak and the braised (or stewed) peal onion accompanied everything perfectly.\nI thoroughly enjoyed everything but my portion was pretty small for the price. That would be my only complaint about the food. \nAnd my other semi complaint would be how quiet the staff was. They seemed like their line ups previous to opening consist of \"WE ARE BORG. WE ARE BORG. ASSIMILATE!\" I didn't get a fun vibe from the group. The food was fun. But the staff was too fancy. The staff should give off the same vibe as the food they serve.\nMaybe in time, Dan will get them rollin'. Because I would love to see them rollin'. Just like Chamillionaire. We should all strive to roll one day like Chamillionaire.", "author": "Bannon R."}

The wine with appetizers were decent. Dinner was three courses from a prix fixe menu. Unfortunately, as a previous viewer had noted, options for vegetarian/ pescetarians were very limited. For those of us who ate fish, we pretty much had a bowl of rice for the entree-- nothing additional (no fish, no roasted portabella, no sprinkling of nuts, no vegan sausages, no splash of green in the presentation (imagine the possibilities especially in a place like SF)). For another colleague who could eat shellfish, meat was included in the dish. Another friend of mine has a medical condition where meat and dairy products cause her migraines, so all instances of meat in a dish should be specified. We have been to other places in the City that have accommodated vegetarians very well at that price range. If a vegetarian or pescatarian dish has to rely on bacon fat (or MSG) to bring out the flavor. Bacon fat not only renders the dish a meat dish, but is a cop out on creativity. \n\nOtherwise, the servers were friendly, professional and accommodating. The ambiance was also nice for a business meal, or a night out. Three stars, however, due to issues with the food. Hopefully the restaurant can take another look at their menu and take the California/ SF palate into consideration-- especially in regards to special diets, allergies, and prix-fixe menus for larger groups where options are much more limited.", "author": "Anonymous M."}

I had the rabbit and crawfish etoufee: it was serviceable, well prepared, and so forth.\n\nBut no surprises, really -  no flavor explosions, at least not in the etoufee: it was everything I expected it to be, nothing less and nothing more.  \n\nAnd unfortunately, while friendly, the service was slow and not on point in other ways.

And every time I would think \"maybe next time it will redeem itself.\" Now I'm convinced it will take a miracle to turn this place around.\n\nI like the concept of Town Hall and the menu looks great on paper, but not even the fabulous butterscotch pot de creme can redeem this place. \n\nSome of their food tastes like the kitchen is not rotating the stock.  This might explain the nearly-turned salad lettuce (on 2 separate occasions),  the stale jambalaya (which they tried to cover up by severely overspicing it) and oversalted and undercooked salmon. By the way tiger, these dishes will run you about 20 bucks each. For lunch even! \n\nThe service was never good at Town Hall, but recently it's become the worst thing about the place. Embarrassingly novice and awkward servers. Servers that don't even know how to pour water or serve a dish properly, and were obviously hired only because they're good at faking it or they are friends of the kitchen. They freaked when I pre-ordered dessert (because it took so long to get the mains) and asked if I wanted it at the end of the meal. Isn't that when dessert normally comes, buddy?  They sure do have a great time cracking jokes with the ghetto kitchen staff though, while we sat for 15 minutes waiting for the check. \n\n2 and a half hours and 94 bucks later, my lunch friend and I left, completely bummed. Even after we used our two 25.00 gift certificates to whittle down the bill we still felt ripped off. \n\nWhen it opened almost four years ago (time flies!), the food and service were the talk of the town.  It became a runaway smash which lead to legions of devoted diners that still go there today. But now that the restaurant has a sure-fire base of fans, it's milking them for all they're worth. \n\nFor this food and service, the prices are absolutely laughable, and the owners know it too, b/c they're laughing all the way to the bank!

I am IN LOVE with their squash blossoms.  I ate every single piece on the plate and then some.  My friend had their biscuits and gravy and although I don't eat meat, they looked delicious.  The biscuits were to die for, they melted in your mouth.\n\nThere are 3 reasons why I am not giving them 5 stars. I have worked in restaurants since I was 16 so I know a thing or two.  1) You are always supposed to clear 1st course plates before bringing our the second course.  Although my plate was cleared, my friend was still working on here biscuits and gravy.  They set our entrees down and attempted to make room for her 1st course on a small table. They should know better. 2) My halibut was under seasoned, which is better than over.  3) When it came down to dessert time, our server didn't know what the flavors of sorbet on the menu, and really was puzzled when we asked if he could check on that for us.  \n\nI know those might seem like little things, but it is the little things that count.

I'd been wanting to try Town Hall for years, and I was excited and eager, but it was terribly disappointing.\n\nBecause it's fancy dinner night, we tend to order a lot of food, so we had 2 starters, 2 entrees, and 2 sides: tuna tartare with fried green tomatoes, a standard beet salad with goat cheese, some kind of creole-style seafood dish, gnocchi, mac-n-cheese croquettes, and jalapeno corn bread.\n\n1. Tuna tartare is so standard that at a high-end place it should be really stand-out and worth having on the menu. This is very mediocre, and the fried green tomatoes tasted like they were fried the day before and reheated by microwave for our dish. (Top tuna tartares: Boulevard, Aqua, Range.)\n\n2. Beet salad. Same thing. It's such a standard dish that one should make it a signature, a reason to return for it. This was okay but nothing new or special or interesting. Frisee, goat cheese, blah-blah, forgettable vinaigrette. (Best beet salads: Chez Panisse, Boulevard.)\n\n3. Jalapeno corn bread--come on!! Once again, take a classic and put your spin on it. I'm not a huge corn bread fan anyway--sweetie really wanted it--but I tasted it and was unimpressed. I've had better, probably even boxed stuff that was better.\n\n4. Croquettes. There was something kind of sinfully yummy about these because it's fried mac-n-cheese, but they were still quite plain. I don't remember any kind of exciting aoli or anything accompanying them.\n\n5. Creole fishy thing. (Sorry, I should have written this in November when we went.) Nice touch serving crawdads, which are not common on local menus. This dish was okay, probably the second best, next to the \n\n6. Gnocchi, which was actually fantastic. The gnocchi's the reason I debated giving this place two stars.\n\n7. Dessert was some kind of cobbler with caramel in it. I'm not much of a dessert person, and when I am it's about chocolate, so I'll refrain from trying here.\n\nI settled on one star because the service was nothing special (not bad, either, but they weren't helpful with wine recs) and you have to travel really far and change floors to get to the bathroom. The ambiance is nothing special, and I wouldn't really care if the food were stellar.\n\nIt doesn't even stop here. We went home separately because it was Sunday night and we had things to do for Monday, and completely alone separately in our own beds, we had major difficulty sleeping and bizarre dreams. We're sure it was the food.\n\nOverall, I'd say Town Hall is impressive if you stick it somewhere in middle America. But for sophisticated San Francisco palates it doesn't cut it at all. I'm truly shocked it has made the Bay Area Top 100. I won't go back, and I feel completely turned off from trying their other outfits--Salt House and Anchor &amp; Hope.

But, you go to a restaurant for the food and the experience, right?  \n\nThe service started out as slightly rude. We were about 25 minutes early and the hostess snapped that we would be seated only at the time of our reservation.  So, we headed to the half-empty communal table and ordered drinks.  The drinks took about 15 minutes to arrive, at which point the waitress said that our table was ready...early. Before we could even pay for the drinks, the hostess hovered over us with menus ready to take us to our table.  She never said a word or even smiled, just hovered. Hmph!\n\nApps and dinner were \"good\" but nothing extraordinary.  Service was again sloooow.  The place seemed full, but not packed, so not sure of the issue.  Times between ordering and apps and then apps and entrees were both very long.  I didn't use a stopwatch, but the DW and I both kept asking each other, \"where is our food?\"\n\nVeal meatball app was tasty, but chorizo-crusted grouper entree was a bit over-cooked and not all that flavorful.  And, by \"crusted,\" they just mean little round slices of chorizo (like small pepperoni) over the top of the fish, which was kind of odd.  Side of fried okra was bland, but side of collards was very good.  Collards are tough to get right, so kudos to them!  DW had the soup of the day and the biscuits & ham, which were both good.  Total bill, with three glasses of wine and no dessert, was about $126 (not including cocktails - which must be paid to the bar and which I'll never understand... it seems like a total waste of time to have your customers pay twice in the same place...).\n\nOverall, it was \"good\" and \"fine,\" but there are plenty of better restaurants in SF.

The first visit was during lunch and I ordered the fish and chips and the fish was light, flaky, and well battered (not too much/not too little) and the portion size was just enough.  It was during the summer and unfortunately the restaurant had a flying insect problem that day but not so much to ruin my dining experience.  I went again last night and ordered the seafood etoufee.  Very nice dish...and that's coming from someone whose family is originally from Louisiana.  Good amount of crabmeat/shrimp/and crawfish with a dark flavorful roux based sauce.  There was actually a lot of entrees on the menu that sounded tasty..and a good number of them with a southern and/or cajun feel to them.  \n\nThe only thing that I do not like about this restaurant is that it was really loud on both occassions.  Bad acoustics, combined with a packed  restaurant, combined with loud music, made the place feel energized but I had to yell quite a bit to talk to my friends.  And the restaurant is also kind of pricey....with my etoufee dish coming in at about $26.  So for that reason, I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars, rounded up to 4.

My coworkers salivated over the online menu and boasted about our good fortune.\n\nI'm sad to report this, but overall I wasn't all that impressed with the food. I liked the brick interior and white wall interior, reminiscent of my five years on the east coast. It was freezing in the restaurant though (in a back corner no less, not even near a door), a little too remiscient of east coast winters that brought me back out to california.\n\nI had the tuna tartare and fried green tomato starter, the portobello sandwich with arugula and brie, and finished off with the butterscotch and chocolate pot de creme. \n\nStarter: The tartare did not come anywhere near the top of my list in its category. It was a little too saucy somehow, whereas the tuna should be able to stand a little more on its own. I remember all the places I've had incredible fried green tomatoes--Nashville, Atlanta, Dollywood--and San Francisco is not among them. Maybe I should just give up my high expectations for good fried green tomatoes outside of the otherwise scary deep south.\n\nSandwich: The portobello sandwich was complemented nicely by the arugula and made lovely by the brie. I wasn't going to order the sandwich until I got suckered in by the melted brie, which makes nearly anything amazing. I opted for a sandwich rather than a regular entree because the two fish items somehow weren't working for me and I don't eat duck, beef, lamb or pork. I almost ordered the artic char dish, complete with butternut squash puree and a pomegranate reduction. But, the server couldn't tell me whether it was farmed or wild and whether that mattered. (I wasn't previously familiar with char, and our server described the char as being similar to salmon. If you're going to describe something as similar to salmon, you should be prepared  to answer the farmed or wild question. And, on principle, there's no way I'm supporting a $19 purchase of farmed fish.)\n\nThe Dessert: Oh my god, the pot de creme. I was expecting a tiny little tub of yum. I got a massive cup of hella delish. If I were to return to Town Hall, it would be for wine and pot de creme. Yes, it's like glorified pudding, but so so so amazing and I want everyone to try it.", "author": "reb f."}

I said to myself...looks like the recession is hitting the Town Hall pretty quickly, but in a matter of minutes, the place was filled up rather quickly.  \n\nThe waiter was very prompt in taking our order, and I was a little disappointed when I asked him if the only vegetarian option on the menu was the risotto and asparagus with goat cheese, and he said yes. I was expecting him to tell me that the chef could prepare a vegetarian meal for me similar to what I had at the Salt House a few months ago. Anyway, I ended up ordering the Risotto, and my friend ordered the shrimp which she said was ok. We both had a glass or wine which I thought was a little pricey. ($15/glass). I also thought a small cup of decaf coffee for $5.00 was a little pricey as well.  I could have gone over to Starbucks and gotten a better deal. \n\nNow I am really glad that I don't drink coffee and I don't eat meat. I can't imagine what our check would have been. As it was, our meal came to $100 for both of us, and we had no appetizers and no desserts. \nI think Town Hall is a little on the pricey side.  I know that it is in San Francisco where rent is super high, bu c'mon for what they charged, I was expecting the food to be very good, and it was not all that. Salt House is a much better choice.

Our orders included the rib eye steaks, pork shank, tuna tar tar, potatoes, jalape\u00f1o corn bread and some additional appetizers.  The food was excellent and I commend the chefs!\n\nThe atmosphere is very nice with low lighting and candle lit ambiance.  The service, at least from our waiter, left something to be desired.  During the entire evening, from when we arrived to when we left, he consistently gave us the impression he would have rather been anywhere else but serving us.  We initially thought we understood most things on the menu but did eventually ask him a question.  He literally seemed exasperated and said, \"All right, I guess I'll have to explain the menu to you after all.\"  He was difficult to track down during dinner when we wanted additional drinks and, when the drink came, he actually leaned over the table and plopped it down while leaning with his back/side to us and no eye contact whatsoever.  The restaurant serves a bloody mary shooter and I did not see a \"regular\" bloody mary drink on the menu.  I asked the waiter if I could have a bloody mary and he seemed put off.  Even though there is a full bar, he told me in a disparaging tone he would have to check with the bar to see if they could make one.  I don't know if it's proper to list names in this format but if someone from the restaurant wants to contact me I will gladly let them know who this person is.  Maybe he had a bad day but his behavior certainly lessened the experience of dining here and his actions honestly would make me think twice about taking others here for a night out.\n\nThe restroom is a bit awkward to get to since you have to walk up a couple of flights of stairs, or take the elevator, to the second floor.  I don't know how old the carpet is along the staircase area but they really should consider replacing it.  The smell coming from it was awful and was very strong in that enclosed area.\n\nThey have a private company handling valet service but at $20 is a bit pricey.  You can do yourself a favor but searching the surrounding streets for empty parking spaces and save some money.

While waiting for our table, we took a seat at the crowded bar to share a toast over one of the highly raved about house specialty cocktails. Both drinks were expertly crafted and served by a skilled, non-pretentious female bartender.  Upon learning this was my first visit, two patrons seated at the bar insisted we try the BBQ shrimp as a starter.

Deelish!\n\nThe entree selection at TownHall seemed to offer something for just about everyone, unless that is,  you are a vegetarian. Part of the night's enjoyment was spent sipping fancy coctails and fantisizing about each dish before finally making a decision. The food was 4.5 stars, perhaps even 5.   After much deliberation, we finally opted for slow-roated lamb shank and bacon wrapped Alaskan halibut.  Both dishes wree brilliantly executed and our server was as polite and helpful in her recommendations as I could ever expect.  \n\nI dare say, for a fine dining in a comfortably stylish setting that lacks much  the uppity-ness found at other venues of its caliber, Town Hall ranks in SAn Francisco's Top 5.", "author": "Lady D S."}

We had a party of 7, and it was 8:45 on a Thursday night.  I was somewhat surprised when the hostess - dear sweet gal in demeanor - said she'd try to fit us in, and put our name down for a 9:30 res.\n\nAn hour and fifteen and a glass of cab later, we were FINALLY seated, with some prodding by one of our group members.  I knew a wait was to be expected, but for those in our group who did not partake in the imbibing, they were famished and wanted instant gratification in the form of something non-liquid.  \n\nI ordered the Niman Ranch pork osso bucco with polenta and peas and thought it was quite tasty.  Probably not the best osso bucco I've ever had, but it still hit the spot, and was somewhat reasonable at $25.  The meat was tender and slid off the bone, as is customary of osso bucco.  Most of the others in our party ordered the fried chicken.  According to them, it was \"meh\" and the accompanying biscuits were served cold, which did not sound appetizing.  Another in our group ordered the NY Strip Steak, and he seemed to enjoy it.  And if he didn't, one wouldn't be able to tell since he consumed everything but the plate.  Still two others in our group left because the wait for our food to arrive outwaited them.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed it - I love the ambiance and decor of Town Hall, with its rustic brick walls and open floor plan.

Not something I would normally order.  It was good quality comfort food.  The mashed potatoes and collard greens were a good compliment.  \n\nMy customer ordered the ribs.

It was also girls night so we were looking forward to a night of indulgence! The restaurant looks cool and trendy with a pretty big bar and some outdoor seating.  We got 7:30 reservations and were seated promptly.  The weird thing was, it was a Friday night and the restaurant was only half full.  Not sure why. \n\nWe started with 2 appetizers: the softshell crab with guacamole and mango salsa, and fried oysters.  Both were delicious and great starters.  I could not get enough of the mango salsa! For some reason, I also could not stop eating the bread.  It must have been the super soft and spreadable butter. \n\nFor our entrees, we decided to each pick one thing and just share amongst the 4 of us.  We decided on the fried chicken, bacon wrapped quail, pork chop, and st louis BBQ ribs. For our sides, we got the corn bread and tater tots.  Everything was so good! I especially loved the ribs (even though I'm not usually into saucy ribs).  The fried chicken was juicy and the batter was nice and crispy. The quail was good but different and not what I had expected.  I was expecting a full quail with wings and all but instead it looked more like a quail cake? The pork chop was good even though I'm usually not a fan of thick cut pork chop.  The fried grits that came with it though was amazing.  So crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.  The sides were delicious as well. I loved the corn bread even though I couldn't really taste the jalapeno.  They came in little finger sized pieces - very cute. The tater tots came with this spicy BBQ sauce for dipping.  Loved the sauce! \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the mini doughnuts with blue bottle ice cream, the butterscotch & chocolate pot de creme, and lemon souffle. All were fantastic but my favorite was the mini doughnuts.  The souffle was nice and light, almost like a lemon sorbet - very refreshing! Since it was my friend's birthday, they also gave us 3 mini cupcakes on the house. That was very nice! \n\nOverall, the food was yummy and the ambiance was laid back but still nice. The service was attentive.  They also had some specialty cocktails.  I liked the corpse reviver #2 - refreshing and fruity.

American as apple pie, the menu doesn't shortchange on flavorful food.  And true to our heritage, this place will undoubtedly put you into the 64.5% of the American population that is currently obese. Laced with as much pork product as my southern heart could possibly desire, the menu is downright delicious.  But for all you foreign tongues and terrorists out there be forewarned, it's neither light nor \"lite.\"  A meal here will leave your stomach bulging for hours, though the memory of the food will carry on for days.  \n\nThe highlight of this institution is undoubtedly the finale.  We're talking about serious proportion issues among the dessert plates.  Pound for pound, my bread pudding and my friend's sticky toffee cake outweighed both of our entrees.

The food was under seasoned, bland, and dry. 3 of us got the duck, there was no sauce and the duck was overcooked. My mom ordered the halibut and they brought her salmon. Which starts the discussion on how HORRIBLE the service was. Our waiter was inattentive and took almost 30 minutes just to bring our drinks. The manager came over and apologized about the entree mistake, but when the bill came both the wrong entree and the halibut were on the bill. Talk about not paying any attention!\n\nDefinitely will not be returning anytime soon.

Disappointed, we started walking towards Market and eventually down to Town Hall after gaining an appetite during our unexpected tour through the Financial District and remembered our Check Please Bay Area list and found Town Hall. \n\nSo, we were dressed for BBQ on Haight and not for business-casual dining, but whatever; we walked in and felt out of place right away, but only had to wait about five minutes for a table. I don't think the host ever spoke to us and used his directional signals as his only means of communication.  It was still pretty crowded at 9pm and the crowd was pretty and upbeat (and on expense accounts)-- a convention in town from the looks of the swag bags and embroidered polo shirts all around.\n\nThe place is beautiful, with exposed beams and bricks as far as the eye can see. The lighting was dim even though there were about a dozen cool-looking chandeliers all along the dining room and enough candles to warrant a fire inspection.\n\nToo bad the service couldn't keep up with the designers.  The waiter dropped off the water on the table without saying a word and returned five minutes later to tell us the soup of the day and left again for about ten minutes to take our drink order.  Five minutes later he dropped off the drinks and left while I practically begged for bread (twice!), which he refused to hear.  We ended up asking the nice guy refilling our waters and it was brought out right away.  When the waiter returned another five minutes later after we stared him down from the large table of convention-goers a few tables away, I asked for a suggestion for the main course and he basically said they were all good and wasn't too much help at all.  So, we started out with the soup (a wonderful gumbo) and the heirloom tomato salad with green colors and flavor.\n\nThe lack of service was suddenly replaced with overzealous table-clearing as the waiter took my soup with a good five spoonfuls left without saying a word!  Woah, that was a surprise.  A minute later another swooshed in and dropped the main courses.  Admittedly, the food was excellent.  We had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and bacon gravy and seasoned vegetables and the fish with red wine sauce.  The chicken was moist and the breading was crispy!\n\nAgain, the waiter tried to pick up my dish before I was done!  Yikes; I protested and he apologized, but the damage was done.

The woman on the phone assured me it wasn't a big deal, and we would be seated when we arrived.\nWell, when we got there it was a whole other story. I told the hostess about the conversation I'd had with the woman on the phone, (which was not her.) She informed me that our table had been given away, and they only hold the reservation for 15 mins. That's fine, and understandable, but not it f you don't mention it on the phone. She went on to tell me that the woman i spoke to is very clear about explaining that.Whatever, like I'm going to lie to her? That annoyed me beyond belief. I thought she was incredibly stuck-up and rude. I was ready to leave, but someone higher in command than her found us a table. He did tell us we had to be out by 8, (which was an hour and a half away.) I appreciated his effort, and we gave it shot.\nI'm so glad we did! The appetizer of poached egg and ham toast was amazing! I would order that again without thinking twice!\nOur entrees took a very long time to get there. I had the bacon wrapped trout, with lemony potatoes. \nThis was a different preparation of trout than I 'd ever had. The components of the dish separately aren't that impressive.Although, when you have a bite of the salty bacon with the lemony potatoes, the flavors are amazing. I couldn't believe how well they worked together! I'm just more accustomed to eating my meal in sections. There was something that did strike me as odd about the fish,it's from Scotland. Why wouldn't they use local fish? With such a bounty of fresh fish available in the bay area, i see no reason to use fish from another country. They probably doesn't bother most people though. Maybe it's just me.\nFor dessert we had the pot de creme. We were told it was one  their signature items. I didn't think I'd be too crazy about it, but i loved it!\n\nThe prices here are a little high, and the service isn't great. Although, the food is interesting,creative and well executed.\nThe noise level is another reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars. It seemed to increase as the night went on.

Parties of more than 6 require a credit card (including expiration date) to be given, but you have to ask three separate questions to learn that if you are a no-show, your card will be charged $20 per person (PER PERSON?!?!!!!), which will be \"credited\" back to you in a gift certificate to Town Hall.  \n\nI know times are hard in the restaurant business, but seriously?

Plus, there's no option for 4.5 stars.\n\nAnyway! The counting factor that pushed me to the full 5 stars was my starter course at Town Hall. The Deep Fried Squash Blossoms filled with 4 cheeses, served with a pesto dipping sauce and a red pepper salad/dip. It was the most magnificent pairing of cheese and vegetable I think I will ever taste! Since eating there this past Tuesday, I've been contemplating going back and ordering 5 plates of them...so delicious!\n\nHowever, before my appetizer came out, I was enjoying the Eli Refresher, which was tasty. I was craving tropical fruits (especially guava) and some alcohol after my day at work and it definitely hit the spot!\n\nSo yadah, yah...then our entrees came out...GLORIOUS!!! I had ordered the Pork Chop and when it came out it made a statement! Sort of how the final dress of a designer at fashion week presents their  last outfit in the show and everyone gasp and jaws drop to the floor...that was my table's reaction to my pork chop. It was this huge, thick pork chop on top of a bed of spicy dirty rice, served with a pomegranate sauce. D-LISH! My two aunts both ordered the halibut, which I will admit I entertained the idea of ordering when menus were passed about, but I was far too happy with my pork chop decision. My mom ordered the famous fried chicken.\n\nOn a breakdown...it's obvious I loved my pork chop! My two aunts loved their halibut as well. The three of us scraped our plates clean..every morsel was taken prisoner. However, the famous chicken we'd heard so much about left my mom a little disappointed. I didn't try it...but she said the flavor was all in the crust and the actual meat of the chicken was bland. This made me sad...but at the same time happy because I didn't order the chicken.\n\nBut when dessert came out, it made a fan out of all of us. My aunt ordered the date/toffee sticky bread - it was good, she killed it. My mom ordered the Butterscotch & Chocolate Pot de Creme, which totally made her experience worthwhile...and everyone else cause we all tried it and loved it! And I ordered the Donuts with Espresso Ice Cream...which was tasty but the donuts just didn't do it for me. Good thing mom ordered the Butterscotch & Chocolate Pot de Happiness!\n\nWe were all definitely happy when we left and very full. The food was amazing, despite a few faults. But overall, the 5 is deserved. The staff was very attentive and welcoming. The decor was casual and comfortable...yet rustic at the same time. Only thing that might bother people is the noise...but I'm young and don't mind yelling, so it was cool with me.\n\nWould definitely say everyone has gotta at least eat here once...it's worth it.

Town Hall helped us nail it.  In particular, Colleen Booth, the Director of Public Relations & Events, was a major reason why we chose to go with Town Hall.

Please keep reading . . .\n\nI took my friend to Town Hall for lunch to celebrate his passing the California Bar Exam (insert your favorite lawyer joke here).  We parked at the meter right in front of the entrance and walked in.  It was 11:30 am, so the place was pretty empty.  It filled up quickly, though; people just kept piling in.\n\nThe decor is beautiful in its simplicity: exposed brick, white wood siding, wooden tables and chairs, metal lighting fixtures.  It had that \"I bought a house on Cape Cod, remodeled it and moved it to SOMA\" feel.  The two styles were a bit eclectic for my taste, but it seemed to work for Town Hall.  I loved the water glasses and water pitcher they gave us: simple clear glasses with a gilded edge and a pitcher with a similar gilded pattern.  They made me think of my parents' dinner table from the days of yore.  Nostalgia at its best.  \n\nAlas, the food itself was neither eclectic nor original.  I had a butter lettuce salad with candied walnuts, radishes, bleu cheese and Fuji apples.  The dressing was bland, although there was a lot of it.  My friend had the tuna tartare . . .  I think my salad was a better value for the money.  The tuna was good, but . . . I'd compare it to sashimi from Todai, not tuna tartare from Aqua.  Trust me on that.\n\nFor my main course, I went with a Town Hall cheesesteak with french fries.  Tender, thinly sliced steak was topped with bell peppers and sauteed onions and drenched in white cheese.  All this cheesy, meaty goodness was served on a nice roll with a side of french fries.  The cheesesteak was delicious, but the french fries were not my cup of tea.  They were too crispy and too salty.  My friend had a pork chop, which was obviously overcooked.  I tried a piece, and it was not as tender as I would have expected.  The pork chop was served on the bed of spicy organic grits.  They were OK, but almost too spicy for that bland pork chop.\n\nOur waiter seemed somewhat disinterested in helping us, although the service wasn't bad.  They refilled my iced tea and my friend's Arnold Palmer promptly, but our request for more bread seemed to annoy them.  Interesting note: to refill my friend's Arnold Palmer, the waiter brought two pitchers--one with iced tea and one with lemonade--and poured them in a glass at the table.  I mean, I understand how the drink is made, but you don't see that every day.\n\nThey brought our check in . . . an old book.  It was an old, dog-eared hardcover edition of  \"Let Love Come Last\" by Taylor Caldwell.  What a cute, fun idea, to bring a check in an old book.  Almost made me feel like I didn't just spend $80 on lunch!

One of our party had been here before, not long after its 2003 opening, and had remembered it as being something special.\n\nWe began the evening with the standard basket of bread (nice and crusty)  while we shared a bottle of 2007 Copain 'Tous Ensemble' Viognier. \n\nThen our appetizer appeared: crispy squash blossoms, four cheese filling, basil pesto and tomato vinaigrette. It was perfectly crispy and the cheese nice and gooey. It was a beautiful medley of tastes and textures! \n\nSoon after, we received our soup and salad. The soup of the day was a delectable vichyssoise (a cold, creamy, potato-leek soup) that was topped with a light sprinkling of chopped chives. The texture was silky smooth and the soup itself was exquisitely seasoned. The salad we chose to share was the Chopped Vegetable Salad with English peas, artichokes, Brentwood corn, parmesan and sherry vinaigrette. Again, this dish was perfectly seasoned and the vegetables provided just the right amount of crunch.\n\nWhen it came time for the entrees, we ordered the halibut, short ribs and gnocchi. The Roasted Alaskan Halibut was served over a serving of corn pudding along with porcini mushrooms, fava beans and bay shrimp salsa verde. The flavors were wonderful and the sear on the halibut was a beautiful caramel color with the slightest hint of a crunch. The Creekstone Beef Short Ribs were served with an array of potato gnocchi, artichokes, carrots, spring garlic and red wine jus. It was very flavorful and tender - just as short ribs should be! Finally, the House-made Potato Gnocchi. It was mixed with Brentwood corn, morels, English peas and shaved Umbria truffles. The marbled appearance of the truffles was beautiful and the flavor of the dish was rich without being overpowering (in other words, no heavy sauce).\n\nNow, although we all had enjoyed our dinner immensely up until this point, the creme de la creme really came at dessert time. Although several dishes caught our eye, one in particular seemed to call to us: the Sticky Toffee Cake. The cake was presented before us and our eyes about popped out of their sockets. It was a beautiful, spongy caramel colored cake swimming in a sea of thick, delicious caramel, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a sprinkling of chopped nuts. It was completely decadent and it was the one thing we found ourselves talking about for the rest of the evening and the next day!\n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant to others, my only gripes being that it was a pretty noisy room and although our server was quite knowledgeable, after taking our orders, we didn't see much of him...", "author": "Nicole D."}

Last night I had the Tuna tartare, cornmeal fried green tomatoes, garlic chips, Tabasco green onion vinaigrette ($15), Piquillo peppers, blue crab-Bienville stuffing, vermouth lobster cream ($15), and BBQ shrimp, Worcestershire sauce, garlic herb toast ($15) for appetizers.  Every bite was delicious with such a interesting mix of flavors.  Town Hall definitely takes normal food and puts a new spin on them.  For entrees I had the monk catfish and the Alaskan Halibut.  Both were about $25 I think and both cooked to perfection.  The catfish was actually the better of the two IMO - it was in some delicious sauce that reminded me of  gumbo and also was accompanied by mussels.

Good, tasty, with some sort of pecan rice and some overly-heavy and too salty sauce on the side.  But again, not anything terribly memorable.  My dining companions rated their Arctic char excellent, while the petite decapitated quail wrapped, Michelin man-like, in bacon strips around his (her?) waist was pronounced \"good.\"   Same with the cheese fondue.  The wine?  Fine.  So it's all pretty good, but doesn't quite live up to the hype.\n\nWhat I really liked about this place was the atmosphere- hence the extra star.  The service was warm, professional, and friendly.  The dining room and bar area were busy and lively without being loud and obnoxious.  And waiting near the bar for our drinks, there was a really friendly vibe - lots of smiles, chatting with strangers.  It was a very convivial place, and kind of homey (of course, I come from Boston, so the familiar New England-style decor had something to do with the comfy vibe as well.)\n\nSo I would, definitely, go back, and maybe try a different main course.

So glad it was because it was free for me! But it definitely is going to bring me here again when the wallet is big enough...\n\nThe downstairs bar and dining area is lowly dimmed and it does have an old town/main street feel to it. We went downstairs for a drink before the dinner actually started and had some wine. My boss paid for the round and they served the bill inside an old book. Ha.. \n\nSo upstairs it was nicely set up with 10 per table with candles in the center and the menu of our menu options. I got the Butter Lettuce Salad and the Short Ribs. A glass of wine was served with our meal and it was so delicious. The butter lettuce salad was HUGE and could have been a meal in and of itself. The dressing was not too creamy and there was a good enough amount of bleu cheese crumbles and toasted walnuts that made the salad very satisfying. The Short Ribs was perfect - nice flavor and served with pureed carrots, baby carrots and mushrooms. It was 2 large pieces of meat. Some of my coworkers had slabs that were really fatty, but I found that I didn't have any fat in mine so I couldn't complain. \n\nDessert was ehh... it was a chocolate tart but was essentially a Brownie baked in a chocolate/oreo crust. I liked the crust better than the acutal cake/brownie and also liked the miniscule scoop of vanilla ice cream and the little choco cookie on the bottom.\n\nOverall, great food. I looked at the menu online, and the price is a bit steep (20-30 a plate) but I definitely would love to come back here and experience again.", "author": "Alyson C."}

Ordered up a couple of special whiskey cocktails (Sazerac and Driver 8). Both were strong and beautifully prepared. I would expect nothing less for $9 each!\n\nNext up were the Roasted Veal Meatballs and the Warm Ham & Cheese Toast. The meatballs were very flavorful and served on a bed of mashed potato puree and an intense peppercorn sauce.  The Ham & Cheese Toast was simply fantastic. It was an unusual combination of flavors (spicy jalapeno and savory ham) and textures (soft poached egg, silky hollandaise with crunchy bread and ham). \n\nWe chose to split the Etouffee Shrimp and rice for the main course. It comes with cornmeal fried oysters in a pool of salty, spicy Cajun sauce. The flavors were rich and strong, but I found the sauce was a little salty for my taste. \n\nFor dessert, we chose to share the Butterscotch and Chocolate Pot de Creme. A great dessert choice and mix of rich smooth textures. The chocolate was dark (not too sweet) with a thin tasty layer of butterscotch creme on top.\n\nOverall, I thought the food was outstanding, and the service friendly and professional.

There were four of us, we had a reservation for 6:45. Three of us arrived at 6:30 (no traffic from the East Bay!) and they seated us early. Service is typical in my experience of Southern cuisine restaurants, slow. But not rudely slow, intentionally slow so as not to rush people through their meal and let them enjoy their company. \n\nThe only small critique I would make about service is that I agree with others that servers should ask if people are done eating before taking their plates. My plate was removed with a little piece of bread on it that I was still eating and a shared side dish was removed with a little bit of food left in it. I don't know if anyone wanted to eat it at that point, but I think a quick, \"May I take this away?\" is always appreciated.\n\nBesides that, everything was excellent. I had a Louisiana Purchase cocktail that was delicious, sweet, spicy, and refreshing. The tuna tartar with fried green tomatoes was top notch though I could have done with a less creamy sauce drizzled on the tomatoes, they were so delicate that I thought even the small drizzle was overpowering.\n\nI had the only vegetarian option for my main: Grits with truffles and fresh vegetables. I am not a vegetarian and was worried I would be missing out with this dish (but my love of grits pushed me to it). I was blown away. I tasted friends' Fried Chicken and Halibut, both were great. My husband's Seafood Etoufe was not my favorite but he loved it. The beignets and illy espresso ice cream were good but not as great as the rest of the meal.\n\nI would certainly come back to Town Hall, it was a great dining experience!", "author": "Katrina L."}

The rest just doesnt follow. \nI could have got over the fact that my girlfriend could barely hear what I was saying throughout the meal if the food and/or the service would have been great.\nIt took more than 45 min for the main course to come after we were done with the starter. The first explanation was that the trout takes 45 min - It doesn't - It takes 5 min to grill a trout. Second explanation was that the kitchen prepares food for 6 tables at a time. Well, bad luck if you aren't in the first wave! \nThe trout was actually not bad but the ravioli came cold - had to send them back - and were definitely not worth the wait. \nI appreciated that the ravioli (16$) were taken off the bill.

When in doubt, get a Mitcherita--its the perfect combination of Patron, lime juice, and some  X-Factor ingredient that makes a shitty day at work A-OK.  Also yummy is Eli's Refresher, a mix of rum and guava juice.  I usually ask for double rum, since the flavor of the guava is kind of overpowering.  And even though everyone makes fun of me for ordering these (\"the last time I had a long island was as a sophomore in college\"), their long islands are pretty much awesome.  \n\nOther staples during our frequent office happy hours?\n\n1. The Shrimp Toast.  The waitresses tell me they put literally a pound of butter in each dish, but holy hell, its good.  You'll need an extra side of bread to lap up every last drop of the gravy.  Yeah, its that good.\n\n2. The Veal Meatballs over mashed potatoes and gravy.  Um, I don't think that one requires much explaining.  \n\n3. My personal favorite: The Fried Chicken with brussell sprouts and mashed potatoes.  I consider myself a fried chicken connoisseur, and I kid you not--Town Hall has the best fried chicken in San Francisco.  Its so delectably juicy, and yet its not that greasy (how the hell do they do that?)... the outside is perfectly crispy... its my ultimate comfort food.

The crab artichoke dip  served in a fondue pot was good. The tuna tartare with fried green tomato was the best appetizer by far. I had the fried chicken which was absolutely awesome! It had a nice crispy skin and the chicken was tender and juicy! \n\nWould definitely recommend it to ppl that live in the soma area or need a restaurant right off the bridge. There are much better places I would rather go to but appreciated coming back to this SF favorite.", "author": "Josephine H."}

The place can get pretty packed with people milling around the bar and increasing the noise level. This, in turn, makes it pretty difficult to talk even when you're standing next to one another. Moreover, the ceilings are pretty high, so that makes it an echo chamber.\n\nThe food is pretty good, despite the noise. The service is excellent. We will well attended to through out the meal. We ordered a few appetizers; the friend that I was with ordered the grilled duck with pistachio sausage - it was quite unique and awesome. For the main course, I had the slow roasted duck with gingersnap gravy. It's not often you see a gingersnap gravy and it proved to be worth the order. My friend had the day boat scallops. They were presented nicely, but the kitchen went overboard on the salt; it tasted like you were drinking seawater.", "author": "Dan M."}

Yeah, we suck and don't plan ahead very well. Town Hall is no place for romance but I had wanted to come here and they had an opening for a Saturday night so this gave us the chance to try it out.\n\nFor the price (around $75 per person including a glass of wine for each of us) I could probably go somewhere else and have an amazing meal. The food here is pretty good but not amazing. What was really good was the Tuna Tartare appetizer and the Hot Chocolate for dessert. \n\nI watched the movie Chocolat the other week and have been craving a hot chocolate like the one in the movie and got it at Town Hall. The hot chocolate is like liquid heaven. I got increasingly happier each time I took a sip of it. It is humoungous so we only finished half of it even that. It's so rich though I don't think anyone should drink all of it. That's a big cup it comes in - lotsa heavenly goodness. It actually changed my mood it was so good. Happy Valentine's to me! I would have only given three stars but that hot chocolate pushed it to four!\n\nWe also had the Beet Salad, Rib Eye, Jalapeno Bread, Pot du Creme, and the Trout wrapped in Bacon. All okay. I didn't get a taste of the fish since my husband ate it in 4 bites and under 3 minutes. He was starving. I asked if it was good and he said it was okay. I can't tell if that was really good or what, but he ate it all up.\n\nAtmosphere is lively and loud. I liked it. If  can get a pretty good meal wearing jeans I'm very happy. There were young couples, old couples, and even families here. Service was excellent and since it was a Saturday night we got free street parking across the street from the restaurant. Bonus! Ahhh, free easy parking, that makes me almost as happy as the hot chocolate.", "author": "Wendy B."}

Also servers brought out the wrong appetizers more than once, entrees didn't come out at once (not a huge deal, but a few people waited longer than they should have), then they gave us some other party's doggie bag...all minor snafus, but, still.

I too decided on the friend chicken... and while it was juicy and pretty tasty, it wasn't out of this world.  But yeah, the creamed corn and biscuits definitely made up for it.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the chocolate cake with ice cream... wow. So rich.

Surprisingly, we had no problem hearing each other.\n\nThe service was a bit slow getting started, but once we gave our orders the food came out quickly enough.  My persimmon salad was well dressed.  Many places drown the greens, but this was just right.  Unfortunately, the persimmon itself didn't have much flavor at all.  The biscuits, however, were amazing.  The cocktails - the \"back in fashion\" (old fashioned) and mitcharita - were a highlight as well.  \n\nThe trout was excellent and the scallops good, though the brussels sprouts with the scallops were undercooked.  The dessert was the most disappointing part of the meal.  The apple crisp wasn't bad, just unmemorable.  The coffee, I'm sad to say, was burnt and bitter, even if it was served in a tiny french press.  That's almost enough to knock it down to 3 stars.\n\nThe best part of the evening was chatting with the other people at the table.

For me, the duck with wild rice and i-forget-what sauce. The duck was a bit too rare for me, but it was still very delish. A very generous serving of pot de creme, chocolate and butterscotch with pieces of toffeed chocolate--beyond decadent.\n\nVery good service.

GOOD deal. \n\nwent halfsies today on the pastrami and steak sandwiches - their first day out today. the pastrami..... good texture, not too riddled with fat, good mustard, great choice of bread. however, it could have used more seasoning. not enough of a pastrami flavor as i'm used to. steak sandwich - again, could have used more seasoning. the grilled peppers were really sweet. the sandwich lacked char throughout too. i like the tri tip sandwich at pluto's on irving better. \n\ndid i cover all of it? i think so. OH, and the bearded-chubby order caller is awesome - he wears a different threadless tee every day, and listen closely when he calls for a chicken sandwich - you'll smile and never get sick of it. oh! watch for your order. someone else later in line may end up getting your order first if you're not attentive.\n\nbottom line is that i love being able to try town hall without town hall prices.", "author": "Melissa C."}

This place was pretty packed even at the start of dinner service, so the noise level was high but okay.  \n\nWhat I really loved about this place was the excellent service I got from the staff and the pot de creme for dessert.

On top of that, even the hostess struck up a conversation with me (again, perhaps due to my clothes...)  The pot de creme was rich and delicious.

Veal meatballs were a letdown... the veal flavor was rubbed out by the blah demi sauce and potato puree.  For yucky meatballs at 1/10 the price see my review of the Subs, Inc!\n\nAnyways, the food was generally good but the prices were unseemly... The menu reminded me of Magnolia Grill in Durham, North Carolina, which executes this southern fried haute cuisine in the same price range with much more care (check the rabbit trio, since when did SF bite dishes from Durham?!?)... of course, you have to go to NC for the original.\n\nBonus points to the bar for a proper rye manhattan!

There is a large communal table to the right - great way to meet new friends & share what each others are having.  The long bar is a place people (like me) who didn't make reservation try to grab a seat or two -- you gotta have the eye for who is finishing up their meals then plant yourself literally right behind them!  That way when they start to get out of their seats it's your cue to slide on in with \"oh are you leaving\".  I've eaten here by myself (like I said I don't cook) at the bar and it's great.  The bartenders are extremely nice & attentive and some remember who you are so it makes you want to go back for that greeting of \"hey great to see you again\".  \n\nThe Tuna Tartare is different but delicious with the fried green tomatoes.  Barbecued shrimp are a must have - YUM! and of course the veal meatballs with potato puree.  I usually have a bunch of starters with glasses of red wine.  Wine selections are extensive - both by the glass and by bottles.  \n\nDefinitely a happy hour scene - always pack.

I have also recommended this place to every one under the sun.\n\nThe converted town hall offers a fun ambiance: not too loud so you can't hear yourself think, but amped up enough for you to feel like you're at a grand family gathering all around. The waiters are incredibly knowledgeable and honest about the dishes on the menu (must not be too hard when everything is incredibly scrumptious), and your water glass is never half empty. ;)\n\nNow onto the food ... MARVELOUS. I can't think of enough adjectives to describe Town Hall. Some of my favorite dishes include the barbecued shrimp on garlic herb toast; braised short ribs; bacon and cheddar croquettes; and buttermilk fried chicken, just to name a few.

I have to say, as good as the food is here, it could be served out of the trunk of a car and I would be sitting right there in a lawn chair, drinking wine from a box, and once again eating myself into a coma.\n\nI love to go to a place and order many things as I usually can't just decide on one.

The menu is positively outstanding. They walk the brilliant fine line between inventive yet inviting, and interesting yet reliable. When you see fried chicken with biscuits and bacon gravy, accompanied by creamed corn...you know you're not going to be disappointed. Yet when it arrives at the table, it's so much more than *just* what the menu said - the flavors are much more complex.\n\nAppetizers even hit it out of the park, with such delights as biscuits with pepper jelly and ham; butter lettuce salad with blue cheese, fiji apples and candied walnuts; and jalapeno cornbread...just to name a few. Whenever I move to the entrees, I'm intrigued by just about everything offered, but find it really hard to steer clear of the piping hot, perfectly crisped fried chicken, which I believe to be the best in the City (other greats include 1300 Fillmore, Maverick, and Powell's - if it's still around).\n\nNow some places like this manage to do a face-plant when it comes to desserts, but not Town Hall. If you like yours rich and delicious, you'll be satisfied. I find San Francisco's Best Cup of Hot Chocolate to be out of this world, and am saddened it is considered a \"winter\" item only (hello, August in San Francisco IS winter). My husband can't get enough of the Butterscotch Chocolate Pot de Creme, which is so rich it makes your eyes burn. Sticky toffee chocolate cake is also good...and I think you're getting the idea. Now pile on attentive service, a solid wine list, a great and lively atmosphere, and the opportunity to eat at the communal table or bar when OpenTable laughs at your reservation request, and this is easily one of the best spots in town. \n\nMy single issue with the place (and mind you, not enough of an issue to bring it down from 5 stars) is the 10-person reservation limit for the public dining room. Beyond that number, you have to go private with a $1000 minimum, which I find absolutely absurd - for lunch, mind you! Boulevard's minimum is $350 for 12 people...take that as a cue, Town Hall.

The Bathrooms are an adventure to find, but you are rewarded with a great picture in there of French people burning themselves four different ways.  Don't miss that.\n\nLast night we started with the BBQ Shrimp for $13...very good.  A plate of yummy Oysters and a big bowl of Mussels...all very good.  For an Entree I got the lamb shank for $22.50 and it was really good.  \n\nWe sat outside where the service is no where near as good as inside.  Out of sight, out of mind with our waiter.  But it was a nice night, so it was fine.  We all loved our food and while we thought it was a bit pricey, it was worth it.", "author": "Pele N."}

As a Salt House devotee, I was hoping that the original would be even better, but I was disappointed.  \n\nFirst of all, my friend and I had a 5:45pm reservation which worked perfectly for us timing wise, but the place looked more like an Outback Steakhouse with the amount of children dining there.  I was so surprised.  Not a good place for dirty girl talk and catching up.  \n\nI ordered the Hama Hama oysters for a starter and they were good.  I have had smaller, more flavorful Hama Hamas though.  I don't think they got first pick of the bunch.\n\nFor my main I ordered the scallops on jambalaya with crab butter.  Now, I LOVE spicy food, and I was duly warned that the dish was spicy.  That was not the problem.  The problem was that the scallops were so overpowered by the jambalaya that I couldn't taste them.  I ended up taking them off of the top of the dish and eating them separately and then finishing with the Jambalaya.  It was easier just pretending they were two dishes because separately they were both good on their own.  \n\nThe cocktails were great though.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails alone.  My Manhattan was perfect, and my friend got a Cosmopolitan that she really liked.\n\nOverall, there are so many GREAT places to eat in the city, I wouldn't go back here again unless my other options weren't available.", "author": "Jessica B."}

I didn't know any better, so I ate the soup when it arrived before the entree (Cream of corn... too sweet and heavy. Ug). I realized the mistake when my entree arrived - panini, salad, and... another cup of soup? Nonono, I had to ask the server to remove the bowl of soup from our bill. \n\nFrom then on, the meal was tainted. The panini was overly greasy, and the salad had an unappetizing bitter dressing on it so I didn't eat it. Overall, I only ate half of the bowl of soup, and the panini.

It's southern comfort food combined with fresh, modern cuisine in a great dining space.  Formerly an old ship manufacturing co., the restaurant is warm and inviting with brick walls and soft lighting and chic chandeliers. The restaurant borders between casual and elegant and has a very relaxed vibe.  There is plenty of street parking outside the restaurant, which is a rarity in san francisco!\n\nAs us 4 girls entered for our 8:45 reservation (yes, I couldn't get one earlier), I realized that perhaps the red dress and oversized black clutch I had with me were perhaps too dressy for fried chicken, but the sophistication of the restaurant was just at the right level to give a gal an excuse to get dressed up!\n\n We arrived a bit early hoping they could seat us earlier and were accomodated so by the friendly front staff who sat us about 20 min's earlier.  \n\nAppetizers we ordered included cornmeal fried oysters with spinach puree and bacon, buttermilk biscutis with country ham and peaches, and yellowtail sashimi with melon. For an entree I ordered trout stuffed with crab and also tried the buttermilk fried chicken with gravy and mash potatoes and the scallop dish my friends had ordered. Everything was delicious and we found ourselves finishing every bite on the plates. \n\nMy top picks of must orders:\n\nAPPETIZERS: The buttermilk biscuits with the country ham and peach compote. The biscuits were too die for and the prosciutto style ham is an interesting pairing, but worked well.\n\nENTREE:  Buttermilk Fried chicken with mash potatoes and gravy. It was crispy without being oily and was perfectly cooked.\n\nOverall, the staff was friendly and helpful. We were dining with a friend who was gluten intolerant and they were able to make some suggestions and check with the chef on ingredients. \n\nSome negatives:\n\nThe service was a bit slow on the night we went. It took about 40 min's for our main dishes to arrive after the appetizers. \n\nThe bar area is great, but it's small and if you arrive late you won't find a seat. The restaurant itself gets very crowded and crammed. We learned this the hard way.\n\nThe acoustics are incredibly loud. It's great for groups, but a bit loud for intimate conversations.\n\nOverall, great place, great food and great atmosphere. It's worth the reservation.", "author": "Laura L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-11-10", "description": "I made an online reservation at Town Hall in SOMA - a place I had been to once or twice before but only for lunch. My memories were fond (especially as they centered around butterscotch pudding) and I knew S had never been so I was really looking forward to being wow'd once again by the great culinary workings of the kitchen staff. Unfortunately, we were wow'd but not in a positive way. We should have seen the foreshadowing on the wall with our first encounter with the restaurant as it wasn't a necessarily positive one.\n\nOur reservation was at 6pm and traffic through the city was heavier than we expected (Fleet week plus the Blue Angles makes for heavy congestion). I decide perhaps we should call the restaurant to let them know that we may be a few minutes late (I'm Ms. Punctuality, can you tell?). It was maybe 5:50 at this point and my guess was that we were probably going to get there at ten after - at the latest. S calls (as a courtesy I'm sure because many people don't call when running late) and is told by the hostess that we better get there before 6:15 or they'll give our table away. Ok - I'm really excited to spend a lot of money at your restaurant with that lovely precursor.\n\nWe arrive (at 6:08) and are brought to our table. The restaurant is really very lovely - very American, very SOMA, very quirky, nice. Lots of wood accents, brick walls, hardwood floors which are beautiful but which also make it difficult to hear the person sitting across from you. I digress. I love the atmosphere - it's hip yet comfortable and even the pipe jutting out of the wall directly to my right only added to the loft-like vibe happening at Town Hall. S and I look over the menu and what strikes us is how every single starter looks amazing and yet none of the main entrees is catching either of our sets of eyes. Is it possible one could craft an entire meal from appetizers alone? If I had had it my way, we would have but in the interest of being civilized we decided to share two starters and then we'd each order a entr\u00e9e. We choose the barbecue shrimp dish which sounded a lot like the shrimp recipe that's one of my favorite dishes of all times and the vermouth, blue cheese fondue.\n\nAt this point in our dining experience, all was going well except that after our waiter dropped off our drinks we didn't see him for a good 25 minutes (we hadn't even placed our starter orders yet). I overlooked this as I was just happy sitting and talking with S but still - 25 minutes! He returns, we place our orders and very shortly thereafter out come our starters.\n\nNext out came our entrees and I was excited. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and bacon gravy. S ordered the seafood etoufee and it all looked sublime. I dove right into my dish and was immediately stopped short by iodine shock I received from my first bite of crisp, chicken skin. I tried it once more thinking I had probably just eaten an \"off\" piece but again I was shocked by the levels of salt. I started thinking that my taste buds were off kilter so I asked S to try. He did and couldn't finish the piece I had given him. I tried the skin on the other pieces on my plate and they were fine so I was happy to push the offending piece aside and try again. This time, I wasted no time with the skin and cut right into the chicken thigh. My fork and knife seemed to penetrate the chicken a little too easily so I look a little closer. Wouldn't you know my chicken was raw. Not pink, not rare, but raw. Apparently it was cooked to perfection on the outside but not on the inside which is quite easy to do with fried chicken especially as a novice home chef. Not quite what one would expect at a fine dining establishment. We called the waiter over, he rushed the dish away and 20 minutes later, long after S had finished his dinner, my chicken arrived with a bit of a scolding from our waiter. He let me know that usually chicken is a little pink near the bone. Oh really? That I could handle. What I can't handle is pink far from the bone. A tell tale sign that the meat hadn't been cooked!\n\nWe ordered dessert next. S ordered the Mud Pie and I ordered \"San Francisco's Best Hot Chocolate.\" We also ordered a butterscotch pudding to go for S's sister who was watching T and a glass or port for S to enjoy with his chocolate concoction. When they brought out our desserts all looked fine but fine it was not. Mine was essentially room temperature and so rich that it was undrinkable - almost like a runny pudding, but not quite. S found part of the port label floating in his glass and it was then we surrendered. Tonight was just not going to be our night. When we got the bill, the waiter let us know he \"took a couple things off for us\" which included the port and butterscotch pudding (one of the only things that was fine).\n\nAll in all, I loved having two, wonderful uninterrupted hours with S but having to pay nearly $200 for mediocrity at best is not high on my list.", "author": "Erin H."}

I ordered the short ribs for my entree and I was surprised when the waiter brought me a steak knife before my entree arrived.  Guess what though, I needed it.  The short ribs arrived at about the same temperature as the oysters and they were over cooked, dry, and tough.  Properly cooked short ribs should be fork tender and these required a steak knife - enough said.  I had the pot de creme for desert and it was very good.

I tend to take my out of town friends here for dinner, and love popping in for lunch when I'm playing hooky (or one of my three hour lunch breaks) from work. I have to say that  the last time was one of the best experiences I've ever had at a San Francisco restaurant. \n\nFirst, atmosphere is killer. You can sit at the communal table if you want, but I prefer to a comfy table towards the back, or plop on a barstool sippin; on a Woodford Reserve Manhatten. The clientele is great here, it's trendy and San Francisco for sure, but it's a lot of more down to Earth people in jeans and H&M shirts. I wish it was slightly darker inside, but that's a personal preference, doesn't really hurt.\n\nThe service is an A+++++ every time. I forget our waitresses name, but she was friendly outgoing, talked to the sommelier about my wine choice and helped me pick a great bottle of Two Hands from Australia. They know the menu, they make great recommendations and for a restaurant of this high caliber they are super unpretentious and make you feel right at home as you blow 300  bucks. Their sister restaurant The Salt House, which is OK, should take a service cue from Town Hall because them and ISA have the best service in the city.\n\nOK,OK, you are going here for the food and the wine, and both are just resplendent. The tuna Tartar is the best I've ever had, and the veal meatballs are not to be missed. I had the halibut last time and is was to die for, my date had the slow roasted duck and it was so succulent I was overly impressed. They also do a good ol' fashioned fried chicken, which is just heavenly. The wine list is well thought out, and is more in line with new world wines. I tend to drink Aussie, New Zealand and Santa  Lucia wines from here., though they do have some good Burgundies. \n\nAll in all this truly is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco, and if you read my reviews I'm a food snob. Highly, highly recommended!!!!", "author": "Steve l."}

Lofted ceilings, brick interior, hardwood floors, white wood walls, slightly worn to give a softer feel.\n\nThe menu seems California Classic with a slightly French touch.  They offered a wide selection of meat dishes, several seafood dishes, and a Vegetarian risotto.  I opted for the Vegetarian risotto, which very well may have been the greatest risotto I've ever had in my life.  Truffle oil, yes please!\n\nWe started with a mix of the fresh raw oysters and shared the BBQ'd shrimp w/ Worchestershire sauce and garlic herb toast as an appetizer.  The description sounded intense, but man...was that sauce awesome!  I had to hold back from polishing off the fresh baked bread they give for the table just to mop up the rest of the sauce.  \n\nThe wine list is extensive enough to give you plenty of options, but isn't overwhelming.  \n\nThe service was really fantastic!  Our server was clearly a professional.  Incredibly friendly, attentive, great timing, and made sure that all the glasses were filled with wine and water before you could even give it a 2nd thought.\n\nThe menu and prices overall are about $20-$28/entree.

We had never gone to the restaurant before, but stumbled upon it one day while touring various possible wedding venue sites in San Francisco.  We instantly fell in love with the d\u00e9cor and overall vibe of the place.  The next step, of course, was to sample their food, and it did not disappoint.  Their pork risotto was so simple, homey, and delicious that it literally brought a man tear to my husband's eye.  When they said we could have a whole pig roast for our reception dinner, it pretty much sealed the deal.  Those of you who are currently or have ever planned a wedding know how stressful such an undertaking can be.  I think one of the best wedding advice we can give having just gone through the process ourselves is this: liking your vendors and getting along with them makes a world of difference!  Fortunately Marissa, Town Hall's event coordinator, was a pleasure to work with.  She is incredibly friendly, patient, responsive, and professional.  She worked great with our wedding coordinator, and together, they made sure that our event was executed perfectly.  All of Town Hall's staff is top notch.

Service was prompt, friendly and good, (it's nice that they refold your napkins when you leave the table), but the quality of the food is the real stand-out.  The starters, particularly the ham & cheese \"sandwich\", were absolutely fantastic, though you should know they are a bit rich and - for us - a bit too generous.  The mains were equally impressive.  My trout was cooked to perfection, and very delicious, and the fried chicken was another stand-out.  Deserts were creative and yummy.  In short, we had a really excellent meal.\n\nHaving said that . . . and this is completely subjective . . . I didn't much care for the room itself.  The entry, through some kind of an outdoor tent area, was weird.  Then, you had to fight your way through a crowded, narrow bar area, to get into the dining room, which was really just a large, sparse space with heavy wooden tables and no tablecloths.  I get the hip \"bistro\" vibe . . . it just didn't appeal to me, particularly at this price point.\n\nA few minor nits, too.  Service had a \"process\" feel to it.  For example, we intentionally delayed ordering so that we could enjoy cocktails at the table first and catch up with our friends.  The bus station was near our table and we could see the bus person waiting to bring bread to our table, which would have been nice with our drinks, but their process clearly says that bread is not served until after you order.  Sure enough, the minute we placed our dinner order, wham . . . the bread finally appeared.  Another item . . . there is a standing ashtray just outside the front door.  It was overflowing with fast-food cups and banana peels, which no one bothered to clean . . . As your first impression, it was a bit trashy.

Our waiter was fantastic, attentive, and went above and beyond to make us happy.  When I asked for a specific bottle of wine, he suggested I try it first as it likely wouldn't be what I expected.  After the taste I agreed and ordered his recommendation, which was much better.  For dessert, I had hoped for a madeira that would pair perfectly with the toffee cake, and though it wasn't on the menu he was able to find some for me.

The reason why is pretty obvious - consistency.\n\nI recommend Town Hall as a great spot to gather before hitting the bars and nightclubs in SoMa.  The drinks are amazing, the mood is convivial, and the atmosphere is vibrant.  Although, take that recommendation with a grain of salt.  A big one, in fact.  Because the entrees can be fairly substantive and it can, at times, be difficult to drink copious amounts of booze with a belly full of buttermilk fried chicken, short ribs, etc.\n\nMy favorite dish on the menu, though, is the slow-roasted duck.

The Kielbasa was on a hard roll with sweet peppers.  While tasty, the Kielbasa should be spicier to counterbalance the sweetness of the peppers.   Love the fact that it's homemade and the casing bits really easily, a hot kaiser bun would be great, but the grease from the sausage soften the roll.  As for the potato salad, just average!  I can tell they mixed in either BBQ sauce or some grease from the sausage to give it the color, I was surprised to see green onion and red onion mixed together, the green onion did nothing for it.

Overall, the decor is very rustic and the food is very hearty.  Service is generally pretty good but it tends to be very slow in getting the food out.  The items I like are:\n1) The burger - great burger but a little pricier than most.  French fries make it worthwhile but not the best burger I've ever had.\n2) The fried chicken plate - Just the right amount of crust and very juicy meat.  I'm from Texas and this is probably in the top 15 which is saying alot.\n3) The tuna tartare appetizer - comes with Fried tomato slices.  Very southern and surprisingly spicy in a good way.\n4) Seafood chowder - Wow, not too creamy but full of delicious seafood and great flavor\n5) Ham sandwich with poached egg on top - Okay waaaaay decadent.  They literally pour a cup of cream on top of your sandwich.  So if you can get over the heart-clogging thoughts, enjoy that creamy jalapeno goodness!\n6) Pot de Creme - Their signature, top things to eat in SF dessert.  I don't even like Pot de creme in general but this was pretty good especially with the pieces of butterscotch stuck in there\n7) The chocolate dessert with almonds is my favorite by far!\n\nA few things to note are that their dine about town menus are decent and usually include the Pot de Creme but I usually just end up ordering off of the usual menu.  Also during this period the service is RIDICULOUSLY slow.\n\nIf you are thinking about this place for an after work happy hour, I would discourage it because there are absolutely no nibblies offered during this period.  The manager wouldnt' even let us order appetizers off the main menu for some reason.\n\nOther than that, usually not difficult to make a last minute reservation at this place given the large size and parking during dinner is extremely easy but expect to pay at least $50-$100 per person.

We apparently got them on a bad night. :) The first three courses were great - oysters were in the top 2 I've ever had, appetizers and salad were both extremely fresh and tasty. Somehow after that...things got bad. In retrospect, it was a combination of the server and the kitchen. I asked for a bit of a break between appetizers and entree. Server said he would wait 5 minutes to place order...then it would be 15 minutes. Perfect. 20 minutes came and went. Another 10 with limited information. About 40 minutes into it, we got our food. \n\nMy wife had the lamb (perfectly done) and I was handed a medium rare New York steak - bad news is I ordered medium. Immediately sent it back. 10 minutes later got the same thing back only drier and browner. Sent it back for new. BTW, it was sliced - and was not expecting that. Another LONG time before I finally got a version that was still not right but at that point, when asked if it was better I just said no but that I was hungry and wanted to eat. Pathetic for a place with this reputation. Server blamed the kitchen - which should have been my clue - but as it was a birthday celebration and we had already decanted an Opus, hard to dash! :)\n\nEveryone was nice but kinda missed the point. Manager told me at end of dinner that she wouldn't order the New York steak - at which point I asked 'why is it on the menu?' \n\nThere are too many good food places in SF and elsewhere to have this on my 'go back to' list. Unfortunate because I'm sure it's good ALL the other times. This is my buyer beware caution to you all if you're planning to try this for a first time. If you want GREAT food and service, this did not stand up to what is expected at a highly-regarded restaurant. \n\nGood luck.", "author": "Patrick G."}

The statements and opinions expressed herein are those of the authors only, and not their beloved spouses, who may or may not agree.\n\nBen sez:\n\nWe picked Town Hall because the Chronicle had it on its list of the Top 100 Restaurants, and TH had availability on the day we wanted to go out and eat.  Because dinner was recently, it was hella raining when we visited (and yes, I'm over 30, and yes, I said hella, and yes, you can kiss my black ass, and yes, I'm not black).  The interior was bright and shining and welcoming and WARM (I'm stunned how many restaurants in the city are cold when the weather is cold---if you can't keep a restaurant warm, you're doing something wrong).  We were early, indeed, we showed up before the dining room officially opened, yet we were greeted and shown to our seats.  No coat check, which is one of several things keeping this from being a 5-star review.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: 5-star restaurants take your coat and bag.  I won't 5-star a place that doesn't.  Sorry, but you're on notice (Colbert-style).\n\nOur waitress was really nice, friendly, helpful, and prompt.  Very knowledgeable about the food (I got a 30 second lesson on the awesomeness of my quail), and the wine.  Really, one of the nicer waiters/waitresses I've encountered in SF.\n\nWe shared an appetizer of buttermilk biscuits and ham.  The biscuits were a little too doughy for me, but the ham was wonderful.\n\nI had the quail, as previously alluded.  The quail was stuffed, which is a bit surprising in and of itself (quail is usually considered by restaurants to be too small to stuff).  The stuffing was good (tiny minced carrots abounded).  The quail was entirely decent, not transcendent.\n\nFor dessert, I had the apple pie.  SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: THE APPLE PIE DESSERT WILL FEED 4 PEOPLE.  This is the one ball our waitress dropped.  This dessert is freaking huge.  It was wonderful, but huge.  I asked for extra ice cream, which was necessary: extra only meant 2 scoops, which was barely enough for me to eat half the pie.\n\nSo, my bottom line: very good, great service, solidly 4 stars.\n\nWifey sez:\n\nWow.  I actually get to type my own answer instead of having it transcribed for me.\n\nAnyway.....Yes the ham was tasty, but the appetizer was barely big enough to share.  Personally I thought the biscuits were tasty too -- I like doughy biscuits.\n\nMy entree was a pork chop the size of a grapefruit.  And almost as round.  It was crusted with a peanut sauce of some sort -- good, but almost too many flavors were present.  It had a spicy, make-your-gums-tingle sorta kick to it that caught up with you after the first couple of bites.  Accompanying it was some patty pan squash and apples.  With the spicy chop, I would have liked more apple than squash, but overall I was pleased.\n\nDessert....Key Lime pie.  Mmmmmm....Key Lime pie.  It was tangy and tart (and delightful).  Like the apple pie, it was quite large -- easily a two-person dessert.  Somehow, through the pain and guilt, I was able to eat most of it.", "author": "Ben P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-09-16", "description": "Last night while in SF visiting friends we went to eat at Town Hall.  I was told ahead of time that we were coming here so  I looked it up on Yelp.  After seeing the pictures I understood why it is called \"Town Hall\", but I didn't truly absorb it until I got there.  It has this old time feel that seemed sorta like you were in an old school or converted barn, but with an up-to-date trendier feel.  i can't quite explain it with the right words.  You just have to go and look.  And they also bring you the bill in a very old book/novel, which added to the ambiance.  \n\nOur reservations were at 9pm and we were promptly seated, but we didn't finish eating until  11:15pm.  That was partly due to the fact that one of the friends didn't show up until about 20-30 minutes later and we waited for him before we ordered.  The other part was because it took probably 45 minutes to receive our main course after finishing our appetizers.  That is the only thing I would complain about, but my friends who have eaten here many times said it was not normal.  Besides that, our waiter was very attentive and even took my friend's shirt to soak after my friend bit into his fried chicken and grease squirt all over his $200 shirt.  The manager even came by to tell my friend to send the dry cleaning bill to him, which was very nice.  \n\nWe started with 2 appetizers, which were AMAZING.  The first was the Heirloom Tomato salad with feta cheese and two sprigs of watercress in a buttermilk garlic dressing.  The tomatoes were SO sweet and they melted in your mouth.  I kept eating bread just to sop up the dressing, which had a bit of a zing to it because of the garlic.  Our 2nd appetizer was the Faith's Warm Ham and Cheese Toast, served with a poached egg on top in a jalapeno cream sauce.  We cut it in fours and all let out groans of pure and utter satisfaction once the first bite hit our mouths.  The jalapeno cream sauce definitely had a bite to it, but it's not so spicey that you can't enjoy it.  I like food with strong flavors and these two appetizers definitely captured it. \n\nFor our main courses, 3 of us ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, which came with white corn, cherry tomatoes, biscuits and gravy.  This was clearly NOT the night to start dieting!  And even though my friend got chicken grease on his shirt after biting into the chicken leg, I did not and nor did his girlfriend. You get 3 pieces of friend chicken, which is more than enough, as I did not finish my 3rd piece.  You get dark and white meat, but I prefer dark anyway. The 4th person ordered the Chimay Braised Short Ribs, which I did not try, but he loved it, as did my other two friends who tried a piece.  \n\nWhile the appetizers were unbelieavable and the main courses were fantastic, NOTHING compares to my NEW favorite dessert!!!! OMFG!!!  The Butterscotch  Pot de Creme is soooooooooo DAMN good that I have to curse and say it's FUCKING ORGASMIC!  It was a mix of white and chocolatey type mousse and normally I don't like white chocolate.  And out of the bowl was what I can only assume was homemade butterscotch pieces sticking out of it.  It was very sweet, but left a little salty taste in your mouth.  I am drooling while writing about it....literally Pavlov's Dog here!!!  I dreamt of it last night and I will dream of it tonight and tomorrow night and the night after that.  I would fly to SF just to have this dessert and nothing else.  I will beg them to send it overnight to me in LA!  I will pay whatever price!  I must have it!!!  Have I made my point clear on this dessert, yet?!  I could hate everything else I ate here (which I didn't) and I would still give this place 4 stars, simply because of this dessert alone!  It was love at first bite!

You know, at the table one table removed from him.  Peg S. spotted him and queried in her sultry Dorothy Parker, \"Hey, isn't that Conan O'Brien?\"   To which, I had to ask my friend Anita, frantically, head a-bobbing, \"Where?!!!  Where????\"  And the sea of obtrusive heads parted; and there He was.  Oh, Conan.\n\nDown to the yelp:  They pack this place in like it's a town hall or something:  tables everywhere.  Our hostess was very accommodating (hmmm.. imagine that.. for a hostess) and seated us fairly quickly.  We ended up at the large table in the back (party of 9) near the kitchen (boo), which was drafty for some reason.  The person who took down my initial reservation was acommodating as well.  And after negotiating with a bunch of other places to seat a party of (initially) 10, I was pleasantly surprised that Town Hall was able to do it.\n\nSavories here are De-Lish!  I stuck my fork in pretty much everything that everyone else had.  I had the ham and cheese toast w/ poached egg and jalapeno cream with bits of breaded, fried okra(?) and the apple beignets with prosciutto(?).  The beignets were fluffy, not greasy, and not overly sweet -- complimented the tasty prosciutto well.  The Ham and Cheese toast was my favorite -- the jalapeno cream was spicy and complimented the ham & cheese toast well.  ***** for creativity in the kitchen, particularly with this genre of food, blending unexpected flavors into a sincerely pleasurable experience.  Ah yes, the fondue was good as well.\n\nSecond course:  The pork chop was succulent and tender.  Its pumpkin side was savory and sweet.  The jambalaya was also good.  I also tried the fried chicken w/ biscuits and gravy and brussel sprouts -- so much chicken.  Gemini g. made a valiant effort to finish the chicken.  I was impressed.  For a tiny little thing, she made some serious headway.  The chicken was moist and the breading tasty.  While the mini biscuits were tasty, for some reason they were cold.  Gemini g. commented, \"The coldness detracts from the yummyness.\"  Gemini g. is wise and well-versed in the use of -ness words.  I contemplated getting the lobster and rabbit pot pie.  To which, sis whispered in her pictionary voice, \"(but do you like rabbit?)\"  I declared, \"I'm getting two appetizers!\"\n\nDrinks, we tried the samba and something else that I can't remem the name of. But both were good, too.\n\nDessert:  For the love of god, get the Butterscotch chocolate pot de creme.  Served in a giant bowl with butterscotch-chocolate brittle, this pot de creme circulated our table as we greedily spooned in yummy mouthful after mouthful moaning culinary ecstasy.  SPOILER: For the love of god, do NOT get the hot chocolate or the devil's food cake.  I understand that there are some chocolate fiends out there, but this hot choc was too much.  The consistency was more like choc. fondue.  The ginger cookie that came with it was good tho.  The cake was REALLY disappointing.  The look of it was fabulous.  But it tasted and felt like chalk.  Strike that, refrigerated chalk.  But it looked so good, with its layers of chocolate cake and chocolate frosting.  It beckoned.  So we ate it.  It was like that bad date you keep going back to that initially looks so good and perfect.  You think, \"It can't be THAT bad.\"  Oh, but it is:  It's dry, stale, crumbly and day-old.  But you keep going back for more.  And after you've coughed up yet another dry mouthful, you think, \"Never again\" . . .  as you reach for another forkful.  *sigh*.  We also had the pumpkin cheesecake -- not really sweet for you sweet fans and custardy / eggy texture and flavor.\n\nRECAP:  WE SAW CONAN O'BRIEN.  No one can take that away from me.

So when Jacey and I wanted to go to dinner - we decided upon this place and frankly, I was excited to try it out.\n\nA multitude of things went wrong.\n\nFirst -  we ordered wine.\nThe first bottle was a 94 Campillo Tempranillo - - $100+, can't remember how much exactly.  I think it was 125.  But the wine was 13 years old, and this was a good night, happy occasion - so I figured why not, especially since I forgot to bring a bottle of wine that I had wanted Jacey to try.  They decanted it upon bringing it to the table - and I tasted it, and something about it was not right.  I thought I'd let it breathe for a bit, but after some 15 minutes - - it tasted even more off.  I never, ever do this - but for the first time, I decided to return the wine and order something else.\n\nNow here is where things went sour.\nI was on the phone when the server came by - and JC tells her that this wine is not good.  The server asked if it was bad, or not good. (???)  JC answered that it was bad.  The server then takes the bottle and says she will go to the back and try it.  Now, I could care less if she chugged the whole thing - but if the customer tells you it's no good, then take it as that and offer something new - - her tasting it and then claiming it as superb is not going to make what we think is a wine-gone-bad into a great wine.  It just won't.  If we were people wanting to get more wine after downing 3/4 of the bottle, I get it.  Butwwe're barely able to finish one glass of wine each - - and we gave it a chance, and STILL, it sucked.  So then the sommelier comes over - - and tells us the wine is fine.  \"That's nice, I still don't like it,\" I tell him.\nNow, I won't knock the sommelier - - he informed us that wines from the Campillo winery simply taste like this, and so forth, while offering to exchange for us but recommending a different choice, some Spanish wine.  Coincidentally, that was what I had wanted - - but the server had told me that if it's a Rioja that I want, I best go with the 13 year old Rioja rather than that Spanish wine, which was my first choice.  He brought it out, decanted again -  and this one, we accepted.  It was alright - - but nothing anywhere near the caliber of wines I have at my house, costing 1/10th the price.  \nOH WELL, bad wine night.\n\nSecond, we ordered food.\nI'll say - the bread was good, the butter was good.\nThe beet salad we ordered had really good beets, but to get any flavor at all - - - we had to pour the salt on.  After eating about half, I look at Jacey and ask, \"WTF, is this bland or is it me?\"  She starts cracking up and we went nuts w/ the salt.  Ahhh... better.\nThe tuna tartare appetizer..... bland again, no appeal, and just nothing remotely memorable about it!  It came with some fried tomatoes that tasted like fried squash or something.... also bland.  \"GIMME THE SALT\".....\n\n\nThen came our entrees.  Jacey could not pick one to save her life - so she ended up ordering the second of the two choices I had been pondering, which was scallops.  I ordered the ribeye, medium-rare ($34?).  The steak was good - it was cooked exactly as requested, but accompanying it were really soggy tater-tot type of things, and string beans -  and this great hunk of meat was drowning in the sauce that accompanied it.  The sauce on its own was tasty, but the steak soooo did not need it.  What did strike me was that unlike the appetizers - -  this was nearing the point of being salty!  Hence, it had more flavor, and it was a good cut of meat w/ great marbling and very little CHUNKS of fat - - but I noted the inconsistency.  \nThe scallops.....\nWell, for some $28 (?), call me silly but I expect either really large scallops - - or if it's the average scallop size you're offering (which they are) - - give enough to make the person eating it not gawk.  THREE SCALLOPS with a mass of a barley concoction?  NO.  NO, NO, NO.\n\nTurned off.\n\nThird - dessert.\nNow WHY would we bother ordering dessert?  \nDon't be silly.............  I know how to take a hint.

Both Gracie unni & i DID NOT appreciate the first one, and told the server that it was \"bad.\" I'll be honest with you, both Gracie unni & I were very much upset when the server took the wine with her, stating that she was going to test the wine and come back. I have to say, if a customer does not appreciate it, you simply take it back, no questions, no buts whatsoever. So, let's say the server DID like it, in fact, the manager came back saying that was how it was supposed to taste like. given that, we are not happy campers, everyone's taste buds are different, so who gives if you like it and we didn't? ahn gurae unni? We're not difficult people, i'm sure you would the same... \n\nwe shared a tuna tartare $14 (fried green tomatos, garlic chips & tabasco green vinagrette) i give 3. nothing awesome.. edible to say the very least ...\n\nwe also shared the roasted baby beets which was arugula, goat cheese, and sliced apricots for $10 ... sry town hall, i give 1. not your everyday treat...

I accepted the invitation under the pretense that I'd get to air my waxing list of grievances (in true Festivus fashion) to that popinjay Mayor Gavin Newsom.  Lord Mayor, the homeless situation in San Francisco is egregious and unconscionable, as are the astronomical housing prices.  Don't even get me started, Your Eminence, on our fair city's public transportation system.  Yes, sir, we're going to Town Hall, for the time for rebellion is nigh!  What a glorious coup we'll stage (a la the Pakistani or Thai system of government), and when the dust settles and the beer bottles are cleaned up, we can look upon our shiny new Utopia with the sense of satisfaction earned from a job well done!\n\nWait, what do you mean \"City Hall\"?  A restaurant?\n\nSumumma bitch.\n\nMy dissatisfaction with municipal politics notwithstanding, Town Hall was a fantastic dining experience.  The service was efficient and friendly, the decor rustic yet chic.  The food was excellent by all measures.  Beware, vegetarians: there is little on the menu you can enjoy (without feeling as though you've betrayed your sacred covenant with Shiva), but even these few dishes were quite delicious.  The wild mushroom risotto was incredibly savory and flavorful, though perhaps was steeped a tad too long in truffle oil.  The jalapeno corn bread really is all that (cum bag of chips).  Delightfully light and sweet, with a hint of fresh, crispy jalapeno flavor.  The butter lettuce salad was also worthy of note, drizzled with the right amount of sacre bleu cheese dressing and adorned with walnuts and apple slices.  Save room for the Sticky Toffee Cake (a.k.a. Rejoice For I Am Now Inside Your Mouth), truly a masterfully wrought dessert forged from both the beautiful and the sublime.\n\nPerhaps as San Francisco grows, Town Hall will graduate into a full-fledged City Hall, where one might be able to influence policy on the Peninsula a bit more efficiently.  Until then, good eats abound at this gourmet southern food establishment.", "author": "Rajiv B."}

The place is definately pretty cool and reasonably fancy, though not too much so.  We had an open bar, and they were quite generous with the mixing.  And service was quite good.\nBut the food disappointed.  The salad was nice (with crumbly goat cheese and thin slices of persimmon).  But the salmon I had for the main course was not very flavorful (and thus probably farmed) and just a hint on the fishy side, indicating that it wasn't terribly fresh.  And with a restaurant that's supposed to be high end, serving fish that isn't fresh really shouldn't happen.  The roast was good, tender, and nicely medium rare, but the potato & bacon croquettes which accompanied it seemed distinctly lacking in the bacon department, and were virtually indistinguishable from ordinary tater tots, which was a disappointment to everyone who got them.\n\nAnyway, I'd like to return for a normal, non-large-group dinner on the assumption that they can improve on these issues.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-27", "description": "It had been some time since I'd visited Town Hall, while my boyfriend had never been. My past visits had been impromptu and had always taken place on their heated outdoor patio. The food had always been good, and the service efficient and friendly - that is, from what I could remember, as it had been many months since my last visit.\n\nWe arrived about 10 minutes early for our 8:15 reservation - we weren't seated until after 8:30 as the party before us continued to linger well after paying their check. I ultimately recognize situations like this are beyond the restaurant's control, so while not ideal I certainly didn't start off with a bad impression.\n\nBad impressions, however, started to form after sitting down.\n\nOur waiter stopped by and asked if we wanted water while we looked over the menu - he returned about 5 minutes later with water and informed us they were out of a couple of items. My bf and I then needed a little bit of extra time deciding. When he returned we had a couple of questions: we asked for a recommendation between a couple of starters, asked what the substitution would be for one of the main courses as they were out of one of the items, and I asked about the preparation of one of the mains. Upon being asked the third question the waiter somewhat huffed and rolled his eyes: I tried to play it down as a non-issue, as I had prefaced the questions with \"I'm going to be a pain for a moment\" in a friendly way. I initially took his response as just sarcasm. As for drinks, the bf and I have been drinking a lot of wine lately, so we decided to skip alcohol for the evening: he stuck with water, I had an iced tea.\n\nWe ended up ordering the following:\n\nFaith's warm Smithfield ham and cheese toast with poached egg and jalapeno cream (shared)\n\nTuna tartare with fried green tomatoes, garlic chips, and green onion Tabasco vinaigrette (shared)\n\nFried buttermilk chicken with snap peas, mashed Yukon Gold potatoes, and bacon gravy (mine)\n\nStuffed pork chop with sun-dried tomatoes, fontina and mozzarella, dirty rice and bitter greens (bf's)\n\nThe food was \"good,\" not great. The ham and cheese toast was very good, just as I remembered it. I did use extra bread to soak up the cream. It was probably the best item we ordered. The tartare was decent: the flavors pleasant, the fish very fresh... however it was fairly boring in overall complexity. The fried chicken was very moist, though the skin wasn't nearly as crispy as I like (and was a bit on the greasy side). The sides were particularly skimpy, however the snap peas were perfectly cooked and the potatoes/gravy tasty. I tried the bf's pork chop: it was cooked to medium, moist and tender. He liked it, though wasn't particularly impressed.\n\nFood, overall, was good - I'd give it 2 - 2.5 stars ala Bauer's scale.\n\nThe service, however, was another story. After we placed our order we didn't see our waiter again until after we were done eating. The host brought out the appetizers - the busser essentially barked \"Are you done?\" before taking our plates. The mains were plopped in front of us - no one ever came by to ask how things were or whether or not we needed anything else. We sat with empty plates in front of us for quite some time. The waiter finally came by after the plates were cleared to present us with dessert menus: we'd already decided that we didn't care to remain through dessert.\n\nMind you, the restaurant was busy, though no more busy than usual. I frankly think the waiter \"sized us up\" after we asked questions/didn't order drinks and probably thought he could maximize his tip pull from other tables - so he ignored us.\n\nThe tab came to $94, including tax and tip. The tip, mind you, was just barely 15% - this was the first time in a VERY long time I considered leaving less. I typically leave 20-25% (or sometimes more for impeccable service). I'd probably give the service 1 star.\n\nThis was disappointing for me: I really enjoy Town Hall's younger sister, Salt House. It looks like I'll simply take my business there instead.", "author": "Jesse H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-18", "description": "Just driving by Town Hall in the early evening, glowing warm light glittering through the big brick box on the corner, makes you want to go inside. I'd felt like the last of my friends to make it here, so when my mom offered to take my friend, Jersey Pride Molly and I out to dinner, I instantly knew. \nTown Hall. \nMolly and I met early at the bar, opening a tab and sipping glasses of wine. \n\"Okay, Molls.\" I said. I've been neglecting Yelp, so I'll be writing a review. I'll need observations.\"\n\"Like that bird on the lamp?\"\nShe pointed to what appeared to be a stuffed small bird emerging from a table lamp behind the bar.\n\"Yes. Like that bird on the lamp.\"\nLooking around, the space was cool. High ceilings, chic art, snazzy folks. \n\"We don't have this in Trenton.\" Molly said. \"I mean, look at the lighting.\"\nOverhead hung a series of \"chandeliers\" looking very much like the fixtures Julia Roberts created in The Runaway Bride. (Like you haven't watched The Runaway Bride.)\nMom soon joined us, and we were immediately seated as soon as mom paid our bar tab, presented in a hardcover, vintage-y book entitled \"The Three Passions\" which we like to think applied to us. \nIt took a little while for anyone to come over and bring us water and offer us (more) drinks, but once he did it didn't matter. I don't know his name and I have no idea what shifts he works, but you will know him when you see him. \nDing Dong. \nWe ordered 2 starters to share, the veal meatballs and the sweet onion fondue. The meatballs, which my mom had somehow read about, were spectacular. The fondue, on the other hand, was really weird. We were given bland potatoes, dry sausage and broccolini to dip in a thin but great tasting sauce. \nEh. Pass the meatballs. \nMolly excused herself to the ladies room and returned. \n\"Alright, Spots.\" She Jersey-accented me as she sat down. \"I've got a comment for your big Yalk review. Getting to the bathroom is weird. It's all warm and cozy and cool in the restaurant, and then you've got to walk into some office building with fluorescent lighting and wall to wall carpeting to get to the bathroom. It ruins the vibe real fucking fast.\"\nI later learned she was right. The bathroom experience, in my twisted mind, speaks volumes about an establishment. Not only do you walk into some office space, you swing right past the \"private\" room, across the blinding white hall from the ladies. So, in addition to my eyes having to adjust, 35 people at a private party got to know that I had to pee at 8:42pm last night. \nNote to self: easily crash-able party upstairs. \nDinner was great, although I only tasted mine. I had the lamb, which comes two ways. Either I'm dense (highly possible) or the menu doesn't make that appallingly clear. It was spectacular though, and came with a goat cheese potato gratin. \nHey gorgeous, keep that Pinot coming. \nAs we ordered dessert, splitting the apple crisp, mom leaned across the table. \"Beth, you are flirting with that waiter.\"\n\"No shit, mother. Look at him.\"\n\"Well,\" she coyly replied. \"His hair IS fabulous.\"\nMolly and I looked at each other and responded in unison, \"It's his ACCENT.\"\nCheers to that.\nThe crisp was great, although stuffed, I sipped my coffee and observed mom pay the bill, which arrived in another old book, this time a tattered cookbook. Lingering in the fabulous ambiance, we flipped the pages to find the equivalent of a dive bar bathroom wall, phone numbers and poems, praise and complaints, gorgeous doodles and dirty pictures. \nI grabbed mom's pen. \nFind the right book at Town Hall, folks, and you'll find not only my thoughts on the disarming ladies room experience, you'll also find a new phone number...", "author": "Beth S."}

Having watched a re-run of Check Please last week that featured Town Hall and all 3 guests agreed to a unanimous thumbs up, I coaxed my co-workers into eating here for lunch today... even though I knew it was probably a bit upscale to expense. \n\nWith no reservations, we were offered either the communal table or the bar. We chose the bar where I was able to sit on the side corner which I was pleased with since it allowed me to still be able to make good eye contact with both other members of my party. I ordered the soup of the day and the frisee salad w/arugula and blood oranges. I think soup is usually a good test of a restaurant's abilities in the kitchen and this soup was awesome. It was a creamy celery leek (pretty sure?) soup w/a dash of chives on top. I ate up every last spoon full- super duper yummy. The salad was also delicious, salty but not overwhelmingly so, the blood oranges brought the perfect amount of tarty sweetness, it was light yet when paired with a couple pieces of their delicious wheat sourdough, very satisfying. Unfortunately due to it being a business lunch, I was unable to partake in a alcoholic beverage but their wine list looked impressive. My ice tea was delicious and was refilled several times. My co-workers enjoyed the mushroom risotto, and the blackened salmon sandwich. Both said they were delightful and they would order it again. I was told the salmon was extraordinarily fresh and cooked perfectly tender & moist but not too flaky. \n\nAlthough I was really tempted to try one of their famous desserts, due to a pretty hefty wait from when we ordered to when our meals arrived (30 minutes?) we decided to get our check. Checks arrive in books which is a nice touch. Upon leaving we were thanked and invited back by the bartender(who waited on us), the hostess, as well as another guy standing by the door. This always makes me feel noted & appreciated- another nice touch which sadly, rarely seems to happen these days. Overall, 4 1/2 stars. Nice &  airy space, with classic touches. Random mix of locals, families, a few stuffies, and several yuppie-ish couples.  \n\nI'll be back for dinner, drinks, & dessert as soon as I can afford it!", "author": "Callie K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-07-30", "description": "The wine selection is pretty good, with plenty to choose from.  We ordered; crispy squash blossoms with four cheese stuffing, pesto, and a roasted cherry tomato vinaigrette, tuna tartare with fried green tomatoes, garlic chips, and Tabasco green onion vinaigrette, Buttermilk biscuits with Johnston family country ham and Dry Creek peach marmalade, and finally, smoked anduoille sausage with green garlic onion marmalade and Zataran's mustard, and the jalapeno corn bread.  Every single dish had amazing flavors.  The biscuits were unbelievably mouthwatering and moist; the contrast of the sweet succulent jam and the salty ham is perfect.  The tartare is on point in all its glory, and ended up being a few of my fellow diners favorite.  The squash blossoms are superior, however the flavors rely heavily on the cheeses and it's nearly impossible to disappoint with high quality cheeses as an ingredient in any dish. The sausage is juicy and hearty just as expected and accompanies the biscuits to lend a great Southern feel to the experience. \n \nThe starters were filling but, we had come here to eat a hearty meal, and in keeping with that intention, we all decided to continue our community style of ordering for the table.  We all shared a perfectly seasoned Blackened Cedar River rib-eye accompanied with corn maque choux, crispy onions and a brown butter garlic sauce.  This dish was beloved by all members of the dinner party!  We also tried the buttermilk fried chicken, which is what had lured us to the Hall in the first place.  It lived up to any expectations I may have had.  Crispy on the outside, and tender inside with sweet Brentwood white corn and Yukon gold smashed potatoes that were amazing, all accompanied by bacon gravy that was nothing less than perfect.  \n\nAt this point we could have stopped, but there was no way we were going finish up without dessert.  I absolutely love butterscotch and was delighted to order the butterscotch and chocolate pot de creme topped with butter crunch.  We also shared the Breton shortbread strawberry shortcake with chantilly cream, and the sticky toffee cake with vanilla ice cream and toffee sauce.  At this point there was no doubt the desserts would be perfect.  Upon arrival the strawberry shortcake is huge.  We could have all split this one dessert, which was filling but sweet and light all at the same time.  The butterscotch was everything I has imagined and more.  It was smooth and rich just like I like it.  The butter crunch on top was a true highlight.  I thought that nothing could top pot de creme for me that night, but I had judged too quickly.  The sticky toffee cake is amazing.  It's delicious. Perfectly warm, soft, saucy, and oh so insanely devilish.  I attempted to consume every bite until I reached a gluttonous state of full.  It doesn't hit me until the server brings our check inside of an old book that I realize they have taken some desserts off our bill for the inconvenience with the fire alarm.  Not only does this make me a very happy customer, but also it makes me believe in Town Halls positive vibe. \n\n\nThis place is really good.", "author": "Rachel P."}

Our server was very attentive and prompt, and she helped me to order a custom vegetarian entree, since there isn't an official one on the entree menu. I told her I wanted to try the brussel sprouts and jalapeno cornbread and other than that, they could make me whatever they wanted. I ended up getting a combination of grits, spinach and shredded brussel sprouts, a mushroom concoction, and a celery puree- which I thought was both novel and tasty. The portion was not heavy or overwhelming, which turned out to be fantastic because it was ALLLL about the DESSERT. I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with candied pumpkin seeds, bourbon whipped cream and 2 little cookies shaped like Halloween bats!! I also really wanted the Blue Bottle coffee ice cream that came with \"coffee and donuts\", so I ordered a side of that, which turned out to be like a whole dessert in itself, but hey- the more the merrier! They were both sooooo good! I had to do a Facebook status update about them when I got home. It was a great experience, and there was never an empty wineglass in front of me the whole nite!", "author": "Libbi K."}

We got there for a 9pm reservation and were seated after a few minutes... I know some reviewers get all pissy for having to wait longer than 10 seconds, but I view a busy restaurant as a good sign that I'm in for a real treat. In any case, the food was excellent and the ambience reminded me of Cape Cod/New England. Definitely try the tuna tartare, and the shoestring fries are excellent (albeit nutrionally void). For dessert, we had some sort of toffee cake (forgot the exact name!) that was heaven on a plate. Great wine list too.", "author": "Chris B."}

We convinced them that Town Hall would impress. Apps (muscles, ham and egg, jalepeno cornbread) were on point, just as before. Dad and I opted for the fried chicken, which I touted as THE DISH.  Chicken came. Dad cut into a breast piece and... it was RAW IN THE MIDDLE. I checked mine, same issue. We flagged down a nearby runner, and he took it back. Minutes later, our waiter returned and said to my father \"just so you know, it wasn't raw, it was just dark meat.\" Um, NO. Breast meat, as we all know, is white meat , but regardless, dark meat is dark, not cool to the touch, trancelucent and pink. I couldn't believe that our server had the audacity to argue. Just accept the complaint, appologize and fix it.  Second round of chicken comes out and....wait for it... RAW AGAIN.. we lost our appetite, and my parents lost their confidance in Town Hall. The establishment does retain two stars because they did comp the apps and, naturally, the chicken.  But raw chicken twice just isn't acceptable. Sorry, Town Hall.\n\nPrevious Review: Just like our knowledgeable, engaging waiter said... \"yum!\"  \n\"Yum\" epitomizes my experience at Town Hall!  From the Guinness fondue, served with generous portions of spicy sausage, cauliflower and potatoes to the surprisingly light and fluffy cheesecake dessert- I'm coming back, but only if I'm really, really hungry.  This was in no way, shape or form a light meal. \n\nFried chicken was rich, buttery and not at all over-battered. So juicy was this chicken that I'd actually return to pay the $19 price tag.  Boyfriend's pork chop was solid- smoky, touch of salt, cooked well. Jalapeno cornbread was ambrosia!  \n\nBetween the service (really great), the decor (exposed red brick and cool, sparkly chandeliers), the food (yum yum yum) and the bottle of cakebread zin that we brought- it might very well become my favorite restaurant in the City!", "author": "Jenni D."}

I figured it would be a place filled with skinny white bitches (which it was), and that me in my red plaid hunting cap would be frowned upon. Oddly enough, everything turned out alright.\n\nTo start, my girlfriend and I split the mac and cheese croquettes, which were really delicious. They came with a simple marinara-type sauce, which didn't really do anything for the flavor, but it still was delicious. My entree was the buttermilk fried chicken, which I found hilarious because I probably could've gone to Farmerbrown or Hard Knox if I wanted chicken for significantly less, but Town Hall didn't disappoint.  The bacon gravy definitely added a star on its own.\n\nThe wait staff was surprisingly not stuck up at all, which one might expect from this kind of yuppie bastard establishment. Our waiter looked like he was straight out of TV on the Radio, and I think we both win awards for the most awesome beards in the joint. We asked if we could get my Turbo Dog beer to go (my girlfriend suggested a sippy cup, I suggested a paper bag), and he started laughing and told us a story about how he almost beat the shit out of some bouncer for not letting him do the same (he's from New Orleans, and that shit is somehow legal there). Needless to say, this guy is now my new best friend.\n\nThis place is fancy pants expensive, but I bet you already knew that.

They did a nice job of working with the rustic industrial look, while still creating a nice warm feeling with good lighting and fun fixtures. I love that they serve you a bill in an old american literature book.\n\nThe bad- \nI have to say, I eat out at restaurants high and low end all the time and get great service, but this was a joke. I just about walked out and left the place. \n\nWhen I arrived, I was about 10 minutes early, the bar was crowded but there were many open tables. I wandered in the door and no one greeted me, the staff were busy, or looked away and completely ignored. I thought I must have come in the wrong door, so I walked through the restaurant to find I had indeed come in the front door. There was a woman with dark hair in an updo studying the reservation schedule, who saw me, and kept her back to me going over the schedule, never said hello, never said please wait a moment, completely ignored me. I found this very strange. I was a host about 20 years ago and I would have been fired if I wasn't on my toes to please every guest at the restaurant. \n\nEventually I was able to locate the hostess, a woman with a blonde french twist. I though, surely this woman with dark hair is a guest and she should be helped first, I insisted, and the hostess simply replied that they knew each other and she did not need help. I let her know I was early, checking in, could be seated first although my dining companion was running late, and would love to sit outside. She said that would be fine and tables would be set. Large parties came and were seated, tables outside were set for other small and large parties and others were seated as well. I patiently waited, knowing that I had come early, but wondered if my table was going to be given to someone else.\n\nMy patience had worn out, there were no seats at the bar, there was no where to sit in the entry and I had been standing already, waiting for 30 minutes! I was starving and completely sober, so that really seemed like an eternity. I checked in with the receptionist again and told her I'd been waiting, it was passed my reservation time, there were open tables outside and I'd like to be seated right away. She checked with the bus staff, who, after another 10 minutes, got around to setting a table for me. I waited, waited, waited, and the hostess never once checked on me, offered me a drink, a menu, a chair, anything! I could not find her anywhere. Completely exasperated, I seated myself at the table, The waiter gave me a funny look and I explained I had waited an inordinately long time to be seated at a table that had been empty the entire time.  Without welcome or apology, he came back with menus and my dining companion arrived. I was infuriated at the process and lack of service and respect. My dining companion asked me if I wanted to leave, I told him the food looked good and I'd already waited too long to not at least get a meal. \n\n1 star- for the 5 star food, really! If the service matched the food, I'd give this place 5 stars.\n1 star- for the slow service by our waiter, who was less than charming, but at least got the job done.\n0 stars- for the hostess and all the other staff who provided the opposite of service and hospitality when I arrived.\n\nI'd be in a hurry to come back for the food here, but the experience was truly unacceptable. Maybe I was cranky hungry, maybe I needed to wear a suit to get service at this \"casual dress\" (I checked ahead of time) establishment, in the end, I was simply happy to have eaten.", "author": "J B."}

We had reservations for 8:15.  We got there a little early, but they sat us promptly at 8:15 which was nice.  We sat down next to a brick wall in the corner, but noticed that it was a noisy restaurant.  We could barely hear each other talk as most tables had groups of people.  The crowd tended to be a little older than what I expected.  I was a little disappointed that the menu didn't seem too appealing.  Not the kind of food I was looking for or in the mood for.  For appetizers, we had some fresh oysters and crab salad.  The crab salad was good as it included real fresh Dungeness crab meat with butter lettuce.

It's terribly hard to get a reservation at the last minute, so it's a good thing we plan a couple of weeks in advance!  My pork chops were really good and I loved the sweet white corn that came with it!  I wanted to eat it all up, but they filled the entire bottom of my plate with it and I couldn't fit another bite in if I wanted to save a little bit of room for dessert.  The feel of the restaurant is very town hall-ish.  The bathroom is like ten million miles away, so if you're hunting for it after having more than just a few drinks in you - good luck!  We left a little before 10pm on a Friday night and it was still packed.  There was still a line of people waiting for tables and a couple layers of people milling about the bar.  Their problem with that is it's really hard for the diners to leave the restaurant with all the people at the bar blocking the path to the exit!\n\n12.02.2007 Update: Came here for dinner last night with family.  Got a 6pm reservation and got in without any problems.  The restaurant was pretty empty at that time.  HOWEVER, we sat there (a table of 5!) for over 30 minutes completely unnoticed!  Nobody stopped by to see how we were doing, give us some glasses of water, or take our order!  It was ridiculous.  We were pretty PEEVED, especially since the restaurant was nowhere near full.  My dad finally was able to flag someone down (the front of the house guy) and asked him for some waters while my sister asked if someone could take our order.  Great person to flag down because after that, the service was IMPECCABLE.  He was extremely apologetic and after we got our orders in, he comped us some sides and an appetizer.  I now totally LOVE the Jalapeno Cornbread!!!  I must have the recipe because it's so yummy!!!  The food was excellent and the service afterward was more than excellent.  He even offered to comp us an extra dessert if we wanted, but we were so full we couldn't fit another bite in.  Minus 2 stars from original review for the 30 minute wait, but plus 1 for the great way they apologized for it.", "author": "Kris L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-17", "description": "This review is a little overdue, but considering the amazing evening I had, I just had to make time to get it up.  \n     I heard about the restaurant from my roommate.  I was looking for somewhere nice to go out to dinner in the city and he told me Town Hall had fantastic new American food.  It sounded interesting.  I went online and booked a table through their Open Table Reservation system, very convenient.  They were almost booked for the evening but I managed to get a table for two.  I was meeting a good friend who I had not seen in 10 years, and was greatly looking forward to a nice evening. I was already impressed with their website, and ease of reservations, but it was not to stop there.  \n     My friend had a change of plans and we were forced to dine later in the evening.  She called the restaurant and they were able to change our reservation for a half our later.  By the time I had picked her up and we got to the restaurant, it was 15 minutes past our reservation and I was worried we would be out of luck.  \n     I walked in to their entrance on Howard Street and was immediately amazed.  Their main dining room stretched out away from me with a beautiful bar along the left wall.  Rich hardwood floors met elegant white crown molding on the walls, supporting lovely windows that accented the rich redbrick walls.  And it was packed.  Servers were quickly weaving through the dining room rush, but I was immediately aware of the restaurant manager.  Her appraising gaze and calm demeanor instantly identified her.  Our hostess was a sweetheart.  Although she had marked us as a no show, she had us seated at a table in 4 minutes.   WOW.\n     The table was simply but ideally lain out, and we were soon seated amidst the rest of the well dressed and hungry guests.  Our server (Theodorus?sp) was fantastic, as was his support staff.  He was knowledgeable about the menu, was able to recommend a few items over others which I tremendously respect. It shows a server knows the menu and how to pair the guest with items they will love. I found a nice bottle of Spanish red for $50 and we settled in to catch up.  As a starter, we ordered the BBQ Gulf Shrimp with a Worcestershire sauce and garlic toast.  The kitchen split the appetizer for us and it was still a substantial portion.  3 large shrimp each, an the sauce was SOOOO good.  I would kill for the recipe.  Next, we decided to split a salad of butter lettuce, sliced pear, walnuts and Point Reyes blue cheese dressing. Split again and fantastic.  An elegant take on blue cheese dressing, it was lite but flavorful, and allowed the rest of the items to really shine.  We followed that with an entree each.  I had the Rabbit cooked 3 ways, served with greens, mashed potatoes and a coffee jus.  My friend had the porkchop.  The portions were great, as was the presentation.  The food was arranged elegantly without being molested into an awkward position on the plate.  The highlight of my plate was the rabbit saddle.  I could eat this every day.  Tender, rich, soft... I am lost for words.  The greens on the plate were perfectly cooked, the sauce was amazing.  I was hesitant at first about a coffee jus, but our server convinced me to try.  Im very glad I did.  The other preparation was a shredded rabbit that was molded, battered and deep fried. It was all right, I liked the textural difference that it added in the dish, having something nice and crisp.  I was slightly unimpressed with the 3rd preparation, which was a bone in rack of rabbit.  It was less than one bite.  Still, interesting and tasty.  My friends pork chop was huge, and faced the same problems any pork chop does... getting cooked enough without being dry.  I had a few bites and found it to be ok.  Nothing I would order again. We finished with a rocky road desert, which was amazing.  Rich, decadent, lush.  A great way to finish the evening.  I sat there with my double espresso wishing I could eat like this every day.  So, 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 2 entrees, 1 desert, 1 bottle of wine, 1 double espresso and 20% tip, out the door for $200.  Very reasonable for the quality of the evening.  I will certainly be back, and looking forward to the new items the chef features.  Ive frequently been going to their web site and noticing that they change up their menu quite frequently.  FANTASTIC. :)", "author": "Beau S."}

It is a yuppie hotspot so be prepared for that. The inside is fine but full of insipid chatter about pointless bullshit and yuppies trying to impress one another with crap that no normal human being should care about. Fortunately the spice that the environment and people lack is made up for by the food. If you can't handle this level of spice, you're a pussy. Plain and simple. Go have a hot dog and let the rest of us use our taste buds. Had the following dishes:\n1) Tuna tartare - Delicious. I think there was a seared fingerling potato with it or something. Don't remember since I was on a date where I was batting way out of my league and needed to stay on my toes. \n2) Seafood etoufee - Had a little spice to it. Shrimp were decent quality. The rice was a little dry but Basmati is as Basmati does.\n3) Pot de creme - Made my teeth hurt it was so sweet. And rich. Actually I blame that for the chest pains I'm having today. Or maybe it was the pack of Camel Lights I tore through. Ah well.\nAnyways, without rambling, the place is a winner as long as you know what you're getting into.

For the same amount of money, I'd make reservations at the House anyday.  \n\nRegardless, I'll continue on with the review.  This place is more about home cookin' than creating Californian masterpieces.  You'll find items like short ribs, fried chicken, and steak on the menu.  Most menu items are very seasonal, which is a great sign.  \n\nI ordered the rabbit stew which was full of flavor without the need for salt.  My wife had the dayboat scallops, which were cooked correctly.  They weren't overcooked and filling.  I also tried a bit of a friend's short ribs.  I would probably order this item again whenever I come back.  The porkchop was otherwise uninspired.  \n\nThe wine here is rather pricey.  They definitely charge a very high premium per bottle.  I enjoyed dinner but overall, the cost wasn't as worth it.  It's hard to live up to the House and this one comes up fairly short.

The food was tasty, (when we finally got a chance to order, and receive our choices) if not a little fried-heavy for my taste but nothing 'miraculous.  We asked for a recommendation for dessert, and the server suggested the sticky toffee cake and the bread pudding,which would have been fine  ( a little too sweet), but they tasted EXACTLY the same . Why would a server recommend 2  identical desserts ?  Another small pet peeve of mine, when the server brought dessert, she brought the check with it.  That always seems tacky to me, as if they are suggesting you wolf down your sweets and beat it out of there. \nAll and all there was nothing offensive, or terribly wrong with Town Hall it just fell  way short of the glowing reviews I've read on Yelp.

She simply said \"follow me\" dropped us off at the table and left...there were no pleasantries to be had with her because obviously she was waiting for the next young rich man to walk in and sweep her off her ummmmm \"overworked feet\"....Our server had the same boring assed I could care less attitude and while he was able to muster up an ounce of personality to engage with us for a nano second it took a lot. The food itself was under seasoned and lackluster....after all this hype I expected so much more that what I got.\n\nActually I take that back the Fried Chicken was really good although it lacked actual flavor but for bland foodies this seems the place to be.  I guess i like highly seasoned food that tastes great...what a concept. The appetizers were great and we thought that we were in for the meal of our lives if the appetizers were on point. I had the seafood chowder and it was truly amazing. After our appetizers were served it took a full 30-40 minutes for our meal to arrive we were never checked in on by our server....I guess he was too busy boring himself in the kitchen or something...we began to feel that they forgot to turn in our order. We were starving and we could not understand what on earth could take a kitchen that long to bring out some food. And really a restaurant that seemingly believes that it caters to \"classy\" customers would at least offer up an explanation as to why things were taking as long as they did. \n\nWhen the food arrived my ribs were luke warm while everyone else's Fried Chicken was piping hot....I am guessing this was the hold up but let a sistah know that the chicken would be cooking for like 30 mins. I wanted to send back my ribs but I was afraid to wait another 30mins. Overall based on the service and cost of the food not to mention the taste factor I would never return.

But for Town Hall, I was willing to make an exception.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, my dad and me had lunch there. My favorite dish, which appears as an appetizer on the dinner menu, is offered as a sandwich for lunch. The warm Smithfield ham and cheese toast with poached egg and jalapeno cream sauce is definitely one of my top 10 lunches. Town Hall uses a whole wheat sourdough, drapes the ham on top, then blankets the whole thing in this delicious, rich jalapeno cream sauce, and tops it with a poached egg. The tang of the sourdough marries perfectly with the smoky saltiness of the ham. The jalapeno cream sauce is made by steaming some jalapenos to take out some of the heat but leave a little bit of bite and flavor, then adding lots of cream and butter and a little parmesan. Pierce the egg yolk on top of the sandwich and the combination is positively decadent. This is comfort food at its best and most fattening. \n\nBut I get ahead of myself. To start, we had the butter lettuce salad with candied walnuts, radishes and blue cheese vinaigrette. It's a generous portion; we split it and there was plenty for the two of us. I don't eat butter lettuce often, but this salad makes me want. It was covered in a rich blue cheese dressing, and candied walnuts added a nice, sweet crunch.\n\nI like the Town Hall dining room, too. It's got a nice, casual, even celebratory feel to it. The diners seem happy. (And with that jalapeno cream sauce, who wouldn't be?)

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-08-31", "description": "Town Hall meets all of the A-grade criteria: near-perfect execution, distinct flavor, pushes American cuisine to another level, fluid and varied menu selection--it only misses on one level and that's my personal flavor profile.\n\nButter lettuce salad with Fuji apples, candied walnuts and blue cheese dressing 9.50\nBarbecued shrimp with Worcestershire and parsley garlic sauce 14.00\nSauted sea scallops with smoked andouille sausage jambalaya and Dungeness crab butter 26.50\nBanana Pudding Parfait with Madeira glazed bananas and coffe dipped lady fingers 8.00\n\nWith the exception of our salad [which was overly dressed], each dish was delicately seasoned, cooked to exacting perfection, and invigorating for my nearly virginal taste buds [it's been over a month since I've been to a new restaurant]. I was surprised that the heavy and bold flavors common to American cusine didn't mask the quality of the main ingredients. As they should have, the sauces and sides accented the main dish without taking away from its grandeur. To the dismay of my company, our salad came out drenched in blue cheese dressing, which he describes as \"stale ranch.\" Although the butter lettuces had a great crunch to them, it was unfortunate that the dressing weighed down the individual leaves, making them soggy and inedible. I thought that maybe the heavy-handed dressing reflected the material excess of American culture, but probably should have sent it back [yes, it had that much dressing on it.]\n\nFrom my childhood memory, I vividly remember the experience of biting into an overcooked shrimp and feeling the individual body segments separate in my mouth--I stopped eating them for ten years. The anxiety of taking that first bite often crosses my mind now, but each of our five Worcestershire beauties ran contrary to all those bad impressions I've developed over the years. There's only a 30-second window of cooking when good shrimp turns bads and Town Hall managed to find that balance with precision.\n\nOur three jumbo sea scallops reminded me that scallops do not have to come in cream and cheese sauces. I tend to think scallops are extra chewy in a good way, but I now know what the true flavor and texture of a scallop is. These scallops were less \"flaky\" than I'm normally accustomed to and sans the cheese, I was finally able to perceive their subtle flavoring. Although the jambalaya was good and didn't overwhelm the scallops, it felt a little makeshift--as if they just mixed bbq sauce into rice. It was kind of a goopy mess.\n\nBy this time, my taste buds were telling me to give them a break and so I was a bit disappointed that there were no sorbets or light fruit options on the menu--only the decadance and indulgence of the heavy American palette. We opted to go with the bananas, since strawberry rhubarb was trite and since butterscotch&chocolate, marshmallow&peanut butter, and toffee&buttercream were all too much for our stuffed appetites. The pudding was very thick and although I felt like every bite was sending me to glutton hell, it was a successful marriage of two foods that I don't usually order for dessert.\n\nI would come back to Town Hall, even though I tend to prefer milder food. It feels good to be back on the restaurant scene.", "author": "Monica T."}

Modern decor, great cocktails, a great view (when I say view I mean good looking men and women), definitely a great place to hang out and mingle.  The food however can use a little work.  It certainly wasn't bad but I don't think it was worth the $30 per entree.  For example the scallop appetizer was drenched in some kind of cheese sauce which completely took away from the flavor of the scallops themselves.  The normally succulent bivalve mollusk was also over cooked and chewy.   The seafood etouffe was overly seasoned and the steak was not seasoned enough.  Maybe the chefs were just having an off night but I don't think the food was worth it.", "author": "Phil Y."}

While the large room with high ceilings set-up was definitely aesthetically pleasing, I had to shout at my dining partner to have a conversation.\n\nThe service was excellent. We arrived an hour before our 8:15 reservation and killed time at the bar with a glass of wine and some appetizers. The barbecue shrimp in worcheshire sauce on a crostini was unbelievable. I couldn't take a bite without making an audible 'Mmmmm' sound. It was very 'What About Bob'. I lost my cool, but regained it so as not to frighten all of the middle aged Caucasian men in suits that shared the dining experience with me.  We then got to our table and ordered the veal meatballs (to DIE for!) and the dish I had come here for in the first place: Buttermilk Fried Chicken. Best fried chicken I've ever had. So flavorful, so crispy outside, so juicy inside. They have got it down. The service was also great, the server apologized for not being able to bring over my shrimp appetizer from the bar before it got thrown out  (there was only a little crostini left on the plate) and got me a glass of wine to make up for it. Thank you Town Hall, I will be back the next time I want to pay $20 for the best fried chicken in the world and not hear the person I am dining with.

I was running late and didn't want to drive downtown to fight the mad crowds, so I caught a cab. What a bad idea.  First, it was pretty impossible to get one in North Beach, and second, the guy I got, had to go to the bathroom - so the entire ride, I was on the phone (THANK GOD!!!) and having to listen to Mr. Cabbie make weird noises. I wanted him just to pull over so I could get out and just walk the rest of the way, but I sat in the backseat, praying he wouldn't pee on himself... \n\nArriving at there restaurant - it was romantical. The atmosphere was sophisticated and the noise bounced nicely off the walls.  We sat by a window... in the back and the menu didn't have TOO many options, which made for an easy decision.  All of the guys at the table had the steak, Leslie had the oysters, and I had chicken.  We ordered a number of appetizers, to kick off the evening - meatballs and shrimp -- there may have been a third, but I can't recall at the moment.  I am always cautious of eating at places that get rave reviews because then I set my expectations so high that they come crashing down into a huge puddle of disappointment!  Kind of like movies I really really want to watch and end up not liking it as much as I thought I would, or guys that I end up developing feelings for, and then they become jerks and a-holes... I didn't want Town Hall to be that kind of an experience to have engraved in my memory... \n\nSo the food, up until the entree was excellent. For dessert, we also went for 3 choices, the butterscotch, the chocolate s'more looking one and again, I forget the third... obviously they weren't THAT important. I must say, the butterscotch, to my surprise was light, fluffy and amazing!  I got a whiff of it and wasn't that impressed by first smell, but WOWzers - the taste was heaven on my buds! And the house Sauvignon Blanc wasn't bad either... \n\nOverall, great birthday dinner with great company, good food in a nice place.  Downside -- service was a little slow for my liking... but it WAS New Years, and I'm sure, even the wait staff was a \"tad\" bit hung over, like the rest of the world :)", "author": "Lisa L."}

The ambiance is warm and cozy, with large family-style tables and big windows.  Sadly, we sat in a corner that contained a breeze -- likely from the small slat in the wall leading out to the freezing cold san francisco night.  But even the draft couldn't spoil the incredible food and service.\n\nWe ordered an exquisite bottle of Willamette Valley Pinot Noir.  It was pricey -- but worth every penny.  For starters, we shared a tuna tartar -- the tuna worked nicely with the fried heirloom tomatoes.  Next, I ordered the fried chicken.  I've made it a custom to order fried chicken in every nice restaurant -- in hopes of finding my fried chicken soul mate.  Oh i did -- they served up the best fried chicken i have ever tasted.  the breading was made with buttermilk and was rich and perfectly crispy.  the meat was tender.  it didn't matter what they served with it - the chicken itself made it a winner.  But, to be thorough, the chicken was served with collard greens that had been stewed in some sort of mystery seasoning.  nobody could guess -- it was a bit tart, but also a little sweet.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were also quite tasty.  For dessert, I chose a lovely apple crisp.  Sadly, the crisp was not piping hot, but the flavors were so nice, I couldn't really complain.\n\nThe service was excellent.  The waiter was helpful and funny.  He was very professional and open to criticism.  \n\nAll in all, it was an excellent dinner and I will definitely put it on my list of local fine dining favorites.", "author": "Courtaney W."}

I think the food is excellent, and location is convenient.  The most recent time I ate there was for dinner on Monday, May 11.  While I've never been impressed by the service, this most recent time was the worst service I've received in a very long time at any restaurant.  It was actually offensive.  My party showed up around 8pm for dinner.  It was a spur of the decision moment, and we hadn't made reservations so we were prepared for some wait/inconvenience.  I was just surprised at how awful the service was.  First off, when we showed up the hostess at the front of the house ignored us for several minutes.  Then when we were finally talking to her, in the midst of our requesting a table, a friend of hers (and apparently of the restaurant personnel in general) showed up and cut right in front of us as we were talking to the host mid-sentence and gave her a hug and started talking to her.  The host did return to help us after a few minutes, and let us know that the wait was about 15-20 minutes which we were happy to wait.  In the mean time, several other parties showed up.  But the hostess had disappeared and didn't return for over 10 minutes.  At some point several of the customers went back into the restaurant to find someone on staff, which seems pretty embarassing for the restaurant.  The various parties that were waiting spent a lot of time standing around with us.  I felt worse for them, because it was clear they had made reservations.    I noticed that the hostess gave them complimentary champagne, which I assumed was because they had to wait for so long.  It did not take 15-20 minutes to be seated.  I still think that we couldn't get upset by this since we didn't have reservations, although I think at a restaurant of Town Hall's caliber that they should at least periodically update us on the status of the table.  My party and I finally decided to eat at the bar about 45 minutes after we had arrived.  \n\nThe bar service was decent.  The male bartender working that night was really busy, and worked very hard.  Kudos to him.  He kept our water and bread basket filled.  He had a second female bartender helping out who seemed to disappear often.  The bar staff did end up getting our order wrong. We had ordered a side dish, which never came.  When we asked for it the staff seemed confused about what we had ordered, and it came 15 minutes after we had gotten our main course and well after we had finished the bulk of our main course.   I also noticed that several of the other bar patrons had to spend time flagging down the staff to pay their bill.  And throughout the evening, the hostess was more often not there then there.  \n\nAlthough I can understand some of the problems with the service was a result of a busy night, some of the problems I encountered were just poor front of the house management.  I like the food at Town Hall, but given this most recent dismal experience I will likely think twice about returning to Town Hall.  There are plenty more restaurants with good food AND good service.  The food was great as usual, but I was really disappointed in this experience.  \n\nHowever, I did end up sending an email to the staff about this through their website after the fact.  I was impressed that the management contacted me immediately to apologize and to follow-up on our poor experience.  While I thought that this experience was bad, I was pleased that the management cared enough to contact me afterwards and personally apologize.  I thought that this was classy.", "author": "Christie O."}

He asked us what we wanted to drink and took that order and walked away.

The food was wonderful, especially the desserts.  But the service was incredibly slow.\n\nI started with the butter lettuce salad, which was enormous and really tasty (although I believe there were supposed to be apples on it and definitely didn't taste any).  And I had the hamburger with blue cheese which was wonderful -- perfectly cooked, very juicy and tasty.  It came with a giant mound of fries, which was pretty obscene, but nothing compared to my colleague's fish and chips which was the largest amount of fried food I have seen in a while.  Dessert was equally gluttenous.  Everyone else ordered the butterscotch and chocolate pot de creme, which they all raved about -- but I don't like foods that I can't chew, so I had the sticky toffee cake.  It was enormous -- seriously enough dessert for 3-4 people, and I actually ate 2/3 of it.  So now, it's 5 hours later, and I should be hungry for dinner, but I still feel like I might throw up.  Perhaps I should have stopped after the burger?\n\nAs I mentioned above though, the service was dreadful.  We had an 11:30am reservation, so you'd think that we'd have been able to order before the lunch rush.  Our waitress was so slow, it took her 20 minutes just to bring the wine we had selected, and I don't think we ordered our food until 12:30.  Our water glasses weren't refilled throughout the meal, nor were our wine glasses.  No one ever came to ask how the food was, or I would have commented on the missing apples in my salad. We had to ask a bus boy to bring the dessert menu, otherwise we'd still probably be sitting in the restaurant now...\n\nWe had a great lunch, but luckily we could afford to spend 2 1/2 hours of our day at Town Hall, otherwise it would have been a real problem.\n\nGo for a great meal, but budget the time for it.", "author": "Kimberly G."}

We arrived around 11:30 AM to see that the restaurant was largely empty and the bar area relatively busy. We were asked if we had reservations which we politely responded that we didn't. In a matter of fact tone, the hostess exclaimed that the bar was full and that there would be availability at noon. She did check the reservation list and reiterated that there would be availability at noon. The obvious question was how can the restaurant be nearly empty yet have no availability immediately yet space would be available at noon when the restaurant would likely be much busier. However rather asking the question we decided to take our business elsewhere. BTW,  the hostess didn't try to apologize, didn't encourage us to make reservations in the future, or many other options. In a nutshell, if the hostess is rude, it is not likely a good sign for the rest of the experience. So I'll pass on this restaurant in the future.", "author": "Darrin J."}

Seriously folks, it comes in a bathtub sized vessel that, if you've had a reasonably filling meal to date, will confound the combined guts of all but the most horrifyingly obese couples.  Might fly in omaha, but it's proportion is actually rather profane this side of the rockies.\n\nthere's a lot to like here, even if I'm growing increasingly annoyed by this culinary movement toward comfort food that has distincly non-comforting pricing.  Wasn't the whole point of meatloaf that it was inexpensive to make, so that you could feed a whole clan with not all too much?  Aside from that philosophical dislike of this place, the food is excellent.  Very good fried chicken (very good for a restaurant, I should say), and solid preparation of steak.  I have to say that the apps, although intellectually interesting, were rather disappointing.  The apple beignets with ham (great idea) were less than stellar because the kitchen had used whole apple slices (sounds like a great idea) which tended to fall apart when cut into (better to use a small dice guys!).  Little croquets (forgotten what was supposed to be in them) were a tad bland, and served with mustard.  Mustard aoli?  Mustard sauce?  nope, just plain dijon.  hmmm...the exec chef's imagination just isn't working very hard.   \n\nThe wine list is solid and well priced, with a good selection of things from all around.  I hit a kim crawford pinot gris and a scheurebe to start things off, then delved into some other glasses from there.  The reserve list had a few interesting items, but ultimately not the most compelling.\n\nI did hate where they had their bathroom, which is up a fluorescently lit corridor upstairs--a jarring movement which ruins the fantasy of where you were and makes you feel like you're back in your office again.  Whoever worked on that particular piece of design, bravo for maximizing the amount of floor space on the ground floor...now go shoot yourself for pandering to the buck and making the restrooms an unpleasant, extended journey.\n\nThe long and short...I can see why people really like this place, and I'll rate it accordingly.  It was good, and does a lot of things right.  Still, I have to say, it didn't hit me on the heartstrings, and really failed to address all those things for which I enjoy going out.

I cam here with a bunch of wine connoisseurs after a wine tasting in downtown SF. This was a large party and our  service was nothing but spectacular but unfortunately the food wasn't up to par. To start I had the Ahi Tuna Tartare which was pretty good, but then again it's hard to mess up Ahi Tuna Tartare. I regret not ordering the bisquets which is something I will have to do if I make it back to Town Hall. For my main course I had the quail which came with fried oysters. OMG those fried oysters were TO DIE. Those fried oysters totally took away from the quail and stole the show! I would have been happy having an order of just those! The quail overall was just O-K. I ended up eating most of my friends rib-eye and mushrooms instead of my dish.

No, I really wanted to LOVE this place as it came highly recommended by my boyfriend who said he ate the best pork chop of his life here ( and he doesn't like pork).\nThe decor is nice, the vibe is great and the service is good.  So no complaints there.\nThe low rating comes from the fact that my pork chop was completely over-salted.  I like salty food but I stopped eating after 3 bites and downed a half litre of water (no exagerration) in 30 mins.  I should have had my order re-made but I didn't want to be a pain ( I know, it's silly that I didn't want to be a pain and here I am complaining!)  It's too bad bc I could tell that underneath all that salt, the flavours were amazing.  Also, having read the reviews on Yelp and Citysearch, there seems to be a large number of ppl who have had the same issue. I wish someone in their kitchen would read the reviews and remedy this.\nHad the key lime pie for dessert and it was alright if not a bit too sweet but maybe that's only bc the main was too salty.\nWill go back and order the pork chop again and hope for better luck ( I'll probably place the order with an \"easy salt\" request!)", "author": "sachiko W."}

The overall decor is homey and comforting; however, the place is very noisy and one can hear their neighbors' conversation!\n\nIt may be ideal for a family dine out, but it may lack the atmosphere conducive for a business meeting or romantic first date (unless one would rather not pay attention to the conversation and just stare at one's date all night ;)\n\nIn summary, the food, decor, service, and pricing are great!

I was there for their Mardi Gras Party to raise funds for Edible Schoolyard New Orleans and had a blast!  The ticket for the event is $75, but the food, the drinks and the entertainments provided were a lot more!  The raw bar was awesome!! 3 different types of oysters, shrimp and crab cocktails, all sooo fresh and tasty!  They had 4 people at the raw bar opening oysters nonstop from 5pm to about 9pm.  There were still oysters left when I left around 10:30pm.  The fried chicken was delicious!!  Crispy, but not greasy, the meat was tender and tasty with great flavor!  I had two pieces.  I wish I had the stomach for more!  I'm definitely going back to Town Hall just for their fried chicken!  The BBQ shrimp was another dish that was amazing!  Very tender and flavored!  This is all buffet style with staffs serving behind the tables.  The chef was able to prepare them to be so tasty even after sitting out for awhile.  There were a lot of people.  I think more than 200 people showed up.  I guess the turnover was fast enough to keep the food fresh and tasty.  They never ran out of food!!  By the time I left around 10:30pm, they were still serving food!  Here's the menu from last night.  I think the only item missing was the crawfish.  That's the only disappointment.\n\n.

There were Samba dancers, tap dancers and a a New Orleans Dixie band.  They were all good and lived up the party!  They also had girls at the party drawing face art and a balloon artist for balloon hats, balloon jewelries!  \n\nOne more thing I want to complement is the Town Hall staffs.  I'm not sure if the organizer of the party also helped or not, but the staffs were friendly and seemed to be having a great spirit and time too!  They constantly cleaning away the empty bottles, glasses and plates to maintain a clean and safe condition of the party.  I give them a 5 stars for that for a party that crowded.

The music was way too loud and the food was way below average. My husband started with the jambalaya which was much too spicy, even for him (the man eats habaneros raw) and not at all authentic. His main dish was the pork chop which was way too overcooked and tasted overwhelmingly of pepper. I started with the cream of corn soup, which was actually quite good and the only delicious thing either of us ate that night. That said, the soup was so hot that I had to wait at least 20 minutes before I could actually eat a whole spoonful without burning my mouth. Even the spoon was scorching hot. I then had the ribs at our waitresses' suggestion. When I asked for her opinion about what to order, I told her that I can't eat spicy food because of a health condition and she assured me that the ribs were not spicy. When I took my first bite, my lips felt like they were on fire. I then tried to quell the spice with the cornbread that came with my dish, which, it turned out, was also spicy and made things worse. Do they know how to make anything that isn't uncomfortably spicy? After a less than impressive dinner, we hoped that dessert might make the situation better. We chose the \"Coffee and Doughnuts\", which consisted of espresso ice cream and mini beignets. The ice cream was fairly good but the beignets were stale. I'm more than a bit confused as to why this restaurant feels they can charge almost $100 for two people and serve food that is not even worth $10.

Service was sparkling and much of the reason that the rating was brought up to 3 stars. Tip extra to sit in Taylor's section, she was top notch. Food wise is where Town Hall lacks. Don't get me wrong, it's good just not great. For the two of us with one and a half bottles of wine, dinner ran $250 and for that price I want to be WOWED. Is that too much to ask? I think I actually enjoyed the appetizers more than the main courses to be honest. We started with the veal meatballs over pureed potatoes and the intriguing cheese toast with prosciutto and beschamel sauce. Both very, very good...but worth $15 each, mmmm not really. Then onto roasted sea bass with cuttlefish for me and ribs for the lady. Again, not wowed. And for $30 each entree...I guess I was maybe expecting too much. Summary: stellar service but overpriced for food that was glorified diner/comfort food. Maybe I just didn't get it. Will not be making any special efforts to come back.", "author": "Mark C."}

I decided to give it another chance and returned for lunch with a co-worker this last week.  It was not a good experience.\n\nFirst, it seems our waiter forgot to place our orders.  It was 45 minutes at least before we received our food (a ham and cheese \"toast\" and a hamburger).  And that was after about three requests for updates on why it was taking so long.  When you are serving lunch to a business crowd on weekdays, a 45 delay is not cool.  Also, our waiter disappeared after our first request for an update -- he didn't return until after we got  our food.  All of our questions had to go through the bus boys and hostess.\n\nThen my ham and cheese toast came.  I am not exaggerating when I say it had ONE piece of very thinly sliced ham in it.  For $13, this is ridiculous.  The hostess saw me inspecting the sandwich and immediately apologized and sent it back.  They made me a new one and waived it from my bill, but by the time we got the second one it was already more than an hour after we started and I didn't have time to eat it.  \n\nAll in all, a lame experience.  The hostess was very friendly and nice (saving it from one star), but everything else was unpleasant.  And this is coming from someone who really likes Salt House.", "author": "Darin S."}

Most of the people at that point were the after work crowd, which I am sure is most of their patrons until a bit later.\n\nThe food was very good, and service okay. We were in a highly trafficked area, but had no one sitting on either side, which was nice - the tables are pretty packed in.\n\nI would say the ambiance is city chic, not necessarily formal or too casual either. Very easy to relax and have good conversation - when it's not too packed, that is! By the time we left it got crowded and loud - I am not sure that I would have necessarily enjoyed the experience as much in that atmosphere (as an intimate dinner).\n\nThe food was very good - we both started with the Butter lettuce salad. We both agreed that it was very good, but a bit heavy on the dressing (a bit too wet). Still very tasty.\n\nI had the buttermilk chicken as this seemed to be a favorite in reviews. It was good - considering this was the first time I had fried chicken (not a food I normally would eat) in a couple of years that is a compliment.\n\nA downer were the deserts we ordered. We had the chocolate cake and a peanut butter ice cream type dish (can't remember specifically what it was). My wife and I agreed that they weren't worth getting.\n\nAll-in-all, I would come back here for sure! It's a great place to come with a group of people especially.

We sat at the bar before we could get our seats. I had an Italian drink and my friend ordered a beer. The place seems very noisy, and way too crowded. I could barely hear myself. The waiter was extremely nice to us, came back and ask if we needed anything. We had the dozen oysters for appetizer.  Delicious. My friend ordered the fried chicken, and I had the Alaskan halibut. The halibut was cooked nicely but whatever it was on the side off balance the flavor of the fish. There was a certain sweetness I didn't like that counterbalance of the fish. Seasoned well, but overall a disappointment. My friend did seem to like the fried chicken. We had a side of collard greens, cause my friend is from the South. The only problem is how dark it can get inside the restaurant, and I have to scream everytime I have to say something. Which is a turn off to me. The waiter did suggest a really great merlot, which was really good and smooth. We didnt ordered the dessert, by then...we were pretty full.

Sally K booked a reservation for 8:15 on a Tuesday, the occasion was Shezilla's birthday. We all arrived around 8:00, checked in, then drank a few glasses of exceedingly expensive wine from the fully occupied bar. We stood for about 25 minutes, during which the hostess apologized for the wait twice, offering us champagne for the birthday girl the second time. We sat down when some seats opened up at the small plates table, then were shown to our table around 8:30. We ordered a $74 bottle of Cabernet, which was outstanding, and the crab dip for an appetizer. As is my custom, I asked  our waitress for her recommendations and choose the pork chop accordingly. Our entrees were finally served at 9:30 after the ladies I was accompanying gently prodded the waitstaff. Everything was delicious, very well prepared with nice presentation. However, the slow service certainly impacted my enjoyment of the meat and I would consider myself to be a relatively patient individual. Therefore, I submit, for the review of the yelp community, the following; while great cuisine is the cornerstone of a successfull restaurant, the service must be of at least passable quality or the effect is lost. As mentioned, the hostess was extremely pleasant and apologetic, our waitress was also at least moderately responsive, therefore I must fault the management of the restaurant for their apparent lack of direction regarding appropriate client scheduling and effective management of the workload and staffing of the kitchen staff. \n\nHumbly submitted,\na dissatisfied diner", "author": "hugh f."}

And, really, it would've fit the bill had not the service been so pushy.  First, I'll admit we were late for our reservation.  Got stuck on the bay bridge, yada, yada, yada, then pulled up to the restaurant to find they don't have valet parking--which I was told they did when I called in my reservation.  No matter, I kicked my boss out on the curb, asked her to get our table, then found a parking spot.  We were 15 minutes late.  \n\nWhen I joined her at the table, she informed me that the waitress said we had to vacate the spot by 8:15 as they'd need the table.  Okay, it was 6:30, we were fine.  When the waitress arrived w/ a bottle of water she told me the same thing--we need to be out by 8:15.  Okay.  Got it.  When my boss perused the appetizer list, the waitress looked at her watch and said, hmmm....you do need to be out of here by 8:15....to which my boss inquired if the kitchen was backed up?  No.  Service just slow?  No.  Whatever.  Bafflement.  We proceeded straight to a main course, ordering at 6:45.  Risotto for her; salmon for me.  Do we have time for a salad?  Well, you could--but you have to be out by 8:15.  A couple of minutes after 7:00 our dishes were served.   My fish was overcooked, as though it was waiting in the oven.  I didn't ask about her risotto.  We ate, we talked (it's a noisy place--know that going in), a bus boy came along five minutes later to remove the bread. Left the butter.  My boss asked for it back.  He arrive 5 minutes after that and inquired--while my boss still had her fork in one hand and a piece of bread in the other (I know, I know--don't judge her) if she was done with her plate.  Another five minutes and the bread AND butter were removed.  Then the water glasses.  Then the salt and pepper shakers.  Item, by item the table was cleared.  It was 7:20.

However, the disappointment began the moment I got there.\n\nThe hostess wouldn't give me a table since I was dining alone. My options were a community table or the bar. I chose the community table, but there was something about it that was just, well, awkward. Kind of like being at the kids table at Thanksgiving. It was right by the entrance so it was a combination of a draft from outside mixed with the flood of people entering and leaving mixed with awkward conversation with strangers. The table was too high off the ground and the seats were uncomfortable.\n\nMy waiter was really aloof. He seemed like a nice guy and all, but didn't give me any helpful advice. The whole dining experience took well over two hours -- and not because I was slow to eat or make up my mind, but rather because he would drift in and out of existence. 20-30 minutes would go by after a simple request for a water refill. He never even asked me if I liked my dinner.\n\nThe food was reasonable. I liked the tomato and cheese fondue. Neat concept, but the dipping options that came with it were just okay -- lukewarm green beans, hard garlic bread, and greasy eggplant?\n\nMy waiter strongly recommended the pork chop. It came in a really great potato and white corn sauce with sauteed spinach, but the cut of meat wasn't very good and was undercooked.\n\nI had the butterscotch and chocolate pot de creme for dessert. As some other people have mentioned, it is really good. So good that I'd consider going back and just getting that dessert. It is pretty rich.

Ambiance: First of all the place is easy to find with lots of street parking.  The inside is really nice, and although a bit loud, has a very exposed brick modern art type interior.  It's not that big, but if you all ahead for a reservation they could probably accommodate a group.\n2. Service: This accounts for much of the low score.  We spent a total of two and a half hours at Town Hall simply because it took two and a half hours for drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts to come out.  Very very slow.  \n3. Food:\nDrinks- Lots of good cocktail options, our waiter recommended the one with Pimms which was delicious.  \nAppetizers- The soup of the day (roasted corn soup) was very good, as was the tomato and feta salad.  I also hear great things about the grilled cheese and the tuna tartare.  \nEntrees: My dining companions really liked the ribs and sea bass that they ordered.  The rest of us got the fried chicken.  While I loved the sides (smothered greens and grits), the actual fried chicken was not very flavorful or juicy.  A serious let down, especially because it's sort of hard to screw up fried chicken.  \nDesserts: These are definitely phenomenal.  I had the pot de creme like everyone recommended which great (basically a good chocolate pudding), and the smores tart was also good, but my favorite was the olive oil cake with the cranberry compote.  \n\nAll in all this is a good place for a fancy (albeit expensive dinner).  If you bring some friends you want to talk to for three hours, you'll have a reasonably delicious and fabulous time at Town Hall.", "author": "Kelley B."}

The dining room, with a long mahogany bar stretching from the entry, is a mix of old-fashioned cream-colored wainscoting, exposed-brick walls with gilt-framed portraits from grandma's parlor, straight-backed wooden chairs, and starburst chandeliers salvaged from 1930s Spanish Harlem. The menu is a fusion of traditional American flavors from both coasts and points in-between. A baby spinach salad garnished with cornmeal-fried oysters or Ahi tuna paired with fried green tomatoes are unusual but excellent starters. Both the grilled rib-eye steak, medium rare as requested, with caramelized onions and potatoes in a flood of red-wine sauce that turned the meant-to-be crispy spuds soggy, and a thick pork chop coated with New Orleans-style tasso and peanuts, suffered from far too much salt, a complaint I've heard from others no matter what they've ordered. (Why can't chefs realize salt isn't necessary at all with all the other seasonings available? I never use it, and never miss it.) The highly-touted butterscotch pot au creme, not as heavenly as I had heard, is so rich it should be shared. Even with reservations, we waited nearly twenty-five minutes before being shown to our table. (Those without reservations may be seated quickly if they don't mind being placed at a large communal table, perfect for those who find socializing with strangers an enjoyable experience, less ideal for couples in search of a romantic interlude.) Our brusque waiter took a while to make his first appearance, and was MIA for most of the meal.

As we were getting together for a birthday celebration, my friend suggested Town Hall and there I was.  As I walked in, I loved the place -- the ambience and atmosphere.  It was already packed with people at the bar and at the waiting area.  We had reservations at 6:30 PM and were promptly seated.  Upon our server's suggestions, we started off with the Broccoli fonduc, Guinness Stout, andouille sausage, crispy potato, and romanesco..  For our main courses, the birthday girl had Grilled rib-eye, charred jalapeno cheddar twice baked potato, broccoli rabe and brown butter garlic sauce, which was awesome and cooked to perfection and very tasty; green garlic ravioli, hedgehog mushrooms, frisee and red wine gastrique, which was also delicious; and Niman Ranch pork osso bucco, black-eyed peas, shaved truffles and herb bread crumbs, which was cooked for 4 hours and melted off the bone.  I normally don't care for black-eye peas, but I devoured everything in my dish.  The dishes were delicious and so was the presentation.  For dessert, we shared a sticky toffee cake with vanilla ice cream and a butterscotch/chocolate pot de crme.  As it was a celebration, a lighted candle was in the butterscotch upon presentation to the birthday girl.  You are in a relaxed atmosphere and not rushed.  We were there for almost 3 hours.  We all agreed the food was good and that the server was very good -- provided great recommendations and very attentive.

The industrial yet plush decor gives you a feel of San Francisco as it was at the turn of the last century with all the comforts of the next. The oysters libretto was light and tintillating, the main movement of the halibut entree was orchestrated well and full of flavor, and the bread pudding rounded up with a comforting sweetness.   But - this is the reason why I am not giving it five stars like many others did: people, they use books to bring you the check. You are supposed to put your money in it and maybe write a few ridiculous phrases on the title page (like, \"fab food!\") and pass it to the waiter. What a failed attempt at cleverness, and how tacky. It offends both the author and the patron. Sure, they use old and pathetic books cum money holders but it does not add any good manners to the establishment. Also, the $8 promised \"best cup of hot chocolate in SF\" lost the bet to the $3  Burdick's in Jeremy's tasting competition.

That NEVER happens with us. The service was superb and the food. Well...... let us tell you. We started with the Ahi Tuna and fried green tomatoes which were to die for. The fried green tomatoes were definitely better than the movie!!! I had the peanut & tasso crusted pork chop with buttermilk mashed potatoes and fava beans. It was so scrumptious. Mark had the seafood souffl which he enjoyed as well. Sorry for the lack of description but I was face down in my own food and was too busy enjoying to stop and take a bite of Mark's. But we did have the bacon & cheese fried potatoes which were like an upscale tater tot only MUCH BETTER.

SMACK!\n\nTotally kidding. \n\nAnyway, Town Hall.\n\nI have been to this restaurant about four times. Twice I have had a decent experience; twice an excellent one. Most recently I took the Brewer there for his birthday dinner and it was very nearly stellar across the board. \n\nFirst off, if you haven't at least enjoyed a cocktail or five in the vast, warm dining room with the most beautiful chandeliers ever gracing the ceiling and the best mood music (old-school blues), then you really haven't had the opportunity to truly appreciate the place. It is a lovely, welcoming place that is pleasantly loud, daresay boisterous. \n\nWhile the food waxed and waned between pretty darn good and pretty fuckin great on previous visits, this most recent one boasted dishes that satisfied every sense, top to bottom. From the barbecued shrimp in Worcestershire sauce and the pulled pork slider and spare ribs, to the succulent buffalo steak with gnocchi and the slow braised duck in ginger sauce, the warm English toffee cake not to be forgotten. All these dishes rocked in their own individual way. The shrimp were crisp and the sauce they swam in was worthy of being mercilessly mopped up with warm bread that was readily replenished by the saintly bus boy. The pulled pork slider and the spare ribs were glories of all things swine. The only thing missing was bacon, but truth told, I barely missed it. The buffalo was a fabulous change from dreary old steak, though they were a bit stingy on the gnocchis that came astride it. And the duck! Oh glorious duck, cooked so perfectly I might mistake you for that far more truculent meat, pork. The ginger sauce, which may have overpowered a lesser dish, was perfection--the sweetness not too strong and enough spice to keep you guessing. \n\nThe meal was finished off with the toffee cake, recommended by our so sweet waitress. We ordered it dubiously, neither of us sure about this toffee nonsense. What a delight! What a fabulous orgasm of savory sweet deliciousness! \n\nAnd above all, we were not scoffed at for bringing an excellent bottle of beer to pop open. Many restaurants poo-poo even the finest and rarest 750s of Belgian ales simply because it is merely beer--still worthy of a $20 corkage, but not worthy enough to be tended to and certainly frowned upon by snooty waitpersons. This is a trend that would not be missed. Our waitress possessed no such snobbery. She graciously opened it for us (though it took her a bit to get around to it.... I think she thought we didn't want to drink a martini AND beer at the same time. Silly lady. \n\nAll in all, Town Hall is very good and worthy of your patronage, if for nothing more than a couple of drinks and an appetizer to enjoy the atmosphere.", "author": "Sage R."}

We had a great server, and everything we ordered came out in good timing.  We started with the mixed greens, pear, and goat cheese salad (sooo delish, with a honey thyme vinaigrette), and an absolutely wonderful tuna tartare (i usually shy away from tuna tartare because its done almost everywhere, but this version, with fried green tomatoes, was sooo delicate and tasty).  We also had the ribeye (very large portion, cooked a little more than the requested medium rare, served with these cheesy bacony tater tots and some slightly undercooked haricot verts) and the fried chicken (apparently encrusted with panko, nice twist, served with mashed potatoes and white corn).  Both dishes were great.  We ended with the sticky toffee cake, which was to die for.  The only thing that could make it better is a larger scoop of ice cream.

All the suits and city officials make this their stopping ground before heading out and one can usually spot the Mayor--Willie or Gavin, or both.  The bar is always filled with activity and the ideal spot to watch all the people check in.  The food is simple and pretty good, but watch out for those mussels-- sometimes they come out undercooked or of poor quality (shells not opened?  send them back!). The staff is attentive, but certain bartenders with personality of door-knobs sure can dull your experience at this otherwise happening spot.

I was super excited to come here since I'd heard such good things about the place. I started by splitting the tuna tartare with fried green tomatoes. It was really tasty, especially the fried green tomatoes. It's hard to find them on a menu in the Bay Area and I'm a big fan of them. Then I had the rabbit and crawfish ettouffee which was really good but I had a bit of my friend's meatloaf which was AMAZING. It's so amazing that three days later I'm still thinking about it. I really want to go back and gorge on the meatloaf and check out their desserts which unfortunately we didn't have time to get dessert. One thing I will say as lovely and beautiful and inviting as the space is the acoustics are TERRIBLE.

Our cocktails were too sweet, the salad was gritty, and the squid ink risotto (sigh!). The squid did not seem to be fresh and the rice was underdone. The catfish dirty rice entree was better but hardly redeeming. We ordered dessert - pot de creme - which was nice. We asked our server if the chef had changed in the last year and the answer was yes. We shared our thoughts about our meal and she was warm and obliging. She comped a couple of items for us which we had not anticipated.

She didn't hesitate and said No. Our party ended up only being 5 people. When we requested a different seat (they put us by the back kitchen door), the response was curt and exasperated. Attitude, again was that frigid, United airlines hostess chill. I guess this restaurant has gotten used to people coming and spending over $500 and ordering three bottles of $87.00 wine.

The food was not memorable and the volume level in the restaurant made it difficult to have a conversation without yelling. Well my brother really wanted to check it out so we agreed. I am glad that we did. The food was excellent and there were a few that I need to mention. For a starter, Faith's warm ham and cheese toast with poached egg was delicious! Not something you will normally find on a dinner menu and the waiter recommended it and I am glad we tried it. Unexpected and hit the spot. On the mains, I had the bay scallops with squash risotto which was cooked perfectly. My boyfriend laughed and thought I was going to lick the bowl! He had the cod which was also very good. We ordered 3 desserts and the 2 that stood out were the warm beignets (so light and tasty) and the chocolate mousse bomb - sinful! \n\nThe only thing that was strange was that on the starters, they apparently forgot to put in one of our orders and we had to ask for it. Then when it was brought out, there was no apology at all even though everyone had almost already finished theirs. This was a bit annoying but as the night went on soon faded as a slight misstep.\n\nThe acoustics in the restaurant are still bad, and the bathrooms a bit of a trek (up 2 flights of stairs), but the food and ambience are worth a visit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-02", "description": "We had dinner here Saturday 11/28 and I was somewhat disappointed, having had a much better experience here about a year ago.  Our party of six (4 adults and a 9 and 11 yr old) ordered:\n\nThe biscuits, ham, and pepper jam - very good\n\nBBQ shrimp - pretty tasty, but you must love Worcestershire, because basically the sauce tastes like thickened Lea & Perrins.\n\nJambalaya - not good.  My husband ordered it but would not eat it.  I tasted it, thought it too tomatoey and spiced in an unappealing way.  Nothing like any jambalaya I've eaten in New Orleans.\n\nPork chop - the chop itself was very tasty and cooked just right.  My husband thought the peanut/tasso crust was unnecessary and the pomegranate was just strange.\n\nSea bass - good.  The fish was cooked properly and the clam/bean/broth that it came with was good as well.  It was topped with a piquillo pepper which, according to the menu, was supposed to be stuffed, but the stuffing must have been made of a massless, colorless, flavorless substance, because I couldn't find it.  An all right dish, but not memorable.\n\nJalapeno corn bread - very good, and rich\n\nDorothy Parker cocktail - yum.  The best part of my evening.\n\nAlso ordered, but not tasted by me were the bay scallops, the ham/cheese/egg toast, and the fried chicken.  The consumers of these dishes seemed reasonably satisfied, but I didn't hear any raves.\n\nWe didn't order any desserts (although I had originally planned to) because we ran out of stomach capacity and patience before dessert-ordering time rolled around.\n\nThe worst part of the evening was that our service was not very good.  Our waitress was reasonably nice but absent most of the time.  She may have been avoiding our table because our entrees took a very long time - they arrived AN HOUR AND A HALF after we were seated.  Finally a service person (not our waitress) arrived at our table with a dish of macaroni and cheese (very tasty but exceedingly rich) which was intended to tide us over due to the long delay.  That was a nice gesture, but after the appetizers and bread (which was very good BTW), the last thing we really needed was more food to spoil our entrees.  I would rather they had comped something we'd actually ordered, or might like later, like desserts or coffees.  Also, neither the macaroni deliverer nor our waitress (when she reappeared at the end of the meal) offered any sort of explanation for the delay or much of an apology (the waitress tossed out a half-hearted \"Sorry for the wait\" as she picked up our check).  One of the odd things about the poor service was that we were actually the first people seated in the restaurant that evening, so it wasn't even particularly busy for the first 45 minutes or so.  Perhaps the fact that we did not order any wine (we had had too much for the 3 days previous) made us lower priority customers.  However, on my previous visit I got great service with just 2 adults and 2 kids, and only wine by the glass ordered.\n\nIt seems like it is a bit of a crap shoot to dine here - it might be great, or really disappointing.  I was a little embarrassed, and would not bring guests here again.  My general feeling is that this place has slipped.  It seems a lot of the food is either not very interesting or includes combinations that don't really work.  Also, some of the best tasting dishes were obviously loaded with salt and fat.  It's not that hard to make food taste good when you put lots of fat in it, so I don't find these types of dishes all that impressive.\n\nI might give this place another chance someday, but not before I get to lots of other places I want to try/return to.  There are plenty of places in the city where your odds of a good experience are better than 50/50.", "author": "Jo A."}

It was well prepared, but the accoutrements that accompanied the chop on the plate were heavily salted.  So not the most pleasant meal by any means, and meal seemed 'heavy'.  Another appetizer we ordered was also heavily salted.  I peeked in the kitchen while walking by and the pace was frantic..  it seems like an issue of quality control of the meals leaving the kitchen?  Unsure and hope its looked into..

I don't know too many places in the city that have a wine list like they do (unusually, varied from around the world, and not out of this world spendy) and their location is cool - love that big turn of century loft feel and I especially like it at lunch when it is sunny and buzzing in the main room.  Their meats I think are their high point - the ribeye they have done, the skirt steak, they seem to excel at those dishes and at fish.  I don't know that I have ever had a bad fish there.  That being said, this is not food for super subtlety and maybe at the price point people are expecting fancy, complex dishes, but that is not really how the brother chefs that run this place roll. I get what they are doing in a way that if you are not an east coaster you might not as it is sort of anti-precious food.  They do big bold, hearty food and if you don't like that, you might call the food salty, saucy etc. They have a great private room upstairs for events, the communal table at the bar is a particularly cool place to hang and I like the small patio they have as well.  The atmosphere is great and the bartenders friendly and laid back - there really is way more to love about this place rather than hate.

The BBQ shrimp are not Prudhomme quality but if you don't know better they're o.k. The pecan/tasso pork chop is good but if it weren't for the smokiness of the tasso it would be your regular grilled pork chop.  The ribeye w/crispy potatoes is a misnomer since the potatoes are usually in the gravy which makes them soggy.  The duck dish is just bad.  Overseasoned is as bad as underseasoned.  The butterscotch/choc pot de creme (it's pudding people) is good.  The cheesecake was o.k., marred by the crust which wasn't.  The server steered me away from the brownie saying it was too sweet.  When the servers say the pudding is the place's best dessert, I am not impressed.", "author": "danielle b."}

Every seat in the place was taken, and i didnt find it overly loud at all. maybe i just had a good seat, but i dont see what everyone is talking about. i could hear the waiter and my date just fine. the place isnt perfect, its alittle out of my price range for a usual dinner spot, so ill save it for more special occasions. props for having squash blossoms on the menu though! i love those! and the egg, toast, jalapeno dealio is beyond fantasitc! this is a place i will go to again. it would be fun to take people here from out of town.", "author": "clint e."}

For some reason I felt a little like I was in the Napa Valley.  My client had not arrived yet.  At 12:10 pm I was feeling a little nervous that she still had not materialized.  The host and hostess were extremely gracious and went out of their way to make me feel comfortable.  They offered me a glass of champagne.  When 12:30 hit and my client still had not arrived, I asked to be seated.  They were kind enough to make every effort not to give away my table.  After a few more minutes my client arrived, apologized, and we ordered.  To start off, I ordered the tuna tartar with fried green tomatoes.  The tuna was perfectly seasoned, and the tomatoes were not greasy in the least.   For the main course I had the pork dish.  It came with tasty little brussels sprouts, with just a touch of a maple glaze, as well as small cubes of cooked apple and potato.  The client loved her meal.  I spent about $75 including tax and tip.  I can't wait to return to Town Hall!  It might be my new favorite place.  Next time I will try a dessert!", "author": "Kandi K."}

There was definitely sand and grit in the frisee salad.  The hamachi sashimi was slimy and smelled quite fishy, but the accompanied herb salad was great. My veal meatballs were really salty and the brown gravy looked and tasted like it was made out of the McCormick's Brown gravy seasoning packet.  We came here because an friend recommended the fried chicken here.  My BF had it and it was not all that great.  Meat was juicy but the exterior could have used another coating of batter to make it more crisp.  If we're going to eat fried chicken we want it to be finger lickin good.

We have heard so many great things about this place and couldn't wait to try it out.  The food was good... but shouldn't it be in San Francisco?  It was everything else at Town Hall that made it something memorable but not necessarily in a good way.  The service- whether it was a kitchen problem or a server problem or a combination was awful!  Our server was overly anxious to get our entire order- we ordered oysters and our appetizer (bbq shrimp).  He wanted us to order entrees then as well but it was fairly early on a Friday night and we wanted to take our time... little did we know there was going to be plenty of that.  Our oysters on the half shell came out at the same time as the BBQ shrimp.  The smell of the BBQ shrimp overwhelmed the oysters.  Plus when asked which oysters were which the person was clueless... no idea what we ordered.  Really???  Also, who wants raw oysters at the same time as hot bbq shrimp?  If we ordered our entrees when our waiter wanted would it have come then too?  The time between our oysters/app and when our meal arrived was 45 minutes+.  \n\nI will say I was thankful for the person who brought my dinner to the table because he suggested the perfect white wine(viognier, lambert bridge 2007) with my red snapper.  The red snapper was excellently prepared, and the wine was the perfect compliment.  It's a shame there were blatant restaurant miss-haps because it really killed the dinner flow- of what could have been an incredible dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-12", "description": "Being from New Orleans and having worked in the restaurant business for over twenty years, I am often extremely disappointed in restaurants outside of my hometown that attempt to recreate Creole or Cajun influenced food. There are many potential downfalls starting with the scarcity of the proper ingredients, the recipes and cooking techniques, as well as the general concept of what the cuisine is all about, for starters. Town Hall wisely avoids all of the potential pitfalls in a variety of novel ways.\nFor starters the restaurant itself has a charming, rustic feel, with sturdy tables and wooden chairs and spectacular light fixtures. The crowd is a dressy but unpretentious  downtown sort that seem to have made this place a regular destination. The art is chic and appropriate, the music is fun, and the waitstaff is mostly efficient and attentive.\nI couldn't resist the starters so we had three course of them, six in all. An amazing tuna tartare studded with garlic chips and spiked with a red pepper hot sauce that was a perfect foil for the impeccably fresh tuna. The fried oysters were served on the half shell with an interesting take on several classic combinations (spinach puree...a nod to Oysters Rockefeller and bacon hinting at the Galatoire's classic Oysters En Brochette...it was a dish Emeril would have been happy happy happy to serve.) It was also delicious. \nNext we had a course of outstanding BBQ Shrimp (peeled!) with a creative take on the classic...it almost reminded me of a spiked Red Eye Gravy...although the sourdough crouton was a mismatch. Thankfully, we also had a plate of the best biscuits I've ever tasted in my life nearby for proper sopping. The country style ham and pepper jelly that accompanied the biscuits were top notch as well.\nOur only misfire came with the pork rillette (?) which sounded good on paper...Anson Mills grits! Hello! The grits were lost amongst a rather bland pork 'square' but it was still okay, just not great. The pork slider and ribs were spot on, though.\nWe also enjoyed a round of proper cocktails and a half bottle of Antinori's Super Tuscan Sangiovese/Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend. The only beverage ding was the fact that the water glasses are so small that one gulp and the glass is empty.\nDesserts were delicious, too. The butterscotch and chocolate pot a creme was insanely rich and silky. The German Chocolate Cheesecake had great flavor but the texture was a little too dense. We also had a wonderful glass of Sauternes and French Press Coffee.\nA dining experience I wouldn't hesitate to experience again. Love the check presenters too!", "author": "Michael D."}

The first time was for lunch.  We were in a bit of a rush, ordered quickly and then waited and waited for our food, even though we had told our server we were in a hurry.  Finally the maitre d' came over and explained that our ticket had been lost.  We again explained that we were in a rush and he said he would get our food out ASAP.  He brought us two delicious cups of asparagus soup to tide us over.  Finally our food arrived.  It was pretty good, although my husband said his salmon tasted not so fresh.  My portabella mushroom sandwich was quite tasty and the housemade chips were excellent.  We asked for the bill when the food arrived to speed things up.  The bill came and it was for $6.  I asked if there were a mistake and the server said, \"No we lost your order so you don't have to pay for the food!\"  I was quite amazed as we have never been comped all of a meal just because the service was slow.  A big star for Town Hall there.\n\nMove on to last night.  We had a reservation for a party of 6 and we turned out to be 7.  No problem, even though they were busy.  Then another friend showed up, again no problem.  The service was very prompt, and the manager even found a bottle of a new type of gin that I had been craving, but was not on the bar shelf.  Another big star!! We ordered lots of appetizers, all of which were excellent, especially the buttermilk biscuits with peach marmalade and the crab and artichoke dip.  The wine list had a lot of good selections for under $50.  We ordered a bottle which I tasted.  I allowed the server to pour it but when my daughter, who is a wine \"snob\" tasted hers, she said it was corked.  The manager brought a new bottle with no attitude whatsoever, even though I should have refused the bottle upon tasting it.  Our entrees arrived just after we had fininshed the appetizers, and they were great.  My halibut with fava beans was extemely fresh and cooked perfectly.  Several of us ordered the fried chicken which was pronounced \"fabulous\".  I can't remember all the entrees, but everyone was very happy.  Dessert was ordered and came quickly.  The strawberry shortcake was a real hit as was the pots de creme.  We were completely satisfied, well taken care of, and left very happy.  The room is a bit noisy, but we were able to carry on a conversation at a reasonable level.  I am not sure why there are so many complaints of servive on this site, but we found the service excellent.", "author": "June H."}

They said it was to give the starter a 'southern slant.'  I don't know how southern it was, but the fresh tuna alongside that tangy / savory flavor combination and crispy texture really worked.  The decadent duck entree was beautifully cooked with a rich figgy sauce that was full of flavor, served over a nutty rice pilaf.  Wonderful.  No vegetables were present and I don't think they could have competed with the flavor of the sauce.  The rib-eye steak was a fine cut, tender and flavorful and accompanied by some fun little tater tot thingies and green beans.  Generous portions, big on flavor, and enough of a meat n potatoes theme to satisfy the type that doesn't go for a froo froo California menu. For dessert we had the pear and cherry crisp with a small but dreamy scoop of homemade ginger ice cream.  I wish they had gone much lighter on the sugar and let the cherries and pears do the talking.  The service was 100% professional.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and had a good answer for any question we had about food or wine, and kindly offered to work to our timeline as we had a performance to make after dinner.  Both the waiter and the host even remembered say 'enjoy your show' when we left.  If only my friends paid that much attention!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-07-18", "description": "I went to Town Hall with such great expectations and feel cheated that it was so disappointing.  Dining out is about great food but it's also ambiance and service.  All three are what makes the experience memorable. And for me, they struck out.  First, the ambiance: it's beautifully decorated in an old brick building but LOUD and crowded.  It looked like a great drinking spot for crowds after work but was so rowdy the night we were there that I felt like I was at a college frat party.  It was almost impossible to hold a conversation at the dining tables because of the bar noise.  Second, the service: our waitress was horrible. She was unfriendly, certainly inexperienced and just plain awful.  She practically threw the menu at us, never asked how our meal was and was just sour.  I noticed the waiter at the table next to us (I think his name was Thomas) who was remarkable and the exact opposite of her!  A true professional who treated his customers so well.  I commented to him as we were leaving that he needed to take our waitress under his wing because she was not at all up to the job. You could just feel a vibe from her that she didn't want to be there.  Finally, the food:  the gulf shrimp appetizer was spot on but our entrees were so overcooked that I couldn't tell if my fish was halibut or snapper, absolutely no flavor.  It was cooked to a crisp and chewy.  My husband's pork chop was so dry it tasted like cardboard.  While the \"flavors\" (sauces,  etc.) were good on both dishes,  the meat was seriously overcooked.  Of course, we could never get the waitress back to express our displeasure so we just marked it up as a bad experience and saved some money by hardly tipping her.  Hope they learn to train their staff (kitchen and floor) and do something to curb the rowdiness in the bar.", "author": "Chris G."}

With reservations we were seated immediately but that is all the attention we received the rest of the evening.   Water came right away but it took at least 10-12 minutes before a server arrived.  After finally ordering the wait time for the food was reasonable.  We started with a half dozen oysters that came before our starting cocktails--but they arrived shortly there after.   Our waiter was nowhere to be found.  Our wine arrived along with the appetizers of Faith's warm ham &amp; cheese toastand the veal meatballs.   Both were excellent. but still no sign of the waiter.   The bottle of wine was placed on the back shelf behind my husband's head and not once did someone come over to replenish our glasses.  My husband had to reach behind him for the bottle.  Our main courses were also excellent--etouffee for me and osso bucco for my husband.   But still no sign of our waiter.  Plates were cleared and we were left with the last of our wine.  Ordinarily we would receive the dessert list but nothing...I finally spotted our waiter across the resturant and appeared to be flirting with one of the food runners.
