Or, if you're me, save a giant matzo ball soup for emergencies. When my co-workers and I rolled up to the museum-side takeout window, there were several orders in front of us. In fact, one person ahead of us ordered a whole small office's worth of sandwiches, hence the hold up.\n\nSeveral of us ordered the $17-ish. sandwich-and-soup combo: for me, that consisted of pastrami on double-baked rye, and that massive matzo ball soup cup. The pastrami I ate fresh, and wow -- it's melt-in-your-mouth good. In a strange way, it was very similar to a thick-cut bacon, but made with beef and much less salty. I really enjoyed that the 'bark' of the pastrami wasn't so peppery, and that the double-baked rye crust was so crunchy. It also came with a small cup of creamy potato salad, which was on the sweet side.\n\nThe matzo ball soup I enjoyed an hour later, determined to try it even though I was full. The ball is super filling and flavorful, a nice contrast to what matzah typically tastes like, and pairs very well with the egg noodles and white meat in the broth. Wise Sons drops in just a hint of dill, which does wonders for deepening the broth's flavor. Reheated, it's just as good.", "author": "Gwen W."}

The sandwiches came on rye and were super tasty.  The best corned beef I have had in years.  The matzah ball soup had a gigantic matzah ball, the size of a baseball, and the soup was kind of bland, but honestly I am no aficionado of matzah ball soup so maybe it is supposed to be that way.

(choice of potato salad or coleslaw on the side.) For $16 I expected a deli sandwich, not a regular sandwich. \n\n- Regular sandwich is one you can fit into your mouth to take a bite and costs about $9.\n\n- Deli sandwich is stuffed with so many layers of meat (or other filling) that you can't possibly take a bite, you either need to eat it with a knife and fork or take out half of the meat, which you save for later because you have enough left over to make second sandwich. $14 - $19. \n\nLesson learned - I'll wait until I'm in New York or L.A. to get a deli sandwich but if you are in S.F. and just have to have one - this is the place to get something that tastes the same.", "author": "Evelyn S."}

Things are adapted, things are changed. Classics will always be classics, but the future deserves an ode too? \n\nNow, I read through some of the reviews before I stepped in and a lot of Yelpers were going back and forth on the price vs the thickness on the stacks of meat on their sandwiches. \n\nNow, I can tell you, I love a fist thick meat sandwich as much as the next Jew. I mean really. I am Jewish and I grew up with our father taking us to one or two particular restaurants in Rockville and Wheaton solely because of the thickness of their sandwiches. \n\nBut, in this new day and age of health, we can probably both admit that no one really needs to eat one sandwich with three quarters of a pound of corned beef on it. Imagine how much meat would be in our deli drawers at home if that was a normal thing. \n\nNow, the deli near me in Bethesda does that, we all love it, but everyone ends up taking the second half of their sandwich home. Not a bad thing, I mean, you get 2 meals for the price of 1; but ya don't REALLY need a sandwich that thick. \n\nNow, I will admit that I was a little nonplussed to see the amount of pastrami on the club sandwich I got. \n\nWhen it hit the table, I literally thought they had accidentally made the club sandwich with bacon because I saw 1 singular piece of thin brownish reddish meat sticking out of the side. \n\nThen I was like... wait... I'm in a Jewish Deli... there shouldn't even BE bacon #SheDoesn'tEvenGoHere. What do we say to the G-d of Bacon in a Jewish Deli... Not Today. \n\nIt WAS pastrami.\n\nAnd then I went back to the menu... just to remind myself what I ordered, and it seems that they're making a play on a traditional club sandwich. \n\nThey say \"Smoked diestel turkey, crispy pastrami\" etc.\n\nLike the pastrami is suppose to be a substitute for bacon \n\n... clever... \n\n#ButHeresTheCatch... even on my Club Sandwich... I like more than one piece of bacon. Gimme gimme more.\n\nThe horseradish mayo is an absolute delight. Not too pungent, the mayo has a keen sweetness to it before it delivers a faint background of that unique horseradish spice. \n\nThe potato salad that I got with my sandwich was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. Not overladen with mayo, wonderful forward notes of dill. A real expert fine chop on the red onion and herbs. Really fresh and clean tasting. I'd love to get this recipe. \n\nAnd the last thing I ordered: The Pickle Plate. You can add a pickle plate onto any one of the sandwiches for an extra 4.50. \n\nIt comes with: \n\nPickeled carrots: Not a fan *strong taste of... tumeric?\nPickeled beets: Huge fan! Probably my favorite thing on the plate\nSaurkraut: A solid fresh version that has a great toothsome bite \nRed Onion: Nah B *strong taste of... Anise... I'm sure of that one\nHalf Sour spears: I'm so so on this one. Not bad, but not great. \nPickle rounds: Mustard seed? Something too strong is happening with this one as well.\n\nIf it was me, I'd let the vinegar sing a bit more than they tried to do with the spices. \n\nSo... will I be back. Well, I'll tell you for 23.70 in San Francisco I was wonderfully stuffed. It was very quick, the service was good, and mustard gave me a compliment as soon as I sat down. \n\nNo for reals... all the tables have a squirt bottle of spicy mustard that reads \n\"Eat Something, You Look Skinny\" on the back. \n\nI will be back. I still need to try the Matzo Ball soup, the corned beef, and the smoked trout salad. That was probably the hardest thing not to order, cause whitefish salad is MY JAM. \n\nLike... I don't think I've met anyone that enjoys whitefish salad as much as I do. Little secret: it'll actually be the name of my next I phone\n\nOh... and they serve all their sandwiches on enamelware!

The meat is just the right saltiness. The Sauerkraut has the perfect blend of tanginess and texture, safe from vinegary and limp. No mushy sauerkraut here. I'm not even a fan of Rye bread but their organic fresh baked bread was so buttery and toasted precisely at the ideal level of soft and crisp that I even ate the crust!\n\nGooey, melted, thick cheese, russian dressing, and sauerkraut are layered on each slice of bread.

Or an obvious one.\nIt was a particularly warm day and many were enjoying their vitamin D intake on the grassy lawn out front. I intended to do the same with a little nosh, specifically babka. The take-out line at the kiosk wasn't long, but it was moving very slowly. I was getting impatient under the hot sun and schvitzing. \n\n$4 Chocolate Babka:\nI've only had babka a couple of times in my life and I was curious to try it from the Wise Son's.  \nI received a huge chunk that was about the size of one of their sandwiches (which are on the small side as sandwiches go). It was actually a little too big to eat gracefully, but I proceeded to dig into it anyway, like a predator unhinges its jaws to devour its prey.\nThe layers were flaky with swirls of chocolate and had some type of crumbly topping. It wasn't as fluffy or spongy as I had hoped though. \nI wrapped up the rest and took it home to enjoy.\nMr. Joy, who had never had babka before, had the genius idea to heat it up. It then became soft and the chocolate melted a bit. If you have the patience to pop your babka in the oven or a microwave, I'd suggest doing that. It was so much better.\nNot that I claim to have any authority on what a proper babka ought to taste like.\n\nLike any Jewish deli, they've got the usual pastrami & corned beef sandwiches, and bagels & smoked fish. & kale salad, of course. Because kale is everywhere. \nI have tried one of their reuben sandwiches, which was good, but was a small sandwich with a big price.", "author": "Joy W."}

The matzo ball soup was delicious. Almost as good as my mom and I's. The matzo was tender, fluffy and just dense enough to hold together.

There are two, maybe three, components that work together harmoniously to create this tasty treat: Jewish rye bread, pastrami and perhaps a little bit of brown deli mustard.\n\nGrowing up with a grandfather who owned a market on Miami Beach and an uncle who owned a deli in Kendall, deli is something with which I am extremely familiar, and pastrami has long been my favorite. Smoky, peppery, tender, fatty warm and oh so delicious, pastrami is perfection and the Jews do it right! So when friends suggested we go to A \"Jewish Deli\" inside the Contemporary Jewish Museum, I was all over that like white on rice. \n\nThe restaurant itself, being a museum restaurant, doesn't have much ambiance or atmosphere, but the ordering process and service is pretty well dialed in making for a nice place to dine. The menu is concise, with a definitive focus on their pastrami, offering everything from the classic pastrami sandwich to a vegetarian Ruben with smoked mushrooms. \n\nI settled on the classic sandwich with a side of coleslaw. Soft, slightly chewy, and studded with flavorful rye seeds, the bread they use here is the perfect vehicle to catch all of the juices dropping off the hot and delicious pastrami they pile high on this sandwich. A little spicy brown mustard and you've got the perfect pastrami sandwich everyone is after! The coleslaw was dressed lightly and creamy enough to cut through the pepper spice of the meat, yet heavy on the caraway or celery seed which added a wonderful herbal punch to it. Aside from the delicious taste, the \"side\" was mountainous.\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty good representation of what a pastrami sandwich should be, and Id gladly eat it again. I'm giving four stars for the location and the cinnamon babka, which was drier than the Sahara. Unfortunately I can't recommend something sweet to finish on.", "author": "Michael T."}

They had raved about their pastrami and reuben sandwiches. I was intrigued. Unfortunately, what I received was a few measly slices of well-cooked pastrami between two plain pieces of rye bread + a few packets of mustard on the side. I'm not gonna lie - this was a pretty half-ass pastrami sandwich. It came with a crunchy pickle and a side of flavorless potato salad. Don't get me wrong, the pastrami was tasty. But in my experience, Jewish delis usually serve sandwiches where the pastrami is piled sky high. Let's face it - a Jewish deli lives and dies by the quality of its pastrami sandwich.\n\nThis tiny sandwich looked like something that a mother would prepare for her 3rd grade son. I don't mean to be dick-ish about this, but I paid $20 for this paltry lunch (and it was literally a few slices of pastrami inserted betwen two small slices of dry, rye bread).\nThe only redeeming thing about this meal was the Matzo Ball Soup. Wise Sons gives you a hearty bowl of \"Jewish penicillin\" mixed with generous portions of matso, chicken, & noodles. I think next time I come here, I'll just order the soup and skip out on the sandwich. \n\nAll in all, my lunch was really more of a 2 1/2 star experience. \nWould I return?

I vas so vorried that I vas getting a body cavity search since I forgot to floss, you should pardon the expression. I liked it when American Box was here in the CJM for a few months. Nice people, good boxed lunches, and hardly a soul to be found on a weekday. But now that Wise Sons has taken over the space, the place has been discovered by a larger group of hungry goyims, shikshas, and nudniks (photo: http://bit.ly/19Pa3P4). I think Jamie W. and I got all verklempt about it, and how appropriate to have a Jewish-style deli in a Jewish museum. Mazel Tov!... So now that there's a match made in heaven, or at least somewhere near the Lower East Side of Manhattan, I can die a happy man after getting a little nosh here.\n\nBut first there's the security gate to overcome. I had to empty out all my pockets...my keys, my wallet, my loose change, my vibrating egg, nothing was sacred to this man. In fact, we'll be going out on our first date soon. I filled up his Tupperware container quite easily. Good thing he wasn't asking for a urine sample, too. Once you pass, no small feat, mind you, there was another line to contend with on this busy Saturday morning. The menu is small, but all the sandwiches you would expect in a Jewish deli are accounted for...pastrami, corned beef, brisket. Egg creams? Check. Rugelach? Check. Chinese chicken salad? Of course...what do you expect my Aunt Sylvia to eat? She's gotten a little hippy after grazing the buffet line in the Catskills.\n\nWe thought we were going to challish waiting to order. Jamie went for his favorite, a $12 Corned Beef Reuben prepared on a griddle with Russian dressing, Swiss cheese and sauerkraut (photo: http://bit.ly/13PhTAU). This was no chazzerai, it was geshmak... I mean delicious. My order was also geshmak. It was the $10.50 Classic Roast Brisket on Rye. I read previous Yelp reviews and knew to be very specific that I wanted lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise...yes, mayonnaise...in my sandwich (photo: http://bit.ly/1be8JmJ). So our one complaint was that these were California portions meaning they were kinda on the paltry side for our voracious appetites. Don't expect the heaping mounds you see at Katz's, Carnegie, or even Miller's East Coast Deli, but then again, these aren't as pricey neither.\n\nWe decided to share a $7 bowl of Matzoh Ball Soup, which contains one of the biggest matzohs I've seen since Aunt Sylvia made me look at the boil on her toochis (photo: http://bit.ly/17z1aTI). The broth was quite hearty, and there was real chicken in there. I felt my own toochis grow by a foot, I swear, and this wasn't even technically our first visit. Get avay you say! Yes, we came here the day before to try the takeout window since the inside was packed. All we had room for were a couple of Rugelach - soft and yummy (photo: http://bit.ly/1ceCUhy) and a slice of the Cinammon Babka - something sweet but a little stale if you should pardon the expression (photo: http://bit.ly/18cpBZr). If it's good enough for Woody...\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...nice quality deli fare that a mommala would love though portions are skimpy if you know what I mean\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...it's the lobby of the Contemporary Jewish Museum...what better setting for a Jewish deli?\nSERVICE - 3 stars...a bit stressed\nTOTAL - 4 stars...get a nosh here, couldn't hurt...shalom!", "author": "Ed U."}

Corned beef tasted pretty much as I remembered it from my childhood and NYC visits. Rye bread soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Matzoh ball soup was an accurate rendition, a little bland compared to the chicken soup you're probably used to from the can or supermarket (those are overly salted, etc) but this is essentially what my Mom makes.\n\nCons: You have to go through security to get inside. While it's light security, that's still a lot of friction to get a lox and bagel. Fortunately you can also order the full menu at the walkup window outside. Prices are steep, two soups and two sandwiches cost me $37!

There are pastrami, corned beef, and turkey for the classics (with a mix of sauces and cheese) and specialty sandwiches. \n\nMy favorite is their open-faced smoked salmon bialy. I had my first bialy at the Ferry Building's Wise Sons and it was wonderful. Had the same experience at this Wise Sons. Bialys taste so much better than regular dense bagels. So much that I never want to eat bagels again. The bialy is thin and crisp on the edges. Lesson of the day, bagels are boiled and then baked but bialys skip the boiling step. The smoked salmon bialy was also not plastered with cream cheese and there's enough smoked salmon so you're not wondering where everything went halfway through. Smoked salmon never gets old so if anything I'll be returning for that. \n\nI also got a chance to try my first and only matzo ball soup so far. The soup was a little salty and the matzo was soft. I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like so I can't speak much to it. However, the soup was a good pairing with our classic pastrami sandwich. \n\nOh funny thing, you do need to pass through security before getting to the cafe and ordering. If you want to eat in their outdoor seating area, you have to get your order to-go. \n\nWise Sons was surprisingly empty on a Saturday. I'd imagine it to be more crowded. The location is hidden inside the museum so if you don't know what you're looking for you're going to miss it. \n\n5 stars for the smoked salmon bialy and 4 stars for everything else!

I am giving 2 stars only because the pastrami, or what I got of it, was very good, as was the cole slaw.  But the service and general food quality at the CJM location of Wise Sons was a huge let-down. \n\nTo start, we arrived around 12:30 on Saturday and it wasn't crowded. There were two parties ahead of us in line, but it took like 20 minutes to get our order in. The lone woman at the register also had to deal with problems in the kitchen getting orders right and take out. The party ahead of us was 7 people, which certainly wasn't her fault, but their ordering was painfully slow. When we finally did order, I noted that, instead of just giving me a tea bag and a cup, she had to open the bag and prepare the tea herself--a huge time waste when there was now a lengthy wait. This is just a minor annoyance that  I would recommend eliminating. People can pour their own hot water into a cup. \n\nThe real disappointment was the food. It was apparent that there were some problems with food orders, as several plates appeared to be going back. There were only two guys behind the counter. As a New Yorker, I relish a good pastrami sandwich. Wise Sons bills Hot Pastrami. We ordered a sandwich and a kale Caesar.  After waiting another 20+ minutes, the food came. The sandwich contained maybe 3 slices of fatty, not hot or even warm pastrami.  I wish I had taken it back, but we were now running late and it already had taken about 45 minutes in a not-crowded cafe. I had asked for the salad tossed;  instead the dressing came on the side and there wasn't enough to cover. It was bland.  The cole slaw was tasty. \n\n Bottom line,  $13.50 for a deli sandwich warrants a decent sandwich, with an adequate portion of meat. The pastrami was meager and about 30% fat, both of which are unacceptable. The service was slow and inefficient.    Reputation for good food isn't enough, guys.", "author": "Joyce H."}

I've gone to their pop-up at the Ferry building a few times and have had breakfast at their flagship on 24th street (it wasn't so good). I've been impressed with the sandwiches and the amount of meat I'd had on the first couple, but each experience since has gotten skimpier.\n\nToday a co-worker and I decided to trek down to the Ferry Building for some Jewish comfort food, with the holiday beginning tonight an all, and right where Wise Sons was supposed to be was a vacant plot. Had we missed the exodus?\n\nSo, we popped onto MUNI and made our way to the takeout window at the Jewish Contemporary Museum. Apparently we weren't the only ones who had decided that jew food was a necessity today. The line was long. Not 'fleeing Egypt' long, but enough to discourage you on your average 60 minute lunch break.\n\nWe persevered!\n\nIt took about a half hour to get to the window and order, which was fine and expected, and after another 20-30 minutes my co-worker got her food (a much larger, more complex order than mine). Then about 7 people who were behind me got their food (I see from other reviews that this is not an unusual occurrence with these \"wise\" guys). After I inquired what was holding them up, I was told, \"Oh, it's coming.\" 3 orders later I got my bag, I asked where my soda was, got it, and we were off, back to work.\n\nI got to my desk, opened my lunch in anticipation and realized immediately that they had not put coleslaw on my #19. Granted, I asked for it on the side (so it wouldn't get the bread soggy before I got back to my desk), but it was just not there. I prayed for it, and nuthin.\n\nThe worst part about this is that my lunch came to about $19.21 (plus I gave them a tip).\n\nI ordered:\n\n1 #19, basically a warm ruben with coleslaw instead of sauerkraut that came with a side of potato salad (plus add $1.00 for ordering lean meat)\n1 Cream Soda\n\nIf the sandwich was grand, with more meat than I could eat in a single sitting, fine. But this pitiful sandwich wouldn't be out of place at a Lee's lunch counter. The meat is better quality, of course, but the portion was literally laughable. They put 3 moderately sized slices of corned beef on the sandwich and called it a day. Compared to every other jewish delicatessen I've been to in my life, this was literally the smallest portion of meat I've ever seen on a sandwich.

We came in through the gift shop and went through security. I passed my phone/keys/wallet to the guard, and he inspected my partner's bag. She beeped through the gate, but he told her she was fine and so we gathered up our stuff, and made our way through the store, stopping to look at and touch a few items. \n\nFrom the store, we made our way into the building lobby and then walked far across that lobby to the restaurant. There was only one party seated, but I could see some people eating outside. We agreed it was too cool and we'd rather sit inside where it was quite nice. We approached the counter and looked at the menu board. I grabbed two menus from the counter and handed one to my partner and we started to talk about what we were going to order. \n\nThe woman working the counter greeted us - \"Hi guys, I'm sorry but security asked if you could go back and see them.\" We were surprised, but we said sure, put the menus back and walked way way back. Did they change their mind about my partner setting off the bell when we came in? Did someone think that we took some merchandise and they were going to search us? Did we possibly leave something of ours at the gate? None of those made sense. \n\nWe cross the lobby, walk through the store, and approach the guard. He's dealing with other people so we stand there - kind of in the way - waiting and waiting. Eventually he looks up and I say \"They told us at the deli that you wanted us to come back here.\" \n\n\"The deli is closed.\" \n\n\"Yes, well they told us to come over here.\"\n\n\"The deli is open from the outside only. It's closed until 1:00 from the inside.\" \n\nIt went back and forth like this for a bit; I was mostly very confused. I didn't understand why he was telling us the deli was closed since I was just using that to explain why we were back to speak with him, they said it was his request. He was trying in a very indirect way telling us we weren't allowed to go to the deli - from the inside, until 1.\n\nEventually it became clear that this was why we were summoned back to security - because we walked without obstruction through a completely open lobby up to a counter at a restaurant that for all anyone could tell was open for business - and we were not permitted to do this. \n\nBut there's no way he could have seen where we went once we left the store - it's a huge building - we could have easily just left through the lobby exit. So it doesn't seem possible that he initiated the call to have us sent back there; what cue would he have? \n\nAnd if the deli person didn't want us there because they weren't serving until 1, why didn't they just say \"Guys, sorry, we aren't open here until 1. You can get lunch outside though.\" \n\nAnd if the museum doesn't want people walking through a certain part of the building, then why not rope those off? We could see the path to the displays was blocked off. \n\nWe were just trying to be patrons and instead of having a nice lunch, someone called security on us for the act of walking where were clearly permitted to walk.

But I can count traditional Jewish delis on four toes. So yes, Wise Sons on 24th popped the yamaka off this city. When the Contemporary Jewish Museum open & said, hey, let's have a Jewish deli, with the thunder of a King, they took a Triton, forked it with corned beef and struck into the heart of SF. \n\nYes, expensive. I put down a $10 bill and in return earned a thin sheath of salmon between bagels & schmear. But, at least it was Lox, which doesn't exist anywhere downtown. The two words \"fish\" and \"plate\" combined are like a refreshing cucumber face mask for my belly. Then when I saw an ode to Langer's with a pastrami on rye, topped with russian dressing and coleslaw, at the very least I can get an edible slice of what I long for. \n\nThen, they courted De La Paz to be their coffee & operate their cafe. It's a living museum of the things this city needs more of. You keep doing things like this and you'll keep me balanced. I know there are *some* very good pastrami palaces in this city. But when a guy wants a fish plate, Lox, and at the same place within walking distance of the working city, this is it. Walking through the security is like being blessed by the kosher kingdom!", "author": "Jon A."}

I was actually on my way to a restaurant nearby when I happened to stumble across this spot with a giant sign in front that said \"lox and bagel\". \n\nThey had seating outside at the park and it was a beautiful day. I decided to give it a try. \n\nService was quick. Bagel was great, not what I expected at all. It was thin with not a lot of dough inside. I really liked that since the dough is just unnecessary filling. I would rather have more of the fixings. Could have definitely had a bit more smoked salmon in it, but I chose the closed face one, which they told me would have less inside and was cheaper than the open face bagel. \n\nSince the sign read \"lox\" and the menu said \"smoked salmon\" I had to ask them which it was. They seemed stumped when I asked. They said it's the same thing. Well Wise Sons, actually there is a difference. Here is a link so you can wisen up ;) \n\nhttp://www.foodrepublic.com/2013/01/21/whats-difference-between-smoked-salmon-and-lox\n\nWhat you are serving I believe is smoked salon not technically lox.

My #19 sandwich (with pastrami) was tasty and the smoked trout sandwich that my fiancee had was also very good. I would suggest slicing the meat thinner as it's harder to take bites when it's as thick as it was. The celery soda was unique because it was freshly prepared, however, after sitting in my cup with ice for so long (see the next part of my review), it simply became too watered down.\n\nNow for my gripe. I was told by a museum staff member that today, Christmas Day, is the busiest day of the year for the museum and subsequently Wise Sons. Unfortunately, they didn't staff accordingly so we ended up waiting an hour to order and another 40 minutes to get our food. It seems like they pared down their regular menu for today as there were a number of items on their website that were not available for purchase. That makes sense given the large number of customers being served, however, it wasn't enough. To make matters worse, the cashier didn't seem fazed by how long we waited in line and failed to tell us how long the wait would be for the food. After half an hour I asked how long it would be. The woman I spoke to said she would check. She came back to me and handed me two mandelbread cookies and said ten minutes. Again, unfazed and unapologetic. \n\nI realize that on Christmas Day you're the only game in town and people are often willing to put up with a lot, but an hour and 40 minutes for 4 sandwiches and a couple of drinks was just too much. Perhaps Wise Sons should have considered adding more staff or closing the 'to go' window and focus on the customers inside the restaurant, or have everyone (including management) helping to get orders taken and prepared.

The outdoor line at noon wasn't too terrible and the weather cooperated fairly well. \n\nThe sandwich was crispy and warm with no tough parts.  The pastrami was moist with a good salty crust.  The pickles on the side were a nice complement as well.  So in terms of the sandwich's taste, it was definitely top tier.  The problem was with the value.  The sandwich cost $12 but was remarkably thin, seemingly only a few slices worth of meat in the middle (thick-ish slices, but certainly not Katz thick).  Another person in my group ordered the same and his looked thicker.

However, the doors between the inside and outside eating areas are locked, so one has to go out the main museum doors and past the security metal detector to sit outside.\n- The dining room was far too small for the crowds there.  People were waiting in the wings for tables while other patrons were grabbing tables while their friends were inline.  A staff member directing the tables would have gone a long way.  For a bit we ended up at a table for four and only 2 chairs.\n\n\nFood:\nI tried to order the lunch combo, which is a classic sandwich, side, and drink for $13.75.  Even though the menu made no mention of this, the only sides allowed are cole slaw or potato salad.  There are several other sides on the menu, such pickles and green salad that I was informed are not part of the combo.  I'm fine with that - just put it on the menu - don't surprise me when I'm ordering.\n\nOverall, the portions were very small for the price charged.  I did not feel that the place had good value at all.  The brisket was quite dry and had not been well trimmed of fat.  Overall, I left $10.50 poorer and still quite hungry.\n\nAlthough I did not see it first hand, a female member of our group reported the bathrooms to be filthy and that she had to \"squat around\" the toilet, whatever that means.\n\nToo bad too - because I love a good Jewish Deli and work a block away.

I came because I was hungry, cold, and had just heard the night before that I had to go here for the Matzo Ball soup. \n\nI ordered at the takeout window by a lady who wasn't friendly, but I wouldn't say she was actually rude.  We'll leave it at \"brusque\".  I was an easy customer:  my only question was if they could accept credit cards (they can).  I knew what I wanted and the transaction was quick.  I then waited nearby, with other foodless people who had ordered before I got there.\n\nI ordered the fabled Matzo Ball soup and a bottled water. A bit pricey, but I was there to experience this soup.  I received the water and sat down at one of the nice outside tables, and waited.  And waited.  For awhile nobody received anything from that window, but after about 5 minutes somebody received food, and this slowly progressed until about 12-15 minutes later when my soup arrived. That's along time for soup that is generally sitting in a pot waiting to be plopped into a bowl. It was hot, and well packaged in a serviceable lidded container, in a plastic bag, and then in a paper bag with a spoon and napkin. The guy that called out that my order was ready was very pleasant.\n\nI will confess that I do make my own Matzo Ball soup from scratch (okay, I buy the matzo meal, but smashing my own matza doesn't really enhance the finished product).  I acknowledge that a home cook's signature soup is usually going to be deemed better than a restaurant version, particularly when we're dealing with something as loaded with tradition and memories as soup,  All that said:  the soup was a bit bland.  Mind you, it was much better than the weirdly austere versions I've had at a few Seders where the broth has been skimmed and strained down to an anemic plasma suitable for injection.  There was actual chicken skin and fat in this.  There were large bits of chicken, a few carrots, some skinny noodles (?), and a big fluffy matzo ball. Carrots I like.  Why not some onion, celery, maybe a hint of garlic or an herb for flavor?  You can do a lot without adding more salt. There's no playing the purist card, because you've got noodles in there.  I could do without those, but they're not hurting anything and they do add a little food value.  The matzo ball itself had a nice texture, able to keep it's shape without danger of destroying the plastic spoon. There wasn't much flavor in the thing though. I'm not sure the ball spent a lot of time in the broth, or perhaps the broth failed to impart much flavor.  I always cook my matzo balls in the broth for maximum flavor, but perhaps they do theirs separately for the sake of handling to volume of orders. \n\nI won't be back for the soup.  It is healthy and fairly hearty, but not worth the wait or the price.", "author": "Julian F."}

When I think Jewish Deli, I think of great (grand) sandwiches piled high.... this was nothing like that.  It had the price of a grand sandwich, but the meat-stack of a hospital cafeteria.  Much too small for a $17 lunch combo.  Taste was fine, not stellar, on my Reuben, but the coleslaw was actually very tasty.  They either need to reduce the price or make a proper sando.   This was a strong disappointment after walking 8 blocks just to try it.  If the price-to-food ratio was better I would rate this a 3.5, but I'm still searching for a great Jewish Deli that can compare with something from Manhattan, and this isn't the place.", "author": "Kevin W."}

The space is gorgeous--warm brick wall, tons of natural light. The only thing I didn't understand aesthetically were the nails pounded into the surface of the tables. What image are they supposed to conjur? They would wreck anyone wearing a delicate fabric and looked painful, but would definitely keep pens from rolling off the table.\n\nI arrived at 12:45 and she had ordered for us after twenty minutes in line. Thirty minutes later our food arrived. I don't understand the American thing about not enough people behind the counter. I understand it was during their lunch rush, but a good business hires enough people to keep the line and and the food moving. My friend ordered the vegan reuben, which looked like a traditional cafeteria-style reuben (albeit short--nothing like Katz's) and came with a heap of potato salad. The faux meat tasted of liquid smoke and the potato salad was more salad than potato. But that wasn't the worst of it: I ordered the chinese chicken salad ($9.50) and what arrived was a heap of paper-dry slaw with three crispy things on top and a slice of rye bread. Huh? Where's the chicken? I dug down to the bottom of the bowl and there were three grey, sad pieces of chicken that looked like fingernails. At this point, I was starving, but reluctantly brought it to our server's attention. I asked for something else: a turkey sandwich. \n\nAt this point, the rush had dwindled, so as I waited for the sandwich, I went up to the counter to order espresso drinks. The person at the register told me the espresso machine was broken. (I could see it, sitting there, at the end of the prep line--no note taped to it.) Huh? A cafe with a huge sign advertising espresso?!! I got the impression that they weren't telling me the truth. At this point, with a pounding headache, I ordered two house coffees, which were served to me in paper cups and were $2.50 each. So disappointing. (There is apparently a window that serves to the outside--not sure which orders take priority when both the inside restaurant and the walkup window are ordering.)\n\nThe turkey sandwich arrived in ten minutes (whoa, that was fast!). It was so sad! The sliced turkey had that chemical preservative taste and was pressed next to a very pale piece of lettuce on that same sad light rye bread. I've had better meals in a hospital. The best thing about the sandwich was the dab of mustard. It came with pickle spears (one was crisp, the other two soggy) and guess what? Cole slaw. The same slaw as the chicken salad but with sauce. I was starving but the sandwich was really unpleasant. To the deli's credit, they brought us a free bowl of matso ball soup and apologized, which was a nice gesture. The soup, however, was luke warm, which defeats the purpose of soup, and at the bottom of the bowl were more sad, dry grey shards of chicken. Ew! I ended up eating the carrots out of the soup and a few bites of the sandwich. Left disappointed and hungry. The most discomforting \"comfort food\" I've ever had.\n\nBy the time we left the place, the inside had emptied out and it looked like they closed early. It's a bus-your-own-table joint, but we saw several patrons leave who didn't get the message. I don't mind bussing my own table--the compost bin got a lot of food off my plates.\n\nThe worst part about this restaurant is that with its location and cuisine, it could and should be absolutely fabulous. It should be the gem of the neighborhood.\n\nMy idea of a delicious salad is served only a block (443 feet) away at The Grove Yerba Buena (690 Mission Street). Their chinese chicken salad is $10.75 ($1.25 more than Wise Sons). When you order a salad there that claims to have chicken in it, you see the chicken proudly piled on top, in a generous amount. The quality of their ingredients is far superior and at a comparable price point. Yes, they get busy, too, but their ordering line moves smoothly and they bring the food out in a much more timely fashion.\n\nI'm not sure what's so wise about Wise Sons. Won't be back.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this review.", "author": "t p."}

You don't have to pay admission but you have to go through the museum entrance and have a bag and metal check to eat inside.  No biggie.  There is an outside eating area and a take out window.   Food is very good.  Unusual assortment of drinks.  Make sure to try the potato salad.  I had The TOP SEED TURKEY sandwich and it was great.", "author": "Bonna R."}
