Eventually had to remind them about the waters, but the coffees came out fast. They only had one choice of sugar on the table, the ones in the pink packets that we didn't want, so we asked if they had anything else. She brought us 4 packs of another sugar. The coffee was not good; very watered down and bland. I didn't have more than a few sips.\nI got the chicken sandwich with a house salad instead of fries, which cost extra. He got the steak sandwich with fries. The food came out pretty fast, but was less than impressive. The salad I got was not very fresh but the balsamic dressing was good. The sandwich was pretty basic, I was thankful for the mustard at the table to add some interest. His sandwich was on a roll that was too small and you could probably count on two hands how many fries they gave him. Nothing about the restaurant was memorable, I wouldn't recommend or visit again.", "author": "Katie H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-08", "description": "I've been curious about this place for ages since I'm hardly ever in the Mission when this place is open. I've passed by it many times, but they close at 3:30PM every day even though they sell Dinner Specials. Who eats Baby Beef Liver with Grilled Onions? Night watchmen just off their graveyard shift? Insomniac prostitutes after a slow night? Bulimic hipsters on a binge? I was just looking for some breakfast last Saturday after taking the car out to go to the post office. I'm amazed at the paucity of options in my immediate neighborhood, so I found myself in the Mission and got giddily excited to find a parking space at 20th and Mission.\n\nI was surprised to see how bustling it was at 10AM since I'm so used to seeing it deserted and dark from the outside. It looks and feels like any Roadside Diner, U.S.A., a place you are more likely to find off a highway in the Central Valley than in the heart of hipsterville. But I assume that's part of its lure, the anachronistic presence of a formica-heavy diner with no mention of a burrito, pupusa or organic sushi on the menu. What I did find intriguing is that they offer a Hangtown Fry and other seafood dishes you don't really expect here. The booths were filled with boisterous families, so I secured an empty seat at the far counter without any fuss. The waitresses were buzzing by with purpose.\n\nI ordered the $6.75 Big Scramble because I was in the mood for a Joe's Special-type of breakfast. It was serviceable - a solid portion of ground beef mixed with scrambled eggs and bits of sauteed onions and green peppers, accompanied by hashed browns that gratefully looked like they didn't come out of a package (see photo) and of course, two slices of already buttered toast which came with lots of those little berry and mixed fruit jam packages. There was definitely a lot of butter and vegetable oil in everything they make, but that's what you expect anyway. But then again, I found it more digestible than anything I've ordered at Sparky's or Golden Coffee Shop. Staff is friendly but not in a kiss-mah-grits kind of way.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...greasy diner fare satisfies if you're in the mood\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...roadside formica in the middle of the Mission\nSERVICE - 3 stars...friendly but not too much\nTOTAL - 3 stars...not bad for what it is", "author": "Ed U."}

In terms of ambiance, this place fits that mold perfectly. The diner-style counters, the old booths, being able to see into the kitchen... love it. The service was also great-- very attentive and very nice. Sadly, the food just wasn't up to snuff. I am no snob when it comes to diner food, but they really let me down. \n\nFirst of all, the coffee is TERRIBLE! I can drink Folgers with the best of them, but their coffee is just absolutely disgusting. I've never had coffee so bad. Really, a diner can get away with almost anything as long as they have good coffee. You'd think they would be able to address that...\n\nI ordered the country breakfast, which comes with two eggs, meat, and pancakes (you can substitute a waffle for the pancakes for 2 bucks, which I did). The waffles by themselves cost $5 and are definitely pre-made and frozen. Mine was flat, hard as a board, and cold when they brought it out. In fact, none of my food (except the coffee) came out hot. It's strange, because I could see them preparing it... maybe they put everything on cold plates or something? Even the eggs, I ordered them sunny-side up, were not hot. For two bucks more I added an order of hash browns. Their hash browns are nothing more than grated potatoes. They don't add onion, peppers, ANYTHING. Very plain. Thankfully they had some green salsa on the counter that I was able to cover them with.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that this place actually serves sausage patties instead of sausage links, which is cool... I ordered the bacon as my meat, and was happy to find that you get 4 slices instead of the typical 2.\n\nAll in all, this place just doesn't cut it for me.

The waitstaff was friendly and food came out quickly.\n\nMy friend ordered the country fried steak and I got the french toast. The country fried steak reminded me of Texas... perfectly fried without being too greasy or salty, covered in white gravy. My friend also got eggs over easy, which made the yolk and gravy mixture perfect. My french toast was delicious! They used thicker pieces of (what tasted like) potato bread, and the sweet and savory mixture was perfect. And what made the breakfast really great was that they gave us a MIXING BOWL of jalapenos. No one would ever be in need for those delicious peppers!\n\nPrices were very reasonable and the restaurant was pretty clean. I would definitely stop by again!", "author": "Becky K."}

I dropped in for a late lunch at about 2:30ish on a Wednesday afternoon, I was alone but had high hopes because of all the intrigue of reviews on yelp. I notice their lunch special listed on in the window, Chicken Teriyaki, I know this is not a Japanese noodle house but my instinct just wanted to give this 'ole diner a try. There was only one other patron in here she looked like she had a decent dine, so why shouldn't I? \n\nHere's where it got weird. I don't know what affiliation they had with the restaurant, but this one little Latino man was leaning against the glass, does the \"looking in\" thing with his hands and then starts texting on his phone. I sat in the booth right up front so I couldn't help but to peer out toward the streets while I waited for my order. He then popped into the Restaurant and yelled something to the cook, maybe just saying hello? Maybe he worked there, knew someone there, I really just don't know. \n\nThe only other woman in there just finished her meal, she just left some cash on the table, her bill had not arrived yet.  So now I was the sole patron in the establishment.\n \nAnother little man passes the restaurant... then backtracks sticks his face in the window from the booth that I am stationed at, he then enters the restaurant then hangs over the booth that I am seated at.  Okay at this point I am feeling super uncomfortable like I was in middle of some kind of inner sting operation, and sure enough through the window I see a truck slowing down, the random stranger who was hanging over my booth let's out a shrill whistle as the driver of the truck pauses.   Sketchy little guy wheels a fancy land cruiser bike on to the back of the truck, and then the truck screeches off down Mission street.  Dude gives me a look of death just as bad as shaking a finger in my face and saying, I saw nothing. \n\nThen my food arrived, I took a few bites then was just so bothered that I completely lost my appetite, the bill was about 7 dollars so I threw ten on the table, waved to the waitress and just hi tailed the eff outta there.  \n\nSorry not coming back... ever.", "author": "B H."}

You know, Latino families, Hipsters, yuppies etc. \nSo when we arrived we noticed that the counter was relatively empty and we asked if we could take a seat. There was no hostess and the waitress's' were too busy to really help out. \nWe took our seat and one of the waitress's was right there waiting to take our order. Perfect! Let's order! So we did.\nWell, we ended up waiting a little over a half hour (seriously) for our order. That would not have been such a bad thing but two little old men arrived (separately) about 10 minutes and 15 minutes (respectively) after we did and both of them got their breakfast way before us!\nNot only this, but a table of 3 construction workers arrived about 10 minutes after we did and they got their order a few minutes before we did. \nI asked the waitress if they forgot our order and she said that they were short staffed in the back. \nYeah, right.\nIf they were short staffed then why was everyone's order coming out before ours? And in a timely manner. \nI honestly think that she forgot to put our order in or they forgot to cook it.

My one gripe is that outside of Sparky's and The Lucky Penny (or The Hep C Palace as we like to call it), there is a sad and shocking lack of diners. I lived in NY for two years and got used to being able to get a big greasy breakfast any time of day or night. Not so here. Today I found Jim's. I was home.\n\nMy one complaint about Jim's is that it is only open from 7am to 3:30pm. These guys are missing a major opportunity here...the late night drunk hipsters would PACK this place 7 nights a week between 9pm and 3am. Truly. \n\nThe ambiance is just what you want - old black booth line every wall and even some space in the middle of the restaurant. Formica tables. One waitress who is friendly enough but leaves you alone for the most part. Simple, straightforward menu. The tuna sandwich with fries was great - perfect, in fact. Bottomless iced tea. The tuna melt my co-worker had looked great as well. Perhaps the best part? The prices! $5.50 for a great lunch! Can't beat that with a stick. Well, you could, but it wouldn't taste very good afterward.\n\nOh! And the people watching and overheard conversations are PRICELESS.\n\nI love Jim's. Its my new favorite place.

I come from the land of greasy road-side diners, full of buttery-golden hashbrowns, greasy eggs, buttered toast and dirty-sock coffee. Sometimes, I'm feeling nostalgic and I need it here. I've been on the SEARCH since I moved here nearly a YEAR ago for the equivalent of my old haunt in St. Louis (THE BUTTERY, it was called....oh, man....my mouth waters just THINKING about it). The problem out here is that price gets out of hand. Who the hell does a diner think it is when it's charging $6 for some egg, potato, and bread? GIVE ME A BREAK!\n\nSo, I wandered in here, assuming the worst/expecting the same thing I've gotten all around town. \n\nYou choose your own table here, and there's plenty to choose from. The barstools don't even look uncomfortable. The waitress was right there for us just seconds after we sat, asking if we'd like some coffee. \n\nAnd then I saw it: $3.95 for two eggs, toast, and hashbrowns. Oh, Jim...I'll have your babies, now.\n\nSo...we dined. Our food was out a mere 5-10 minutes or so after ordering, and they were pretty busy! \n\nThe food was perfect. OH, how you could taste the butter in the 'browns. The eggs were immaculate, perfecting the definition of \"sunny side up.\" The toast was buttered and served with one packet of jame PER PIECE...no cheapskates here. \n\nMy friend got the chicken-fried steak. He said it was exactly what he'd hoped for.\n\nOur server was great.

I'd give it another half star if I could. Jim's is, aspires to be, and should be a classic American diner. With pleather booths, a long counter with swivel stools and ginormous indoor plants, it looks every bit like something in the Central Valley or the Midwest.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-03", "description": "food is inexpensive  and good but the only draw back is the restroom!  It's horrible!  I was spooked when I went up those stairs and surprised and disappointed to see a yucky looking and vandalized restroom. what is the owner thinking? How could the owner let the place look that way.I would be embarrassed if it were my business. Why hasn't the Health Department forced the owner to clean it up? i really don't care to go back to that place.   its too bad. But i guess the location is what keeps the prices reasonably low.", "author": "Lucy H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-13", "description": "Before I launch into why this sucked, I'll preface my review with the fact that this was a to-go order. I only spent 5 min inside and didn't really get a grasp on the atmosphere or the staff. \n\nSo.. I woke up and I wanted pancakes or a waffle or french toast. I definitely didn't want a breakfast burrito which is so readily available in my hood. Boogaloo's was not taking to-go orders because it was too busy. And as much as I love Boogaloo's, I simply didn't have to patience to wait in that line. \n\n\"Yelp! Yelp would lead me to a comparable substitute\" - I thought. Yelp lead me to Jim's Restaurant which is 2 blocks from my house and the menu is ample with all of my cravings. I got the waffle with two strips of bacon and strawberry preserves with whipped cream on the side.  \n\nUhmmm yeah... I should have either gotten a breakfast burrito or waited for my beloved Boogaloos. I am pretty sure that the soles of my trusty 5 year-old grey converses have more flavor and a better texture than the waffle I ordered. \n\nDon't get me started on the bacon. I think it was made yesterday. \n\nDon't get me started on the strawberry preserves either. They were red. I think that's the only thing that they have in common with a strawberry. \n\nSo yeah.. Jim's... please make better food. I'd like to like you and I'd like to eat at your establishment. ... So pretty pleaaaaase? With a cherry on top?", "author": "A K."}

This place is known for the steak sandwich.  I ordered it once and it was so chewy I lost 100lbs from excessive chewing.  The best thing here are the burgers and pancakes.  I can make everything else at home including the pancakes and burgers.  This place is on the more expensive side for a diner.  If the food was cheaper I would give it a 3 stars.  But for price to value its not that great.", "author": "Fatty A."}

It had burnt down years ago and greasy spoon or not, it was a great, inexpensive place to hang out, get a quick cheap breakfast and coffee and be on my merry way.  If it is...then my rating stands.  If not...I'll have to go and check it otu myself.", "author": "O .."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-06-02", "description": "I was really hyped up to try this place because we could always use more good breakfast places in the 'deep mish'. Unfortunately, I left feeling eh. Service was definitely friendly but selection was pretty bare bones. I got the onion and avocado omelette. When they say avocado, they mean dumping the entire half smack in the middle of the omelette. I would have preferred if they took a quick second to slice it up and disperse evenly. Yes, I'm nitpicking.  In general, I would go back here if my other top breakfast places have a long line.", "author": "Susan L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-03-31", "description": "We recently had our last meal at Jim's - We used to go there pretty often on Sundays for a cheap breakfast or lunch. The last two times we had bad service. This last visit we were seated at a filthy table, had to wait 20 minutes for someone to come and clean it and finally take our order. Another 30 minutes for our food to arrive (no coffee refills while waiting - impossible to get waitress's attention) only to discover that my grilled cheese sandwich didnt even have melted cheese and the fries were barely cooked. They took it back and didn't charge me but I left hungry and grabbed a burrito on the way home", "author": "Bumble B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-16", "description": "It's a plateload of calories for cheap.  Breakfast served all day with quite a few booths to sit at.  Average quality but fairly large portions.  My wife thinks the eggs and coffee could be better for a breakfast place, and I would tend to agree.  I had bacon and eggs, and everything kinda smelled like movie popcorn butter.  Even the bacon.  I won't deny that it was good, but probably only 3 stars good.  Indeed, the bathroom was less than stellar, but functional.", "author": "Willis W."}

Their prices are really cheap and you leave really full.. I love the breakfast scrambled eggs and two sausages with hash brown and wheat toast mm mm, the best and its only like $5.50. Also try their current specials which is Hot dog delight it's really good and their Teryiaki one too I'm not too crazy about the white rice but over all it's good. Almost everything they have here looks and taste very good. As for the waitresses I preferred Maria she's so nice and checks up on you or suggests things she's the best so make sure to tip her !

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-17", "description": "this is one of my more favorite diners in san francisco, land of over priced eggs and bacon with inexplicable lines waiting for mediocre food. this and lucky penny. so far, i've never had to wait for a table at jim's and i pray that the gentrification crowd never finds it or its landlord, so that it stays cheap and pleasant forever. nice friendly family environment, and at the same time not judgmental/ suspicious of those of us who may be less traditional. out of four pieces of bacon, i'd say one was delicious, two ok, and one dry and overcooked. i love their buttery hash browns, but i'm not a super healthy eater; dieters probably should avoid this place. the chicken fried steak is surprisingly good although the gravy a little odd (from a freeze dried package?). the cheeseburger & fries are pretty decent. coffee is average, but i like diner coffee, being from the East Coast and an avid fan of road tripping... the bathroom is kind of scary - not recommended. best part - you can have a whole meal for about five bucks plus tip.", "author": "Dorothy W."}
