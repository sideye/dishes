Being next to the Stockton Tunnel probably doesn't add to the fancy points but it's cheap, efficient, and all-in, pretty tasty. \n\nAll the usual faves like burritos, tacos, and quesadillas but they also have more homey classics like sopes and mole poblano. Also burgers and salads plus a whole host of entree plates. My lunch go-to is a baby burrito and I find it to be right-sized for a satisfying lunch that doesn't weigh you down. Lots of meat options from your regular carne asada and carnitas to not so common barbacoa and lengua. Breakfast burritos are also super welcomed on slightly hungover mornings. \n\nFolks are friendly here and try to get you in and out quickly. Major plus that they take cards too. For a cheap lunch by Union Square, Taqueria Mana is modest looking and slightly off the beaten path, but more than handles itself with it's wide menu.", "author": "Jon L."}

I saw some people back in the kitchen but I wasn't sure what they were doing.  So, they're not as quick as other taquerias.  I waited probably about 10 minutes or so for my burrito.  \n\nPrices aren't bad, but they're still not as cheap as Gordo's or other taquerias, but this is probably due to the location.

The meat tasted like it was day-old, or maybe worse. It was super dry and nearly rock hard. Not good at all. The rest of the burrito was passable, but the rice and beans had obviously been sitting around for quite a while. The enchilada sauce was okay, but not overly flavorful. The \"salsa\" on the tables had a good kick to it, but absolutely no flavor.

I was encouraged by the much nicer interior; they had really spruced up the place from what I remember.

Let me elaborate...\n\nI work down the street from this location. Me and my coworkers are all huge burrito fans and have tried every place that serves a burrito within a mile radius (unfortunately you can't get Mission quality in FiDi, sad). If you are a fan of cheese then this is NOT the place for you, the quality of cheese they use is a frankly disgusting deli sliced cheese (I've worked in Mexican/Tex Mex style restaurants for years and would never try and get away with using something of that quality, but again this is the owners fault not the staff). I am compelled to write this review because I feel physically sick/nauseous after eating my burrito.\n\nI also ordered the carnitas which tasted old with a dry and hard texture, likely not made fresh and portioned incorrectly for the amount they turnover/sell. Sour cream tastes old as well. Requesting \"spicy\" food will not get you spicy food, as if expected to add their spicy salsa yourself (impractical for an online order as I do this for lack of time and explicitly say it in the notes). This is my one employee complaint because I requested something that wasn't done and it was not addressed to me (\"hey we can't make it spicy\"), I instead find out after my first bite.\n\nHonestly I want to give this place a better rating, it's cool/small/friendly/convenient but the food is just sub par and an embarrassment to the Mexican food culture of SF. I never feel like writing a review (good or bad) because I don't have the time, but wanted to take the time to put one down here because I've had this recurring issue the last several times I have ordered here and hope to save others in the neighborhood who enjoy quality Mexican food the time and $8-$10. \n\nThis is my final farewell to Taqueria Mana, I'll start making my burritos at home since that is the only way I will be able to get fresh/quality ingredients in my food in this area (I've joked that I need to open a burrito restaurant in this area since there are few in downtown that serve anything close to the quality in South City or the East Bay). Sorry guys, I tried to overlook these issues but it's too prevalent to merit return business and my office is now boycotting this location  and switching to Uno Dos Taco (smaller portions but you don't vomit them afterwards). \n\nI'm not sure if the owner is just cheap/stingy or simply unaware of how low quality these ingredients are compared to other taquerias; the cost difference between their ingredients and yours cannot be worth losing customers. Then again maybe your repeat customers simply don't mind, we however will not be returning.", "author": "Joseph W."}

Each taco is served on a double corn tortilla (not freshly griddled, but from a bag) with the meat of your choice, onions, salsa and cilantro.  They offer about nine fillings that could be added to a variety of Mexican dishes besides tacos.  The tacos tasted like something from a Mission taco truck: authentic and good value for the price, but no competition to the more gourmet nouveau tacos popping up around town.  It's an OK place; they do a decent job of taqueria food just as is done at many other decent taquerias.\n\nCarne Asada: At least the cubes had a good singe to them.  The flavor was lacking and it was a bit tough.\n\nPastor: Nice crispy cubes of pork with loads of seasoning.  Probably my favorite here.\n\nCarnitas: Achieved the difficult task of having crisp portions and moist portions.  It was tasty, though a little bland.\n\nChorizo: Super rich and full of spices.

I wouldn't say it was pricey, but for the quality of the food, I would say it was definitely overpriced. This was subpar mexican food. I've had better TexMex parading as Mexican fare. Everything was flavorless, the rice was overcooked, but underdone (I don't even know how you can accomplish that). The steak was tough and gristly and drowning in tomato paste. Shrimp quesadillas were soggy and the shrimp overcooked. Everything came in paper take out boxes, which were totally soggy and structural unsound by the time they arrived at the house. And a thing about the delivery: the average delivery time is estimated to be between 30 and 45 minutes,  yet our food arrived over an hour later, just shy of 90 minutes. And to top it off, they subbed peach Kerns instead, and didn't even warn me. Needless to say, my little man was disappointed. \nCold, flavorless, and unsatisfying.

I actually wandered into this place by accident while taking a Sunday morning stroll through Chinatown, and was somewhat disappointed at first, because I made a cardinal error: when they asked me if I wanted a super taco, I told them no, I just wanted a regular taco. \n\nWhat I *should* have said, as it turns out, is that I wanted a mini taco, which is what I typically envision when I say \"regular taco\" - a couple little torn tortillas, some meat, some onions, some cilantro, some salsa. Here, \"regular tacos\" are the same as mini tacos, except that they have beans on top, which is a *terrible* idea. The bean-juice soaks into the tortillas and makes 'em all soggy, and beans are inferior to delicious meat anyway, so it's not a great scenario. \n\nBut, once I realized how to correct my mistake and also factored in how close this place is to the office, I resolved to return. And they did not disappoint. Every kind of meat here is actually pretty good. None of them particularly excels, but none disappoints, which is more than I can say about a lot of taquerias - their lengua, their al pastor, their carnitas, all traditional and tasty. \n\nI'd give Taqueria Mana three stars if it weren't for its location, but when I keep in mind the fact that I'll be going here about three times a week for the next few months, I can't help but go for four.

The problem was I had the ground beef, which isn't the greatest compliment to their burritos. For the next few months, I went here off and on--just having the chicken, ground beef, or carne asada. Nothing too special.\n\nThen one day...I saw this item called chile verde. Thinking of the literal translation, I thought I would be ordering a veggie dish, and wanted something different from chicken and beef so chile verde it was. And oh boy, chile verde it would be for weeks to come! Damn, their chile verde is so freakin' good. I thought this pork dish I had just discovered was so awesome I had to try to find different concoctions from other taquerias. Unfortunately, every other one has been a disappointment when compared to Mana. But I always knew where to turn for the next few months for some great stewed pork.\n\nMy chile verde bliss would soon end one day. I came into the place and saw the guy behind the counter making a burrito but there was nobody in the place. He told me it was for himself. I asked him what was in it, and he said carnitas. I asked him to make me the same. The first bite of this burrito showed me what awesome was. Since I have gotten the carnitas almost every time with the exception of a couple times when chile verde seemed like an acceptable alternative.\n\nHere's my go to lineup:\nSuper burrito: carnitas (of course), black beans, pico and hot salsa, no guac.\n\nThe no guac is up to you.

I've had the burrito (granted I'm picky and switch the salsa for cheese), Carne Asada plate, and two other plate's which for the life of me I can't remember the name. They're the two next to the Carne Asada plate on the hanging menus (short people beware, you're not going to see over the cabinet to read the names).\n\nThe three guys who work here (there are three, one works the day, usually with a lady, then it's mustachio man [who's mi Amigo] and a newer guy who looks a little greasy) are all good guys.\n\nTo those who spent maybe 30 minutes here watching them, I say BAH to your reviews of their hand washing. EVERY TIME I show up they wash their hands if they haven't been handling food. Usually grease man is handling the cash while Amigo is rocking the food. If vice versa the hands are washed.\n\nThe Carne asada can come out a little dry, but it can do that at any authentic Taqueria, and I've eaten at tons both in SF, Mexico and other Latin American countries. In the Burritos it makes for a fantastic burrito unless you like a sloppy joe of a Burrito. In that case I'll recommend El Farro where your burrito subscribes to Carl's Jr.'s former advertising campaign of \"If it doesn't get all over the place it doesn't belong in your face\".\n\nThe Carne Asada plate is phenomenal if you ask for it spicy. I ask for as hot as they can make it (and it still isn't quite hot enough) but it's ridiculously tasty and good. I eat here at least twice a week and never have had an issue with the food, cleanliness or anything else other than the Muni drivers using the bathroom without buying anything.\n\nAdditioanlly, what other Taqueria is going to offer you, flour, corn, spinach, and about 2 other types of tortillas for your burrito? I've yet to be offered that selection anywhere else. The spinach tortilla's are fantastic.\n\nTaqueria Mana, a little slice of Mexico near Chinatown.", "author": "N S."}

Second, the service is prompt, and there is very little wait (the restaurant is sort of in tucked away right next to the stockton tunnel...so not much traffic).  Third, has more to do with location more than anything else.  While the food is good, it probably doesn' t warrant four stars by Mission standards.
