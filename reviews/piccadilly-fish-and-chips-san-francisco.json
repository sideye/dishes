This Yelp review should have been written 3 years ago but I've been busy and kept pushing to next day until today after I had some Piccadilly Fish & Chips, I HAD to write one :D It is a regular battered fish/vegetables fried in their fryer and no sadly they do not carry beer batters!

You guys should try the mushrooms or the zucchinis because those are the juiciest! Mmm.. Yummy! Almost forgot about their scallops and oysters but they no longer carry oysters for temporary!

Piccadilly, you have taken my breath away (:\nOn a side note, they have fried chicken too! Sometimes they have wings and sometimes they have the whole 4 pieces set which I love the most when it comes down to chicken. It is honey battered and the crisp on that is so unbelievable! Can't forget about their homemade Tar Tar sauce! Yes they charge 25cents for one just like how any other San Francisco CORPORATE Mc Donald's charge for their sauce! I mean I don't mind paying for a family owned restaurant but Mc Donald's?! I'll save that for their review. Hehe. It's really cheap people, I can NEVER understand people when they complain about how expensive it is but people it really isn't AND it is by far the CHEAPEST Fish & Chips joint! \nLast of all, parking is NOT easy over here!

They're CASH only!\n\nP.S.\nI honestly don't understand how people given such low ratings on this joint!!

Better in some regards since they cook everything to order rather than have them stacked in the warming case above the fryer. I get home a couple of times a year and Piccadilly rates with all but the very best I've had. They have a authentic, classic 1950's fryer from Cardiff, Wales which only makes everything better. They will serve the \"scraps\" from the fryer (loose bits of crispy batter that come off the fish and are strained out of the oil into a scraps tray) if you ask for them. Adding these to your chips is the best since it combines the nice fluffy chips with a real crunch.

I love getting the 2 piece fish with chips to split with one other and I'll lather my fish with vinegar. The fish is always the perfect crispy goodness and balanced with really soft (not stringy or dry), buttery white fish. Of course, all of this goes perfectly with their standard wedge style fries aka chips :). \n\nThis place is quite the hole in the wall with very little fuss or decor.

A once a vibrant little mom-and-pop restaurant serving quality comfort food in a blue-collar neighborhood next to a still standing elementary school today is no longer.  The original owners have long passed and their descendants took over.  I gather ownership changed again as a recent visit made it brutally evident. \n\nSummary: detestable food, service, and facilities.  Its a shack masquerading as a restaurant thats barely staying afloat.  If you don't want to serve quality food within cleanly facilities with a smile and can barely speak English, then why are you independently operating a restaurant in the U.S.?  Wouldn't be surprised to see their makeshift \"Cash Only\" sign replaced with a 'For Lease' sign come December.\n\nOne night, I brought my friend.  First, I tried to greet the folks behind the counter with a 'Hello' and handshake.  The woman/wife glared at me with horror as though I were ripe with disease.  I politely backed off as it was clear she didn't want to hear about my childhood visits.  She and her husband immediately snarled, \"No English! No English!\"  Fine.  We then eyeballed the fading menu.  We got the 2-piece fish and chips and an order of onion rings.  Now a vegetarian, I asked if they fried their meats separately from their veggies.  The man barked \"Fries here! Fish here! Onions here!\", firmly pointing to each deep-fryer.  Thanks for clarifying, Mr. Manners. I paid nearly $14 for it all.  As we waited for our food, we noted the restaurant's disgusting condition. \n\nThe floor and tables were greasy and dirty.  The closet of a restroom was dirty, tagged with graffiti, and dilapidated.  I had to feel my way to the light switch!  The smell of rotting grease filled the air.  Do they empty and clean their fryers?  Upon serving our food, their body language was stiff as they looked reluctant to serve us, the only patrons present.  Each piece of fish was next to the veggies.  To be safe, I asked the man to identify and confirm.  He barked \"This fish! This onion rings! This fries!\"  Even so, I clearly could tell otherwise.  My omnivorous friend was able to confirm my suspicions and told me the opposite.  When we both took a bite, the food was flavorless.  \n\nMy intuitions screamed louder every minute we remained.  Ultimately, I insisted we spare our stomachs, kidneys, and the night!  Although I wasted $14, I valued our friendship and wellbeing more.  I thanked the owner while telling him he could keep my money.  He snarled something in his native tongue as we headed for the door.

She says she would give it another try. \n\nIt is a while later now and I experienced stomach cramps and loose stools. I don't think I will be going back. \n\nThe frying grease is most likely at too low of a temperature or too old. At a low temperature it does not burn as fast and you can use it to fry more meals but, it causes the issues I discussed. Soggy fries and soggy fish in a crunchy batter.", "author": "Morgan H."}

He had been once before quite awhile ago, and remembered it being alright. \n\nThe place was empty. We ordered some chips to share. We saw a decent/average amount of chips go into the fryer, but then after a few minutes, another customer walked in and ordered some fish and chips, but they didn't put any more chips into the fryer!\nSo, I'm not sure what happened, but all I can say is for $3, our portion of chips was RIDICULOUSLY small. I mean, there were only about  8 fries. It was pathetic and we were upset.  He asked if we wanted them salted and malted, and when I walked over to get our order my jaw dropped at the tiny portion. We think the other customer got our other half of the chips, since no more were added to the fryer for his order. It was incredibly lame. The chips were merely average as well, and they seemed under fried. They were kinda mushy and gummy. I was not impressed by any means. \n\nI will not be coming back. \n\n1 star for having a Fish & Chip shop in SF, but come on? How are you going to charge so much?

He always seems to be happy and genuinely welcomes all of the patrons as soon as they open the door.\n\nIt's a pretty basic set up.  There is an overhead menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=7HDhwAft71dZpuahpp0VPA) that you order from, and I've noticed most people do take out.  I've always had my food there on one of the sturdy wooden chairs and wobbly wooden tables.  The restaurant has updated copies of the daily Examiner or the latest SF Weekly to keep patrons informed while they wait for their food.\n\nFor tonight's visit I had a 3 piece fish with chips (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=lA-mFqLiaNIfdI-MA2Dm3Q).  When dining at the restaurant you have the option of adding your own salt and malt vinegar whereas for take out they'll actually add it for you before wrapping your order with a clean sheet of white paper with newspaper on the outside.  Tartar sauce is available upon request as it is usually stored inside the refrigerator.\n\nI decided to have my meal without the added salt, vinegar or tartar sauce for a change.  The fish is very good.  The choice filets of white fish are thick and firm and the crispy batter has just a tad of seasoning in it to keep it from tasting bland.  The chips or fries (because that's what they are) could be improved because no matter how long they sit in the fryer the outsides never seem to be crispy enough.  These are fat fries with lots of meat in the middle, but often I tend to taste the oil instead of the actual potato.\n\nIf you're not certain what you'd like to try Piccadilly offers a combination platter also.  The combination includes one piece of fish, two pieces of shrimp, three oysters and four onion rings all served over a layer of fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haF3hGlqzeLYmNJ-0cq5yA?select=3p7MjyVby4e8IwjXltHA1g).  All of the seafood and the fresh rings of white onion are dipped in the same batter and put into the fryer.  While I enjoyed the flattened, butterflied shrimps and the mini oysters the hot, creamy onions just didn't seem to taste right when matched with the batter.\n\nI love the fried mushrooms too.  Friendly service.  Open until 11 PM on most nights.  Pay before you eat or after.  Cash only.  Maybe 3.5 stars but I've rounded up this time because the old guy's smile is infectious.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

I would recommend dining OUT b/c there is very limited seating and honestly, it really is a HOLE in the wall. \n\nThere is tartar sauce, salt and malt vinegar...simple, simple, simple...it's fried fish (aiyah, my arteries must be hating ME today)\n\nEnough said!", "author": "Hiromi N."}

They also charge 25 cents for each container of tarter sauce, which also was a disappointment, although I do realize that costs of food is rising, still I have never been charged anywhere for a condiment. Word of advice, when you do take out, and you finally open the paper package, the steam from the food takes the crispiness out of the fish and makes the french fries soggy.

We also bought a can soda for $1.00 each. \n\nNiece bumped into one of her friends and orders her food to go. After her friend and I were formally introduced, I saw that all meals taken to go are wrapped in a newspaper. And believe it or not, it was the comic-section from the San Francisco Chronicle.

Later, CB kicked Snoopy out, because of the dog's loud snoring. Then, CB gave Snoopy another chance. And it was CB's turn to loudly snore. Finally, CB was sleeping on top of Snoopy's dog-house.

The items are made to order, so your order is piping hot when you get it.  I got the sampler with fish, onion rings, fries, oysters and shrimp.  The shrimp was a bit salty, but the rest of the stuff was just right.  The shrimp and oysters have a tight breaded and fried, whereas the onion rings and fish were dipped in a batter.  After getting halfway through this stuff, I couldn't eat anymore batter, not because it tasted bad, but because I'm on a diet.  I suppose stripping off the batter from 1/2 of the fish and onion rings qualifies this to be low/reduced fat.\n\nI couldn't eat here more than once a month, but that's just me.

The fish and chips here beats most. Yes, they're just fish and chips, but they use cod, not pollock, which has a much better texture and flavor. Also, their cod isn't frozen, unfrozen and refrozen multiple times along the supply chain, the way many other joints' are. \n\nIn addition to classic fish and chips (with a good dose of malt vinegar, if you like it that way - which I do), they also have other items like zucchini, squid, onion rings and chicken. \n\nThe joint has been with the same (extended) Korean family for a while - believe the part of the family that's running it today is also the family that used to run a Scottish pub, Edinburgh Castle, back in the 90s.", "author": "Jay K."}

And I have to say that the chips are pretty authentic and very tasty. Their the correct large size, slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and not too much grease - great with vinegar of course! It's a shame they don't get much traffic as it means they have to fry the chips each time you order rather than real \"fast food\".\n\nThe fish is a let-down though. I've never had good fish and chips in the US and I wonder if it's just because they don't (can't?) use fresh fish. It always seems to be very small pieces of fish that have been frozen. When they are fried, the texture is just completely off, with an unfortunate reconstituted feel. Inedible unfortunately.\n\nWith this fish problem, it would be great if they could add some easier staples to the menu like battered sausages and spam fritters.

I have lived in San Francisco for almost 10 years and only been here one time before. I had just returned from an amazing Summer trip home and had a craving for some great Fish and chips. From what I remembered it was OK. I had a bad feeling from the moment I tried to order. The elderly gentleman did not speak English. I had to show him my fingers so he understood how many pieces I wanted. When he placed the fish in the oil it didn't even sizzle. I knew with the oil not being hot enough they were going to soak up all the grease :( And they did. Whats worse was there was hardly any fish in the batter! Maybe a couple of bites! While the fish was cooking I wondered when are they going to put the chips on? Another man came to help and took out pre made chips from a warming tray. WHAT? I asked him...so you dont make the chips fresh? I asked him could you make the chips fresh for me? But he didn't speak English either. They looked greasy, soggy and cold. I was already depressed thinking about them. What a disappointment. The bundles of chips were tepid at best. After driving home I then had to re heat them in my toaster over. I will definitely not be visiting here again. Its not rocket science to cook fish and chips. Use hot oil and cook each order fresh and you are sure to get repeat customers.

Now I don't know what it looked like before the burned down, but it really wasn't an eyecatcher.  It seemed pretty bare, except for the giant fryers behind the counter.  While the menu seemed very lengthy with various seafood options, we settled on a 5-piece fish and chips meal with a side of onion rings.  Someone wasn't kidding about the grease.  While it was tasty, I definitely felt like a few zits were ready to form.  I'm pretty sure it was grease oozing out of the fish and onion rings.  A little too much for me....grease that is.

Basically, this was the best fish and chips place out there in the city, but now I'm not sure how I feel about it.  I came by today with my father (like old times) and to our surprise, there was an unfamiliar face working behind the counter.  But this couldn't be.  I mean, the Piccadilly I knew had an elderly Korean couple working there, the sweetest people who enjoyed what they did at the shop.  We'd walk in, and we would always be greeted by the couple with warm smiles on their faces.  My favorite item on the menu?  Oyster and chips...with lots of malt vinegar...and a root beer on the side.  But then I realized that the outside of the shop did look a bit updated, the menu had slight changes (which showed that they no longer serve/cook deep fried squid), the root beer bottles in the fridge were replaced by canned soda, and the old cash register that never worked (but made a cute prop) was gone.  While I was waiting for my order, a sweet older woman came by and asked the man, \"Do you remember me?  I always sit over there (pointing towards the window seating area). And I always order the squid and the chips.\"  Now you see, the original owners would most of the time remember their customers. The old man was confused, and barely spoke english.  I felt bad on both ends.  Even when I got my order, the size was much smaller.  The oysters were tiny, but still really tasty.  And some of the chips didn't taste fully cooked.  Despite my slight disappointment in my visit/order today, I still think Piccadilly is the best out there.  And I'm really going to miss that sweet old couple who made my visits quite special.  I only hope for the best for the new Piccadilly!", "author": "Jasmine T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-29", "description": "Piccadilly Fish & Chips has ruined me insofar as the fish and chips are so good I will accept no substitute (even though I have subsequently tried the fish and chips at other restaurants numbering in the double digits). The experience starts with the location, in the night life hub of Polk Gulch (don't accept the euphemistic other name that is used for that area!). After playing a live punk show in the nearby Kimo's bar, nothing is more satisfying then walking into Piccadilly later in the evening and smelling the aroma of delicious oil in the air, and viewing the spectacular sight of the imported (and aesthetically pleasing) English deep fryers. The star of the show is the fresh cod and potatoes used for the fish and chips, and this is what I would recommend one to order. The price is fantastic for the quality, and the rapidity of the cuisine creation is delightful. The fish and chips come finely wrapped in the newsprint of that week. The savory odor of the oil, breading, and fish is further drawn out when the vinegar is applied to the ensemble. The wonderful vinegar smell flies upward to the nose, causing a Pavlovian generation of saliva and awakening the taste buds for the pleasure that is about to ensue. The fish itself absolutely does not taste fishy, which is the first major reason that I find these fish and chips superior. The second is the quality and taste of the breading (who's ingredients and method of preparation remain a mystery to me). The potatoes are just of the right thickness and flavor to counterbalance the lightness and intransigence of the fish. My ideal accompaniment to the meal is a chilled can of Diet Coke, and for me the best way to enjoy any freshly deep fried food is when it is so hot that it must be washed down with cool liquids of some kind to avoid burning the mouth and tongue. The memory of the taste of the fish and smell of the aroma of the oils will haunt you for hours after leaving, reminding you of the multitude of delights that you just experienced.", "author": "Benjamin V."}
