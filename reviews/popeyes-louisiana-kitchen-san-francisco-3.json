Paid, got my ticket and drink, it really only took a few minutes and my food was ready, hot and fresh and delivered to me.\n\nMenu boards are overhead at the counter, with multiple choices and options. There's a small \"dining\" area along with a few window seats, otherwise most folks get it to go. Which was my intent and plan.\n\nThe food is Popeyes norm, the beans and rice are/were good as was/is the mac n cheese, the spicy chicken nicely fried, moist and tender, and piping hot. The biscuits were good as well, flavorful and tender lightly golden brown. A good option for fast food.\n\nThis little shops location is in a very busy Safeway parking lot with no drive through. So you have to park and walk in, the only downside. \n\n3 Stars it serves its purpose\n\n00591", "author": "Ray F."}

The buffalo bayou sauce, which is really just Louisiana hot sauce, was the perfect dipping sauce for the chicken. \n\nI do have to take away one star though, because while I was eating my food, several customers tried to order items like cajun rice and jambalaya only to be told that Popeye's was out of them.

Look  people who eat at this location, you can walk the few extra feet to Safeway, and get 2 pieces of chicken, for the same price or not much more. And, you can have a choice of rotisserie or fried. The employees, will actually talk to you politely, and without stank attitude. If everyone went there, and Popeyes saw a decline in their profits, they would have to re-think the way they do business.", "author": "Ebony S."}

To say the crowd was 'interesting' would probably be the understatement of the year, but I tried to remain positive so I figured at least it was entertaining.  That soon changed.  \n\nWow, I'm not kidding when I say this place is GHETTO!!!!  Unreal what people will go through to get a killer deal, but honestly, it was in the area, I was hungry, and fortunately, it was really good!

Things were much better this time although still slow.\n\nNoticed everyone was placing three orders (you can order up to four specials) so I figured why not as it's only three dollars for six pieces.  At that price, I ordered both regular and spicy.  Despite the crazy line and crowds, the chicken was super hot and fresh out of the kitchen when I checked my order (a must at any fast food place before leaving nowadays) so we decided to drive down to the marina green and eat it out there by the yacht club.  Stopped at a couple other places to pick up a few more things to eat and it turned into a really pleasant lunch by the water.\n\nI should be embarassed to admit this, but I was so hungry and I haven't had anything this bad for me (it was so bad that it was good!) in such a long time that I tore through it like a great white shark on a feeding frenzy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-07-09", "description": "An Afro-american woman accompanied by four children tried to order four orders of the Tuesday 2 for 99cent specials, but was told that there is a \"two per family limit\". Since there was five in her party, did the employee expect one of the kids to just watch the other four eat? I then intervened & offered to let her use one of my \"two per family limit\" so that she'd end up w/ six pieces. I ordered one order for myself. \n\nThe cashier glared at me for assisting the woman & retaliated by making me wait for my order. When the woman (who was dining in store) asked for some kind of plates that the kids could eat off of, she was charged 25 cents each. Another customer also asked for sauce & was levied 25 cents each. Popeyes claims they do not charge for them, so I assume the cashier was pocketing the money.\n\nAnyhow, long after the woman's orders were filled, I asked where mine was. I was told, \"Still waiting!\" After about 15 minutes, I got impatient & asked again. The cashier pulled my order which was sitting on the side (NOT under the heat lamps) & shoved it towards me. It was of course, no longer hot. I confronted her as to why she was playing games. She pretended not to understand then I asked for her name & a contact number. She refused.She openly boasted that that is an independently-owned franchise & that even if I complained, it'll never get to corporate but to the owner, who will side w/ her.\n\nIt turns out she was correct. Although I've called the 877-767-3937 number, I've never been able to speak to anyone to address the problems in this store. Problems plural.\n\nSeveral months before this (when this location did not participate in the Tuesday special & briefly touched on in my original review), a woman physically assaulted another woman in front of her toddler right where the register area was. I was astonished when the employee not only did not care about the safety of the customers (especially the little girl) & refused to even try to ask them to stop, much less call the police. She merely told them to move aside so she can take the next person's order. Making money superceeds public safety?...\n\nI called the police & the woman ran off. The cashier said it was none of my business & refused to give me any information. I called the next day when it was another shift & got a number of supposedly either the owner or the manager. I left several messages & NEVER received a single response. That tells me that this location's ownership/management not only doesn't care about public relations or worse, condones the employees' actions. \n\nOne of the employees put it, \"Your kind will still buy chicken\". Since it's in a predominantly minority area, that comment borders on racism & demonstrates her appalling hubris. She even went as far as to say that most of the customers can't even use computers & the phone line directs most options to the internet.

Since KFC went and changed their biscuit recipe, the biscuit at Popeye's wins over KFC's hands down.   The cajun fries are flavorful and have just the right amount of kick.  Red beans and rice aren't bad either.\n\nAs far as complaints about the customers go, once you enter the door it's all about the chicken.  I've never experienced any weirdness here, people are generally very polite and no one has ever been rude.  Since that's all I care about when getting food, I couldn't care less about any extracurricular pharmaceutical sales going down at the plaza or in the parking lot, much less anyone who asks me for money (even if they're standing right outside as this tactic makes it far less likely that I'll give them any).  \n\nThe only reason I'm giving 3 stars as opposed to four is due to the slow service.

Fast food, but yet, different from the other fast food... so we went for it!\n\nLocated around the corner from Fillmore Street, hidden in Safeway's parking lot, the sidewalk and surrounding area was dirty - but I'm used to that from going grocery shopping there, anyway.

The food was definitely higher quality than regular fast food.  You get a lot of food for a very low price, and it's comfort food - who doesn't love biscuits?!  I especially like the fries - much better than any of its fast food competitors.\n\nAfter finishing the meal, I actually had resolved to give Popeye's 4 stars.  That is a very high rating for a fast food place in my view.  However, a few minutes later I noticed the roof of my mouth was still filmy... how mysterious!  Was it from the juicy crunchy chicken skin, loaded with preservatives?  Perhaps from the chemical \"buttery\" biscuit?

Back at home, we got to enjoy the meal, away from nutzoid customers.  The chicken wasn't super spicy, probably so that anyone could handle the heat.  Both the chicken and the fish were pretty crunchy.  The red beans & rice were good.  I had a taste of the mashed potatoes and gravy, but not enough to determine how good it was.

Ever since moving into the Fillmoe Center I have been a frequent customer at this fine establishment. After a long game of futbol last night, I was way too tired to cook, and paid my good friends a visit just before closing time. The kitchen was shut down and they were only serving the breasts and thighs that were already cooked. The main guy who is here most nights welcomed me and I asked if they were still cooking anything.. he said No, but knows I am a big fan of the #7 combo with the chicken tenders (spicy of course). He asked if I wanted the strips and I gave him confirmation. Other people who came in right after me did not get this offer, they were only given the option of the food that was already made. So I guess you could say I'm kind of a big deal... but seriously that was awesome service, thanks guys!\n\nThe food has always been very fresh and tasty. I usually order the strips, which they cook for you when you order them; unlike the chicken pieces, which are pre-cooked and might be sitting out for a bit. I will say that I was unhappy with an order of the crawfish one time, but let's let bygones be bygones. The mashed potatoes are excellent, along with the cajun fries. I highly recommend asking for some honey and strawberry jam to go along with the biscuit.\n\nThe only request I have is that they offer an online delivery service.. honestly some nights I just don't feel like walking the half-block or so.

Will probably go to KFC for my dose of greasy fried chicken skin next time...", "author": "Darrin C."}

Just recently I went to get some lunch and the whole store was almost completely filled with smoke. When I finally placed my order the guy told me that they couldn't cook the mild chicken with the spicy chicken because that was the cause of all the smoke... WTF!!!!! They always screw up with the orders here as well.", "author": "Rommel N."}

Sure, the area is a little shady, but the easy parking and awesome gravy clearly make up for it.  Minus one star for changing their biscuits from the cone-shaped ones years back which were a lot crispier.", "author": "Kim K."}

I generally scowl upon fast food but sometimes you need a fast fix! No way will I go to KFC. Popeyes is always consistent and yummy and cheap.

This place is really small, there's practically only a few seats. On the day we went there was a long line and boy did we have an experience. The 64 year old grandma behind us was talking really loud with her bluetooth headset. How do I know she is 64? Because she was talking really loud and everyone knew it. When it was her turn to order, she pretty much laid on the counter and had everyone wait until she finished her phone conversation before she ordered. When she ordered, she wanted to sub a thigh for a wing but the worker said she couldnt sub the leg and thigh special. The grandma then slammed her fist on the counter and said I'll pay for this mother f---ing sub. The whole time she was talking really loud and everyone was watching. Funny thing was, the worker was calm and acted like this stuff was normal. She then ordered the worker to take out the thigh and just give her the leg. One word says it all here, \"hood\".", "author": "Norton W."}
