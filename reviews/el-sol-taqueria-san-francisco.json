Anytime you can find a taqueria you know it's gonna be some quality food. I happened to stumble upon this spot on my foot patrol of union square. \n\nThe menu is easy to read and understand. The place is small and wasn't busy on this Friday afternoon. The gentleman working was by himself, but since it wasn't busy it worked out just fine. He was cleaning up and making sure he had enough of everything out before he helped me. \n\nI asked for a carne asada burrito w/ rice, guacamole, and salsa. A pretty basic burrito. The man was cleaning up any mess he made as he made my burrito. That speaks volumes IMO. I watched him as he then proceeded to fold my burrito. This guy was an artist. He moved all the ingredients around to get an even amount throughout the burrito. Then he tighten it up as he rolled. This thing was HUGE! \n\nI came back to my room a few blocks away and began to devour this burrito. OMG! Was this thing good. I ate about half of it and every bite was just as good as the last. I thought I would save the rest for after my nap, but my taste buds said otherwise. \n\nWill def come back for my burritos here. Gracias!", "author": "Kevin Z."}

I typically get my tacos from the Mission District (La Taqueria is my favorite), which has set the bar high. I've been eating tacos street style all my life, so if someone offers me a hardshell taco or puts shredded cheddar cheese instead of cotija or queso blanco on their taco, we have a problem. \n\nMy co-workers are obsessed with this place. Probably because you can get a meal for under $10. I really did not like the burrito bowl. I ate half of the baby bowl and immediately felt bloated and sluggish. I recommend the 3 baby tacos, which are really just street tacos. The breakfast burrito is also amazing! You know a food is good when you catch yourself thinking about it. \n\n$8 credit card minimum. Pay a little extra for chips and salsa, but it's worth it!", "author": "Joanna S."}

As it is open till late, I decided to give it a try a couple of days ago. The menu is your standard Mexican dishes like tacos, burritos, nachos, quesadillas, enchiladas and dinner plates. After going through the menu I decided to get the Burrito Mojado ($9.95) to-go. Communication with the two people behind the counter is difficult to say the least so if you want major customizations you are in for a good ride. I think they have undergone special training in Chinatown to show universal contempt towards one and all. For the meat I selected Carne Asada which was dry burnt meat sitting in a container in the steam table.\n\nAfter putting the burrito together in the to-go container to my shock the gentlemen behind the counter reached into the freezer for a tub of cold salsa. It was taken literally out of the freezer opened and then spooned on to the burrito, which was then tossed into a microwave. Not even a commercial grade microwave, like one of the cheap $50 ones that you have at home. I mean expecting these folks to care, about plastic leaking into food when it is microwaved is a waste, but it is not lost on me. At this point I just wanted this to end and thankfully it did after some sour cream and guacamole were tossed on the microwaved burrito, and I was on my way.\n\nWhat I got literally looked like roadkill. Microwaving the burrito pulled out the last drop of moisture from the Carne Asada and it felt like chewing on pebbles. The hot salsa made it possible to put this crap down (and being hungry helped). They should be ashamed of putting out such bad food. My search for a decent Taqueria continues. No question of coming back here.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Great place to go and grab a quick bite at any time of the day (yes, they serve breakfast!!)\n\nSo about that burrito: it's just the right amount rice to beans to salsa and other accoutrements. And the queso (aka cheese)!! Just absolutely deliciousness. Oh, and they have this special red sauce that they squeeze over my shrimp that is just delish!!!

Seeing how I know I can't finish a burrito and its technically my mom's first time we ordered one to share. \n\nThe lady who took made our burrito was very nice. We asked her to cut our super burrito in half. She wrapped each again in foil so it looked like we ordered two really small burritos.

As a result, I came here for lunch and dinner. \n\nFor lunch, I had a Carnitas (Grilled Pork) Super Burrito for $6.95. That Burrito has rice, choice of beans, sour cream, rice, cilantro, onions, cheese, and lettuce (an item I didn't want in my burrito, but was given to me) blanketed in a flour tortilla. The Super burrito's size is smaller than some of the burrito I've had, but wrapped tightly.  The filling was fresh and stored properly, but the rice tasted kind of dried. A mediocre burrito, wishing I should have gone to Mission St. instead. This place is small with only five tables, as a result for lunch; I was forced to take my lunch home. Luckily I paid my lunch with cash, because minimum credit card purchase is $10.00.\n\nFor Dinner, I took my wife here after she got off work and ate in the restaurant. She had two Super Grilled Steak Tacos. Each taco costing $4.25 had the choice of meat, lettuce, salsa, cheese, sour cream and guacamole on top of a corn tortilla. She also bought a bottle of Negro Modelo beer and enjoyed her meal. I had the Grilled Steak and Prawn Combination Dinner (#1). My $11.00 meal has the meat and two sets of prawns on skewers with rice, beans salsa, sour cream and guacamole in a plate. The seafood was good and the rice was fresher than my midday visit, but the meat was tad too burnt and salty. Even my $1.00 can of Diet Coke could not extinguish the saltiness from the meat. \n\nMy subpar meal has forced me to tell my wife to charge our meal.

We'd walked down market from 8th Street to union square, just crappy fast food on market.  We thought we could find food in union square, but no.  All we could find was expensive food and starbucks.  Lots of starbucks.  We found a diner on a corner, but not one vegetarian thing on the menu except breakfast (pancakes).  We found another place with $10 sandwiches -- too expensive.\n\nWalking west, we finally found Taqueria El Sol at Jones & Geary, right across from Millenium.  If we were rich, we'd have lunched at Millenium, of course.  But we were looking more for something in the $5 range.  This place fit the bill.  We each got the vegetarian burrito, which was $5.95 plus tax = $6.35.  They had other vegetarian options like nachos, quesadillas, tacos.  And the usual meat options in those forms, plus extra.\n\nOne thing I really liked about this place, is that our burritos were made to order, customized right in front of our eyes.  I picked which beans I wanted, how much of lettuce, cheese, etc., I wanted, and I could see each step.  Everything seemed clean.  And I got my burrito the way I wanted it.\n\nMaybe I was just really thirsty, but the glass of tap water I got was great.  No ice, but nice and cold, but not too cold, just cool and refreshing.  Ah.  And free.  My BF got a bottled beverage.\n\nThere are only four tables in this tiny place, but it was nice enough -- no wobbly table, no stickyness.  The burrito was among the best I've had.  It was longer and slimmer than most -- same total size as usual, but a much easier shape to handle.  And the ingredients were throughout, as opposed to those burritos where you get bites of beans, and then later big bites of guac, etc.\n\nThe burrito came with a little cup of salsa and a little plastic baggie of chips.

That's really uncool. Plus, what's going on with the burrito names? One is labeled vegetarian burrito, and the other is el veggie? Totally confusing! The burrito maker got confused too, and after she realized the mistake, she cooked the frozen veggies for about .5 and slopped it onto my rice n bean mix, then I guess she rolled it into what you could call a burrito. And, who doesn't drain the friggin beans before dropping them into the tortilla? I don't want bogged down, soggy rice. But really, what's the point when the rice is HARD.

Accept it, or just admit to your significant other that you don't actually like taquerias and stop the BS \"oh, I can't eat an (delicious) SD style burrito because of that time I got sick\" nonsense.  You didn't get sick, you just don't like taquerias.  Those sorts of head games are why your boyfriend is going to break up with you...soon.  Sorry in advance.\n\nAnyway, I got food poisoning from El Sol.  Two days of misery was worth it to find out if they had the best SD style burrito.  They don't.  Alas, my journey continues, and I chalk up having a raw ass for a week as simply a battle scar in the war that rages on over which SF taqueria has the best SD style burrito.  The problem with the SD style burrito at El Sol seems to be common with the SD style burritos at other taquerias in SF: getting the proportions of the three ingredients right.  The flavors were eh but not bad.  The real issue was that the pico de gallo at El Sol is so heavy that the tortilla started to fall apart.

I paid in cash, so they didn't believe me when I went up to get the stuff that was supposed to be included in the super burrito price- so I paid twice for my sour cream & guac. There's a definite language barrier. The guacamole is good but I can make better. The salsa (pico de gallo) is very liquified. If you get anything in a tortilla, it'll be soggy. The meat and cheese is pretty safe- no bad incidents later during the day after eating here.", "author": "Braden B."}

Prices were very reasonable if I remember correctly.  There's only room for about 6 people to sit in the store, so plan on getting it to go.  The menu doesn't contain anything out of the ordinary for taquerias.  Standard goodness.", "author": "Levi B."}

I got better things to do, like draw pictures of wierd people walking around outside this loaf slinger.\n\nSo about their food.  I have eaten tortas, tacos and loafs and they are all good albeit a tad pricey ($7 loaf, fully stacked, tightly wrapped, in a foil tomb to warm up your lap).  Rather than drone on and on about all of the good and bad aspects of the place, I will concentrate on one good because I do like these people and what they do, while genuinely wishing the best to them and theirs.  So here goes; They take pork, perhaps some shoulder or butt, and the boil then bejesus out of it.  Next they take these savory chunks of hog and throw them in the deep fryer.  This produces a material that is crisp on the outside but oh so juicy in the middle.  Properly seasoned and loaded into a stainless steel trough and what we got are some muy bueno carnitas.  I highly recommend masticating some of these to fill your hungry tummy.  Tell them to twist those up with some black beans, cheez, guacamole, salsa, onions, rice and jalepenos, and you have a mighty delicious loaf.  Eat that bashful beaver and sit back to let the heartburn take control.", "author": "Jeff B."}

I have my favorite places to get nachos but decided to try this place as it was close to my apartment. The nachos were decent. They'd be better if the chips were homemade. What really sold me on this place was the day I decided to get a burrito. I got the super burrito with carnitas. I got to wash it down with a Mexican Coke and all was right with the world again. I've been tempted to try their other offerings but every time I go back the carnitas seduce me once again.", "author": "Fabian G."}

(Yes, cook. Not reheat.) We go here for work all the time and I've finally had it with this place.  Consistently lukewarm food and the only flavor is salt. The place is clean, but by any other measure, not good.", "author": "Brian M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-19", "description": "i thought this place was pretty good until today.  usually i get a (spicy) chicken quesadilla and it's always been surprisingly good.  the service was pretty friendly as well even though it seems like they have been starting to nickle and dime you for anything and everything.  typically chips come with anything you order.  however today i was just told that they now charge 25 cents for chips.. that's still pretty cheap but it's just sad.  the service was full of impatience even though there was no one in there waiting and i told them exactly what i wanted without hesitation.  i got a super chicken burrito this time and the \"super\" part was a quarter size cream and guacamole drop of which the woman proceeded to smoosh around to spread it out.  again, there was NO other customers so i was wondering why they were being so incredibly stingy... when only a few months ago they weren't.  their food is pretty good and i would go back again seeing as how it's the only decent place of it's kind in the area that i've found.  still, the skimping and waning customer service has my visits down for sure.", "author": "Nix B."}

But yeah...this place is worth it, especially when it comes to the super chicken burrito.  Nothing fancy, but very well put together in terms of everything you're looking for in a burrito to make you fat again right after you get out of the gym.  Delicious.", "author": "Benson J."}

The guy with the moustache and who seems to manage the Taqueria makes the best burritos. He constantly monitors the meats and mixes them. He packs those burritos as much as he can and he does so with care. There was a weird lady who worked behind the counter made the worst burritos. Every time she made it both ends of the burrito burst out in a mess and she tries to roll it again and again.  Horrible.  We are regulars and when she started working there we didn't go back for 6 months. Thank goodness we haven't seen her lately.", "author": "Seymour S."}
