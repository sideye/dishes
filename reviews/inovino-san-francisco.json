Other things not to miss are their version of an Aperol Spritz and the almonds. \n\nWill be back soon to try more. (Didn't care much for the crostini; the carciofi artichokes were good but missing something.) \n\nStaff is very friendly but slightly too quick on the takeaway.

He was the first one there, so luckily was able to order a bunch of things from the HH menu. I was the second to arrive on Friday, March 23rd around 6pm. He was already sitting at the tiny bar in front of the kitchen.\n\nHappy Hour: Monday to Friday 4pm to 6pm and Saturday to Sunday 3pm to 6pm\n*2014 Chianti Rufina, Bascianp, Toscana ($7)\n*2014 Primitivo Poggio Basso, Pugilia ($7) x3\n*Chicken Liver Pate on Bruschetta ($7)\n*Grana Padano Cheese, Honey, Walnut Bread ($5)\n*Pizzetta Salame & Parmigiano ($8)\n*Pizzetta Margherita ($7)\n\nI got the the glass of primitivo. I tried the chianti first, so I liked my glass a lot more. I'm into more full bodied cabs, so it was more my style. The liver pate was delish! My favorite food item we ordered. And there was a good amount of liver on each piece of bread. The margherita pizza was also tasty. I like a thinner crust, so this was definitely more my style. Not super thin as it retained a chew. Good amount of cheese and basil sauce too. I didn't try the grana padano as I'm more of a soft cheese girl. And everyone seemed to enjoy the salami pizza.\n\n*Burrata: distefano burrata, balsamico, crostini ($10)\n*2013 Madego, Cabernet Blend, La Capuccina, Veneto ($47)\n\nAfter HH was over, we ordered a bottle of wine. I asked our server what she would recommend and she suggested the madego. I should have mentioned I had the primitivo beforehand as I found this bottle very light after drinking the HH glass. The burrata was good though. Nice and creamy. Definitely more up my alley in terms of cheese.\n\nA fun neighborhood wine bar. Very tiny as it was packed when I got here. And there's only one restroom! Get here early if you want to guarantee yourself a seat!", "author": "Elena N."}

I've only been once but hopefully they change up the menu a bit so they're a a rotating list of HH specials. \n\nOnly reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because of the pizzas.

From the outside, the place looks classy. We were greeted immediately upon entering and seated promptly. The interior itself is super small and a bit cramped. We were able to find a table in the corner. It was still happy hour so we were able to order some small plates as well as a few $7 glasses of wine. This is not your typical California wine bar. Most if not all wines are Italian. They have an extensive list but you should be familiar with Italian wines otherwise you might be lost. \n\nWe each had a few glasses of wine and shared the crostini as well as a pizzette with salume (which I really enjoyed). \n\nMy friend had a fly in his first glass of wine and then some cork in the glass of wine that replaced the one with the fly in it. Not a great first impression. But the service and food were good. \n\nIn the end I felt that InoVino was a bit cramped and the wine list was a bit confusing.

Well... I don't know much about wine, so I'll skip that part. We shared the Nebbiolo Flights ($20) but it was alright. I wouldn't get it again but I would like to try some of the other flights.\n\nWe ordered two desserts. The Chocolate Cake with Hazelnuts ($7) was good. Super dense so definitely pair it with some sort of dessert wine. The Lemon Ricotta Mousse with Blood Orange and Pistachios\u00a0($7) was a no-go. I would not order this again or recommend it.

The burrata + peas were sooooo good!!! Next up, Margherita  pizza. Seriously, I mean seriously, one of the best pizzas of my life. I have had a lot of pizza people. This was soooo good. Particularly if you are a thin crust fan, my oh my.\n\nLast: Cannoli + an awesome glass of 2010 Malvasia delle Lipari, Vulcano, Lantieri (first time that I ever had it and it will not be my last). I would have preferred a sweeter cannoli however the drink pair was so darn lovely, it actually turned our slightly boring dessert into something that tasted more like a sumptuous donut. \n\nGreat evening. With all of that food, wine etc... we were out the door for a little over $100 before tip. Share a wine flight or a bottle, share a salad and pizza and you'd be out the door at around $60 ish.", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

A note of salt? Wonderful.\n\nWe finished with the tiny northern-style cannoli accompanied by a lovely Malvasia from the Aolian Islands just north of Sicily. Perfect.\n\nWe discovered that the owner, Claudio, has a very interesting background in restaurants and as a sommelier and the solid food and incredibly interesting wine list, shows it.

It may have been mostly the fault of this one table close to us that had not only someone with a loud/shrill/annoying laugh but also another person who had the grossest-sounding cough you've ever heard in your life. She should maybe have been in a hospital.\n\nOn top of that, I was there with my favorite person in the world, who also happens to indulge my judgyness maybe a little too much, so you could say it was impossible for InoVino to get off on the right foot given these circumstances. I had my \"I think I'm a professional critic\" hat on.\n\nOnce I got off my high horse, I realized just how lovely the place was. It was a quiet Monday night, and we sat outside because it was amazingly nice out. We didn't have a problem with slow service (how fast do these people drink their wine?), and, in fact, I should mention that our waitress, Sally, was just wonderful all around. We got a white flight and a red flight, and Sally a lot of information about each wine we drank.... But naturally that went in one ear and out the other. They were all delicious, though.\n\nThe food was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Pretty standard Italian appetizer-type options. Whoever says the prices are high is crazy.... All the food is right around $10, and you can get flights of wine for $15-$20. Their happy hour also looks great/affordable.\n\nON TOP OF ALL OF THAT... when aforementioned favorite person fell backwards in his chair and broke a plate in the process, they were speedy to clean it up and very forgiving, all while laughing about it with us.", "author": "Jenny M."}

He has managed great wine programs at restaurants in Florence and in San Francisco (Incanto, Quince) and he has finally created his brain child at InoVino, by offering a rare combination of artisanal food and wines, all at very reasonable prices.\n\nWhat we had the night we visited was an incredible bottle of Piedirosso (a grape variety from the Campania region of Italy that is normally of average quality but at the hands of the right producer can deliver a very unique smoky/earthy nose and deep red cherry flavors) which matched perfectly with our food: \n\n- a tepid soup of baked tomatoes (the prized Corbara tomatoes from Calabria) topped with melt-in-your mouth fresh Burrata cheese and topped with a basil puree - amazingly simple and wonderfully delicious.\n\n- Mozzarella di Bufala (COP from Campania) topped with anchovy and sprinkle of olive oil and basil puree - the flavors melded into a perfect combination specially when you washed it down with the Piedirosso\n\n- A triplet of Italian prosciutto (from Parma, San Daniele, and the slightly smoky Speck from the Alps of Italy in Alto Adige) - comparing the 3 different prosciutto is a really cool way of discovering the range of flavors that Italian prosciutto can deliver.\n\n- The best cheese plate that I've ever had (three cheeses ranging from a mild creamy semi-hard cheese called Salva Cremasco from Lombardia; to a creamy blue cheese from Piemonte called Blu del Moncenisio which went perfectly with the walnut bread it was served with; and last but not least, the best truffle pecorino that I've ever had - in Italy or here - called Pecorino Moliterno al Tartufo).\n\nWe ended the meal with a dessert of fresh ricotta cheese infused with chestnut honey and topped with shavings of excellent dark chocolate paired perfectly with a glass of Vin Santo.\n\nIt's rare to find a place in SF that focuses on great ingredients and simplicity in a way that exceeds your expectations.

He was willing to go as relaxed of fancy as we wished and offered great prices. Definitely recommend this place to all my friends who love Italian wine and tasty bites!", "author": "Hayley D."}

There was a very nice guy who we saw a few times, but our waitress was unpleasant and seemed annoyed to have us there. Couldn't get out fast enough.\n\nGood was fine and wine selection seemed good, but would not return on account of the awful service.", "author": "Michael S."}

This is just a really quaint and cool Cole Valley hangout. It's quiet, dimly lit, and very cozy. Turned out to be the perfect place to dig into the past, present and future while indulging in a little vino. Most of the wines I saw on the menu were European, I don't think I saw any Californian wines. This is neither good or bad. I first ordered a glass of Barosa and followed that with a glass of Barbera. Both wines were quite enjoyable. To me that says something. I think this little wine bar knows their stuff. To accompany our wine we ordered both a cheese plate and a prosciutto plate. Both were fantastic selections of cheese and meats. I liked that they brought different breads for each and an ample amount of bread, meaning I didn't run out and have a need to ask for more. The service was also excellent. The waitress was very pleasant and came over several times to ask if things were ok, if we wanted anything more and even informed us when the kitchen would be closing in case we wanted to slip in a last minute order. The one draw back is maybe their hours. By 10:30 on a Saturday evening they were closing down. To be fair they were not busy but I saw a women come in and she was turned away. I'd like to see them stay open a bit later on weekends, I think there's a late night crowd that would love a little hang out like this. Bottom line, great place to chill, perfect place for a semi-casual date, looking forward to returning and will definitely recommend to others.", "author": "Eric C."}

I came here for happy hour and we ordered olives and bruschetta with a glass of red wine each. The bruschetta, with a white bean spread on top, is glorious. It is rich and the bread is grilled expertly. The bean spread is piled high on the perfectly crusty yet soft on the inside bread and coated w olive oil. I want to come back here for a full meal and try their other wines.", "author": "D K."}

Also, it can get very loud and warm inside, since the space is so small. Make sure to arrive early, it gets packed quickly. They do have a few tables out in front, but are apparently not allowed to serve alcohol outside, so that you have to get your wine through the windows. Nice neighborhood spot.", "author": "Laura D."}

The owner waited on me and did not waiver in his kindness when I started asking about gluten free choices. He reassured my choice of the Risotto with a Rose was a good choice. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience while listening to chill lounge and very friendly service including the chef Juan coming to say hello. I finished with the lemon mouse and a great desert wine paring suggestion which I have to say you can't have one without the other. Will definitely be back to enjoy.", "author": "K Q."}

We arrived a little later than the rest of our party and they were happy to rearrange their tables to accomodate us.  The wine we had was delicious, the snacks were out of this world, and the service was great.  I cannot remember which wines we had, but they were some lighter reds that were super drinkable.  We got some salads, bruschettas, and the meat trio of some sort.  It had speck on it!  I don't know of any other restaurants that have speck on their menu.  We were there on a Thursday night from about 5-7 and found it to be not busy at all, lucky us!!", "author": "Felicia M."}

I got great recommendations and felt very cared for by the owner and the waitstaff. I didn't like the Brussels Sprouts and they took them off the bill. But the other food and the wine were great and I'll be back.", "author": "Amy L."}

The owner is wonderful, the food is fantastic as is the wine.  Service can be a challenge but the owner really helps out when the staff can't get to you and he is so charming. You do need to be willing to ask for help.  They should figure out that eventually.  This is a fabulous addition to Cole Valley.", "author": "Colleen K."}

It's cozy and friendly, dimly lit ... would be perfect for a date.  We each had one of their flights and shared some food.  Wine, food, and service were excellent!  And we enjoyed speaking with the very friendly owner Claudio.  I will definitely be back!", "author": "Marina T."}

I haven't finished my goal of tasting everything on the menu, but everything I've had so far has been amazing. The service is always good, and the staff is very knowledgeable and happy to help if you are not too familiar with Italian wines. They also have 3 oz option for wine, which is great if you just want to sample a bit.", "author": "Yaroslava V."}

The wine selection is great, the staff are super-friendly and knowledgeable, and the ambience is adorable. Also, love the salads, cheeses, pizzettes, and the desserts. We recently went to another \"Enoteca\" in SF and made a pact to never go to a non-Ino Vino enoteca again because it simply doesn't compare. We love Ino Vino!", "author": "S. L."}

Even though I am not a big fan of Itailan wines, Claudio has done a great job of selecting unusual wines that are delicious. And he has imported wonderful cheeses direct from Italy. Several friends and I went there after a disappointing wine dinner (four French wines, including a 1990 Margaux) and we had a great time. And we enjoyed the wines at InoVino much more and Claudio was a great host! I have known Claudio for over five years and enjoyed his hospitality first at Quattro (the restaurant at the Four Seasons in Silicon Valley) and then at Perbacco where he was wine director. He has used this experience well and I will be visiting InoVino the next time I am in SF.", "author": "Mark R."}

It's a little tightly packed but the ambience is good. Generous and delicious trio of prosciutto but tiny (albeit delicious) trio of cheese. Maybe this place isn't quite sure if it's a wine bar with food or a small restaurant. Not a bargain but I think we'll go again (especially if the cheese portions can stretch beyond a mouthful).", "author": "Ian T."}
