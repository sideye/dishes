It wasn't super crowded, however there is only seating for maybe 10 or 15 people inside. You can definitely order the food to go though, as it is only a couple blocks from the park.\n\nThe inside of the place is awesome. Classic little sandwich shop, menu written in chalk, lots of great options for breakfast and lunch. The people who own the place are really nice, and love to talk to you. They are a part of the reason the place is so great in my opinion. The posting online says cash only, and we paid in cash, but it looked like they had a Square reader so I'm not sure if they're taking card now, so prepare accordingly.\n\nI got the  on toasted Dutch rye, and it was very very good. Their sandwiches are nice a crunchy, and packed to the brim. They're juicy which is always a good sign and means most of the veggies are pretty fresh. My wife also had a sandwich (can't remember which) and said it was very good. The sandwiches weren't the best in the world which is why I'm giving four stars. It is definitely worth frequenting though.", "author": "Lance H."}

I swear I can't just order one sandwich. I can probably gobble one down in just a few bites. And that's not enough to satiate my hunger.\n\nThe reason these sandwiches are so magical is their crunch. I love how the bread is toasted perfectly and the lettuce tastes so fresh and all the I ingredients come together with the perfect crunch. These sandwiches have the same effect that chips have on me. The sound of the crunching of the lettuce, bread or cucumber makes me want to eat more. It's that delicious!\n\nThe ingredients in each sandwich is perfectly balanced. And there seems to be enough veggies such that you won't be left in a food coma after you finish. In fact the sandwiches are very refreshing!\n\nDon't just get one, get two sandwiches when you come!

The plate seemed like a fairly expensive dish for somewhat inauthentic and not-so-tasty food.  My husband ordered the Tuna Melt sandwich instead and he seemed to like it.  I think if I returned, I would try one of their bagel sandwiches...I just wasn't in a bagel mood at the time.\n\nI also ordered a latte which was mostly just hot milk and barely any espresso.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-10-11", "description": "Decent coffee, cheap price, they have outlets, but the good things pretty much stop there. The cafe is cash only, and the owner is abrupt and racist. I feel bad for his wife who also works at the cafe, as her husband is quite the prick. \nI was standing behind a young man, probably no more than 18, waiting to get coffee, and the kid looked like he'd been through hell. Or maybe just really needed coffee. Or maybe really high. I don't know, but he wasn't in tip top shape. The male owner asked the kid how his day was going, and the kid kind of stared at the owner and muttered, \"good,\" then proceeded to order about $25 worth of food (a feast at Java Supreme). \n\nThe owner then proceeds to talk INCREDIBLY loudly in Arabic while his wife started the order, gesturing to the young guy, and dropping a few words in English like, \"stupid,\" \"kids today,\" \"respect,\" \"rude.\" Basically, he was openly insulting the young kid while standing right in front of him, and making no show to hide it. It took the kid a couple minutes, but when he did realize that he was being insulted in a different language, he just looked so downtrodden and went to go sit with his girlfriend sitting at a table, who ALSO looked like hell.\n\nThe owner talked shit about this kid for about 10 straight minutes, while his wife was hard at work making the bagels, coffee, and other food. He didn't see me standing at the counter for a solid minute, and when he did, he rudely told me, \"CASH ONLY\" when I was ordering my coffee, gesturing at the ATM in the corner, and turned to continue yelling to his wife. \n\nIn my opinion, I'm taking this to be a racist encounter because the young couple were Latino, and the owner showed only hostile behavior to other Latinos that walked into the cafe later that afternoon.\n\nOverall, not impressed by the owners nor the coffee offered, so I will not go to this local establishment.", "author": "Paige S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-04-05", "description": "At first glance, the place looks like any quaint coffee shop in the ever-beautiful Mission. What seemed like owner-baristas also seemed polite. This was ~9am and we were the only people in the there, after a composed old man just left after reading his morning paper w/ coffee.\n\nBut soon after, 'attitude on display' began to unfold. Clarification: All 'attitude' relates to the man in our instance; woman was polite. \nThey forgot to make my girlfriend's latte (remember: no one else around, so, not busy), and when she returned to the counter 5-10 min later to check, they said \"oh it is coming\", as if they never forgot. It was just their attitude, more than the simple act of forgetting to make a latte even when there are no people around.\n\nI then was taking a phone call, very quietly I  might add, at one of the tables. At this stage, there were 2 other people in the cafe. Me, gf, 2 others. Time: ~9:29am. The man comes over and taps on my shoulder and says \"no calls\". I hung up immediately. I asked my gf if I was being loud but she didn't think so. There was a man right next to us on a laptop so I deliberately whispered on my call because I just felt like I want to be as quiet as possible. There are so many ways to tell me to no be on the phone: \"please take it outside thank you\", \"wifi slows down for others if you are on FT call\" and so many others. Also, I saw no signs for 'no calls'. I saw 2 others in the store. We also didn't just buy coffee for the wifi. Total order amount: ~$10.\n\nTheir (the man's) overall attitude left me feeling like I either play by certain unwritten rules, or I might be reprimanded. I typically go to smaller coffee shops to relate more with the owners, get a sense of 'family', but this 40min stay for breakfast + coffee left me with a bad taste, and no desire to return.\n\nNo bad words were used, no confrontations; just their attitude + actions made a subtle yet strong indication of how they tend to be toward customers. \n\nWith all due respect, I felt the vibe - maybe it is just me. Regardless, I shall not return. Thanks.", "author": "Madhu C."}

Yes, there have been times when the food or service at a restaurant may have been poor but nothing compares to what I experienced at this place. \n\nAs soon as I walked in, I sat down and took out a book. The place was almost empty so I figured it'd be nice to study while I enjoyed my coffee. Unfortunately, it never got that far. The owner immediately walked over to me and asked me if I was planning on ordering anything. I said I was but that I was going to take my things out of my bag first and then buy something. I found it strange that he was so pushy but thought maybe that was just his way of asking if he could get me something. Either way, he seemed to understand and just walked away. \n\nA couple minutes later I finally decided to order my cappuccino when he walked back over and told me that it's obvious I'm not planning on ordering anything so I need to leave. \n\nI was in shock, as were the other customers in the place. I asked them if this has happened before and they said yes, which only surprised me even more. I can't understand how a place with such rude owners is still in business. I will definitely never return. \n\nTo those who do read this: Please do not continue supporting a place who's owner thinks he can treat customers like crap! \n\nTo the owner: I understand this is your business, but please understand that if you don't treat your customers with respect, you're only hurting your business.

We are both well-mannered, clean and had only had a couple of beers. And in response to another poster - I'm not a loser deadbeat, in the least. In fact, I'm pretty straight edge and have a great career. And I understand where this guy is coming from, but there's a point where you make an exception or just kindly say, listen, the restroom is for customers only, sorry. You don't need to lock people in your shop and call police. Give me a break.\n\nWe really would have bought a water or coffee if we both hadn't accidentally left our wallets behind in the park.

It's mom-and-pop run and they have been here 18 years.  It's almost a hole in the wall, but they have a menu, amenities and prices that beat most others.  \n\nThere's 10 2-seat tables.  6 of them are in the front by the streetcorner-facing windows, a bright work space for using the free wifi.  The others line the wall by the counter which has all the coffee devices plus a tiny deli cooler with egg salad and stuff like that.  You can get a good selection of veggies and hummus or the usual meat on a sandwich, for just 3.95, what a deal.  I got the veggies and cream cheese on rye sandwich with a hearty home made vegan soup, plus coffee, for under $8.  I went on a sunday afternoon (they closed at 6, not 7) and there was just one other laptop worker and a few regulars who drifted in and out.  Very welcoming and 5 stars for sure.", "author": "Pat L."}

I used to intern at 826 Valencia, right around the corner, and this was my go-to spot for coffee and for bagel sandwiches, which are so cheap I initially thought I misread the price. I am particularly partial to both of the Java combination sandwiches, but, then again, I am a sucker for anything that combines a bagel, veggies, and cream cheese. I also love the atmosphere: Java Supreme is not a hipster coffee shop like Ritual or Philz and it's awfully nice to sip coffee in the Mission and not feel like I'm being judged by people who are way cooler than I'll ever be.\n\nEd, the owner, is incredibly kind and courteous, and I think he might be the hardest-working person I've ever met. His wife (I think her name is Yvonne) is also wonderful. I'm not here as often as I'd like to be now that I'm not at 826 all the time, but I try to make a point of stopping by if I'm on my way to the park.", "author": "Elizabeth K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-21", "description": "This has been my coffee shop of choice for about a year and a half, and I must admit that I have intentionally held off from writing a review for the purely selfish reason that I don't want anything about the place to change - least of which the fact that I can almost always get a seat there.  So you may believe that I am now writing this review because I have denounced my self-serving ways but in fact, it is only because I now know that I will be moving away from SF in a few months and want to finally give props where props are due.\n\nThe things that initially won me over to Java Supreme were the utter lack of pretense and good, solid coffee at a price that would never make me stop and think to myself, \"wait a minute, I spent HOW much on coffee this week??\"  Ed, who runs the place, is also an awfully charming guy.  Even if I haven't built up the personal relationship with him that many of the other regulars have, I know that I could, and that's enough.  He knows my order, including what kind of bagel I'd like for my breakfast bagel, without asking.  \n\nJava Supreme's clientele is made up of the kinds of people who appreciate a personable, small-business owner like Ed, and I like that too.  They are a decidedly less-hipster, slightly older, more likely to have a small child, less likely to be posing with their iBook crowd than you will find at most of the other options in the neighborhood.  \n\nMy only complaint is from those days when I do need to get something done during my time at Java Supreme - the wifi is terribly undependable.  That can be frustrating when you figure it out only after having placed your order.  But no matter - the coffee is strong, the food good, and the atmosphere very relaxed.   A+", "author": "Josh C."}

Perhaps, though, they should try the whole order-pay-waitforname process over the order, wait at the counter with money-in-hand until he's done fiddling with the espresso machine, and then pay process. I'm just sayin'...allow your clientele to go enjoy the atmosphere and just call their name when a drink is done. Especially when the line is over three people strong, all of who (more-than-likely) are going to order some sort of coffe concoction.\n\nThat aside, I love this place. The art on the walls really caught my eye. The menu is of the colored-paint-on-chalkboard variety (seems to have invaded these places all over the city). The coffee is pretty dern good.

There are lots of little cafes that are nearer to me, but I prefer to walk a little out of my way to visit this place.  I think it must be owner-operated because I always see the same man and woman behind the counter.  And they are truly lovely.\n\nFree WiFi, lots of outlets, yummy sammiches, and totally unpretentious.  A favorite.", "author": "Myrna M."}

Since I was craving one & can walk to Java Supreme, I decided to give theirs a shot.  Not too shabby!  Perhaps a bit on the bitter side, & they use some kind of chocolate powder instead of a syrup, but still a significant improvement over the chains.  At some point, I'll have to try the food there -- they serve all kinds of bagels, sandwiches, & pastries, & the people who run the place seem really nice.", "author": "Angela B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-06", "description": "I see other reviewers complain about not being able to pee here for free, not being able to wait there for their date for free. and giving 2 stars for rudeness. Sorry you got put out, but think about this. There are 8 million other coffee spots in the Mission. Java Supreme happens to sell $2 coffees and $5 sandwiches, and that's cheaper than places like Starbucks that let you crash for free. You can meet your date for free at the park on 19th between Valencia and Guerrero. Anybody can pee for free at The Women's Building right around the corner (huge mural bldg/18th between Valencia and Guerrero). If this place--or anyplace--won't let you pee or hang out for free, you could maybe smile, say, \"Oh, I'd be happy to pay!\" and hand the guy $1 or $2. Just a suggestion.", "author": "Kate H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-02-08", "description": "This little coffeeshop is across the street from my old apartment in the Mission, so it has a special place in my heart. The owner isn't exactly chatty, but he's a good guy and makes it a point to know his regulars' usual drink. It's pretty spare -- just simple wooden tables and chairs -- but there's almost always a seat or two open. Plus, yummy sandwiches, salads and a smattering of Middle Eastern fare. There's not a whole lot of ambience to speak of -- but for me, this is one of its high points because it means I can always get a seat. Bonus: I heard they just added free wifi.", "author": "Jen R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-02", "description": "When I lived in the Mission this place filled a crucial niche in my selection of cafes--it was my \"discount\" coffee shop of choice. The prices are really low-~$2.25 for a latte or cappuccino, $5 for a decent sandwich. It's a mom-and-pop shop, and the proprietors are generally friendly, if perhaps a tiny bit aloof at times.\n\nOne downside is that the bathroom is really cramped. There's just one toilet in a tiny little room, and when you come out you have to go behind the counter to wash your hands.\n\nThere's free wifi, although you have to ask for the password (also not a  big deal). There are some outlets too.", "author": "Alex C."}

Every time I walk in, I am greeted with warm recognition. I would never want my caffeine addiction to be welcomed by anybody else. To sum it up, they're just down. And I'm down with their coffee and reasonable price range. Plus their bagels are good and it's on a peaceful little part of the block. For chillers only.", "author": "Sam R."}

It is a small, family run business and they care about their customers. I live a few blocks away and have some options as to where I go. Java Supreme's coffee is always HOT, it's strong and they don't ever have to ask what I want because they are like my little family down the street, they know. In addition, the food they serve caters to diverse dietary needs and their soy milk is delicious! The atomosphere is mellow and the art work is pleasing.

My friend tells me there's a couple spots nearby for food, and that there was a pizza spot and a sandwich spot. This spot was the first one I saw, so me and my friends check it out. Very friendly people who run the shop, and even gave my friend a discount and a free pastry for grabbing a bag of ice for bossman. The sandwich i ordered was the tuna melt, and MAN.. that was really on point. My friend ordered the ham, egg & cheese bagel and he said it was really good as well. Everything was very reasonably priced and I only spent 6 bucks. Very small inside. Ordering to go at this place seems like a good idea. Doesn't accept credit or debit, but there's a ATM inside. Mom n pops shops always have the goods, which is why i never turn away from these places. Never tried the coffee or other items, but if I'm in the area, I'd visit again.", "author": "Ronald S."}
