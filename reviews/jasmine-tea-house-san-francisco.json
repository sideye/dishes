Came here on a cold day- the chicken and corn soup was warm and really hit the spot. Ordered my favorite- wet flat noddles. The sauce/gravy is so flavorful and pairs perfectly with the bok choy. The fried rice is amazing. So flavorful and not too salty. The XLB was warm and was great with vinegar and soy sauce. My favorite is the wings- crunchy and drenched in a sweet and salty sauce. Ask for some hot sauce if you like things a little spicier. Their portion sizes are big! Great place for a cheap and convenient meal.", "author": "Ngoc My H."}

So I placed my order and had a seat in the dining area. \n\nFood took about 10-15 minutes to arrive because it was made fresh to order; came out piping hot.

The pork buns were really good. Soft and doughy with sweet bbq pork filled inside. All this for $9.50 too.

Mainly picked this spot on GrubHub for the low $15 delivery minimum and $0 delivery fee. I was pleased the food actually travelled well with delivery (no soggy, cold food), but it took maybe 90 minutes from when I ordered for my food to be delivered.\n\nThe menu looked very Americanized, which held true when I got my delivery. As long as you're not expecting real Chinese food, you probably won't be disappointed.\n\n* DIM SUM COMBINATION PLATE ($9.50) - 3.5/5\n[3 each of shrimp dumpling, pork bun & siu mai]\nPretty standard as far as dim sum goes. Shrimp dumpling and siu mai were a little greasier than average but otherwise normal. The BBQ pork in the pork buns were overly artificially red in color and sweet, but the buns were soft and fluffy and balanced out the extra sweetness.\n\n* FRIED CHICKEN WINGS ($7.95) - 4.5/5\nDry fried, nicely salted.

I went to this restaurant with my boyfriend last week. I have been sick and had bad service from restaurants all week so this was a nice change of pace to the usual service I get at Chinese restaurants.\n\nThe server was a very sweet, polite and professional hostess. She was everything you want at a restaurant; she constantly refilled our waters, answered questions without acting bothered (I had asked her what tea to order and she recommended the Iron Goddess of Mercy as the one that customers like--very good tea. The food was fresh and delicious--perfectly cooked.\n\nWe ordered the general tsao's chicken, pork buns, and corn soup with a side of chinese broccoli. The broccoli was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of crunch and seasoning. The chicken was excellent. I also remember going here with my sister a few years ago and having a similar great experience, so it's nice to add consistency to the list. I see some of the reviews of certain entrees aren't so good, but every restaurant has its specialties so if you order something you didn't like, try the general tsao's and the pork buns with broccoli!", "author": "Megan N."}

Food was still pretty hot, my walnut prawns were still crunchy.  The delivery guy apologized and said he forgot the rice but as I unpacked my food, I did find a small box of rice.\n\n3/5 Walnut Prawns - The prawns were heavily battered.  Authentic walnut prawns have a very light batter so that's what I expected.  Because of the thick batter, the prawns were a little greasier than I usually like them.  I suspect they use a thick batter to keep the prawns more crispy.  Other than that, they tasted good, just not what I was craving for.\n\n4/5 Szechuan Beef - Great flavor, mildly spicy, all you can expect from a spicy beef dish. \n\n2/5 Mapo Tofu - Spicy level and consistency of the sauce was good but it lacked any real flavor.\n\n3/5 BBQ Pork Bun - My kids usually gobble up BBQ pork buns without hesitation but they did not like the BBQ pork filling at all.

So I've frequented this place, plenty, over the past year (or maybe even 2?), and for shame, I only now write a review (UPDATE: Inaccurate ~ forgot I posted a review, before; see below..). My hope is that this message is read and received, with a mind for progress with this establishment..\n\nThey've gone from an absolutely spectacular little restaurant to order from to the subpar stature of most every other Chinese food place in the Mission area ~ one often blames popularity for this shift (and this place has definitely grown in popularity).. I would just hope that they haven't grown comfortable not trying as hard. As I continue this review, accept my apologies if I seem to wax nostalgic.\n\nA year+ ago, the food was *amazing*. I'd think I were being hyperbolic, but I distinctly recall coming away with the same impression about their food, each time, before. My measuring of Chinese food establishments tends to rest on a small set of 'staples' that I use to compare different establishments: the chow mein, the general tso's chicken, and their pot stickers. Price Matters, and is considered heavily (not specifically for being *cheap*, which is important, but if Free is the best spice on steroids, spendy Chinese better be Very freakin flavorful..).\n\nI write this review, and it pains me(kindanotreally), because where a year ago this place was absolute Top marks ~ not Only for price, which was just fantastically cheap (assuming because they were very new), but for Flavor & Quality. The pot stickers, here, at a time, were long and aways the best in the Mission. Period. AND amongst the cheapest. Now I feel a bit ripped off. They've gone up ~$2 per order, since.. their quality has gone down significantly (biting into hard chunks of gristle is Gross ~ this has happened at least a few times more recently), and the flavor's just not there, anymore, beyond those respects/concerns. \n\nWhen the pot stickers go, the rest follow ~ the other dishes have gone up in price, down in quality. The chow mein (once also really good) is just oilier and less flavorful. I still like the General Tso's chicken. Also, their combo Won Ton soup was a steal and a blessing lol, and I still love to order that to this day. The dim sum is also pretty awesome, though, again, food quality concerns (gristly pork siu mai.. ew)..\n\nAppreciate that this review is less a damning of the establishment and more the noted frustrations of a once-immensely pleased patron. It took a long enough time to find a place in the area that delivered really good Chinese food, and this was IT, once. I write this with the realization that this establishment has since come to risk attaining a similar mediocrity (at inflated price points)  that the rest of the Mission seems dead set upon resting on. And it's sad, really. Just not something I want to see..\n\n\n===== Original Review:\n\nI really have to say that I am impressed with the food that comes out of this place. I have ordered food here a few times, and they've been consistently delicious. For one, their potstickers are better than most everyone else's in town, period. Most anywhere I go, I order the potstickers (a. because iLoves them and b. its a good 'quality test' for a Chinese cuisine establishment), and consistently, Jasmine Tea House outclasses the rest for flavor and texture and just overall preparedness. \n\nThis applies for the dim sum, as well - the pork siu mai and shanghai baby bun were, too, some of the best I've had in the city. In general, I am very happy with how well the food is prepared, here. It was worth getting on here to write a review for them. Will frequent farrrr more often.", "author": "Cory H."}

My GF and I ordered Jasmine Shrimp, Chicken Black Bean Sauce (they made this special for us), and we received a chicken fried rice for free. Total bill $25 after delivery tip.\n\nComments:\n\n- Chicken used in the Chicken with Black Bean Sauce was such poor quality. It was all the small oddly shaped pieces of chicken that come from all the places on the bird that you don't want to think about. Chewy, lots of little segments that have the cartilage or ligaments still partially on it. Not a single proper sliced chunk of quality chichen meat in the entire dish. Very unpleasant to eat and so very disappointing. We order a lot of chinese takeout and this had to be the worst we've had for $9.99. Grade: Fail.\n\n- Fried rice. Rice was very dry and a but hard. They didn't use enough water to soften it before frying and not enough oil to give it proper body. Grade C.\n\n- Shrimp dish was acceptable. Grade B+.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMy god there is such better Chinese takeout in this town and neighborhood than this place. The people raving about this place on Yelp need to get a reality check.

The veggy chicken was a decent texture, but neither of the dishes I got were particularly well flavored. So eating the fake chicken (which is rare) was not exciting. The tofu dishes were fairly typical. The potato curry puff was the strangest of them. The pastry part reminded me more of baklava than anything else. The potato filling was pretty small and not overly flavorful.\n\nIn the end it served its purpose of filling my lazy stomach. Nothing special.

I quoted the word Chinese because there are so many restaurants based on various regional and fusion cooking techniques.\n\nThe locality is well lit, clean, and nicely decorated. It is also easy to get to and park. There is a public parking lot across the street in the B of A lot. The food is not greasy or stuffed with MSG. The dishes vary from the simple americanized dishes like beef broccoli to the culinary rarities such as frog legs.\n\nThe dishes I recommend are the Moo shu pork (chinese tacos), walnut prawns, hunan fish, frog legs, ostrich and vegetables, and for desert, fried bananas with green tea ice cream from Mitchell's.", "author": "Humano T."}

Bad idea!  I remember another Yelper mentioning something about a funky taste/aftertaste, and it's so true!  I should have known the moment the delivery guy handed me the bag, and all I could smell was a strong salty, dried shrimp odor!\n\nThe food tasted OK but I couldn't get over the overpowering smell and the stagnant aftertaste it left behind.  My fried rice was really dry and uneven in color.  You can tell they threw it in the wok, poured soy sauce over the whole thing, but didn't care if everything got evenly distributed!  Lame!  Maybe that's why they give it to you for free with 2 entree orders.\n\nOne good thing: the General Tso's Chicken was great because (and I'd never seen this) they use humongous chunks of chicken but include the deep fried batter stuff separately interspersed within the dish.  That way you can eat as little or as much deep fried batter as you want.  And of course, I like to eat all of it!  Genious!!!

It's embarrassing because I can make it myself or eat at my mommy's.  But I've been too lazy to cook or drive all the way home, and definitely craving some chinese food, so I stopped by here for lunch today with my friend.\n\nStarting with the atmosphere.  The place was pretty open and wasn't too crowded.  There was a lot of in and outs for take out and what not. Atmosphere was nice, not too quiet but enough for me and my friend to have a chatty lunch without everybody in there hearing our convo.\n\nWe ordered the bak choy with black mushrooms and basil chicken, and their dimsum combination plate.  The food was pretty good.  The dimsum wasn't the BEST EVER kind of deal, but definitely up to par.  (I'm Cantonese, I grew up eating dimsum in China, so I would know =P).  \n\nAnyways, the basil chicken, really was basil chicken, it's really Americanized ( my friend ordered this, I would probably have never ordered it), but it tasted like what it says it is, BASIL and CHICKEN...lol the texture was good and the flavor was really basil-ish... wouldn't get that again...but it's not BAD...\n\nThe bak choy and black mushrooms was pretty good.  I wish they gave you more bak choy, I was really craving the vegetables, but then they weren't stingy with the mushrooms.  You can tell they used some oyster sauce for the mushrooms and it was really good.  It's a simple, common, easy to make dish, and it was well made. \n\nThe service is pretty good.  Fast and polite, and she was actually really nice.  I asked her for extra rice to go, we had left overs which i was going to bring to my boyfriend at work, and she gave me a whole to go box and she didn't charge me for it, or give me a dirty look which I feel like other places often do when you ask for stuff.  I was gonna give it 3 stars but because of that I'll give it an extra star! It's not about getting free stuff, it's about the fact that she quickly and nicely gave me what I wanted.\n\nAnyways, the only thing bad about the place is that when she first brought out the plate she didn't realize that one of them was still dirty...it had something crusty on it, eww.  But we told her and she apologized and quickly gave us a clean and new one.  \n\nI think I'm being so nice about this because they were truly really nice and were service oriented, and places like that I can definitely be more forgiving about stuff.  4 stars overall and I'd definitely go back again.", "author": "Zu W."}

Thus, I thought odds were pretty good that I'd like this place... it was not to be.\n\nWe ordered delivery on Saturday at 6pm through a rather surly phone guy who spoke reasonable english.  The order showed up at 7:15pm, which I actually consider fine for a Saturday peak-dinner-delivery-time.  Despite the wait, the food did show up hot.\n\nWe ordered:\nC. Party Time [Prawn with walnut]\nThere was at least a quarter inch of batter fried onto each prawn.  My wife ate this one -- she said it was pretty bland.  The hot & sour soup that came with it was really inedible -- it tasted like someone had accidentally spilled apple vinegar into it.  An obscene amount of apple vinegar.\n\n36. Combination Wonton Soup\nThe soup had a decidedly fishy taste to it -- not what I was expecting.  Even after fishing out the prawns, I couldn't get past the fishy taste.  The pork in it was pretty good, as were the dumplings -- but the broth, prawns and chicken were pretty nasty looking and tasting.\n\n60. General Tsao Chicken\nProbably my favorite of the dishes.  Nice tangy black sauce, basted onto minimally breaded breast-meat chicken.  This could possibly be my new favorite General Tsao Chicken in SF, and the reason why they got 2 stars instead of 1.  There was a laughably small amount of broccoli in the container - I think one or two pieces.\n\n70. Szechwan Beef\nAgain, a heavy hand was used with the batter, pre-frying.  The beef had very little flavor, but the cooked onions they threw in were a really nice addition to give the dish some kick.  \n\nFor $46 (including delivery tip), we'd have been better off ordering from somewhere else.", "author": "Paul L."}

I did think the hot and sour soup was quite good--peppery, and I didn't see that mystery meat I usually find in hot and sour soup. The egg rolls were also pretty good. The price was reasonable, though not super-cheap either.\n\nCons: I ordered a combination dinner with walnut prawns, after reading on here that the walnut prawns were good. I did not know they were going to be deep-fried. (There was no description on the menu.) I had in mind some kind of saute with a sauce and maybe some veggies in it...nope. Just deep-fried shrimp tossed in some kind of sweet-ish sauce with a handful of walnuts on top. I really loathe deep-fried Chinese food (be it sweet and sour chicken, etc.) --it is just so heavy and greasy and tasteless to me. So I was very disappointed by that. I do not want to judge the rest of the menu too harshly, as the soup and egg rolls were tasty. Maybe if I had ordered something different that wasn't fried I would have liked it. I just wish it had specified on the menu that it was fried. I would have chosen something else.\nThe other con (and unfortunately this affected the parts of my meal I DID enjoy) was that there were no little crunchy wontons to put in my soup, and no little packets of Chinese mustard or sweet and sour sauce for the egg rolls...not even a little packet of soy sauce. Nothing. I don't know if that is standard for this place or if they just forgot on my order, but I missed the crunchy things in my soup and I really like mixing some mustard and duck sauce for my egg roll. :-(\n\nSo...ummm...I don't want to judge too harshly, but I personally didn't feel like finishing my meal (though to be fair, after 2 egg rolls and a soup, you really can't eat more than a couple of deep-fried shrimp anyway)...", "author": "Jennie S."}

Their prices are reasonable and the staff is incredibly friendly and competent--my water glass never goes empty, which is very important to me in a restaurant. Food comes quickly and is always hot and I have never had to wait for a table, which means it's not crowded or noisy.\n\nAnd let's talk about the food. I haven't tried any of their meat dishes except the ostrich (which is freakin amazing), but I've loved everything else (especially the sesame meatless chicken, veg potstickers, hot & sour soup, & veg mushu). I find that some dishes have the over-saltiness or over-greasiness that many chinese take-out type places have, although it is very slight here (I may be extra-sensitive to this because I do a ton of chinese cooking at home and I use much less oil). But, that's easily solved by asking your waiter for less oil or less salt or whatever you want and they will do it! \n\nTheir meatless chicken is AMAZING and you can ask for it in the style of pretty much any of their chicken dishes even if it's not on the menu. I also like to ask for the meatless chicken not breaded or fried because it's much healthier that way, plus I like it better anyway. Basically, they will allow you to ask for substitutes or changes to their menu (within reason) without even frowning about it, so that alone wins them a ton of points in my book. Add tofu to your veggie dish, or eliminate those darn water chestnuts from your basil chicken. Go crazy!\n\nAs an added bonus, they give you a free lo/chow mein or fried rice if you order 2 entrees from take-out. And delivery is free. Love this place.", "author": "Katie D."}

The dishes are as another reviewer wrote mainly ABC food (american born chinese) tasting food like joe's.  The dishes came in good time in only 25 min after ordering online from their website.

Wok's hours say til 1AM on their website, but they called and said they close at 10PM (it was 9:30PM when I placed online order, and 9:50 when the place called to tell me they couldn't deliver my order because the kitchen was closed). So on to Jasmine I found thru a Yelp review when searching for late Chinese delivery to  Bernal. \n\nWell, when I called to order it was 9:55pm and asked if they would still deliver. The guy asked where I lived, and he cheerfully said \"yes\" they would deliver and it would be the driver's last stop. He only asked that I tip the driver in cash (I was paying by card) since the driver would be going home after our stop. Fair enough. \n\nThe food that came was HOT, and fresh. Sesame Beef was crispy and savory, not greasy. Spicy eggplant chicken was nice, not over-sauced, but with flavorful eggplant and crisp stir fried zucchini and veggies. The free bbq pork chow mein (free rice or chow mein with 2 entree orders) was good aldente  with nice portion of bbq pork. Hot and sour soup was hearty but slightly under seasoned; I'd prefer some with a peppery kick. \n\nJasmine was certainly better and fresher tasting than some of the other mediocre places in the Bernal area. (Not a fan of Hunan Chef, they have live finches in cages in the dining room....seems a little against any health code).\n\nThey score on the customer service side, not declining business because it's 5 minutes before closing.", "author": "Jon L."}

It's lightly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.\nIt's extremely tasty when dipped in the hot mustard. It was fresh and wonderful.\n\nThe potstickers arrived next...and these potstickers put Superstar yong de to shame. Superstar yong de, you need to take your soggy potstickers and take lessons from Jasmine Tea House.\n\nJasmine Tea House prepared 6 perfect potstickers. They are lightly crisp on the bottom, and soft and tender all around. Once you bite into them, the flavors and juiciness of the potsticker will explode in your mouth. They were so good, that Brad and I had to fight for the last one....I lost. Boo hoo.\n\nHis Honey Walnut prawns arrived. Now these were huge delicately fried prawns (not shrimp) in batter, coated with a creamy sweet white sauce and tossed with Candied Walnuts. It was crispy, light, sweet and delicious. Think of a different version of sweet and sour prawns...with a white sauce. He was quiet the whole time, so I know he enjoyed his entree.\n\nMy Wor won ton soup arrived...and this to me was the piece de resistance. This is what won ton soup is about. This puts all won ton soup to shame.  All other won ton soups I eat in other chinese restaurants tastes like flavorless warm water with soggy won tons floating in it...yuck.\n\nThis soup is perfect..why you ask\n1. 8 perfectly cooked won tons floating in a wonderfully spiced and flavorful rich dark broth. The vegetables of mushrooms, greens add to the flavor, the bbq pork, chicken and beef sat atop of the dish like a crown jewel engulfed in a thick rich brown sauce to add this delicious explosion of heaven in your mouth. The bowl was beautiful and the temp of the broth is how soup should be...steaming hot! WOW. \n\nAnd folks, this is why this soup would be my last meal on earth. It's absolute heaven. And this restaurant created this wonderful concoction. So next time you go to this restaurant, sit down and enjoy their won ton soup. No soup will ever taste that good.", "author": "Charlene C."}

So I read about this place, Jasmine Tea House, and decided to try to order from them.\n\nI had a hard time making my order and I initially told them the wrong address - but in spite of that, they were very patient with me.\n\nI ordered vegetable delight, asparagus with black bean sauce, the complementary vegetable chow mein that comes with two entrees, steamed rice, and vegetable potstickers.\n\nThey came in half an hour, and only charged me $24. They were very polite. I gave them a $3 tip.\n\nIn spite of my difficulty with ordering, it was all there!  With extra sauce, utensils, and fortune cookies.\n\nThe asparagus with black bean sauce was wonderfully saucy, with onions and bell peppers.  The asparagus was nice and crisp and juicy, done to perfection.\n\nThe chow mein noodles were subtly flavorful, not too greasy, with lots of fresh vegetables - bok choy, broccoli, cabbage... (a lot of cruciferous veggies, huh?)  I've always had trouble eating greasy foods, so it was a pleasant surprise to find them without too much, instead chewy and good.  I put a little of the black bean sauce from the asparagus dish on it, and it tasted even better. :)\n\nThe vegetable delight was perfect, mild with crisp veggies - bok choy, mushrooms, broccoli, carrots, lettuce... It dripped on me a bit, but that's because they didn't scrimp on the sauce.  With all the dishes, they filled the containers all the way, and the balance between sauces and veggies was always perfect.  I never felt like they were stingy about the main course. :)\n\nI saved the potstickers for last - mmmm! Yummm!  They had a hint of ginger in them, and though they were slightly greasy to the touch (as you'd expect) they weren't dripping in grease.  They were full, hearty potstickers... doughy and good with the right amount of veggies inside. I just need to put a little soy sauce on them to make them perfect.\n\nAll in all, the food, the service, are great.  I highly recommend the asparagus in black bean sauce, especially much - it was my favorite out of all the dishes.  It was perfect for ordering delivery, perfect food to mellow out a confusing day (and for the little one!).\n\nThank you, Jasmine Tea House, I'll be back. ;)", "author": "Yvea E."}

I was brought to Jasmine Tea House by a vegetarian friend and she said, you have to try the fake meat. At first I was apprehensive since I've had the fake meats sold at Safeway and have never been satisfied, but I still gave it a shot and I'm so glad I did. I recommend the sesame or garlic chicken with the fake meat - the \"meat\" is fried so it's crispy on the outside but has a spongyish texture on the inside which I'd say was similar to ground chicken. The sauces on their food is very good, sometimes on the saltish side, so it goes great with the \"meat.\"\n\nJasmine Tea house is a great place for lunch because of their long list of lunch specials which only cost you a whopping $5.25-6.25!

So as soon as I got my car back from the shop, I drove on over and picked some up!\n\nI must say, for all the stellar reviews of the fake chicken on this board, I was a lil disappointed. I guess as far as fake chicken goes, it had good texture. But I have come to two conclusions: 1) maybe I am vegan because I just don't love chicken and 2) even if it is a good replica for the real thing, all it's replicating it greasy, breaded, fried chinese food. I forgot how nasty easting chinese food makes me feel! Plus they put egg in my veggie fried rice. I know I should have asked them not to (I forgot), but I sorta thought that if they were serving me fake meat they wouldn't egg up my rice.

So, being that our friend lives in Bernal Heights, the Jasmine was a short two block walk away.\n\nAt first, I felt the service was a bit slow seeing as that it wasn't busy but, when our order was finally taken, the waitress was friendly as hell. This is the first time I've ever seen the waitress/waiter actually write the order down in Chinese! I thought that was a nice touch.\n\nWithin 10 minutes, our food started to arrive. We ordered Orange Chicken, Veggie chow mein, and Mongolian beef. All of it was spicy but all of it was wonderful! Between the three of us, we nearly cleared all three plates, and left with the feeling of satisfaction.\n\nI had read somewhere that Yelp has helped improve the service of restaurants in the city, and If this place was any inclination to that being true, I don't know what is.\n\nAlso to note: Their beer, sake and wine is very affordable.

The orange fake chicken is particularly good (not on the menu, I don't think) and so is the curry fake chicken - they're happy to substitute mock chicken for real chicken on anything they have, and both ordering via phone and in the restaurant they've been nothing but amenable when I feel like trying something creative or unlisted.\n\nLoses a star, however, because the pure tofu dishes really just aren't that great (kung pao tofu, etc); as a vegetarian, you're better off sticking with the faux meat.

We stopped by here Jasmin Tea house one Saturday afternoon and stumbled across the \"large\" vegetarian dim sum selection. I ordered Steamed Tofu Roll (3), Vegetable Dumpling (3), Chive Dumpling (3) and liked them in that order.  The name Steamed Tofu Roll isn't very descriptive for those of you who are new to dim sum; they are in fact steamed fried tofu skin wrapped around julienne veggies. The normal version often comes with dice pork and shrimp and Jasmine Tea House does a fine vegetarian version.  The Vegetable Dumplings and Chive Dumplings are pretty good as well although the dumpling skin is a little on the thick side. In order for me to be full at say Yank Sing, I would probably need 4 plates of dim sums all to myself.  The dumplings/servings at the Jasmine Tea House are huge.  I basically ate half and pack the rest home.  At $2.95 each, the price is right.

Most of the reviews were decent so we figured we'd give it a shot.... unfortunately it was a mistake.\n\nWe ordered the pork buns, combination wonton soup, pork fired rice, and beef with broccoli.  A bunch of basic items that are pretty hard to make bad, but this place succeeded.\n\nThe pork buns were all bun and no pork with very minimal flavor. This was the highlight of the meal.\n\nThe wonton soup looked like it had leftover meat thrown on top from a bunch of different types dishes.  What was supposed to be beef I didn't even recognize.  The container was jam packed with wontons, meat scraps, and a few veges with a little broth non of which had any flavor or good texture.  the secret to good wonton soup is keep it light, keep it simple and have great but not overpowering flavor and this had none of that.\n\nNext we tried the beef with broccoli.  I took two bites of this dish and immediately stopped eating.  The texture of the meat was not even recognizable of beef and had no good flavor what so ever.  The broccoli was all over cooked and the sauce was thick and once again... tasted of nothing.\n\nlastly I tried the pork fried rice which I thought could not in any way be as bad as the other items.  The good news is that it wasn't as bad, but it still was not good.  The only flavor the dish contained was that of oil.  no soy sauce, no egg, no onion, no pork... just oil.  after four bites I was done.\n\nso after paying about $30 I had eaten about 12 bites of food and decided I couldn't eat any more of it.  I packed it all back up, tossed it in the trash and threw in a frozen pizza, which is sad to say was much cheaper and much more delicious than my take home meal from Jasmine Tea House.", "author": "Lamar H."}

I'd recommend drinking a lot of water or avoiding this place all together if you're particularly MSG-sensitive.

I mostly get delivery, but, I've also eaten in a few times.  Admittedly, the dim sum items could use a little bit of work - but, they get some credit back for offering them anytime of day.  I love their seafood, vegetarian, and \"chef's special\" dishes.  Their mu shu and chow mein are some of the best I've had - they are my favorites.  And their hot and sour soup also passes my test - a bit more sour than hot, so I sometimes add a wee bit of hot sauce.  However, sometimes I ask them to make it hot and they always happily oblige.  Also, they are ridiculously nice and lovely people, both when I'm ordering delivery and visiting.  Admittedly, I wouldn't trek across the city to go here because there are many other great Chinese places in other parts of the City (San Tung was my favorite when I lived over in the Inner Sunset), BUT, if you're in the hood, this is really good.\n\nHowever, please don't try and compare this place to Eric's or Alice's - those two places put a California twist on their dishes that Jasmine doesn't even try (and sometimes that California twist FAILS MISERABLY, in my opinion).  But, for straight ahead Chinese food, I've never gone wrong here.", "author": "Chris P."}

They were bland at first, but it turns out all the sauce was at the bottom of the carton.  After a few days the beans at the bottom were soggy but delicious!  Upgrade to 4 stars.\n\n---------------\n\nSome hits, some misses here.  I ordered delivery because I was sick as a dog and couldn't cook or go out to eat.  I was craving chinese food for some strange reason, especially since I grew up eating mostly chinese food and don't go for it much these days.  Call it delerium.\n\nIn any case, I ordered a mix of four items, planning on living off the leftovers for a few days while I recuperate.  I had the mu shu chicken, general tso's chicken, dried sauteed green beans, and fish balls and seaweed soup.  Since I ordered two or more entrees I got my choice of free fried rice or chow mein.  I went with the chicken chow mein.\n\nThe misses first.  The chow mein was bland and tasteless.  I had to add pepper and chili sauce to eke any modicum of flavor out of it.  The green beans were the same.  Now I'm no super chili eater, but the green beans are listed on the menu as spicy, and I didn't get even a tingle.  It had less kick than a jar of Tostito's medium salsa.\n\nNow the hits.  The general tso's chicken was very flavorful and still crunchy under all that sweet and vinegary sauce.  It could've been spicier however.  The soup was delicious.  Good flavor of seaweed mixed in with fresh fish balls.  My only complaint is too much egg flower and corn starch.  The mu shu chicken had good flavor as well, though the filling was very watery and soggy, causing most of my wraps to burst open as I was trying to eat them.\n\nAll in all an ok experience for the price.  Price with tax was less than $8 per dish, plus free chow mein.  I will try them once more for their vegetarian dishes, as I love chinese vegetarian food.", "author": "Chris C."}

While chatting with someone at my local produce market, discussing veggie meats, he raved about this place. I came home and read the yelp reviews....looking good! \nI was disappointed for a variety of reasons. One is that the food is simply okay. Nothing to cause orgasmic sounds while eating. Not even close. Corn starch in everything. I had the veggie chicken kung pao. I've had way better with fake meat elsewhere. My friend had the shrimp, chicken, eggplant whatever. One star for the brown rice. Remove that star for failing to offer or bring chop sticks. I happen to love the sticks and was shocked that the assumption was, or at least appeared to be, that all white folks can't use them. I asked and our \"i'd rather be anywhere but here\" faced waiter brought two pair. Mine had old sauce on them. Sauce that was apparently so corn starched thickened that it turned into a paste. A brown paste. \nThe artwork on the walls and the white tablecloth were both filthy. The claim to fame may be that Bill Clinton ordered food to go, but remember that he was also a huge Mc Donalds fan.\nI will not be going back. If you want good fake meat, head over to Love 'n Haight. Their score card from the health dept. is nearly 100, far better (although I didn't see this one) than the Jasmine Tea House. At Love 'n Haight they are real and friendly!

After reading all the reviews on Yelp, I was really excited to try out the Jasmine Tea House. As I picked up my takeout in the pleasant little restaurant tonight, I was even already imagining calling the boyfriend to tell him I'd found the place.\n\nAs it turns out, I hadn't.\n\nMind you, this place isn't bad at all. It's just not spectacular. The high point of my meal was the scallion pancakes, which were flaky and tasty and, overall, the best I've had around here. The potstickers were also completely unflawed, which, in a food that's so easy to screw up, is as much as I dare to hope for.\n\nNow maybe I was so thrilled by the yummy appetizers that I didn't properly save myself for the main course, but even if that's the case, it just can't justify how lackluster the kung pao chicken was. While there was nothing truly bad about it, the sauce was thin and watery and, worst of all, there was next to no spice! Sad showing, kung pao.\n\nMy takeout dinner from here set me back more than eighteen dollars, and while it was enough for two people or two meals, that's still not cheap. I'll go back there again, for sure, because it's the best Chinese restaurant within walking distance of my house (people who live near here will vouch that that isn't saying too much), but I'm very sorry to say it wasn't the source of culinary delight I'd hope it would be.", "author": "Joanna L."}

After some careful reading I decided on Jasmine Tea House.  What a mistake!  All of the food was extremely greasy, and lacked seasoning.  Between 4 people, we ordered 2 appetizers, 2 soups, and 4 entrees.  Everything (except the BBQ pork buns) tasted soggy, oily, and indistinguishable.  The food was so disappointing that we stopped eating it and threw it away.  $60 + dollars literally down the drain!", "author": "Kelly M."}

I've never done takeout so I couldn't tell you about that but in general it really doesn't matter which restaurant you order takeout from the food will never taste the same as when you order to eat in because by the time the food gets to you since its in a container the temperature from the hot food continues to cook the food so the taste of the food is compromised. SO.... this place is great. I don't understand some of the negative reviews but then again everyone has different taste.  But I have great taste so I give this place 4 stars. Check it out you won't be disappointed.", "author": "M R."}

The dim sum are bland and rubbery, and it's not just because I had it delivered.  There is a distinctive lack of flavor in most of the dishes.  The soy, chili sauce, and vinegar supplied with the dim sum overpower the flavor easily.  I am with the other posters about some sort of deep funk smell that pervades their dishes.  The hot and sour soup was not hot, it was brown, and bland, with sour so it was weird.  The peking duck was dry and not salty or crispy or lush like I am used to.  I really hoped for some yummy chinese food, and I think I learned a lesson about using Yelp, that's good.  I wish I had something good to report.", "author": "Privacy P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-07", "description": "One word: Ostrich. Yes, you heard right - ostrich. Basil Ostrich in fact. It tastes like tender, juicy but not as salty beef. But it's ostrich. Anyway, besides ostrich and frog legs, Jasmine Tea House has other standard fare. Though most dishes I've tried were on the bland side, nothing that your own spicing up won't remedy. Oh, and I say your own because I've never eaten at the actual restaurant. And why would I when they deliver AND if you order 2 entrees, they throw in a free chow mein or fried rice dish? Uh, yeah! So my decision to call in an order one night when it was pouring rain was well well worth it. Besides the delicious ostrich, I had an order of Happy Buddha - a cornucopia of veggies, fried tofu and mock chicken. The mock chicken was so good, I got confused for a second and thought I had ordered 2 meat dishes. The other notable in my order? Wor Won Ton soup! I don't know if the cold pouring rain made the delectable concoction of wonton, slices of pork and fresh veggies all the more enjoyable but it was the perfect prescription for the wet weather blues.", "author": "ray e."}

I don't understand it, but it has caused me to eat at a lot more random Chinese places than I care to admit. A few weeks ago it brought us to Jasmine Tea house for lunch. I think this place has turned me into a Chinese food addict. First of all, their lunch specials are $5.25 for a huge huge portion of food, soup and rice. For someone who loves going out to eat, but has become sick of spending hundreds of dollars on a good meal, this made me immediately happy. I try to be pretty health conscious so I always feel guilty eating Chinese food but all the veggies in the dishes are steamed, the chicken is whole pieces of white meat and depending on the dish, some of it isn't even breaded. I very rarely suggest that we go out for Chinese, but I suggested we go back a few days ago and my hungover food craving from NYE is probably going to bring us back today. I would give it 5 stars, and for the price maybe I should. Perhaps toady's visit will earn the place a perfect score=)", "author": "Lindsay B."}
