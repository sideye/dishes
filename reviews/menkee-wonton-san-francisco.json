This is a great place if you like good simple Chinese's dishes for the low.\nThis is a place for the person that doesn't need catering as he service is not the best. Don't expect a warm \"good afternoon, can I start you off with a drink?\" Attitude because I'm my 25 years of going here it has never happened. \n\nThings to order:\n1. I always order a wonton mein bowl(I believe it's about $2-3) it comes quick and hot with freshly made wontons and noodles with a little cabbage, so good! \n\n2.Minced beef over rice($5-6) is so simple but satisfying. It's just ground beef with peas smothered in a gravy sauce over rice. \n\n3. Fried noodles over beef (geen mein) and ask for gravy (sup-chaw). This has to be the best dish and is a favorite when I come.\n\n4. All the chow fund are really good, I'm a gravy person so I always ordered them with gravy. \n\n\nI give this place a 5 because it reminds me of Hong Kong with the good prices, simple authentic dishes and the service is real, not that overly caked on let me squeeze you for tip money type attitude.*****", "author": "Ted L."}

Yes, the chef has a foul mouth. Don't come for the service or ambiance , but definitely come for the food. This is Chinese mama homing cooking at its best. Every bite reminds me of a festive family gathering. Did I mention that it was super cheap($2.00-7.95). \n\nI'm a big fan of the following : \n\nSweet & Sour pork: tender pork Lightly dusted with flour and fried to perfection. It doesn't taste like your typical fried fritter.  The sauce don't not have too much food coloring. \n\nStuffed eggplant was so yummy. \n\nChicken / string beans, broccoli, bottle melon cooked in light soy, ginger and garlic . Tender and fresh. \n\nStuffed fried tofu : nicely crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. The black bean sauce makes this a wonderful savory dish. \n\nWet eggs with shrimp on hor fun(thick noodles). Wholly \u00a3*\u20ac* that's good stuff. \n\nScramble eggs with chives was fluffy with the right amount of seasoning.\n\nDefinitely Chinese food at its best.", "author": "Joe L."}

While the food is nothing to write home about, it is passible in a pinch. Over the years, the service, which was pretty nonexistent has only gotten worse. The young woman/girl who answers the phone and helps with takeout orders is the most apathetic, low energy person I have ever encountered in a customer facing role.  This is not just a she's having a bad day thing, it is literally every time I've ever interacted with her.\n\nToday, I've placed my last order. I ordered a wonton soup and dry fried flat noodles with vegetables, which I repeated twice. This young woman/girl is always in such a rush to get off the phone and she ended up taking my order incorrectly.  When I arrived to pick up my order and questioned the total, she had charged me for beef dry fried flat noodles. When I told her I had ordered vegetables and not beef, she proceeds to turn around and in my view, pick out the beef from the container, rather than request a new order from the cook. I'm sorry...really?! Where is this ok? When I requested a new order, she said they were low on chow fun noodles. \n\nNeedless to say, I left without my chow fun. As a side note, this is the second or third time that I have caught her overcharging me. The price is no longer worth it for the food quality and total lack of customer service. Also, their major downgrade by the health department no longer makes this a viable option for me. There are plenty of other options in any direction.", "author": "M Y."}

You can really taste that char flavor. We always get it dry, but wet is just as good too!), tomato beef over fried noodles, Singapore mai fun, eggplant chicken over rice, fried stuffed tofu (appetizer), wet egg & chicken over rice (I promise it tastes better than it sounds!

Food is cheap and tasty, Salt & Pepper Fish Fillet and some sorta chow fun for me ala carte. Consistent always. \n\nSo, if this isn't the first review you've read on MenKee, there's the issue of a specific staff person: and it's not the friendly older lady who only speaks Chinese or the younger skinnier dude who doesn't smile, but you don't need him to. \n\nI worked in a Chinese restaurant, and I'm Chinatown kid, so I don't expect, or even want excessive courtesy or attention from the wait staff. I've eaten at Michelin starred establishments and cringe the whole way through, hating the staff refilling my cup every half minute and ducking under my armpit to shovel crumbs off the fine linen. I don't care about service. I should also mention that I work in mental health, and have among others, worked with former violent and sexual offenders. So what I'm saying is, I have a pretty damned high tolerance. \n\nAnd yet, when I see her, this tiny frumpy little girl, her round, metal frame goggles clamped over an incurable scowl, and somehow, something hateful boils in me. I could understand that perhaps she hates her job, hates her customers, hates her family even (it could only be family who keeps her on) and I empathize, with her, really I do. I've been there, been her, grinned through work and spent the nights after seething about it. I empathize really, but that doesn't mean getting treated like butt-smear on a shoe gets my appetite revved.  \n\nI hated but faked it through my restaurant service for my family, not the patrons. I pray for the sake of the business she can find it in herself to come to the same conclusion.  Come and go quickly for the cheap eats: under no conditions stay for the service.", "author": "Boxer Rebel L."}

The food is authentic HK restaurant food - great wok skill and decent quality of meat.  I'm sold!  \n\nThe service is ok.  It is family run, and the kids are pretty good at taking orders.  The mom seems to be always mad at something.  I guess if I had to wake up at 6am everyday to prepare the food for the day, I would be pretty pissed too.  Anyway, the service is ok, not that bad and compared to other Chinese restaurants, it is average.\n\nI know the appearance of this place is appalling, but keep in mind that the kitchen is open.  Thus the oil will be bound to travel onto the tables.  From my experience with restaurants: having an open kitchen will always be cleaner than one hidden in the back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-01-23", "description": "1977 famous movie quote from Princess Leia: \"Help me Obi Wan Kanobi you're my only hope\"\n\nLike Leia, I was hoping Obi Wan MenKee could be the Chiu Chow cuisine savior it claims to be. Literally this is the only Chiu Chow Cantonese place I know of, Vietnamese Chinese people running Chiu Chow esque noodle shops aside (which is a completely different approach). \n\nInstead I got Obi Half, or maybe Obi Zero. Not Coke Zero.\n\nWhere do I begin? Chiu Chow cuisine in Hong Kong has basically 3 styles and approaches. The first is when Chiu Chow/Teochew used to be heavily influenced by Min cuisine (Fujian), thus oyster noodles, pork intestine soups and dishes, and mee sua/noodles, thus some of that influence rubbed off on the cuisine. This is why you see oyster pancakes/oyster omlettes (pan fried) in Taiwanese street food, and also in Chiu Chow restaurants all over Hong Kong (and also you can find it in Fujian too). A good oyster pancake is a sign of having steady access to insanely fresh local seafood (or an oyster farm). But this is San Francisco....we have to forgive this shortcoming.\n\nThe other \"soul\" of Chiu Chow cuisine is what is deemed \"lo shui\" or a complex soy sauce based marinade that contains a lot of proprietary ingredients, spices, and herbs. Bird, meat, fowl, tofu, and fowl innards/wings/feet/tongue....it goes in that marinade, then gets cooked, and served as appetizers or entrees, really top notch stuff. For fowl, goose is the leader, but duck can be common. The marinade is like a family sauce, never discarded and always added to it. The longer the history of a restaurant, the better the sauce. It's the same principle for the anago (sea eel) sushi nikiri brush sauce at the very traditional restaurants (e.g. Sushi Bun by Tsukiji Fish Market Uogashi, 120 year old 5th generation owner, using the original sauce simmered down from eel bones, and a separate brush sauce for abalone and clams, the sauce is continuously cooking and added to, you know dat chit is going to be awesome). \n\n\"Da Lang\" is basically Chiu Chow slang for eating a combination of Chiu Chow snack food (to be consumed with liquor or beer), sometimes room temperature to cold food (including cold crabs and yes...cold fish like mullet head or \"big eye chicken\" which is a small red fish with a large eye, like kinmedai). But on the same menu you can also order stuff like marinated cubed pork blood jelly, peanut with pig tail, pepper pork stomach pickled veg soup, and goose intestines is some of the best stuff in the world.\n\nSo let's just say that 3 stars is overtly generous for MenKee that claims to offer Chiu Chow style \"Da Lang\". If you set your expectations to negative, it might be ok. But let's just say that their offerings do not reflect Chiu Chow cuisine in Hong Kong and it will not remind you of anything, not even close.\n\nThe selections are mostly relegated to stir fry or deep fry. Thus there is nothing that involves cold dishes or cold seafood from a menu glance. There is definitely nothing that is lo shui marinated, except quite possible a \"Chiu Chow Duck\" dish...and even that was sold out last night, and I wasn't feeling $8.50 for a plate of soy sauce marinated duck tongues. So the lack of lo shui marinade eats (and perhaps the low turnover of items from this menu), is a major red flag.\n\nWith that said, alarm bells were going off. Dirty floors, which while may be fine in Hong Kong, seemed out of place in SF. The food is overall affordable (wouldn't say cheap) and if you are looking to fill your stomach without expectations, is perfectly fine.\n\nChiu Chow style chicken with Jinchiew sauce - I really don't know how else to describe this dish, but photos tell a story. What it should really look like:\n\nhttp://media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/photo/xi55wdsIjbFYkxUuys_j9Q/l\n\nBut instead I got black pepper sauce chicken with celery and bell pepper stir fry.\n\nIf they labeled it black pepper sauce chicken in Chinese I would have been fine with it. But sorry, this is not Chinjiew sauce chicken....\n\nChiu Chow Congee - this is excellent in Hong Kong. It does not taste like congee that you and I know it...textural heaven and something about the way the rice and the liquid in the congee interact. But here it is a slop job. $hit.... undercooked congee/overcooked rice drowning in water. I could have made this bad job at home myself. The only saving grace was that they provided a portion of \"hahm suan choy\" (salted pickled veg), very salty...but made it more palatable. Though I have no idea if they made it themselves (doubtful), so likely store bought with who knows what chemicals inside.\n\nOyster pancake - dubbed Chiu Chow style. This was the best dish of the night, and a saving grace. But overall still average. Let's forget for a moment that getting fresh baby oysters is a challenge in this part of town, so the freshness of the oysters is of course in doubt...but it was at least tasty. Putting more oysters in would have been nice.\n\nCheap eat for the area. 2.70 stars", "author": "Ken K."}

I can also count on it being a little dirty, but hey, if you've ever been to HK, this is nothing so be quiet and eat your food!\n\nThe two dishes I HAVE to get here are: 1) Wonton noodle soup. I know it sounds simple but they make it SO delicious. It's one of those dishes you can eat without ever putting your chopsticks down. I don't know if its the noodles (do they make it themselves?) or the soup base, but the combination of all the flavors is just amazing. You can add whatever meat you want in there. I normally like duck. SO YUMMY! 2) Fried tofu. OMG. I love this dish. Super crispy on the outside, warm and soft in the inside. It's perfect every time, every piece. The black sauce they use over it compliments the dish so well.\n\nWhat I also love about Chinese food - it's cheap! Good food for a good price. Can't go wrong here.", "author": "Rosie W."}

So I ask what is on the party tray menu.  As rude and as much attitude as you can get, she yelled at me that it's all in the menu waving in some general direction towards the door.

Perhaps it was one specific childhood/teenage memory that always led me back to this place. I always remembered the won ton noodles being amazing. It's been a at least a year or two since I've been back, so it crossed my mind the past couple days.\n\nYesterday I had a won ton noodles craving, and headed over to Ming Tai Wun-Tun Noodle. Today, I ended up here and had won ton noodles for the second day in a row. Unfortunately, I must say that I did not let my childhood memories cloud my judgement today.\n\nThe won ton noodles were a complete steal! They were about $3 a bowl, which is pretty much unheard of. There is an extremely extensive menu, and I saw the majority of other people eating plates (noodle plates/rice plates etc), so perhaps there are better dishes than just won ton noodles. \n\nThe won tons were just alright, nothing special at all. The shrimp didn't seem to be as fresh, and not nearly as much or as big as Ming Tai. The noodles were a hit, just like I remembered. They had that bouncy, chewy texture to it, which is an absolute necessity for won ton noodles. The soup was good as well, and I like that they put a few pieces of lettuce in there as well.\n\nNow the restaurant itself is sticky icky, and I barely wanted to touch anything. This place is definitely run down, and they get a ton of to go orders, so don't expect to get very attentive customer service. \n\nOverall, this spot has AWESOME PRICES, and great won ton NOODLES.

What the heck was that??). She realized we didn't speak Chinese, and pulled her middle-school-aged daughter from the back to translate. I guess this daughter is at the peak of her rebellious stage, because she was yelling at her mom about how she didn't want to help and rolling her eyes as she came out. \n\nSo we tell this also angry girl what we want (frozen, UNCOOKED dumplings), and she just yelled something to her mom in Chinese without making any eye contact with us. The next moment, we see the kitchen guy throw 6 orders worth of dumplings in the pot!! I tried to tell them \"No no no..!\" but by then the lazy little girl with the devilish attitude has walked away. When we try to tell the woman, she waved her hand at our faces as though she was annoyed that we were trying to talk to her when she didn't understand English. Outraged, I tried to walk out of the restaurant. Then the guy from the kitchen came out ask us what the problem was. He barely spoke English too, but was kind enough to listen, and gave us what we wanted. No hassle. He was actually happy to hear that he didn't need to cook anything.\n\nAfterwards we tried to pay, and the angry woman with the bloody red nose snatched our bills and threw down the change on the sticky, oil-slicked table. \n\nThe dumplings were pretty good but the woman that works there probably brainstorms every night on how rude she can be to the customers.

After walking up and down  Noriega in the drizzle I decided that a bowl of wontons was needed. \r\nThe small dining room is surprisingly tidier and more pleasant than the entrance lets on. I went for the take out option and the order taker lady was pretty friendly. Duck wonton soup to go, $4.83 including tax and the discount, was a decent 3 star bowl. It was difficult to opt for Menkee when my favorite wontons were down the street, but I had to satisfy the curiosity. Lightly flavored broth slightly enhanced with msg, held a flotilla of small, brussel sprout sized wontons. The skins were the appropriate thinness without any doughy bits. The ground pork and chopped shrimp filling was serviceable, but nothing to write home about. A sprinkling of chopped scallions and some cabbage added balance. \r\nMenkee's strength is their low prices and varied menu. Run, don't walk, down there to get on the special of dried pig skin and pig blood with chives for $3.25/lb.
