By no means is it breathtakingly beautiful but it's great for walks and jogs or just sitting to journal and meditate. Additionally, there is a golf course and people who commonly kayak and dragonboat on the lake.\n\nIt's hardly crowded in that you will have room for yourself and simply enjoy your surroundings. The park parts of Lake Merced are nice for bbqs. If you're a runner, a lap around the entire lake is about 4-5 miles. There's something for everyone at Lake Merced and it's frankly a hidden gem in SF which I'm not complaining about.", "author": "Derek T."}

It's also attached to Harding Park where you can take a nice quick water or bathroom break, or if you wanted to do a nature walk. \n\nThe view here is absolutely beautiful. It's one of the many places where, the Bay Area's beauty shines through, without all the buildings distracting you. It's also very convenient since it is near Stonestown Galleria, Westlake, and SF State. So if you live nearby, Lake Merced is easily accessible or if you just want to stop by to get something to eat after a run, you can do so very easily. \n\nAfter about every 2 miles or so, there's a portable bathrooms and water fountains located. The parking here is ok. There are sidewalk parking throughout the park. There's also parking inside Harding Park, as well as 3 small areas to park at each end of the park and middle of the park. Not only that, but I love the little health boards that remind you about breathing, and proper stretches exercise located near the park. Also, the little wooden marks reminding you how many bikes you've ran.\n\nOne of the cons about this place is the traffic surrounding the area. Lake Merced is next to the highway and school. So there's a lot of ongoing traffic around the afternoon and early morning as well. It can be a little off putting hearing all the cars rush by and a little dangerous at time since the sidewalk is close by the highway. As of recently, the bushes and trees have not been trimmed around here, so the lake is a bit hidden nowadays. \n\nIt's a great park when it's all said and done. Great for a quick run and nature walks.", "author": "Oliver B."}

You turn into a small driveway that leads up to a lake and see the small boat docks for canoeing and kayaking and ducks and gulls paddling around in the water. \n\nYou don't feel at all like you're in San Francisco, in the very best way. It's quiet and the air smells fresh, like eucalyptus.\n\nSF Parks and Rec has a modern but unobtrusive building with multi-purpose rooms perfect for off-site meetings. It may also double as a banquet space but I'm not sure?\n\nLake Merced offers a 4-mile circuit around the waterfront and you'll see people jogging or walking their dogs. \n\nJust a half mile away from the Great Highway with its lonely but beautiful stretch along the coastline, look at the dunes, California wildflowers and white caps and you'll see and feel the old California, boho and just a little wild.  \n\nBoz Scaggs playing low as you drive northward is a lovely accompaniment to the view.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

Although, when we were there we had some difficulties finding a way to walk around the lake. We couldn't find a path or walkway around the lake, which is a bummer because that would have been awesome! Instead, we went to one of the areas where there was a dock and a little pathway to walk around. This is definitely not a strenuous walk and anyone could do this walk really. You can also walk through the golf course which is neat if you're not playing! The golf course itself is huge!! \n\nIf you're into fishing I saw people set up with fishing poles so I think you're definitely allowed to fish here!

The path that goes around the entire lake area is around 5mi and there are certain loops within the lake area to make shorter interval training possible. Another nice reason to jog and/or take a walk here is that I've never found it to be crowded since it isn't much of a touristy area. Things are more on the relaxing side here with some people playing golf, others rowing in dragonboats, and some feeding the ducks using old pieces of bread.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-26", "description": "This review is meant to appeal to the runners out in Yelp-land. \n\nIf one looks at Lake Merced as the face of a clock, where 12 o'clock is Sloat Blvd. & 6 o'clock is Westlake Shopping Center, then running around the lake in a clockwise direction (where we all observe the 'walk on the right rule') means you'll often have a non-paved path under foot. My guess is that one can run the unpaved path, varying from smooth and wide to narrow and uneven, for seemingly well over half the way 'round the lake. \n\nOne lake loop is just under 4.5 miles, the short-cut over the wee bridge is approx. 4 miles. There are four lots in which to park. The, sort of, most official parking area is off Skyline Blvd. & also doubles as the entrance to the golf course. A proper toilet, benches & a grassy park area are found here as well. Another decent-sized parking area with at least one bench, some work-out bars, and an icky port-a-potty is to be found at Lake Merced & Sunset Blvds. The third parking area, if memory serves, is unpaved, and found at Lake Merced Blvd., just south of Brotherhood Way. The smallest lot is on John Muir Dr. just at the bridge where benches, a few picnic tables, a water fountain, and a super manky port-a-potty are located.\n\nCar exhaust is an issue when running the lake. The super early bird catches the least amount of cars, so 'bravo!' to those up at the crack of dawn for an undisturbed run. I've had luck running the odd weekday just after noon when there seems to be less cars on the road. Early evening on a weekday may see a less traveled jog path, but Lake Merced & Skyline will have a decent amount of traffic flowing. Normally, however, we're all here--walkers, joggers, cyclists--at the weekend & it can be a bit of a full house both on the path & in the street. \n\nPros: lovely views of the lake & attendant golf course; the smell of eucalyptus; toilets at the Skyline entrance.\n\nCons: car exhaust; unpaved footpath, while fairly decent, really isn't wide enough for 'two-way' traffic; the occassional four-legged ankle nipper/sniffer", "author": "Bea B."}

However, if you're running more inland, the loop can get a bit dull if you're just staring at cars the entire time. However, those stretches don't take too much time to run by and you'll be back along the waterfront in no time.\n\nThere aren't any tough hills, since this is a gentle rolling course, so you can push yourself as much or as little as you want to. I will definitely return to this lake and trail to keep running.", "author": "Kat P."}

The pond side is more flatter than the lakeside.  \n\nIf youre just getting into running I recommend running around the pond side of the lake first for as many laps as you want then graduating to running around the larger part of the lake or the whole lake when you feel ready.  I made the mistake of running around the whole lake on my first try in many years and came down with a weird sensation with swallowing in my throat.  Im not entirely sure if it came from running around Lake Merced.  \n\nThe cement bridge that divides the pond and the lake has lots of graffiti and more recently has a bike sitting to the side with missing parts.  About a month ago a couple spotted and pointed out to me a coyote hiding behind the bushes that is situatated to the right after you come off the cement bridge passing the sign about the history of the farralon islands and Lake Merced on the same side of the bridge where the penguin statue is.

Since I couldn't find any real measurements, I took matters into my own hands and google mapped the area.  While it's off by a few feet, I think it's quite accurate.  I uploaded a map of the area just in case you're curious.  According to Google maps, the perimeter is approximately 4.5 miles.\n\nAnyhow, last Monday was my first visit to Lake Merced.  I rode my bike around the Lake to get an idea of the place.  The next day, I drove from San Jose back to Lake Merced to run the lap.  I didn't take any shortcuts and stuck with the dirt road alongside the road.  It took me 36 minutes and I couldn't figure out how far I ran.  I had my pedometer with me, but the reading was inaccurate.  It showed that I ran for only 3.1 miles, which didn't seem correct.  I'm not much of a runner, but without stopping and a good pace, I was able to accomplish the lap in under forty minutes.  And according to Google, 4.5 miles isn't too shabby for that time.  Rock n' Roll Marathon is still ways off in October, but finding a great place like this to jog will encourage me to attain my goal.\n\nI have to agree with most of the reviewers here.  The smell is awful, not only from the lake, but also from the pollution from cars.  It is a good place to run since it has a nice soft dirt path with some shady trees, but I don't suggest running at night either.  I read about the dead bodies found in the lake and it doesn't seem too safe.  There are quite a number of runners/walkers/bikers in the area during the day.  This is my new running spot besides the Great Highway, Golden Gate Park, and of course, the treadmill.  I try not to run on the treadmill unless it's late at night.

Because I am lazy and drive everywhere.  \n\nLucky me, I have Lake Merced right near my house.  There is a path which goes all around the lake and it is equal to 4.5 miles!  Hurrah!  That plus parking a little farther away than usual gets my quota in for the day.\n\nA few things about Lake Merced:\n1/ Lovely place to picnic/BBQ.  Was the location of Euge's \"Jam Out With Your Clam Out\" event, and was neither too cold nor too windy, and this area never gets too crowded.\n\n2/ Path is best suited for walkers, runners, and bikers.  Dog and kid-walkers are better served by going up the road to Fort Funston.  The sound of traffic can be loud on certain parts of the path, so bring your personal listening device of choice.\n\n3/ If you are a cheater (like me), you will sometimes take a shortcut off of the path and end up on Harding Park Golf Course.  Gorgeous golf course, btw.  They are very specific about what trails you can use, so be conscious and respectful.\n\nI haven't seen too many boats on the lake, but SFSU crew team practices there.

I was born and raised in SF and growing up in the sunset this Lake wasn't that far from my childhood home. As children my siblings and I were not just allowed to run outside and ride our bikes.. You probably would get hit by a car. So my parents always took us to Lake Merced where we could ride till exhausted with little to no fear of cars. In the Lake's parking lots I rode roller blades, taught my younger siblings to ride their bikes, and later drove a car for the first time, and a motor cycle too in the same lot. Also in highschool the lake provided me numerous \"make out\" spots. I had my first taste of liquor there. First time I made it to both first and second bases happened there. And later my BF told me he loved me for the first time there.\n\nI also had a stolen car turn up IN the shallow waters of the Lake in front of those cute apartments I was telling you about earlier??\n\nNow, when I got to Lake Merced it's to jog.

But the City and different volunteer organizations have put in alot of hard work to reverse that and  make this a great place to go. Probably for the President's Cup last fall at Harding, and the U.S. Open next year at the Olympic Club. Anywho  My mom runs it all the time and hasn't had a problem with safety.....or hippies.

Though often thought of as the red-haired stepchild of Golden Gate Park, I love Lake Merced. I can overlook the traffic because it is a perfectly-sized natural area that offers a little of everything for the discerning recreation enthusiast. There are boat rentals, fishing, dog areas, BBQ corners, and the ubiquitous golf courses-more about that later. The premier highlight for me is a continuous paved path which runs uninterrupted around both lakes. This 4.4 mile circuit is the best by far area for exercising on equipment like skates and bikes. There are easy grades, a smooth surface and not a single curbed interruption which is phenomenal! My wonderful boyfriend would always accompany me while I walked, ran, biked, and skated those paths-almost daily! It is fairly safe there and I never once had a problem.\n\nOften times shrouded in the fog usually found in the Daly City/Pacifica area, it is a refreshing spot to just hang out in. Looking at the Lake and water is very calming for me, and I don't mind the fact that it's a senior hang out due to the nearby Doelger Senior Center.\n\nThe problem with Lake Merced is since the 1980s-there has been the three massive golf courses which surround it sucking it dry by diverting the ground water for their own irrigation needs. Harding Municipal Golf Course, Olympic Country Club, and San Francisco Golf Club surround and penetrate the lake lands like a glove around its throat-choking the life out of Lake Merced.  As a result, the lake began 'dying' as water levels dropped and water quality fell. The low point was in 1994 as the lake reached an all time low of 14 feet in depth (the top off depth is 30 feet).\n\nThe future is hopeful for Lake Merced. The same group that brought back  Mono Lake in Los Angeles is now involved with Lake Merced. The Mono Lake case set a new legal precedent for protecting the public trust and progress has been made at Lake Merced thanks to Cal Trout's clout.  Draining of the water table has been reduced by 75% and storm water will now be partially diverted into the lakes. As of April 2004, water levels are back up to around 26 feet . I last visited Lake Merced the previous summer and the situation has improved dramatically.  As for me, there is no love lost for the game of golf and the demands it's \"greens\" place on the environment. I wish those goofy-dressed golfers would go somewhere else to whack their balls around!", "author": "Gail P."}

Maybe it's because I come from the land of 10,000 lakes, or maybe it's because my training as a landscape architect has made me overly critical about park design, but I was not impressed.\n\nThe Negative: the main trail runs right along major roadways with no landform or vegetative buffer, so unless you have your iPod blaring, all you hear is traffic ... until you pass by the shooting range, and you hear the firing of rifles.  Not the calm, idyllic atmosphere I was hoping to find.  And views to the lake from the main trail that loops around are not that great.  Boring.\n\nThe Positive: you don't have to cross traffic or worry about stopping for cars as you're running around, except for the occasional driveway entrance to a parking lot, and it's nice that it's a loop ... but I'd rather run through Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, Chrissy Field or along Ocean Beach.\n\nMaybe there are nice spots to hang out and have a picnic off of the main trail.

I had been feeling sorry for myself. I have been wearing sweatpants for weeks. Chocolate bars for dinner. I think it had to do with the foggy weather descending on the sunset after a glorious week of perfect weather two weeks earlier where it was actually so warm that i went swimming at OB without a wetsuit with all those crazy euros who didn't know any better.\nFoggy SF weather is hard to deal with for a native San Diego resident. \n\nAnyway, so I refused to get off my ass for days but this half motivated me. It's about 4 1/3 miles around, virtually flat (as in slight uphill and downhill but nothing to complain about by sf standards) and is a paved trail around uninterrupted by stoplights so what more could you ask for? I look forward to torturing myself by running around this lake three times on 9/20.", "author": "Ashley B."}

For that reason, I have to give this place a 3-star.\n\nAs for the Yelp event, most people were well-prepared in terms of clothes and food.  While most of foods had too much carbohydrate, its variety helped me eat a lot.  Yelpers as usual were good to hang around with.  Other than occasional fights among dogs, we were very cordial (I almost wrote \"animals\" instead of \"we\" :P).  My rice balls went out completely, which surprised me because even with mostly-Japanese picnics, I tend to have some left-overs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-09-26", "description": "I really like Lake Merced because of the fact that it offers one nice long loop for those training for running events. The weather is usually nice and clear and not too hot. You get a decent breeze from the ocean on the north western side of the Lake, and the south eastern side gives you a long slight downhill to make up for the long slight up hill on the opposite side of the lake. \n\nOn the negative side; the loop is also a big loop for cars with the road being just beside the trail you occasionally have to deal with bus fumes and the like. Also, and I implore all walkers. PLEASE walk on the pavement. The reason why a runner like me is running on the dirt path is that when you are running multiple laps, your legs really begin to hurt and tire. You need every aid you can get, and one is the softer ground of the trail vs. the pavement. When you are walking, you really don't need the trail and you force the runner to go around and onto the pavement which can add to their pain. I am very grateful to those walkers (and runners that are going against the grain) that do make room for runners.\n\nIf there were no cars and the trail was wider it would easily get 4 stars.", "author": "riz n."}

The main reason is because the route is a complete loop around the lake, and once you get past a certain point, there's no turning back regardless of how lazy you feel, unless you want to swim.  It forces me to do the entire loop (4.5 miles) and the breeze there is usually very refreshing.  I've been fooled enough times to know that it may be a bit chilly when I start the run, but never, ever wear a long sleeve t-shirt because by the time I'm done, I've taken it off and it becomes a major pain in the azz to carry around while running.\n\nParking is also generally very good, unless there's some type of dragon boating event, which is maybe a few times a year.  There's also usually a medium-ish amount of people around, either running or picnicking, etc so that if you collapse after your run, there will be at least a few people who could call 911 on your behalf.

There's a short cut that takes you over to Fleming/Harding golf course if you don't want to run the entire length.  As you near the road to Harding near the site of the old \"Boathouse\" restaurant, you can enter the area where all the BBQ kings convene for their picnics and watch the dragon boaters practice at various times in the AMs.  Not uncommon to see signs up during the year indicating a race or marathon of some sort along the path.", "author": "Ry T."}

Unfortunately I didn't start until 5:30pm and it was pretty dark.  I figured that the street lights would light up the sidewalk enough, but they didn't cut it.  Once I got to John Muir Dr. there were no lights.  It was kinda scary too and I was afraid someone was going to jump out of the bushes at me and drown me in the lake.  Okay, that's a little extreme but it could happen.  I am currently training for the Kaiser 1/2 marathon and I am a new runner.  I've never really run before at all.  It was a good beginner course and I look forward to running there during the day.  It's not a good idea to go at night cause you might twist an ankle.  Also, there are two trails side by side.  The pavement is on the outside and there is dirt  is on the inside.  Once I'm in better shape I plan to utilize the circuit training equipment that's located along the trail.  If you see me running here, don't laugh...I'm still learning!", "author": "Jennifer B."}

I can barely make it through a mile on the treadmill, but run the 5 mile lap at Lake Merced with ease. I love this trail because of the dirt path which makes it easier on my joints. I also enjoy the breeze and smell of nature during my runs. They completed the area that was under construction... looks good. -.5 for those who WALK on the dirt, thus having me pass by on the concrete. No biggy though..as I don't own the trail. Plenty of parking in different sections of the Lake.", "author": "Simon S."}

But its not kinda place were you can sit and enjoy the beauty of the beach. As others said, the parking lot is kinda small. You can use the bridge, if you are looking for small circle to go around.", "author": "HD S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-06", "description": "For beginners daring to get into active running, this is the best spot for you. It's convenient. There is parking. It's a complete loop. Even though I'm one of the few black folks who run around this lake, I can tell you that it's better to run when it's crowded. Why? If you're running when there aren't a lot of people, you will feel isolated and out of place with all the cars passing by. Moreover, it is not recommended to run at night since it can get really dark along the path.", "author": "Akinyemi O."}

I used to row here with Pacific Rowing Club, it was my first outdoor workout area before that and it was where I discovered just how much I hate golf; or it hates me. In any case Lake Merced is a good runner's area for so many reasons. It can be neatly divided up based on landmarks. There is the dam run where you run south out of the parking lot to the dam and back. Then there's the long dam run where you just cut out that small snippet at the end and just continue around the lake. There's the small lake run where you run north out of the parking lot and cut through the golf course on the way back (mind you, you might get yelled at, oh well). Every now and again you can hear the echo's of gunshots from the Pacific Range and SFPD. Let me tell ya, I didn't know about the gun range when I first started rowing and it is pretty scary being in the water thinking someone is trying to pick you off like a metal duck at a fair booth.", "author": "Alia D."}

I think I like to have more things to look at than a lake and greenery,I dont like the stretch that is near an apartment complex and a shooting range,especially alone or on a foggy day  or at night...I never enjoyed training there for the Nike Women's Marathon with Team in Training...its was always a drag. I would rather run on Ocean Beach and have the ocean view and the breeze as I run with my nikeplus ipod...To me its just a depressing run at the lake.......When I ran the Nike Marathon,Lake Merced was part of the run and it was also the most grueling part of the race as we reached the last leg of the marathon which hit miles 20-23...I hit my wall at the lake with lalaine.....which means we hit our wall of complete exhaustion and pain in our legs that it was unbearable......I remember about to cry running  around that lake and the ghiradelli chocolate mile at around mile 23 still didnt make me a happy camper , I took some and ate it while running umm maybe in tears........so maybe that has alot to do with how I feel about Lake Merced today........I ran it today after the storm broke....and again I hated it....I ran over fallen trees and a poor golden colored fish that apparently got flown out from the lake :( that was sad and on christmas day!! Im sorry Lake lovers......I rather not run LakeMerced...theres other places in SF that are more uplifting for a nice run.......", "author": "Apple S."}
