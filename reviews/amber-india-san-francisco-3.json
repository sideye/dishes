It is walkable from the Moscone convention center. It was a Saturday night and I stopped by for dinner without a reservation and the host said the only availability for 1 person was at a the bar. The full menu is available at the bar. There were several seats open at the bar. \n\nThe restaurant is upscale and the ambiance was lively. The lighting is dim so don't leave your reading glasses at home. \n\nThe bartender was knowledgeable and made several recommendation. I ultimately went with the butter chicken and garlic chive naan. The food came out quickly and both the naan and butter chicken were the perfect temperature. The butter chicken was surprisingly better than I expected. It could have been a bit spicer, but was creamy and flavorful. The naan was the perfect balance between crisp and soft. The portions were plentiful and after having the naan I still had some leftover chicken and gravy. Unlike most of the Indian restaurants I have been to rice is not complimentary but a separate side order. I did not order any dessert but they do have quite the selection of Indian and non-indian desserts along with wine pairings. \n\nOverall, what I ordered was delicious, the service was excellent and I would return to try the tandoori dishes which the bartender had also recommended. However, because the food was a little pricey, I gave it 4 stars. I would suggest making a reservation in advance if going with a larger party.", "author": "Dave S."}

Most Indian lunch buffets are usually around $15. Tandoori chicken was dry as it had been sitting awhile. I have visited other places where I have seen staff check on food frequently and switch out new batch when necessary. Would be great if they invested in steam bath to keep the food warm. Selection was small since I normally see 8-9 entrees at other places. Amber only had 6, 3 meats and 3 veggies. They had swai Cajun spiced that day. Swai is cheap white fish. I've been this once place they had cod on the buffet line. \n\nHaving tried 20 plus different Indian lunch buffets nothing at Amber stood out. I would give them another try to see which dishes would be rotated out. However I would not recommend people go out of my way to visit this place. I can see Amber being good to settle Indian craving if you work nearby. If you have time to travel a bit further I recommend Taj of Marin across the Golden Gate Bridge in San Rafael and Saffron Bistro a bit south in San Carlos. \n\nLastly I would like to note this was the only Indian restaurant I have encountered which used paper straws. This would have been 3 star rating for average lunch buffet experience. Plus 1 star for having environmental friendly straws.", "author": "Jason X."}

The tandoori chicken was dry and a stark contrast to the power packed flavor of the chicken tikka. There's a diverse spread of main courses and plenty to choose from both non vegetarian and vegetarian. They also have a live counter on weekends where they make dishes like pav bhaji, dosas, or some other dishes.\n\nThe only sad part was the naan. If you've eaten butter and garlic naans in India then this would disappoint you just like the other indian restaurants in the Bay Area do in this respect. Good naans are such a commonplace in India that you almost take it for granted and in the US, they are rare and hard to find. \n\nNext time I'll try the a la carte and hoping it would be even better than this buffet!", "author": "Akshat G."}

My boss loves Indian food - and so did the BF. They were meeting for the first time and I wanted to find somewhere that would be quiet enough for us to chat, but also wasn't a trek from the Moscone.\n\nAmber was perfect. We were shown to a corner booth table that was quiet and really allowed us to chat. Our waiter was very friendly and knew just how much attention to give us.\n\nI had the Butter Chicken Curry Pot with a side of garlic naan. My boss had their Saag Paneer Curry Pot, which I tried some of. It was my first time trying it and now I'm cooked. Saag Paneer is spinach cooked with cottage cheese, garlic, and cream. It's sort of like an Indian version of creamed spinach with paneer. Both were phenomenal and I wish I had more naan to mop up all the sauce!\n\nWe split the lava-style chocolate cake for dessert and it was amazing - just the right amount of sweetness.\n\nI think we were at dinner for about two hours and we were never rushed to leave. In fact, we stayed after we paid the check and no one pushed us to go.

The many benefits of working downtown is the abundant food options to choose from. \n\nAmber India provides that luxury and one of the few places that offers an AYCE option for lunch during the weekdays. They have locations in Santana Row in San Jose, Palo Alto, Los Altos and Mountain View. The lone San Francisco location is between the Four Seasons, Park Central, Jewish Museum and Marriott Marquis alley on Yerba Buena Lane. It's in the same strip as Delarosa, Tropisueno and Beard Papa. \n\nFor $21.95, it's a pretty good deal for what they serve, from chicken tandoori, curries, biryani and vegetarian dishes. To be honest, it's your typical AYCE dishes that you'll find at similar Indian restaurants, but the flavor and spices are legit. Also a far cry from our usual cafeteria food that can get boring and bland. I don't want to sound like I'm complaining about free food, but sometimes you just want something authentic that's a fiesta in your mouth that you'll end up doing a siesta after. \n\nHere's a tip: Better get here early for lunch since a majority of the patrons will be choosing the AYCE option; it can fill-up pretty quick.

There's nothing like orange juice and bubbly along with a range of Indian food to perk up a Saturday!\n\nWe showed up around 12:45 and had no problem finding a seat even though it was pretty busy. Even though it's a buffet, it doesn't have a huge  set of selections (maybe about 20 choices) but what's available is both delicious and varied. On top of that, the majority of the options are vegetarian; there's a select few meat options (I believe primarily chicken and goat) but easily 80% of the dishes were vegetarian friendly. Each of the dishes are labeled with the main ingredients listed and while the heat level isn't indicated, it's not hard to tell based on the listing of the chilies and spices, so pick wisely.\n\nA made-to-order dosa table is also available at the buffet, so you can get a fresh and piping hot dosa right away. Our waiter brought over an order of naan and kept our water and Mimosa glasses filled regularly.

That said, compared to other Indian restaurants in the city, they have yet to wow me with one of their dishes. If you come over lunch, they'll have a buffet which makes for a smart investment. I do recommend making a reservation as it can get busy. Pro tip: often they still have seating places near the bar if you do tend to crash the buffet last minute. \n\nGarlic Naan is okay. I eat so much naan that I might be too spoiled. This one is a tad too oily and needs to stay in the tandoori a bit longer. \n\nGood cocktails and big wine selection.

Any other indian restaurants around the area will look at me like \"uh wat\" and then just not give me anything or not give all of them. It's like bruh.. it's an indian restaurant.

I've never been a bit fan of biriyani until I came here - I've always been a roti/paranthe type of fella. At dinner I think it's called the \"Murgh Parda Biryani\". Murgh means chicken, Biryani is the name of the rice dish, and Parda means curtain or covered if I'm not mistaken. This biryani is cooked in a pot covered in naan dough so it's completely encased in bread and stupid dope. You gotta break the bread to get to the baryani and you use the bread to eat it too. super cool tbh. And I've gotta say, the flavor of the baryani is spot on.

We arrived at promptly noon when the restaurant opened.  The buffet is among one of the priciest (~$26/pp including drink), but quality wise among the best.  They have the usual Northern Indian favorites like Tandoori chicken, Saag Paneer, Biryani, Naan, and pakora.  In addition, they have various chaat items (Indian Street Food) and a Dosa station (savory stuffed crepes).  Service was friendly and prompt - our plates were cleared quickly and servers offered refills of your beverage (mango juice, mimosa, etc.).  \n\nMy favorites:\n\n* Saag Paneer - I love the herbed, pureed spinach with paneer (cheese). \n* Both Tandoori chicken and Seekh Kabob were seasoned and juicy.\n* The Dosa was thin and super crispy.  I liked eating it with a side of sambar (spicy vegetable and lentil stew).\n* Pani Puri - these crispy, hollow bread bowls are supposed to be filled with that green, spicy sauce and eaten in a single bite.  My friend mentioned they cost a few cents each in India but most Bay Area places charge $1 each.  So go for the buffet and pig out!\n\nProbably the only dish I didn't like was the semolina hawra dessert, which had a strange texture.  I prefer carrot hawra like the one made at Favorite Indian in San Ramon.\n\nOverall, a solid 4.5 stars rounding up to 5 for the exceptional service and freshness of the buffet offerings.", "author": "Daniel C."}

We started with cocktails-- I had the Kiwi Daisy. It was tart and not too sweet, but still didn't have much flavor. I wasn't impressed, and based on the quality of the drink I would have guessed it would cost $7, not the $15 we paid for it.\n\nFor a main dish, I ordered the Navaratan Korma. Now, this isn't supposed to be a spicy dish, but it is certainly supposed to have flavor. The dish I was served was downright bland. There was barely a trace of spice-- there wasn't enough ginger, or garlic, or cardamom, or masala. If there were any cashews or golden raisins, they disappeared in the sauce. I believe there were some almond slivers? Everything was drowned in the heavy cream sauce, which not only muted flavors, but also upset my stomach after the meal. The vegetables were not cooked properly, and many of them were overcooked and too soft. I had the naan, which was just fine but nothing to write home about. Personally, I thought it was a bit too dry. And the laccha paratha, which is supposed to be flaky and buttery, came out heavy and chewy. It was somehow dripping with grease, yet extremely dry and tough. The only thing I really liked here was the papadum, which is really the same in most Indian restaurants and not made in-house. \n\nAt $19 for the korma, $5 for naan, and another $5 for paratha, I would have hoped this meal would be much, much better. Everything I ate here was overly greasy, flavorless, and tasted like it cost a fraction of what we paid. I've had college campus Indian food that was better than what I was served here. I would not recommend coming here when there are so many good Indian restaurants in the Bay Area.\n\nOh, and when my plates came out-- both the appetizer plate and the main dish plate-- they were both dirty.

While no one likes to wait during your lunch break, if you do so your patience will be rewarded! Plus, since it's a lunch buffet, you won't have to wait for your food to be cooked which saves time.\n\nWhat i appreciate about this buffet is the variety of options. There are many choices for vegetarians, and a good few meat dishes for the omnivores. While all the food is delicious, I especially liked the goat curry, which I feel is rare to find at a buffet.\n\nIn addition to the great choices for entrees at the buffet, there are also lots of choices for dessert too!

I live far, far away in the east bay suburbs. There were some great things and some not so great things about this place.\n\nI was dining with two friends, and we decided to order the Tandoori platter for our appetizer, which was a good choice. Unfortunately, it took almost an hour to come out of the kitchen, but it was a Saturday, and we were not in a rush. The Tandoori meats were superb.\n\nWe each ordered a curry. My friends ordered rice and naan. I ordered roti, and I ordered my food spicy. Everything came out except my roti, which took another 10 minutes. My food, lamb korma, was very bland, and I pointed it out to our waitress, so she took it back to the kitchen. My friend had been served a nicely spiced dish, Lamb Rogan Josh. So the cooks mixed up some Rogan Josh sauce in with my korma sauce and sent it back out to me. The korma was supposed to be creamy, and the rogan josh was a sauce heavily dependent on tomatoes, so the two did not mix well at all. I am not sure why the chefs decided to do that, but it was a bad decision. The lamb in both dishes was extremely tender, but the sauce on mine was spoiled. I took it home with me, but I ended up tasting one bite and throwing the rest out. \n\nOur waitress was an angel and took pity on us for our long wait. She comped our Tandoori platter and brought us out some free strawberry sorbet; it was delicious!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-10", "description": "Amber India is a really interesting restaurant to me...it's unlike any Indian restaurant I've ever been to or ordered from. To begin with, the menu is a bit unusual and different from any other standard Indian menu that you've probably ever seen. They have items \"from the clay plot\" like truffled chicken tikka, salmon pineapple kebob, and \"duet of cauliflower and broccoli.\" The items from their \"curry pot\" menu start to include some of the more familiar items like butter chicken and saag paneer, but the names and descriptions of each dish seem really unusual and like they're trying really hard to be fancy and trendy and \"San Francisco-y\" if you know what I mean. While you can order chicken tikka masala if you ask for it, they don't actually have it on the menu. I found that out this week when I ordered food to take out. I've eaten here a few times but have always gotten their chicken biryani. I'm not a huge biryani fan but a coworker recommended it to me here and so I tried it and I LOVED it! The raita here is also the best I've ever had. This week I wanted to branch out and order something different so I got the chicken tikka masala with white rice and garlic naan. I didn't check the bag before I left and when I opened it up at my hotel they had given me brown rice. That was a bit annoying. The tikka masala was good but wouldn't say that it was the best I've ever had. The garlic naan was disappointing. Of course I'm going to eat it and enjoy it because it's toasted bread with butter and garlic, but overall the texture of the bread was meh. \n\nMost of their meat entrees range from $25 - $35 and their vegetarian entrees are around $19 - but guess what. They don't include rice, so you have to pay extra. WTF! I hate when places do that. At least lower the cost of the entree then if you're going to have to pay extra for rice but at Amber India, you're already overpaying for the entree and then you have to pay $5.95 for the ride to eat with it. And it's not like the portions are any bigger than what would get at any other Indian restaurant. So, for a standard meal of chicken tikka masala and rice, you're paying around $31 and that's not including tax or tip yet. I don't know about you but that's a lot of money for food that I'm not over the moon about. While I won't disagree that they likely do use fresh and high quality ingredients, it doesn't stand out enough to me where I'm OK with paying these prices. I've only eaten here during work travel so I get to expense my meals, but out of pocket I'm not sure that I would come back here ...if I did, it would only be for the biryani and raita!", "author": "Emily T."}

They have well presented dishes here, a good decor, and many dishes use organic meats sourced from California farms. The Byriani here is done the best possible way, Dum-style, where it is sealed into a container with a pastry on top, keeping the moisture, flavor, and heat inside until it is ready to serve. They have an excellent Baingan (eggplant) dish that uses baby eggplants and stuffs them. Mango Creme Brulee here was a great dessert option, too. In addition to the excellent food, service was very good and attentive, and they have a nice selection of wine available.", "author": "Matthew S."}

I was alone but wanted a dining experience after a very long day at work. The hostess said the only table for single person is at the bar... I wasn't thrilled but I said OK and went and sat at one of the sofas by the bar. After a few minutes of sitting, the bar tender walks over and throws the menu at my table without even saying hello or making eye contact and walks away... I wanted to try this place for a long time and I told myself to let it go and stay for the food despite the bad service. I sat there for a while and no one was coming to even bring a glass of water and I decided no matter how good the food is if I'm spending a $100 for dinner this is not the experience I want to have. I walked out and shared my frustration with the hostess, which then tries to make me go back to the bar and offers to talk to the bar tender to come assist me... NOT worth it! \nluckily Blue Stem next door is my go to and I always have a great experience not just with food but also service... I'm enjoying a nice cocktail and steak sitting at a nice table as I'm writing the review. It's not the original option that I was hoping to have tonight but at least they are consistently pleasant.\n\nI posted pictures as I finished my dinner next door over an hour after they refused to give me a table, they have plenty of them open and bar is empty, yet the bearded bar tender couldn't bother to say hello!", "author": "Shell S."}

That being said, this is a solid, although not \"value priced\" ($100 for papadam, the jackfruit appetizer, tandoori chicken, naan, aloo gobi, 2 drinks - one w/o liquor - and tip), dinner option. Maybe not so bad considering we brought home leftovers for one of us to have for lunch. 4.5 stars overall.", "author": "Robin N."}

I live in Hawaii but whenever I'm anywhere close to SF, I make it a point to stop here. I've never had the buffet because the dishes I like aren't included on the buffet. Maybe next time I come back, I'll try the buffet because it looked amazing too.\n\nLast night we brought the kids for the first time and they also enjoyed the food. My daughter guzzled two mango lassi all by herself. My son enjoyed the butter chicken a LOT, and my sister said it was the best butter chicken she's had in the city. We ordered a bunch of dishes and they were all good!\n\nPALAK CHAAT: crispy spinach appetizer. Super good.\nBUTTER CHICKEN: signature dish. We got two @$23 each order! Get this!\nLAMB CHOP: bone in, tender chops. Very good!\nCHILI SPICED SEA BASS: WOW. Super pricey ($30) but really good! Get this if you like sea bass! \nBIRYANI: comes in a neat puff pastry type of dish, which keeps the rice moist.\nALOO GOBI: good but I'll skip it next time\n\nMan we ate so much food I could barely walk up the steps to get out!

My boyfriend is on a very strict diet where he cannot have certain things that are common in Indian food, so I called the host and made sure that they had dishes that he could have. The host named a few so we went for dinner. \n When we got there, the server said that he couldn't eat any of the dishes that the host suggested because they all had the ingredients he needed to avoid, so he ended up having to order daal (lentil soup) for $17 which actually ended up having tomatoes that he needed to avoid. \n\nMy brother and I ordered chicken tikka and a lamb curry. The lamb was what the server highly recommended and after one bite, neither my brother or I could eat it. It tasted like rubber because it was overcooked and it must have been old too because they brought it out way too quickly after we ordered. When we told the server, he rudely replied \"it's cooked fine\" and gave a mean chuckle. \n\nWhen we got the bill, we noticed that he had already added gratuity to it even though we were just a small party of three. \n\nThe samosas were good, but all in all it was definitely the worst Indian restaurant I've been to.", "author": "Nicki K."}

It was a pleasing meal but I would not label this restaurant as the best Indian spot in San Francisco. The portions were pretty average for a higher end restaurant such as Amber India. The chicken was flavorful, not too spicy, and very tender. The rice was pretty standard along with the naan and roti. The Cucumber Raita stood out the most to be, it was my favorite thing on the table. \n\nService:\nI was in between giving this place a 3 or a 4, mainly because of the service. If there's one thing that I value when eating out, it's exceptional customer service. Amber India provided that for me. Our server was very polite and attentive to our needs. The bussers were also super attentive. \n\nAtmosphere:\nAmber India has such a beautiful atmosphere, but again this is more of an upscale restaurant so it should. Not meaning to be entirely superficial, but one of the reasons why I wanted to check this place out was for their interior d\u00e9cor and design. It would be a good spot for a date; though to my surprise, there were lots of families with kids (found that a tad bit random since we were having dinner during prime time on a Saturday night). Nothing wrong with kids, just found it interesting to see so many families in a fairly upscale Downtown SF restaurant on a weekend night.

I went on a first date here and we ordered Samosas, Butter Chicken, Garlic Chive Naan, and Mango Lassi. The total came out to about $65; certainly not inexpensive but also not as bad as some other spots in the area.\n\nWe walked in at 6pm with no reservations and were seated in the lower dining room area. The wine list was provided on an iPad but we were both recovering from a weekend of drinking and wine was the last thing on our mind. My date convinced me that one entree would be enough for the two of us and it was, only because he didn't eat very much of it.\n\nThe food was delicious and I enjoyed all of it.

We were seated at a booth quickly. The buffet had a decent selection with a complimentary drink. The food looked good and they also had a live dosa station. We ate the food, but all of us were pretty full after eating one plate, and no, we didn't pile all our food in it. \n\nWe paid the bill. I was surprised to see that we were charged for 7 full buffets. Come on, $26.95 for a 6 year old??? Sadly, I didn't notice it till I got back home. To top it off, they charged the gratuity on a buffet. I would have left some, but didn't like the idea of being forced to pay it for a buffet. Frankly, I would have been okay with it, if we hadn't had indigestion afterwards. Every single person in our party today didn't have dinner, as we are still full. And no, we did not stuff ourselves. I ate much less than I would if I had gone to a normal restaurant. \n\nI have been to the this place before, but this time the quality of food sucked. Needless to say, I am never ever going back.

I went with my lunch group during CM week and was so surprised by how cute and big it was on the inside. From the outside, you certainly can't tell how much it has going on on the inside. Now, I can only speak on the lunch buffet, since that's what we had. The butter chicken was the best I've ever had. I don't know if this is possible, but it had a slight vinegar-y taste to it that took it over the top. Everything else I had was great as well. The rice was cooked perfectly as were the vegetables. Only critique that I have is that the naan was not very good at all.

Choices of food is slightly limited for a buffet, but there was a fair amount of food choices, including salad, rice, some meats and vegetables, and dessert/fruit. The butter chicken and goat were both delicious, and there was also some fish, but butter chicken definitely outshines the other dishes. There was also naan provided at the table.\n\nSeating is a bit crowded, especially for people who come for the lunch buffet, but the decor was nice (albeit a bit dark in certain areas) and clean. My main gripe is where the buffet is set up - it's kind of awkwardly placed, without much room for people to line up, and it wraps around these pillars just inside the entrance. In general, it was kind of confusing and I only knew where to go by following other people in my group. \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good and the waiters were very attentive, making sure to come around and take away used plates and refill water/drinks. If you're a big group, make sure to make a reservation! They are conveniently located just steps away from Powell Bart, as well as Yerba Buena Gardens.

So when you factor in the food cost, tax, tip and health benefits of the employees, the price can get exorbitant quickly.\n\nI'd give the buffet 4 stars.

Service from the wait staff seemed a bit inconsistent - some of the staff were a bit rushed and impatient with us, but the rest were attentive and courteous (at one point, we ordered a pot of chai that we didn't finish and it went cold; they actually gave us another full pot of chai free of charge!), so I'll call it \"mostly positive\".\n\nWe ordered 5 things:\n- Crispy potato turnovers: a bit dry, not particularly well-seasoned, the sauces were a must to wash it down. Not impressed.\n- A chaat with mini samosas and sev and other things (whose name I forgot): we all thought it was excellent, full of flavor, the tang from the tamarind and yogurt, the heat, the refreshing cilantro, it was a well-executed chaat.\n- Gosht karma pulao: though I'm not knowledgeable enough about Indian cuisine to say if it was a pulao or a biryani, suffice to say it was delicious - the lamb was tender, the rice was well-seasoned, the accompanying raita did not miss a beat. The portion was huge, too!\n- Saag paneer: I didn't understand why there were halved cherry tomatoes in the dish, but man! It was probably the creamiest saag I've had (maybe that's what's special about this so-called \"Watsonville\" spinach?). According to my girlfriend, it has some hing/asafoetida in it as well, which I think added a nice earthy flavor at the base (we don't use hing at home, which I will look into changing). It was met with high approval all around the table and was the only thing we completely finished at the table that night.\n- Dal tadka: seems to be what you'd expect from dal tadka... again, the hing did add a nice undertone of a flavor, but it was pretty standard otherwise.\n\nActually, we ordered more than 5 things: the rice had to be ordered separately. Paying $4.25 for a bowl of rice, if you ask me, is a bit of a rip off, especially when a dal tadka already costs $18. I guess you pay for the ambiance and the location in the Financial District...\n\nOverall, we thought the food was quite good with almost everything meeting or slightly exceeding our expectations, the service was very good, and the vibe was great - lively but classy. My only complaints would be the somewhat inconsistent service from different waiters/waitresses and overall somewhat high price for the food, but given the location, it is mostly understandable - but, seriously, include the rice in your dishes!", "author": "Lei F."}

We had the hot and spicy lamb loin which is actually not spicy but it was cooked to perfection, nice and red on the inside. It's also served with plenty of vegetables - fried spinach which was breaded with something and green beans. We also had the sea bass with mango curry. It was the best curry I've ever had. The sea bass was slightly overcooked but when it's served like that, it's difficult to get it less dry and more tender. \n\nI would be willing to bet on any dish in this restaurant. The service was great, our server was honest with her recommendations and patient when I was indecisive. I would love to come back here but it's on the pricey side so it's more of a special occasion kind of place.\n\nThe ambiance was ok, great for a date night.

Yes, you can get other good tasting Indian food nearby for a cheaper price, but you are really paying for a nice atmosphere in here. I keep Amber India on my list for fancier work lunches or as a nice place to take out of towners. \n\nLUNCH BUFFET -- i've come here before for a team lunch. You can call ahead to reserve a table, or if you arrive right when they open (11:30am) you will most likely get a spot. I would advise arriving early anyways to at least get the chance to try out all the food before the lines get super long. All of their curries are delicious and their tandoori meats are very well roasted. The tandoori chicken and the meat in the chicken tikka masala are very moist. I also enjoy that they offer the sea bass during lunch time -- one of my favorite dishes here! If you want a cold drink, get a nice refreshing mango lassi. \n\nThe SERVICE is very friendly and efficient. Our waters were constantly refilled and the waiter continuously cleared the plates off our table. \n\nWe've also done CATERING before and had food delivered to our office for lunch.

You wouldn't expect Amber to be an Indian restaurant and I will say it's definitely not your typical hole-in-the-wall Indian spot. It's walking distance to a lot of decent bars, hotels and other restaurants. We only waited about 5 minutes to get seated for two, pretty typical for a Monday night.\n\nThe service could have been better, actually let me say, A LOT better. It took about 10 minutes to have our server arrive at our table and just seemed too rushed. I hate the feeling of being rushed, especially at a restaurant where you're trying to relax and dine in peace.\n\nPET PEEVE ALERT: After receiving our food, he came back to our table to fill our waters and, without hesitation, started asking the party NEXT to us how their food was without bothering to question anything about our food. I don't know server etiquette but I can only imagine that being a major fail.\n\nAs for the food, my friend ordered the Lahsooni Calamari appetizer with normal naan bread (best naan out there, the simpler the better.) I ordered the Saag Paneer which is always my main dish at ANY Indian restaurant. It was delicious and wouldn't have wanted it any other way. I asked for it spicy and didn't come out too spicy, but that's ok- I always ensure I do it with extra chilies or their amazing sauces.\n\nOverall, the food was delish along with the beautiful restaurant decor, which is the only reason why I am giving them 3 stars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-10-05", "description": "Be warned, if you have any dietary restrictions, especially life-threatening allergies, I would think twice about eating here.\n\nI was looking for dinner on a Wednesday night before my red-eye flight that night, and Indian is one of my favorite cuisines. Amber India is under a 10 min walk from the Westin St. Francis, where I was staying, so it seemed like a good option. I called ahead and asked if they offer vegan options, and I was told they had many and others could be made vegan. Their menu items looked pricey, so I was expecting to get what I would be paying for.\n\nWhat went well:\n- The hostess held my suitcase at the entrance of the restaurant during my meal, so I didn't have to carry it up or down stairs to my table.\n- My waiter offered an off-menu, vegan yellow dal as an option, which I happily chose as many entree.\n \nWhat didn't go so well:\n- The booth I was sitting in was too low for the table, and I felt like my arms were uncomfortably high to eat any of my food.\n- My appetizer order was taken by a man I later found out was the manager, and a short while later, my waiter came by to ask if I was ready to order. Seemed a little disorganized, and I had to ask him to check on my samosa order to make sure it had been placed.\n- When I was looking at the entree menu, I had many questions about what contained dairy and what didn't. I specified that I have a dairy intolerance to make sure they were taking me seriously. There was a lot of checking with other employees, but no one seemed clear on the ingredients. This lack of knowledge was even more disturbing, considering I later looked closely at some of the symbols next to menu items and realized the vegan items were clearly marked. \n- Based on the phone call I had made, I thought that there were many options and sauces could be modified, but it seemed like neither was the case. There were a couple menu items I could choose, but especially none of the vegan entree items seemed appetizing until I was offered the off-menu entree. I was disappointed that the employee who took my call had misleading answers.\n- Rice doesn't come with your entree, and the entrees aren't exactly cheap. I ended up ordering saffron rice for $4.25, expecting rice that should have been served yellow, and it looked suspiciously like plain white basmati rice when it came.\n- I ordered a wheat roti (marked vegan), and they brought me what was unmistakably naan (not marked vegan). I checked with my waiter, and he confirmed that the naan is fine. After the third piece, I realized there was a clear butter smell and taste that I hadn't paid attention to. I checked again with the waiter, who finally went into the kitchen and came back to tell me it had been brushed with butter. (To add to this, I read on another Yelp review that the naan also contains eggs, which I don't eat.) I made it clear that I was upset that my questions and requests weren't taken seriously, and both the waiter and manager apologized to me and seemed to take my advice on how to improve very seriously.\n\nTo try to fix the awkward situation with the dairy mix-up, I was brought a complimentary dessert of two scoops of mango sorbet, which I really appreciated. However, I had such a stomachache later from the dairy that this whole dinner really left a bad impression on me. What I would have expected after specifying my dairy intolerance and then still being served dairy via the naan (which I hadn't even ordered in the first place) would be - at the very least - getting the bread for free. I was worried about the cost coming out of the waiter's paycheck, but if I hadn't been planning on expensing this dinner, I would have argued for it. \n\nMy meal total came out to $40.84, including the ginger beer ($4.00), samosas  ($8.95), yellow daal ($14.95), saffron rice ($4.25), and classic naan ($3.95). For a restaurant that's trying to come off as classier, I would have expected much better service--instead Amber India is just a wolf in sheep's clothing.\n\n1.5 stars", "author": "Biota M."}

I came here on a Saturday evening for a work event. They catered to a party of 7 of us quite efficiently although they made one or two mistakes. The white wine we ordered was supposed to be a Pinot Grigio and they came by with a Savignon blanc which they quickly corrected. We were also missing an order of rice and ended up sharing.\nAs this was quite a last minute event for me and I had to attend another dinner in two hours, I opted out of any appetizers and went straight to an entree. To me, the gold standard of an Indian restaurant is how well they make their tikka masala or makhani or vindaloo. So I ordered the butter chicken with much anticipation and my boss ordered the lamb curry. I quickly dug into my butter chicken which was a tandoori chicken shredded in makhani sauce. Five stars!\nTowards the end I offered my boss some of my entree and in return I got to try some lamb curry. I have to say, I'm usually not very enthusiastic about lamb anything unless it's in gyro form but this dish was so amazing I'm still dreaming about it!

Single small bowel of rice ( maybe a cup) which we shared.  Overall I thought food was good , service mediocre , but place is expensive and there are some smaller cheaper Indian restaurants nearby. Lastly there was also a small additional charge which the server told me helps to pay for staff health care.", "author": "Louis A."}

Ambience: average to poor if you take the price into account - cramped space\n\n5. Food quality: quality of ingredients were right up to the mark while there were some shortcomings on the menu selection - I mean who keeps deserts which are all too sweet :) and a mix veg item consisting of broccoli and sprouts ( cmon broccoli ... )\n\n6. Food taste: I was pretty impressed with butter chicken and chicken biriyani, both were stand outs while in vegetarian dishes only thing I could see which was proper was paneer kadai all other were just fill ins. \n\nOverall a 4 star rating with room for improvement in veg selections and BTW price for buffet for 2 pax was around $45. \n\nCheers :)", "author": "Abhi P."}

Took drink orders right away and didn't rush us to order but also didn't ignore us when we were ready to order our appetizers and entree. One small piece of our naan was burnt.

Most Indian restaurants that I've been to are family owed and you can tell. \n\nWe recommend the palak chaat.  It was a unique twist on tradition chaat.  Flash fried spinach with the Bells and whistles of traditions chaat. The garlic naan doesn't have an over powering taste of garlic as well so it doesn't take away from the entree. \n\nAll in all,  it's a classy restaurant that serves Indian ...

Well duh, that's a no brainer and the best advice I can give is; if you ever have to add salt to your Indian dish than chances are it has not been prepared very well. \n\nThe ambiance is trendy and chic. If you just want to go in for drinks they have a great happy hour and the bar is located to the right when you first walk in. This area is separate from the larger part of the restaurant. \n\nThe main reason I love Amber is for their brunch. It is a favorite SF brunch of mine. The food doesn't reflect the average \"New-American\" styles that most brunches offer but instead is an \"all you can eat\" India buffet that is exquisite and mouth watering. Let's just say that one plate will not do justice. The best part is the bottomless mango mimosas, they are to die for. You can get all this for just under $30 per person... Oh and bottomless naan too.

The last time I sidled up to the glowing bar was during the world series, the place was so empty I thought I spotted a tumbleweed rolling through the vestibule. My two happy hour buddies and I had the whole place to ourselves. \n\nWe turned the flat screen to the Giants game and ordered a few snacks. The bartender recommended the Bhel Puri - a mixture of papadis, puffed rice, sev, onions, potatoes, raw mango and chutneys swirled into a round cake-like shape resembling uncooked top ramen. It was crunchy, sweet and savory, and got mixed reviews from the three of us. I liked it but probably wouldn't order it every time. Next, we tried the Chicken wings - also sweet and savory, but the glaze had a bit of spicy kick.

The manager or reception desk man was outright rude, our baby had fallen asleep in the stroller, so we requested for a table with little space to park it, just so we don't have to wake up our baby. He suggested he following options : 1) pull her out of the stroller and you can keep the baby with you?! We said we do not want to wake her up. 2) he repeats the first option and says I can give you a booth... Still doesn't solve it for us! \n\nHe was outright rude and unrealistic, there were a couple of tables empty near the entrance, but he stated the policy of the restaurant as 'no strollers are acceptable in the restaurant'. In a city like San Francisco a restaurant with ample space needs to be more accommodative to a sleeping baby(and yes she wasn't a crying loud screaming baby, which I can understand would disturb your guests). Having worked in hospitality for 10 years, this was a completely unacceptably restaurant rule.\nWe didn't want to waste time arguing and graciously bowed out of the situation.

I could probably sit around and eat their pesto naan till my head fell off. But I always have to leave room for their Frontier Lamb ribs, one of my favorite lamb dishes around. Though I do recall getting a couple more ribs than I did on my last trip. (I wish I had been keeping track) Though the dishes are meant to share they are small enough to devour on your own. I'm also a fan of the sea bass, tikka masala, and the butter chicken. Desserts here are hit or miss for me but that is probably more of a palette thing more than anything. A little to sweet in many cases for me. I'd rather finish with a nice cup of tea or another glass of wine from their decent selection. \n\nIf you're on the more traditional side of Indian food dining then you'd best steer clear but if you're just looking for a great meal or a place to introduce someone to the world of Indian cuisine, Amber is a great way to break them in.", "author": "Joco F."}

My husband and I made reservations (Open Table) in June for dinner on 8/5/16 (Friday). Our reservations were for 8 pm and we arrived 30 minutes early. On a weekend night, don't expect to be seated before your reservation time. We were told to wait at the bar until 8PM. You can take the chance and walk in w/o a reservation and sit in the bar area and order food. However, with the appetizers, bread, soup, and entrees, there would not be enough room at the mini tables. \n\nMy husband and I were taken to a corner booth which was perfect, best seat in the restaurant for two. We were given an expansive wine menu to look at on the IPad. Since I was driving, I opted out but my husband ordered the Liberty Ale (on tap). We ordered the bread basket for starters which comes with three types of bread: Spinach Roti, Laccha Paratha, and Naan. This is more of an appetizer for 3-4 people, so we had to take some to go. The Laccha Paratha was my favorite because it had some jerk spice that made it flavorful. We tried the crispy potato turnovers because they were new to the menu and this dish was amazing. The garbanzo stew made this dish. The turnovers for this appetizer are tiny, but the dish is worth trying. My husband and I also split the tomato soup. It was delicious and my husband said it was easily in the top 5 best tomato soups he has ever had. The tandoori flavor really shined through in the soup and was unlike any tomato soup I have tasted. \n\nFor the main course I had the Lobster Cream Coconut curry and it came with an empty lobster shell on top for presentation. It was delicious and tasted similar to a vegetarian Korma but still different. It was nice to see fresh chunks of lobster tail in my dish. My husband ordered the Lamb Korma and he said his was very good, but my dish reigned supreme. We ordered the saffron rice to go with the curries because it is not included like it is in some Indian restaurants. \nThis restaurant has good size portions. Keep that in mind when ordering. My husband and I run everyday and we had a huge appetite during dinner which is why we decided to order dessert. We split the mango cr\u00e8me brulee and it was divine; the perfect ending to a wonderful date.\n\nAlso, for the reviews that mentioned noise: Yes, it is noisy in the restaurant and tables are close together. However, all the ethnic restaurants that I have been to in SF have close proximity seating (Mamacita, Ler Ros, Sheba, Foreign Cinema, Slanted Door, etc).\n\nAtmosphere 5*\nPrice 5*\nLocation 5*\nFood/Taste 5*\nService 5*", "author": "Kristina Nichole D."}

Reluctantly we had to grab more food than required and eventually we had to waste some of the food. I think server/receptionist should have told us about closing time so that was could have visited another restaurant.\n\nSecondly food quality was not that good.

It was my nephew's birthday and since it was mother's day too,the whole family decided on doing brunch/lunch at Amber.This plan was made around a week back and my sister even called and made a reservation with them,with specific requests for a baby chair and a regular table and not the high chair tables cause we had elderly people with us.\nHowever on arrival at the restaurant,we were greeted and guided to a table that was a high chair table,the exact opposite of what we had requested for. When we asked one of the persons at the counter for assistance to switch to a regular table,he was awfully rude and simply told us that everyone else had requested for the same and in simple words,we basically had to make do. We managed to speak to one of the in-house managers who promised to get us a change of table within a few minutes.But when nothing happened for 10 minutes,we carried on with getting our food.Since it was mother's day we had no option but to eat there,as we wouldn't be able to get a reservation anywhere else at the last minute.\nJust for future reference,if one is in the hospitality department,it is sort of a part of your job duty to be kind and pleasant with the customer.Secondly,if everyone else had made a request for the same and you couldn't fulfill our request,then we should have been informed in the first place,so we could have arranged for an alternative.I haven't experience such terrible customer service,in a while,and I am really shocked at the way we were made to feel.\nThe food was fabulous, as always.However,I know as a matter of fact,that I'm never going to visit the place again.As a customer,I would rather make my peace with average food than terrible service,and I really want to thank Amber specifically for ruining my mother's day experience!", "author": "Shraddha N."}

My mom in her compassionate way would talk to the chef and tell him \"son (or daughter), the food you cook represents and speaks about our country and culture. It speaks to the many hours we labor in the kitchen to make food. And you are telling a bad story\". \n\nDesi dinner I always served hot! Not cold as if it was sitting their for 20 mins. The chicken tikka, the lamb kebab and prawns --- cold cold (ok room temperature, but seriously)\n\nDeception 1-- menu ---- don't write on the menu \"Cajun chicken\", making it out to be some exotic southern fusion recipie and get me all excited; only to serve me a chicken tikka masala.

But serving it cold!!! Sad!\n\nAnd last --- Taking a famous dish- the Lamb Shank, renowned for its taste and effort that goes into it. A proud dish of mothers and one that chefs get bragging rights for. You totally insulted every mother and chef. Am not sure what potions in the back you are working with but Harry Potter most certainly will be interested. \nThis could be my fault for ordering and not reading the ingredients but hey, I just went of the experience from 20 yrs of my life eating lamb shanks and other Desi food to compare it to. \n\nOn the bright side ---- they have a very very good Brunch. \n\nPS--- could have added $5 more to the total spend and went to Kaskade tonight at pier 70! \n\nPS--- bad food is not an excuse for bad tip.

Essentially, you go here if you are in the Financial District and want some semi-late night premium priced Indian food.  It's probably better for a date than a standard meal.   We found the Kashmiri Roganjosh to be rather enticing, but frankly, you can find a similar product for half the price on the East Coast.  The tandoori sampler was fine, but it wasn't especially memorable either.  Perhaps we should have followed the rather insistent pleas to order wine from our lovely waitress, but I'm not sure it would have changed the overall experience.  Really, there is nothing wrong with Amber, but it's not a place I would go out of my way to revisit.  At the price point they are offering, I was expecting a more inspired meal than the leftovers I ate from North India restaurant a few days later.", "author": "Yelper N."}

In that vein, this place is \"Indian (new)\" and good at it. The options are a mix of traditional north Indian that you can find in most Indian restaurants and newer things that are different, but delicious. For instance, they had a tandoori lobster.\n\nWe started with the palak chaat, which was unlike any other chaat I'd had. It was lightly-fried (but still dark green) spinach with some lightly sweet toppings and nuts. Really, really good and I'd get it again in a heartbeat.\n\nWe split a tandoori sampler (with chicken, ground lamb and shrimp) and an aloo gobi (spicy potatoes and cauliflower) with a side of the roti. Everything was good, but I'd probably put the ground lamb and aloo gobi at the top. Especially, when they were in the roti. They also had brown rice, a rarity in my experiences with Indian restaurants.\n\nWe finished things off with pista kulfi (lightly-sweet, hard pistachio cake). I thought it was just OK. It was both a bit too hard and a not quite sweet enough and I'm usually a fan of not-too-sweet when it comes to deserts.\n\nOverall, this is is a nice place to grab a fancy-ish dinner and you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Colin D."}

The martini and \"another drink\" were prepared with vigor and care :-). The bartender knew what she was doing and kept us company as it was close to closing. The Tandoori sampler was great; Baluchi chicken, Achari Jheenga, Lamb Seekh Kebab. The sauce came in nice dipping bowls, but we really didn't need it.

The ambiance is classy modern, the service is exceptional, and the food is eclectically wonderful. \n\nFor the times I've been here, I've never been disappointed. It's a great place to take people who are not familiar with Indian food to have their first experience. I prefer hole-in-the-wall Indian, but let's be honest, authentic Indian flavors are sometimes too bold for newbies. \n\nThis time we ordered the Cauliflower Bezule, Butter Chicken, Saffron Rice, and Plain Naan. Just FYI we were two people and this was a lot of food so before you decide to get a curry entree for each person, I would caution against it because curries are meant to be shared. \n\nBezule was perfect. It was hot cauliflower dipped in cold coconut sauce. Butter Chicken was tasty--just enough cream and tomato sauce. Pretty good portions of chicken pieces to cream. Rice and Naan was good. I ordered a chai and I wish it could have been hotter. Also, service was great but timing was not. They brought out the main entrees almost five minutes after the appetizers so we were rushed in finishing the appetizers.

The selection is always slightly different each time, which is nice, but there are some consistent dishes that they always have. \n\nPro tip: come hungry. I don't see how you can willingly pay $20 for lunch buffet and only eat one plate. Especially since the food is above average, but it should be at those prices. \n\nThe line can be long, although even that is hit and miss. Standing in line snaking between dinners in the main part of the restaurant is a bit awkward, so I like to come early, get a plate, and then wait for the wait to die down before going back for plate number 2 (or 3). \n\nTheir desserts are light and they've usually got fresh fruit, which is a nice end to such a heavy meal. \n\nThe service is ok, but then again, I've only had the buffet.

We were able to be seated pretty quickly on a Saturday night around 7 thanks to space in the bar and lounge area. It took some time for our order to be taken, but food did seem to come out in a timely manner. \n\nThe atmosphere is beautiful with excellent mood lightning giving it a chic and vibrant feeling. The lounge also had a comfy couch area with pillows and fun little seating tufts. \n\nQuite a few of the menu items are gluten free as is common with Indian food. My friend had enjoyed their butter chicken before so we ordered that to split with saffron rice. We each had a glass of wine as well. The chicken was delicious and very flavorful with a creamy broth. I was also pleased with the wine. \n\nThe only issue for me was I just thought it was ridiculously overpriced... Again have I just been confined to the Midwest too long?? Who knows.. Maybe we pay less for the same food cause we have only a sea of cornfields to look at while we eat. The butter chicken came in a small little pot for 22.00. Then, what I really have issue with is being charged 5.00 for a cup of rice. So that combined with there not being a wine on the list under 10 bucks led to a rather pricey shared meal. \n\nNot saying it wasn't fantastic.. It was..

They also forgot to put the requested Baileys in my coffee. \n\nThe food, however, was delicious. It was the best butter chicken I've had in a long time, and the assorted bread basket was a great way to try the various breads. My dad especially liked the seabass curry.\nAll the dishes were flavorful and well balanced, though nothing was actually spicy. We had dessert as well and it was good though the kheer could have used a bit more flavor/been concentrated or reduced to increase its flavor and creaminess.

I've been going to Sports Club/LA, which is pretty much right around the corner from Amber. After a workout, I wanted to get something to eat. I decided not to grab something at the gym because I like to try to make a dent in my bookmarks as much as possible. So Amber popped up and I decided to finally give it a go.\n\nI went when they had their brunch buffet. I didn't necessarily want a buffet, but the price of the buffet was more reasonable than the menu options. Plus, bottomless mimosas! The service here was a little slow, but the food was SO good. I ate so much and it was worth it.\n\nI'm sure you're probably wondering why I am giving this place 5 stars. Well, there's a big reason. After asking for the check, I went through my gym bag. When trying to find one of my cards, I panicked because I didn't have it. I had one with me that I knew wasn't going to cover the bill. I gave it to the waiter and crossed my fingers. It came back declined. I have never, ever been in this situation before. That card was the only form of payment I had on me. So I asked for the manager.\n\nHe came and I explained to him what happened. Having an S3, I have Google Wallet. I've used it plenty of times before and have all of my cards linked to it. I've never used it as a debit so wasn't sure if I could get cash back at Walgreen's or something. The manager let me leave to give it a go. I left my gym bag there as collateral.\n\nI went to Walgreen's, CVS and 7-Eleven. I bought small items, but no option for cash back. (Let that be a lesson to you Google Wallet users). I went back to Amber with my head down low. I told the manager about what happened and that my only other option was that I could go back to Oakland, go home and grab that card. He let me go, but told me I could take my bag.\n\nI don't think he thought I was coming back.\n\nOn my way back to Oakland, I started thinking about the situation. I really didn't have to go back. I could have just been done with it and had a free meal. But, I went home, grabbed my card and left. I grabbed cash and went back on BART back out to the city.\n\nI got there right at 5pm when they reopened for dinner. No one was in the front, but not long, the manager came out. It was almost like he did a double take. He really wasn't expecting me to come back. I gave him the cash, with a little extra money. He wouldn't accept it. He would only accept what I had owed.\n\nAfter this experience, and the great food I had, I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. Thank you again.", "author": "Vanessa S."}

Don't come here expecting cheap eats - this isn't your Indian fast food joint.  Expect entrees to be around $20 and with drinks/appetizers/naan/rice, expect that cost to jump up to around $40 per person.\n\nThe inside decor is very tasteful and romantic.  The lighting is very dim and there is a lot of funky artwork and candles.  I suppose this is a good place to meet for drinks and a date.  It definitely is not a hole in the wall Indian joint that you can find a few blocks over in the Tenderloin.\n\nWait time for two for dinner was about 20 minutes so instead we opted to sit in the bar area where there was also a full dinner menu.  Let me tell you now, the soft seating in the bar is not ergonomic and not very conducive for eating full fledged meals.  The tables are extremely low.  I would advise either getting a bar table or just waiting for a full dining table instead.\n\nThe service was a bit lacking.  I mean, I don't expect hover waiters since we were sitting in the bar area after all, but I'm pretty sure we saw our waiter a total of three times.  \n\nOK now onto the food.  The menu makes a big point to detail where the food comes from - what farm, is it organic, etc.  We got garlic naan, lamb korma, and vegetable kofta.  The entrees were about $20 each.\n\n-The garlic naan, while pretty fluffy and garlicky, was actually a lot smaller than I expected.  This was probably the first time in my Indian dining food experiences where I actually thought, \"I could use more naan.\"\n\n-The lamb korma was pretty good albeit a bit spicier than I expected.  The lamb pieces were tender.  I actually don't like eating a lot of meat in my Indian dishes though so take my comments with a grain of salt.\n\n-The vegetable kofta was tasty.  They only give you like five dumplings though (as is typical with most kofta entrees).  It goes well with the naan.\n\n-The basmati rice was whatever but I was a bit disappointed that an extremely small serving of rice cost an extra $4 when a) rice is basically free and b) with the high prices of the entree I would expect the rice price to be already baked in.  It's impossible to eat Indian food without a grain on the side.\n\n-Mango lassi was good.  Definitely one of the better ones I've had in a restaurant.\n\nAnyway, this place is good but to be honest, if I'm paying that much for dinner, I expect high quality service but it was extremely lacking. I also don't really care that much about the decor of a restaurant, which is what I felt like half of my money was going to.  I've definitely gotten very tasty kofta at not so nice places.  And while it's true that at other Indian restaurants I may not be getting my organic cage-free meat from Mary's Local Farm... well, I think I can live without that.", "author": "Danielle C."}

First they informed us that only a fixed menu would be available on the 14th. The actual meal proved to be a disaster. The kitchen had major issues, and each course took ages to come out. We were there for close to 3 hours. Theres only so much romantic conversation to be made! Our server had no clue where our courses were, and we saw at least 3 other tables just get up and leave in disgust. They claimed the kitchen was backed up, but this is unacceptable when you are charging close to $200 for a meal for 2. The front desk was unapologetic when we complained while leaving. Management needs to step up and realize this is a huge let down. They also tried to indulge in weird flourishes for the V-Day menu- stick to the dal makni guys- that's what you do best!", "author": "Chetan G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-05", "description": "Though several years old, this is one of the newest Ambers, and is totally different in vibe, setting, ambience, service. Urban, sleek, polished, multi-level with bar on top, polished tables. The food arrives piping hot in glistening brass vessels. We love getting their tandoori fish, either the salmon or sea bass, is phenomenal, super fresh and not overly cooked, left tender and flaky, with the juices and flavors seared into the flesh.The frontier kebab or tandoori rack of lamb (Frontier) and butter chicken dishes became our mantra :-) I kid you not: the tastes were a revelation, it was as if I had never eaten tandoori lamb or chicken tikka masala before. The flavors of their butter chicken are blended perfection, a waft of fenugreek as its set on the table, the sauce rich, creamy, tomatoey and though velvety, it's not greasy or oily--and a little goes a very long way! It has shredded chicken from the tandoori--I use a bit of garlic nan to barely dip into this curry and the flavor is explosive. Unlike those early days, I can no longer eat spicy food, and we asked them to make it \"mild,\" and they absolutely delivered! This is hard for an Indian restaurant to do, because they usually do not know how to tone down the spiciness by simply taking out the chili . . . but they did it beautifully, leaving all the flavor and complexity, the layering of spices, did not sacrifice any of this; I loved it! The remarkable thing about Amber is their consistency, over the years and from visit to visit: more than a decade ago, I wrote a Zagat review, likening a mouthful of their butter chicken to an orgasm. That curry should be patented. And to get that signature level of tenderness, the rack of lamb is likely marinated a minimum of overnight in improbable spices and god knows what else; this must be tasted to believe. I cannot do justice to it, it literally melts in your mouth and is not the slightest bit gamey. We usually get rice which is the perfect accompaniment and their assorted bread basket, which is a terrific introduction to the varieties of roti, paratha, nan . . . I need raita to go with whatever I'm having. We also always get their bengan bhartha (eggplant) and bhindi (okra), the latter they're able to adjust the spice level, but the bhartha they seem to have pre-made the spices and chili's, so if you're spice-averse, this may not be the dish for you. This is not any okra you've ever tasted: they do a helluva balance between crispy and soft. The eggplant is smoky in all the ways we bbq to be, and the fact they do this with a vegetable is a miraculous alchemical magic trick. They have lots of \"modern\" interpretations of classic Indian food, especially in the appetizers and also stuff not found in your typical Indian place, e.g. calamari, duck, lobster.   Btw, their ras malai for dessert is sublime! I cannot rave enough about it: it's spiked with rose water and cardamom, which is standard, but the ratio of both is .5 to .5 = balance! The consistency begs for your spoon to touch it, firm yet creamy, and it's so damn good that I say hell with my lactose intolerance, and I'm ordering one . . . my husband and I refuse to share one, we get one each :-) Their lunch buffet is insanely awesome: the choices are stupendous and the quality of each dish ridiculous, the presentation in each majestic tureen boggles the mind. It's a steep price per person, but the quality is worth it. The service is professional and clearly, these are not students bussing tables part-time, they've been to some training. Though it's the same ownership, we find the food here, despite the similarities, to be different enough that's it's a unique experience, and worthy of paying for parking and of the price tag.", "author": "Ranjan P."}

But how many can one eat with rice!!\n2) The butter chicken just had butter and no chicken, even if you dived at the bottom of the dish, all you can find is more butter gravy.\n3) chicken in the Butter Chicken and Tandoori Chicken tastes old and rubbery.\n4) The salad bowl was empty and was not filled the 1.5 hours or so we were there.\n5) Perhaps, the place would do better to hire friendly wait staff, who can smile at customers and not frown at them to get out of their way. Especially when the route to kitchen is between the desert bar and guest table.A smile goes a long way.\nFor the price, the items in Buffet can and should be increased.", "author": "Monu M."}

I think there's a large selection here of food but the base curry sauce seems to be the same for a lot of the items - in turn, the food begins tasting the same - the shahi paneer, korma, etc.\n\nThey had a little dosa section -- which i thought was nice but the dosa was not nearly as crispy as it should be.  The sambar was a little thin as well. They didn't refill or stir the items too often either, indian curry should be stirred because the oil and sauce will begin to separate.\n\nFor ~20 for a buffet, I expected deeper flavors and a larger selection.  There are a lot of indian buffets that are half the price and have the same number of items.\n\nThey also had unlimited mango mimosas, which some of the people got. This was I think another $10-15. My friends complained that they were being very stingy with the mimosas - actually avoiding the table so that they didn't have to refill the glasses.  It's unlimited, but they limit how often they refill you.  \n\nAll in all, the food is pretty decent but the price is a little high.  I think it'd be better if the cost went down.", "author": "Sheena D."}

Walking in, the first thing I noticed was the dimly lit, yet plush ambiance. \nThe server was courteous and ushered us to your table right away. However, as luck would have it, we were seated right next to the kitchen, which is probably the worst place to sit in this restaurant. The noise of servers talking in loud voices and plates and silverware clattering formed an annoying backdrop to our entire meal, and is the reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars, not 5.  \nNow for the food. We ordered several dishes, and every one of them turned out to be finger licking good.

That was the best thing in the buffet! The chicken was nice and tender and the sauce was sooo good with the rice and nan! Yum!\n\nThe rest of the dishes were okay. I don't eat a lot of Indian food, but I normally like my food spicy and everything in the buffet was rather mild. The buffet does have a variety of food, but for $17.95 I was expecting a little more. Maybe I've been to too many Vegas buffets?\n\nMy one complaint was the amount of time I had to wait in line for the buffet. The line went all the way back to the bathrooms.

It'll make your life easier, even if you decide that you're going later that day. \n\nAmbience:\nAmbient lighting with nice linens. I'd put this as fine dining. People here are usually fidi types or at least nice, but not formal. Classy. Although we did come here a few years ago with our Halloween costumes and they didn't turn us away.\n\nFood: \nI've gotten their lunch buffet, which all of it is flavorful and wonderfully spiced. Their prices are fair for what you're getting, which are high quality dishes.\n\nAs far as dinner, I've ordered the scallops prepared in a number of ways depending on the season. They're all excellent. Seared and soft, but not chewy, they're cooked to perfection. I always get two orders of papad because I love them. (Even though they have three pieces per order, I manage to devour then all.) \n\nThe sampler tandoori platter is also delicious, but the meat was drier than my personal tastes. The spices totally make up for the dryness to a point. I'm more of a rare steak kinda gal, so take that recommendation however you like. \n\nWe always get the cauliflower bezule because it's vegan. Don't let that fool you - it's delicious. We even ate the dried candied orange and was inspired to make our own from the dehydrator, but I digress.\n\nThe okra with dried mango powder is also wonderful for vegans and omnivores alike. It's not slimy, but retains the okra flavor. The dried mango powder is impressive and well spiced. \n\nThe jalapeno dish is always wonderful and spicy if you're into that. The eggplant isn't mushy and it's a whole Indian eggplant, roasted. It's delicious. I've also tried various lamb dishes here and if you like lamb definitely give it a go.\n\nThe drinks are unique and their mocktails -Amber blush- would also be recommended.\n\nService:\nThe times I've been here I'd say the service is on the slower side, but on par with other fine dining with a more relaxed atmosphere. Though oftentimes we've found ourselves struggling to find someone to grab the check. That's my only qualm about this place.\n\nAll in all great food, quiet ambience, great date place if you're willing to drop some dough.", "author": "Amy N."}

Perfection in a flute!\n\nWe chose the following & had countless meals to enjoy afterwards....but leftovers are the only way to go when you're dealing w/ such delicious choices\n\nMushroom & Goat Cheese \"fritter\" - this was like an Indian version of fried mozzarella sticks & came w/ a creamy tikki tomato sauce for dipping - nice spice mixture w/ this was flavorful spicy, not heat-spicy\n\nMung Bean salad - prob our least favorite - kind of dry salad of mung beans & herbs\n\nKofta - dried apricots wrapped in a fried dumpling & smothered in a Mali-Kofta-like sauce.  This dish was actually on the sweet side & I imagine it was from the apricots & cheese....maybe if they'd countered the sweet w/ some spicy heat, it would have been a nice contrast.  Still we liked the dish a lot\n\nMushrooms & Peas - the kofta was nicely balanced out w/ this more savory dish - these huge, English pea pods were wonderfully tender & covered in a thick tomato sauce that was just a bit on the spicy side (yay!).  The mushrooms were thickly sliced but tender & not at all slimy which can be the tendency when stewing up shrooms\n\nRice for the pea dish - very, very small serving!  You'll prob want to get multiple orders to soak up all the sauce that comes w/ your entree\n\nAssorted Breads - we liked the Naan w/ Peas best but each had their own texture & made great tools for scooping up all the Kofta sauce\n\nWAY too full for dessert & a ginormous bag of take home & we waddled out of there happy", "author": "Adrienne G."}

It was nicely flavored, and came with a good amount of tender meat. The sea bass was cooked really well, and came on a bed of vegetables. The dish was enjoyable, but with the cream sauce it didn't seem like Indian food at all! We also tried the quinoa vegetable dumplings. This was definitely a unique find on an Indian menu, and I loved the hearty texture of the dumplings. Both the roti and the naan were good, but nothing really set it apart from what I've had at other flavors.

Oh no, this is the kind of place that caters directly to the clientele who stays at the Four Seasons across Yerba Buena Lane. The Indian decor appears more like a throwback to the days of British colonialism with everything quite whitewashed and tastefully appointed. So given the circumstances, imagine my and Jamie W.'s surprise when we discovered the food to be quite good and flavorful. \n\nBut it ain't cheap. We started with the $11.95 Duck Tinka Kebab, three skewers of succulent duck breast, pan-fried and marinated in yogurt and red chilies (see photo). It came with a creamy, saffron-infused dipping sauce with dill and capers, but honestly, the duck was so good it didn't need the sauce. Next came the $22.95 Awadhi Lamb Biryani, which actually looked like a big chicken pot pie when it came out and turned into quite a production. Crack the biscuit-like shell on top, and there is a hefty amount of basmati rice with a generous amount of lamb chunks flavored with saffron and rose water (see photo). Delicious and hearty enough to share easily as an entree. \n\nHowever, we knew we couldn't pass up the house specialty, the $19.95 Butter Chicken, which was quite a pot of rich, tomato-based sauce filled with shards of tender Tandoori chicken breast (see photo). The texture was velvety smooth but with a nice kick of spices and quite an ideal complement to the lamb biryani. As if that wasn't enough, we also ordered a simple basket of the comparatively inexpensive $3.25 Tandoori Naan, no-frills but perfectly baked. We were both sated and tapped out because it turned into quite a bit of do-re-mi when the bill came. This is definitely the socioeconomic opposite of a place like Chutney in the Tenderloin.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...elegant Indian food, plentiful portions but plenty of ka-ching for the Four Seasons crowd \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...colonial India, bit sterile...seems to attract amorous couples with its mood lighting \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...polite and unobtrusive, a bit stiff \nTOTAL - 4 stars...a bit of pip-pip in their Indian cuisine", "author": "Ed U."}

They charged me $24.99. Bill showed weekend special buffet. I do not believe it is worth to spend $24.99 for an ordinary food. Being an Indian and knowing what an Indian foods taste like I can definitely tell $24.99 for lunch buffet is too expensive. I am sure they will have people coming there for weekend buffet and get surprised when they see the bill.

Think about me I paid $24.99 x 2 and $7 for parking!. I would rather next time drive to Sunnyvale for lunch buffet. This is just my experience and me!.", "author": "Devan K."}

Case in point, our group was getting hungry after HH and a friend suggested Amber. Indian food? I'm down!! \n\nAwesome place in the financial district / SoMa that's near all the lounges and bars. We really just wanted to snack on some naan  & curry so we decided to hang in the lounge/bar where they have a full menu. The bar overlooks the street and hosts a few tables with couches along the wall that you can hang out as a group.  It's dimly lit and makes for a great ambiance. The server was helpful in suggesting a few favorites and was accommodating to our needs. \n\nNalli Vindaloo - Tender braised lamb shank with garlic. Doesn't have a gamey taste at all and the sauce is the perfect blend of spice and curry. Hit the spot and was a pretty large portion! \n\nButter Chicken - By far, one of the best butter chicken dishes I've had! The sauce had a smooth and creamy texture with shredded tandoori chicken. It is a MUST order when coming here. Don't skip this one! \n\nDefinitely keeping this place in my back pocket when we're craving Indian food.", "author": "Andrew S."}

In my return to the Bay Area, I always heard of Amber India, which is tucked away next to a Coffee Bean on Market, and decided I had to try it!\n\nI was not disappointed.  First of all, the restaurant is larger than it seems on the inside.  It's got a romantic feel and an awesome looking bar while you wait for your food.  \n\nNow onto the best part...the FOOD.   We ordered the BUTTER CHICKEN, SEA BASS CURRY, GARLIC NAAN, ROTI, BASMATI RICE, and the CAULIFLOWER appetizer.\n\nThe curries were amazing.  The BUTTER CHICKEN had a great flavor, and is definitely a dish you should order if you want to play it on the safer side.  It's mildly spicy (just a kick) and is similar to Chicken Tikka Masala, if not identical. \n\nThe SEA BASS CURRY....if you like fish, GET IT.  The Sea bass melts in your mouth and the curry is a great complement.  This curry is 100% mild with no kick at all, so it's a great, smooth curry for your meal.\n\nThe NAAN and ROTI were amazing as well, and you can't go wrong with BASMATI RICE.\n\nThe CAULIFLOWER appetizer is great...around 8 pieces with a coconut milk sauce and I believe it's fried.\n\n\nFor DRINKS...try the MANGO MOJITO (non-alcoholic).  it's a great mix of a Mango Lassi and a Mojito.", "author": "Patrick L."}

The ambiance was fancy, which was ideal for how we were dressed.  The server came by soon after we were seated to take our order.  My friend suggested the Duck Tinka Kebabs and Nalli (Lamb) Vindaloo with Saffron Rice.  I had to have an order of Garlic-Chive Naan.  I questioned her if that was enough because we were starving...when it all came out, it was definitely more than enough.  There were three skewers of kebabs--the duck was moist and tasty.   The lamb came in this large, elongated bowl and it was a whole leg bone with tender meat hanging from it.  I felt like the Vindaloo could have been more complex in flavor but it had a good amount of heat.  An appetizer and entree is plenty for two.  We attempted to finished everything but couldn't, it was too filling.\n\nThey were very accommodating last minute and service was great--very efficient and fast at taking orders to getting food on the table and bring the bill.

The only difference here and other places is there was white meat chicken tandoori (I prefer dark meat). All the sauces were way more sweeter than I'm used to in Indian food. \n\nI'm giving one star because I can't leave 0!stars. I visited this place because it was close and had a ready buffet. My partner and I were looking for a quick lunch on a work day. We were seated and waited for 20 minutes. No waiter. we realized maybe we just go to buffet. My partner got a phone call from work and stepped outside. He told me to go ahead and start eating without him. \n    He never came back as he had to go back into work due to an emergency. I just went up and got a plate. The waiter finally came by and brought water and some naan after I had a plate. Never saw the waiter after that. I ate a then waited for awhile trying to get the waiters attention for the bill. When I did, the manager or owner came up with the bill. When I opened it, I saw they had billed me for two. The owner/ manager was extremely rude.  If I ever had a waiter even talk to me about the restaurant I would have explained that my friend had left and hadn't eaten as evidenced but the unused table placement next to me. I apologized and said my friend had left and the owner became very snotty and said he was told two people were sat and needed to pay. I simply told him no and was going to ask the people sitting next my table to verify that is ate by myself during the meal. \n  He was very irritated and said if he knew there was only one person, he would have sat me at a smaller table. We came in at 2:15, the end of lunch. I couldn't help but notice many empty tables around the restaurant as he this to me. \n   I was professional waiter for about 7 years. This is the first time I never left a tip. There are much better places to eat for cheaper but with friendlier staff.

The lamb shank was tender, and its curry sauce was very good. We were warned that the dish is spicy (the water bearer said that \"we will need a lot of water\") - it wasn't that hot.

That is to say, you'll feel comfortable whether you're wearing jeans or a dress.\n\nThe menu offers fun creations that aren't found in typical, middle-of-the-road Indian restaurants, but I found the prices a tad high even with all that creativity. My friend and I split the English Peas Portobello Goat Cheese Tikki to start. It was quite tasty: croquette-like things stuffed with portobello mushrooms, crimini, English peas and goat cheese, served with a creamy tomato-flavored dipping sauce. We then split an order of the Butter Chicken, which is supposedly their signature item. Now, I know BC is about as generic as you can get for Indian food, but we both had a craving for it and decided why not? We could always come back and try something else. The dish was okay but a bit too sweet for my liking. The chicken was tender though, and they gave us a ton of rice.\n\nI'd had a really crazy day at work, so I decided to treat myself to a cocktail too. I ordered the Cucumber Citrus Martini, except I don't like cucumber in cocktails, so I asked that the bartender substitute red berry vodka instead. It was good (but not great) and came in a very large glass which, for the price of $11, felt like a good deal.\n\nWhile I wasn't blown away by the food, I was really impressed by the service.

At Amber you are going to pay three times the price for what amounts to a neat atmosphere with its multilevel dining and colorful lighting and a better trained wait staff. I was seated and inquired about ordering a tikka masala despite it not being on the menu and my server informed me that yes, the chef would be able to do this. Considering the prices and considering that lamb was offered in other dishes, I figured I might be able to order my favorite which is lamb tikka masala. My server informed me however, that for some reason unbeknownst to me that lamb tikka would take longer to prepare and that the chef could only do a chicken tikka masala. \"Okay, that will work\", I thought. Again, the dish was good and the service was above par but the food was zero better than you would get if you got it at any other Indian restaurant. I left thinking the only negative about the place was their prices but it wasn't long before I started feeling nauseous. That sick feeling kept getting worse and worse as the hours ticked by until I had to jump off the municipal bus at a random stop so that I could throw up. From there, I eventually got back to my hotel where I was thinking maybe a sprite and a water might help. Almost as soon as I had drank about half of each, the water and the sprite, I threw up again. I was able to hold the first heave in my mouth until almost out the door of the hotel but...not quite. The second heave along with the first came shooting out of my mouth and all over the inside of the glass doors of the hotel lobby. The 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th heaves left my stomach empty onto the sidewalk in front of my Mason Street hotel. Although I didn't actually throw up again after that, I felt very near to it and I felt quite sick for the next half day or so.

For example: tandoori chicken is a fairly common dish, yet most Indian restaurants fail when it comes to executing the recipe to perfection where the chicken is not marinated enough, and/or it has been painted orange. Not at Amber India - here you can enjoy the real flavors.\n\nEven the dessert selection at the lunch buffet was par excellence - not like the usual sweetened-up-stuff just to call it a dessert.

We ordered the Amber Butter Chicken, and the Tandoori Sample Platter, and few naan's, among other dishes. The food is expensive, but the flavor and spices of the dishes are very authentic. It's a very popular place in downtown, and so it is very crowded. I HIGHLY suggest booking a reservation a few days in advance, so you don't miss out on getting a table. We had a reservation, and we seated within 5 mins after arriving there. The staff seemed a bit stressed and it felt that there weren't enough staff members to better help the flow. The space was also very crammed, and so waiters and waitresses were running into customers chairs and I could tell a few people were annoyed by it. Even with the space constrictions, the staff seemed to be on top of it, and made sure the food was brought out quick and was presented nicely.

I mentioned a few restaurants nearby the theaters, including Amber, and it turned out to be one of two spots I could get a reservation at on the Monday before (man, SF is getting tougher to get reservations in!).  I had been to Amber before, and shared with her my experience, which was a four star experience - tasty food, a refined dining atmosphere, and good service.  She was excited. \n\nWe arrived to our reservation a bit late, and the server was great.  She was very attentive and responsive. \nWe ordered, and their saag paneer was good, as always.  But with most other dishes, we ended up being not just underwhelmed but \nThe cauliflower appetizer arrived at room temperature - no heat. \nThe molten chocolate cake - was super dry and had some pieces of plastic in it that I showed to the server after I paid for the check.  We had to get to the movie on time, so I didn't want to spend much time sharing with the server how our experience was not usual for Amber, so I decided to share it the manager the next day to share how things went. \n\nThe following morning I called Amber and asked for the manager.  The phone was handed to Victor, and I shared my experience with him.  He listened carefully, and said he would speak with the chef and get back to me. \nA while later, after some food shopping, I notice I missed a few missed calls from Amber's number.  Speaking with him again, Victor shared with me that he would like to treat me and a guest to dinner - it would be on the house.  I thanked him, and took the offer, hoping that the next dinner would be better.  I made reservations for this past Friday, and I invited my friend Amir who had never been.  \n\n++++++\n\nPart II\nAmir and I went for dinner, and it was his first time at Amber.  And it was a good one!  \nOur server Sagar was super attentive.  The cauliflower appetizer that they gave us (off the menu!) was awesome.  The four spice sea bass was so tender and tasty, it almost melted.  The Lamb Grogenjosh - my first grogenjosh ever - totally turned me on to this type of dish.  The okra was packed with flavor and spice that balanced out the fattiness of the oils it came in. \nWe also had some roti and flaky bread that were spot on.  \nAt the end of the meal, the manager Victor reminded me that the meal would be on the house.  Matthew - who I think is the assistant manager - came by the table and said he hoped everything was up to par for us.  \n\nIndeed, Matthew, the meal was up to par.

The restaurant filled up pretty fast, and large parties had an especially longer wait time. \n\nDid everyone know about the lunch buffet? We didn't. I envisioned a classy romantic meal, but what I got was a long line for food piles under heat lamps. Don't get me wrong, I like all-you-can-eat options as much as the next person (especially when they're $18.95, cheaper than some entrees on the regular menu), but the food space is set up to be a fire hazard and I felt overwhelmed with the trays of vegetable-meat-sauce combos that could only be differentiated by the shape of the lumps. Nevermind the setup, the food itself was mediocre and none of the flavors stood out to me in particular. The lamb and the butter chicken were probably the best of the batch, and none of the options were offensive, at the very least. The buffet is a good way to try a bit of everything because it includes most of the regular menu items.\n\nThe wait staff was also very insistent on us ordering drinks right away and kept trying to take away the menu, but if you are questioning whether you should get the non-alcoholic cocktails (Mango Mojito or the raspberry option), you should treat yourself today because both were flavorful carbonated concoctions, and probably the best part of our meal.\n\nAmber isn't awful, and the environment makes up for the lacking flavors, but I probably wouldn't be back to pay high prices for average food.", "author": "Jessica F."}

The menu offerings were close cousins if not siblings to the usual tandoori fare, although I found the curry and spices cranked up too many notches for my western taste buds.

They're always different; last I was here they had fried mushrooms as one of the dishes, which was delicious. They also had a tasty bhel puri with whole crackers, which was a first for me.\n\nAll-in-all, great food, nice atmosphere, but talk someone else into paying for you.", "author": "Andrew M."}

I love this time of year and absolutely look forward to this day with my friends every year.  This year my friend asked if we can spend her birthday doing some last minute shopping at the Westfield center.  So we did just that.  We shopped until we finished our entire Christmas list then headed over to Burke Williams Spa for a quick mani/pedi. \n\nAfter all the shopping we did we were starving and my friend suggested we head over to Amber for lunch.  \n\nAmber has a great buffet lunch for a very affordable price which includes all the Naan you can eat. \n\nI loved their butter chicken which was amazingly good.  Everything in that buffet was delicious! I'm bringing my husband in here next time because he loves Indian food. \n\nThe ambiance is great and it's in a wonderful location in downtown San Francisco.

We made reservations for Saturday night for a group of six and were seated immediately. I'm so glad we had reservations because the restaurant was really busy! \nTo start off with, we tried the tandoori sampler and everything was delicious!!! We also tried the Kalimirch chicken, kadhai paneer, kumbh kofta, butter chicken, pesto naan, chilli cheese naan. Every single thing was delicious! I particularly liked the chicken cooked in black pepper and I also liked their version of the malai kofta. \nThe reason for not giving this place five stars is because of their dessert. After such a great dinner, you want the dessert to stand out, which the strawberry panna cotta didn't. The fruits on top didn't seem fresh and they were wayyyy too sour for my taste. \nThe service was good and the ambience was nice. I'll definitely be back! :)", "author": "Ashita K."}

We made a reservation in advance for 8:00pm and when we arrived we waited a bit for our table and were seated immediately. When we sat we were given menus but not the DAT menu. We had to wait about 10 or so minutes later for a server because it was clear they were a little under staffed. When we finally got a hold of someone to ask for the menu they came and brought out the wrong menu. More time passed and we had to wait to ask for the right menu again. After a while we were finally presented with the correct menu. I dislike the fact that they don't offer the DAT menu when you first sit down. It's like if you came to the restaurant without knowing about DAT, you would not get the menu and I think they do it on purpose to deter people from getting such a great deal. Every other restaurant that participates will offer the DAT menu as an option right away or only have the DAT menu for dinner for the week that it goes on. So Minus a star for the difficulty in getting a menu. We were also asked to move to a different table and it wasn't a big deal since we hadn't ordered anything yet but I mean they should know who is reserved and how to set up their dinning room tables, that's a managerial hick up.\n\nThe review is not tarnished however because the food made up for it. When you order you get an appetizer, two entrees, a choice of rice and naan and dessert. You get so much more here than you would get at a Italian or American style restaurant also participating in DAT. We enjoyed the menu because it's more expansive and the options they provide were intriguing. \n\nFor apps we ordered a lamb and duck kabob. The duck was forgettable but the lamb was flavored well and we enjoyed the sauces that it came with. For main entrees I ordered the goat curry and my girlfriend ordered the butter chicken. Our choice of rice was brown and lentils. Our choice of naan was garlic naan and chili thyme naan. Hands down the greatest butter chicken I have tasted in my life. It was life changing and may have ruined all Indian food for me in the future. The goat curry was nice but the butter chicken was the star and I couldn't concentrate on anything else. I was surprised the brown rice was cooked so well and went with the lentils and curries magnificently, it was better than most basmati rice I've had at Indian places. The lentils also had good flavor that paired well with our rice and naans. The garlic naan is your standard garlic naan, but the chili thyme naan was on point with a little spice and flavor was excellent with butter chicken. Definitely worth it for Dine about town.\n\nFor dessert we got syrup dough balls which were very sweet and tangy. We also got mango creme brulee which is essentially mango lassi in a creme brulee and it totally worked. Very refreshing and it tasted magnificent. Overall our restaurant experience was awesome and our service was really friendly despite the DAT menu debacle at the beginning of our meal and being moved to a different table but honestly, the table we were moved too was much better. Highlights if you come for DAT: Butter chicken, lentils, mango creme brulee and chili thyme naan. It was all fantastic and get what your taste buds love, but for me these were the shinning stars.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

I love authentic Indian food (the not-so-authentic stuff too, but there's a time and place for that...) so I was excited to try this place. I guess it depends on what day you come what they're serving, but chances are there's something for everyone. I personally LOVE paneer, so I was super happy with my paneer curry. The boys all seemed happy with their food too and an added bonus for le boyfriend: mango lassi. He inhales that stuff!\n\nNow, Amber also has some side salads and whatnot which I thought were quite disappointing. But I've noticed how I find most salads in the US lacking of that fresh, wholesome feel and taste which I do get back home. I mean seriously, why is there so much sugar, salt or whatever weird stuff in salad dressings?? But I guess that's just the US. Which is sad for me because I love diving into a huge bowl of greens, veggies, honey and cheese.\n\nSo, overall I thought the food was three star, but I'll definitely try to come back another time and hopefully try a few different dishes here.

Not sure what their technique is but it worked to perfection; the spinach was crisp but melted in the mouth. Not overly spicy, right amount yogurt, cranberries, although not traditional, added pleasant sweetness.\n\nI ordered the lamb with cashews/walnuts. I expected something like a lamb chop with nuts; instead it was a stew with nuts ground into sauce. That's OK. Nothing wrong with a surprise. But overall the dish didn't quite \"hit\". The lamb, although soaked in sauce, was in itself a bit dry. The dish badly needed rice; I get a mite ticked when a high price dish requires me to spend more for the rice it needs. (I did get the rice.) Lamb was well trimmed, a plus.\n\nFor dessert, I hesitated over the more traditional milk dumplings, did a quick Yelp search for reviews, but it seemed people here either did not try dessert or did not say what they ordered. I wanted something light in texture (if not calories!) so I got mango cr\u00e8me brulee. Clearly not traditional but done well.

Whereas my dad stuck with chicken dishes, my mom, sister, and I split the vegetarian ones.\n\nFor starters we got the fava bean veggie tikis and the flash-fried spinach with raita dressing. The crispy spinach was my favorite! I could have eaten that all night. For the main dish we ordered the Paneer Lababdar, Saag Paneer, and the Vegetable Koftas. I think my favorite of these was the Saag Paneer, but I'm always biased towards Saag Paneer. We ordered two garlic naans, one chili/thyme naan, and one pesto naan- the pesto was really good! We all ordered white saffron rice, which came with dal on the side. My dad was a little annoyed that, for four of us, they only brought 3 little bowls of dal- I'm taking 1/2 star off for that. For dessert, my sister and I got the mango brulee, my mom got the pistachio gelato, and my dad got the chocolate gelato.

Amber India is definitely one of my favorite Indian restaurants - probably the best in the Bay Area if not it's sister restaurant, Amber India Mountain View.\n\nThe Cauliflower Bezule appetizer is something you MUST get when coming here. Despite it's completely dairy looking exterior, it is completely vegan...yay! I'm not a huge fan of creamy things but this dish is ridiculously good. I used to eat meat and honestly this dish reminded me of eating chicken wings -.- The cauliflower is really crispy and the sauce is plentiful and flavorful. I would seriously come here just for this dish.\n\nOnto the entrees - their menu is appropriately marked vegetarian and vegan which is always a plus, and the servers are knowledgeable about the ingredients. I always get the Bhindi Do Pyaza (okra dish) which is a favorite Indian dish for me and I have to say that this is one of the best versions I've had.\n\nThis is definitely some of the priciest Indian food you'll find - $18.95 for the okra which is really expensive for a vegetarian dish.

The food, however, is not authentic, and heavily leans towards the mild side of the spectrum.  It is also quite expensive for Indian food.  For three of us, with three entrees, one appetizer, two naan, rice, and only cocktail among the three of us (in total), the bill was $130.\n\nThe samosas were delicious, as were the chutneys that accompanied them.  They were tiny, however, and $9 for three bite-sized morsels.  The garlic naan was also delicious (much better than the pesto naan, which I didn't care for).  My entree -- the vegetable korma (can't recall the name used on the menu) -- was well-prepared but not balanced in flavor nor delicious.  It also only had five ingredients, whereas navrattan korma typically has nine vegetables.  I wouldn't order it again.  My other friends ordered a tandoori meat sampler and a sea bass, which, as a vegetarian, I didn't try.\n\nThe location is great; it's right downtown; and it's in the heart of the city, not far from Union Square, close to the Metreon.  Service, as mentioned, was spectacular.  There was a mix-up with our reservation, and it was professionally handled and gracefully managed.  I'd go back; I just wouldn't expect it to be true Indian.

The dungeness crab was flavored with pepper and ginger perfectly and the flavors were not too strong. The sea bass was super smooth and buttery, and obviously very fresh. Their portions are actually quite large for such a restaurant too, which is nice because I couldn't get enough of the fish. The konju pappas had tiger prawns drenched in curry. Surprisingly, the dish was less spicy than I expected. You must eat this with the roti or naan because it will taste the best.

I wandered into Amber India and sat at the bar, which turned out to be an excellent decision.\n\nThe lovely Natalia made me a very decent Manhattan, and then at my request, her and another bar patron conferred and recommended a couple small plates for dinner: the chicken naan and the duck kebab. \n\nI cannot tell you how happy I was to bite into that duck; it was absurdly tender, and freaking delectable. I suppose that my tastebuds might simply have been grateful for actual food, seeing as how the dross that American Airlines serves aboard their flights cannot be categorized as such...but seriously, I couldn't believe how juicy and flavorful it was. It wasn't a huge portion for $11, but I was so unexpectedly delighted with it all the same. And when paired with the Chicken Naan, it was more than a meal. \n\nThe latter dish was almost like an Indian (non-crunchy) tostada: spicy chunks of juicy fowl, onions and peppers and spices and saucy deliciousness atop a fluffy piece of naan. Extremely satisfying, and the heat had me pounding my Manhattan (and then my drunken friend's Melon Julep which was quite refreshing). The naan was not quite as mind-blowing as the duck, but it was hearty and flavorful, and the two of them together made a perfect meal.\n\nAmber also serves a stellar AYCE lunch buffet (as with all unlimited spreads, I predictably ate myself sick). However, at $17, it seems a bit steep. Especially since I frequent an equally tasty (but with admittedly fewer options) buffet for $10. And that one is in NYC, The Land of Everything Being Way Too Expensive Except for Dumplings and Sunglasses.

If you like lentils, definitely get these ones, with a side of naan.\n\nDownsides: Cocktails weren't so exciting, I could have gone without mine. And this place definitely is on the pricier side for dinner, but I think it's worth it for an interesting, nice meal out. \n\nAs far as how authentic the dishes are, I know many of the dishes come out more fusion/modern than what you'd normally expect from reading the menu, but I thought that was a good thing. I will have to come back with my husband sometime, who lived in India for a year and is quite picky/snobby about Indian food and update my review based on what he says :)", "author": "Nico T."}

The dishes demonstrated a perfect  combination of being authentic and unique. Not anymore.\n\nAfter a long break, we returned to this establishment to our disappointment.  The server only checked on our table once in the beginning and again at the end of service. It seems they have transitioned to a \"team\" plan of service which means there is no continuity of care throughout the meal. We were mostly served by a very poorly trained busser who barked at us every time he approached our table, demanding that conversation cease and that all 4 diners lean back for him to reach plates even though he was only working from one corner of the table.  No discretion whatsoever, and we were not able to enjoy a good social conversation because of his poor training.  Water glasses were not refilled reliably. Amber India USED to serve out the the family-style dishes, but has stopped that service as well and simply dumped the plates and left.  \n\nThe food has diminished in quality as well - it is now generic Indian food.  For example, the okra curry at Amber used to be slivered and crispy, quite a unique presentation - it's now cut across and rather bland and mushy, like you would find at any buffet. The dal used to have more lentils, flavor and texture; today it is mostly butter and cream, using the cheap tricks of fat and salt to satiate the diner without offering any sophistication of flavor and texture. \n\nThe food is decent here - you can now expect consistent buffet food better than most places, and it's slightly better than your average cheap Indian take-out cuisine.  This would be fine food if you don't want any surprises; if you want to bring your auntie/uncle from out of town and not confuse them with any unique twists whatsoever - this is your place!", "author": "Lester N."}

The Amber management has made a strategic decision not to care about service and quality of food anymore because, if the locals are not going to eat it, one of the thousands of out of town Moscone conference visitors will definitely buy into the crappy food and service thinking it's the best Indian food they had in SF! \n\nBunch of us went to their bar lounge area last Friday and had to literally fight for food and attention from the waiter. The waiter was not only new new to the restaurant but new to Indian food, so he had no idea about the menu!! We had to wait 20 minutes to get cutlery after we asked him twice for water, napkins, etc. We sent food back twice since the head chef was out of town and the new chef had decided to add extra salt and sugar in the butter chicken for flavoring, the daal and chicken arrived 15 min earlier than the naan. The lamb naan had lamb all on one side of the bread, so we had to argue among us friends on who get the piece with the meat!!! If I have another $180 to waste, I will still find another place for next time. \n\nI'd like to believe that the service can't be worse and hopefully plates will arrive before the food does? As a kicker to the evening, the waiter decided to add extra tip on my credit card on his own since he had made our evening so memorable! This all was done without asking me, which I had to \"request\" him to correct on my way out. \n\nThis is great opportunity for other Indian restaurants in the city to cash in by hiring knowledgable staff and serve a decent meal. Its only a matter of time when people start realizing they are over paying for crappy Indian food and service.

I'm a native Indian and have been to tons of Indian restaurants & buffet so I'm a tad biased.  \n\nAt $22.95/pp this is definitely the most pricey Indian buffet that I have been to.  \n\nSo does the selection/ambiance/quality/service justify the price? Well, kinda...\n\nThe buffet selection wasn't huge but overall there was decent variety between vegetarian and meat dishes. They had a jalebi (Indian dessert) counter with a guy making it fresh and fresh nann (Indian bread) brought to your table so kudos for that. Grade: B+\n\nThe taste/quality was very good. Grade: A \n\nAmbiance is also very good. Not your average Indian restaurant interior here. A nice comfortable place to sit and have your food. Grade: A\n\nService is where they really faltered. A drink comes with the buffet and we choose the bottomless Mango mimosa. First, they make it sounds like you get A drink... not bottomless. A bit cloak and dagger for me. Second, they are very good at busing the tables but they don't refill your drink until you ask (this includes asking whether you'd like a refill). When we went it wasn't super busy and there were a ton of wait staff. Now other Yelpers have remarked on this stinginess also and our experience confirms the same. Plus towards the end of our lunch (around 3p when they close) they really started to rush us and that isn't cool. Grade: D\n\nVerdict: I'd pay ~$16 for this lunch buffet considering location, selection and quality. Keeping in mind that $16 is on the higher side of Indian lunch buffet prices. So why pay a 43% premium ($22.95) then? Well for the bottomless mimosas and service... which didn't work out. Until they fix this, I recommend skipping in favor of a place like Curry Village in Sunset.", "author": "S B."}

So we had reservations for 8p on a Fri a few weeks ago.  And since my friend lives out in East Bay, she tends to be notoriously late especially when she is looking for parking. The girls didn't show up till close to 9pm.  Thank God there was an inviting bar to calm me down, since patience is not a virtue of mine.  So I had a cocktail where the ambiance at the trendy bar scene was somewhat entertaining... people-watching that is.\n\nI have to say it was worth the wait.  We immediately noticed that the servers as well as many of the customers dining there appeared to be natives of India, which we thought must be a good sign, that the food is authentic Indian.  SO I have to admit, I am ignorant of the culture, so no intention of stereotyping, but typically I always think if I'm at a sushi restaurant, I would prefer the chef and those dining there to be Japanese, because it just tells me that it must be really good and not Americanized.\n\nEverything everyone ordered was absolutely delicious.  I had a bite of someone's \"butter chicken\" which is their signature dish... very rich, but it is amazing.  My friend and I shared the eggplant and salmon dishes, which was unbelievably good.  And of course, can't have Indian food without the yummy Naan!\nWe chose not to get dessert, but had their coffee.... wow, really great coffee!\nWe were so full, they all wanted to go dancing to some club or lounge afterwards... but all I was thinking of was my escape to leave so I can hang out with my boys CJ & Bentley :) and when my boyfriend and I will come back to this fabulous place.", "author": "Myra M."}

I like Yelp a lot, and it makes a great aggregate system, but I'm a picky vegetarian that doesn't like vegetables, and you're a meat eater and/or vegan and/or gluten intolerant veggie lover and your review isn't going to be about the food that I'm going to want to order. \n\nSo instead, I sit and I think about something that will at least make my review entertaining, so that if a stranger reads it they don't necessarily care about my recommendation, but at least they don't ask for those 3 minutes of their life back.

The food quality is top notch but when we left the restaurant my party of 4 all had the same comment that we didn't feel that we had Indian food that we had expected.  No complaints (except one minor) about the food, it just was a different experience than expected.  The single menu item that was sub par was the nan. Flavorless and cold. Other than that, good food that reminded us of India and since India is a large country with different styles might have been served there. Someplace.", "author": "Bill J."}

Upstairs bar with a light wall, several large dining rooms and many staff. We opted for the lamb vindaloo, sea bass curry and NIgella stuffed peppers. A chili bread and paratha were ordered to supplement. Food was good but I think the original's cooking is still more spot on and prices more fair.

Once for dinner for my dad's 50th birthday and another time for lunch on a day trip to SF with my family. Both occasions were satisfactory.\n\nDinner: Prices were slightly more steep (including drinks, we paid about $115 for the four of us) but the food was nothing short of amazing. We had palak paneer, a mixed vegetable dish, yogurt, and of course, the famous, fresh, soft, naan. The only complaint our family had was that we did not say \"spicy\". Usually this is not an issue but since this is an upscale Indian restaurant in SF, the food is a little mild to suit all the other ethnicities that eat at this location. But besides our food being a little less spicy than we would prefer, we thorougly enjoyed both dishes. I also ordered a mango mojito, which was fantastic! Minty, fresh, and perfectly sweetened. Finally, when we told them it was our dad's birthday, the waiter brought out three scoops of sorbet (mango, raspberry, and strawberry (?)) with a candle in one of the scoops. It was downright adorable and all complimentary. Our family was pleased at the service and how sweet our waiters were during our visit. \n\nLunch: We wanted to try the buffet since we've heard so many good things about it--pretty great as well! We had a paneer dish, channa, khaddi, raita, endless supply of naan and some pakoras to start with. There were also some traditional Indian desserts (I wish they had some of that sorbet or some ice-cream instead). Overall the food was great, but I was surprised there wasn't a greater variety for a buffet. Regardless, we were stuffed and happy with our food! This was cheaper than dinner too so if you're looking for a slightly better priced meal, come for brunch on a weekday rather than dinner. \n\nI would love to return soon!", "author": "Anu P."}

Even food trucks have more delicious food. At $25, having crappy chicken wings, rubbish baigan bharta and biryani and no fish doesnt make sense.\n2) FOOD WASTAGE - So the waiter gives us a basket of nans without asking us. We don't even touch them and humbly ask the manger to take them away as we haven't even touched them. He said its contaminated and they will throw them off. We request him to give it to us in a to-go box so that we can give it to a homeless guy. He refuses saying that California law doesn't allow him to do so. We offer to buy those nans as we don't like untouched food to be wasted, he refuses even that. \n3) MANAGER : The guy whom we dealt for the above issue was the manager.

Location is convenient to the FiDi and you have to love how this little square is coming together with nice restaurants and open space.\n\nOk that's it, now the negative: \n\nSomeone messed up in laying out the tables, there is too little room to navigate between each one as you try to make it through (btw I'm a skinny bitch, so if you're normal size or above good luck getting through). \n\nService was a complete and utter disaster, the worst I've seen in years. I understand it's opening night and I was prepared for serious bumps, but wow. We asked the drink guy, the water guy, the manager all for a waiter.

Typically on a restaurant's opening night the staff is fired up, strangely everyone seemed like they could care less.\n\nFood was eventually ordered, appetizer and entrees.

The cakes are more like potato wedges, but I liked the flavor.\n\n* TANDOORI STUFFED ALOO - Scooped out potatoes stuffed with spiced cottage cheese, mint and cashew nuts, which are marinated in spiced yogurt and char grilled.  Four come with an order.  Try some of the green sauce on this...yum!\n\n* BUTTER CHICKEN - Their most popular dish of shredded Tandoori chicken in a rich tomato sauce.

My friend thought she might not like this dish because of the fennel seeds but that spice was very understated.  We ended up really liking this (and I liked it a bit more than the butter chicken).\n\n* NAAN - Of course we had to order some.  We had the regular naan and also some with garlic chive.  Their naan is not very doughy if that's how you prefer it.\n\nAs for drinks, the MASALA CHAI was good.  My friend ordered some MANGO drink with muddled MINT and it was fantastic!

This restaurant has been voted to be the best Indian for the last 11 years. The food is great because it can be light and healthy, and at the same time we can spice up the food! Though, I think there are DIVEY Indian restaurants around town that can satisfy one better for both money and quality. Most people just enjoy Amber India for it's popularity and ambiance.\n\nBut, I have to give props to the owner Vijay Bist who went to culinary school in India, trained in Swizterland, Germany and France.

They have 3 locations -- Santana Row (San Jose), Mountain View and San Francisco.  This was my second time at the San Francisco location.  They were up front about what they could make to meet my diet requirements (and I wasn't surprised since I used to eat fairly regularly at the Santana Row location).  Food was good, ambience was good (if not great) and service was good.  Their Ras Malai dessert is among the best I've had in the US.\n\nUpdate 6/9/17\n\nI have since been there many, many times.  Quality and service have been consistently good.  On this visit, I discovered they have a dedicated Jain menu which lists all items that they offer without onions or garlic (and also no eggs).  For some reason, even though I took a photo of the menu, it does not show with my review.

Usually the flavors punch you in the face.  So much that the only meat that can stand up against the spice is lamb. \n\nAmber is different.  The chefs really show a delicate touch to delivering flavorful Indian foor.  \n\nThe mixed grill appetizer is classic and well executed.  The meats were well seasoned, but left you feeling surprisingly light.  The sea bass curry was fantastic.  Not only could you taste the sea bass against the spice profile of the curry, the flavors actually complimented the flavor of the fish.  Well done.\n\nAlso the fried spinach was unique in flavor as well as offering a nice crunch to add some texture to the meal.  \n\nThe scallops were amazing as were the other several dishes I had.  I think no matter what you order it is going to be good.\n\nI had dinner with a friend that happens to be the only Indian person I know that cannot eat spicy food.  I was a little worried about what dishes we would get and how flavorful it would be.  We told the waitress that we did not want any heat and she helped us choose a huge spread of food for the table that did not have heat.  Every last one was tasty and unique.  This is a real testament to the skill of the chefs and thoughfulness of the recipes.  \n\nFood came out hot and the service was attendtive (although a bit slow at times).\n\nAll together, this is thusfar the best Indian food I have had...Anywhere.", "author": "Scott C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-04", "description": "MmMmMm....BUTTER CHICKEN!!!!\n\nFor months, I've been hearing rave reviews about Amber's Butter Chicken and finally I got to see what the hype was all about. \n\nMy friend and I came here last Friday, 4.30. I made same day reservations for 1:15 PM and it took about 5 minutes to be seated. We opted for the lunch buffet ($16.95), so we can try a little of everything. \n\nSince I'm only familiar with typical Indian dishes like Tandoori's, Curries, Tikki Masala, Saag Paneer, Lentil Dal, and Biriyani, I can only recall a couple of dishes by name as opposed to it's traditional name. So, my apologies in advance for that.\n\nThere were about 25 items on the buffet:\n\nSALAD/APPS TABLE:\n*Apple and Goat Cheese Spinach Salad\n* Papri chaat (?): Crispy fried dough wafers topped with raita and tamarid chutney \n*Veggie Fritters\n*Potato Pancakes\n*Tamarid Chutney\n*Cranberry Raita \n*Cilantro Chutney\n\nENTREES:\n*Butter Chicken\n*Tandoori Chicken\n*Tandoori Salmon\n*Chili Chicken\n*Lamb Curry (Green)\n\nVEGATARIAN/SIDE-DISHES: There about 9-10, but I can only recall the following:\n*Lentil Dumplings in Yellow Curry Sauce\n*Cauliflower w/ Potatoes\n*Lentil Dal\n*Saag Paneer\n*Chickpea Curry\n*Basmati Rice\n*Naan\n\nDESSERT:\n*Chocolate Mouse\n*Rice Pudding\n*Tapioca Pudding\n*Fresh Fruits\n\nI tried the following:\n*Apple and Goat Cheese Spinach Salad: It was ok. The spinach was nice and crisp, and the apple and goat cheese was a nice contrast of sweet, tart, salty and savory.\n\n*Papri Chaat: The crispy wafers was like an Indian version of chips. It was light and crisp and the raita added a creaminess while the tamarind added a sweet tang.\n\n*Veggie Fritters w/ Broccoli: It was ok. It was room temp, so it wasn't as crisp as I expected to be. It was a little of the cakey side.\n\n*Tamarind Chutney: Tangy and sweet which when well with the tandoori chicken and papri chaat.\n\n*Cranberry Raita: Sweet, tangy, and creamy; although it was a little on the watery side. \n\n*Butter Chicken: OMFG! Believe the hype...the butter chicken is amazing! The shredded chicken pieces (white meat) was tender and flavorful from soaking in the creamy sauce. The butter sauce had a velvety tomato base with cumin, masala, and ginger notes w/ slight kick from the cayenne pepper. \n\n*Tandoori Chicken: It was ok. Although the meat was tender, it wasn't the traditional bright red color and wasn't well-seasoned, so you really had to use one of the chutneys for flavor. \n\n*Lamb Green Curry: It was good! The lamb was succulent, tender, and very moist. The green curry sauce was thick and rich and had a slight kick to it. \n\n*Lentil Dumplings in Yellow Curry: It was good! The lentils was more like flour dumplings b/c it was very glutinous as opposed to being grainy. The yellow curry was rich and velvety and was very mildly spiced. . \n\n*Basmati rice: It was ehhh. It was on the drier side and started to clump in the serving tray. \n\n*Naan: It was ehhh. I'm use to naan that's bubbly throughout with crisp edges. Amber's naan is thick, very doughy and not crisp; it's more like the naan you buy from the bread aisle in the grocery store.\n\nIn short, the only stand out dish was the Butter Chicken. If you're use to SPICY Indian dishes like I am, you'll be disappointed as most if not all of their dishes are mild. \n\nSERVICE:\nIt was good. All the servers were very polite and attentive, although they seemed very robotic in nature. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nContemporary, sheek, and very earthy. The lounge/bar area has a nice lighted alkie display and yellow ottomans. The dining room is a long open space with a leaf printed ivory carpets, clean ivory walls, dark wood with red and beige accented furnishings, and a back red wall which gives brightens up the room. \n\nCROWD: \nFIDI workers. I did notice a handful of Indian patrons which shows that their food must be somewhat authentic b/c they wouldn't be there in the first place. \n\nPARKING:\nGarage parking at the Metron parking lot. But, if you're coming here on the weekdays, just take Public Transportation as it's just 1/2 a block away from the Powell Street Station. \n\nAll in all, Amber's food is 3 STARS b/c of the outstanding Butter Chicken. It is a little on the pricer side ($5 for ice tea???) and you're really paying for the ambiance. But, I'll give them an extra STAR for not getting the runs afterwards....", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

And take this from a North Indian.\n\nMy family has been going to Amber for as long as we've lived in the Bay Area and it's probably the only Indian restaurant we've never had issues with in terms of quality of food.  We've gotten to know the staff at the Mountain View location due to our frequent patronage and we've never had a sour experience.  Great food, and never feel guilty.\n\nWe were in SF for Fourth of July and decided we'd try the SF location, having been to Mountain View (traditional Indian) and Santana Row (more Western friendly) locations.  The SF one is sort of a bridge between the two.  Great ambiance and layout.  We arrived at 6:30 pm, were seated by 6:45 pm, had our orders in at 6:50 pm, and were eating by 7:05 pm.  Super quick service, much faster than the other locations I've been to.\n\nOur menu:\n\n- Garlic Naan (staple, can't go wrong)\n\n- Mutter Kulcha (like an aloo mutter filling; superbly delicious)\n\n- Goat Seekh Kebab (a favorite, succulent and flavorful)\n\n- Dum da Murg (chicken is super tender, delicious)\n\n- Baluchi Murg Tikka (different version of standard chicken tikka masala, a bit more flavor and less spice.)\n\n- Palak Paneer (my parents are super healthy, ordered it without the cream as per my father's request but didn't miss the cream. very light and perfectly spiced. Also for an Indian restaurant, the actual amount of paneer pieces they put in the dish was much higher than regular, which is always a huge thumbs up)\n\n- Paneer Labadar (my brother and I wanted something with more masala so we ordered this. same story of generous portions of paneer, delicious)\n\n\nSuffered quite a wonderful food coma after my meal but totally worth it every time.  Yes, the food is a bit pricey but it's worth it because you know they do a phenomenal job.  Amber, you've had my seal of approval for 15 years and counting.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-13", "description": "Nice little surprise while staying at the attached San Fran Marriott Marquis for a conference.  I am lucky to come from an area of the Midwest that happens to have very good Indian dining options, so I was ready to put Amber up to the challenge.  \n\nFirst off, as alluded to by others, this is a swanky joint for Indian cuisine.  Lucky for me, I was there for the lunch buffet ($16.95).  I arrived before noon which helped as the dining room filled quickly.  There is a nice view of walkers-by near the Contemporary Jewish Museum and some other high-end shops.  \n\nI started my Amber experience by ordering a chai tea which was VERY good and steaming hot.  Next up was the first trip to the buffet.  Round one consisted of Butter Chicken (signature Amber recipe, shredded Tandoori chicken in rich tomato sauce), Catfish (curried?), Bean Sprout / Baby Corn Cold Salad with Cilantro, Goat Cheese & Almond Croquettes, and a Lamb Patty (not sure what all was in this).  The Butter Chicken was hands down the best I've had and was velvety smooth and chock full of flavor (I could have started an IV drip of that sauce!)  The Catfish was very good and mellow, although I am not sure how exactly it was prepared.  This is the first time I've had catfish at an Indian restaurant.  The biggest surprise and again a first for me, was the Bean Sprout & Baby Corn Cold Salad.  It was very refreshing on an oddly hot fall day.  The cilantro was bright and an excellent contrast to the earthy flavors of the bean sprouts and the sweet, delicate flavors of the baby corn.  Since I can't leave well enough alone, I did top mine off with some mint chutney (see IV drip addiction problem above).  The Goat Cheese Croquettes were ok, but felt like something you'd get on a cruise ship.  The Lamb Patty, hmmm...I am not the biggest lamb fan, so I'll start by qualifying that point.  It just didn't taste that good to me.  \"It's me not you...\"  Lastly, the na'an was hot, but was not charred as I would prefer.\n\nIn summary, this is excellent Indian cuisine, albeit a bit on the pricey side.  However, the food is packaged nicely with beautiful surroundings and attentive service.  I'll definitely be back to Amber my next time I'm in San Francisco.", "author": "Ryan P."}

Add a dose of upscale dining, a great downtown location, and great service and you're in for an amazing night. \n\nThe restaurant is huge, yet at any given night, I've seen Amber nearly full, which speaks to its popularity and delicious food. So delicious that I went once 3 days in a row, absolutely unintentionally, and the waitress recognized me. \n\nYes, it was slightly embarrassing. Yes, I pigged out at the awesome buffet. (They have this 7 days a week)\n\nAlright. Cutting to the food review. The dishes I've had - \n\nAppetizers\n1. English Peas, Portobello, & Goat Cheese Tikki - yummy patties with the aforementioned ingredients fried to delicious goodness. Give it a try!\n2. Aloo Peas Samosas - good. Nothing extraordinary. It's samosas. Ok alright, it's not greasy. Thank god for little miracles.\n3. Chicken Apricot Kebab - great combo of chicken and apricot! loved it.\n\nEntrees\n1. Butter Chicken - this is their signature. And they do it, very, VERY well. Go for it. \n2. Sea Bass Kokum Curry - so so great. Amazing fish dish and the coconut milk adds a ton to it.\n3. Paneer Lababdar - basically take what you had in the butter chicken and remove the chicken, and add paneer. Ladies and gents, we have paneer lababdar. Good stuff.\n4. Badam Bhara Baingan - OMG. Favorite dish on the menu. Hands down. Try it. Eggplant, caramelized onions, and almond PERFECTION.\n5. Lahsooni Saag Paneer - your typical great saag panneer.\n\nAnd of course, the tandoori rotis, the rice, the raita....all of it phenom.\n\nLastly, desserts - they're all pretty mediocre IMO compared to the rest of the menu. And come what may, please never try the Falooda with Strawberry ice cream. \n\nGo on, give it a try. It won't disappoint. It's definitely more expensive than many other indian restaurants out there, but it offers a variety that is consistently amazing with an absolutely awesome setting. \n\nHowever just in case you're still skeptical, definitely give the lunch buffet a try and try many of their different dishes for a great price.

Lots of meat, nice tart and sweet yet rich tomato-based sauce. Lots of large chunks of chicken to make the unusual high cost more worth it.\n\nTandoori sampler -2 pieces each of lamb seekh kebab, chicken tikka, & shrimp - 3 stars. The chicken was the best- huge chunks of juicy, tender, smoky chicken. The lamb was underseasoned and very strong in flavor (overwhelmingly so). It was also dry and fell apart. Added some of the mint chutney they gave, and it saved the kebabs a bit. We only ate one of them cos neither of us liked it. Shrimp was fine- nothing interesting about it.\n\nNaan was puffy and good - was more hollow bubble bread than doughy and soft like I like. Was good though.\n\nDrinks - the non-alcoholic mango mojito was good (and they can make an alcoholic version btw)\n\nI ordered the Belotta which was strawberry  puree with sparkling wine and a sweet liquer. I didn't love it cos it was too syrupy and sweet. I even tried saving it by squeezing in a bit of lime but no luck.\n\nPrices - super high so expect to be paying extra for the fancy setting. $40pp with only 1 alcoholic beverage, plain rice, 2 breads, 2 entrees.

While they had some of the typical dishes you'd expect at an all-you-can-eat Indian buffet (chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, saag), most have a twist like the tandoori chicken having breast pieces (and the meat is tender and not dry) and the saag having corn.  There are also a few dishes I hadn't had before like stuffed potatoes that were sweet and savory with some great spices to make it unique.  The butter chicken was absolutely amazing - creamy, rich and flavorful, this is a perfect way to have chicken.\n\nThe buffet can range in price from $16.95 - to $19.95 (Saturday - Sunday)...just be careful since the price may be displayed as $16.95 when in fact it is $19.95 on Sundays.", "author": "Ken G."}

Fast-forward a few years ahead to today, when I finally had the chance to check out the lunch buffet at the SF location...what a huge letdown!  Over-priced and westernized - if you're in the mood for Indian, I'd suggest taking a short walk into the T-Loin for Shalimar or Pakwan...you can thank me later.  \n\nThings started out well - there was a long line but we got in within 10 mins - I'll chalk that up to an Indian sista' hooking me up.  Putting our stuff down, we quickly made a beeline for the well-stocked buffet - they had a decent selection (maybe 10 dishes and 4 desserts - most dishes were veggie friendly) and full trays.  Piling on our plates, we sat down and dug in.  Before and after sitting down, we asked for an order of naan and were promised it would come soon - we didn't end up getting any naan until finishing our first plates!  \n\nSadly, the naan and the food weren't worth the wait. I'm all for being healthy, but naan with no ghee on it?  Sadness...we had two orders and both ended up being dry, chewy, and pretty unappetizing.  But of course the biggest letdown was the food - I'm not sure what's changed, but it seemed very catered to Western tastes, a la Trader Joes ready-made Indian food.  Tikka masala, mattar mushroom, saag paneer, \"vegetable curry\" (whatever that is - is that even a dish?) - all rich with ghee/cream but tasteless. I did enjoy the cilantro/mint chutney and the fish (seemed like it was marinated in the chutney), but that's about it.  \n\nTo top it off, the bill for some sub-par Indian food comes out to ~$20 per person - good food or not, $20 is high for a Indian lunch buffet.  Buffets in Little India (aka the South Bay) usually are under $10/person - I'm guessing here you're primarily paying for the location and decor (which seemed pretty standard trendy in the day time but I'm sure it's nice during the night).  \n\nI've been thinking about making a return trip to the Mountain View location (it's been a few years) but now I'm thinking twice about it.  It's kind of like re-watching Thundercats cartoons as a grownup - you're just setting yourself up for a letdown.  Why mess with the happy memories?", "author": "Rosers M."}

We ordered lassi, tofu tikki, palak chat, mirch masala, pesto Naan, veg biryani and a chicken item (my friend). Tofu Tikki is a must try. Period. I am not a big fan of Tofu even after being a vegetarian, but in this dish it was minced and I could hardly feel I am eating Tofu. The flavors were amazing. Not too bland either. Palak Chat was very well made too. Pesto naan is a new dish I had not tried anywhere else. Its Pesto in between two pieces of Naan. Went well with the mirch Masala. Liked the Biryani too. The best part of all the dishes were I could feel the flavors in my tongue with excess spice or hotness. My friend liked the chicken dish too. The ambience is awesome. We were lucky to get a reservation for 30 min from the time of the call.  Initially I felt it was expensive but after eating a very good flavorful dinner, I feel it is worth the price, ambience, location and service.", "author": "Shreyas P."}

The waitress came and true and behold, that is what they were serving. We asked if we could order off the regular menu and she said we could. We ordered drinks and were waiting for the waitress to bring the menu. My soft drink arrived first. We kept waiting and about 5 to 7 minutes passed with no drink for my wife or menus. Finally they delivered the menus. Another 5 to 7 minutes went by and we still had no second drink. I asked the waitress and she said she would check. The menus look good but pricey. We decided on the buffet since it was a better value.\n\nWe went to serve ourselves and it was pretty well picked over. The food also appeared as it had been out there for some time. We should have left, but my wife had not eaten all day so we decided to continue. The food was also semi-cold. Overall, the food was nothing to write home about. Once we did our first serving, our waitress came over and said that the buffet was going to close in 15 minutes. Ok, so why did they not say that to us before we sat down??

It's in a busy part of town off of Market, I think.  I'm not a local, so I don't recall, exactly.  Lots of shopping and other places to eat around it.  My wife and I always try to hit up the best local Indian place we can find on Yelp when we're out of town.\n\nWe come in the front door and the people at the front desk are dressed to the nines.  All the waiters are dressed very well and the guy that seated us was in a suit.  I felt very under dressed in my shorts and t-shirt.  Something of note...when we went in, they just kind of looked at us.  No one was in front of us, but we weren't seated immediately or even greeted.  This was kind of off putting, but I let it roll of my back because I'm laid back and it's just no big deal.  We were eventually seated after, I guess, they realized we were actually there to eat.\n\nWe were seated and everything went as a typical dining experience should go.  Our drink order was taken, we looked at the menu, etc, etc.  I ordered the butter chicken and my wife ordered the chicken biryani.  We had every intention of sharing.  When the food arrived, the chicken biryani came in a cast iron type of pot, which I think it was cooked in.  That was a pretty neat touch, keeping with the typical communal serving of Indian cuisine that I have had.  The butter chicken was served in a dish, while the rice was served separate on a plate.  Just as expected.\n\nMy wife is not much of one that can handle hot spice very well.  She will eat it, but not too much of it.  The chicken biryani was very spicy.  The spiciest biryani I have ever had, no doubt.  However, it was FANTASTIC!  Even my wife couldn't stop eating it!  She was pounding four glasses of water while eating, but she really did enjoy it.  The butter chicken was excellent also, albeit a little too sweet for us.  The biryani was definitely the highlight of the meal despite its spice level.\n\nThe service, aside from initial impression, was great.  Everyone was dressed well and we were treated very well.  Our drinks were kept full and the staff was classy.\n\nIf in the San Francisco area, I would definitely go back again.

We also tried the Black Pepper Crab - and that was kind of like a crab salad - nothing to write home about that one - it sounded better on the menu, then the actual presentation.\n\nDinner - I had the house special - Butter Chicken - the \"signature\" dish - of Tandor chicken in a spicy tomato sauce - if you haven't seen a clear thread here \"SPICY\" is the word of the day - but it's an Indian restaurant, so it didn't disappoint on spices - it just gives everything a very exciting little something extra that makes it unique.\n\nSide order of the Saffron Pulao - the Indian version of rice - it was rice and I recommend you order your own bowl, as our waiter thought we could split it between the two of us - not really enough to cover all that you get with the main meal....BUT we order Naan in the \"flavor\" versions of Garlic and Pesto - a small up-charge, but I'm a big fan of both garlic and pesto, so worth the extra for me and I used it sop up some of that tomato sauce, which was soooo good, you can see why it is the house special.\n\nGood service - we were never rushed.  All the food came out at a good pace and was always hot and flavorful.  The only bummer was the 8-10 guys that came in during the meal and really were not friendly dinners - this place isn't cheap when you add all the extras on, so when you get a Sports Bar yell fest going on during a really good meal, it does put a damper on the evening.

Since I only live a few blocks away from Amber and saw the sign countless times I thought I'd give it a try before I went traveling.\n\nThe service was pretty good but the receptionist was a little dicey with certain customers, thankfully not with me. We got seated sooner than expected and the service at the table was great.\n\nThe food was pretty good as well. The garlic naan wasn't as strong as I was hoping but the sauces in the curries made up for it. The chicken curry was nice and creamy with a very runny sauce, which makes dipping all the more fun. The prawn curry we ordered was sadly a little thicker and a bit spicier. Still very good and we got it doggie bagged to eat the next day.\n\nMy only issue is maybe it's a little bit pricey for what's on offer. I didn't feel like I got anything special out of the experience yet paid a little more than what I usually would for Indian food. Would certainly eat here again though.", "author": "Greg C."}

And you pay for it. \n\nLet's be real, the food at this place (although tasty) fails to live up to its price, surroundings, and service. I ordered the Butter Chicken, Garlic Chive Naan, and the Samosas. The Butter Chicken was really just Chicken Tikka Masala. I have an issue with them slightly altering the name of it to make it sound more original, but it was pretty good. Standard Tikka Masala sauce but the chicken was super tender and pretty juicy--rare for this dish. I just could digest paying $19.95 for a tiny bowl of it. The Garlic Chive naan was decent. Nothing special. Nothing you couldn't get for $2 somewhere else. But I paid $4. And the Samosas were good. I really enjoyed them because they were smaller. Possibly a negative? Maybe. Except smaller Samosas means a larger proportion of fried outer skin and I'm always down for some fried deliciousness. \n\nThe service, however, was EXCELLENT. Not once did I ever need to ask for my water glass to be refilled and the waitress was super tentative and quick to replenish our basket of naan. The decor is beautiful, with rich woods and candlelight. The bar looks amazing, and I might go back simply to sit and have a cocktail. \n\nOverall, this place has decent food, although, in my opinion, not worth paying 3x what you could be paying for Indian food elsewhere. The restaurant is beautiful, but  if I'm going to be slopping up some tikka masala with naan and smelling like Indian food anyways, I don't really think I need to be eating by candlelight and sitting in a cushioned chair. Amber is a cool Indian eatery, but not anything to be blown away by.", "author": "Michelle Q."}

They people who run this place are bound to disappoint you.\n\nFull Sob Story:\n\nThe food at this place is delicious, however, the people operating this place should not be in the hospitality business. The only reason I give this place one star is because of the food. Otherwise they don't even deserve that.\n\nI had made reservations at this place for a special occasion. My in laws were visiting our place for the first time and I decided to take them to Amber.  We made a reservation for 8 PM on a Saturday night. We got the usual its unusually busy tonight and we can hang out at the bar.  We did not mind that as we were not in a huge hurry and didn't mind sipping on some cocktails as we waited.  25 minutes after our reservation time, they came in and told us that they had our table ready.  So we went to our table.  You would think that for making the customer wait 25 minutes after they would have given us a decent seat.  Oh but you would be so wrong about that.  The table was between the kitchen entrance and a place where all the waiters picked up water from. Further the table was diagonally placed next to a pillar making it really awkward for sitting next to the pillar.\n\nOn any other day I wouldn't have cared and just enjoyed the food.  However, I had made reservations a week ahead of time for a special occasion. This just started to get on my nerves.  I went back to the hostess and asked her if she could relocate us.  To which she complied and said we can go ahead and wait further at the Bar.  We waited  another 20 minutes at the bar/lounge. At this point we had been waiting 50 minutes past our reservation time.  So I decided to go wait at the reception.\n\nAt the reception, much to my surprise all the guests (parties for 3, 4, 5, 6 walkins... whatever the number)  were being seated promptly. This got me very annoyed and I approached the General Manager, Anupam Bhatia, mentioning the whole situation. Instead of trying to ease things for me, he blamed me for not liking our originally assigned table. He said that the awkward table between the kitchen and serving table was not as bad as I conjured it up to be and it was our fault.  Given that four people in my party were in consensus about that table, I hardly think his reaction was warranted. \n\nSo all in all great food, but horrible experience. I will just not be going back on principle. I hope the chef moves to a restaurant that has a better hospitality team. Otherwise his success is being held back by the people who run the place.", "author": "M D."}

So long story short, we ordered Paneer tikka we got it and as always quantities are very small for their 20$ prices for each item. We got hardly 8 small paneer cubes and that too taste was not that great compared to low-end indian restaurants which server far better indian food than this amber. So now I took a paneer tikka cube to eat i saw HAIR on it. I have not checked all paneer cubes though so I called waiter to show that and get another plate (till that I am fine; now she made all us frustrate with her answer) her reply is like this with out even apologizing: \"Oh I have not seen any customer complaining before in last 3months; never seen thats strange let me show it chef will get another plate\" this is her answer. We even told her \"we have seen few COCKROACHES last time when we visited for dinner her reply: \"Oh I have never seen that happen before\" and she left. She got plate back now even with less paneer cubes than before. We finished our dinner and asked her to get check. So, by this time we were expecting she would at least take that paneer tikka money out from check; NO she still included the price. When we wrote less TIP for her (for such worst customer service we had obviously we should have not write even that 6$ for her service) she came back to ask for more money. And she even said directly to us if you want i can include tip and give you total then you can pay if you don't want to write TIP which was so RUDE and MEAN. Out of all above, after she gave shit about TIP we had to write a big amount for her even though she does not deserve a single penny; then she left and infront of us she was BITCHING with all other waitresses/waiters about us. (OMG never seen such kind of attitude people anywhere else she is definitely UNFIT for any job)\n\nCome on!!! If you don't want to be a WAITRESS then go do some other job instead of customer dealing and giving shit to customers like this and making not to come to your restaurant again. I would definitely be not going again and I will not recommend my FRIENDS and COLLEAGUES to even visit this place. They have very less choice in MENU for Dinners hardly few to select and keep eating same thing whenever ever you visit. I never write any yelp reviews even though how bad restaurant is and their food is (I instead don't visit that place again) this place has good FOOD it will survive only if it keeps professional people as waitress and some hygiene.", "author": "Hari B."}

The sea bass was not cooked enough, it was wet inside, which was surprising because usually Tandoori cooks things dry.  Very disappointing.  Others in our party had the curried sea bass (better than the tandoori version) and some vegetarian dishes (also good).  The price was more alarming considering that bread and rice were extra.

At first, I was a little hesitant about dining at a \"higher end/fancy\" Indian restaurant. Admittedly, most of my Indian cuisine experience has been from the hole-in-the-wall joints - and not knockin' any of them, because they for the most part have been delish. I just didn't know if I could justify paying 3x the cost for a dish I would generally pay $6-7 for... especially if I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference between them.\n\nSo in the end, could I tell the difference between Amber's high quality ingredients and something I could get at say, Lahore Kahari?  Honestly no; I couldn't tell the difference between Amber's food and a (really good) cheap eat Indian food. But I will say that Amber's food is very good, and taste-wise, ranks very high in my limited Indian food experience.\n\nWhat you're really paying a bit extra for is the fabulously attentive service (my mimosa flute and the BF's mango juice - both coming with the weekend lunch/brunch price BTW - were always refilled promptly when empty and our finished buffet plates were removed quickly), the nice sit-down decor, and the ambiance.  In the end, we left completely stuffed and satisfied with our meal and service.\n\nI don't know if I would come here for dinner, as it is expensive and especially since I couldn't discern the difference in food quality between it and a good Indian cheap-eat. But I would say the weekend lunch/brunch is a good value, and an especially nice place to take out-of-town guests or for large groups without the typical SF weekend brunch wait.", "author": "Mercutio k."}

My friend and I came here for a drink before splitting on evening.  I believe it was like a hump day evening, so really we thought we'd easily find a seat.  However, come 5 p.m., when the happy hour starts, we got there to notice that it was already filling up quite a bit.  That's impressive.\n\nNice high ceilings, medium sound volume - mainly in the electronica regime.  That's certainly not my favorite, but it supplemented the trendy atmosphere affirmatively.  The mixologists seem to know what they're doing and as is now becoming a norm, they have Indian twists to all their drinks.  I of course went with my Old faithful gin martini and my friend got a glass of wine. \n\nThe small plates were actually very delicious, reasonably affordable for a happy hour and feels just right after eating.  It's not overly filling and yet keeps your hunger down for a couple of hours.  I'm not fond of the location.  Too high profile and also too touristy.  But I can live with that.

Please, people, you can go back, don't turn your plate into curry-mageddon. It varies each day but the usual suspects, chickpeas, okra, peas, butter chicken, were there, seasoned with a depth and complexity that made them new dishes after the hole-in-the-wall Pakistani-Indian dives all over town. There were extras like a live dosa and a self-serve puri station and three kinds of green salad. The standouts for me were three simple things: a simple paneer curry, where the homemade cheese was actually toothy and nutty flavored, a star in its own right, an excellent raita (yogurt sauce) as thick as greek yogurt but creamy and not sour, and two pudding desserts, the best something like tapioca pudding without the tapioca but with sandgrain-sized particles instead (kheer?), and a strong taste of saffron. The goat curry was also nice.\n\nBe warned, this is not healthy food, it's from the \"fancier it is, the more cream, butter, and ghee you add\" school but not any worse than others.\n\nService was cheerful, attentive, personable, and capable, noticeably good service. As for the bottomless mimosas they didn't wait for you to ask, a runner was walking the room with a pitcher, if you left the table you might just come back to a full glass (and if you want to skip the OJ that's fine too). Decor is rather fancy and a little coccoonish for being a few steps under sidewalk level. Family, date, and business meeting friendly all at the same time, there was some of each. Also, a lot of Indian families were here.\n\nAll that, at an excellent value. The price comes to about $26.50 per person including tax and mimosa, tip extra, for a feast that will leave you in a tipsy food coma so strong you'll skip dinner.\n\nI've been to the lounge for happy hour and late night snacks and drinks, a very nice place but I would rate it a 4 for that, brunch is the big deal.", "author": "Gil S."}

Talk about a no-brainer...\n\nSeems like all the Amber India reviewers are raving about the butter chicken.  And for good reason: Tender morsels of chicken in a rich, spicy-not-hot sauce -- pour that stuff over a large plate of rice and I'd be more than satisfied.  Nonetheless it was quite a treat to sample from about a dozen other offerings.  The naan (Indian flatbread) was brought to our table piping-hot, fresh from the oven, and perfect when dipped in the butter chicken sauce.\n\nThe dessert table had fresh fruit (good stuff) and some Indian desserts (mostly not good stuff).  One was called Laddu, which according to our waitress were balls of chickpea-based flour and sugar and coconut.  Our party of 10 unanimously agreed that the Laddu was absolutely disgusting.  We didn't think it was Amber's fault that it tasted nasty -- just our uncultured American selves who are used to sickly sweet creamy American desserts.\n\nThe lunch buffet is certainly not cheap at ~$20 a person, but I thought it was terrific value.  Highly recommended, and I was so pleased with the experience that I'll come back for full-price dinner someday.", "author": "Gary D."}

I ordered the eggplant but tasted my friend's tandoori chicken too and both were wonderful. I would probably classify this more of a 'gourmet' Indian restaurant, given the food, atmosphere and presentation.\n\n I don't like spicy food but even though my eggplant dish was spicy it was worth it since it tasted so good-and there was a constantly filled glass of water nearby. I take one star off for the price, but you do get what you pay for, and if you want to splurge on great food, I highly recommend it.

Interesting, but my least favorite of the three entrees.\nBasil tandoori chicken - Interesting tandoori style, though not really the traditional style I've been accustomed to. The addition of basil gave it a heavier flavor, but not overwhelming. Pretty good.\nSamosas were served as the appetizer. Good, middle of the road samosas.\n\nOnly downside of the place was the dish of anise seed / candy nibs that Indian places always have by the cash register.

Our server warned us that the kitchen was a bit backed up when we arrived, but the wait for the food wasn't too bad.\n\nAlso of note - the server forgot to submit one of our appetizers, and when we pointed out the mistake she brought it out for our dinner and comped the cost of the appetizer on our bill. That's the service more restaurants SHOULD provide when they make an error! I'd love to come back and eat here again.", "author": "Denise B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-19", "description": "I LOVE Amber. I had a great time here for dinner and I've been lusting after the food ever since I had tried Amber. Now I don't want to say that this is legit Indian food (heck, I wouldn't know) but they know what they do well and they stick to it. Amber's food is a bit Americanized but like I said, it's GOOD and I'm glad they keep at it.\n\nWhat I had:\n1) Aloo Peas Samosas -- potatoes were spiced just right! I usually am a pansy when it comes to spicy food but these samosas had a good 'kick' to them and the sauces that came with it were superb. \n\n2) Butter Chicken with Tandoori Naan and Saffron Rice -- MY FAVORITE. The Butter Chicken was tender and drenched in a rich, buttery, tomato sauce. Each bite I took with the saffron rice (which was, by the way, cooked just right and wonderfully fragrant on its own) was heavenly goodness. As if this wasn't satisfying enough, I used the crispy naan to dip whatever was left of the buttery tomato sauce. YUM.\n\n3) Badam Bhara Baingan -- normally I don't like vegetarian dishes because I feel that too many spices are thrown in to make up for the lack of fat and flavor that comes from meat... but this eggplant dish was great. The eggplant drew a lot of flavor from the caramelized onions (which I love) and I think that was it. There were no add-on complex spices, just simple and savory. The caramelized eggplant and onion complemented the saffron rice so well.\n\n4) Jaipuri Bhindi -- okra dish cooked with tomato and green mango. Wow. It was dee-lish to say the least. It was perfectly seasoned and it had a bit of crisp on the shell of the okra, which gave it a nice texture (I'm used to steaming okra, which makes it soft and gooey). Loved this dish as well! \n\n5) Mango Brulee -- okay, I LOVE anything mango so I might be biased... this creme brulee was sublime. The custard tasted like mango lassi -- sweet, fruity, with a bit of tang -- and, of course, the caramelized top layer provided for a nice crunch with the soft custard. I would definitely recommend this.\n\n6) \"Bru\" Coffee Kulfi with Chocolate Sauce -- I don't like the taste of coffee but this frozen dessert was great... especially when doused in rich chocolate sauce. The combination was sweet! I think I'd stick with the Mango Brulee for dessert, though. \n\nI liked that they had a section for meat-eaters and vegetarians. Both had great dishes to choose from and all that I've tried were delectable. Amber has a great ambiance -- perfect for a romantic date -- and the service is quick. I'd recommend Amber to anyone!", "author": "Jenny O."}

And vice versa. So since Amber India is beautiful inside, my friends and I had somewhat low expectations of the food when we ordered. Also, since it is Indian American fusion, we weren't sure of what to expect. But luckily we were wrong. The food ended up being really good! We ordered the paneer lababdar, which is just your regular paneer tikka masala, saag paneer lahsooni, and three types of naan (chili cheese kulcha, pesto naan, and regular in case the other two sucked). The entrees were good in that they were standard from what I've had at other restaurants. Could have been a tad bit spicier but overall, good. The naans, however, were amazing! I was really weary of the chili cheese and pesto but they turned out so delicious and weren't too strong that they overpowered the entrees. I'd definitely recommend both. \n\nThe bar area looked really cool but we didn't get a chance to sit so I would definitely come back to check it out.", "author": "Krishna S."}

A locally grown cauliflower floret sauced in coconut cream, mustard seeds and curry leaves. I hope to attempt an replicate this at home. We'll see. We could've easily devoured a dozen of these. \nNext came Amber's Signature Frontier Lamb Chop (Australian Lamb Rack) Paradisiacal! Prior to this event, a restaurant in Marigot, St Maarten had  my first place for rack of lamb, this place easily tied it. Melt in your mouth with perfect flavor. \nThe lamb was shared with Signature Butter Chicken (Shredded Tandoori Chicken). My girlfriend has had many experiences with buttered chicken past. She was immediately taken back by the quality and taste of the dish. Stating \"I've never had better! Nothing can even comes close\" \nThe sever was very attentive and personable. Outstanding.

The $12 Crab appetizer had several pieces of shell in it - learn to clean it before you learn to cook it.\n\nThe decor is a 5.\n\nSo they have to nail all their dishes not just one or two and I believe they can get there with a little focus. Next they have to nail the service to justify the price tab - $180 for Dinner for two - I think this is a much bigger challenge because they need to get first-rate management and they might not feel the need because the restaurant is crowded.

The staff was friendly and accommodating so that was a major plus.\n\nBites are a tad on the pricey side and in my opinion don't seem to match the quality.\n\nOverall a safe bet but your palette won't be thanking you anytime soon.", "author": "Marcia M."}

We absolutely loved the chicken tikka with orange and figs.  Dip that with the avocado raita and BAM you have a taste overload!  32 hour dal (lentils) was well made and rich, the rice soaked it up quickly.  The eggplant dish was also incredible - whole baby eggplants roasted and then topped with a rich, thick Indian gravy.  Yum!

I'm quite familiar with Amber's proper restaurant as it is my team's favorite Indian Buffet in the FiDi... allegedly right on with reproducing regional favorites.  Their to-go cart is a nice hold over between work celebrations.  Most interesting are the arbitrage opportunities.  The chicken wrap, for instance, sells for $6 whereas the proper restaurant prices it at $7.95.  Perhaps a reward for those dilligent enough to have sought this rather obscure Farmer's Market.\n\nChicken Wrap: Fluffy and fresh naan hugs chunks of chicken curry.  The chicken is mostly, if not all, white meat and surprisingly tender given the cut.  The curry is top notch with tons of distinctive spices and herbs.  They definitely don't skimp on their to-go items.  Not as greasy as a kati roll but tasty in it's own right.  \n\nSamosa: Much more lightly fried than samosas from fast food, steam table and lower end joints.  Inside small cubes of boiled potato and peas are smeared with a dry spice rub.  Overall feels lighter than other samosas and when dipped in the yogurt/mint/cilantro chutney, it is definitely a treat.", "author": "Adam B."}

That was literally the only choice since it was either getting the $20 buffet or paying super high prices to order off the dinner menu. \n\nDosa, Palak Paneer, Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Chipotle Grilled Chicken, Potatoes (of what sort I cannot remember). \n\nDosa, Palak Paneer. I have two words and two words only: NOT IMPRESSED. Dosa, it was the first time I've had it and I didn't think it was anything special, just like an Indian flour omelette I guess. Palak Paneer, I've definitely had better elsewhere.\n\nButter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Chipotle Grilled Chicken. Basically all of their chicken was good. Butter Chicken was really good, but quite normal tasting, could have gotten the same elsewhere. Chipotle Chicken was also good, I liked that I could taste the charcoal grilled flavor of it. \n\nChampagne. Buffet comes with your choice of drink. Pretty good champagne though I must admit!\n\nNaan. Pretty good, but definitely nothing to write home about since I've had the same elsewhere also.\n\nCoca Cola. I got this because I love me some coke! :)\n\nSoupy dessert I can't remember the name of anymore, Fruit, Pistachio Cake.\n\nSoupy dessert was good, couldn't eat too much of it though because the coconut milk in it was super heavy. It had little noodles in it though, they were like really thin vermicelli noodles, super interesting but super good and different from anything I've ever had. \n\nFruit was good, but can you really go wrong with fruit? \n\nPistachio Cake. Me no likey. \n\nOverall, I'm not impressed with this place because I didn't think it was that great. Obviously service was barely had because it was a buffet. But also the service they did have was subpar. The hostess sat another table before us, even though we had arrived first. We were also seated at a booth, which were crazy dirty, stains everywhere and pieces of food everywhere, it was disgusting. Pretty much made me lose my appetite. It was also quite expensive for what was offered food-wise. I mean the only meat they had was chicken, that's not worth $20.

They served a five course fix price menu with several choices and something for everyone. \n\nThe evening started with bubbly and an amuse bouche served in phyllo dough. It was decent, but not a sign of things to come. Often the amuse bouche is the best item the chef shares, definitely not this time.\n\nFor the first course, I got crab with ginger and curry, whild my date got spinach which was battered and fried. If you must eat vegetables, this is the way to go. Kidding aside, her spinach was outstanding. The crab was good, but the curry masked the sweetness of the crab. It tasted a bit like pulled pork.\n\nFrom the tandoor we selected prawns and cottage cheese. Now, the kitchen was building momentum. The prawns were perfectly cooked and the cottage cheese was firm and flavorful. \n\nSo far the portions seemed a little small, but they were first courses. The entrees came and my yogurt marinated rack of lamb was outstanding. It was so tender, I couldn't stop eating it and portion was big. My date's chicken was also much to her liking.\n\nThe two types of naan were great for collecting all the savory sauce served with the entree.\n\nDesserts were decent - she had a cake and I had sorbet.\n\nWe selected the wine pairing too. It was good, though the first course came with a second sparkling wine, which was odd since they served complimentary sparkling wine to start the meal. The pours of non-sparkling wine were a little small. I finally had to ask for a refill with the lamb.\n\nThe service was good, but the pacing of the dishes was off, mostly the time between dishes was too long. It almost cost them a star, but the waiter said this was their first fixed price dinner ever, so maybe the kitchen is working out the kinks. I'll give them a break on it this time.

The guy on the phone had a hard time hearing me for some reason but I didn't think anything of it until we arrived the next day. The host on duty said my reservation was for two not three but it wouldn't be an issue. I was a little annoyed that he wanted to be nitpicky about it but we were seated promptly so I let it slide. Note to self: Use Open Table or repeat info back to whomever is taking the reservation before hanging up the phone. \n\nOnce seated, our waiter (I want to say his name was Carlos? Not sure.) arrived immediately with glasses, water and took our drink orders. The Thanksgiving buffet came with bottomless mimosas (oj or mango) but we all had to decline for various reasons (driving, work later, alcohol allergy) but we saw practically every other table indulge so I can assume they were pretty good. \n\nBy the way, the restaurant vibe is upscale but not overly stuffy so I saw other diners in everything from North Face fleece & jeans to suits & saris. I dig that! :)\n\nWe were there early enough (1pm-ish, they opened at 11:30am) so we didn't have to wait to go through the buffet which I heard people mention on Yelp. We had also expected it to be strictly Indian food but they added a roasted Turkey carving station with cranberry chutney and for the day, some Turkey Tandoori. Everything was tasty and well seasoned, particularly the turkey and butter chicken. YUM. Through out our meal, our waiter and his fellow wait staff were great, refilling our drinks without us asking, clearing the used plates promptly and bringing multiple (!) baskets of fresh naan piping hot from the kitchen. The only thing that was a bummer was the mint chocolate gelato in the dessert station. It was more soupy than frozen. I think they may have been better off with something that could hold up with less effort like a chocolate pudding or custard?\n\nBy the end of our visit though, we were definitely stuffed in that Thanksgiving kind of way and too jolly to care. At  $24.99 a person (buffet + drinks included), it was a great holiday deal / indulgence. My friends and I are definitely considering coming back to try Amber on a regular weekday or for the weekend brunch. Or maybe on Christmas Eve or Christmas if they are open! :)", "author": "J. L."}

Our waiter was suberb -- we were a party of 6 (including two elementary school age girls) and he took his time explaining the menu. The Flash Fried Bloomsdale Spinach was out of this world - way better than kale chips!! Even the kids liked it; i've never tasted anything like it. The sea bass w/mango was my dish and oh so yummy. The 4 chile roasted sea bass though was the best dish on the table. The eggplant dish was ordered as an appetizer and we ended up ordering another plate of it. The spices were perfectly blended, nothing was overpowering. Only disappointment was the chai tea believe it or not. I definitely want to go back.", "author": "Helen W."}

Whatever it was, it was the best damn Indian buffet I've had in ages. \n\nThe first signs of the place being good was the presence of all the Indian folks. The quality is usually directly proportional to the number of ethnic locals. I've tested this hypothesis thoroughly over the years and once again, it was proved correct.\n\nThe vegetarian spread was quite impressive - chole, gobi, bhindi, paneer along with naan and rice. There were a couple of other dishes that I had to miss out on as I wanted to keep room for dessert. \n\nYup, luckily, I had a peek at the dessert section before I started and it totally blew me away. Usually buffets come with 2-4 dessert items. Over here, there were at least 5. Five being the number I ate. There were more but as much as I wanted my stomach said no. Kala jamuns, rajbhog, gajjar halwa, kheer, and moong dal burfi. Don't let the names scare you away. They were quite awesome.\n\nWashed my food down with a glass of good mango lassi. \n\nOh oh oh, I almost forgot the apps (I'm still in dessert wonderland).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-12", "description": "Being of Indian origin, I probably hold Indian restaurants to a higher standard than most.  You might call that a bias, but I would call it knowing what I'm talking about.  Amber India is a pretty restaurant, with a modern but comfy aesthetic.  The food, though, is about as boring as Indian food can be.  \n\nMost Indian restaurants in the US start with an authentic Indian recipe, and then they cut the flavor in half (for fear of offending sensitive western palates).  Amber cuts the flavor to about a measly quarter of where it ought to be.  And to be clear, I'm not talking about \"heat\"; I'm talking about flavor (Indian food, as a general rule, is not intended to be \"hot\").\n\nWe had:\n- Four-Chili Rubbed Sea Bass: The flavor was actually very good, but there just wasn't much of it.  The \"rub\" was apparently more of a gentle tap.  Very little of the flavors actually came through in the finished product.  Also, the fish was slightly undercooked.  And at $27, I was expecting more than 5 small pieces of fish.\n- Subj Korma: It is a common cheat, among western Indian restaurants, to subtract spices and other expensive ingredients, and then make up for it by adding butter or cream.  And that's precisely what they did here.  This was, without a doubt, the blandest Indian-style vegetable dish I've ever eaten anywhere.  And at $16, probably the most expensive as well.\n- Naan: It was good, but I suspect that if it were possible to subtract flavor from bread, they would have done so.  And $3.50 for a single serving?

Wish we hadn't. This is one of those places that would be great if you have a Groupon or living social deal. Otherwise this place is completely overpriced. $18 for an Indian buffet lunch? We should have walked away, but it was cold and we were hungry. \n\nThe selection was limited (only two different curries - chicken and lamb - and a bunch of other vegetable mixtures).  The naan bread was flat (not fluffy) and bland. Not really that great. The Butter Chicken was good though, and I had that each time i returned.  I don't believe there are dedicated service personnel to each table and its kind of just service each table. Which sounds great in theory, but there is no cohesiveness in the service (we would go a while before getting our naan bread, while being told someone was on it -- or go a while without refills of water). \n\nThis is the type of place where you get your first plate, and immediately regret spending the money to eat there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-07", "description": "Amber has great food.  The Butter Chicken is their signature dish and it's basically as advertised -- chicken from the tandoor, rich tomato sauce.  It's extremely filling.  The roganjosh is rich and has a bright spice flavor; the lamb is meltingly tender.  The naan and rice are always made perfectly.  I particularly love their jaipuri bhindi, the okra cooked down with fennel seeds, tomato, and green mango.  The okra has just the right amount of sticky (not slimy!) caramelization, and there's just a hint of bright acid in it.  It's addictive and appealing even for folks who hate okra.\n\nIt's more expensive than your typical indian joint.  I am fine with that.  For some reason people expect that French food should be expensive, but not Indian food.  If a French place charges $20 for a great roasted chicken, then it's OK, it's gourmet.  But a great butter chicken dish?  Well, cue the bitching ... \n\nIndian cuisine is subtle, difficult to make well, and relies on the same laws of physics as any other cuisine:  fresh food, good technique, giving a damn, etc. etc.  Amber does all of the above.  They can charge higher prices, and it's worth paying up.", "author": "J W."}

Dropped off one of my cars at the mechanic today so was stuck downtown and was walking around trying to decide where to eat when I discovered this.  Wow, this area is nice...I'm a native San Franciscan, but had no idea all this was here.  When did they build all this?\n\nHave been craving good Indian food for the longest time and was trying to think of a good downtown Indian place when I suddenly saw a sign for Amber.  Had no idea this was here!  I was definitely surprised and elated.  Saw that they had a weekday buffet for $16.95 and thought it a bit pricey so I decided to pass and walk around the food court of the new Westfield Center first.  After seeing their prices for blah food, ($11.99 for mediocre looking plastic pack sushi), I hurried back to Amber for lunch.\n\nUpon walking in, I was very pleased with the decor and the level of service.  For lack of a better description, this is the most yuppified, most upscale Indian restaurant I have ever had the fortune to dine in.  Needless to say, I liked it.  The wine list certainly made me happy as well.  I chose a glass of Sageland white riesling that I thought would complement the spicy food perfectly.  From my first sip, I knew I made a killer choice...it was delicious and a perfect pairing (patting myself on the back) which really added to the experience.  At $8.00, I thought it to be really reasonable too, compared to what a lot of others charge for a glass of wine in a comparable setting.\n\nUpon seeing the buffet area, I was slightly disappointed at the selection as I had been expecting something on a grander scale.  Since it was Amber, I had envisioned something along the lines of Bombay Garden in Fremont which has a huge number of choices (although nowhere near the level of quality).  Regardless, what Amber's buffet lacked in variety, it more than made up for in quality.\n\nEverything I tasted was wonderful (have to admit, I've been craving good Indian food for the longest time!) and paired with my wine choice, it was like a little bit of heaven in the middle of the day.  Their signature dish, butter chicken (shredded tandoori chicken in rich tomato sauce) and Sindhi Murg (juicy morsels of chicken flavored with fenugreek leaves and brown garlic) were my two absolute faves.  The pieces of chicken in both of these curries were surprisingly big and juicy, definitely moist and not dry.  Over rice, each of these was fantastic in their own way and I was impressed.  What can I say...the diet went out the window temporarily and I definitely ended up eating more than I had intended.\n\nThe only true negative that I discovered during my experience was their potato balls (not sure what they were called) which were really dry and tasteless.  They were so dry and chalky that I regretted getting them from the first bite and wondered if I was doing something wrong or if I was supposed to be pouring curry over them (I didn't) as they were so bad.  The tandoori chicken looked good, but the pieces I had were on the dry side...very different from the awesome chunks I had in the earlier curries.  Regardless, I enjoyed my lunch here today immensely.\n\nThe service was first rate too and you could tell that the staff was all very well trained.  When I first walked in, it was so dead that I questioned the intelligence of eating a buffet lunch in an upscale downtown Indian restaurant on a Monday in this economy.  Within minutes, the place was packed.  Wow...economy...what bad economy?\n\nThis was the best Indian dining experience I've had in a long time and my new favorite.  Food was first rate, as was the service.  Will definitely be back!", "author": "Roy N."}

I'd estimate they had around 20 items broken out into a couple of different areas (salads, savory, rice / naan, desserts, etc.)\n\nUnlike the other Indian buffets that I've been to, the quality and creativity of these dishes didn't disappoint (i.e., it wasn't just pounds upon pounds of greasy and flavorless chicken tikki masala and saag paneer). The usual dishes were definitely better than most others based on spice, flavor, and lack-of-greasiness. Additionally, they offer other, more creative dishes to appeal to the more adventurous spirit while still making them mainstream enough for the average diner. In particular, the pickled mustard chicken in the cold section that was to die for - don't overlook it just because its in the salad area!\n\nIt was totally empty on the Saturday afternoon that we went.

Much like Neil B. wrote, our food took far too long without explanation or apology or complimentary anything for our taste. \n\nWe arrived at 6pm to a lovely ambiance and had nice seating by the window. I ordered an amber blush to start and my boyfriend had a beer. The drinks took at least ten minutes to come out, though I'd highly recommended my non-alcoholic drink. Another fifteen minute passed before our mussels appetizer came out. We thoroughly enjoyed it with the fresh and fluffy naan. Our appetizer plates were removed and we literally sat for AT LEAST another awkward twenty-five minutes or so before our entrees came out. No one offered us extra naan to dip with our mussels broth and only once did the waitress briefly swing by and say almost coming. The ice in my drink melted away. In the time we waited for our entree, a lone diner finished his meal and left as did a neighboring couple who had arrived at about the same time we did. Finally, finally, our butter chicken and lamb shank came out without a word. The food was amazing but our whole dining experience took two hours!\n\nYes our water was kept filled and the busboys were very nice, but our waitress was distant. The problem could have easily been rectified with more friendliness, explanation, or apology or even free naan but alas, we left disappointed and angry. Did they have live lamb tied to the wall out back that had to be killed for our dinner hence the wait time?! No idea...", "author": "Jan P."}

This should never happen with this type of appetizer. \n\nThe lamb we ordered was good but not great, it should have been more tender and slow cooked, the spinach and mushroom dish was great though, the bread was great, and I liked the option of the whole wheat naan.  \n\nThe ambiance was great, the place is very much downtown, not a lot of Indian influence, there is a lounge in the front to just get a drink.

Almost to the point that you question the quality/authenticity of the food based on all your other Indian eating experiences.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-04", "description": "Five Stars:  Rogan Josh is always my yardstick for Indian food; Amber's is outstanding with succulent lamb, balanced spices that are moderately hot and lots of gravy for the naan bread.  Bhindi are perfectly cooked, naans are fresh and crispy coated with soft centers, the butter chicken is always delicious (if your cardiologist is okay with your cholesterol levels).  \n\nFour stars: Some argue the prices are high - I think they are very fair for the quality of the food, service and ambience.  Keep in mind that this is a restaurant for a lovely evening out, rather than a 'hole in the wall'.\n\nOne star: Why are the dining chairs so darn heavy?  \n\nSUMMARY: Amber serves my favorite Indian food in the Bay Area in an inviting dining room.  If you are new to Indian food, come for the lunch buffet; for less than $20 you can try the signature dishes (rogan josh and butter chicken) and several vegetable and rice dishes.  Locations in Mountain View and San Jose are just as well-executed.", "author": "Nerdy G."}

They had replaced the Paneer in the ubiquitous Saag Paneer with Mushrooms. The stuffed peas paratha was very dry. The tawa mushrooms were ok.\n\nThe food was served so fast, that it almost felt like it had just been warmed up in the microwave.  Even the naans weren't hot and didn't seem just-made, like you'd expect in most Indian restaurants. Besides, they brought out the appetizer and main course together....one would expect that such a restaurant has it's act together re: the sequence of appetizers & entrees. \n\nGranted the restaurant was busy, but it was not full, and we were seated past peak dinner time...so it's not even like they had a long line of folks waiting and needed to turn tables quickly.

I don't recommend it at all.\n\nMy friend and I went in for drinks on a Friday night around 630pm.  Beautiful atmosphere with upbeat music in the background.  And that's where the love ends.\n\nWe were at the bar.  And, while the folks at the bar were friendly, we had to constantly get their attention to receive attention to order and refresh our drinks.  On the bartenders' recommendation, I had a femme fatale - the flavor was dull and couldn't really taste the many ingredients with any distinction.  The bartender asked me what I thought and when I said, \"uh...it was okay\"  He just looked at me puppy like as if to say sorry.  \n\nWe were hungry, and decided to have a few nibbles.  I attempted to order samosas - turns out they were out.  It would have been helpful to know that when I received the menu.   I asked for a recommendation.  \"The cauliflower!\" says the bartender.  We order it.  It bites - sauce is drowning the veg and is too creamy.  He asks us about it, and we say, \"M'eh\"  He smiles and goes back to what he's doing.  \n\nWe're still hungry so, against my better judgement, I inquire with another bartender - what else do you have that is good?  We didn't like the cauliflower.  \"The naan w/tandoori chicken on top.\"  I'm thinking that would be fine, an Indian restaurant can't screw up tandoori chicken, right?!\n\nWell, they did.  Again, too much sauce - oh! And since when does tandoori chicken have sauce?!  Looks like chicken stew on pan fried bread dough.  Naan oily and more fried than baked.  Ugh!  Again, we were asked our thoughts and shook our heads.\n\nWe eat a few bites (hungry!) and then get the check with most of the food on the plate.  I was disappointed that they charged us for every last thing.  At most fine places, I've been offered a replacement, or to have the food taken off.  I said as much and the bartender said \"I can get my manager.\"   Well, I'm not in the mood to go through their escalation process.  Instead, I let them have my money but they've lost a customer.", "author": "K C."}

The ambiance was fantastic when I visited - lively, full of energy, with very friendly and responsive staff. The restaurant is relatively upscale with prices to match, but this is definitely justified by the great food quality and setting.\n\nDuring my most recent visit, I ordered the Palak Chaat (delicious - comes with tamarind & yogurt chutney), vegetable samosa, and the kadhai paneer (cottage cheese with spices, peppers, tomatoes, and onions ... I believe it was stir fried). Both dishes were excellent - authentic and with very rich flavors - and went well with the naan and rice.\n\nI was a little disappointed that the menu did not correlate with the menus at sister Amber India restaurants in the South Bay (e.g., they do not offer Palak Paneer on menu - though perhaps they'd take off menu requests as well). Regardless, the menu at Amber India SF definitely holds its own.

When we go to the front, the hostess said we will have to pickup the stroller and bring it down the stairs. We were not happy about it but we said OK we will do that. Then she said, wait a minute we have an exit to the back side of the restaurant and you can bring the stroller from there so that you do not have to pick it up. We said Oh Great! That works.\n\nGuess, what they blocked off the fire exit by placing a table for 4 and there were guests seated on that table. They made them get up to get our stroller in. While the guests moved and we were trying to come in the Manager comes running says - NO you cannot do that you cannot come in from here. You have to come from the front. I said what sense does it make now that your guests are up you moved your table and chairs out, let us in. After a lot of argument he lets us in.\n\nOn our way back we asked him, so do you have a handicap access which we can use to take the stroller out to the street and he shows us an elevator which was also blocked by a guest table and when the elevator opens up, guess what! It was used as a storage room. It was full of chairs and other crap. He had to move all those things out for us to use it. It is absolutely ridiculous! \n\nThere were two problems with this:\n\n1. THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT A TABLE at THE FIRE EXIT and block it.\n2. THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED To use elevator as storage!!!\n\nAfter all this, if I were the manager of the restaurant, I will apologize to my guests for any inconvenience and ask them how the lunch was but obviously he did not do any of that and he had this attitude and was avoiding us.\n\nI went upto this arrogant manager and said I would like to talk to your boss and I hear from him that his boss is out of town and will contact me.

The shank is braised for 6 hours and is incredibly tender - falling right off the bone. Our server warned us of the spiciness of the dish which was perfect, if just bordering on bearable. The Kozhi Melagu offers just as much flavor but with less spice - a black pepper chicken in a curry leaf, fennel, and onion sauce. A side of naan bread, basmati rice, and some cold cucumber yogurt to contrast the intense flavors were the perfect complements to our entrees.\n\nThey have a good wine list and inventive cocktails.

Or, opentable should flash a big message on the screen warning that we will receive 0 points. \n\nThe food was okay, but too expensive for what it was.  There are many alternatives where you pay less and can have the same kind of tasting food.  After multiple attempts to resolve this issue with opentable, I will never go back.

The food was just superb. The naan breads were to die for and the curry do creamy and yummy. The place is on the pricy side of other indian restaurants, it's more towards \"fancy Resturant prices\" however, I think the interior is more of a casual Resturant so maybe a bit pricy but damn it's good food. We paid 400$ for 4 people for newyears, which isnt too bad, wine included, that being said, if you go to a smaller Indian Resturant like little Delhi on Eddie st. which is my other favorite Indian in San Francisco, it's a fraction of the price and in my opinion just as good food. That being said, I would go back in a heartbeat because the food really is  simply amazing.\nThis leaves me a little torn whether to give 4 or 5 stars, deciding on 4 only based on the slightly higher prices.. like i said.. the food is absolutely amazing.\nit's a must try in my opinion.", "author": "Adam O."}

Price was about 2X more than what I am used to paying for similar spreads, elsewhere, but this was downtown SF, after all. If you are accustomed to paying for meals at Spruce, then this will not seem expensive.\nThe restaurant itself was clean and bustling with staff, but they still managed NOT to refill my water glass, when it was empty. One very nice distinguishing feature was that they had a bowl of fresh Thai chili peppers on the buffet, which I appreciated. There was a Saag dish with large pieces of potato, which was very disappointing - the greens had little or no spinach and were underspiced and watery. The dish of carrots and peas was good and the cauliflower dish was good. There was also an OK dish with paneer. I can't recall the sauce they used with it. They offered entrees of Tandoori chicken and butter chicken [chicken Makhani], there was a dish with some sort of lamb or goat chunks that did not appeal to me, and a dish with well-prepared fish fillets, not drenched in any sauce, which I enjoyed. There was some sort of dessert that looked like a chocolate brownie [I passed] and an orangish-colored dessert that seemed to be sugar crystals with some sort of sticky vegetable-derived substance on it  [I passed].

They had an extensive wine and cocktail list, and the prices were reasonable (though the print on the drink menus could be larger!).\n\nMy only 'negatives' are that the vegetarian menu is limited and the rice was plain and not very tasty.

To me if you visit a restaurant in which the cuisine is highly regarded by the people who know what good food is supposed to taste like than you have discovered a gem- too often you visit places that just try too hard, Amber is not one of those knockoffs. It is the real thing. \n\n2. Something expected and unexpected: We of course had the butter chicken, which was mouthwatering... I would recommend it for people who don't even like curry- it had a very unique combination of a mild spice followed by a mint aftertaste so it basically counterbalanced. HOWEVER.....we absolutely LOVED the Kashmiri Roganjosh which is a Lamb delicacy from the Kashmir valley with saffron, ginger & fennel seeds. We have never had lamb so tender and Delicious. No fat, gristle or rubbery texture here! \n\n3. They served our favorite that wasn't on the menu. I love Channa Masala (garbanzo cooked in Punjabi style) but to my disappointment it wasn't on the menu. I mentioned this to our server, she said no problem and out came the best we had ever tasted. \n\n4. The service was fantastic.... it was busy but we called at the last minute and they got us in- no wait. We had 8 pm tix to see Wicked and were of course running behind- no problem- not only did they bring our food hot and fast but it was clearly made to order and included a speciality dish. \n\nBottom line is that we loved it sooo much we decided to pack up our leftovers to go- which we never would have done before going to the theater- and walked/jogged the 5 blocks back to the car (in 4 inch heels) just to make sure we could have it for dinner tonight- when we discovered that the car valet had left (another story) we smuggled it into the theater, good thing it want crowded and the containers were sealed!

Some of the dishes are too oily, which is common with Indian and Pakistani food that I've had around the bay area. For the prices they charge, I would expect all the dishes to be on the better side. \n\nAs for how they treated me: I walked in and was told to go to the lounge, as they serve dinner there. Even though I asked the waitress where to sit, so therefore she knew I was there, she did not help me. All night. She spent quite a while talking to the very nicely dressed couple in front of me, and another couple to the side of me, and another couple who came in right behind me, as well as a group who came in after me. She did come over to ask a perfunctory, \"How is everything?\" while I was eating, but she did not bring me water, give me a menu, take my order, serve my food, or bring me the bill. Thank goodness the bartender did all this; he even refilled my water after I'd drunk it while waiting for fifteen minutes for someone to take my order. How do I know it was fifteen minutes? The time stamp on text messages I replied to while waiting to be helped. The waitress also took forever to take my credit card after I put it in the book, stood up the book, laid the book flat, and opened and closed it once or twice in the hopes that she would notice. It's not that they were so busy, as evidenced by the fact that she had time to lean and chitchat with the nicely dressed couple again. So when I realized after I'd left that the name on the receipt was a female name and not male, I called to ask that my tip be given to the bartender, as he was the one who had helped me all night. The response the woman on the phone gave me was, \"I talked to the manager and he says he's not going to discuss this with you again. But the bartender will get his tip.\" Um, what kind of a response is that? Especially when the manager did not talk to me directly. If I owned a restaurant and my employees had ignored a guest that way, I would at least have gotten on the phone myself and apologized. It occurred to me that maybe the person who answered the phone was the waitress herself. But since I wrote the restaurant a letter about it and they haven't bothered to reply, I take it that they do not value my business.

This Amber has lived up to these expectations on two (dinner) occasions).  \n\nLunch, however, is a completely different experience. It's chaotic. It's super casual, which is fine, but that's NOT an excuse for Amber to dial things down on their end. The service has been inexcusably terrible on the last two lunchtime trips (on weekends nonetheless). We spent way too much effort looking for waiters to fill our water glasses, bringing us naan (it arrived 30 minutes after we started the buffet), and paying the bill.", "author": "Lissa T."}

I sat in the bar - it was not packed at all, very pleasant. \n\nTo start, per recommendation of a Yelper, I had the Cauliflower Bezule - good, varying flavors and textures.  I was delighted with my entree, the Badam Bhara Baingan - braised baby eggplants.  It was warm with a crunch from the almonds and a kick from the spices. The tomato sauce played nice with spoonfuls of basmati rice. I ordered the Chocolate Molten Cake to go - not sweet and it had a taste I couldn't figure out (I guess it was the spice), okay but I don't think I would order it again. \n\nOverall, very happy with my meal and service.", "author": "Cristina B."}

Unlike most Indian restaurants where there were 5 of us and we would order like 3 or 4 dishes, at Amber, we ordered 5 dishes and ate every last bit as the portions aren't out of control, which I do like. But they are like $20 a dish, so even for the portion, it was a little much for me. The service was very quick! So it's good if you are starving, which we were. \n\nOne thing I would recommend is the not-ice cream for desert.

However ...\n\nThe downside is that the service was really slow, which made me thankful that we were only waiting for drinks (and later, the check) instead of food because otherwise we might have died of starvation.  It could be that they just want you to be sure of your requests.  If that's the case, be warned that you have to feel strongly enough to ask three times.\n\nFrom the bait and switch file: It was also slightly off-putting that the sign at the door promises a lavish Indian buffet for $16.95 while the bill sneaks in an additional $3 per person just because it happens to be Sunday.  \n\nSo to end on a positive note: go hungry.

Once we were seated I realized just how large the restaurant is.  There were so many tables that I was a bit concerned when I saw how small the buffet was.  More importantly I was concerned when I saw how many hungry looking people were standing in line holding empty plates.  Crowds aside, I found Amber adequate but probably not worth the $16 price tag.  \n\nThere was a cold crispy rice salad that was pretty tasty and some smoked salmon that just seemed out of place.  About 4-5 curry selections, my favorite being the one with the chick peas and the lentils.  The fried potato fritter was tasty, but made me miss having some sort of pakora.  The catfish was delicious and moist, which is impressive since it has to sit out on a hot plate.  The biggest disappointment is the naan - NOT good.  It is really more like a store bought pita than a hot crispy naan.  My guess is that this is not made in house because it was neither hot, nor particularly fresh.  While bread does not seem like a big deal, when you are paying $16 I kind of expect fresh delicious bread.  Not sure I would return for the lunch buffet.", "author": "Dana H."}

For two dishes and an appetizer, diet coke and iced tea (re: NO ALCOHOL) the bill was over $70!  I checked the bill twice and it was no hallucination.

It's long been my view that this is the most appropriate way to deliver Indian food, and at Amber India it's well done.  Great butter and tandoori chicken, as well as a good mix of vegetable dishes, Indian appetizers and chutneys.  It's presented well too - certainly well enough that you could take a client or a discerning friend along with confidence.\n\nBut still it's not quite right.  The service, while discreet and friendly is a bit patchy.  The hostess looked flustered, empty plates sat on the table for too long and the coffee that we ordered was simply revolting (but our server seemed to be struggling with it so we let it go).  The food is good, but hardly worth the lofty scores Zagat lavishes on it - and by the way, many of the most anomalous scores to be observed in that guide in cities the world over tend to be awarded to South Asian cuisine.  Beware!  Amber India is a reliable, good quality Indian restaurant in agreeable surrounds, but there are many, many better dining experiences to be had in this town.", "author": "Dom B."}

We get the shrimp appetizer (very light, but SOOOO delicious, I could drink that sauce!), I get the tandoor chicken that isn't marinated in yogurt, just spices, and ask for the sindhi murg sauce (its a tomato based sauce, SOOO delicious!) on the side. We share basmati rice, boyfriend gets the butter chicken, and we share garlic naan and chili naan without butter. My mouth waters just dreaming about it. Everything tastes so fresh and wonderful. When we go to the buffet we love trying their veggies like the curried broccoli, the mushrooms in the tangy red sauce, and the potatoes that are perfectly seasoned.

I've been walking past Amber for the past year, waiting for it to open.  The decor is quite swanky, especially the lounge/bar area.  The dining room booths are comfortable, but the tables in the center are pretty close together.  A nearby patron brought this to the attention of a manager, as one of her dining companions was continuously bumped as the numerous waitstaff brought us our courses.  \n\nThe only beer on draft tonight was Pilsner Urquell.  The sommelier/spirits advisor mentioned that they would soon have a hefewisen on tap.  Luckily for us patrons, the Blue Moon keg would not fit in his fridge.  We are saved from Coors' poor imitation in favor of a hefe from New Belgium, a much more reputable brewery.  For any of you Brits, they do have a Pimms drink.  I was recently exposed to this tasty drink from a British collegue.  If you want a refreshing drink with fruit and cucumbers (!?!?), try it.  \n\nWe ordered the Aloo Peas Samosa for an appetizer.  These were savory, but quite small.  They were served with tamarind sauce, but missing the ubiquitous mint chutney.  While my samosas were warm, I would prefer them to be served at a higher temperature.  \n\nFor the main dishes, we ordered their famous Butter Chicken and the Paneer Tikka Lal Mirch.  The Butter Chicken definitely lived up to its reputation.  Deeeelicious.  The Paneer was also good; the chili spices gave the cheese a nice kick.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the apricot kulfi and Joe had a Chai tea.  I was told the Chai was flavorful.  The kulfi was served in a unique cone shape and was a perfect ending to the meal.  One of the bussers confirmed the deliciousness of the dessert :-)\n\nThe waitstaff was accommodating when they were at the table, but our waiter was absent for long periods of the time.  I think he told another table that they were short two waitstaff.  But for the opening day, it was pretty smooth.  I've definitely witnessed worse.  The bussers were very attentive to clearing plates and our waters were always promptly refilled.  \n\nThe food was good.  The atmosphere was nice.  The waitstaff was diligent.  So why three stars?

My friend and I sat at the bar, which has some pretty cool lighting going on. I can see this becoming a place to grab an expensive cocktail for the conference goers and tourists that are in town, it's got a good location and the drinks were pretty stiff.\n\nIt was around 11pm when our drinks arrived and the place was pretty empty. My Manhattan was pretty good although it was a bit on the pricey side, considering there are other options nearby. When we first sat down there was no music but some did come on towards the end of our visit, hopefully they'll keep the music going since it did make the place feel less sterile. We were informed that they'll be having a DJ on certain nights in the near future, it'll be interesting to see how that might impact the ambiance of the restaurant which is definitely within earshot.\n\nThe service was definitely better than my last visit but we were asked rather directly to tell our friends about the place, I tend to prefer when restaurants/bars just focus on a good product and service rather than trying to pitch me on promoting their establishment.\n\nI'm still hesitant to go back here for dinner due to the terrible service we received last time. I ate at Osha last night and it was just the polar opposite of Amber in terms of service...our water glasses were never empty, we got our meal promptly, etc. etc.\n\nI hope Amber gets better but after two trips it's just not making the cut for it to become a regular haunt of mine.", "author": "Bryan B."}

Ever since my last trip and going to Amber in Santana Row, I have been looking forward to come to this new location on my next trip up.  Last time I was up here was April to May this year and I was literally standing there saying... \"Open Open Open!\" like those Mervyn's commercial.  \n\nBefore I start my full review, this place only get 1 to 1.5 stars at most for food and 1 extra star only because service here was pretty good.\n\nFinally they opened a few months ago and we needed to grub around the mall since it was getting late.  We were seated immediately.  The decor of this locations is much more hip and chic than the one in Santana Row, but I prefer the decor of the one in Santana Row because of their starry ceiling.  It's a little too red for me at the bar and the dining space was too crowded.  The servers kept bumping into my sister or the table, which gets points deducted.\n\nI have decided that their appetizers are not very good overall in either location.  We had the fried sun-dried tomato and goat cheese appetizer that barely had any cheese.  It was very heavily flavored but lacking.  I told my sister I really wanted this appetizer because how can you say No to FRIED CHEESE! ^_^ Boy was I let down.  Then the server highly highly recommended the shrimp appetizer that is specially prepared in banana leaves with coconut, cashew, almonds, and more as a sauce.  We thought this was a little better than the other appetizer but not by much.  The flavor was so-so but nothing that blew my mind away.\n\nFor our entree we both wanted the Frontier Lamb.  It's what really made the whole meal last time and why I gave them a highly coveted 5 stars for the other location despite horrible service.  I was SOOOOO DISAPPOINTED! My sister's lamb came out decent, half flavorful and half dry... the one they set in front of me was SCORCHED! BLECH! All the pieces had no meat and was burnt to a charcoal crust.  I wanted to send it back, but they said to keep it and they will make me 2 more pieces.  DUDE! The dish was not even that edible.  They should have given me a whole new order! Boo!\n\nSo began the debate... what's more important... the taste of food or service?  Of course both really matter, but at the end of the day ... the Taste is what's most important! I mean why do we pay for good service if the food sucks?  Of course in a perfect world we could have both being spectacular, but that rarely happens.  The people who worked at this location are MUCH NICER than the one on Santana Row, but the food was not tasty at all! If I ever go back, it will be to the Santana Row location despite questionable service.  \n\nTo give an even better idea of how bad the lamb was... I couldn't even eat it! My quote came from the title of my post on the Santana Row location... my new one that I will write soon will have to be... Mary's Lamb Died in Vain! The rack of lamb was almost burned beyond recognition.  =*(", "author": "Kat L."}

Curries were yummy, not overbearing, lots of spices--the food is prepared well and presented beautifully for a buffet. They have a pretty good selection, things I particularily liked were the catfish, lamb curry, potato fritters, and kidney bean cake. oOoO they had a spinach and mushroom thing too. The only thing I didn't like was the lemonade--this place is kind of healthy so it tasted like lentil seed was in the lemonade or something. I tried the Kesari Rasmalai dessert (soft poached homemade cheese dumpling in saffron flavored light milk syrup) it tasted weirdd like spongy! I like weird tho so alls good. They have buffet from 1130-230 on weekdays so you can def. find time to squeeze in. \n\nService: Service was friendly and they left you alone to eat (a plus, I hate when waiters keep bugging you to \"service\" you). When we asked for bread the second time, the girl took kind of long and we finished it without it by the time we came. Ohwell. \n\nAmbience: A very classy place, upstairs there is a lounge/bar area that is beautifully lit (more so probably at night) its away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. A nice place for a business lunch or with friends. Id be depressed if i came here by myself  :'(", "author": "Amy S."}

Went with the butter chicken, tandoori ajwaini salmon, and some regular naan.  All were phenomenal.  The mango sauce was absolutely perfect for the salmon and if you like salmon, it's a must-try.  \n\nAt $20 per most entrees it seems pricey for Indian, which is probably why most are going 4-stars here.

Simple and a little herby, and absolutely tender as can be. If you think you don't like lamb, you haven't tried these. The chutneys were fantastic as well. 5 stars. \n\nEveryone orders the butter chicken, because it has always rocked. I have to give it 4 stars though because the chicken wasn't cut carefully and I got 2 nasty pieces of gristle/bone in my gravy. As a reformed vegetarian, this ruins my whole week.  \n\nThe Amber Dal is really delicious 5 stars, and the paneer dish was tasty, but had a very thai/chinese flavor because of the bell peppers so 3 stars on that (well prepared, just not my personal fave). \n\nRasmalai, hard to go wrong, and they were even able to leave off the pistachios, which I am allergic to. The dumpling wasn't quite as tender as some other places, but it was still delicious. 4 stars.\n\nWine and sommelier, 5 stars. Great choices that were reasonably priced by SF standards.

Sauce didn't stand out.\n- Palak ke Kofte ($14.95) -  spinach dumplings filled with cranberry and almond.

Served with tasty yogurt raita with little walnut pieces.\n- Asparagus Cauliflower Balchao ($14.95) - greatly lacking in cauliflower, the sauce was more tart.\n- Bombay Bohri Biryrani ($20.95) - large chunks of chicken flavored the rice with spices. Tasty but wished for more rice given the price of this side dish.\n- Bread Basket ($11.95) - Mutter Kulcha (filled with peas and potato), Lacha Paratha (made with whole wheat), Naan - I've had better breads that were bigger and fluffier.\n- Pappad ($2.75) - Lentil crepes that serve as chips for picking up sauces. Typically free in other restaurants.\n\nHonestly biggest beef (pun intended) with Amber is the price. Food was good but really could get the same flavors in places a third of the cost.

We ordered Badam Bhara Baingan (baby eggplants), Arbi ke Kofte (Taro dumplings), garlic chive naan and regular naan.  The Badam Bahara Baingan was simply devine; the flavors were intense, leaving a nice kick at the end.  I would come back for this dish alone.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-10", "description": "Sorry for the belated review. Went here with 3 friends who were new to Indian food. I wanted to sample another North Indian restaurant in the city.\n\nLocation: it was a rainy Saturday, so I was glad I got to BART in to Montgomery or Powell. It is easy to pass by, but it's near the ROSS. Tip for GPS users: don't input the address, as it may give you Yerba Buena Island.\n\nDecor: very nice, the bar area was very suave and chill. Had a nice TV to show college football. The red decor is very romantic, so great for couples. The seats were very comfortable, although you have to go downstairs. \n\nService: the servers were friendly and got us seated right away. They explained the dishes and made great suggestions.\n\nThe food: the entrees were great. We started with the standard appetizer fare: pappad and samosas. The samosas were smaller than normal, which actually is good since it doesn't kill your appetite before entree-time. I ordered the tandoori chicken(half). Pretty above average taste for the chicken, but didn't stand out in particular. Even though it came out sizzling from the oven, it didn't have as much zing even with the lemon and peppers. \n\nI noticed more seafood items than normal, and vegetarian items which are both pluses in my book. I actually prefer the latter while my friends really liked the salmon tikka and sea bass. We ordered the Bombay Bohri Biryani, which was a tasty chicken & rice dish(really tasted the saffron in that). Top that off with naan and the meal was complete.\n\nOverall: I would give this place a higher mark, but I thought for the pricey dishes, the quality wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Having said that, the restaurant is great for a date or intimate dinner. Great service, and I really like the location if you're spending a nite in the city near Embarcadero/SOMA. There is a good variety of seafood, chicken, and vegetarian dishes for you to try and/or bring family/friends. However, if you wanted to introduce someone to North Indian food that's not too pricey, I'd probably go to Roti or Maharani.", "author": "Neil N."}

The chef does a great job at balancing spice without overwhelming the underlying meat and vegetables. \n\nWent there on a Saturday night with a group of 8 - this place is great for group dinners since Indian food is usually eaten family style so its both economical and fun to try different dishes.\n\nFood - 4 stars. We started with the pesto and goat cheese tikkis (3 stars), paneer appetizer (4 stars) and mixed grill (4 stars). Their tandoor (aka barbeque stuff) is consistently good so I recommend it.  For dinner, we tried the daal (heavy on cream so 3 stars), butter chicken (5 stars), kadahi paneer (4 stars), mixed vegetable (2 stars - unappetizing) and Shalgam Nalli (5 stars). The rotis are better value and better tasting that the naan so go for the rotis. The cocktails were great but I was disappointed not to be able to sample the wine list. \n\nService - 2 stars. Very disappointing for an supposedly upscale restaurant. Server didn't show up for 20 minutes after being seated and only after we had to ask the hostess to send the server to get our drink orders. The food showed up pretty quickly but the service was unimpressive. Server was efficient but did not offer any recommendations or help with the menu. Post dinner, it was another 20 minute wait for the check. Clouded an otherwise enjoyable experience. \n\nAmbiance - 4 stars. Modern with comfortable seating. Noise level is appropriate.

It seemed like everything on the menu was her favorite.  And she kinda went overboard about everything.  Like, instead of asking what kind of naan we wanted (plain), she proceeded to list all six naan options.  But I guess it's not just what she said, but how it was delivered.  Like a newly minted Bennigan's waitress.  (And I used to wait at Bennigan's so I KNOW).\n\nThe food was disappointing.  While the shrimp salad was fantastic, the butter chicken just wasn't the same (the \"same\" being the most amazing dish on the planet served at Amber India - Mountain View).  The vegetable korma lacked taste as well.  And both my date and I left with stomach aches.  \n\nOverall, is it the worst Indian food around?  Nah.

I went for the buffet but it looked like lots of friend and gravied bits of nothing substantial. What happened to the good buffet items? Instead I ordered three appetizers tat looked somewhat South Indian, off f the dinner menu.\nAmbience is its strongest point. However the menu has reversed from South Indian to 95% Punjabi, and the quality of the South Indian dishes has taken a nosedive. If the chef can't do them well, PLEASE do us all a favor and remove them.\nMasala mixes are tasteless and seem to be several days old; the Malabar shrimp was tasteless. Curried crab appetizer was fairly good - seemed cooked to order. But not a single freshly cooked curry leaf in sight. Instead I got a vague nutty taste of popped whole mustard seeds and spices, but not nearly as fresh tasting as it should be if the vaghar was also cooked to order.\nLamb kebabs were overworked dish. Ironically the lamb itself was very good. The yellow cold stuff \"dill sour cream\" tasted like pimento cheese - why even include it? It didnt go withthe lamb. The mint sauce and tamarind sauce also didnt go with the \"masala\" lamb. Very off.

(I didn't realize why they were nervous until I read the reviews of their opening night.)  So it looks like they've quickly pulled things together in the first couple days.\n\nThe food was delicious, making no compromises on ingredients.  The butter chicken was excellent, though not as heavenly as I remember it in Mountain View (or perhaps that's just nostalgia?).  The fish kebab was delicate and smooth, and the chicken biryani was more substantial/filling.\n\nThe bar area is upscale-loungey and separate from the dining area, perhaps a good nightlife launching point.  The cocktails were tasty (try the bertolli(?)) and the bartender introduced himself to us, bubbling over with enthusiasm, which was a little odd.\n\nThe only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the price.  This might be the best Indian food in the city (I haven't tried enough places yet to judge), but you can easily pay half as much for something almost as good nearby.  Fortunately, I was being treated to dinner this time.", "author": "Michael M."}

Although we  thoroughly enjoyed the dinner our waiter \"Alldrin\" was so very inattentive I could only leave the \"Busboy, Chris\" a tip. With my name being in the computer from having eaten there so many times, I have never had such bad service. I was really annoyed by the manager having to poke in our dish to see if it was chicken or fish. At those prices one should know what the customer has ordered and not have to have their dish prodded to make out what it was. I will think about driving to Santana Row's Amber next time or at least make sure that \"Belinda\" our usual waitress is serving us for the meal.", "author": "Brenda S."}

They're open till 3 for lunch, which is a big plus for me, as I'm usually not ready for lunch until at least 2, which means there are lots of places I simply never connect with. Went this afternoon expecting to order off the menu, but they had a buffet that looked good and offered a chance to graze through a lot of different dishes. I usually avoid buffet anything like the plague, but I'd had the buffet at their San Jose location and it didn't suffer from the usual congealed buffet mediocrity, plus I was curious to try a number of items and at their high prices it would be expensive to sample so many dishes otherwise.\n\nSo I did the buffet--$23--and came away stuffed to the gills and very pleased with the food. Everything I tried--at least a dozen items--was carefully and thoughtfully prepared from high quality ingredients. Portions actually on offer on the buffet are small to ensure that they're refreshed often. As you would expect, items made from--ugh--chicken breast are too dry, but only the worst food puritans go for the white meat, so I can't really blame Amber India. Nevertheless, the buffet warned me off of those dishes before I spent $20+ on an entree order.\n\nEven though it was a buffet service was quite attentive--another benefit of lunching late. The decor is generic modern upscale with a pleasant but slightly sterile ambiance a bit better suited to a business lunch than a meal with an intimate.\n\nThe buffet is all-you-can-eat and with food of this quality it's possible to do some serious damage, so come when you're hungry and the price won't seem quite so exorbitant.\n\nUPDATE: the last time I went they changed their lunch hours and now close at 2:30 weekdays. Major bummer! But they're still open till 3 for lunch on weekends.", "author": "Bambooo S."}

We had one appetizer, bowl of tandoori naan, the butter chicken and the sea bass curry. 3 glasses of wine + 4 vodka cranberries(we were on vacation), bill was about $140. Great food but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. Maybe it's because I'm from san diego and there are a ton of indian and middle eastern places here that are just as good and much more inexpensive. But Amber had an excellent atmosphere, convenient location and very friendly hostesses. We walked in here without reservations at 630 on a saturday night and the wait was 25 minutes. We had tried the Tropisueno mexican kitchen a few doors down first, but they kind of scoffed that we didn't have reservations and said the wait was 50 minutes, so this was definitely refreshing to be greeted so nicely at Amber. Our server was very attentive but very quiet. The lounge area was packed and yes you do see quite a few Indian people here which is a great sign.", "author": "Elika E."}

Got a reservation on OpenTable quite easily.  As soon as we came in, we were greeted warmly by a gentleman who seated us at a nice booth. The decor of this place is great for any restaurant, it is definitely outstanding for an Indian one. The drinks menu looked extensive; they had a very good wine selection as well. The food menu was an interesting mix of what we usually expect from an Indian place but also had some new dishes and variations on traditional cuisine that looked very \"gourmet\" style.\n\nDeciding to eat vegetarian today, we had:\nPaneer Manchurian appetizer: It was more like a Paneer chilli, but quite delicious.\nKadhai Paneer: Very well done onion-tomato based gravy and the paneer pieces were perfectly soft and delicious.\nVegetable Elaichi Korma: Highlight of our meal. The Elaichi (cardamom?) flavor was distinctly mouth-watering and satisfying in each bite.\nNaan and Saffron Rice: Good quality.\nCouple of diet sodas.\n\nThe service we received was way above what we expected, even at a nice restaurant such as this one. Everyone serving us was polite and attentive. We had requested spicy entrees, and when we thought our entrees were too spicy, they were very happy to replace our entire meal. The server even got us an appetizer \"on the house\" while we were waiting for our milder entrees to be prepared.\n\nThe price of the food we had was quite reasonable. Our bill for the table including an appetizer, two entrees, naan, rice and two sodas was only $55 including tax. \n\nThis place compares to the food, service and ambiance you get dining in a 5-star hotel in India. So far I have eaten at Pakwan, Aslam, Roti Indian Bistro, Little Delhi, New Delhi, Mehfil and Chaat Cafe here in San Francisco and this place beats them all hands down.\n \nOverall, we left the place feeling great about the whole experience and will highly recommend it to all yelpers.", "author": "A C."}

So, we thought let's try Amber India as it was so close to the mall. We entered the restaurant and were greeted really politely by one older gentlemen. He gave us a really nice, romantic corner seat. The ambiance of this place was amazing! Our server, Maggi, was super friendly came and took our order: Paneer Manchuran, Kadhai Paneer, Vegetable Korma, Naan and saffron rice. We asked them to make food our a little more spicy than a medium. \n\nBut when our food came, we had a couple of bites but it was way too spicy! We couldn't handle the heat and asked our server to replace it if possible. She was very apologetic and changed it right away. She got us Diet Coke and Raita (Yoghurt) and was trying to do everything for us to neutralize the heat. Moreover, while the chef were making our new food, he sent us some spinach chaat to nibble on as well which was delicious!\n\nWithin 5-8 minutes, our food arrived, guess what? They not only got us the entrees that were spicy but also got us new rice and naan. We had our fresh dinner again!\n\nNow the food, you cannot get a better North Indian Food in this city!

It's the most upscale Indian place I've ever been to outside of India or London.  If you like Indian food, then you have to go, period.\n\nAmber's original location in Mountain View is fantastic, one of the two or three best Indian restaurants in the Bay, if not the best.  The San Jose location is very upscale, and great in its own way.  I waited on bated breath when I heard that it was coming to SF, and waited, and then waited some more.  Finally, when it opened, I visited half a dozen times, and have been back a few times since.\n\nAt least here in the US, Indian food has been largely relegated to \"cheap\" food status, the home of $10 buffet or $20 meal.  Amber definitely isn't that kind of place--I don't think I've ever spent more for Indian food in the US than here.  The new location is absolutely beautiful, and every detail, from the lights to the thick carpeting, has been done with luxury in mind.  The food, as always, is amazing.  So why only 4 stars?  Well, if my wife and I are going to drop $200 for food and a bottle of wine, I expect something transcendent.

We also ordered chili thyme naan and lacha paratha.\n\nSo, the duck was amazing.  Super tender, and the sauce it came with we both wanted to eat with a spoon.  I don't know how they got it so tender and delicious, but I would recommend this dish to anyone who eats duck.  Both of the lamb dishes were also amazing.  Quite spicy and not dumbed down for American people, like many of the Indian restaurants I've been too.  The spice and the flavors were so close to the food I had in India, I was in heaven.  After one bite, my boyfriend said we were going back there again!  Both the breads were quite tasty, but I prefer paratha to naan in general.  \n\nAs they bring the dessert menus, I mention that if they have Galub Jamun, we're getting it.  I fell in love with them when I was in Kolkata, and since the dinner was fantastic, I was sure that they were going to do a great job of them as well.  Since they are indeed on the dessert menu, I ordered it.  There were two of them, which let both of us have a nice bite at the end of the meal, and he had never had them before.  He just loved it!  I did too.\n\nWe're definitely going back to this place.  The food was just amazing.  If you're a big fan of authentic Indian food, this is the place to go.  It is a bit spendy though, so there may be places that are also good, but not quite as expensive.  I've yet to find them though.", "author": "Grant T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-25", "description": "First off let me say that the Amber India restaurant, hands down, is run by the most insulting and incompetent management staff I have ever encountered in any restaurant in my 34 years! We ate there last night, the food was overpriced for what it was, and I wonder about the secret ingredients that found their way into our food. More importantly, I question managements ethics.\n\nInitially when our food came out, 2 members out of our party of 5 had HAIR in their meals. I passed the hair to my friends who confirmed it was what I thought it was (It was squiggly, lightly colored, thin in nature, and definitely human). Normally I wouldn't make a big deal out of this sort of thing--We have all experienced this at one time or another-- however when the waiter came around, I gave it to him and expressed my displeasure. About 10 minutes later the manager returned and asked me \"So this is what you found in your food? You see it is a fiber, so you are okay.\" That didn't explain the hair in my buddies food which was a foot long, and what's more hilarious is that what the manager presented to us, looked like something he had just plucked out of his sport coat. Even my friend sitting across the table could see that this fiber couldn't be any more dissimilar from what I handed to the waiter - it was short, dark, and very rigid. When I told the manager this, he simply flipped the fiber over and said \"What about now?\". Jerk.\n\nI can't emphasize this enough, if the manager had simply come out and apologized, perhaps even offered a desert or some other small concession, we would have been fine. Instead he chose to insult our intelligence and try to cover things up. \n\nMy gut feeling is that if you have someone at the helm of your restaurant disguising health and safety issues, do you really want to entrust them with your food? Think about that the next time you are considering Indian food in SF. Avoid this place if possible.", "author": "Ryan H."}

When I got there, I tasted their amber rose drink and decided against it and got the other amber drink.

And since it's been 20 mins since my friends ordered our food, we decided to ask her how much longer it'd take.  In response, she said, \"I don't know how long it takes for appetizers.\"  She didn't even offer to check or come back to tell us!  Finally, my friends went to the manager and asked about our food because we only had 15 mins before the movie started.  The manager came by and apologized and told us that our food was delivered to the table NEXT to us!

This *does* effect my review ;)\n\nThe bar: the Manhattan I ordered was STRONG. Less sweetness than I usually expect. (I'm not complaining, though. It was goood.)\n\nThe restaurant: They seated all ten of us in the back room across the entire restaurant from the bar. I can not complain about the service in this place at ALL. They were completely attentive and catered to everything that we needed. (Although I did order a cocktail that I never received...might it have been canceled out by the multiple bottles of wine ordered at our table?

They were very open to any questions. Each and every server was ultra-friendly. \n\nWe had a plethora of appetizers, entrees, and desserts at our table, so I got to try a rainbow of food. The samosas were good - nothing stark-raving amazing, but good. Not as spicy as the traditional home-made samosas I have tried in the past. I ordered the Sun Dried Tomato & Goat cheese Tikki appetizer, which kinda seemed like fancy Indian fried cheese sticks...but trust me: delicious. I had a bite of the AMAZING Sweet Potato Salad (and the presentation for this particular salad was super-impressive). We also had an Amber Mixed Grill, which was meat, and the only meat I eat is fish. I can assure you: the tiger shrimp on this platter was super-fly. ;)\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Tandoor Grilled Shrimps. When the platter was brought out, I guess I was shocked at how...little was on it. For $23.95, I would just expect more.....food. They were, however, absolutely tasty...and since I was eating off of other platters on the table, I didn't even have the ability to finish my food. \n\nOther things I tried: garlic na'an was phenomenal. The Saufiyani Baingan looked super-meaty, but the spicing was great. The Mushroom and Baby corn Teen Saag was my favorite. The spinach in it was flavored perfectly. Without a doubt, my favorite thing that night. Even the carnivores devoured it.\n\nDessert happened...though I still wonder how. The Gulab Jamun was surprising good. (The dumplings were the right consistency and there was a perfect amount of syrup to cover them. Someone made the comment that you eat one of the two dumplings, and it's like eating a whole meal.) I was not, in any way, a fan of the \"Thandai\" Spiced Cr\u00e8me Brulee. Too much Indian spice...not enough...good. Period. I also didn't expect the Chocolate & Mango Lassi Cake to taste so...unique. I wish there had been more chocolate involved, but I guess that's not very traditional, now is it? \n\nI guess the wine made us a little loud. They shut the glass doors to our room later on, but I thought it was great that they had the space to do it. The privacy was nice!\n\nOverall, great experience. The waitress didn't even blink when I made the unique request to bag up any leftover vegetarian or fish dishes left on the plate. I walked away with a super-random sampling of rices, na'an, and three different dishes, in a cutesy-little white bag. \n\nI'd probably have fainted if I picked up the check, though.

The banquettes are quite comfortable.  Give me a booth any day.  \n\nWe ordered the okra which was absolutely delicious.  I really liked the combination of smokey onion, gooey okra and garlic.  We also tried a different chicken curry (murg something) which was okay.  I'd definitely stick with the butter chicken next time.  We tried the 6 hours braised lamb shank which was supposed to be hot.  It registered a quite tingle on my tongue initially but the heat did build after consuming more.  The server told us it was a 7 on the hot scale but I thought it was a four at best.  However, the lamb meat was so tender.  I liked that I got to feel a bit cave-womany with the huge shank bone on my plate.  \n\nI know it was quite pricey for \"ethnic\" food standards but I have enough leftovers for lunch today!", "author": "Monica L."}

With that, I ended up in Amber - India.  Well, it would have been walking distance but my excellent tour guide Hazel was a little hazy on where to go...get it...I made a funny.  Anyway...  \n\nAtmosphere - dark, fancy, clean, modern, very cool bar/ lounge area, friendly\n\nFood - This week I was letting the Yelp app decide for me as to what to pick off a menu.  Therefore, I opted for the well-reviewed butter chicken, as it was mentioned 116 times (now 117) in Yelp reviews.  I assume all positive.  It should tell you that...yes?  When my Butter Chicken arrived, the dish consisted of nicely cut, tender pieces of Tandoori chicken in a red sauce w/ a side of rice for the table.  I requested medium spice and the dish was almost too spicy but delicious nonetheless.  On a future visit, I may go less spicy to take in the flavors of the sauce.  For bread, I ordered the Bread Basket, which consisted of Mutter Kulcha, Lacha Paratha, and Naan.  The Mutter Kulcha was my least favor of the three as there was too much of a taste of potato...if that makes any sense to you.  To wash down this flavorful meal I had the Mango Lassi, which was good but the added salt was something I was not accustomed to in my Lassi.  Note - Lassi is a great drink but it will make you thirstier.  Make sure to have water nearby or you can end up drinking 10 lassi without blinking an eye. \n\nService - The service here was great.  Everyone made you feel welcome, staff members seemed to put great effort into accommodating you, and ensuring your visit to their restaurant was a pleasant one.\n\nPrice - a little pricier than other places in the area but reasonable for the quality and quantity you receive, especially in downtown SF. \n\nOverall - Despite having that 311 song ringing in my head as I write this review, I will definitely visit this place again.  Next time I may try one of their desserts or hang out in their inviting lounge.  As this place will...\" take me away from the norm\".", "author": "Eric D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-26", "description": "I've been meaning to check this place out for a while, and I finally did last weekend for dinner- definitely not disappointed.   Started out with some cocktails, of course and some pretty inventive options- all pretty tasty, but on the pricey side.  I don't eat much meat, so then followed with several veggie appetizers that we all shared.  My favorite appetizer was probably the pesto and goat cheese tikki- very tasty and also had a great dipping sauce- I believe it came with 5 pieces.  The paneer tikka lal mirch was also quite good.  I've had paneer tikka in a lot of different ways, so it's hard to find a unique take on it, but Amber really did a good job here.  \n\nNext were the entrees.  The star of the show for me was undoubtedly the butter chicken- amazingly good.  I usually find butter chicken a little too creamy, but they really made it well flavored without being too heavy.  The baluchi chicken tikka was also quite good- just know that it's a non-curry chicken dish.   The dal amber and aloo asparagus were good vegetarian entree choices.   \n\nThe main complaint I had about the restaurant would have to be the prices- averaging about $20 per dish, definitely adds up to a steep bill by the time you're done.  But, overall, a great dining experience.  The restaurant is in a great location, right near the Four Seasons and also has a great bar area to grab a drink while waiting for a table.  The decor and ambiance is also welcoming and a fun place to come with a group.  Friendly, helpful wait staff too- we ended up having to change the number in our party about a million times, and they were very accommodating each time.   So, a great choice for an upscale North Indian restaurant in the city, if you don't mind dropping a pretty penny on a night out.", "author": "Urmi P."}

I have many friends who swear by it, but something about the smell of curry and spices when you even walk near an Indian restaurant that never really appealed to me.  It's the kind of smell that lingers.\n\nI remember when I was in college, I went to look at an apartment, The \nadd claimed it was newly remodeled and carpeted and painted.  Upon getting up to the stairwell landing, no one needed to tell me that an Indian family had lived there.  The strong smell of curry and other spices was permanently engraved in the fixtures despite the new carpets, and paint coating.  I digress.\n\nMy wife recommended this place because of a recent write up she read in the newspaper.  I agreed to go as I had nothing better to do and we had absolutely no food at home to eat.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I was amazed by the decoration and fixtures.  Very clean and sleek.  The bar area was lit up like a Christmas tree.  I could not wait to indulge in its offerings.\n\nHowever, the distinct smell of Indian cuisine permeated the air.  Luckily, it was not powerfully pungent or overwhelming.  it was more of a warm welcoming smell of good food being cooked here.\n\nOur waitress, a cute, well mannered and pleasant host  delighted my wife and I with her interpretations of the menu.  Her recommendations were strong and highly considered but we did not venture too deep our first time around.  We played it safe and went with the signature dishes The Butter Chicken and the rack of lamb accompanied with Dal Amber and Saffron Pulao.  All delicious and excellent choices.\n\nFor our appetizers, we began with the Duck Tinka Kebab, the Smoked Sweet Potato Salad and our waitress accidentally brought out Aloo Peas Samosa.  She left it for us to enjoy at no charge since we had not ordered it.  \n\nOverall, I overcame my prejudice of Indian food and gained a whole new dining perspective.  I was very pleased with my experience, the service and most important, the food.  \n\nI will definitely revisit this place in the future!", "author": "Javier O."}

My friends and I were attending a cocktail reception in SOMA, so we decided to have dinner at Amber afterward.  \n\nI had heard rave reviews about their butter chicken from my colleagues, and it did not disappoint.  We devoured the butter chicken and its amazing sauce!  We also tried the Paneer tikka, the Malabari tiger shrimp, tandoori chicken and garlic naan.  Everything was delicious!  Although the food at Amber is much more expensive than the Indian restaurants in the Tenderloin, the amazing food and beautiful ambiance completely justifies the price difference.\n\nThe only reason I can't give Amber the five-star rating it deserves for the quality of food was the level of service.  Our server completely messed up our bill and had no idea what we ordered, so I had to name all of the dishes we ordered for her to redo the bill.  After waiting for the corrected bill for 20 minutes, the server overcharged my friend's credit card by $50, so we waited again for her to correct the charge.  \n\nSince I absolutely loved the food at Amber, I still plan to return, but I'll wait a bit before my next visit in hope that they improve their service.", "author": "Kimberly J."}

I started out with a bit of salad, Veggie Korma, Saag Paneer, and some Butter Chicken.  The first thing I noticed was that everything was piping hot, which is not always true for a buffet.  Secondly everything was flavored really well with some good spice.  The Butter Chicken was definitely my favorite, rich, tomato-y,and flavorful it packed a bigger punch than a typical Silicon Valley buffet.  The only part I did not care for was the Naan, which I found to be a bit stiff, chewy, and lacked the character that I like in my Naan.  Overall for 16.95 it is well worth the money.  You'll walk out full and satisfied.  I know I'll be back!", "author": "Stephanie T."}

This place is quite fancy and spacious, while the food matched the decor.  My date and I shared the butternut squash soup, butter chicken, chicken tandoori, rice, and naan.  The soup was delicious, as was the tandoori chicken which arrived on a sizzling hot plate with two sauces, a slightly spicy green and slightly sweet red.  We indulged the butter chicken that was smothered in a rich tomato sauce, which didn't go to waste as long as we had naan and rice to soak it up with.  This was a nice treat, since my date and I often dine at much lower budget Indian spots, where the food seems more greasy.  Next time I'm here I will try the cocktails!", "author": "Linda P."}

Great happy hour atmosphere and beer is only $3.  I quite like the very well marinated spicy chicken wings that comes with a very rich accompaniment of lots of onions and yellow bell peppers.  A well-portioned appetizer at a good price of $5.  The chicken wings are small though but  I guess it's the way it is for happy hour.  I also tried that dish that comes with mint sauce.  I wish I remember what it's called but I cannot right now.

The food is Indian with a modern take on it. The appetizers were particularly creative. Definitely try the seafood while you're there. The only thing that really put me off was the fact that waiters (who were otherwise good) were really pushy at the end of the meal with the check. They came by 3 times to see if we had put a card/cash down yet or not. And came back within 15 seconds with the receipt for signature. I can understand such haste if the restaurant is very busy and it is a peak time but the guests had mostly left and it was almost 1130pm at this point on a Thursday night.

Also, the restaurant was big, seemed like it could hold a lot of people.\n\nBut it did feel kinda strange that the place was pretty empty overall, I felt like virtually the whole restaurant staff was waiting on us that night (Saturday!?!).

I was able to send an email and make reservations the day before (they got back to me the same morning).  There were a few available tables when we got there, but most of the tables were taken.  The ambiance was great, and the service was wonderful (our water glasses and wine glasses were always full, the staff checked on us, etc.)\n\nWe had the sun dried tomato/goat cheese and the smoked sweet potato salad to start.  Both were great, and the sauces that accompanied them were tasty (one was minty and the other sweet and sour).  They accommodated me and made me chicken tikka masala even though it wasn't on the menu (I asked how the butter chicken was compared to chicken tikka masala, and the waiter said they could make me tikka masala--my favorite!!).  The food was all great, and paired great with the Riesling.  The one downside is it's on the pricey side, though that could be because other than Dosa, I haven't been to more upscale Indian restaurants.  I've generally been to places like Naan N' Curry, where you'd get the same types of food (though not as tasty or clean) for a fraction of the cost.

But the food we had at Amber really knocked my socks off.  \nWe started with the duck kebabs: moist and flavorful, not at all greasy. Then we had tandoori stuffed potato: potato Shells hollowed out and stuffed with nuts, veggies and delicious spices.  We also had the butter chicken. It was super-rich (actually, everything we had kind of fit that description, so I wouldn't come here if you're looking for a light meal), creamy, well-spiced, tender, and, well...buttery.  Enough adjectives? The tamarind sauce actually tasted like tamarind instead of just sugar syrup the way it often does, and the mint chutney was simply delicious! I felt like I could taste the spices in everything in a really amazing way, and everything had just the right amount of heat.  Even the naan and the rice were a cut above!\nThe atmosphere was romantic (we were in the side room in a corner, so it was more quiet than the rest of the restaurant), the service was attentive and friendly w/o being obsequious.\nMy waistline and my wallet probably couldn't withstand frequent visits, but I can't wait to go back!", "author": "J W."}

They were kind enough to accommodate us immediately despite our being 30 minutes late to our Open Table reservation. The food options were a very eclectic choice. Most were based on a typical Indian dish (North Indian for most part with a few exceptions) but they often had a unique twist. It made it hard to choose  one item to eat. We went with the Malabari shrimp curry as an app which was full of flavor with a strong spice that didn't overpower the flavor but you definitely noticed by the end. For my meal I had an excellent Lamb Korma. The meat was very tender and the curry was similar to the shrimp - lots of great flavor and a variety of spices you could taste but the heat was complimentary and not overpowering. The only exception to our meal was my companion's order of a Tandoori Four Chili  Sea Bass. The fish was very well cooked and juicy from the yogurt based marinade but it did not have any chili flavor let alone 4 chilies. We even asked the waitress if we had gotten the wrong dish but she insisted it was not.

One of the principles laid down by management was, \"...never mislead the guest, especially about how long they will have to wait for a table.\"  \n\nUnfortunately our experience at this restaurant got off on the wrong foot.   We arrived on a Friday night, expecting there to be a wait for a table.  (Read the last sentence carefully, we expected to have to wait for a table!)   When queried as to the length of the wait, the hostess responded, \"no more than 20 minutes tops.\"  Based on this assurance that the wait would be brief, we grabbed a table in the lounge and ordered a drink.  Carried away with the good company of our group, we didn't notice that 45 minutes had elapsed.  I marched off to the hostess stand and asked for our table.  We waited another 15 minutes before being seated.  I relayed my displeasure with the long wait  to the hostess by asking her to reference when we were placed on the waiting list.  We were displeased with our handling but not because we had to wait.   No, no. no, we were displeased because the amount of time that we had to wait was far beyond what was promised.  \n\nIn all fairness, the restaurant responded perfectly.  The manager came to our table, and expressed his sorrow that the wait time provided to us was inaccurate.  \n\nThe complimentary appetizers were excellent.  For the three of us we ordered two entrees and rice and shared them family style.  Good move.  It was a lot of food.  The quality was very good.  The spices did not overpower the entrees.   I can't recall the name of the dish, but there is a shrimp appetizer which comes in a dark sauce.  This was so very, very good.  If you go here, ask for this appetizer if you can't discern it from the menu.  \n\nWe skipped dessert.  All in all we had a pleasant and enjoyable experience.  We were especially thankful that the ambiance did not include cheesy Indian music playing in the background.  Instead, you can expect a modern dining room with subdued lighting and full of conversant, full of life clientele.

The lamb was ridiculously tender, and the tandoori chicken was cooked to perfection. We also tried the butternut squash soup, which had just about the most interesting combination of spices I've tasted in a long time, and the crabcake, which was a well-designed balance of flavors. The only place where Amber might improve is in the energy of the staff -- while they are all very friendly and attentive, there is a bit too much of a California-casual vibe for a place of this quality. That said, I still give it five stars because the food was so damn good.", "author": "Tal R."}

Oh and why do some Indian restaurants include rice automatically and some make you order? Anyway, the chicken tikka masala was good, garlic naan too.

I have eaten here a number of times each time the service was good. We ate here on a Saturday evening, I had made reservations, when we arrived, the guy/ Mgr at door said no such name on his computer, I even recognized his voice from my call. I asked him to look again despite his stressing, no reservation. Then  he said yes it's here. When I asked how come he didn't see it earlier, he snapped at me that \" youre 3 mins early\"!!  To be fair it was a busy night for them but to have attitude for no reason speaks to the level of unprofessionalism that is the norm in most Indian restaurants. This was no different. We were finally seated in an area which was in the walkway in front of a pillar and high traffic for servers. I requested a different table, there was one empty in next booth. The woman who took us to the table snapped \" it will be another half hour to 45 mets\" again I was taken aback at the expression and attitude. In fairness the mgr did say it wouldn't be that long. We ended up sitting and eating at bar and when our table was ready and she came to tell us I kindly told her we were ok where we were, which again garnered an irritated glare. I thought I was helping them since I was already seated and this would allow others waiting to get a table sooner. A bad experience to say the least. The food was \" meh\". I will avoid this restaurant in the future. I am sure they don't care. And that's the point here. They don't care.....", "author": "G P."}

I am FAR from an Indian food expert, because until recently I never lived in a place that had much good Indian food.  But, I like Indian food a lot and I LOVE Amber.  I've been for weekday lunch, weekend brunch and once for dinner.  The best deal as far as I can figure is the $12 weekday lunch buffet, if for no other reason than you can sample just about everything.   It seems to always include the butter chicken (yes, it is that good as others have said), two other meat dishes, at least one fish dish, three or four vegetablees, the paneer, chick pea dumplings, several salads and dessert.  Yes, I know there are $6 lunch buffets all over but they aren't this.  A beautiful, elegant setting, a very extensive buffet selection, highly professional service and truly fantastic food... not typically found for $12, let alone $6.  So, back to my original point.. I don't claim to be an Indian cuisine aficianado.  So, I asked my apparently Indian and apparently honest server (after confirming that he was, indeed, from India), \"So tell me, is this really good Indian food?  Because I think it's great, but I don't know what's considered great by Indian standards.\"  His response, \"It's very good.  There's other places you could find more exotic authentic dishes but the food here is very good by Indian standards.  It is one of the four best in the area.\"    He went on to tell me that of the four, one is in the East Bay, one is on the Peninsula (so I promptly forgot their names since I don't frequent these areas), and the fourth is Dosa on Fillmore.  He cautioned me againest Dosa in the Mission, but said Dosa on Fillmore is where Indians love to eat... as well as Amber.  I believe him.", "author": "Michelle L."}

High quality, although yes, possibly not the most authentic (its sort of a fusion tailored to a western palate, I believe), but definitely delicious.  Tried the Shrimp Moilee and Butter Chicken and its recommended.  I think there is a further opportunity to improve upon it and make it a little lighter and healthier in terms of the sauces and hence only 4 stars.  Also perhaps more innovative if its not meant to be completely authentic fare\n\nThe service was excellent and our waitress and table staff were very attentive, polite and did a great job.\n\nThe one aspect of the restaurant I did not appreciate was the lighting..  The spot lighting around the periphery of the restaurant space was garish and quite uncomfortable.  Direct lighting in a restaurant is NOT a good idea.  I provided the feedback but was not sure if the restaurant was quite as receptive toward it.  Although the general ambiance is good, there is more opportunity to improve the ambiance in the restaurant with the lighting and make it a more pleasing dining experience given the higher dining price than your regular neighborhood Indian restaurant.", "author": "Leroy R."}

It looked so cool inside.\n\nI haven't been this disappointed since the Milli Vanilli scandal broke.  In 1990.  When I was 7.\n\nI arrived about 10 minutes behind the rest of the group.  I walked in and started making my way to the back of the restaurant but was stalled because I couldn't figure out how I was supposed to get there: the only immediately obvious route (you know, the one that goes like, from where you're standing to where you want to go) - was blocked by people sitting at tables.  But no, it turns out you are actually /supposed to/ squeeze between those peoples' chairs to get to the back of the restaurant.  Okay...sure.  Whatever.  Sorry to the guy I tapped on the head with my messenger bag.\n\nI sat down.  They had water, but nothing else.  The drink guy came along shortly and took our drink orders.\n\nThen we waited.\n\nDrinks arrived maybe 10 minutes later, short one - quickly fixed.  Whatever...okay, sure, opening night, get your act together, cool.  Oddly, though, no one seemed to want to take our food order.  I mean, they like /really/ didn't want to hear it.  I started the timer on my watch.  At about 10 minutes, we asked the water guy if we could order.  Mind you this is 10 minutes on my watch, which is like -10 for the rest of the group.  So we'll call it about +20 minutes, we asked the water guy if we could order.  Sure, he says.  But oddly no one came to get our orders.  Then the drink guy returned (he had introduced himself as the sommelier, more or less), and we asked /him/ if we could order.  Sure, he says.  But oddly, again, no one arrived.  So really, the most obvious interpretation of this is that they just really didn't want to take our order.  Maybe they were ordered out.  Maybe they were just confused on the first night of business.  But really...just take the order.  You don't even have to make the food, but come on, at least take the order.\n\nAt any rate, another 15 minutes passes as this is going on.  Finally I stood up, walked into the other room, and /touched/ someone who had just come from another table taking an order, and told her we would really like to order.  She snapped to attention and took our orders immediately.\n\nThen we waited.\n\nAt T+55 minutes, most of our food splashed down, including our appetizer.  The bowl of rice took another 5 minutes.  The *rice* came 5 minutes after the rest of the meal.  What, did you run out of rice?  Do you not have enough rice-making capacity to produce sufficient quantities of rice with 5 groups eating in your massive restaurant?  You could've started making the rice when we walked in and had it ready to go.  You had 55 minutes to make the rice.  I'm just sayin.\n\nAs for the food - the butter chicken (also known, more or less, as chicken tikka masala) was neither here nor there.  The actual sauce was really well prepared, very creamy, well spiced - but the first two pieces of chicken I ate caused me to ask my foodmates if I had been served \"off the gristle end of the chicken,\" and the large piece of meat in the middle of dish which I expected to really enjoy turned out to be decently overcooked.\n\nSo basically, guys...get it together.  For serious.\n\nAlso, as Cody C. pointed out to me...their web gallery (http://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amber-india.com%2FSanFrancisco%2F%3Fgallery%2301) is just stock photos from the OS X wallpaper collection.  really?", "author": "Oliver N."}

It certainly looks fancy with its marble floors, upstairs full bar, marble staircase leading down to a marble foyer where there was a buffet set up. The dining room also looks fancy. It has large booths on either side and tables in the middle. Perhaps it's the size of the furniture rather than the number of tables, but it seems overcrowded and you have to carefully walk between them to get to the nicely set up private room at the back. It has glass doors that were opened to make the dining room larger, but seems like a nice spot for a private gathering for around 25.\n\nOur hostess was very nice and we were greeted by our waiter almost immediately. I wanted to order a la carte because no Indian lunch buffets (I know of) are ever hot enough for me to enjoy, but the prices of the entrees made it clear that the $20 buffet was the way to go. The food looked good, certainly smelled good and there was a nice variety of dishes. We were told naan would be brought to our table, which took a good 10 minutes after we got back to our seats. The naan was just alright for me - I like it thick and bready, but this is the more thin airy variety. The food was, as I fully expected, not spicy, but it was flavorful, well prepared and, except for some fatty lamb, had great texture. I particularly liked the saag, which had cherry tomatoes and some excellent paneer.  The Indian rice pudding and fruit desert was very nice. Probably my favorite part of the meal.\n\nIf the folks last night felt ignored, I felt almost inundated by the service as new people kept coming by the check on us. I got the feeling that either they had nothing else to do since it was so empty (at 12:30pm) or they were genuinely worried we weren't OK. Although the naan took 10 minutes, everyone was at least responsive when we mentioned it - yeah, I said everyone. We thought it was a little odd, so we decided to look up the reviews from last night; I was amused by how bad they were compared to our current experience. Ah, the wonders of modern technology. About this time, some manager type person (who later ID'd himself as Eric's infamous Mr. Slicky McPinstripe Pants) came over to check on us and made a comment about Aaron's Yelp shirt. We talked about Yelp for a sec and that our friends had been there the night before. This guy seemed super eager to please us, but it bothers me when staff pulls the Yelp card because I don't know if they're doing it because they're scared of us or because they want to be nice or because the service is genuinely helpful and attentive. Anyhow, I did appreciate that when we commented that the food wasn't spicy enough, he had the chef make us a tomato chili chutny to liven up our food. It made a nice addition to the dishes and I actually got some spicy into my lunch. \n\nBeing a tiny girl, buffets aren't really my thing, and although I'd love to try Amber for dinner to see how I like its spicy dishes, the entree prices make that unlikely in the near future. There are so many amazingly good, cheap Indian places in SF that either proximity or the need for a nice restaurant will have to bring me back. I'll definitely make the effort in a couple months when they're into the swing of things. I've also got my eye on the back room for a private happy hour or something.", "author": "Kristina A."}

The other dishes were excellent too, such as the pepper crab (fresh crab!), black cod, tandoori chicken, etc...  All of the ingredients were fresh and I didn't feel greasy/heavy despite eating so much food.  Most of the people there seemed to be celebrating a special occasion, so it's not your everyday haunt.  The restaurant itself is fancy and big.  You can dress up if you'd like or go casual, but it looked like most people were dressed up a little.  There is also a separate bar area where you can order small plates and a happy hour that lasts until 7pm.

The first thing I read when I investigate Amber is the equivalent of a Yelp gang bang, how disgusting.  I too would like to go to restaurants across the globe on opening night and expect to be treated like more than a guinea pig...but that would be stupid of me because life in restaurants doesn't work that way, or don't you know, oh my, you don't!  The day any of you give levity to your self aggrandizing remarks with any kind of restaurant experience, other than being a GUEST, I might actually not do what I'm about to do.\nFirst off, why go to a restaurant that has an expensive menu and then knock off stars for it being expensive?  If you're a cheap bastard go to cheap places, otherwise you're just an asshole looking for something to complain about.\nThis review is personal, you have insulted the very soul of the reason Americans are becoming more willing to try Indian food.\nA brief history lesson:\nAmber Mountain View was the first and will remain the most authentic of the Amber franchise.\nAmber Santana Row came next, it was Amber's first attempt at fusion, they have been wildly successful regardless of your thankless rants.\nAmber Cafe is a less successful, mutated version of simple Amber fare with no flare, only name.\nAmber Union Square is the latest incarnation of an extremely vibrant and continuously evolving concept that Indian food can appeal to anyone.  \nAmber India is the only Indian restaurant I have ever known that has deviated from typical Indian cuisine yet remained at the very pinnacle of excellence in food preparation, presentation and delivery.   In my own circle alone, every human being I have dragged into an Amber has left with an appreciation and understanding of Indian food that can't be grasped by the inexperienced in an afternoon buffet at your typical Indian restaurant.  Why?  Because the chefs at Amber strive to make their food palpable to a larger crowd than the food savvy, world traveled, adventurous tongue, like my parents, for example.  \nAmber Union Square is not Amber Mountain View or any other typical Indian restaurant and you do yourself, as well as the menu, a great disservice in expecting that it will be.  How will you ever know the joys of Dal Amber when you are still expecting a simple black or yellow Dal?  What about the succulence of salmon soaked in mint chutney and then seared lightly to bring out both the flavour of the chutney and the incredible consistency of perfectly cooked seafood?  And the butter chicken, like children in a daze, I have watched hordes practically fall into their bronzed bowls, fainting in anticipation.  Oh, the naan, well, anyone who has ever had it cooked for them by an Indian mother knows that it ought to be light and slightly thin, it means its fresh cooked where as the thick, doughy variety is frozen and reheated, most likely not on the tandoor, or did you just think that was a type of chicken...\nEssentially, I've read, that Amber is too much for you, your pockets, your mouths, your ability to stay seated and be consumed in the amazing act of breaking naan with another, impressed more with an unusual experience than your ability to malign it with ignorance.", "author": "Madame A."}

(Blah blah inconsequential chatter, end of review.)\" That's basically 82% of the reviews on Yelp.\n\nWho are these people. There are a lot of things you can derive from Joe Public reviews like a sense of what the place looks like, anecdotal service experiences, crowd, what's on the menu, without building up a degree of trust in that semi-anonymous person's judgement. But taste? How do I know there's any accounting for Darcy McHorninerd's taste in Indian food?\n\nUsually I can disqualify people based on their profession of love for chicken tikka masala.. but really that's unfair, it's like disqualifying Italian reviews based on how much the reviewer loves for spaghetti with meatballs. And spaghetti with meatballs can be pretty good sometimes.\n\nThere were a lot of review like this on this place after it first opened, so I didn't quite know what to expect other than it has a good reputation down on the peninsula and is ridiculously expensive. \n\nWell, I'm happy to say that even after stepping off a plane after two weeks in India and dining with a native South Asian chick, this place was pretty solid for both of us. Probably the best North Indian food we've had in the city. (I still like Dosa for southern.) Let me break it down -- some people think of Indian food like they think of Mexican, they actually prefer it greasy and cheap and uninventive, as if that's \"authentic\". This is not such a place and if you're that type there's no way you should come within 50 feet or you will die laughing at the prices. But if you're willing to pay $22 for a biryani (even I'm cracking a smirk as I write that), what you'll get is nicely spiced with a good amount of masala and some moisture retained in the rice and meat. Whereas some use oil to compensate for dry, overdone biryanis, this one was cooked right. A cut above what I've come to expect here.\n\nAlso enjoyed the drink list.. had a nice glass of Chinon.

My wife's Indian and the Mountain View Amber India catered our wedding, so we feel like we know what the food should taste like.  \n\nFirst off, the location and the decor are great.  It's a very sheik, polished, and upscale atmosphere.\n\nBUT... we have problems when:\n-  All of the waiters and waitresses are non-Indian (our waitress didn't know any of the Indian names for any of the dishes)\n-  Many of the classic North Indian dishes we're familiar with weren't on the menu\n-  Dishes were 5-10 dollars more for the exact same dish at Amber India Mountain View\n-  We found chunks of cartilage in our chicken curry\n-  Our water was served to us with no ice.  When we asked for ice they brought us a glass and we had to spoon in the pieces ourselves (if we were paying 10-15 bucks a dish, that'd be no problem, but if I'm paying almost $30 a dish, I expect high end service)\n-  The drink menu was a poorly made xerox copy with the left hand side cut off\n-   No wine list was available and not all of the wines described by the waitress were actually available\n-  Food was WAY under spiced.  We actually asked that our food be made spicy and instead we received very bland curries\n-  Samosas were small and not very flavorful.  The mini-samosas looked nice, but just didn't taste that great (they weren't exactly hot either)\n\nOther than the things I already mentioned, service was okay.\n\nUnlike the Amber India in Mountain View, there were very few Indian patrons and the place just didn't feel or taste very authentic.  The place felt pretentious.  The Amber India chefs are good, but by trying to please the SF tourists they are losing the real flavors and character.\n\nNot to pile on, but there are also some problems with their website.\n\nIt's sad, we were so hoping to have a good, nice Indian place in SF.  \n\nIf you're looking for good cheap Indian food and don't mind a place with no atmosphere or decor, check out Shalimar on Polk Street.\n\nIf you want a little bit more of a nice dining experience, and don't mind a bit of a drive, head down to Mountain View and eat at Amber India Mountain View (even the Santana Row restaurant was better than the SF one).", "author": "Damian S."}

Luckily expectations held and we had a wonderful lunch here.\n\nWe decided on eating the lunch buffet versus ordering a la carte because really, its hard to turn down a buffet.  Start off with Amber India's version of a samosa- the taste is the same, but the presentation ups your enjoyment of it.  I noticed that some of the items from the buffet don't necessarily show up on their regular menu- for example, there was a deep-fried catfish fritters dish that was enjoyed by us all, but it isn't anywhere on the take-out menu.  Likewise, there was a lamb curry that was superb (in that I detected almost zero gaminess), but again, no mention of that dish in their menu.  It also seems like some of the other vegetarian dishes featured in the buffet line are unique to it- there was a cabbage dish with coconut that was lovely, another dish with garbanzo beans, a potato dish, a paneer with peppers dish, and yet another one with dal- all of which were well-seasoned.  \n\nAs for the meat dishes, I especially liked the butter chicken, which came with a deliciously rich sauce that was perfect with the rice and the naan.   I liked the balance of sweetness and tanginess in the sauce and the chicken was super tender.  A word about the naan- its super hot outta the oven and its crisp on the outside while fluffy on the inside.  Rather than leaving it steaming on the buffet line, each table gets their own basket.  The Baluchi chicken tikka- a boneless chicken leg- was tasty, but I missed the slight charring on the flesh that usually comes from being roasted in the tandoor oven.  \n\nWe managed to leave just enough room for dessert, which featured almond halwa and a variation of the rice pudding seen at other Indian buffets.  The halwa, which is like a super-thick almond paste, is  really sweet, but perfect when slathered onto the naan.  The rice pudding was made with a thin vermicelli instead of the standard rice and it was very good- the cardamon wasn't too strong and the vermicelli added a different texture.\n\nNow the food was great, but we also appreciated the elegant surroundings and the attentive wait staff who always kept our water glasses full, our plates cleared, and the naan coming.  At $16.95 per person, the lunch buffet is certainly pricier than other places I've been, but everyone in my party thought it was well worth it.", "author": "Angela H."}

However it seemed a little pricey which kind of pushed it down my list for a while. Also I believe that the upscale restaurants, specially indian ones tend to \"tone down\" the flavors. With Indian food I expect a lot of flavors and some spice. We finally ended up going there for an occasion and were definitely not disappointed.\n\nFor starters we had wine, and I must say they have a very impressive wine collection. We had the malabari shrimp which was exquisite. The highlight for the evening for me were the lamb chops. I would give this a 10 star rating if it existed. The lamb was cooked just perfect the flavors were just perfect. I can still feel the taste in my mouth... yum yum. I would go back to amber just for the lamb chops.\n\nOther than that we ordered a black pepper chicken dish which had a sweet flavor to it, not too much too my liking and also a rogangosh which was nice. The service I would give a 2-3 star not the best. But the food is definitely worth the trip.", "author": "Ash O."}

As Indian cuisine is typically vegetarian, it was amazing how the chef combined different meats with different Indian spices. Our waitress was so helpful in aiding us on choosing the right dishes. The paneers and salmon were incredible. It's pricey for an Indian restaurant, but WELL worth it. I'd love to try more of their dishes... maybe one at a time because they are HEAVY! Not a place for picky eaters.", "author": "Rada I."}

There are Indian restaurants in the city with better food but the overall experience in Amber was very good. There aren't too many Indian restuarants that really go to town on the decor and that's where this place excels. It's flashy (literally) and reminded me a bit of a top end hotel. The service was friendly but not exactly speedy considering the number of diners on a Sunday night. So the food was above average but not fantastic.

As soon as I walked in, I saw how trendy it was inside and immediately was turned off. When we sat down and saw the menu and its crazy prices and random names for very basic dishes I was like \"great, this is gonna suck\". I went with a group of 4 girls, and we ordered, the butter chicken (standard dish that will say so much about an Indian place), Kadhai Paneer (Grilled Veggies and Cheese in a tomato base sauce), Wild Mushroom Teen Saag (Mushrooms in Spinach base). We asked for it to be medium spicy, since we had some non-spicy fans.....The food comes out and we take a bite and are blown away with it. I was in shock at how spicy the butter chicken was....It was spicy yet so flavorful! I was a very happy camper. The Kadhai Paneer was also amazing. The dishes each seemed to incorporate different spices from different regions of India. I didn't care too much for the Mushroom Saag as I don't really like Mushrooms, but others in my party did. The Spinach part was really tasty though. Overall, I was mostly impressed that the food wasn't typical heavy Punjabi style. I didn't leave feeling like I inhaled loads of cream and oil. Instead, I went back to my hotel, kicking myself for even talking bad about a place before I even tried the food. (I'm Indian, I can't help it) \nI would give this place 5 stars, but I take one off because of the price and customer service (not as attentive as I would have liked).

The decorations were modern and fine, the ambience was social, but the food--authentic. I brought my whole family here, and was pleasantly surprised by the less \"deep Indian\" feel to the place because it made my brother, sister, and dad more comfortable. Those three do not often eat Indian, or any ethnic food for that matter, and it was a good place for them to give more mild flavors a try. The three of them shared two orders of the fig and orange chicken tikka, and loved it. We also had a samosa appetizer that my brother and mom enjoyed, and the saffron pulao (flash fried spinach salad) which was crunchy yet fresh and delicious. She had the chili rubbed sea bass entree, which I tasted and did not like very much, though she seemed to enjoy it, and I tried the subj chettinad (vegetarian mixed vegetable curry), which was exquisite. It was the dish I ate the most of so I can rave about it most extensively. The flavor was what I would consider the heart of Indian cuisine--a perfect blend of typical herbs and spices, sweet and hot, thick and vegetable-y. In addition, we had plenty of roti and naan, each plain, pesto, and garlic, as well as rice. It was nice to find an Indian restaurant that offered the healthier brown rice in addition to the usual basmati white. The place also has a great location, among other nice shops, restaurants, and department stores. Within walking distance of all of my favorites (AllSaints, Saks, Juicy, Starbucks, Pink Berry, etc), it was the best place for a fun and enjoyable evening in Union Square. Highly recommend!!!", "author": "Alli T."}

However Osho's where we were originally going to was closed for lunch and so we decided to go here and see if Amber could redeem herself. And boy! she sure did!\n\nFirst off the ambiance was beautiful.Shades of red and orange greet you when you walk in and it set the mood for a perfectly enjoyable afternoon to come. We had the buffet ($17.00 per person). Here's some of my favorite dishes from it:: \n\n* Papri chaat & Pani Puri: Popular Indian snacks  containing dough wafers made from refined white flour and oil served with boiled potatoes, boiled chick peas, chillies, yogurt & tamarind chutney. Went back for third's! 5 out of 5 \n\n* Aloo Tikkis : spicy potato cutlets eaten with mint chutney- Delicious!! 4 out of 5 \n\n*Black Lentils simmered in cream : Perfectly cooked and my favourite dish at the buffet. 10 out of 5..(seriously it was that good!) \n\n* Kadai Panneer: Indian cottage cheese cooked with green bell peppers, fenugreek, bay leaves, cardamom & tomato. 4 out of 5 \n\n* Saffron Rice: I love long grained Basmati rice but I am not a big fan of saffron, yet I'm really glad I tried this. It was perfectly cooked with just a  very subtle hint of saffron. 4 out of 5 \n\nI didn't care too much for the chole (spicy garbanzo beans) or the peas in cashew sauce, but in all fairness I saw the other people going back for seconds on those, so it may have just been my personal taste. Hot naans are served fresh at the table and mimosas are included in the price! : ) \n\nOne suggestion for Amber is that they should have little placards with suggestions for what goes with what. If there were people who were'nt very familiar with Indian food they would not know for instance how to season the papri chaat (with yogurt, tamarind and mint chutney) and doing this may help them.\n\nFor desert there was chocolate orange mouse, payasam and sooji halwa. Oh and for all you Desi beer lovers- they have Kingfisher! \n\nA delightful way to spend a beautiful Sunday afternoon in the city.", "author": "Natasha J."}

I have been a fan of their original Mountain View location for some time and have also been to the slightly more upscale San Jose location (which has better ambiance but worse quality food I would argue). I went to the SF one for dinner and immediately noticed the even-more-upscale-than-San-Jose decor. It seemed like a high-class hotel restaurant with mirrors on the walls. However, not every customer seemed to dress according to the looks of the restaurant. I saw one guys in shorts with a baseball cap turned backwards...I feel like I wasted my time trying to dress better than usual for this place.\n\nBut really, it is about the food. Started with the Duck Tinka Kebab thanks to a recommendation from the waiter. It was just meh; it was weird to think it was duck when it reminded me more of chicken. It was edible but a little tough and boring. Sauces didn't do much to improve the flavor. For main course, I went with the butter chicken, Amber's signature dish. Butter chicken at the Mountain View location is one of my favorite individual dishes in my eating history! Flavorful but not overpowering, creamy but not rich. But at the San Francisco location, similar to the San Jose location's butter chicken, the sauce is more watery and spicy. And for 20.95 for the dish, the portions were rather small. \n\nI would say go to Amber India in SF if you must have that upscale environment or the assortment of cocktails (I myself tried the Bellota...tasted like a strong sparkling wine with strawberry pieces thrown in). The lunch buffet here might be better as I have found at Amber restaurants the quality in taste is the same, and you would get more variety and quantity of food.

It's been a long time since I've had to ask for a manager at a restaurant.  We ordered a dish for the kids and specifically asked for it to be mild as it was for the kids.  The dish comes out and it's so spicy that I'm actually sweating eating it (and I can take a lot of spice).  Kids can't eat it at all.  I call the waiter over and ask if this is as mild as it gets.  He said he asked the chef to make it mild.  He didn't apologize, offer to fix, etc., and I wasn't about to order another one if they couldn't make it any milder.  Then, 35 mins in to dinner, one of the dishes we ordered never arrived.  At that point, I called the manager over, explained the situation, and he offered to quickly make us another batch of the dish for our kids.  But at this point we were agitated and it was too late.  They did remove the dish from our bill without us having to ask, but the whole thing felt very amateur.  I think the server was probably new/inexperienced so I feel bad coming down hard on him, but you got the feeling that this place just didn't care much what kind of experience their guests actually have.  Note that the dishes are 2x+ what more casual Indian food costs ($20+ for butter chicken; $17 for saag paneer), which would be acceptable if the food were actually exceptionally tasty.  But this food did not taste any different or even as good as much cheaper/more casual Indian places around SF.  I would not recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Mae O."}

Upon entry, I noticed the  marble floors  and the eclectic character of the interior design and artwork.  Eventually I found the backround music to be eclectic also.  As other reviewers have noted, the restaurant could be described as pricey and the ambience would not suggest otherwize. The crowd inside on the day I was there, mainly consisted of  convention goers from nearby Moscone convention center. And I guess for those people on an expense account and on business it's not such a bad deal.\n  On the day I went, I was charged $19.95 for the weekend buffet per person.   I could describe the offerings as \"distinctive\".  Each had unique flavor, so the ten or so dishes being offered were all of unique flavor.  On the meat side,  I liked the tandoori chicken which were big pieces of chicken and not too dried out like I sometimes experience at other buffets.  I also like the simplicity of the lamb or chicken sheesh kebab. Another pleasant surprise was the mehti paneer which had pieces of cheese in their entirety. Many times in buffets the cheese winds up all melted and dissolved because of excessive heat but not this time.  I'll also say the butter chicken was good.  What I like to do is get some rice and put the butter chicken and sauce over the rice so the sauce soaks in.\nAnd you can try the mango mousse for dessert or alternatively fresh fruit.\nSo those are the facts.", "author": "Jerome W."}

((When you google map this place - they bring you to Daly City so be careful!))  Anyway, Amber India is a very chic and trendy Indian restaurant. I'm not the biggest fan of Indian food but this place wasn't half bad. We ordered family style so we were able to try a nice variety.  \nFor appetizers, we ordered shrimp, naan, and lamb skewers. The shrimp was very tasty especially if you're a fan of spice.  I don't eat lamb so I didn't try it.  I had their naan with the special \"yogurt\" it comes with.   Yum!   Their entrees weren't as memorable as I would have liked hence the three stars.   We ordered a variety of chickens and curry with rice.  They were all pretty good.  I would highly recommend the butter chicken.  The value is all right - a little on the pricier side.  The service was phenomenal!  We had a fabulous server: Karan!  He helped us take pictures all night long and he was good at it!  He knew more functions on my friends camera than she did.  He would help us take pictures in black and white and different angles.  At the end of the night, he comp'd us a bottle of champagne to toast my friends birthday.  \nIn the end, I consider it a pretty good restaurant since I would be willing to go back and bring new friends to try it.", "author": "Jess C."}

I actually attempted to yelp this right after I finished eating my meal, but sadly, the yelp app on the iPhone doesn't allow me to write reviews (they really should add that option in future updates).  \n\nAnyways onto the actual review!  My roomie J and I came here as an early bday dinner for me.  We were running a little late for our 8pm reservation so we phoned to let them know and they were perfectly a-ok with it.  Got to the restaurant and the first thing I noticed was the wonderful decor of the place - it is absolutely gorgeous!  We ordered the Butter Chicken, the tandoori salmon (forgot the name of the dish), garlic nann and rice.  The Butter Chicken is TO DIE FOR!  I will make future visits for that dish alone.  The salmon was simply ok, nothing really to write home about.  Nann and rice were nann and rice, but I would say Nann-N-Curry has better nann.  We also ordered the Chocolate Mango Lassi Cake for dessert and it was \"interesting\"  to say the least.  It was described to be a cheesecake, but turned out to be more like a 2-layer moose.  I'm still not sure how I feel about it yet.\n\nAlso for all you alcohol lovers out there, Amber has a very NICE bar with an impressive liquor and wine list.  I ordered the Belotta, which is an \"Indian Bellini\" and it was bubbly goodness =)  I was also surprised to see that they had the Vesper under their cocktails considering I've been to many bars that either didn't know what it was (I'm not sure how they passed bar tending school), or didn't know how to make it (sigh).  I will definitely check out the bar more next time.\n\nOverall I'd say it's more 3.5 stars but I'll bump it up to 4 for the Butter Chicken!", "author": "Carrie F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-16", "description": "So I had read the mostly good or great reviews and some of the very negative ones so I went in with an open mind. The occasion was the visit of an Indian gentleman from Canada, and my friend and I sought the opinion of some important thought leaders in the South Bay Indian-American community on where to take him in San Francisco. The answer was unequivocal: Amber. \n\nI started at the bar with a glass of the Riesling (from Germany), a 2007. The bartender had kindly warned me against the Gewurztraminer as being too sweet. But I was quite disappointed with the Riesling, itself being too  sweet, flabby, and lacking in complexity or interest. When she asked how I liked the Riesling I told her I was sorry I had not ordered the Belgian beer they had on draft. She quickly whisked away the Riesling and produced a glass of beer instead (at half the price). Very nice. When my companion arrived with the bottle of wine we planned to drink for dinner, a 2004 Riesling from McLaren Vale (Australia) we opened it to pour her some: huge difference (fine, dry, minerally, a bit of diesel on the nose at first - great with the food later). Their wine list by the bottle has a 2006 Australian Riesling, and I would recommend that with the food.\n\nFor dinner two of us had the prix fixe special. For $24 we got a spectacular salad of spinach lightly breaded with garam flour and fried, a choice of four entr\u00e9es, an herbed rice, tiny salad garnish, tamarind and mint sauces (which we already had with the papadam), and a kind of ice-cream dessert. Our vegetarian companion ordered the Jaipuri Bhindi (slivers of okra cooked with fennel seeds, tomato, and green mango) and the Kadhai Paneer (cottage cheese batons with coarsely crushed spices, stir fried with peppers, onion and tomato), plus a side of raita (thicker than I had ever seen before, which made it easy to eat). For our entr\u00e9es we chose one each of the signature butter chicken (shredded tandoori chicken in rich tomato sauce) and the lamb chop \"Frontier\" (Amber's signature recipe of rack of lamb - two double ribs - marinated in yogurt and garam masala, ordinarily $27.95 on its own). We also got some regular and garlic naan.\n\nThis was way too much food. The prices might be on the high side but we found the portions huge, and for less than $30 each of spectacular food we brought some home. Even though the prix-fixe meals were served on their own plates with rice and salad garnish, we put all the dishes in the center of the table and ate family-style. I must say, we were all taken by the flavorful food. The lamb was tender and with the mint chutney very nice. The butter chicken was delicious and not swimming in butter. The okra was fabulous, and plentiful. The two spinach salads were too much for the three of us, and the two ice-cream desserts (like tall hockey pucks already sliced with dabs of chocolate sauce in the corners) plenty for the three of us.\n\nService was friendly, helpful, and competent. The bartender kept our bottle of wine on ice at the bar until we finished our beers (roughly after our salads), at which point our server set up an ice bucket on the table. She refilled our wine glasses a couple of times and we refilled them on our own a couple of times when she was busy. The busboys kept our water glasses filled always.\n\nWe found the decor comfortable and sophisticated, with a nice edge in the bar. We did not need to raise our voices to converse but I don't recall overhearing anyone else's conversation either. The chairs are beautiful wood and leather and frankly a bit better for sitting back than sitting forward; they are also quite wide (which we were not).\n\nCompared to Mantra and Junnoon in Palo Alto I found the menu more traditional, though they do have some dishes they describe as Modern Indian. It had none of the feel of London's Bombay Brasserie and I think well reflected what Californians look for in a top Indian restaurant. My companion from the City is already planning to return.", "author": "Dan P."}

I've passed this place in the past on the way to the Metreon, but hadn't ever thought to go here for dinner. They've only been open for about four months or so I think. \n\nOverall the meal was okay/good -- not terrible nor the best I've ever had.\n\nWe started with the samosas which were great because they were served with some yummy sauces...much better than the type we grab at those fast food local Indian restaurants in the city, so we were optimistic from there.\n\nNext we had the duck kebabs -- I liked them to start, then perhaps due to the power of suggestion from my friend, I thought the accompanying sauce had a liver-like aftertaste. We ended up sending it back, but the waitress & one of the chefs (?) were very accomodating & offered a tasty mango chutney to go along with it but we ended up ordering another paneer (cheese) dish which was pretty good (again, compared to the same which I've ordered at the fast food places).\n\nFor our entree we had the specialty tomato-based butter chicken, which was very similar to chicken tikka masala in my book. I took some for leftovers & was slightly surprised to see the sauce had almost solidified, likely b/c it's butter based! (Don't order this dish if you have high cholesterol!)\n\nAnother entree we had was the lamb chops in the tandoori section, served on a sizzling platter The sizzle was mostly in the sound...the dish itself wasn't anything special. Plus the platter was so hot that the accompanying onions were burnt so we couldn't eat them.\n\nWe had rice & an interesting pesto naan (Italian-Indian). For dessert we had a chocolate/fruit mousse-like cake which wasn't bad.\n\nThe ambience & the service were GREAT. They went out of the way to make us happy. The tab was almost $100 for two people, a little steep for an Indian dinner.\n\nThis place has gotten mixed reviews, as mine is, so maybe give it a try yourself! Maybe go for drinks & order an appetizer for starters. It's a nice set-up in either case.", "author": "D L."}

They also don't disclose what they are exactly sending you when you are in a large group and how much it would cost, which is fine, whatever.

I also sent an email with a copy of my receipt, and a detailed message with my bill etc and I didn't get a single response back.

The waiter said it would be easy enough but about 25 minutes later he came out with a plate of 6 boiled shrimp and a side salad.  He apologized and said that's all they could do because they were busy.  And then they had the gall to charge $22 just for that plate.  It was ridiculous.  And our colleague was not even satisfied; she had to warm up some food from the fridge when we got back to the office.

I went with my family, and we ordered dishes for the table to share. I love Indian food, and Amber was easily the best Indian restaurant I've ever eaten at. Not only was the food great, the atmosphere and location was spectacular. Located right near Market St, it's in perfect walking distance of Union Square. Amber was a great restaurant all around, I would recomend it to anyone fond of Indian food.", "author": "Marie C."}

And its hard when the bar hardly fit the 3 of them. Then after finally ordering my TAJ MAHAL beer it took her like another 8 minutes to even find it in the fridge and it was obvious she didn't know where it was. So then we were seated and left with our menus and when i say LEFT i mean left. When we finally got someone's attention we were just trying to get water. If the service was better I would of gave it more stars and really the only reason Amber gets these stars is because the food is DELICIOUS! But there is plenty of competition out there with Indian Cuisine so to me SERVICE has to come with an establishment considering the price!", "author": "Brenda S."}

I will say the restaurant was very crowded and they were trying to seat a party of 45 who had made reservations, and had been waiting for 45 minutes for a table when we arrived at 8:30 - but the restaurant is large and should be able to handle the people it seats, or agrees to seat. Once we were seated the server was quick, we got our delicious appetizers very quickly - the fantastic Cualiflower with Coconut, Papadums, and this lightly fried spinach dish were very very tasty. We were excited to eat our entrees,  as we were starving. We continued to starve for another 45 minutes until they brought our either freezing COLD or steaming hot entrees. My lamb kebabs were in the same shape and size as dog poop, and some pieces were freezing cold, others room temperature. There were originally 4 pieces of this minced lamb dog poop kebab, and I took one off the plate and ate it. We told them it was cold. They returned with ..... 3 hot pieces. NO. The first order you brought me was WRONG, so you need to fix all of it. Not just the pieces that I didn't touch. All of it. Also, they took away the delicious spinach appetizer before we were done and when we asked for it back, the busboy said \"Sorry, no\" I guess once he'd taken it off the table, he couldn't put it back on the table? I was not impressed, but it seems like they were having an off night with the service. I would go back for cocktails and apps, not dinner.", "author": "C W."}

The food was really good and different from other indian restaurants for sure. I finally see what the hype over butter chicken is because it was the best i've ever had. The service was really nice and this is an extremely upscale restaurant. The only downside is that it is really expensive, been a while since I paid that much for indian food, i've gotten use to the chaat cafes and naan n' curries of the city. But this was definitely a nice change of pace. The food is definitely high on quality, ambiance is nice, and service was great. Nice selection of alcohol as well.", "author": "Vishal M."}

Yes it has eh spice but i find it to be too salty.  For lunch they have a pretty good buffet $20 bucks for all you can eat.  Good selection, I guess.  I dont know how to describe it besides its not your ordinary indian food that you would find at a Naan and Curry.  I'd say it has a contemporary twist that just doesn't really satisfy me.  I did enjoy their butter chicken and lemon tandoori chicken and fried catfish (which was kinda salty but wrapped in naan it evened it out.  I was kinda sad that the naan wasn't placed in the buffet.  Instead they have someone come around to drop off naan in our baskets.  Service isn't the best either our whole table was waiting for th waiter to come around to refill our drinks but it never happened.  Kinda disappointing to me since we were 1 of 5 groups that were in the restaurant at the time.  I dont think i will be coming back here anytime soon since its out of my budget.", "author": "Jenn Y."}

In my experience, this is rarely a good choice. The inside is beautiful (wish I had my camera). The staff was friendly, accomodating of our six-year old and very gracious. We are vegetarian so we sampled many of the vegetarian dishes and the samosas (which are a favorite of mine). The food was some of the best I have had. I am fairly picky about my Indian food...I don't like when it is greasy and gloppy and not delicate on the palate. It was fabulous. Very cool bar too!

My brother and I had dinner there before attending an Alonzo King Lines Ballet performance at the Center.  My brother had been for there lunch (nice buffet), so it was our first time for dinner, and we both agreed it was a repeat.  The interior is nicely decorated and provides a comfortable, yet elegant setting.  The service was very professional and friendly.  Our waiter was top notch.  He made recommendations without being prodded.  Maybe not everyone would appreciate that, but the more you eat out, its nice to run into wait staff that takes the job seriously and knows their stuff in regards to the different dishes, how they go together, wine selection, etc.  If you're going to spend some money, especially in a higher end restaurant, then the staff should live up to the price tag.  We placed our orders, a shrimp dish and a vegetarian, which we planned to share.  Our waiter suggested we change one of them since we had order two relatively \"dry\" dishes.  He suggested another shrimp dish with a sauce that would compliment the vegetarian dish we had order.  We took him up on the recommendation, and we were both extremely happy we did; delicious!  In addition, we stuck with ordering just a glass of wine each versus our normal bottle, since we were going out afterwards.  Again with the recommendations, our waiter complimented my choice of wine, which upon further questioning on why it was a good choice, made my brother switch his original choice to mine.  The wine went well with our meal and enhanced the overall experience.  The serving sizes were plenty for two people, and we had to leave a little behind, so I would suggest only ordering one dish per person if sharing.  In regards to spiciness, our dishes were nicely balanced.  One had a little zing to it, but did not overpower all the different spices in the dishes.  Based on our experience with our waiter, this will be a good place to go and have someone help you make a choice if you are trying to avoid dishes with too much spice/hotness.  There are so many choices in San Francisco and so many good restaurants, so to help narrow it down, consider this; if you want an elegant, but comfortable restaurant, expert waiter service (in a friendly way, not a \"full of myself\" snobbish way), tasty ethnic dishes, you can't go wrong with Amber India.", "author": "E.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-09-20", "description": "Yeah, it's alright. It has an interesting menu that spans from traditional, to 'progressive' or modern, they really love categorizing types of foods. One of our appetizers was a duck dish, and all of us agreed that you if we did not KNOW it had been duck, we would not have guessed it - it just seemed like a random meat-tasting meat marinated and done in the tandoori oven. Also, I believe someone else mentioned this in a post -- the sauces? They have no sauces. They don't serve any chutneys or dipping sauces for the naan (which, for 3 bucks an order I expect to stay fluffy and warm throughout the whole meal, they should just bring AROUND nan to the tables that decided to pay for it, instead of putting it in a basket infront of you and letting it get cold and stiff like at any other Indian restaurant that serves naan just as good if not better). When one of us asked for a spicy sauce, it was very reminiscent of the kind of chili-oil/paste you would find in a chinese restaurant.\n\n So yeah, it's good but there's many places that are not only better and where you can savor the flavors of what you're eating, and for a better price.", "author": "Samantha D."}

One thing to note is the expectation that all Indian/Pakistani restaurants will be priced like Pakwan is unrealistic.  This place isn't, nor should it be, given its impressive marbled decor and other superior touches.  Moreover, it won't be priced like it's Mountain View counterpart either - this is undeniably a cut above that place.  Now if it was priced like the Four Seasons next door, you would have a valid complaint, but so far most entrees are between $20-$25 and that fair [IMO] for the calibre of food that they serve ... and along the lines of what Slanted Door and Bong Su charge, albeit for Vietnamese cuisine.

Reading the reviews of previous diners, I'm a bit surprised that people would write such negative reviews based on an opening night experience, especially since such information is not likely to be helpful or representative of what the place is going to be like for other diners--more likely its just a form of revenge for someone's ruffled feathers.  In any case, its all irrelevant in my case because we had a fabulous time at Amber and everything, from the service to the ambiance and the food was first rate;  apparently it only took them a couple of days to get things together.   I had the tandoori Lamb Chop \"Frontier\", a \"signature\" dish, and it was a delight---a generous portion, tender and tasty.  Along with that we had the tandoori stuffed aloo, walnut and spinach raita, an order of pappad that came with two delicious chutneys, and the saffron rice.   A nice addition was the savory serving of butter chicken which the chef sent out as a gift, as he apparently felt  we could use something with a little sauce.  All was perfectly complemented by a glass of Temperanillo.  Dessert was the kesari rasmalai, a light and refreshing finale.   It was definitely the best Indian food I've had in a long time; in fact, I had virtually lost interest in that cuisine recently, even after a trip to India last year where I never had restaurant food this good.", "author": "David T."}

It is expensive, but it is definitely worth it to spend a little more for the ambience, tasty spins on what you'd get from your run-of-the-mill local indian restaurant, and (what i thought) great service.
