Thanks to the brother and his newly arrived gf from Taiwan, I had the opportunity to play tourist for a whole day, taking her around the city and trying new food places. I called in for a reservation for 4 at 2 pm as we were driving there and they had availability. Thank god we did this cause they were already a third full when we arrived but immediately filled up with a huge party of 11. \n\nSeating approximately 38 people, the restaurant is small but cozy and clean. There appears to be one server only but he was efficient and accommodating. Since it was our first time, we asked our waiter, Johnson, for recommendations and ordered everything he recommended. \n\nTOM YUM SOUP: one of my favorites at Thai restaurants. I love sour and spicy soups cause the combination is just so appetizing. Made with tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, lemon grass, green pepper, galangal, and your choice of protein (shrimp, catfish, seafood, chicken), or vegetable and tofu. We ordered it with chicken for $11. I initially thought the soup was small, but it filled up four rice bowls perfectly. There was plenty of moist chicken meat and the soup was mildly spicy as requested. Soo good!\n\nSOFT SHELL CRAB ($13.75): light battered soft shell crab with onions, green onions, green beans, and red bell pepper served with chef special sauce. I wasn't able to try this cause I'm allergic but everyone said it was their favorite. The crabs were goldenly fried and the portion was very generous for an appetizer. \n\nFISH CAKE ($9/4pc): grounded fish paste seasoned and mixed with chopped green beans. Lightly fried. Dipped in this side cucumber sauce with ground peanuts. The fish cakes were big and round, like an egg almost. I found the fish cakes to be ok. Not great but not bad.\n\nOXTAILS ($16.95): made with star anise, lemongrass, onions, carrots, tomatoes, slow braised oxtails, and basil served. MUST TRY. omg. the oxtails were really good. the meat was tender and fell off the bone. super flavorful. I can tell they've been marinating the oxtail for quite some time cause of the flavors and texture. \n\nPAD THAI ($11): my ultimate childhood favorite growing up. Actually, the ONLY dish I used to eat at Thai restaurants growing up. I was so obsessed, I stayed loyal until literally college when I finally decided it's time to expand my horizon and try other stuff. Although I'm more open to eating other dishes now, I find myself craving a Pad Thai every time I visit a Thai restaurant. I used to even tell myself if they can make a bomb ass pad thai, then they must be good cause it's like their signature dish right?? Well, turns out I was only partially correct, lol. Thai Cafe's version of Pad Thai contained similar ingredients as the other places I've tried: stir-fried Thai noodles with soft tofu, bean sprout, ground peanuts, and your choice of meat (shrimp, beef, pork, chicken) or just tofu. Although not bad, I did think their Pad thai was a little bland. Lacked flavor. But it wasn't bad. I added some vinegar jalapenos and Thai chili's to it and it turned out good. \n\nDUCK FRIED RICE ($12.75): Woah. Although simple, the duck fried rice was really good and I really enjoyed eating it. Made with boneless roasted duck, egg, onions, and green onions, it was surprisingly very appetizing and everyone dugged in and even got seconds. \n\nFRIED CATFISH ($?): not sure if this was on the menu cause Johnson recommended it to us when we were ordering and I don't member seeing it on the menu. BUT nonetheless, it was one well-made catfish. The fish was fried perfectly with the right amount of batter while still maintaining the moisture and softness of the fish. Yummm.\n\nSo far, most the dishes were good. The oxtail, soup, catfish, and duck fried rice were all my favorites. All these dishes were seasoned just right and simply tasted delicious. Service was really attentive from Johnson. With a full house, he managed everything and stayed consistent with service. Way to go, Johnson! \n\nPlus! They offered wine and beer :)", "author": "Anissa D."}

Most of the time, I ordered by phone and picked up the duck fried rice because the other food was just okay, nothing special. \n\nThe fried rice itself is actually so-so, just like regular Chinese fried rice, but what makes it special is the duck pieces that you get with every bite of the fried rice and they are very generous in giving the duck pieces.", "author": "Nathania Y."}

After all these years, I decided to go back and dine in. Street parking was easy since the street isn't that busy. I went with friends and we got family style; ordered a bunch of dishes and shared. \n\nCalamari- The calamari was served with fish sauce and it was very hot and crispy. I enjoyed the appetizer with the fish sauce because it gave it a sweet and tangy taste. \n\nCubed Beef- Very well marinated! The beef was tender and not chewy. It was lightly seasoned, enough to taste the juice from the beef. I actually liked this dish. \n\nTom Yum Chicken- The tom yum wasn't spicy at all. It tasted like tomatoes and water. Didn't really taste anything else. This is probably one of my least favorite dish there. I have tasted way better tom yum soup. \n\nShrimp Pad Thai- Not sure if I enjoyed this dish or not. The pad thai was lightly colored orange and it didn't have the typical green onions.  It did have tofu though...I felt like it was missing something...possibly lemon and spices\n\nChicken Green Curry- Very watered down! I have had thick green curry before and it was great. But this curry was very watered down as well. There was a lot of egg plants and bell peppers! I just wish it was creamier. \n\nDuck Fried Rice- Their duck fried rice never fails me! Their sauce is like crack sauce...you just want to smother the rice with sauce. The sauce is a slightly sweeter version of soy sauce. \n\nThough I did notice that the duck fried rice we got was a lot smaller portioned than the table next to us. The guy next table to us ordered a duck fried rice and his portion looked like it could feed 3 people. Whereas, our duck fried rice looked like it could barely feed 1 person. \n\nThe total bill came out to be around $70.00 which is not that bad considering it fed 4 people. Overall, the experience was good but I feel like there are lots of room for improvement.", "author": "Vanessa T."}

I visited last Friday with a co-worker and the service was TERRIBLE! \n\nNot only were people whom were seated after we were able to place their orders before we could, they received there food before we did as well. After waiting 30 minutes, I finally asked the waiter what the hold-up was and when we would receive our food. \n\nHe said he would get it right away and instead he began preparing a take-out order. We waited an 10 additional minutes and eventually got up and left without paying for our Thai Iced Teas. \n\nThe food is great for lunch in the area, primarily if you work close by but the limited staffing and ridiculously long wait time ensures that I won't visit again and plan to share the information with fellow coworkers who often visit as well.", "author": "Tiffany B."}

So I'm surprised I haven't done a review all these years. There was a time when they had to close for some remodeling and then they had this weird business schedule which made it hard for me to figure out when they were open. Anyway, they're on a normal and regular schedule now and that's all that matters. In the 18 years I've been going to this place, their food has been always consistently good. The Fried Calamari they serve up at this place is truly.. one of a kind. The crunchy garlicky flavor of the Calamari combined with the salty sweet dipping sauce is a delicious treat. My wife and I always use it as a standard to compare other Calamari dishes and so far, nothing really equals it. Next, the Clay Pot rice. Mmm Mmm Mmm!!! Filled with Bbq Pork, Chinese Sausage, Chicken, and Mushrooms.. my mouth is watering just talking about it. The Pad Thai, Basil Ground Chicken, Praram Beef, and Soft Shell Crab dishes are awesome and an even greater bargain when part of a lunch combo.", "author": "Orlando J."}

Their duck fried rice is really delicious especially when you pour a little bit (maybe more than a little bit) of their special sauce. YUMMMM :) \n\nI also always order an additional item, Cat Fish GP. I am not sure what GP stands for, but it is basically a fried catfish with basils, onion and pepper, which also taste really good. It is a perfect combo with the duck fried rice. \n\nI have tried several other food in their restaurant, such as their calamari, tofu tod and as well their claypot. It's good too. But, I rather stick with my usual must have order , which is cat fish GP and their duck friend rice. And for the calamari and claypot, I recommend to have it at Le Soleil, few blocks away.\n\nI have no comment for the service, I have never had very pleasant or very bad experience with that. so i will give 2.5/5 for the service.\n\nThey are closed on Tuesday like the other yummy restaurants.", "author": "Ulrica J."}

My previous favorite spot was a place called Racha Thai, which closed many many moons ago. I loved that place so much because of a hand full of dishes, the main one being the roast duck. They made it perfect, and the sauce they served with it was delish (sweet thai soy sauce with minced peppers). Since then I couldn't find another Thai place that came close.\n\nThis place is my favorite Thai place currently for one main reason....the roast duck. Nice big pieces that are juicy. It can be a miss at times, as I had the duck served to me slightly dry a couple of times. The other dishes here are at least average. I liked the Catfish GP (wish it was a little softer though), and the special clay pot was good. \n\nAll and all, a solid Thai restaurant.

Most places require you to circle the block for 45 minutes, get into a fist fight with some hipster, knock his teeth out and take his parking spot by force. Anyways, this place was not stressful which was the only redeeming feature of going here. \n\nIf you like Thai food served by Chinese people, this is your jam. That's right. These people aren't even Thai people. There was only 2 people working here while I was there. 2 people. I guess it's how you do it when minimum wage is pushing $11.00 per hour and Obama and Ed Lee are asking to raise it to $15 dollars per hour. \n\nThe cucumber salad has green food coloring in it. Yes, it does. I ordered one of these and it had sugar and green food coloring soaking in it. Really sickening. The beef and broccoli plate was really the only thing I could eat..but of course I could have gotten that anywhere else for about $7 dollars. This place is not very enjoyable. The food is a chore and really not special in any sense of the word. If you're out of choices, this place is doable but definitely not my first choice. \n\nThose per hour wage numbers are going to crush the service industry. Don't think many people have thought this through enough. Anyways, what can we expect? Bad service that's what. Many places will shut down and close. Others will have 2 workers working in the entire restaurant..so you will wait..and wait and wait for your food..and the bill will go up incrementally.

It's located in a place where parking was easily found on a Saturday night.  From the outside it has a modest appearance near a BevMo.  You enter and are struck with the decor of a homely Thai home.  Quite plain.  In fact missing a few decorations on the shelves of an entire wall mounted display case with dusty shelves.\n\nThe menu is typical but I felt at a glance not as typical as other mainstream Thai restaurants...like a section on curries...nope, not here.\n\nThis was my 1st meal of the day so I was READY to eat anything...\n\nSo we started with fried calamari because that is my weakness and I try it everywhere I go.  So I have a very wide range to compare this too tonight.  It came out looking promising.  Many ringlets with a medium batter piled next to a dipping sauce.  I started with a plain piece to get a sense of the freshness.  The squid was chewy and probably frozen.  The batter was at least not soggy.  However, they were over-seasoned with salt.  Then the dipping sauce.  An Asian blend of a sweet and sour-esque with fish sauce.  Way TOO sweet.  Combining the over-salted flavour and you have a tart mouthful of....[fill in the blank].  I had to wash it down with 2 glasses of water and Thai tea.\n\nOur entrees were the Seafood Combo.  A hodge podge of mixed crap stir-fried together.  Not very fresh tasting and kind of dry actually.  Our 2nd entree was Pad Phem with chicken.  Good on the spicy meter because I do like spicy foods (the lingering esophageal smoldering burn was left in my throat a few hours later even after a couple beers).  The chicken was tender and reasonable.\n\nAll in all, I would have to say it's a local homecooked-like meal.  Nothing fancy or sophisticated.  If you live in the area or this is a middle point as a meet-up, it is fine.  Drive across the Bay Bridge for?....not so much.  But I will say the price was reasonable.

I recalled seeing that Thai Cafe was at the end of my street so I called them up, ordered Pad Thai, and strolled on down.\n\nIts pretty hard to mess up Pad Thai (at a Thai restaurant- in my own kitchen it is more or less expected).  I had never met a Pad Thai that I didn't like (with the exception of those laced with cilantro- WHO DOES THAT?!?!?), but this was a disaster.  The chicken was of a poor quality and I could hardly bring myself to eat it.  The noodles were dry, AND I was not provided with any lemon or lime.\n\nThe people there, however, were very nice, so that has gained Thai Cafe an extra star.

Popped in with a friend for a late lunch noticed that the menu looked different from the last time I had been there which was a while ago.  The decor and menu looked a lot nicer than I remembered it being.  Anyway, I was happy to see that my favorite dish was still on there.  In the olden days, it used to be listed as Pad Ka Prow...ground chicken with basil and mint, but now it's listed as just Ground Chicken with a more detailed description beneath.  For some reason, this is the one dish that I have consistently craved and ordered every time I come here.\n\nI've had this dish elsewhere and there are other delicious versions out there, but everyone else makes it sweeter and more oily.  The version here is not very oily and is more dry than what you normally get in other Thai places...some might even say it's too dry.  However, taste is subjective and for me, I have always loved the way Thai Cafe makes it.\n\nI noticed that there is now a lunch special that they call a Set Meal for only $10.95 which includes entree, choice of soup, and vegetable or seafood spring roll (egg roll?).  When the food came out, I was happy...the presentation was nice, the portions ample, and the food was good.  I enjoyed the ground chicken, the sweet/spicy vegetable soup, and the two spring rolls.  Not bad at all. Although I didn't have any, the portions for the roast duck looked pretty good too.\n\nYears ago, there were always the same two ladies working the front desk there.  One was always happy, smiling, and nice, while the other was always the exact opposite.  I think she was the one that turned me off to this place over the years.  Not sure if it's true, but I was told by my friend that the owner changed a while ago.\n\nAnyway, I like this place again and will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes.

It was around 6:30pm and the restaurant was deserted. That's not exactly a good sign right? Oh well, we were already here. She ordered a eggplant special and I ordered a pad kee mao. She placed our food in the middle so we ended up sharing. My friend had also ordered a bowl of rice so since we were sharing I asked for a bowl of rice as well. The rice was quite hard which I did not like. Otherwise the food was really yummy. The waitress also bagged our food together in the same bag too without asking if we wanted it separately.

It's a small place, but it never feels crowded.  They only have a few tables, so I get the feeling they really only want locals.  Then again, to find this place by chance, you'd have to pass by it every day.\n\nThe food is okay, not because the flavor isn't amazing or they don't cook everything perfectly, but because their menu is fairly limited compared to a lot of other Thai places.  They seem to have the mentality of doing a few things very well, rather than doing a lot of things just okay.  It's a good strategy, but I think in the interest of staying in business, they should add some more noodle dishes.

All though it's not as Thai authentic as other dishes, it is still very flavorful and enjoyable. It's a hodgepodge of chicken, Chinese sausage, pork, mushrooms and shrimp over rice in a clay pot. The cooking juices from the cooked meat form a delicious sauce that lightly covers the white rice giving it a delicious taste.\n\nI also recommend:\n\nFried Calamari- The fish sauce makes it taste better.\n\nSea Food Combination- A little weird with the ground chicken but it works. \n\nCho Chee Seafood- A little more kick and sauce compared to the Combo. \n\nBasil Chicken- Equally good.\n\nI would give this place 5 stars, however I often find myself waiting a while before the server comes.

I hadn't come here in years and years so I was a little surprised they re-did the interior.  It looks really nice inside!  Our reservation was for 6pm, 9 people.  They had no problem accomodating us and actually had another large party there at the same time as us.  No problems with service and the food was decent.  No complaints, but it also wasn't the best Thai food I've ever had either.  Everyone ordered a dish and we shared family-style so everyone could have a little taste of everything.  I wasn't too impressed with my Thai iced tea, but other than that, I'd say it was pretty fair.", "author": "Kris L."}

There is a guy named Tony there who treats all customers as if they were regulars, and that helps make your first experience at a restaurant you've never been to a pleasant one. Definitely a nice place to visit for some Thai.", "author": "Rommel N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-14", "description": "I live very close to Thai Cafe so it is a good option for me for quick take out. The people who work in there are very nice.  The biggest problem with the place is that in recent months there have been fewer and fewer people eating there. I dont really think this indicates a problem with the food, I think it is a general crunch on many restaurants in the city combined with a less-than-ideal location. So the point is, and I think this is just my personal hang-up more than anything, fewer customers mean less turnover of food, and it could impact freshness. \n\nSo anyway the food is good. I have only been disappointed once, and it was because the fried calamari was over-done. Serves me right for getting fried calamari, fatty. The actual thai food has never let me down, though. Im never blown away, but I keep going back. \n\nIf you are a denizen of the Inner Richmond, Lone Mountain, Laurel Heights whatever area, go to Thai Cafe!", "author": "Rick P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-10-30", "description": "My friends and I stopped by the Thai Cafe before going to the Bridge Theatre on Geary.  We ordered Pad Thai, Pad See-Ew, Duck Fried Rice, and Calamari.  The Calamari was made just right - not too much batter and came with a tasty sauce.  The Duck Fried Rice has lots of bit sized chucks of duck.  The Pad See-Ew was the best I've had in a while - though greasy, still very tasty.  The Pad Thai was the worst - very ordinary, already pre-tossed, and no limes (when we asked for a lime, they gave us lemons - what kind of Thai place has no limes?)  We ordered Thai Iced Tea - also good, a little on the sweet side - if that's what you like.  \nAdditional notes:  The restaurant is small - only about 10 - 4 person tables - OK for groups of 5-8, any larger and it becomes difficult.  Service is OK - had one waiter for the whole restaurant.  Also, be prepared for your clothes to smell.", "author": "J. W."}

The food is mediocre which is why I gave it two stars and not only one, but because there so many really good authentic Thai restaurants in San Francisco why go to a fake? Most of the dishes are Chinese and the only thing remotely Thai about this place is that they server curry. Som thom? Larb? Not. Duck fried rice is a Chinese dish people, and you're better off getting it at Mayflower further up Geary St. If you don't believe me look for anyone that is Thai reviewing this restaurant. None!

I learned just HOW weird when I had the following experience:\nThe last time I ate here, I asked if they were able to make Praram Chicken. The waiter said that it wasn't on the lunch menu, then pointed out a chicken and vegetables in oyster sauce option.\nHe offered to substitute sauces for me (peanut for oyster).\nI said \"yes, thanks\"!\nHe brought an entree a short time later that consisted of the oyster sauce dish with peanut sauce thrown on top.\nIt might not sound too bad, but trust me, it really tastes NASTY when you mix the two.\nI choked it down and, when the bill came, decided that my waiter did NOT provide me with stellar service. I tipped about $1.00 in change (on a $10 total bill).\nWhat happened next was TRULY surprising. As I left the restaurant, some guy (a manager?) followed me OUTSIDE and confronted me with the tip. He was LIVID, and practically THREW my (tip) money at me, as he spat \"Don't you ever come to this restaurant again!\"\nNo questions, no discussion, no consideration of the whole PURPOSE of tipping. Just \"Don't you ever come to this restaurant again!\"\nUnbelievable. I hope that the management has changed. This incident, admittedly, was a few years ago.", "author": "J H."}
