Green Chili Kitchen does a great job of staying true to the New Mexican tradition and classing it up a bit, as is the San Francisco way. I was born and raised in the Land of Enchantment (New Mexico) and I really love this place for bringing home to me. \n\nI've never met anyone who didn't like green chili. Give it a go! \n\n(p.s. this place deserves a better rating than it has. The food is fantastic and the space is lovely)", "author": "Shaun L."}

I have very mixed feelings about it at this stage.\n\n I really like the space (large and airy with windows on two sides), the decor and the communal table. I also like that it's just off Divis. Some of the menu is good (I like the burittos) But I've also had some eating experiences there which range from mediocre (empanadas) through the bad (meagre flat quesadilla with cheese and nothing else for $11) to the appalling (violent food poisoning).\n\nThis is my local restaurant: I wish I could like it more.", "author": "William M."}

She wanted the frito pie and we split that with a salad. We also ordered an agua fresca.\n\nThe person who took our order had no clue what she was doing. She could not answer any questions about the menu and we had to wait for her to ask someone else.\n\nAs for the food, it was good but, like others have mentioned, not worth the price. The frito pie was kind of small and it was really something you'd make at home, no restaurant twist to it at all. The veggie salad was good but it was $16 without any meat. I did not leave the restaurant feeling full.\n\nOverall, this place is OK. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I won't tell you not to go if you were in the mood for some New Mexican cuisine.", "author": "Roya B."}

In hindsight, that would have been a good indication of what was in store for us, but we went in anyway. \n\nYou order at a counter and then they give you a number and you sit down. Maybe the cashier was new, because I asked for a side of roasted potatoes (which is listed on the menu...) and he was confused and asked me if I meant mashed potatoes. It also took about 10 minutes for three people to order- it was very slow. \n\nWe sat down and my friends' food arrived immediately. My food was nowhere to be seen 15 minutes later, and they were almost done. We had ordered the exact same thing, so it shouldn't have taken that long for my food to come out. Finally, my food arrived. The food was good- the healthy breakfast bowl and roasted potatoes were filling and flavorful, and they didn't feel heavy or greasy. It was expensive though, at around $20 for both of them. \n\nOverall, it was an extremely mediocre experience with good food. I will probably return to try the dinner menu, which looked like it had potential.

But 5 out of 5 people at our table agreed that the food was too spicy.  I had the signature dish, a bowl of green chile stew.  The added meat was adequate in quality and quantity, but it floated in an enormous bowl of green chiles in soup.  I like green chiles, I thought I liked them a whole lot, but not this much, and the spiciness of it got to me, even though I like spicy food.  I could only finish about half of it.\n\nEven basic things like the enchilada plate had sauce which was too spicy, even though they were ordered mild.\n\nService a little bit on the spacey side.

I'm originally from New Mexico, so I'm pretty picky when it comes to restaurants outside of NM serving our cuisine. But....I'm happy to report this was AWESOME! We came here craving a breakfast burrito...and we were impressed.  You get alot of options in building your breakfast burrito platter...meat (several options), Chile (red or green, hot or mild), type of beans. I ordered green Chile with beef, my daughter ordered bacon with green. I kicked myself later for not getting the bacon. The bacon breakfast burrito is my definite recommendation. The side of roasted potatoes are simple but the red chile sauce on them was very tasty. Pinto beans, which I read per review are made vegetarian style (zero lard), worried me. But they were good. Tortillas were great...not the weird sweet tasting ones I've had in taquerias. All in all, I was satisfied with the food and service. I didn't have bad service at all, everyone was nice and polite. My only small complaint might be the \"heat\" of the green chile. I ordered \"hot\", but it wasn't too hot for me. But, that's just because I'm accustomed to very HOT chile and I understand not alot of people would appreciate that kind of heat. Still, both the red and green chile had lots of flavor.\nMaybe its just low in reviews because it is not the local Mexican food flavor. New Mexican  food is neither Tex Mex nor taqueria style. It was a taste of home...one I surely miss since moving to CA. I'm so happy to find a place that warms my heart and my tummy. :)", "author": "Jenn H."}

While the food is very flavorful and fairly priced, the general ambiance of the restaurant negatively affected our experience.  The tables and booths seemed quite dirty and worn.  Additionally, all of the restaurant windows and doors were open and there were a number of flies in the dining room that can easily travel into the food prep area.  The music in the dining room became a little grating too.  Oh well, at least the food tasted good!", "author": "Francie N."}

I'm a sucker for a corner restaurant with huge windows so you can enjoy people watching. I mean, the theater of street life is free entertainment, right? (Ideal too if you're dining alone.) Anyway, I recently went in for lunch and ordered their grilled fish tacos. It was delicious and served in presumably a stone-ground blue corn tortilla. It was sturdy and held the nicely grilled tacos well. If I recall, the fish was cod. It was bright, fresh, and extra delicious with the accompanying salsa. The two tacos were served with rice and a wedge of lime. The rice though was a bit more al dente than I'd like it to be. In other words, it needed an extra minute or two to get to the desired fluffiness. In past visits, I've also had their green chile stew which is tasty and satisfying. They also have a pretty solid horchata, a perfect drink for warm autumn San Francisco days. (I'll never understand why our summers are chilly and why our autumns are hot. [Not. About. The. Heat.])\n\nThe service is efficient and deserves high marks. You order on a menu at the register, they give you a number, and the food is brought out to your table. The food runners are friendly and attentive. For example, one of the runners not only brought our orders but automatically refilled our chips when we ran out from the chips+guacamole appetizer. And by the way, their tortilla chips are everything! I love thick tortilla chips. Thin chips are good too but I'm partial to these thicker cuts *and* they don't under-salt like some places.\n\nGreen Chile has been open for years and clearly they know how to keep their clientele.", "author": "James Z."}

It certainly beat driving across the Bay Bridge, and then around and around in the neighborhood in order to find street parking.\n\nGCK is set up so that you place and pay for your order up at the front counter, and then also find your own seating.  There are a couple of outdoor tables, and lots of different types of seating indoors.  There are two large communal tables, some tables for four, tables for two, some seats at the bar, and a few booths off to the right when you first walk in.  I'm glad that I came a bit earlier than my friend so I could scope out and claim a table for the two of us.  Don't worry about plopping down into a seat at a table with dishes on it.  Someone will be by to ferry it all away and wipe it down.  I'm not sure if GCK is normally filled on Saturday evenings, or if San Franciscans were just out in full force to watch game four of the World Series.  \n\nThe have a lot of great things to choose from on their menu, but I opted for two homemade tamales (one chicken, one pork) - $12.  They also have cheese and vegan sweet potato options, too.  The tamales came with chile, beans, rice, and salad.  I chose black beans, but they also have pinto and refried.  As for the chile, they have hot green, mild green or red.  My friend, who has been here before, told me that you could opt for \"Christmas,\" and get both green and red.  I went with that so I could sample both chiles.  :)\n\nAfter we received a table number, I went to this little station that's to the right once you enter the restaurant, for napkins, cutlery, and mason jars for water.\n\nAfter about ten minutes or so, a waiter came by with our food.  I thought that the rice and beans were really good, but the tamales were a little on the bland side.  I feel like the meat could have received a bit more seasoning.  On the other hand, once I added on some of the green and red chile, it had plenty of flavor.\n\nIf you have a sweet tooth, I would recommend taking your receipt down the block to Chili Pies and Ice Cream for some dessert.  My friend and I split a pie milkshake (Mexican hot chocolate pecan w/ vanilla ice cream), and it was magical.  \n\nI'm not in the Western Addition/NOPA neighborhood a whole lot, but I would definitely stop here again and check out their nachos and some of their housemade lemonades.", "author": "Iona C."}

My friend navigates us to Green Chile and we park, leave the dogs in the car (knowing they'll be everywhere they're not supposed to be) and walk to the restaurant. It's in between lunch and dinner so not very busy. It feels like a converted warehouse in there. Very tall ceilings, huge windows, chunky and industrial decor. There's a heavy Mexican theme which reminds me of living in Seattle in the 1990s when we decorated with a lot of wrought iron and Catholic iconography. I love it. \n\nThe menu is great -- lots of tamales and sopas and combinations -- prices are reasonable and there's a lot to choose from. Inexplicably, I order a burrito. It was good but is not the best example of what this place is capable of. I had a bite of my friend's food and it was much better.

We ordered a grilled chicken burrito, red chile chicken posole and homemade tamales. The food did not taste good or feel authentic and very overpriced. \n\nGrilled Chicken Burrito:\nI ordered it with guacamole inside (paid extra for that which is normal in any Mexican restaurant). What did I get? A burrito with no guac inside but instead a small little dot of guac sitting on top of it. I had to get back in line and order more guac on the side to eat with this burrito. The chicken had no flavor, there seemed to be white rice in there (different than the rice that came with the tamales), black beans and some pico de gallo salsa. I ordered it to have a small amount of rice and more black beans, I got the opposite. Either the one taking my order didn't make that note or the cook didn't follow it. Or maybe she didn't give a sh**. I don't know. Either way, this burrito was one of the worst I've had in a really really long time. Dare I say, Chipotle can make a better burrito than this for a fraction of the price. \n\nHomemade tamales:\nOrdered the chicken and pork tamales with the green chile sauce. It was made with blue corn. First, there was barely any meat inside of the pork tamale. It was mostly blue corn and did not taste like anything at all. This thing lacked seasoning. The chicken tamale had more meat but still the issue remained that it did not taste like much. Typically there is more corn than meat but this place made it more drastic than that. I would have been okay with that if the blue corn tasted good, but it didn't. The rice that came with it was hard as a rock too. Horrible dish...\n\nRed Chile Chicken Posole:\nThe only thing they got right in this place. Tasted really good actually. The blue corn tortilla it came with though, not good. \n\nLesson learned, this place cannot compete with any hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant. Hell, Chipotle and Chevy's beats this place.", "author": "Josemaria G."}

This was loaded with cheese so it was hard to taste anything but the green chili and cheese. The burrito is incredible spicy so if you're not good with spice I wouldn't recommend you try this.

Have to give myself a big Fail on that one for you see I was born and raised in NM. This past weekend a friend was touting some Mexican restaurant, proclaiming that everyone he's taken there has loved it. So we figured we'd give it a try. Much to my surprise as we drove up this was no Mexican place, but a New Mexican place! To the untrained palate these might sound one in the same, but believe me there are differences. (You wouldn't say Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Korean are the same would you, same thing here).\n\nI must have looked like one of Pavlov's dogs (*ding*) when I saw Zia symbols and claims of Green Chile on the windows!  I went straight for the stuffed sopapilla with carne adovada, my favorite dish back home, and a bowl of green chile stew to back it up. In New Mexican dishes it's all about the chile and how well you balance heat with rich flavor. As far as the carne adovada goes I'd say the red chile here is on point with what you can expect in NM. Not the best I've had, but certainly far from the worst. However, I was surprised that although the dish was called \"stuffed\" sopapilla there were instead pieces of sopapilla mixed in with the carne adovada. It's usually sopapilla (fried bread) stuffed with the meat. No biggie. Now the green chile is where many New Mexican's will get snobby, each remembering where/when/with whom they had their best bowl. To that regard, I wasn't a big fan of the green chile stew. It didn't really have the rich flavors I crave when yearning for a bowl. But similar to the red, not the worst I've had and even better than some restaurants in New Mexico. Part of it I think is due to chile having to be shipped here, and not being as fresh as it is when I have it in NM.\n\nGreat job bringing this flavor to the cultural crockpot we call SF. Great execution on the red chile, ok on the green. I'll be back!", "author": "Stephen R."}

Fantastic New Mexico cooking, which in my mind is the highest level of Mexican cooking. \n\nI'm not at all familiar with this part of San Francisco so I asked the bus driver to stop at an interesting place and he stopped here. Lucky for me. \n\nI'm usually pretty quick on deciding what I want to eat from a menu but that wasn't the case here because they have a fairly extensive menu. I finally told myself, come on Neil it's just lunch so I chose the chili reyano plate at  $18. It features 2 green poblano mild peppers stuffed with a real nice light cheese and I think a frothy egg batter surrounding it. Then a small beef taco, a moderate amount of chicken and pozole stew, a nice helping of Spanish rice and a generous helping of your choice of black, pinto, or refried beans. I chose the refried beans and wasn't disappointed. \n\nI don't rate may places at 5 stars but this makes the grade. \n\nYou do have to line up to order and pay at the register which is a little difficult to do when you don't know what they have or what you want, but there's benches to sit and peruse the menu.

Oh, and topped with mild green chile (you can choose hot or mild green chile or red chile). OH MY GOSH. My tastebuds were jumping with joy! I'm a big fan of marinated pork (Al Pastor, Korean Spicy Pork, etc), so it's not a big surprise that I'm obsessed with Adovada. The meat was tender, juicy, and so flavorful. What more could you want? Plus, the sopaipilla was crispy with a nice chewiness. Fried dough? Always.\n\nSince it was Sunday brunch, we also ordered the Root Vegetable Hash ($13) that was topped with Carne Adovada, overeasy eggs, and red chile. Served with a side of saut\u00e9ed greens. The hash was okay, but I had no complaints since there was more Adovada. Ruben's cousin also ordered baskets of Sopaipillas ($5) for the table, so it was nice to try them plain and with New Mexican red chile honey. Yum! Loved the subtle chile kick in the sweet honey.

She ordered the apricot blueberry pie.\n\nHealthy slices of warm pie, topped with top-notch ice cream and paired with coffee...is there a better way to end a day (food-wise, you awful perverted heathens)? I don't think so. True, this place is popular with families with small kids. Duh. Check the location and the fact that there's pie and ice cream on the menu.

I've been coming here for years, and spent hundreds of dollars here; nonetheless, I find some aspects of this business super annoying. At this moment I'm actually contemplating staying away for good, due to an extra frustrating scenario that unfolded today.\n\nFirst, understand that it's always crazy busy and there's bound to be a line and a shortage of seats. Thus the objective is to place an order and claim a spot ASAP.  Today my experience was: wait in line for 10 minutes, then find myself at the front of the line, hoping the open spots at the bar don't disappear before I place my order. Suddenly, some guy is sidestepping the line and asking register dude about his to go order. Instead of telling him to stand in line like the rest of us, he rings him up and spends several minutes conferring about the guy's order with the kitchen employees. After this, some girl decides to try her hand at cutting the line - register dude rings her up, too. Finally I place my order, miraculously claim a seat, and discover that another register guy is taking someone's food order from the bar, despite the fact that an actual line still exists. \n\nWhat the f*ck... this is seriously absurd.  If there's some additional system aside from the main line, at least tell the rest of us so we aren't wondering why we're getting pushed aside for other customers.\n\nEdit: I've come back here, at times when it's less busy, because I do like the food and atmosphere. However, there is a real problem with crowd management and customer communication at this venue. It's not reasonable that a longtime customer like myself would find out via a Yelp comment how the line is supposed to work - this should be immediately clear to all.", "author": "Janna M."}

What I love about Green Chile Kitchen:\n\n1.  It's always open -- no break between lunch and dinner.  We frequently find ourselves eating at odd hours, and that is when Green Chile Kitchen is at it's best -- uncrowded and easy to get a table.\n\n2.  You order your food at the counter and pay up front.  They bring your food to you (the service is generally quite good), and then when you're done, you can just get up and leave, no waiting for the check.  You get water and silverware yourself, which I prefer to hoping that the waiter or waitress might come by and offer me some more water.\n\n3.  Great Mexican or New Mexican fare, with great vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options!  I love Mexican food, but since we became vegan many years ago, we've hardly ventured into any Mexican restaurants since there rarely are any vegan choices.  Our top vegan choices at Green Chile Kitchen are the Grilled Vegetarian Burrito and the Quinoa Stuffed Poblano Peppers.  Also great is the Grains & Greens Salad and the Homemade Vegan Tamales.

It has a cool vibe the moment you walk in. It has a weekly specials menu on large poster paper with hand drawn artwork. It has self serve water that you get in mason jars.\n\nFOOD: I ordered the New Mexican homemade chicken enchilada. I did not add an egg, but I was tempted to. I ordered it with black beans and hot green chile. This was superb. Served with rice, lettuce, and sour cream, I was personally disappointed with the portion for the price of Mexican food. But the enchilada was delicious. The chicken was cooked well and went great with the cheese and the sauce. The black beans were especially flavorful but the rice was a bit lacking. But when you put everything together for one bite, it was amazing. I also got chips and Tomatillo avacado salsa. This was also very good. Not quite sure how to describe it, but it was hot, sour, salty, avocadoy all at the same time and it worked well.\n\nThe only problem was the slight wait.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-04-12", "description": "New Mexico native here, dad is a chef. Here's the deal. \n\nI join in heartfelt (though bittersweet) agreement with those who have commented on the lack of flavors in most of the dishes. While the ingredients are fresh and authentic, I have yet to eat a dish here that felt 'right' as far as the spices, intricate flavorings, and 'oomph' that true New Mexican food requires. There is, I regret, a richness that is missing. Call me crazy, or maybe I've just had my family's cooking for 20 years too long, but they simply don't use the right combination of salt, fats and spices to make me swoon. The blandness of the food, however, is of minor concern compared to the unnaturally ostentatious air that the restaurant itself presents. \n\nAccording to their website, the food is \"inspired by Logan's many years spent in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\" First of all, spending many years (ahem, college) somewhere is not a qualification for understanding of an area's culture or cuisine. Good business idea, buddy, but I would leave it to the pros on this one, especially if they are an 82-y/o abuelita who could school yo ass in making tortillas. Second of all, Santa Fe is to Albuquerque as Marin is to the Mission. An hour apart but a world of difference. Obviously the food in the actual Santa Fe is just as good as the food in the actual Albuquerque, or Las Cruces, or Bernalillo, but it is also more flashy and more expensive, something that evidently also inspired the owners' restaurant design. At least in Santa Fe, if you splurge on lunch at a fancy restaurant, you can feed your whole family with one enchilada platter (that's how we do). Lastly, in New Mexico, chips + salsa come for free BEFORE your meal and sopapillas come for free WITH or AFTER - neither one is ever $5 a pop. \n\nOn the upside, many of the dishes served here (posole, calabacitas, stuffed sopapillas) are genuine and unique to this restaurant in SF. I respect that the owners are bringing attention to the fact that (Yelp categories notwithstanding) New Mexican cuisine *is* a distinct cuisine, of which green chile is an important though not sufficient element. Unfortunately, I can't get over the pretentiousness of the prices and decor, which combine to form an inauthenticity unmitigated by the admittedly ideal sourcing of their namesake ingredient. New Mexican food is southern food both in the sense that it is comfort food and in the sense that you would NEVER pay $13 for fried chicken and a biscuit. Am I right? So why are you paying $15 for a burrito, ye hipster scum? I suppose for the same reason I might pay $12 for Kung Pao chicken, but I digress. \n\nInstead of coming here, make yourself a burrito and order your green chile from Hatch (http://www.elreyonline.com/) directly. Then you can taste and BE as authentic as New Mexicans have been for hundreds of years.", "author": "Eileen T."}

I've had a love/hate relationship with it. The first item I ever ordered was a breakfast burrito. It was tasty, but it was small and overpriced. It barely filled me up and that's unacceptable. The breakfast burrito from Beanbag Cafe on Divis or the breakfast wrap from Oasis Cafe are way better.\n\nI found out a few months back that they offer a burger. Well, I ordered it for take out and it's actually very flavorful. You get the cheese burger wrapped in a tortilla with green chiles on top and the condiments on the side. Fresh lettuce onion and tomato. The fries are these seasoned crinkle cut ones.\n\nI went here last night to sit down and have a $2 pacifico. I was going to order the burger but I wanted to revisit the enchilada after he said it was bigger portions than the burger. It was a decent square sized slice of enchilada that had \"succulent\" chicken. Small side salad with pico de gallo and rice and beans on the side. I was satisfied. The hot green chiles were as warned, hot, but that's what I wanted.\n\nThis place is a happening spot and is always pretty busy but not too busy. They also have a big screen TV now.

I tried their Chicken Enchiladas and they were pretty flavorless.  In fact, many typical dishes one would find in a New Mexican restaurant were absent from the original menu (Sopapillas, Carne Adovada).  In the years since many people had told me that the food was really good and I should try it again.  After my recent visit, I can say that I do really like Green Chile Kitchen!\n\nThe newer space is great - large with a more room and a nice ambiance - Urban Rustic New Mexican.  The food was very good: \n\nGreen Chile Stew - a subtlety-flavored chicken stew with some good flavors, especially from the green chiles.\n\nCarne Adovada - a nice hearty stew of red chiles and tender pork.  This has a nice smokey flavor that is natural from the chiles and the seasoned tender pork creates a great balance in texture.  The rice and beans that arrived were decent.\n\nSopapillas - soft and delicate pillows of fried bread, these went perfectly with the adovada or stew.  I saved a bit for dessert and enjoy it with the Honey Chile.\n\nWhile I did really like the meal, I can't say it was very authentic New Mexican.  Green Chile Kitchen is definitely a California interpretation of New Mexican cuisine - not necessarily a bad thing, since I like the healthier food (no lard!).

The downside is the pricing. I don't mind spending 9 bucks on a burrito, especially when the employee says they are big. Lies, they are Americanized burritos that aren't filled at all like a burrito should be. I ordered a vegetarian burrito, expecting a hefty burrito filled of goodies. Instead I got a burrito filled with just rice, some beans, maybe three slices of avocado and some cheese. Not impressed at all. This is my first time and last time.

Cashier is in the middle as I walk in. And I ordered the Chicken Breakfast Burrito. For $8.00, I get a lean chicken meat, which is from Fulton Valley and made from the aforementioned rotisserie cooker, scrambled eggs, potato chunks and Pico de Gallo sauce in a flour tortilla with green chile, guacamole and sour cream as toppings. My burrito was loose on a plate with an artful presentation. Tastewise, the meat was lean and smoky with a noticeable rotisserie flavor. I also added a Limon Jarrito to wash my burrito down. \n\nRemember, \"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day\". \n\n\"So eat a burrito!\" \n\nI did and I will definitely come back and again eat the breakfast burrito and other foods from the restaurant.", "author": "Matt G."}

Guess you do learn something new every day.\n\nAnyway, I've had a variety of dishes here, from the veggie quesadilla to the carne adovada to the chile relleno, and I've always been satisfied. After a brief wait in line (there is always a line - which I think is a good thing), you order at the counter and bring your number to an open table. Service has always been prompt and friendly, and portions are sizable and fairly priced - actually I think cheaper than some other SF options of equal quality.

Don't be, because the rest of their party is still waiting in line to order their food.  \n\nBut alas, all is well (or so says the friendly management at the mercy of this Kafka-esque system), since the kitchen will gladly hold off on making your food until you've notified them you finally fought for a table of your own.  \n\nI don't like hovering over people eating, so I didn't make it to the Green Chile Gauntlet finish line...I walked out in search of a more civilised resto.

Here's the truth: it wasn't the best breakfast burrito of my life. Here's why: sauce was on top, forcing me to eat it with a fork and knife, and the tortilla to ingredient ratio was a bit off. In fact, I do not remember a single bean in this burrito. These are personal preferences. I'm also willing to attribute my lack of enthusiasm for this burrito to the soyrizo I had added, and maybe I'll give it another chance. Maybe.\n\nThe huevos motulenos I had during my first dining experience here are worth talking about. I am a sucker for plantains, and it had a good balance of sweet, salty, and unexpected without feeling too heavy. It was perfect with the watermelon agua fresca.

Nice place, clean, feels New Mexican with a more muted color scheme. The first thing that stood out were the prices. Poor college student visiting SF for the weekend = not a lot of options.\n\nI ended up buying a single tamale that cost $4. However, it was an outstanding tamale. Made with blue corn and topped with some of their Chile Honey, I was pretty satisfied. My friend ordered a $6 burrito that I nibbled on and it was also delicious. If I had not had a piece of pie after, I probably would have been hungry still.

ENJOYED IT. I liked the Tamale but it did not beat my favorite place to get a chicken tamale. The texture of the masa in the tamale was too soft (reminded me of mash potato) and wish their shredded chicken was shredded down a little more and distributed within the masa. it was like one big piece of shredded chicken and covered with masa.I had to eat bites of masa to get to the chicken and prefer masa and chicken to be meshed together (but thats just me). The two sides came in a very tiny serving (few bites) but felt it was just enough to not make it a heavy \"breakfast\". The green chile was a bit spicy, i hardly dabbled into it. The posole was delicious, i think i would have been fine with a cup of that and one chicken tamale. The side salad was good, the greens were cut to smaller pieces which made it easier to eat and it was topped with almost like pico de galla (minus the onions). \n\nBerry Good Honest Tea - this was actually made for \"kids\" but I saw no kids in the restaurant.

I'ts certainly priced like a sit down establishment but then the food and god forsaken ordering process is much more like  a regular Taqueria. Only most Taquerias give you a fighting chance of finding a place to sit after ordering. At Green Chile Kitchen, you jockey for position around occupied tables with a beer in one hand and your order number in the other waiting for a table to vacate. It kind of feels like a ski lodge cafeteria at high noon.  If you are lucky enough to get seated before your food arrives, you are golden. If not, I guess you have to make some fast friends. \n\nAfter about 5 minutes of standing around, we secured a booth. The food arrived shortly after. Speaking of, I ordered a chicken burrito with green chili salsa smothered on top.  It was accompanied by a side of rice and a salad - all for about $14. It was pretty good but then, I know of no combination of meat, beans, salsa and cheese that isn't. \n\nMy suggestion to Green Chile - become a sit down restaurant. You don't have to take reservations - jut get a list and send people to the bar to wait their turn.  Keep up the takeout service register because lots of people just want a burrito to go.

Perhaps some chips and salsa would have rounded out the meal but I'm not forking over more cash for a simple courtesy that almost any Mexican restaurant provides gratis.\n\nIn years past I've splurged on the combo plate, but several times the enchilada wasn't even melted.  A couple years back I tried the breakfast tacos and had to send the plate back (first time in my life) because the eggs were still totally liquid, dripping all over the place.\n\nThe pluses?

The tamale was lovely steaming hot, spicy and YUM!!  It made me sweat a bit, so I drank a lot of water - loved it!!  They gave me a mix of chips, regular corn and purple corn - nice!  The guacamole little dish could've been a tad bigger (3x as big would've been nice) as I like to pile on the guacamole on each chip.

When I first started going it was less expensive, but since they've moved into a bigger location and added more staff, the prices have become absurd.

Burritos, quesadillas, sopapillas, stews all made with plenty of seasoning, and the blue corn tortillas are a nice touch. Having to stake out tables and steal them from under people is such a horrible way to run a restaurant. And, don't pay the extra .75 cents for guacamole. You'll get about a tbsp of it.

But, for being such a casual place they sure do have a nice organic wine list.\n\nI went with a taco plate for dinner - 3 tacos (your choose of beef, chicken, pork, or veggie), rice, and mixed vegetable. Because I heart variety I chose one of each type of taco except veggie. It was weird - all the tacos were good, but none of them had any sort of Mexican flavor that I know and love. And I don't love just one kind of Mexican flavor. I enjoy the stuff I eat in Denver, Arizona, southern California, heck I even wholeheartedly enjoy Tex-Mex. Actually, now that I think about it this was like Mex-Tex perhaps. Because they used corn tortillas and a nice salsa, but the meat itself was plainly flavored and there were fancy vegetables instead of refried beans. Anyway, the beef was my favorite as far as flavor went, but really it just tasted like a nice cut of beef on a corn tortilla. \n\nThis place gets way crowded so I highly recommend going during off times and not with a big group.

I'm a big fan of it, but that's about all.  I've had a few other items as well, and they all struck me as sub-par (especially the dry burritos) for one reason or another.\n\nAs much as I wanted to like a place that was so close to me, I couldn't help but feel like I had to fight to get all the things I needed.  Fight for a table while someone else places your order by proxy.  Go get your own silverware.  Go find someone to refill the knives, then go get them yourself.  Go get someone to refill the napkins and water, then get your own damn water.  I can go to Taco Bell for $3 and they'll STILL get all this shit for me!\n\nOriginal:\n\nWould love to say I tried the food, but the place was apparently inconvenienced by our presence, so we left.\n\nI'm no stranger to restaurants.  I've been to sit down places, stand up places, places with windows.  In my experience \"Order at the counter\" places have a sign that says \"Order here\" and a menu above the counter to inform you of their offerings.  Also, a place with a bar ALWAYS lets you order at the bar.  If they, for some reason, do not let you order at the bar, they're usually sure to tell you that you need to go somewhere else to get what you need, instead of letting you stand there forever in vain.  Any respectable restaurant, I would hope, would notice you after standing at a perfectly reasonable area to place an order for 15 full minutes.  \n\nWe were afforded no such decency, nor the time of day--they couldn't even take 0.13 seconds to say 'hi' when we walked in, then or the 8 subsequent times I made uncomfortable eye contact with any of the employees.  When I finally asked what was up and mentioned that it wasn't obvious that you need to stand somewhere OTHER THAN A BAR to get a beer, I was shrugged off entirely and told I needed to wait in line I've been standing next to for what seems like an eternity.  \n\nI'm giving it a generous two stars because I plan on going back when I'm not seething mad about a place that apparently doesn't give a crap about its customers.  I feel that's generous, and I hope that someone in management stops apologizing to all these reviews and actually does something about it.

It seems that the frequent customers knew how to cheat the system, and upon arriving, would send one of their group to claim a rare table while the rest of them stood in line to order food. I watched as table after table became occupied by patrons who had arrived AFTER me. This may fly for a casual lunch thing, but certainly wasn't appropriate for a dinner situation. \n\nLuckily once I placed my order, I was able to claim a free table. The margarita I ordered was delicious, but that's the only thing I would come back for. \n\nWhen my friends finally arrived, they had to stand in line for a while to place their order as well. When the runner brought us our food, he did not bring silverware, and we had to get it from the self-serve area at the front of the restaurant. Again...not appropriate!\n\nThe food itself was okay. For the price, it's definitely not worth it. If you're hardcore craving New Mexican food, still not worth it. \n\nI certainly did not feel taken care of, and actually felt pretty duped (both by the restaurant and the familiar patrons).

If you're from New Mexico, this place just might irreparably piss you off. The food isn't half bad, but some of the variations border on sacrilegious, some are just weird. I always picture myself ordering the stuffed sopaipillas (all but unknown outside of NM), but strangely always settle on the crispy, blue corn tacos (arguably among the least New Mexican items on the menu). All told, the real drawbacks are economic (gougey pricing, sneaky, upchargey service), and not culinary. Give it a try, but come by my house later for the real deal. Bueno.", "author": "Joe V."}

Occasionally the meat in my burrito will suddenly be chewy and not as flavorful as i'm used to. It's worth taking the risk though, since when done right, Green Chile Kitchen serves the best burritos in town. Hands down. Just keep in mind that you'll be paying around $12 for one. \n\nOne consistent issue has been them getting the order right when ordering over the phone for pickup. My wife is allergic to avocado and I can't tell you how many times we've called in an explicit \"no avocado!\" order only to come home and find avocado/guac in her burrito. \n\nThey seem to have heard our feedback tho and it hasn't been an issue the last few times we ordered.

I was SO excited to try the new location on Baker/McAllister and finally had an opportunity to do so this evening. I munched on the two tacos plate, and it was beyond disappointing to say the least. The beans and rice were about as boring and bland as a Jonas Brothers sex tape, the tacos themselves (one chicken, one pork) were completely average at best, and the salsa looked tasty, but it had absolutely no kick whatsoever. Unless I'm missing something on the menu (and please, let me know if I am!), I just don't understand how this place is jam-packed with diners every night. \n\nOn the positive side, they have a small, yet nice selection of draught beers on tap. Racer 5 (one of my favorite IPAs), Anchor Steam, Blue Star (Mendocino beer, FTW!) and a few others. They also do have a communal table and their glassware makes you feel as though you're eating inside of an adobe in the middle of the Southwest. \n\nThey have breakfast tacos on the menu, which I've tried in Texas and absolutely loved... so I'll be sure to give those a shot.

I guess isn't a review of the establishment so much as irresponsible SF parents, but there seemed to be a lot of parents letting their kids run wild up and down the aisles and nearly knocking over glasses, trays, etc. I didn't realize this would be the scene here.

We came at 10:30am on a Sunday morning (before the rush!) with 4 other friends and put in our orders. This is where we start deducting stars.\n\n-2 stars for the service\nThe guy at the counter acted like he was a terrible mix of stoned and hungover. I repeated my very simple order (breakfast burrito, steak, mild sauce) to him many, many times and he still entered it wrong on the machine. Of the 6 of us who came, he got every single one of our orders wrong. Dude, your job is to listen to some people who are speaking pretty damn slowly and clearly. Just repeat it as you type it in. NOT HARD.\n\nOtherwise the food is just fine for your Americanized breakfast burrito. My burrito was loaded with soft scrambled eggs, chunks of potato and some steak. Covered in a nice mild green sauce. Nothing fancy or mind blowing. 2 of us paid $25 for 1 burrito with meat and the breakfast soft taco plate (2) with meat. Kinda expensive, but compared to normal brunch it was fine.", "author": "Wendy T."}

Also good were the sopapillas, a certainty in any New Mexican restaurant but a first for me in any Cali eatery, and they were good.  Served hot and a bottle of honey was already on the table for the obligatory filling.   I had the chile rellenos and the chile actually had some flavor to it, it was clearly a New Mexican variety and not the usual Anaheim pepper used in most of the Mexican restaurants here.  \n\nThe not so good - The style; you order, pay and then find a seat and wait for your food to be delivered.  The place was busy and with a line to the door, the food service was relatively quick.  But if you wanted another basket of sopas, or green chile stew, then get back in line.  If you wanted a refill or another beer, the wait is a little better because you only have to wait for service while standing at the bar.  The food; the cheese in the relleno was azadero (I think) or some other type of mexican cheese.  This is not how they are built in NM; try a visit to Chopes for a reminder.  The tamales, were horrible.  They used a bleach white masa that was about an inch-thick all the way around a small mass of green chile at the core.  Every bite was almost solid masa; not good.   The taco was ok; served with a blue corn tortilla, very Sante-Fe-ish.  \n\nCombined with the diffiiculty we had finding a place to park, we will probably not go back.  If anyone does eventually bring an authentic New Mexican restaurant to the Bay Area, we will definitely give it a try.", "author": "Dan E."}

Tacos - hard blue corn shell - were interesting.  The flavors are complex without being muddled - some of the best Mexican-derived food I've had in a while.\n\nThey have an excellent selection of beer on tap ( Racer 5, Ommegang Hennepin featured prominently the night we were there ), though I question their choice of bottles ( do not like Bison Brewing, despite them being Organic and All That.).  They like to do beer floats and have some interesting ice cream flavors to go with.\n\nService was relatively fast and friendly, and the food certainly came out quickly.

There are communal tables as well as smaller group tables and seats along the edges of the room.  Be prepared to WAIT for your table.  Best bet is to hover around tables that look close to finished and hope to snag seats before other people do.  Try not to poach.  GCK seems to attract large family groups with young children-- so don't be too offended by dirty table tops (although the staff does it best to clean everything off) and kids running around under your feet.  It ended up getting pretty noisy while we were dining; so much so that it was difficult to hear someone speaking to me from across the table.  \n\nSERVICE: The girl at the register was really friendly and helpful.  Otherwise no real service to speak of-- you grab your own utensils and water.  The busboys have hawk eyes and swoop on your plates as soon as they're empty.\n\nFOOD:\n***Green Chile Stew ($9 16oz bowl): MMMM so hearty and delicious.  Absolutely hit the spot from first spoonful to last slurp.  There is quite a bit of heat, which I wasn't prepared for, but enjoyed immensely.  Beware if you can't handle spicy.  I asked for sopaipilla (you have the option between that or a flour tortilla) and wasn't impressed.  It was stale, greasy, and smaller than expected.  Wish it had been fresh out of the fryer.\n\n- Blue Corn Flat Enchilada ($13): Got this with ground beef.  It was ok, but not great.  It didn't really have any bold, standout flavors or textures, but I was hungry and it did its job.\n- 1/4 Rotisserie Chicken Dinner ($9): Received a leg/thigh, plus black beans, veggies (zucchini), rice and a shredded lettuce salad.  The chicken was also only ok-- moist but lacking in any flavor.  I liked the rice that came with this dish more than the chicken.\n\nI also got to try a small bite of the green chile burrito (again, meh.  It was super cheesy, but I felt like it was just a \"normal\" burrito) and some of the green chile nachos.  TC and PL were both satisfied with their choices, so I guess my one bite of each didn't really do the dish justice.\n\nOVERALL: Strange that I found the majority of the dishes bland.  Maybe its because my taste buds were so enamored with the green chile stew that they snubbed all other flavors.  Who knows.  All I can say is wow, GCK, your green chile stew was AMAZING and I'd definitely return for that.  However, if the wait is 1+ hrs for a seat, I'd rather just relive my memory of the meal.", "author": "Susanna W."}

At the risk of breaking writing rules & being redundant, I must say that the spices used for the ribs are not like any previous eating experience I have ever had.  Usually, there are 3 or 4 similar types of barbecue sauces that seem to go along with eating spare or 'baby back' ribs.  Not so, with the New Mexican spices used in the rib sauce served @ Green Chile Kitchen.  The ribs are glazed with red chili honey, and the red chili sauce, coming from New Mexico, is served on the side.  Combine the sauce with the meat, and you have a food flavour marriage that will not end in a messy divorce.  In fact, the way the ribs are cooked, they are not nearly as messy as the usual rib fare.  They are not dry, but they are not dripping with grease.  Somehow, in their preparation, they have found a method that makes for a happy medium, sparing you the mess problems often associated with consumption of barbecue ribs.

Heck, she even sent me a link to the menu so that I would know exactly what I wanted to order as soon as I walked in.  After finally making it here I am thrilled that everything she told me was true.  The food is very good and very fresh tasting.\n\nI ordered the Blue Corn Flat Enchiladas made with chicken from Fulton Valley Farms, had sour cream added to the top, and I chose the roasted green chile.  In addition I was curious about the Niman Ranch beef that is used so I ordered a Crispy Taco on the side.  I had a bottle of blueberry Fizzy Izze to wash it all down with. The restaurant was packed in the mid afternoon, but luckily I was able to find a single seat next to the window.  Don't forget to grab napkins and eating utensils on your way to your seat.\n\nWith a crowd of people inside I was expecting a much longer wait for the food, but my two plates were brought to me quite quickly.  The enchilada plate (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/teiDORLx2rFqNabJgUdMgw/l) comes with a simple salad of shredded leaf lettuce and pico de gallo, organic rice and organic beans served mashed (or refried as some might suggest).  The enchiladas are rolled in blue corn tortillas and completely enrobed in a thick layer of melted cheese and the green chile salsa.  I loved the taste of the salsa with the cheese combination and once I uncovered the actual enchiladas nesting inside I found them filled with nothing but moist chunks of braised chicken meat.  The green chile is not spicy but has a very robust flavor to it.  I liked it, but I will try the red chile on my next visit.  I enjoyed everything on the plate except the beans.  To no fault of the restaurant's I simply don't like mashed beans.\n\nThe Crispy Taco (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/j9l4-YL1eT7it5vQN9WtWg/l) looked amazingly fresh.  I don't think I've ever seen a fresher looking taco.  Served in a crunchy blue corn shell my first bite yielded the natural taste of fresh beef.  That's right!  Although a bit oily the beef is mildly seasoned so you can really taste the actual beef.  In the photo you can see a spot of oil beginning to form underneath the corner of the taco shell; that was the oil dripping from the beef.  The red salsa that came with the taco was very mild.\n\nThe prices at the Green Chile Kitchen are slightly on the high side, but when you consider the quality ingredients being used it all levels out.  I was mostly amazed by the fresh taste of the food.\n\nOh, and before I forget ... Thanks Ace!  The Green Chile Kitchen is a real gem and I will be back!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

The soft chicken tacos and blue corn tortias just melt in your mouth and have some really nice flavors to them, however the hassles of this place make it less than perfect and I often have to weigh the benefits of the food with the cost of dealing with the setup.\n\nFirst it generally runs a bit expensive, but I would be glad to pay if the customer experience was more positive. This place always has a huge line and it set up in this awkward way where people stand at the door to order and then have to find their own table.

Also, the food does not come quickly so you are the jerk taking up a seat while other people want to eat. Also, the staff is quite slow and they don't seem to care about the mess going on on the other side of their counter most of the time.\n\nOnce I tried to just take my order out to avoid all of this mess, but the restaurants green policy means they just wrap everything in foil and throw it in a bag.

The chicken was bland as a paper towel. The cheese carried a bit of flavor, but not enough to redeem the dish. The green chile, the ambrosia of my youth, barely registered on my tongue.\n\nWhat a disappointment. What a shame. And then there's this nonsense about not serving sopaipillas until after five? What is this? Is this a New Mexican restaurant or not?\n\nService sucked, too. One of those fun interactions where it seems you're creating an inconvenience for the person operating the register. \n\nThe whole place has a sloppy, listless quality about it that's really disappointing.\n\nFinally, it's a terrible value for money. $12 for a, frankly, crappy enchilada and yesterday's leftover rice? Come on. That money will take you a long way with much more delicious foods in San Francisco. Not  worth it.", "author": "Danilo C."}

Very clean too.  You do go up to the counter to order...no servers (at least for lunch...I don't know about dinner).  \n\nWe got the Blue Bottle drip coffee...a San Francisco thing...it takes about 10 minutes but is worth it.  You have two cups, one over the other, with the top one having some sort of open bottom.  They put a filter and coffee in the top cup, then slowly pour hot water over the coffee and it drips...slooooowly...into the bottom cup.  Makes a delicious cup of coffee (but not too hot).\n\nWe also got the watermelon agua fresca...delicious and, unlike most of San Francisco, you got free refills.  We both sloshed as we walked after drinking coffee AND cup after cup of agua fresca.\n\nI got a sampler plate.  It included guacamole (probably one of the top 3 guacamole's I've ever had), fresh made chips, a sample of ALL of their house-made salsas (4 or 5 of them) and two house-made tamales (your choice of flavors).  I had a cheese tamale and a chicken tamale.  \n\nEverything on my plate was perfect...I don't know how they could have improved on anything.  The guacamole was thick, with a true avocado flavor with a hint of lime and garlic.  All of the salsas were delicious...there is no way I could pick a favorite.  But the tamales...the tamales...I am now ruined...I can't have them anywhere else (except maybe from the famous San Francisco Tamale lady...a whole other review!).

The problem is that it takes a whole afternoon to make and I am almost out of my fire roasted chiles in the freezer. Nobody around here seems to know that New Mexico is a state much less that they have their own cuisine! (I digress..) \n\nI arrived with pretty low expectations, given my obviously snobby chile predilection. Imagine my surprise that they also make fresh sopapillas!! \n\nThe menu had lots of delish looking staples but did I miss the big sopapilla with ground beef, veg and chile that I know and love? \n\nWe went a little crazy and ordered green chile burritos plates (veg and ground beef) queso con green chile, and sopapillas. Here is the play by play:\n\nSopapillas: 5 stars. Perfectly made and served piping hot! \nQueso: 5 stars - REAL cheese and green chiles (that makes it fat-free right?)\nGreen Chile Burritos: 3.5 stars Ground beef was perfect, the squash in the veg one was a good choice but cut too big and could have been sauteed with onion and sweet corn to make it more flavorful. The big chunks were too hot and made everything soggy. Also could use some more Chile smothering! Great rice, BTW.\n\nBut the star of the show: GREEN CHILE. At this point I have to say its about a 3, but I know I will HAVE to go back and sample the stew to know for sure. We ordered hot chile on all items but it would barely pass for mild/medium heat in NM (IMHO). As an ingredient it was good on all the things we ordered but lacked that fire roasted flavor just a little. I am giving this place an extra star just for bringing NM flavor to SF finally and being a walkable mile from my house.

And when some say \"New Mexican\" it doesn't mean a new type of Mexican food with a modern update. NO people. When they say \"New Mexican\" they mean from New Mexico, in the Southwest. It even says it on the restaurant's sign. Capish?\n\nThe breakfast burritos at Green Chile are THE BEST EVER!!! Huge, stuffed to the brim with delicious chile goodness. My mouth waters at the thought. You can also get a veggie version with Soyriso instead of chorizo.\n\nThe rotisserie chicken is absolutely scrumptious! I love getting the 1/2 chicken dinner plate and saving the leftovers for the next day. You can also just buy whole rotisserie chickens to go. It's helpful to call and place your order ahead of time. This is a life saver during busy hours like Friday night.\n\nI highly recommend the Posole soup. It's the best thing for a hangover or when you're just feeling tired, under the weather or in need of comfort. It's spicy, flavorful and loaded with juicy chunks of rotisserie chicken and hominy. A squeeze of lime juice and chopped cilantro on top and you have perfection.\n\nJust like in New Mexico, they give you the choice of adding red or green chile to your meal. Chile is a big deal in New Mexico, and Green Chile's signature chiles do not disappoint. You can even order \"Chirstmas\" and have both chiles added to your meal.\n\nAnother thing I love about Green Chile is that they offer green tea Kombucha on tap. Theirs is refreshing and delicious, much better than getting it from a bottle.\n\nThe restaurant is spacious and family friendly but it can get quite busy on weekends.

He got quite a lot of food for his $9 and thought it was really good.  He'd give it 4 stars.\n\nI, on the other hand, ordered the green chile quesadilla, a side of mashed potatoes, and a watermelon agua fresca.  My total was $19.  The quesadilla had jack cheese, roasted corn, sauteed red onions, green chiles and pico de gallo.  It was $8, two dollars more if you wanted meat.  It was really small and not satisfying at all.  I thought it was quite a rip-off for $8.  And I ordered guacamole with it which should have been 75 cents more but the cashier included it.  I thought that really nice of her until the quesadilla arrived, there was literally 1 teaspoon of guac on top.  If I had paid 75 cents for that I would have felt even more ripped off.\n\nThe mashed potatoes were just OK, they sounded special with green chiles and cheese but they really didn't taste any better than plain mashed potatoes.

It's my go-to, my fall-back, my 'I'm in need of real comfort food' place.  I can't tell you how many times I've eaten here, but it's more than 50 and less than 100.  I love the food.  Excellent New Mexican style eats, and the spicy green chile is da bomb. Fresh, high-quality meats and other ingredients really show through in GCK's preparations. I've never had even mediocre food here.  When they added Torpedo IPA on tap I was over the moon.  So why 4 stars and not 5 you say?  Service.  More often than should be the case, there have been mix ups on orders, slow, occasionally surly, and not so occasionally seemingly stoned staff behind the register.  The register staff  rotate frequently, to the detriment of the overall experience. It's too bad that in the 6 years I've been coming here they haven't been able to get consistently good staff at the 'front of house.'  Of course the same faces have been making the food for the past six years, so it is the same, outstanding, consistently delicious food.  I LOVE this place.  \n\nps -- I do sometimes miss the snug and cozy former space, which was a real refuge on foggy nights.

But its almost the same as confusing Chinese and Vietnamese, and you wouldn't do that, right?  \n\nNew Mexican food features green and red chile - arguably some of the best varieties of the pepper on the planet and Green Chile Kitchen does a great job offering a menu that boasts excellent combinations of both.  The green chile stew is fantastic.  The red chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding.  If you have never had a sopapilla, douse it with honey and enjoy the ensuing tongue-gasm you will have.  Best of all is they now sell frozen chile - 5 lb. bags.  I'll clean one of those up a month.  \n\nThey have a limited beer and wine selection, so while you're there, try the Gruet wines.  They're no Napa or Sonoma wines, but NM still has decent wines of their own.  \n\nThe restaurant is always clean, the staff is always friendly and the restrooms are clean, too, for those of you not quite used to the chile yet!  \n\nOne of my newest favorites in the city.", "author": "Sean O."}

This was the first New Mexican food restaurant I came across other than the ones actually in New Mexico, and I was quite happy to find one since I love New Mexican food. \n\nI ordered a New Mexican Homestyle Chicken Enchilada Plate with Christmas Sauce (Green and Red Chile), and it was pretty darn good! It came with some lettuce, beans, and rice. The chicken was cooked perfectly too very very moist. I think the portions are a bit on the smaller side, but hey, for a person that can't eat American sized portions, this was perfect! I also really liked the sour cream for some reason. It was very rich and creamy, and kind of tasted like cream cheese. \n\nWe came on a super sunny day in the city, and the restaurant had all their windows open. It was nice to feel the sun light in the restaurant while enjoying a delicious meal. \n\nDefinitely coming back again.", "author": "Ayaka S."}

But if you are from New Mexico and travel a good distance (I live on the other side of the city) to get here or are highly anticipating a meal like home, you will be disappointed like I was.  First of all, the organization - wait in line, pay before you eat, then take a number and go to whatever spot you can find on a picnic table and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  No tv's, no atmosphere, just wait for your food at uncomfortable seating.  I understand the concept - it works to promote high turnover if you have limited seating, but for the concept to work , your kitchen has to keep up and theirs does not.  The meal was incredibly slow - 30 minutes to arrive and I was literally flagging down the staff for a box when the appetizer I ordered with my meal arrived.  Not enough waitstaff is another problem, but they have been trained - when I needed silverware and condiments they were nowhere to be found, but when I was at the bottom of my $7 beer, they appeared like magic to sell me another one.  So - minus one star for the manager or owner who doesn't know shit about running a restaurant.\n\nIf you want high turnover great - but you can't have a Chipoltle's atmosphere and have high prices - my second minus.  One of the keys to New Mexico cooking is that it is cheap to prepare.  My dinner consisted of some cubed pork, red chile spice, corn starch, wheat flour, pinto beans, rice, lettuce, tomato and onion.  About $3 worth of ingredients when bought in bulk.  So charging me $35 for the meal is outrageous.  I understand this is the big city and prices are high, but it's still a rip off.  If I am dropping $70 on a meal for two, there better be some frigging table service and a waiter.\n  \nThen the food itself - average.  Red chile was pretty good, on the low end of hot.  The pinto beans were a bit al dente.  The sopailpillas(sp) were too thick, greasy and heavy.  If you are from NM - better than Garduno's, about the same as Tortilla Flats (which is 1/3 the price) and nowhere near as good as Sadie's.  So if you are from NM and want a taste of home, you will probably come anyway and deal with all the hassle.  I would go again and order take out, or try on a Wednesday afternoon with no crowd, but i won;t go out of my way to return.", "author": "Ken P."}

It smells a lot better than it tastes. Yeah.\n\nNot that it's all bad. I recall having bought a burrito to go from there a couple times and  vaguely remember enjoying it as I lounged in front of the TV. However, it must not have been good ENOUGH, since I always seem to gravitate back towards my marinated tofu burrito at Papalote (God bless you), which is also close to my house but not AS close. I figure that if Green Chile is on my actual corner but I've only frequented it a few times then it must be just so-so.\n\nTo give the place a fair review, I actually ate in about a week ago, opting for the New Mexican homestyle chicken enchilada plate with blue corn tortillas and HOT salsa. Having read other reviews of this place, I wanted a sample of authentic New Mexican cuisine, to see if my tastebuds could handle those homegrown chile peppers. The result? Again, not bad, not good. Just ok. And it wasn't even *that* hot. I was kind of disappointed. \n\nIt IS pretty cute and cozy inside, though. And the rest of the neighborhood seems to like this place a lot--it was POPPIN' on a Thursday night! Line out the door. I was confused.

They use real New Mexico chiles and you'll find most of the dishes you'd expect in Santa Fe: sopapillas, green chile stew, et. al.\n\nThe problem with this place, for me, is the spice level.  It's really, really mild.  They only seem to use the mild variety of Hatch chiles in anything, and the variety of spice levels (and ripeness) in the different chile sauces was one of the things I loved most about New Mexico. \n\nHOWEVER, you can buy their frozen, chopped, green chiles to go at a cheaper price than you can typically order them from Hatch through the mail ($8/lb vs. $12/lb).  Thus, while I don't actually eat here that often, I do come all the time to buy chiles to make green chile stew at home, where I can pump the spice up to wherever I feel like.", "author": "Patrick Z."}

Exquisite is the resident crazy hobo outside in a red shiny shortie jacket loudly cursing at the straw statue behind the cashier. Very angry and very schizophrenic. Mission charm, I suppose. \n\nSome say that authentic Mexican food is just about taste and not fancy schmancy presentation. I violently disagree. I was about to keel over and chew on the wooden tables after being stuck in rush hour bay bridge traffic, and I still remember that my plate looked like the vomirrhea of the homeless people outside the heavy wooden doors of this establishment. The 4 corners of my square plate each featured a nice heap of lumpy brown-dark-greenish mash, and at the center was my entree, looking equally depressing. Wop-wop.\n\nThis place lost a star for the disgusting soggy mess they tried to sell me as Chile Rellenos. There's something wrong with enjoying everything on my chile relleno combo plate more than the headlining chile rellenos. And the sides were quite excellent - they had this red finely diced salsa that really hit the spot and was very zesty and the potatoes and beans all outshined the star player. Still not great for the price - I've come to expect good Mexican food in SF at wholesale prices, so $16 for this fugly food seemed unfair. \nBut Bf had the signature green chile pork burrito and was a huge fan, so maybe I just ordered wrong. \n\nBut I actually do plan to return to try out the intriguing dessert menu, so maybe I'll add that star back. And instead take it away for the mythological parking opportunities in this neighborhood.\n\nAmbiance: low key but not comfy. Urban picnic setup and felt kind of cafeteria-style.

What I love about these types of sauces is that it doesn't have that one-dimensional \"spicy\" spice that stings your taste buds and hits you all at once, but is more of an underlying and slowly-developing heat that adds another layer of flavor to the dish.

Our first choices, Little Chihuahua, Nopalito and Ragazza had enormous wait lists, so we thought GCK would be a good option for some fast mexican. Boy were we wrong.\n\nLet me first say that the food at GCK has never been stellar. Their burritos are the best things on the menu. I've tried their soft tacos (gross), salads (yawn) and enchiladas (meh). Each time, I think I'll find some hidden gem but I have yet to be impressed. This time, I went for the veggie burrito and a cup of green chile stew. My bf got the nachos and my friend, a smothered burrito plate.\n\nThe service and wait killed me. We waited 40 minutes from placing our order until it was ready. Let me say that again, 40 minutes. I could have gone to New Mexico and made my own green chile stew. We watched our nachos get fried under the broiler when the cook forgot them and then watched him get huffy when we asked for new ones. When we mentioned our wait time to the girl working the register we got a thanks for waiting and we're doing the best we can. My friend asked for a bag of chips as a courtesy and we were told that she could lose her job if she were to give away free chips. Really? Rude. \n\nOverall the food at GCK is not worth the bad service and wait. Definitely avoid this place after any event in GGP and beware the salty staff. The kitchen is anything but efficient.

Something about the temperature or the air in there or something made the food extra steamy which added a certain asthetic appeal.  \n\nI got the breakfast burrito regular, no meat.  And a fantastic cup of pinon coffee.\n\nThe first burrito that was delivered to my table was gorgeous and steamy, and smothered in hot green chile.  I was almost drooling waiting for my friends' food to arrive before I dug in.  I cut it open and there was bacon inside.  So I sent it back.  \n\nBurrito number 2 arrived pretty quickly along with polite apology.  I cut a piece off the end and it was delicious, and the green chile was nice and hot.  What I really wanted was some nice spicy fresh roasted green chile on the inside, so I cut a little closer to the middle... and what do I find?  (Not green chile) CHICKEN!  Are you serious people?  So I sent that back too.  \n\nBurrito number 3 arrived even more quickly, and this time my order was right.  However, the cheese was cold.  Yeah, not only not melty, but cold.  They could have used velveeta for extra authenticity, and avoided this problem.  Also, the potatoes were a little too hard in my opinion, which I think is because of the type of potato they used.  \n\nI have to say that despite taking 3 times to get my order right, the service was good.

For whatever reason, I block out about how irritating it is to order food to-go from Green Chile Kitchen, yet I keep ordering from here forgetting that it takes 40-50 minutes (after calling in) to get the food. I have to give myself credit, I thought that after Green Chile moved to a bigger place on Fulton, they would change their system and be able to get at least one of our orders right (nope!) or at least have it ready 30 minutes after we call it in. We've tried this experiment at different times of the evening and it doesn't seem to make a difference. \n\nThe odd thing is we order the rotisserie chicken meal which is already prepared. I know this because I have watched them (after waiting at the counter) eventually plop my food from the heating trays into the to-go boxes. It isn't as if they had to actually cook anything while I waited, it is just a matter of throwing a precooked chicken into a box and then ladling beans, rice, squash into containers. And if I'm lucky, occasionally wrapping up a tortilla and throwing a package of salsa into a bag. Why does this take almost an hour to do when there are only 5 customers in your restaurant? \n\nTonight, not only was our order f*cked up (no tortilla or salsa) but it took 40 minutes (from the time we called in) to receive our order. Apparently, there still isn't a way for the staff to check the orders before sending it out but they do profusely apologize each time I have to go back. From now on, we're eating at Delessio and Nopalito, which is about the same price but with much better ingredients.

I guess I enjoy more authentic mexican food. \n\nI order the 3 taco plate with pork. Tacos were alright. I didn't care much for the rice. It tasted bland and just not what i am used to. I wish instead of the veggie mix it came with beans.\n\nHusband got nachos and a steak taco. I have to say the steak in the taco was extremely yummy. Hubby said nachos were alright. \n\nThe place is tiny and it was extremely crowded the day we came. Luckily we scored seats next to their large window. \n\nI did like that they had a place to serve your own water.

And to remove a few stars.\n\nThe more I go there and try the various dishes on their menu, the more blah I realize their food is. Even if it may be healthier then traditional mexican, it's still got to have some good flavor to it. I mean am I crazy for thinking this? Maybe organic/vegan/hipster people dislike flavorful foods? I don't know.\n\nAnd in a city full of restaurants, service is what's going to set your place apart from every other place, and at the GCK this holds true. The service from the kids running the place, and the cooks, is horrible. I mean they just really don't even try. I've had 4 orders IN A ROW messed up now, and none of them were really fixed. I'm talking about simple stuff to, and then when I raise the issue with the little girls working there they get defensive about it. The attention to detail by the cooks is really the thing, since it's them messing up the orders not the girls behind the register.\n\nExample: I got a burrito, and wanted to make it a super burrito. This is just where they add guacamole, sour cream and cheese. I asked for NO guacamole on it, and if I could have it on the side. I get the burrito and there is no guacamole on the side. I asked the girl if it was put inside it, and she said \"If it's a super, then it' got guacamole in it\". Ok, remember I asked for NO guacamole on it? She says \"Oh ya, there isn't any on it\". Not very convincing since you just told me it did. I asked her if she could ask the cooks - they didn't remember. \n\nI asked if I could get a new burrito since now it had been like 20 minutes, it was cold, and we had no idea what was in it. She said the cooks would open it up for me, and if there was no guacamole in it they would have\"no choice\" but to charge me for a new one, or I could eat the now cold one they were about to open. \n\nReally?\n\nSo the cook opens it up, and what do you know - there is no guacamole on it. With a *sigh* I watch them wrap the burrito back up, give me a little side of guacamole and I head home with my cold burrito. \n\nEnd of the story? Pfft no way, I still have a burrito to eat.\n\nSo I get home, unwrap the burrito and start to eat its cold remains. As I get about 1/2 way done I realize that not only is there no guacamole on it, but no cheese or sour cream either! \n\nFor real?!?!\n\nI felt like I wanted to go down there, put them all in a line and then 3 stooges slap everyone!! \n\nSo in the end I got a cold burrito that wasn't made correctly, I paid for something I didn't get, I was given a hard time by the cooks and the girl working there, and had an hour of my life wasted that I'll never get back...\n\nThis sound like a ridiculous story? I've got many more, but hey just go here yourself. Then you'll have an equally ridiculous story to share on Yelp!", "author": "Erik B."}

Their website says \"New Mexico Inspired.\"  I know New Mexican cuisine well and this restaurant unfortunately misses on several points.  Better NM food is based on subtleness.  There is no better dish to begin with than Green Chile Stew---it is easy to over spice and over power the base ingredient and that is what happened here--the potatoes should be soft and the stew meat should be tender and the green chile should not be overspiced and hence the entire dish can shine proudly.  The salsas need more focus and the red salsa needs a slight red chile touch and the other salsas could use more New Mexico inspiration.\n\nThe blue corn enchiladas were not inspired as they could have been.  I asked for the Christmas version but it came out green only.  I was hoping for refried beans and feather-like Spanish rice but neither came out that way.\n\n  The sopaipilla should be large nearly pillow-like object and steamy warm.  Large enough to be more of a bread than a dessert (thought sopaipilla and honey can be quite nice).\n\nOverall the price points were high for this cuisine and the total experience could be uplifted with a few touches in the food department.  I am not sure what \"inspired\" means?  Does that mean one might eat at a French restaurant that is just merely inspired--wouldn't one want a fuller experience?\n\nI wanted the Green Chile Kitchen to be a place to go to beyond my kitchen.

I ordered a pork tamale, instead I got sweet potato, well I can see serving this to a dog perhaps but I feel my pooch would turn it down for a good ol' scooby snack. One of my daughters ordered the homemade tamales, she chose to go with cheese tamales well this place must be in real financial jeapordy because there was not a single trace of anything other than masa.

As for overall taste,  your better of buying from those ladies selling tamales in the Mission, its definitely a much better choice than to eat here where apparently taste is not of any concern.

I think GCK will satisfy any New Mexican's craving for a taste of good food from the Land of Enchantment, I should know, I'm from New Mexico and my mother is Latina from Northern New Mexico.

The seating options are weird, though; you can grab a booth (against the west wall), a traditional table for two (in the middle on the booth side), a bench at the communal table (in the middle on the other side), or a stool at a high shelf (along the east-facing windows).

Man oh man is this worth it. \n\nThe restaurant (if you could call it that) that I had most loathed in my time living in this great city was Cafe Neon. I never thought I would be having such an incredible time in the building, which I had highlighted in my review of Neon as one of the lowest points, being cavernous and kind of formal feeling.\n\nBut Green Chile has done it. They really have. \n\nThe atmosphere is well done. Whereas before the tile floor seemed kind of surgical and cold, the restaurant is filled with warm South of the Border feeling red tones, old dry wooden decor minimally spaced for style across the walls. The columns, bar and tables are thick and strong looking wood. \n\nWe ordered the plato de apertivos, a green chile stew, a Niman Ranch steak Burrito and a Roasted Chicken Burrito. Everything was above average. The salsas were flavorful and out of the ordinary. Our tamales were equally good. The guacamole was chunky and tasted freshly prepared. The burritos were of high quality; we could taste the quality of the meat and the care of preparation. \n\nThey have beer on draught as well for an added bonus. There is something also to be said for the value. This is upscale Mexican cuisine. I ordered the largest appetizer plate, 2 entrees and 2 beers and it came out to a ridiculously affordable 35 dollars. \n\nI can affirm that I will be going back, again and again.", "author": "Jay C."}

More people able to experience the flavorful dishes.

Not what may be their biggest rush.\n\nMy companion and I were able to get a decent place by the window at some bar seats, but unfortunately after several minutes nobody came by to bus the prior diner's plates.

This is both a blessing and a curse.\n\nNow I give it five stars as a vegetarian. In that context, all the meals are reasonably priced for their portions. However, for you meat eaters out there, it is a bit more pricey, hence the $$.\n\nMy favorite here are the burritos. Vegetarian, no sour cream, green hot, smothered in cheese. I would have it every meal if I had the money. But many of the other menu items are just as good. Only once in my long history of frequenting this place have they messed up my order and it was pinto beans instead of black beans, so it was still enjoyable.\n\nGreen Chile does a good job creating an atmosphere. The chili peppers hanging everywhere, the religious paraphernalia, the jars for glasses, and lots of hardwood make for its own feel. The people behind the counter are always friendly, but definitely spacey, so for take out you need to ask sometimes if your food is ready in case it's just sitting there. \n\nThe wait varies based on the time of day you go. During down times, ten minutes is the average, although calling in 15 before is preferable at these times. When it is busy, it can take from half an hour to an hour, so bring a friend or a book in that situation.\n\nThe location is perfect, right off the 5-Fulton, a few blocks from the Panhandle, and close to Divis. Between this place and Matching Half, this corner has completely transformed in the last couple of months into a lively little area.\n\nOverall, a great place to sit and have some good New Mexican food.

This has never disappointed .  Healthy-ish, clean food.  The chicken is reliably delicious, and not dry.  \n\n2.

Often the salad dressing is wrong - they make a bomb blueberry vinaigrette, so when you open your salad and see creamy goop all over...  ich.   Or you ask for it on the side and it's still mixed in, seeping out of the corners of the box.  Once I bit into my burrito (I usually get it with black beans, no rice, meat, cheese, guac) and it was mostly empty inside with sour cream and guac all slopped in there...  really foul if you're expecting a drier burrito, not to mention the color.  Mistakes have mostly been with takeout, and things other than the chicken meal, which is pretty hard to get wrong.  \nThey have some wines, and pleasant people behind the counter.  \n\nLast note - it's not my favorite place to eat in.

This is the first time I have been back to Green Chile since their move. First of all, I love their new location. I think it is just right; the old place was just too crowded. \n\nAs for the food, I had the steak burrito and a side of guacamole. Its really good food to be honest. I really enjoyed it. Nice presentation and it is definitely a notch above your favorite five dollar burrito joint (which usually tend to be in the Mission). Their guacamole is pretty god damn good if you ask me. It is one of the best guacamoles I have had in this entire city. I will certainly be back if only to get some take out guac. The burrito was also really good, and their extra effort in tastefully dabbing on guacamole sour cream and salsa while making it a super did not go unnoticed. \n\nNow lets talk about why I'm giving it 3 stars. Bottom line, the price is just too damn high. I paid nearly twenty dollars for the guacamole appetizer and super burrito! If they could drop the price by just one dollar on every entree I would automatically give it 4 stars. Nonetheless, since I live around the corner, its a nice addition and I will be back, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.", "author": "Jeff C."}

Although the red chile sauce is pretty good, I prefer the green - spicy and flavorful to say the very least. The enchiladas are a great way to bring out the flavor of the sauces as well. I'm pretty stoked to come back and try the breakfast options.\n\nIn terms of the pricing, I guess if you compare this place to Farolito or Cancun, it's going to look expensive, but don't be fooled by the casual setup (i.e. order at the counter, get a table and wait).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-10-02", "description": "I've lived around the corner from Green Chile for two years now (through their move to their new location) and I give them two stars only because every once in a while, I have an extremely tasty burrito there. But it's only two because of the many, many, many experiences I have had there where I have waited forever for a burrito I even called in to order ahead of time and it takes more than 30 minutes even when the place isn't that packed. It's a bit crazy actually, and it seems that even though they moved to a larger location, their cooking line has remained the same size and capacity. \n\nThe other thing is the food. Like I said, every once in a while there is a truly amazing burrito that comes off that line. But it's hit or miss... many times their chicken or pork is really dry (and I'm glad they use organic sustainably raised stuff, another reason for 2 and not 1 star), and often the ingredients are bland or not even what I asked for. Is New Mexican food just wimpy Mexican food? When I ask for hot, I want some heat. Oh, and their salads? I got one a week ago with some supermarket pre-shredded cheese blend, canned beans and dry chicken cubes on the side. Trader Joe's does better.\n\nSo in summation, this place has awesome stuff going for it: location, atmosphere, mason jars, organic ingredients, cool staff. But it needs to live up to its hype: make good food and make it consistently! and if you're doing take-out, make it ready when you say it will be! Why do I keep going back? That mythical delicious burrito stays in my mind as I walk my dog past its doors each day, just like the mythical wave stays in my mind as I paddle out into absolute crap. It has so much promise, and it is local and it is responsible so I will always choose it over, say, Chipotle.

He only had 5 reviews, so I decided to see what he took the time to write about.  In the list, I found the Green Chile Kitchen with a 4-star rating.  Since I know he knows Mexican food, and we used to eat it together in Texas regularly, I trusted his opinion.\n\nOuch.  I thought about giving it 3 stars for a minute becase the food wasn't bad, but then I remember the almost $40 tab...2 stars!\n\nSo, I went with my friend from Dallas, who was also craving some Mexican food today.  I told him about our mutual friend's review and we were excited.  We found the place easily and got parking within a block on the first pass.  Everything was fine.\n\nWhen we walked in, the place was small but nice and had a few empty booths and tables.  There were two people at the cash register ordering so we got in line behind them and began looking at the menu.  We quickly decided to share a small order of nachos.  I wanted the chicken enchiladas, and my friend wanted the steak tacos.  We each got a bottled soft drink.  When the total came to just under $40, I was a bit surprised but shrugged it off thinking that the food was going to be really special.\n\nWe sat down with our number and waited.  First, the nachos were delivered to the table.  We both dug in!  What a disappointment.  My best description would be dorito chips with some refried beans, microwave-melted cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  Not good.\n\nThen, the main courses came out.

Normally I'm pretty bored by this type of dish, but it was actually cooked to perfection, yielding a nice crispy skin and juicy meat. The rice was good and the tortillas (both corn and especially flour) were outstanding. The pinto beans were quite plain and bland, I thought, but not bad. I had the pozole, which I liked a lot - there was abundant hominy and nice chunks of chicken. I was surprised to find that I didn't like the green chile stew, which I had expected to be a stand-out. The pork was succulent but I found the stew to be too soupy and acidic. I had a bite of the enchiladas and was not too impressed - they seemed a bit bland.

I'm only taking off one star because of some inconsistencies I've noticed lately. At least two of the many times I've ordered this stew, it tasted different and not so good.. almost like they added chicken broth or something sweet to it. Not good.

I've been driving by the place for several months now and I've finally made it in and tried the food. Parking sucks in the area, but I've been there twice in three days...a regular has been born. \n\nI'm officially a fan of their Fulton Valley chicken burrito, which comes with your choice of refried or black beans, and red or green chile salsa (SPICY GREEN CHILE, please). The burrito is BIG and comes with salsa and blue corn chips. (If you run out like I do, they'll give you another helping.) The service is great and the prices are good ($7 for my burrito). And, more importantly, the salsas are delicious. I took my husband there today for lunch and he (being the Colorado transplant that he is) ordered a bowl of the green chile stew. It smelled incredible and was pretty damn good. \n\nThey're open for breakfast so one of these days,  I'll have to partake in some green chile breakfast loveliness.

And there's nowhere else to get it but New Mexico. Don't say canned -- canned just doesn't cut it for me. I actually sneaked across the California border once with a 40-lb bag of fresh green chile in the back of my car. The smell was surely gonna give me away at the agricultural stop, but it was my lucky day and they just waved me by! A few other times I've driven back from New Mexico with a cooler full of frozen, fresh roasted. But as the years go by, it gets harder to get my ass back to NM. And ordering it by mail costs more than driving there. \n\nI'm happy to say, Green Chile Kitchen scratches my itch. I think they get theirs frozen, Bueno brand genuine NM chile, shipped in no doubt at great expense. And frankly, I appreciate it. \n\nTheir green chile chicken enchilada plate was loaded with the aforementioned green gold. I ordered mine hot, and while it wasn't the hottest chile I've ever had, it did make my nose run a little. Ah, the nostalgia! \n\nI should digress a moment to mention the other serious nostalgia this place holds for me. I lived in the Western Addition for 10 years, until I was pried from my rent-controlled apartment by an owner move-in eviction. Driving around for 20 minutes looking for parking near Green Chile Kitchen reminded me why I'm so much happier now that I've moved to Oakland.

They were the kind of nachos I make for myself - blue corn tortilla chips, fresh tomatoes, and grilled vegetables, with real cheese, and lots of fresh guac piled high.  Jen had the choose 5 salad (you get to choose 5 ingredients)  It was good, but a disappointing in its size.  For a large salad, it was more of a small.  When it came out, I ordered the house salad to add to it to give it some body.   \n\nThe most painful part of the experience is how slow the line to the one register moves - the line was at least 15-20 minutes long the whole time we were there.  And if you're going to have more than one drink, you should order both the first time around.  I read the entire Guardian while Jen waited in line for our second drink.

I had mine with the mild green chile salsa and guac/sour cream on top.  The potatoes and eggs inside the burrito are cooked to perfection, and  the flavors all come together very nicely.  Expertly prepared.\n\nUPDATE (1/19/07):  I'm baffled by some of the reviews that criticize this place for not serving authentic Mexican food.

The pork. The hominy. The cilantro. Squeeze of lime with tortilla chips on the side. Yum!\n\nIt's been four years, and I have found my fairly comparable Posole at Green Chile Kitchen. Of course I have to admit, I didn't look that hard either. I just thought somehow I would come across it at some Mexican place.... I mean, there are certainly plenty in SF! But alas, I hadn't. So today I typed in Posole in Yelp and up came Green Chile Kitchen.\n\nAlthough Green Chile Kitchen makes their Posole with chicken instead of pork slightly spicy, tender chicken.. it had great flavor and was extremely satisfying. It even came with cute little mini tortillas... \n\n**** Food Story Number 2****\n\nI have a rather interesting relationship with tamales. I never really loved them, but rather I loved the concept. In my mind, how can a corn-meal concoction stuffed with meat or cheese, then steamed in its own husk not be absolutely delicious? The concept of it alone gives me a food orgasm. Perhaps that goes for a lot of porn fantasies.. seems like fun, but if you were to put it into practice, not so much. Everywhere I go, I order tamales. I then say \"why did I get this tamale.. i don't even like tamales.\" ...It's because of the concept. I guess tamales is one of those foods that, if it's only okay, it's not worth eating, but when it's good, it is awesomely orgasmically good.\n\nGreen Chile Kitchen fulfilled my tamale orgasm - FINALLY! I ordered a tamale with cheese and it was moist, fluffy, flavorful. They put a chile in there so it gave it a mild heat, which always helps... with cheese oozing out. \n\nOkay, sorry.

New Mexican food is usually made with lard but the Green Chile Kitchen cut out the traditional lard and uses high quality ingredients.  The Californian influence provides the free range meats and organic veggies.  \n\nThe owner lived in Santa Fe for a while and decided to bring New Mexico back to San Francisco.  The Green Chile is actually flown in from New Mexico, I think they get it from Hatch.  I noticed people on Yelp complaining about the beef being stewed rather then grilled. This cafe does not have a hood in the kitchen so they can not grill meat, instead they use methods like the rotisserie or stew things.  I think they've done a great job of providing a variety of choices given the limits of the kitchen.  \n\nI grew up in New Mexico and have always had a love affair with my Green Chile (a Anaheim looking pepper grown in Southern NM).  The most authentic dish I've had at the Green Chile Kitchen is their Blue Corn Chicken Enchilada, delicious!

I'm not down with the fact that they charge a dollar extra if you want to get an additional Chile sauce... seems a bit high to me. But, it's mitigated by the fact that they ALWAYS have $2 Pacificos! \n\nMy recommendations are as follows (formal, aren't I?): \n   - Super Nachos. These aren't the nachos you remember from your childhood. No Velveeta or other processed cheese foods here. It's not a tall heaping pile of chips, but each triangular tortilla receives individual attention in the way of tender chicken, whole beans, cheese, sour cream, guac and chile of your choice. \n   - Green Chile Quesadilla. Again, not an average quesadilla. There's red onion, corn and green chile to make it super-tasty.\n   - Tamale Appetizer with a Cup of Chile Verde. Tamales were a little cold when they brought them out, but still delicious flavor-wise. I like adding the stew to round out the meal.\n\nLate diners beware, they do close at 9pm every night of the week.

GUARD YOUR CREDIT CARDS!!!!***************\nI went into the new location for take-out on November 5th hoping to find that things had changed with the change in space. Not only did it take 30 minutes to receive the most overpriced skimpy salad with the most bland piece of chicken on top in all history , but...when I was scanning my credit card bill this morning, I found that even though I signed off for $13.03 they charged me for $155.03!!!  That's right folks - they stole $142 from me. Green Chile Kitchen = #FAIL\n\n***1st UPDATE*************************************************************\nSo...After writing this review I got a message from (who I believe is) the owner of Green Chile Kitchen, Trevor Logan.  He wrote to apologize for my experience at his restaurant.  He insisted that he's usually \"a naturally friendly and nice person\" and that as a long time NOPA resident he \"would never, ever want anyone to not feel welcome.\"  He seemed genuinely mortified and sorry so...I went back in.  Maybe I just caught him on a couple bad days.  We all have those, right?\n\nHe wasn't there, but I decided to give it a go anyway because the young lady behind the counter looked up and smiled as I walked in the door and greeted me in very welcoming manner.  She made sure I knew to let her know as soon as I was ready to order and continued working on another person's order.  When I was ready she came over cheerfully and took my order. She was helpful and even made a suggestion that sounded very yummy.  Then it was wait while she completed the other guys order and made mine.  \n\nOnce again the burrito was ample as was the wait.  I used to sling burritos out in Iowa (yup - burritos are EVERYWHERE) and it never took me that long - and I was making some damn fine burritos, let me tell you!  \n\nI got it to go. Went home and settled down.  Despite asking her to make the burrito super hot (I believe I told her to make it burn my mouth, tears come to the eyes, HOT, HOT, HOT, so fiery a lesser woman would want to die, it's so hot\") it was bland, bland, bland. The sad thing is, I don't think she left out the sauce, I just think it wasn't anything special. She had given me one of those little containers of hot sauce, but it wasn't enough to get me through the whole burrito.  Luckily for me I was at home and could raid my own stash of hot sauce.\n\nSigh. After Trevor's sincere apology and the young lady's friendly demeanor I was all ready to rave, but alas I can not.  I will bump up from 1 to 2 stars, though because customer service was great this time. Will I go back?  Maybe, but I'm going to have to try something else on the menu other than the veggie burrito.  Papalote - you're still getting my business for your veggie soyrizzo burrito - Now that's SSSSSSSSSSSpicy! \n\n***ORIGINAL REVIEW***************************************************\nI've gone in twice now. Both times the guy behind the counter (who I think is the owner) was abrupt and rather rude. I understand he has a business to run, but a smile doesn't hurt you and it helps the customer feel welcome so that they want to return. I was hoping he was just having a bad day the first time I went in, but I guess he really could care less about being friendly to his customers.  \n\nThe burritos were standard Americanized fare and it took a lot longer to make than one would expect. I'd much rather go to Papalote. The service is relatively quick at Papalote and while they're always busy they are also always friendly and the food is super yummy and much more reasonably priced.

Having lived in New Mexico for awhile I am addicted to green chile. And while the food is decent overall it is less than satisfying when it comes to fixing the New Mexican food craving--I imagine something akin to methadone for a heroin addict. I had the stuffed sopapillas which didn't quite hit the mark, and the lack of courtesy sopapillas to swap up the food with was disappointing.  The number system was quaint in a Disney sort of way, as that is how a lot of restaurants operate in Albuquerque. I have to agree with the review that said GCK is more Santa Fe than Albuquerque. The best part of this place is the green chile, which is tough to mess up, and left the reminder of why New Mexican food is great.  Will I go back? Do I recommend it? I guess it all depends on how how bad the jonze for green chile is.", "author": "Pablo A."}

Dinner on my bosses tab. I continue to work, alone, subtly drinking my Red Stripe behind the counter when a strange french man in his 40's comes in and begins to harass me. I won't go into detail but I was seconds away from dialing the cops when he ceased asking me things like if I was alone, and what my name was, the quickest fake name I could come to was Melissa, and the bastard finally leaves. I'm now freaked out, exhausted and slightly sad my day is ending in such a way and am pleased that the highlight will be the burrito the bosses promised. All I can do to not feel freaked out is hope that they get here quickly, with the food.\n\nThis burrito DID NOT make up for the weird day my Saturday had become. I took it home with me and ate it alone thinking, why does this taste familiar? And then it clicked. It tastes like food my grandma makes when she, whom is not Mexican nor New- Mexican but learned how to cook AMAZING Mexican food from her mother-in-law, is too tired to cook. Rice, beans some meat tomatoes. Only seasoning, maybe salt. \n\nSo disappointed. A horrible end to my horrible evening. I ate the whole thing reluctantly because I wanted to like it, it was free dammit. The rice was a weird texture, green chili's in the burrito a great idea but didn't stand out or say anything spectacular or stellar to my taste buds. The meat was of course the best thing in the whole compilation. I wondered if plates would be better, enchiladas etc. But this morning find out from the boss that even the plate she ordered was lame.\n\nWonderful idea this place is, horrible execution. As a native San Franciscan, of part Mexican decent who was just searching for some comfort food after a VERY odd day, a tear came to my eyes. I should have just heated a tortilla directly on the burner of my gas stove, made some frijoles and called it a night.", "author": "Niki M."}

Two weeks ago I had a delicious vegetarian burrito bowl and was excited to come back again for the same thing. After I ordered, I was brought the wrong dish so I sent it back. Not that big of a deal - mistakes happen. After waiting 15 minutes for the right order, they finally brought me a bowl with a pile of black beans, a pile of rice, and dry tofu with no seasoning or sauce/salsa whatsoever. The same thing happened another time I went here where they brought me the wrong dish, I sent it back, and then they brought me the wrong dish AGAIN. At this point I was frustrated, since I have gotten this dish many times and know this is not what it looks like. I went up front and asked the chef to add the sauce that usually comes on it. He looked dumbfounded and plopped some pico de gallo on the uncooked tofu so I would go away... Then I asked to speak with the main chef. I explained the situation - that I'm a regular customer and this is not what the dish normally looks like. He seemed confused as well but said he would bring me something better. (Keep in mind the person I was eating with was completely done eating at this point). Finally he brought out a bowl with overcooked tofu and an orange (?) sauce. I'm a regular customer and go there for a specific dish, so when I inconsistently get the dish I actually ordered, it's frustrating and I'll probably stop going here.

Maybe a breakfast burrito, but not a Mission-stylee burrito, per se. \n\nThis IS a spot to get yourself a healthy salad and a bowl of green chile or posole. I've tasted green chile from New Mexico (Frontier Restaurant serves it ALL NIGHT LONG), and I've been to Hatch, New Mexico and left with the scent of green chiles seeping from my pores. But that sort of green chile is the decadant, fatty sort, and Green Chile kitchen tends to cook up California-fied versions of the classic.\n\nI typically order a salad and a cup of the chile. The chile is served with a dollop of sour cream and a warm tortilla. The salad is crisp and garnished with cucumber, tomato and shredded carrots. While sometimes the service is annoyingly slow, the chile is tasty (though, if you're from New Mexico, you may find it a faint replica of the original) and the owners are really friendly. Also, the atmosphere here is clean and inviting - they serve both beer and wine, as well as organic sodas and Mexican Jarritas, and they also offer lovely jarfuls of ice water, real silverware and everything is served on tasteful Heath ceramics. \n\nSo this place ends up somewhere between a restaurant and a take out sort of joint, and somewhere between a healthy California eating spot and a New Mexican outpost. Friday nights, there tend to be tons of families and lots of kids. Either way, when sitting at the bar in front of the window, there's a nice view of its Western Addition neighborhood, and on a sunny day, it's nice to take your chile outside and sit at one of the tables in the sun while reading the paper. \n\nI'd say this is a good place for the 'hood, though not worth a trek by any means.\n\nNote: I don't know who M.S. is, but the above photos of Green Chile Kitchen are actually mine. Sort of funny to find them here.", "author": "Chrissy L."}

So everytime I go into a new Mexican restaurant I haven't tried, I go in with the hesitation, or fear that the food won't hit the spot completely. Combine that with the initial thought that this was going to be a taqueria of some sorts, which around the south bay are a dime a dozen, you may or may not be completely excited to eat.\n\nMan, I was wrong to go into this place with that perception. The food is awesome, actually, let me say that it was amazing. A lot of reviews have said that all the food has just the right amount of ingriedients - and I have to completely agree. And the best part, not only did the food hit the spot, it did not make me feel heavy or guilty...two common feelings that plague you when you eat at a Mexican joint.\n\nSo, what do you come for? The steak burrito with the green chile. It is just AWESOME. Throw in the $2 bottle of pacifico and you have yourself a great meal (BTW the beer is $2 all the time!). Another plus, the food is decently priced and you get a good amount.\n\nFor all you fans of great food, this is definitely a place to stop by and check out.

Your chances of getting a stellar vs. awful burrito are roughly equivalent. When it's stellar, highlights are the shredded pork super burrito with remarkable guacamole.

Black beans in your burritos are integral to your business model. Please plan accordingly.) \n\nAdditionally, disorganization tends to reign supreme here. The line/ordering set up changes more than Puff Daddy's name, the divvying-up of employee tasks appears to be governed by musical-chairs and I've often found myself a block out the door before I'm run down by an out-of-breath employee explaining that he gave me the wrong take-out order.     \n\nBottomline: Green Chile is new, so clearly a few kinks are still being ironed out.

They import their green chilis from NM. And they grill their burritos, too. Their burritos perfectly meld all those components into a gooey, tasty amalgamation of pure bliss.

Robyn got the Posole Stew topped w/ cilantro & onion served w/ corn tortillas & lime squeeze and we shared a side of guacamole chips that was fresh and delicious. Service was prompt and polite. I dug into their new Chile Relleno plate with vigor. As I savored the food I realized that this was \"New Mexico's\" cuisine, not truly Mexican. But closer to Mexican than Tex-Mex. I really enjoyed the chili rellenos and part of the experience was the New Mexican \"Hatch\" chilis they were made of. Earlier, Robyn suggested that I should try both red and green sauce on the chili rellenos. I did, and the verdict is thumbs up on the red sauce, being that it has a rounder and more savory flavor than the green sauce. But I'm not generally a fan of green sauces, nonetheless, it's one of the better green sauces I've eaten. The beans were excellent and it played well with the dish.

The pasole soup is perfect on a cold day and the burrito and enchiladas are super yummy and filling yet never greasy.", "author": "Sara W."}

I went here with a group of 4 and we were not disappointed.  It's a very casual place.  you just go in, look at hte menu, walk up to the counter, oder, sit and they bring your food to you.  I got the blue corn enchilada plate christmas style, because I wanted to taste both the red and green chile.  It was very good.  It's not a favorite, but i wouldnt mind eating it again.  My friends opted for burritos and quesadillas which they said was very good as well.  i think what i like most about this place is that they are you typical mexican taqueria.  they offer a lot of different things on their menu.  they also have mimosas which were great! each plate was ranged between $7-$15 depending on what you ordered.  not a lot of items were over $10. I would also hold on the dessert and save it for their sister restaurant which happens to be a on the other end of the block (Chile, Pies, and Ice cream).  They have very good desserts.\n\nIt's not a place id go all the time, but defintely a recommended place to eat if youre around the area, Parking is dreadful around this area, so be prepared to either walk or cirle the streets for a bit.", "author": "Roxanne E."}

Looked up GCK and found they were both open early AND had vegan options for a breakfast burrito!  Yay.  My dude and I ordered 2 burritos, a side of chips and guac and one cup o' coffee.  \"$30?!!!?\"  we both asked when the guy gave us our total?  He tells me that the guacamole is $7.95!!!!!!  When he realizes I just wanted a side he lowers it to $2.50 plus a buck for chips...  As opposed to what?  An entire plate of guacamole?\n     $25 later we sit down still a little perplexed.  My dude grabs the receipt from the register when the attendant wasn't looking because he didn't give it to us.  Turns out he charged us both for meat breakfast burritos($9 each) even though mine was vegan and had neither eggs, cheese, nor meat in it.  That's what I get for asking for tofu instead.  These aren't the type of burritos that leave you with leftovers either.  Also, my coffee was $2 for one pre-brewed mug he filled behind the counter.  No refills.\n      I left feeling sadly bamboozled.  For $25 I could have bought enough groceries to make breakfast for myself and my 5 roommates.

Unfortunately, it didn't taste like Neiman. Although I had the good-for-you feeling that I was eating better quality beef, I didn't get the full benefit of eating it freshly grilled. The beef was pre cooked and in a broth, tasted like chipped beef or beef stew meat. If I went to a steak house featuring Neiman Ranch steaks, then I wouldn't want them to cook my steak before I arrived. Anyway, the taco had a nice red chile with an earthy flavor to it, along with lettuce. I gave the taco 3 out of 5. The 3 was a stretch. The green salsa in the little cup was too acidic. I was so disappointed given the idea behind the name (greenchilekitchen). \n\nHere is what I really like about the place. They have rotisserie chicken, although it wasn't spinning, I'll go back to try it with a glass of fine wine, since they have a nice selection. Did I mention that I really like the decor?

My boyfriend asked for a black cherry blue sky drink and i asked for the blue sky lemon lime drink. She told my boyfriend sorry we don't have black cherry as a blue sky but have some other kind of black drink(holding up a IZZIE ) . I told her no its the black cherry blue sky. She then proceeded to tell me and my boyfriend that he had apparently told her a IZZIE. Which, a. boyfriend hates IZZIE's and b. she had the nerve to tell us what he had apparently said. I heard him say Blue Sky and he knew what he said as well. \n\nThat was just the first part of our awful service.

I told her i have worked in customer service for the past 8 years and i have never once ever treated a customer the way she treated both of us nor gave so much nasty attention.

I even have my NM friends bring and ship me green chile so I can keep it in my freezer year 'round.  I was really excited about Green Chile Kitchen being able to offer New Mexican food with green chile.  I kept my expectations low and that was a good thing.  It's pretty pricey for what it is.  The service is okay.  The chile is Bueno Green chile, the kind you find in the frozen section in NM, and most New Mexicans will scoff at it, somewhat deservedly, because it just doesn't have the same flavor as others.  But as a far away business I can see why this is one of their most viable sourcing options.  But after going to Just for You Cafe the other day, I can honestly say when I need my green chile fix, I'm going there, NOT \"Green Chile Kitchen\".  Green Chile Cafe-you are kind of messing up.  If you want o see how green chile is really suposed to be, like in NM, go to Just For You Cafe and try theirs, and get a clue.  Any fool can get Bueno chile, toss it on some mediocre NM recipes, and charge 30% more than the average mex-new mex fare is worth for the gimmick.\n\nAfter deciding GCK was a bit of a let down for a NM palate, I  took my girlfriend down the street to their sister-business  for a pie-shake.  While there I saw Frito Pie on the menu.  I love frito pie and it's pretty hard to mess up.  After shelling out a ridiculous amount of money ($8+) for what is a fast-junk-convenience food in NM and should be priced accordingly, I received a little frito pie that DIDNT HAVE ANY CHILE ON IT.  It's a NM dish.  New Mexicans put green or red chile on everything, and I don't think I've ever had a frito pie in NM without either red or green on it.  thanks, but I could have cut open a bag of fritos, dropped some plain beans, lettuce onion and tomato and cheese on it at home for about $2.  Which is what Ill be doing next time.\n\nA+ for offering it.  D+ for pulling it off.  D- for charging so much.  F- for no chile on my frito pie.  D for the chile in general.  Shame on you for being so lazy by offering out of the freezer Bueno green chile, not doing much if anything to it, and charging up the ass for it.", "author": "Uuri K."}

I ordered the Pork something or other burrito which I have to say was the worst burrito I've had maybe, ever. I can't believe a restaurant in SF would serve pork like that. Not at ALL tender, yet still overcooked. It seemed like they just threw some pieces of pork and cooked it real quick. Terrible. There was also very little inside the burrito, just a lot of tortilla. Also, potatoes in a burrito? Really? I made the mistake of getting it Christmas style (1/2 red 1/2 green chile) which also ended up costing an extra $1. I say it was a mistake because the green chile was actually decent, but they already barely put enough on and then the other half was what was supposed to be red chile, but sure looked (and tasted) like canned enchilada sauce to me.

I walked the two blocks from my house a bit apprehensive after reading some of the Yelps and fresh off the disaster that was Tango 20!, yet with high hopes and nervous titillation, for I am a burrito addict.  I'm understandably anxious for a decent taqueria to arrive in this area, a neighborhood literally starved for decent food options.  Well, I was pleasantly satisfied with the product here: definitely a bit expensive and a little on the small side, but its quality ingredients, including Niman Ranch stewed beef, New Mexican green chiles and a nice avocado tomatillo sauce, help to pull off a very tasty and unique southwestern-style burrito.  Don't come here when you're looking for a ginormous Mission-style zeppelin to sate your ravenous hunger, but instead when you are prepared to try something a little different and you shall find happiness my sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Went again last night. I think I might become addicted to this place (or any other decent burrito place near my house) The size was substantially larger this time, more along the lines of a Mission behemoth, but squatty and fat.  Pretty good stuff.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Tried the green chile stew the other night.  It was a little runny for my taste. Will stick with burritos from now on.", "author": "Rick H."}

I finally took the whole family in.  After their first few bites, my 10 yr old and my husband looked at me like I had done something wrong.  I asked them if something was wrong with their food and didn't like it.  Umm, not quite.  They actually accused me of keeping this place a secret from them.  (thank Yelp, that I had proof that I was planning to bring them here but nobody listened to me).  They really liked it because they got their enchiladas the way they like them.  There are different ways to make enchiladas.  This place serves them up the two main ways you can get them.  Rolled and baked in a pan like a casserole or rolled and then cheesed and sauced and placed under a broiler until the cheese melts so that the tortillas keep their shape.  That's how the men in my family like them but when I cook I make them the way I like them--tortillas get soft and mushy.\n\nMy 8 yr old had issues with the tortillas and the sopapillas.  This kid knows his carbs.  He is right though, it is hard to get good corn tortillas around here.  The ones here are too chewy.  It makes me think it has something to do with the masa/flour ratio that is being used.  Then the dough to the sopapillas could use some lemon juice, vinegar or baking soda to lighten up the batter.  It is suppose to be as \"light as a cloud\" so that it really puffs up into little pillows.  Also, when they are deep fried, you've gotta give them the space to puff up.  That's why they are called sopapillas.    \n\nWe all plan to return.", "author": "Mary A."}

This is not a local neighborhood spot.  This is a cash cow.  The chili you get is in a tiny little container.  If you want more, it's an extra cost unlike the awesome salsa bars where you can load up anywhere else.  My husband ordered the $11 for 2 hard taco platter.  The menu state for $3 extra you could a third taco, but  since we usually find 2 tacos (in the Mission) to be way more than sufficient, he decided on 2.  But believe me, he was really considering 3.    They tasted great, but were the size of a quarter.  He was still hungry since he only ate 2 quarter sized tacos and didn't want to fill up on rice and beans and went to the front to request a 3rd taco for the $3.  Mind you, we spent $30 at an order at the counter Mexican restaurant with food that tastes no better than Pancho Villla or La Taqueria in the Mission on two quarter sized tacos and 1 count, 1 enchilada (my order) and some rice and beans.  They said that they could not give him the extra taco for the $3 and would have to charge him $4.35.\n\nWhat?  We will be heading out to the Mission for our next venture into tacos.

We had found information on this restaurant while researching places to eat while in San Francisco.  We couldn't believe our luck when we found this restaurant that 'specialized' in New Mexican food.  Being a native from New Mexico, it is always great to find these rare gems and we have never been disappointed in other cities in which we've found restaurants that serve authentic New Mexican food ( i.e Carlitos in Las Vegas, NV).  So we were quite excited to find this place.  Boy did we get let down!  We walked in and saw that it was an order at the counter type of restaurant, which was fine, nothing wrong with that. The crew seemed to be too busy texting and watching TV to be of any help with recommendations or actually even taking our order.  We finally ordered.  I ordered a burrito, Christmas style and my daughter ordered the stuffed sopapillas and an order of sopapillas.  The food took a long time to be ready and when it came it did not look very appealing. We assumed it was the chef that served us and told us that utensils were 'over there'.  So we got up and got utensils.  The food was lukewarm; the flavors of both the red and the green chile were not authentic tasting at all.   But worst of all my burrito actually tasted like it had been microwaved and was possibly not made that day.  The rice seemed old and clumped together and the beans were not fresh either.  The only exception was the sopapillas, which seemed to be the only thing made to order.  What topped off our wonderful (read sarcasm) experience at this restaurant was the staff.  What I believed to be the owner was scolding a worker in front of the restaurant in front of guests, the rest of the staff was hanging around the bar watching television and visiting with each other.  Not once were we checked on or served in any way. Our expectations were high for the food and it was sad to be as disappointed as we were hoping to have this be our go to place when in San Francisco but unfortunately we will probably never go back.

The owners' love for New Mexico comes out exquisitely in the earthy, colorful decor and the cozy environment that it creates.  The wood bar is beautiful, the many windows and high ceilings have an expansive effect so that one can feel cozy and at same time not cramped- a rare combination in the San Francisco food scene.  There are booths, community tables, a little bit of outside seating for dog lovers, and a kid's style bar in front of the windows. It actually does a remarkable job of feeling like a family place without isolating people who are just there for a beer or even on a date. My partner and I have a friend who lived in the mountains near Albuquerque and is an expert on good New Mexican food.  He came into town to visit recently.  We took him to Green Chile Kitchen and he asked to go back the very next morning- very impressed.  I whole-heartedly recommend this place.

The meat was tender, just not enough of it. After trying the plato de aperitivos, I would recommend going with the green chile queso, a warm cheesy chile dip that's good spread on everything. The quac was good, but wasn't spicy enough, and the salsa were pretty good. I appreciate that G.C.K. is using natural meats. The quarter chicken dinner came with a large salad and salsa. The chicken was tender and had a typical rotisserie style flavor. \r\nDidn't really find anything to rave about, but the people were nice, the space is clean and pleasant, the prices are very reasonable (except for making you pay for salsa), and if it was in my hood, I might hit it up once in a while.

Kind of an unusual combination.\nAn important thing to know is that if there's a large line at the register when you get there, you might want to go elsewhere unless you don't mind sitting around for a long time (like half an hour) waiting for your burrito.\nIf there isn't a long line, though, the food is pretty tasty, .  It's the closest thing to authentic New Mexican-style that I've had yet around here.  Burrito tortillas are steamed, but then the entire thing is grilled after it's finished.  Unfortunately, the grill isn't used for much else, so you don't get the delicious extra flavor the grill at your usual taqueria will contribute to a grilled tortilla.  The Niman Ranch steak in my burrito was on the tough side, which was too bad.\nTacos and tamales are excellent though.  The green chile stew was relatively unremarkable.", "author": "Don H."}

It is a treat!\n\nBreakfast burritos and tamales with champagne or mimosas on Saturday or Sunday are a great way to start the day!  Everything is very fresh and delicious.  I'm a big fan of their posole, and their roasted chicken is excellent!  Their soft tacos are good, too, with the best corn tortillas.  Good selections of salsas and beer.  Portions are big, so there's always leftovers.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the size, but it can't be helped.

They just moved around the corner, so we decided to grab a bite from a local grub spot. SO GLAD we came across this place. Very clean inside and the service is incredible. Every employee there had a smile on their face, and were clearly excited to serve you (which is rare nowadays). There was no wait, so we walked right up to the counter and placed our order. I ordered the Stuffed Sopaipillas with Carne Adovada (red chile pork) and a margarita. We didn't have to wait long for our food, and they brought it right to our table- still steaming, which is always a good sign. And normally I don't really care how my food is presented, as long as its good...but, the first thing WE ALL noticed when our plates came was how perfectly placed everything was on the plate, even the refried beans were in a perfect little pile, and not \"slopped\" all over the place. I was very impressed. And the icing on the cake: it was probably the best Mexican food I've ever had. I usually can't eat much (ie: one taco and a few bites of rice and I'm stuffed), but I cleared my plate and probably could have licked it clean. If you're in the area, I highly recommend this modern, cafe-style Mexican joint. It's small, but there are plenty of places to sit and the service is outstanding. I'm definitely coming back!!", "author": "Ashlee M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-09-26", "description": "UPDATE: I stumbled in here on a Sunday morning hung-over and purchased a breakfast burrito.  It wasn't the biggest brekkie rito out there, (see El Castillito) but it was damn tasty.  Hot, with gooey cheese, bacon, freshly cooked eggs..none of that microwave BS, and potatoes.  Plus some killer chile -- the life blood of this establishment -- that was mild and still pretty f'ing hot.  I've got a good tolerance for this stuff and it still had heat, so watch out on a touchy and alcohol-abused stomach.  Anyways, BOMB. Go eat one, even if you're not hung over...it's probably still good, I'm not sure, alcohol makes everything better.\n\nMy name is Josh, and I am a burrito-a-holic.  (HI JOSH).  When my roommate and her friends told me they were going to a Mexican restaurant and asked if I wanted to come along, I was apprehensive.  I had just gotten back from the gym and wasn't really looking to stuff my belly with burrito lovin'...and I knew, based on my DISEASE, I would do just that if I was taken to a taqueria.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by Green Chile Kitchen's fresh, organic and...dare I say, lighter menu?  I got the crispy taco plate with ground beef and made it 'super' for an extra $1 (which added guacamole and sour cream to my tacos).  I was sold on this place the second I bit into the thin crunchy blue-tortilla exterior of my taco and got a mouthful of beef (wait, what?).  Ground beef is usually pretty 'meh', but this ground beef had character.  It was all like...telling my mouth jokes, and whispering sweet nothings into my taste buds.  Add the mouth-watering food to the atmosphere of this place, mellow-laid back-chill-etc, and the $2 pacificos which are proudly advertised as \"$2 every day\" and all the time, AND the fact that I haven't even TRIED their breakfast burrito or super burrito...basically, I just found a regular spot to add to my rotation.

They are a new restaurant, and probably still working out the kinks, but they are doing super well.

I was hoping for more selections on the breakfast menu - they only have one - but I'm told New Mexican food doesn't really do breakfast. Anyways, the only breakfast item, a breakfast burrito was excellent. I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for one. It's a bit pricey for a burrito, ($5.95, +$1.95 for bacon, steak or chicken) but the food is organic and meat is top notch. The restaurant itself is open and airy, very comfortable.  I'll defiantly return to try dinner and the next time I'm craving a healthy breakfast burrito.", "author": "Michael A."}

I have literally gone into the city just to eat there, turn around and go home.  I enjoy the atmosphere, the crowd (which includes families, young hip San Franciscans, and everything in between), and of course, THE FOOD! I have never ordered anything I did not love: the soups, tacos, quesadillas, and my favorite: the burritos.  I am a vegetarian and love the fact that I can add tofu to my burritos for some extra protein and it also adds plenty of flavor.  The grilled veggie burrito is my favorite meal.  I add hot green chiles to anything I order, and I could literally eat it with a spoon.  I am a huge fan, and if you want a real treat the breakfast burritos are delicious!", "author": "Kit D."}

There were two of us and together we paid 27 buckaroos for two breakfast burritos and two coffees and an orange juice. What a rip. The real ripoff is when they add \"Christmas sauce,\" and then they add that for a nice little upgrade price. When  I ate there, the owner asked me how everything was.  I told him I thought it was too expensive, but he said that he has to pay to fly in the green chile's from New Mexico and they have to buy the Niman ranch bacon, etc.  The chiles tasted freeze dried and the Niman Ranch bacon was barely even used in the burrito and kind of burnt. The food was tasty (despite the lack of bacon) but the price is really lame. If I wanted to pay through the nose and act like a yuppie, I would go to the NOPA where it's at least gourmet. \n\nOtherwise, it's Papalote's for me.\n\nI hate stingy ripoff whitewashed burrito places.

I had heard a lot about Green Chile and was really looking forward to trying it, especially given my deeply rooted Texas taste buds.   I was so excited that I finally found myself in the area on a Saturday afternoon that I decided to overlook the un-cleaned tables to try it out for brunch.  \nI ordered the breakfast tacos with chorizo and my companion ordered the regular tamale plate.  The tacos were nothing to write home about.  I could of made the same thing at home with a short trip to the mission o for the chorizo.  In fact, I didn't even need to make that trip to the mission because the sausage on my plate didn't resemble chorizo at all as it was so darn bland.  Definitely, not worth the fat or calories.  The tacos had a small dollop of pico but was absent of any real salsa and avocado, which I find offensive.\nThe offense became even stronger as my companion kept eating his tamales looking for the meat.  I have never in my life ever seen such a small amount of meat in tamale before.  It had to be less than one once (not an exaggeration).  I've eaten tamales throughout central and have never seen such a thing so I'm not sure where Green Chile's inspiration is coming from, other than trying to maximize profits.  They should just label it as masa.  Oh, and that brings me to another point.  This lovely meal without drinks or apps totaled 24 bucks.  Really? \nI firmly believe that this place is popular only because there are not all that many places to frequent nearby.  So my word of advice to all the hipsters keeping this place afloat.....get on the Muni and expand your horizons.", "author": "Maria R."}
