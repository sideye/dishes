Between the terrible service (20 mins to even be talked to) and the overall lack of empathy for anything resembling a customer, human beings dont deserve to be treated as poorly as the bouncer treated us. If he has a job after all of what\n he tried to get away with, soda popinski cannot be in business anymore. the bar must be put out of the business and anyone who has worked for them must not work for them again. One of the worst experiences i've ever been part of. Could not think of a worse establishment to give money to, clearly anyone who hires bouncers like that were working Friday evening should not be given our hard earned money.

I then asked the bartender if I was still cut off he told me yes with a smirk on his face. This is the first time, I had a ugly experience at this bar and that bartender was a true ass. I would get it if I was sloppy drunk and bothering the women if that were really the case I would have expected the door man to escort me out.

There are some gross/bad options (e.g. tabasco/tequila shots), but that's all part of the wheel's allure.  Not to brag, but I've won the champagne bottle twice. \n\nThe bar is named after one of the bosses in Punch Out on NES and there is a vague video game-themed ambiance. To that end, there's a couple of Nintendo consoles set up in the back if you're feeling nostalgic. \n\nThe wheel alone has landed Soda Popinski's on the low-brow Nob Hill bar tour that I give to SF visitors -   right after the Tonga Room, right before a bacon-wrapped street dog on Polk. \n\nThe bar is usually pretty packed on weekends, so I try to get in, spin, and get out as soon as possible.", "author": "Ryan D."}

I say this because my friend span the wheel for her birthday and she got a bottle of champagne and the bartender (who was not even looking) claimed that she didn't spin that herself and poured her a shot of vodka with lots of tabasco sauce in it. After she drank this, she almost threw up from all that tabasco! \n\nAnd to add salt to injury, we came back the second time and saw that people were moving the wheel in front of the bartender and he was honoring these new wheel spins. And when my group span it again, we got the Mule Kick and he claimed that we should tip higher since its a pricier drink. I get that we must tip, but NO NEED to force people to do shit. After we tipped only 3 dollars, he was rude to us the whole night. \n\nI don't mean to make a BAD review from a few sad encounters. I have been here for the 2 for 1 deals and I really enjoy the music here, but I will avoid this place as long as this douche bag bartender works here.

However, in the original arcade version of the game, he was supposed to be named Vodka Drunkinski (it was the Cold War), but Nintendo of America decided to change it around the same time Mike Tyson endorsed the home version.\n\nSo this bar could've been called Vodka Drunkinski's, but times have changed. But still, inside the bar, is a slice of 80s Americana. \n\nThere are plenty of TV sets, set up with video game consoles, old and new, with mostly sports games, but there a handful of old gems like Bad Dudes. Perfect game for this bar.\n\nThere's a wheel, and for 11 bucks you get to spin the wheel, and the bartenders give you whatever shot you land on. Some are amazing, and you wished you remembered what was in them. (There's one section called 3-1-5, and there's a picture of Sean Connery from the Hunt for Red October. I don't remember this movie besides how funny it is to hear one of the most famous Scottish actors ever playing a Russian submarine captain. What is this cocktail?), and some are a lot of bomber drinks, like a rum and tequila bomb in Sprite. One option is a bottle of champagne. Or, you can \"So a shot of turkey for freedom, and spin again for AMERICA!\"\n\nThe music is classic American songs, but way over the top. They'll play 80s Christmas carols, and the bartenders will throw napkins in the air so you can pretend it's snowing. \n\nThe only downsides are that the lines are a little long for the wheel, and sometimes you have to blow into the cartridges for the game systems. Definitely a bar to visit in San Francisco, especially if you're a fan of retro games, or want to relive the glory days of a decade that you probably weren't alive for. \n\nMy only suggestion would be to have game tournaments on a few nights a month, but drinking versions.

There is one narrow walkway with hordes of people blocking the only access way to the restrooms.  This has to be a fire hazard.  \n\nThe video game area is beyond tiny.  I was expecting multiple consoles, played in different rooms.  I did not foresee a single television with one guy playing by himself for an hour.  That was the first disappointment.  \n\nThe second let down was the wheel where you spin to see which drink you will be getting for the price of $11.  If you get the PBR, you would probably feel the most ripped off.  $11 for a can of beer is just outrageous.  \n\nIf you like small bars and large crowds, this place is for you.", "author": "Victor L."}

It's not directly on Polk, but still within walking distance of all the other Polk St bars. It's a casual, semi-divey bar. Pretty small space, so it gets crowded/sweaty. The best part about this bar is that they have video games in the back LOL. You can play Mario cart while sippin away! (i.e. drunk driving -- not actually drunk driving but the drinking game drunk driving involving Mario Kart LOL. Don't drink and drive otherwise kids). The music selection is fun and they play a lot of hip hop. They were playing Mean Girls on the TV screens the other night I was there. Drinks are typical of SF bars -- pricy, but what can you expect right? They have a wheel that you can spin for drinks! $11 a pop. They have some nasty drinks on there and some great ones too, but that's the name of the game ya know. LOL. I got the cement mixer once. Did not know what it was. Hesitated. Waited too long. Found out the hard way why they call it the cement mixer. LOL NEVER AGAIN. ALWAYS DRINK WHATEVER YOU SPIN ASAP, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. You can also win a bottle of champagne. The chances are slim but possible. Also a boot full of Moscow Mule. \n\nOverall a very chill bar and a very fun atmosphere. We always come here when we go out on Polk St. It's a bar hopping staple in my books!", "author": "Amy T."}

It's clearly the best thing in the bar and it's the reason we even come here. Some of the choices include:\n- bottle of champagne\n- mule kick (a \"boot\" of Moscow Mule)\n- 4 shots, bartender's choice \n- shot of fireball + free spin\n- vodka drunkenski (cup of vodka)\n- two pickle backs \n- AND MORE!!! \nTrust me, you want to try for the champagne or the mule kick. You can share your drink with your friends, and they will love you for it. \n\nThe second best part of the bar is the gaming in the back. People play old Nintendo games like Mario Kart, but don't come here just for the games on weekends... Since there are so many people, it might take a while to get your turn on a controller. \n\nSoda P's is actually a pretty small bar, and it gets very crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. If pushing your way through drunken people is not your thing, you might want to avoid this place. The atmosphere is loud, dark, and sweaty, but everyone is also incredibly friendly.

Oh sure, I'm only in my mid-30's, but as you get older there starts to be a vague notion that one day there will be an end.  These days, I'm starting to think about my Drinking Legacy, and I fear that if the book was written on me today I'd be liable for one huge charge:  I lived 100 yards from Soda Popinski's and I only went there how many times?  Gather ye Rosebuds.  \n\nAdmittedly, I am a big fan of the folks who brought you Soda Popinski's.  You might know them from Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, Tonic, Bullitt, Jackalope, Lightening Tavern and the now defunct Royal Tug Yacht Club.  They have a magic touch when it comes to creating good spaces and good themes.  \n\nSoda Popinski's takes it's name from a video game character.  Are you familiar with mid-80's Ninetendo?  8-bit Graphics, but games that were fun and iconic.  I was a 6 or 7 year-old when I got to play Mike Tyson's Punch-Out for the first time at a neighbor's house.  Soda Popinski was a Soviet (they were Soviet then) fighter.  Fun Fact:  He was supposed to be called Vodka Drunkinski, but someone realized that would not be good for the Cold War.  Probably wise.  ... I digress.  The name of the bar is apropos given one of the stand-out features of this bar is a ready selection of Nintendo, Super Nintendo and N64 games and a big TV and game area.  In case you're thinking this out, that means Mario, Zelda, Mario Cart, Goldeneye ... record-scratch, yep, late-90's Goldeneye where you could play with four people on one screen back before the current game systems basically allowed us to become serial killers.  (Fact)   Some of these games are additively fun.  When we were little kids, the sheer joy of the games was enough of a thrill.  Now, we get to add booze.\n\nNostalgia in the face of Impending Legacy.  This is also a good bar.  While it has novelty because of the games, it is not a bar that should be defined by that quality alone.  In my dozen trips or so, I've played games two or three times.  And trust me, it isn't a gamer crowd.  This is attracting the same crowds as R Bar, Wreck Room, Zeki's, Playland, McTeague's, Harper and Rye, etc.  I come for the 2-4-1 Happy Hours.  5-7pm is 2-4-1.  They have Total Domination on tap, so that works for me.  But, I'm increasingly taken by good cocktails lately, and they have a few winners which at 2-4-$11 isn't bad.  (Aside - 1-4-$11 is a 'lil steep)  I recommend the Spicy Grapefruit Margarita, particularly if it is made just right.  They have a few good things here that are worth exploring.   Oh yeah, and they have a Wheel of Drinks.\n\nLegacy.  Once upon a time I got excited as a kid when I went over to a friends house and they had the cool new game system.  I went home excited, but not a happy camper, because I had no Nintendo.  But guess what, Bobby doesn't live a next door to Soda Popinski's in the Heart of the Funnest Neighborhood in America.  I think I won.  But, Gather ye Rosebuds, because they'll be writing our Drinking Obituaries soon enough.

The trivia night is organized well, and although my team didn't win any prizes, we still had a great time. Parking can be tough in this area, but we were able to snag something close on a Tuesday night.", "author": "Amy D."}

Fun, right? The questions were pretty easy and the time between questions and rounds was really long - they were either really trying to extend the game to keep people drinking, or the poor game master was overwhelmed trying to run it. We had fun playing along, though we weren't an official team. We stuck with beers, so I can't attest to the quality of their cocktails. They do have an interesting \"Wheel of Misfortune,\" where you spin the wheel and you drink whatever you land on. Sounds like a neat idea if the mystery drink was cheap, but if I'm paying $11, then I'll pick my drink myself, thank you.\n\nThe theme here is Russian/Eastern Europe and the decor matches well.

For most people, beating the wheel means winning a bottle of champagne. Some people are extremely good at getting this every single time, so it definitely seems like a skill that can be practiced to make perfect!\n\n* This place is pretty popping Thursday-Saturday and is good for big groups. Be warned that it does get pretty noisy so you might want to avoid this place if that's not your thing. It's possible to find seating but don't count on it. \n\n* The crowd here is mostly young-mid twenties. Not super preppy but also not very hipster.\n\n* Pro tip: Avoid trying to buy a drink on the side of the bar where the Wheel is if you don't plan to spin it since it is generally harder to get the bartender's attention. There is also a credit card minimum that (some of the) bartenders enforce so keep some cash if you only plan to have one drink.", "author": "Tasmin S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-18", "description": "So my only real complaint with this bar is that they watered down their liquor. Specifically, they watered down their shots of Jameson. This was the first bar we went to for the night, so our palates were relatively clean, but after taking our first shot of Jameson, the three of us immediately noticed how \"smooth\" the shot was. It was way too smooth to be normal Jameson. I don't have real high standards for bars, I only ask that drinks be reasonably priced (which they were), and that they serve a good drink (which they didn't). \n\nTo be fair, I didn't try anything else, as we didn't want to stay after figuring this out, so maybe this was an isolated incident. However! If they employ this as a business practice, I'd recommend against going here. Sure they have an N64 which makes the place \"different\" and \"fun\", but when I go out, I do it to get my drink on, not play some stranger in mario kart. \n\nOther than that, the crowd is a mix of mid 20-30s, and the atmosphere seemed to be fun.

I looked up the rating of the in-hotel bar; one of the reviews expressed frustration that anyone would bother with it when there were dozens of better spots within waking distance.  \n\nMy following search led me here.   It's smallish (packed to capacity it might handle about 50) but has definitely opted for quality over quantity.  While the fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice for the greyhounds brought me in, I actually evaluated the drinks based on the house old fashioned, which was strong and traditional -- and then came garnished with a stick of rock candy to mellow the alcohol as you see fit.   Later, the salty dogs proved superior in a town where I drank many of them, and the 1-liter mule was darn fine.\n\nThe Soviet and Nintendo theme is directly aimed at those of a particular generation, but the appeal seems quite broad beyond that.  Even during midweek doldrums the crowd was enjoying the place as much as me; the Nintendo was consistently seeing action and the $10 cocktail wheel would get hit several times an hour and always by those willing to play by the rules.  Even when that meant a cement mixer.  \n\nIf I lived in the area, I'd be a regular.  \n\nIf you're staying at the Golden Gateway and looking for nearby fun, look no further.", "author": "Josh M."}

My favorite was the blackberry vodka cocktail, closely followed by the cucumber cooler. All of the ingredients are fresh, and the bartenders are really friendly and attentive. The Nintendo and decor are major highlights of this bar, and since it was fairly empty, we had the entire back area and Nintendo to ourselves. Oh, and two for one drinks during happy hour?

First of all, it is completely awesome and amazing that they let you fundraise by bartending, even if you have no previous bartending experience (like me). This bar is owned by the same people who own Tonic where they also allow guest bartending (they also own Bullitt and Dr. Teeth) and I am extremely grateful to the owners who allowed us to raise money this way - it is extremely generous.  It is much more fun to get all of your friends to come drink at a bar than ask them for donations outright! \n\nSecond, this bar is awesome.  They play great music, they have an old school nintendo set with a ton of games, there are multiple TVs, they have excellent drinks, and they have a wheel you can spin for some great (and some not so great) prizes. \n\nThird, they have the best bartender I have ever met whose name is Dan.  Dan works on Saturday early evenings. You should all go to the bar while Dan is there and tip him very well. Dan was the real bartender who was working that night and he was nice, patient and made the whole experience really really fun even though he was juggling a bar full of patrons and five newbie bartenders!

He said I had ordered all these other drinks before that one beer, through the night, and I replied that was not possible, because I had only been there for 5 minutes. He insisted, so I asked him to check if he had in fact registered my credit card earlier that night. He \"checked\" and said YES, so he just LIED about it. At that point, I told him I believed he was making an honest mistake, but that I would appreciate it if he could check again, because that was REALLY not possible.

There is a definite Bullitt vibe to the place (same owners), and you can expect a similar crowd and atmosphere. There is slightly more space to maneuver here, however. The back wall has a large TV screen playing classic Nintendo games controlled by the patrons, which may not sound like a draw until you are actually there and you find yourself glued to the screen cringing every time Mario shrinks from inadvertent contact with a cannon shot... The other awesome part of this bar is the drink wheel. You can pay ten dollars to spin the wheel and you are awarded with whatever drink you land on. Sometimes you end up with a measly can of beer, other times you might get the coveted (depending on who you are) Mule Kick... which brings me to the Mule Kick. Don't drink this by yourself. I'm not saying this to caution you from getting too drunk. It's certainly drinkable and won't cause you to fall asleep curled up on the floor. The true effects are felt the next morning. There are several Moscow Mules dumped into one large cup/bowl, and the pure amount of sugar was not properly accounted for until I felt like there was a small alien trying to through my stomach and head in the morning.

Its on a side street off of Polk, so its definitely a destination spot - you have to have this place in mind as you venture off Polk and down California.  We stopped by on a Saturday night, and it pleasantly was busy and bustling.  In the back there is a flat screen hooked up to a Nintendo.  For you youths out there, a Nintendo was an ancient predecessor to the XBOX - think of it like an ancient predecessor to the Wii.  After watching for a bit, it was easy to ascertain the Nintendo game of choice for this place is Punch Out.   I learned from another person there that the name of the bar itself, was in honor of one of the boxing characters in that game.   Learn something new every day.  But of course I had to go home and verify that on wikipedia: http://bit.ly/dLMShA   What an awesome angle to give people a venue to  a) drink  and  b) play Nintendo at the same time.  How many places can you do that?  We only stayed for one drink - but the bartender poured it strong.  Wish we had more places like this out in the East Bay.  Maybe I'll just have to move to SF :-)  5 stars.", "author": "Jaydee B."}

But I found that I lost my wallet a few hours later since I left the bar. I gave them a call, but no one answered. I lost my hope but still went back to bar to see if they found it. The bartender gave me back the wallet almost as soon as I told him I lost my wallet. I was so happy and thankful. ( this happened tonight. lol. Thank you so much...!)", "author": "Bonna C."}
