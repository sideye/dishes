I have been coming here to the Spanish restaurant Patio\" and the yearly events by the society for years. Being that I am of Spanish ancestry( my grandparents were from Spain) good Spanish food is always in my line of vision.\n\nTake in the Andalusian courtyard and the ambiance, the chitter chatter of Spanish in the air along with the familiar aromas..all leads to a great event. \n\nThe menu leads the foodie on a basic Spanish adventure. All their plates are great including the Paellas, the tapas( amongst them the patatas, olives, jamon serrano etc) all are wonderful. As I said, I am pretty picky when it comes to my roots( food not hair) and this place is the bomb. Can I say Spanish bomb?

We had a few hours to kill on a layover and we decided to have dinner here on a Thursday night. To my surprise it was not crowded at all at 630p, and I'm told reservations are best to have on the weekends, as I'm aware of anywhere in the bay area. \n\nI came a little prepared as I viewed the menu online. It didn't have pricing or specifics, such as if you order paella, it takes a little more time and 2 orders have to be placed. I found this out when viewing the restaurant menu. Therefore, we ordered the grilled salmon,  Bistec AL pastor and fried calamari with garlic and red peppers served with lemon aioli.\n\nThe waitress/ bartender was pleasant enough, albeit a little slow on her timing. Which my daughter had mentioned that service could be slow. She took our orders and I told her my younger daughter and I would share the steak. When she brought out the calamari, it was a meal in itself and I said to the waitress, \" Do you see why now we are sharing the steak?\" She agreed. Haha. My older daughter had the salmon which was a nice portion in itself. The entrees came with soup or salad and house bread as well.\n\nThat was a memorable meal and I cannot wait to go back and sit leisurely and enjoy without looking at the time. The calamari was light and crispy and fragrant with the garlic. Dipped into the aioli made my taste buds scream for joy! I ate about half the appetizer which was sufficient after eating bread, and which I know I should not do, but it was so soft and warm! The steak was tender and flavorful but we only ended up eating half, and the salmon was also cooked perfectly and moist. Also half eaten, not because it wasn't good, but it was a lot if food. Needless to say SIL had good leftovers for lunch since he was not able to join us. \n\nLooking forward to returning!", "author": "Joanne S."}

Your are free to decor a day before (if there is no other event planned on Friday) and come in early on the day of your event.

As I was brushing my finger on the Yelp app though, I got intrigued by this listing since there were lots of mentions about paella. Since we both loved Barcelona and the street fair paella we had there, I decided to make a reservation even though the hostess forewarned me there would be a wedding party taking up half the room that night. As it turned out, the place felt more like a moose lodge with a huge parking lot, a festive bar, and a cavernous dining room that wasn't too busy when we entered.\n\nWe even noticed how quietly behaved the wedding party was, and I was wondering if they were Amish or something. Anyhow, it turned out to be the kind of casual, family-style place we were looking for since there were no trendy hipsters for miles around. The menu reflected a pretty decent tapas list and a lot of main dishes, but we just had paella on the brain. OK, maybe not just paella since we took advantage of the $22 Carafe of Red Sangria, which yielded about five glasses worth (photo: http://bit.ly/2bObbGx). Nice fruity flavor, not too strong with a hint of cinnamon. As we imbibed that elixir, we went for a daily special appetizer, the $11 Pan-Fried Octopus with Potatoes (photo: http://bit.ly/2cjUlnh). It was pretty good with just the right chew on the 'pus.\n\nWe also got a rather dull bread basket and a fairly generic house salad (photo: http://bit.ly/2bIPABO) to tie us over until the main event, the $45 Paella Valenciana for two, a huge pan of rice, saffron, vegetables, prawns, clams, mussels, squid, chicken, and chorizo (photo: http://bit.ly/2bH4Oud). It was far from the best either of us had, but I was impressed there was some kind of seafood in every bite. We were fairly stuffed, although we were lured into dessert by the evil server came by with an armful of desserts. At least that's my version of the story as we shared a $5 Mocha Mousse, which was probably in the refrigerator too long (photo: http://bit.ly/2bXp3Bu). Uh-oh, here come the wedding toasts. Time to go before the father of the bride starts to play \"Malague\u00f1a\" on the ukelele.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...certainly lots of it, some of it pretty good, a lot of it just OK\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...just felt like a big lunch room done up for a Spanish festival\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty attentive at first though appearances dwindled toward the end\nTOTAL - 3 stars...bring your own castanets", "author": "Ed U."}

I've tried a couple of places in the city but they didn't suit me quite right.  Enter PER on Father's Day 2018.  Got at the place first thing at opening for their Sunday brunch.  We were greeted by a pleasant older gentleman and 2 young ladies.  After paying for admission, we were led to their elegantly apportioned grand ballroom with the spread of food arranged in a 'T' at the center.  I tried the soup, salad, cold cuts but made sure there was plenty of room for the much anticipated Paella A La Valenciana.  Boy, did I scratch that itch with 2 1/2 bowls of goodness!  It was not quite up to par with what I had in Madrid but by far the best value in this part of the world.  The lady servers are all exceptional and they all came to our table regardless of their designated table assignments and offered unlimited mimosas and whatever else drinks came to our fancy. !\"Diez estrallas\" para ustedes, senoras y senoritas (10 stars for them)!\n\nI skipped a star because I think the $35 price might be a bit steep for the offerings for those that may not be into gorging on Spanish buffet.  BTW, the price included tax but I'm not sure about the gratuity.  I left something extra to show our appreciation for the attentiveness and impeccable service of our lady servers.

They looked to be somewhere around in their late 80s! They looked so beautiful together.\n\nI couldn't help myself but feel overwhelmed with joy. It truly is possible to be with someone you truly love, and continue to be \"in-love\" with that same person for years and years. This couple who stole my heart, they've probably been married for many years, and continues to look at each other, as it was their first meeting. I can still see in my mind how beautiful the way they locked into each others eyes!!\n\nPatio Espanol gets a 5 STARZZZZZZ from me. They're service was on point, staff were quick and efficient, and the banquet manager made sure the guests were happy. Even my main course came out piping hot and so did everyone else. Best of all, I love their stage and their  live band. The center floor was already spaced out just for that... dancing!! No tables to be moved, no one had to regroup, all they had to do, was just get their boogie shoes on and have a lot of fun!! \n\nThe icing on the cake is that Patio Espanol has plenty of private and street parking which is unheard of in the city.  \n\nWhen you are looking to celebrate your love, or other occasions, and you are looking for a venue that can host a large group and still be in the heart of the city, try checking Patio Espanol.\n\nI came to Patio Espanol for a 50th Wedding Anniversary Celebration, and came out feeling inspired.\n\nUntil then...Cheers ~ :p", "author": "Edwin R."}

Your in for the treat of their traditional Spanish menu items.  You can start of with soup, salads (green, pasta, seafood, fruit), and appetizers (spanish olives, marinated peppers, smoked salmon or spanish ham on their pan a la catalana, and assortment of spanish cheeses.) As you move on to the main course you may choose from pasta, chicken bread in a crab sauce (delicious and moist), salmon, and of course the star: the Paella.\nYou can finish off with dessert and choose from an assortment of cakes and pair it with a warm cup of coffee.   \n\nThe food was always being refilled as more was served so no ones ever left with out any.\n\nSERVICE: You pay before you enter the dining hall, which was very organized.  If you make a reservation in advance (which I recommend to assure no wait and a table) they seat you promptly.  The hostess and cashiers were very friendly.  The employees who worked the dining hall were very attentive, and offered mimosas, water, coffee and offered us frequent refills.  Also cleared places promptly --not letting them pile up on the table.  Everyone was very friendly.  \n\nAMBIANCE:  The brunch was held in the Salon Picasso which is their largest banquet hall.  Very clean and bright atmosphere.  Table setting was very fun with pink, purple, and yellow napkins --very girly and cute for celebrating moms.  The music seemed traditional Spanish Music which was nice and not terrible loud to the point were you couldn't hold a conversation with the person sitting next to you.  \n\nMy Mother and I were so happy with the overall experience; my mom says she'd like to return next year.

The restaurant is located in the Spanish cultural center which is kind of unique. There is a restaurant sign on the building so it isn't completely hidden inside. There is ample parking and if the lot is full, I think you can slide by parking in the automotive repair shop lot next door when it's closed. \n\nThe place was surprisingly empty on a Saturday night but the patrons that were there looked like they were regulars. The place gave a very rustic feel and somewhat romantic vibe as well. I do believe our table was a bit cluttered with sugar boxes and too  many wine placards. The place also needs to update its music because we were seriously listening to the same song for a good 15 minutes. Luckily, a party was occurring in the banquet room so we could overhear their music instead.\n\nWe had ordered the paella Valencia which required a 2 order minimum which means 2 servings and it required a 25-30 minute wait. Instead of chowing on bread for 30 minutes, we decided to get calamari with aioli sauce. The calamari was delicious, it was thinly breaded but still crisp. It was not overly oily and was very well done. We did not know that the paella came with a side of soup or salad. We both chose soup, my boyfriend with the white bean soup and myself with the onion soup. The soup came in these rustic mini bowls and was okay.\n\nBy the time the paella came out, we were stuffed. The server divided the portions out of the paella pan for us and it had large portions of meat and seafood. It was very flavorful but we ended taking most of it home.\n\nI would return like to return to try their other items and the staff is wonderful! We had 3 people at our table filling our waters up, taking our dishes away, serving food at the same time. They are very attentive and friendly.

However, parking was easy.\n\nThe food and service was extremely good.  I came in for a Saturday dinner, and was greeted with warm bread. I shared the following:\n\nChorizo Manchego - huge portion, and very tasty.  Their chorizo was very good.\n\nScallops with a creamy wine sauce (it was the special/ I forgot the full name) - Good hearty portion.\n\nPaella Marinera - Mouth watering.  They were very generous with the seafood.  Lots of prawns, mussels, squid, clams, scallops, and saffron (and I've had Paella at fancier places).\n\nCreme brulee and white chocolate - pretty good but not wow. \n\nSangria - good value (5 dollars a glass or 20 dollars for a huge pitcher).\n\nThe waiter was extremely attentive.  Portions were HUGE!!  I think I could have eaten just a tapa if I wanted a light dinner.  We couldn't finish all the food and took a bunch home.

We had the seafood paella which has clams, mussels, scallops, prawns and fish. Allow 25 minutes for it to be made but it's so worth it. It requires a two person minimum but that wasn't a problem as there were twelve of us all together and four of us ordered the paella. It was perfectly seasoned and there was a lot of seafood. We could not finish all our food so most of us took leftovers home. For a larger groups the restaurant gives complimentary salad, which surprisingly had some asparagus in the romaine greens and cherry tomatoes. We shared appetizers of the calamari, chorizo sausage and mushrooms which were all very good.  The sausage was saut\u00e9ed with red and green peppers and onions. The appetizers are all tapas (small plates). The mushrooms were cooked in a garlic sauce.  The restaurant interior looks like a Spanish/European courtyard. The music is not too loud and we can hear each their talk.  They play Spanish music and mostly classical guitar songs which goes very well with the place. Service was good and efficient. Polite servers. They have a parking lot which is a huge plus! They also have a large hall in the building that they rent out for events.

My friends and I weren't hungry enough to order paella (you have to order a minimum of 2 orders...wth) so we decided to order a bunch of tapas. Here's the score:\n\n1. Queso Manchego con Fruta Fresca - You pay like $9 for six thin slices of manchego, three pieces of pineapple and a strawberry. Delicious, but not worth it. (C)\n\n2. Setas Silvestres al Ajillo (mushroom in garlic sauce) - This was delicious! It comes in a very rich garlic and white wine sauce that you can soak your bread in. If it was hotter (temperature wise) when it came out, then it would have been excellent. (A-)\n\n3. Gambas al Ajillo (prawns in garlic sauce) - Yeah, another garlicky dish, but oh so good. Like the mushrooms above, this was in a garlic based sauce laced with sherry. Slight temperature issue again, but overall, very nice. (A-)\n\n4. Torta de Cangrejo (crab cakes) - HOLY SALT! I don't know if it was the coating or the crab meat, but this thing was salty as heck. You get two super crispy and nice sized cakes with a refreshingly acidic side salad to cut the richness. If it wasn't so salty, I would have really loved this dish. (B-)\n\n5. Albondigas a la Castellana (meatballs) - Meh kind of meatballs in a sauce that tasted like it had pureed celery in it. I didn't mind, but one of us could not stand the taste. Forgettable. (C)\n\n6. Tortilla Espa\u00f1ola (omelette) - Saved the best for last. This dish came out later than the others (we almost forgot about it), but I'm so glad it did because this was the best dish of the night.

STAY AWAY!\n\nI usually don't write negative reviews because I know they really hurt small businesses but this was just so bad that I had to share. \n\nOur party got seated fairly quickly but this was the only thing that went right. The service was non-existent. I kept asking for a waitress because the menu stated that it takes 25 minutes for the paella. After asking servers multiple times it took us nearly ONE HOUR BEFORE WE COULD GET OUR ORDER IN. I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was because they had a full house. No, it was  the same non-sense even after most of the patrons left the restaurant. At this point the restaurant was only half filled and THE WAIT FOR THE PAELLA TOOK MORE THAN 45 MINUTES, which turned into a THREE HOUR LONG MEAL. And the food was not even good! What the hell are these people raving out. The paella was bland. There was a good amount of seafood but it wasn't good seafood. The seafood was NOT FRESH. The scallop was tasteless and rubbery. Actually everything was TASTELESS!!!\n\nBut that was not even the worst part! We asked about the two order minimum that was stated on the menu and the waitress confirmed that we had to order two orders of the paella. So we asked to get the Paella Valenciana and the Paella Marinera (two different kind of seafood paellas). You would think that this would be two orders or if it's not, the waitress would have the courtesy to point out something. It was only when we got the bill that we learned that each order inherently comes with two orders so we actually ordered four orders of the paella. WHAT KIND OF BULLSHIT IS THIS?They should state the actual cost or at least do a better job of explaining this. I'm fine with playing 40 dollars for a large serving of paella IF I knew this ahead of time but THIS WAS A SCAM.", "author": "Donna W."}

Before I go on to tell you my nightmare experience at this restaurant, you should know that I've been to Spain and had plenty of amazing tapas. \n\nOn a quest to search for a backup venue for an event in 2013 as the Basque Cultural Center in SSF wasn't available, a friend told us about the banquet space at El Patio Espanor. So tonight my family and I went there to check out the space and also taste some food. Little did we know, it was the worst meal we've ever eaten. \n\nWe wanted to taste several tapas so we ordered 4 standard tapas dishes that we had both in Spain and also in other tapas restaurants in town so we can have a benchmark to go with:  \n\nTapas Del Dia - Scallop cooked in garlic, white wine sauce and Serrano jam. Mediocre dish. \n\nGambas Al Ajillo - Shrimps cooked in garlic and tomato sauce. This was ok, the shrimps were good size, but nothing exciting to write home about. \n\nWild Mushrooms with Garlic and wine sauce - this was by far the WORST dish we had. First, the mushroom was wrong. The cook used fresh shitake mushrooms that they probably bought from the Chinese grocery store Pacific Super right next door. It wasn't porcini or even regular boring white button mushroom would have been better. All the mushrooms were drenched in the same garlic white wine sauce, same taste as the scallops and shrimp dishes. Completely weird tasting as shitake mushrooms have a more woody flavor and the texture when cooked in the white, gummy, starchy sauce just gave it a terrible texture. It was disgusting. \n\nTortilla Espanola - when this dish arrived, the server told us is American omelet. Um...hello, was the name this dish Tortilla Espanola? Shouldn't he say is Spanish Omelet instead? Or was he just being snooty and trying to insult our intelligent by telling us is American? \n\nAn entree - Ribeye Steak. This was the only decent dish we had and we had. \n\nNow on to the service - where do I begin? There are no praises for the server. I would have tolerated the bad food in exchanged for superb, friendly service. But in this case, our server was an old, snobbish, unfriendly man whom we caught him on a night when he didn't feel like working so he decided to ruin our evening by giving us lip and attitude. I was the last to arrive to join my dining party. I was never offer water and even after I've placed the food order, he didn't bother to ask me if I would like a glass of wine or something to drink. Obviously he didn't want to do extra work. He didn't bother asking how my dining companion like his steak either. He never once come back to check on us during the meal nor did he offered coffee and desserts. \n\nThe place was dead on a Wednesday night. Only our table of 3 and another table of 2. I should not have ignore my instinct of never eating at a place where food comes to die! I have a strong suspicion that the cook must be Chinese as all the dishes are all covered in starchy sauce just like bad Chinese food in lousy Chinese restaurant. Plus he used shitake mushrooms in a Spanish dish. What do you think? \n\nTo have eaten here was a total waste of my time and money, the food left a bad taste in my mouth and insulted my intelligence and appreciation for gourmet food. I was actually skeptical to write this review for fear of tarnishing my Gourmet Princessa reputation of eating a terrible meal.", "author": "Gourmet Princessa L."}

Every single one was a hit - the light and airy cheesecake, the subtly sweet chocolate cake and the creamy flan.\n\n\nFor dinner, the flavors are bolder and much more.  The appetizers are saltier and sweeter, brinier and vinegary-er.  And the paella (again)!

It seemed like me and my friend continuously went back for more scoopfuls of paella, without being able to make a dent into that delicious mound of rice and seafood.

I love Peruvian food especially since there's an abundance of good ones here but just thought we wanted to try a Spanish restaurant this time. Patio Espanola popped up on my Yelp list at the first search for \"paella\".  Minimum paella order is 2 but because we wanted to explore the tapas menu and didn't want to wind up with leftovers we paid an extra $6 charge to order 1. Not a problem because the paella valenciana was so worth it. It was flavorful and packed with seafood and chicken. Cooked perfectly. We devoured it and actually found the 1 order to be just enough. The order came with a bowl of sopa de ajo (garlic soup) that was delicious as well with it's rustic flavor and perfect temperature. We had 3 tapas. Our fave was the chorizo manchego so flavorful we started to clean up the bottom of the serving dish with bread so as not to waste the flavors of the chorizo oil and onions/peppers combined. Also had the variety of olives and the pan de Jamon Serrano. Sounds like a lot of food but I thought the tapas servings were perfectly sized for 2 (maybe even 3 but we are big eaters) and we had just enough room to squeeze in a tangy, tasty passionfruit mousse cake.

You would never notice it unless you knew it was there. The restaurant is actually part of the Spanish Cultural center and it is often used as an event space to cater large events including weddings. Apparently the King of Spain was in attendance at the center's inauguration. The architecture and ambience is geared toward creating a antique Spanish feel. Theres red roof tiles and stucco walls. Not too sure if they were authentic, but it gets the job done in creating the atmosphere. \n\nTheres a full bar there and plenty of seating. Its never really busy because I don't think too many people know about this place. I think it makes most if its money from larger banquets and events through the cultural center. When I came, our party was seated immediately and we had a waitress that was working her first shift. The people working there did not seem to be fluent in English (not sure if that was just part of the motif). But they knew enough to get through the menu. Our waitress was very nice and spent most of her time with us because there was no one really else there. Our table ordered some tapas and I split the Paella with someone. The food is undeniably delicious. Everything came out fresh, flavorful, and distinct. I'm not sure how to cook paella properly, but I heard its quite a process. The paella valencia here was soooo good. \n\nIt's sort of a fancy dining experience so everything is a little expensive. But I'd say its one of the places that is worth it.\n\nIt'd be a great place to get some food and wine and catch up with old friends. The feel of the place makes you want to sit and eat and chat the night away.\n\n-pricey but worth it\n-always pretty empty\n-some of the waiters are from spain\n-great atmosphere \n-its literally right next to BART so its pretty loud when it goes by***\n\nTry the housemade sangria!!", "author": "Arthur C."}

Which is actually a really good deal. \nThe customer service was slow and not very attentive. You gotta tell them every single time you need some liquid on your glass because they barely keep an eye on your drinks. Besides that, nothing to complain. \nThe food was good. I definitively recommend the paella (delicious) and the salmon. However, I think they can do way better Spanish buffet. \nThe atmosphere is like old Spain. Mostly all the customers are old people. It seems to be created for them. I think that's why it is cheap and not very busy. \n\nFinally, the location is kinda far from everywhere.

We had their calamari appetizer which are good sized portions for $9.50 to feed all of us.  It was decent.  Their paella was average; but good sized as well.  We had to bring some back home.  As for the filet mignons, it was very strange.  The meat came in two pieces on our plates.  My guest thought that one piece was very tough and inedible.  One of my pieces was burnt and seemed like some end piece of some other cut of meat.  Similarly with my guest's piece.  The main piece of meat was delicious though but it seemed like the regular filet was cut in half.  The vegetable were fresh and expertly cooked and their potatoes were excellent.  However, I gave them two stars because of the filet mignon described.  Service was fine.  There are nice photographs of Spain on the wall.", "author": "J L."}

In my opinion, this was the lousiest Spanish food I have ever tasted - actually it was tasteless. My Dad (RIP) was a member of the Union Espanola de California since its inception on Alemany St. He would have complained about the service - which today was super slow - mind you, we were the second table to be served and we waited about 1 hour for our food.\n\nSpeaking of the food, I ordered Garlic Soup - which was watered down. This I returned and then I ordered the soup of the day Asparagus Soup which again was watered down - I returned this one too. This 2 soups should have been thicker.  My husband ordered a salad which off course you can't get it wrong.  My main entree was Bacalao a la Vizcaina - Basque style cod fish.  The cod should have been saltier then what it was.  I think the cook soaked it too long.  I actually had to add salt to a salty fish.  I could not eat this lousy meal and thankfully, the water did not charge us for this and the soda. My husband had a lamb and shrimp combo platter which was just OK.\n\nI expressed my opinion to the manager and I told him that the cook should be fired.  I told him the soups were too watered down.  He got a little defensive and said that his soup tasted very good.  I spoke to the other manager who understood the concept of having a saltier cod  fish.\n\nA Spanish restaurant should have Spanish staff.  The cook should be a chef from Spain and not Central America).  The waiters should also be from Spain and not people that do not understand what the real Spanish (from Spain) culture is.  The facility manager or Caterer should be a Spanish Lady not a caucasian woman that does not even speak any Spanish and has never been to Spain.

We celebrated my Dad's 80th birthday here last year so she wanted to return for the food. I like this place, and it's almost like a hidden treasure within the city. We came here because of their wonderful buffet.\n\nAs you walk in, you instantly get transformed into a patio somewhere in the Spanish countryside. This place is spacious as they also have a Banquet room. (My cousin also held her wedding reception here about 12 years ago.) They have pictures of Spanish towns, Bull Fighters and scenery all over the wall which adds to the nice ambiance. They have a full bar inside and the dining area has high ceilings with plenty of natural lights coming in, complete with tiled roof and wood beams similar to Spanish Colonial architecture. To put it bluntly: it's a beautiful room.\n\nThe Hostess is nice and they have friendly servers, although they lacked a bit of knowledge on some of the food and wine. But, they were attentive and filled up your empty glasses while doing it with a smile. The napkins were colored red and yellow, similar to the Spanish flag which I thought was a cute added touch.\n\nThe buffet spread was awesome. Although some where hit or miss, mostly where hits. They offered a soup, cold food, hot food and desserts. For the cold food section, they had all kinds of salads and they even have a seafood salad. It consisted of shrimps, diced octopus and veggies with some type of oil and vinegar dressing. Wow, this was amazing and they ingredients were fresh. They also had Jamon Serrano cut thinly and I gobbled them up. Smoked Salmon, topped with capers on top of sourdough bread was tasty. Dried Spanish Chorizo made into an Empanada surely was delicious. But I kept going back for the Jamon Serrano.\n\nFor the hot food section, I started with Spanish Omelet with chopped sausages, bell peppers, onions and other good stuff and it was fluffy, soft and sublime. Penne Pasta with Pesto sauce (or Triple P) was also good. They had Lamb Stew which I found it to be tough and breaded fish were the only two dishes I didn't enjoy. Then their version of Paella, complete with chorizo, clams, shrimps, shellfish and a hint of saffron was superb. Although I prefer mine to be spicier, this one was a pure hit for me.\n\nFor dessert, they offered flan, chocolate cake, carrot cake and rice porridge with a drizzle of cinnamon. The flan was excellent as it had just the right amount of sweetness to it. The rice porridge was also airy and surprisingly light. Usually, porridge is heavy and syrupy but not this one. The cinnamon gave it some nice additional flavor without overpowering the porridge. We passed on the cakes since we were both stuffed.\n\nAfter finishing, I looked at my watch and it was half past one and saw the TV in the bar just in time to see J.T. O'sullivan getting sacked. But, we ended up winning the game in OT against Seattle. So, it made the trip to a quaint, countryside in Spain more enjoyable on a Football Sunday.", "author": "John G."}

The Filet was two overdone Hockey Pucks. Our table shared a bottle of wine, a reasonably priced Merlot, and user friendly enough to go with our variety of selections. We also ordered the Calamari appetizer, it was good, and a Garlic sauce Shrimp or Gambas Al Ajillo. The Gambas is the traditional Tapa' and was very tasty although it did not come out hot enough (temperature wise) \n\nThe Entree's came with a soup or salad choice, and the Zarzuela dish came with a side of veggies and saffron rice. I ordered the Potato Leek soup, it was not as thick in consistency as I would have expected, but flavorful with chunks of yukon gold potato.  We tried three deserts - A typical flan, which was not as sweet as I would have liked, a Pyramid shaped white chocoloate coated cheesecake, with some raspeberry jam in its core. This I enjoyed particularly and finally a Tiramisu. I didn't try it but it looked nice.\n\nAll in all a good experience, an enjoyable evening with decent to good food for the most part.. ( Barring the Overdone Filet and Prime Rib) Three out of the five dishes for our table were well executed.\n\n Despite being Mother's Day (The busiest day of the year for most restaurants) this place was not too full, we were seated immidiately despite being a few minutes late past our reservation time.", "author": "Gabriel B."}

The shrimps were already over cooked a bit.   Fair amount of mussels and clams.  I didn't see much sausage, and I'd avoid the fish.\n\nWhen we went their was a Mahi Mahi dish separate and I'd suggest putting that into the Paella (I'm pretty sure it was Mahi in the Paella, but it was way over done compared to the Mahi sitting by itself in the bin. )\n\nAll in all the freshness of the paella was about as you'd expect from a buffet ... oh and we thought it was a bit bland.  \n\nThe other main dishes were also just ok - there was a chicken breast in artichoke sauce, a roasted pork dish which was a bit dry, and a pesto ravioli.  Oh and the cold shrimp salad was probably the best dish - we tried everything. Deserts were good.\n\nOne thing I'd recommend is to dress up a bit - almost everyone in there looked like they just came from church - I felt like a dope in a t-shirt and shorts.   The place really filled up by 12:30, so I'd recommend getting there at 11:30.\n\nThe service was much better than expected and the wait staff filled us up non-stop on the mimosas, and they had no problem giving the wifey a glass of wine while she still had a mimosa. \n\nWe checked out the banquet rooms and I'd say this would be a great place to host a wedding - I wouldn't count on the food being spectacular, but it would be good place to have a non-Chinese food banquet, and they're close to the freeway which would be great for people coming in from all directions.

She offered her office for our purses and to rest while as we waited to be introduced.  She even took the effort to get us our drinks once we arrived at the place.  Now that was really sweet.  Thru out the night she was there serving hors d' oeuvre, getting wet floors cleaned up, giving instructions or just answering questions.  She really did a good job.  And she was all composed and smiles.  The bride and groom was indeed very happy with her.\n\nThe reception was at the Salon Picasso.  I just love what they did to the place.  It was early afternoon, but they made the place feel very intimate and romantic.  With low lighting and candles on the tables.  There was a big dance floor where we all danced the afternoon and evening away.  The salon had a full bar, a stage and accommodated set up for the DJ.

This year I took my aunts, siblings and my own mom. Last time we had the buffet in thier courtyard setting..very beautiful, this time it was full packed and we ended up in the  Sal\u00f3n Picasso banquet room (largest).. It seemed more like a family wedding reception hall type of setting than the enchanting Spanish style influenced surrounding. The food was just ok, a bit steep for the price you pay and I must say the buffet in Reno is comparable. I  still love the Paella Valenciana is superb here, it's the liveliest dish I last had and still is, the rest is just ok or mediocre.. I would say the bottomless mimosa is a plus to it's price.

The tapas are flavorless--tortilla was literally just egg scambled with potato in it--no spices, no onion, no garlic....terrible.  The patatas alioli had no spice, just mayo.  And don't even get me started on the gambas al ajillo--they were not al ajillo-they were in a broth and overcooked. The worst part of all is that they charge $10 per tapa, so you end up paying close to $100000 for crap.

I made a reservation and we got seated right away. I ordered an Estrella Galicia, almejas y mejillones and bacalao a la vizca\u00edna. The waiter was really nice. The atmosphere was nice, reminding me of the time I spent in Andaluc\u00eda a few years ago. I am not really sure this place cooks true Spanish or even Basque food. The almejas y mejillones were drowned in a red sauce with too much garlic. I doubt the food is like that in Spain or the Basque area (somebody correct me if I'm wrong). Also, the mussels were small and practically tasteless. The bacalao a la vizca\u00edna really let me down. The texture of the fish was not up to my standards of what I call good cooking. Also, the sauce that came with it was not amazing. I wonder if Bizcaia truly cooks the bacalao like that. At the end of the night I told the waiter that I didn't like the bacalao. She listened to me, took the plates away and didn't give me a hint she either understood, she cared or she was going to tell the manager that the food was mediocre. After this visit, I can only give two stars to Patio Espa\u00f1ol. The food is relatively expensive. I don't know how this place can have 4 stars.

It's got a good vibe to it - as it's the cultural center for San Francisco's more-substantial-than-you-think Spanish community, it's been decorated with care and attention to detail (and it's pretty cool that Juan Carlos inaugurated it). The dining room itself is rather breathtaking. Likewise because it's a meeting place for the Spanish community, it's affordable since they need to cater to people with diverse incomes. Also, because it's in an out of the way neighborhood (though not all that seedy - the area around has low crime) it's refreshingly free of any of the poisons that can annoy the average, cranky native San Franciscan - out-of-towners, yuppies, or hipsters. Simply, it's old school. \n\nThe bar is handsome and a wide array of wines are served, all of them good. The service has usually been pretty good. Now, to the most important part..\n\nThe food is not outstanding, but very good - a B/B+. What gets it a little extra are two things:\n\n1) They've usually got a regionally diverse group of tapas. I'd imagine this is because it's a cultural center - the Catalans, Galicians, Aragonese, Andalucians, etc all have a representative dish. \n\n2) They have several very good entrees (also regionally representative). Too many Spanish restaurants pretty much serve tapas (which are awesome, but are really just bar snacks in Spain) and paella. You'd think the Spanish just ate paella every day. Not this place! The medallions of lamb (cordero manchego) is particularly note worthy.\n\nIt's not the best Spanish food you'll ever eat, but it's probably got one of the best menus of any place in San Francisco in terms of representing the breathtaking diversity of Spanish food. That it does this while being affordable, and whole-heartedly embracing the culture of traditional Spain is pretty sweet.", "author": "Flynn H."}

As for the food...\n\nSopa de Ajo Aragonesa - Their very garlic-y soup really lived up to its namesake so don't expect to be making out with anyone afterwards, but YUM!\n\nSetas Silvestres al Ajillo - Mushrooms in some type of wine/garlic sauce. The sauce was out of this world. Try dipping your bread in it once you've cleaned the plate of mushrooms.\n\nCalamares Fritos - The calamari didn't really stand out, but it was good nontheless.\n\nDaily Special! Catfish croquettas - OMG soooo good. Orgasmically so quite frankly. The catfish was very fresh and the croquetta came out nice and light. Not overfried like other places tend to do.\n\nPaella Valenciana - The portions were huge so bring along an empty stomach; they also give you a LOT of seafood. [Note: You have to order at least 2 portions of the same paella so it comes to roughly 44USD minimum, but between 6 of us, there was just the right amount of food]\n\nSolomillo a la Andaluza - You can't really go wrong with Filet Mignon, but it was a tad more medium than rare for my personal taste.\n\nDaily Special! Leg of Lamb - They have specific family dinner options for every night of the week. We happened to drop by on a Thursday and got to try their lamb. Fabulous and tender.

After reading a few Yelp! reviews, I felt it was worth the effort.\n\nThe price point is high for the quality of food, but I suppose they make up for lack of quality in quantity.  \n\nWe ordered the following items:\n\nSpanish Soup- The soup tasted diluted and the flavors weren't integrated.  I could taste two things-- water and probably paprika, because it was a little spicy.\n\nFried Calamari - The calamari was fresh, but it needed a little salt.  Your standard fried calamari. \n\nSauteed Murcilla - The sausage was sliced and served with vegetables and potatoes.  I don't eat blood sausage, so I can't comment.\n\nPan Tomate with Jamon - This bread dish is typically served with fresh tomato and garlic.  Often times, if not always, the bread is toasted.  The bread came fresh with some sort of tomato paste. \n\nThe service was slow and our server was a little cheesy.  He referred to water as H2O and checked in on us at odd moments, then completely disappeared when we really wanted to get the bill paid and just get the hell out of there.  He also couldn't recommend a wine to the table next to us, because he told them he \"didn't drink wine.\"  \n\nIf you're going to work a dinner service (when wine is usually involved) at least learn enough about wine to know what to recommend to pair with paella.  It's not like the restaurant has a large list...\n\nDespite the food and the service, people seemed to be coming in.  From where, I have no idea, and I couldn't tell you why either.  I suppose it's convenient for anyone that lives in the neighborhood and decent enough to eat.  \n\nI just won't be back myself.", "author": "Anna V."}

The brunches are typical spanish tapas, but the selection is overall good. The service is good and you can typically get a good seat if you go there as not too many people know about it. Overall a great place to bring someone who wants to taste a good paella!...and some jamon serrano!", "author": "Sebastian C."}

The restaurant looks nice enough from the outside.  Although, we didn't have reservations, we were seated right away.  As you enter, there is a bar area to the right.  Once inside in hall, you'll notice how airy and spacious this place is.  With the faux terra cotta tile roof and white walls, you'll feel as if you've been transported to another place.  This establishment serves dinners, buffets, and banquets have a separate room for hosting special events.\n\nWe hankered down with a bottle of red wine and starters; balsamic sauted portabellas and fried calamari with lemon and alioli.  The portabellas were absolutely flavorsome.  Given our two orders of paella were going to take 25 minutes to cook, we waited 15 minutes after our starters were finished and have not gotten our orders of soup and salads.  We inquired our waitress about it where she admits the items were forgotten.  Instead, she said our dinner was almost ready thus she'll comp. our desserts.  Since, one of the orders is for rare prime rib, she couldn't hold up the orders to bring us the soup and salads.  Well, we could have eaten the items on the side with dinner.  While we were chatting away and waiting for our dinner, I noticed the waiter at the next table being very attentive to a large party all the while wondering what happened to our waitress.  When the prime rib arrived, the meat recipient inquired where the bone was as he wanted it for his dog.  The waitress said she'll give it to us before we leave.  My paella was okay; a bit wet and mushy for me.  It was laden with shrimp, mussels, clams, chicken, and chorizo.  We were given a choice of desserts for which we chose flan, cheese cake, and chocolate cake.  Our leftover orders were wrapped to go and packed in one bag by the waitress.  We inquired for another bag since the leftovers were for two different households.  The waitress told us whose item was on top in the bag.  Well, she got that wrong after we took a peek at the boxes in the bag.  When we got home we realized that the waitress has forgotten to give us our prime rib bone.  I think we just got a bad waitress that evening.\n\nThere is plenty of enclosed parking at this restaurant's lot.", "author": "Nanette L."}

This is hands down the best paella in the bay area IMHO. This is not just my saying but you will see the awards that state this. The decor makes you feel like you are dinning in a Spanish villa back in the home country. The bar is great and i love the old school way of service. Their presentation is always on point.

An elegant, spacious interior completely at odds with the seediness of the neighborhood, with formally-dressed waiters - although it's casual dress for patrons. Although it's open to the public, it appears to function as sort of club for the City's Spanish community. We started  with a wonderful Spanish garlic soup seasoned with paprika and swimming with hunks of melting pork fat - heavenly. Then a selection of tapas including croquettes de bacalao and a fluffy tortilla, then paella valenciana with fresh shellfish and chorizo, finishing with beautifully-made and presented desserts incluing an excellent tiramisu - all washed down with fine Spanish wine. HIGHLY recommended - I'll be going back next time I'm in San Francisco.", "author": "Philip W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-10", "description": "Sangria red and white both good but in this case red is the way to go and quite refreshing and only $5. Calamari appetizer was quite good and a healthy portion and served with aioli and lemon. Cold potato appetizer was nothing special and would pass. Gambas al Ajillo (Garlic shrimp) plate was good and included nice saffron rice. Now the main \"objective\" of course  was the Paella Valencia. It was loaded with tender chunks of chicken and seafood along with chorisso. Most definitely tasty although not the best paella I have had, but great for USA standards!!!. The restaurant interior is almost like a Spanish courtyard and has a nice feel and experience. The restaurant customer service was excellent although we did have to ask for our water to be \"topped off\" and for the check at the end (both minor details.) Restaurant staff were very pleasant, attentive and friendly. Overall a fun and delish experience!!! Only negative factor is the Bart train that runs by shaking the building about every 20 minutes.", "author": "Trev D."}

We've never ordered take out from here but dining in sometimes isn't an option with a toddler to attend to.  Since we live only about 15 minutes away, the meal was just as good as if we had dined-in (saving us on tip). \n\nI haven't been here for a few years but  had a craving for their meatballs and paella.  I thought we'd also try something new and ordered the monkfish tapas as well.  Unfortunately, they forgot to include the order in my take out box and I didn't realize it until I got home.  I counted the number of boxes before I left the restaurant only to discover one of the boxes contained a bunch of individual servings of butter for the bread!  I called them and informed them.  The worker told me they still had my order there and tried to find me after I left.  They didn't offer to refund me but did say they would credit me the next time.  Since I wanted an excuse to go back, I agreed on it.\n\nThe paella was wonderful as expected (comes with soup or salad).  They usually require a minimum of 2 orders of paella but the lady who took my order today let me order just 1 order (approx $22 per order but can easily feed 2 people).  The meatballs appetizer was to die for!  They gave us a about a loaf and a half of sourdough bread with our order which was perfect for sopping up the meatball sauce.  We also ordered crabcakes which were good but definitely not the best I've had.\n\nI took off a star for the missing fish and for the slow service  (may have been due to the large event in their \"ballroom\" ).  Even though I called my order in advance, I still had to wait 30 minutes for my order.  \n\nPrices aren't cheap but not too bad for a special occasion.  Our bill came to $54 after tax (includes the charge for the missing fish).", "author": "Mary T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-14", "description": "My roommates and I had dinner here last night. They had both eaten here before and had raved about the paella. We ordered the paella marinera for two and it was plenty for all three of us. The salad that comes with it (or soup) was very fresh and had a tasty dressing.  Our waiter brought us some warm crusty bread which we dipped into the delicious garlic-infused olive oil which is on all the tables. We had a bottle of  Salmon Creek Chardonnay and, for $18, it was well worth it. When the waiter brought our paella to the table he professionally served it up onto three large plates. It was full of shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, white fish, and scallops served on a bed of beautiful saffon rice. This was the best paella I have had in SF since La Roca closed. We each ordered a different dessert and each was very good. My choice was a white chocolate pyramid with cheesecake and fresh blackberry inside. The plate and presentation of all the desserts was beautiful. Each of our desserts had a large strawberry on the side that had been cut to look like a flower. The service was as good as it gets and our waiter couldn't have been more professional and efficient. He shook each of our hands before we left and extended his hope that we would come again. Great food and not a big price!", "author": "Charles A."}

We ordered their Garlic Soup, the recommended Spanish wine and tapas all around.  Everything was exceptional - the soup was first rate, the wine pleasant and interesting and the various tapas were each a masterpiece.  We couldn't resist dessert, which lived up to expectations.
