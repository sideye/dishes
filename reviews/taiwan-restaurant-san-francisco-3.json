The chicken is good when you're hungry because they give you a lot for cheap.", "author": "Natascha E."}

We were immediately handed menus and tea was given to us. The service was alright, the man was more accommodating and attentive compared to the woman, but it wasn't that huge of a concern for us, considering that more customers came and the restaurant was filling up. \n\nFood:\n\n- Potstickers: These are one of the biggest potstickers I've ever seen, and they were packed with meat. The potstickers were freshly made to order and overall, super good.\n\n- Green beans: I love green beans (the dish comes with pork) and this dish had good flavor, though the beans were not as crunchy as I would've liked. You could definitely taste the char from their frying.\n\n- Xiao long bao: Again, similar to the potstickers, these are one of the biggest xiao long baos I've ever seen. They were also packed with meat and just oh so delicious.\n\n- Shanghai Noodles: The noodles were thick and starchy and I would definitely recommend this dish since its got noodles, meat, and veggies. This dish is one of our go-to dishes.\n\n- Fried Doughnut: This is usually ordered with some sweet soy milk since it is a savory doughnut, but we decided not to get the soy milk and just the doughnut. It was freshly made and crunchy, but maybe just a little too oily for me. This satisfies any of those savory doughnut cravings. \n\n- Rice cakes: The rice cakes were very chewy and the dish didn't have much flavor, but it was a nice reprieve from other saltier dishes so it was a good balance. \n\nOverall, the dishes were good for the price you pay, and I would definitely come back if I'm in the area!", "author": "Lisa C."}

On the way in, you can observe the chefs make all the potstickers and donuts fresh from the fryer. What's great about this place is that my family is one of their usual customers, so my parents have become friends with the waitress so the atmosphere is always inviting. Although this place isn't the best looking restaurant, the food makes up for it.\n\nI got my personal favorite the Mustard Green with Shredded Pork Noodle Soup, and my Dad got the Braised Beef Ligament Noodle Soup. \n\nLet me just say that the noodle soup portions are huge. If you're not a big eater and you order one of their noodle soups, I would suggest you split the bowl with someone. The mustard greens and pork are cooked in a sauce that adds a lot of flavor to the soup. Both bowls really hit the spot, but this time around the proportion of noodles to everything else was slightly higher than normal. Other tasty options are their potstickers, fried doughuts and unsweetened soymilk. The potstickers are so crisp and juicy, and the fried doughnuts go well while drinking the soymilk (there's sugar at the table for you to add yourself). The rice plates also come in huge portions as well incase you're not a noodle person.\n\nPrices are decent, cleanliness is alright, and decor is bare minimum, BUT the food is what makes this place amazing.", "author": "Kevin S."}

My friend chose it for her birthday lunch on a recent Saturday.  While ordering post meal takeout, I recognized a waiter from that Chinatown location, leading me to believe ownership is likely the same.  Here's what we shared, all family style:\n\nAppetizers\n1.  Kuo Teh (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=GERaTy5i44rasD7Ug_8WTA) - Also known as pot stickers, these were nicely browned though skins are on the doughy side.\n\n2.  Green onion pancake (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=oJk7G8GtWxavVDwXRmJTXA) - Crisp and served hot, these disappeared from the plate quickly.\n\n3.  Steamed dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=bVTHJlHoJ4YQiirRjgLw9w) - Better known as Xiao Lung Baos, they are larger than most and like 1., skin on thick side.\n\n4.  Taiwan special deep fried tofu (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=X-L5Bh-SdVNUHMCt3j3tcA) - Seeing a neighboring table's order, we added this.  Fried well but no distinct flavor.\n\n5.  Fried squid (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=2KeA1m_3rWgKrf9FNTJKdA) - Probably my least favorite as they could pass for pork rinds.\n\n6.  Wok-fried Shanghai thick noodles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=h9FnAuBagMh80C4CBXQsGw) - The noodles were extraordinarily thick almost udon like.  Flavors were very distinct as chef had a light hand on the soy sauce while stir frying.\n\n7.  Bean and meat sauce noodles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=agbAC1NtfEOYP3SPCl4Izw) - Probably my favorite as seasonings were spot in.  A little more veggies might make this a must-order.\n\n8.  Dry braised green beans (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Hard to do this wrong, they did a decent job in savoriness and not overcooking them.\n\n9.  Smoked tofu, celery, and pork stir fry (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=s2EjsJtnF1mlqI2lsvCMCQ) - My second favorite of the meal, all ingredients shined.  Tofu size made smaller would make this perfect.\n\nAs many comment especially Ken K. (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DS0Idr2XDhz5e7ZfSy0dYA), this is a pretty far cry from authentic Taiwan food as far as flavors go.  The bar is set high in Southern California with the predominance of locals there.  Here, Cantonese palates reign and welcome any variation of Chinese cuisine available.  Portions are generous and prices are certainly reasonable here.  \nJust don't expect to enjoy the true flavors that you'd enjoy in or around Taipei's night market.", "author": "Mike C."}

It has been here since I was a kid.  LOL :p  I have always enjoyed Taiwanese breakfast.  It is so different from Chinese.  The Taiwanese pays close  attention to sauces and they like to eat \"Tapas style.\"  It's just a whole different culture put together.  With that said, I'll keep this review short and \"sassy!\" I only come here for their Taiwanese breakfast, and I usually order their hot soy sweet milk, and their super fresh sweet deep fried Taiwanese donut.  They go hand in hand and a must while you are here.  You can even watch the chefs at front kneading the dough from start to finish.  It's an amazing feat! \n\nCheers! ~ :p", "author": "Edwin R."}

As a Hong Kong transplant, he searched high and low for semi authentic places. This was one of them. \n\nMostly Chinese people were at the restaurant, which usually points to some authenticity. Ambiance isn't the best, but we didn't expect much. Old restaurant, but everything seemed decently clean. \n\nWe ordered WAY too much food, as usual. Xiao Long Bao, potstickers, sesame noodles, and Sichuan beef. \n\nXiao Long Bao were big, hand made, and hot. I really enjoyed them. The potstickers were crispy and juicy. They were also pretty big. \n\nI was so focused on the dumplings, I didn't even bother to try the beef. It seemed overloaded with bell peppers though. When \u00be is bell peppers and the rest is meat, I feel a little cheated. \n\nThe sesame noodles were great! Very rich and filling, but the sauce was killer. We got meat on the noodles which really helped cut through the think sesame sauce. \n\nThe service was really good. Everyone seemed kind. Dumplings took longer than usual since they were super fresh. Our waitress was nice, and she even talked to me in Chinese. I kept up... Sort of.

Same for their dumplings.\nI went here today with my mother and uncle. The restaurant feels like a hole in the wall, this place hasn't been updated in decades. flies were everywhere. it is a bit dumpy and dirty. That would be fine, as long as the food is good, that's the most important thing. We ordered 3 dishes, the fried pork rice plate, japanese seafood noodle and this beef noodle soup dish. Of the three, the rice plate was the best. it had a sweet and spicy sauce with a real kick to it, and a very large portion. I think the rice plates are the better items to get here. Those are the safe bet, and u'll get a very large portion. they didn't skimp.\n\nWhat was terrible were the noodle soups. Japanese seafood noodle was just flavorless, bland and average. For a pricey dish at $9, it should've been better. it was a risky choice picking this.  I thought it was a stir fry dish by the title, like a stir fried udon dish with seafood. so i was surprised it was noodle soup in a big bowl. it was a clear broth with udon noodles, shrimp, shellfish, green beans and carrots. it had absolutely no flavor to it. My uncle's beef noodle soup was just ok too. The noodles were oddly gummy textured.  Portion wise, both are good on that front. \n\nOverall, there are many other better choices on Clement and nearby here. If you do come here, order the safe items.", "author": "Jim D."}

The noodles are traditionally freshly pulled thick noodles made in house. The name of the noodles come from the \"dan\" merchants use to peddle the noodles in China. Also, \"dan\" means \"bouncy\" or \"springy\" in Chinese, which perfectly describes the process of how the dan dan mien is made, as well as the texture of the noodles when eaten. But, enough about the history of dan dan mien.\n\nOn my most recent visit, we ordered the Xiao Lin Dumplings and Hot and Sour Soup to start off. Xiao Lin Dumplings are fickle creatures. The chef made them amazingly juicy and tender with the right amount of broth in each morsel. Dipped in red vinegar, it makes you crave for another. The hot and sour soup was standard, nothing special about it. I will give credit because it's not overly sour, which is always a good thing.\n\nOur main course is the dan dan mien. I ordered a garlic peanut sauce one because the classic has always been my favorite since I was a child. My friends ordered the spicy flavored one. We ended up eating the noodles family style, split into smaller bowls. Why? Because the portions of these dan dan mien are HUGE. One bowl can serve 2-3 people. But it's not just quantity, it's also quality also.\n\nThe garlic peanut version had a milder taste, the tones of peanut and garlic meld together with the creamy noodles, it's very rich and filling. The spicy variety is also very buttery, but has a spicy kick to it. It's not Sirarcha-worshiper spicy, just enough to go with the rich creamy texture of dan dan mien.\n\nService here is slow because there's only two waiters, the owner and a hired employee. Atmosphere is very casual and the decor is drab, but that's because they spend their resources on making good food. They tend to the taste buds, not the eyes.\n\nBottom line: Delicious dan dan mien.

The xiao long bao was not all that great and had no soup in it but I can't complain cause the price was so cheap. \n\nI did see another table eating different types of dumplings and pot stickers that looked quite appealing and delicious so I think go for that over the xiao long baos.

Do NOT order the taiwan special chicken. We thought they would be like the spareribs... soooo NOT the same. Totally different preparation.

I should have been wary and walked out when the servers started using Cantonese.\n\nThe pork chop rice here at Taiwan Restaurant falls flat. The pork is overly seasoned and too sugary.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-23", "description": "I'm going to be completely honest here. Nothing about the dumplings or the niou ro mien (beef noodle soup) is authentic. The dumplings are just steamed or boiled pot stickers. And the beef noodle soup is simply what the description is; a soup with noodles with beef in it. Although they were tasty, neither dish(es) are authentically Taiwanese, as the restaurant suggests it is. \n\nThey used lo-mein noodles for the soup, which are not as bouncy and get soggy too fast, and they do not include the pickled mustard greens and use spinach instead. I also sensed there are some spices missing, such as star anise. And the dumplings' filling seemed wrong, as if it was just the same salty pot sticker filling. It should have been made with a consomme that liquifies during cooking which makes them juicier.\n\nSo, basically, if you were to go to Taiwan, you would never, ever, in a million years, find these dishes served this way, period. These are pretty much Americanized versions which had to be adjusted due to inexperienced American palates. And unfortunately, if you do not have the opportunity to travel to the real Taiwan, then the only authentic way to get the real deal (in San Francisco) is to find a Taiwanese person to make a home cooked meal for you.\n\nI believe the owner of the restaurant is truly Taiwanese, so I hope one day the public will be ready for the real deal. When and if this ever happens, I will be there every single day at least for breakfast!\n\nAnyway, I will say that the service is very good here. They speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. I have yet to hear Taiwanese, but I would not doubt that they probably speak it too. The menu is also quite extensive, and there is a good variety of Americanized \"Chinese\" food, mixed in with some \"authentic\" favorites. It is a rarity to find Taiwanese food in San Francisco, so I will give them a lot of credit for even having the option. Also, the dining area, china and flatware are clean. So, I will be going back, and I will recommend coming here, mainly due to the lack of alternatives for Taiwanese food.\n\nOh, and one thing I found authentic about this establishment was the restroom, which was authentically dirty, just like in Taiwan!", "author": "Lizzie L."}

The skin was too thick and there was no soup.  Probably the worst dumplings I've ever had.  \n\n-Sizzling Rice Soup - This I loved!  Its a bit on the salty side but I like it that way. Its a clear broth with veggies and chicken and shrimp.  They top the soup with crispy fried rice.  It gave the soup more texture.  Really enjoyed the part crunchy and part soggy texture of the rice.\n\n-Onion Pancake - You can't go wrong with this pancake.  I think it was ok.  I prefer the pancake to be flat and not too many air bubbles in the dough.  But still the taste was very close to the real deal.

If I knew about this place in college, I'd probably come here a lot.  \n\nThis place is ideal for the college student or anyone eating on a budget.  The portions are huge and the menus haven't changed since I don't know when.  Recollections of this place in my memory pop up when I was small, so this place has got to be at least fifteen years old.  Not only are the menus and price the same, the recipe, and the taste is the same. \n\nDo not get what they have labeled \"beef crepe\", if you're assuming it is their beef pancake.  Apparently, what they mean by \"beef crepe\" is a quesadilla looking thing with beef and hoisin sauce.  Their potstickers and xiao long bao (or XBL as used in many fellow Yelpers reviews) are huge here.  They're not the highest quality, but they're great for the budget diner wherever you are.\n\nThe noodle dishes and noodle soups are one of their fortes.  Personal favorite, the dom dom mein, which has a peanut like topping in their meat sauce.  The sauce also is a little spicy that mixes into the flavor of the dish.  The best asset that Taiwan Restaurant has is its Chinese donut.  There's something about the dough they use or something.  They have some awesome Chinese donuts.\n\nHaven't eaten in a few days?  Need to feed a hungry college student or maybe you want to be a good samaritan and feed a couple homeless folk?  Taiwan Restaurant could be an alternative.  Healthy portions at a good price are what they're about.  I'll come here for their Chinese donuts to go.  Maybe stop by if I have a few bucks in my pocket.

They now have pork blood casserole - yum.  \n\nTheir menu claims that they were the first restaurant in the US to serve Taiwanese food.  I don't know if that's true but they have been around for decades.  I do like walking by and watching them make fried Chinese donuts in the window.  There aren't many places where you can see that and their donuts are always fresh.  \n\nFor brunch we usually get soy milk (salted or sweet, $1.25).  It's served hot in a bowl.  Delicious.  My father says their donuts aren't as airy and light inside as they should be but I think he's comparing it to what he had in Taiwan.  \n\nTheir shredded white turnip cakes (4 per order) were huge, the size of a red bean bun and stuffed with turnip, ground pork and mushrooms.  The shell was thin and flaky on top and thicker on the bottom.  These were really good.  \n\nThe hot boiled dumplings had a tasty pork filling but there wasn't enough filling and there was too much dough.  Also the soy sauce it was tossed in made the dumplings too salty.  I noticed you can ask for low salt - we should remember to do that though I'd rather get other dumplings (these were like won tons) with less skin.  The Shanghai thick noodle was disappointing - oily and bland.  \n\nThey are trying - they will make dishes w/o msg, with less salt or hot & spicy upon request and they even have brown rice now.

We weren't very hungry, but the dumplings were calling our names so we ordered 1 basket of chicken and 1 basket of pork dumplings along with 1 of those long Chinese donuts with warm soy milk.\n\nWe were so excited when the two baskets of steaming dumplings arrived at our table, but after the first bite we found out that they were lacking in flavor. The donut and soy milk were ok, but we were really disappointed by the dumplings.\n\nI have to admit that I don't know much about Taiwanese cuisine, so I am looking forward to going back and trying more items on the menu.", "author": "Keau K."}

A quick search on Yelp and I found Taiwan Restaurant with stellar reviews. Hey at least they got the name right, right?\n\nWell that's about the only thing they got right.  I ordered the \"fried yam cake with meat and mushroom\" and Taiwanese oyster pancake. Both are very traditional Taiwanese dishes that every Taiwanese restaurant should do well or go home. \n\nI had a bad feeling when I walked in and heard the owner speak Cantonese. Nonetheless, I sat down and gave it a try; 200+ yelp reviews can't be that off, right?\n\nYam cake: the dough layer was way too thick thus undercooked. The stuffing was big chunks of pork that had no flavors. I think they microwaved it because the parts of it was cold.\n\nOyster pancake: what oyster? I found a total of one oyster inside. The dough/pancake part of the dish was too dry, the consistency was all wrong. They did not top it with the red sweet chili sauce per tradition either.\n\nReading other reviews, most people compliment their dumplings, juicy pork bun (xiaolong bao), green onion pancake, etc. NONE OF THEM ARE TAIWANESE FOOD. I believe Taiwan Restaurant does these dishes well but they can't do any Taiwanese food.\n\nSo the lesson is, Taiwan Restaurant may be a decent eatery but don't come here and order Taiwanese food...hmm...how ironic.

They even have an impressive selection of fried breads which are probably made with lard, but who's counting calories, right?\n\nThe food:\n\nFor 2 people, we ordered the sweet fresh soymilk, a Chinese doughnut for dipping, spicy wontons and Szechuan Hot Sauce Noodles. All came out to about $20.\n\nSoymilk and Chinese doughnut- Disappointingly, the soymilk was lukewarm. One of my pet peeves at a restaurant is lukewarm dishes. However, the doughnuts were fresh. We only ate half of it since it was so big.\n\nSpicy Wontons - The wontons themselves were really good, but it wasn't spicy at all. The skins were thicker than I'm used to, but it was al dente - the way I like it. The meat was super juicy too. The sauce was basically just soy sauce. I didn't see any chili flakes or chili oil in it.\n\nSzechuan Hot Sauce Noodles - These were sooo good! The noodles are the kind you usually see in northern Chinese noodle dishes. I don't think they were homemade, though. I really couldn't point out every ingredient in the sauce, but it was super tastey. Items I could point out were ground pork, peanut sauce, tons of hot sauce and and green onions. The dish was so big, we had to take it home some leftovers. The downside is this makes terrible leftovers. The noodles soaked up the sauce, making the noodles mushy. Dang!\n\nTaiwan Restaurant seems to be a popular restaurant in the Richmond.

I had it once in NY, and found it again in Venice, Italy - and recently discovered it in San Francisco.  Three times over a lifetime isn't much - so it's easier for me to say that I'm not big on pizza rather than explaining how good pizza has to be for me to like it.  \n \nWhile I enjoy a few things from Taco Bell - let's make clear that this is not Mexican food.  So then taking me to most taquerias results in a very mediocre meal for me.  But having had meals cooked for me by authentic Mexican families, and having had excellent dishes IN Mexico - - I love real Mexican food.  There's very little in life that beats a tamale that is too hot to touch, plump w/ fresh meat, etc.  There are some taco trucks in Oakland that the mere sight of requires a napkin to wipe the drool off my face.  But the majority of Mexican restaurants will result in an unsatisfying meal for me.\n \nThen there's Chinese food....\nBeef and Broccoli, shrimp w/ lobster sauce can only be so good and it's Americanized Chinese food.  It's just not my thing.  Dimsum, I love... but there, too, I am entirely too picky about what good dimsum should taste like.  I love porridge, but not when there's more water than substance.  Throw me in Shanghai, and I think you'd probably have a hard time stopping me from eating everything - but when friends are gathered deciding where to go for dinner, if someone mentions Chinese, I will usually pipe up with other suggestions, hoping to avoid more \"so-so\" meals.  But my search for excellence in Chinese food, though, has been kicked into gear lately, and there seems to be no end to how much Chinese food I can try.  Most, however, I will not like.\n \nEnter:  Taiwan Restaurant.\n \nLocated on Clement Street, I would probably walk right by without a second thought if not for the small area in the front window showcasing a man making dumplings.  It looks good, but I'd enter assuming it's just \"OK\".  But Rob went to this restaurant a week or so ago with his friend and never stopped talking about it, and every night's dinner suggestion resulted in, \"Chinese Food tonight?  Taiwan?\"\n \nFinally, we decided to go.\nPhotos uploaded.\n \nThe dumplings here are, in fact, extremely good.  If I had to ding them for something, it'd be that the wrappers are thicker than what I like in a dumpling.   I'd recommend the pork dumplings, and shrimp with chives dumplings.  The first is steamed, the latter boiled, but it gives you a good glimpse on what this place can create.  These are steroid-sized dumplings - REALLY BIG!  (We also ordered the beef, but there was no discernable difference between that and the pork - and if you had to pick one, I'd suggest the pork.)  We also ordered some entrees - - a scallop and snow peas dish, and Schezuan beef with an order of rice.  If I give their dumplings a 4.5 - I give their entrees a 3.5-4.  The ingredients are FRESH, and it's cooked well, but neither dish made the top 5 level that I expected after having the dumplings.  Chinese food at Yuet Lee is still the only one that I have found in the city to be top 5, no matter what I order - -- but they don't make dumplings - at least I don't think so.  I'm too busy eating porridge when there to notice much else.\n \nNotable was  that the rice was more Korean than Chinese - sticky instead of jasmine type of rice.  Interesting.\nDumplings should be ordered first - - as they will take a considerable amount of time.\nService is professional and nice.  The hostess remembered Rob from the week before, including where he sat and what he ordered!  No doubt, I will be back to this place when I need a dumpling fix.   Their prices are also really economical!\n\nBeing Korean, I have no idea whether this is authentic or not.  It's not necessarily authentic that I am looking for - - just some really good food, period.  Goodness knows \"authentic Korean\" doesn't mean it's delicious.... just give me good, tasty food!!", "author": "Grace K."}

People who grew up in Hong Kong during the 60s to 80s might remember having this as street food. But then that's where the gems end. While soy milk and yoh tieou are great comfort food snacks, I dare say their soy milk isn't really that great, and anyone from Yung Ho Taiwan will laugh and cry for paying x2 to x2.5 prices for the same portion (heck even Yung Ho restaurant in Southern California, San Gabriel on Valley Blvd does a better rendition that's more like the real deal). It just sucks we don't have something like that up here.\n\nThe restaurants main menu has more or less stayed the same in the past oh I don't know 15 to 20 years. I know Taiwanese street food has been around 100 years at least, and the fact that the business doesn't keep up to date with food trends, what is considered a good snapshot or representation of Taiwanese food, or innovate means that they continue to offer the same stale standard fare over and over (much like most Chinatown restaurants).\n\nAnd don't get me started about the one in Berkeley...", "author": "Ken K."}

The beef was extremely tender where the meat melted in your mouth.  Great dish and one of the first to be finished.  \n\n3. Rice noodle with tofu with clear broth was another great dish with eggs an mixed vegetables.  Soup was great and the mix of tofu with eggs was also very good.  \n\n4.  Shanghai noodles with spinach, pork and shrimp.  This dish was decent with the shrimp and pork being the stars of the dish.  The flavoring was not quite there for me.  May have needed a bit more soy sauce.  \n\n5. Fried bread and sweet soy milk.  Add your own sugar so that you control how sweet you wanted the milk.  Kids loved it.  The bread did not go as quickly though, but looked good (like a donut).  \n\n6.  Potstickers were nice and large, and above all, tasty.  \n\n7. Shanghai dumplings (siu lung bau) was juicy inside and tasty too.  Both the last dishes takes awhile to cook so came at the end.  \n\nOverall, the food was good but can be considered great based on the price.  For $48 (after tip) we easily fed nine hungry folks - five kids.  \n\nWould definitely go back and order similar items in the near future.", "author": "J Z."}

The zha jiang mian was probably the best dish, as it was a good representation of Taiwanese style zha jiang mian (lighter in color and with a higher water content that Shangdong style and Korean style zha jiang mian).

Their noodles are more flavorful and has more sauce. Long beans with shrimp is a complete disappointment :( The waiter took the wrong order and thought I ordered long beans with rice (without the shrimp). And the long beans were obviously left-over. They weren't only warm.. and very salty. We told them not to put MSG (there's such option on the menu), but couldn't really tell if they really did as ordered. Xiao long bao was okay.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-10-25", "description": "I've been a regular at this restaurant for over 12 years and I've seen a slight decline over the same time - service and cleanliness.  But, here's the bright spot, the food is pretty consistent; albiet consistently greasy and delicious.  Here are my high's and low's....\n\nHIGHS:\n\n- The service is TOOO fast and can sometimes be taken as pressure to eat quickly and leave.  But I like it because I'm only looking for a quick meal and I would rather not wait around here for very long.\n- The food is prepared VERY quickly and some of it right before your very eyes.  When you enter, there is a little chef bay to one side (separated by glass) where their dumplings, chinese doughnuts, potstickers, and other doughy creations are hand made.  At least this station, up in the public eye, is kept relatively clean and you can witness the necessary skill to prepare your food.\n- MOST of their dishes are authentic and well cooked.  You will get generous portions for the price you pay - which is laughingly only very little, considering that this is San Francisco.\n\nLOWS:\n\n- This place would be shut down for sanitary reasons if the health dept guy wasn't a family friend.  They really do need to clean the dining area better.  I don't think their back kitchen is any dirtier than your typical Chinese restaurant, so I won't complain about that.  I agree that the bathrooms should be overhauled at least once soon.\n- The same generous portions are usually served swimming in oil/grease.  But hey, sometimes I actually like the additional lubrication!!  When/if you order the pan-fried rice cakes, you'll understand why (and for gawd's sakes, get it done dry - not too saucy).\n- I've noticed that the waitstaff are not that friendly to white customers.  I walk in, speak Cantonese, and they're still not that friendly, but at least I get what I want (most of them speak Mandarin).  Most of the staff do not understand English - which generally means lower quality service, but more authentic food.  You be the judge?\n- Don't wander too far off the core of the menu (it's like ordering pizza at a BBQ restaurant).  Even though the namesake is Taiwan, some of the more authentic dishes are NOT well prepared and shouldn't even be on the menu.  A prime example is their oyster noodles AKA \"o wa mee swa\" or \"euh ah mi swa\".  This, even as it is served, is a pathetic bowl of colorless broth, NO OYSTERS, NO FLAVOR, crappy FAT noodles (I don't need to go on).\n- DO order what most people at the next table order and what they're well-known for:  potstickers, soup/fried noodles, chinese doughnuts, onion pancakes, steamed dumplings, and sweet/salty soybean milk.\n- I don't order their rice dishes simply for the reason that there are better places that specialize in it.  OK, the prices are cheap and you might enjoy them, so do what makes you happy - it's all good.\n\nAnd lastly, I hope they never change the pink paint outside.  It's not very good looking, but SO EASY to spot.  There is also a Taiwan restaurant in Berkeley on University, but I haven't been to that one in over 10 years.  I prefer this SF location because of their specialties.  I used to eat dinner at the Berkeley place because it was $4.95/dish and it was VERY good for the price when I was in college.", "author": "Alex J."}

The homemade dumplings are delicious, cheap & man-size here-- you can watch the cook in the window stuffing endless baskets of them during your short wait to be seated. This is a mom and pop operation, so I don't expect great service.  The thick Shanghai pan fried noodles are satisfying.

Taiwan Restaurant does this dish VERY well, the best zha jiang mien i've had outside of Taiwan. this dish is also HUGE, as are all portions at this restaurant (this dish served me for 3 meals). the noodles were also excellent, chewy and fresh. \n\n- chinese doughnuts & hot soy milk:\ngood, not great (like all yiu tiao, too oily to be eaten often); the yiu tiao are very good, more doughy than normal, though i like that, and still retaining that crispy exterior; super fresh (i first walked in here b/c i saw the guys making them fresh in the window), and huge. the soy milk was ok; fresh, though you add your own sugar or salt to taste. i prefer when they add the flavoring, since the sugar incorporates better and faster. \n\n- pork dumplings:\nsolidly good; extremely fresh---they make them to order i believe (as in stuffing, wrapping, and steaming per order), and are ginormously stuffed to near-bursting. the skins are thicker than i like, but they're still very good. like eating mini pork&veggie buns. \n\n- pork chop fried rice:\nreally good; though, they don't include the stewed egg or ground pork stew here.  the pork chop is great (crisp, but juicy and tender, with a sweetish seasoning). also includes the requisite chopped mustard greens and my favorite, sour pickled veggies (i love these so much i wanted to ask for more on the side). \n\n- mustard greens & shredded pork noodle soup:\ngood; esp nice on a cold night. the broth is light but substantial, very clear flavors. noodles in this were great as well (i think they make anything using dough fresh in-house, there's just no accounting for that taste and texture).\n\nthis is a great place for inexpensive, tasty, fresh taiwanese food w/super generous portions. the service is decent, they're actually friendlier and more helpful than many chinese joints--- if you get the older waitresses (the younger ones, i think the kids of the owner? not so much. not that they're incompetent, just not as attentive and quick). those older ladies know what they're about. \n\ni only wish that (1) this place was closer to me (though SF is better than going to SJ, and waaay closer than LA), and (2) they would include tzo dofu and fan tuan on the menu here", "author": "L C."}

The food was ready in about 15 min (not 10 min), but it was worth the weight.  The soup was so good and authentic. It had 2 shrimps in it.  The chow mein was good and had 5 shrimps, but were big pieces.  The beans were good, too.  The rice was dry, and the lemon chicken was so-so.  I'd go back and order the soup again and the beans.  I finally found a good and reliable Chinese place!  P.S.  Check the cartons when you look in the bag, most of it had opened when I got home, and my BF spilled the green beans on the table.", "author": "Jen C."}

Looooove the steamed chicken dumplings.  And the noodles, get the noodles. You can see the chefs making the dough as you come in too.  I could eat here for a while and not get tired of it, which I can't say the same for a lot of chinese restaurants.", "author": "Priscilla P."}

You can have a good meal feeding two or three with less than $20.  Don't forget the potstickers and the soy milk.  The soy milk is made fresh.  The shanghai noodles are good too.  The pork chop over rice is tasty too.  They deep fry the pork job.", "author": "Amy V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-08", "description": "i have been going to this restaurant for many years now.  used to come here pretty often.  so much so that one of the chefs that makes the potstickers and shanghai dumplings would remember what we ordered each time and prepare our potstickers as soon as we sat down.  had a major craving for shanghai dumplings after i came back from my trip to china, so i thought i'd try to relive the memory of eating shanghai dumplings in shanghai by coming to taiwan restaurant.  i've never been disappointed by this restaurant before, but nothing compares to eating REAL shanghai dumplings in shanghai.  unfortunately, when i took a bite of my shanghai dumpling, it didn't bring me back to shanghai.  don't get me wrong, it was still good, but it just didn't compare to my experience in shanghai.  i guess i somehow was tainted by the experience of eating REAL shanghai dumplings and now nothing else will compare.  overall, taiwan is a good place to eat potstickers, their noodle dishes are tasty and cheap, and their lunch specials (that are only served during weekdays) are well worth the price.  some suggestions to try would be their mustard green and pork soup noodles, szechuan hot sauce noodles, pork chop noodle soup, bean and meat sauce noodle, potstickers (of course) and of course the shanghai dumplings.", "author": "Jeannie W."}

Five Happiness Restaurant (near the corner of Geary and 6th avenue) serves all these authentic dishes, only it tastes WAY better!", "author": "Jenny Y."}
