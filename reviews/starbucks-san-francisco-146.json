I've never had a problem an order at this location. \n\nWhat else... currently they are having a sale for their cold drink merchandise!

I stress mid-morning because it's a rather crazy wait if you come in around the 8-9am rush. I will only do that when I know I have at least 15 minutes to spare before work. \n\nAbout this particular location -- all the drinks are made decently. I haven't had any issues with drinks being too cold or hot, running out of ingredients, or constant misspelling of my name. I would give it 4 stars if there wasn't always a wait! (Sometimes I just give up and end up going to Peet's instead). \n\nThe plus side is the staff are REALLY NICE. They will personally bring out your pastry/bagel, even when it's crowded. They will apologize if your drink is running late. The barista with the spot-on makeup (who looks like she works for Sephora) is really friendly and makes sure you get a hot sample of a drink when they're running promos.\n\nThings to note:\n- Long lines during peak coffee drinking times\n- Plenty of tables to do work, have meetings, or eat lunch \n- Spotty wi-fi.

I figure it's about time I told you all why.\nThe drink order was simple enough, a tall caramel macchiato. The first error was made when a short cup was grabbed. She called it out as a tall drink.\nNow, I am really understanding, and I honestly don't care if you mess up a little on my drink. I told her, \"Oops, I ordered a tall. Don't worry about it, just put it in a tall cup, add a little more milk and it's fine.\"\nShe replied by dumping it out. \"No, I have to start over.\"\nI wasn't in a huge hurry, but I did have to meet up with someone. My boyfriend, who has unlimited patience, was looking at his watch. This was due to the fact that she had now made the milk and shots, and was letting them both sit separately as she made other people's drinks. Then she poured the now dead shots into the foam and covered it with caramel. She proceeded to make other people's drinks before she finally put the lid on it and hand it out to me. It was in-your-face RUDE! To be honest, I didn't want her to make my drink again. I threw it out after we left.\n\nThe most irritating part was that she was so angry at me the entire time and was not talkative, smiling, or polite. She was glaring the whole time. ?!?! WHY?? Certainly it couldn't have been due to me asking for my real drink!?\n\nI have had the WORST service here of ANY Starbucks.

(Yes, Ritual is better than Peets, of course... but when you are working in SOMA, you have Peets or Starbucks).  \n\nStarbucks is making some efforts.  Recently, there was an article about Starbucks finally realizing how bad their food is and deciding to add new food items (there is nothing more deceptive than a Starbucks pastry...looking so yummy and buttery, yet in actuality tasting oh so dry).  \n\nHowever, have they realized how bad their cappuccino is? Or their latte?  \n\nMost days, I go to Peets (Ritual is reserved for the weekends).  However, there are the random days when I am stuck in a town without a Peets.  I am looking forward to the day when I can find Peets in any town.  In the meantime, I will continue to go to Starbucks when I have to, all the while wishing there was a Peets closer by.", "author": "Sooj O."}

No, probably not. \r\n\r\nI hate the door to this place! And it's my own stupidity. The handful of times I've gone in here, I end up looking like it's the first time that my keepers let me into the general population. The front door opens in. That is, when you're on the street, you push. Folks, this is contrary to all of my intrinsic door-opening knowledge. I tried to open the door for someone coming out with a cup in each hand and yanked on the thing four times, staring at the part that says \"PUSH.\" I know, I know...it's labeled right in front of me, but it just doesn't click in my head! \r\n\r\nIf you're here---at New Montgomery and Mission---looking for coffee, please cross the street and go to Cafe Madeleine. Do it. 'Cause I said so. And you won't look like a dork like me. \r\n\r\nSo, two stars because they serve caffeine. And, some days, that's all that gets me to function.", "author": "Erin M."}

I would have given this location 4 stars (out of 5) before I worked here. If anything, working here would lower stars in my book, It did with almost every other place I have worked.\n\nThe door situation isn't starbucks fault, if used to open outward but then the city said the traffic into the building was causing traffing on the sidewalk to change course when people open and closed the door... deal with it, it is clearly labled.\n\nStarbucks is YES a corporation and blah blah, but it still searves a great product. Other little coffee shops may searve coffee in a cuter more \"we're small and lonely\" type way, but the taste of the product is what you want. I personally like starbucks, it's consistent no matter where in the country i go, and the company is a nice comapny who cares about it's employees and the community. What other coffee shop can you go to where they will give the part timers benifits? And also if you work there, you can donate money to charity and starbucks will match your donation. That's a good company.\n\nEhh, if you don't like starbucks you have already stopped reading this, so hello to the rest, and come see me working there, I feel like my whole life is spent in there.\n\nFor tea though, go around the corner to Peets!

And most people know the reputation NYC has for 'customer service.'\nMy 4 yr old loves Starbucks. Always friendly, always delicious (at least the ones in our neighborhood). But this location really threw her for a loop (me as well). We were staying at the Palace Hotel because my husband was attending an Orthopaedic conference. In the 2 1/2 days we stayed we visited three times. The place was definitely busy, most of the customers seemed to be surgeons at the conference with us. I didn't see any customers upset with the wait time and they all seemed happy to be at Starbucks, but for some reason the employees gave the impression that they were completely annoyed with our presence. Perhaps the place is usually empty and quiet? Not only were they annoyed, as I sat there with my girls we could see a lot of snickering and inside joking. They had a \"this job would be great if it weren't for having to help customers\" attitude. No friendly greeting or smiles, just \"What can I get you?\" And the sad part is it wasn't the same person who was unfriendly each time we came in, it was all of them. \nI've never seen so many employees in the customer service industry who clearly have a disdain for serving customers. Even my 4-yr old asked why they were so 'mad' there. I noticed a few 5 star reviews noting friendly baristas, but I can only assume those employees have since moved on.\nNext time we'll look for a different location, even if it means walking a few extra blocks. I hate that we left feeling like we just asked for way too much. All we ordered was a kid's hot chocolate with no special requests, but I guess it was too much to ask???", "author": "Mae S."}

I thought I'd be able to get away with writing just one, all-encompassing review of Starbucks, with a special focus on my wonderfully efficient \"branch 'bucks\" (the one in my office building).\n\nBut after my experience 20 minutes ago at the New Montgomery outlet, I now realize that I'm going to have to cast a wider net.  Each Starbucks has its own personality, no matter how corporate it may seem--and the personality of the New Montgomery Starbucks is 100% witch-spelled-with-a-\"b\".\n\nAdmittedly, it was my bad for walking in there with only a buck-fifty, knowing full well that my tall Americano is $1.70.  But that's why I have a credit card--to cover my arse in situations such as this. \n\nI ordered my drink from the rather sour looking girl behind the counter, and handed her my card.  She swiped it through the reader--once, twice, three times, four...you get the picture.  I apologized--once, twice, three times, four...again, you get the picture.  The line was growing.  She punched in my card number, fumbled more with the register.  My Americano was sitting there at the counter, waiting for me.  She'd mis-entered the number; it wasn't going through.\n\nIn a moment of desperation, I said, \"Let me go get some cash for you.\"  She looked at me long and hard, and glared.  \"No,\" she said, emphatically, obnoxiously, looking down her nose at me.  \"No?\" I replied, nonplussed.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe picked up my coffee, and she threw it away.\n\nWhat?  Was she kidding me?  I'd volunteered to go get cash and come back for my (cold) coffee.  I wasn't suggesting that I steal it.  And what's more, just last week the same thing happened to a woman a few places in front of me in line at my wonderfully efficient branch 'bucks, and they'd handled the situation with nothing short of competence and class.", "author": "Hannah J."}
