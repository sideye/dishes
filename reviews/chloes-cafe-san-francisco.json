The tiny-ness is definitely felt if you have to use the crazy tiny restroom which I'm sure the employees love. \nWhat this place lacks for in size is totally made up for in the quality of their food. Their specials all sounded so so good and I ended up picking the scramble with Brie, artichoke, veggies, and walnut toast, and my sister had their famous croissant French toast with strawberries.\n\nYou know that feeling you get when you are full and you can't imagine taking another bite? Well, I ignored that and finished my food because it would've turned into severe regret on the drive back home. \n\nThere is so much on their menu but if I must recommend anything, you need to try their specials!

Overall, it's more like a croissant pancake. A little bit of powdered sugar, butter, and a drizzle of syrup. Delicious!\n\nFor something savory we picked the bacon and tomato scrambled eggs.

Given it was windy outside, my fam and I wanted to get a table inside. We had already waited for over an hour, but for some reason, a party of 3 was seated before my family of 4. Of course we were a little frustrated. But when we approached the waiter about why we still weren't being seated, he explained that the table was too small, and that we would be seated when the next available table was open. This didn't make sense at all, because the last party who had been sitting at that table was a party of 5.\n\nBesides the issue with seating, I really enjoyed the food at Chloe's Cafe. I can tell that everything on the menu is made fresh with high-quality ingredients. Prices also aren't too bad, considering that this is a brunch place in SF, and the portions are very, very reasonable. I got the special, which was a veggie-filled scramble (spinach, portobello, and roasted bell pepper) plus two sides (I chose a green salad and fruit cup).

It's got that diner-esque charm, without it looking like a diner and the service is very attentive (my coffee cup was refilled constantly, which I appreciated).\n\nWe arrived around 10:30/11AM on a Sunday and didn't face a wait (as a party of two), which was amazing. The menu features fantastic breakfast staples and they are happy to make adjustments for you. Everything is pretty reasonably priced for brunch at about $11-14 per dish. I knew I wanted scrambled eggs, but not exactly with the same toppings as the dishes on the menu. So, I told my waiter I just wanted scrambled eggs with spinach and mushroom and he was happy to get that ordered for me rather than fussing that it's not on the menu - plus points here. Each scrambled eggs dish comes with two sides and you can choose from home fries (these are delicious!) toast, fresh fruit and a salad. I chose the latter two. My friend ordered the breakfast bagel sandwich with home fries and toast.\n\nThe food came out pretty quickly! And I found the portions to be generous.

This combo seemed pretty lit, but I'm used to having scrambled eggs that literally burst with flavor -- at home, I use cumin, garlic, a bit of rosemary, and soy sauce and so I should have foreseen the lack of flavor, but we live and we learn. On the scale of being blown away, I would rate this a sneeze. Upsides though: Chloe's is very cozy, had great view outside, and is a cute cafe. Intermittent fruit flies did not an incredible dining experience make, but that I do understand is not something the cafe can control on a granular level. The waitstaff was incredibly attentive and friendly, and asked my friend if she wanted coffee more than my mom has ever asked me to clean up my room. I would say that I should have paid 1/4 of what I did that day for what I got -- a salad and then simple scrambled eggs. I'll order something else next time (probably lunch) and give this place another go -- it was ruffling with some potential.", "author": "Celena C."}

After a lovely evening with friends, I stayed over and was promised such a brunch.  Within a short walk, we arrived around 9:15am and put our names on the already growing list for seating.  \n\nIt's a quaint place, with outdoor seating as well, but considering it was still chilly this Dec. morning, we opted for inside only.  The wait was not too long, while we snuck a peak through the window to see what people were having.  \n\nWe got a table for 2 right in the middle, kinda near the door. When my friend asked to be moved to a corner table, since she was catching a cold, they accommodated and were very nice about it.\n\nBased on the menu and our preferences that morning, I ordered the smoked salmon scramble with capers, with sesame bagel and cream cheese and mixed fruit.  Delicious!! And the bagel was toasted just right, and coming from this picky Jersey girl, who knows a good bagel when she eats one.  My friend had the pancakes and scrambled eggs and potatoes. It was plenty for her, as she had some left overs to go.\n\nThe decor was festive with Christmas decorations and lights. The ambiance was cozy and just the right amount of chatter.  The service was very attentive and they came to refill coffees several times.\n\nA brunch winner!! What a great way to start the day.

He was rude to one of my friends in particular, ever since she got there until we left. I didn't quite understand why, maybe because she arrived and ordered after us? But is this a good reason to have an incredibly bad attitude towards a customer during her lunch? \nAt the end, he charged us twice for a sandwich and besides that he wrote (by hand) a higher amount for that sandwich. I understand, it happens, but instead of \"sorry, let me correct it\", he screamed at us \"this is what happens when you add things to an order\" and  screamed again \"you are not supposed to split bills\" - Although we did not ask for a split check. Every other customer was looking at us at that time and we felt very badly, like we did something wrong. We did do something wrong - by simply going there. A nice lunch turned into a very unpleasant experience. Too bad for the other server - she was actually pretty nice.\nP.S.

By far the best part of that meal were those crispy potatoes. They were super crisp on the outside while soft on the inside. I definitely recommend coming here.

I was outside and he still came by the perfect number of times to see if I needed anything. \n\nUnfortunately for me, their card reader was down so I had to use a random atm across the street to get cash which cost me 2.76 to use plus a 2.50 fee from my bank. \n\nAside from that little issue, I had a great breakfast and will definitely be back for some more now that I work at the 24 hour fitness up the street", "author": "Grant H."}

Obviously, very \"budget-friendly\" places.  \n\nAs a broke college student, I thought to myself, \"Shoot, I could do $20 a day in San Francisco!\"\n\nPass forward a decade, unless you stick to $1.50 tacos and $2 baos (do these still even exist?) at ethnic dives,  good phuckin' luck on getting through San Francisco with $100 a day. Remember, San Francisco is home of the $15 cup of coffee that sold out before the day was over. \n\nI rarely go out for breakfast and the last time I did was 4 months ago at Chloe's Caf\u00e9. I'm so out of touch with breakfast prices that my jaw slammed to the ground when the bill came: $30 pp for some French toast and a cup of tea in a tiny mom & pop caf\u00e9?! Thank goodness for Mr. Visa (just don't tell my mom that)!\n\nI've passed by Chloe's hundreds of times and there's always a large crowd on the weekends (tiny space that fits 20 inside and 4 outdoor tables). I came on a random Monday afternoon with a friend and there was no wait. We sat outside since we had our furbabies with us: http://bit.ly/1ZAj852.\n\nSince I'm not a breakfast food person, I contemplated getting a salad or sandwich. Then again, that's like ordering fish at a steakhouse so we decided to go ham on breakfast. I ordered the much raved about Cinnamon Croissant French Toast w/ fresh strawberries ($13.95): http://bit.ly/25olWXh and my friend ordered the Cranberry Almond Pancake & Banana Walnut Pancake w/ scrambled eggs, fresh fruit ($15.50): http://bit.ly/1pBCydm. \n\nThe cinnamon croissant french toast was lightly crisp and custardy. The plump strawberry and banana were perfectly ripe and sweet. The real maple syrup tied everything together.\n\nI had two bites of my friend's pancakes which were ginormous. Both were fluffy and chock-full of fruits and nuts.  As I like banana walnut bread, I favored the banana walnut pancake over the cranberry almond one. \n\nWe ordered a side of chicken sausage ($3.95) for the pups. I had a bite and it was a bit burnt but had a nice savory sweetness. \n\nLove the servers here - they're amiable, cheery, and attentive. We came for a late brunch so these guys must have been working since 6 am and they still managed to be all smiles. Tsk tsk to the inconsiderate couple who walked in 8 minutes before closing at 2:52 pm and wanted to dine in! The servers were nice enough to allow them to dine in even though they were closing up shop for the day. \n\nChloe's is tiny so NOT recommended for any groups larger than four. The restroom is even tinier and is behind the kitchen (kind of awkward). It's smaller than a closet and the sink is outside. \n\nStreet parking is easy compared to other parts of the city. I've never had issues with parking in this part of Noe Valley on the weekdays or the weekends. \n\nBrunch at Chloe's was satisfying but not something I would wait an hour for on the weekends. Additionally, $30 pp (including tip) for some French toast and a cup of tea is pricey. \n\nWould love to see Rachael Ray come back to San Francisco and have at it with $40 a day!

It is the yummy veggie/egg scramble with mozzarella cheese and comes with potatoes/fruit and toast. It is extremely tasty and filling. The potatoes at Chloe's are sooooo good and spiced well that I just have to opt for them over the fruit, even though the fruit is at no extra charge and is more than your standard fruit salad. The bread that Chloe's uses for their toast is also fabulous, I believe it is from Acme. \n\nI have also sampled their pancakes and french toast, both of which are better than average. I do definitely prefer their french toast since it is more unique, though. I believe it is brioche french toast, if I remember correctly.

I ordered the special that includes 2 eggs, potatoes (but substituted fresh mixed fruit) plus 2 pancakes. For a few dollars more, you can either order banana/walnut style or weekly pancake special (this week was blueberry and slivered almonds).\nThe pancake was deeeeeeelicious!! Eggs were fresh scrambled as requested and the fruit was very fresh and included 5 types i.e. blueberries, strawberries, sliced banana, cantaloupe and honeydew melon. I also ordered coffee which was hot and robust in flavor.\nI highly recommend Chloe's Cafe on Church Street!", "author": "Steve F."}

The outside doesn't have a tarp though so hopefully it doesn't start raining mid meal. I went with a group of 6 and there's pretty much no space for a party that big inside. We sat outside and were a bit tight squeezed...we didn't really mind it though. \n\nIt's a quaint little spot, but the food was delicious! I got the Avocado and Cheese scramble...but no cheese, and added bacon. So I basically made my own Scramble. I'm glad I did though because it was great! The potato rosemary bread was divine. \n\nThe service was very friendly, but I felt like it could have a been a bit more prompt.

Eggs came out wonderfully fluffy with some very big chunks of salmon. The dill and capers paired with the salmon nicely giving it a very yummy savory flavor. The potatoes came out nice and crunchy, just the way I like them! English muffin came out slightly over cooked, but I actually prefer it that way. The serving was also pretty big which my stomach appreciated after a night of drinking.\n\nSERVICE- Honestly some of the best service I've had in awhile. Our waitress was very polite, told us about the special for the day, and was constantly checking up on us, refilling our tea with hot water. She also seemed very sincere with her service, compared to many other places these days where they just go through the motions.

It's in a great location so we had high hopes for a bomb-ass meal. The service was great - really friendly staff; I wasn't even bothered by the small size of the restaurant, but this place has GOT to get their prices under control. Firstly, everything costs extra - even the freaking tomatoes. I was feeling boujee so I was down to spend some MONEY on a good breakfast, figuring the portions must be really big (so you get your money's worth, duh). Big mistake. Huge. Pretty sure I paid close to $5 for tomatoes to be added to my omelette, thinking there would be a heaping supply. Boy was I wrong. Paid $5 for a sprinkle of tomatoes. Yikes. Same with the bacon. By all means, I'm down to spend money on some bacon but not if it's an over cooked MESS. In my days, I've eaten many a burnt bacon but this was pretty bad. I didn't even finish it. Gordon Ramsay would spit on this bacon. Secondly, don't get the cappuccino. Our waiter said it was his specialty and that he likes to make it strong. Cool, I love strong coffee. What I do not love: burnt coffee. Double yikes. We were sure to finish it because it was expensive - like $5+ if I remember right! Though, we pretty much chugged it like you would alcohol in a plastic bottle, trying to avoid as much taste as possible. \n\nAll in all, this place is cute if you're a rich tech kid with terrible taste or an insanely wealthy family with kids who don't care about seasoned food. 10/10 for location, 10/10 for staff, but if I wanted to waste $20-$30 on a half-ass meal, I'd rather go LITERALLY anywhere else. Sure, this city is expensive and meals can get pretty pricey, but even over-priced hipster restaurants deliver delicious food. Is this what the city is reduced to? Over-charging a mediocre meal to pay rent? Welcome to San Francisco.", "author": "Cassandra A."}

I was going to sit at the corner table inside but noticed there were constantly two bugs (fries) flying around which was super annoying..... moved one table to the left instead.\n\nHeard about how good their croissant french toast is, but it was a scramble egg kind of day, so I ordered their special scramble on the Today's Special menu.\n\n[Special Scramble]: B+\nDescription: two scrambled eggs with mushroom, basil, red onion, sun-dried tomato and mozzarella cheese. Picked a cup of fruit as side and rosemary toast.\n\nIt was alright. Didn't really feel anything \"special\" of it. Personally I would prefer more mozzarella cheese because I could only feel the cheesy texture but nothing from the smell nor the taste. There was a strong flavor of sun-dried tomato and probably that's why it covers the tastes from other ingredients. Portion is acceptable. Rosemary toast was pretty good. Fruit was okay-fresh.\n\nNot sure if I am impressed by this place but since its close by, I think I would still come back to try their croissant french toast and smoked salmon as well.

I've never bothered to write reviews before, but the staff really deserves a shout out for the professional way they handled a difficult situation. \n\nIt's a long story so I won't get into it here, but the basic premise is that a difficult customer wants to jump the waitlist and take a table the manager was intending on giving to us (we were the next in line). Said man begins acting like a spoiled child, shouting things along the lines of \"IS THIS FAIR?!\" when the manager refuses. Did I mention there were other tables available inside, but he refused all of them, stating that he MUST sit outside? \n\nAnyway, I went up to the manager and basically said that we would give the man the table he wanted and sit in one of the other open tables. She was apologetic and expressed how thankful she was. Later, when it was time to pay the bill, the manager refuses my card, stating that the meal was on the house because she wanted to thank us for being so accommodating. The lady was just doing her job, yet she felt the need to thank us for simply being reasonable! And we ordered at least 50 dollars worth of food. \n\nI would have left a generous tip if I was carrying any cash, but I guess a review will have to do.

Needless to say, it is very aesthetically pleasing (Instagram-Like magnet). The cinnamon is not over-bearing, especially if you drown your toast in syrup. The Croissant Toast is like defined layers of sugar and buttery goodness. Soft to the bite, and sweet to the touch. Don't worry, there is no diabetes or cholesterol in a fairy tale : )\n\nI saw a couple of peeps with reading material coming solo to Chloe's. I think I'll like to try that too.

Well, depending on the time or the line here, sometimes Toast or Fattoush... Catching brunch before 10AM is usually the best bet, most people in SF don't wake up until 10AM on the weekends, but after that the wait at Chloe's Cafe is usually 30-60 mins.\n\nChloe's Cafe has a great spot right on the corner. Big open windows to see inside and plenty of table seating outside, when it's nice enough (which come on, it's almost always perfect in SF). The wait is never too bad, most people usually have dogs and are pretty friendly. I usually prefer outside, the inside gets a little cramped and noisy sometimes.\n\nOnce you are seated, the staff is great about refilling water/coffee. The food is of course excellent. The scrambles are usually my favorite, with fruit and a side of bacon. The fruit across all the dishes here is always fresh and tasty! Which brings me to the french toast with fresh strawberries, always delicious. The salads are surprisingly good for brunch as well.\n\nOnly downside is cash only.", "author": "Matt B."}

They offer scrambles, pancakes, and salads and sandwiches.\n\n*Special Scramble ($10.95): this changes everyday. Mine is a scramble with portobello mushroom, diced red bell peppers and Jarlsberg cheese. Egg is fluffy and there's plenty to eat.

Their croissant French toast also looks yummy with lots of strawberries.\n\nOverall it's a decent experience. Hearty breakfast with friendly service.

The menu had a good variety of items to order from. After eyeballing the selections after a while, I finally decided to go with the avocado and jarlsberg cheese egg scramble with white rosemary toast. My friend ordered the tomato and bacon egg scramble with home fries. We both decided to share an order of banana walnut pancakes and let me tell you... it was so delicious! Gluttony at its finest. \n\nI'm not normally a breakfast type of person, but I do have to say that I enjoyed the meal very much so. Everything was cooked to perfection and the pancakes were amazing, chock full of walnuts! I believe that whenever a menu item describes itself as such, I better see plenty of that specified ingredient. Chloe's Cafe did not let me down. No skimping on ingredients here!\n\nI definitely recommend Chloe's cafe for all you breakfast/brunch people out there and even those who aren't so much into breakfast, like myself. I highly doubt you'll be disappointed. Keep in mind that seating is limited; however, the wait does not take too long to be seated. I waited approximately 5 minutes for indoor seating. Outdoor seating would've been much less.\n\nI'm so glad that my friend enlightened me to this place! Maybe I'll be more open minded to breakfast joints from now on! All thanks to Chloe's. \n\nGreat neighborhood spot! The service was great.", "author": "Ann S."}

Okay, maybe this breakfast isn't that balanced, considering the high sugar content...but nevertheless it's so good! I was on Yelp with my friend trying to find a place for brunch that wasn't closed yet (it was 2:00pm when we started our food search)..and behold Chloe's Cafe in Noe Valley, San Francisco. \n\nFOOD\nLet me start off by talking about the Banana Walnut Pancakes--they had like the perfect proportion of walnuts to bananas to pancake mix. The pancakes were so soft and fluffy. I really didn't need to add the syrup because the bananas were sweet enough.\n\nNext up is the Croissant French Toast. When I took my first bite, I was seriously confused. I really couldn't say I was eating a croissant, or french toast. It was hard to convince myself that it is a hybrid of croissant and french toast. But I loved it! One thing to note is that the price for strawberries is seasonal--we added $4 for some strawberries, which is kind of a splurge.\n\nVENUE\nThe reviewers were right. Chloe's Cafe is very small (less than 10 tables), but gives off a \"homey\" feel with its simple old-fashioned tablecloths and wooden wall-panels.\n\nWould come back.", "author": "Vicki C."}

With no more than 20 seats, it's compact and simple. Yet, from the table covers to the accents of the outside architecture, there is something so blissful about it. \n\nWe came on a Sunday afternoon for brunch, and they were surprisingly able to fit all 6 of us quickly. Any more and they might've had some trouble.\n\n- Croissant French Toast w/Strawberries: Deliciously fluffy and not too sweet. If you get french toast anywhere else, they'll pack loads of sugar into it. Here, they sprinkle a bit of powdered sugar and cinnamon, but the rest is up to you with syrup. The strawberries are definitely worth it, especially when topped with cinnamon and more powdered sugar. The small portion (2 pieces) is more than enough.\n\n- Grilled Ham, Roasted Red Bell Pepper And Jarlsberg On Croissant: Served with grilled potatoes, cucumber, onion, and ketchup. This was my friend's order and I got to try a bit of it. Simple, but delicious. It's warm but not overcooked. The ingredients all blend together wonderfully. The potatoes are nothing special and make a nice side dish.\n\n- Banana Walnut Pancakes: My friend couldn't finish his, so I helped him about a bit. You get the soothing aroma and taste of banana, with the crunchy texture of walnut, all in a dish I usually avoid at breakfast places for its blandness. To quote my friend, these are \"bomb dot com.\" \n\nService is attentive and friendly. You'll often see an elderly lady running around with ingredients, who just might be Chloe. Two other servers seem like her daughters and are always on their feet helping out customers. Seems like a honest family-run establishment, which I can always have respect for.", "author": "Dmitriy S."}

That's the part where you're actually eating...\n\nIt started with us driving around the Noe Valley area, trying like bonkers to find a place to park on street. It was Saturday morning, and apparently everyone in the neighborhood had the very same idea. Trying to find a parking space was like urban combat. We found metered parking 6 blocks away. Not the end of the world, it's a neat area to window shop and people watch!\n\nWe visited Chloe's for the first time, and found that there was a pretty good line outside. This is a tiny little hole in the wall neighborhood breakfast joint and it sure was crowded. We immediately noticed that the very limited number of staff did the work of 20 people each! They greeted everyone that walked up to the sidewalk sign in chart to put yourself in line for a table. The waitstaff chatted us up a little bit then rushed off to deliver food and attend to dining guests.\n\nWe soon discovered that the inside dining area was teeny time, as was the food preparation area. It is actually awesome because you can watch your food being prepared and delivered, and it is a very cozy, very clean, very nicely decorated place. Like eating at your Aunt Alice's for family brunch!\n\nWe ordered a ham and sausage omelette, banana Walnut pancakes, and croissant strawberry French toast. The food came out pretty quickly, and the attentive waitstaff kept the coffee coming. The food presentation was truly amazing. Each of the breakfast items came with gloriously prepared and displayed fresh fruit. The portions were very very hearty. The pancakes were fluffy contact with walnuts and banana the strawberry French toast was loaded with fresh sweet strawberries.

Food and service are also on point. Love!\n\nMy friend and I got the following delish and highly recommended breakfast items: Avocado & Jarlsberg Cheese Scramble, Red Potato, Cheddar & Onion Scramble, and the Banana Walnut Pancakes. \n\nWe originally did not order all three, just the first two. Then my friend found a hair in her scramble and discretly flagged our waitress. The waitress apologized profusely and took it away. She came back with a menu and asked my friend if she would prefer something else so we decided to go with the Banana Walnut Pancakes. What a good move since it was so scrumptious!\n\n        --Avocado & Jarlsberg Cheese Scramble: You can easily mess up such a combination by making it too bland, but they know how to pair the correct cheese so it's not too lacking nor too bold for a scramble. The lively green avocado was a buttery, velvety addition. I highly recommend this one, especially to you skeptics!\n\n        --Red Potato, Cheddar, & Onion Scramble: This scramble could've easily been too salty provided the cheddar but they added just enough! It could've been too starchy, but the potatoes were cooked just right. Delicious for the most part until we found the little uninvited strand. \n\n        --Banana Walnut Pancakes: I'm not a pancake person since I quickly grow tired of the cakey taste. BUT, these were exceptional! Paired with some maple syrup... they were divine. Absolutely divine. I most definitely would get these again.\n\nIn being sincerely apologetic for the previous mishap with one of the scrambles, they only charged us for one meal.

Anyway, you make of this what you will. :P\n\nSpecial Scramble - We got the special scramble of the day.  I forget what was all in there, but I remember the sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and lots of other stuff. Haha. It was good, came with home fries, and toast.", "author": "Dolores L."}

It's good, but it's not like OH MY GOD THIS IS GOING TO KILL ME GOOD.\n\nThe lines outside Chloe's on weekends is way too long. I never come here on weekends. I don't understand why people would stand in line for 40+ min to get scrambled eggs. Let's just say I never wait for scrambled eggs.\n\nThat being said, I eat here very often. Often enough to see some why it's great.\n\nWhy I think Chloe's is one of the most crowded brunch place in my hood:\n\n--- CONSISTENCY. Yes, I just realized that. No matter what day you go, when you go, the food will always taste the way you tasted the first time. The eggs are never runny, the toast are never burned, and the coffee is the same. For this point alone, I think this place rocks.\n\n--- Their scrambled eggs probably uses butter (and maybe dash of milk) in it, because it's much more tasty than your averaged scrambled eggs. Top it with some black pepper too!\n\n--- Their pancakes are always good. Sometimes they have special pancakes where they throw in some almonds and fruit, but it's pretty much always the same good stuff.\n\n\nHere's some minor points I don't like about Chloe's:\n\n--- cash only. There is an ATM machine in the corner store next door, but still. I don't like it.\n--- small menu. This is both a blessing and a curse. If I don't want scrambled eggs or pancakes, I'm out of luck.\n--- too long of a wait on weekends.

Fantastic. The eggs tasted super fresh (and I normally wouldn't be able to decipher between different tastes of eggs, but these tasted GREAT) and I swear the food was served less than 15 minutes after we ordered. Quick. \n- banana walnut pancakes with standard eggs scramble and fruit.

So good that you don't even need to drizzle it with syrup. \n\nIf you're looking for wholesome breakfast foods that won't break the bank and without the greasy after-feeling (you know, that food coma feeling you get after devouring too much poorly made hash browns and rubbery sausage links), come to Chloe's.", "author": "Helen W."}

First, it's clean and has the feel of a classic breakfast spot. It appears that there is often a line from the reviews. Other that the size, or lack options, I'm not sure why there would be a line.\n\nThe potatoes were  a little burned. They only make scrambled eggs. Let me say that again...THEY ONLY MAKE SCRAMBLED EGGS. I typically don't eat scrambled eggs since they make me vomit if not perfectly cooked. But the eggs were fluffy and well prepaird.  \n\nThe bacon was like sizzelean. Not high quality. Kind of like cruise ship bacon.\nNot thick and too fatty. The coffee was good and the service was attentive. A few changes, like a fried  or poached egg and better meat would make this a 5 star place.", "author": "Andrew H."}

I've seen the brutal wait around brunch time on the weekend and loved that we were able to walk in and be seated. We kept flipping back and forth, back and forth on the menu since almost everything on that menu made my stomach growl. Decision making for even minor issues like that is not my thing because I tend to overthink and analyze so I had to discuss and outweight what I want and didn't want to finally be able to decipher what I was going to order. This drives my husband crazy. \n\nThe food had a very homemade appeal to it which also reminded me of the stuff my mom cooked up in the morning when we had large breakfasts with the entire family. I enjoyed my dish and so did my husband. Service was quick and attentive.

Our food arrived super fast and hot. A good thing as we were hungry. Overall they meal was a nice tasting plate - but the baked goods werent nearly as imporessive as in the past.

Light and fluffy and delicious.  They tasted really fresh.  I also added cheese to them.  They are very specific about the cheese they serve, which is awesome, they name the type of cheddar, they don't just say \"cheddar\".\n\nAnother great quality of Chloe's is that they have an option that is both sweet and savory - eggs, pancakes, and fruit.  YES!  This way I didn't have to make the usual difficult brunch decision of either sweet or savory - I had both!  I also sampled my friend's cinnamon french toast with strawberries and it was sooo good.  \n\nService is friendly and super fast.", "author": "Natalee F."}

Pancakes were thick, luscious and doughy, each imported from Chile berry popping perfectly in my mouth--if you're a thin pancake person you won't appreciate these, but I thought they were great.  What a pleasant surprise that they come with real maple syrup, a rarities these days.  My 3-stack was filling, but the pancakes could have been a shade larger, given that I saw a 2 stack go by that looked plate sized, and I got envious--but overall, I think we were both glad that we stuck it out.\n\nCash only, but there is an ATM across the street.

You can choose to sit inside the small cafe or outside on the sidewalk area, perfect for a sunny San Francisco day (because there are so many of those...). \n\nI have tried the strawberry cinnamon croissant french toast, an avocado/jarlsberg cheese/chicken apple sausage scramble, and a pesto sundried tomatoes mushroom and cheese scramble (brunch special that varies by day). The croissant french toast is a truly unique concoction topped with syrupy sweetness, powdered sugar, and fresh ripe strawberries. I personally like the scrambles more, although the avocado one didn't knock me off my feet like the pesto scramble did. Something about the way avocado mixed with Jarlsberg cheese in one bite...not my thing. The pesto, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes, though, make for an amazing combination of flavor, and the eggs are scrambled just right so they are still fluffy. The home fries are also delicious, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, not overcooked and dry like a lot of other brunch places. \n\nThe service is great - everyone is very friendly and attentive. My friend loves to guzzle water and the waiter came by and refilled her glass (and occasionally mine, once every 5 times he came around) at least 15 times in a meal.

The atmosphere of the cafe was very \"homey\" and it wasn't dead nor was it overly packed. You have to put your name on a list because it's very tiny and I only waited 5 minutes before seated. I felt like the people eating there were all regulars and knew each other by first names or whatnot. Was everyone neighbors? \n\nPALATE 411.\nAs a recent vegetarian, i've decided to go for the scramble all under $10 bucks whichever you choose. Here's my order: WHITE ROSEMARY TOAST, SCAMBLE WITH UNION RED AND GREEN PEPPERS, BOWL OF FRESH FRUIT, and a side of the house potatoes (had a choice between fruit and potatoes, i couldn't decide so i got both). \n\nAMAZING. I've never had White Rosemary Toast. Loved the herb flavor. Had some jam but wish there was a selection of jam. My scramble was very flavorful and delicious, who needs meat!!! the bowl of fruit was so pretty and the fruits were sweet (except for the melon at the bottom). The house potatoes were regular house potatoes. nothing that would make my mouth water. Next time when i come back, i'll know to order the bowl of fruit over the house potatoes. \n\nThe one thing that really make me fall in love with this place was the community. Everyone seems very friendly and local. The owners and service was on point and loved their hospitality. It's a small venue but two elderly couple in wheel chairs were very welcomed in, everyone knew them, the owners talked with them as if they've known each other for ages, it's that homey and you can it's always packed because the regulars definately come back. it was very beautiful to see. \n\nI, MYSELF, will definately be back.\n\n\nUntil the next review....", "author": "Jane A."}

At the suggestion of my daughter (who lives here), we selected the Chloe Salad and have to say that it was impressively presented yet simple and satisfying. As a foodie and a critic-at-large about eateries, Chloe used very fresh-tasting ingredients (except the tomatoes were underwhelming, of course, for this time of the year) and a savory house dressing.\n\nService was attentive, friendly. It's a neighborhood cafe which gives it a local appeal and, in considering this category, deserves 3.5 stars.\n\nUpdate: March 3. Had their egg scramble special which included choice of cheese, red onion, spinach, and broccoli that was cooked to perfection. Broccoli is often difficult to include in egg dishes because it can be too undercooked or cooked almost beyond recognition. But Choe found the perfect balance. Accompanied by fruit salad and sour dough toast (other bread options exist), it was a delicious breakfast. This cafe seems to be vegetable-forward rather than the meat-centric offerings in similar venues. Their attention to balancing what each vegetable offers an egg scramble is evident with every bite.\n\nWith this second trip, I would encourage others to embrace this local gem. It's definitely a 3.5.", "author": "Kathryn R."}

The Streetfood Fest made the Mission a no-go zone, and we didn't want to wait anywhere for more than 20 minutes. Chloe's Cafe fit the bill with positive reviews overall, but not enough reviews to make us worry about waiting too long.\n\nWe put our names down third on the waiting list, but having a group of 3 hurt us a bit, since there are tables aplenty for groups of 2. And for warm-blooded or bundled diners who could withstand the cold and fog that morning. When we were seated 10 minutes later, we squeezed into a corner table that was just right for 3 small girls, like us.\n\nIf you're looking for an EXTENSIVE breakfast menu, don't come here. The only egg options here (as mentioned in other reviews) are scrambled (with various topping choices) and in a bagel sandwich. Pancakes (regular, pecan, or banana walnut) and their cinnamon croissant french toast are also breakfast options, but there's not much more. I SO appreciate pared down menus... It facilitates expedient decision making by customers and allows the kitchen to only offer options that are well-prepared. I thoroughly enjoyed the cinnamon croissant french toast: not too eggy, not a cinnamon bomb, not too soggy, just well-executed and good. Mind blowingly awesome? No. But a wonderful Saturday morning breakfast treat. I nibbled at E's avocado scrambled eggs and was impressed by the light, fluffy, well-seasoned but not too salty product. Yum! The banana walnut pancakes (2) were quite large. We couldn't finish all of our food. Prices were great for an SF weekend breakfast (~$11/person). And their coffee wasn't a hipster artisan brew, but it was still quite tasty. :)\n\nThanks for the help in finding this place, Yelpers! I wouldn't waste my time waiting more than 30 minutes here... but that's because I'm lazy and stingy and would rather make breakfast at home for that kind of time and energy. If I lived in this neighborhood, this would totally be my go-to, since the line was short before 10 AM. When the sun came out around 10:30, the outside tables looked superb!", "author": "Hannah C."}

Me and my boo sat outside and it was perfect timing since the sun was out and kept us warm. But be warned it is San Francisco and had the sun not been out I would have much rather sat inside to avoid the cold foggy SF weather. I love how you can have your coffee constantly refilled. The servers did a really good job at that which led to long conversations and great place to catch up with a cup of joe. We ordered the avocado jarlsberg cheese omelette and french toast (made with croissant) with fresh strawberries and a chicken apple sausage. All in all we both enjoyed our food and was not overly full. But it was good. Quite honestly this is just one of too many different brunch places in SF.

I was bummed that I couldn't finish the entire thing and I was leaving SF, so I couldn't take it with me. I also ordered a mocha which was around $4 and pretty good.

What a waste of a croissant & calories! :-( Also, the strawberries were very sour.\n\n2) Eggs with potatoes - all we could taste were the potatoes! \n\nOverall no balance of flavors/ ingredients. \n\nAlso, the place is so small that an employee decided to take a huge trash bag out through the front door. \n\nSorry :-(", "author": "Ami D."}

It all looked soooo delicious, and the atmosphere was very nice and cozy. I got the garden scramble which was the special of the day, with the potatoes and the white rosemary toast. I also got a side of chicken apple sausage. My scramble was AWESOME... but the toast.. the toast was amazing! oooh and the potatoes had those little burnt pieces I love so much. The man meat's got a scramble, though I don't remember what. He also got a short stack of the banana walnut pancakes which were SO FRIGGEN GOOD.\nI can't wait to come here again!

(Honey, don't you love yourself enough to put on a little make-up?). The menu has a lot to offer, but nothing sounds appealing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-01-15", "description": "I've been here twice, and both times have had a sincerely crappy experience.  The most recent time was just two days ago, so I feel up-to-date enough to post a review on this biz...\n\nChloe's Cafe always has a line out the door for a table, and so I think people assume it simply MUST be a good place to eat brunch...but I heartily disagree!!  The dining space is tiny with very few cramped tables available...that's why there's always a line!\n\nThe menu states that you cannot make substitutions for a variety of dishes...that's a crappy policy considering there are a TON of people out there with culinary allergies who will be punished by this by either being unable to order a dish or get their money's worth!  Besides, this is a basic brunch restaurant, not a 4-star Zagat-rated restaurant with a celebrity chef where dishes are prepared with a great degree of skill...they're slapping pancakes and eggs on plates, for pete's sake!!! It's not rocket science!!  The \"no substitutions\" policy usually tells me that a business is generally inflexible and that I probably won't enjoy my experience...and that was definitely the case here!\n\nDespite the declarations of \"no substitutions\" on the menu, I asked anyway, because da*nit, I have food allergies...this isn't just about wanting to be difficult!  The waiter was snippy and rude to me when I asked him to substitute \"a little bit of avocado\" for the mixed fruit that was supposed to accompany my breakfast.  I explained that I'm allergic to the fruit he listed off (I have a TON of allergies, if you can't tell by my other reviews!)...and his offer to sub breakfast potatoes wouldn't work for me either, due to my garlic allergy.  Note that I didn't ask for an entire avocado, just a few slices...you can't tell me that that's sooooo much more expensive than the heaping serving of fruit that accompanied my friend's breakfast.  \n\nThe waiter's response was, \"Well, it seems like it's easier to just let you have it than say no...\"  Wow.  Obviously he didn't want a big tip.  My friend was ready to jump out of her seat and beat him down, she was so angry!!  I think because going to Chloe's was her choice and I hadn't loved it the last time I'd been, I was less invested in liking the experience this time around either and therefore wasn't surprised by this acidic response!\n\nI also ordered a side of bacon, because I like meat with my pancakes and eggs (which this limiting menu doesn't offer!).  For $2.75/side order, I got two tiny strips over burnt, uber-thin-and-crispy bacon.  Ugh.  Sooo not worth it!\n\nMy glass of milk cost $2.50 (according to the bill)!!!  Really?   $2.50 for milk???  That's almost as much as an espresso beverage at Starbucks!!!!  \n\nAll said and done, my breakfast was seriously mediocre, no better than many of the other restaurants I frequent in the city, and cost me a lousy $15 before tip.  For that price, I'd rather go to the Beach Chalet or Kate's Kitchen or Savor, or any of the thousands of less expensive brunch places in San Francisco!!!\n\nFor the rest of our breakfast, our waiter ignored us, other than to occassionally glare at us for still being at his table (I could see his expressions in the mirror along the back wall).  Another woman came by and filled up our water at one point, and she was polite and pleasant, so obviously our waiter was just a bad apple.\n\nWHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBILITY:  Theoretically, you can get in the front door, but navigating through the seriously cramped space will prove frustrating, unless you dine outside.  And I'm not sure if they even have a bathroom to offer customers, nevermind an accessible one!  So, call ahead to find out.  \n\nRegardless, given the stress of going to this place (waiting forever for a table, being scrunched into a corner, being bitched at by the waiter, getting mediocre quality food), I'll be skipping it in the future.  I don't care HOW much my friend likes this place, next time she invites me for breakfast, we're going somewhere else!!\n\nThat goes for the rest of my friends, too...if you insist on brunching with me in Noe Valley, let's go to Savor instead!!  The food is far superior to Chloe's, wait staff there is ALWAYS polite and no one ever gives me a hard time for making a menu substitution, regardless of my reasons!!  But I'm not going to Chloe's again....life's too short and my time's too valuable to waste it at mediocre places like this!!!!", "author": "Amy L."}

Simply put, I don't see the point of paying $35 for a breakfast (for 2 people) that I could do just as good a job of making at my house. That sounds kind of snotty, but it's true.\n\nAs a general rule, your toast should not be the best part of your meal. Granted, the white rosemary is pretty fantastic but it is telling that the bread was the stand-out portion of the plate. I can't decide whether the bacon was flat-out bad or just not my cup of pork belly; either way, I lose. It's rare that you wish something was more greasy, but bacon (Chloe's serves the thin & crispy variety) should not be as dry as a saltine. In contrast to that was the gross scrambled egg water that ran from my eggs all over the potatoes, leaving them wet with cold egg juice. Amateur hour.\n\nAlso, I hate to be the guy who goes \"I've had so-and-so at Other Place X, and it was so much better than it is here\" because doing that is lame, but I've had the croissant french toast at Toast Eatery, and it's better there than it is here.

Easily one of the best brunches I've had in the city!\n\nFirst off, the portions and ingredients were great for the price. To maximize our first visit, my fellow food adventurer and I ordered and split two dishes--the avocado and jarlsberg scramble, and a stack of three pecan pancakes. We also ordered a side of bacon because what would brunch (or any meal) be without bacon. The scramble comes with an option for home fries--get them. The home fries are well-seasoned and have just the right amount of crispiness. It also comes with a side of toast and jam. We got the white rosemary toast, which pairs surprisingly well with their raspberry jam. The scramble itself was delicious and filling--mainly because they are generous with the avocado and jarlsberg cheese. I'm usually the first one to add ketchup, hot sauce, or salt to a dish, but besides a little pepper on the eggs, this dish had all the flavor it needed. The pancakes were fluffy, light and delicious. The pecans added an extra level of taste, but didn't overpower the pancakes overall. \n\nAs far as portions go, we were full--but not stuffed--at the end of the meal. I'm usually not one to leave anything on the plate, so this was the perfect amount.\n\nThe area is lovely--it's pretty close to downtown Noe Valley, but far enough that you can park if you're driving. Staff was courteous, attentive, and quick. Be ready for a wait (still reasonable, though) if you have a large party, because the place is small and popular. \n\nAll together a great eat and experience.

But these have layers of textures and steamy flavorful goodness dances in your mouth with every bite.  \n\nSo let's get personal.  It's all about the croissant french toast for me.  If there were only one brunch food left in the world, I wouldn't cry if I was left with this one.  S-U-B-L-I-M-E.  \n\nPer other Yelpers comments, the sausages rock, if you're like that sort of thing.  Yeah, I do, especially when they're this light, flavorful and fresh.  Yea sausage!  \n\nThe fresh fruit is simple and spot on.  All that and good coffee and real juice will get you four stars, at least.  Then there's the omnipresent X-factor.  The service here is as nice as humanly possible.  I mean it!  I know, my sorry nocturnal ass used to work the breakfast shift.  I know the drill of having 'em all lined up, waiting with baited breath and having to deliver the real deal, order after order.  Yeah, you become a breakfast machine, at which point it's pretty difficult to remember to be kind.  But you wouldn't believe it at Chloe's.  They may suffer the rare dropped fork or plate, but I have never once seen them slip on service.  That's 5-star as in quick to take your order, patient with your questions, and always back with more coffee, water or whatever you need.  Not all in your face faux-chatty, but smoothly and politely on-the-case.  I rest my case.", "author": "Ted R."}

Luckily you won't have to stand in a huge line like Mama's or Dottie's because they'll take your name and call you when a space is available. Chloe's is actually a pretty tiny place with just a handful of tables inside and out. Prices are fairly high, expect to pay in the neighborhood of $15 for breakfast, but it's totally worth it. They're cash only but there's an ATM at the corner store across the street if you forgot money. They have a few types of pancakes available (sadly no blueberry option) and guaranteed if it's not the best pancake you've ever had in your life then it will definitely be a contender for the title. On the menu is also fantastic french toast, lots of omelettes, and some creative scrambles like the one I got which included red potatoes, cheddar, and onions. Instead of hash browns they also give you the choice of fresh fruit which was a great touch. Even the toast was hardy and came with the side of delicious preserves that I found myself eating long after the toast was gone. Oddly Chloe's only serves scrambled eggs, something many people might find to be a turn off but I'm a scrambled egg fan and the ones they serve here were fantastic. If they could offer blueberry pancakes, eggs of all types, and take credit cards I'd definitely give them 5 stars.", "author": "Matt E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-04", "description": "Chloe's is hands-down the best breakfast/brunch joint in Noe Valley, and it could be reasonably argued that it's among the two or three best in the city.\n\nChloe's menu offers creative twists on most of the standards.  But unlike some restaurants that pursue creativity at all costs, often failing miserably (I'm talking to you Incanto!), Chloe's combines a healthy portion of good taste & common sense when they create an unusual combination.  \n\nI've dined at Chloe's at least once a month for more than five years, and I can honestly say I've never tried a dish that I wouldn't order again (are you paying attention Incanto?).  Some of their regular offerings that I'd recommend include:\n\nCroissant French Toast (w/ strawberries)\nScrambled Eggs w/ Tomato, Bacon & Cheese\nChloe's BLT Sandwich w/ Avocado\nChloe's Tuna Sandwich (which is an example of a truly ordinary sandwich that Chloe's elevates to a whole new level by cleverly changing a few ingredients).\n\nI could go on, but earlier reviewers have written extensively on other menu items.\n\nChloe's is not entirely immune to criticism.  For example, when busy, the wait can be quite long.  And if you're seated inside on a crowded morning, the noise and clatter in this small space tend to set my nerves on edge.  But these criticisms apply equally to all the other good brunch destinations in the city, so I don't think it fair to deduct a star for this (show me a place with equal or better brunch and less noise, and I'll rethink my reasoning).  \n\nNote finally that parking can be difficult during peak brunch hours.  For those who live in Noe Valley, this can be avoided by walking to Chloe's.  I still recommend Chloe's to folks who live outside of Noe Valley.  But if you drive, you should be aware of the limited parking, and be prepared to park a block (or a few) away.  The meal will be worth the effort, and you'll experience less stress and annoyance if you build a little extra time into your plans to find parking. (But to be clear, this is not an invitation to park in front of my garage).  \n\nEnjoy!", "author": "S. K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-28", "description": "Finally made it over to Chloe's in Noe Valley, an establishment I had been told was \"the best breakfast\" in Noe Valley.\n\nThankfully Andrei Z and I arrived early and with just a party of two, we were sat immediately.  This place is pretty small and so if you plan to go on a weekend, come early or be prepared to wait.\n\nWe sat down at a little table in the back and I was able to peruse the scene.  Tables of 2-4 people, mostly families but some couples.  Noe Valley definitely has that suburban feel to it and you'd almost think you were in another town if it weren't for the J-Church going by outside.  The decor is country home-ish, and makes you feel warm and cozy.  I smiled when I saw that every person had a different coffee cup, like we were at someone's house rather than a restaurant.  I've seen this in other restaurants (Eddie's Cafe on Divis) and I always imagine the owners going from garage sale to garage sale to get enough random coffee cups for their patrons.\n\nThe menu has a decent selection of basic breakfast items with some more specialty items (like croissant french toast!) as well as lunch items.  I ordered the special omelet of the day while Andrei Z ordered said croissant french toast.  One thing that bothered me slightly was that they wouldn't substitute egg whites for the egg dishes.  I can understand charging more (after all, you have to use more eggs to make up for taking the yolks out) but to just say we wont do it didn't make sense to me.  I was irked.  The server was very nice about it, but after she walked away I leaned over to Andrei and said, \"one star off\".\n\nAccording Andrei, the coffee was \"pretty good\" which is saying a lot for a little diner/cafe.  I did notice they made lattes and such so maybe they do put a bit more effort into their coffee.  I ordered a diet coke which came in a can (another thing that bothers me but I understand that not everyone can afford/wants a soda fountain) and we waited for our breakfast.  I was noticing that this almost seems like a family establishment - run by all women.  I didn't see one man working there (unless they were hidden in the bowels of the tiny kitchen) and I was impressed.  When I went to use the restroom which was back behind the kitchen, I noticed a grandma aged woman cracking eggs next to a large bin of egg shells.  I thought that was very cool.\n\nOur food came out fairly quick and it was all very good.  Andrei's croissant french toast really was delicious, served with strawberries and powdered sugar on top.  It didn't even really need the syrup or butter (although it did taste good with that).  My omlet was delicious as were the home fries that came with it.\n\nWe left satisfied, glad to have tried another breakfast/brunch spot in our fair city.  Although it was good, there was no desire to come back soon.  If I had half stars this place would've received 3.5 stars from me.  Still on the quest for the best breakfast in SF but for Noe Valley, this place is very good and I would recommend checking it out.", "author": "Melanie N."}

Very good.  It came with potatoes and they were some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had!  The pancakes were amazing as well, topped with bananas and strawberries.  I got half a sandwich with a salad and their homemade vinaigrette which was great.  After eating my salad and munching on Ricky's plate, I barely touched my sandwich, but the bites I did have were good!  Top that off with Martinelli's sparkling apple juice...one of my favorite little pleasures.  Yum!  \n\nThe restaurant was quaint, the servers were friendly, and the prices were ok.

My sister ordered the egg scramble which was also quite tasty and the whole wheat walnut bread!\n\nThe food was great- came out really fast and super fresh.

Maybe this would be okay in Texas, but in SF?? Get with it. Also, I almost gagged when I went to the bathroom, which is tinier than one on a plane and ghetto-er than one in some gas station. I felt like I barged into someone's run-down shack in a 3rd world country or something. Plus it was really awkward having to wash my hands in the tiny kitchen sink where some old lady was hand-picking lettuce. She glared at me as if I were invading her territory or something.\n\nPerhaps people here just like it b/c it comes across as a cute brunchy place that people in Noe Valley can walk to on weekends, but the food just doesn't do it for me.

My husband ordered an omelet that had onion, red potatoes, and something else in it.  He added mushrooms to his.  He chose the walnut bread and the fruit salad instead.\nDelicious!  The food came out steaming hot.  My husband commented how he liked the fact that the food wasn't greasy.  The bread seems like it's homemade and  was nice and thick.  The eggs were light and fluffy.

I'm always on the lookout for new  breakfast/brunch spots.  When I saw Chloe's Cafe had 4 stars with 300+ reviews on yelp, I expected to be blown away.  I wish that were the case.  :(\n\nDue to some extreme partying the night before, we ended up eating a VERY late brunch at 3pm on a Sunday.  Chloe's closes at 3:30pm.  The restaurant was empty, aside from a couple seated in one of the two tables outside.   We asked the waitress (or owner?) if it was too late for us to eat and even though she said okay, she didn't seem too excited to have our business.   We walked more than a few blocks just to try this place out for my bf's birthday, so we weren't going to leave just based on her behavior (and duh, we were starving).   My bf asked if we could have a seat at the table outside and the lady said, \"I gueeeessss, if you want to, but it's really cold.\"  She looked at us as if we were from another planet.  It wasn't even cold!  I was mystified by her behavior.   While my bf grabbed the table, I went to the liquor store next door to get cash.  Chloe's is cash only.\n\nI had an egg scramble with cheddar and potatoes.  The breakfast came with a large portion of potatoes and walnut bread.  My egg scramble was below average, it was too cheesy and had too many potatoes.  The breakfast already comes with potatoes, so it was like potato overload.  The only highlight was the walnut bread.  My bf had some banana walnut pancakes and enjoyed his breakfast.  \n\nThe service was miserably slow and I had to keep looking over and signaling the waitress to get her attention.  She was just chatting away with another waitress as if we didn't exist.  She didn't even come out once during our meal to check to see if things were okay.  \n\nThe portions are big and the prices are reasonable at Chloe's Cafe.  Unfortunately, that isn't enough to make me want to go back.  I really wanted to like this place, but after that kind of treatment, Chloe's left a bad taste in my mouth.", "author": "Vivian W."}

We completely prefer your kitchen counter! \n\nSo, all you Yelpers, please don't come here for breakfast/brunch. Please leave me and my rent-a-friends to eat our \"less than mediocre\" breakfast.\n\nYou absolutely do not want to enjoy the breakfast dishes listed below. Trust me.\n\nBanana walnut pancakes ($8.95) - Not icky sweet. Deliciously fluffy and perfected with just the right amount of nuts and bananas. I usually share this dish and one pancake puts me in banana NUT heaven.\n\nBacon and Tomato Scramble ($7.75) - The wheat toast that comes with this dish isn't the pre-sliced kind. I absolutely love the texture of the wheat bread covered with their delicious jam. Deelish!! As for the scramble, the balance of the ingredients is perfecto!\n\nGrilled Rice and Tomato on Croissant ($6.95) - Creatively awesome!!\n\nCoffee - Meh. But, drinkable.\n\nI can see how waiting outside for 35-45 minutes can really make your breakfast affair a one time fling. You keep saying to yourself or friends. \"Damn, this better be worth it.\" I experience that at Mama's. So, what I suggest is just don't come here or Mama's. Simple. ;-P\n\nOverall: The service was consistent. My OK coffee was continuously topped off as well as my cool glass of water. The food was great for my taste buds.

I dont know if she was having a bad day but I dont think I deserved the attitute.\nThe other server wasn't much better-she also seemed to be having a really bad day but c'mon people if you work in the service industry get it together.\nThe worst part of our experience, however, came when I found a thick black curly hair in my albacore tuna salad; it looked like a pubic hair and I was so disgusted that needless to say I couldn't finish my meal.\nI didn't even bother saying anything to the waitress in large part because no one came by to check on us during our meal and by the time they finally cleared our plates my mother in law was long finished.

We had to wait awhile, which we'd expected, so no problem there. But the wait wasn't over when we got seated. It took forever for someone to come and take our order. Finally, we got our orders in--three of us had items from the specials menu, and one person had a regular item. No special orders or extra additions. The food came promptly enough, but it was the wrong orders--the server had somehow misunderstood us. That would have been fine--just send it back and adjust. But the server felt the need to come over and tell us that it was our fault: \"well, when I asked you what kind of toast you wanted, it's because that's what comes with the combo.\" As if we were supposed to know the menu well enough to know that toast comes with the combo, but not with the pancakes? I don't know why she was so defensive about it, since it really wasn't a big deal. But she was completely exasperated, rolled her eyes at us, and then marched off. She didn't make another appearance until the end, and other servers filled in for her. When she gave us the bill, she did apologize, in exactly the way she might have done in the first place: \"Sorry about that; I'm not sure how that happened.\" But at that point she really did have something to apologize for, whereas with messing up an order, it's so not a big deal that an apology is really just a formality.

Stroll back to Chloe's.  Wait 10 minutes for your table.\n\nOrder the scrambles (stellar) or French toast (solar).  The juice and coffee are terrif.  Or clutch.

The wait for a Saturday didn't seem bad, I came around 12:45 and waited about 15 minutes for a group of 4. I ordered one of their specials; the BLT sandwich with avacado and a side order of home fried potatoes. It very filling and cost $9.89.

If not, it goes all over the place.  Unfortuntely..\n\nProblem, last summer... they did it (the 30 second salad toss) every time I went, but the final time I went they said it's against their policy.  When I politely reminded them that I'd had it that way many times, this younger server who I'd never had before said \"look, we're slammed.\"  I said fine, I'll have something else (this time).  I didn't decide in 2.5 minutes when she came back out and she got in my face, then sent someone else out, who was nice (-er) , but did not concede.  Everything else took forever from there on out, and now, though I'd been there many times, I decided that time would be my last.  I don't go to restaurants to get punished and feel awkward.  Plain and simple.  I'm a man of manners and patience, but I don't easily forgive evil bitches who claim to be \"servers' but do not serve anything but attitude.

It's a perfect little breakfast place with the main focus on honest good American breakfast. Having travelled and lived in many countries, I can only think of Taiwan as having as good a breakfast culture and quality as the U.S. \n\nNow, I really want to comment on Natalie W.'s review of Chloe's. Thanks for the internet, we get to hear diversity of a place like San Francisco. Almost all reviewers here love Chloe's but you get the odd few like Natalie's. It really shows that even in sophisticated, worldly San Francisco where citizens have probably the most advanced tastebuds in the country, there are still unsophisticated, ignorant people like Natalie that live this is great city. \n\nOmelettes are suppose to be runny. Go to any restaurant/cafe in Paris and that's how it's done. \n\nNo egg substitutes is not only the standard in almost every country in the world, but in gastronomic destinations like France and Italy, you would be thrown out of the restaurant for asking for egg substitutes. Eggs are good natural and chefs/cooks appreciate and respect that. I'm glad a place in San Francisco (like many) are the same. \n\nWhat's funny is that Natalie lives in the Marina district.

Why Chloe's always had a line out front and Joe's always had open stools at the counter was a question that perplexed me for years...till I took a ladyfriend here for Valentines day a year ago.  All of a sudden, the light turned on as to why people queue up 30 minutes deep to get a table here.....\r\n\r\nWomen just love the place.  They like the decor, they like the atmosphere, they like the attentive service mixed with a close, intimate, homey feel, and they like the artsy little touches that Chloe's adds to spruce up traditional Yankee breakfast fare.  Hungry Joe's gives a better bang-for-your-buck, but the choice of Chloe's is a no brainer if you're up for breakfast, not in a hurry, and a female sidekick is along for the ride.\r\n\r\nI forgot what I she ordered...come to think of it, I forget what I ordered too. Valentines day fell during the week that year, and we went during off-peak hours so there wasn't a line.  My breakfast wasn't anything to complain about...but whatever touches they added to deviate it from the norm were things I saw as tolerable irritations rather than  meal-enhancing nuances. My feminine companion dug into her plate with an ear-to-ear grin, singing it's praises from start to finish.  I don't know how, but breakfast at Chloe's seemed to set the tone for a good day, kicking off a chain of events that kept us busy till nightfall.\r\n\r\nPeople complain about the wait, but from what I've seen during my passings-by of Chloe's, the wait is an integral part of the dining experience on a nice day.  Numerous couples waiting for tables lounge idly on the sidewalk at 28th and Church, creating an interesting social scene that's highly interactive and extremely couples-centric.  The food is the same whether it's sunny or raining...but trust me...the length of the wait isn't.\r\n\r\nIf I'm hanging out with the fairer of our species, be she relative, friend, client, or romantic prospect, there's a good chance you might see me waiting with the other poor saps in front of Chloe's on a sunny spring morning.  In this situation, Chloe's is pretty dang hard to beat.  On the other hand, you  you'll NEVER see me here by myself.  In that instance, a gritty atmosphere, larger portions, and zero wait time await me at Herb's Fine Foods several blocks away.", "author": "Mike W."}

Because I can only go on weekends (it's only open for breakfast and lunch, and I work a 9-5 across town) and by the time I roll my butt out of bed on a Saturday and get to Chloe's the wait is already 2 hours long. Don't get me wrong - I get why there's such a wait, this place does amazing breakfast and pretty good lunch food too - but when you're hungry/hungover on a Saturday no one wants to wait that long. There's only maybe 7 tables inside this tiny cafe and 3 tables outside and most likely if they ever expanded, the quality of the food would go way down. Amazing breads - croissants, rosemary toast, etc. fresh fruit, good home fries - and I'm picky about my home fries.

As a former SF resident it was our go to place on the weekends. Now that I live out of state I always find time to squeeze in a visit to Chloes when I am in town. The place is packed on the weekends so you might have to wait, for a table, but the staff will get you a coffee and you can hang out on the sidewalk with the other folks whose mouths are watering for Chloes' delicious Banana Walnut Pancakes, to die for Croissant FrenchToast, or an unbelievable salad with homemade dressing!  The food and the service are worth the wait. Being that it is in now uber trendy Noe Valley you might be subjected to mingling with uptight yuppies like the reviewer below who couldn't cope with only having one menu for her party of two. Whatever! I am assuming the reviewer is a female since she made a catty remark about the size of the waitress. How is that relevant to the review? And who doesn't complain when they find a pubic hair in their food?! Anyway, sounds like BS to me. Especially the negative comments about the staff who are actually professional, fast and friendly. In my experience if one treats wait staff like crap one does not usually get a warm fuzzy in return. With that said, I have never had a negative experience at Chloes and, in fact, if there was ever anything the least bit not to my liking the staff took care of it immediately and courteously. This is a tiny, super busy neighborhood establishment where one goes for delicious, fresh food and fast service. If one wants to be treated like a spoiled princess then one should stick to the Marina.", "author": "Janet G."}

Surprisingly they only have  scrambled eggs with fixins, no sunny side up or over easy. That surprised me, but I suppose it makes for a easier menu. My boyfriend had pancakes. Our friend had the cinnamon french toast, that was really good. In my opinion everything tasted good, due to the fresh fruit. Now what wouldn't go well with fresh fruit? I had a glass of mimosa and I thought that just topped our brunch off. You can bring your dogs here to have brunch with you here if you do plan on eating outside. The neighborhood is great for people watching and parking wasn't too bad.I would definitely come here again for brunch again or maybe lunch and try a sandwich or salad with some girlfriends.", "author": "carebear l."}

A couple of weeks ago, I debated going here or to Toast; at that time, Toast won out, and I was supremely disappointed with the food I ate there. So THIS time, as I made my way back to this neighborhood, I headed straight to Chloe's and found the experience to be 10 times better. My husband and I split a combo plate of eggs and two pancakes (thanks to the waitress, we received a special order of banana pecan instead of banana walnut pancakes). We also ordered a side of grilled ham. Everything was fresh, served quickly (and piping hot!) and the service was friendly to boot.

The place is small and the lines can get long, but it's definitely worth the wait.", "author": "Ivette F."}

The service is quick, the prices are reasonable, and the food tastes more fresh than any of the smug smiles on the legions of stroller/dog-walkers trawling around the Valley of Noe.

Even though that sort of breakfast may seem like a commodity to most people, Chloe's managed to impress me with its quality.  Maybe just a couple minutes after ordering (seriously, the service is so fast), I was presented with perfectly done scrambled eggs (not too runny, not too dry), a delicious slab of wheat toast, some delicious jam, and high quality butter to top it all off.  I chose the fruit salad as my side, and was glad I did.  The fruit was fresh and delicious.\n\nAs far as ambiance goes, I agree with most, it feels quaint inside.  There were a couple small tables out on the sidewalk, but those were full when I arrived.  After sitting down and scoping it out, I felt as if I'd discovered some under-appreciated gem of a place in my new neighborhood.

Nearly everywhere, whether a greasy spoon or a fancy hotel, it's eggs fried, poached (benedict), omeleted or scrambled, accompanied by some fried meat, and some starch toasted (white, wheat, bagel,or biscuit if you're lucky) Chloe's has very creative specials (yes, Steve F, mostly scrambled. It's hard to be creative with 2 eggs over easy.) I agree with Laurel and Debbie. Worth the wait. I work evenings so I made it a project to find the best breakfast dining experience. I still have a few places to check out, but Chloe's is champion so far (for 4 years now). And the chedder and red potato scramble is my favorite. And the fruit is ALWAYS perfectly ripe.

The service was fantastic and the breakfast was great. This cafe has a very traditional feel to it both with the decor and the menu. The menu may be my only complaint, it needs to be updated just so it can stand out more from the other breakfast eateries. Maybe a signature dish perhaps? We both had scrambles and left happy. The scrambles come with your choice of toasts, home fries, and or fruit cup. I hate to spoil surprises but the toast came with a cup of black raspberry jelly that would tempt me to return.

Located in what I want to say \"disgustingly cute\" (without offending anyone, since I absolutely adore the area) Noe Valley, this small and homey breakfast spot was my destination of choice on a cold and foggy Sunday. While the cafe has outdoor seating options, given the dubious weather, we opted to sit inside and were immediately attended to by a friendly waitress (9 am mind you, with no wait). I ordered the soy latte, served piping hot in a tall glass with extra foam and topped with ground cinnamon. While it was hard to decide between the mouthwateringly delicious sounding menu options, I ended up going for the cinnamon croissant french toast served with a plethora of strawberries. The french toast was thinly sliced croissant dough, dipped lightly in batter and grilled. The end product was fluffy and mildly sweet, not as fried and rich as the french toast served at Dottie's but equally as good. In fact, I might even prefer this french toast as it did not leave me feeling overly stuffed and bloated, like my meal at the aforementioned breakfast joint.  The reason I am docking a star here, is due to the fact that we were asked to leave before we were done talking. I suppose they are busy, and when finished, want to turn the table over to a new customer, however I felt this was a bit rude, and detracted from my overall experience at this quaint cafe.", "author": "Kate A."}

Twice!!  The food was ok.  I liked the Chloe's salad, but the sandwich and soup I had the second time were nothing remarkable.  The crazy thing about this place is the long wait!  Even on a weekday, we waited about 30 minutes the first time, 15 the second to be seated, and the food is just not good enough that I would consider waiting an hour or more on a weekend.", "author": "Jessica T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-12-07", "description": "The breakfast food is fantastic, especially the pancakes, which are as pancakes should be: lightly browned on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Besides the food, the setting makes for a very nice breakfast or brunch experience overall, and that's what gets Chloe's an extra half-star from me. And the wait isn't bad if you just want a table for two.", "author": "A. T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-07-02", "description": "I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. I used to go by every weekend and see people crowded outside waiting for a table at Chloe's, and I thought it must be the best brunch place since the invention of brunch. When I finally went there myself, on a weekday morning (working from home = no wait for brunch!), I found it just OK. The food was fine, no complaints, but it was about what you'd get at an above-average diner. Definitely not worth the wait on a weekend.", "author": "Hilary R."}

It's pleasant enough, the staff is reasonably friendly and the food is edible, but it didn't bowl me over.

Although to avoid lines I go there early (8am) when I can always get seated and the coffee is fresh.  I like the simplicity of the menu (always scrambled, no special orders) because the food comes out quickly and piping hot.  Bread is from Il Fornaio so you can't go wrong.  And I have always found the service to be friendly, attentive and professional.  Kid and dog friendly just like the neighborhood.  This place has long standing loyalty among its regulars like me!", "author": "L A."}

No place with long brunch lines in SF is special enough to justify the long lines.  It's just some strange SF habit we have.  I don't go unless I motivated early (pre-10:00) or happen to be around on a weekday.\nThat said, the reason why Chloe's is better than your average long-line spot is because they cook their eggs properly. For some people, like me, this is a huge plus. Others care way less about how their eggs are cooked, and this will make Chloe's seem less special to you.  Chloe's serves perfectly scrambled eggs.  Glossy and moist, not dry, overcooked or (yikes) browned.  \nI highly recommend getting cream cheese in your eggs. It's heaven. I highly recommend the wheat toast.  It goes well with their jam. Their fruit cup is fresh fruit.  The banana walnut pancakes are spectacular, and this is coming from an egg girl.  It's basically mounds of melted banana and walnut chunks bound together with the pancake batter, so you don't walk away feeling like you ate a box of Bisquick.  (They are huge, though, so I'd suggest a short stack.)  Coffee is eh, just get it because it goes well with your breakfast.", "author": "C G."}

I don't understand why people wait so long to eat such less than mediocre breakfast. So first of all I ask to not have cheese on my scramble and they say NO! They don't allow for ANY substitutions. Well thats not a substitution - thats taking something out - ummm why because I have high cholesterol. So what does one do who has these kind of health problems...ummm my solution is to go to another breakfast spot. I tried the scrambler anyhow and all I kept asking my husband was..\"Is this egg beaters - are they serious?\" I gave up in the end, we tried it, decided to never come back but let me stop by the restroom on my way out. OMG - you have to walk through the kitchen to this little bathroom which is basically ONLY a toilet and very very dirty. After seeing that I kept thinking is that bathroom even legal???? What about if someone handicapped needs to use the restroom - my answer again - leave and find another breakfast spot. The wait is totally not worth it and the food is disgusting and the service needs some serious work!!!! Just think of this and then decide to go: NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO TAKING ANYTHING OUT NO MATTER WHAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T OR SHOULDN'T HAVE, NO EGG WHITES, NO EGG DISHES OTHER THAN SCRAMBLERS, CASH ONLY...\n\nHow many restrictions can you possibly put on a customer - I mean,  remember I am paying you!", "author": "SF Gal .."}

I went religiously with my honey and ordered the same thing every time-the potato cheddar onion scramble.  It WAS amazing.  They have a new chef who doesn't cook the same.  The onions were not caramalized as before, the potaoes weren't as cooked.  Basically, it changed the whole flavor of the dish.  Do caramalized onions make a difference?  Really, they do.  I hope the chef reads this, because I don't ever want to go back again after tasting his version.  just cook them longer please!", "author": "End W."}

The food is superb and you'll never go wrong ordering anything with jarlsberg cheese on it.
