Luis was extremely friendly, attentive and eager to provide high quality customer service.  It is nice to see someone who seems happy to be at work!  Lina made our lattes and we watched as she carefully and diligently craft not only delicious but artistic beverages!  She appeared to put great care into ensuring that we were happy with our order and we appreciated the service with a smile.  The facilities were very clean and the atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing. \n\nMy party of six took a table in the sunny, clean patio and were able to order food from Pork Store Cafe next door; the food was wonderful too.  Everything we ordered tasted very fresh and flavorful, and I saw many menu items that I would like to come back and try at another time!  Prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get (and I have a large appetite).  The owner came to greet us and check on us several times, which was nice.  All in all, this was a great first time experience here and everyone in my party is planning on another visit soon! Thank you for a lovely Saturday morning brunch with great food, beverages, customer service and atmosphere!", "author": "Corinna L."}

There is relaxing music played in the background (albeit a bit loud and you can clearly hear it even with earphones on unless you have the noise cancelling headphones). The lighting is slightly dim and conveys an intimate setting.  There are outlets on the wall and many people come here to work on their laptops. \n\nThe interior design of this place is also phenomenal. Very detailed and meticulous, ornate designs placed on the walls. Love it!\n\nI ordered the thai iced tea, which was alright. It wasn't very sweet or milky, two things I would have preferred. My boyfriend ordered the cold brew and said it wasn't acidic at all. He thought the drink was particularly good here.\n\n (Sidenote: the bathroom here is really modern, cool, and clean)", "author": "Karen Y."}

You need to ask and then they print off a qr code for you. \n* great ambience.  Nice setup with seating outside and inside with very chill music playing overhead. \n* WiFi shows up on my WiFi list I didn't need it so didn't bother.  Update: they do have WiFi. \n* Staff very friendly and welcoming\n\nCons: \n* The only con I have is my coffee tastes like it's been sitting for a little bit too long it has that slight burnt taste. I'm not docking any stars b/c they are quite friendly and I bet they would've been happy to swap out my coffee. \n\nOverall, perfect place in my books.  I'll definitely be back.

That Turning Point coffee makes some of the best pourover cups I've ever had.\n\nSo why the low rating? Well... have you ever been to a cafe where you feel like the staff is hassling for you a tip? I don't think I've ever been to a coffee shop where the staff will blatantly demand a tip... That's just not cool, and puts me in an ungenerous and unhappy mood, especially if I haven't even had my first cup of coffee in the morning yet.\n\nMost of the staff are nice and friendly, but just one lady there does this. I go to that cafe occasionally on weekends, but there was a promo on some mobile app where free coffee was being offered for a few days, so I decided to go out of my way to Stanza for my morning coffee. As I put in the order for my coffee through the app, the lady there starts freaking out after she does the checkout process, going, \"There's no place to tip. Why isn't there a place to put tip? Did I not do this right? I hope you give a tip. Why can't this thing tip?\".... Ummm, ok. I gave a cash tip.\n\nNext time I go back, someone (I'm assuming the same person) had put a very blatant piece of paper in front of their register, that says \"Dear [app name] users, we're glad that you're enjoying your FREE (underlined and bolded and capitalized) cup of coffee. But we make a modest living so please don't forget to tip us\". Wow. Really? It's one thing if the shop was giving the cups of coffee for free, but it wasn't.. it was some app company that was paying for the coffee.\n\nLook, I'm not against tipping for coffee, especially if it's for things like a pourover that take some effort to make. I am, however, a believer that a tip should be given for good service. One doesn't go to restaurants and have the servers remind them, \"Please leave me a tip because I served your food and I make a modest living\". If that happened at a restaurant, that wouldn't fly.. so why should the case be different at a coffee shop? I still left a tip, but I felt such a bad vibe coming from this shop that it makes me not want to go back.", "author": "Kazu O."}

After reading reviews of lots of other places, it didn't seem like I'd ever find a place WITHOUT pretentious baristas, tiny tables, and horribly overpriced drinks...until Yelp led me to Stanza. Yay! Bonus points that it was very easily accessible by BART (16th & Mission) and only a few blocks from the station, so I didn't have to lug around my bags too far.\n\nTwo of my must-haves for a coffee shop to make it on my \"traveling office\" list is that there's reliable wifi and plenty of outlets available: Stanza's got both. I also enjoyed that the tables are a decent size per person -- sometimes tables for 1 or 2 people are miniature, with barely enough room to fit one laptop, let alone two. These were decent sized tables with enough room to spread out a laptop and all of my other stuff. \n\nThe barista was friendly, greeted me as soon as I came up to the counter, and had my cappuccino ready fairly quickly. 5 stars for the cappuccino alone; it's one of my top 3 that I've ever had. One of the staff even came around with free cookies before I left. Woohoo!\n\nI was there on a weekday morning/early afternoon so it wasn't too crowded.

At Stanza, (with one female barista as an exception who's name I sadly don't know) I'm lucky to receive a responding grunt when I walk up, say \"how are you\" & wait for some sort of acknowledgement before requesting my latte.

The Mission location one is, relatively speaking, much nicer, if only because it's roomier, and has much more, and usable, seating. And by usable, I mean conventional tables, rather than the visually appealing, but hard-to-use barrel top tables at the other location.\n\nIn any case, coming here for a user experience interview with a local startup, I was treated to one of Stanza's sea salt caramel doughnuts. And, well... DAMN that was one tasty doughnut. Basically, take a large jelly doughnut, and replace the jelly with a nicely balanced caramel sauce. Not too overwhelming, as sea salt usually is, with the salt offering a nice balance for an otherwise normally too-sweet pastry.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - While this location IS larger than the Haight location, it's still more of a mid-size cafe than a large one.

Since I've turned into a seriously early riser, I've taken it upon myself to explore SF's coffee shops that are open early and getting in my coffee fix before the world wakes up.  Stanza is right off the 16th Street BART station, which made this horribly convenient for me coming from the Embarcadero.  In walking in at around 7:30AM, there was myself and one other person, and I was warmly greeted by one of the most friendliest human beings behind the counter.  I was set on having a pour over, and after talking with my newfound friend, I went with his favorite: beans from Topeca Coffee from Tulsa, OK. I also threw in a bran muffin for good measure.  For anyone that hates on the fact that this place doesn't roast their own beans, save it. Similar to my experience at Mazarine, I love the idea of bringing in new roasters and exposing people like myself to new blends and varieties from other parts of the country (other parts of the US know how to roast beans too, you know!). After sitting with my warm cup of coffee, my delicious bran muffin (which was absolutely delish that day and the day after), I concluded that Stanza is a place that I'd like to keep for myself.  It was incredibly relaxing just sitting and enjoying some coffee on a fine SF morning and an amazing way to start off my day.

The service is great, the same barista has served me three weeks in a row and he's always extremely friendly. \n\nI've only tried the cappuccino, but I don't think much of the coffee because I like mine piping hot and it's usually lukewarm (I keep forgetting to ask, though). My favorite part of this cafe is the latte art. The barista is literally excited when you order so he can draw something in your drink. \n\nIt's a great place to study or hang with friends, especially on a sunny day. They have a great patio in the back with couches and tables. Maybe if you're lucky like me, you'll get to see someone painting a mural on the back wall!", "author": "Estelle C."}

I really (as in, really, really) enjoyed my iced almond milk latte. My friend's salad looked pretty amazeballs too. \n\nThe inside space itself is quite nice, although it was packed with people by the time we arrived (around 2 or 3 on a Sunday). The wait for drinks was about standard (unless you're used to Blue Bottle waits; then it was lightning fast in comparison). The ambiance inside is dark (even with the sun bright overhead in typical perfect Mission weather), but in a cozy, rather than slasher flick, way, and there were a variety of different seating options, including a little patio out front with a few tables and chairs.\n\nThe problem? No space for three people to comfortably commune and get our writing groove on -- at least not until my friend led me out back.\n\nI'm not sure if the patio is shared by neighboring Pork Store Cafe or if it's entirely Stanza's domain. Either way, the back patio is entirely fenced off and shaded from glaring sunlight, and there were a lot of options for seating, with tables and big cushioned chairs. There were even a few extension cords where we could plug in our laptops, which was a plus. The people around us were quiet and polite.\n\nMy only real complaint was lack of bathroom maintenance. I was there for a total of three hours, but there was no toilet paper the entire time. Maybe that's on me for not reporting it, but if that was the case, no one else did either. You'd think at least one staffer would've noticed it during that time and addressed the issue.\n\nOtherwise, good drinks, nice space.

Living in the mission you get stuck going to your usual spots (Coffee Bar and Phiz) but I was with a friend and did not want to deal with the usual shit show that is Four Barrel and happened to walk by Stanza. \n\nFirst thought was \"didnt this used to be that hookah place?\" and yes, it did. It has a cute patio in front and the inside is dark and great to bring your computer in and get some work done. The service was SO FRIENDLY. I have forgotten what it is like to go into a coffee spot and not be judged. Felt so good. Then to my surprise they have a huge patio outback that has a ton of seating and sunny. \n\nGreat little spot and I will definitely be back.", "author": "Colleen B."}

Plenty of space, airy yet intimate, eclectic and comfortable. Good lighting for doing computer work. \n\nCoffee was lovely. Caramelly, smooth, buoyant, medium body, not too bright, just an all-around great cup to start the day. Kinda pricey at $4.50, but it had just won a prestigious competition and was limited in quantity. Worth it.\n\nMusic was kind of loud, but at least it wasn't bad or obnoxious. The only negative was...please don't bicker about music, baristas. It's unpleasant to listen to and like sooo hipster. Come on. :)\n\nLots of outlets and space to work. Free wi-fi! I think I sat there for three hours. It wasn't busy.\n\nThere is a sunny patio in the back, or a partially enclosed front patio, if you feel so inclined.

Especially when I go to a place for the first time and the staff is generally nice to me, have good service or the product is pleasing to me in appearance or taste.  I also know that I have lots of people who disagree with me about price point and taste.  \n\nYet, honestly, I like the pour over that I ordered here.  I like my coffee subtle with lingering flavors and finishes on my tongue.  I like that the coffee here is NOT scalding hot or overly roasted so that all that you taste is CHARCOAL.  I like that there is not a long line of people angrily tapping their feet or trying to rush your order.  I like it when people behind the bar answer your questions and provide you with information to make you a little more knowledgeable.\n\nOkay, so the demeanor of the individual baristas can be a little intimidating for an average person.  Yet, oh well, you only live life once.  \n\nSo, customer service would be 3 stars (a-ok) and the coffee for me 4.  The dimly lit booths 3, the outdoor patio in the back and front would be a 4.5.  I like the music, but there is only 1 unisex bathroom for a large space.  The price point can be steep for a girl on a budget, yet, I find that these days the coffee shops of this caliber, which are armed with knowledgeable baristas and serving specialty coffee are charging around the same price point.   \n\nIt does seem like mixed feelings, but I'll definitely be back for the pour-over coffee and the really relaxed vibe.  Some people complain about snobbery or such, but I think it actually is relaxing and not too overly stimulating for the senses.\n\n I say that this is my SPLURGE or DATE coffee.  It isn't a starbuck's or peet's and I don't think that Stanza or its comrades are trying to be.  I think that they are aiming for a lifestyle and educational experience while challenging each other to raise the bar (ista).  I think that they are also catering to the dynamically changing neighborhood clientele.", "author": "Hiromi N."}

The music level is to the point that you can put your headphones on and not hear a mix between your music and the Caf\u00e9's. The Baristas that usually work the shift that I am in are Josh and Devin, they are super cool guys that are easy going and get their job done. The owner is also in a lot and is always in a great mood and ready to hear any of your input; I had a critic to make and he listened with open ears and gave me his full attention. They also asked me for my name the second day I came in and haven't forgotten it since. The seating here is awesome, for they are couch/benches, meaning you have about a meter in a half of space for yourself. The location is also something awesome that adds even further to this place, it's on 16th and mission, just off the 16th Bart station, and the cooler part of Valencia. Lighting is just right, not too bright nor too dark, creating a great place for my reading. \n\nTo add even further, they have a front and back patio decorated with great taste, for the sunny days.\n\nI feel really bad in writing this review in the sense that it will attract more business not leaving a seat for me, but I got to give it to these guys and figured since it will naturally become a hit, give them their well deserved merit.

I've been looking for an alternative and have tried a few places, but I think I have now found my spot.\n\nExcellent espresso, friendly baristas, and no long line (yet?).  I'll be swinging by often and enjoying the fine woodwork around the front door :)", "author": "Steve R."}

It has the very hipster- uber-cool- snobby vibe though & one of the types of coffee is $7 per cup which is ridiculous.", "author": "Christy L."}

It has just the right sweetness and wasn't milked down. Love the frothiness of the foam and how it mixed with the espresso. Yumminess all over. The ambiance of the cafe has a tense loungey maybe-im-a-wine-bar feel..like I probably wouldn't have come in if I didnt know for sure this was a coffee shop that actually sold coffee for $5. But the outside is nice.  So i stayed there.", "author": "Mila B."}

The barristas are very friendly, eager to help, without an onze of attitude. However, the coffee itself just wasn't that great. A little too acidic for my taste. Or maybe I am just too much of a Blue Bottle devotee to know how to enjoy a different flavor.", "author": "Candice B."}

The staff is super friendly and unpretentious, the drinks are awesome, it isn't too crowded, and there is WiFI.  Couldn't be happier.  Feel free to come in and get a drink, but don't stay and hang out because I want to continue to be able to get a table whenever I want :-)", "author": "Tom P."}

Uber hip.  Cool, friendly baristas.  Good music pumped over premium speakers expertly placed by an aspiring DJ with acoustics knowledge (assuming).  Only giving it 4 stars because the tea was $4, I didn't feel I could afford tipping on top of that, and that EXACTY expresses the bad things happening to SF with all this tech money coming in.  Now, back to my macbook Pro to do tech work :p", "author": "Six B."}

The coffee is good and the owners/workers are incredibly nice.  All that said, if you are in a rush this is not the place for you because they take the time to make every cup perfect so it takes a little while.  I wish they were open just a little earlier so I could go before I catch the BART to work.", "author": "Andrea G."}

It seems at least a particular barista doesn't care about what sort of music comes out of the speakers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-15", "description": "Stopped into this place this morning while walking to Four Barrel. Nice music and nice atmosphere but got a really strange vibe from the guys behind the counter. I asked what kind of milk they use and was told they have whole or half milk. I asked what brand and was told it's Clover. I asked if it's Organic, and they said it's not, and seemed irritated with my question. Then, I suggested they consider organic, and the guy behind the counter looked like he wanted to kill me, so I walked out. I don't care how good the coffee is, how well trained the baristas might be, or how nice the decor is. In my book, coffee isn't more than 2-stars when it's using milk laced with Monsanto rBGH, other hormones, antibiotics, and chemicals, and coming from cows that lived their lives under unimaginable cruelty. Granted, Clover is one of the better brands, but if a place aspires to be 4 or 5 star, then they should spend a few extra pennies to get organic milk from cows that were not abused in horrific ways. All of the top coffee shops use Clover Organic milk (Blue Bottle, Sightglass, Four Barrel, and Ritual), so it can be done. It's not that hard.", "author": "Eater S."}

Odd that they serve coffee from Intelligentsia in LA when there are so many high quality local wholesale coffee companies they could support.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-11-16", "description": "Went into this place on opening day and was beyond disappointed. I feel as though the owner flagged down the first hipster kid passing along while riding his fixed gear bike and hired him with virtually no experience. Watching them attempt a few cups of slow drip was amusing, to say the least. Not once, not twice but three times I witnessed coffee being dripped off the side of the beaker and into the drain. I corrected him the first time but couldn't help but laugh the next 2 times. Finally got my 4 dollar cup of coffee and it tasted like burnt charcoal. Here's the real kicker, NO CREAM is offered. What kind of elitest establishment is this that offers no cream and sugar that's served from a to-go coffee cup. \"Ohhhh you're one of THOSE people who DRINKS coffee and doesn't ENJOY the coffee.\" Go eff yourself. If I want to sugar coat your disgusting coffee with cream and sugar, then so be it.", "author": "Jessica U."}
