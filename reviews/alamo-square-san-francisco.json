This is my first time visiting since the renovation and I love it even more.  We stayed for longer than we anticipated.\n\nMy kids loved playing in the playground.  There are two separate ones - one for bigger kids and one for little kids.  It was nicely separated.  You didn't have to worry about the bigger kids trampling your little one.  It wasn't crowded on a Friday afternoon.  \n\nThe view of the painted ladies is what we came here for but we got more than we expected.  The walkways allowed foot traffic to move away from the grassy area.  We sat on the grass and didn't have to worry about people walking close by or being stepped on because everyone was walking along the pathway.  Kudos to the city!\n\nThere was a coffee truck (it was just OK) where we grabbed a cup of joe before walking around.  You get some really nice views of the city especially on a clear day.", "author": "Linda R."}

While there, I joined a handful of visitors snapping pictures of the 'Painted Ladies' and downtown San Fran. I stayed for a while after grabbing some shots and relaxed on one of the many benches. This park even has a coffee truck and off-leash dog area. If visiting San Fran, Alamo Square is a must do!", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I've never seen a complete episode of \"Full House\" - just the opening credits that end with the characters having a picnic on the grass in front of the Painted Ladies on Steiner (video: http://bit.ly/2OCSlpt). I have yet to do that since I'd be afraid of being trampled upon by aggressive tourists who take their photos and point and shout, \"Jesse house! Jesse house! Have mercy!\" Regardless of all these psychological barriers, Alamo Square is quite worthy of landing as my 4,300th Yelp review.\n\nIt's been a year since the bulk of the park was shut down for a $5 million renovation to make it more ecologically sound and more in line with tightening climate control measures. The year-long shutdown was worth it as the paved walkways, floral gardens, and the mammoth trees look immaculate now. The playgrounds have also been upgraded, but I could only tell from a distance since I wasn't accompanied by a child. Hell, even the dog park looks inviting to non-dog owners.\n\nIt's definitely a toss-up between this patch of greenery and Dolores Park as far as which represents the definitive photogenic view of San Francisco. There's no doubt that Alamo Square is certainly the windiest bluff in the city, and its proximity to foodie havens like Divisadero Corridor, Hayes Valley, and the Lower Haight make it appealing to hipsters and young families as well as tourists. I also think the Edwardian homes on Scott are just as photogenic as the Tanners' house.\n\nShoo-bit-a-ba-ba-bow!\n...and didn't Emily Blunt and Jason Segel get married here at the end of \"The Five Year Engagement\"? Yes, I think I'm right.\n\nRELATED - Looking for some more greenery in the Bay Area? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed: http://bit.ly/2QJwjmj", "author": "Ed U."}

It has many of the same amenities that other similar parks in The City have.  Still, I've noticed that its popularity has been picking up in recent years.\n\nTwo reasons.  One, those Victorians.  It's subjective to say that this Victorian is better than that Victorian.  But these six on Steiner Street are arguably the most famous in San Francisco.  The owners know that, so they make it a point to keep the exteriors looking perfect.\n\nTwo, \"Full House\".  Nearly everyone who came of age in the `90s knows that the introduction ends with Danny Tanner, his three girls, and his two buddies having a picnic on that steeply sloping lawn, with the frame playing up those Victorians and the skyscrapers in the distance.  Alamo Square is quickly becoming known as \"the Full House park\".  Now the next generation, \"Full House Too\", is being made for Netflix, and the end of THAT intro is the same thing, this time with DJ, Stephanie, and Kimmie and their kids on the lawn.\n\nWhen the inlaws have come here from Southeast Texas, if I'm in SF with them, I've made it a point to take them to this park.  They didn't watch \"Full House\".  But this point, halfway up Hayes from Steiner, encapsulates San Francisco, a city that embraces its history while forging into the future and giving both resident and tourist a chance to rest and take it all in.\n\nThere's more to Alamo Square than that view, I admit that I'm not an expert on all that's here.  But if that view is all you get, then that's good enough.", "author": "Ron L."}

You'll find many people sitting, laying, reading, talking, basking in the sunshine on a nice day.  Even if it was a cold, overcast day you'll probably still find large groups of people because of the Painted Ladies, made famous by Full House -- a TV show that I grew up with and brings warm, fuzzy feelings of the 90's. (*note - The real Full House house is located on another street)\n\nIt looks like they've made some upgrades recently since the last time I've visited. New pathways have been created, a fun playground for the kiddos was installed, & I think a tennis court (not sure, was that always there?! I don't remember it the first time around).  Definitely all great additions to the park, IMO!\n\nThere's also a lot of awesome food spots around Alamo Square.  Pick-up some bites and bring it to the park and enjoy it with a view!

The Park reopened on May 24th and I found out that all but 5 benches were ripped out! The park is halfway re-sodded  and many trees were cut down. This is a 12.7 acre park with one of the most famous views in the world. It has a large off-leash area for dogs at the peak of the hill and a tennis court. \n\nThere used to be over 30 benches in the park so that one could stroll up and down the rolling hills and socialize with the regulars and tourists, watch the sunset and enjoy the fantasy views of the city. It was a great place to watch a lunar eclipse last year and share our delight with the crowds that came out to view it.  The reproduction 1920's street lights and Victorians ringing the park could transport the mind to a bygone era. It is truly a community experience that was beautiful and welcoming. \n\nNow that the benches are gone and there is nowhere to sit it is now a scenic pass-through for commuters from the Peninsula getting on or off the google busses. With no place to sit it is hostile to park visitors, especially those with mobility issues such as the disabled and the elderly. \n\nNow that there is no place to linger there is no longer that welcoming sense of community that drew us there for years. We called London Breed, the 5th District Supervisor and President of the Board of Supervisors. We called the Mayor's Office of Disability and our supervisor in District 8. No one knows if the benches will be replaced and there is no update on the Park and Rec website. \n\nThere are no trash cans at the moment. We are told at least one will be installed at the playground.  The steps are in the same state of disrepair they were before the so-called $5,300,000.00 renovation.

Why, yes it is, says the internet. Granted the Full House used for exterior shots is not very close by, but this is a pretty neat park to visit. On one side, you'll enjoy the picturesque shot of the Painted Ladies as well as a lot of other people who have the same idea as you. It's also a very expansive park, great for dog walking and for enjoying the swings as I did (even though I am an adult, I still can't say no to swings). There are some steep areas in walking so if you are here just to see the row of houses, try to go up on the right side and not like us on the opposite side--great exercise but a little more tiring at the end when you finally locate the side with the houses.\n\nThere may be some street parking, but it looks pretty limited.

We weren't surrounded by people and we had a view of the downtown/civic center area and the painted ladies.

There are some restaurants and convenience stores a few (very hilly) blocks away, but none actually next to the park. \n\nWe spent the afternoon playing games and laying on the blanket people watching.

We spent the morning scraping weeds off of the cracks and crevices along the sidewalk and curb on the Fulton Street and Steiner Street sides of the park.  We encountered numerous tour buses and even had our photos taken by some of the tourists.  Many stopped to ask about our organization (One Brick) and our work.\n\nAfter the work was done I had a chance to walk around the park.  The park appears to be super dog-friendly, but wow, what fantastic views of the City's skyline!  Even on a gray, overcast morning like yesterday the views were spectacular.  There are lots of grassy areas too and a cool children's playground which incorporates the inspiration of the nearby \"painted ladies\" into its design (pictured).  \n\nI still can't believe it's taken me a lifetime to discover this park.\n\nBTW - Kudos to the Friends of Alamo Square organization who brought us water, hot coffee, bagels, breakfast pastries and some super, moist and decadent chocolate brownies.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

There is a deli/convenience store nearby (plus!) in case you wanted to have an impromptu picnic and it's perfectly situated along the Bay to Breakers route (plus! plus!).\n\nWithin the past year, they cleared out the a lot of the underbrush below the tall trees and in some other areas so that certain people and activities would be discouraged to stay. Turns out it worked!\n\nGreat place for families. There is a lovely playground area that is kept just as clean as the rest of the place. One tennis court is available (no lights for night-time though) nestled among the trees. There are also public restrooms available (but I'd leave those for the tourists).", "author": "Jasmyn M."}

I wanted to meet some ladies....The Painted Ladies.\n\nThese Damsels of the Bay truly are a must see (even if they've been snapped, photo-ed, painted, etched, filmed, and written by many a person).  \n\nI was lucky to make it here on an excellent-weather day.  Sure the Painted Ladies are the stars here, but there is so much more.  So, snap your pictures of the dolled up chicas, but be sure to explore this park.  This park is a green space with a small hill at its center.  At the peak, you will find a banos/loo/bathroom which was rockin' it's early 20th Century grandeur and was surprisingly clean---California budget woes???  I wouldn't know it from this spic 'n' span bathroom pit stop.\n\nOn the hill you have very tall and cool trees and shrubbery of many types.  Work them into your 360degrees of photo opportunities here.  People-watching also abounds here.  If you're a doggie lover, this park also serves you well with all sorts of mutts running with abandon in the sun on the green green grass.\n\nSpeaking of grass, I ended up parking myself on a patch and ended up pulling out my Don Quixote (Yeah, Cervantes has accompanied me to many places.  This book is my Sancho on my worldly adventures of slaying city serpents).  I tried to read a few pages, but as usual, my surroundings were too distracting.\n\nOk, this is my challenge for you.

But I'll point out two things you probably don't know about Alamo Square.  Up by the bathrooms and tennis court, there are plants potted in different kinds of footwear.  The tradition is that when you move out of the neighborhood, you leave a pair of shoes or heels or ski boots for the groundskeeper to pot plants in.  I hope I won't be leaving my shoes for a long time.  They filmed part of Invasion of the Body Snatchers in the playground.  \n\nThis park makes me proud to live in San Francisco and this neighborhood.  I take it for granted, but it doesn't hold it against me.  It's also a nice place to take dogs and kids, preferably at the same time.\n\nOh, and I absolutely abhor Full House, but you people really did not watch your sitcoms very closely.  The opening of Full House has them picnicking in Alamo Square, but their house is not one of the Painted Ladies.  Their house is actually in the Marina or Cow Hollow or whatever.  It has a red door.

The park itself has a nice tennis court.  I love how the tennis courts in San Francisco are always located at these perfect places.  (remember the tennis courts at the Presidio?)  No tennis player is really looking at the view while actually concentrating on the ball, but there is a certain aesthetic appeal to having a tennis court perched on the top of a hill, with Victorian residences in the foreground and almost every sightable sight in the background.\n\nThe dog park is a wonderful little patch of land, and even though I don't have a dog myself and don't even live in San Francisco, I wish I'd one day be a pet owner, playing with his pet on top of this park.  \n\nOne must mention the Painted Ladies.  If you're into architecture history, make sure you check out the painted ladies from the park, especially when the sun is hitting just the roof tops.  A mix of Victorian style houses and Edwardian style houses, both truly dating back to the time that these styles existed.  \n\nThe romance of San Francisco is fully appreciated in the Alamo square area.

As we walk through the park they too begin to understand what makes this place so special.  \n\nThe views from Alamo Square juxtapose the old Victorian Painted Ladies with the modern Financial District and a perfectly painted California sky in the background.  Sometimes I come here-  just stare and think...\"I'm not in Michigan anymore, thank goodness.\"\n\nAs an everyday venue, this is a great park to take your dog off-leash or go for a run yourself.  There is a nice playground and plenty of benches for taking in the views.  \n\nI took off one star because the tennis courts really need to be worked on.  I live close by, but will never play here on these cracked courts.", "author": "Floyd R."}

Its the dog park.  I go, take the pooches, and sit back and watch the interactions of this huge community of dogs.  On nice days the park is packed, and you can usually find a friend....for your dog.  Its awesome.  Most of the dog owners don't even talk to each other.  They admire one another's dogs, and see who sniffs whose butt, and who wants to play.  Just watching makes me super calm.  With my ipod on, nothing else matters.  It is a very zen place for me...and I'm glad its only a few blocks away.\n\nAnd a side note.  Calm environments, such as the chaos of the dog park are very therapeutic...but you know what else is?  Having sex to heavy metal.  I would NOT recommend doing that in Alamo Square, ...but even if you aren't a metal fan...try it, you might like it.

I've watched every episode of Full House at least 5 times so seeing this was a historical moment, for me at least.  Embarrassingly enough, the bf and I even took out his iPhone so we could listen to the theme song and see if the colors of the houses have changed.  I wonder if the residents (are there any?) mind that people are just sitting there staring at their houses.  No wonder all the curtains are pulled shut.  I brought my dog here and let him run around off-leash which was great because all the other dogs were running freely too!  On a sunny day, I would like to bring a blanket and sleep out on the poop-infested but very green grass. How can you beat beautiful Victorian houses with the SF skyline in the back?

Alamo Square Park is a tiny park, but high up on a hill. The park itself has several steep hills. Views from all around the park are beautiful, but people come from far and wide for The Postcard Row...aka The Painted Ladies...aka The \"Full House\" House. The ornately-kept Victorians of yesteryears with the modern cityscape in the back drop, we've seen it in a million postcards.

There are always plenty of other pooches to play with and great owners.

If your puppy isn't picky (like mine is) they'll be more than happy to bring back some body's ball for you to throw again. \nThere is (of course) a drinking fountain for the dogs at the top of the hill. \nAs I said- I am always on the dog side of the park.

Alamo Square park itself is a fairly small and very hilly park that includes basketball courts, a dog run, a field full of tourists photographing the famous row of 6 houses, and all the other features you'd come to expect from a public park. If you're just looking for a nice San Francisco park I'd recommend going to Mission Dolores which is better maintained and offers a better view of the city, Buena Vista which has lots of serene shaded paths to walk around, or of course Golden Gate Park for just about anything. For all intents and purposes this is actually a review of the painted ladies. A \"painted lady\" is actually the term for any Victorian or Edwardian styled home painted in 3 or more colors to enhance its architecture. Even though about 48,000 Victorian and Edwardian homes were built in San Francisco between 1849-1915, it's the series of 6 painted ladies at Alamo Square that were built between 1892-1896 that have become the most well known. What makes them so well known? Perhaps it's the view of the San Francisco skyline behind the buildings or their beautiful exteriors unobstructed by anything besides a few beautiful and well manicured trees (unlike the view of countless cables that obscure almost every view in the city) or maybe it's their use in countless movies, postcards, and television shows (most notably the opening credits for Full House). For you Full House fans out there, Alamo square and the painted ladies were featured in the opening sequence to the show but the Tanner family home was actually shown as being 1709 Broderick Street which is about 15 blocks north of the park.", "author": "Matt E."}

I think that is a travesty.\n\nSo, despite the beautiful view on a clear day, I still can't understand why any tourist would want to come here, take a few pics of the houses and then leave.

What better way to spend it than to go park hopping. Alamo square was one of the stops on our adventure, and my favorite one. Mostly because I got to introduce my new BFF to the Painted Ladies. After a year of living here, she had never been to Alamo Square! I know! I couldn't believe it either! On this sunny Saturday, the park was filled with people laying out on beach blankets, sharing packed lunches, and snuggling in the sun. It was the perfect day to show my friend the gorgeous view beyond the Painted Ladies.", "author": "Casi C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-07-12", "description": "So pretty.  Easily the prettiest place in the city, IMHO.  SOOOO  pretty.  God, how much do I love this park.  ITs not that big, and its on a big hill, which makes it much more of a hangout park than a sport playing park (which is fine by me).  There's a dog side, a tennis side and a sitting side.  The dogs kinda have the run of the place, but they're soooo cute and their owners are pretty good about picking up after them, so its not a problem!\n\nHere's what you do: go here in the Early afternoon when its sunny and bring some wine and some cups.  You can bring beer if you want, but you might be told by the police to get out of here you crazy kids if they catch you with it.  Wine is much more mellow and respected by law enforcement.  So, yeah, you do that, and you bring some antipasto or little sandwiches with no crust and a bunch of your friends that you LOOOVE soo much.  We're talking heaven on the grass, real life wine and roses shit.  \n\nThere's an amazing view of the city, FiDi to Twin Peaks to Inner Richmond/Sunset.  Its perched up on little hill and is always in the sun, unless the stupid clouds have rolled in.\n\nThe only problem with this park is that it is often the windiest place in San Francisco.  If you come here anywhere close to sunset you're gonna get blasted soooo hard its gonna make you wish that you had brought that second jacket.   But the thing is, even if you HAD brought it, you'd still be cold and/or your friends would have forgotten theirs, so just know you're gonna have to leave when the sun gets low.\n\nOnly other drawback is that the tour buses drop people off here, which kinda harshes your mellow until you realize that you're living in a tourist destination and then you get ecstatically happy about how lucky a roll of the dice you got to be born into this life of yours.\n\nHere's a super-secret secret:  this park is gorgeous at Sunrise.  I'd say start here at fool's dawn after a night of drinking and wait until daybreak.  No matter what kinda night you've had you're going to feel small and light.  Just don't talk loud.

The southwest corner of the park is the best view and the best place to sit. There is also a small children's playground in the middle of the park if you have kids.\n\nThe park was relatively quiet and peaceful. The intricate Victorian houses are cool to gaze at.\n\nI'd say this park isn't the best to come with a bunch of people to play ultimate frisbee or something, but is better for a smaller group to share lunch or just relax and sleep.\n\nYay I love city parks!

Why is this place called Alamo Square?\n2. Which one of those houses was actually the Full House house?\n3. Where can I find Uncle Joey?\n\nNot! I don't really care about Uncle Joey, but the funny thing is... when I visited this place I couldn't help but to find it amusing how there were all these international tourists that came to check out this place and somehow all knew it as the the Full House houses. I mean was that show that big that these people really traveled millions of miles just to check out the Full House house? Sad to say, but according to Wikipedia \"Contrary to popular belief, the red-doored Victorian where the Tanners live is not one of these houses. The address of the Tanner house was mentioned in \"Blast From the Past\" as being located at 1882 Girard Street in San Francisco, CA.\" and not to mention the show was never even recorded in any of those houses! So I don't even know why I refer to these houses as the Full House house or why I even get excited whenever I pass by this park. I guess somehow the Intro to that show fooled me into believing it was located there and that since it was featured on a popular TV show, being in the same vicinity as these houses just makes them cooler. But aside from all that, Alamo Square is a lovely park.

Every TV show and movie set here uses it as an establishing shot, especially if they're filmed in Vancouver.  Welcome to my backyard - or front garden, if you will, as I live on one of its corners and have a smashing view of all that greenery. It's never more beautiful (or eerie) than when shrouded in fog at dawn, never more crowded than at the height of tourist season, when busloads of camera-toting visitors invade it to snap pix of the Painted Ladies. From other vantage points you can see that lone tall white apartment building towering above Pacific Heights, and on a clear day the top of the Golden Gate Bridge. I love to sit here and read mid-afternoon, before everyone gets home from work and dashes over to let Fido run free. Some day I hope to own one of those famous houses and paint it black or hang a huge sign that says 'F*CK YOU' just to freak out the photo fiends. In the meanwhile, join me on my bench and chat for awhile.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

The venue was Alamo Square, and the organizers were (surprise!) a bunch of my kickball friends of the pigmentally-challenged persuasion. \n\nIt started with a few libations at Madrone and The Page (cause children's games apparently can't be played without adult beverages), and then it was off to the park. With the teams dressed in camouflage or head-to-toe ninja black and the sun setting behind us, we were ready to enter stealth mode and get down to business. Some of us (um, me) even brought ninja stars and a sai. Battle lines were drawn, the jails were stocked with 30 packs of Bud Light, and we squared off. Truly, this was no kiddie version of capture the flag.  \n\nIt was an epic clash, with each team having secured one victory (simultaneously, at that) and the deciding match on the line. By now, it was well into hour two of what historians have already dubbed \"The Battle of Alamo (Square Park)\", and this girl desperately needed to use the little soldier's room. But these are times of war, people, and there's no running across the street to use the gas station loo in such critical circumstances. Besides... the sidewalk was out of bounds.\n\nSo, I found myself an appropriately sheltered bush located behind my team's jail, and assumed the position. With my spandex around my ankles, and a stream of relief exiting my body, I suddenly heard the crunch of the leaves made by an enemy approaching. With my adversary unaware of my position, I laid in wait for the opportune moment to unleash my impromptu defensive strategy. Just as my foe was about to turn the corner of my enclave, I said to him in my most menacing tone,\"Take one step closer buddy and you'll be entering a world of pain... and by pain, I mean urine.\" Suffice to say, the kid BOOKED it back to his side, and away from his intended goal. Point: Anna K.\n\nWhile I'm usually not one to toot my own horn (you hush), I think its pretty safe to say I piss all over the competition.", "author": "Anna K."}

Sometimes my old shoes go missing in my closet and I find them stuffed with earth and pansies in the garden at Alamo. Sometimes on Valentine's day there is a park bench I reserve with red caution tape that says \"Love Crime About to be Committed\". Sometimes in a headband and wooden raquet, I say \"Game, Set, Match....shall we have a cocktail now?\" Sometimes the downtown skyline leaps so fiercely to my eye I think I am going to explode with the weight of the ancients.

He is smitten and so am I. Hee hee. \nThe views here are smashing, doggies and children playing around are uplifting, it screams bring a picnic, bring a kite, bring a camera, bring someone special. I highly also recommend bringing a bottle of soap bubbles (see my Burma Superstar review) as they are fun and really when was the last time you went to the park to blow bubbles? If you can't remember and/or it's been over decade go and buy some darn you!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-08-23", "description": "This place is WAY over-rated.  \n\nOk, the views are great.  The \"painted ladies\"  look much better on the picture, when you make the right cut.  The big building on the right side of the \"ladies\" really doesn't fit in.  \n\nI would drive by with friends from out of town.  Maybe I would even want to go in for a few minutes to take some pictures for the album.  But I would NOT take my child there again, not in a million years.  \n\nAt first, I actually liked the views and the painted-ladies theme of the playground.  I thought it was kind of cool.  \n\nHowever, as soon as we got near with my 3-years old, we saw a crowd of parents and kids hitting that mexian toy with a big stick, as a bunch of toddlers were curiously wandering around.  I had a hard time keeping my son away from them.   ARE YOU PEOPLE NUTS?  If you let your kids play a game like that, do it in your own back yard, or get a secluded section!!!  \n\nSecond, there are two or more gates, and people don't keep them locked.  Some kids would run out and go around, and if a child escapes, good luck catching up with him!  \n\nThe biggest slide is actually dangerous in the way it is designed.  It has an opening at the top, where kids can fall out and get hurt.  \n\nThe facilites are dirty.  Only some of the kids are supervised.  Most of the parents looked like the weirdest crowd of lower-height folks that you wouldn't normally invision as parents: pierced, greasy-haired, tatooed, lather-dressed punks.  And what do you expect, it is only steps away from Tenderloin and lower Height.\n\nThere are older kids who come and go, as they wish.  At one point I found my son playing with a much older kid and his \"parent\" in the sandbox.  I thought it was strange for a kid this old to play in a sandbox.  So, I leaned over to look.  The older kid's \"parent\" turned out to be an oversized teenager, and he had a super-sharp object in his hand that looked like an oversized tweezer.  They left, as soon as I leaned over.  And then I saw the oversized teenager was explaining his buddy how to hit someone with that sharp object.  What was his intention about my son or another baby?!  I asked the guy to put that thing away, and soon they left the playground.  I still wonder if I should have called the cops.  The most disturbing of it all was that everything was taking place in my plane view, and in the plane view of many other parents.  And I was the only one who told the teenager to put away that super-sharp scary object.\n\nAnyway, I am so disgusted with this nasty little place.

Quiet on the non-downtown-view side of the park, though of course the view is stellar. Don't miss the random \"shoe garden\" behind a small building (bathrooms, once upon a time?) in the middle of the park!", "author": "El K."}

Yes, it is where the \"Full House\" houses are located, also known as the \"Painted Ladies.\" It's beautiful here, especially when the locals walk their beautiful dogs. Last time I was here I saw a great dane, huskies..etc.. I love dogs. Anywho, this park is awesome. Come with the family and relive the Full house picnic that you always wish you did when you were a kid!! don't LIE! lol..", "author": "Je M."}
