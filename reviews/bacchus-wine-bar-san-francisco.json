The restaurant is certainly off the beaten path and a little bit difficult to spot (no pun intended), since they opted to keep the (super cool) vintage neon record sign outside of the restaurant, the signage for the restaurant is subtle enough that it's probably tough to draw people in off of Mission and Valencia.

He's the guy running a wine bar in California who spent his formative wine years sampling in France, thanks to a fortunate turn of life events.  So his great love is the French, more than the California, grape.  He shares this love with his customers.  Yes, he cares about what you drink.  You will not drink crap on his watch.\n\nThis is all so lucky for you, if you happen to step in -- especially before or after dinner at Zarzuela a few doors away.\n\nMy husband and I discovered Bacchus (and Bodhe, the owner) when we dropped in on a Saturday night.  Because the owner is a low-key guy, and a local, he was pouring that night.  I'd like him on general principle, even if I hadn't gotten to know a bit about his life and the musical tastes while we were in there.  Which I did.\n\nWhat do you want?  It's an intimate space.  This is San Francisco, not Las Vegas.  If you're like me -- maybe you live here because you don't mind people too much?  Maybe you *like* the occasional conversation with someone you've never met? -- you will LOVE this place.\n\nSay hi to Bodhe for me; and thanks.", "author": "Anne B."}

I'm not sure it's really that bad, but the place needs a bit of balance, a bit of a kick in the pants to think a bit harder about its manner and its ambience, not to mention its wine list.  The place is very small and when I first went in, and saw that they were going for Sake as well, I had high hopes of a Tokyo Golden Gai type of experience.  Unrealistic in retrospect, but the wine list is very short and almost totally old world as far as I could see.  Enjoyed the fizz, riesling, malbec (argentinean, the one exception to the old world rule), but the sancerre tasted empty and the trebbiano had that pub wine kick that starts out good but by the end of the glass is giving you a dry mouth. Gewurztraminer also good, but is it ever bad?  Been there twice recently, and the last time was pretty average.  A loud bunch of people who knew each other well dominating the space (not hard, given how tiny it is).  Kinda hard for anyone else to feel comfortable.  The barman also distinctly standoffish (Standoffish? in SF? shurely shome mishtake).  Went to pay him, and as we exchanged check and cash, he started a conversation with someone who was just getting up to leave.  When you're paying top dollar for a glass of wine (or a few, as you may discern from the list above) you expect a certain kind of interchange, right?  A kind of thanks for the biz acknowledgement of your part in the ritual.  Had I been rude earlier?  A cultural crossed-wire?  I saw someone else with a similar experience further down - perhaps it's related to the particular bartender on duty - owner take note.

Bacchus does all that for me and more. \n\nIt's within walking distance to many great restaurants plus ice cream or, if you're in a different mood, laundry. And though many well- groomed and slightly shiny looking people who likely live in the Marina or thereabouts might be seen at Bacchus from time to time, everyone seems to check their attitude at the door and simply enjoy  socializing with friends in a contemporary, cozy, neighborhoody atmosphere. \n\nFriendliest, homegrown bartender ever.", "author": "li a."}
