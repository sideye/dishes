When you buy it, it buys your trust. When you taste it, it tastes you back. When you hold it, it holds your heart. When you look at it, it looks into your soul. It's a coffee that caresses you every so gently that it's almost inappropriate. Every sip made my body jittery in a sensual quiver type of way, comparable to the feeling one gets after watching Twilight. The warm liquid gushes within your body cuddling your innermost feelings. If this coffee were a person, I'd treat her to a nice steak dinner and call her back. I now know what Miguel was talking about in his song \"Coffee\". It wasn't about sex, it was about the love making that occurs in your mouth after that first stimulating sip. \n\nTry Philz Coffee, it's lightweight cheap.", "author": "Andrew C."}

Went to Philz this morning because I wanted to get a quick bite to eat. Got their seasonal fruit danish which was listed at 3.50. When I got my change back I realized that I was taxed on FOOD. Most coffee places in San Francisco don't charge tax, not even the even empire of Starbucks charges tax for their food. This is just a reason why Philz is the new evil empire of coffee. I stopped getting coffee at any Philz over 3 years ago because they raised their prices because supposedly workers started getting health coverage and wages increased although the quality of their coffee at all their locations I use to frequent has dramatically gone down while prices continue to rise for their items. This tax on food at the ocean Ave location was just the final slap in the face.

However, Their coffee experts are very knowledgeable and willing to help you find your perfect cup!\n\nI got the Jacobs wonderbar as the barista recommendation and she got it 100% right.  Best coffee I've had in the US! I loved the flavor ~ with hints of dark chocolate, smoke, and nuts (not smoke from cigars, the meaty smoke I'd assume, but actually didn't taste it so much). All I said was that I liked Lattes that were creamy~ I've also tried the tesora  (with caramel nuts and butter hints) but still prefer Jacobs and continue to order this one.\n\nThey have some real special coffees but I'm conservative so will probably stick to my own, if you want something different, how about trying the mint bonito iced coffee?

The door is always open so it's freezing, and it's small enough that between the two entrances you really can't get far enough inside to be warm. I'm not a business owner, but it seems pretty obvious that if everyone is sitting with their coats on, maybe you should try to make it warmer. It's possible that they do that to stop people from sitting there indefinitely, but if that's what they're doing it doesn't appear to be working. I could be wrong. Other than that, great place.", "author": "Nelson D."}

The shop itself is large and clean but so crowded with students you can't enjoy the expensive coffee you just paid for.", "author": "Dee Dee R."}

This location is where the old Phelan Loop was for the 8X and 49. The shop is huge with plenty of seating and tables available. Since this location is right next to CCSF, there are many students studying or hanging out in the shop. I ordered the Philharmonic which comes with mint leaves. The people working here are friendly and quick at brewing everyone's orders. What sets Philz Coffee apart is that they brew one cup at a time versus other coffee shops that brew by the batch which results in a lack of flavoring. The manager at this location was paying attention to detail, as she was advising one of the baristas on properly setting up the coffee filter. A good alternative to Starbucks and Fog Lifter on Ocean Ave. It's good to see more businesses investing on Ocean Ave, as there is always business from students. But in the most recent years the character of the neighborhood has changed for the good. Empty lots and storefronts are being occupied instead of being empty for years which is good. Good to see a longstanding small business expand across San Francisco and California. Will return more often, as there is no longer a need to go all the way to the Mission for a cup of Philz Coffee.", "author": "Peter C."}

They definitely take the time to make sure you are buying a coffee that you will enjoy. My favorites include the Mint Mohito, Ambrosia (ask for med sweet with Nutmeg!), and the Silken Soul (a combo of the Silken Splendor and Philtered Soul). My girlfriend also loves getting their pastries and bagels for a quick breakfast. Whether you're a coffee expert or drinking coffee for the first time, this is the place to go. Don't be afraid to talk to the baristas, they absolutely can come up with something for you!", "author": "Donel L."}
