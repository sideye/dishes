It was one of the few places in the area that was open with good reviews and a few seats to spare.\n\nWe grabbed a table for six and waited a bit at the bar to be served. It wasn't that busy but the servers seemed out of it and like they weren't aware of what was going on. Took awhile to get our food orders in, and in the meantime a couple of meals came out of the kitchen and they didn't know who they were for.\n\nFortunately we finally got our drinks and our food orders were placed. The food came out within 10 minutes or so. The burgers were decent and I liked the fries. I got the ham sandwich which was bomb - smoky black forest ham on toasted sourdough with gruyere cheese and a fried egg on top. The cheese melted out the sides and got a bit lost, but it was a great balance of smokiness, creaminess and fat. The side salad was just leaves which was a little underwhelming.\n\nAll in, not a bad spot and the food was above average, but there wasn't much of an atmosphere and most of the people around us were sloppy drunk. Sunday evening probably isn't the best time to visit.", "author": "Nicola B."}

After we ordered our drinks, a group of 6 people came in and sat in the back (couch area?). They sat there for 30 minutes before being able to flag down the bartender. He was pretty rude when he walked over and responded to them by saying cant you see I'm the only one working? I get that he was stressed or was having a bad day, but it isn't an excuse to snap at customers. He wasn't exactly the most polite when he came to our table either. The French fries took about 30 minutes to come out -well worth the wait.

Beware if he is the only one working. He does get upset if you take too long or ask too many questions.

We sat at the bar and there were a few decent sized tables behind us.  Though it had a pub vibe and atmosphere, it wasn't too crowded when we went (probably because we went on a Tuesday night at 8pm); it was almost like a tamed version of your typical bar scene.  Service was quick enough that we were there for 45 min though I do find it a bit weird that all of our cooked food / charcuterie came out first before our oysters did (does it take 15 min to shuck 8 oysters and bring them out?).  \n\nFood: quick, comforting, and relatively simple bar food, which worked for us that night!  Highlights of this place are the oysters and clam chowder. \n\n-- Oysters (MP) - we ordered 4 types of oysters; Kumamoto (small, not fleshy, sweet); Kusshi (large, fleshy, balanced between sweet and briny); Marin Miyagi (small, not fleshy, balanced but more toward sweet); another oyster from New Brunswick(blanking on name, almost like a fatter version of Marin Miyagi, recommended by waiter).  All served with lemon and sauces, but they were fine with just lemon.  My favorites in order were the Kumamoto, Kusshi, unknown NB oyster, and Marin Miyagi.\n\nCharcuterie (Salame Calabrese)($8) - they gave quite a bit heap of this salame (esp. when looking at what else we ordered) so that we had a bit of trouble finishing it.  Slightly spicy (as expected with salame) but not too tongue-numbing.  I could have done without this one, but that's just because I'm not the biggest salame fan.  \n\nLa Tur cheese board ($7) - we decided to try this Italian goat/sheep milk cheese and it came on the same board as the salame.  This is a soft cheese and has a bit of a pungent taste to it, which I didn't mind but my boyfriend wasn't too crazy about.  They give you toast to eat the cheese with.  \n\nClam Chowder (Manila Clam, Bacon, Toast)($8 for cup, $15 for bowl) - one of the best clam chowders I've had in a long time.  Not super creamy / thick (I don't like mine super viscous) but not flavorless and watery.  The bacon wasn't too overpowering and there were lots of clams in the soup.  Comes with slices of toast, which I didn't need.\n\nHam and Cheese Sandwich (Black Forest Ham, Gruyere, Egg, Mustard Aioli and side salad)($15) - shared this with my boyfriend, which in the end was a good decision considering how rich/greasy this was in the end.  Reminded me of a croque madame (except egg inside).  Slightly greasy but quite delicious- the cheese went well with the ham and mustard aioli was able to cut some of the richness.  Would have liked the egg slightly more runny.  The side salad was a good palatte cleanser so might be a good idea to eat these greens afterwards.\n\nAll an all, was pleased with my (food) experience at Lord George and would come back again.", "author": "Audrey H."}

RAWR. \n\nI had the 2nd Street Shim with cocchi americano, grenadine, bitters and sparkling wine. The description on the menu was spot on: perfect with afternoon oysters followed by a long night. It's an easy drink to start with and goes really well with those creamy, briny mollusks if you're looking to pair it with something other than bubbly. As a second/third/fourth drink (and you will have consecutive ones, since everything is so damn good!) you can go by route of simple vs. fancy cocktails as stated on the menu.\n\nThe Constant Gardener has calvados, dry white port, Amaro montenegro, grenadine, celery & chocolate bitters garnished with a flamed grapefruit zest. I love that even though this cocktail tastes boozy, all the ingredients are on the lower end of the proof spectrum so you can imbibe and not be trashed while still giving you those savory and complex flavors. \n\nThe Dragon's Blood made me smile! there must bartenders in the house who are G.O.T. fans! Genever is a \"softer\" style gin and the vermouths mixed in this drink plus the grape molasses, actually make this dark drink on the sweeter side. It's a nice chaser after having their bacon clam chowder ;-)\n\nIf you stop by on non-game days, the best oyster deal can be had on this side of the street. $1.50 oysters from 4pm to 6pm! Check your oyster board for the daily specials. The oysters I ordered were fresh and grit-free. I like the Marin Miyagi and Buckley Bay from BC. Even at the regular $3.50 price, I'd buy these over and over again. But like my friend said, they taste even better at $1.50!\n\nCome early and come often because this place fills up quick. I'm not surprised since where else can you drink like a Lord on this side of the park? \n\nGO GIGANTES!", "author": "Janice C."}

We were there the same night and time, and while they might have experienced slow service, it doesn't warrant Lord George getting a 1 star. This was right after the Giants game so it was pretty steady, and keep in mind this is a specialty cocktail bar - good cocktails take time to make. \n\nThe oysters are great and there's a nice variety. Certain oysters are $1 are the weekends! We also had the avocado toast and the smoked salmon, both very good. The avocado toast came with a burrata cheese on the side topped with kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes and sweet corn. It was a delicious topping, and I appreciated that it was on the side so it gives you the option of using it as a topping or not. Since we were just at the game, I stuck with beer and didn't get a cocktail, but I could tell the quality of the cocktails just by watching them being made.

The portion size was decent and it also came with toast. There was a good amount of clams in it though the chowder seemed a bit thinner than most that I've had, but it was still quite good, and having toast on the side to dip into it was nice.\n\nBased on the menus, it seemed like this place would be good for drinks, but I unfortunately did not order any so I can't comment on those.\n\nI got a stomach ache shortly after eating here, but it's probably because I have a weak stomach as other people in my group also had the oysters and the chowder and were fine after.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

HH is Monday through Friday, 4pm to 6pm, so I had my friend order a HH item before I got there. He arrived around 5:30pm to snag a table as I wasn't sure if I was going to make it in time for HH.\n\nHappy Hour: Mon - Fri, 4-6pm\n*Half priced oyster of the day: Fanny Bay, BC ($19 for a dozen)\n*Beer: Carlsberg ($4)\n*Wine: Cava ($7), Rose ($8)\n*Cocktail: John Rose - rye, apple brandy, grenadine, lime, bitters ($8)\n\nI wanted to try the oysters, so we got a dozen HH oysters. They are half priced during HH, so they were $1.58 each making them $3.16 at full price. The oysters were crisp, creamy and clean with a nice briny flavor. My favorite way to eat them was just with some lemon and hot sauce. My friend got a HH beer and I got a HH cava. Though they charged me for a Rose which I didn't notice til after we left. Oh well, it's only a dollar difference.\n\n*Rye Manhattan: rye, Italian vermouth, bitters ($12) x2\n*Carlsberg ($6)\n*Money For Nothin': bonded rye, reposado tequila, pineau de charentes, ginger, grapefruit, lemon, walnut bitters\n*Nikka coffey still ($14)\n*Cobra Kai: Japanese whiskey, cocoa, ancho chile, vino aperitivo, citrus, honey, bitters ($14)\n*Highland park 12 year ($14)\n*Springbank 12 year cask strength ($15)\n\nWe spent a good two hours at Lord George, so I needed some drinks! I love the rye manhattan. It was nice and strong and not too sweet. After that, I just stuck with straight ours. I wanted Oban 14, but they didn;t have it. So I got a highland park 12 and nikka coffey.\n\n*French fries ($6): meyer lemon aioli\n*Ham & Cheese ($13): prosciutto, gruyere, egg\n*Clam Chowder ($15 bowl): manila clam, bacon, toast\n\nWe got a couple snacks as well. I only tried the clam chowder. I really only wanted a cup, but a friend of mine wanted to have some as well so we ordered the bowl. This bowl is huge, so unless you want A LOT of soup, a cup should be fine. It had a nice savory flavor due to the bacon and lots of clams, but it was a little too salty for me. And I love salty food!\n\nGreat place for HH. If you can make it by 6pm, order the HH oysters! That and a glass of HH bubbly and I'm a happy girl!", "author": "Elena N."}

I haven't tried the oysters but I expected more from the rest of the menu. The tartines were difficult to eat and looked better than they tasted.\n\nThe shape of the space is long and narrow, not my favorite layout. On the right hand side are tables for up to 6-8 people. Essentially all of the seating is on high stools. It's not very comfortable for sitting for long periods of time and I wish they had more seating designated for parties of 2 so that you don't either have to 1) sit at the bar, or 2) sit at a large table and hope that no one comes to share the table with you.\n\nThis is one of the better options if you're in the area for a game.

It definitely reminds me of a smaller and more mature looking Southside Spirit House.\n\n5pm on a Tuesday, the whole place was packed. Crazy! I guess everyone had the same idea as us. Although it says they don't take reservations on Yelp, a few tables in the back were reserved. They have 2 TVs, so yay sports!\n\nHappy Hour (4pm-6pm):\n- 1/2 off oysters (oysters are normally $3)\n- $4 Trumer\n- $7 cava\n- $8 rose\n\nTheir beers on tap are around $6-8, and they have my second favorite beer (Black Butte Porter)! Simple and fancy cocktails cost around $10-13. The difference? The fancy cocktails have a few more ingredients than the simple ones. \n\nRecommendations:\n\n- Cobra Kai ($12): Japanese whiskey, cocoa, ancho chile, vino aperitivo, citrus, honey, bitters. \n- Gold Rush ($11) bourbon, lemon, honey.\nThese two are very popular! A bit on the sweet side.\n\n- Oxford Comma ($13): armagnac, aged rum, French and Italian Vermouth, grenadine, bitters.\n\n- Snake Bite Kit ($12): mezcal, tequila, Galliano, grapefruit, lime, bitters.\nThis was very easy to drink. A bit too light for my taste!\n\n- Dreams Old Men Dream ($12): Manhattan, negroni, Old Fashioned, combined!\nThis dream sounds like the dream! Smokey and overall a great drink!\n\nBesides drinks, they also serve oysters and food. The food items are definitely on the pricey side, and they're not full meals, just light bar bites.

My friend and I ordered a dozen oysters, which were about $1.75 each after the HH 50% off, and all four of the HH drinks (I guess we were a little thirsty? LOL). The oysters came out very slowly - we were almost done with our first round of drinks before they arrived, but they were pretty big and juicy so that made up for it. The cava sparkling wine recommendation is on point! The ros\u00e9 wine wasn't as sweet as I expected, but not bad either. I liked the Carlsberg beer, which was a pretty light lager, but thought the daiquiri was a little too acidic for my taste. Props to them for making a strong drink though!\n\nYou can sit at either the bar or a table, but there are probably less than 50 seats total; one group actually asked to join our table because there were no other seats available. The atmosphere here is more chill and quiet compared to bars closer to downtown/FiDi, but it's nice to be able to converse with your friends at a normal speaking tone. It is a little on the expensive side, as my friend and I each paid $30, so I probably would only come for HH.

Usually I'm skeptical of bars that also advertise themselves as slash \"gastropubs.\" Seems to me like a pretentious way of labeling food that's slightly better than the typical fish n chips and sliders. However, Lord George's food menu deserves whatever added prestige that silly label is meant to confer. \n\nWe had a dozen oysters to start with, sampling all the different types offered. They were all quite fresh and tasty, although I later balked at the $38 price tag (my fault, really, for throwing caution to the wind with Market Prices). I had the Duck Confit Banh Mi Tartine, basically a roast duck open-faced sandwich. The duck was smoky and flavorful without being too dry, but it wasn't actually anything like a banh mi, and it was a bit unnecessarily difficult to eat (I guess I don't understand the point of serving two halves of a sandwich separately, but to each their own). My girlfriend had the clam chowder, which wasn't too salty and had a nice home-cooked taste.\n\nThe beer and cocktail selection has some quirky looking options and I will definitely want to try some other options when I come back. The Jungle Spy is a refreshing gin-based drink that reminds me of a cross between a mojito and a mint julep.\n\nOverall a solid, classier bar with better than average food.

The reviews for Lord George looked pretty good, so we decided to try it out.\n\nWhen we arrived, the kitchen was closing (so most of the main menu was unavailable to us), but our server told us that there were a few things we could still order. So order we did.\n\nThe charcuterie plate was good. We had 3 meats and 2 cheeses, and added the asparagus to that as well. The asparagus was great. There's no way to screw up cured meats and cheese (unless you offer bad selections), so that was a win.\n\nWe also ordered some french fries to share. They were good, but again, a side dish that's hard to mess up.\n\nI had two glasses of wine, both of which I enjoyed.\n\nTwo of us also order the clam chowder. This is where it went south (record scratch!). Not trying to sound overly sensationalistic, but I've had better chowder out of a can. It was watery with very little flavour, the clams were rubbery (perhaps forgivable since it was the end of the night for their kitchen), but essentially I got a big bowl of potatoes. The menu described it as being made with bacon (as a good chowder should), but instead, we got bacon bits crumbled on top. No smoky flavour in the soup. In fact, no flavour at all.\n\nWe also had the tuna tartare, and to be quite frank, this was the most disappointing tuna tartare I've ever had. The fish seemed fresh enough, but there were too many cucumbers, and the avocado was nowhere near ripe enough. On top of that, there seemed to be no flavour in it at all -- just completely bland (see a theme here?).\n\nI'm not completely writing them off, as I didn't get to try their mains, and we caught them at a time which might not have allowed them to put their best foot forward.

My wife and I decided to go to the remaining two seats at the bar instead of continue waiting for a server.  The area we sat at was still a little wet so I asked the bartender to wipe it.  He did not do a good job since there was a puddle of water on my side of the bar.  I asked him if he can give me a towel so that I can clean it.  He gave me a towel and smirked, \"Normally people don't sit at the bar where it is dirty.\"  Was it our fault that we did not get acknowledged on the way in or waited at a table with no service?   Already I am thinking the raving reviews on Yelp was misguided and this will probably be my last time here.  The only saving grace for this restaurant is that the food was decent.  We had clam chowder, kale Cesar salad, avocado toast, and oysters.  The food was quite pricey for what it was.  The oysters were half price because it was a weekend.

Definitely want to try the other items on the charcuterie platter options.  It was really hard just choosing 2 items, but Adam the bartender was also really helpful in giving recommendations on our platter.  Next time, I try the pickled carrots!!", "author": "Janel C."}

A great bartender = awesome drinks, and you can definitely expect that here. Really great fancy cocktails and they served up a decent dirty martini as well!\n\nOther than the bartender/drinks, it was meh in terms of service. The gentleman who brought us our food (2 tartines: whipped avocado and duck confit) didn't seem to want to help with anything, just drop off the food. We asked if the Tartines could be cut into 3 pieces, he said \"they are\" ....they definitely were not. I don't know what is difficult about taking the food back to the kitchen and asking for a couple slices in the bread, but he was not having it. Also, why lie to paying customers? Whatever.\n\nTartine's were tasty - we were fans of both that we selected. I also ordered some oysters, which were very fresh and tasty. I would go back for the oysters alone and not ask for anything that needs extra attention (I'd rather not be lied to by the staff who doesn't want do anything). \n\nOur server was nice, but kept walking away when we wanted to place an order (pretty bizarre). The tasty food makes up for the lackluster staff/service. A cute place if you are in the area and fancy a \"fancy\" cocktail (pun intended).", "author": "Nikki R."}

I like the tables they have installed - the previous place didn't have one table that was stable. The bar staff was good and friendly and I think the prices are reasonable, too. Nice drink menu and wines/beer choices were more than acceptable. I see Christine S compared it to Southside Spirit House and I agree the look and feel is similar.\n\nSadly, I am not a fan of oysters so some of the thrill of the menu is lost on me. There really was only one thing on the menu well suited for me so if I have a criticism, its the menu choices - they are nice but limited. Its not unusual to sell a burger for $15 these days so just having a burger on the menu would open up some choices for a lot of people. I know its not trying to be Perry's or anything like it, but having some standards (i.e.; fancy burger) would be a nice expansion.\n\nIn the end, I had the \"ham & cheese\" sandwich which was very good, my partner had the whipped avocado sandwich - also very good. \n\nSo if the menu were to expand a bit, I'd say this is the best place in the immediate area.

Jason(?), our bartender, was courteous and kept an eye out for us in case we needed anything. \n\nWe ordered drinks first, mine was a Manhattan and it came out perfect.  I got similar feedback from my friends regarding their drinks, a minted mule, a mojito and I forgot what the last one was but I think it was a gold rush. For food, we ordered a dozen mixed oysters and they came out on a raised, iced tray with 3 different sauces (one had soy sauce, one had vinegar, and the last was cocktail, none plain, all altered to compliment the oysters). The oysters were chilled, fresh and very tasty, although we ordered a dozen I could've eaten a 100. We also ordered some fries and they came out great. They came with a side of ketchup and mayo but the mayo seemed either made from scratch or something was added which did not turn out bad at all.  We enjoyed the drinks so much our \"one drink, we're in a hurry\" turned into an \"alright, one more lets get a cobra Kai\" which was a tasty and unique drink that came out tasting like oranges, lemons and chocolate. We will definitely be back! Our total tab for a dozen oysters, fries and six drinks came out to $110 including tip.", "author": "Jared S."}

Specifically, I had Dreams Old Men Dream and Federal Sword. Dreams was a combination of three cocktails: Negroni, Manhattan, and Old Fashioned. And despite the enthusiasm displayed by our waitress for the drink, I felt that it was disappointing. The unique characteristics of each of the 'constituent drinks' were sacrificed in the creation of this cocktail. And while I like innovation--and absurdity even--I also like thoughtful balance. Harmony is the key to a good cocktail, and this one lacked it. Federal Sword, meanwhile, was much better balanced and had a delightful nose, though that is to be expected from rye and calvados.\n\nTo eat, we had the chopped salad, which didn't captivate my taste buds. In fact, I felt it was a bit soupy (likely owing to the small amount of lettuce in favor of cucumber and the choice of dressing). However, the other two members of my party were delighted by it, so I'd give the salad 4 stars with the understanding that its execution was fine and that it simply didn't agree with my palate.", "author": "Alastair C."}

I came here for a cocktail on a Wednesday afternoon before a company scavenger hunt. Got a gin drink, Jungle Fever or something, tasted like sunshine and Summer in a glass. \n\nLater in the day when we were on our scavenger hunt we needed help taking a paparazzi style picture. The staff was happy to help, made me a fake martini, and let us take over a booth for our photo shoot. They were great sports. I will def be back for happy hour 1/2 oysters!!", "author": "Aimee A."}

I wasn't that impressed with the selection and a few things we wanted to order were no longer available and food was only okay.  It's definitely a happening place but really loud so be prepared for a lot of yelling to carry a conversation. Service was good even though it was a busy night.

I ordered the Dreams Old Men Dream (combo of Old Fashioned, Negroni, and Manhatten) and really enjoyed it. It's definitely on the sweeter side and but still enjoyable. We also ordered the oysters, charcuterie platter, clam chowder and duck confit open sandwich. I thought the food was solid but very typical of what you can find in many other similar venues in SF. I found the volume a bit loud loud to the point where it required us to yell so the waiter could get our order. Also made it hard for a conversation between two people. I recommend coming here with a larger group or make sure to sit at the bar of its just for a party of two. Kind of felt like an a-hole for taking up a whole table with just two people.", "author": "Victor H."}

Actually, I think it was the fancy cocktails that kept us there.  I don't even know what I was drinking (I just asked Adam our gifted bartender to \"surprise me!\") and he succeeded by serving one deliciously potent potion after another.

We went to SF for our anniversary and decided to go here for \"brunch\". I was craving oysters and this seemed like the best place with that and a bar. According to yelp, there were two other places that might have had really delicious menus but they weren't hungry and/or were on the wharf. And I totally did not feel like dealing with the parking, crowds, etc. So Lord George it was. We were the first ones there (pretty much got there at 11am when they opened).  I'm so glad we went there because the oysters were delicious!! We also started off with bloody marys which went perfect. We were going to go off and bar hop after that but the bartender was so awesome we decided to stay. We also had to find wi-fi around 1pm so my boyfriend could do some work stuff and they had it there. We stayed until probably two oclock because the bartender made us feel so comfortable and  was making us awesome drinks! I can't wait to go back to SF and make this one of our regular places.", "author": "Veronica R."}

First off the staff was extremely friendly and had no problem waiting on all of us while we decided on what we wanted. Second their drink selection is great and third, we will be going back soon just from how friendly the bartenders were. They made us feel at home even though we had never been there before. We got fries, empanadas and several beers. The empanadas were great and extremely flavorful. Fries were good also! But they best part was that I had an event going on and I had to leave my girlfriend here while I was at it, the bartender almost watched over her and kept checking on her the entire time she was there alone since I couldn't be there with her. He kept asking if anyone was bothering her and made her feel very welcomed which doesn't happen too often especially in a big city. We are extremely grateful that the staff was so friendly and we would all recommend this place to anyone wanting to have a good night out.", "author": "Josh W."}

We were starving and we were bummed at first when the waiter/bartender said there were only oysters, fries, and charcuterie to eat. We ordered all of the above to share and it was all delicious and filled us up! 1/2 dozen of a variety of oysters, 3 item board (calabrese, buzzed cheese, and broccolini), and fries. The cheese had an espresso/lavender rind and was amazing. Presentation for everything was very good. The waiter was very nice and explained our food each time and was super patient. When we ordered the Cobra Kai cocktail to taste/share he even put it in 2 glasses for us. That was also very well made and delicious with a lemon twist in it. The oysters were incredibly fresh (one of the freshest I've tasted in the city thus far). The price is higher than many other gastropubs/bars nearby but truly well worth it! I would definitely come back for the food and good service!", "author": "m s."}
