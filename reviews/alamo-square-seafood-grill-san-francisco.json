I'm an antsy person. This was far from ideal. \n\nQuick rant: It took one hour for bread to come out after asking multiple times. Note that it takes an hour to fly to Vegas from SF, and they couldn't cut 3 measly pieces of bread in this time. We received no refills on water until the very end of our meal, after asking multiple times. It took two hours for our main dish to come out. Some people are able to run an entire marathon in the time it took this salmon to come out. It took 30 minutes just to pay the bill...okay, really? That's the easy part!\n\nThe waitress saw that we were annoyed and gave us free dessert, which would have been great except for the fact that we already had free dessert coupons. She didn't make us use the coupons so that we could have dessert again next time. I thought this was a pretty cheesy way of dealing with really grumpy customers who just spent HOURS waiting for food. She also gave us a free pour of really terrible tasting wine (Super metallic. I had one sip and couldn't drink it), but at least she tried? NOTE: The waitress was really nice, and this was not fully her fault. The restaurant was SEVERELY understaffed and she was basically the only one waiting all the tables. \n\nThe crazy part is that I might even give this place a second try. Every dish that *eventually* came out was delicious. The salmon was huge and well-seasoned, the rice was cooked nicely, the vegetables were flavorful and soft. Our wine (not the free pour) was decent, the Celery Potato soup was really flavorful, and the pesto & olive oil dip that came with the bread was tasty. As for dessert, the tiramisu was a massive, creamy piece of deliciousness. The cream puffs were pretty dang good too. \n\nIf the service wasn't so damn slow, this would have easily been a 4 or 5 star review.", "author": "Heather R."}

Have come here off and on over the years...not bc it's bad, but bc it's a bit out of my usual dining out neighborhoods. \n\nLet's just start with service. Susie (sp?) is the best! If I could give ten stars for service alone, I would! She moves from table to table, being equally attentive and efficient. We were mesmerized by her genuine friendliness...honestly, top notch. \n\nFood was perfection. And for the price they charge?! Nothing short of amazing. Their pre fixe menu is $16.50 for a three-course! In SF, that's outrageously cheap. So kudos to them for keeping their prices wallet-friendly over the yrs. The buds and I started with the mussels and fries. OMG, get this. The mussels were plump and the fries were perfectly crispy. For entrees, we tried the blackened shrimp risotto, blackened salmon with parsley butter, and the grilled sole with tomato sauce. We also went double veggies on the fish dishes. I'm not crazy about cooked carrots and saut\u00e9ed zucchini's, but that's a personal preference. Otherwise, all of the seafood dishes hit the spot! \n\nIn the end, Susie didn't even ask us to check-in for the free dessert (even though we did) - a quick wink and a \"I gotchu\" was all it took.

Yay always a great deal! Wrong. \n\nBut we'll start off with the good. We were seated in this cute corner with lots of pillows and windows, making it feel more private and secluded a bit from the other tables. The service was better than expected (from the reviews I read) however I did have to ask for menus. They poured our BYO wine right away. We weren't sure what we wanted so the man who seemed to be either the owner or lead waiter made suggestions. We both got blackened salmon, mine with the parsley garlic butter and his with the green peppercorn sauce. \n\nThe food was great, took no time at all to come out and was delicious. Was the perfect size (not too big or small) for the price it was. Oh and the pesto and bread it the beginning was amazing. Honestly probably my favorite part. \n\nThe meal came to a close and I inquired about the free dessert check in on Yelp but the man said you can't combine offers (free dessert + free corkage = no no). I thought that was fair and said no worries. \n\nThen the check came and there's a $20 corkage fee. I asked the lady now helping us and she said you have to buy two entrees PER PERSON. I reread the menu now realizing what it said though not terribly clear. Also how is that any sort of a deal and regardless, $20 corkage fee?!? If that's the going rate for twisting open a bottle then hot damn I need to revisit my career choices. \n\nMy boyfriend who is much more grounded than I in these situations said not to worry about, we misunderstood, etc. but to me this guy who had been serving us the entire time had to of known we weren't \"following the rules\" of the corkage fee and could have said something and/or could have given us the check in offer. \n\nAnd for that I was irritated and do not like the way business is being run here.", "author": "Kelly G."}

It used to be pretty good and reasonable, but things have changed.  The food was just OK.  The calamari was average but not very flavorful.  The fish was tasty, however, the bearnaise sauce I got with it was served in a ramekin and was the consistency of pudding, not a sauce, and was at room temperature.  Clearly this sauce was made earlier and left sitting where it congealed.  Scary part is we were the first customers in so I assume that sauce was leftover from the night before.  The rice and veggies that came with the fish were completely bland and I barely touched them.\n  \nMy biggest gripe is the wine list.  The cheapest bottle of wine they have is $42!!  This is a hole in the wall neighborhood bistro/grill, not a high end restaurant like Bix or Boulevard that can get away with those prices.  It's just obnoxious and smacks of laziness on the owners part.  This is northern California for pity's sake and you're telling me you can't find a decent bottle of wine to serve to your clients under $42?  Most decent restaurants will have one or two bottles around $28 then a few in the $30's, but to have none is just plain ridiculous.   We did notice they advertise half prices on all bottles and glasses of wine on two nights during the week.  So basically you get priced gouged on wine unless you come on those days.  That's not how you get people to come back to your establishment.  \n\nWhen I asked for salt I was brought a salt grinder that look like it came from the bargain bin at Safeway.  It was one of those cheap clear plastic grinders you can't re-fill with labels all over it.  So your cheapest bottle of wine is $42 but you can't afford a simple salt shaker for your clients?    \n\nWe were so ready to go and decided to get dessert at Gold Mirror with some reasonably priced port.  \n\nAs we were paying our waitress asks \"Can I ask you a personal question?\"  Not something I want to hear from anyone unless I know them well, but being polite we said sure.  \n\nThen she asks \"Am I fat?\"\n\nApparently one of the cooks told her she looked fat.  We told her she wasn't and left.  \n\nWhat a very bizarre meal.", "author": "Sean M."}

Not a giant portion size but that's ok - didn't need any more. Highly recommend. My friend got the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and said it was the best she has had. \n\nWe all left full and happy. I'll definitely go back! I would order the exact meal and substitute something for the rice. Oh! And the Malbec was quite good too! I wouldn't go if you're in a hurry, as it was a sit and chat and take your time pace of service - but this was perfect for us. Thank you!", "author": "A P."}

It is a small, quaint neighborhood restaurant in Alamo Square. We sat next to the window and the booths along the wall have cushions and cute little pillows to make you feel nice and cozy. \n\nThe menu is small but every dish looked incredible. Quality over quantity! The menu features American dishes with some French influence. And the majority of the menu are seafood dishes. There is also a large board on the wall which features some of their specials. Wine list was small but again, we had no problem with that because the wines were very good. We started with the crab cakes which were lightly crisp on the outside, moist on the inside. Great flavor! It came with a side salad, cucumbers, tomatoes, and their garlic herb aioli for dipping. Everything tasted fresh and full of flavor which really set the expectation for our entrees. I ordered the shrip & spinach risotto special and absolutely loved it! The shrimp had cajun seasoning on it (I think?) but wasn't too spicy. And the risotto was hearty and creamy. The ambiance combined with the food at this restaurant really gives you that homemade, comfort kind of feel. \n\nTo sum it up, our cute little girls dinner turned into about 4 hours of pure enjoyment at this restaurant! We had a lot of wine, devoured all of our food, and one of the true highlights was Andre! He took such great care of us the entire time and was so friendly and fun to talk to. We ended up closing down the restaurant and he didn't mind at all! He even poured us some dessert wines at the end of the evening. The girls and I loved this place so much.

The restaurant is tiny, hidden neighborhood gem that is cozy and I did not feel rushed during my time there. I was properly seated by the tall ma\u00eetre d or owner of restaurant. He checked in with me to see if everything was ok and I said I was waiting for my friend who was running late on the bus. He was ok with that. So finally my friend arrived and we both decided to go with the Fixed price menu that included the salad or soup, main entree of chef choosing and dessert.  Since this was a French restaurant we had to order the Escargot with garlic and butter for $8.00.  So our fresh yummy French bread (wish I had more!) came to our table first and it was so soft and tasty with the pesto sauce for dipping bread in. The salad arrived and it was quite tasty and good flavoring. Finally the main course arrived and it was the sole fish with White sauce. My friend's dish was a tad bigger than my fish as you can see from my photos. But that is okay, as I am on a diet. LOL We both enjoyed the dish and the sides. \nLast but not least was the French's Floating Island with sweet carmel sauce with strawberry! So much calories, but so good! \n\nYummy in our tummies for all the excellent dishes. I ranked this place A. This French place does it right. If you have a budget, the fixed price is excellent way to go. Other items off the menu reads quite tasty and I would love to come back and order those!  Cheers to me dreaming of another visit back! \n\nTransportation is easy to get to with all the bus lines running nearby along Alamo square with the Painted Ladies houses.

I needed to get away from the Opera crowds and find a quiet local place. Alamo totally fit the bill for that. Quaint and low key as others have mentioned the service is uneven. I was asked to move three times before they settled on my table for one.  The menu was about what I expected--pretty standard fare. \n\nA break basket was served with my wine and came with an interesting pesto olive oil dipping sauce. I ordered the crab cakes appetizer which arrived promptly and were nicely plated. However, they seemed too perfectly shaped to be hand patted and were stock full of filling. Maybe I'm spoilt by crab shacks on the Chesapeake bay. \n\nFor the entree I chose one of the fishes of the day, snapper, grilled with the green peppercorn sauce which was actually kind of purple. The fish was a little dry, and I liked that they put the sauce on the side instead of smothering it. I enjoyed the fish and sauce as well as the excellent grilled vegetables. I skipped on the plain white rice. \n\nFor dessert I had the profiteroles which were crisp and fresh. In this case, they did smother them in too much chocolate sauce. Less would have been more here. I paired that with a tawny port. \n\nOverall a nice meal and atmosphere, but the spotty service (I ordered a second glass of wine that.

No explanation. No apologies. She acted as if she was doing us a favor even getting us in, even though we had reservations. When we got there we waited at the entrance, you know as you do at every other restaurant in the world. I smiled and made eye contact with the host, and she gestured us over to her, on the other side of the dining room, presumably because it was inconvienent for her to walk over to greet us. I was going to say that it felt like I was at the bank, but the tellers there actually smile and say hello, etc.\n\nThe host was also our server, brought wine, presented it to me, but didn't wait for me to taste it before filling everyone else's glass. The second bottle was left on the table by our other server, unopened. As she walked away she said \"it's a screw top so you can open it yourself when you're ready\" (my glass was empty on the table). Of course everything else was slow, wine was pour exactly once, and water service nonexistent. They are obviously understaffed by design so I get it--I would do the minimum too if there were only 1.5 people covering the entire dining room. My main issue is with the attitude. You can be busy and short staffed while still making people feel like you want them to be there.\n\nIf all this sounds petty to you, consider that there are literally thousands of restaurants in the city that ARE glad to have you as customers and won't treat you as an imposition.

Tartare was the best thing of the night- seasoned simply with soy and sesame oil- although the greens underneath became inedibly salty from the excessive amount of dressing. Calamari was OK- flour breading was light but falling off the squid. Seafood stew was clearly all the odd bits that weren't getting ordered a la carte. Seemed a bit odd to have that many types of fish in one bowl (salmon & tuna especially). The entire dish was not very appetizing and didn't pop with any vibrant, fresh flavor.

I really don't know how they manage to serve such good quality and portions of fish for the same price most places sell a bowl of pasta.\n\nService:\nThis is where this place really shines. Our waitress Suzzie (I hope I spelled it right) was really friendly, handled all of our needs promptly, and kept our water glasses full the entire night. When my mother's fish was not as well done as she would have liked, Suzzie immediately took it back to fix it. Even after cooking it some more, my mom was clearly not happy, but didn't say anything. Suzzie picked up on this, and tried to make it right. When my mom wouldn't let her take it away, Suzzie brought over an extra glass of wine, and later a desert, to help turn that negative experience around. This kind of attentiveness is hard to find, and really takes the dining experience to the next level.\n\nFood:\nI had Grilled Atlantic Salmon with Beurre Maitre d'Hotel (garlicky butter). The fish was a generous portion (I'd guess 6oz) and came with some tasty rice and veggies on the side. The Beurre Maitre d'Hotel was a little mild for my tastes, but I grew up in a house where garlic was the spice of choice, so it takes a lot of garlic for me to taste it any more. I split the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Blueberry Crisp for desert with my family, and it was gone in less than a minute.

From the friendly, relaxed paced service to the homemade, high quality taste of the food, my thoughts were drawn back to my time in the south of France. The days spent in the hills or bicycling along the beach, and the evenings with wine and friends in quaint little restaurants like this. \n\nIt's a rare find. In a city with many choices for fine dining French cuisine, seldom does one stumble upon a restaurant that truly captures not only the flavor, but also the atmosphere of authentic French dining.\n\nBravo", "author": "Ryan B."}

One of my good friend was in town tonight and we decided to go celebrate his birthday there. I had made reservation tonight on OPENTABLE for 7:30pm for 3 people.  We arrived early around 7:15pm.  I enter the restaurant and told I believe a \"French, Tall, Skinny frame...Collar shirt and jeans guy\" that we are early but if there's no table yet...We will wait but letting you know that we are here.  He was absolutely extremely RUDE and said \"Not yet...GO WAIT outside\".\n\n7:30 came and still no table or anyone giving us any update.   We waited outside with another couple.\n\n7:42 pm - The French guy I'm assuming that he's the owner...came out with 2 glasses and a bottle of White Wine...Went over to the couple that is waiting outside and offer a glass of wine to both of them.  He walk back into the restaurant after pouring them each a glass of wine and did not acknowledge us or give us updates about our table.\n\n7:52 pm - Finally, he come out with both hands up in the air and said \"OOOOOKAAAY\"  Table is ready...no apology!!!  Seated us and we were promptly served water.\n\n8:04 pm - Again, The French guy comes over and start taking our order...Not half way taking our order he put his order pad down...said \"Sorry...I need to go say good bye...to a party of 6 that was leaving\"  He goes out side for more than 5 mins...start taking selfie with them.\n\n8:10 pm - My friends and I decided to leave the restaurant...On our way out, we told him that we are not going to dine here...and his respond was \"OK\".\n\nThis is one of the worst experience for me and my friends tonight at this place.  It's so sad that this restaurant has high hope but definitely lack customer service.  Visiting the ALAMO SQUARE SEAFOOD GRILL was certainly an experience to remember, but one that I never hope to repeat and would not wish upon anyone else. If you are tempted to try this restaurant for seafood...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE LIKE TADICH GRILL OR WATER BAR.\n\nTo the french guy...You absolutely need to learn about manner and excellent customer service. You are so rude and disrespectful!!!  I hope that this review will help others when selecting restaurants to eat in SF.  I will spread the words to people that I know and let them know not to come to your restaurant!!!", "author": "Perapol D."}

So, when I needed a good spot to celebrate an important night with my fianc\u00e9, it seemed like a good option, and we made a reservation a week ahead. When we arrived, the place was busy and the table wasn't ready. This wouldn't have been a problem by itself. We happily went outside to the bench to wait. A few minutes later, another couple finished up and vacated their table. We waited another 10 minutes while the table was left unbussed and no one made an effort to prepare it for us. About 15 minutes after our reservation time, I went back in to check on things. The woman working the front of the house got in my face, saying \"I told you to wait outside!\" and got angry at me for checking on the table. We left at that point at had a delightful dinner at the Boxing Room instead. \n\nI will never return to this place.", "author": "Bennet M."}

I left with a very satisfied belly. The price is also quite reasonable for what you get. \n\nHowever the service is totally uninviting. The servers need to learn how to smile. My wife and I both value politeness and we use all of our please and thank-yous whenever dining and try our best to be respectful to waitstaff because we understand it is hard work, but it would be nice to have some politeness returned! We were sat in the corner and we saw bread being delivered to all the tables, but no bread to us for some unexplained reason. When our order was taken the server didn't write anything down, so of course the long wait for our appetizer was exceedingly long because the server forgot the appetizer we ordered. Her response was, \"oh, you wanted escargot\" with no apologies. The appetizer was delivered after the meal was complete and to add insult to injury it was first delivered to the neighboring table by mistake. \n\nIt is disappointing that the service was so bad because the food was really good.", "author": "Anthony S."}

I have always enjoyed dinners at this restaurant until  I encountered the server Naomi. I have no idea why she seemed to go out of her way to be rude but it really was horrible.  Naomi asked my mom who is 86 and myself to wait to be seated even though we got there early and only two tables were occupied.  My mom was holding onto me as she is frail and we did not want to bring her walker in with us as space it tight.  Naomi ignored us leaving us standing.  My mom could not wait any longer so I  took  her to the corner table close to the bathroom where we like to  sit.   Again Naomi ignored us except to give us an angry look.  My sister joined us at which point Naomi approaches the table and says \" you can't sit here   We asked why.   I explained my mom needs to be near the bathroom and this was our favorite table.  Naomi said \"this is a table for four and you are only 3 people  you can't sit here\"  Her tone was harsh and hostile.  It was clear she did not want to help us and at that point that we would have to leave as she was the only server and her attitude was intolerable.  We went out for a nice and time left the restaurant feeling like dogs being kicked   \n     I left my name and number two days later to ask the owners to call.

I had floating island: it looks ridiculously huge but I had no problem finishing it - those egg whites are so light.\n\nThe two women who served us were both very thoughtful and approachable.

Yelp lead me to Alamo Square Seafood Grill, as we were looking for a casual, seafood restaurant to accommodate our party of 4. \n\nThe restaurant is just as others describe it. Really tiny but such a cozy nook nestled in the heart of Alamo Square. Tables are close together but somehow didn't feel too close to neighbors or that the volume was out of control. \n\nAlamo Square is known for their fish options which you can customize the type of fish, cooking method, and sauce. I opted for the snapper, blackened, with peppercorn sauce per the waiter's recommendation. Peppercorns are normally not something I would go for, but the combination was delicious and the sides (brussels and rice) were perfect accompaniments. There was a mix-up with our friend's entree which meant he waited a few extra minutes. It was no biggie but they brought us a free (and delicious) creme brulee to make up for it.\n\nThis is exactly the type of restaurant and experience I crave, we will be back!", "author": "Brianna M."}

No \"i'm coming\" \"i'm sorry this is taking longer than expected\" \"I'll be with you soon\" looks or acknowledgement of any kind.\n\n2. we ordered the escargot and the muscles to start. The escargot has absolutely no flavor - way under salted and just not tasty at all. The muscles were way past their prime. I can still taste the minerally \"off\" flavor in my mouth as I type this out. After 2 muscles each my husband and i decided not to have any more and when the waitress (ages later) collected our dishes asked if everything was ok ; my husband said \"the muscles were a bit off\" and she replied (laughing) \"yes i can see, I can see\".... WTF?\n\n3. I ordered the baramandi grilled with the Beurre Blanc sauce. After i ordered it i had a thought and a worry that i probably should have asked for the sauce on the side. And thank god i didn't ask that as i would have had a cup of NOTHING on the side. The fish was as tasteless as ... well you get my drift. Horrible, how do you stuff grilled fish up (terrible quality is how!!!!).\n\nEvery time we drove past this place i felt bad that we hadn't tried it yet as it looked like a potential \"hidden secret\" or cute local that i could get to quite easily.

The food is definitely fish-forward and serving up some mean simple foods.  The darkly lit room is flooded with artwork amongst the tiny tables squeezing in it's patrons. The window view is lined with lit-up trees begging for rainy weather, strangely reminiscent of a different city... dare I say Chicago?  \n\nPrix-fixe menu is the way to go for both price and options. The potato-leek soup was stellar. Super simplistic in it's taste and presentation with floating croutons resting on top, but none-the-less amazing.  My company paid a little extra to substitute the Trout Salad and it was also fantastic.  Some say a bit \"luke-warm\", but I thought it was a perfect balance or cold greens mixed with a cozy bed of fish laid on top. The cut potatoes and red onions added a bit of character to this dish.  The entree was more blackened trout swimming in a peppercorn sauce and grilled vegetables afloat. Although the seasoning on the veggies were a bit bland the fish made up for it with it's overly-salted bite.  Obviously the best was saved for last with the Apple-Bread pudding coming in to cleanse our palate. Fresh strawberries lined the plate as our taste buds danced around each bite.\n\nI want to give this space 4 stars but feel as if some fine-tuning could be had.  A very positive 3.5 stars for me.

Suzi was our server and she was wonderful. From the moment we entered she was attentive and helpful. Here suggestions were spot on.  My seafood pasta was one of the many daily specials and it was certainly special. The blue cheese sauce was what caught my attention and the dish certainly met my expectations. The quantity and quality of the seafood was exceptional.  The only change I would make would be to use a different noodle than spaghetti (to avoid splashing the sauce). With the exception of Creme Brule, the desert list seldom temps me, but there were several items that called out tonight.  In the end, the table shared a Creme Brule and a blueberry crisp.

True, they specialize in fish, but it felt much more like a cozy, French brasserie than a grill, and I'd hate to think folks are judging it as a boring American resto when it's actually quite a gem. So there, assumptions dispelled.\n\nWednesday is free corkage night, a popular event in the neighborhood. I made a reservation just to be safe, and we were seated immediately, before the BYO crowds arrived around 7. The menu is small and simple, and predominantly French, aside from the excess of fish. They offer 5 catches per day, and there are about 5 different ways you can have it prepared - grilled, sauteed, poached, blackened, or \"buerre\" (buttered!), making it a very customizable experience. \n\nWe started with the lump crab cakes, which had great flavor but were a strange grey-ish color. We noticed the oddity, but kept eating assuming there must be a gourmet explanation for it. Then, the Mahi Mahi prepared Provential style (with tomatoes, capers, olives). It was a good, simple dish...cooked well but could have used more sauce. We ended with the famous profiteroles, a dessert I'm no stranger to. Anything drenched in thick chocolate sauce and stuffed with ice cream is going to elicit some happiness, but I must say the pastry puffs themselves seemed extra-crusty...too crusty to be fresh. \n\nI enjoyed the whole vibe of the place: dark and intimate with lively servers. Some guy who appeared to be the manager spoke French the whole night, probably to up the charm-factor. I decided not to blow my cover by letting him know I speak/understand enough French to pick up on snarky comments. At one point he poured us some water and commented \"Ce n'est pas trop cher\" (it's not too expensive), which made me think he was either just being clever, OR was hinting that we were cheap-a$$es (we shared an app, entree and dessert - we didn't have gigantic French appetites that night).

I thought it was odd to stand there intentionally unnoticed (not even simple greeting). Doesn't everyone say \"I'll be right with you\", or something like this, these days?\nAfter a while, ok, we got seated.\n\nFirstly, I could tell from their looks and faces that the 2 waitresses seemed so indifferent or they didn't want more customers. Maybe they are short staffed to serve that many people at the same time or just stressed out?\n\nSecondly, considering the tiny place, there were just so many tables. You sit more closely to the strangers next tables than your company in front of you. You hear every single word people say on either side of you. They hear every single word you say. It was very uncomfortable. \n\nNext, noise level was high. If you'd prefer having a relaxing quiet dinner, it's not a place for you. \n\nWe saw someone was not happy with the food so we thought something was going on.\nAt this point, we started thinking of leaving this place and going somewhere else. \nAfter a while (again!) someone came to the table to take orders but we could easily see that there were already so many people yet to be served, and we were not sure how long the wait would be until we get our food. We saw enough already and didn't want to ruin my birthday dinner, so we decided to leave.\n\nIt was unfortunate that we could not even have a chance to try their food but honestly it was quite shocking to see this kind of restaurant still exists.

I chose the only two-top not right by the door, but it needed cleaned off so she asked for a minute - no problem.  Another several minutes standing there, and I finally took one I didn't want as I figured that would be faster given how few staff there seemed to be and how slowly things were going.  Once my friend arrived, she brought menus and raced through the fish choices almost faster than we could even hear them, and left us to decide.  Came back to take our order, pretty distracted, and as we started ordering starters she asked for a minute and left us....several minutes of waiting later, put a sign on the door, came back to us to resume our order and oh, by the way, our credit card isn't working tonight so we're cash only.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-01-04", "description": "The two stars are for the food, and that is because the food itself was very good. It was the rest of the experience that was (sadly) dreadful. I brought my elderly mom here, who was visiting from outside the country for the Christmas holiday. She visits each year and I always make it a point to fit in one nice, special dinner out with her. I have a young toddler at home and work full time (both professionally and as a mom), so getting out to enjoy a nice, peaceful meal, is these days an event for me too. Something I look forward to. It is also a chance to do something nice for my own mom. \nSo, we researched several restaurants before deciding upon this one due to it's location, it's seafood menu, and it didn't appear too trendy or pretentious... perfect!\nWe were greeted by (who I now determine is) the owner, and were seated promptly - good start. It was a Wednesday, with a waived corkage fee so that was nice, and we brought along a couple bottles of wine to enjoy with dinner.\nOnce seated, the service went totally downhill. Our waitress, after taking our order, basically ignored us (or forgot we were there?). We did order a calamari appetizer, and that arrived rather promptly, so that was nice. But then, we actually sat and watched as our fellow diners arrived, ordered, got their food and paid/left, and we still had not gotten our entrees. That might be fine with a single table, but this trend surrounded us. And it started to feel like we were being actively ignored. It was strange. I've worked in the service industry, and if you screw something up, or have some sort of delay, just tell the table, apologize, maybe give a smile... we got none of that. At one point, my mom and I gestured to the first person who sort of made eye contact with us, the owner, I believe... my mom then started to ask for clarification about who our waitperson was, and I think this just made him impatient. So, I just jumped in and said, 'could we just get some more lemon and water?' and he left, presumably to help us out there. We eventually got the lemon (for our now cold, rubbery calamari - it was tasty at first- we just wanted a bit more lemon!), but no water refill, until later when I asked someone else for water refills. So, at one point, my mom, sort of waived her hands (a little animatedly, I'll admit), as she'd lost patience waiting for our entrees. It was an expeditor (or bus person- not sure) who came over, and asked us to repeat what we'd ordered and that she'd go check on it for us. It was not long after that that our entrees were delivered, not by our waitress, by the person who asked us to confirm what we'd ordered. We liked the menu so much that we'd ordered 3 entrees- scallops with a risotto, poached trout and the sole in a buerre blanc sauce. All of them were really good. Well prepared, nicely portioned, just lovely. But nobody came to ask how we were doing, we ran out of water again, but screw it, just let that go... we had to ask for the bill (no offer of dessert, as other tables received). \nMy mom lives in Mexico and dines out often with a girlfriend of hers, She says that she believes two women dining together (or a group of women) get treated like second class citizens just because they are women, and/or because there is some supposition that they will not tip well. I cannot say I agree with this, but given my mom's 70+ years on the planet, and the experience the other night, I'm giving that theory some further consideration. And that's depressing. I tip well (especially well for good or exemplary service), and I always tip baristas, the folks ringing my food up at downtown lunch counters... And so do the other women I know, so there - got that off my chest.\nNow, here's the final, and really most bizarre, thing that happened that night at this place. We'd already exited the restaurant, and we see this man leap outside the door and scream 'BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!'. It startled my mother, who almost lost her footing and fell. It was the owner. He deemed it necessary to sarcastically scream goodbye to us. It was not a friendly gesture, make no mistake - it was hostile and obnoxious. And after that, I just felt f**king perplexed and angry. What a low life thing to do. I can only imagine that he perceived us to be high maintenance (this is a total guess, since I'm not a mind reader and don't really care), but at what point is us advocating for ourselves to find out where our food is and ask for water because we were thirsty, cause to treat us with such hostility? We went into the experience in good spirits, we are both kind people, not entitled, but we were forced to advocate for ourselves to get anything at all to happen for our table. And quite simply, we were paying customers. Terrible way to treat one's customers. Obviously will never go back, and proactively dissuade my friends and colleagues from doing so.", "author": "Kristen R."}

Walked in and saw there was a table available (two small tables pushed together) in the corner, but was told by a waitress that she wasn't exactly sure when she could seat us, and that we couldn't be seated and that the table was for a party of 4. She also explained that there were parties who'd been sitting and talking for 20+ mins. after eating and paying, to which I suggested she kindly tell them that a party with a reservation is waiting to be seated (she refused). Then I reiterated that we had a 9 PM reservation because we were in a hurry and had an event at 10 PM, to which she said, \"Then maybe you should've made a reservation for 8:30 PM.\" (So, needless to say, she was terribly rude). I wanted to leave and find another place to eat, but doing so after 9 PM in San Francisco when you have a show coming up is practically impossible.\n\nMy friend and I finally got seated after 9 PM (they took my suggestion of separating the two free small tables, but not before denying us that table). We ordered the grilled rib eye, medium rare. Worst steak I've ever had. I've never had a steak with so much fat on it, and the pommes frites were soaked in oil. I should've stuck to my gut - any steak in this city below $20 is probably a bad steak. In addition, every time the waitress needed to get past my friend, she would use her hip to push past his elbow several times, without even saying \"excuse me.\"\n\nGiven how bad the food was, and how rude the waitress was, I left no tip (my friend left a decent tip - he arrived right after the argument with the waitress). We were on our way to our show when the waitress used my number from my reservation to call and complain that I left no tip and tried to explain that they did their best to accommodate my friend and me. When I attempted to speak on the phone, she interrupted me and talked over me during the entire call. The fact that she even called my number crossed the line, because it's obvious that she wouldn't have called me if I had left a tip. Never going there again, needless to say.", "author": "Uche I."}

It's good value if you're looking for a bargain.    They have the Fix-Prix menu for only 14.95 and you get a salad,  salmon with some carrots and a little rice and the white part of a lemon meringue pie.  They call that a dessert.     Do you enjoy just the white part of a lemon Meringue pie?   We also had the crab cake.   It lacked the texture a good crab cake should have.   \nThe salad was not that fresh.  It's like the mixed greens you have in  the fridge after it's been in there a week or two.   The salmon was actually decent.   I ate all of it.   \n\nI don't think I'll return.", "author": "Doris A."}

We arrived on time for our 7 pm OpenTable reservation on Aug 28 but had to wait because the only table they set aside for us was a table right in the doorway. She had us wait outside. A table in the window was vacated within a few minutes but it wasn't cleared for 10 minutes. It was 15 minutes past our reservation timeslot, so my partner walked inside and asked the server if he could clear the table so we could be seated (it was a little chilly outside). The woman working front-of-house got in my partner's face and angrily said the server was doing his job and said, \"I told you to wait outside.\" I went inside after the incident to tell her we were going elsewhere for dinner due to her rudeness, and she got defensive and started justifying her behavior because the restaurant was \"so busy.\" Seriously? I can accept needing to wait 10 minutes for a table, but treating us rudely and then defending that behavior is absolutely unacceptable. That woman needs to keep her anger and self-righteousness in check. It was the worst service and treatment we had ever received in a restaurant. We definitely won't be going back. Don't waste your time and money. There are plenty of other better places to eat in the city.

The fish entrees were very nice but most of the other dishes were \"meh\".  And while the service we friendly our waitress seemed totally lost.  See more below: \n\nPROS:\n* We all ordered fish (Snapper or Trout) in different preparations.  The fish was fresh, flavorful and well prepared.   \n* The staff are universally friendly and welcoming \n* They are not aggressive turning the tables - we weren't rushed to leave (although we did eventually have trouble getting someone's attention to get the check). \n\nCONS:\n* SALAD - One of us ordered a salad without dressing but all the salads came undressed.  When we asked the waitress she insisted they were dressed and we had a little debate as we took bites and tried to detect flavor.  Eventually we asked for a little dressing on the side and she brought out (literally) about a tablespoon of dressing for two people to share.  \n* APPETIZERS: We had the crab cakes and shrimp ceviche to start.  The ceviche isn't really ceviche (its more like cooked shrimp with avocado and spices) but it was good.  The crab cakes were super disappointing - they were undercooked and and the crab got a little lost in the filler.\n* DESSERT: One of us had the prix fixe which came with dessert.  There was no choice - you got \"Floating Island\" (meringue on a puddle of custard) with the Prix Fixe.  It was strangely flavorless - not worth the calories. \n\nSERVICE: \nThe service was just weird.  We were seated by a classy professional waiter who helped us pick a nice bottle of wine and took our orders.  Then he was gone. From then on we had this very sweet waitress who seemed utterly lost.  First we had the salad debate with her.  Then when the entrees came she had no idea who ordered what OR what the dishes in her hand were (we helped her guess).  When dessert time came she pulled out a crumpled sheet of paper and read aloud.  When we reminded her that one of us had the prix fixe she said \"oh!\" and walked away.  We assumed (correctly) that meant no dessert choice. She didn't ask if anyone else wanted anything.  \n\nNet-net - not awful but we regretted our choice and see no reason to go back.", "author": "David K."}

A day-boat scallop is the thing to have.  This is what I have experienced.  The day-boat scallop is something they catch that day, super early, out on the boat, then they bring it in and cook it in the place that night.  It has to be from that very morning.

In the meantime, 2 other groups were also being made to wait, also with reservations.\n\nDespite not having any hiccups this time, total meal time came to two hours and 15 minutes with dessert. This is just far too slow, even as patient and laid back as we are. Other groups were clearly less pleased. Despite noting during the reservation that it was my wife's birthday, not one word of this was noted by the server.\nThe kicker was for the table next to us, the food was brought out (for 3/4 of them, there was a screw up with the 4th) and were told \"Bon Appetite\", but the server had to be called back to be scolded that they had no silverware.\n\nWe get a cold, impersonal vibe from the server both times, and while the busser is warmer, she has a thick accent making it really hard to understand what she's saying. Neither ever come by to ask how things are.\n\nI want to like this place because the food is good and the intimate atmosphere is nice. But the service is just poor. Or maybe they are undermanned and need a third person. Either way it's really a shame about the service.", "author": "H M."}

Their soup is really worth getting -- really fresh and made with fragrant herbs. Their bread and the spicy pesto dip that comes with it is so tempting.

ASSG got us out of our respective neighborhoods to try something new and we were not disappointed!\n\nAlamo Square is quaint, casual and had one of the best seafood stews I have had. It was chock full of mussels, salmon, trout and scallops in a full flavored tomato based broth. \n\nMiss B had the chicken which looked equally tasty and if I wasn't trying to watch my love handles I would have asked for a third round of bread! The bread was fresh and the herb dipping oil was amazing with a little spicy kick.\n\nTo top it off, the waiter brought my birthday creme brulee with a candle and called me darlin' which made me smile (the creme brulee? delicious as well).\n\nThey had a decent selection of wine and with the specials they have of half bottles on Mondays and no corkage on Wednesdays this place is a steal! Plus a Prix Fixe menu for $15!\n\nI didn't find the service to be negative in the least! It was a little slow but then again, our waiter was great and didn't hover like at some places and would glance over to make sure we were ok,. He promptly brought our check when he noticed we were done with our meal.

Having been to the restaurant before, my parents had nothing but good things to say: cute place, quiet, good food, etc.  As a frequent restaurant goer, I was excited to try this place. Sooooo disappointing. \n\nThe service was absolutely terrible. First, they forgot to bring us an appetizer we ordered, and then said we didn't order it (how about, \"I'm sorry\"?!).  We were having a nice time being out as a family, so this was not too big of a deal. Time for the main courses.  Tick tock, tick tock (getting hungrier), more time passes (getting grumpy), another 5 minutes (getting pissed). During this 30 minutes of post (partial) appetizer eating, no one came to the table to explain what was going on and/or apologize. More water? Ha, good luck. When we arrived there were three tables occupied, so it wasn't like they were too busy.  Finally, the meals arrive. Well, 3 of the 4 meals. \"we forgot to order one of your entrees, we'll get it out in a few minutes\" (no apology).  Another 20+ minutes passes and everyone is finished with their meal when entree #4 arrives. Ridiculous. \n\nSometimes places have a bad night, which I understand. What boggles my mind is how you can be so unapologetic and nonchalant about the diners' experience.  We asked to speak with the owner, who came over and says \"there was a human error, that's all I can say.\"  when asked why he hasn't come over to apologize during the wait time, he says \"I did not want to step on the toes of my server\". You've got to be freaking kidding me. \"I can offer you a free dessert\". Seriously? Safe to say I will never return.  There are many great restaurants in SF, and there is no need to waste an evening at a place that has such a lack of interest in service.", "author": "Bob D."}

We made reservations for 7:15 and being as it was a busy Friday weren't seated until close to 7:30. Giving them the benefit of the doubt we settled into our cozy table. The seating is VERY close together and inside is very loud. We even found ourselves having to repeat because the table next to us was talking so loud. Again, it was a Friday and the restaurant is small, understandable. Our waitress was slightly rude and very frazzled, she took our order, then proceeded to come back 4 times with the wrong appetizer, after waiting for 35m we finally asked the manager for our crab cake. Once it arrived it was VERY good, and one gentleman busing tables came by to apologize for the delay. By the time our food came out we had been there close to an hour. The food looked as if it were slopped on the plate, no detail or careful execution was added, and this was super discouraging, especially after waiting for so long. I ordered the Shrimp Risotto which was well seasoned, but looked like it was spilled in the kitchen and dripping all over the bowl.

We showed up at 7:30 for our reservation and the place was not crowded at all, maybe 5 other tables total in the restaurant. We sit down, and our server asked us what we wanted to drink, my boyfriend said \"I will have sparkling water.\" Then our guest and myself said, \"we will have some sparking water too.\" The waitress comes back with 3 HUGE bottles of Perrier ($7.00/each) and just sets it on the table. It looked ridiculous, why would we order 3 huge bottles of $7 water each? She takes back 2 of the waters and then comes back to take our app order and wine order. My boyfriend ordered a bottle of Chard wine...the waitress came out, poured us the smallest glass of wine I have ever seen (like a tasting portion), then left the table and the wine bottle was gone! When she came back, my boyfriend asked her where our bottle of wine went and she said \"I am so out of it tonight, I don't know where it went.\" She went back to look for it and it was I believe in the fridge...who knows if it was poured for another customer? Then our apps come out (calamari and crab cakes), and the waitress just slams the calamari down on top of one of the share plates and leaves quickly (my I add that our table has not been cleared yet, from the bread basket and dirty plates on the table from the bread). Then she drops off the crab cakes and sets it right down in front of me and leaves again.....the table is big enough to place the shared apps in the middle of the table so we can all enjoy it.... \n\nThe waitress also brought out tap water in the middle of the dinner and set it all in one spot in the corner of the table....still not removing the dirty dishes on the table. \n\n\nNow for the main course: Our two meals come out (we shared 2 fish dishes), and the waitress doesn't even bring us share plates...when I asked her for share plates, she said \"oh, you mean you want a clean plate?\" WHAT??????

Both recommendations came with rave reviews for the prix fixe menu, given a limited budget.  The prix fixe menu, available 5:30 until 7, comes with soup or salad, the chef's entree of the day, and the dessert of the day.\n\nMy boyfriend and I both ordered the prix fixe menu.  The bread came with an excellent dipping sauce, tasted like butter and garlic and parsley.  The bread was nothing special, but that was the only food item that wasn't amazing.  My salad was pretty normal and his zucchini curry soup was fantastic.  The entree, salmon with a Bearnaise sauce, was excellent.  Extremely fresh with a flavorful sauce.  Even the rice and steamed veggies were excellent!  Dessert was a \"floating island,\" or meringue in custard.  I had never had meringue quite like it but it was delicious.  Also, my boyfriend was able to enjoy a Krusovice, a Czech beer he hadn't been able to find since Prague, another factor that will be sure to ensure our return to this restaurant!\n\nThe restaurant also has a great ambiance.  Dimly lit and very romantic, everything is very nicely designed.  It's a small restaurant and the waitresses were friendly.  The food came quickly, but when the restaurant filled up service did slow down a bit.  Certainly not a bad place to have to wait a little while though!", "author": "Rachael M."}

First of all, after we checked in for our reservation, we waited about 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us--no menus, no water, no greeting, nothing.  We were thinking about leaving when finally someone approached us with the menus.  We asked for water.  Another 15 minutes passed before someone arrived to take our orders.  Still no water.  Finally, 10 minutes after we had placed our order, did someone bring water to our table.  So pretty much 40 minutes sitting at a table, without water.  We then waited another 20 minutes before our appetizer arrived, the escargot, with a belated explanation that this dish \"takes a while.\"  I don't understand why, I've ordered escargot many places and it has never taken that long.  The food itself was okay.  The escargot was tasty but due to the liberal amounts of butter and garlic.  The fish entrees were okay.

I had the crispy calamari to start, not bad, then the seared tuna with that herb and white whine sauce. Tuna perfectly cooked (barely cooked, like I like it) but it came out cold. I though maybe because it got very little heat, but no.  The rice and vegetables were also cold, which only proves my theory. And it was under seasoned. Also the food took forever to come like it was the Messiah.\n\nMy sister ordered the vegetable risotto. Risotto my ass! It was plain, mundane rice with some mushrooms and beans. Wasn't moist and cheesy like a risotto should be!\n\nFor dessert, the vanilla creme brulee. Second best part of the meal. Best part, you ask?

The food is exceptional and the prices incredibly reasonable for the type of food being served and the awesome ambiance.\n\nIf you order the fish (you should), you can choose from four preps: grilled, sauteed, blackened or poached; and five sauces: bernaise, buerre blanc, provencale, one that's just garlic and butter, and a peppercorn and red-wine reduction. Our fish was cooked perfectly, our waiter was awesome, and the dessert was ridiculous -- a chocolate ganache that made even this chocoholic put her fork down before the end.

The waiter, Ken, actually recognized us from over a year ago when we met him at this restaurant's sister location, Blue Jay Cafe. Not only that, he remembered our preference for fish entrees and made recommendations to us. This guy has an incredible memory, and he's very polite to boot. \nWe got the calamari which was served on a bed of salad. Unusual for me, but the combinations of flavors worked together very well. We were there before 7 p.m. So we got the fixed menu for each of us. On this particular night, it was a creamy potato and celery soup, seared rainbow trout for the entree, along with rice and vegetables on the side, and a light and fluffy \"Floating Island\" with strawberries for dessert.  For all of $15 for each of us, this is an insane deal. You definitely want to come early, as this deal is only available from opening to 7 p.m. \nThe only downside is that we'll probably not go to Blue Jay Cafe much anymore, as both restaurants are close together and this one comes out on top both for the food and Ken's warm and friendly service.\nWe were already discussing what we would try next time before we even got the bill.

The place was nearly empty on arrival and we were sat next to an older woman who was eating on her own.  It took a painfully long time to get water and drinks so we almost walked out but the waiter came over to apologize and took our order.  After that, we were basically stuck because it was then that a bimbo with long blonde hair walked in with her date and was greeted like a long-lost friend of not only the waiter but also the chef.  Not only were they immediately served but they had their entrees before we even got our appetizer which we had to ask about.\n\nThat explains while some reviewers experienced great service for their visit because they had one or more people in their party who was attractive enough to get the wait people or the chef to openly flirt with them while everyone else is brutally ignored.  During the long wait for everything, we struck up a conversation with the woman next to us who had already been there for over an hour and had just received her entr\u00e9e.  She said the food was good and probably worth the wait but my buddy chimed in that \"anger is the worst sauce\" which provided the only moment of humor during that painful experience.  After getting cold, mediocre entrees and watching the bimbo and date leave satiated and with sweet farewells from the staff, we basically had to wrestle for our check.  Leaving no tip was our only recourse for a very insulting experience that ruined our evening.  The arrogance of the owner and staff is just breathtaking.", "author": "Klek G."}

He assured us that he would be getting to us, which lead us to believe that he would be seating us. What he actually did was bark \"Are you ladies going to sit?\" After we have been standing for nearly 15 minutes. After he insisted that we chose to sit anywhere available, we chose to sit at a 2 seat table with another table closely nestled next to it. The waiter shot a look and inquired if we were expecting anyone else. After we had answered no, he grabbed the two napkins/utensils in irritation. Now, from the reviews and news paper clippings decorated in the front window, I honestly had the mind set that this rather pricey menu was starring a fine dining restaurant. The ambiance sure did trick me.\n\nAfter deciding what we had wanted, the waiter came along. She ordered calamari, I had ordered the saut\u00e9ed fish. Now, keep in mind that I''ve never been to this restaurant and since it was obviously famous for whatever reason, I asked him to make a suggestion on what to order. I asked him what was more of the restaurant's specialty and he literally barked at me over and over. \n\nrude waiter: \"what would you like?\"\nme: \"I don't know, what is more popular here? What is the special? I was thinking I would order the sauteed fish special.\"\nrude waiter \"which fish would you like?\"\nme: \"I'm not sure.. I'm not a picky eater and I don't know where to start here. I've never eaten here..what's the most popular? what do you prefer?\"\nrude waiter: \"what, kind of fish, would you like.\"\nfriend: \"okay, what kind of fishes do you serve?\"\n- I decide on the tuna.\nrude waiter: \"now how would you like it cooked?\"\nme: \"sauteed\" (LIKE I HAD MENTIONED THE FIRST TIME.)\n\nHe made no eye contact with me.\n\nMy friend swooped in, saving me from his rude-helpless-serving stuck-up attitude. My friend and I were appalled, we came in with the intention to enjoy a few drinks and an extravagant dinner and got krap service with mediocre food. Not only was that terrible but the contrast of the service between our table and the one across us was an absolute smack in the face.\n\nHe had seriously not only spoken to them in a much welcoming and warmer tone to the other table across from us, but also had called a cab for them as well.  I'm feeling that he treated us the way he did because my girlfriend and I were younger and weren't a couple. Well let me tell you, we would not be dining at a restaurant that we could not afford, if not splurge. This is one of the most awful experiences I'd ever had.

The place was absolutely packed and with only 2 wait staff and one who only had been on the job 4 days... things did not go well. Our waiter was very pleasant so no fault of his but just too many diners with too few staff. First after 30 minutes of having been sat at our table we had to ask for bread. A number of times we had to request our water glasses be refilled and our salads were forgotten and after mentioning upon receiving our entrees. He brought the salads but our was soaked with dressing with too few of the toppings, it was not good at all... the entr\u00e9e portion was so skimpy and the mashed potatoes was portioned as if it were being rationed. Last night's experience was so unlike all our past dining experiences it makes me wonder if Andre sold the place. I gather my husband and I will go back (alone...without friends) one more time to make sure things have not changed permanently before saying farewell.

The food is a mix of US and European styles, with a few regulars dishes like the hanger steak (excellent), mussels (ditto) and garlic snails (best I've had outside France).\n\nIt also has a selection of fish that can be cooked how you like it and with a choice of sauces. But if you go hold out for the daily specials. \n\nSome of the best food I've had since moving over here has come from the specials board. The lobster pot pie was so good my stomach wanted to take me home and cuddle me all night for being so good to it, the risottos are superb, the lamb shank so tender it fell off the bone and melted in the mouth and the French onion soup is, quite frankly, exquisite.\n\nI'd knock off half a star for the bouillabaisse, which seemed a bit thin when I had it and lacked the rich, dark texture of other versions but this may be a US thing.\n\nI've seen some complaints about the length of time it takes to get served. There's two reasons for this as far as I can see. Firstly, they cook their food properly. Oven cooked takes time and that is reflected in the taste; too many restaurants just slap stuff in the microwave which can destroy some delicate flavours and overheat certain foodstuffs.\n\nSecondly the place can get very busy indeed, particularly on Wednesdays, and that too cuts down on the service time. But enjoy the wait, dip your bread into the delicious herby olive oil that comes to everyone and savour the taste.\n\nThe wine list is good, if somewhat limited but you'd expect that from somewhere this small and the quality is high. They do a nice line in cognac as well.\n\nI'm moving to the East Bay soon and will have to curtail my visits to this little gem, but it's got under my skin and I know I'll be back.", "author": "Iain T."}

The food here was good (not great) but the service here stank!\n\nSeven of us had dinner here on May 14 and experienced the worst service ever.  The waiter/server took our orders and that's all he did.\n\nIt took almost an hour for the food to arrive at the table, with no excuse or explanation offered for the delay.  What was interesting and also concerning, was the fact that the group seated adjoining us arrived later than us and had their food served earlier. \n\nOur food was served by a bus boy - not in itself a problem, except that the other tables were served by regular servers.  We found the food to be good but nothing special.  The mussels, however, were excellent.  I had  the Rib-eye steak, as did three others and the rest ordered fish items.  Our steaks  were well seasoned and perfectly cooked, though the steaks were a tad on the thin side.\n\nAfter we had finished dinner, our plates sat for about 1/2 hr, before a different server came by to clear the table and offer dessert.  Having gone through the delays and the indifference we experienced, we opted not to order dessert.\n\nIt was very unfortunate and, I am sure, embarassing to him, that our host was forced to get up several times to check on the delay with the food, to request water, to request that the plates be cleared, etc., etc.\n\nConsidering the small size of the restaurant, our servers could not have helped but notice that our table was not getting the attention it should have received.  But, nobody seemed to care.\n\nIf you do not care about service and are only looking for good food, go for it.

I decided on Alamo Square Seafood Grill because of the rave reviews of fresh fish, the convenient location, and the early prix fixe option. I made a reservation through open table 2 weeks ahead, and even sent an email to the owner to ask about corkage options for a large party(6). This was our last diner together for 2008, and we were exchanging holiday gifts. We wanted a cozy low-key place. Yelp to the rescue as always, this place fit all our criteria.\n\nEveryone in the party arrived within 20minutes of the scheduled reservation,\nthen the wait began. We waited:\nfor bread\nfor the waitress to tell of any specials(a few were on the board)\nfor the waitress to answer any questions about the fish offering for the \nevening for those that would be ordering the prix fixe.\nfor our first bottle to be uncorked.\n\nNot only did we wait, but we HAD TO ASK(!!?) \nfor each of the items listed above.\n\nWe actually felt as if the table was overlooked on purpose.\nWho in the hell waits 30minutes before bread is brought to the table when the entire party is seated? At least two of the dishes had to be sent back because they were cold, and one of the dishes was completely wrong. The main entrees were all very good, but the starters and desserts offered at Alamo Square Seafood Grill are nothing spectacular.\n\nThe icing on this slice of crapload cake was that we were overcharged by about $150.00 when the bill arrived. We have had 350.00 dinners, when it comes to food and wine we don't play around. This experience in no way came close to something of that caliber and we immediately knew hat something was off. It was blatantly obvious! The waitress clearly saw that there was an issue but made no move to come over and ask if there was a problem. We  just sat around looking foolish punching numbers into 3 different iphones and scratching our heads like 'what the hell is going on'. We again HAD TO ASK for the dinner menu, the dessert menu, and finally for her to come over and itemize the bill. She quickly checked off a few things, what they were and turned around and left. \n\nThankfully one of the girls in the crew is an accountant. She went through the bill a final time and simply stated: \"The math is off, this doesn't add up.\" We again called the waitress over and this time she returned with the half-assed excuse: \n\"something must have been left over on the register.\" After a slow build up to boiling point over the evening  I was completely livid. After an insincere apology from the waitress-she did not look anyone at the table in the eye-we left never to return again. I felt completely horrible and apologized to all the girls, what a sad way to remember our last night together.  I won't get to see a few of them until our dinners start up again in the new year :(\n\nIf you do visit,  make sure to review the bill with an eagle eye. I wonder how many patrons have just slipped their cards in the little black book without even reviewing the charges? If it happened to us I'm sure that they have overcharged others before. And to the waitstaff, if you don't enjoy interacting with the public don't choose a customer service oriented job. . .", "author": "Kia B."}

They failed to mention this to anyone before they were seated though so some people ended up walking out.

The escargot was nice and meaty and not super garlicky; warning they come out fiery hot and you will scald your tongue; learn from my mistakes. The scallop gratin was good... little too much potato for me but there were chunks of scallop in a crispy creamy crust of potato; very yummie.\nI was glad we got to eat the apps for dinner just the right amount of food and all very delicious. Another wonderful evening at Alamo Square.\n\nOrignial Review:\nLoved it. At first a little skeptical walking up at 8 to a completely empty restaurant, but we were quickly greeted and seated, whereever we wanted. Our waiter / maitre d / only person other then the chef was very pleasant and congenial. The place is nice and cozy with the daily specials on the chalkboards.\nThe menu has some great choices and I want to return to have a dinner of just the seafood apps; they all look really delicious.\nI had the special salad which was romaine with chunks of bacon and a delicious dressing. The house salad was less interesting with mixed greens and a vinagrette; the special was definitely the winner here.\nFor the main course i had the peppercorn crusted flank steak on a bed of mashed potatoes and baby bok choy. The steak was cooked well and flavor for medium rare and the portions was decent. The garlic mashed potatoes were perfectly creamy but I didn't want to suffer later with the chunks of whole garlic so i left most of it.\nThe special was a seared ahi tuna on bed of corn risotto and a sweet salsa which kind of killed the dish. The tuna was perfect with the risotto but the sweet salsa didn't go well.\nDESSERT!!! Save room for when they have the warm flourless chocolate cake. AWESOME!! So yummie!

We started out with several appetizers -- mussels, crab cake, and fried calamari -- all of which were good. (Well, I'm assuming the calamari was good; it went so fast that I didn't even get to taste it.) One person in our party also had the clam chowder, which he liked very much as well.\n\nFor my entre, I had grilled salmon with a garlic parsley butter. The fish was cooked perfectly -- crispy on the outside, delicate on the inside -- and was served on a bed of polenta and roasted vegetables. It was very, very good.\n\nFor dessert the table ordered several of the chocolate brownie a la mode. It was warm, gooey, and intensely chocolatey. Excellent.\n\nThe interior has a casual, friendly, bistro-like feel. It did get a bit loud, but it was a Saturday night, after all, and the place was hopping.\n\nNow about the service... our server (who I think was also the manager) was very brusque and several times skipped over people when taking our orders for wine, appetizers, food and dessert. For example. upon sitting down, we decided that 2 people in our party were going to order a bottle of wine, while the remaining 5 of us would order single glasses. After placing our order for the bottle and indicating that we wanted two glasses, our server started to leave the table. When I stopped him and explained that the rest of us would be ordering wine by the glass, he acted annoyed. Not cool. Also, after he brought the bottle of wine to our table, he left it there unopened for about 10 minutes while the rest of us who had ordered single glasses stared politely (and longingly) at the glasses of wine sitting before us.\n\nThe woman server who pitched in and helped at our table seemed much friendlier. Had she been our server, I think we would have had a much better overall experience.\n\nOne saving grace: the gratuity was not included in our check. We tipped accordingly. Had we been forced to pay 18% for sub-standard service, I doubt any of us would make a return visit.\n\nI will definitely go back to Alamo Square Grill, but next time I'll request to sit in a different section.", "author": "The Other Jeff A."}

I had the worst dinning experience EVER - and really, my bf and I eat out at nearly every meal.  I gave the restaurant an opportunity to somewhat redeem themselves by sending them an email, before I posted a nasty yelp review.  They never responded, so instead of reliving the anger and horror, I'm simply pasting the letter I wrote them as a review:\n\nDear Andre,\n \nI had dinner with my boyfriend at your restaurant on Saturday July 7th.  I eat out at nearly every meal and I'd like to share with you my experience, for two reasons.  First, I'd like for you to take the actions to correct and improve your restaurant - because I love neighborhood restaurants and I think yours is really cute and I want it to do well. Second, it was so bad that every time I think about it I get pissed - and really, I'm a chill person.  I am writing to you because I had the worst experience I've ever had eating out at a restaurant - perhaps, ever.  \n \nMy bf and I were seated right away.  We ordered our meal, him a tuna in white wine sauce, and me, the steak in medium rare.  We did not receive any service for the next 45 minutes.  No bread.  No drink order.  The busboy brings out our plates and both are cold.  Not even lukewarm - straight COLD.  I eye for service, and get none for a while.  The chef (perhaps you?) sees us and brings bread while asking us how our dishes are - certainly already knowing they are cold.  We send the steak back, and not the fish, not because the fish dish isn't just as cold, but because we needed to EAT something\nimmediately.  He was about to get a migraine and I was about to pass out from low blood sugar if we didn't eat something right away. Again, there was no service and no bread prior.\n \nThe chef takes the steak and says \"We'll start all over.\"  When I get the steak, it's the same one, and as you know - you can't re-cook a medium-rare steak.  The meat came out chewy, and hardly medium.  And - he omitted the mixed vegetables, as if the dish would be comped anyway so he didn't even try.  He offered free dessert but we had been at the restaurant for so long - over an hour and a half - that it wasn't worth our time to stay.\n \nWhat was most infuriating about the night actually - was not the food.  \n \nMy boyfriend left to get the car as the waitress was getting our bill.  The steak was comped - the tuna wasn't.  It bothered me a bit that we'd be paying for the meal because the service and food was THAT bad, but I also felt bad not paying at all.  I place a credit card immediately after I get the bill.  The waitress walks by my table 4 times - without even LOOKING to check if the bill was ready.  The waitress processes to seat a table - and OPEN a bottle of wine for a table of 4!    Like, HELLO!  As if it wasn't bad enough already she completely ignored us for the last hour and a half!  \n \n10 minutes pass and my boyfriend comes back into the restaurant to tell me he was parked around the corner... And this is what pisses me off the most...\n \nMy boyfriend is standing over the table talking to me, and since we had been waiting so long to pay the bill it may seem as if we might take off- cause she KNOWS how BAD her service is...  she stops pouring wine for another table, to REACH across the aisle, UNDER my boyfriend's arm, to GRAB THE BILL.  BUT NOT BECAUSE SHE IS URGENTLY ON HER WAY TO RING THE CARD.  SHE TAKES ANOTHER 5-10 MINUTES TO SEAT A TABLE OF 8 PEOPLE, AND POUR WINE.  WHAT THE FU*K!  And after an hour and a half of completely IGNORING US - the only thing she is quick about is, grabbing the bill before we bail!  \n \nThis is absolutely the most outrageously rude service I've ever had. \n \nNot only are we not going back, but we are furious and want to tell everyone about it.", "author": "Lily H."}

We are glad we did as we liked it very much. Although not for everybody, the clientele they do serve seem very happy to be there.\n\nThis is a low key, neighborhood restaurant that serves delicious fish at amazingly affordable prices.  I was at a table of four picky eaters and we each ordered a different fish/sauce and were all equally pleased with our dinners.\n\nThe parking is awful of course and being a neighborhood place, there is no fast way to get there if you don't live in the neighborhood other than to slog through the stop lights. \n\nThe wine list is poor and I would highly recommend bringing your own as they have a very modest corkage fee ($12) and thankfully they don't make you feel bad for bringing your own wine like some restaurants do.\n\nWe would definitely go back to Alamo Square and would recommend it to friends looking for  a low key and pleasant dinner out.", "author": "Kristine H."}

At first I was skeptical about moving in right about a seafood grill.  I imagined that I'd have rotting fish stench wafting up to my apartment from the trash bins in back.  Luckily, this hasn't been the case at all.  So far I've only had excellent food smells drifting up.  \r\n\r\nIt's not the nicest restaurant in SF, but if you want good seafood for a fraction of the price you'd pay elsewhere it seems to be a good choice.  I also recommend paying attention to the specials and the prix fixe menu.  I've had the best luck with them.\r\n\r\nEDIT 4/11:  In the last month or so they got a new server.  He's much better than the guy who used to work here.

Great food, horrible service. She got butter on my shirt, she dropped bread in my lap, and she ignored us for 15-20 minutes at a stretch.  This wouldn't have bothered me that much, except that she didn't seem to care at all. The deep fryer was down so there were no fries, but she forgot to mention it until I ordered. \n\nThe food however was great. I had a NY Steak. Perfectly cooked, with a great sauce and fantastic potatoes. The people I was with all had the Snapper, and there wasn't a bite left on the plate. The GF and I shared a one of the best pieces of tiramisu we'd ever had. \n\nThe next day we complained to the manager, and  to our surprise, he comped us a second meal. \n\nOn our second trip, the service was much, much better. At times a little slow , but she was apologetic about it (different waitress, there is only one a night), and very pleasant. Our server also knew all the dishes very well. We found out that there is only one server on duty at a time, so they can get a backed up. \n\nWe repeated the same entrees. The steak was great again, this time it was served with frites, which where crispy and hot,  but a little too salted. My GF's snapper was also too salty, but still good. I the soup of the day, which was potato and corn with cream and blue cheese. Fantastic. The GF got the mussel appetizer. The mussels were good, but not great (a few of them were bitter, perhaps they're going out of season?) but the broth they were served in was amazing. The GF was dipping the good bread they serve into it to get it all. Dessert was a good hot chocolate cake with ice cream. My GF had a lemon cheesecake and ginger snap crust. The cheesecake was not as smooth as some places, but the flavor was there. \n\nGood food, great prices, so-so service. I will be back!", "author": "Chuck K."}

Since I live so close, I was really hoping to have a good experience here. I've been there twice. Here's what went down.\n\nTrip 1: I was on a date. After sitting down and waiting a few minutes, I noticed a cockroach walking RIGHT behind my head. I nearly lept from the table, but didn't want to make a big deal. Ya know, these things can happen and given that I'd yet to accurately judge the service and food, I wanted to give the place the benefit of the doubt. I quietly told the waiter about the cockroach and he seriously shrugged it off like it was no big deal. He went over and grabbed the cockroach but was FAR from apologetic. Although we were very uncomfortable, we decided to stay. The food was average at best. Everything was VERY salty and the prices were way too high for such average food. The service was sub-par and we left disappointed.\n\nTrip 2: About six months later, my girlfriend and I (different girl) were sitting in apartment starving one night and I figured I'd give this place another shot. We had the same waiter that I'd had about six months prior and this time he was quite rude. He has an arrogance about him that is very offputting. He's not necessarily a \"jerk\" per-se, but he has a nonchalance attitude that makes you think you're imposing on him. \n\nI can't even recall what I ordered, but when I took my first bite I almost broke a tooth.

We tried four and all were horrible, not bad, they were horrible. I would stay away from the Baby Field Greens & Fines Herbes Salad. [sic] Look, if my girlfriend, who's idea of cooking is boiling water for ramen noodles, can make a better salad than you then you didn't try hard enough. It was not a salad at all. It looked like someone took a handful of mixed greens from a bag of greens purchased at Safeway and added four, yes we counted, four pieces of radish.  To make things worse, server 0001 was not at all apologetic when we mentioned the chef's lack of imagination relative to the salad and said \"we have other salads on the menu but you ordered mixed greens and that is what you got.\" We left fifteen percent anyway because he was a pretty nice guy and gave honest opinions on menu choices.  Come on Alamo chef, most people feel that a mixed greens salad would come with a slice of tomato or a cumber. Spend a dollar on a salad, will you. \n\nThe good far outweighs the bad.  I like the off-the-beaten-path location. The restaurant has a nice quaint feel and it clearly has lots of regulars. The steamed mussels were very good. The swordfish was excellent but if you can substitute anything for the uninspired unflavored vegetables that accompany it do it! The Mediterranean Fish Soup is similar to boulibase but not quite as thick but is a real bargain at $14.75. The salmon was better than average, the bread pudding really good and the flourless chocolate cake was excellent but on the small side.\n\nI will return but the next time I will go on a Wednesday night when you can bring your own wine and not pay a corkage fee and order from the prix fixe menu.

It's a popular neighborhood spot that's been open for 9 years. The restaurant is tastefully decorated and very small, about 10-15 tables total with no formal bar. The General Manager, Andre, is a highlight of the place. His garish French attitude is fun and he says everything with a smile while God knows what he is thinking in his head. He adds quite a bit to the charm and amusement to the place. \n\nThe menu is proportionate to the restaurant, small but good. It is almost entirely seafood except for three land lover dishes: a rib eye, a chicken and a vegetarian dish. Fish is their speciality, with few shellfish choices, so you really need to like fish fish to enjoy your meal here. I had the blackened sole with tomatoes, capers, olives and my mother the grilled salmon with bearnaise white wine, shallots and tarragon hollandaise. Both fish dishes were delicious. My fiance asked Andre what he would recommend and in fine French fashion he looks him over and said, \"you will have the sauteed salmon with beurre blanc\" and quickly scribbled it down on his pad. We all called out \"no!\"  as he was looking for one of the land lover dishes and not fish, but we all liked his enthusiasm. His rib eye turned out to be delicious with its yummy truffle butter and pmme frites (french fries). We had the creme brulee for dessert and it was divine but the crust wasn't hardened enough and I wasn't able to get that cracking sound when I dove in for my first bite.\n\nAlamo Square Seafood is a delicious under recognized restaurant.

The menu is quite straightforward French-leaning American food -- not much here that would surprise or shock the diner.  The d\u00e9cor is not what you would call edgy or original and the atmosphere can sometimes be a bit subdued.\n\nBut come in from the street, hungry and wind-blown, and you're in for a pleasant time.  There are several fish options and you choose the preparation and the sauce.  There's a steak, a fowl, a veg dish... all the basics.  You get what you ask for, and sometimes that's such a relief!  The wine list could use more Californian wines, in my opinion, but there are some tasty French wines on there.  The service has been great every time.  Lovely dip for the bread.\n\nThe bottom line: Good place to bring unadventurous eaters for a solid meal in a pleasant ambiance.  And for a reasonable price too!", "author": "Karen L."}

In regards to people complaining about the service, I can understand what you mean, there was only one person working there and it did take a little while; however, if you're not in a rush and don't mind a little wait while you enjoy your company; Alamo Square Seafood Grill is a great place to have a nice leisurely dinner and enjoy good food and our server was friendly.  Though going with a group of six worked fine for us, it was on a weeknight.  It's a small place, so probably not good for a big group on the weekend.\n\nThe food at Alamo Square Seafood Grill is amazing and is somewhat hidden in the Alamo Square area.  I had the grilled New York steak and the soup of the day, French onion soup.  I thought both were delicious.  The seasoning on the pieces of steak was top notch and the French onion soup was unlike any French onion soup I've had previously; it wasn't overload with cheese or onions; it was just really good, tasty, and uniquely flavored.

Wednesday night is an all-together different perk...no corkage fee.  \n\nThe waiter, while often the only waiter, can seem a little distant at first (he's just busy) but is quick to offer recommendations from the menu and wine pairings.  \n\nAll-in-all great meal, ambiance, and value.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-03-16", "description": "Unfortunately this restaurant did not win me over.  My dad loves to go out for seafood whenever he visits San Francisco.  I had heard good things about Alamo Square Seafood Grill so we decided to give it a try.  My overall impression was that it felt pretty obvious they were cutting corners to save/make money and it really detracted from the overall experience.\n\nThe decor and ambiance are cute and welcoming, however there is not much space and you may have no choice but to sit near the drafty entrance.  I liked the color scheme. There is a cute indoor window to the upper loft that has potential to be a cute feature, but instead there was some mess from the office above just showing through into the restaurant below.  And the tables and chairs are on the small side, giving it that cramped feeling that is quite common in San Francisco restaurants.\n\nI went with the pre-fixe menu. I guess I don't know what I was expecting ordering 3 courses for $12, but it just didn't impress.  The main problem was that I didn't get what I ordered.  I was told the salad was plain mixed greens, however it had carrots, tomatoes, and shaved fennel in it.  That would have been fine, but it was odd that the waitress didn't explain that when asked.  Also there was a black spot on one of my carrot slices, kind of off-putting.\n\nI thought the mahi-mahi was supposed to come with some type of mixed-pepper  topping, but instead it came in a an undiscernable reddish brown sauce (red bean?) that was tasty, but unappealing looking, and it was quite cold!  The rice was very basic and fine.  The vegetable selection was mixed squash, which I don't typically care for.  It was pretty tasty as the veggies were doused in some type of oil or butter, but overall it was just an uninspired dish that I could have made easily at home.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was when dessert was served.  I saw the tables next to us received their bread pudding, however we were delivered a white mound covered in almond slices and what looked like Hershey's chocolate syrup.  I realized this was the wrong dessert, and wanted to tell our waitress but she did not visit our table for another 5-10 minutes, even as we tried to get her attention.  We decided to bite into the dessert we had been served, because we figured it would probably be a decent slice of pie or something. It must have been  their take on meringue, which was essentially just lightly whipped egg whites in some milky sauce - it was pretty bad and very cheap (along the same line as the bread pudding would have been I suppose).\n\nWe ordered two different glasses of red wine (a pinot and a syrah) and both tasted a little off (cheap, slightly sour).\n\nMy dad had the fried calamari appetizer (which had little popcorn shrimp mixed into the basket somehow) and blackened salmon which I thought was pretty good, but the portion was definitely on the small side.  My dad didn't even finish it.  He is not a picky eater at all, and for him it is usually seen as a rare treat to go out to eat, but at the end of the meal he asked me how many restaurants are in San Francisco.  I guessed it to be about 3000, and he just said \"well, ok, I guess we'll never have to come to this one again.\"\n\nThat's what ultimately prompted to write this review.

The place has always had this offbeat, French, sit down and enjoy slow food feel about it.\n\nThe fish is always spot on.  So are the crabcakes.  Order a crabcake appetizer and your favorite fish grilled with beurre blanc.  Other reviewers point out that Wednesdays are free corkage nights.  Pack up a couple of those Napa wines you have been saving from your last trip north and enjoy with the best fish around.  Last Wednesday we brought two nice bottles with us.  Appetizers, entrees and dessert for three people came in under a hundred bucks including tip.\n\nI have been to better quality restaurants but I have never been to a place that does such a good job so consistently as Alamo Square Grill.", "author": "Cheezy P."}

I have to say all the reviews are pretty spot on. The place is cute and the food is affordable, but the food is not stellar.. nor is the service.\n\nI would definitely eat a snack before going here, as they don't take your order for some time.  They did bring us extra bread, as my friend and I killed the first round in the half hour we waited for our food, so that was nice.  The steak was good when it finally arrived, but something was up with the spinach and neither of us could eat it (some sort of sour taste).  The fries were tasty, but my friend mentioned they looked and tasted exactly like McDonalds... which are cheaper and just down the street!  Finally we tried for a while, unsuccessfully,  to get the bill.  The place is small, and was not full, so I sort of just started feeling like i was not cool enough to get the waiters attention.  At one point he walked by us to greet some people walking in and I reached up to tap his arm to get his attention.  He turned around so fast into my hand though, that i ended up fully grabbing his arm in a creepy/ pushy sort of way, which caused him to look down and give me a look that made me feel pretty rude.. but i really just wanted to give him a tap!\n\nAnyway, I think i got carried away with this one... I'd probably go again at some point, because it is so close, but hopefully not anytime soon.", "author": "Erin D."}

We arrived before the rush (7pm) and brought a bottle of wine (free corkage Wed.).  I mention the arrival time because I think arriving before the restaurant was packed resulted in our receiving the good service many other Yelpers mention was lacking during their visits.  The restaurant only employs one waiter, it seems.  He was a great server, but once the restaurant got packed (right about the time we were finishing our mains) the poor guy was running around like a madman trying to take care of 20 tables!  \n\nThe food itself was FANTASTIC.  We started with escargot (very tender, not overly garlicy) and calamari (very good, but nothing special--ended up being more excited by the white bean and field green salad the calamari was served upon).  4 of the 5 members of our party got the prix fixe menu which that night included a starter of lobster bisque (creamy, yummy), melt-in-your-mouth blackened salmon with rice, veggies and a tomato-caper relish, and a chocolate souffle (sadly, the one less-than-stellar item: part of the problem was in calling the dessert a souffle.  Souffle by definition is light and fluffy.  This chocolate cake-like item was dense as a rock and nearly as hard.  The flavor was fine without being note-worthy.  Worth getting as part of the prix fixe, otherwise, not so much).  The fifth member of our party got the filet minion with a green peppercorn sauce and potatoes with pancetta.  The steak was a flavor-sensation (wonderful char on the meat also gave the tender cut a great textural contrast) and the pancetta served with the potatoes was smoky and a wonderful counterpoint to the potatoes.", "author": "H B."}

Well, I'm not sure about the regulars part, but it definitely does not deliver on the food front.  So much for the cute, alluring outside.\n\nWhile there wasn't anything glaringly wrong, nothing was brilliantly great, either.  In fact, it's a little tough to write a review on a place when I have almost no recollection of the meal (and not a result of too much wine, thank you) except that the cooks kept yelling things out to the wait staff on the floor--reminiscent at times of the \"whhooooppp\" that brought down  Howard Dean's campaign a while back.\n\nAside from that, the best way to describe this place is \"beige\":  nothing remarkable one way or another, run-of-the-mill food and mediocre service.  My guess is that it does okay because of its location and lack of nearby competition beyond a liquor store on the corner (yes, this does beat out a Slim Jim and diet Coke for dinner).

The salads were a little too large to accompany a main course, but mine was tasty and full of Maytag Blue Cheese which I love.

What a mistake I made! First the host is a rude self absorbed man, who won't look at you until he's good and ready to. Had to wait 15 minutes although we had made reservations which is definitely the first loss of any points. The second loss comes from the two ladies who ran out screaming ahead of us. They were disgusted and we could only wonder why...until we got handed a glass of water with a cockroach floating in it. Not only did they give the same water to the ladies which is definitely disgusting...but then didn't notice it and gave it to us as well.  Should've been the first sign of a bad time, but I realize every place has roaches...it's just you don't want to see them and be reminded. \n\nSo, after 10 minutes of no service and no attention, my girlfriend finally goes up to the counter with the glass and stands there for another 5 minutes without even a batted eyelash from the host. She finally just asks for sparkling water and gets dismissed by him. It finally took her telling him he needed to see something and gently pointed at the roach in the water before he even acknowleged she was there. \n\nHis reaction \"Oh you found it, we were looking for it\" and the comped sparkling water are the only reason we might have stuck around. As we sat drinking our now sparkling water, the server came by to collect dishes from the neighboring tables. As she walked by me, she dropped a dirty fork from a dish down my back and heard it hit the floor. She doesn't notice it, and actually leaves it there the entire time. Then as she brings the mussels that we ordered, drops the fork for the mussels in my lap. \n\nLots of strikes...but at this point we had a bottle of wine, and well...might as well see the visit to the end. \n\nThe food: the mussels were seriously below average. Decent garlic butter sauce they were sitting in, but they were very fishy to the taste...something I've never experienced with mussels before. (an inclination of how well prepared they've been at other places). \n\nThe saving grace for this place and the only reason they have 1 star is because the chilean sea bass and the grilled tuna were beyond delicious. Even though there was some severe stomach discomfort several hours later that prevented them from having 2 stars. Would I go back?  Hell no!!!", "author": "m p."}

When we want seafood, we typically don't go anywhere else, and there's a reason for that.  In a nutshell, it's a nice, low-key, fairly unpretentious, reasonably priced neighborhood spot.  Its got a nice atmosphere, dimly lit, candle-light, nice artwork on the walls, chill/jazzy music.  And, most importantly, the food is always good.  I've never had a bad or poorly cooked entree.  I particularly like the variety of sauces involved with ordering your fish.  You can choose from I believe up to 4 different types of sauces, and you choose the method its prepared (sauteed, blackened, etc).  It's a cool little neighborhood spot, nice place to take a date.

Despite having made a reservation, there was no table ready for us when my girlfriend and I arrived (we were even ten minutes early for the reservation).  Forgivable perhaps -- until a walk-in couple was seated at the next table that became available -- even before those of us with a reservation.\r\n\r\nWe then waited another fifteen minutes for a table, which finally became available after the maitre d' cleared a recently-vacated, four-top table and split it into two.  Yet while we were waiting, a buddy of the maitre d' arrived and was seated not only at the same time as us, but at the far better table -- I say far better because our table was not even capable of use: it was so close to the tables lining the nearby wall that I could not even pull my chair up to the table without literally sitting on top of the individual dining next to us.\r\n\r\nI informed the maitre d' that the table was unacceptable and that I was truly disappointed with the service, yet -- despite acknowledging the table was unusable -- he nevertheless suggested I was somehow at fault for having only made a reservation about an hour prior to my arrival (!).    When I pointed out that it was his restaurant that GAVE ME THE RESERVATION (indeed, that's the whole point of having a reservation) he had no real response.  He also had no real response when I pointed out that his friend who arrived twenty minutes after us was seated at the same time (and at an actual, usable table).

They are greatly understaffed- there was one waitress and a man, who was a host/server and probably the owner.  With just two people working the entire restaurant the service was slow.  The man was the one who served us and he had an arrogance about him that made me and my family feel like a bunch of idiots.  Especially when describing the wine- as though all we'd ever had was a box of Franzia.  The little sample of tomato soup and the \"French\" onion soup we had before our main courses were both very salty and incredibly rich.  Getting our entrees took forever, actually the waiter took our silverware away at one point thinking we had already eaten.  When we stopped him and told him we had to receive to our entrees he looked very surprised.  The atmosphere was so loud.  \n\nThe place was packed and so it was really bustling, but if that wasn't enough they were blaring 80's pop.  (Really fitting for a dark French bistro.)  We were also seated right behind the kitchen and so on top of the natural noise of the tables, the pop music there were dishes being slammed around (twice something broke) and an annoying chopping noise that sounded more like a hammer.\n\nFinally the food came out about 45mins after we ordered and it was room temperature- not very hot at all.  I got the scallop special with a blue crab potato puree, a charred tomato, a cream sauce and watercress dressed across the top.  It was pretty good, but there did seem to be too much going on, on the plate. Simpler sides and lighter sauce would have been better.  So overall it was okay but little did I know that, that was not the end of my dining experience! When I got home I had a terrible stomachache and had a lot of trouble sleeping.  I attribute it  and my throwing up THREE times that night to the slightly undercooked, luke warm scallops. So for all that I give it one star, I mean at least they tried.", "author": "Ashley C."}

The hair challenged receptionist/waiter is so rude that it feels like he's doing you a favor letting you in. Once you're seated, the service tends to be terrible although a few times it was just bearable.\n\nWhen it comes to the food, they have an interesting way to marinate your fish selection if that's what you like. However I doubt the fish is really fresh. Everything tastes more or less as if it was just taken out of the freezer and warmed up for you (think Olive Garden). For years, this place used to be a bargain with fish entrees around $12. However they have raised the prices in the last couple of years. Now it's not a bargain anymore AND the food is mediocre. \n\nAll in all, it's a fairly miserable dining experience.

But, I went last night (Wednesday nights have no corkage fee!), and had a great meal for around $50 for two.  Not bad.  The food was solid - the bread and pesto dip was great, and they came out with a curry soup taste that was delicious.  Then we had two appetizers - the escargot was great, while the other dish, which I forget the name of, had scallops and mushrooms in a kind of casserole, was not very good.  It's not on the online menu, so maybe it's an experiment that hopefully won't last long.  I had the seafood stew for my main course, which was great, although not what was advertised (I was told it would be in a tomato broth and involved mussels, prawns, crab, fish, and calamari, and it was in a white wine/garlic broth and didn't include crab at all).  My dinner partner had blackened snapper, and it was great.  All and all, it's a great meal for a great price and I would definitely go back.\n\nUPDATE: So, I went back, and I will now never be back.

My one exception is the time I ordered the swordfish -- a weekday special -- and hated it.  Perhaps I'm not a swordfish kind of gal, but it still hasn't stopped me from returning.  Its often packed (even on weekdays), so you know the fish has to be super fresh...", "author": "Lisa C."}

I wanted to find a local place to take my Grandma and sister before heading over to Beach Blanket Babylon, and my friend suggested this great little spot 3 blocks from my house. We got there at 6:45 and they seemed surprised we didn't have a reservation, but the place did fill up as we were eating. I had the special - petrole sole with a lemon-caper sauce, haricots verts and almonds and vegetable polenta, and it was awesome! The polenta was especially delicious - I couldn't stop eating it. I'd never had sole before, but it was prepared wonderfully and the sauce was fantastic. My grandmother ordered the crab cakes as a main dish instead of an appetizer, and really enjoyed them (she thought they were a bit too peppery, but still great, and I actually thought they were the best ones I'd ever had. I don't usually like them, but I liked these! Probably because they had lobster in them), and my sister had the vegetarian dish (gnocchi with tons of veggies). We also shared the flourless chocolate cake and a huckleberry-strawberry-apple crisp, both ala mode - yum! With all that, three coffees, and three glasses of wine, the bill (before tip) came out to only $90. Oh, and they also brought us a little amuse bouche (ha! doesn't that make you think of that Friends episode with Jon Lovitz? Well, it is amus-ing!) of a very yummy and interesting white bean soup in a little espresso cup before we ordered, as well as bread with an interesting pesto-ish dipping sauce. The service was also awesome - we had two people (a male and a female) waiting on us who were both  very friendly and attentive, took our coats, and were happy to call a cab for us at the end of the meal. Great place - I can't wait to go back!\n\nOh, one other thing - it's got a very nice, but very dimly-lit ambiance, so my sister and I had to hold up our cell phones so my grandmother could read the menu. If you have trouble reading in low light, bring a flashlight!", "author": "Janet G."}

She's been trying to get me to go for quite some time, and I must say, I'm kicking myself for not eating here sooner!  This is a wonderfully unpretentious, romantic little neighborhood gem where you can enjoy a flavorful meal with quality ingredients at a reasonable price.\n\nThe wine list is predominately French, which I am not well versed in, being a California Snob.  However, there were quite a few bottles in the $30 range, and when we asked our server to recommend something, he was quite helpful and didn't try to upsell anything (We settled on a delicious Pinot Gris from Alsace for $35).\n\nAs for the food, it was all great.  We shared the crab cakes which were as good as any I've had in the city.  My wife ordered the chicken, and while I generally refuse to ever order chicken when we're out, I think I'll have to make a permanent exception for Alamo Square.  The dish was so succulent!\n\nI ordered the cassoulet, having never had this dish before.  This was on their special list, so I can't vouch for it being available in the future.  However, I was really delighted in the subtle flavor of the duck, white beans, sausage, and tomato sauce.\n\nWe closed out with a little Port and Espresso, and the evening was a resounding delight!\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as we did!", "author": "Brian S."}

It's a good place if you pick the prix fixe menu, but there are two things wrong with it.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is that the desserts are weak.  This is actually surprising, as it takes a lot to make me unhappy with anything with sugar on top... but they've managed it.  Soggy and tasteless meringue thingy.\r\n\r\nThe second thing is that the service is... well, french.  There's just no other way to put it.  If you need to get out of there fast, your best bet is to grab a server by the ear and hold him until he agrees to give you the check, and pay cash so you don't have to wait for the credit card to come back.\r\n\r\nOther than that, no complaints.", "author": "Will S."}

Found parking across the street readily early at 5PM. They don't open until 5:30PM, though, but they happily seated us anyways. They only take reservations by phone, and it's an answering machine, which apparently didn't work too well for same-day reservations, but that wasn't a problem as it was still early, and maybe not so busy on a Sunday. Anyways, as for parking, there is a free lot on Fulton between Fillmore and Webster. It's a small neighborhood spot, tiny, with stylish saffron walls and brick-colored highlights, creating a comforting, cozy atmosphere. My friend and I sat in the corner spot for 2, to the left of the doorway as you enter. The comfy banquette and pillows were very appealing. And the food, what a steal! They offer a 3 course prix fixe on weekdays from 5:30 to 7:30PM and all day on Sundays! First course was a choice of cream of artichoke soup with bacon or a nicely vinaigrette-dressed green salad with artichokes, diced cucumbers, and yellow globe tomatoes. The soup was good on such a cold wintry evening, and my friend enjoyed it. I had the salad, which was a lot more interesting than it sounded, and I really enjoyed it as well. The entree was the chef's choice of beef bourguignon (containing Burgundy and often braised onions and mushrooms, parsley, thyme, and butter). There were also some Brussels sprouts and carrots. It tasted great and was a nice comfy dish. Dessert was a \"Floating Island\" of poached meringue in a sea of creme anglaise, centered with a mint \"palm tree\". The proper French name for this dessert is \"Oeufs a la Neige\", meaning \"Eggs in the Snow\". One of the original desserts of early Louisiana brought by the French, it's also sometimes called \"Ile flottante\". Apparently Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy ate this dessert in a movie called \"The Desk Set\". The wine prices here are very reasonable (and there's no corkage fee on Wednesdays), and they don't overcharge for coffee either. Our server was terrific, pleasant and personable. My friend and I had a great time, and he lives nearby, so I think this will be a great neighborhood spot for him.", "author": "Hao L."}

The last time I was there I started with the shrimp bisque which was so delicious and then had some of the best Rack of Lamb I have ever had. This time, I went for the Prix Fixe meal which is offered from 5 - 7pm daily. For $14.50 I had a green salad with a very light and flavorful dijon dressing, perfectly cooked mahi-mahi in a buerre blanc sauce, with rice and equally terrific grilled vegetables and a delicious dessert called \"Floating Island\". My husband ordered off the regular menu and had the same salad as me, the Country Pate appetizer and Blackened Snapper with a spicy peppercorn sauce. The food was fantastic and the bill even better: $47 for both of us. The ambiance was really nice too - cozy, dimly lit with candles at each table and very romantic overall.

BLECCHHHHHHH\n- grilled ahi tuna w/green peppercorn sauce (RECOMMENDED BY THE OWNER): came served in a way that didn't appear as if it had a seen a grill, was luke warm, no trace of green peppercorn sauce anywhere, and pathetic attempt to garnish the plate with i think were pea shoots but just thrown on the plate so they looked like grass clippings\n-shellfish soup: i thought it would be something like cioppino our bouillabaise but it was more like an overcreamed, oily chowder .  the menu clearly read \"shellfish\" but there were hunks of fish in there and again, they tasted fishy in a bad way.  they were selling it as a soup, but it was just so fatty (they even throw this huge superfluous dollop of parsley aioli on top) i kept wondering who in their right minds could actually consume this dish in a \"soup\"- like fashion.\n\nby the end of the meal, although the dessert offerings SOUNDED good, we passed cos we couldn't wait to get out of there.  the servers were so apathetic and there was so little interaction, we were convinced that neither spoke english (we found out they did when they took our credit card).  \n\nso dinner was a bust but i'm gonna take this as a lesson learned.  eating out can be hit or miss and sadly, this was definitely a miss, but at least i won't gaze longingly anymore everytime i pass by cos now i know it kinda sucks here.\n\nbummed i missed top chef but hooray for tivo.", "author": "Bird B."}

From the outside it doesn't look like much, but inside the decor is warm and inviting, candle lit.  Daily specials are written on chalk boards on the wall which reminded us of being in France.  A couple sitting next to us told us that we could order the risotto appetizer in a dinner portion, and always a sucker for good risotto, that's what I did.  My husband had the fish soup which was full of seafood and a delicious broth.  The chef started us off with an amouse bouche of white bean puree soup and fresh baked bread with the most delicious dipping oil made with fine herbes.  The best thing of all was the prices - what a great value in a city where the average dinner price seems to be $25.  Here most entrees are around $15 and could easily charge more.  But then it would lose some of it's appeal...nice ambiance, great comforting food, friendly staff, and a fantastic bargain.", "author": "Jen T."}

I had gone a few years ago and been underwhelmed, to say the least.  Well, they definitely redeemed themselves last night!  I think they must be reading their own reviews and really working to correct things.\nI have always liked the ambiance there, and if you are a fish person (which I am not necessarily) the menu is fine, but service has been a challenge.  Last night it was excellent.  Our server, a platinum blond whose name I didn't get, was wonderful.  The crab cake app was very good, though they could have brought an extra plate - knowing we were sharing.  We both had fish entrees - cooked to perfection.  Mine - the special - was to come with leeks and fingerling potatoes.  WHen I commented to the server that the fingerling potatoes seemed to be absent, she didn't get huffy or argue with me, she simply brought me a side order.  THAT is good service!  \nI had previewed their website and checked out their menu - and especially their wine list - in advance.  As a sommelier, I am interested in things like that.  The wine list was above average with some bold French choices.  Unfortunately the Riesling I had hoped to try was on the website but not on the restaurant's wine list - I can forgive that.  One criticism is the dixie cup sized wine glasses - they have to go.  I asked for regular wine glasses and they provided them, albeit with a bit of an attitude (this was another waiter, not our lovely server.)   \nWe tried the creme brulee despite reviews reading warnings against it. Yes, the sugar crust was way too thick and sugary, but that's actually my favorite part of creme brulee, so that's ok.  The custard itself was too saucy, not custard.  They should be able to fix this - how hard is it to make a good creme brulee?\nDespite little flaws, we really had a lovely, reasonable dinner.  I chalk it up to lovely atmosphere, basically excellent, well-prepared fish, and an highly skilled server.  I will now go back again as well as recommend it to others.

All was cooked to perfection and arrived in a timely manner (surprising since the waiter was single handed tonight) - all of this washed down with some very reasonably priced wine.

My last experience here though was, shall we say, very unimpressive.  We went on Wednesday to take advantage of the free corkage and we left commenting that we would've preferred to just pay for a bottle of wine somewhere else. The service was the worst I have experienced in a long time.  While not rude, the waitress was incredibly absent minded and inattentive. Two particular examples: we both replied \"yes\" when she asked if we wanted ground pepper and she then proceeded to only give it to me. Second, she refilled only my wine, while leaving my friend's glass empty. With every interaction she was distracted and seemed to listen to nothing. Ok, realizing everyone has \"off days\", I'll move beyond the service... when I asked her what the vegetarian dish is, she told me it was the sweet corn risotto (which was the side dish that went with the fish), but that it has more veggies. When our dishes came out, I was disappointed to see I had the EXACT same risotto (in quantity and without any extra veggies) as my friend who had ordered the fish (it was his side dish!!). Needless to say, they need to step up their veggie option. Using a side dish (without even increasing the quantity or attempting to dress it up) is unacceptable.
