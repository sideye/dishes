All our damn right chewy, ooey, gooey!  However , my fave has got to be the cookies and cream cookie. This paired with a glass of milk would make Santa Claus one happy fellow!

They were really nice and even recognized some of the other people that came in during our time there. Definitely felt like a neighborhood joint where everyone knows everyone, which I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing in SF up until this point. \n\nAnyway, the cute chalkboard menu was on the northern wall of the shop and the cookie lineup was super long. There were maybe 20 options listed, although only 5-10 of them were available when we came in (identified by checkmarks next to them). There was also milk to go along, ice cream and a couple drinks to choose from.\n\nWe ended up going for a German Chocolate cookie, which had nuts in it and had a really interesting texture. We also ordered an oatmeal cranberry cookie which was wonderful as well. \n\nThe only downside was the pricing, as these two cookies were 2 inches in diameter each (pretty small, 2 bite cookie) and cost 2 dollars each. There was a larger option for a little more, but it was hard for us to stomach 2 dollars a cookie when we can make huge delicious cookies for a fraction of the price at home. Even so, it was worth visiting, and I would recommend stopping by and spending hard-earned cash on the more exotic varieties of cookie.\n\nThanks to Anthony for the welcoming atmosphere and great cookies! I'm sure we'll be back.", "author": "John B."}

All of them were delicious and even yummy a few days later.  My ultimate favorite was their cookies and cream flavor.  It is a must get.  The only one that was different than the others was the peanut butter flavor because of how brittle it was.

I really enjoyed both! I like how the cookies can be crispy and a bit tough in a sense where there's a short snap to each bite. It's honestly what I prefer as oppose to those soft-baked textures. My favorite was their cookies & cream because it has that nice milky taste which is delicious. Cookies here range in price but for about $2/cookie which can be a bit pricey but they're gourmet so it makes sense.

The german was okay for me, it was loaded with nuts. \n\nOverall, I think I will have to opt this place. Quality was not how I expected. I really had high expectations for this place.

I came in for my first time on 10\\5\\17 and was greeted by a lovely gentleman, and was given a sample of the white chocolate (YUM)!\n\nThe menu was so easy to read and straight to the point. The flavors are all listed on the menu; based on what they have, they will add a checkmark next to the flavor. Anthony's offers 1oz and 2oz cookies. The 2oz are only available Monday, Wednesday and Fridays. They advertise their \"special flavors\" of: Walnut Choc Chip and Dark Chocolate, and also have gluten free chocolate chip cookies. \n\nPrices: \n1oz=$1.85\n2oz=$3.70\n\nMy favorite flavors are: White Chocolate, Oatmeal Raisin, and Cookies & Cream. Not only do they taste delicious, but they are soft and chewy (just how I like it)! The inside is nice and spacious. They also sale milk, located in the refrigerator (by the cashier). The inside offers a nice comfy feel. Limited seating; but many people don't hang around anyways. \n\nIt truly melted my heart when I found out that Anthony's gives any leftover cookies for the day to non-profits. \n\nI rarely have a sweet tooth, but when I do, I will make sure to pick me up some of those tasty, scrumptious cookies from Anthony's!", "author": "Porsche C."}

For the cookies and cream cookie, you rarely ever see anyone selling those, but wow the flavor and texture is amazing. Also, the way they look all pretty and marbled hints to you that it's a good cookie. The chocolate chip is classic and I don't know what they add to the cookie, but they're addictive. It's really all you want in a cookie - chewy in the middle and a little crispy but chewy on the outside. \n\nThe line can sometimes go out the door, but it really is worth the wait. You just know that the cookie is going to be amazing right when you walk through the door and see the simplistic decor and smell the oven baked cookies. Yes, the cookies are priced highly and the size of the cookie isn't the biggest but you could see how high quality the cookie is and that's all that matters.

The chocolate chip cookie wasn't that impressive so I was a bit disappointed. The peanut butter cookie however was a whole different story. They had a board dedicated to saying that the peanut butter cookie had returned, which means this was probably a really good and popular choice. When I bit into it, it pretty much just melted in my mouth. The texture was unlike any other cookie I have ever tasted. It was so soft and rich and tasted just the perfect amount of peanut butter. I wanted to get another one but I stopped myself haha but it was really good. I highly recommend people to get the peanut butter cookie if you love peanut butter.", "author": "Catherine S."}

My husband and I have been getting cookies from Anthony's for almost the entire duration of our relationship - that's 10 years! You really can't go wrong with a box of these incredible cookies - the cookies are crispy on the outside and super chewy and delicious on the inside. What's super crazy is that every single time we pick up another dozen - the cookie never fails to still wow us. \n\nOur favorite flavors include Cookies and Cream, Toffee, Chocolate Chip, and White Chocolate Chip... but, to be honest. All of the cookies are REALLY REALLY GOOD. \n\nThe inside hasn't changed much over the years. It's definitely had upgrades though! The set up makes it easy for lines to never feel crammed and there's a long farm table with long bench for you to sit and enjoy your cookies. \n\nYou have to try Anthony's Cookies if you're in SF.. they're the BEST COOKIES IN SF.

If I ever find myself in the Mission District, rest assured, I'll find the shortest and most efficient route to Anthony's. While I've tried other classic combinations like the toffee chip and the chocolate chip, I have been consistently impressed with the Cookies and Creme. The crunchy texture, the softer interior, and cookies and creme flavor without the overpowering chocolate chips make this the ultimate cookie. The only qualm I have at this location is that I cannot request a batch of cookies in advance. I have tried (maybe more than a couple of times) to order on the phone, but have been politely declined. Hopefully, this will change in the future!\n\nLong story short, get yourself over to Anthony's cookies and buy a dozen of the Cookies and Creme (or don't because they are so addictive).", "author": "Jessica E."}

They are what cookie lovers dreams are made of. \n\nThe BFF (best foodie friend), Yelp bestie, lover of food, and all around cool chick (when and why did we start putting labels on EVERYTHING and EVERYONE?!) told me about these when I asked her for some SF recs. She had only tried the choco chip ones and said they were worth the hassle. I trust her tastebuds, so off I went. \n\nUpon arrival, I KNEW it would be good. Why? It's just a small shop with one register selling nothing but cookies. Yup, JUST COOKIES! Well, milk and coffee too, but those don't count, darn it. And the smell, lordy lord the smell. Cookie heaven! Many varieties and diff ones each day. There's a list on the wall of which cookies and sizes of said cookies are available for the day. Choose wisely!\n\nI ordered a dozen with a mix of choco chip, cookies and cream, toffee chip, and white choco chip. After receiving my nicely packed box I sat down to try one and immediately got up to order another dozen. I'm a glutton, but one who loves to share good finds with friends! They weren't ALL for me ;p \n\nChoco Chip: Delicious! The \"one ounce\" smaller sized cookie was perfect in size, taste, and texture. Best in the west and small enough so you don't feel too guilty after devouring it. Who doesn't love choco chip cookies?! Tied for my second fav at this shop!\n\nCookies and Cream: My fav of the bunch. Ugh. I die. SorryNOTsorry, my new \"blonder\" hair got me thinking, speaking, and acting like a basic b*tch. Whatevs! Creamy, chewy, and not TOO sweet. I'm craving these as I type. Le sigh. Anyone going to SF soon? Bring me some cookies please, I'll be your best friend, sister, lover, wait... Scratch that last one! No. No. No. We can be friends tho, right ;)\n\nToffee Chip: Crunchy bits between chewy cookie bites. A tie for second fav. I love toffee, but only in small doses cuz it's usually too sweet. These cookies however were fantastic! Anyone else hate those small bits of toffee that get stuck on your molars tho? I'm always shoving my tongue back there to \"flick\" it off. Wait, that don't sound right. Hehe. Don't mind me. \n\nWhite Choco: Too sweet. I knew they would be. Texture was on point (or \"on fleek\" as the young kids say) like the rest tho. I'm sure the \"on fleek\" kids would love these cuz kids love sweet things (thangs? What's the diff? Someone explain it please. Lol) right? \n\nIf you live near here, I hate you! Please send cookies... Pretty please?! Kidding, sorta ;p", "author": "Grace C."}

It did have a good coffee flavor and a nice chewy texture, but definitely steep for the size.\nI do appreciate that the cookies are baked fresh, but for the price, you would expect that.

Upon walking in, the bakery was smaller than expected, but there were trays and trays full of freshly baked cookies stacked high in the kitchen. Counters decorated with many Straus milk bottles, I couldn't help but wonder what it'd be like during an earthquake...\n\nTo me, baked cookies are like salads and chicken dishes at restaurants - why would I buy something I can make so easily myself at home for a fraction of the price? I'm no cookie snob, but THE BEST texture and consistency for a cookie is a crispy, almost airy circumference and a soft, chewy, and very moist middle. Anthony's Cookies fit my ideal cookie description perfectly, but for a whomping $1.75 per piece, I restricted myself to purchasing only six flavors - cookies and cream, chocolate chip, dark chocolate chip, double dark chocolate chip, toffee chip, and cinnamon sugar.\n\nEveryone raves about the cookies and cream, and I must admit, it was one of my favorites too. Other standouts were the toffee chip, which was sweet and delicious, and the cinnamon, which was very fragrant but not too strong.\n\nThe cookies were very fresh, and quality ingredients were used. Most flavors are offered in two sizes: 1 oz or 2 oz.\n\nWere Anthony's Cookies delicious? Yes. But absolutely mind-blowing? Not so much.

The toffee one is a close second. Cookies are the best of the soft and chewy, yet crispy combo. \n\nPrice is a little steep per cookie, but look, once you have the best, you'll never want to settle for less.

At the time of the review they were $1.75 (they are also 1oz in weight each)\n\nTried (and stack ranked from best to worst -- none were bad, but not as great):\n\nGerman chocolate: One of the mound cookies and it was incredible! Soft and chewy and filled with cocoa, coconut and chocolate. A tough combination to beat.\n\nToffee chip: One of the flat cookies. A little crispy on the outside but the middle was chewy and deliciously caramelized with toffee. It was a subtle sweetness that felt right.\n\nCookies and cream: Another flat cookie that was oreo-like in taste but with the chewiness of a chocolate chip dough. Honestly I wasn't very impressed with this and thought it was a bit dry.\n\nCandied pecan and chocolate chip: A mound cookies that was chewy and nutty. The chocolate chips didn't add to the experience but the candied pecans were yum!\n\nChocolate chip: A staple cookie that I get everywhere because it really speaks to how well the cookie dough is. Unimpressive as I thought the chocolate chips and the dough were separate entities and didn't fit well together. It was sweet and chewy but nothing spectacular. \n\nWhite chocolate: The white chocolate chips were small and felt separated from the overall cookie. Just tasted like a sweet cookie with bits of creaminess mixed in. Not impressed\n\nCinnamon spice: The closest they have to a snickerdoodle.

While in line I decided on the toffee and the uniquely popular cookies and cream. My friend got the chocolate chip... We headed to their one and only (communal) table and I had already sample one of each cookie plus I was working on trying my friends chocolate chip. All three were delicious! I walked straight to the counter and order a box to take home! \n\nIf you ask for a sample they cut you a piece of the cookie to try (I tried the white chocolate chip, also good).\n\n$1.50 per cookie (on the smaller side)\n\nNo extra discounts when purchasing a dozen\n\nShout out to the cashier Friday afternoon!!!

It is a bit pricey at $18 for a dozen, but they are certainly quality cookies that I don't mind spending some dough (ha) on.\n\nThe menu changes daily, but some of my favorites are the white chocolate chip, cookies and cream, toffee and the classic chocolate chip.

What Anthony's does best is bring you fresh-baked, straight-from-Grandma's-kitchen  type cookies that are exactly what you'd hope for in terms of texture and taste. They're crisp and caramelized on the edge, chewy and moist in the middle, and have a distinct flavor that is representative of the name. Not too much to ask for, but you'd be surprised with how many places can't get this right! \n\nHonestly, many Yelpers describe Anthony's as life-changing and the \"best cookies they've ever had\" which in my opinion is merely sugar-coated hyperbole. They're great cookies, don't get me wrong, but they're not anything particularly special. You won't find daring combinations like Cayenne Cocoa at Hot Cookie, or Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow at Momofuku, and they don't have the wow factor of chunky Specialty's cookies. However, they do have a couple unique cookie types that bring some childhood nostalgia to the table, including Toffee Chip and Cookies 'n Cream. These two are my favorites, along with White Chocolate Chip! \n\nAt $1.50 a pop, these little buggers are pretty pricey, considering how they fit in the palm of your hand. They cost almost as much as a macaron, and they're pretty much the same size. However, Anthony's cookies are quite delicious and I do think they're worth it every once in awhile. \n\nThe shop is clean and simple, equipped with a large picnic style wooden bench, a fridge full of milk, and a chalk board that lists the flavors of the day. As a seasoned baker, I came in with high expectations and Anthony's came pretty close. They're a solid, reliable bakery with excellent cookies, but because of their lack of unique combos and small cookie size, I can't quite give them 5 stars. Definitely check 'em out if you haven't already though. You won't be disappointed!", "author": "Deanna Y."}

If that doesn't work with you then you can try to find other street parking that are limited to 2 hours. \n\nOnce you step inside, you pretty much see everything that there is to see. The register is in front of you and behind that is the kitchen where the magic happens. There's 2 menus of different cookie options and then a 3rd menu of everything else they offer. There's one table to sit at and that's that. They sell bottled milk for $5 which I thought was a nice touch. \n\nI've visited this place twice already and got to try their double chocolate walnut, regular chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and their cookies & cream cookies. To be honest, double chocolate walnut and oatmeal raisin weren't my first choice, but they just happened and they were definitely good. My only real problem was that I found their chocolate chip cookie to be way too sweet, and I can usually handle sweet things! \n\nService is friendly and patient so you can take your time deciding what you want.

The problem when you step into this place is trying to figure not just which cookies you are getting, it's trying to figure out just how many of each you are getting. I ordered one dozen cookies and in the end i realize it wasn't enough. I realize i can finish all these cookies within the hour, ok maybe half an hour. I ordered 1 dozen cookies for the cost of 15.00.  If you order a premium cookie such as double chocolate chip, it cost .50 cents more. There's what i ordered\n\n3 cookies n cream\n3 toffee\n3 oatmeal raisin \n2 chocolate chip\n1 chocolate with walnuts\n\nThe chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin was both chewy and soft. But i felt that there was a hint of peanut butter. It also tasted like there was peanut butter in the toffee one, but that didn't stop me. I still loved it.  The best of the best just had to be the cookies and cream one. I think i can finish 2 dozen of this on my own? Don't believe me? Buy me 2 dozen of these and I'll show you.  I was expecting it to be super sweet but it turned out just perfect. I love just how soft it is and you can really taste the freshness. These were far the best cookies I've ever had.

There is one table inside that can fit one small group.\n\nService: The server was on top of her orders, when 3 other groups ranging from 203 people came in she picked up the pace while still serving us in a polite manner.\n\nFood: (Regular Chocolate Chip | Cinnamon Spice | Peanut Butter | Cookies and Cream)\nIn terms of flavor, the cookies and cream stood out to me. Everything else tasted just the like other cookies BUT the texture of was soft and chewy.\n\nOverall: I CURRENTLY give this a 4.5. I am holding off on the other 1/2 a point because as delightful the cookies were, I wasn't impressed with the more simple cookies. I still need to try their milk and other unique cookies (Please stay tuned for an updated review). In summation, the customer service was pleasing, the service was fast, and the cookies memorable. If you're ever visiting San Francisco, I recommend to take a quick brean for this sweet treat.\n\n**Tip: Buy in bulk then mix and match to sample as many flavors as you can**", "author": "Leland S."}

Unfortunately, I was not at all impressed. Sure, it tasted good...but maybe all of the hype got my expectations too high. I have definitely had much better cookies.\n\nThe cookies here are mostly very small also, which is not necessarily a bad thing, as it makes it easier to try a variety of cookies. But they were surprisingly small.\n\nBoth their Candied Pecan Chocolate Chip and Walnut Double Chocolate Chip were better than the Cookies & Cream. The Toffee Chip was not so great though. This was one of their bigger cookies, but it was flatter and not as chewy, which is a big downside (they actually probably all contained about the same amount of batter, but the Toffee Chip was just flattened out more).\n\nCookies are pretty much my favorite food, so I find it hard to give a cookie shop below 3 stars, but I would not necessarily recommend this place. As long as you don't mind running the risk of seeing some bottomless men walking around with their junk hanging out, I would highly recommend instead heading over to Hot Cookie in the Castro for some amazing cookies, where they also have plenty of peanut butter.

I had my first visit almost four years ago and have been a willing addict ever since.  Much like the other reviewers, my favorite is the cookies and cream. Moist, right amount of sweetness, and the perfect size for repeat bites, it captures the essence of what a cookie (within a cookie) should be. Call ahead first. The cookies and cream will usually run out before the end of the day.  But you can't go wrong with any of the other selections.  \n\nI had the pleasure of meeting THE Anthony.  My girlfriend was walking out of the store.  A box of a dozen cookies and cream in her hand.  I'm circling around to park.  She's waving, smiling at me. General merriment that accompanies you once you've visited the shop.   My girlfriend trips and rolls her ankle awkwardly on the steps. Cookies go flying in every way.   I'm running out of the car.  Pandemonium on the streets.  People are screaming.  Kids are crying.  The clouds reverberate with thunder.  Hail falls from the sky.  Locusts are descending onto the sidewalk.  Anthony runs out of the store to help my girlfriend up and offers us shelter.  I ask for an ice bag and Anthony gives it to me without issue. Now girlfriend and I are chilling in the store with an ice bag on her rolled ankle and a box of cookies and cream. \n\nAnthony is a cool dude.  Awesome cookie lord by day.  Probably same cookie lord at night.", "author": "Huy D."}

I took BART and walked over a mile alone in a seedy area of SF to this place so I was extremely dismayed. That didn't stop me from ordering $78 worth of cookies though.\n\nTo be fair, not all of them were for me. I did get 2 dozens for work and a few for myself. The best cookies by far were the cookies and cream. They lasted a few days too without being refrigerated. I had a cookie 3 days later and it was still moist.\n\nThe place is small but there are tables for you to sit inside. They don't make a whole lot at a time so you might want to call ahead if you want a large order. I ended up waiting about 15 minutes total before they could get all the cookies I wanted together and I pretty much cleaned them out.\n\nThe cookies are on the smaller size and they're not cheap at $1.25 each. I would say get a few to sample but don't waste too much of your money getting a whole bunch.

My trip back home just wouldn't be complete without it. My taste buds would never forgive me. I brought a friend with me who's a self-proclaimed cookie monster & I assured him he would love the cookies. I also told him if he was smart, he would bring some back to LA to his wife. He bought a dozen. He loved the cookies & cream (who wouldn't) & also got chocolate chip & toffee chip. He & his wife liked those as well. \n\nI opted for 3 dozen because I planned on those being my other carry-on for my flight back to LA the next night. I went with 2 dozen cookies & cream, 6 toffee chip & 6 candied pecan. I must say, as good as the cookies & cream are... the candied pecan is slowly becoming my favorite. I just wish the cookies were bigger.\n\nThere was a sign on one of the chalkboards introducing a new COFFEE COOKIE. It described it as made with 72% dark chocolate & hand pressed coffee. It sounded delicious to me and it was new so I asked the girl behind the counter to put two coffee cookies aside in a bag separate from the 2 boxes containing the 3 dozen cookies I ordered. I asked for the boxes to be string-tied closed. 1 because it's an old school touch that I like when buying baked goods such as the Jewish bakery I go to in Fairfax District here in LA and 2 because it will ensure that I do not open it before I get home. HA! It works... The cookies stay pristine. I leave em alone. \n\nThe problem was when I got back to my hotel that night. I noticed the separate bag for the 2 coffee cookies was missing. I feared she forgot to give them to me. I checked my receipt & I was charged for them. Not cheap $1.75 per coffee cookie... So I hoped, had my fingers crossed that they were in one of the boxes. I still didn't want to untie the string... Maybe I should have. I was headed to the Niner game the next am so there was no time to go back to Anthony's anyway. It was a morning til evening affair at the stadium... Alas, when I got home, I discovered there were no coffee cookies. I was bummed... Also was bummed for my friend Kat T. who asked me to bring her 1 coffee cookie home. She was bummed & suggested I call them.\n\nSo I called Anthony's when I got back to LA... Im usually not the complaining type but I felt the need to call & just let them know what happened so they can be more careful in the future. I spoke to Anna the business manager of Anthony's. She heard me out as I told her what happened. I told her I didn't want anyone to get in trouble. That wasn't the reason for my phone call... She was very pleasant to talk to, actually. She wanted to know what happened so she could advise her staff/front counter lead so that something like this wouldn't happen again. She asked for my email... She emailed me soon after we talked offering her sincerest apologies & thanked me for bringing the incident to their attention... They would use it to improve their service... I can tell you that Anna rectified the situation. She went beyond my expectations as far as service recovery & hearing me out. I appreciated that.\n\nThat's why these are the types of businesses I will always support... Anthony's Cookies being in my hometown & making the best damn cookies I've ever had are just icing on the cookie. Please go there... Go there now. Save me some.", "author": "Chuck D."}

Not only do these cookies hold a sentimental value to me, but they're absolutely delicious. \n\nI've only tried 3 kinds here, which includes the cookies and cream, toffee, and a snickerdoodle type. If I can't just have the cookies and cream and toffee from here, I would be beyond happy. Crispy around the edges, chewy towards the center, and perfect all around. Another thing that I love about these cookies are that they're not made too sweet. Perfect with a cup of milk.

Cookie competition is stiff.\n\nWhy do these cookies look so damn big in pictures?  Yelpers' photos make them look like the size of my palm but in reality, they have a diameter of about 2.5\".  They each cost $1.25 with the exception of some \"special\" ones that cost $1.50.\n\nNow, the chocolate chip cookie was really sweet.  With a little more salt, I feel like the cookie could be more balanced.  I also had this cookie at relatively cold, room temperature because it was closer to the end of the day.  That added to the overall underwhelming feeling.\n\nI also tried the German Chocolate cookie which I'm guessing, by it's name, should have some combination of three things: 1) chocolate, 2) coconut, and 3) pecans.  The cookie's base was chocolate bit definitely a more cake-like texture.  The coconut bits were inside but I do not remember pecans.

I tried 3 of their cookies: Cookies and cream, Toffee Crunch, and their Oatmeal chocolate chip. \n\nFirst off, I want to say these taste like any ordinary homemade cookies. So yes they are better than store bought cookies, but you could easily make your own favorite cookies at home (but yes, you would have a batch of like 2 dozen cookies you would have to eat or share). However, if these cookies aren't freshly baked/warm, then their taste/texture gets exponentially... worse.\n\nSo flavors, Their cookies and cream is definitely the best, It tastes more like the cookies part of an oreo than the cream, so it has the crunch factor, The Toffee crunch did not have the crunchy toffee that I was expecting. It was more like a flavor with bits of softish toffee mixed in? And the Oatmeal chocolate chip, tasted a bit cinnamon-y?

In doing some (serious) research into the cookie situation in SF, I concluded that no matter what the circumstances were, I was determined to come here based on the reviews I had read and all of the Instagram cookie porn you could imagine. Showing up here without a game plan was ill advised though, I was overwhelmed with the delicious smell of baked butter, sugar, and flour, and I seriously contemplated buying one of everything on their chalkboard menu.  Needless to say, I curbed myself into ordering just three: Cookies and Cream (which came recommended by a co-worker who had Anthony's Cookies at her wedding), the Toffee Chip Cookie (recommended by 7x7's The Big Sweet), and a personal favorite of mine, the classic Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Out of the three, the Toffee Chip was probably my favorite, followed by a close second in the Cookies and Cream.  My husband being a huge Oreo fan absolutely loved the Cookies and Cream, and both of us agreed that if we were to eat these fresh out of the oven, it'd be heavenly and sinful all at the same time.

I was celebrating my birthday this past Saturday, and used the afternoon to gather up every treat in my path in preparation for a delicious night of sinful gluttony. \n\nI found my way over to Anthony's mid-afternoon. Parking wasn't much of an issue but I'm sure half the city was down in the Marina celebrating Fleet Week so it may have been a fluke. I was practically running down the sidewalk while my boyfriend fed the meter, but when I got to the storefront the door was locked. It was around 2PM and the sign said they closed at 5. So I jiggled the door handle a little harder because I could see a few employees and one customer milling about inside. I peered in through the glass as everyone looked at me in disgust as if I were a pathetic stray puppy begging for scraps. I'm not one to give up in these situations. If they were hoping I'd wander off to some other cookie dispensary, they were mistaken. My desire for cookies trumped my annoyance that none of the employees could bother themselves to open the door. \n\nAbout 5-10 minutes later, the customer left the store and I made my move. By this time, a few other people joined the resistance outside and we flooded in ready to get our fix. \n\nI ordered the much-hyped cookies and cream, a German chocolate, peanut butter, white chocolate chip, chocolate chip, and a coffee cookie for the bf. I was a little surprised at how small they were for the price, but that just meant I had more room for more cookies so I was cool with it. \n\nTo say I was let down is an understatement. I've never met a cookie I didn't like, and that was no exception here, but they weren't really that great. My boyfriend actually took a bite of the coffee and threw the rest out, but I hate coffee myself so I can't really comment further on that. The cookies and cream was pretty good and the only one I actually finished. Everything else was a resounding Meh. They were a little too crunchy and dry for my taste - like crouton cookies. I prefer the gooier, softer, chewier kind. I could whip up cookies myself that are better than this. \n\nFor everyone on here claiming these are the best cookies you've ever had... do you eat a lot of cookies?

I tend to buy them double-stuffed, throw away half of the cookie, and much on the double cream layer atop one chocolate cookie. Recently, I discovered Golden Oreo Cookies, where I don't really have to do much of anything to them, but then I miss out on the chocolate flavor.\n\nThis is where Anthony's Cookies come in -- hands down the best cookies I've ever had. Their Cookies & Cream are so delicious and the perfect blend of soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. AND--- It is the first cookie I've had that I love drinking milk with! It also doesn't hurt that the organic milk they have at the store is really good quality.T heir packaging and bags are really cute here too and would make great presents if you're having a hard time thinking of something.\n\nSome of the flavors I didn't appreciate as much: White Chocolate Chip (wish they had macadamian nuts and I didn't like the white chocolate so much), Oatmeal Raisin (Mother's Iced Oatmeal does it for me better) and Toffee Chip (my sister told me I should have waited a day to eat it, tastes better). Boyfriend really likes the Cinnamon Spice, but I can only have one at a time since they are a bit too on the \"spice\" side for me.\n\nI used to work for Mrs. Fields where the cookies are frozen and then put in the oven and way more expensive.

We bought nine cookies altogether, 2 of the 2oz cookies and 7 regular sized cookies.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-04", "description": "I seem to have a justification for everything: eating, drinking, partying, drinking, shopping, partying....YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, SO WHY NOT?\n\nOn Saturday, 5.1, after my friends and I gorged ourselves at Pizzeria Delfina and then topped it off with Bi-Rite, I still had the audacity to ask, \"Do you still want Anthony's Cookies?\" You see, one of my friend's had mentioned Anthony's Cookies to me several weeks back and ever since then I've been seeing FB posts about them. I guess it was a sign? Haa Haa! Anyways, it was on the way home, so we thought what the hell, let's go!\n\nWe arrived at 4 PM to a near empty store. Uh-oh, I thought....I hope they still have the Cookies and Cream left as I've heard they tend to sell out first.\n\nFLAVORS (varies by day):\n*Cookies and Cream: Everyday\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: Everyday\n*Walnut Chocolate Chip: Everyday\n*White Chocolate Chip: Everyday\n*Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin: Everyday\n*Whole Wheat Oatmeal Cranberry\n*Toffee Chip: Everyday\n*Cinnamon Sugar: Everyday\n*Double Chocolate Chip: Mon, Fri, Sat\n*Peanut Butter: Tues, Wed, Thurs, Sat\n*German Chocolate: Mon, Fri, Sat\n*Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: Fri, Sat, Sun\n*Banana Walnut: Thurs, Sun\n*Banana: Thurs, Sun\n\nPRICES: \n*$1.25/cookie\n*$6 for 6 cookies\n*$11 for a dozen\n*$5 for each add'l dozen\n\nCC's accepted.\n\nI decided to get a dozen and went w/ the following flavors:\n*Cookies and Cream: Ummm, OMFG! How can a cookie be thin, crispy, soft, chewy, and gooey all at the same time?!?!? Well, it looks like Anthony has managed to do this. As you bite into the cookie, it's crisp and as you chew it, it's soft and doughy in the center. It's super buttery and there's Oreo Cream tidbits in the cookie which had a burst of creamy sweetness when you bit into it. Sooooo Goood....\n\n*Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip: YUMMY! It has the same texture as the Cookies and Cream. Even though it was room temp, the chocolate morsels poured out like lava when I tore the cookie in half. The cookie was buttery and the chocolate morsels was decandent and added just the right amount of sweetness.  \n\n*Toffee Chip: YUMMY! Similar to the Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip Cookie but with crispy buttery toffee tidbits through out. It was like eating a cookie version of an Almond Roca w/o the almonds. \n\n*Oatmeal Chocolate Chip: It was ok! This was a bulkier cookie compared to the others. There were bits of real oats which gave it a grainy texture and the chocolate chips helped balanced out the slight saltiness from the oats. \n\nSERVICE:\nAnthony, himself was there baking his OWN cookies no less. You can really tell he's passionate about what he does. While he's manning the cookies in the back, he still has the time to genuinely greet all his customers. More independently owned busineeses need to take note on this. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:  \nContemporary, yet rustic. The space itself is very clean and bright. There's ivory walls with brown and red trimmings and old milk bottles displayed throughout the side walls around the cash register/open kitchen area.\n\nThere's 2 picnic table tables where you can sit and enjoy your cookies and milk. There are no restrooms.\n\nPARKING:\nSlightly difficult street parking, although it's not as bad as around the Valencia area btw 15th and 23rd Streets. \n\nIt's only been 3 days and I'm already trying to find an excuse to hit up \"The Mission\", so I can buy another dozen to take home. Since I can't use my usual justification...ummm, Cinco De Mayo celebration in The Mission anyone? LoL!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I read about this place somewhere on yahoo where it was rated top 10 cookie places to try. I had it on my list to try. I was near there and decided to try it. OMG!!!! Best cookies and so fresh. I ordered lots of chocolate chip, white chocolate, toffee cookie, oat meal, cinnamon spice, walnut chip and cookies and cream and all were very very very VERY delicious.  I think my favorite one was the toffee cookie.  One annoying thing I had encountered was the day before I went I tried to order 30 cookies because I thought they might be sold out of some. I called in, no answer. I called in again at a later time, no answer. I tried at least 6 to 8 times calling no answer and voice mail was full. I tried emailing them and never heard back from them. When I showed up to see if they had got my email I was told the person that gets the emails was not there so my order didn't bother to get looked at. Something needs to change there. Have a better system where people can pre-order. Maybe have it online where people can order the cookies or at least have someone always answering the phone(s). I thought it was very rude on that part.  Don't worry---your cookies are too good to pass up. i'll be back some day!!", "author": "Meg O."}

In fact, I tend to dislike most cookies, and after one bite, put the rest down and walk away.  I'd much rather a slice of chocolate cake any day.\n\nThat said, Anthony's Cookies actually make me want to eat cookies!!  They are flavorful, rich, not too sweet (at least, not the flavors I like), and so fresh, I can't resist!\n\nI'm especially partial to the DOUBLE CHOCOLATE CHIP cookies and the DARK CHOCOLATE CHIP ones...but I also enjoyed the COOKIES & CREAM and WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIP varieties.  \n\nThe GERMAN CHOCOLATE cookie was interesting, but I wouldn't list it among my favorites...and I've yet to get there on one of the days when I can get a PEANUT BUTTER cookie...but I will someday, trust me!\n\nThat's the other thing:  they only offer certain flavors all the time (cookies & cream, classic chocolate chip, white chocolate chip, whole wheat oatmeal raisin, and toffee chip).  The rest of the flavors depend on the day.  I think that Wednesday is my ideal day at Anthony's, when theoretically I can get ALL the flavors I like!\n\nThe cookies aren't huge, and I think that's part of the joy.  You don't have to commit to just one flavor, and you don't have to deal with a gigantic cookie if all you want is something small.  \n\nThis store is sadly NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE.  It's a shame, really, but I'm pretty sure that if you require access, they'll come to the door to assist you directly.  My partner usually goes in for me, or grabs them on the way home from work.\n\nTheir store hours make me happy, as they are open until 8 pm Mon-Sat...that means that those folks who work a little later in the evening can still get a cookie or two on their way home!  \n\nIf you are a cookie lover, check this place out.  I'd imagine that Anthony's Cookies might even convert a few other folks like me (ie, not generally into cookies) to the cause!!", "author": "Amy L."}

I bring Anthony's into my office to thank my staff for a job well done.  I still love the way the cookies taste, they are definitely five star!\n\nWell, why the downgrade?  One thing: the price.  I've been coming to Anthony's for several years now and have seen the price steadily creep up.  First the prices increase.  Then the frequent buyer card goes away.  Finally they do away with the price breaks.  Same price per cookie ($1.25) if you're buying a half dozen, dozen, two dozen, etc.  I promised two dozen to my office and was shocked when I calculated it would be $30.  I thought about not buying them, but ended up buying anyway since I had already promised them.  Looks like the Anthony's rewards for my office will be fewer and farther between...\n\nAnthony, many bakeries give discounts when you buy in bulk.  I can understand you raising prices but no quantity discount?  Read your recent yelp reviews- many of the folks are complaining about the price.  I love the fact that a local place (and one that just serves cookies at that) is thriving, but I'd hate to see your yelp ratings go down or have folks like me stop coming because they feel \"priced out\".

I was in the neighborhood at 11:30am on a Sunday morning, and I decided that cookies were the right thing to do. \n\nI've had an Anthony's cookie before, but I'd never actually been to the shop. It's pretty inconspicuous; I would have strolled right by it had I not known it was where it was. It's a pretty small shop, with relatively bare walls and one long table. Not that ambiance matters when you know what tastiness lies on those cookie sheets behind the counter!\n\nI paid $15.50 for 4 cookies n cream, 4 chocolate chip, 2 dark chocolate, 1 toffee chip, and 1 walnut chip. I remembered that the cookies were pretty small, but I had forgotten just how small, so I would say that they are a bit overpriced. But what they lack in size, they make up for in flavor and texture.\n\nCookies n cream: These seem to be the favorite for most reviewers. While I thought they were delicious, I was slightly underwhelmed by the texture. There was more of a crunch than I expected; I was hoping for a bit more chew. These cookies are also a little thinner than the other cookies. Don't get me wrong, I will still order these next time...I just think they could be better with a little more chew.\n\nChocolate chip: A cookie shop *needs* to have a solid chocolate chip. Thankfully, Anthony's does it right! Lots of quality chocolate throughout with the perfect chewiness. \n\nDark chocolate: A more \"adult\" version of their classic chocolate chip, these are made with dark chocolate disks rather than chips. Also very good, especially for a dark chocolate fan like myself.\n\nToffee chip: I have been obsessed with toffees and brittles during pregnancy, so this was absolutely amazing to my tastebuds. I wish I had ordered more than one!\n\nWalnut chip: this one was rather unremarkable. Not bad or anything...I just don't remember how I felt about it while eating it, and I only had it yesterday.\n\nI will be back again very soon, preferably before the baby comes. I had ordered a dozen cookies, and one day later, they're all gone =(. I won't tell you how many (few, really) I shared with my partner. Oops.", "author": "Leigh R."}

The call went straight to voicemail asking that I go to their website & email them, so I did. I called the next morning to ask about my email order and the guy told me, \"We haven't checked it and I need a credit card with the order.\" I told him my call the previous day went straight to voicemail and I did what was asked. Getting nowhere, I asked if they had all of their cookies available. Long story short, I drove over and placed my order. I wanted to plate the cookies on a platter that I brought into Anthony's. The guy behind the counter told me they couldn't do that and I couldn't do it either inside their store. This made no sense as I told him I'd pay for the cookies then plate them and then buy more if needed. He wouldn't allow it. I left with nothing but an empty cookie platter. \nI drove to Draegers San Mateo. The bakery guy, Cody plated my cookies and even gave me extra doilies. He didn't seem to think it was a big deal or an odd request. And the cookies which weighed more than Anthony's 1 ounce cookies are 95 cents each.\nI was an early customer of Anthony's, even followed them on Twitter and recommended them to my friend for his birthday celebration where he bought over 1,000 cookies.\n\nYou've lost my business and my referrals for refusing to help me or let me plate my cookies at one of your tables.", "author": "Janet P."}

When the bakery becomes fully operational we'll probably see tables and chairs to sit at and assorted beverages served to go with Anthony's outstanding cookies.  Without a doubt the door or window will probably sport a bright red \"People Love Us on Yelp\" decal.\n\nAnthony comes across as a man who takes pride in his cookies, in the thirteen years of experience he has in creating these cookies and in the quality of the ingredients of his cookies.  I stopped in shortly after his store opened on Thursday morning and purchased two dozen cookies to take back to the office to share with my co-workers.  Anthony's Cookies currently offers 12 exciting flavors of cookies which are sold by the half dozen.  Here is an image of his offerings and prices as of April 2009 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=fX99YW7vxoa7hQjO2IPQoQ).  You are welcome to mix and match flavors to your desire.\n\nThe cookies are between 2-1/2 to 3 inches in diameter.  Anthony asked whether I could try a cookie in the store before I left and let him know what I thought.  I sampled a Cookies and Cream.  The edges of the still warm cookie were nice and crispy, and the interior of the cookie was nice and chewy.  I loved the contrast between the two.  The cookie was sweet without being overly sweet.  I wished I had a tall, cold glass of milk right then and there.  It would have been the perfect milk and cookies scenario.\n\nI purchased four flavors on this visit, and I've included photos of each.\n\nCookies and Cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=nghb57S-WlCQeayzJiw4EQ) - Unique and different.  The cookies are made with crushed Oreo cookies mixed into the base cookie batter.  These were the absolute favorites.  Had I known I would have hidden these from my co-workers.\n\nToffee Chip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=776m0nIU8bmU8CzpgmpkLg) - These cookies were crispier than the others.  Bits of butter toffee are melted into the cookie batter to give the cookie its excellent butter toffee flavor.\n\nCinnamon Sugar (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=57_GBexV9-qN8jHetM3IhQ) - The cookie had just a hint of cinnamon flavor.  These were dusted with very fine sugar crystals.  I think these would be perfect to jumpstart a lazy morning.  My co-workers agreed as they only left me half a cookie.  \n\nDouble Chocolate Chip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PrlH7YcQ22m9DyuWbxJjMA?select=2pHRiyQ3pwzM_0FKGeMqvw) - It's a chocolate cookie with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I only sampled a quarter of one as my co-workers apparently loved this one also.\n\nI'll be returning soon to pick up some cookies for myself and the family to enjoy.  As there is no store sign up yet look for the address number and the cookie flyer adhered to the window.  For now, I believe it is cash only.  Please give Anthony's Cookies a try, and show Anthony some Yelper love!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Minus stars for that  since I wasn't expecting their stock to be so miniscule when they open until 8pm per yelp (this may or may not be justified but it annoyed me). More minus stars for the tiny lump of cookie that cost me $1.25. Yes, the Oatmeal walnut chip I decided on out the remaining options was good, but not amazing. \n\nSo what can be learned from my experience? Come early and expect to pay premium prices for roughly 3 bites of cookie. \n\nI'll probably come back just so I can try some of their more popular options, like the cookies and cream.

It's amazing, like eating an oreo, but it's mixed in with a cookie. Not so much cream but still my favorite.\nToffee: A little bit chewy but not too chewy. Toffee wasn't exactly evident in the flavor but I loved biting in the cookie knowing there's a bit of toffee in there. Usually toffee is hard, and I was expecting to bite into a hard cookie, but it was so soft just like the rest of them.\nWhite chocolate chip: So sweet, almost too sweet to eat. White chocolate chips though do have a reputation to be sweeter than the rest.\nWalnut Chocolate Chip: Smaller cookies, more dense though. I just wished that the cookie was a little bit bigger, but I did enjoy a different texture. \n\nThe cookies were still amazing the next day. Feel free to stock up and keep these in your cookie jars.

If that's not a success story that warms your heart, then I'm sorry you are so bitter. Have a cookie.\n\nMy plan for the Mission was to succumb to the ice cream pulls. My cousins intervened and instructed me to visit Anthony's Cookies instead. With a false address in mind, I walked 4 blocks down Valencia in the wrong direction. I was about to give up on Anthony's when I got a text with the correct address. The text was then followed up with a phone call. My cousins were not going to let me leave the Bay without tasting Anthony's Cookies. And now that I have tasted them, I won't let YOU leave the BAY without having one... or two... OK three!\n\nI walked away with a dozen to bring to a dinner party. We picked cookies and cream, cinnamon spice, oatmeal cranberry, chocolate chip, toffee chip, and walnut chip. Since there was a big group of us, my friend cut them into fourths so we could try them all. Not only were these cookies the stuff dreams are made of but they leave an aftertaste of sweet memories as well. I love them and spent the whole night wishing I could have a whole cookie for myself. They are small but simple cookies made with a lot of butter, crispy on the outside, flat, and perfect in every way. The flavors are strong and I am so curious now about the organic peanut butter cookie and the banana cookie. Before Anthony's, I couldn't envision what a cookies and cream cookie would look like. It's not an Oreo. It just looks like a chocolate chip cookie but it tastes like cookies and cream. It's genius.\n\nNow go and get your cookie on.", "author": "Rachel A."}

I've hooked friends, family, and co-workers on it. Nothing compares! They pride themselves on high-quality and unique flavors, delivering perfection with each and every batch. It's located in a pretty tough part of town, esp. parking-wise, so if you don't live nearby, I suggest buying at least a dozen (or more) because you will definitely be wanting more!\n\nI usually order the following:\n- Cookies and Cream: I imagine this is what it tastes like when you stick an oreo in the blender. Yes.\n- Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin: A classic done extremely well.\n- Toffee Chip\n\nThe cookies always taste warm, fresh, and not to mention full of flavor.

(Seriously, only someone with issues would drive an hour for a cookie).  \n\nSince I had never had Anthony's and didn't know when I would be back, I figured I would get as many flavors as struck my fancy.  So what did I get?\n\n2 cookies n cream\n1 chocolate chip\n1 dark chocolate chip\n1 white chocolate chip\n1 oatmeal raisin\n1 chocolate chip oatmeal\n1 double walnut chocolate chip\n1 german chocolate\n\nOh, and also a bottle of Strauss Milk to wash it all down.  \n\nSo after making my purchase at about 1pm, I ate three at the shop.  And by the time I went to bed at 1am, I only had 1 cookies n cream cookie left..... (okay I get it, I have a problem; as with all addictions, admitting you have a problem is step 1).\n\nAnthony's Cookies are really good and all of the cookies are on the money.  Slightly crispy outside, super soft/chewy inside with a great balance of flavor.  From the pile of sugar and butter overload, I was able to realize I liked the cookies n cream, oatmeal raisin and double walnut chocolate chip the best.  \n\nEven though I have had better individual cookies at other spots, all of Anthony's flavors were spot on!\n\nThanks for the sugar and butter overload (and possibly losing another 5-10 mins off my life from this food adventure).", "author": "Thomas N."}

The chocolate chip, cookies and cream, dark chocolate chip, white chocolate chip, and peanut butter were the other selections that we had.  All very good.  They're all meaty cookies (I hate super flat cookies with no body), and they've got a good chew to them without being overly buttery.\n\nService was great.  The gal behind the register was very nice and sweet.  The store itself was pretty spacious and clean.  I guess my only gripe is the price.

It was almost as if they had a half a spoonful of too much sugar per cookie. If you're wondering, I had the oatmeal raisin, oatmeal chocolate chip, and oatmeal cranberry (can you tell that I dig oatmeal cookies?). The oatmeal chocolate chip I expected it to be sweeter but the other two could have been toned down on the sugar. Yes, I understand the irony of buying desserts and then complaining that they're too sweet but isn't the key to a good cookie that you find the perfect balance? It's not like I never had cookies before and the three varieties that I ordered were all consistently too sugary to me. I had a hard time looking past that and tasting the natural flavors of the oatmeal, the raisin, the cranberries. \n\nAnyways, enough of the sugar rant. For the size (a small lump, not large flat types of cookies) and taste, I think buying a decent size cookie from Arizmendi Bakery across the street is much more worth it!

I was worried about trying the Straus milk, especially since I had to buy the jug, which was pretty big and $5. When I tried it, I was pleasantly surprised at how creamy and delicious it tasted. It was certainly different from the milk I used to buy at the grocery store. This is probably the most amazing milk I've tasted. It was like cream. I highly suggest trying it at least once, especially with the warm cookie.\n\nALSO, the people working there are super friendly!", "author": "Vera W."}

They actually taste homemade, and not like bakery cookies. \n\nI appreciate that the people working the counter offered to let us taste any cookie we wanted to, and as many as we wanted. \n\nWe ended up buying: 1 regular chocolate chip cookie, ( the true test of any cookie maker) \n1 toffee chip (because reviewers raved about them) \n1 oatmeal chocolate chip \n1 cookies 'n' cream, (these made the \"must eat in SF\" list) \n1 cinnamon sugar. \n\nMy guy and I split each cookie, and we loved them all. I was also impressed that two days later the cookies still tasted fresh. \n( I can't eat a lot of sugar at once, so we had to spread the consumption out.) \n\nAs for the people bitching about the size...REALLY?

I love their oreo, white chocolate chip and toffee cookies. These three flavors are soft, chewy and flavorful. They can be a bit sweet, so make sure to get some milk or coffee to accompany them with. I don't really like their harder cookies like the chocolate oatmeal, coffee, and pecan because they are way too crunchy for me and don't have that \"Anthony's feel\". The prices are a bit high for the size of the cookies, but if you have a sweet tooth you will find yourself craving for these bad boys!", "author": "Joy N."}

With an enthusiastic 4.5 stars on Yelp over a span of nearly 900 reviews and a shoutout on 77s Big Eat, it was a fail safe way to inject some productivity into my midweek.\n\nAt $1.25 a pop, these aren't your typical, cheapy grocery store dozen you can pick up at your local Safeway bakery. But wow, these cookies are good - and I might even go so far to say they're the best I've ever had (and I've had many cookies in my lifetime). With the right ratio of crispy edges to chewy centers, it took all of 5 minutes to decimate the 4 poor cookies (Cookies & Cream, Oatmeal Raisin, Toffee Nut, White Chocolate) who had the misfortune to be selected by me.\n\nThe Cookies & Cream cookie, #65 on 7x7's Big Eat 2012 list, was expectedly a perfect blend of cookie and more cookie, but my personal favorite was the Toffee Chip. It may be a tad sweet for those who can't handle sugar overload, but to my sweet tooth, it was perfect - just enough sweetness to maintain a manageable sugar high.\n\nThough I only tried four, I'll certainly be back to sample all other offerings. I most definitely don't think you can go wrong with any flavor scrawled onto their chalkboard menu.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

He hyped them up so much that I was almost sure I'd be disappointed. I mean I've had enough solid cookies to know that it's hard to blow me away. \n\nThe cookies & cream blew me away. I almost wanted to dance. The cookies are all soft with just the perfect amount of chewy. With each bite you know that this is what a cookie should taste like. Flavors are complex, wondering how they managed to get them to taste like this, but simple and familiar at the same time. \n\nMy favorites are cookies & cream, Toffee Chip, Candied Pecan Chip, Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip, and Cinnamon Spice.\n\nThe cookies are wow, but I would take away half a star for the price. $1.25/cookie is affordable and fair, but if you get more than 10, it can get pricey.

If you're a fan of white chocolate you'll never go back to another--especially those with macadamia nuts in them (WHY do they have to mess up perfectly good desserts with nuts?) And if you're not a fan, it doesn't matter, you're going to end up a fan their white chocolate chip. Although I know what they're famous for is the cookies and cream cookie, I can't help but continue to rave about this equally deserving classic. \n\nMy second recommendation...if pressed...would be the german chocolate. Or the double chocolate chip. To tell the truth, maybe I couldn't even tell the difference between the two but if your taste buds weep for the taste of chocolate like mine do, you'll love both of these. \n\nCheck out their website for the daily flavors; it's a very simple and aesthetically pleasing site to navigate which complements the feel and ambiance of the shop. You walk in and there's no messing around. There's only one little table on the side, a counter with napkins and whatever things you need to complete the devouring and a big menu to stare at and be indecisive. \n\nDanger: the workers are so friendly. And by friendly I mean they'll break off pieces of whatever cookie you want to sample and place it in front of you. By the time you're done you've most likely eaten three whole cookies and you haven't ordered yet. A true gem and awesome business that knows they're the cookie boss.", "author": "Emiko T."}

While I was trying to find this place on the map, I actually found that I was on the opposite side of the street.\n\nAt first it seems that there is nobody here.. but then you see someone at the counter and a couple workers in the back baking. There was a gal this Friday that I did see and I had told her it was my first time being in here. I decided to come here on a whim due to the fact that I saw it at the bottom page of the yelp site. Before I went I wanted to do some decision making before I got there. \n\nWhat to expect / What did I get? :\n\n- Friday ( the top 5 from the baked everyday list) 4 each\n\n- Periodic table of cookies:\n\n    Cinnamon Spice - 4 each\n\n    Pecan Toffee Chip - 4 each\n\nTotal cookies I can has: 24 cookies\n\n- Farm Organic milk 1 bottle\n\n\nOkay... so when I got there the place was empty at first but I did get myself to deciding on what to get. Soon after... there were a few people that came in just as soon as I stepped in to order that flash 2 dozen. Then I decided to get the Organic milk that I seen from the pictures to try. Note that I only had 3 out of the 24 that I has + The milk....\n\nThe gal that was helping me get my bakes told me that if it was my first time trying this milk that you would have to shake it since the fat content was plugged at the top. She was right.. but I had to open the bottle cause I didn't think that the cream part would mix well.. it got kinda messy from there D:\n\nyou guys might think that... \"Hey this milk is old!\" or \"Hey!! Why is it chunky at the top?\" Duh, its not like the regular milk that you see at the grocery. I had taken the red cap type (its usually associated with Vit D or whole milk) which is apparently whole milk. I think this type of milk is the one that they boil/steam for coffee & cappuccino's also that thickness from the milk has a bit of that sour cream taste which I didn't mind really but did balance out when you were eating these cookies. \n\nNormally I don't go out for sweets but I like to has my cookies every now and then.\n\nThese cookies won't disappoint at all.

Haha. I decided a dozen cookies would be the perfect pick me up knowing he loves cookies. \n\nI bribed my friends with cookies if they drove me here since we were hanging out anyways. One wrong turn and an illegal U-turn later, we arrived at Anthony's Cookies. \n\nIt looked closed from the outside and once we went inside, we still thought they were closed. Its a kind of creepy establishment at night. Its a fairly long room with a lighted kitchen and nobody else was in there but us. Haha. It did not look like they sold cookies. \n\nThe cashier working there told my friend she looked familiar and they ended up knowing each other from a concert. He was super nice and was very helpful with what cookies we should get. He let us sample a bunch and said his favorite was the white chocolate one which also happened to be my best friends favorite and then later my lovermans favorite. They had 11 cookie options today (monday) so I got a dozen, one of each, and the 12th one being the white chocolate cookie. At one point he threw away one of the cookies in the box saying they have very high standards for their cookies. My best friend and I later joked that they probably do it all the time just so it looks like they have high standards but instead their trash can is just a bucket of cookies all the employees devour later. Haha. \n\nMet my loverman at Bi-Rite Creamery for some sugar overload. He was unappreciative just as I knew he would be and he will probably soon forget the occurrence in a matter of days. Someone remind me why I bother to do nice things for him? \n\nThe three of us ate the entire box in the span of four hours. The last two standing were the weird banana \"cookies.\" They were more like muffin tops and not very tasty. One had nuts and some other stuff in it and the other was just plain banana. \n\nI was excited to try the whole wheat oatmeal cranberry but it was super dense and not as good as I hoped it to be.

You can usually see Anthony there working and baking cookies. \n\nFavorites: \nCookie and cream: if you love oreos, then you will love this one. It's a hybrid of a oreo and a chocolate chip cookie, moist and you can actually taste the cookie and cream. \nChocolate chip cookie: Very chocolate-y and perfect balance of cookie and chocolate \nPeanut butter: Must eat instantly! It will crumble and break apart once you put it into the bag. Because it's made with organic peanut butter, its super delicate. Not a fan of peanut butter and they only serve it on a few days. \nOatmeal cookie: not a fan, its very small and just taste too much like granola \nToffee: very good, if you like toffee, this has a prefect balance of it, not too over powering either since toffee can make the cookie too sweet. \n\n\nI suggest getting milk with it, cookies and milk; cannot go wrong!", "author": "Amy L."}

It's extremely rare to find places that can master a recipe that yields a cookie with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside with a chewy and moist center.  They've got this down to a science, because every cookie I tried had this consistency in texture.  \n\nAll the flavors I tried were good, but the one that stood out was the cookies and cream.  In fact, this one blew my mind.  I could not stop eating it, and wished I had gotten a dozen of just his flavor.  Although not quite as memorable as the cookies and cream, the other flavors were still solid.  They're all made with the perfect amount of sweetness and butteriness.\n\n$1.25 a cookie or $1.00 for 6 or more.  The cookies are about 2.5\" in diameter.  I think the size is perfect, but to pay $1.25 is a little steep for one cookie.\n\nOverall, I can't give it any less than 5 stars for the cookies and cream and for making some of the best cookies I've had in the Bay Area.", "author": "Lori K."}

For me, I generally tend to gravitate more towards salty or tangy snacks as my weakness... think chips and salsa, beef jerky, bacon; and in my earlier years skittles, sour patch kids, and airheads.\n\nBut for some reason, unbeknownst to me, I have always had a weakness for chocolate chip cookies and.... warm brownies with ice cream on it.  So naturally when visiting, I saw this place, saw the reviews, and could not resist.  Unfortunately they were out of the standard chocolate chip, so I had a cross section of all their other cookies that were available...  i THINK if I recall correctly, they were:\n\n-Cinnamon Spice\n-Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip\n-Toffee Chip\n-German Chocolate\n-Walnut Double Chocolate Chip\n\nI can' t give you the play by play because I have forgotten, but I can say the German Chocolate was really good, and in general they were all tasty - Cinnamon was not my favorite, but that's probably just because I'm partial to chocolate chip variety cookies.  I want to say the wheat one was a stand-out as well.\n\nI also figured I'd try the overpriced organic milk straight from the cow's nipple, just because you aren't going to find that type of stuff in Texas.... it tasted like regular whole milk, so I would forego that.\n\nAs many others have mentioned, these cookies are small... about the size you would get out of a home-made batter (maybe 2.0 - 2.5 inches in diameter) so you are paying a good bit for what you get.  \n\nBottom line: very good cookies but not spectacular... still can't beat JD's Chippery in Dallas.", "author": "Mark W."}

My sister found out about this place from Yelp so we decided to try and have loved it ever since. The storefront is very small so it's easy to pass up when driving, so keep a watchful eye. Inside the shop is very plain, no fuss. The cookies are wonderful and they always have a great selection. I love the chocolate chip and the walnut chocolate chip cookies the best.\n\nThe only slightly negative thing I would say is that the cookies seem a tad overpriced, especially considering how small they are. In comparison to Mrs. Field's for example, they are the same price but about half the size, however, they taste much better IMO.\n\nOverall, I think the cookies are wonderful and a real treat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-08", "description": "I think I found my favorite new cookie shop!\n\nI usually prefer the sugary, buttery, 2-inch thick, heart attack-inducing cookies you'd find at a place like Specialty's, but the cookies at Anthony's have quickly become my favorite.\n\nI ordered a dozen cookies for $9.25. Each cookie is about 4'' wide and 1/3 of an inch thick--big enough for one cookie to satisfy your cookie craving, yet small enough to not feel terrible about eating 2 or 3 (or in my case, 6). Here's a quick rundown of what I ordered and what I thought about each cookie:\n\nCinnamon Sugar: My favorite! I'm a chocoholic so I was surprised that my favorite cookies of the bunch were all of the non-chocolate flavors. However, I loved the crispy on the outside/chewy on the inside texture of this cookie and thought it had just the right amount of sweetness.\n\nToffee Chip: My second favorite! The toffee pieces were gooey and tasty and the rest of the cookie was great too.\n\nSemi-Sweet Chocolate Chip: Nothing you wouldn't already expect from a chocolate chip cookie, but still very delicious!\n\nWalnut Chocolate Chip: Identical to the semi-sweet chocolate chip, but with tasty walnuts throughout.\n\nBanana: Tasted more like the top of a banana muffin than an actual cookie, but I loved this one too!\n\nCookies and Cream: Anthony Cookie's signature flavor. I expected greatness, but found the cookie to be a bit bland. I couldn't really taste the cookie pieces and overall found it difficult to sense a distinct flavor to the cookie. The only miss of the bunch.\n\nOverall, I give the cookies at Anthony's 4.5 stars. However, I'll definitely round up to 5 stars for Anthony's outstanding service. Immediately upon entering the store, Anthony greeted me and gave me a very warm welcome. The rest of the staff was also super friendly (and were even generous enough to give me a free cookie for my first visit!). And at $1 per cookie, $5 per half dozen, and $9.25 per dozen, prices are reasonable. \n\nJust be sure to order more than you think you want. I guarantee you'll inhale these bad boys in seconds.\n\nThanks Anthony! I'll definitely be back for more.", "author": "Joseph F."}

I had the Oatmeal Walnut Chocolate Chip Cookies and the Double Chocolate Chip Cookies and they were to die for.

And honestly, what more can really be said about Anthony's Cookies?\n\nThey are chewy with a subtle crisp on the outside - PERFECT. They have a little extra sweetness without being too saccharine, which is perfect for a sugar-lover like myself.  They feel so homemade. But homemade in the way you WISH you knew how to make it at home. Plus, they are priced perfectly for you to get a whole bunch and take with you to share. Though, I find it hard to believe you'll be willing to share once you take a bite. I chose quite a few cookies but then ended up choosing one more. Since they arent priced individually, the man at the counter said the extra cookie was on the house! I insisted on paying, but he wasn't having it. How generous and sweet is that?!?! I was happy with all of the cookies - loved their creative flavors like cookies and cream. And the toffee really lives up to its reputation, it was article-worthy. Literally.\n\nBut let me tell you what truly stands testament to the deliciousness that is Anthony's Cookies. Upon driving up the street to find a parking spot (in the mission, no less!), I found what looked like a painted curb outside of the auto body shop next door. A little skeptical, I parked and went outside to get a closer look at the scraggly curb. As soon as I looked up, a police car was parked in the middle of the street for another issue (not me thankfully!). As they were walking, I asked if where I was parking was legal. One policeman looked at the curb and asked if I was going to the auto body shop or the cookie shop. I proudly told him \"Cookies!\" He then said. \"if you are getting cookies, go ahead it looks fine to me!\" After finishing up my order, the two policemen walked in to order some themselves. Speechless.\n\nOh Anthony's Cookies, your extremely kind staff and delicious cookies even make the police nice. You are not just scrumptious, you are magic! Does this work with CHP?

Anthony was there in his open kitchen furiously baking cookies.  \n\nThe inside of the shop smelled incredible (mmm, fresh baked cookies) and the chocolate covered walls were covered with pictures of butter and other ingredients.  I didn't see any tables or chairs, but maybe they took them out for the grand opening or they haven't arrived yet.  They also had a lovely display of Straus milk bottles - but no milk for sale.  It's hard to eat cookies without milk.\n\nBy the time we made it to the front of the line, they were out of quite a few varieties of cookies.  It's $5 for 6 cookies.  \n\n* Toffee chip:  This was still quite warm (fresh out of the oven), a medium sized cookie, very buttery. The texture was just right - slightly crispy on the edges and soft in the center.  It didn't have any visible toffee chunks.  I think the toffee flavor could be stronger and I'd also prefer to have something crunchy in the batter for  contrast.  It could use a little more salt too (it's a bit too sweet).  \n* Double chocolate:  Plenty of chocolate flavor with melty chocolate chips.  \n* Cookies and cream: Had bits of Oreo cookies, quite soft in the center.  I think it could use a little more crunch.  \n\nThey have 14 types of cookies, nothing too exotic but more along the lines of classic cookies.

The organic milk was an adventure, shaking as hard as I could to dislodge the clump of cream/butter at the top. Made for a good time and an interesting scene.\n\nI've had some homemade from-scratch cookies before that can compare, but I will admit, if you're going to buy a cookie, there isn't a better place.", "author": "Ryan C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-26", "description": "Congratulations to Anthony's for a seemingly very successful Grand Opening yesterday (April 25, 2009, 1-3pm). I showed up around 1 or so and met up with Lolia S. right at the same time. Shortly thereafter, Matt G. stumbled upon the two of us, and the Holy Sweets Trinity was formed. The line was pretty long when we arrived, but it was much longer after we finally got our cookies. \n\nEach person in line was granted one free cookie for the Grand Opening special, which was more than I had expected (I was expecting maybe crumbles of cookies at most, I don't know why). The wait wasn't too long, considering, when I was in sight of the front counter, I could see Anthony and others rushing around in the back baking up more batches of cookies for the crowds. \n\nIn terms of the store itself, it's still of course very new. There's only a small sign posted in the window so far, but the interior is decorated rather nicely with beautiful photos of ingredients. The front counter area is lined with milk bottles and a makeshift menu is handwritten on the left wall in permanent marker. They have an Odwalla cooler to the right, and looks like they will soon serve coffee and tea as well.\n\nThere are currently twelve flavors available:\n\n1. Cookies and Cream\n2. Semi-sweet Chocolate Chip\n3. White Chocolate Chip\n4. Cinnamon Sugar\n5. Toffee Chip\n6. Double Chocolate Chip\n7. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Raisin\n8. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Cranberry\n9. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip\n10. Walnut Chocolate Chip\n11. Banana\n12. Banana Walnut\n\nAccording to Matt G., one cookie costs $1, so buying in bulk is a better deal. I decided to go with a half-dozen for $5; for my free sample, I chose the Cinnamon Sugar, which was so warm and fresh. The taste of the cinnamon was very distinct in the cookie, and the texture was chewy, but not doughy. \n\nFor the half-dozen, I went with three Cookies & Cream and three Banana. I'm not sure if they ended up giving me the Banana Walnut instead, though, but it didn't matter to me. The Banana/Banana Walnut cookie was very bread-like, almost like Banana Bread. The Cookies & Cream screamed its namesake upon first bite--really, it's amazing that Anthony has concocted this mix. Very unique and original; will probably make the ice cream lovers forget  about the flavor and convert to the cookie. \n\nThe size of the cookies are average (to me): not as big as those cookies you'd find at a convenience store, but not bite-sized either. The Banana varieties are slightly smaller than the other flavors, probably due to the banana/bread consistency. Overall, I like a cookie shop with out-of-the-ordinary flavors yet also promoting some relatively healthy options (i.e., the whole wheat varieties).\n\nService was amiable and efficient, considering how busy they were in preparing more cookies and trying to get the line moving along quickly as well. I rather enjoyed my experience there, and I hope to be back soon again (perhaps I need to make a point to head over to the Mission more often anyway). For the time being, cash only, but with the popularity already booming for the shop, I wouldn't be surprised when they start accepting cards as well.\n\nAs a final note--Anthony's has already earned a Yelp sticker; quite fast! Keep up the buzz.", "author": "Helene K."}

Its worth it, especially since you're not going to order only 1 or 2 cookies\n\nCinnamon Cookie - like a spicy snickerdoodle, very cinnamony, and very delicious. The first thing I thought of was pairing this cookie with the Horchata Ice Cream at Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous. This would create some sort of amazingly awesome cookie sandwich that Will Ferrell would describe as SCRUMPTRELESCENT. Still, a good cookie on its own and a great recommendation by the cashier.\n\nChocolate Chip - Stock cookie, well done. Melty chocolate chip, and a good doughy cookie.\n\nOatmeal Chocolate Chip - the guiltless cookie. It tastes a bit grainy as oatmeal normally does, but it definitely doesnt taste like cardboard. Its still moist and the texture is nice and chewy. The chocolate chip  is a nice touch as opposed to raisins. Ungh, raisins. Very good cookie.\n\nCookies and Cream - Their crown cookie. Obviously very amazing. Very chocolatey, but not very creamy. This cookie is ridiculously good. My gf may not agree, but this is the crack of cookies. Man, im drooling thinking of these cookies, and this would be great paired with ice cream from your favorite purveyor. \n\nWalnut Double Chocolate - the brownie of cookies. Tons of chocolate, I'm meh about walnuts but I wanted to at least try them, and since Janette likes walnuts, I ordered 2 because I don't like sharing desserts. Amazingly good.\n\nI really think the secret to their cookies is cake flour. Try it for yourself. Nevertheless, they use quality ingredients, and I will definitely be back.

Nothing but a long table inside, but you're most likely not going to eat there since they only serve cookies. It's about $15 for a dozen, $1.25/ea, which is overpriced, but for the quality of the product, it is acceptable. The cookies are freshly baked and they have floating flavors that only appear on specific days of the week. I've tried Chocolate Chip, Toffee Chip, Cookies & Cream, Peanut Butter and Cinnamon Spice. My personal favorites are Toffee Chip and Cookies & Cream--I'd eat an entire dozen if I had the option. Can't say I'm a fan of Peanut Butter, though.\n\nAnyway, the cookies are amazing.

Cookie within a cookie? GENIUS. Mmmm, every bite is packed full of flavor. My friend who doesn't normally like Cookies & Cream still loved this cookie.\n- Chocolate Chip: A classic cookie done right. Each bite makes you want more and more! The bf is a chocolate chip connoisseur, and this is his fave in the city.\n- Toffee Chocolate Chip: Yum! Perfect balance between toffee & chocolate. \n\nOther cookies that I've had:\n- Cinnamon Sugar: Pretty tasty, great texture. But it has more of a cinnamon/gingersnap type flavor rather than being snickerdoodle-like.\n- German Chocolate: I liked this a lot! The chocolate isn't overly sweet but still enough to satisfy a chocolate craving. But for some reason, I swear these cookies are always smaller than the others. \n- Oatmeal Raisin & Oatmeal Cranberry: These aren't my favorite here. Out of all their cookies, I feel like these are the most dry. I prefer the oatmeal cranberry cookie at Hot Cookie. \n\nPrices are very reasonable... it's pretty much $1/cookie if you buy at least a 1/2 dozen.

Our tenants consist of mostly medical professionals, so we do our best to go above and beyond in terms of the gift (What do you give to the people who already have everything kind ). While brainstorming what to do for the gift this year, our new boss recommended Anthony's Cookies. We had done cookies in years past, but hadn't recieved much praise from them so we decided to try Anthony's out as a new vendor. \n\nSaying we recieved \"praise\" is like saying recieving the Nobel Peace Prize is \"cool\". We were FLOODED with compliments from our tenants. \n\nKeep in mind, Anthony's Cookies is a small local SF company who we then asked to make 230 dozen boxes. That's 2,760 cookies. That would be a monumental undertaking for any bakery to create, much less a company as small as Anthony's. This is where Anthony's went above and beyond our expectations.\n\nThey didn't just make the cookies a week before we delivered them so they'd have enough time. They made them that morning. The cookies were still warm when we delivered them to the tenants (after of course, Anthony's had to make two different deliveries to get all these cookies to us). We've never gotten such positive feedback from our tenants and couldn't be happier with how Anthony's went above and beyond to make this event so memorable. We just hope they'll be willing to put up with creating another 2,760 cookies next year! :) \n\n\n\nCase and point: We delivered the cookies to the tenants on November 16th. I had forgotten to post this review on Yelp, and was only reminded today (3 weeks later) when yet another tenant stopped by our office to ask us what the name of the Cookie place was because his wife had some and was so impressed that the tenant is taking his wife there later. 3 weeks later, and we're still recieving standing ovations.

Its flawless execution really.\n\nOhhh and the samples. They will fill you with samples and then you get to buy cookies to take home and enjoy later. And they will STILL be crunchy and chewy then!", "author": "Leah H."}

We just wanted to keep crossing off places from our SF bucket list.\n\nWe came about 15 minutes before closing so the ovens were turned off about 45 minutes before we got there. Luckily they still had their whole menu. The ones I got to try were the cookies & cream, classic chocolate chip, and toffee chip. And we were sure to buy the liter of milk. Honestly, I was way too full to completely enjoy the cookies. But we still had leftovers and I tried them later on that night and I fell in love with these cookies and they were kinda old and cold.

Unfortunately our purchase did not at all live  up to these expectations. In fact it fell completely disappointingly flat. We got the dark chocolate jumbo cookie and the white chocolate jumbo cookie. Both were greasy, flavorless, and way too sweet. All I could taste was sugar and the texture was not fresh at all. Frankly, I've had better cookies at mall stands. Furthermore, the fun flavors such as coffee and cinnamon spice appear only to be on weekends, so if you come early in the week you are probably out of luck. For the high price ($3.00 for an average size '2oz' cookie and $1.50 for a teeny cookie), I recommend searching out Tartine, a yummy Latin bakery, or some ice cream or pie nearby.", "author": "Laura E."}

Freshly baked and still warm, the thin unassuming cookie is encapsulated by the crunchy outer layer yet the inside is filled with the soft gooey and chewy center.  The sweet cookie dough encompasses tiny Oreo cream in every bite and it's teeming full of that rich, butter taste.\n\nToffee Chip was a welcome mistake. I originally ordered the Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip, instead I was presented with the honey colored cookie filled with rich, toffee chip bits.  Sweet but not overly sugary, this cookie passed my test.\n\nWhole Wheat Oatmeal Chocolate Chip was more solid than the rest.

As such, I don't consider them to be rave-worthy.\n\nPer my request, the girl working the register very helpfully pulled out a toffee cookie and an oatmeal cranberry cookie and cut it into 4 squares to sample.  I tried both but found them to be too sweet, however at that point I felt bad making her do all that, and ended up buying the cranberry.  \n\nCookies are $1.25 each.", "author": "Vi N."}

Surprisingly, these smallish cookies where hotter than any cookie that I have received from Hot Cookie. Cheaper, too. The cinnamon sugar cookie was incredibly soft and buttery (delicious!). Everything else was as good as can be expected for fresh cookies and not too crunchy on the bottom. The peanut butter cookie was a little crumbly, and could have been softer.\n\nANALYSIS: I really like the consistency of Hot Cookie better -- both in that I know they will always have pecan chip in stock and that their cookies are a little more dense, heartier. I know I'd never have the forethought to check the cookie chart, and I'd be disappointed that they didn't have the one I wanted in stock.

The cookies are made just the way I like them, soft, chewy, practically raw, not too many chocolate chips in the chocolate chip cookies, lots of crushed up oatmeal in the oatmeal cookies (the cranberry oatmeal was my favorite).  I also loved the cinnamon sugar - it wasn't your typical sugar cookie covered with cinnamon and sugar.  No, this was an actual spice cookie with a little sugar sprinkled on top.  Anthony does cookies right.  \n\nThe other plus, they serve good coffee (Four Barrel) and good milk (Strauss Family Creamery - you know the milk is good when it comes from a glass bottle).

It sounds like they may according to recent reviews, but the last time I went, the girl behind the counter said they didn't, so be aware of that point in reading below review. \n\nI'm disappointed in Anthony's and let me explain why. \n\nI've been to Anthonys more times than I can count with my fingers, and I've been a huge fan of their cookies since they first opened several year ago. Anthony was a very friendly guy who was always behind the counter when I visited. I always raved about this place to coworkers and friends, as I'm huge on well made cookies, which aren't easy to find. While Anthony's cookies are probably some of my favorite, I don't think I will be going back to Anthony's anymore for the simple reason of value/price. \n\nWhen I first went to Anthony's (I think it was about 2-3 years ago when they first opened), their cookies were well under a dollar, and the larger the quantity, the better the deal. However, every next time I've gone in, prices seem to go up, either per cookie or the bulk discounts got worse.  I've kept buying because I love cookies. However, yesterday was probably the last 3 cookies I'll probably ever buy there unless something changes. Cookies are now $1.25, and they no longer have any bulk discounts. Buy 6 cookies, and it will come out to 7.50 at 1.25 each. \n\nI understand that raw material prices and maybe even rent may have gone up, so I can understand having to raise prices since they first opened, but $1.25 for a tiny little cookie and no incentive to buy more just doesn't make sense to me (and it seems the bulk discounts going away is a recent thing according to reviews). Also, I'm all for giving people a chance, but I would say every other time (or even more) I visit, the person behind the counter makes me feel rather uncomfortable. \n\nI'd give 5 stars for taste, but minus two stars for above reason. I'd drop it even more, but I just can't do that since I've been a fan purely on taste. Anthony, I'm sure you have a lot of fans already, but you've just lost one.", "author": "Lawrence T."}

They have their list of traditional flavored cookies on the wall, along with prices, and the list of flavors for that day. Three of us decided we were buying a dozen each (no sharing of Anthony's Cookies...and you'll understand why after tasting them) for a bargain of $12. Six dollars for half a dozen and $1.70 for singles. Not bad for prices. \n\nWe got to the register where a nice (and not bad looking hehe) guy helped us. I'm big on customer service and boy...this guy gave us quality customer service. He was patient as each of us told him our specific wants, telling us where and why he was placing this cookie on top of the other, nicely tying a string around our boxes, offering us samples...and doing all of this with a line growing behind us (I checked three times and started to get worried people would start getting annoyed). \n\nAs for the taste of these cookies...OH...MY...GOD. If you like chewy AND crispy...these cookies are for you. Each cookie is what my friends and I say...DERRICIOUS! Even the cinnamon spice, which I wasn't that interested in, surprised me.

Next, the prices. The cookies are $1.25 each and they are small. We tried the German chocolate cake, cookies & cream, cinnamon spice, and a peanut butter. Honestly, none of them left me thinking \"Hell yes!\" The cinnamon spice was pretty good, but the others were alright. The German chocolate was actually a bit bland.

The selections vary daily and since they're fresh, quantity varies though quality is always consistent.\n\nOf course it was much easier to avoid eating random cookies on any random day I might be walking down Valencia before I noticed this tiny shop - but that's hardly their fault.

So when i saw Anthony's on my top 100 list I was happy to try them out and venture to the mission to find them. After my first bite about an hour ago - I knew I'd want more and will take the trip again even if it's not on any of my to-do lists. The place is cute and simple. They have the menu on the wall with all of their optoins, but on the counter theres a small one with what they have available at that moment. Two of the flavors I was excited to try was banana and also the toffee chip, neither of which they had, no big deal we'll just come to try them another time. \nSo here's the breakdown of what we did get to try so far...\nPeanut butter - hum, kinda small and no tell tale signs of a normal peanut butter cookie, you know the criss-cross fork marks? Anyways, it was tasty but would probably be a 4 star in my book. \nCookies and cream - Excellent. It's a totally new taste for me and i really liked it. Glad we got 6 of them, will get to have some tomorrow too :)\nCinnamon and sugar - another excellent one. More cinnamonie than a snickerdoodle, but thats the closest to compare it to. I really liked it, it soaked up milk very quickly but didn't become soggy. \nsemi-sweet chocolate chip - still in the box - will update tomorrow once weve tried it\noatmeal cranberry - i usually adore oatmeal cookies - preferrable for breakfast with come hot cafe-con-leche. And this was a good one. But it was a bit too crunchy for my taste.

These badboys are GUUUD.\" I had the toffee chip (I'm telling you, I love toffee & I love these cookies) and a semi sweet chocolate chip. I am a milk chocolate cookie kind of girl all the way, but the semi sweet was so rich & sweet, it was enough to make me turn my back on milk chocolate (at least for a few minutes.) \n\n These are the kind of cookies I wish every cookie was like: chewy, sweet & the perfect size.

It's only a block and a half from where I live and never botheedr to go in even though I've thought about checking this place out. I figured it's another cookie joint, but then again, you don't find many cookie joints in the City...at least not in my 'hood. I finally went in over a week ago....NYE to be exact. I needed to satisfy my pms-cravings and wanted to indulge in one last thing before the new year, so I settled on cookies =). Good choice 'cuz these, by far, are the best cookies I've eaten. And here I thought Mrs. Field's cookies were yummy. Anthony's cookies are slightly smaller and $$ for the size, but they are just delish!!!\n\nI bought three different kinds. They're $1.25 a cookie and I didn't want to buy a lot in case I didn't like them....;-). I settled on the cookies n' cream (popular one according to Yelp), the toffee chip, and the candied pecan chocolate chip. I ate half the toffee chip when I got home and put the rest away. Okay, I hid them from myself, but  I couldn't resist and ate the other half of the toffee chip and half of the candied pecan with choc. chip. and saved the cookies n' cream and half of the candied pecan to eat the next day. Surprisingly enough, I resisted 'til the next day. I had to. Anthony's was going to be closed from Jan 1-8, so I knew I wouldn't be able to go back for more cookies for another week!!! Just as well, 'cuz I know I would've been stopping by this place on my way home from BART every evening =). These cookies are irresistible. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Texture is perfect!! \n\nOh, if you buy six, they're $6, and $12 for a dozen. Worth buying six or more than just one, two, or three. You just have to be able to resist eating them all in one sitting =D. Menu changes daily (I believe), but the popular ones, like the cookies n' cream, are always on the daily menu. Now I have to go back and go down the list of cookies to try. Hmmm...if I buy six, then I can eat one a day....yeah right!! =D", "author": "Neni E."}

There--I said it--at the risk of becoming a pariah on Yelp.\n\nThey are just okay but they are GOOD.  How could that be?  Because my tongue did not do ballet moves or somersault upon my first bite of the cookies or second or third.  Because I did not hear the loud symphony of Yelpers' rave reviews. They are  more of soft whispers and comforting like your grandma's soothing voice. Unfair to expect the above, right?  But that's what over-hype does to a Yelper.  Your mind plays tricks on you until you get your first bite.\n\nAnthony's cookies are fresh and sweet. Nothing more than the other cookies I've had. And believe me, I've had many.  Some of Anthony's cookies were moist but not all.  I bit each cookie to taste each one like the COOKIE MONSTER that I am.  Then I've lost track of the taste despite drinking coffee in between.  \n\nI spent my lunch time taking the BART to Anthony's storefront cookie house.  I almost missed it.  It's cute, rustic and cozy. You place your order at the counter.\n\nThere are 12 different cookies on the menu. I had:\n1. 2 cookies and cream\n2. Toffee Chip\n3.  White Chocolate Chip (My favorite so far.  Creamy and moist.)\n4. Whole Wheat Oatmeal Cranberry\n5. Double Chocolate Chip with Walnuts\n\n$5 for 1/2 a dozen\n\nSo, why 4 Stars but not 3 or 5? \n1. Because Anthony's cookies are good and they deserve 4 Stars.\n2. Because they are fresh.\n3. Because they are reasonably-priced.\n4. Because Anthony and his staff are very nice.\n4. Because they are MADE WITH LOVE and Anthony was generous enough to share that love.\n\nYes, I'm a fan but I refuse to give in to the over-hype by rating it more that I think it deserved.

In fact, I was so sold on my friend's response to the cookies that I went back to Anthony's today to finally try them for myself - my friend is right - these are really good cookies.", "author": "J F."}

I saw the great reviews Anthony's scored on Yelp, so I decided to put in a quick stop after making a trip to Bi-Rite to satisfy my girlfriend's craving for their ice cream. The store itself is very simple - there's not much before you get to the cashier, and behind that you see rows of cookies and ovens. But boy, does it smell good. I got 6 cookies, but I seriously wish I had gotten more. The cookies aren't that large - I'd probably but them at the same size as silver dollar pancakes - but they are incredibly doughy and chewy. The chocolate chip cookies practically melted in my mouth; the store does a great job of keeping their cookies on tap warm. Other cookies that were particularly good were the cinnamon/snickerdoodle cookies, as well as the peanut butter cookies (which didn't hit you over the head with the PB as most of them do).\n\nThe cashier was nonchalant about ringing us up in a deadpan manner (he quoted my tally in pennies), but I can't complain - I went to get my sugar fix, and they more than satisfied it. I promised to only eat 2 cookies after I left and save the rest, but I had devoured them all by the time I got back to the hotel. Nom nom indeed.", "author": "Asuka N."}

Those two flavors were good because they had texture to them. The Peanut Butter was too crumbly, Cookies n Cream, Toffee Chocolate were flat, although one good thing about those were the crispy edges, which I love in some cookies.

Butter is key, and without it, you've sacrificed flavor, aroma, and texture, all of which separates packaged goods from fresh made. Walking into Anthony's, I was reminded of the year I spent selling fine pastries and cakes at Choice's in the Crocker Center Galleria, and the shelf life of baked goods, which is three days (it's the butter), and should therefor be enjoyed immediately. When given a choice between fresh, and plastic wrapped, why would anyone choose what could easily last for months outside?\n\nI noticed Anthony's because it took over the store next to what used to be Lord Martine and Bradford Noble's workshop, and it was tagged on Facebook. I'm also always pleased to see new boutique stores on Valencia Street. Anthony's is not exactly a boutique, no shelves full of cute cookie tins, no window display, in fact, no fancy anything, just a counter, a board with flavors and prices, a cooler with drinks, and a long view of three guys making cookies, by the batch. And yes, you're going to have to wait for my favorite, the Chocolate Chip with walnuts.\n\nIf you hate Toll House cookies, it's probably because you used Crisco instead of butter, your pans were too thin, your oven could not maintain the proper temperature, or you weren't paying enough attention, which means they came out either stiff, burned, or both. If you love them properly, the chips come out crunchy on the outside, melted inside, and the cookie is crisp, buttery, and golden brown, all the way through. But to me, it's the walnuts that make or break it (apologies to those with allergies). I shell, peel, and toast mine before adding them in, and I believe Anthony does too, because his rendition of this classic treat has won me over.\n\nSad to say, I haven't as yet confirmed this, because the bakers are either too busy, or too distracted, for a friendly chat. Perhaps this will change with time, but given the spare room, it was like waiting for your little bundle of joy at St. Mary's. They say that having a bakery in the neighborhood improves mental health, and you'd think that walking into a place practically swimming in butter would keep a smile on, but four customers, and the staff, managed to do without. Yikes!\n\nOatmeal raisin? Stick with Debra's Specials. Like his other cookies (I've tried them all, twice, but not the Cookies n Cream, my bad?), Anthony gets the flavor and aroma right, but the texture is more scone, or cake, than cookie. And we know from cookies, right?\n\nBy the way, if you love marzipan, try the pine nut encrusted marzipan cookies at Dianda's Bakery, right down 25th street from Anthony's, on Mission. They are, quite frankly, Cookie Monster sex. Share them with good champagne, then hide them. Seriously.\n\nOh, and forget about parking on that end of Valencia, the body shop takes up what the residents don't. Anthony's cookies are wee things, and at $5 for six, it's not worth the double parking ticket. Ride shotgun, and dash in.\n\nCheers,\nJohn Zane", "author": "John Z."}

No doubt.\nI bake cookies myself, & I must admit, Anthony's choco chip cookies shame mine.  Although truth be told, the choco chips are not my absolute fave.  That would be a close call between the toffee and the ginger cookie.  I've pleasured myself with most all of Anthony's creations, & I actively recommend them to everyone I both know & don't know.  The boxes they pack the dozen or more orders in  are also a nice touch.  The white twine they use reminds me of Rocco's in the West Village.  \nKudo's to Anthony for daring to dream about his own cookie shop, having the commitment and work ethic to stick to it, and baking his dream into a great tasting new Mission hot spot!

You get enough actual cookie with each bite. Also a plus, they are not so sweet as to make your teeth ache. They have a well balanced flavour profile and finally, they are cooked to perfection.

Is this due to something with the dough used for those flavors? I'm not sure, but those three were not good due to the cakey factor. The others - most notably, the Semi Sweet Choc Chip and the Cookies and Cream - had that delectable crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside texture that I looooooove in a cookie.  All in all, I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested putting the cookies on display, because I never would have ordered the cakey cookies had I seen them first. \n\nI enjoyed my trip to Anthony's and also enjoyed meeting Anthony himself, who probably deserves an award for Friendliest Independent Bakery in SF.", "author": "Beth T."}

Not only are chocolate chip cookies something of dessert perfection to me, but I've spent months trying to create the quintessential cookie in my own kitchen.  I'll be honest, mine are pretty damn good.\n\nAnd so are Anthony's.  We were strolling back home from 24th street when we encountered the best advertising ever: the smell of fresh baked cookies wafting out of the door.  Obliged to walk in, we were greeted by Anthony himself, a young guy with a ton of charm and potential.  He was extremely happy to have us as customers, making a point to shake our hands and ask what I thought of his product.  Seared and crispy on the outside, gooey and sweet on the inside.  The perfect cookie.\n\nIn short, these cookies are seriously delicious.  You need to pay Anthony a visit.  Your mouth will be rewarded.", "author": "Tim C."}

I couldn't even wrap my head around it beforehand but Anthony taught me a little something about the cannibalization of flavors.\n\nThe toffee chocolate chip is the other \"gun-to-your-head-which-one-would-you-choose\" flavor.

When I tried my brothers fresh Strauss Creamery milk from Anthony's, I knew this was a place I had to try.\n\nThe scene:\n\nLocated in the quieter part of the Mission, Anthony's lives next to a mortuary, no pun intended.  It's basically just a storefront with a couple of bakers racks and no tables. This is strictly a buy it fresh and take it home to eat kind of deal.\n\nThe food:\n\nThe cookies are gooood. The cashier was kind enough to break apart 4 cookies for us to try - cookies and cream, toffee chip, banana walnut, and semi-sweet chocolate chip. I quickly purchased a dozen for $9. Note: If you've purchased a bottle of milk here, you can return the bottle for $1.50 recycling credit. Here's the break out of what I got: 4 cookies and cream, 4 semi-sweet chocolate chip and 2 toffee. Don't be alarmed by the ring of oil stains at the bottom of the box. The cookies are sinfully good.\n\nThe cookies are exactly the way I like them - thin and chewy. The cookies and cream is made from crushed Oreos and the cream from the cookies are melted into the dough. The semi-sweet is decadent. The chips used are the kind that stay melted, so it smears across your lips with each bite. The toffee chip is good as well, but may be a little too sweet for my sweet tooth.\n\nMy bro actually experimented with his own Oreo cookie recipe last night and it's a close match. It might just hold me over until my next craving for the cookies and cream cookie.", "author": "Sam L."}

I bought and shared 4 cookies with a friend - toffee chocolate chip, white chocolate, oatmeal & cranberry, and the famous cookies and cream. \n\nOk they were good but not enough for me to warrant it a 5 star experience. (Sorry Anthony - I wanted to give you 5 stars but couldn't) I couldn't help but notice at how the sizes of the cookies varied too. Strange - some were big and some were quite small. \n\nThe toffee chocolate chip was just ok for me. Unfortunately for me if I have a craving for this I am going to have to go to my favorite cookie store - Hot Cookie in the Castro. Those guys make a hella good toffee chocolate chip cookie. \n\nThe oatmeal/cranberry cookie was definitely hearty. Lots of cinnamon and that was one of the better tasting cookies for me. You could definitely taste the oatmeal, cranberry, and cinnamon in it. Only complaint about this one was the size. It looked ridiculously small sitting next to the other cookies. \n\nThe cookies and cream cookie was just eh for me. It just made me think that Oreo cookies were just mashed into the cookie batter and then baked. I think this cookie didn't really live up to the hype...sorry.... \n\nNow the one cookie that I did enjoy was the white chocolate cookie. One bite made me think back to Mrs. Fields when that franchise was at the height of its game.

Perfectly crispy on the outside and just undercooked in the middle to be chewy and amazing. This applies to the cinnamon sugar as well. As I was eating it, Anthony said, \"So what do you think?\" As I nodded with what I believe to be pure joy on my face, he smiled broadly and said, \"Yea, I told you!!\" Kudos, Anthony, kudos.

Anthony ain't bullshittin\"- he is really a genuinely nice, decent human being, which is rare these days.\n\nSince I just wasted about 2 minutes of your time explaining how nice Anthony is, imma tell you what I got from him: 3 Cookies n Cream 2 Wht Chocolate and 2 chocolate Chip cookies. Boy lemme tell you none of these survived the trip home- and I live in Pacifica, which is just about 10 minutes away. All of em are pretty official but the Cookies & Cream one stands out the most- If you blend an oreo milkshake from Jack in the box with a McFlurry and bake it, you get a cookies & cream cookie from Anthony's. Best $5.50 I've spent since $5 wednesdays at Roaring 20's.", "author": "Kyle E."}

So imagine my excitement when I heard about this joint that actually specialized in nothing but cookies. I went here today and the line was down the block and around the corner. The weather was decent so I didn't mind waiting. About 40 minutes later I finally got in the shop. You can tell they just opened because it's still a little sparse but it will be adorable once they get situated. They have a dozen different cookies and I'd planned on just getting one of each to share with friends but they were running low because of the crowd. Understandable, so I just 6 cookies that were fresh out of the oven. \n\nWhat I liked about Anthony's was that Anthony himself came out and thanked everyone for coming. He seemed like a really sincere and nice guy (love that). Of the cookies I tried the banana walnut was surprisingly my favorite. I usually love chocolate chip with nuts, and while these were good they weren't the best I've ever had. I really wanted to try some other varieties so I'll make it back one day soon.

I bake cookies quite often, so I do have my own preconceived notions about cookie crunch/chewiness/thickness/diameter/sweetness/heartiness, and I'm not sure why Anthony priced his tiny cookies at $1.25.\n\nYes, I said it: they're small - the type you can finish in several brief bites. They were also thin (added too much egg), cold, and had been sitting on the baking sheet for too long. I actually saw the server retrieve the cookies from a baking sheet. \n\nAnthony let his cookies cool for more than 5 minutes on a baking sheet? Oh lord. I couldn't taste any love in his cookies. All I could taste was an overwhelming likeness to those Tollhouse-brand cookies you buy in the frozen foods section. Then again, I can understand Anthony's predicament: these are just cookies, and I doubt anyone would want to pay cupcake prices just to have a cookie baked with love. If you're not too familiar with baking cookies, these cookies will suit you fine. If you are, however, just warm up your oven mitts. Use the money you would've spent at Anthony's on more expensive ingredients. And don't forget to add love.", "author": "V Y."}

No, I did not eat two dozen cookies - I shared.  Begrudgingly.  I am not going to play like I couldn't Hoover through two dozen cookies. . . 'cause I think I could.  Especially these ones.\n\nI think my favorite are the cookies and cream (think chocolate chip cookie base with crushed Oreos - actually I am not sure what that chocolatey crumble in them is but all I know is that it's GOOD!), toffee and semi-sweet chocolate chip with walnuts.  Although the double chocolate isn't bad either.  I think my favorite is the banana walnut which differs from the rest of the sweet little butter bombs. . .it's like little gobs of banana bread studded with walnuts.  The only thing was that the ones I got were way, way over-baked.   I had them one other time when a friend brought some to a party and I really liked them - they were just golden brown and so delicious. . especially with a cup of coffee.  The ones I got were super dark and because they were over-baked, they were dry.  So my only hope would be that they pull them a little sooner and those cookies would be perfect (and I might just die if he ever decided to add chocolate chips to those banana cookies. . .hint, hint!).  I also didn't care for the whole wheat oatmeal chocolate chip but that's because I don't like cinnamon and these cookies are very highly spiced with cinnamon and maybe something else. . . meh, it just wasn't my thing but that doesn't mean it isn't a good cookie.\n\nOne thing that really surprised me were the white chocolate chip cookies. . . like many other people, I turn my snooty little nose up at the thought of white chocolate in general but these little cookies are astoundingly good. .. the combination of buttery goodness and white chocolate is very fine.\n\nThe people there are very friendly, the prices are fair for the quality of the cookies (two dozen were $17.00) and it's good to support a locally owned and operated business - especially one as sweet as this one.", "author": "Lainie L."}

My idea of a treat is a quart of milk and a box of Oreos.  But alas, I'm getting older and my palate is definitely more refined (see my review of the Tamale Man).\nToday I tried the cookies and cream, chocolate chip, and banana walnut.  The banana walnut cookies are truly like the top of a muffin, not really like a cookie.\nThe chocolate chip and cookies and cream cookies are excellent.  They are soft, chewy, and you can definitely taste the quality.\nAND these guys are so damn NICE.

They are open now at 10 a.m but I recommend coming around 11:30/12ish because they have more cookie choices.  I usually buy my cookies around then and I never have a problem finding cookies.

I was weary at first and took just a piece of what appeared to be semi sweet choc chip for a nibble. Delicious! So then I took a piece of something that looked like white choc chip for a nibble. Also delicious! And I don't even like white chocolate. The cookies weren't just all about the sweetness and sugar; there was also a true flavor of the main ingredient, which some bakers overlook. Most importantly, the cookies had the chewy, soft texture that I love so very much. I was soon joined by two hungry coworkers and we ended up crowding around the box of cookies with our cups of milk for an impromptu cookie tasting and discussion. The consensus was that, while they were all tasty, the cookies n cream were the best and our afternoon munchies were very well satiated.", "author": "Queenie C."}

Friday afternoon my wife calls me at work and tells me we have to go to this new cookie shop in the Mission.  So Friday evening we made our way to Anthony's Cookies and as soon as we walked in I knew I was going to love it.  It smelled great but more importantly there wasn't anything in the store....no tables, no chairs (although I believe they are on their way).  This place screamed to me that it was all about the cookies nothing else and then we met Anthony and Marcus and realized it was about two things.  Cookies and great people.  It is so refreshing to meet people that are good at their jobs.  Unlike the workers at a place like Tartine down the street these two gentleman were friendly, enthusiastic, and you aren't going to believe it but they were smiling.  Yes, people actually smiling at their customer and while they work.  Not only were the cookies great (cookies and cream cookies, who thinks of that SH) but it is extremely refreshing to see people that are kind/down right friendly to their customers.  We liked it so much we went back on Sunday and guess what, Anthony and Marcus were still having a good time.  Really a top notch establishment and would recommend it to everyone.  The cookies and their purveyors are absolutely unmatched.\n\n\nWe had the cookies and cream cookies, toffee Chip, Chocolate Chip and Chocolate Chip Walnut (you have to buy at least 6 at a time).

Buy a dozen, you get a break on the price plus you can try every cookie. I'm glad he's in the neighborhood. I stop here for dessert after having lunch on Valencia or the Mission.", "author": "John W."}

My fiance, who is not a big cookie lover, managed to eat 3 cookies in a row.  Now that's saying alot!  We tried 6 different flavors, the oatmeal raisin and semi-sweet chocolate are currently my favorite although I should try the cookies and cream next time.  Each cookie was moist and the perfect size (not too big not too small).  And it didn't hurt that the workers were all friendly.  I will definetely be returning again...and again..and again.", "author": "Joyce A."}

I would probably give Anthony and his employees my own savings if their business was in trouble--they are that nice. The cookies are chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges.

I remember the days when you used to visit our offices & sell your delicous cookies. They were a hit. Next time I'm in the city, I'll definitely hit your shop to buy your cookies.", "author": "Pauline L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-14", "description": "I want to give this place a lower rating just because I don't think any place should have over 100 reviews and still have 5 stars.  This place is too good for me to lie about so I have to give its well-earned 5 stars. Delicious cookies for a reasonable price.  85 cents for a decent-sized cookie.  Seriously beats the mrs fields-type cookies by price and taste.  The size of Anthony's cookies is significantly smaller that what you may find at hot cookie but seriously, its so much better to have just one snack-sized cookie (or if you want to stuff yourself, order 2 or 3 and get an awesome variety)", "author": "pauline e."}

They have so many fantastic kinds to choose from (yes, I have tried them all-don't judge!). My favorite is toffee chip. To die for!

The cookies are good, but not good enough to make me want to endure inappropriate advances from some fratty douche creepster in an apron. If I want to get hit on by strangers, I would just walk down mission street.", "author": "Cristina M."}
