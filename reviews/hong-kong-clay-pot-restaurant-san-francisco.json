Authentic, cheap, and plenty of food for everyone. My group had Mongolian beef, Kung pao prawns, beef chow mein, Chinese broccoli with garlic, and potstickers. If I can get excited about vegetables among other things, which I did here, that must mean the food is about as good as it gets. Everything from the shrimp to the broccoli was very fresh and bursting with flavor. The food was so good here I couldn't stop eating it even after I felt stuffed. The service was great as well, all of us there were learning Chinese and they were very patient and willing to help us out a little. Highly recommended. I can't wait to return!\n\nSo the consensus I think from everyone in my group was that the really cool spot combined with some of the best Chinese food we'd ever had gets it 5 out of 5 stars, easily.", "author": "Dakota C."}

Our adventure began with trying to find the place. The previous names of the restaurant are still on display and we walked past it 3 times before we managed to use Google Maps to pinpoint the location. After climbing the stairs we walked into a small dining area. We were seated at a large table that could seat more than 10 people. We ended up sharing the table with a Finish tourist who was nice. (Two other tourists had come in, but they didn't seem brave enough to try the menu.)\n\nThe theme of the day was trying something new, so we decided to try Salt & Pepper Frog. (It was that or Spicy Jelly Fish.) We also ordered Chicken Curry Clay Pot (something familiar) and Chinese Broccoli and Beef (something recognizable, but still new). The curry was a little disappointing, it just didn't taste right. The beef and broccoli was great! The beef was tender, the broccoli was packed with flavor and the sauce was much less \"American\" (sweet and salty?) than the regular beef and broccoli I've had before. As for the frog... the flavor was good, but the amount of small bones made it inedible for me. My wife gave it a go because she is a bone-in kinda lady, but the tiny bones were too much for her too in the end and we gave up.\n\nThe experience definitely did not match the expectation. I might go again if I had some friends that really wanted to try it out, but otherwise I have a few alternatives that never fail to satisfy.", "author": "Nick M."}

It's a cramped place with big round tables for large families or shared parties and smaller tables for parties of 2-4. \n\nWe decided to get the Deluxe B for $14.95 per person (not including tip) to try fried dumplings appetizer(only 2), wonton soup(basically two and a half bowls worth), sweet and sour chicken, Mongolian beef and shrimp fried rice. It's a pretty good deal if you're not looking to try their signature clay pots. These dishes are more on the cheaper side and considered more \"western\" I'd say as the Deluxe dishes can also be found at your local Panda Express. The Mongolian beef was too salty for my taste and reminded me of pig ears because of how thick and dry the slices were.

For the price, I can't look past the red solo water cups that are washed and reused. I can also forgive the uninspired and uninteresting food. What I can't let go is the lack of a real Gluten Free option, despite describing themselves as having such.\n\nTo be fair, they were lovely and knowledgeable. They seemed to take great care to ensure there would be no issues with my son's food. The problem is that they don't have Gluten Free soy sauce or other Gluten free ingredients to replace the regular ones. None of their meat is gluten free, accept the Hong Kong chicken, which was cold and without flavor. The vegetable fried rice, without soy sauce, was no good either. I give them credit for being aware, but I would not call the restaurant Gluten Free Friendly. At least not for those with Celiac.", "author": "Michael P."}

I came back hoping their signature dish was still there. Unfortunately it wasn't. \n\nNonetheless, I wanted to see what dishes this place was able to cook up in the heart of Chinatown. On Grant Ave, this place is surrounded by gift shops, and souvenirs, making it a prime spot for tourists. When I first stepped into the place at around 6PM, it was already pretty crowded. We ordered four dishes: pea sprouts with garlic, salt and pepper cod, braised beef with tofu clay pot, chicken and salted fish fried rice. The total price with tax + tip = $53 for two people. \n\nLet's start off with the pea sprouts. It would be impossible to overcook these. Nice and crispy, the pea sprouts were crisp. Also not too salty. \n\nThe salt and pepper cod. When it comes out fresh, it's delicious. HOWEVER, it is definitely missing salt and pepper. The batter of the fish was close to flavorless. \n\nBraised beef with tofu clay pot. There were several pieces of braised beef that were extremely tough and some that melted in your mouth. The fried tofu compliments the sauce well. Beef needs a work in progress. \n\nChicken and salted fish friend rice. TOO MUCH SOY SAUCE AS COLORING. The rice was a dark brown color (most likely used dark soy sauce to color and flavor the rice). While it was good, it was on the salty end. \n\nOverall, the dishes were pretty small.

I do enjoy me some clay pot dishes, so I decided to check this place out. We walked up the stairs and were greeted with a small, sparsely-decorated room. I know that might turn some people off, but it actually filled me with hope! I've had some amazing meals in this kind of unassuming venue.\n\nWe ended up waiting about 20 minutes for a table, which wasn't terrible at slightly-past-peak dinner time. The four of us were seated at a big, round table along with another party of one who was waiting at the same time. I didn't have an issue with it, but the people at the table before me were two parties of two, so uh, maybe don't bring a date here.\n\nAnyway, we finally sat down and looked at the menu. The selection was certainly large, but I'm not a connoisseur of Chinese food so I didn't recognize most of it. I got myself a curry chicken. Or rather, I ordered myself a curry chicken after about 20 minutes of being left alone by the waitress. It was busy, but I shouldn't have to wait that long to order. Clearly more staff were needed.\n\nAnd then I waited. And waited. It took about 40 minutes for the appetizer to be brought out, followed by the rest over the next half hour. Again, yeah, it was busy, but you have to draw the line somewhere.\n\nThe food started off great. The pot stickers were delicious, nice and warm on the inside with a spicy pork flavor that meshed well with the sauce. Unfortunately, it only set the rest of the food up for failure.\n\nEverything else was super underwhelming. There just...wasn't much taste. Even the curry, which is usually a very spicy, powerful dish, totally fell flat. There was nothing offensive, the veggies and meat were cooked well, but the flavor was totally absent. Combined with the slow service, I was super underwhelmed. The only thing keeping this from a one-star review was that it wasn't *bad*; there was simply not enough flavor to dislike.", "author": "Shawn W."}

Small entrance, with a narrow staircase but wow the inside was great with tables right along the window. Food was amazingly great. Our waitress was kind, and helpful. Each dish was hot and portioned perfectly. Our waitress insisted in serving our soups to each of us which was very nice of her to do. friend squid was the best. I hate when places overly bread the calamari, this was lightly breaded and taste great! salt and pepper pork chop and honey walnut prawns were delicious. My mom had garlic bachoy and it was surprisingly very good and flavorful. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some place to eat.

I came here twice during our visit and it was also good every time.  They are very consistent.  They weren't too busy on a Sunday evening - they started to get busier around 7:30 though.  It became harder for guests to find tables.  If you could get a window table, I'm sure you would get a nice view of the streets of Chinatown.  We got the chicken and mushroom claypot.  The chicken was seasoned so deliciously.  We also got the crispy noodles with pork and fish in corn sauce.  The noodles were delicious but the corn fish wasn't as tasty.  We also got pea tips, which was also not as yummy as the other two dishes.  Overall, very yummy food.  The waitresses were very helpful.  They were willing to take our family photograph and even helped me carry down my stroller from the second floor to downstairs.  She volunteered since I had my baby with me.

If it hadn't been Sunday, with limited options available, and following a long hike to get here, we would have walked out. \n\nI truly wish we had and been spared this atrocity of a meal.  The \"hot and sour\" soup was neither-a totally bland soup lacking any flavor or substance.  The salt and pepper frog would have been more aptly named salt and pepper BONE, as the bone-to-meat ratio was approximately 95 to 5.  The seafood fun chow was neither, either.\n\nNow, with that being said, these people are HONEST.  My fiancee left her purse at the restaurant.  We called and called with no one answering their phone.  The next day, we drove back from Modesto and, lo and behold, the manager gave my fiancee's purse back to her with everything intact.  That is refreshing these days.  So refreshing, that I would even give this place another chance upon a return visit due to the crush of people there the night we dined.

This restaurant is located on the 2nd floor with a very narrow opening to the stairs on ground floor so you would easily miss it. The Chinese (\u91d1\u5802\u95a3) and English names of this place are totally unrelated.\n\nThis place is pretty tiny and features mostly big tables sitting 8-10 people each. When we arrived there were only 3 big tables opened, and 2 of them were filled with leftover dishes from previous customers - I guess the staff was really busy then. So us 3 people were seated to this huge table next to the entrance.\n\n#Braised Beef Stew \u7d05\u71d2\u725b\u8169\u7172: B.\nThe taste was very typical. Usually when it comes to \u7d05\u71d2 style there should be more flavors to it but it turned out to be typical beef stew. The beef's tenderness was okay.\n\n#Fish Filet Pot \u6591\u8169\u7172: B.\nIt tasted very similar as the braised beef stew - really wonder whether the fish filet and beef were either braised together or used the exactly the same soup/source base. Besides the fish, every other ingredients looked almost exactly the same.\n\n#Curry Chicken Pot \u5496\u54e9\u96de\u7172: B+.\nAlthough it didn't taste like curry at all but more like Portuguese style chicken instead; the flavor was pretty good and the chicken was impressively tender. It's also good that finally there was a pot didn't taste like the braised stew style above.\n\nAlso got the noodles and vegetables; they were okay but nothing spectacular or memorable. I guess overall their clay pot dishes are decent but definitely nothing stands out and a lot of competitors can meet the same standard easily.", "author": "Simon C."}

Not like an 'oh, that sounds good' kind of way, but a 'I need this in my life right now or else' kind of way. People in Chinatown are constantly sticking menus and coupons in your face, so it's an overwhelming decision making process when it comes to finding a place to eat. I actually scoured menus in search of this dish. Finally we decided on HKCP due to their exceptional prices. We popped the directions onto my phone and set off to find this place. Probably walked past it 6 times before realizing it was up a hidden staircase. We walk up the dingy stairs wondering what we were about to get ourselves into. It's basically an old apartment converted to a restaurant. Tables crammed together in a tight space. We got a window table which was welcome given the stifling feel of the restaurant. We were immediately served tea and handed menus. Everything is family style - we ordered wonton soup, gyoza, and honey walnut shrimp. The soup was very flavorful and there was plenty of it. I'd never had this kind of soup before, but apparently the hubs really loves it. You would think I would know a thing like that after 6 years! The pot stickers were MASSIVE and stuffed to the gills with filling. Great prices too! The honey walnut shrimp was perfection. Literally everything I'd hoped for and more. Perfectly cooked tender shrimp in a sauce that made me melt in my seat. This really hit the spot. I'm so happy we found this place!", "author": "Brandi K."}

The restaurant is on the 2nd floor, and so you line up on this skinny stairway leading up, and every once in a while a cook would come down with containers of trash so that you can see all the wonderful stuffs they want to get out of the restaurant.  One hour.\n\nThen we sat down.  They took our order.  ONE ANNNNDDDD A HALF!!!!!! hours later we get our first dish.  Let me repeat: 1.5hrs between taking our order and serving our first dish.  And yes, we asked what was going on.  There was a guy that came by, and after we inquired, he would say multiple times, \"I don't work here but I am helping out.  I am a customer.\"  ...Yeah, um, right... that's what I thought too.  Look, I'm Chinese.  I've eaten at hundreds of Chinese restaurants.  Usually the food comes faster than at your typical American places.  So, 1.5hr to cook is something special.  Something very special indeed.\n\nSo fine, the food:\n\n1. Steamed Black Bass Fish $15.95: Holy crap!  The fish was quite small and falling apart when it arrived.  Just look at my pictures.  It's a mess.  Tasted normal, but not any better than I can cook at home just steaming a fish from Ranch 99 with some soy sauce and sesame oil on top.  $16!  Gawd.  2/10\n\n2. Chicken Fried Rice $7.95:  (No I didn't order this... see person with far lighter skin to my left.)  So, it's fried rice with pieces of chicken.  I guess it was alright.  Not much to say.  5/10.\n\n3. Honey Walnut Prawns $8.50: Well, I've had this dish many dozens of times.  This one was the worst of the bottom 1/3rd or so.  The batter was not crispy... a tad soggy.  Walnuts and mayo sauce were fine.  The shrimp itself wasn't overcooked.  But well, being soggy kinda kills it.  4/10\n\n4. Snow Pea Sprouts w/ Garlic $8.50: Ahhhhh.... such a needed break--this one was excellent.  Nothing over-the-top.  Just well cooked and seasoned, in a simply traditional fashion.  Vegetables tasted fresh.  7/10\n\n5. Beef Stew in Clay Pot $8.50:  Too much tofu.  And too much of the chewy tissue Chinese use from stewing meat.  You can see that stuff rolled up in cylinders in the pictures.  It was also not cooked long enough so I think most people either threw it away or spit it out.  The beef itself was alright, but there was far less of that than the gummy tissue and tofu.  Not good.  3/10\n\nSo... most horrible experience possible leading up to actually tasting food...\n\nPlus, probably one of the worst meals of Chinese food I've had...\n\n(Oh, and unfortunately I don't have a picture, but the woman's bathroom is separated by a shower drapery in the dining room)... yeah, had to add that...\n\n1/5.

What have I got to lose? \n\nThe theater was great and made a distinct impression on me, in spite of its oddity. Why should this place be any different? Or at least I tried to tell myself that.\n\nWhen I am in Chinatown, I normally eat at normal places such as the House of Nanking. But this time, I wanted a change. A departure from the norm. Therefore, I sought out this odd, unassuming restaurant on the second floor.\n\nI was prepared to be greatly surprised; especially since I was famished after a long walk.\n\nNeedless to say, my expectations were met with utter disappointment. The service was less than marginal, and the foodwas probably the blandest Cantonese cuisine I have ever tasted in my entire life. It was totally uninspired, and under cooked.\n\nI had the Chicken Curry, the Chicken Lo Mein, and the Fried Rice. Besides the fact that it took forever for them to navigate through the myriad of patrons in this small place to take my order, they also took forever to get me my food. At least, if the food was great, it would've made up for the aggravation of having to wait.\n\nSuch was not the case here. Every aspect of my expectations where completely unsatisfied.\n\nWith the myriad of places to eat in Chinatown, I was hoping that this would be a great find.\n\nThe only thing worth finding here was the exit!", "author": "Stephen A."}

Still a good restaurant to go to since there's plenty of friendly faces to talk to.  What I like about the restaurant is that they serve most of the dishes with more vegetables than meats.  The other part I hardly like is the greasiness of every dish.  If you like to go to cheaper restaurants, Hong Kong Clay Pot is one of them.

The service here is above average as compared to other Chinese restaurants. We ordered the fish and bean curd clay pot and one of the veggies (sorry, not sure what the English name is). The clay pot tasted good, but was definitely laden with MSG which made me feel guiltier as I kept eating. I needed a lot of white rice to balance it out. The veggies I got were just okay.

We were seated after a wait of maybe 15 minutes. It took another 15 minutes to have our order taken and another 20 minutes for the food to come. That's almost an hour just to get the food. We were surprised that rice did not come with dishes which in every other Chinese restaurant I've been in it would come with. Luckily, a couple of us ordered noodle dishes so we just shared.\n\nNow the food, it was just ok. Really, it was a good Chinese restaurant but nothing better than I have had in the Washington DC and Pittsburgh areas. This was a let down considering this is China Town in San Francisco.

My group and I were looking for a less busy restaurant on the day of Chinese New Year, so we went to Hong Kong Clay Pot.  Little did we know that this place would be just as busy as any of the bigger named restaurants in SF!  \n\nThe restaurant itself is hidden among a bunch of touristy shops - you know, the ones with garish trinkets and I love SF shirts.  Climb up a set of stairs and turn to the right, where you'll be greeted by smiling waitresses who will usher you in.  I was pleased to see that they had a handsome display of all the good luck charms for the new year - oranges, dumplings, niangao (glutinous rice cake), cups of tea, incense, etc.  Very fitting as we heard the sharp pop sounds of firecrackers outside.  How auspicious for the Year of the Horse!\n\nWe ordered the longevity noodles, yee mein, as well as beef chow fun and a fish and tofu combo clay pot.  We also got one of my favorites, West Lake Beef Soup.  All foods and the soup were good, but none stood out as absolutely outstanding.

We walked and walked and didn't see anything that looked like a restaurant.  When we finally realized where 960 Grant was at, I was a bit shocked and turned off and wanted to run the other direction.  It was in the heart of Chinatown and was squished between gift shops that sold embroidered slippers, jade bracelets and other odd nicknacks.  There was a older Asian dude with an unlit ciggy hanging down the right side of his lip passing out menus and trying to sway people to go inside to eat.  Well, date dude walked passed him and ran up the greasy stained reddish carpeting (at least, I think it was red) and waved for me to hurry up.  I walked up slowly and unsure of this place and tried to tell date dude that I wanted to go elsewhere.  But it was too late, he was at the top of the staircase and I had no choice but to finish the climb up...\n\nIt's a bit confusing when you hit the top of the stairs.  To the right, there were diners, to the left, there were diners.  We didn't know which side to shout out for table of 2.  So, we just scooted over to the right side and the waitress looked at us and waved us to an empty table.  The room was packed with diners, they were not your usual foodie cult diners but your local Chinese family style diners.  It dawned on my that this is a hidden hole in the wall gem that locals dine at.  I felt at peace when I saw this because I too have hole in the wall gem to dine at with my own family on family dinner night.\n\nAnyway, while date dude and I were discussing the menu, the table next to us, Chinese American youngsters, interrupted our conversation and told us that we had to have the honey walnut pawns.  It was to die for, they said.  So, that's exactly what we ordered.  (Thanks for the tips, young diners!)  \n\n1) Honey Walnut Pawns - this was hot out of the pan and was drizzled with sticky sweet condensed milk and tasted divine in my mouth.  3.5 stars\n2) Beef and Chinese Broccoli - One of my favorite dishes and this one was pretty good.  3.5 stars\n3) Seafood Clay Pot - Well, the joint is called HK Clay Pot, we better try one of these pot things.  This one came out bubbling hot with cod fish, tofu, squid, mushrooms, and shrimps.  It was good and I think my favorite dish out of all of them.  4 stars\n4) Jasmine steamed rice - it could had been fluffier.  3 stars \n5) Sweet Black Sesame Dessert Soup - this was on the house and was a pleasant surprise!  5 stars\n\nYes, its kinda scary outside and walking up the stairs may be a turn off.  Yes, the dusty decor of faux flowers and grapes hanging off the ceiling is kinda cliche of a Chinese restaurant.  But the food is good, it's traditional Cantonese style cuisine, the service is really friendly and more importantly, I can finally remove this off my bookmark.  I've finally tried it!

What a joke! It was embarrassing since we brought our cousins from Orange County. First of all, the dingy staircase was so narrow we had to either squeeze by a large group of exiting guests or stay at the bottom of the stairs until there was nobody coming down the stairs.\n\nThere is no space to wait except the  room where the mens bathroom was or on the stairs. After watching the servers clean the table, we got seated. The place was crowded, not only by guests but also by the number of tables crammed in the restaurant. You would expect with such a crowd there would be more servers but there were only 2 visible servers. It took over 20 minutes before we received any service. We asked for forks for the kids and water but got them quite late. The forks finally came after most of the dishes arrived but the water (2 cups only) came after asking a different server. Tea was empty for a while and we had to ask several times to get it refilled \n\nWhen we finally got the server to take our order, she read back what we asked for. Wonton soup, oxtail claypot, Hong Kong style beef noodles, honey walnut prawns, bbq pork chops, snow peas and garlic, and rice.\n4\nWe were shocked to see the soup come. It was a VERY small sized bowl! It seems about half of what other restaurants would serve. The server said we would have to order 3 orders to serve all 8 of us. This appears to be the standard for this restaurant. At least for us. When i first entered the restaurant the food appeared to be fairly large servings but unfortunately, that was not the case for us. \n\nThe honey walnut shrimps came next. There may have been only 15 pieces of shiny looking shrimps and about 10 pieces of glazed walnuts.  The walnut was fairly crunchy but the shrimp was not hot. It appears that it was sitting out for quite some time since the shrimp was too shiny (the sauce was separating) and did not taste fresh.\n\nThe dishes were coming out one by one, having at least 5 -10 minutes pass by between each one. An hour has passed and we still did not have any water, rice, and the noodle dish. After waving to our server again and finally getting her attention, she informed us they were still making the dish. We complained we had no rice but not to bother because all the dishes were pretty much gone (yes, very small portions which seems strange because other tables seemed to get larger portions than ours. Several minutes later, the noodles came out. Hong Kong style? Yes it looked dry and crispy on the edges and moist in the middle. Hmmmm. Didn't we order beef? Didn't she say beef? Excuse me but this is chicken. We would have kept the chicken but she quickly grabbed the plate. 10 minutes or so later, a very full plate came back filled with soggy noodles. We debated if everything was new or did they just remove the chicken and piled it high with beef (chicken pieces were found under all that) it was recycled from the chicken noodles they brought first.\n\nFor me, the best dish was the oxtail clay pot. Only missing was rice. But again, portions were small.\n\nFacilities review: single narrow bathroom. It was dirty and narrow. At least it had a second area :where the sink was. My brother in law had a difficult time changing his daughter's pullup!\n\nFor the amount of customers they had, they needed more staff and the servers need to be more attentive and accurate. And just because we didn't speak Cantonese i felt we were ignored. The server focused on other guests, even though they came after us. In fact, the others received the dessert soup while we got stale fortune cookies.", "author": "Eileen B."}

We each ordered the dinner special which came with a 4 piece spring roll, Mongolian chicken and beef along with shrimp fried rice and a side of beef and broccoli. Everything was honestly delicious and the portions were HUGE! We left(including tip) paying $40.

As a child of Chinese immigrants, I tend to hold Chinese restaurants to ptetty high standards. This is a great hole in the wall and every table was filled by the time I showed up around 6:30 on a Friday night. There appeared to be a pretty good mix of tourists and locals. Luckily, my party was seated right away (another party was leaving as we arrived), but we did see a number of people standing around awkwardly as they waited for their tables. There's not a lot of room to wait, but food comes quickly and the tables turned over accordingly. Service was not too attentive, but not atypical of an average chinese restaurant, and it was fine for me.\n\nWe ordered the oxtail hotpot and green beans in xo sauce. Both were tasty and well cooked, although slightly oily and heavier than I'd want for everyday fare. The green beans were surprisingly buttery, juicy, and sweet--in a good way. Also, tea is not usually something I comment on, but this house tea was great! All in all, nothing mind blowing, but I would eat again.", "author": "Helen G."}

I'm of Cantonese descent but I don't speak the language. Our waitress figured this out pretty quickly and I feel like I got fleeced after that. My teenage son wasn't that hungry (for once in his life) so he ordered wonton soup only. I at first ordered the chicken clay pot with mushroom and chinese sausage. The waitress tried to convince me I needed to order something additional but I told her we weren't that hungry. She kept on talking about getting noodles or a rice dish, telling me that the clay pot dish I'd ordered didn't come with either. So I specifically told her that I would not order the clay pot, I would just get a noodle dish INSTEAD. I ordered the seafood chow fun. She then brought me both dishes. When I told her I had not ordered the chicken dish, she said, \"No split! No split!\" So apparently the restaurant has a policy of requiring each person to order an entree. If I had known that we wouldn't have stayed. The \"policy\" is not posted on the menu. So not only did we have to pay for a dish we didn't want, we had to have the soup on top of that! She told me, \"You bring home what you don't eat.\"  Well, we're staying at a hotel so that wasn't going to happen. I paid the bill in full but I was so upset I only left her a $2 tip and explained why on the shop receipt. I have never done that before - I waited tables for many, many years and know it's not an easy job, and I tip servers well. But I think I was taken. \n\nAs for the food, the wonton soup was quite good. The wontons were excellent, although the broth seemed on the bland and thin side. The clay pot and chow fun dishes were just OK. Both were cooked well; the chicken had the velvety consistency I expected and the seafood (squid, shrimp, fish) were appropriately tender. The seafood dish, however, was just not seasoned well. I felt compelled to pour soy sauce over it several times, having grown up in a household where that's a big no no (because my parents knew how to cook). My son and I both ate more than we really wanted to because I hate getting ripped off - but we still left a lot of it on the table. What a disappointment.", "author": "Renee N."}

I think it needed to be steamed longer. The fish still had a toughness about it. (In case you didn't know the dish uses dry salted fish. It's then steamed to rehydrate it and make it soft. Only it still had a slight jerky quality at this place.) It was also way fishier than other versions I've had.\n\nI also didn't like the salt and pepper spare ribs everyone was talking about on yelp.

It could also be the fact that GGB just re-opened from a long random vacation, and since those mofos are not on Twitter or FB or instagram, nobody can predict when they might open again until word of mouth spreads.\n\nAnd Hong Kong Claypot Restaurant, you know...the place right across Ten Ren on Grant, up a flight of stairs, can be fairly empty right before 6 pm Saturday night after Black Friday, yet the moment you sit down, hoards and hoards of Toishanese families flood in, and then people are waiting by the entrance and on the stairs.\n\nHK Clay Pot Restaurant does not offer Hong Kong style bo jai faan (claypot rice), and their claypot entree selection is modest to a bit on the generic side to be honest...nothing that really screams real ass Hong Kong. So what is the hoopla with this place?\n\nIt's all about the price to performance ratio. If you want fancy schmancy, there's Great Eastern and R&G Lounge (which is of generally better quality, at a premium). HKCPR is a much more affordable alternative, with a big value proposition, hence the family popularity factor.\n\nSmall white board of specials in Chinese by the cashier area. On Saturday night, it listed:\n\nGarlic steamed pacific clams (gwai fei pong) with bean thread vermicelli noodles - one order comes two half shells, decent portion at $7. The secret is in the enhanced soy sauce. Crackalicious. Even better than Silver House in San Mateo...Which makes me wonder how decent their steamed fish might be.\n\nSea cucumber and mushroom stewed with thick mustard greens - $18.95\n\nSome sort of squash/melon (sing gwa) with preserved meat slices - $8.50\n\nroasted squab ($12 per) - this was actually quite good, but not as sexay at the version at Yum's. And oh yeah, the translation is roasted, but dis chit is actually deep fried :-)\n\nsteamed squab with lotus leaf - $12\n\nblack bean sauce goose intestines - $12.95. Too bad not done Chiu Chow style...could potentially be some killer Chinese izakaya dish with Tsing Tao\n\nPickled veg with pork intestines - $7.95. Rustic with a hint of nastay\n\nLotus root stir fry with preserved meats and vegetables - $8.50\n\nMixed mushrooms with fatty beef - $9.50\n\nSo tourists and non Chinese peep$....do you think you are being kept in the dark by not knowing what's on the Chinese white board? Would you have gone for the goose intestines like I almost did (until I saw the black bean sauce prep...which isn't my style).\n\nIt had to be a quickie meal, as we had no time to lose:\n\ncomplementary house soup - let's just say this was not very well refined, but it wasn't just MSG + H2O. The run of the mill Sunset or Outer Richmond area Cantonese restaurant can do way better. Free, so can't complain otherwise\n\npacific clams - very nice, definitely better than what I had at Silver House and Cheung Hing in South SF. Can't beat fresh when materials can be easily sourced up the street along Stockton (produce, meat, seafood etc...just no frozen armadillo please).\n\nRoasted squab - quite nicely done as said before. Recommended.\n\nOxtail clay pot - there's a reason why this is only $8.95. You go to any other nicer Cantonese restaurant, and an order of oxtail claypot (whether done red wine braised style or not), costs about the same as a Japanese style unaju/unagi over rice entree, plus or minus. Here at HKCPR, they have you 3 to 5 pieces of varying sizes (mostly small), and shove a bunch of tofu in there to take up space. The tofu was tasty, but the shitake mushrooms they put in there are dismally small. No red wine sauce, but mostly bean sauce based (like a miso without the fermentation). If you are hungry, this will do in a jiff. \n\nStir fried large pea sprouts with garlic - A shade less than $10, which I suppose is a steal, since this entree easily goes for in the early teens. If you want all your food executed a bit more smoothly, request less salt and less oil for everything.\n\nWe were the only non Toishanese customers (ie non locals or non Chinatown residents), plus 2 Caucasian customers (likely tourists). Everyone else around else were someone else's fam bam young and old. Probably the folks got sick of eating other people's turkeys a few nights ago and decided to feast on cheap decent quality old school chit. The table next to us had a short mountain pile of pacific clams from the specials...and that was just appetizer. No wonder these mofos also go gaga and googoo over the pacific clams when they come out at the Chinese steam table section at Kome sushi buffet (yet skip the dubious looking sashimi, \"geoducks\" and uni.\n\nFor lunch this place is apparently quite ridiculous....several rice plate entrees hovering at the $5 mark (some below $5).

Tofu appetizer- dry fried, crispy and spiced on the outside was good - and we would order that again elsewhere now that we discovered it.

And by no means was the rest of our food (potstickers, seafood and chicken clay pots, pork chow fun, chicken fried rice, broccoli beef, stir fried greens) inedible. So why just one star? ( especially since I have never given a restaurant one star)?\n\nBecause:  contrary to what some reviews suggest, this is not a find:  trust the worn carpet, trust the line of non-Asians waiting to be seated. This is a terrible choice in Chinatown. In a neighborhood where there are solid choices for authentic Chinese food, and acceptable tourist Chinese options, this is the sort of Chinese food that I grew up with in 1970s Cleveland Ohio.   Ridiculously cheap tasting ingredients (think \"mystery meat\", frozen seafood), cooked in a sea of cheap oil, seasoned with cheap spices, served in a puddle of gelatinous sauce, and worst leaving you with a msg hangover. \n\nPlease, Chinatown Yelper tourist: go around the Jackson Street corner and get authentic Chinese food at Z&Y (or trust your restaurant radar at any of dozens of other locations).", "author": "Kevin P."}

This restaurant is upstairs which is interesting, but its on touristy Grant Ave so I was skeptical. \n\nThis place is decent, but I don't think I would come here again. We had to wait in line a bit which I definitely regret. We ordered the Seafood Pan Fried Noodle and the Shrimp Vermicelli Noodle Clay Pot. Both dishes were fine but nothing to write home about. \n\nService was fine. It was quick and without hassle. When the check came, we asked if we could split the charge between 2 credit cards and our server said it was okay, but then she came back and told us she would charge $10 on each (even though our bill was under $20) and that we should add tip to that. I thought that was strange and forthright, but it's okay. \n\nI like that this place is authentic and that all the customers were families gathered around the round tables speaking Cantonese.

We called it \"the upper room\".  This is because we did not want other people at work finding out about it and then when we show up there for a nice lunch to see a table full of jerks from work there.  This place has spiritual significance to me because it was the first time I tasted Caola Ila Scotch.  It was where I met Lilly my favorite Chinatown waitress - who use to work at the Utopia - who introduced me to snow pea leaves as a vegetable dish to be enjoyed.  So, now that I am retired, I can sing loud and long about this very special restaurant.\n\nSo what's so good about \"the upper room\"?  The staff, the location, the ambiance and the food.  But before I share this information with you, you must promise to observe the rules that will preserve this treasure for posterity.\n\n1.  Don't tell any of your jerk friends where this place is.  Use the code name.\n2.  Ask for Lilly to be your waitress and tip her generously.  (If its close to Chinese New Year, bring her a red packet with nothing less than $20)\n3. Don't ask for soy sauce and for god's sake don't put it on your rice!!\n4.  When you order food, don't ask \"What's in it?\"  It makes you look like a klutz.\n5.  Treat all the restaurant workers as you would your priest - they work very hard and are very good people.\n6. If you don't like the food - it is probably because you are unaccustomed to the taste.  This is real Chinese food for Chinese, it isn't Chinese food for Americans.\n\nOk, if you agree to the above - then you have my permission to read more\n\nThe Staff:  They appreciate your business!  They work very hard to serve the very best food in a timely manner.  There are elderly Chinese cleaning vegetables, washing dishes and preparing food for cooking.   Lilly is a stone faced woman who moves with quick efficiency and suffers through a multitude of questions by Gweilo (that's you if you are not Chinese - Google it ).  I like Lilly because she is smart but unassuming.  I've seen people ask such rude and stupid questions about the food that I am ashamed to be there to hear it and think, \"My god!  Those people are so insulting to Lilly!\" - but she stands straight with an expressionless face to listen to these people who have no idea how condescending or insulting they are - takes their orders and provides excellent service.  For me, when the restaurant is out of something I want - like oysters, frogs, clams or snow pea leaves, she tells me what I should have.  Well, she suggests - but there is that ever so slight inflection in her voice that lets me know: \"Steve, the only option here is xxx\".  She is always right.  After going there for years - she knows what we like and she knows what is available... and when she sees the bottle of whiskey that we bring, she automatically brings out the glasses.  Why the big tips?  Restitution for the sins of the ignorant brethren and for services rendered.  Also, when you go, ask \"How is your son doing in school Lilly?\"  Then you will see her beam!\n\nThe location:  It's hard to find.  Yep!  That is good.  It means that only people who know where it is will be there.  Yes, there are occasional groups of tourists who come in and order fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and chow mein - but that's probably only for the amusement of the staff.  \n\nThe ambiance:  God I love it there!  There is usually a party of Chinese men getting ripped on Hennesy - dressed in their work clothes that show they are tradesmen - eating the best food talking loudly and laughing as if no one were there.  Sometimes they eye what I'm drinking and nod approvingly  It is a fine place to be \"a regular\".  I'm not talking \"Yelp check-in regular\" but \"where the staff knows you and respects you\" regular.  The windows are open usually and you can hear the street noise - the tables are crammed in to seat as many as possible and there is a display case on the wall with containers of the drinks available: coke, 7-up, Bud, Sing Tao and other items which include a bottle of cleaning fluid.  I suppose that was a good place to store it, but it seemed odd to see that item in the selection.  This  is what a good Chinese restaurant is all about!\n\nThe Food: Well, the food is good and the menu has a good selection.  Here is what I enjoy - a plate or two of the fried chicken wings or fried quail.  (Utopia has better wings)  If you are drinking beer, no one is going to care much.  The snow pea leaves - or maybe spinach with garlic.  They will have one or the other.  Snow pea leaves is #1.  After that, it's a knock-down drag out fight to choose the other food.

However, compared to other Chinatowns just found this place to be quite average, however, considering the price it is a solid choice.", "author": "Christopher F."}

We first tried to go to R&G, but after hearing that the wait was over an hour, we decided to find another option. We would've never found this place, since the signage outside is small, and you have to go upstairs to find it. But once we saw how busy it was (but not too busy that we weren't willing to wait), we decided to stay. And when you see a bunch of Chinese people eating at a Chinese restaurant, you know that you can't go wrong. \n\nWe were feeling piggy and ordered a lot of food: ginger crab, beef clay pot, seafood clay pot, and onchoy. \n\nThe ginger crab was just right. The portion was small, but for the price it was great! ($16, I believe?) We probably could've just gotten one clay pot, but we were greedy to try more dishes. Since clay pot was part of the name of the restaurant, we figured it was a good bet. The seafood clay pot is made just the way I like it: loaded with various seafoods and fried tofu. Yummers! The beef clay pot was not bad, but I probably won't order it again. The cuts of beef aren't very great, and the flavor of the sauce wasn't as good as the seafood's. It also came with tofu... we were actually tofu-ed out after eating both clay pots. The onchoy is cooked just right, no complaints. \n\nI would come here again. It's got a total mom & pop's feel. We were actually the last table to finish eating, and the restaurant staff started eating while we were finishing up. It looks like a family business- brothers, wives, and a teenage daughter. The food was totally comfort. I would come here again, especially since the prices are really good!", "author": "Lee L."}

Surprisingly, Chinatown doesn't have a good reputation when it comes to Chinese food, as a lot of it is seen as catering to tourists, serving Americanized Chinese food.\n\nHong Kong Clay Pot Restaurant stands out from the touristy scene.  I visited on a Thursday around lunchtime, and as soon as I walked up the stairs, I found the place packed with Cantonese locals getting their lunch on.  It was so packed I ended up having to share a large table with some other people.  \n\nThe lunchtime specials here are cheap.  I ordered a bowl of pig liver congee and a beef brisket with vegetables rice plate for 4.50 each.  Portions were more than generous, too.\n\nThe congee was decent.  It wasn't the best I've had, especially since the , but the liver was good.  It didn't taste funny, which liver sometimes does, and the texture wasn't rubbery either.  Also, for $4.50, you get a good amount of it.  \n\nThe beef brisket was standard too.  I was actually more impressed with the veggies.  They tasted fresh and again, the portion size was generous.  I was almost full after the congee that I didn't even touch the rice.  \n\nAlso, I should note that immediately upon sitting down, they gave me a bowl of complimentary soup.

To get to the restaurant you have to climb a semi-steep set of stairs so use caution if you plan on bringing your grandparents or if you have bad knees. The minute we walked in, I immediately knew that this place is going to be good. The restaurant was small but it was packed. The other Chinese restaurants around the area were all empty.  My mom liked the fact that they sat us by the window so that she can look onto the busy street.  She's a people watcher like me. The restaurant served us our food pretty quickly and the servers were attentive.\n\nAppetizers:\nJellyfish= tasted just like the sesame chili sauce it was tossed in. It is soft like jello but when you bite it, you get this crunchy plastic like sound. If you're a person that's picky when it comes to texture, you might not like this.\nHoney walnut prawns= Yelp sheeple approved and they were right. The sauce and the walnuts really went well with the prawns. The prawns tasted fresh and was not overcooked. Loverboy said this was his favorite out of everything we ordered and I agree with him.\nPotstickers= this one is OK. The flour shell reminds me of the Lingling potstickers sold at Costco. The stuffing inside the potstickers looked like it was house made but the taste wasn't too exciting. When they served this to us, it was just warm so I wasn't too stoked on it.\n\nMain course:\nChicken claypot= the chicken was kind of bland and rubbery because it was over cooked. I think the sauce had too much cornstarch. I will not be ordering this dish in the future because it was disappointing.\nSeafood claypot= my dad and mom killed this dish and they said it was pretty tasty.  I didn't try it because I'm not a big seafood eater.\nPork sweet and sour= the flavor was ok.  It's your standard sweet and sour that you can get pretty much everywhere.  The pork was also overcooked and was kind of hard. The bell peppers were too soft and was overcooked too.  I prefer them to have a little crunch.\nSalt and pepper crab= my mom and dad really liked this one. They said this was their favorite out of everything we ordered.  I took a small bite out of a piece and I thought the crab tasted fresh and it had that sweetness that you normally associate with crab meat.  Loverboy said he wasn't a fan of it.  (He's extremely finicky when it comes to Asian food.)\nBBQ pork fried rice= my mom and I loved their fried rice. The one they served us was not oily at all.  The rice was flavored perfectly and can stand alone if you didn't want to order extra entrees.\n\nI definitely will come back for more.

Our party of 4 decided to get their preset menu for 4 for only $48.  For 7 courses with rice, it was an incredible bargain.\n\nFor the soup course, we decided to swap out the beef soup with hot and sour soup.  Full of spice and all the good stuff, it set just the right tone to cut through the cold of San Francisco night and started our meal off right.\n\nFor the main courses, the sauteed bok choy and rice came first.

While I'm not usually a huge fan of the clay pot dishes, I really enjoyed the savoriness of the awesome combination of flavors in this one.\n\nThe fried chicken wings were simple, savory, seasoned with only MSG, and really freaking hot.  Sometimes there isn't anything better than the simplest things and I really enjoyed them.  I would enjoy the next dish even more.\n\nHoney walnut prawns were luckily on the preset menu and I can eat this stuff all day.  While it wasn't the absolute best rendition I had ever had, I was no less delicious.  Somehow it's not very easy to mess this one up and I'm glad it isn't.\n\nFor the price, I'm blown away that crab was actually on our menu.  While it wasn't pre-cut or cracked, the meat was tender and fresh.  Because of the hassle in eating it, I only had a few pieces, but my friends finished the whole thing.\n\nThe last dish of the set was the sweet and sour pork chops.  I usually order the salt and pepper flavor, but these were really tasty nonetheless.  There was a bit more fat on the bones than I would have preferred, but I definitely focused my efforts on this dish.\n\nWhile the service and location were kind of sketchy, the food and price were phenomenal.

I thought it would be a lot bigger but instead, I walked up to what seemed like the size of a coffee shop. \n\nWe arrived shortly after they opened for dinner and the place was full already. The waitress refused to give the 4 of us a bigger table and made us wait till a 4 seat table was available even though there were 2 bigger tables available already. We watched as other people who came in after us waltzed right into the seats at bigger tables. There was a family of 3 sitting at the bigger tables anyway. \n\nThe service was subpar being that it was way understaffed. There were only 3-4 older women in their late 40s working there. We were sitting in front of the entrance and at one point, a family came in and stood there for 10 minutes before they were even acknowledged. Our waitress was the manager of the restaurant and she seemed a bit impatient while we ordered. She took 10 minutes to give us our check later on. \n\nThe food was mediocre. The beef stew clay pot was a disappointment since it was mostly filled with tofu instead of actual beef. The beef was dry and tasteless.The sweet and sour chicken was hard and the vegetables we ordered were old. \n\nThe place just felt filthy and rundown. The noise level in there was so high. The waitresses would shout across the room. \n\nThere are plenty of other great restaurants to try out in Chinatown since this place does not live up to the hype.

So I knew we had hit the authentic Chinese hot spot for food. \n\nWe ordered a fish and tofu clay pot which was GREAT. So yummy and extremely filling. The portion was also gigantic. \n\nSince the person I was with was a little more \"white\" than me, we ordered BBQ fried rice and hot and sour soup - both which were above par for Americanized Chinese food. \n\nThe service and ambiance were mehhh. In fact, the table was pretty gross when we got there and was only wiped down by another dirty rag. But what do you expect in a Chinatown restaurant? The waitress was normal - not rude, not super friendly... but she was actually friendlier than most chinese restaurants I've gone to. She did say they preferred cash but took 2 credit cards with no complaints. \n\nBTW, anyone complaining about the prices.. get real. Seriously. How is 8 dollars too expensive for a crap ton of food? I know it's Chinese food and it CAN be like 5-6 bucks but really, it's not that much. \n\nI know this restaurant passed the test for me because I would be willing to bring my super Chinese, super judge-y parents here for dinner.

Mushroom and sausage claypot was ridiculous... there were more onions than anything else, the flavor was again completely drowned out with onions. Deep fried rock cod had more batter than fish... it came out and I thought it was like frog legs or something... you couldn't even tell it was fish from the shape, let alone the texture.

The food is excellent, but not the best I have ever had. There is always someone better out there. The food was good and EXTREMELY reasonably priced, a fresh live Dungeness Crab is only $20, which other restaurants on Pier 39 would easily charge $40 for. We had a feast of 3 for only $80, we could barely get up and walk after we ate all of the food. The duck tongue was an awesome appetizer, step out of your comfort zone and try something new and it might surprise you. The Braised Pork Belly was amazing beyond world, the pork belly just melts in your mouth. The clay pot beef is so flavorful, mixed in with vegetables, tofu and spices. I wasn't too sure about the black bean calms, but they were still good.

Thanks for continuing to read!)\n\nBoyfriend and I came across Hong Kong Clay Pot when I got out from a facial at Tru Spa around 8.  My first choice for a restaurant, San Sun, was already closed, so I looked on Yelp for a restaurant that was still open, and HKCP popped up.  I worked in Chinatown for more than a year, but I had no idea this place existed, even though I've walked down this street a thousand or so times.\n\nThe reason:  There's very little signage, and you have to walk up a flight of sketch-ball stairs in order to get to the actual restaurant.\n\nAs we walked up, I heard a lot of Cantonese going back and forth, and when I finally surfaced at the top of the steps, holy moly, ALL THESE CHINESE PEOPLE ERRWHERE.  Very authentic, it's a good sign.  This is clearly a family-style restaurant, as most of the tables are round and meant for at least 6 people.\n\nThey have soups, noodle and rice dishes, veggies, seafood, meats (including frog), and dishes clearly catered towards tourists (Mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, etc.).\n\nBoyfriend ordered the honey walnut shrimp (OMG BEST ONE I'VE EVER EATEN), and I opted for the oxtail clay pot so I could compare it with R&G Lounge's.  I might have to say that I enjoyed R&G's better, as that one came with large chunks of daikon and you really can't beat the delicious gravy they have, but this one is a close second.  I liked the braised tofu and the flavor, but it didn't taste as hearty and rich as the other one.\n\nOur total came out to $22 before tip.  They take credit cards!  The only negative was the service; they were severely understaffed for so many large parties, and we had to flag them down to get menus, get our order taken, and get our check.\n\nDefinitely will be returning to order the honey walnut prawns all for myself.", "author": "Tori S."}

It was really good even my fiance said it was his new favorite Mongolian beef. As I mentioned I did try some other items as well, and they too were good. I'm not yet comfortable with ordering anything other than mongolian beef yet, but it was definitely a good start as the food was still really good. \n\nI also have to make a side note about the location of this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-09", "description": "Situated in an upstairs dining room and reminiscent of your working class grandmother's home, this restaurant is what I'd truly call a serious hole in the wall. More like a drive-by induced hole in the wall, really. This restaurant is a seriously local spot that is so inconspicuous, even the locals may have a hard time finding it. Despite the occasional employee passing out menus at the front of the staircase, it is still easy to miss it amidst the chaotic sights and sounds of touristy Chinatown.\n\nI, luckily, was able to get on it and find this mysterious place with high ratings on Yelp from locals and foodies alike. I must say that upon entering after hiking up a good set of 12 or so steps, I was surprised at the set up of the dining room. Everything is a little off, decorations a little wonky, but the warm and welcoming smells of cooking food is a comfort that is universal. \n\nThe two of us were seated in a round table for 8 people. It was a little funny for two people but we felt like queens. They gave us a nice pot of tea, black, with real tea leaves. \n\nWe ordered the seafood claypot and the braised beef claypot. The seafood claypot consists of shrimp, squid, fried and braised tofu, fish chunks, mushrooms and green onions in a savory gravy that is a little sweet and perfectly balanced. I really enjoyed the sauce a lot because it was gooey and flavorful. \n\nThe braised beef claypot was a delight as well. The chunks of beef were tender, beefy and very yummy. There was mushrooms, braised tofu, veggies and green onions. The sauce was rich and beefy - precisely what the name of the claypot suggests. The only thing that I wish they added in there was daikon (Asian radish) to really oomph up the flavor and authenticity but otherwise it was still memorable. I took the rest of the beef claypot home and had it for leftovers the next day. It was even better!\n\nI'd definitely come back next time I am in the city. Prices here are very reasonable and the food portions exceeded my expectations. All claypots are under $10.00 and one claypot can feed two hungry people. \n\nThe service was also really good. The best is to pay in cash as you should anywhere in Chinatown.  After washing it all down with black tea, we came out of the restaurant in good spirits. Make sure you watch your steps as you take the stairs down. It's really not fun to trip and possibly die, not that it happened to me or anything.\n\nOverall, highly recommended!", "author": "Jennifer N."}

Needless to say, it was getting dark, cold, and we just completed an 8 hour drive so hungry doesn't describe our feeling.

There were 300+ 4 star yelp reviews so in we went.\n\nOkay, we were dressed for a 4 star-5 star restaurant so out of place doesn't even begin to describe our reception.  Continuing the movie theme, we stuck out like a sore thumb and all conversation, motion, and serving stopped when we entered only to resume about 3 seconds later.  On a clean scale from 1-4 stars I'd give it a 1.5 star (generous).  Screw it, we're here and I put my faith in yelp...\n\nOrdered a beer because the water was from the sink next to us, forced the kids to drink hot tea, and asked for straws even for the beer.

The Clay Pot of Chicken and Tofu was cooked to perfection and had a \"gravy\" texture to it.  Very good.  Honey Walnut Prawns were good but pretty typical, and the HK Beef Fried Rice was good.", "author": "David R."}

And the who knows which chef is working the night you come in. If it's the good one, hallelujah! If not, well, just order the pot-stickers.\n\nStay the hell away from the lamb: what are you thinkin' if you think you know real Canto food??? You got problems with oil? It's friggen Cantonse cooking, people!\n\nStay away from that Central China and Muslim Chinese main entree of lamb, and instead order the seafood, chicken and pork dishes. Crabs great: and pick and choose how you want it prepared. Just because it's not listed prepared that way on the menu, ask if you can have it another way. Fried sole is great. So's the jellyfish. And don't be a \"white ghost\", even if you are ethnically Chinese, but actually born and raised in San Fernando Valley...in other words, dont' act like a tourist: Make sure they give you a cold plate with the sliced meats along with that jellyfish and pickled veggies. \n\nFrankly, as one who resides with walking distance down the hill for a quick dinner at HK Clay Pot, I'm hesistant about saying how good it can be for such incredibly cheap prices...at the same time sad that Bill's no longer running this ship and keeping the chefs in line. But, hey, it's completely different town...And hey, if you speak Canto, even just few words (pickup a Lonely Planet Cantonese book, for chrissake), it does help: especially if you know to ask about the secret stuff they don't serve the guailos, and keeps them from serving the Americanized crap they give tourists...and if you plan to come here often, make friends with the servers: they will remember you, good or bad.", "author": "Cork G."}

I ate here with my family after watching the Chinese New Year Parade. Grant Street was packed with tourists and shop keepers peddling their wares. We were lucky in that we got a window seat to witness the exciting celebration while we ate. \n\nOverall the food wasn't horrible. I checked out Yelp before we ordered and saw what people were eating and writing good things about, unfortunately, I may have just ordered the wrong stuff. Considering the restaurant is named Clay Pot, I probably should have gone with some clay pot dish, oh well. \n\nI ordered the following:\n\nHoney Walnut Prawns: Honestly not very good. I have had MUCH better. This was a mistake to order in the first place. I was in the mood for steamed greens, and a nice cooked fish or something very basic/fresh/authentic...instead I went with a standard American Chinese Cuisine dish. The honey/mayo sauce was missing something and the Shrimp tasted like they had been freezer burned and boiled a long time to make them edible. \n\nPeking Sparerips: Very sweet candied meat. Again, I should not have ordered this int he first place, not sure what I was thinking. \n\nOysters with Black Bean Sauce: This was the dish I was thinking would make it or break it. The black bean sauce actually tasted great, but the oysters themselves did not taste fresh. I stopped at one and took them away from my kids so they wouldn't poison themselves, just in case. \n\nI will not return to this place, though I can see that a lot of people like it and like I said, I may have just ordered wrong.", "author": "Michael G."}

The stir fried beef chow fun was good, too.

We got there and put our names on the list, but also looked around for other restaurants as they told us it was going to be an hour. Hong Kong Clap Pot was on the way back to our hotel, so we decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad we did because their ginger lobster and walnut prawns were so phenomenal. You know it's a legit Chinese restaurant because it looks like all the ones back in Arcadia and Alhambra in LA. The usual clientele are Chinese speaking locals and the occasional yelp yuppies (like me). But the food is super reasonably priced and the tea is plentiful.

Came here with a friend the other night who insisted we walk from the SoMA to here for some legit Chinese food. He's from France, soo I'll excuse his use of cutlery, but overall I was pleased with his choice. We waited about 30 minutes for a table-the place was jampacked with families surrounding large round tables with piles of food spinning around on them. This scene alone told us the food would be worth the wait.\n\nFinally got a two-top and decided to order Broccoli Beef, Fried Duck Tongue (just for shits!), Sweet & Sour Chicken, and soup. The tongues were a little gummy for me with an odd crunch, but the rest of the food was \"a-ok\". I wouldn't say it was worth the wait but it was good. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. Luckily I had great company :)\n\nThe atmosphere was nice-lively, smackdab in the heart of Chinatown, families and friends enjoying meals together-but the food was just mediocre.", "author": "Leigh W."}

For now i am going to hold the 4 star rating.  Solid food with fresh vegitables cooked just right.  Ordered the seafood claypot which was spectacular.  We ordered the duck clay pot as well and I must say that it was pretty bad.  Not in terms of preparation, but the cuts of meat used.  They used a lot of back and wing pieces, so all you really got was bone and skin.  I certainly would not order this dish again, but would happily come back for everything else.\n\nGreat value and really solid Cantonese diner food.  First, the portions are massive.  I had lunch there and had beef stew with rice and my friend had beef stew noodle soup.  I think we spent $11 for both of us.  The wontons were very meaty and the soup broth has so much flavor.  Just those two along were enough to make this place a winner.  The beef stew (which is the benchmark by which all Chinese diners should be measured) was solid.  Not too fatty yet still tender.  Everything came out hot and on a cold rainy day it really hit the spot.  There was a large family next to our table that ordered the full spread, with steamed fish, crab etc.  It looked so good.  For now, I am going with 4 stars.  Next time, I am going to bring a whole crew of friends to try the full banquet style gorging experience.  If it comes through on that meal, then we may have to upgrade to 5 stars.", "author": "Scott C."}

I could actually taste the freshness of the pork.

I thought clay pot sounded delicious so I bookmarked this place. After some attempts of coming here (they close at 3pm and reopen at 5:30pm and they close on Wednesdays) the place was finally open for business when I came out here. Was supposed to come here with a friend but she had other plans but I decided to eat alone since I could not wait for another trip out here. \nI walked up those flight of stairs and the restaurant was to the right. The decor was pretty old fashioned. I thought it was pretty cute how they have some Christmas stockings up on the wall. Kind of a fusion. The atmosphere was nice and I really liked the view of Chinatown's Grant Avenue. I was seated for a table of one but the waitress brought me two menus. Okay, maybe she didn't hear me. As I was looking over the menu she brought me a pot of tea that looked like it wanted to overflow. I asked that I have just water instead and she brought me a kettle of hot water. I felt like they were trying hard to please customers that way and I thought it was a bit too much; I am just one person here. \nThe prices are average for the clay pots but I thought it was a little too much for the entrees (for the tourists maybe?). I thought about getting the vegetarian clay pot but I had second thoughts. I wanted the regular Chinese sausage ones with chicken and mushroom in it. So that's what I got. A few moments later the waitress came back with a bowl of ginseng soup which was pretty nice. Then came the clay pot. I was a little disappointed when the waitress told me that the rice wouldn't be included in the clay pot because that's the best part! Anyways I had to settle for the rice not being at the bottom of the clay pot. The clay pot was mostly chicken, garlic, onions, followed by some slices of chinese sausages and a couple of mushrooms. It was fine until I realized how much oil there is in there. I actually felt uncomfortable with all that oil at the bottom of the claypot. It was a couple tablespoonfuls of oil in there! What's the point of them claiming they don't use grease (the sign was right in front of you when you walk all the way up the stairs) when they use that much oil in the food? Eww. So unhealthy. After I couldn't eat anymore I asked for the check and a to-go box to pack up the leftovers. (I know its oily but It's still food) The waitress came back with the check, the to-go box and a bowl of dessert. It was nice and 'sweet' for those complimentary items which sort of makes up for what I was unsatisfied with. The bill came out a total of $11 something. I thought it was expensive.

It is located on the 2nd floor and only signage up front.  The ambiance is reminiscent of Chinatowns all over the world, slightly sketchy, fluorescent lights, clean eating surfaces but nothing fancy.\n\nThe order - Beef chow fun, braised tofu clay pot and salt & pepper pork chop.  The starter was a soup that is typically given at these old-time places.  It's complimentary and given to Chinese patrons.  It usually consists of boiled pork bones, beans, wintermelon and some seeds.  It was tasty and stomach-soothing.  Braised tofu was delicious.  Salt & pepper pork chops were ok but it was heavier on the saltiness rather than spiciness.  There were jalapenos on the plate but the flavor did not make it to chops.\n\nTo be fair, I didn't taste the beef chow fun \"wet style\" as it was devoured by the kids.  So the flavor must be acceptable at the least.  Some odd things I noticed was the presence of black bean and the use of green bell peppers.  The dish typically is oyster sauce-based so having black beans was strange.  The typically vegetable side should be the Chinese broccoli or \"kai lan\" but they used green pepper instead.  Again, strange.\n\nFor those who are Chinese or are familiar, the sweet ending is the traditional sweet bean soup which they offered us.  It was slightly sweeter and thicker than I would've liked but I don't typically like the sweet soup.\n\nThis is good place to eat if you are looking for a simple down-home meal.  The clams with black beans that the other tables were getting looked great.  Again, it's nothing fancy but it is good food.", "author": "Fran C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-15", "description": "Summary:  Worth finding, and a good value for the money.\n\nThis place was full of surprises, noted numerically by [SX] below.\n\n\"No Grease - No Grasa\" - this is the sign that greets you at the entrance to the dining area.  Written in English and Spanish, en caso de que eres de Sudamerica o de la madre patria, but [S1] not in Chinese.  Perhaps those reading Chinese don't find this positive?  [S2]The food was relatively grease free as advertised.\n\nPros:\n* [S3] The food was actually pretty good.   Chinatown is not known for good quality Chinese food, but my first experience there today suggests that I will be back.  My lunch was flavorful, had fresh ingredients, was not buried in some unknown bottled sauce, and had a low level of oil.  \n* [S4] The lunch special is a ridiculous bargain.  It's priced at $4.60 on the menu and your choices include many of the standard Chinese lunch special fare items, including noodle soup.  [S5] It lacked any noodle plates however.  After tax the bill comes to $5.05, and after tip, a whopping $6.00.  Seriously, where can you get a decent, substantial, hot meal for six bucks out the door anywhere near downtown?  What do you get for this price?  You get a very good helping of your entr\u00e9e of choice (I opted to avoid the low-dollar meats and picked the braised tofu with tender greens), along with a side of rice, some very flavorful tea, and a fresh, individually wrapped fortune cookie for dessert.  Quite the bargain, I must say.  \n* The upstairs location of the restaurant gets you above the fray of Grant St, and if you sit next to the window, it's quite pleasant (recognizing of course that you're eating at an inexpensive place in Chinatown).\n* The mixed clientele - at lunch it was roughly 75% Asians (locals I suspect) that knew what they were doing, 20% tourists that probably had ended up there the same way I had (yelp), and 5% business people.   An Asian local joined me at my table and we got to talking.  He showed me a different lunch special menu that had a few more items on it written only in Chinese.  The secret Chinese-only menu can be a true sign that the restaurant is worth visiting.  To me it's basically saying \"We're authentic, and we can survive without pandering to Western tastes\".   Anyway, he ordered a fish dish (listed below) that I'm going to try next time.\n\nCons: \n* Looks a little dirty / run down, which can call hygiene into question, but hey, my sensitive stomach is fine a few hours later.\n\nWhile my lunch was good, and worth every penny of six bucks, I spied a number of tasty looking items that I want to get when I go next - with a group to try more things of course:\n* All of the lunch special items written only in Chinese, including the fish with tofu skin and black mushrooms ordered by my table companion.  \n* The green bean and shrimp lunch special, which looked scrumptious.  \n* Snow pea sprouts and potato sprouts (these both looked delicious and were ordered by an obviously experienced Asian group at a nearby table).\n* Their famous honey walnut prawns.  \n\nI'm not a big meat eater, and I've had enough cheap Chinese experience to not be tempted to order the meat dishes (it's only $4.60, people!), but I will take the risk on seafood from Asia in small quantities.  That being said, there was no shortage of people eating beef and chicken dishes.  \n\nI'll post again if future research contradicts initial findings.", "author": "Xaman E."}

It's been a while since any family outing happened there.  The most recent was with two of my friends back in January for the Lunar New Year.\n\nI suppose one would be skeptical when dinning at a chinese restaurant, especially if you're not chinese or asian for that matter.  Such skepticism would be that it is in a touristy neighborhood, and small space. My two friends were a bit skeptical in the beginning, but after how great the food taste and how service was speedy, they overlooked their pre-judgment. \n\nWe were deciding on several dishes, or a set course, more or less - I sort of wanted control.  To be fair, we each ordered 1 or 2 dishes, with white rice of course (rice is a need not a necessity).  I even questioned if we should get soup since one of my two friends has a slight cold, and actually - house soup of the night came with our order (my friends were intrigued with the texture of the ingredients, one of them being dried frog fallopian tubes - which we call snow jelly in chinese).  \n\nI ordered the Honey Walnut Prawns (one of the best and my favorite), and Stir Fried Chicken with Spring Greens (which was really bok choi).  My two friends ordered Ox Tail Stew with Tofu, and Stir Fried Mustard Greens. \n\nMy friends loved the food, and were amazed with how fast and fresh it was.  Now my two friends are not asian, so chinese food is something they have less of, or actually real chinese food (not the take out we all can get from anywhere). \n\nHKCP is also a great place for dim sum - and I love DIM SUM.  They don't have people pushing carts and yelling out what they have to offer, but a large menu where you note what you want and how many you want works just fine.  Their dim sum is fresh and delicious.\n\nHKCP is a must if anyone is new in San Francisco or just want something other than chinese take out.", "author": "Alex C."}

It's a little hard to find--look for the sign and, apparently, there's usually a man standing at the bottom of the stairs telling people to go up there.  \n\nI really wanted to try a lot of the food on the menu but I only have one stomach.  I ordered the Quail in Clay Pot which was really amazing.  I love ginger and galangal and there was a lot  of galangal in the dish.  My wife ordered the Kung Pao Chicken which neither she nor I was amazed with.  It wasn't bad; it just wasn't anything special.  I have a feeling that all of the food in the clay pots is really good although some of the other reviews say how good other food is.  I really want to order the dinner for 4 when some other people come and eat with us.\n\nI'm not going to complain about servers unless they're just terrible people.  Our server was constantly running around to make sure that everyone was eating their food and had something to drink.  I really like it when servers don't come by your table 400 times asking if you need more whatever.  We had to ask him for extra napkins and water and he brought all of it right away.  \n\nIf there weren't so many restaurants in San Francisco, I would totally go back there immediately.", "author": "Jack T."}

Of course they are lunch sized portions..but they give you a good amt of food! Some other people around me were ordering full sized portions and they were HUGE! I mean one regular portion could easily feed 2 people! The food was super tasty and not oily like some other chinese places! While you are waiting for your food they also bring you some plain soup stock for you to drink. Total bill came out to exactly $10 bucks. and we had at least another meal to bring home (which we did take in a to-go box).\n\nThis isn't your fancy americanized style chinese food here.

So 3.5!  I'm a tough judge when it comes to Chinatown, especially if they've got someone standing outside handing out fliers.  It's just so tacky, but I guess you need to for the business.  It's so competitive...\n\nCame here for dinner the other night with some Yelpers after a very long day of alcohol consumption.  We ordered the set dinner menu.  Some of it was a surprise since we can only read a little bit of Chinese.  \n\nWestlake Soup - not my kind of soup.  Too gloopy.  *gloop gloop*\n\nSeasonal Veggies - so garlicky.  Hours later, I was still burping that deadly scent.  \n\nCrab (Ginger/Scallions) - YUM.  And the shell was soft enough, so it wasn't necessary to get the hands all covered up in sauce.  While a little small, quite delicious.  *THUMBS UP*  \n\nShrimp & Walnuts - very typical dinner menu dish.  Personally, I love it.  It's not a dish that's easy to mess up.  Just make sure you've got fairly fresh ingredients!\n\nTofu/Seafood in Clay Pot - the tofu was delicious!  And the dish was flavorful, so the tofu really soaked it up.  *THUMBS UP*  I have been raving on about this clay pot to the parents because my mom loves that sort of thing.  Might just have to come back for this and the crab.\n\nSalt/Pepper Ribs - we replaced our Sweet & Sour Pork.  This one was just okay.  We still finished this dish off, so it must have been decent.  Or we were just hungry.\n\nRed Bean dessert - the warm soup-like dessert.  It was much too sweet.  Plus, we were all so stuffed that we didn't really need dessert at this point.  \n\nThere might have been one more dish, but I can't remember.  ALL FOR $39.  Divide that by 5.  Teehee.  I'm a little afraid to break the boundary and try the dim sum.  What if it will affect my rating!?  OH NO!", "author": "Tinna H."}

No big deal though, that's what we wanted.  Our service was oooooookay... I mean, the food came hot and fast, but I swore they literally avoided us the entire night.

It's definitely easy to miss if you're not paying attention.    (as others mentioned, all you see is a long flight of stairs and an asian woman handing out menus.)  However, the nice thing is that there is a parking garage on (I think) Pacific.  Rather convenient if you're driving and don't want to deal with finding a parking spot.  \n\nI wasn't sure if they spoke mandarin (i expected cantonese for sure, but I can't speak cantonese), but luckily they did.  We ordered more food just to be able to try a variety of dishes since it was our first time there:\n- seafood clay pot - the chinese name of this dish actually is seafood tofu clay pot.  Very delicious!\n- salt/pepper pork ribs - pretty darn good\n- large pea leaves - garlic was in one piece which I loved (so I could avoid it easily, but still reaped the benefits of its flavor) and the pea leaves were tender and not all stem.\n\nI guess my mandarin is improving because the gentleman taking our order asked us if that was it.  I was a little puzzled and asked him if that wasn't enough.  He laughed and said \"rice?\".  we laughed as well and ordered rice.  He still looked at us expectantly, but I couldn't figure out what else he was thinking we needed.  \n\nAnd then, he brought us some soup.  Of course!  You always need to start the meal with soup!  This was some sort of house special which was VERY tasty.  Clear broth with some ginseng-scent, peanuts, tendony type meat (I couldn't tell what it was, but it was good).  we tried to figure out what this soup was, but couldn't tell from the menu.  We later described it to our aunt who thought it wasn't listed on the menu,but was a daily-hey-what-have-we-got-special (her guess: oxtail soup).

Also had the Peking pork chops - with just enough fattiness and crispiness to complement the tangy and sweet sauce coating the chops.

We ordered the honey walnut prawns which were freaking delicious the walnuts were super good the prawns were cooked perfectly. Then the other order came...we got beef chow mein which was avg and greasy...nothing special or bad. Then we got the beef clay pot....ew! First off it was more tofu then beef and second it had like some funky flavor like cinnamon or something...it was disgusting! I had to try to get rid of the flavor with pizza! The beef in the pot was nasty...it was more tendon and ligament then meat and it was not tender either... coupled with the cinnamon flavor it was awful. I would come back for the honey walnut prawns but would say the beef pot was disgusting. Also if youre an avg sized guy the prices aren't that cheap cause the portions aren't that generous. Im 175 lbs and I wasnt too full after about 27 bucks worth of food between me and my much less hungry gf. But maybe it's because I didn't eat all the beef clay pot?", "author": "Benny C."}

Pretty clean. Mostly Chinese ppl there, few outsiders. Looks out onto Grant if you get a window view (nice!). Had an all over 'authentic' feel (I haven't been to China so I could be wrong, but it felt homey yet distinctly Chinese)\n\nThe service: A+. My dad's cousin tends to crack silly jokes with anything and anyone (it's a family thing). The waiter actually laughed and cracked his own jokes, he and the other waitstaff were attentive yet not overbearing, which I've heard is very chinese in style. All the waitstaff were kind/inobtrusive and we never felt like outsiders at all. Food also arrived relatively quickly and our seafood was wonderfully fresh!\n\nBeverages: One of my guests had wanted a juice/ iced tea alternative. I realize this is not typically Chinese, but just note that they only have beers, hot tea, and sodas -  not sure if there's something like iced coffee??? In any case there was no beverage menu.\n\nFood: fantastic!!! Gigantic portions, great quality and pretty good value for your money. We ordered 5 'main' dishes, one appetizer and 3 tsing tao beers and we spent $49 (w/o tip). We stuffed our faces till we hurt, had leftovers enough for 2 ppl. I am rarely impressed by restaurants, but this was so good I had to sign up for a yelp acct.\n\n We ordered:\n--wonton soup (gigantic!!) with deliciously sizeable won tons- fantastic\n--spring rolls - fresh veggies inside, freshly fried. wonderful even heated up\n--salty fish in chicken fried rice - this was the 'test of authenticity' for my uncle - and he LOVED it. Not too salty, just perfect\n-- bitter melon beef (in black bean sauce) - the beef was good but I apparently don't like bitter melons. overall tasty\n-- beef chow fun (spelling??) - this was the only reason I took off a star, the 'flat noodles' weren't well separated during cooking. And although the taste was great it wasn't the best dish. I felt I could have gotten a slightly better version at R&G lounge for example.\n--seafood clay pot - PIECE DE RESISTANCE!! amazing!!! I am very picky about my seafood but this was a totally fresh succulent dish. I'll come here with all my friends and guests just because of this dish.\n\nOverall we came out of this lunch with very satisfied bellies and my san francisco visitors were very very happy with the experience. I would have liked to give them a 4.5 - but since I've only been here once I'll keep it at a solid 4 for now.\n\nHint: go towards the next block (south on Grant) to free tea tasting (look for a dude called Kenny - great showman)", "author": "Acid B."}

The location was great being at one end of our grant street trek and near the fortune cookie factory.  At first we were not too sure about climbing the stairs, as well as the ambience of the surrounding area, but the extra climb paid off.  When we arrived we were promptly seated at one of the large round tables.  The lady that greeted us was very nice, and very to the point, in fact everybody who helped us were quite friendly.  The dinning room was decorated with simple yet traditional d\u00e9cor.  My family and I ordered the Mandarin family dinner for four which came with won ton soup, sweet and sour chicken, prawn fried rice, pot-stickers, garlic prawns, and Mongolian beef (which we substituted with chicken chow mien), and beef with greens (bok choy).  I also ordered the curry chicken clay pot as well.  Let me start off with the pot-stickers, which were the first to go.  The size of them were huge compared to many other restaurants, and both orders were cooked perfectly; crisp on the bottom warm filling and soft on the top, yes we ordered more.  The curry chicken was also outstanding; it came out still boiling in the clay pot filling the table with its aroma.  Overall every plate of food we had was great.  All of the tastes were fresh, the bok choy tasted like fresh bok choy, while not being masked by the beef gravy.  The sweet and sour wasn't heavy or greasy, the won ton soup light and flavorful.  If I could give four and a half stars I would.  Overall great food, great price worth the stair climb.", "author": "Robert M."}

My date and I both agreed that every dish we ate lacked flavor and quality. we were both hungry and got some advice from locals to check this place out, save yourself the trip because im sure there are better chinese food spots around town. \n\non another note, we heard alot of people around us order pork dishes, so its possible the place may be just good at serving up good pork dishes because the place seemed to have a good street cred, but sadly the food just didnt stack up. \n\nspecifically, the green beans they used were your ordinary green beans you find in the supermarket as opposed to the more delicious chinese green bean variety ( tastier, trust me). \n\nthe cashew chicken was the worst dish we had. it had little flavor and was pretty ordinary (just chicken, pea pods, baby corn and cashew). nothing exciting or worth bragging about.  \n\nthe shrimp kung pao was decent, but nothing more than that. big pieces of shrimp but it lacked a lot of flavor and didnt taste so fresh.\n\non the plus side, the prices are very reasonable so check this place out for its prices at best. otherwise, go spend 8-10 dollars more and have a flavorful meal somewhere else.", "author": "kareem r."}

The food really took my hangover away! \nWe had wonton soup, mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken (all for well under $20). The only reason I knock off a star is because the wonton soup wasn't the best I've had. Although the wontons were good, the broth was a little bland. I've definitely had better. \nWe were the only non-Asian people in there, so the place must be authentic - is that what that means?? Don't really know since, again, I don't eat much Chinese food.
