You order before finding a seat and you should be able to find one by the time you order. The layout is pretty cool with some tables inside (small section upstairs and a couple on the ground floor) that seem pretty nice to chill and do work at. There's also a bunch of seating outside to enjoy with your four legged friend. \n The eggs were pretty fluffy and if you ask for a bagel with just eggs and cream cheese in it, then they give you A LOT of eggs - overflows and drapes over the bagel like a dress.  \nHeads up, the large yogurt bowl is pretty big with tons of fruit and good for like 2 people. \nLox bagel is filled with a lot of smoked salmon and the breakfast burrito is stuffed with eggs - satisfying breafast.  I wouldn't say the food stood out to me that much. Dont get me wrong though. It was solid, good food with great presentation, and I really enjoyed it, but there wasn't anything especially unique. The service was pretty good too. I'd definitely come back here because overall it was a good experience.", "author": "Rachelle C."}

There were no photos of Seabiscuit or Mr. Ed on the walls. The name could refer to the mental state of the customers who linger here as it's a becalming spot that doesn't induce fits of hysteria unless we all start talking about the current political landscape. Actually I found out later that the building was once a carriage house so now I get it. I came in here thinking I could get a light breakfast after my gym workout, and I was right as they have quite a menu of creative-sounding global dishes made with fresh, organic ingredients.\n\nI had every intention of choosing between the yogurt with granola or the hot oats, but what appealed to me in the moment was the $6 Piaf, which was a roasted tomato topped with scrambled eggs and slices of brie (photo: http://bit.ly/2wrVssH). With a good dousing of hot sauce, it was a light, delicious treat since it had been a while since I had eaten eggs. I added a satisfying $3.50 Four Barrel Cafe au Lait to complete the meal (photo: http://bit.ly/2Bz0glH). I liked the vibe so much I came back a few weeks later to have the same Cafe au Lait out on their enclosed terrace which serves as a community space (photo: http://bit.ly/2wjJFfI).

There are so many hidden gems in San Francisco like this one... I'm a sucker for gorgeous and serene outdoor patios. I ordered coffee and food at the front cash register. There were salads and sandwiches galore on the menu, but the special said TACOS. How could I resist? They sounded amazing.\n\nI took my number and entered the not-so-secret garden. I found two seats since I was meeting my friend and broke out my laptop to get some work done. It was hard to concentrate, being around so many people and beautiful succulents. I typically work from home, so this was a special treat. I also realized that I totally could have brought my dog here. There was even a water bowl, the universal signal for pet-friendliness. \n\nThe shredded beef tacos were amazing. I don't remember what other ingredients there were, but the flavors were unique, and the amount of food was plentiful for lunch. I was in a happy place. My friend met up with me, and we had a good conversation... which worked out since WiFi was down that day. Oh well, I guess it was a sign that I needed to get out and relax for once.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

We landed at Stable Cafe. The interior is a bit cozy, but the outdoor seating is what makes this place. It's a huge space, and has tons of plants to make it feel like a secret garden. It would be perfect to eat outside on a nice day. Ordering is casual as you go up to the counter tops and place your order.\n\nFor their coffee, they use four barrel beans. I was excited for my drink and ordered a cappuccino. Honestly, wasn't very impressed with it. The coffee portion seemed a bit weak, and it wasn't as foamy as I would have liked my drink to be. For my meal, I ordered stable eggs, which came with two sunny side up eggs, baguette toast, salami, and asparagus. The food was okay, but there wasn't anything exceptional about it. The toast was probably the best part of it. \n\nThe order comes out pretty quickly though, and the servers are helpful. Pricing is also great for SF living. I would plan breakfast better next time and try a different place. Although if you're looking for a good outdoor ambiance, then this is your place.", "author": "Jackie C."}

The bagels are evenly toasted to add a good amount of crunch to the sandwich. Breakfast of champions! I only wish they spread the herb cream cheese on both side of the bagels instead of just the bottom. Service is always friendly and it's fun to chat with the staff while waiting for your order. I typically get my stuff within 10 minutes of ordering and then I'm on my way to the office with my breakfast in hand!

The chai was definitely one of the best ones I've had ever in the city, foamy, flavorful, but not gritty or overly sweet. I enjoyed the manchego and fig scone. Their baked pastries seem to be the best items. We also had their quiche and scrambled eggs. The eggs were way overdone, like cooked hard. The quiche has meat in it. Boo liked it, and said that the orange sauce it came with was delicious. We agreed that the breakfast was just alright, but the drinks were our favorite part.\n\nThere is serve-yourself water and a buss-your-own-table-system.

So many vibes. Knowing my love for the aforementioned patios, plants, and vibes, a friend took me to Stable to grab some breakfast and get some work done. This spot is right up my alley--I honestly could've sat there all day, ordering multiple rounds of coffee and toast and testing out different corners of the coffee shop and patio. \n\nThis cafe has some nice breakfast-y options--mostly things on good, crusty bread. I ordered a cup of coffee and an avocado toast. Now, there are lots of ways you can avo toast--you can smash it or mash it, slice it. top it with lemon...don't even get me started on salts. Stable slices their avocado and tops that with a hard boiled egg--while I'd personally prefer a soft boiled egg and mashed avocado, this was pretty bomb. We ate out on the patio, which was a total dream. There was even a little wood burning stove in the back surrounded by the prettiest plants--not sure what they use it for, but it was gorgeous.\n\nThe servers here are a hoot and were so kind. They have a few beer and wine options if you want to sit and stay awhile, plus a dessert or two to satisfy your sweet tooth.

We got the Stable Eggs and Pomba. I really like the idea of local, farm-fresh ingredients, but the Pomba was just too heavy for me (the brie gelled up in the cold weather rather quickly), and the Stable Eggs was something I could've easily assembled at home, not seasoned particularly well.\n\nService: Nothing to complain about, it's a quick line up to the register where you order and pay, and then you seat yourself with your number and the server brings the food to your table. My encounter with the cashier was pleasant, and he entertained me and my friends' fight to grab the check (obviously it's my turn to pay, Brian).\n\nAmbiance: I actually loved the ambiance, and this totally made the brunch so much more fun. We explored the back (they were having some sort of cheese-centric cooking class?) and found a variety of plants and cookbooks for sale. Such a cute and wild piece of jungle in the middle of the city.\n\nOverall, I think I'd come back here if I needed to stop by for a quick bite and didn't want to wait in 3-hour SF brunch lines.

The NONO open face sandwich was a no-no for me. Nothing special and the flavor was lacking. It wasn't appealing to the eyes especially with the provolone melted on top of the eggs making them look more pale and sad. The toast was difficult to cut thru, even adding bacon couldn't save the meal for me. My gf said the chilaquiles were okay but also felt nothing special to them. Almost $30 for both dishes and an OJ was definitely not worth it! \n\n3 stars for the atmosphere and good service we received when placing our order. I would come back only to get coffee and sit outside on a nice sunny day. I'll stay away from the food or maybe go with something simple/cheap like the avocado toast.", "author": "D B."}

There's basically nothing else around this area.\n\nFood: The menu is small, but the choices are mouthwatering. For $7, I got the Pomba (toast, bacon, brie, and egg in the hole). The toast is Texas toast, lightly buttered and perfectly toasted. The bacon is nicely cooked with crisp edges, but still slightly chewy. The brie was laid over the hot toast and egg, making it melt and ooze into all the crevices. The egg was cooked to perfection and nicely scrambled in the hole. Two blackberries for garnish and this dish was just everything I could want in a sinfully delicious breakfast. So filling, it kept me going 'til we had an early dinner later that day!\n\nCoffee: I got a latte with almond milk. Delicious. And cute coffee art on the top. Also bonus points for serving coffee in glass -- I'm a fan of this trend.\n\nService: You order at the counter and they bring the food to your number wherever you decide to sit. However, you need to grab your coffee yourself. I wanted a latte with 2% milk, but they only had whole milk and nonfat. The employee suggested a mixture of the two, but I said nonfat was fine. Then she suggested almond milk. It was like she read my mind! Always a fan of almond milk. Friendly service for sure :)\n\nAmbiance: Cute place where you can have a leisurely breakfast, or grab something quick if you have 15 minutes to spare. They have a small seating area inside and a larger patio area outside adorned with a lot of cute drought-resistant plants.

You find a place to have coffee and fall in love with everything about the cafe... To the point you start to get excited every time you have an appointment in that part of town - so you can go back, try something new and love it all over again. This is that place. \nCome alone, come on business, come with friends or an afternoon date - just definitely try Stable. The food, drinks and coffee will never dissapoint. The staff is the friendliest and the space, indoors and out, is beautiful/comfortable/laid back perfection. \nAnd now it looks like they are adding night events. Wine and chocolate this Friday?

You don't want to wait for a table. \n\nWhere do you go?\n\nStable Cafe.\n\nIt seems like this is a secret spot of sorts since it's far out on Folsom st., but only a few blocks away from the craziness that is the area around Dolores Park. \n\nM. Davis designs did a swell job on converting this former police horse stable into a fully functional cafe without sacrificing the aesthetics: sliding glass barn door, terraniums, local art, loft style seating and lots of exposed beams. The sunlit filled space is super inviting, although I wish the seating was more comfortable. My tushie can't handle hard wood for more than 2 hours. Also,something a lot of coffee shops in SF don't have: a landscaped courtyard on the adjacent lot.\n\nI love hanging out here whether I'm around the Mission or after attending dance class at ODC. Coffee beans are courtesy of Dela Paz. The cafe Americano is spot on, the watermelon agua fresca is thirst quenching and their brunch menu delivers: huevos rancheros (offered as a special on the weekends), Nona (egg in a hole with bacon and brie), bagels, etc.  The eggs are locally grown by the owner at his farm in Petaluma and you can't get any fresher than that! \n\nI've yet to try the pies from Three Babes Bakeshop, a pop-up on the weekends selling delicious pies for $5/slice. More reasons to come back! ;-)", "author": "Janice C."}

It's located near Folsom and 17th so a bit off the craziness on Mission. Maybe that explains why this place isn't too overly busy at times where you have to wait 30mins plus elsewhere to get a table.\n\nThe menu offers a variety of healthy breakfast choices - from yogurt, oatmeal, to bagels and sandwiches that are mostly combinations of either panini or dark bread with egg, and cheese/bacon/veggies on the side. I tried the Pomba (toast, bacon, brie, egg in the hole, $7) and Nono (eggs, tomato, cheese, toast, $7). Both was good but the portion size not too large. I was actually still hungry afterwards.\n\nThe coffee however was great - you can get French Press ($2.75) or regular coffee that was nicely bold and flavorful.\n\nApart from the food, nice job on the interior (fellow Yelper Janice C. mentioned it used to be a police horse stall before?) - Stable Cafe is not too big but they made the most of the rather small interior. \n\nI'll be back here when I'm in the area!", "author": "Sebastian F."}

It is a hard job and mostly because of all the decisions you have to make. There are lots of places who promise to save you from some of those decisions by providing a one stop shop for your wedding. You could be in a very nice venue having a very nice meal with your friends and family and be totally happy. We went to wine country and a few other destinations around the bay area and kept thinking we could do better everywhere we went. We just didn't want the same wedding, with the same white chairs, under the same trellis arch. \n\nWe met in the city and decided to get married in the city. Minah and her team at Stable helped us arrange a perfect night in their beautiful space. They were incredibly accommodating to our needs and to our other vendors. Our coordinator told us one story about them needing to pull out a ladder and fix a tree branch which had fallen and just would not have looked right, just in time for our guests arrival. A lot of people will add stress to the days before your wedding, but not Stable Cafe. They are easy-going and extremely helpful.\n\nOne of the more important thing is that they are willing to work with any caterer and have an amazing kitchen. Trust me, this is a huge benefit.

The breakfast and panini menu are off to your right, the lunch menu is to your left semi-hidden by the flight of stairs, and there are additional options written on the glass with a display of the food.\n\nI had the Mate Latte (I admit I ordered this partly because it's fun to say, but also because I am a fan of Yerba Mate). Intriguing - you can definitely taste the Yerba Mate and the drink is a comforting, pastel-green color. Overall it was pretty mild.\nI had the chicken sandwich, which was ok. The patty was a bit overcooked and big, but I enjoyed the roasted peppers and provolone. I also had my sister's chicken panini. I'm always a fan of panini because of the way the cheese melts and melds with the bread. In this case the chicken was cut too thickly and the cheese took a backseat.\n\nI also know Stable Cafe has their Winter Warmer Wednesdays, collaborating with the Cheese School for happy hours (cheese galore for $15) so that might be worth checking out. I haven't been to it myself so can't vouch for it. Also it's supposed to run until the end of January so I'm not sure if it will be around much longer. \n\nOverall, would I come back? It's a cute cafe. It shares a space with a succulents nursery and the SF Cheese School, so on nice days take your food out to the courtyard and enjoy the sunshine.

The servers were energetic and friendly, made my hibiscus mimosa the second I ordered it, and with a smile. They brought our food out promptly, again with smiles and jokes. \n\nLets talk about the most delightful thing about stable...the SPACE. It is just so beautiful. It caught my eye while I was driving by, and I knew we had to check it out ASAP. Turns out that SF gave us a gorgeous week, and stable was the perfect place to enjoy the weather. The modern rustic vibe, the gorgeous garden with succulents adorning the walls, the garden in the back, the open spacious interior...we sat there for hours, re-ordering plate after plate because we just wanted a reason to stay longer. \n\nSure, the food isn't michelin rated, but it's a cafe, relax! We had a pear/brie panini, and a fig/goat panini. I wasn't into the fig nor did I like the choice of bread, but did enjoy the pear/brie. The quinoa salad was excellent though, refreshing and great for a warm day. \n\nPlease go enjoy the space. You owe it to yourself.", "author": "Sylvie C."}

I have sampled other panini's from friends, which are still pretty good but I always stick with my tomato, mozzarella, and pesto. Their ingredients are so fresh yet so simple. I have even ordered this same panini combo at several other places, but theirs taste like sh*t compared to Stable's. Seriously, you will be amazed how much simple quality ingredients make a big difference.\n\nThey have a large outdoor seating area which I really enjoy and Stable is located in a great area of SF that is usually sunny. It's a great spot to have lunch with friends and enjoy just the comforting ambiance that Stable brings.", "author": "Liana D."}

Reasonable prices and the typical SF, hipster urbanite clientele but never super-packed.  I've had the mate latte (good) and some breakfast items (good) and have always been pretty pleased.

It was pretty evident from the first interaction with the staff that at least one staff member was drunk or high. But hey, as long as they do their jobs, who cares?\n\nWe both separately ordered a Luna; I also got a cup of coffee and he an Americano. For some reason, I was given a table number placard and he was not. I assumed that would be because they would deliver both our meals to the same table--that turned out not to be the case.\n\nI ordered first, but he got his coffee first. After about 5 minutes of waiting for my coffee, I asked about it, and was bafflingly told, \"We drank it.\" Okay? I asked for a new one, and they made it for me.\n\nUpstairs at our table, I got my food about ten minutes later. They took the table number away, leaving us to wonder how they would know where to bring my friend's food. I ended up finishing my meal before my friend got his--and we ordered the same thing within a minute of each other. He went down to ask about it. \n\nMeanwhile, the couple next to us had the complete wrong order brought to one of them, and the one whose food did not arrive also went downstairs to complain.\n\n(Edit: My friend finally got his food and filled me in on his trip downstairs. Apparently, he dealt with a second waitress who was also obviously in an altered state, who was eating and drinking while he was trying to converse with her, and she didn't seem to care much about the situation.)\n\nMy friend came back upstairs and a few minutes later, the obviously-impaired server followed. Clearly having a trouble time forming a coherent sentence, and giggling the whole time, she told him, \"We're going to take a little longer making your Luna, okay?\" Not caring to make a fuss, my friend said that was fine.\n\nBy this point the guy at the table next to us who got the right order had finished his, and his partner was still downstairs trying to figure out where hers was. They received a complimentary cookie as an apology (they said it tasted disgusting).\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, my friend got fed up with waiting and went downstairs to check again. He was told, completely inexplicably, that they simply weren't making his order and had forgotten about it. They said they would start again.\n\nEventually, the table next to us got their correct order, preposterously late. At this point we had been there close to an hour in total. My friend suggested I just head over to the office without him, since who knows when this debacle would finally resolve itself? So I did that, and then I started writing this review. He still doesn't have his food.\n\nNice one, Stable. Bang-up job. You've inspired the second Yelp review I've ever written in my life.", "author": "Chris R."}

Not sure what genre it was but it was better then all other cafe music i've heard. Great face, away from busy but close to busy. Parking was cake. The place is not in a busy area but of walking distance to busy-ness. No line and plenty of seating. Three Babes Bakeshop and Stable Cafe share the outdoor seating area. I'm such an idiot for ordering at Stable Cafe and not ordering anything from Three Bades Bakeshop (they server mini pies). \n\n- Food, good (fresh and organic)\n- Price, decent\n- Service, good\n- Ambiance, cute cozy cafe\n\nPassed this place everytime I do my grocery shopping at Rainbow Groceries. It was definately one of those Sundays where \"it's too damn nice to be inside doing nothing\". I've dedicated Sundays as cafe days when I have no plans and nowhere to be; hiding from the world \"LEAVE ME ALONE\" kind of mood because I need to catch up on a book.\n\nHEFFER-STYLE STATUS.\n\n**See picture**\n\nPOMBA ($6.50) - the menu online is false, i was charged $6.50. It was toast, bacon (cant eat meat at this time), gouda, and a whole egg. Presentation of the place was clean; didnt understand why the bacon and the slice of gouda made an \"X\" over my toast. When they say \"A WHOLE EGG\" they literally cut a perfect circle in my thick slice of toast and put the egg inside (pretty cool!). It was a simple breakfast, nothing filling. I did not feel heavy after eating. \n\nHOT COCOA (~$2+) - off the caffine and had to go with a different hot beverage. cocoa was creamy and smooth. they did not and nor did i, add any sugar. servered in a glass cup with a cool crooked spoon.\n\nPELLIGRINO (~$2) - ordered me some snotty water to quench my thirst.\n\nIt was lunchtime and other people around me have ordered lunch items. I am a fool, i totally should have ordered a lunch item. They looked healthy and filling and the sandwiches look great. I suggest coming here to get lunch over breakfast.\n\nWill I be back? Yes (for lunch). Its not like all those other cafe's in the city where it's overly packed.

It was also grossly lukewarm.  One star up for having soy milk available as one of the creamers.  I ordered a cheese scone and a bagel with PB&J.  The scone was pretty good but the bagel was a complete and utter bust.  Stale and, while it came with peanut butter, it also came with orange marmalade.

I'm a regular (I go to Stable about every other week, and have been doing so for the past year or so), and am always surprised at my final bill, the size of my food/drinks, and how quickly (or not) my food arrives.  I don't get the sense that new employees are trained very thoroughly.  One example of this: the Mate Latte.  Usually it comes in a large cup, and is perfect - just sweet enough, the mate is perfectly steeped, etc. Sometimes though, it's in a small cup (for the same price!), no honey, and too bitter to drink.  The only pattern seems to be that new employees in particular really struggle with making the drink, which makes me think that more training before they get behind the counter would be helpful. \n\nOr the french press coffee. There are two prices: $2 for a small, and $2.75 for a large.  However, there was a period of time when suddenly all \"for here\" prices for coffee changed to $2.75 for a small coffee, no refills. I asked why, and was told by a new employee, \"It's just how we do it here.\"   So now I just order my coffee in a to-go cup to avoid the confusion, even if I plan to drink it at Stable (saves me .$75 too, if I order a small). \n\nI've also gotten basic sandwiches that should come with ham, without any ham (and lots of eye-rolling if asked for a side of ham to add to the sandwich).  Or  wraps that are missing bacon. Or sandwiches on a bagel that should be on a croissant.\n\nSometimes I'm overcharged, sometimes undercharged. I'll point this out if I notice while I'm there, but, with a menu that's relatively straightforward (at least for brunch), I'm not sure why there's so much variance in the bill.  \n\nThe people behind the counter can be friendly and nice, or completely rude. \n\nI keep coming to Stable though because the food is just SO GOOD.

I still can't figure out a reasoning for. My friend and I then waited quite a bit of time for our food, which later didn't make too much sense because the portions were so small. So my brother, who was also wondering where his latte was after 15 minutes, and I decided to go inside and see what was taking so long. The two waitresses we're hanging out behind the counter having a conversation, while five plates were sitting next to them getting cold. They then brought out our food, but the waited another 5-10 minutes for my friend to get her food and my brothers latte. \n\nThe food was good and the outdoor space was beautiful, but based on the poor service I received I will never go back. I would much rather have anyone give me great friendly service, than a Urban Outfitter Model with no work ethic.", "author": "Valentina E."}

The outdoor area is faaaantastic! Perfect set up and gorgeous!  Outside brunch is always nice-- especially because it's hard to find a lot of out door seating in this city! \n\nI've been to Stable many times and from reading the other reviews, I can see how I differ a bit.  I'm from the east coast so I am used to a bit more 'direct' customer service but I never got the rude vibe.  Maybe other people like the overly cheesy service that, in my opinion, is way more obnoxious than the \"hey, how's it going... what can I get you.. anything else?... okay, here's your change, thanks\" interaction I've had with the baristas at Stable.\n\nOverall, I recommend this place- just make sure to ask for that side salad :)", "author": "Milagro J."}

I can't tell you how many people say the same thing to me about this place... \"good food/coffee but it takes *forever*!\"\n\nThere's rarely much of a line there, which gives you a false sense of how long it will take. \n\nI like the food, generally. However, on several occasions they just pulled one of the hours-old display sandwiches out of the case, heat it up and charge you as if it'd been fresh (part of the price is for freshness and not getting sick from food poisoning, no?)\n\nI'd easily change my rating to a 5 if they hired cooks who knew how to hustle and didn't try to get away with serving me old, contaminated, soggy food from the display case!! It's not just gross and insulting, it's dangerous. The staff have obviously never been trained in food safety. Even BK and McD's throw their food out if it sits around for a fraction of the time Stable thinks is acceptable. I've taken culinary arts classes and know how little time it takes bacteria to grow at room temp... \n\nI think they're trying to solve their speed problem by cutting food safety corners though. If they try to pull the display model after you order, stop them! Tell them they're nasty, lazy and unsafe for trying to get away with that. It's not just rude, they are risking your health and they need to stop!\n\nIf you don't, you'll end up with indigestion - at the very least.\n\nIf they can get their stuff together, it'd be nice to see them stay around. Do they not realize how many more people per day they'd serve (and more money they'd make) if the speed of service were improved?? People who like them would stop avoiding them. If I walk in and see more than one person waiting to order, I know I'm in for at least 15 mins and I walk out.", "author": "Paul E."}

Now let me get something straight, the food, coffee and interior (as well as exterior) was phenomenal!! And would give five stars had I not ordered..\nThe woman who helped me had a long braided pony tail, which you know, kudos on the hair, but she is the reason I will never return. She had an extremely rude tone and seemed very upset that I was ordering (or breathing for that matter) I asked about a breakfast item and she very Loudly responded \"BREAKFAST IS OVER AT TEN\"... Okay homegirl sorry I've never been here calm down, I proceed to ask if the quiche is available \"the quiche?!? Yes!\" Okay... Can I get that and a panini..? \"YOU WANT THE QUICHE AND A PANINI?! THE PANINI I SUGGESTED?!\" Yea sure.. \nAND THEN, after handing her my card she hands it back, with receipt and pen, but almost drops it as my hands were full and funny thing is there is more than enough counter space to set it on especially since I have to sign which requires a hard surface.

After getting tips from Yelp about their free wifi, cheap pannini, and generally friendly ambiance, I decided to make a visit and put in a few hours of work. The structural layout came as advertised; it had a cute outdoor seating area next to the caf\u00e9 and large windows with a second floor to host laptop users. \n\nThe place is cute and tiny with a long line of people waiting to order that tend to cluster from the entrance to the register. The menu was posted behind the staircase that was invisible until you get to the register. I was attracted to several menu items that included their sandwich items ($8) and their good looking empanadas behind the case. Instantly excited about the prospect of a productive afternoon, I ordered a mushroom and a spinach empanadas ($4.50 each) and pressed coffee ($2.25). It wasn't until I received the food and went upstairs I realized that the caf\u00e9 did not have any plugs on the walls and the other laptop users could only stay as long as their battery life would let them. What a bummer. They also ran out of soy--until Monday--so my coffee tasted horrible even with brown sugar added. My empanadas were decent but quite expensive. It was not warm all the way through to the middle, but the fillings were still pretty tasty. I thought it tasted better with the side of smoky chipotle sauce that had a nice kick, but otherwise I wished I had ordered their sandwiches or simply go elsewhere for a better meal.\n\nService was rushed and I felt compelled to bus my own dishes even when I had already left a tip. My visit was brief as I didn't even bother to break open my laptop. It was a wasted effort as I had to trek across town to find another caf\u00e9 to get my work going. I thought their food was decent but not worthwhile when nearby options are better and more affordable.  In the end, the caf\u00e9 was not laptop friendly and did not fulfill the purpose of my visit. 2 stars for the experience.", "author": "Daniel L."}

I got that odd feeling that I was being stared at looked behind me and he just held it up like here it is. All this without saying a word.  So bizarre.\n\nSo I found a new seat.

Not only was the Toast, Egg, Bacon, and Brie was the bomb but the businesses made me smile especially since I'm a Entrepreneur at heart.  The Container stole my heart!

The tomato soup was yummy, I only wish they used fresh chives to garnish instead of dried because it would've added a nice flavor. The crostini was great to break up and throw in the soup like croutons. Salad was light and fresh and perfectly dressed.

They have a tiny space in which to enter, order food, and I don't care for the way the cream, sugar, and condiments are laid out.  \n\nThe regular coffee is made in a large french presses; it gets a little cool for my taste between when they pour a carafe and the time it gets into my hands, when I proceed to douse it with cream. \n\nIt's a generally awkward when I come here for a quick bite or a cup of coffee. I feel like some corporate New Yorker who 'doesn't have time for this!!' \n\nThe menu is great (and small, but changes) for both lunch and dinner, but think of this place as being on the 'slow-food' tip.  I really enjoyed the breakfast sandwich for it's wholesome slices of thick wheat bread, and scrambled egg folded with cheese- it's a great take on the breakfast sammy for $5.75.  Yes, pricey.  \n\nOne last comment is they have a space available to rent for events and a catering company in conjunction with the cafe.  I like to imagine holding an even there.  Apparently they have a farm or some sort of property they are cultivating to get food directly for their business, which is super super cool.  A dynamic business.", "author": "Melissa B."}

I'm sure it happens on here more than not, but this, I think, is my first time.  I like the salsa at Papalote.  It's got a great texture, good spice, and it is a good compliment to the food they serve.  Some people say it is the best salsa (for it's type) in the city.  I might have agreed at one point...that is until this morning when I went to Stable Cafe.\n\nI will be first to admit I wasn't thrilled with the coffee.  They don't have Splenda or artificial sweetener and no different selection of milks/creams.  Call me a coffee snob.  It's fine.  I am.  I know what I like, and so do you.  \n\nAlong with the coffee, however, i got the egg wrap.  It was a huge portion and came with a tiny shot of this chipotle salsa that looked almost exactly like the stuff from Papalote.  It wasn't.  It had way more kick and opened up my eyes and taste buds, the way you'd expect a good cup of coffee to.  This was the winner.

Their in-house cup is about the size of a medium and they give you a free refill. I've been here twice and there is usually a line almost out the door each time. It's not too hard to do though, considering it's a fairly small joint on the inside. \n\nThere's an upstairs that has about six tables and a small bar with stools. Down side is that, although they have free wireless, there aren't many (if any) electrical outlets in the place. I sat upstairs both times and never found one, so unless you have extraordinary battery life on your lappy, don't expect to have any nerd marathons. \n\nThe place is clean and well lit, with the charm of it having actually been a livery stable as it's original incarnation. The exposed beams and original fixtures add antiquity to the atmosphere. More of an adult place, I wouldn't really recommend bringing children here, as space is fairly limited and the menu seems to cater to a more mature palate (i.e. not many juices or \"kid-friendly\" food choices). \n\nI gave this place 5 stars because they have their own farm where they get much of their produce and their eggs. They are locally sustainable and I find that absolutely charming. The food is good and well-priced, and I liked the general atmosphere. I've never been treated like a dick here, even when I forgot to tip once. \n\nThey usually make/give you your drink right away, then give you a number for your table if you order food. They also bring your food to you, instead of shouting out order numbers. \n\nI hear they have a pretty awesome patio.

If I lived closer and it was more convenient, I'd give it another star. \n\nFirst off, the photos will make it seem that the cafe is much bigger than it is.  It's pretty darn small, actually - only about 12 small cafe tables, split between a main and loft level. And while there's also a nice little patio for outside seating, it's not often that it's warm enough to want to sit outside.  \n\nThat being said, what is here is actually quite beautiful and well-designed.  The food's delicious, the coffee is tasty, and the space (small as it is) is actually quite airy and nice.   \n\nWireless is spotty (which I never understand - if you're a cafe/work space kind of thing, please, please PLEASE have solid wireless service, otherwise I can't really do the \"work\" part of cafe/work).  That would get you another star. \n\nParking is kind of a pain, surprisingly.  You wouldn't think this was a particularly busy corner in SF, but there's quite a bit of construction going on in the neighborhood, taking up a lot of available street parking, so be aware of that.  But that should correct itself soon. \n\nOverall, if you live in/near the neighborhood, it's a great little cafe to come work for a couple hours and get a nice breakfast or lunch.

I needed to kill about 2 hours to do some report writing and work e-mails before meeting up with a colleague for lunch.  I want to try out all the best cafes in SF and for some reason this was going to be one of my faves.  Parking was a nightmare and turning every street corner looking for parallel parking was like waiting in holiday traffic on the 101.  \n\nFinally, I find a spot and even get more excited as I walk into this very clean and modern looking cafe.  There was a short line in front of me, so I decided to step out of an opened side door to be additionally surprised by the outside patio area...instantly thinking about future coffee dates with friends.  I order an Iced Mocha and proceed upstairs, which is basically a loft that overlooks downstairs and provides great opportunities for people watching.  My Iced Mocha was strong, tasty, and the perfect size.  The WiFi is free and the restroom was super clean!  It was a bit warm at first, but they opened up the front door to let a nice breeze come in.  There is potential for a lot of noise from conversations at the tables next to you, but it all depends on the time and if you're sitting near loud people.  \n\nNo need to waste your time at chain coffee joints.

I have had a lot of food quality and service problems during that time, but I kept going back because I enjoyed the atmosphere, the music, and the eggs and have had a nice rapport with the managers. \n\nI can really relate to the other reviewer who said: \"You've consistently been the only staff in SF that makes me regret tipping.\"\n\nI've stayed through numerous frustrating incidents including a period in which they were advertising farm fresh eggs but instead secretly substituting factory farmed eggs that were not even organic and a period while they had a front staff member who was so incompetent and stone-headed that he screwed up and/or lost every single order that I ever placed with him, without exception! And, I've stayed even though the quality of the coffee has been very inconsistent, depending on the barista, ranging from undrinkable bitter crap to something that almost approached the quality I'd expect from a proper mission cafe. \n\nBut, now they've replaced that moron with a hostile dick-head who sounds to me like the same person that some other reviewers have been talking about as well, describing as angry and rude. So, a couple weeks ago, I placed an order with him for a cappucino, the same drink by the way that I've been ordering for two years. He took my order then I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. After waiting for about 30 minutes, I went to the counter and asked one of the managers to confirm that my drink was in the queue. The manager just waved me away and didn't even acknowledge me, while the other rude and hostile barista guy simply ignored me, as per usual. I went back to my seat and waited for another 5-10 minutes. Still nothing. So, I went back, and this time I demanded attention. I spoke directly to him in a firm voice despite his insistent efforts to avoid any eye contact and asked him to confirm that he had my order for a cappucino in the queue. He angrily said \"no\" and gave me a look like he wanted to pound my face into the floor just for asking. So, I placed an order 35 minutes before for a cappucino, and he told me it wasn't in the queue, so what am I supposed to do, just walk out, and apologize for bothering him? Fuck! So, I told him I'd like my cappucino. He didn't say a word to me. Didn't look at me. Totally ignored me. Then he angrily threw a cup of cappucino on the counter as though I was doing something horrible for asking to have a cappucino that I had ordered and paid for 35 minutes before and after he had served about 6 people who had ordered AFTER me. Not a word. No apology. No comment. Just throws a cappuccino on the counter and ignores me. \n\nThe final straw happened last week when I ordered a potato/egg dish called a tortilla de patatas. This is my favorite dish and something that I've been ordering whenever it was on the menu since I started going there. The quality has always been very inconsistent, but it has always been within the range of being edible. Until last week. After waiting an exceptionally long time to be served (again, something like 30 minutes and after others who ordered after me were already half way through their dishes), I got this thing that was completely unrecognizable. The eggs had apparently been cooked to oblivion. I'm not exaggerating when I say that one could barely tell it was an egg dish. The eggs had the texture of cheap beef jerky. They were 100% totally dry and so hard that I ended up eating them with my hands like they were crackers. It also was not served with the side dish that it's supposed to come with (a dipping sauce). When the dish was thrown down on my table by the hostile asshole barista, he just walked away. I yelled at him while he had his back to me to get his attention and asked him why the side dish wasn't there. He didn't even turn to face me and then said \"we don't have it\" while he was walking away. No apology. No substitution. No acknowledgement. Why did I eat this, you might be wondering? Because I was fucking starving and had waited so long for any food to be served, and I had to get to work, and I could't bear the thought of facing off with another argument with the asshole barista guy and waiting another 30 minutes for some other dish that will be screwed up in unimaginable ways. So, I sadly sat there and chewed on this monstrosity of an egg plate. How could any chef possibly have produced this? It was not within the range of failure that could be overlooked. \n\nIt's stunning to me why such a loyal customer would be treated with such utter contempt and disrespect.

I've given Stable cafe 3 chances and each time the same thing, a looonnnngggg wait for my coffee.  \n\nI don't need my late to be a freakin' work of art.  I actually watched the barista (o? Is this a gender specific word?) THROW AWAY my late and start over because it was apparently not up to artistic standards.  Clearly he had no idea how near death this carried him as my brain screamed NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\n\nJust now I watched a couple pace up & down the stairs waiting for their drinks, the one appologizing to the other \"I know you've got to get going\" and him saying \"it's ok, but I will have to get going probably as soon as our drinks come\"\n\nThe 2nd time I was here I got a french press thinking it would be 1) faster & 2) come in a nifty french press.  Wrong on both counts.  The coffee is made in a french press and then put into thermos pumps.  And you get a cup out of a thermos pump.  I love the magic of the french press -- watching it, pushing it down, ok I confess - I'm a gaget nerd.  So to me, a coffee made at some point in the last hour or so poured from a thermos and presented to me in a cup is not a french press cup of coffee.  That's just me.\n\nWhile the staff boys are cute & very sweet, they seem to be hesitant & well, slow.  They keep looking at each other to figure out who's doing what & how to do things.  And this place has been open for QUITE some time now.\n\nAnd lastly... it's expensive.  $3.29 for a small late.  I realize this may be a Starbucks price, but my local cafe only charges 2.25 (tax included) for a late.  Not $3.00 + tax.

This was the first place I learned of the heavenly goat cheese and fig combo that now dominates my cheese plates. Their quinoa salad is also fabulous. Loads of freshly grilled veggies with a delicious citrus dressing. The soups are usually spot-on, too.\n\nA great place to come and do some work or just people watch. The music in the background is always pleasant and low key, usually with a decent amount of indie. Last time I was there it was the Antlers.", "author": "Monica C."}

It takes me 15 mins to get to the front of the line, so i ordered a pre-assembled sandwich and ask them to heat it up.  It was 6.50 for a croissant ham and cheese (RIPOFF), but, to add insult to injury, another dollar for a credit charge. \n\nI sat down and waiting another 10 mins for my ham and cheese sandwich to be heated before getting up and asking the manager is i can have it cold or not.

This time, I asked how long they steep it and they said 4 minutes.  I asked if I could have my own french press and they said no, they don't do it that way.  Then they poured my coffee from a big urn.  I don't quite get how they make french press and dispense it from an urn, but - whatever!\n\nUnfortunately before I even tried the coffee, which was served in a glass, I was turned off by how light in color it was.  Like, I do not want to be able to look through a glass cup filled with coffee and be able to see what is on the other side!\n\nI kind of channeled my inner child and found myself saying out loud \"No.  No.  No.\"  Then I gathered my wits and said I knew I wouldn't like it and could they sub in something else.  The barista came over and said \"did you drink any?\" and I said \"no I didn't touch it!\" which the other guy verified, so he poured it back in the urn.\n\nThey made me an Americano instead, and the barista, who was pretty nice, considering, talked to me about the coffee they make there.  He said they use Guatemala coffee which is lighter but has more caffeine.\n\nBecause I thought it was perhaps unfair to judge a coffee on appearances, I asked for a taste of the french press and they gave me some and I really did not like it at all.\n\nUnfortunately, the Americano was just awful also. Weak, tangy, but didn't taste like any coffee I have ever had before.   Truly, I felt like I was in an episode of Punkd and somebody was going to pop out from behind a door and say \"just kidding!  It really is dishwater, we just wanted to see if we could get you to believe us if we talked it up enough.\"\n\nSo, props for the food (I had a croissant which was very good), the ambiance (off the hook), and the barista who was kind enough to tell me about their coffee in a way that made me think yes, they really do care about their coffee.  And I will absolutely concede that maybe it is great coffee, if that's the style you like.  But to me, with my palate that is used to Peet's French roast, it tasted like dishwater.

Well, I hate to disappoint you: you will not find it at Stable Cafe.  The Cafe is so named because it used to be, in fact, one of Mayor Phelan's stables.  Don't worry, though: the horses and the smell that usually accompanies them is long gone.\n\nWhat you have here is a cafe that looks like one of the super modern SOMA lofts with an espresso machine and a kitchen.  The decor here is industrial chic at its finest: exposed brick, stainless steel and wood accents.  The ceilings are very high, which creates an illusion of space and openness.  As soon as you walk in, you are faced with a couple of choices: should you order the food first or get a table first.  The counter is right in front of you, with small, yet sufficient seating areas located to the right of the entrance and upstairs.  The upstairs seating area is a little bit darker and slightly more intimate.  Small square tables could be rearranged for your convenience.  My biggest complaint is the lack of actual chairs.  They do offer stools for your seating pleasure, but a stool doesn't exactly say \"come stay awhile,\" unless you're Norm Peterson of Cheers.\n\nFor lunch I ordered a chicken sandwich, which was $8 and change.  It's a great value for a pretty big sandwich served with some tossed mixed greens on the side.  The salad tasted super fresh.  If that's the taste of organic greens, then I would seriously consider switching.  The chicken sandwich was pretty big, although the chicken breast was a tad on the dry side.  The roasted peppers and spicy mustard helped offset the lack of juiciness, but I still noticed it in every bite.  I did enjoy, however, how white the chicken breast was.  That always signifies \"fresh and natural.\"\n\nThe employees and patrons of Stable Cafe were really, really nice.  Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly.  I know I shouldn't be surprised, but you know how it is with trendy places that try too hard.  I definitely did not feel that way at Stable Cafe.\n\nIf you are looking for a light and inexpensive lunch option in the Mission, give Stable Cafe a try.", "author": "Yan G."}

I simply could not wake up, and it mattered none at all what time I went to bed.  Ten hours or 3 hours of sleep - I'd still be hard to wake up.\n\nSo at this precious age, she decided one morning that she would bring me coffee to force me to take a sip in hopes of making HER life easier.   Back then - her coffee was as sweet as caramel -  and on this momentous day started an addiction that has grown to DEFINE me to this date (and probably stunted my growth too - I might have been way taller than 5'7\" if not for this detrimental act by my mother).  \n\nGranted, back then it was Yuban - and that was good enough.  Now, I'm ready to go to Ethiopia to pick and roast my own beans to make myself a real cup of coffee.  \n\nSome people do heroine, others smoke pot - -  I drink coffee.\n\nMy love for coffee is second to none, it knows no boundaries, and it must be had first thing in the morning.\n\nHere's my review on Starbucks, in general:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-coffee-company-seattle-21#hrid:KvXoHdOKb7h6porFguGZuw\n\nA love affair.\nCoffee is my second religion, right after Christianity.\n\nWell, on a nice afternoon in San Francisco, after lunch - Jon suggested a new coffee place he was digging.

Serving french press coffee is delightful.\n\nWhat's not cool about this place is - - - no outdoor seating (coffee is so much better in open air), uncomfortable seating (all wooden chairs or stools), and limited space resulting in no privacy.  I am all about drinking my coffee and having my mind relaxed, and my butt comfortable.  My butt was not comfortable here.\n\nWithout a patio, I can't rate this place as 5-stars, but it serves up good coffee and service is very friendly.

We were also informed that they do not have decaf coffee (I know, why decaf?; but that is what all 3 of us drink).  Then we were informed that they were out of hot chocolate.  3 strikes!!\nI really think cafes that serve breakfast should do so later than 11am, especially on a holiday.\nAnd the staff were quite spacey and somewhat slow in providing the few things we could/did order.\nIt is a shame.  Stable is a beautiful place, great design, interestingly laid out, an outside area, and it is not being run well.  I will not return.", "author": "Ruth N."}

I was a loyal customer, grinning and bearing the fact that even getting a cup of coffee to go is a 10-minute investment. \n\nBut then you had to go and hire that really surly counter guy -- he's probably 35, short, Latino and RUDE. He is so unpleasant that I don't want to come back.\n\nHow is it that you can put so much care into your design and food and let it be ruined by such terrible, and sometimes downright hostile, service?\n\nA couple of tips:\n\n1. Acknowledge the customers presence, even if you are busy doing something else.\n\n2. Do not let customer stand there waiting for you to at least acknowledge her while you eat/gossip.\n\n3. Do not look through customer (who has by now been waiting without being acknowledged for minutes) to the person behind her and ask them what they want because they're your friend.", "author": "ceecee m."}

I've been walking past this place for over a year, when I thought it was a private home being remodelled by historian owners who just really wanted you to know it had once been a \"STABLE.\" But lucky for me it wasn't. What a lovely space, all simplicity and openness, with even lovelier food inside. For lunch I had the veggie sandwich on wheat.  A delicately dressed salad of fresh greens and shaved carrots accompanied my stuffed-to-the-gills sandwich, packed with grilled squash, zucchini, tomato, grainy mustard, at least 12 pounds of goat cheese (there was a LOT of goat cheese), and the best pesto I have ever had (since I declared over 15 years ago that Sam's Club sold the best pesto I had ever had). \n\nAfter finishing my sandwich, I decided to take a treat to go. While I'm sure the lavender salted shortbread is very tasty and grownup, what could I do when faced with a peppermint chocolate cookie? Well aware that one bad cookie could diminish the enlightening lunch I just had, I took the risk anyways and was rewarded with what I can only describe as a thin mint. If that thin mint had been kidnapped by the witch from Hansel and Gretel, then held captive and fattened up on Godiva for a month.

The menu looked really tantalizing and couldn't decide what to order to I asked the cashier for a rec from the list of sandwiches.  It sounded like a pretty ringing endorsement of the roast beef and brie, so I went for it.

No condiments and no veggies, not ever the roasted peppers that are supposed to be included...and that for over $8. I know the prices have gotten a bit crazy in the Mission over the last couple of years, but at least you usually get a bit of quality to justify the increase.

The only reason I did not provide a 5 star rating is the wait, the first time it was a 45 minute wait for my food, the second was about 20. \n\nMy first visit I ordered a bowl of potato soup, and a 3 cheese sandwich. The sandwich had Brie, Swiss( I'm pretty sure it was swiss but this cheese could have been something else), and Provolone. My sandwich was perfectly melty and had a nice crisp bread, the cheeses inside were a heavenly combination. The soup wasn't chunky like a potato soup, which i wasn't expecting, it was more a consistent creamy texture with a hint of curry flavoring, again very fresh tasting. The soup also came with very crunchy little crouton bread pieces which were very flavorful.\n\nThe second visit, I ordered a lavender short bread cookie ( based on another yelpers review) the daily quiche, potato soup, and strawberry lemonade.  The cookie is a very unique flavor you really taste the lavender, and its very buttery and smooth. The quiche has olives, potatoes, cheddar, onions and maybe some other things i'm not sure about, but it is incredible! This time the potato soup is the same kind of potato curry combination as the first, with a a lot more spice but not hot, and leeks added. Both versions are good. Now the strawberry lemonade is my favorite part, it is without a doubt the best, freshest tasting strawberry lemonade I have ever consumed. My only complaint about it, is that it was packed with ice so I had way less lemonade to enjoy, other wise I was very happy with my visit and food selections. \nI plan to return to stable cafe often. Also the price for each lunch was about 14 dollars and my first lunch did include a drink as well. \n\nFor those who haven't been here the place itself is very cool, the inside has a little loft area upstairs with additional seating, some tables down stairs, and a nice large outdoor patio space.  If you dine in they have a table near the front with self serve water and glasses.

The bread was warm and crunchy and the cheese was melted over the turkey and was a bit crispy on the outside (just the way I like it). My friend got the Quinoa Salad and soup of the day.

I've now been 3 times in as many days. Despite the fact that my daily commute takes me past several coffee/pastry gems in the Mission, Stable is my new favorite.\n\nWhoever designed and decorated this space is a genius. From the moment I walked in the door and saw three Blair Bradshaw paintings hanging up in the loft, I was in love. Great coffee, yummy pastries, tasty fresh fruit, wonderful ingredients. Every little detail puts a smile on my grumpy morning face. There's nothing not to love about this place. \n\nExcept the yogurt. The yogurt I had there yesterday turned my smile upside down. Granola & fruit on top were tasty. Bad yogurt is a minor flaw. So I'm just going to cross my fingers and hope they jump on the Straus yogurt train in the near future.

I timed my last visit there, just to be especially dickish, i timed the whole transaction. I wondered if it was me just feeling that I wasn't cool enough and was uncomfortable or if it actually did take an eternity for the four guys behind the counter to figure out how to toast a pastry and put it on a plate along with a cup of coffee. Well after what seemed like 15 minutes I looked at the timer clock on my I phone (see I'm hip I'm cool I have the I phone, yes its only an Iphone 4)  and behold we were rolling up on 12 minutes. Considering this information I figured out that I was actually cool, it wasn't me feeling uncomfortable, it actually was taking an eternity to get a cup of coffee. DONT MESS WITH MY COFFEE, GIVE ME COFFEE, just pour that black magic into a cup and hand it over to me. All the boys behind the counter sure are pretty, its like Zoolander opened a cafe with a bunch of condescending coffee jockeys. I also was concerened about the extremely thin v necks that the majority of the staff seems to sport and the inevitability of a short and curly man fluff topping off my coffee. The staff here needs a serious hipster-ectomy and some god damned courtesy.  I take heart that I do not have to visit this establishment since there are 2 wonderfully staffed shops within 2 blocks of this place. Stable does have a pleasant courtyard and decent entrees, but all in all I felt like I stepped in horse crap when I left 20 minutes later with coffee made by someone who found a way to infuse contempt, and general apathy into a cup.\n    Get on your horse and stable it somewhere else.", "author": "Atom H."}

It's not a very far walk from our work, and we have both seen this place. At one time I even thought it was some new fandangled design company. It's definitely cool looking from the outside.\n\nWe go in and it's a lot smaller on the inside than it appears to be on the outside. There is a tiny area up front with a couple tables and then the upstairs with a row of tables. They sure do have that stable feeling down.\n\nWhen we got there, the menu written on brown construction paper, listed several items, one of them was the \"meat sandwich.\" Meat sounded good at that moment, and there was some allure in ordering something that was so ambiguously titled. I ordered it with \"extra meat\" and \"cheese.\" The guy at the counter was nice enough to tell me what \"meats\" I could select from. I ordered roast beef.\n\nFor a brief moment after we ordered he had trouble with the cash register, I felt bad for him because obviously the machine was not cooperating. Two girls walked in but left I guess from the wait due to the malfunctioning register.\n\nBut eventually he got things under control. And I paid for my meal and waited upstairs with my friend.\n\nThe sandwich itself wasn't bad, roast beef with brie, in fact it was really good but the sandwich was on the small side. For the price I expected something large, something that could at least completely satisfy my hunger.\n\nIncluded were leafy greens topped off with a single cherry tomato which was thoughtful but there could have been more thought put into it. Maybe a couple onions, i don't know, it just seemed so \"plain.\"\n\nOverall not bad, they seem like they're still getting their footing, the sandwich wasn't bad.

Combined with my cappuccino, I was a happy camper. \nService was on the slow side, and if you are trying to eat and get back to the office in an hour, this is not the place to go. \nThe space is beautiful and open, and if I wanted to work on my computer or read a good book for a couple of hours, I'd probly come here and enjoy another cappuccino and shortbread.", "author": "Bianca L."}

Found it after ODC class nearby and want to go every time I am nearby. Even went three time in one day! Great place to pass some time talking, eating and sipping coffee inside or in the landscaped, shady side alley that seems a bit out of context for the urban hardscape surroundings.  It is oddly tranquil. No problem with service - in fact, the folks have always been super friendly and, importantly, they practice the rare art of decorating the foam on their cappuccinos with intricate designs!  The menu is not too large, but really good. The pies sold by Three Babes are excellent, if a bit pricey. Finally, the side yard alley ends in the entry court for Saison, possibly the most expensive --yet rustic looking -- restaurant in SF. Haven't eaten there and probably never will be able to!!  Ends the alley in a beautiful light filled room that looks like a plant nursery.", "author": "Joanna C."}

I only popped in here for a cup of coffee but the joe was good and the vibe was chill. A bit off the beaten path and not much foot traffic on that block but they should fare just fine as the area becomes more gentrified. If I didn't have a job and could bum around in cafes all day with my macbook, I would definitely work this into the rotation with Coffee Bar and L's.", "author": "Susan L."}

Trying to be old world, but not even coming close to the concept.  The counter man was evasive and then charged my friends for 3 drinks when they only ordered two. The food tastes boring and made somewhere else.  There is no creativity or passion here.  The coffee is terrible and when I asked for a decaf anything I was told \"That's not our thing.\"  Okay.  Really. What is your thing?  There is nothing there worth seeing, tasting or soaking in.  Oh and bonus.  The place leaks..not just here and there, but all over you continually as your trying to escape the relentless rain outside and it's kinda awful.  Oh and there are no lights in the bathroom.  Just one dim candle.  Last time I checked, people like to be able to aim in the toilet, wash their hands and leave the place somewhat respectable.  I could not even see my hands.  It smelled like a stable if that is what they are going for in there, then they have succeeded.  Please don't be mistaken...This is not a coffee bar or restaurant.", "author": "Amy H."}

High, wooden-beam ceilings, huge street front windows, outdoor seating patio, upstairs seating.\n\nGenerous 'cup' of soup for about $4- it was a small bowl, with two lovely crostini. Beautiful dishes, nicely presented. Mushroom and potato soup, freshly made.\n\nThe counterperson gave me attitude when I asked for water and shrugged toward a pitcher on the sideboard. French much? Did I need your attitude?\n\nMinuses- uncomfortable wooden seats. Carrying your own soup up a flight of stairs when you're pregnant. Hot as hell that Fri afternoon in the Mission- it was almost hotter inside than outside when I left, despite the doors being open.\n\nDon't park on the north side of 18th St. after 4pm on a weekday.

The place looks lovely, but if you want the service befitting a paying customer, the joke's on you. My husband and I walked in on a Sunday late morning, happy to find a nice place in an area lacking in cafes, while we waited for our daughter at ODC Dance.\nAfter standing there waiting while the two NOT busy waitpeople finished their chat, we ordered two decafe French presses, perhaps to order more. We were informed quite rudely that they had no decafe, and then the young woman proceeded to add a snarky remark that they believe in caffeine. Fine, no decafe, but why the attitude? \nSuffice to say, we won't be back. ODC will be opening a cafe at their new digs at Shotwell and 17 and they will get my business.\nOn Monday through Friday  (closed weekends) try Kafe 99 sq ft. (18th and Treat). I got there one evening at 5 pm as they were closing. They were lovely and graciously made me a decafe Americano, with a smile. No place to sit, but great coffee.

But aside from that ongoing meaningless diversion, i'll just conclude it's a really nice place to sit and get food and coffee or tea.  Plus, they have wifi and it's not just a laptop kinda coffee place, so it's a nice blend of laptops and people eating/talking, AND and they rent out kitchen space and a gallery party space (with or without the kitchen space i think) and with attached garden party space.  Pretty nice.  Cool place to check out now and then, a nice place to take people to lunch to i'd say.", "author": "Today Y."}
