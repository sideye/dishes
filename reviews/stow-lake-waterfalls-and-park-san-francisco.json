Who doesn't love a story about everlasting love, lakes & green hills, with medieval swords carried by immortals? Hmm, I admit I might be getting carried away...\n\nYet there's a lake in the middle of San Francisco that brings the Highlander out of me! Stow Lake was made during the Victorian era, circa 1893. It's a storybook type of lake, like something from \"The Notebook\" or \"Highlander\". It's filled with ducks & turtles and the typical flora & fauna found around such lakes. The seasons will determine the colours.\n\nThere's a boathouse (daily 11am - 5pm) where you can rent rowboats ($20hr+) or paddle-boats ($25hr+). Electric boats for lots more, but why? You can also purchase duck food here, or food for humans too, like hotdogs, burgers, nachos, refreshments, etc. You really can't miss the boathouse just follow the seagull... poop!\n\nThe walk around the lake and to the Victorian era  waterfall is charming in itself. You really don't need a boat to enjoy the lake. Just note that the complete stroll takes nearly two hours, but great spots to picnic or find the pagoda area to dream. \n\nLastly, for the historians & story tellers there's a ghost story about this lake, which has circulated for over a century, back to the days of Queen Victoria, called \"The White Lady of Stow Lake.\" Go read it! \n\nThis ghost story comes directly from the official Golden Gate Park website, and fortunately she only appears at night. And no, I'm not interested in meeting her anytime soon... so daytime it is with the ducks & floppy hats. Hey, I might even wield my Highlander sword, y'know just in case! \n\n\"It was well for him, with his chivalry and mysticism, to make the grand renunciation. But it takes two to make love, or to make a quarrel...\"", "author": "Eric R."}

Certain areas of the lake are at a standstill. It's also murky and green and depending on the wind, has the foul stench of hundreds of waterfowl. That said though, it still has this weird charm to it. Many animals call Stow Lake home from common waterfowl all the way to rarer sights like eagles and owls. There are also a variety of activities to do at/around Stow Lake. You can rent boats, bikes, or segways to explore all that this lake and Golden Gate Park has to offer. Or you can hike. Strawberry Hill is fun to explore and culminates with an electrically operated waterfall that is still a sight to behold. If that's not for you, the edge of the lake is also paved making hiking or even jogging a very doable activity. Or you can simply picnic.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

There's a waterfall, turtles, lots of birds and pretty trees along this lake. Highly recommended!! You can also eat and drink on the boats if your heart desires. \n\nThere's also a cute cafe here that sells food and drinks. They have the typical American food (burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, fries, soda, tea, coffee, etc). We ate lunch here and it was very reasonably priced -- two chicken sandwiches that came with fries and an iced tea was about $20. Food was decent too. I'd eat here again in the future. \n\nWhile at this park, you're also about a 5-10 minute walk to the Tea Garden, Botanical Garden and Science Center.

When you get into the island there are few ways you can go. You can either climb uphill to the top of strawberry hill which has picnic benches and you have views of the city and the ocean. If you stay on the bottom, it is a circle around the interior of the island. If you enter through the island through the north entrance and take a left you will come across the waterfall. Sometimes it is on but sometimes it is not. Really depends on the day and time? After a few feet later you will come across a beautiful Chinese inspired gazebo structure where you can sit around and look at the lake. A minute or two after you will reach a stone bridge that's reminisce of England. This place does get foggy but it makes for great pictures! Great place to spend a day.

I remember I used to be one of those jumpy toddlers who had to do all the pedaling.\n\nIt's a control thing, something I never got over except I don't do it with my feet anymore. I always thought this place was more quaint than gorgeous with a tinge of amusement park about it with the electrically pumped Huntington Falls on the preciously named Strawberry Island, the anomalous Chinese Pavilion along the fringe of the island trail, and the rocky Rustic Bridge connecting the island to the perimeter. There are ducks, gulls and turtles everywhere on the lake, so kids will obviously be enchanted by all the wildlife. Adults, too, some of whom look like they're looking for dinner.\n\nEven though the familiar pink candy popcorn is still sold here (a nostalgic treat for me), eating here certainly moved up a notch with the introduction of food from La Cocina, American Box and Let's Be Frank, all of which I've tried at other locations but not here. It's great to see that nothing is more than $7. The hourly boat rental rates are not bad either - row boats at $14, pedal boats at $19, and electric boats at $29 (though I've rarely seen anybody on an electric boat here).

There was a hilly island in the middle of the lake, that was connected to the mainland on one side. On the island, my mother and I wandered through the treed walking paths and discovered a beautiful waterfall called Huntington Falls. Visiting Stow Lake was a relaxing and peaceful way to spend a portion of our afternoon. \n\nThere were paddle boats available to rent that people could use to paddle around the lake, however we did not do this. \n\nStow Lake was beautiful and natural, and it was hard to imagine that this was situated in the middle of the city! It was a great place to go for a relaxing and quiet walk in nature.", "author": "Brittany T."}

They have row boats, which looks like it could be a bit of work and maybe potentially tiring if not frustrating.   They also have electric boats, which are easy, but seem to maybe be too easy, so less of a challenge.\n\nIt's a nice place to walk around, it goes a full circle and I think it feels like about a 1 mile loop around, so you can walk, jog or run around it.\n\nAs kids, we used to come here and bring bread to feed the ducks (now there's a lot more pigeons and sea gulls 'tho which are a tad less cute and way more aggressive)\n\nAs teens, we'd walk around and pick the berries and eat them (not sure if that's safe anymore).  You can also sometimes see guppies in the water too feeding around the perimeter of the lake.\n\nParking is very easy here, or at least when I came here it was.\n\nOh, here's a famous urban legend about Stow Lake and \"The Lady of the Lake\" too, which I found on the internet...\n\nThe famous ghost story and legend of Stow Lake has been circulating for nearly 100 years, and it goes something like this: Once upon a time at Stow Lake, in Golden Gate Park, there was a lady who was walking her baby in a stroller. After a while, this lady got tired and rested on the bench next to the lake, with the stroller right next to her. While she was sitting, another lady came to sit down next to her and they started talking. While they were conversing, the stroller rolled away unnoticed. The stroller with the baby fell in the lake. After the two women finished talking, the lady noticed her baby was gone and panicked right away. She then walked around Stow Lake and asked people, \"Have you seen my baby?\" She spent all day and all night asking everyone. When the night was over, the last place she checked was the lake. She went into the lake looking for her baby and ever since, she hasn't been seen again.\n\nIt is rumored that if someone goes to Stow Lake at night, weird occurrences take place. Stories have been told that the lady comes up from the lake, or the statue in her honor comes to life, or she will come up to you and ask, \"Have you seen my baby?\" Other reports say if you drive there with your friends in a group of cars, all the cars will stall at the same time. Another rumor is said that, if someone says \"White lady, white lady, I have your baby\" three times, the lady will appear. She'll ask you, \"Have you seen my baby?\" If you say yes, she'll haunt you and if you say no, she'll kill you.\n\nSo if you decide to walk around Stow Lake some night, beware of the White Lady. And if you walk through the street at night this All Hallows Eve and feel your hair stand on end, you might just be in the presence of one of the other ghosts of San Francisco.", "author": "Rick S."}

Don't get me wrong, the pedal boating was fun. We spent the full hour touring the lake and observing the ducks swimming and wagging their tails. The scenery was beautiful, hands down. \n\nNow comes the negative part. When we were finished with the boat ride, we went to get our $5 deposit so my gf waited in line to get assisted. A young blonde refused to help her and instead told her to wait in another line. That same young blonde turned around and decided to help a man who just simply stood there when his purpose WAS the same purpose as my gf's!!!! I mean, I don't understand what her intention was, maybe she felt like badgering my gf, but if my gf's dad received service from the exact same blonde, you start wondering whether this blonde just hates Asian females. \n\nMy gf called her out on her offense and I know she was embarrassed. I swear, such people should not be kept on payroll.

I didn't get very far that day, but 20 years later I still frequent this park on a regular basis. \n\nStowe lake used to be on the way between my home and my school so I would often walk there and back and cut through stowe lake as a short cut. At one point I came here so often I became familiar with the ducks' lifecycle...knowing when to expect ducklings, when mating season was, and when they were starting to get old. I've watched generations of ducks grow from fluffy peeping ducklings to beautiful, playful adult ducks. I like to bring some frozen peas or cracked corn to feed them \n\nPLEASE PLEASE don't feed the ducks bread! It's junk food and makes them fat and poop everywhere. It also has no nutritional value to them. So please, bring some peas or something healthy for them :)\n\nI love walking to the top of Strawberry Hill.

Every time I go in and get lost, I find something new, wonderful, and strange.  Strange only in that I wonder how everything fits in there, each aspect is veritably sandwiched right alongside its neighbor but yet remains its own distinct individual oasis.  It's as if each occupies its own unlikely dimension and I'm being transported light years away from my home instead of a number of city blocks I can count on one hand.  Stow Lake epitomizes this idea, for me.\n\nWhen I'm there, I'm both home and not home at all.  I'm back East in the woods, except the trees are taller and grander and the wildlife is more abundant and more varied...but the snack shack still looks like the ones I remembered, and the pond still smells like pond, and the sun-bleached paddleboats are familiar, too.\n\nBut I really never get tired of going to Stow Lake.  If I want some exercise, I hike around the lake itself and up to the top of the waterfalls.  If I want a picnic, there are benches to accommodate.  If I want to take in nature, there are very gregarious Mallards, Muscovy ducks, coots, geese, gulls, and (to a lesser extent) turtles who are really rather happy to make my acquaintance.  If, instead, I want to people-watch, I can see old couples, young children, dogs, dog owners, lovers, and tourists all living their lives parallel to mine.  I can feel tiny and insignificant in a way that rarely feels so comforting.  And, if I want to get my own dog some exercise, I can watch him run away from Muscovy ducks.\n\nStow Lake is kind of like the best parts of me, humanity, and the earth all rolled up into a relatively bite-sized chunk of land in the middle of an enormous green park in the middle of an entrancing and engaging city.

If you want to take photos, this place is amazing.  \n\nPlenty to look at, like geese, squirrels, bluejays, people walking their puppies, on the day I went here there was even a wedding!\n\nParking is easy, it's all free, you could bring lunch! Makes for a good day.", "author": "Alyssa G."}

Strawberry hill is right across the stone bridge and theirs always plenty of people so feeling safe isn't a problem. Only downside is people are supposed to keep their dogs on leashes but fail to do so and its quite annoying.", "author": "Tj J."}

I'm sure everyone knows the story, but I'll just briefly tell the story. There's a few variations, but here's one of them. \n\nSo legend has it that a young lady in the victorian era was boating with her baby and the baby accidentally fell out and she jumped in to save it. Both the lady and the baby drowned. Now at night, if you walk around Stow Lake or Strawberry Hill, you can see a figure in a white victorian dress looking for her baby. \n\nI've tried to do it one time with my friends, but we wussed out once we reached the bridge. I think we were more scared of the homeless than the ghost. \n\nDuring the day though, this is just a beauty. A small lake with a fantastic view of SF on Strawberry Hill. There's also pedal boats you can rent to go around the lake, which is a nice little activity. Just a wonderful place overall.", "author": "robin w."}

Once we got here though, the sheer beauty of Stow Lake made us forget all that. We hiked up Strawberry Hill stopping every now and then to admire the view and take some pictures. You can get a pretty good workout by just hiking up the hill, then renting a paddle boat and doing a few laps around the lake. Paddle boats are a bit pricey though, but lots of fun!!", "author": "Mitch T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-17", "description": "After seeing all the great reviews here on yelp, I was really excited to visit Stow Lake. However, the wait on a Saturday was pretty long, and I had to wait nearly an hour! The wait wasn't bad because it gave me time to explore the park, which was fairly quiet and nice. However, I was somewhat underwhelmed for some reason, perhaps because I was able to paddle through the lake in half an hour. Stow Lake was nice, and I don't regret coming here, but paddle boating wasn't cheap at $19 for an hour, and I'm not sure I would come again. It just wasn't THAT amazing of an experience for me.", "author": "J Y."}

It sounds like we missed the best part of the lake!\n\nBeing in such a busy city, this place is actually quite peaceful if you want to get away for a short time. \n\nWe came here when the sun was about to set, so we only had about an hours worth of daylight, but luckily it seemed like we beat out what would have been a large crowd of weekend goers. We walked the whole circumference of lake, taking a few breaks for pictures. The water is very green and filled with lots of algae and ducks. The waterfall was beautiful from a distance.\n\nWe even saw two little birds punking a squirrel. That was hilarious, adding our own commentary! I guess the squirrel invaded their territory!\n\nNext time we will explore the rest of this serene park!", "author": "JQ V."}

Pigeon\n\nI was hope'n to all hell that none of the animals magically started to talking to me. At one point a squirrel began to follow us, and I swore that if that little rat cousin bastard opened his little mouth and says \"Hey Danny, I'm Dale, your spirit animal,\" I was going to jump in to the 1000ft deep lake and drown my self like the little kids that the statue at the entrance shows. \n\nLuckily he scampered off into the sunset... well bushes, but the first way makes him sound like a cowboy. \n\nThe lake is green and smelly, the walk around it to the top of strawberry hill in the middle of the lake is quite nice, and there is even a reservoir at the top that makes me think that is where they keep the ghost bodies of the kids and mom from the statue... because it is all creepy fenced off, and makes gurggly sounds, like the sounds of underwater souls left to remain in a constant state of traumatic limbo...

I have lived in the Bay Area most of my life and been to Golden Gate Park many times, but for some reason never discovered Stowe Lake until last weekend.  The weather was perfect so that didn't hurt.  Rented a boat and paddled around the lake which took about 45 minutes or so with a few stops to look at birds and turtles.  Such a peaceful and pretty area.  Water is a little green and needs some tlc which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  Great place for a date or to bring your kids.", "author": "Nancy B."}

As you are climbing, every few feet is a rest area or a bridge where you can see the water cascading down - tis a beautiful sight.  \nWe finally reached the top and played with the squirrels - had a snack and started back down,  Then we walked around the lake, stopped at the Pagoda (where many years ago, my best friend had her wedding).\n\nNote:  for those romantic at heart, a sunset waterfall hike/walk with a picnic at the Pagoda will win someone some brownie points.", "author": "Kea C."}

I absolutely love this place, it seems perfect for a Saturday afternoon run with a buddy. The only downfall to this place is the amount of people/tourists that flock to the lake. It's made worse by the people who feed the PIGEONS!!! I loved walking around, watching the turtles struggle to find a spot on the logs, only to spend their day soaking up the sun - so funny! There's a waterfall at one end with a bridge at the top where you can overlook the lake. Nearby is a Chinese gazebo, donated by the city of Taipei.\n\nWe saw plenty of ducks, lots of turtles, random fish and of course, squirrels! You also have the option to rent row boats or pedal boats to ride through the lake. The walk around the lake was pretty long and quiet, compared to the bustling streets of San Francisco.

All that real estate, all that investment, and no thought of profit! I'd love to think the people with the power and the money would do this if they had the chance, but .......... So let's hear it for the guys back then. And maybe the mayor should think about that next time he's thinking about cutting the budget. Be nice if that water weren't so murky! Be nice if they let that waterfall flow more often. It was built to work that way, right? But it's a real chill out zone, and you can see it doing people good. They stay cool even if the guy in the other boat bangs into yours because he, like, hasn't worked out what to do with the oars. You put them in the water and pull, man.
