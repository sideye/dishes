You know, Pizza Hut, Little Caesar's, Round Table. All that good stuff. Hey, it may not be the best, but at least it's always consistent.\n\nThis place on the other hand, you never know what you're going to get. Sometimes you'll get a super friendly dude serving up a fresh slice, other times you'll wonder why you came here in the first place.\n\nWith the new owners they're trying to implement some innovations like pizza sitting on the front counter. Speeds things up a bit if you want a quick slice, but you can also order a custom slice if you want a fresh one.\n\nThere are also wings and salads sold here. But my favorite thing is the Sicilian style pizza. However that's a bit inconsistent too. Sometimes it's an inch high sometimes maybe triple that (???).\n\nThe prices are a bit on the high side approaching about $30 for a whole pizza. Definitely not a 5-5-5 kind of place, but there really aren't too many other pizza options in the immediate area. \n\nOverall if you want pizza it's either this Delarosa....and they know it! Alas my weakness is pizza so I'll be back again and again.\n\nProtip: Bring cash. Otherwise you'll pay a ~4% additional charge", "author": "Joel L."}

I hate to do this but, the new ownership has really ruined this place by skimping on quality ingredients and Avellino has officially lost its \"soul\". The new owners are looking at the bottom line more than putting out a good NY slice and it makes me sadder than ever. \n\nFor the better part of a decade I enjoyed the delicious nyc styled pizza but, those days are gone. The slice and pizza you find today is uninspired, clunky and cheese heavy.

The pickled onions and roasted tomatoes paired well with the balsamic vinegarette they had, which was extra tangy and super flavorful. I used the whole container, but would probably opt for just half next time!\n\nSadly, the pizza disappointed. Ultimately, you can't go too wrong with pizza, they give you good portion size for the price. A medium here is like a large elsewhere. Plus, service is quick because the pizza is thin-crusted. \n\nHowever, the chicken on the pizza was dry and flavorless, sauce unseasoned, and crust unremarkable. Our other pizza (forgot its name, but it had arugula and sausage) was way too greasy. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat and are craving pizza you can come here--but don't expect it to blow you away.", "author": "Rachel L."}

We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*The Lombard Special: Pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, no black olives, sub Jalapenos ($22 for Medium 15\")\n*Blistered Shishito Peppers: Tossed in olive oil and sea salt over lemon aioli ($6)\n*Meatballs: Pork and beef meatballs, marinara, parmesan, crostini ($7)\n\nI like thin crust pizza, so this was more my style. The pizza was pretty big circumference wise for a medium. Managed to feed both of us for this one meal. (I had two slices and the roomie had the rest.) The crust was soft, but also had a nice chew. A good amount of cheese and toppings as well. I adore shishito peppers, so I enjoyed these. Could have used a little more seasoning, but the lemon aioli helped. The portion was pretty hefty as this was the one dish we couldn't finish. I thought the meatballs were pretty standard. Though one wasn't quite a whole meatball. It almost looked like someone had a bite taken out of it? I know that wasn't the case, but I did notice one was smaller than the rest. I do love my meat and sauce, so this fulfilled that craving.\n\nEven though the roommate just prefers to order from a particular chain pizza restaurant, I like trying new spots.

The cost of this came to $19. At first I was shocked but then realized NY slice means huge. When the pizza came I was kind of disappointed.

Probably better than most of the Tony Slice House locations. \n\nThere are many decent Italian style wood fired pizza places around town.

I don't know Chicago-style well enough, but there seem to be enough of those as well. \n\nThe pizzas are good here; either by the pie or by the slice. Go for something simple with fewer ingredients. They also have some good appetizers that go well with beer; try the padron peppers. They have now also added some outdoor tables in the parking lot area -- great for when the weather is cooperating and it's not too cold and windy. \n\nNext time you are tempted to order a chain pizza, or visit a NY themed place, go here instead.", "author": "Jice E."}

Most of us ordered 2 slices each, but they were huge NY-style slices and some of us could have probably split a second slice between us.\n\nThey have a great variety of toppings and that certainly made it tought for me to decide on what I wanted for my slices. I opted for Pepperoni, garlic and black olives and an Arugula and Italian sausage. I had wanted bacon, but they happened to be out, so I opted for sausage. Both were great - I would classify the crust as a bit doughy, but delicious. There was a good amount of sauce and cheese without being greasy.

We first stumble upon this place on an accident looking for another restaurant that had already closed down (we didn't know), we were so hungry and tired after walking uphills and downhills exploring  San Francisco and admiring the beauty of Palace of Fine Arts.  There are other mom and pop stores nearby but I could not lift a foot anymore, Pizzeria Avellino conveniently sits in the corner of Lombard and Lyon Street, and is close to bus stops.  I'm glad we tried this place!  Its been my fave pizza place here in SF so far, and been coming here whenever I visit the city.   It's a great place for a taste of NY pizza, it's the closest to it that I have tried.  \n\nI lalalalalalove it!", "author": "Freida G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-29", "description": "Took my nephew there yesterday, a Saturday afternoon. We were celebrating his 9th birthday. I ordered a medium thin crust with full pineapple, half bacon (for my nephew), and half jalape\u00f1o (I'm a vegetarian). We sat outside, the sun was shining on us in just right way, and 15 or so minutes later our pizza arrives! It's full pineapple, half bacon, and half pepperoni. When it's dropped off, I repeat my order and add in that I haven't had meat in years. The incorrect half was taken back inside, the pepperoni slices removed, and cold jalape\u00f1os are placed on top. I asked if they removed the pepperoni and just put jalape\u00f1os on, because bits of cheese were missing as well, and it had looked \"picked on\". My assumption was confirmed, and I had to explain that just because the meat was removed doesn't make this half a vegetarian half. The grease and remnants of the pepperoni were still present. I walked inside, leaving my nephew to enjoy his half, which he devoured! I asked for a half refund, although I was extremely hungry, at this point I would have picked up a salad or a smoothie from some other location. One of the chefs suggested that instead of a refund they would put pineapple and jalape\u00f1os on top of pre-made cheese slices. I was quite hungry so I agreed. Back outside I went to be with my nephew, and about 3-5 minutes later my pizza arrives. It was no where near as appealing as my nephews', for on his everything was baked together, all golden brown, but mine was simply placed on top. So when I went to take a bite, most of the pineapple and jalape\u00f1os fell off, and the toppings were cold... We we not checked on after that, and I couldn't help but to be disappointed. But I ate a slice of this cold pizza just to have something in my stomach. I went inside to get a to go box for my nephew and I and let Jacob, at the front counter, know that half of our experience had been delightful and the other half quite disappointing. He apologized and brought me a glass of red wine. That was appreciated. I still recommend this pizza place, just have them repeat back your order before paying $25+ for a pizza.", "author": "Miia W."}

Wasn't searching for pizza but just a quick bite to eat.  PA is a no frills, straight down to business NY style pizzeria.  It's a small space with table seating for about 20 and bar seating against the wall for about another 6 people.  There are some picnic tables outside as well.  The menu is simple - pizza by the pie or by the slice and a few salad and pasta choices.  \n\nI've always been a fan of thin crust and NY pizza, so I didn't think we could go wrong here.  Other half and I walked in for a late lunch.  There was only another family of 8 dining in there.  Got to the counter and ordered a slice each.  The slices start at $3.70 for cheese only and each topping is $0.50.  I went with one of my favorites - mushroom.  Other half got bacon and pepperoni.  Serve yourself water dispenser and pick up your own utensils were by the chalk board menu wall.  \n\nWithin minutes, our slices were brought out piping hot to our table.  The slices were huge and more than enough to satisfy our appetites.  I liked that the mushrooms were thickly sliced.  The pizza was simple yet just what the doctor ordered.  Nice crunchy thin crust with basic marinara and cheese.  Happy to find this place and would stop by again if I was in the neighborhood.  Service was fine.

From the first to the last bite I felt like I was back home.

I grew up in NY/NJ for 20 years and Avellino's is the closest I've found to traditional NY style pizza.  Nice, chewy crust, and the optimal ratio of crust-sauce-cheese.  This is the nostalgic slice for you if you're longing for NY style. My go-to is the large cheese pie, but their meatball sub and chopped salad are great too.  Online ordering for pickup and delivery is convenient, and there's a small seating area inside.

My friend really loved hers even though her palette was confused by the combination at first. Mine was equally and confusingly good as well. Thin, crunchy crust. Flavorful sauce. The pepperonis were small, but they were delicious (flavor and texture was on point; crisped up on the edges) and the ratio was perfect. Cheese was melty, gooey, and stretchy.\n\nThe cashiers were friendly! Space was limited though, but it wasn't busy that Saturday morning. The benches were littered with bits and pieces of food, so it was a little unnerving to sit there; I also noticed the covers on the tables had leftover sauce on them because it ended up on my white sleeves.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-16", "description": "This little corner spot offers pizza by the slice which is so hard to find in SF! The pizza starts out as a basic thin crust cheese (you can also choose the deep dish sicilian variety) and then you specify any number of toppings (selection includes pepperoni, fresh tomatoes, arugula, mushrooms.). The slice is topped with your choice of toppings and then quick-fired in the oven so that it's piping hot. It's called out or brought to you. Each slice is large (just under/about the size of a paper plate) and will ring in at about $3.50 + pay per topping.\n\nIt's not quite like NY dollar pizza (the cheap slices off the street), which have a flexible crust that you can fold over -- this one has a very crisp bottom. Each slice is also fired to order until bubbling hot, unlike in NY where the pizzas are sitting out all day and reheated for a quick minute. Lastly the edge crust is full and risen, whereas in New York it tends to be flat and bready. In any case, this pizza is still very delicious in its own right. :) Sauce is flavorful, crust is crispy on the bottom with a good chew, and the cheese is a modest amount -- a perfect ratio.\n\nThere's a small amount of seating inside (~20 seats plus wall area with bar stools) and some picnic tables and benches outside as well.\n\nOverall excellent and one of my favorite thin crust slices in SF!", "author": "Jennie W."}

As a visitor to San Francisco, it's gonna be hard for me to convert to thin, virtually sauce-less pizza.\n\nPizzeria Avellino is a tiny little restaurant with a limited menu.  You can either get slices or an entire pie, but don't expect to order small, medium or large.  They come in one size, depending on the style you get.\n\nI took a shot at the formaggio (four-cheese) napolitana style.  I sampled the first slice without alteration.  It was... good-ish.  It had such a slight flavor that as I continued chewing through the pie, I found myself dousing it with increasing amounts of powdered garlic, parmesan and red pepper.  I was disappointed by the lack of any substantial sauce.  It tasted less like pizza and more like flatbread with a thin cheese layer.\n\nAs I ate it, I couldn't help but thinking this was the kind of pizza girls would love.  It's light, it's not terribly flavorful.  It's the pizza equivalent of salad.  Maybe you'd hit this kind of place for lunch, but not to satisfy a monstrous hunger.\n\nTwo things were a bit odd about the restaurant...\n\n1) As I walked in, they were playing Rage Against The Machine over the speakers.  Awesome, sure, but it didn't quite fit their aesthetic.\n\n2) I asked for a cup of ice water.  \"We don't have ice,\" the guy said, \"but the water will be cold.\"  Ooookay?\n\nPerhaps their NY style pizza would be more up my alley.

It was so extremely thin that it could not hold itself up even with my hand propping it under the wax paper.  Eating this poorly formed pizza was an embarrassingly untidy chore.  The pizza maker was obviously a newbie and was not properly trained.  \n\nSecond, the pizza itself was lacking in flavor.  The crust was unlike NY pizza which has crispy outer skin with pleasantly chewy bread inside.  This pizza bread was just chewy.  The tomato sauce was flavorless and bland.  The cheese was reasonably good though.  The oregano on the table I sprinkled on the pizza was flavorless.

He is also the kind of guy that spent the first two years of college feeding on slices of pizza and ice cream in NY.  Lol.  I think I can technically claim that he is a pizza ho.\n\nOn the contrary, I like NY style pizzas okay, but prefer Italian style.  NY pizzas are tricky for me, as it can often involve fake cheese, lots of grease, and OD on salt.  So I'm pretty fussy when it comes to this type of pizza.\n\nWell, who would've thought we'd find a pizza joint that actually serves pretty authentic NY style pizza AND we actually both like, in San Francisco?  We totally beat the odds with Pizzeria Avellino.\n\nWe had a coupon that we bought from one of those online local 1-day deal type websites.  We ordered a medium Lombard Combo pizza with caesar salad, 1 beer and 1 Java tea... the bill came out to be $30... with the coupon I had, we effectively only paid $15. Cha - ching! : D\n\nThe Lombard Combo pizza was a perfect amount of tomato sauce and cheese topped with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and black olives, on a think, crispy crust.  Served up piping hot.  We dined-in so we ate it at the freshest condition; ) Not super greasy like some American pizzas can be.  That and the crispyness won some points from me.\n\nThe staff there was friendly and cool, although they kinda forgot our ceasar salad and I had to ask for it.  It looked like they just pulled it out from their fridge where they keep all their bottled drinks, though, so now that I think about it I don't know if I was supposed to get it myself?  Then again I would still have to get the croutons and dressing from them.  Anyway, caesar was VERY cheesy.  basically loads of shaved cheese on top of lettuce, plus croutons and rich caesar  dressing.  I liked it but it was so rich, after half the pizza, I was already ODing on salt and couldn't finish up the salad alone.  Good thing my husband prefers to be less healthy lol! as he helped finish up the salad too.  \n\nWe also like that they are open until 10pm.  I tend to take evening dance classes in the city and often don't get out until 9pm, so finding places we can swing by after 9 in the city is very key and much appreciated.

My son and I like thin crust pizza, so this pizzeria fits that category. \n\nThe three of us only tried 4 slices, so I can comment on how a whole pie would be, but we had the following thin-crust slices:\n\n* cheese for my son\n* veggie special of the day (peppers and olives) for me\n* meat special of the day (sausage and pepperoni) for husband\n* mushroom for husband and me to share\n\nMy son was very happy with his cheese pizza. He's picky, so that was a success. My husband and I weren't blown away with our pizza. It was just okay.\n\nThey added the toppings before reheating our slices. The peppers on my pizza had a smoky flavor, so I pulled most of them off (not being a fan of smoky flavors). My veggie slice could've been slightly hotter. The mushrooms were just so-so; I found myself comparing them to Speederia in San Carlos (I prefer their thin-crust mushroom pizza). Speederia's toppings are already on each pizza, as opposed to adding toppings before reheating slices like they do here.\n\nWe had some root beer. They have no ice (strange), but a good variety of beverages.\n\nService was friendly. The interior is small, clean, and inviting. The d\u00e9cor is a few steps above your average pizza joint. The posted health inspection report is 96, a very respectable score. Kudos!\n\nThe pizza wasn't remarkable, but it tasted fresh and the ambiance was pleasant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-19", "description": "I don't write a review, whether good or bad, very often and only do so when I feel it is warranted and I have actually something to say about certain stores, restaurants or repair shops and their service, food or quality of workmanship, for example, and not just for the sake of 'yelping' or blabbing about something that has nothing or very little to do with the place that's being reviewed. However, today is one of those days where I feel a review is in order. \n\nHad to take my mother to the doc's office this morning and afterwards we stopped at Avellino for a couple of slices. She's a pizza connoisseur and definitely knows a great NY-style pie when she sees it. Anyway, she had the veggie slice of the day, a mushroom/red onion and I had a plain cheese and a sausage slice. \n\nI have had my fair share of NY-style pizza here in the City and Avellino is hands down the best in SF. The crust was light, airy and had a nice crunch to it without being chewy. The slices were foldable and the tip had a flop to it that NYC slices are known for, which leads me to believe that the dough might have a bit of oil in it. The flavor of the crust was balanced, with a slight hint of salt. My guess is that it is a low-hydration dough, maybe around 59%-60% with no sugar. Well, at least I wasn't able to detect any sweetness in the crust whatsoever. I think it's just flour, water, salt, yeast and a touch of oil, maybe around 1% or so. And since they use whole milk mozzarella from Wisconsin, my bet is that it comes from the Grande Cheese Company.\n\nThe cheese/sauce ratio was perfectly balanced, with the sauce having a slightly sweet undertone, and the sausage had a nice fennel flavor without the fennel being overpowering. My mother was blown away. She just loved every bite of the slice and kept mumbling about what a perfect crust it is.\n\nI've been to Avellino three times now and they never disappoint. Much better than over-hyped and over-priced Amici's, Tony's or Arinell's. Service is always friendly and accommodating. The only other place that rivals Avellino is Marcello's on Castro Street.\n\nAvellino is always great and I'll be back for more when the pizza craving comes back in the future.

We saw the sign and thought we'd see how their pies were. \nWow. And not in a good way.\n I'm not a kid anymore, I'm 49.

I really felt like vaulting the counter and smashing his  teeth down his arrogant throat, his attitude was so poor and his disdain for us so obvious. Hands down the worst trained staff I have EVER seen or dealt with-I read the reviews saying how wonderful this truly awful shithole is for 'families and kids'? Apparently penned by people who lack a set of standards that most sane people possess? Because this restaurant is the most egregious example of ignoring the importance of hiring good staff and training them to represent your business to the public in a positive way I have ever experienced-and I worked in the Food Service industry for over 25 years. Truly astonishing, the level of rudeness and apathy towards those who pay their salaries and pay the rent for this train wreck.

If you've read the book \"Blink\" by Malcolm Gladwell, you'll know what I mean when I say the moment I walked in within a split second I felt something was wrong.  It was instinctual.  Something didn't feel right, I felt totally unwelcome.  The negative energy from the guy behind the counter was so bad, I had to ask the pizza maker guy if they were still serving pizza, and he said yes.  The pizza maker guy was the 'nice guy' relatively speaking.  The guy who took our order, the punk wearing the beanie, rang me up and seemed liked I was totally inconveniencing him.  But it gets better...\n\nI ALWAYS tip no matter where I go, 10% minimum if the person simply serves me food.  After he ran me up, I had $1.50 of change in my hand, and promptly put it in my pocket.  I reiterate what 'Must Love Pork' wrote.  This same kid was throwing the trays and plates in the back area, totally pissed at the customers who were sitting in there eating.  He was sweeping the floors aggressively near my feet to send me a message.  Then he stood over the restaurant with arms crossed, facing the two tables left, with a scowl on his face, waiting for us to leave.  Holy sh*t, I couldn't believe what I was watching.  Being from NYC I was inclined to confront this child, but it was better to leave him to continue his tantrum.  As I walked out past him, I still expected someone had taught this guy the standard \"Thank you\", but got nothing, not a word.  As I was reeling in even this last omission, I got a big \"Wham\" as the door slammed behind me.  Unbelievable.  I actually laughed it was so astonishing.\n\nI feel better that I didn't say anything, because I know it was purely horrible customer service on his end, I didn't instigate anything, was a display of poor management of employees, despite decent pizza.  I would fire this guy so fast and not think about reprimanding him because it isn't worth the time.  That's an inherent understanding of customer service that he can't be taught.

My first impression was this place was pricey; a cheese slice + soda for $4?? I've seen them for $2 in other places. Hubby pointed out we were in such neighborhood. \n\nWell, we ordered a medium Lombard combo. At $17, this was a pleaser! Truly a medium sized pizza, this was worth every bite. Compared to Extreme Pizza, whose large is pretty much a medium to me, this was priced fairly.  Between 2 adults and a toddler, we had plenty to eat. Our second child is just a baby so she didn't have any, but she was happy with her milk. \n\nI can't give this place 5 stars only because there weren't that many options and they don't offer drinks by the pitcher. We recently had pizza at Dino's on Fillmore and I was spoiled by the pitchered drink to drown my pizza down. Avellino's, if you could even just offer a pitchered drink, I'd upgrade this review to 4.5 stars. \n\nOverall, a great pizza for reasonable price! We'll come back again.", "author": "Anio D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-03", "description": "My hubby is part Italian and from the NY area.  He has always loved a good thin crust pizza; definitely not a fan of deep dish.  I'm not Italian and have only visited the NY area.  I've always loved a tasty pizza; however, I've always leaned towards the thin crust side over the doughy deep dish style pizza.  We're a match made in pizza heaven.  \n\nI was craving pizza one day after watching a television show where the characters were macking on some slices. The hubby and I are always looking for some good NY style pizza so I turned to fellow Yelpers to help us out.  Pizza Avellino popped up first and we scurried on the bus in hopes of filling our tummies with deliciousness.\n\n* Space:  Although there are less than a dozen tables inside, the place is quaint and definitely good for eating a few slices.  Also, there's a TV over the door that can keep you preoccupied while waiting for your food if you're alone or the company you came with isn't entertaining enough.\n* Atmosphere:  The place smells of deliciousness and gives off a homely vibe.  You walk in and immediately can see them making the pies and salads in the back.  \n* Drink: You can get canned or bottled sodas and wine or beer.  Although the wine list isn't extensive, it's a refined list for the size the place.  \n* Eat:  We got a simple medium pepperoni pie.  It was served up piping hot from the oven and had the right ratio of cheese:sauce and a great crispy crust. The pepperoni's were nickel sized (not a big deal, although I like the bigger slices) and there were a good amount on each slice.\n* Service:  The guys greeted us in a friendly manner immediately upon stepping into the place.  They offered suggestions, told us how long it would take for our pie to come out, brought the tableware and pie when it was fresh out of the oven.  \n\nOverall:  I'd say it's well worth your money to get a pie over a slice or two (even if you have to take some home).  Although it was out of the way for us, the ride over was definitely nice on a clear day through the Presidio.  I would definitely make the trek again to try some of their other pies.", "author": "melinda m."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-08-26", "description": "Hi folks,\nI am compelled to update this review. As of late, it seems that ALL of the pizza coming from Avellino is reheated, which is UNCOOL.\n\nA couple of days ago, my neighbor and I ordered a medium pizza. As I mentioned in my original review, pizza by the slice was already cooked and reheated, but ordering a whole pizza guaranteed a fresh pie. This is no longer the case. Our medium pizza was obviously a pizza that had been cooked as a cheese pizza, and then reheated with our desired toppings. It was very evident by the fact that my \"extra cheese\" was a completely different color and state of melt than the original cheese.  In addition, there were also strange bits of sausage, as if cooked sausage had been removed at some point. Again, UNCOOL.\n\nWe brought the pizza back to the store (we discovered this atrocity after we walked home with it). When we confronted the workers, they were saying one thing, then contradicting themselves, about how all of the pizza is half baked, and then toppings are added halfway through the cooking. Of course, this makes no sense -- would you add only cheese, and then add \"extra cheese\" and toppings halfway through the cook cycle? Preposterous. All of the NYC pizzerias I know will cook a pizza, with your desired toppings, from beginning to end when you order an entire pie. We could only surmise that Avellino bakes a lot of cheese pizzas in advance, and then reheats them, which is abominable. Tolerable for slices, but not OK for full pies. This was confirmed by the rack of cooked and now cold pizzas we saw in a rack next to the preparation area. We ordered a pizza at 7pm -- are they cooking these pizzas at 3pm and letting them sit for hours? WTF?\n\nThey agreed to make us a new pizza. When the new pizza came out, it looked exactly the same as the first one (minus the sausage bits). Very disappointing. And it tasted just like it looked -- superficially hot crust, but not hot, melted cheese stretching everywhere, like one would expect from a fresh pizza. Again, a formerly cheese pizza that they had added toppings to and reheated. Shameful!\n\nIn light of this, I am on a pizza boycott from this establishment. They were my favorite place and now I won't even set foot in there. It's a real shame, as I live very close by and was so excited when they opened up, and told all of my friends to come to the Marina for pizza. Now, I feel a responsibility to tell them to take their business elsewhere.\n\nThis is, indeed, a very sad day.\n\nPS - they are also charging $2.75 for a 16oz of coke -- the liquor store next door sells the same for $1.75.", "author": "rachel s."}

Walked in at 8:45pm (15 minutes before they closed), and the guy working was CLEARLY not happy that we were there. He was in the middle of his closing duties and while we waited for our pizza, he wanted everyone to know that he had somewhere else to be. Dishes were tossed into the bins carelessly and  it was so loud, I actually couldn't carry on a conversation with my fiance. We sat there quietly and cringed every time dishes and pizza pans slammed against each other. He actually threw his side towel across the room into the cashier station, obviously mad that we walked in right before closing. The icing on the cake was when he stood near our table, WITH HIS ARMS CROSSED and waited until we were so uncomfortable, we had no other choice but to grab our sodas and leave. I walked out pissed off, ahead of my fiance and as we walked out of the door (no \"good-bye, or \"thanks\") HE SLAMMED THE DOOR ON US!!!! Seriously?!?! In this city, where there are a BILLION other places to eat pizza???? We usually go to Amici's but decided to try a new place after a game of bowling in the Presidio. My advice: Go to Amici's, Pizza Orgasmica, Extreme Pizza...Taco Bell...WHEREVER...but DO NOT bother with this place. Even though Taco Bell chicken has more hormones then my birth control pill, I'd be willing to risk the hormonal fluctuation then to actually pay money for someone to piss me off.

Excellent NY style pizza in a simple place.  Rustic pizzas are pretty darn good also. Wine, beer and salads are coming soon, but it doesn't even matter. This place is all about the slices and pies.", "author": "butt p."}

I wish I had a beer to wash it down but the owners tell me its in the works.  Joel and Steve are the owners and are a great addition to the neighborhood.  Good Luck Gentlemen!  I am a fan.", "author": "Paul R."}
