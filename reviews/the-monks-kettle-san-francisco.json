The service is very friendly and efficient, and the food is on point. I recommend adding yourself the Yelp waitlist to avoid waiting for too long. \nBetween my bf and I, we shared a bottle of Cabernet Franc, a pretzel, pickle jar, mussels, and tamales. Perfect amount.\n\nPickle jar: love the assortment of veggies! There were some beets, bell peppers, cauliflower, asparagus, cucumbers, onions... very vinegary! (5/5)\n\nPretzel: love! Fluffy, not greasy. Some places put too much butter in their pretzels, but this place doesn't. It comes with whole grain mustard-- delicious! (5/5)\n\nMussels: Generous portion. Although a few of the mussels had closed shells (don't ever eat them if you didn't know that, haha), it was a great dish overall. It comes with only a little bit of broth, which is extremely salty. It's definitely not a broth you would want to slurp with a spoon. The grilled bread that comes with it is fluffy and delicious, and definitely can be used to mop up a bit of the broth. (4.5/5)\n\nTamales: my bf really enjoyed this and polished this dish off. It comes with a generous portion of avocado. (5/5)\n\nI'll definitely be back!", "author": "Christina W."}

They serve a good variety of beers too if you're looking for Kolsch, saisons, or darker beers too.  \n\nFor the food, I had the lamb burger and the fried oyster.  Both were great.  The lamb burger came with some arugula and cheese.  The cheese wasn't too overpowering over the lamb burger.  It was also a great juicy burger too.  I really enjoyed their fried oyster as well (I usually don't care for these, but the pictures made it look good).

She suggested that we pick a BART station and wander off from there.  Rockridge and Glen Park were initially considered and rejected.  I then suggested that Gayle contact her nephew (Ben) to see if he and his Wife (Fathima) wanted to meet in the Mission (where they lived) for Lunch. And before you could say \"16th and Mission\" it was a 12 Noon date at The Monk's Kettle. \n\nThe 4 of us had a great time.  We sat outside on a rare warm and sunny day and chatted away over a nice selection of craft beers (draft this time),  delicious appetizers of Caramelized brussels sprouts (with honey, balsamic red onion reduction, lemon) and Pretzel knots (with beer cheese fondue and house mustard).  We continued on with 2 Monk's Burgers (with fries to share), 1 Lamb Burger, and a Tuna Nicoise Salad Sandwich.  All were excellent.  Service was friendly, unobtrusive, and knowledgeable concerning food options and beer selection.  It was also fun to interact with the dog at the next table and talk about life in the city and upcoming family activities. \n\nAfter our goodbye hugs, Ben and Fatz headed home, while Gayle and I needed to work off a very satisfying and filling lunch. After a stop for ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery, we walked to Castro Street, turned left, went up and over to 24th Street, strolled through Noe Valley, and returned to the 24th and Mission BART station.  We'll definitely do something like this again, and maybe with a walking tour thrown in.  This time around, the Monk's Kettle was the fuel for our exploratory fire.", "author": "Eric B."}

You'd think an empty establishment would be happy to have some business on a slow Monday night but for whatever reason this particular server kept on being rude to us. The final straw for me was when he bumped into me while I was standing at the bar, which he made us stand at because he wouldn't let us sit at a table, and had the nerve to tell me I was in his his way.

A smallish storefront, with an L-shaped bar, booths, and (presumably only in good weather) outside tables.  Friendly and informative bartender, and one guy who appeared to be the owner or manager.  I didn't try their food service, but it appears fairly ambitious for a place of this sort, including daily off-menu specials and a weekend brunch.  Printed beer list, featuring 29 drafts at $4.50-$11.75; over 100 bottles and cans, sorted by style, at $6.50-$63.00 (not a typo!); and ten or so vintage bottles at $12.00-$56.00.  Also functions as a bottle shop, with bottles and cans to go 25% off the menu price. Brand-specific logo glassware for many but not all drafts.  Menu includes a useful glossary of beer terms. \n\nI tried three brews:\n\n- Bruery Terreux Frederick H. Berliner Weisse. 4.4% ABV.   6-oz. tulip, $6.50.  Deep clear gold, fast-fading 2-finger head.  Very tart, fairly fizzy; a good example of a style which isn't one of my favorites.  (When it's available, I usually tone down Berliner Weisse tartness with Himbeersaft (raspberry syrup) or Waldmeister (woodruff).  \n\n- Cellarmaker Quadruple Dobis Quadruple IPA.  12.8%, 106 IBU.  $7.50 for an 8-oz. wine glass.  Near-clear orange-gold, halo and patches head.  Noble hop and peach nose.  Taste us a rich sweet malt balanced against assertive hop bitterness; the alcohol rises to a flavor note.\n\n-  Ale Smith Decadence Winter Wheat Wine (2014).  10%.  6-oz., $7.75.  Poured from an already-opened bottle; the bartender tasted it, found it flat, discarded it, and opened a new one.  (Mixed feelings on my part as I watched the remnants of the old bottle go down the drain--\"sober children in China,\" and all that.)  A beautiful clear amber, light head, a bit of sediment.  Sweet malt and pear nose.  Deep sweet malt taste, with candi sugar obvious among the fermentables; wheat presence not apparent.  Moderate hoppiness in the finish.  Delicious and potentially sneaky.\n\nOne TV, muted, tuned to sports programming.  Background music.  Clean gender-neutral restroom.\n\nStreet parking, theoretically; I believe the last person actually to find an open space in the Mission was Junipero Serra.  A block and a half (disregarding a few minor side streets) from the 16th-Mission BART station.  On the 22-Fillmore bus line, which, for pub crawlers, provides a convenient 5-10 minute connection to Toronado at Haight and Fillmore.", "author": "Alan F."}

The fish filet was placed upside down on the bed of uncut bitter lettuce leaves, some if which were as big as my face. \n\nThe filet wasn't cooked properly, the fillet got an overcook split in the middle, so the presentation had to hide this oversight.\n\nThe peculiar salad also had half circles of persimmons, cubes of beets, and whole walnuts. Nether I could taste these ingredients together nor it looked nice or cohesive. \n\nI asked the waiter about the salad and just to cut it a bit better. After that, I was able to eat more than one ingredient, so it got apparent that the bitter taste of greens and the dressing doesn't compliment the fish at all, but overpowers it.\n\nThe vegetarian burger with fries was nicely done, my husband had a nice dinner for sure. Again, how hard is it to make a nice burger?\n\nLong story short, basic traditional taste pallet is the strongest at this place, as far a little more complex flavors are out of Monk Kettle's league.", "author": "Julia G."}

An unbelievably long list of craft beers by the bottle and on draft make this place one of the better beer bars in San Francisco. What's even cooler is that they cellar certain beers and release them many years later (like wine), and offer them to their patrons. I mean, that's dedication.  \n\nI happen to be a huge sour beer fan and it just so happens that The Monk's Kettle is serving up some summertime session sours. I stopped by last Saturday as I hadn't been in a while and when the sun is out, sour beers taste amazing! It's normally pretty packed on the weekends but, we were able to find a couple spots at the bar after being greeted by a really nice doorman. \n\nWe ordered a couple different sours on draft from Russian River Brewing Company (Santa Rosa, CA). They were both aged in wine barrels, one from a Chardonnay and the other Pinot Noir. Did I mention they were amazing?! One thing I love about sour beers is how they are respected and treated. Monk's Kettle serves all of their beer in wine glasses so you can get the full effect of the beer's quality. Props to that. \n\nI've always wanted to eat here as the food coming out of the kitchen looks amazing. Guess I'll be back soon for some more sour beer and kitchen fare. :)", "author": "Benjamin F."}

This place has a huge selection of beer that does not disappoint any type of beer drinker. A hot place in the Mission as there is a pretty huge wait for a table inside on a weekday for an early dinner. Clearly they know what they're doing.\n\nWe started with some meat and cheese which was honestly a bit of a let down. My expectations may be too high, but was not all that impressed with the meats or cheeses. I did very much like their apricot chutney and their mustard though.\n\nI very much like their burger. Big and tasty. Meat cooked perfectly to rare/medium rare with huge flavor. Delicious caramelized onions to bring the cheese and greens together. Served next to a large bed of fries which were standard.\n\nThe flank steak. This was okay. The SAUCE was magical. A mushroom cream sauce with HUGE flavor. Unfortunately, the steak was too chewy. Lots of tendons and what not, a bit difficult to eat. Maybe should've ordered it a little less rare.\n\nIn the end, the beer menu here is stellar and the vibe is just what you would expect.

Maybe these folks enjoy ripping off their clientele, but I cannot justify returning to this establishment. \n\n$10 for a Temescal Brewing IPA (brewed in OAKLAND several miles away). This beer costs $6 at the brewery. \n\nHere's the kicker:\n$10 for Cellarmaker Brewing beer (brewed a mere 1.4 miles away!!) you could walk over there in 15 minutes and save yourself $3. \n\nIf that's not bad enough they also charge an additional TAX on the beers as well. So two LOCAL beers comes to around $23 plus tip. Sorry, but $10 for a LOCAL beer should include tax. \n\nThis is just pure price inflation with no justification to do so.

We called in advance to check if their kitchen was still available since majority of us were hungry. Their kitchen is open all night until closing. Since The Monk's Kettle is located in the Mission area of Dolores Park, parking is terribly hard to find. After circling around for awhile, we finally found one 5 blocks away. I'd suggest you take Uber here. Anyways upon entering, you get your ID checked at the door. The waitress brought us to our seat in the back and I was surprised but happy that it wasn't one of those overcrowded bars. Our waitress was really nice and came to check on us several times. \n\nWe shared the pretzel knots, Monk's burger with fries, Mac and cheese with bacon, kale salad and a steak dish with potato confit. Everything was delicious and there were no complaints. \n\nMy girlfriend and I both agreed the Mac and cheese was definitely our favorite thing on the table. It's cheesy, creamy and a really nice touch with the added bacon. \n\nThe burger was juicy and the fries were fried to a perfect crisp. \n\nThe infamous pretzel knots were great as well-we ordered these (2 for $11) because a lot of Yelpers advised us to and they were pretty good. It came with two dipping sauces: one with the same cheese as the Mac and cheese and the other was a mustard dip. \n\nThe kale salad with added chicken was a nice variety, however I felt this dish lacked a missing ingredient-not sure what.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-06", "description": "The Monk's Kettle pretty much ruined the Mission District bar crawl for me, simply because there's really no other place worth visiting in the Mission District after you've been (and have been promptly seated at) to the Monk's Kettle.\n\nWhere to even begin. The food at Monk's Kettle is out of this world; I've never once been disappointed with their Monk's Daily Sandwich, and the charcuterie board is a home run if you're just stopping by for a few casual drinks late in the afternoon. If you end up staying for dinner, like I usually end up doing once I see the lines forming outside, their trout is a delightful combination of juicy and chewy (two adjectives I don't commonly associate together with fish), and I double dog dare anyone to NOT fall in love with their duck confit. It's impossible, I swear.\n\nThe beers. By now everyone has that one friend who is absolutely bonkers about craft beer. When I say absolutely bonkers, I mean that this one friend is the one that drives four-five hours to a different state for bottle releases, will look his nose down at you for drinking an IPA out of a nonic pint glass, and publicly shame anyone who thinks Blue Moon is a \"craft beer.\" Monk's Kettle is kind of like that annoying friend, except he has an ulterior motive to be nice to you in that he wants your money. So imagine that the one beard-toting, hop-sniffing, pot-belly-having, brewery t-shirt wearing friend suddenly had some sort of a lightning epiphany and decided he wanted to share all of his prized possessions with you (in exchange for money) and you pretty much have the Monk's Kettle.\n\nFor those of you that speak beer, the Monk's Kettle is one of two places that I can count on to carry Russian River Brewing Company's Pliny the Elder on tap at any given day of the year. They also have around 25+ taps of beer, primarily from CA (Cellarmaker and Firestone Walker being the usual suspects) with some other choice curations from around the US and Europe. They also have an extensive, yet somehow rotating bottle list as well which includes a vintage ($$$) sour/stout selection; a very curious selection of hard-to-find (albeit grossly marked up) Belgian beers with the likes of De Dolle Brouwers, Brasserie De la Senne, and Oud Beersel; and for extra brownie points, they also serve the original Leipziger Gose here as well.\n\nIf by some chance you're that one absolutely bonkers guy and are still sporting a resting meh face even after reading the above paragraph, Monk's Kettle is also a long-time participant of Pliny the Younger Day (February); on top of that they regularly have themed tap events, like hosting a vertical of all the years and variants of Deschutes' the Abyss, for example. \n\nMy advice for any beer-oriented guy or gal looking for a good time in the Mission District would be to shut up and let Monk's Kettle take your money.", "author": "Scott S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-09", "description": "Summary: I had an excellent brunch experience on a Sunday at 2pm. The service was exceptional and the food was delicious.  I would go back and order the burger at brunch or dinner, and I'd be interested to try other things on their brunch and dinner menu and their beer menu. \n\nThere were a few tables available inside, and I was eventually directed to one by the busy but friendly staff.  \n\nFrom the first server (woman), I ordered the smoke trout salad ($15) and the burger ($18), medium rare, with two patties (extra $8). I asked the second server (guy) who came to fill my water glass for the second patty after I saw the size of someone else's burger, and he said \"Sure!  No one has asked for that before because they're about 7oz, but ok!\".  We had a good laugh (and yes, I eventually ate 14oz of delicious burger).  \n\nBoth servers were busy but attentive and they refilled my water when it was low.  Despite their bustle, they seemed genuinely concerned about how my meal and experience was, which was nice!\n\nThe salad came to the table first.  When the salad came dressed, I pointed out that I asked for it on the side, and the friendly server (guy) was really quick to apologize and make sure I got my correct order.   It was really just a slight mishap that didn't bother me much, and they adjusted quickly and were very considerate and quick to replace the dressed salad a few minutes later.  After an undressed salad arrived and I was enjoying it, the first server (woman) who took my order quickly came over to make sure that everything was okay, and it was!  The smoked trout was tasty, the manchego added nice salt and creaminess, and I didn't need the dressing.  3.5 out of 5.  It wasn't very memorable or a must-have, but it was a nice start to the meal.  \n\nThe burger was a solid 4 out of 5.  The flavor and texture of the meat was nice and well, meaty, and both quality patties were a perfect medium rare.  The sweet and soft onion jam, the soft cheese and the flavorful aioli gave it the good flavor and texture.  The bun was a good size match in size for one patty and had decent flavor (so I took one patty off and ate it alone...it was good).   While the bun wasn't toasted on the outside, which might have made it better, it was a good vehicle for the rest of the burger ingredients.  \nI had mixed greens on the side with the dressing on the side, and the dressing was popping with flavor.  It was so good I dipped the rich/fatty burger in the tangy dressing, and that turned out to be an unexpectedly good choice.  \n\nNo beer for me this time around, but the beer menu is extensive and I'd like to explore it next time. \n\n(Side note: I'm not a believer in gruyere as a good cheese on most burgers.  It was alright on this one, but per the usual gruyere-on-burger, it didn't elevate the burger with texture, flavor, or mouth-feel.  Maybe it added richness?  I think gruyere tastes its best at room temperature, when it's solid, and some of its salty and funky qualities get lost in most burgers.  If you feel the same way, and if you want the burger at Monk's Kettle, ask the server if they have other cheese options.  The gruyere was good, it just wasn't what I would have chosen for it.  It doesn't hurt to ask, right?)", "author": "Andrew D."}

The best part about the poutine was definitely the pulled pork shoulder. It went well with the (slightly over salted but otherwise bland) fries. There wasn't much cheese curd in this poutine.\n\nI got a Kale salad, it wasn't a good choice.

Understandably, the place was packed and we expected a wait. After an hour or so, they said that they would have to split up our tables, but because one table was already free, the first half of our party would need to take our seats.\n\nOk, so we parted ways and took our seats. We put in some drink orders while the rest of the party remained outside, waiting for their table to open up which took another 20-30 minutes (and was located in the other corner of the restaurant). We didn't want to order our food until the other half of our party was seated, because we didn't want to finish our entire dinner before they had even started... Thus we continued to sip on our drinks. However, our procrastination only lasted us for so long and we were told that we needed to put our food orders in as soon as possible if we were to stay at our table. We were essentially forced into ordering before the other half of our party was situated.\n\nThe food ended up being mediocre and overpriced. The beer selection was good, but nothing noteworthy. The entire experience was a huge letdown, being that we really wanted to experience what was known as one of the city's greatest gastropubs. We just weren't impressed with anything at Monk's.\n\n(Props to the door man, though. He was probably the nicest and most patient person there.

The boyfriend and I decided on Monk's Kettle because, well, it was open on New Years. Oh, and he's head-over-heels for their grilled chicken sandwich, which he proclaims is the best he's ever had.\n\nPredictably, the moment I eyed the word \"burger\" on the menu, my heart and stomach tossed to the wind any notion of a chicken sandwich and committed to bodacious beef.\n\nBefore we get to the food, Monk's is also known for their extensive beer selection. He adores the dark, frothy, bitter Obsidian Nitro stout from Deschutes Brewery in Oregon, whereas I chose the lighter Vitus Weizenbock from Germany. We probably should have waited for our food to arrive, but sometimes beer should be its own meal. With repercussions.\n\nHe ordered the $26 half chicken under a brick with cranberry beans and pickled peppers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-monks-kettle-san-francisco?select=ubTrls_1hijhXL8aur7AXQ#ubTrls_1hijhXL8aur7AXQ), and I have to say, they do chicken well. Juicy tender chicken enveloped by a lightly crisped skin, accompanied by a serving of richly seasoned veggies and beans. Spot on.\n\nMy $16 fresh ground beef burger with onion jam and aged white cheddar, served with a side of fries or a side salad for $5, was fantastic, excepting the rarity of the burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-monks-kettle-san-francisco?select=ubTrls_1hijhXL8aur7AXQ#u3-NduRwxbPdzFwrGz79Ag). I asked for medium-rare, and it came out closer to medium, but the patty was remarkable, generous with fat, juices gushing out with every bite (wow, describing good food is incredibly sensual...). The patty is simply seasoned with salt, so you mainly taste the heartiness of the beef. The melted cheddar is fabulous, and the onion jam is the icing on the cake...I mean, burger. A burger well done.\n\nAs a burger fanatic, my criteria has narrowed down to an obsession with thick, juicy, hearty patties (versus my previous holistic evaluation of patty + bun + toppings yadda yadda just cut to the meat). I would still rank Wes Burger #1, largely due to the unique salty char he gives his patties. A very close second, third, and fourth go to Monk's, 900 Grayson in Berkeley, and NOPA. Then come Serpentine and Umami, then Marlowe and Roam. Big Chef Tom will give you your pork belly burger fix, and Chez Maman will break your stereotypes on the identity of a burger. Smashburger and Super Duper deliver slightly larger patties than In-N-Out and Jenny's Burger in Inner Sunset.\n\nCan't get any better than a burger P:", "author": "Adele F."}

The variety of beers here number well into the hundreds, which normally means that someone like myself who doesn't really drink beer would be screwed. Fortunately, I am blessed with friends that do, and do it a lot. And with hundreds of beers to pick from, it's not entirely surprisingly that they actually found one that I enjoyed: who said choice was necessarily a bad thing (when you have someone else choosing for you, anyway).\n\nNow, enjoyable as the beer was, the food was definitely the highlight. My friend proclaimed their burger to be the best she's had in the city, but, well, I wasn't so easily convinced about the worthiness of a $17 burger, so, instead, I went with their roasted mushroom risotto instead, which was absolutely fantastic: rich, flavorful, creamy, and very filling. My friend, kind soul that she is, offered me a bite of her burger, if not just to prove a point. That point being that, yes, their burger IS indeed incredibly good. Certainly among the best I've had in the city, but, having had Nostra's raviolo burger recently, best is debatable.\n\nMy only qualms with the place? It's certainly a little on the pricier side, but worse is the fact that they don't take reservations, which, in our case, meant waiting for two hours before we had the opportunity to eat. But, if you don't mind drinking while you wait, and you show up before you're hungry, Monk's Kettle ain't a bad option.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - While the place is accessible, maneuvering through the restaurant when it's busy (so, basically, all weekend) can prove to be a little challenging with the narrow walkways. The tables and counter seating in the very back don't pose any height difficulties though, that being said.\n\nBathroom - In the very back, so, assuming you can make it back there, given the aforementioned, the bathroom itself is totally accessible.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Some intersection of timing, the fact that we were eating AND drinking, and the moon was in the house of mars or something. \n\nAmazing beer list, but they do seem to prefer that you purchase some of their amazing food. We go the burger and it was probably one of the best I've ever had. Cooking at home, I aspire to the amount of salt/pepper that was featured on my Monk's Kettle burger. Wish I was hungrier, as everything there looked delicious, but my wallet thanks me. \n\nSide note, the bouncer here was a pretty friendly guy.", "author": "Brian B."}

Their beer list cannot be beat. On top of that, the food is amazing. As a vegetarian, I'm always hesitant about gastropubs-- they tend to be pretty meat-heavy. But the Kettle is different. I love their mushroom risotto, and their spent grain and chickpea burger is the best veggie burger I have ever had. Not to mention their UNBELIEVABLE warm pretzel knots served with melted cheese and whole-grain mustard. I could eat those all day. And for dessert, don't miss the chocolate bread pudding, but you may have to share it because it's pretty rich.\n\nYes, it's crowded here-- get used to it because they deserve the attention. Yes, it's expensive, but the food and beer are definitely worth it. I recommend showing up on the early side, putting your name down for a table, and then grabbing a seat at the bar and getting a beer and a pretzel knot. Or you could even order dinner at the bar-- not a bad option if there's only one or two of you. But don't let the crowds or prices deter you-- the Monk's Kettle is worth it. \n\nAlso, I hear they just started serving brunch as soon as I moved away. MONK'S KETTLE, HOW DARE YOU?! The only flaw with this place when I lived in the Mission was that they didn't serve brunch, and of course as soon as I go to New York, they change that. Well, for all you San Franciscans, I bet their brunch is amazing. I bet it's the best in the city. How could it not be?", "author": "Lee A."}

The best part of the experience is taste testing, and I tried several, even if I ended up playing it safe with an IPA.\n\nWe started with some butternut squash soup, which was a decadent, not-to-sweet blend garnished with fresh herbs. A must during El Ni\u00f1o!\n\nNext we split two entrees: the spent grain & chick pea burger, and the pan seared whole rainbow trout. Honestly, we couldn't have ordered better.\n\nThe veg burger had so much texture and flavor, and was topped with tzatziki, roasted red pepper, and pickled shallot. Such an intricate blend, and a hearty portion. Certainly something you'd want to split, especially given all of the filling beer you need to consume.\n\nThe trout was just as delicious, and a lighter dish that paired well with it's fennel puree-squash-apples-pecans-brown butter accompanying side. The ingredients felt wholesome and tasted delicious --- not something you always necessarily feel about your side side. It was warming, and the spicy and sweets aromas made for the perfect winter dish.\n\nI'd recommend getting here early, because it's always packed. Start at the bar, and work your way to a table for a meal you'll long for again, long after the fact.", "author": "Rachel H."}

The fried cornmeal oysters were a must-have. Often fried oysters no longer taste of the oyster itself but these absolutely did.

Where do I get started? The fries were thick and dry. The ketchup had no flavor. None. Even sweet and salty was missing. The garlic aioli was like eating bulk quantity mayo resembling elmer's glue flavored with garlic pieces. Revolting. \n\nThe wine braised short rib was tasteless. It was also dry and tough in some parts. Unfortunately the kale is came with was bathed in salt (though flavorful contrary to the rest of the food here). The butternut squash pur\u00e9e cut the saltiness but there wasn't enough of it. My friends risotto was crunchy. Like...Saturday evening-rushed-dinner-entree crunchy. The sauce was passable if somewhat one-dimensional. Had some of my friend's salad and even the beets were bland! \n\nI felt disgusting the rest of the night because I was hungry when I got there so I ate a lot of food. Definitely disrespected my body.

Even on a Tuesday night it was very full since people went to eat as well. Since we had a party of 8, we had to wait a little bit, but the guy at the door was beyond nice! He was very accommodating and kept updating us on the status of our tables. His service stood out, and he tried his best to get the 8 of us together, so in the end we could sit together. \n\nThe beer menu is amazing with hundreds of selection, and around 20-30 on draft. I really wanted to try the oyster beer, but they ran out, so I went with a coconut milk stout, which was refreshing, dark, and not too heavy. I love stouts, but sometimes the chocolate or espresso flavored ones get too heavy, so I'm glad the coconut milk one was refreshing and lighter. My friends got ciders and an espresso stout, which were all unique and amazing. This gastropub has beer I've never tried or seen before, and that is what will keep me coming back. \n\nThe ambience is actually not too suitable for groups and is better for smaller groups or dates. The cozy and casual atmosphere combined with great food and drinks make it a good sit down place to chat although it can get easily crowded with the smaller space. \n\nI would come back to Monks Kettle just for the beer selection, but it is not my top choice in terms of ambience because I don't like smaller bars usually.", "author": "Annie C."}

I also enjoyed their burger, done medium rare (perfectly) with delicious caramelized onions & spring mix lettuce.

The pretzel was different than any pretzel I've ever had before. It was flakey and warm and they served it with this warm cheese sauce. They also provided a slide of whole grained honey mustard.

To start we all ordered beers, which they have an incredibly huge selection of drafts and bottles/cans, along with the pretzels (1 for $6 and 2 for $11) and bone marrow. Pretzels were really tasty and yeasty. The bone marrow I didn't think had a lot of marrow to so and more just buttery liquid, but the mushrooms on top were pretty good. For our meals, two of us ordered the roast of the night, which was short ribs with some type of bread pudding and broccolini. This was so amazing and tasty. Huge portion of short rib that was all meat rather than laden with fat. Also paired really nicely with the beer they recommended. Our other friend ordered the mussels and she seemed to enjoy as well.

Granted, I haven't gone out of my way to get burgers (haven't gotten Spruce's), but I have been to some pretty legit spots: Chez Maman, Umami, Greenburgers, Super Duper (feel free to debate the authenticity of that...).\n\nTHE WAIT: We got there at 6:30pm on a Friday and put our name down. It was about an hour wait, which was better than we expected. There's plenty to do around there between shops and other bars, and the hour passed by all too quickly.\n\nTHE SERVICE: They were crazy busy, but our server was really cool, very chill.\n\nMUST-HAVES: Burger, Bread Pudding!\n\nDRINKS:\n* Aecht Schlenkerla Marzen (Smoked Beer, $14) - 4 stars\nCan't really comment for myself, but my boyfriend really liked this.\n\n*Boon Krick (Cherry Lambic, $32 bottle) - 4 stars\nA must-share for the girls.

Schmidt's has a slightly better one with a sharp flavor from their large chunks of sea salt, a little softer w/ more of that just-out-of-the-oven freshness. But Monk's Kettles' was still great.\n\nSTARTERS\n* Chopped Kale Salad (dried apricots, toasted quinoa, persimmon almonds. $11) - 4 stars\nI always love dishes with toasted quinoa - it adds so much to the texture.

So one day, my friend was like \"Let's just check this place out.\"\n\nI went inside to put my name on their waiting list while my friend was heading over because I figured we would have to wait either way. The hostess then noticed and told me \"I can't put your on the list until your whole party is here.\" (Pretentious much?) Just then, my friend showed up and we were told we would have to wait for like half an hour and they would text me when they were ready. It wasn't that long of wait, so we just stood outside to kill time. My friend swears that she noticed some people who were waiting after us were able to go in without having to wait because they looked like they were a part of the typical hipster crowd. Unverified, but I would believe this to be true because they probably think we're just two cheap Asians, which isn't a false assumption, but would be fucked up either way.\n\nThe place was had the standard hipster decor with the raw wood and metal...yadda, yadda, yadda. The beer bible was extensive, which was cool. I also appreciated the way they paired the dishes with certain drinks on their menu. My friend and I decided to order the Mushroom Buretta and the Daily Roast with the beer that would pair nicely with our meal. \n\n1. Beer: As someone who isn't a major fan of dark ales, I really enjoyed my drank, which came in a wine glass. (Ironic, right?) It had a slight caramel-y taste, which I had never experienced with beer before. \n\n2. Mushroom Buretta: It was basically a pile of mushrooms on top of a piece of thick toast with cheese, but it was delicious. The mushrooms were supple with a hint of sweet alcohol. But seriously, for 15 bucks, it should've been a loaf of bread.\n\n3. Daily Roast: A pork loin roast with some veggies on a bed of polenta. The meat was tender and sweet (like the perfect boyfriend). The polenta was smooth and creamy. We knew what were getting into for 25 bucks, but I was expecting more.\n\nThe bill totaled up to like $70, which was ridiculous considering it was really only the meal of one person (an appetizer and main course); had we gotten anything more, it would've been crazy expensive. It's like we paid that much money only to leave hungry. Granted, they are like a \"golden child\" in the whole hipster restaurant scene, maybe I'm just poor.

The duck was overdone, the kale had too much vinegar and it burned the back of my throat, causing me to cough after every bite. I wouldn't want to order it again simply because I don't want to risk the same thing happening.  Chocolate bread pudding - it was good, but nothing out of this world. Tasted a bit like chocolate Rice Krispies (which is good).

Its a total shame that my hubby didn't come with me, as he appreciates a good beer.  I found my glass of sparkling white wine perfect for early Happy Hour and even ordered ONE (1) fried oyster despite trying to save my appetite for MC because the menu description sounded so mouthwatering.

I can't even explain in coherent words how wonderful and tasty and fatty and comforting they are. I like their basic fresh ground burger - I think it is the combination of really great beef (cooked medium), and the aged white cheddar that makes it deliriously addictive. Combine that with super savory fries, it's a godsend of heartiness wrapped in comfort tied together with addiction. I know i sound dramatic but often people are when they are passionate about something. In this case, the great American love. And yeah, I think the simplest of things is also the hardest to achieve perfection. And the many times I have had this, it's been perfection. Never anything less than that.\n\nNow, about this eatery. Aside from my much loved burger, they also have a good sized menu with plated options like Sunday roast, steak, risotto, etc. They have a large selection of small bites that's perfect for accompanying with wine or beer. Speaking of alcohol, they carry a lot of it. A lot of craft beers (scotch ales), local and Belgium, and their staff is lovely enough to go through pairings with you when you order your food. In the wine department, there isn't a large selection but it's enough to give you plenty of options. \n\nThe restaurant itself is on the smaller side. They're more of a bar/pub than a restaurant but they have offerings of quality food alongside their drinks (hence gastropub), so it's really a place to check out if you're lurking around the Mission.", "author": "Jennifer N."}

The food however was quite disappointing and expensive for what it was. \n\nThe popular beef hash croquettes  with whipped bone marrow and aioli ($9) was SO bland! It only came with 3 pieces and we left one piece because it wasn't very good. My spent grain & chick pea burger ($14) was alright, the patty was big and the texture was soft and mushy. The best part of my meal was probably the hop salt fries. My friend's chicken sandwich was not bad either, the chicken was juicy but it had a charcoal-y taste to it. We all agreed that the regular ground beef burger was the best since it was moist and juicy and had an abundance of flavor (probably due to the bacon). However, it was $17 (extra $2 for bacon) for regular 'ol ground beef when I can get a truffle burger at Umami for 12 bucks...not exactly worth the price tag. We also tried the chocolate bread pudding and  I expected it to be much better. It didn't seem to have the same firm/dense texture as other bread puddings I've tried.

I don't normally like cooked oysters, but these were damn good - probably due to the relish type sauce that came on top. The breading wasn't too thick so the textures were good. We all agreed that the pretzel was probably the best pretzel any of us have ever had. It's shaped more like a roll than a traditional knot and comes with melty cheese and this absurdly good grainy mustard. Highly recommend both, but if you're gonna pick one go with the pretzel.\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared the burger and the duck leg confit. The burger was perfectly cooked and tasted great, but nothing particularly special. The fries are either too soft or too crispy - overall not very good.\n\nThe duck leg confit was soooo delicious.

Amazing food and the beer selection is fantastic. \n\nThere's not as many beers as Abbott's Cellar, just around the corner, but who cares! You don't need that much choice anyways! \n\nThe food is amazing.... There was 3 of us and we ordered the following: \n- Starters: Bone marrow on toast\n- Starters: Mussels\n- Mains: Burgers (x2 because they are THAT good)\n- Mains: Scallops\n\nThe Bone marrow is whipped so its basically like butter, DELICIOUS BUTTER!!! And they give you pop corn on top and underneath the toast so that you can dip it in the melted bone marrow and taste all the goodness and fat like you've never heard of Weight Watchers before.\n\nThe Mussels....did I mention they cook it with Allagash white? Yeah they do that. And of course so are the usual suspects... garlic, chili, green onions.  But they do something magical with it.  If Gandalf made mussels, this is how they would be.  They are juicy and comes right off the shell.  And they are all strangely immaculately clean with none of the usual gunk on the shells or around the mussels.  The sauce was salty like the taste of the sea, but amazingly flavorful the bread (and yes you will want more bread!) it comes with has the perfect blend of crunchy and sponginess which is prefect for dipping. \n\nBurgers, these babies are pretty darn good. Better than Umami, closest to LA's Father's office Burgers, (which are the god of all burgers IMO).  I don't like burgers, so when there is a burger I do like, its generally pretty daymn good.\n\nYour server may ask you \"Would you like to add Bacon on that?\" At which point, the only thing you should do is say \"HELL YES!\".  Yes, yes, you want bacon on that. \n\nThe Scallops...Before I give you the actual description of what they have on the menu.  Let me take you through what I think would be the thought process in coming up with this dish... \n\nWhat are the most amazing things you can thing of: \n- Scallops (yeah that's delicious)\n- Lobster (fuck yeah!)\n- Duck fat (Oh yeah....)\n- Potatoes (God's gifts to the Irish) \n\nOh and we need a vegetable of some sort.... cherry tomatoes\n\nOh and of course... BACON!\n\nPut this together and you get... \n\n\"Day Boat Scallops, Duck Fat Potatoes, Cherry Tomatoes, Lobster butter, Bacon.\"  That is the official description on the menu. 'Nuff said. \n\nWe didn't get desserts, at this point if we were to fill up with more awesome food, we would of exploded. \n\nMy only negative that I could think of was that for $26 there was only 5 scallops on the plate.  In hindsight that was more than enough to fill me up. But $26 for 5 scallops does seem a little pricey. \n\nWould I go back here? HELL YES! \n\nThough get in early, they are a small place, so if you want a table or there's more than 4 of you, plan ahead!", "author": "Maggie F."}

These two are basically interrelated if everyone drives separately and are competing against one another to find parking, but either way, you can't get seated until the whole party arrives... sudden epiphany huh?\n\nThe beer selection was extensive and the wine selection was equally impressive. A whole book was solely dedicated to wine and beer options. However, they do NOT sell any other drinks- no hard alcohol at all. Prices varied, but I'd highly recommend checking out the cost before ordering because some fell into double digits.\n\nIn regards to food, we ordered the hop salt fries and pretzels for appetizers. Fries were hot and fresh, but it wouldn't be a worthy pub to frequent if something as simple as fries aren't perfected. The pretzels (fist size- $5 for 1 or 2 for $9) were fresh and doughy, but I highly commend them for the dips (warm oozing cheesy dip and their house mustard dip were orgasmic).\n\nWe also had the croquettes (the lime aioli kind of threw us off with the fried goodness), potato corn chowder (standard, typical soup), and some beef entree (nothing really mind blowing, tasty, but not almost $30 amazing).\n\nOverall, a pleasant experience minus the wait time and endless search for parking.", "author": "Ada C."}

So take it to the professionals right? \n\nI asked the bartender for suggestions and he asked me the kind of beer I like. Now, I love dark beers, IPAs, lagers, you name it. After telling him the kind of beer I like, he not only suggested but simply said, \"nope, done. that's the beer you're going to get\" \n\nGave me this amazing beer called Pliney the Elder, which I would say is even better than Guinness (if you didn't know that Guinness was the one of the best beer, then well now you know). \n\n...he didn't stop there. We then got an Old Speckled Hen, which imo would probably be how a Guinness tastes if it was a Lager. \n\nAnyway, enough about the beers! We ordered fries, average kind of fries but delicious for munchies, bone marrow, and something shrimp (not important!) The bone marrow was delicious and something I wouldn't have thought of trying. Buttery like taste and they serve it with popcorn. \n\nOverall, this place gets all 5 because of their amazing selection of beer, variety of foods, but most importantly the bartender.

I came here to meet fellow Yelper Angella S to celebrate her birthday, and was able to arrive early to walk around the block which eventually led me to this restaurant. The small interior was dark, intimate, with dim lighting and people bustling everywhere. The Lakers game was on, and the combination of an impressive beer listing and trendy atmosphere was a big draw for this high end bar which also carried an enticing menu for it to be considered a bistro.\n\nWhile I waited for a table, the door man was friendly and knowledgeable about their dishes to make a few suggestions. We shared a Special Salad ($10.50) which came with mixed greens deliciously tossed with goat cheese and soft peaches with light vinaigrette dressing and a splash of champagne. It was the perfect starter followed by my entr\u00e9e, the Seared Ahi Sandwich ($16.50) which was prepared with thick, sashimi grade ahi coated with sesame seeds pan seared on the outside and rare at the center. The sandwich was stacked with sweet wasabi-soy aioli with a soft kick and tiny pieces of pickled ginger and daikon sprouts served on a soft French roll. The combination of salad and sandwich was very good, but I wished the bread could be served warm to make it more appropriate as a dinner item. \n\nMy dish also came with skinny fries, and by special request, came with chipotle ketchup, herbed aioli, and curry aioli for rounds of good dippin' (75 cents). The sauces were delightfully tasty as the chipotle ketchup and curry aioli were my favorites. Overall, the price was steep but in exchange the sizable ahi and a respectable level of sophistication in ways the food was conceptualized and executed made it worthwhile. It was certainly not your typical bar food and my glass of Belgian style Sumpin' Wild ($4.25) was good.\n\nOur server, Zwingle, was decent and mildly friendly. It was not the most attentive service but the atmosphere was appropriate for the occasion while we stayed for quite a while without feeling rushed. Due to the size of the bistro, I think two noteworthy limitations would be their strict seating policies, which could be a turn off for some, and they also have a hefty cake cutting fee which I considered lame. 3.5 stars for the overall experience.

This was paired w/ some Scottish Ale (I forget the name) that brought out the caramel & woodsiness of the dish\n\nVeggie Burger is made from the very same Spent grain that they use for the \"Death & Taxes\" beer that is a recommended pairing & it was exceptional - the burger was firm yet full of texture w/ those grains & chick peas all combined into burger deliciousness\n\nBuddy #1 chose Steak & Braised Greens - super delish but super-small - the meat was cooked perfectly & the greens not too mushy.  She had chosen a porter to start & kept it for her dish as well - while she really liked the porter, she thinks she'll definitely have the experts choose next time\n\nChocolate Stout Bread Pudding - OMG was this tasty!  BF & I shared, Buddy #1 got her own.....I secretly wished I had got my own too it was so good!  Light chocolate flavor w/ an earthy tone - very custardy & pudding-like\n\nThe beer list here is completely overwhelming & we have every intention of trying out every one.....I see a lot of Monk's Kettle in my future!", "author": "Adrienne G."}

I came here for the first time with a friend who has been here before, and fortunately it wasn't too busy. They told us 25 minutes for a table, but we immediately found seating at the bar and decided just to eat there. \n\nThe beer was excellent and we each got a bone marrow \"canoe\" as an appetizer. It was served with popcorn that was drenched in the marrow, and it was amazing. I literally licked the bone clean. The french fries came hot and were pretty good. The main course we shared the roast of the day which was braised brisket with polenta and vegetables, and it was good, but not noteworthy. \n\nWhat stood out most in my mind was the service. Of the 4-5 employees we interacted with, they were all genuinely nice, friendly, sincere and helpful and seemed genuinely pleased to help us make our beer selections or discuss the food. It made me feel welcome and at home, and I will certainly go back.", "author": "Jordan C."}

Finally went on the Thursday before MLK around 8pm and lucked out by getting seated in a booth immediately! Be warned that this place is fairly small and usually busy so generally you are going to have to wait. Also note that they always ask if you are eating dinner or just drinking, I believe this is because the booths are reserved for dinner customers.\n\nThey have a fairly small menu of mostly upscale Belgian-inspired food and a BIG beer menu. Note that the imported bottled stuff tends to be more expensive here than the same beer at other places. For example my Tripel Karmeliet 330ml was $14.75! But hey, at least they _have_ Tripel Karmeliet.\n\nOther than the awesome beer, I've been excited to try this place because of all the great things I've heard about their burger. It definitely lived up to expectations for me. It was perfectly cooked and extremely delicious! I usually only get bacon on a burger if it comes by default (trust the chef) but I'd heard people recommend getting it here so I opted for the optional bacon and was not disappointed, I would definitely recommend getting it. This burger definitely ranks up there with NOPA and Zazie for me as my favorite burgers in the city so far.\n\nAlso tried the fried oyster appetizer which was decent, but not mind blowing. Be warned that the dish is _one_ fried oyster, though our waiter was nice enough to warn us of this fact and ask how many we wanted to order.\n\nThe pretzel knot appetizer on the other hand was a definite win. It seemed like it came right out of the oven with a super soft and fluffy inside and perfectly crisp on the outside. It comes with stone ground mustard and cheese fondue dipping sauces.\n\nOur waiter apparently forgot to put in our appetizer order, but when asked about them as our main dishes came he apologized profusely, rushed them out and didn't charge us for them which was great! It's goes to show that giving a little bit extra on customer service can really make sure your customers enjoy their experience even when things go wrong.\n\nAlso props to them for leaving a large pitcher of water on the table as well, I always hate having to wait for the waiter to come by and re-fill my glass.\n\nOverall a great experience, I'll definitely be back for more awesome Belgian beer and the delicious burger.", "author": "Ely L."}

The food in the pictures on Yelp definitely won me over. But after circling around for 15 mins looking for parking and finding out those dishes weren't served anymore because they changed chefs, I was already disappointed. Luckily, we didn't have to wait in line, we grabbed the second to last table. But if we didn't get it, it would have been a 1-1.5 hr wait.\n\nThis is a great place if you like beer (it is a gastropub). They have a huge selection of beers and prices are just as various, from your normal $5 to $20+ beers. The beer menu can be overwhelming and it's a definite WOW factor, both because of the selection and prices on some of them.\n\nThey also serve food. Their menu is short and simple. What we ordered:\n1. the pretzel knots (2 for $9 or 1 for $5)- if you look in the pictures, they're pretty small in size (especially for $5 each) I will admit they were good. Nice crunchy exterior, nice and fluffy in the middle. The dijon and cheese sauce were really good. I still thought I overpaid for the pretzel knots however.\n2. Potato crown beef croquettes- the description sounded delicious, but I was unimpressed. I couldn't taste much of the corned beef. The texture was very nice, the mashed potatoes were very smooth and creamy. I didn't think the aioli complimented the croquettes very well, I would have preferred it without the lemon aioli.\n3. Soup of the day- it was chicken corn chowder that day, pretty good.\n4. Steak- it was good, it had a nice char to it and you can taste a smoky on the outside. However $25 for a few slices of steak. I rather spend that money towards House of Prime Rib if you know what I mean.\n5. Fries- tasted like your ordinary french fries, the hop salt didn't stand out to me, but it sure made it sound fancy.\n\nOverall, I might come back just for beer. I'll pass on the food. I definitely would NOT wait an hr or more for a table (which is typical on a Friday or Saturday night).\n\nPS. They also won't seat you until your entire party is there. So make sure everyone is on time or you guys ride together. It's first come first serve for tables for entire parties.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

We were lucky to nab a table without any wait, however the bar was completely packed.

An interesting combo of flavors that I hadn't seen before. The crisp greens and sweet fruit complimented the rich flavors of duck, delicious!

It's catchy cool and should be the name of a hit Katy Perry song. Hey, could be worse...I'm looking at you Billy Joel.\n\nMy only mistake, I fell victim to a passing burger. I slipped right past our table and landed graciously a few chairs down from me. I had every intention of stepping out of my comfort zone and try anything but the burger. But it just looked to darn good to pass up. \n\nAnyway.....I did get to sample a few other food things.\n\nThe pretzel. Are you kidding me? It's out of this world! And I am an expert on all things carbs. The pretzel came with two different kinds of mustard, but delicious and the pretzel itself was the perfect texture, MUAH! It's as good as you will find back the Hofbrauhaus...and no, I don't mean the fake one in Las Vegas, I mean the actual real Hofbrauhaus back in Munch. If you've been you will know exactly what I am talking about.\n\nThe fried oysters were dangerously delicious. Deep fried to a golden brown with a nice crisp. But as mentioned, fried, so you do realize you are asking for a serious heart attack. Hey it's worth playing food roulette with you life!\n\nNow for the burger. Yes, this burger may be the most underrated burger in all of San Francisco. Cooked perfectly to medium rare, the grass fed beef was absolutely mouth watering. The patty was topped with a slice of sharp white cheddar cheese which I must find out where they scored this wonderful dairy product.\n\nThe fries, oh boy! The fries! Just another awesome Monk's creation. If unicorns could make fries, it would be these. No garlic or parmesan toppings. Just perfectly crafted fried potatoes.\n\nSave room for dessert and keep your fingers crossed for the pecan tart. Pair it with a zingy zinfandel and your night will come to the perfect conclusion. \n\nThe one appetizer I wish we had ordered but didm't? Corned beef hash croquettes. How good does that sound!?\n\nThe service was spot on and friendly. I like when the waitstaff have strong opinions on both wine and beer.

Monk's Kettle was something special, especially at its location. Surrounded by bars and pubs, the exciting night life, Monk's Kettle settled on a cozy corner providing all its patrons with the best of over 200 beers. They have the most epic encyclopedia of beers, from the light to the red. The foreign to the home state to the fruity and the bitter. It is quite an experience to be there and indulge into a lesson of good beer and hold to savory the peculiar taste of beer. \n\nThere's limited tables and bar seating, so expect a wait if you come at the wrong time. I opted to walk in around 1200am, beating last call at 145pm. Showed id at the door, and settled into a corner for four. The interior was warm and welcoming and everybody seemed to be enjoying themselves. The relaxed environment was a different switch from the bar scene, where it was obscene noises and drunks was a good change. \n\nI don't even enjoy beer, let alone know anything about what to order. And that's when the wonderful staff came in and the waiter invited himself to our table and began building an individualize beer for each and every one of us. But before that, the bar treated us to a couple of dark ales, foams and belgiums to kick our night off. Each one of us describe what sort of drinks we do enjoy, then crafted and formulated what beers that they offered would be right for us. When the beer came, it was completely on point and it blew my mind. Never did I imagine I would enjoy beer like a regular, but certainly a first time for everything and always time to change my mind. \n\nI find myself having a high tolerance for liquor, but I wasn't ready for the high concentration in these specialized beers, especially the foam. God, the foam topped off the drink and it was delicious. Foamy and thick, giving myself a mustache with the warm beer oozing between my lips. So don't drink and drive, a couple of beers with get you going really quick. \n\nThey offer a short, but elegant menu to be paired with their beers. A real hit were their side of fries, the black muscles (which were HUGE but a lot of the dish were just shells and not so much meat), the pretzel with the fondu (expect the one we had were smaller than yelp pictures, like the size of my fist rather than my entire hand) and the bone marrow was something out of this world! \n\nOn with the service. On with the beers. On with the food. This is the place to come with hitting the 16th and Mission because there's no other like it out here.

I said, yea but it would be much nicer to be able to talk to each other and more suitable for 4 people, where as a couple can still easily chat at a bar....\n\nLogic was not his strong suit and he just started acting like a typical power trip bouncer.   \n\nI almost left right away but decided the food and drink would be good and just deal.  We eventually Sat at the main bar after 20 minute wait during which time a table of four opened up where he moved a couple from the bar to this table...

After hearing about Monks as a top beer drinking spot, I must say I was let down--big time!\n\nI've been drinking beer for over 20 years. I've seen and experienced the evolution of the beer industry over time. Maybe my expectations were too high for such an establishment. \n\nThey had a fun-funky-little vibe for sure. As we walked-in, I think we were greeted by Jesus Christ himself (or at least a descendant) so that scored points with me--just purely for visual effect. The bartender was solid. Her recommendations weren't always on point but she was motivated and showed good passion for what she does.\n\nI love a good IPA--the dankier the better! They had pages of beers to choose from but the one I wanted (Pliny the Elder) was not on tap. Shitty, considering the menu said it was last updated 7/25--the same day as my visit. \n\nSo, I took a canned beer because apparently it was \"Sour Hour\" and they wanted everyone to drink their shitty sour beers (can you tell I'm not a big fan).\n\nNot to be shaken, I trudged forward and asked for a few tasters. She gave me the Alagash (that I really liked) and a few others (that I didn't). \n\nFor my second beer, I asked for an Alagash (that originally I saw came out of a tap right in front of me). A few minutes later, this guy comes from the back with a glass filled with bubbly/light beer. Looks good, I'm pretty sure it's what I ordered but sure as shit--no! I swear to this day it was a Hoegarden!\n\nNow, I'm a fan of Hoegarden but that's not what I ordered. At this point, I'm taken offense to the fact that they're playin' me like a little bitch.\n\nAs a true beer aficionado, I know better. I just don't think they knew me. I had never been there before but in reality I'm a 41 year old man who'd been around the block many more times than these youngens' behind the bar.\n\nYou'll be happy to know that I didn't say anything. I was having too much fun with my 21 year old son (one of our first drinks together in a bar ever). There was not way I was ruining that moment over something pesky like this.\n\nI did however feel compelled to leave a note about my experience here on Yelp. Monks is not a legit establishment. They do not deserve to be published as a top beer drinking spot in The City. \n\nSure, they have lot's of beers (something like 200+) but they want to serve you want they want to serve. I'd rather go to a place that has just a few good one's, but yet I can really count on them to serve me what I order. \n\nSo, if you're looking for 200 beers of bullshit--go for it! If you really know your beer and you like the beer you drink--go somewhere you can rely on delivering the goods. And, if you're not familiar, you can do better.", "author": "G L."}

I walked into Monk's Kettle not knowing they checked I.D.'s and was quickly yelled at by the hostess/bouncer - not sure if she was one or the other but seemed like the latter assuming a host would've properly walked up to me instead of hollering.\n\nWe were sat quickly and the waiter was very patient with us. All 3 of us that sat at one table ordered beer that he recommended. We also ordered the warm pretzel that came with two types of mustards as a starter. I had the steamed mussels and the blanche de bruxelles that complimented the shellfish quite well. All of the items had layers of flavors and it wasn't just your average \"bar food\"-esque type of deal. \n\nOverall, very happy with the Monks Kettle and would recommend it to others; it's a great place to learn about beers.

The three day ale bricked chicken with cranberry beans, and harissa was very juicy and great flavor, a dish I would definitely order again.\n\nThis is definitely a great place for lunch (early or late) and dinner.

At first I thought it was just an honest mistake when the bartender asked me to repeat my order. (To be fair, this place featured a loud and lively crowd with romantic dim light settings so it's completely understandable that she didn't hear me properly). However, upon my second attempt, I excitedly and confidently restated my order, (this time in a much larger voice, hoping she could understand me better second time around) asked for \"The Wehvwend\" and again results came back negative. She didn't understand me and she said that they simply didn't carry it. \n\nFor those of you who don't know, \"The Wehvwend\" is this amazing Belgian Style Quadruple Ale, 10% ABV, Brewed by the Avery Brewing Company somewhere in Colorado, USA. A divinely complex and beautifully layered beer with hints of dark cherries, currants, and molasses, complimented by an underlying spiciness. Sinfully smooth considering the high alcohol content.  \n\nLong Story Short: I was really excited at first, then I was a slightly disappointed, then I was really happy again later because my date had such a great time. She was giggling at something while I was ordering, I'm not sure at what, but bottom line was that she was happy and I'm still real glad that I took her there.

I was fortunate enough to get a spot at the bar and bellied up.  I ordered an oyster as an appetizer and the draft meister said a person who got the oysters recently found a pearl in it.  Good tip as I definitely didn't want to chop down on a pearl.  The cornmeal fried oyster was tasty enough and I regretted my decision when the guy next to me got a burger.  It looked amazing.  Oh well next time.  I knew if I got a burger I would be there a little longer and the parking meter in my head was a'ticking.  The meter maids were getting after expired meters pretty aggressively so I knew I needed to have only a couple selections and sprint back to my meter to feed it.  I'll BART it next time.\n\nThey have a decent sized bar with seating all around and they have a secondary seating area (bar-type) a little further back into the restaurant.  There are a few booths which seemed to be pretty popular and there were a few small tables sprinkled through the place.  Their beer selections were impressive.  They have a number of beers on tap and have a good sized book with their bottled offerings.\n\nMy first beer was Obedience Training by Moonlight Brewing.  It was a nice Brown Ale dark in color and nutty in flavor.  The 2nd selection was a beer I've had before but never on tap-- North Coast Old Stock Ale.  It's classified as an old ale and has a very unique taste.  I have enjoyed this beer in bottle form but I think I've been drinking it a little too cold.  I had this beer on tap and almost started crying it was so good.  There were so many nuances of flavor in this beer that I had not noticed before.  The flavor lingered in my mouth and was wonderful.  It was full of caramel richness with a little carbonation and a slight bitter finish.  Yum.  I'll have to make a trek up to their brewery sometime this year.  I truly enjoyed this beer on tap but it packs a punch at almost 12%.\n\nBy the time I finished my oyster and 2 beers I knew my meter was still ticking away so I decided to cash out.  It had gotten pretty crowded in there too.  The bathroom was a unisex and I hate those.  It's the only thing I really didn't like about Monk's Kettle so I can't really give it 5 stars.

They have about 30 beers on draft, and a whole BOOK of bottled beers that they carry. \n\nWe got here around 7 on a Monday, and there was a 45min-hour wait for 3 people.

Based on that, he gave me two tastings, one of which I really liked it. It was the St. Bernardus Abt, which is a quadruple, I guess a type. It was delicious!! \n\nTo eat I ordered the chicken sandwich, so so good. The bacon jam is amazing.\n\nMy friends ordered several different beers, all that they liked.

The meat practically melted in my mouth, and we paired it with a sour-style beer that really brought the dish together. \n\nThe servers were not pretentious at all, which I had feared a little bit since the beer menu is SO extensive, but we also ordered a pilsner and a hef to share and were really pleased with both.\n\nThe tables are really close together, so be wary of that, but the couple seated next to us did share their cheese plate, so no complaints from me!", "author": "Laura H."}

Being an old fart, I tend to shy away from social media as much as possible.  Monk's Kettle brought me out of my shell, for just a moment, to share with the world the awesomeness of the scallops.  Day boat scallops.  With lobster butter. Duck fat fried potatoes.  I think maybe an heirloom cherry tomato or two might have fallen in there, but hard to be sure. Oh yes.  And there was bacon. Muahahahahaha.  Oh yessss. There was bacon, alright.\n\nThat being said, we just came in for some drinks and a bite.  So the only other dish ordered was the daily pickle jar.  Since my fam is originally from Eastern Europe, I would like to think I know a thing or two about pickled...well, pickled everything.  I ate pickled things growing up that still haven't made it to a Portlandia skit.  These were \"aiight\", but nothing to write home to Mother Russia about.  The brine was too sweet for my taste, and sadly much of the contents of the jar remained uneaten.  And I don't like to waste food.  Ever.  Commie lessons die hard.\n\nI'm sure I had this coming, but I had a case of the sniffles and opted for a hot tea instead of a beer.  I know, I knoooooow.  I should be ordering a fancy something beer to keep my cool kid card. I thought though, no, let's try a tea.  I asked how the lemongrass tea was, and the server scoffed when \"tea\" was uttered after \"lemongrass.\"  \"Ohhhhh, I thought you were going to ask how the Lemongrass Saison was.  Which, is amazing.  The tea, well.  It's tea.  It's nice.\"  THANKS for that insightful comment.  Guess what uppity server lady?  The tea was DELIGHTFUL.  Thank you very much.  \n\nStill giving 4 stars for dimly lit and log-house chic geometric reclaimed wood art (yes, I looked up the artist and yes, I will probably buy some of her work) ambience, and the delicious scallops, just overall atmosphere.

I am not exactly a beer connoisseur, so I didn't know exactly what to get and didn't want to just take a chance at a bad tasting beer for that amount of money.

That said, I stuck with draft, and their taps are well beyond respectable for breadth and quality; I had an Old Speckled Hen on nitro.\n\nThen came the food.  I started with the old-school pretzel knot, which unsurprisingly came out fresh and hot and light, accompanied by a grain mustard and a mild cheddar fondue. It's on the large side, so share it out unless you skipped lunch.\n\nMy salad, the local greens, cheese, hazelnuts, and currants was also a portion large enough for a light meal in itself.  This sort of salad, with the contrasting C-textures (crisp, creamy, crunchy, chewy) and flavors is always going to win with me.  \n\nFor the main I went with the potentially least-interesting thing on the mains menu: the grilled chicken sandwich.  TMK shows you that this often derided sandwich is still a viable dinner when the chicken is cooked skillfully, the bread selected with care, and the fixins appropriately balanced.  This is a grilled chicken sandwich that will change your opinion of grilled chicken sandwiches. \n\nTable seating is limited, but the bar is more than comfortable.", "author": "Josh M."}

It's cramping my style. It can really be a 2hr+ wait sometimes, but 100% worth your time. Go to Dalva and have a grapefruit soda or 2 (you will think me) at the Hideout in the back and time will pass more quickly ; )\n\nThe pretzel with creamy cheese is delicious (of course). The real show stopper is the burger. Oh my god. Just get the burger. Do it. It's juicy in the middle, with lightly caramelized pieces on the outside and the meat is seasoned so well is practically magic. It's mind blowing how they can pack so much delicious flavor into a burger patty, and not just salty flavor...a complex blend of very different flavors that make your taste buds sing.\n\nThe daily roast is out of this world too. I had the short ribs over mashed potatoes once. I was raving about how it was one of the best dishes I've had in SF...then my boyfriend started eating his first Monk's burger. He's not even a foodie at all, but he is a burger expert and he almost lost his mind eating this burger. He was literally moaning with every bite and looked so happy he looked like he was about to cry. He made it look so unbelievable I just wanted to drop my fork and launch across the table to steal his burger for myself. In the end, he finally came back to his senses and let me have a bite. Now I only order the burger so that I don't have the urge to steal his meal throughout our entire dinner.\n\nThe beer selection is like the menu at the cheese cake factory, but in a good way. It even has a glossary in the back, which is amazingly helpful especially for a wine drinker like me. This has to be the best beer list in the city. They have such cool beer that even I drink beer here. I don't even usually drink beer, so this is a big deal. Try some sour beer on your beer-venture here...it's crazy good. They also have the best glassware I've seen anywhere in San Francisco. Like one million different glasses for the different beer selections. \n\nIn summary, go get the burger.

I pulled out my Yelp app and found The Monk's Kettle within a few blocks of us, so we headed straight for it. When we arrived on a Monday afternoon, it was a packed house. There did not appear to be any available tables or bar stools for the two of us. We soon spotted a rather large table empty by the bar and as a server passed, we inquired about the table. At first he hesitated to give it to us, but we assured him we would be good customers. I am not sure what the seating system is, but a hostess or a sign would be appreciated. We pulled off our jackets and dived into the beer list.\n\nIt was the tail end of SF beer week that day, so there were some fun things on tap. I started with a Rodenbach Grand Cru, a Flanders sour ale. I also had the short ribs that day, with potatoes and roasted vegetables. It was the perfect warm, hearty meal to stand up the bold flavors of my sour. My husband had the daily roast, which was pork osso bucco and he quickly cleared his plate and declared it \"amazing\". \n\nThe vintage bottle list, which are purchased to go, was very impressive.

Yes, we hungrily waited a combined hour-something for one of our friends to show up then for a table to open, but we all agreed it was worth it.\n\nDelicious entrees were had at our table, but what riled us up most were the appetizers. All I can say is, \"Bone Marrow Boat\" - if you haven't tried it, get it. If you're vegetarian or vegan or vegemite, bring a carnivorous friend so they can get it. It's a thick cross-sectioned bone with the marrow and fat soft, warm, and partway liquefied. It comes with little bread dippers and it's indulgent.\n\n\"Pickle Jar\" was pretty funky, in that SF bohemian baja patchouli way. Maybe minus the patchouli though, but put the hood up on your baja. It wasn't just \"pickles\" like fermented cucumbers. It was parts of cucumber, carrot, cauliflower, string bean, olive, and basically whatever. It also wasn't just \"pickles\" like sour cucumbers. It was definitely sourish or somewhat fermented, but each kind of vegetable carried a sweetness through the pickleness. We supposed this to be due to a more natural preparation process than that of supermarket pickles. This dish took each of us by surprise in appreciated and not so appreciated ways.\n\n\"Chicken Paillard\", whatever that means, came with bacon jam. Bacon jam is the type of thing you'd want on the side with any and every food, atop your dessert, and swished into your beer - it's that crazy and it's that good, judging by the reactions of those at the table who got the jean-luc paillard. We asked the waiter and learned that there have been staff meetings about whether or not to let bacon jam be an independent and requestable condiment. As their collective decision stands, bacon jam is exclusively featured pre-applied exclusively to the paillard.\n\nBeers, beers, beers, hundreds and hundreds of beers. Among our rich selection was \"1/2 Idjit\" from Sweden. If you're nostalgic for the 80's... denim, synthesizers, big hair, over-accessorizing, Jordache, large hair, neon, cartoons, huge hair... if your heart beats for this stuff, 1/2 Idjit's your co-pilot because it tastes like straight-up Aqua Net. Remember that hairspray? That's this beer. Not that I've ever ingested hairspray, but the cloud of smell that envelops you when you're putting your hair on freeze tag notice smells 100% how this beer tastes.\n\nLoved the staff. Totally nice, considerate of food allergies & preferences, deeply knowledgeable of the beverages, professional at pouring the beers, and our main waiter had the same name as my brother. In fact, I'd say the staff can be a little TOO good. My friends and I eat slowly anyway because we're mostly talking and laughing and taking photos. But as we got on into the appetizers, we kept wondering why the other stuff we ordered wasn't showing up. After a while, we asked and found out that our waiter had \"coursed out\" our items, meaning that entrees arrive once appetizers are finished, and so on through further courses. It's cool that in a Mission restaurant with a skinny jeans Am Appy dude at the door and fixies walking by outside that we'd get such thoughtfully polished service. But you know what? Just give us the food - pile it up on our table and clutter the place with everything because we're just hungry and we want to eat.\n\nThis place also has a small wall of chalkboard along the rear counter seating.

Especially when the grilled chicken is sort of dry, and the two pieces of stale tasting sandwich bread are each 1-inch thick while the chicken and small portion of toppings/condiments totaled 3/4-inch.  My mouth couldn't generate enough saliva to break down that food!  Too bad because the bacon jam and mustard were a nice complement to the chicken, there just wasn't enough.  My date's dish was no better - the veggie burger was bland and also proportionately lacking in condiments.  He took about 4 bites and didn't even take the leftovers to go!  The side of fries were pretty good initially but over-salted, therefore contributing further to my dry mouth.  The much raved about pretzel bun was.... just a pretzel bun.  I cannot begin to understand why are people obsessed with it.\n\nOh yeah, and the beer...  While Monk's Kettle has a great selection, I still prefer City Beer and Toronado.  I mean, the same pint of Pliny at Toronado costs $6 while Monk's Kettle charges $8... not cool.", "author": "Beatrice W."}

So what did I do to up my hipster cred?  Naturally, I sabotaged myself and took my mama here for lunch.\n\nAnd man, does any other place live up to it's hype the way these guys do?\n\nLet's start with the beer selection.  Obviously, it's incredible.  It is both ginormous and impeccably and carefully curated, with bartenders and servers who know each beer passionately.  The food, however, was a 10 on its own.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich with mustard-BBQ sauce, bacon jam, and some other shenanigans that I'm too lazy to look up, served with the hop salt fries.  Unreal.  This was one of the tastiest things I've had in years.  Paired with a Pliny the Elder, this was maybe the best lunch I've had since I've moved to the city.  Mama S had a chickpea burger that she similarly declared as incomparable, and is already planning her next trip back (paired it with a chocolate-y stout or something, I was geeking out over Pliny and didn't really notice).\n\nBottom line, this is a phenomenal place to stop by for lunch or dinner.  Weekday lunch had no wait, but perpetually long lines for dinner.  Always easy to grab a seat at the bar if you can wait around for ten minutes max, and as a bonus, you can play hangman on the chalkboard.", "author": "James S."}

I've never been to Monk's Kettle so I'm not sure how they regularly handle business. \n\nI waited for an hour outside waiting to get a chance to try some of the special sour beers. As people waited in line an employee came out and asked people if they were interested in eating or just drinking. People that requested to be seated for eating were seated before me because those seats opened up faster than the stools at the bar. A friend of mine joined me and he waited about 30 minutes with me before we got in. Unfortunately he had to leave and meet some people for a birthday party but another friend of mine was joining me. The staff would not let my other friend come in and join me as my other friend left. We couldn't just switch out one person for another even though I waited an hour and other people got to go in before me. The rigidity of the policy didn't really make sense to me. Two people waited to go in to drink for the special event that they were hosting and other people waited less time and got to go in before but I couldn't have a friend join me as another friend left. I feel that if you're hosting a special event you should make accommodations to serve those people that are there for your event. \n\nI was very frustrated and disappointed that my first experience didn't meet my expectation. \n\nThe server was very friendly and gave us a great recommendation for a beer to try. Unfortunately I couldn't stay long since my other friend was waiting for me outside since the staff wouldn't let her in. I finished the beer, paid and left. Despite the delicious beer, I left with an unpleasant taste. \n\nWe ended up bar hopping and enjoying other beer week specials at various bars that didn't have strange policies.", "author": "Daisy S."}

Too many that their menu is like the bible.   In enjoying the last days of summer, I settled on the Pliny the Elder IPA.  It was fruity, sweet, and refreshing.  It paired well with the tri tip steak that I ordered for may meal.   The steak was seasoned well and cook medium rare.  No complaints on the meat just the sides that accompanied it. The sweet potatoes were limp and the vegetable on the salty side.   \n\nWe also ordered the bone marrow as a starter.  Ordering one bone, it was larger than what I expected.   I love bone marrow anything. [Bone marrow = gold) But this one I found the execution and taste lacking. Taste wise, it could have used more salt.

I've tried to come for drinks on a weeknight at least 4 times, but the place is always jam packed and I inevitably end up at Kilowatt or Gestault instead. I assumed that my attempt to have a beer last night would end up in the same disappointing trudge down 16th to another establishment, but to my surprise, my date was able to snag us the high table by the door!! Surprisingly, it's protected from the wind and not at all a cold place to sit. \n\nBoy was I wrong about the Monk's Kettle. It's awesome! Pricey and overcrowded, but their encyclopedia of beers and the extensive knowledge of their bartenders makes it worth it. \n\nI tend to like dark, flavorful beer, but not bitter or chocolaty. Unfortunately, I don't know what beers fit into that category, so when I opened the beer menu, I was immediately overwhelmed by options. For those of you like me, don't worry, the bartenders here are AAHHMAZING. I described the type of beer I like and he immediately started flipping through the menu pointing out beers that fit my taste palate. \n\nI ended up getting:\n+ Aventinus ($11.75) - a German Weizenbock (8.20% ABV) that was SO good. After pouring most of the beer, our bartender began to swirl and tap the bottle to get all the yeast off the bottom and into my glass. I had seen this before, but never knew why it was done, so he graciously explained the process.\n+ Pauwel Kwak ($12.50) - a Belgian Pale Ale (8.4% ABV) that was also great, though I preferred the Aventinus. This came in an hour-glass shaped glass which was held upright by a wooden stand. Our bartender made sure to explain that this presentation is an artifact of horse-drawn carriage days when the men needed a place to set down their beers while in the carriage.\n\nNote that NOT all beers are this expensive.  The Draft Sea Monster Imperial Stout also has a high ABV, but was only $4.25. I don't believe that prices are listed on the menu, so if you care, you might have to ask. Don't quote me on that though.\n\nOverall, a very educational and delicious evening of beer.

If you are in the mood for very good quality food and expensive beer, with a side of noise and a crowd on a Saturday night, this is the place for you!\n\nVery friendly service dominates this rather small place. But the prices here for the great food will set you back quite a bit. Here's an unvarnished view of what you can expect here:\n\nWe four had the following:\n\nTwo Winter lettuce Salads, white balsamic roasted pear, toasted pecans $9 ea.\n\nTwo Fresh ground burgers with onion jam, aged white cheddar, acme pain de mie, regular fries $13 ea. One added the house-cured pepper bacon (two slices) for $2.\n\nOne spent grain and chick pea burger, fromage blanc, onion jam, acme pan de mie, fries $12\n\nTwo bottles of Belgian Tripel Karmeliet $14.75 ea. (these were 12 oz bottles! So good though -- a \"Blond, robust, smooth, and fruity three-grain top fermented beer, refermented in the bottle. Brewed...after Karmeliet tradition with wheat, oat and barley. 100% natural. Has been brewed at Van Steenberge for Brewery Bosteels for some time until recently.\")\n\nOne hot Apple Cobbler in a small pan with melting ice cream: $8\n\nOne stout brown Chocolate Bread Pudding with vanilla ice cream: $8\n\nVerdict: almost everything was excellent. The only miss were the rather ordinary french fries were good but far from anything Belgium, not even served with a Belgian style dipping sauce.\n\nA full side order of these MacDonald's-like fries was $6; so very overpriced, and we thankfully did not order one. The Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia http://www.yelp.com/biz/monks-cafe-philadelphia#query:The%20Monk%27s%20Inn  had all the beers AND the authentic Belgian frites to prove it, while not overcharging. \n\nTotal: $112.30 with tax. Add a tip and you are well over $65 per couple. This quality of food (locally sourced, organic, etc), while appreciated, was not worth this cost on its face, but if you account for $15 for each bill was just the bottle of beer (net: $50) this might be on the moderate cost size.\n\nSummarizing: two beef burgers, one veggie burger, two moderately sized salads, two beers, two deserts (each split) for over $110. Certainly a splurge; order a domestic beer Belgian-style (there are many MANY choices) and you could save some. But this place is renown for its beers, so why not try one?\n\nWould I return? Maybe because the food (especially surprising was the very delicious the Spent Grain Burger) was really terrific. But will do so with a much bigger budget in mind.", "author": "Glenn H."}

Fair enough! And the culinary nudge turned out to be welcome, as we ordered the charcuterie and cheese plate which happened to have thoughtful selections including a lovely little Cowgirl Creamery Devil's Gulch with the hintiest of chile pepper on the rind, and generous swathes of preserves and mustard swirled across the serving board.\n\nA nice selection of beers appears in the binder (though most of the space is reserved for an extensive bottle list); about twenty taps, both domestic and international, with strong West Coast representation heavy on the Belgians. Lost Abbey appeared a couple of times, and the Devotion was my favorite pour of the night (after, of course, the Moebius). I also enjoyed Linden Street's The Resistor, as I'm always happy to get acquainted with local brews when I'm out of town, ones I probably wouldn't ever see in bottles at home. \n\nDrinks here aren't cheap...but the quality's excellent.

Bottles are marked up between 200-300% of the retail prices.\n\nExample 1: The 2007 Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien was $17.75 for a 6oz pour. The retail price of a 22oz bottle is around $25-$30 (http://www.wineandcheeseplace.com/cart.php?target=product&product_id=6658&category_id=4)\n\nExample 2: Bottle of New Belgium La Folie 22oz (retail $11.99 at WF) was roughly $30\n\nExample 3: Pliny the Elder 16oz draught is $7.75. Most other bars have it for $5-$6\n\nExample 4: Alesmith Speedyway Stout 22oz (retail $13.99 at WF) was $31.50\n\nI understand that Monk's is a much classier environment to be drinking beer at than a regular bar, but with the classy comes the huge bill. As a beer lover, I'm a little adverse to this- I started liking beer because it was cheaper than wine and much more approachable, less snobby- beer bars and their staff and clientele are generally much more relaxed and easy going. Monk's is a great place, but its definitely upping the snob/price factor of beer culture and I honestly would rather spend time at a beer bar (Sycamore!) chatting with the bartenders about brewing or what their favorite local porter is.\n\nAnyways, I guess it would be up to you to decide if you wanted to pay more than double the price on a bottle you can grab at the Whole Foods in Potrero after you leave. I, for one, am probably not going to be back too often.", "author": "Emily H."}

What sets this place apart from other places is the balanced approach to beer + food.  Other gastro pubs usually do one better than the other, but this place does both exceptionally well.\n\nThe draught beer selection favors smaller breweries, many from CA (San Diego to Russian River to Humboldt), though Europe and other parts of the country are also very well represented (there is a beer menu as is customary for gastro pubs these days).\n\nThe pretzel bread is a great starter as are pickles.  The burger and the risotto are also two staples that go well with the brew.  I liked the tuna as well, but my personal favorite is the veggie burger, which is the best I've had.\n\nThe final touch is the specials.  There is usually a special entree daily, and the meats (roasts) are almost always top notch with some creative combinations.\n\nBottom line: Nice staff, good food, great beer.", "author": "Vadim A."}

But, on one fateful Sunday, I was famished, cranky and in need of a beer. I decided to meet a friend at TMK and get some grub and booze. Dear readers, this is the point at which you should probably be scared. My terrible state of mind/being + the heretofore complained of hipster/bad attitude and long wait should have equaled a match made in heck. Thankfully for all involved, the situation played out in a much better way. \n\nIt started on a rocky note. The place was packed, the young lady at the door had no idea how long it would take to get a table, some [redacted] at the bar was taking up two seats, and in our quest to just sit and get a beer, my friend and I were twice moved by the wait staff. Not fun. I could tell I was off of my game because in the midst of all this chaos, no blood had been spilled and all was well for the patrons and staff. Obviously, I was in a weakened state. Perhaps having pity on my emaciated/thirsty self, a kindly waiter gave us some decent Purgatory seating, water and beer menus. Seeing my feeble attempts to chastise a cat-eye glasses wearing, three-toned hair having, tight jeans wearing hipsterista for almost spilling a beer on my friend, I can only imagine that our waiter was a kindred spirit of a mean old man... and there's nothing sadder than a weakened old man without teeth trying (in vain) to yell at kids.\n\nSo, we got a table.\n\nOnce seated and committed to trying a couple of the less expensive saisons (Hen House, ftw), I got to the business of ordering. I spent my time in Purgatory wisely and studied the menu to know what I wanted. Like a boss -- BOOM -- fried oysters, pretzel and chickpea burger. Give it to me. Give it all to me! With every bite, I felt my strength return and bitchiness replenish. The cornmeal on the oysters added depth to a bivalve I usually avoid (I used to live in New Orleans; it's a long story). The pretzel is every bit as good as advertised. The cheese sauce needs to be a regular condiment in my fridge. The chick pea burger was a little dry and crumbly. It was hard to eat and a bit messy, even with the white cheese. I ordered it without the aioli, so maybe I had something to do with that (I don't do mayo, not even mayo with a fancy name). The onion jam was a unique note and I wished there was more on the burger since it tasted great and complimented the chick pea and cheese so nicely. I put my face into the side of fries and didn't come up for air until they were all gone. I walked into TMK a broken shell of a mean old man and walked out full recharged in my Mr. Burns-like ways. In a place that could have meant my doom, I was treated with the care and kindness I needed to cause trouble in the lives of others... and, isn't that what it's all about?", "author": "Johnny T."}

You'll know you're in for a treat the moment you're handed the Bible that is the menu of beers here. You open it, see different chapters per se for each style of beer they carry. \n\nIt can be a bit overwhelming and if you live in the state of New Mexico like I do, you don't know what to do when presented with such a wide array of beers, so many of which are impossible to get in YOUR ENTIRE STATE. \n\nAnyways, I started with the Pliny the Elder because, well, I'd have been foolish not to have. I'd had about a year ago and wasn't blown away, feeling that New Mexico's La Cumbre Elevated IPA was just as good, but this time around, I was much more impressed having it on tap. The sweet, citrusy hops were much more prominent this time around and despite the high hop content, it was still easy-drinking. Impressive.\n\nI also tried a beer from Moonlight because I like their back story and because you can't find it in New Mexico either and this beer too was good, though the name escapes me.\n\nFinally, I must thank The Monk's Kettle for introducing me to a new style, gose. I'd never heard of this style much less tried one before---I know, I know, beer amateur---but it truly impressed me. Like almost every other good German beer I've had, this Gose was close to perfection. Smooth, crisp, and pure. It's been a month, so all the details escape me, but I was blown away. Great beer. \n\nI didn't try the food, but it did look excellent, albeit pricey. In fact, that's my one complaint about this place (really a minor one) that the prices are a bit inflated.

They have beer for everyone~ light, dark, strong, fruity, organic, etc. The options just spill off the page.\n\nBeing a female, it's so hard to choose just one.

Being the complete non-beer snob that I was, I naively asked the bartender what her recommendations were.  She looked at me as if I was joking around.  Not really, but fine.  With her eyes wide open and her head shaking subtly from side-to-side, she asked \"Well, do you prefer light, dark... or somewhere in between?\" I responded dark.  She then chuckled and said \"Awesome.  That narrows the list to about 150.\" \n\nThat essentially had set the tone for a great time.  This chick knew her stuff.  She came with 3 recommendations, her favorites of the dark spectrum, and was able to give her reasoning and highlights of each in gory detail.  Tones.  Notes.  Flavors.  I swear, if it had been a few hours earlier, I bet she would have busted out with the food pairings and her take on global warming and how designers and architects are collaborating on developing a common vision to live with rising sea levels at the coastlines.\n\nThe 3 beers we got were the Rasputin, Ten-Fiddy, and Zantus.

They are fairly sized so we split a couple of those.\n\nI ordered the diver scallops with crispy corn and crab risotto. Scallops were cooked perfectly and the chopped bacon paired well with it. The risotto was bomb! It came presented in a way that resembled a mcdonald's hashbrown or rice crispy treat type of shape. The outside was slightly fried, inside the risotto was warm, soft, and delicious. I also tried some of my friends' bricked chicken and cumin rubbed lamb. The chicken was quite succulent and amazing. Wasn't too keen on the lamb though, seemed like there was more bone than meat. I also ordered a Belgium Pale Ale to go with my meal which was decent.\n\nWe had some major gripes about the service. Read Sophie Y.'s review for details on the incidents we encountered.\n\nWould not recommend coming here in a large group. I think most of the tables here are meant to seat 4 people.

The bartender described it as \"beef butter.\"  It was served with toasted pieces of French baguette so you could knife a piece out of the \"canoe\" and smear it onto your toast like patee. It was so creamy, it smoothed out into oil and just fell into the pockets and crannies of the bread. Mmmmmmm! ($9)\n\nThe Charcuterie & Cheese plate was ok.  We got soft cheese, hard cheese, and wild boar salumi.  (Mix and match $12 for two, $5 each additional, $30 for all).  It came with toasted baguette slices, stone ground mustard with actual mustard seeds, jam, brazil nuts, and olives. The jam was good.  Everything else was just ok and nothing special.\n\nJared, the bartender was pretty knowledgable about the beer and helpful in picking out the right ones for my boyfriend and I.

It is a small place, so we had to belly up very close to the bar that seats about 12-14 people, then another 8-10 people standing behind you.  There's also table seating for maybe 24-26 people.  Cozy!\n\nThe beer menu is extensive so I took a shortcut and asked the bartender what HE would have to drink.  He poured me his current fave (which suggests the beer selections change often) which I liked.  I tried a couple other beer selections as well.  All good  Didn't know about the pretzel but I saw it on the plate that whizzed by me so I ordered one.  Nice with the brown mustard.  Burgers also smelled and looked good and I saw a lot of them pass by me on their way to the dining tables.  \n\nWhat impressed me most was the friendly staff.  Seemed like a low-attitude, relaxed bunch of cool people which was a pleasant surprise to me given the place was jammed with folks standing around the bar making it almost impossible for anyone to squeeze past . . . particularly for the servers bringing food to the tables, and, for the table diners that had to squeeze by the bulging bar crowd.  Thankfully I prefer sitting at the bar where you get a good view of what everyone else is ordering and have a chance to chat with the bartender and learn about the current beers being offered..  \n\nI'd definitely go back again for a burger and more brews in this cool, unpretentious place.

So bearing this in mind please do not burn me at the stake.\n\nMy co-worker looooves beer so since his 30th birthday was here I decided to give this place a try based on the reviews I had read. \nParking it horrendous in the mission so if you are going to try to park around here wisse which is a few blocks down is a kind of out of the way alley that for some reason had no one parked in it. \nIt is easy to see that there is often a wait at this place. We managed to get off work early so we sat ourselves right away. This is the only reason I am giving it -1 star. The waitstaff is very disjointed. We sat ourselv and waited for menus then waited again an lengthy amount of time for someone to come back to get rink orders and given how we saw other people waiting we ordered our food right away too to avoid another long wait. It is hard to tell who is working and who isn't, and I def assure you the waitstaff is enjoying themselves as much as the patrons. \n\nFor the beer lovers I can see this being paradise. They have what seems a million beers (literally the menu is about 30 pages long) but unlike alot of places that keep all these beers on tap many of the beers are actually bottled. I noted this because it meant you are not running the chance of getting an \"old\" beer. Unfortunatly for the non-beer drinkers you are prety sol. I know I know \"if you dont drink beer waa waa waa\" well w/e sometimes you have to make do for your friends. \n\nBoth my coworker and I loved the food we had as well. I can not say this enough I will give my love verytime for a place that can do real medium rare burger. Soooooooo much happiness! My Co-worker ahd their pulled chicken and was quite happy with it. neither of us left anything on our plate. Their desserts made the night. I had the dark chocolate bread pudding, and if I didn't already feel like a waterbuffalo from the burger this decadant dessert was going to put me into a happiness coma. Sooooooo good and warm and happy and delicous. C-worker got the peach cobbler. Now it may be because he is male, it may be becaue he was three beers at an average of 18% alcohl each down, it may be because hes \"pretty\" but he was given the warning.. this is hot... and he proceeded to burn his mouth off. Hot means hot. The cobbler was just as decadent and delicous though.\n\nSo to sum it up:\ngreat place for beers\ngreat place for desert\nnot good for gorup bigger than four\nneed to have patience with the wait staff\nneed to be patient while waiting for a palce if you get thre from 5 oclock on. (they do take your number at the door and call you when there is a table open)\nneed to be okay with very close cozy quarters.\n\n\n***Update BTW...

The gentleman stopping our party outside the doors was a surprise, but polite as he inquired if we wished to be seated at the bar, which seemed to be a 30 minute wait, or if our party was interested in one of the small tables set against the walls of the room. I reckon most patrons of this here establishment come in for a beer or two, as the wait for tables was a mere 10 minutes. \n\nThe food itself was good if not anything exceedingly memorable. However, one does not come here for food. With one look at the menu one will notice the extravagant, incredible beer menu, or better yet, beer book, that marches forward, page after weathered page. Though I fancy myself a professional of sorts in those beers of a more expensive variety, I must say I was pleasantly astonished by the best beer menu, by far, I have ever lain my eyes upon from here to yonder and over the rainbow. The descriptions and content of this here menu did make love to my thirst, and ever since then I have not been the same man.

I was able to get a table in the back.  There's limited seating at the bar, then some counter seats in the back as well as a handful of table. First come, first serve- no reservations allowed. The service was friendly and the beer selection is craftily presented in a beer binder with an extensive list. The breaded oysters were not worth the price at $3 a piece, the oysters were a fair size, but the flavor wasn't impressive. The cornmeal over powered the texture and cucumber ketchup was lackluster. The sweetbread dish was ok, however the creamy risotto was the best. It was filling and quite flavorful with good consistency.  Perhaps the larger plates are more interesting, but then you are too full to have more beer.  \nI tried the Kona Coffee Porter and the Black Xantus flight (2009 and 2011 tastings) which were impressive.\nThe place seems little too pretentious- not necessarily the staff, but more the clientele. It's the Mission hipster foodies with their annoying loud and vulgar conversations that make the atmosphere distasteful.

The food and service though have always been five stars in the past. Here's where they went wrong today:\n\n- Wife and I ordered our food, then a couple was set to the table next to us. For some reason, their main course came out before ours. They had burgers, we had a veggies burger and the mussels. Maybe ours took longer.\n\n- Food came and my wife's mussels were overcooked. The mussels were sitting in a tiny amount of broth, the mussels near the top were the consistency of beef jerky, and the bread that came with the mussels to dip in the broth were burnt. Someone left her dish in too long as that would explain the very little broth she had, chewy mussels, and burnt bread.\n\n- My veggie burger came out burned on one side, the other side was cooked properly. Someone left my burger on one side too long. The fries that came with my burger were really potato chips. You could see through the fries and they were crunchy. I felt like I was eating potato strings and not fries.\n\n- Nobody came by at any and asked how our food was or if we needed anything. It was just, here's your food, dig in. Even when they came to clear the table, nobody asked how things were.\n\n- My wife ordered the pickled veggies. Nobody bothered to bring them by.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-25", "description": "As I pretend to be a professional food critic and continue to hone my skills through unnecessarily long Yelp* reviews.  I often find myself torn between summarizing a single experience or taking my impressions and then contextualizing them with all of my restaurant experiences.  All things considered I think the latter is a more fitting way to review anything but sometimes a single experience stands out so much you just have to rave about that one.\n\nThe Monk's Kettle provided such an experience.  To keep this short and sweet since my Yelp* review will be lost in cacophony of SF's Yelp* population this review will be just over 600 words.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered the charcuterie plate, the lamb burger, some french fries with an awesome dip selection and the fig and goat cheese bruschetta.  All things considered the food was very good.  The charcuterie plate had an excellent selection and was definitely not minimal.  The fig and goat cheese bruschetta was amazing; probably one of the best tasting things apps I have ever had.  The lamb burger was good but too much tzatziki kind of drowned the natural flavor of the lamb so it was more of a tzatziki burger and less of a lamb burger. \n \nThe real experience is the beer.  We literally had the real champagne of beers (no offense High Life) and at $65 dollars a bottle was it worth it?  The answer is: I stopped caring!   How the food tasted at about half way through the burger was literally not applicable because I was drinking some of the best beer I have ever tried.   Every beer they picked out for us was a perfect compliment to the food or was some sort of unique and amazing beer that was cause for celebration.  It's not often that I drink a beer and want to high five someone because of how good it is.  I totally high-fived our bartender! \n\nSpeaking of celebration apparently the night we were there is also the same evening that the Belgians celebrate their independence from the Dutch.  I don't know or care how historically accurate that is.  They gave my girlfriend a silly hat to go with an awesome Belgian beer she ordered and everyone is a winner because I got a good laugh, she got a good beer and a free hat.\n\nWhen it comes to free stuff one thing you can rarely get at a bar is a free chemistry lesson.  Well lock down that bar stool because it's about get knowl-edgy up in here.  Not only did out bar tender(s) and server all know the beer menu inside and out and were very attentive but one of them was studying to take a test and gave the group I was sitting with basically a chemistry lesson that came with trying different beers to help describe the brewing processes he was talking to us about.  It was like hanging out with Bill Nye, Mike Rowe and a Belgian Monk without an accent.\n\nOn a completely unrelated tangent; the detractors of Monk's Kettle that complain about the restaurant being crowded need to take a deep breath and realize that anyplace in SF that is good will be crowded.  Almost every decent restaurant used to be someone's living room or a kitchen that was turned in to a whole restaurant.  It's going to be busy and with that being said yes there was a 45 min wait on Wednesday at 8pm.", "author": "Andrew K."}

A lot of menu items are gone, the quality of what remains has gone way down, and prices have skyrocketed! I went to order the nut mix, but was told by our waitress that they no longer make it and that they have made a few changes to the menu.  Why you would remove delicious nut mix from a bar menu? My husband and I both ordered the burger which a year ago was 17.00 with the bacon added on, which I thought was expensive but because it was so delicious I was willing to pay the price.  Now the burger is 17.00 without the bacon, and 3.00 extra for the bacon.  My husband ordered it medium rare and I ordered the burger cooked medium.  Both were served well done, and the burger did not melt in your mouth the way it used to.  Not to mention you could barely taste any bacon flavor from the puny slivers of bacon they laid on top that were as thin as prosciutto.

Maybe I was just drunk from all the beers I had consumed that night, but that pretzel hit the spot!\n\nThe beer list (bottled and on tap) is huge! There are beers from all different varieties, regions, etc. The bartenders sure know their beer damn well, so if you are unsure of what your preference is, I am sure they can hook you up with a taster or two to find the right beer for you. \n\nI would love to come back to one of their beer dinners, they sound right up my alley!", "author": "Summer C."}

What happened?\n\nOne of my original favorite spots in San Francisco has truly gone straight down the tubes. The old menu is sorely missed, and the beer prices are now so ridiculously high ($14.75 for Rodenbach Grand Cru on tap?  come on...) that with the lack of a food option that makes sense for this kind of beer-based establishment, I would much rather go to Magnolia, Beer Revolution, or even Toronado. And don't even get me started on the door guy, that's clearly been covered enough here on Yelp.\n\nBTW, I can go on forever about how superior the old food menu was, and how much more sense it made for this place. Clearly those in charge here are more interested in making the food here more wine-bar esque, and less gastropub-ish. That's fine, their decision. For this style of food though, there are far, far superior places to go to in San Francisco.\n\nI will say though, to the server of the table of two next to us. Don't be a condescending asshole to people. If a couple people who come in who are really stoked on something no longer on the menu (in this case, the older, larger, superior pretzel), don't make them feel stupid about it. \"Oh, you mean the ones that we used to just microwave from a box?  You clearly haven't been here in awhile.\"  A) I doubt that's true and B) Why go there and say that?  If you're so all about the new pretzel being better than the old version, let it speak for itself. \n\nAnd it does. It is very, very small, and unfulfilling, and much like The Monk's Kettle now, only half of what it used to be.", "author": "George C."}

We sat at the cute table next to the entrance window (no wait for a seat).\n\nWe ordered the Serpents Stout and the London Porter Nitro. (They had run out of the Evil Twins Red Ale - so we'll have to make a return trip.) The Serpents Stout was an impressive beer. The portion is a little less than you'd expect, but that's because the alcohol concentration is almost double that of many of the other beers on draught. Very full flavor, not too bitter. All-around a great beer.\n\nThe Porter Nitro should not be tried with the Stout because it will taste like water in comparison.

They don't take reservations, and, you know, it's a hipster joint -- which to my mind meant standoffish waiters in horn-rimmed glasses and scarf-clad lines out the door. I WAS DEAD WRONG.\n\nThe Monk's Kettle is a beer drinker's paradise in the Mission district, just a short walk from the 16th St. BART station. It's a small place with cute decor and chalkboards littered with beer family diagrams to educate the uninitiated. I went there with a party of 4 for an early dinner.\n\nThe staff and clientele were friendly and helpful. The bartenders went above and beyond to make sure we had a comfortable table and could get in and out just fine (my boyfriend is in a wheelchair). Patrons moved, bartenders escorted us, and owners spoke shyly about how they were the luckiest guys in the world for having this place.\n\nTheir beer list is, frankly, insane. They have a respectable tap list of seasonal and rare (to see on tap, at least) beers, plus a gigantic binder of their bottled offerings. Their prices range from a little under $5 a pint to $80 a bottle, with a few aged beers they've set aside since their opening. They have a rotating 6oz pour flight of 3 brews for $10; when I went, it was a nice little Whitbier arrangement with a prototypical example of the style (Biere de Blanco by Craftsman Brewing), one with a nice smokey undertone (Heavenly Hef, again by Craftsman), and one with a sour cast (Festina Peche by the much-beloved Dogfish). If you're scared of beer, or just don't like it, they also have wine, cider, sorghum beer, and other \"lighter\" alcoholic offerings.\n\nThey also have a full menu of nibbles and entrees, each with a recommended beer style pairing. My favorites of the night were the cornmeal oysters with cucumber ketchup, the beef cheeks with fried polenta, and the bone marrow boats with onions, capers, POPCORN (yes, popcorn) and preserved lemon zest. The bone marrow was SO GOOD; the zest lightened it up just enough, and the popcorn added the perfect crunch. A spelt burger and diver's scallops with grilled peaches and corn/crab risotto were also consumed, and I was told they were good as well -- I wasn't wowed by the scallops, but they were tasty enough.\n\nOh, and we had carrot cake with a sloppy, sour cream icing in a mason jar for dessert.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-02", "description": "I went here at least a half dozen times while living in San Francisco for a few months. Pretty great beer selection, but holy hell is this place overpriced (even for the caliber and rarity of the beers they serve). Inside is cramped and tiny, and unless you can get a table (which they'll only allow if you also order food, which is also terribly overpriced), this place can be downright uncomfortable when it's busy. Other than the cramped space though, the ambiance of the place is nice.\n\nThe beer selection really is pretty good and among the best I found in San Francisco, but as I said the prices are very high, even for the beers they serve. There are literally beers on the menu which go up to $16 per serving -- per 250 - 330 ml serving, not a 750 ml bomber. This is for a type of beer that might cost $8 in a bar in Atlanta or $10 to $12 in a bar in New York City. Nonetheless though, the quality of beers available is where this place shines. The variety is fairly good, but the tap list is sometimes a little too intensely focused on Belgian beers. There are amazing beers from other countries in the world, you know, and there's no point in having four Belgian saisons on tap among a menu of 20 beers, no matter how good each of those saisons is... Overall though, I would still give the beer selection about 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n\nMore on the beer prices -- I just looked at their current beer menu on-line and had my opinion confirmed. As of writing this, the Rodenbach Grand Cru is on tap... for $13.75 for a 9 ounce serving. This is a beer which I've had at Toronado in the Haight for $8 for the same size.\n\nThe food is good, but again overpriced. The sandwiches on the menu start at $13, and if you want to get a bacon cheeseburger, it's $15 (the bacon is $2 extra...). It's a very good burger, but seriously, guys... The non-sandwich entrees start around $20, with some specials occasionally going up to $30. The first time I came here I had a scallop dish which was, I think, $28. It was also good, and I know seafood is expensive, but it wasn't mind-blowing or that interesting and I felt the price was too much for the dish.\n\nThe staff are pretty friendly and helpful, and they're happy to give you tastes of beers. Most of them are also clearly interested themselves in the beers they serve, and they can help you pick a beer you like. Ultimately, I ended up coming here over and over again, despite all the complaints I have, and I feel a little bit dirty only giving it a 3/5 instead of at least a 4/5. It's a love/hate relationship...\n\nWhat would bump my rating of this place up more? It could get one extra star by cutting the prices of everything by about 25%, and another extra star by doubling in size.

Belgian \"frites\" were...not frites.\n\nBottom line: Way overpriced.   Only a limited selection of Belgians and other beers you can get pretty much anywhere.

The draft menu is not huge, but they really know how to source.\n\nMy Abbey Special (8 oz) Belgian-Style from Dubbel Marin Brewing, Marin, CA was just the perfect Belgian, providing just a touch of bite while boasting the most smooth, rich flavor you could ask for.\n\nGrubbage is outrageous at this fine establishment. The fries gave hints of an upgraded Mcdonald's style tuber strips. The \"hop salt\" made them perfectly dehydrating on my tongue, and the really good whole grain mustard packed a punch.\n\nThe rather small pretzel was iffy at $4.50, but aside from price, the American stsaple was truly the perfect texture.

The raisin gastrique (if you're awesome like me and don't know what gastrique means: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrique) served as a fantastic marinade for it.

I think three is more of a true rating, IMO.\n\nI was really anticipating having greats beers here and I did.  This place had 24 beers on tap.  I had so many to choose from (170-200 at any given time) that it almost made it hard to make a decision!  I opted to go with the Fillers London porter England.  5.4% ABV served in 20oz  glass for $8.25.  This is an English Porter.  The aroma was excellent. Very nice roasty flavor.  Tasted like a sweeter Guinness.  Almost chocolate-like very smooth and rich in flavor.\n\nMy waitress/bartender was very pleasant to deal with and recommended the Bourbon Barrel-aged Black Couldron.  This was an Imperial Stout served in an 8oz glass. 8.0% ABV for $5.25.  This beer is brewed in Idaho.\n\nShe said my choice (the porter) would overpower my meal but it certainly didn't.\n\nI ordered a Turkey burger.  It was pan-seared with organic tomato, organic lettuce, and red onion.  It ran be $12.50.  The burger wasn't the greatest.  It certainly lacked flavor/seasoning, so I just added some pepper and ketchup.  I still wish it hadn't tasted plain.  The bread was a bit more on the stale side.\n\nA few cool things about this place - You can see the kitchen from the end of the bar.  The decor is pretty cool.  It isn't super flashy nor is it boring by any stretch.  Even if you think it sucks, the beer selection here will take your mind off of things and help you concentrate on drinking.\n\nThe place had 5 booths that fit four people each and about 20 bar stools. It looked like it had adequate standing room for roughly 50 people, although, the max capacity is listed at 49.   \n\nThis is a smaller place that I thought before I visited, but they have tons of beers and some decent food selections.\n\nFor my second beer, I went with the St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout from Montreal, Canada.  This was a bottled brew and had a 5% ABV.  It ran me $7 for the 12oz bottle.  Not a bad beer. I dig.\n\nThis beer had a flat, but not a bad, aftertaste. Was hoping of more of a sweeter flavor something like Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout, which I love.\n\nThe service was excellent. When I arrived, at roughly 3pm on a Tuesday, only 2 people were seated having some drinks. In about an hour, 5 others arrived.  \n\nI sat at the bar and watched their 32\" flat panel near the entrance.\n\nI'd definitely go back here to have some awesome brews.

I justified this dinner as a treat for finally moving west, knowing this dinner would be over my normal budget...

Perfectly cooked polenta with melt in your mouth shredded beef cheeks, and a little horseradish for a nice kick.\n\n- Seared veal sweetbreads, pickled apple slaw, parsnip -  Your basic fried bar food taken to a higher, almost ungodly, level.\n\n- Apple Cobbler, caramel, sweet cream - Another dish that is perfect for a cold rainy night in SF.

We went to Monk's Kettle, a specialty pub known for a very wide selection of rare and fine Abbey and of Trappist Belgian beers.  As this friend of mine is very interested in the brewing process and the unique results, needless to say, he was excited to be there. We ordered two $17.00 dollar \"Rocheforte\" beers as well as two other steeply priced beers and a side of fries.  \n\nUpon looking at the menu we discovered that we might as well be dining, since the price of the libations equaled that of the dinner options. It made no difference- it was a birthday and we were happy to be there. The atmosphere was right, the place was packed but with a more mature crowd and the environs clean, elegant and attractive.\nIt wasn't until we were approached by a server who told us that since we were not consuming food we would have to hurry up our taste-testing and make the table available. That is when the night took a turn for the negative. This was upsetting since we were spending more than those eating dinner at the tables adjacent to us.  \n\nIn my opinion, there is no way this situation could have been better handled. The server should never have approached paying customers with such a rude, arbitrary demand and if the establishment intends to reserve tables for dining only, then signs must be posted and the price of the beers must be lowered. Paying $17.00 for one glass of beer and then being shooed out of my table because I didn't purchase a $9.00 apple pie is utterly absurd and a little infuriating.

Since I was in the hood, I decided to try my luck at getting into Monk's Kettle on a Friday night. Last time they said the wait would be 2 hours. This time they said 1 hour. We got in 20 minutes later. Thanks for calling and texting! There's no room inside to wait so we found shelter at the bookstore across the street.\n\nWhat we ordered\n\n1) Mussels, Belgian ale, garlic, basil, toasted acme levain\n- The mussels were so good. The broth was rich and divine. Yummy.\n\n2) Bone marrow canoe, toast, parsley, lemon\n- I don't have bone marrow often. It was on the oily side and reminded me of pate. Fun presentation but I'd skip it next time.\n\n3) Malt crusted tri-tip, braised sweet potato, beurre noir\n- The meat was very succulent. Salty and rich. I would have liked a neutral starch to go with this. Or more beer! Still delicious though. Just needed something to balance it out.\n\nMy drink: I had the Allagash Belgian-Style Witbier as was recommended to go with the mussels. I do like Belgium wheat beers/white ales which are light and pleasant. I wish I could have tried more of their beers but alas I had to drive.\n\nVerdict: Definitely would go again but only if I could have more beer. :)", "author": "Mary W."}

WOW. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/KUcEZr79LsioYk9EHje3lQ/l\n\nI was going to give this place 4 stars for two reasons: \n1) The bacon in my mac and cheese was SUPER SUPER salty.\n2) My mac and cheese came out lukewarm -- wasn't pipping hot.\n\nBut I'm giving Monk's Kettle 5 stars because:\n1) The server noticed my pile of bacon left over in my cast iron skillet which once housed my mac and cheese and asked if I didn't like the bacon. I told her that it was good and the bacon gave the mac and cheese a nice smokey flavor but it was way too salty. Upon receiving our bill, she took off the charge for bacon. Two thumbs up.\n2) I was somewhat peeved that the mac and cheese came out rather lukewarm but I thought about how badly my tongue would be burned had it been pippin' hot. I scarf down delicious mac and cheese. If my mac and cheese had portions of it that was slightly cold, I would have thrown a fit. \n\nSo all this talk about Monk's Kettle's mac and cheese definitely puts it up there. It's great competition with Luna Park's mac and cheese as well as some of my other favorites. The BF ordered their Chicken Pot Pie and was well pleased with it. He also stated that he didn't have to fish around for chicken bits b/c there were tons in there! Yay :))\n\nI'm definitely coming back and upon my return, I'm going to get a basket of fries with three dipping sauces (ketchup, and 2 aiolis) AND I'm going to order their mac and cheese again. This time, without bacon.

First off, the restaurant is located in an incredibly upbeat and lively part of the Mission District, which definitely adds to the lively vibe this place gives off in the evening. However, after arriving with three other friends on a Friday night around 7 PM, we were told that our wait would be THREE hours long. The long wait was by far the biggest turn off for me, but I'm glad we decided to stick it out and try it out. To justify our decision to stay, the fact that there are plenty of bars in the area made the wait a little more bearable.\n\nIf I only had to rank the beer selection, I'd definitely give this place five stars. The selection is by far one of the most impressive i've seen thus far in my relatively short time as a 21 y/o! There's an entire binder with a index and terms glossary in the back of the binder that details each and every type of beer that this place has to offer. Without a doubt, I'll bet you can find something you'll like. It took us quite some time to just go through this menu.\n\nAs for the food, I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed, but my burger was tasty and the waitress' beer suggestion went well with my order. However, due to the long waits and small capacity of the restaurant, I don't think that the food was worth the wait. All in all, I was a bit disappointed with my overall experience here, but am willing to give it another try. Especially because of how many beer options there are.

Obviously their beer assortment is impressive, and the food used to be too, but sadly not anymore.  \n\nThere is a new chef in and since then I have been disappointed with each and every dish I've had there.  Literally, every single dish, I can honestly say I can cook better than that.  I really can't understand why it's so bad, and that hard to say because I really want this place to succeed.  \n\nThe one word that came to mind for the food was DRY: the veggie burger had the texture of sawdust and the bun had next to zero sauce/dressing.  I had to ask for ketchup, aioli and pickles just to give in some sort of moisture (no tomatoes because they were used for a starter dish and they didn't have enough for me).  The cassoulet was beyond dry too, and this is a dish that is supposed to be oozing with moisture.  The beans and vegetables in it seemed raw uncooked, and without flavor.  Huge disappointment.  And the chicken pollard was actually a pathetic interpretation of a chicken sandwich -- how is that not mentioned on the menu!?

Here's why:\n\nI arrived for dinner with a friend on a Friday and the place was unsurprisingly packed.  The guy at the door who was managing the waiting list was calm and well-mannered and helped me find a seat at the bar while I waited for my friend.  He kept us posted as to when the next table would be ready, and also offered us the option of eating at the bar but we decided to wait.  In the meantime, the bartender helped me select a beer and based on my vague descriptions of what I liked, let me sample a few and picked a really nice one for me.  Water was given and replaced without question.  \n\nWhen we got to our table about an hour later, the kitchen was handing out free (and delicious) fries and pretzel knots because orders were backed up and meals were coming out slower than usual.  The service was warm, friendly and accommodating and checked in on us frequently without being obtrusive. \n\nOur food arrived about a half-hour later (really not that delayed) and it was delicious!\n\nWe had:\n1) Malt-crusted tri-tip with brussell sprout hash ($24)\n2) Spent grain and chickpea burger with salad ($13)\n\nBoth were plated beautifully and delicious.  I'm mad for home-made veggie burgers, and this unctuous, flavourful patty was one of the better ones I've had in the city.  I really liked the onion jam it came with and the salad, rather than being an afterthought, was a smaller portion of their fresh and delicious local greens, toasted hazelnut and fromage blanc salad.  The tri-tip was tender, nice and red in the middle and a good portion after the fries and beer we had consumed.  \n\nThis place had a good reputation, and deservedly so.

And you hear about all the different glasses for different beers- which, in my twenty-odd years of drinking beer I have not once been able to appreciate the subtle differences in beer glasses.  But that's beside the point: they have a ton of different beers and serve them in the \"appropriate\" glassware, so you can bring your beer-snob buddies to tMK and be cool.\n\nBut the winner for me was the service and the cheeseburger.  Oh my lord, the cheeseburger was a wonderful surprise.  In fact, the minute I walked in I saw a couple of burgers going to tables and knew that this was no ordinary bar burger.  This was going to be special...and my god, it was.  Perfect bun-to-meat ratio, ingredients that complimented rather than competed with the sandwich...it's just such an enormous shame that the fries seem like an afterthought.  Don't get me wrong; the fries are good.  Just not quite worthy of sharing the plate with that cheeseburger.  Please note: if you are a \"slightly pink in the middle\" burger eater, order it MEDIUM.  I was glad I erred on the side of caution because my MEDIUM burger was cooked a perfect MEDIUM RARE.  What is it with \"gourmet burger\" joints downshifting the wellness on burgers?  Why does MEDIUM mean MEDIUM RARE in the world of restaurant burgers.  Yo no se.\n\nThe bartending staff is exceedingly polite, cheerful, and eager to please.  Seriously, the bartender/waitperson who helped us should be in the running for \"Server of the Year for the Entire Universe\".  She was very, very helpful and accommodating to our fairly lubricated group that may or may not have been a little...er...well, let's just say that we all could have lived without more beer.\n\nSo go to tMK.  It's a lot of fun, full of delicious beer, and from what I tried on the menu I can say I was very pleased.", "author": "Ben G."}

We should have known those days were over when we asked about the new menu/chef, and the waiter told (warned?) us that they were trying to compete with other restaurants in the area.  Translation: the simple, well-made chicken sandwich with bacon has been replaced by \"chicken paillard with bacon jam\".  The tuna steak sandwich with fries (which was pretty much perfect as it was) has been replaced by \"tuna tomba with cauliflower puree and turnips\".  Which was not bad, to tell the truth, but at $23, calling this a \"large plate\" is quite a stretch.  \n\nAgain, it's not that it's bad food.  It's just that in a neighborhood filled with inventive but pricey (and at times \"chichi\") restaurants, it was really nice having one place offering simple, classic comfort food prepared really, really well.\n\nI don't think I'll go back for a while, unless maybe for one of those delicious pretzels (and of course the beers).

Six out of seven members of our party had arrived, but they still refused to seat us. The host gave us a time limit of 5 minutes for our seventh person to arrive, otherwise the seventh person would be unable to order food. What kind of a policy is that, and why do they have to be so strict about it? No one was behind us in line...\n\nNot to mention the seven of us sat in a 6-person booth, and they refused to add a chair at the end of the booth. Of course I had to be the fourth person squished on at the end. Needless to say, it was quite an uncomfortable meal.\n\nThe service during the meal was decent--not great.

According to some news sources, the transporter is just a few technological brow furrows away. For the skeptics among us and during the wait in the meantime, there is the Monk's Kettle. The Monk's Kettle is such a Portland kind of restaurant, it can only be located in my other favorite city.\n\nThe space they use on 16th used to house a slightly dingy but lovable burger joint. Since the burger joint's trip to the fryer in the sky, Monk's Kettle has taken the general idea - a nice place to get a burger - and dressed it up. Dark wood booths with an array of planks to support you and your dining companions line the walls. The bar holds a liver-busting amount of taps. And the food, for fancypants pub fare, manages to make even the most jaded and ironic of Mission dwellers mmm with glee.\n\nThere are burgers. There are some more involved dinner entrees. There are also fries that come with ketchup and two kinds of aioli dipping sauces. There is a breaded mac 'n cheese that you can add smoked bacon to and served in a little cast iron skillet that, if it weren't for the amount of heat it can retain, you would probably lick clean. There are also pages of beers to be selected, ingested, traded with friends, and adored like woodland creatures. I had an oatmeal stout from somewhere in Central California, which I was afraid would add too much heaviness to my meal consisting mostly of starch. But the stout had such a subtle, sweet tone that it provided a hoppy retreat from all the potato and noodle options sitting on our table. But there were so many beers to choose from that it would have been very hard to come up with an unhappy combo.\n\nSince Portland is the land where myriad beers roam free to be paired with hearty meat and cheese dishes, I got a welcome taste of home in my home-away-from-home.

If it were, say, 4pm on a Saturday afternoon and I was craving a nice exotic cold one and I'm already in the mission, then sure I'd go there.  If it's 8pm and I want a beer then no to Monk's Kettle.  Why? Well, if you're gonna go at that time, you should be prepared for a looooong wait.  And by the time you sit down, you probably already had 2 beers.  They make a killing on the poor suckers that are willing to wait for a table or a seat at the bar.  No one wants to just stand around twiddling their thumbs.  It's a good thing their selection of beers is impressive.  There were pages and pages of it and with style descriptions and country of origin.  While I'm a total beer novice, I did appreciate trying to pretend like I knew what I was doing when ordering the beer. \n\nAs for the food, the fries are delicious.  It comes with the usual ketchup and a mustard sauce.  I'm an aioli girl so I had to ask for it since it doesn't normally accompany the fries.  The burger wasn't half bad either.  Carmelized onions and aioli mmmm.  It was a bit on the smaller side, though.\n\nOverall, not a terrible experience but I wouldn't wait 1+ hours.", "author": "Karen N."}

The Monk's Kettle is a true San Francisco gem.  It fits a surprising number of needs - whether you want a bar to chill with your friends, an intimate space for a date, a delicious late-night meal, or a snack and an insanely well-specified brew, The Kettle has you covered.\n\nThese cats know their beer.  It doesn't matter how well you know yours - they are super helpful and friendly and will find you something you like.  It doesn't matter if you walk in and say your favorite beer is Pinot Grigio, these guys will find something for your palette.  The beer menu updates frequently, and the selection is top-notch.\n\nThe food at Monk's Kettle has always been a big draw.  a big, rich New American menu has been the staple, but they recently got a new chef and a whole new menu, to which I cannot yet speak.  Of course that makes this paragraph completely useless.  You may skip to the next one.\n\nI gotta give a shout-out to my homey Sayre - bar manager and beer buyer extraordinaire, Sayre has been advising me on liquor choices since our college days at the Red Room in Santa Cruz.  Now a Certified Cicerone (http://www.cicerone.org/), Sayre is the single most knowledgeable beer enthusiast - nay, professional - I've ever met.

I had heard there was always a wait so I wasn't surprised. After we sat down, a fourth friend decided to join us and stopped in. As he went to sit down with us at our table, the hostess stopped him and informed us that The Monk's Kettle has a policy of not allowing four people to squeeze into a table which was designated for three (but could easily fit four). We asked if we could move to the table next to ours set for 4 and she said no. We would have to put our name at the bottom of the list, it would take another 20 minutes to get a table for 4. We asked if she could please make an exception or else we would have to leave and she said \"no, no exceptions.\"\n\nWell obviously we couldn't leave our friend just hanging in the Mission alone! So we had to leave! And we had all hauled our asses all the way out there! What is up with service in this town!?!?\n\nI know this place takes itself seriously, but its a gastro-pub! PUB!

He's a regular here and I can see why. \n\nLong and narrow, easily crowded.

The waiter is knowledgeable and patient and will give you samples of the draft beers in these wee little beer steins upon request.  Decent food menu geared towards meat eaters but some solid vegetarian options too.  Sister and brother-in-law went for the burgers, I had a bite and it was a perfectly juicy, cheesy, bacony bite.  I ordered the bone marrow canoe and a salad and my partner had the beef cheeks small plate.  The bone marrow was beautifully presented, but sadly very disappointing.  There was probably 1/2 teaspoon of actual marrow and it lacked the rich flavour or texture I was anticipating, instead it was just rendered fat on toast with parsley leaves.    Salad was also a bit uninspired with about 3 tasty bites and the rest was dry bland lettuce (not even crisp and fresh).  The beef cheeks on polenta was very rich and tasty, but not a meal.  I'd say stick with the entrees and skip the small plates unless you're not hungry at all.  \n\nOur server was extremely patient as brother-in-law had tons of questions and was a little spastic (enthusiastic, very very enthusiastic), there was a moment or two that I thought the server was offended or confused but he handled himself well and made excellent recommendations.

When we arrived there were no tables available, but we were quickly able to get two seats at the side bar area.  This place is very small, and it was tough to stand while waiting prior to scoring the bar seats as there is not much room between the bar and the seating area.  However, despite the size of the place, they have an extensive books full of beers and in addition they also have 10-15 beers on tap.\n\nI tried three different beers while here and none of them disappointed.  The one thing I did notice is that the pricing of the beers here seemed to be a little bit on the higher side.  However, since they have a great selection that could be overlooked.  For food to start off with my husband and I shared the cheese plate and then I had the soft pretzel. The cheese plate was large and contained a good variety of cheese as well as a meat, mustard, and various jams.  It contained more then enough bread to spread the cheese on (which is something I find some places try to slight you on).  The bread was toasted lightly and was nice and crispy.  The soft pretzel was served warm and came with a nice spicy mustard and a cheese sauce.  \n\nFor the meal I ordered the three day ale bricked chicken which was amazing!  The chicken was cooked perfectly and was very tender and juicy. The light sauce surrounding the chicken gave it a great flavor.  My husband had the burger which looked pretty good, but I am sure it probably was not as great as my chicken!

The roast sounded delicious, but unfortunately they ran out as we were giving orders.  The alternative was a duck confit roast, but I opted for the short rib instead.  It was pretty good, hearty and filling.  it had an odd taste to it though, which I never pinpointed, but that odd flavor actually paired well with the beer they recommended.\n\nI had a great time here meeting new friends and eating here, but the one drawback was the service  They are very strict about their \"capacity\" and letting people in...so when we initially got there, two of us were trying to join two others already there, but we were asked to wait outside for a few minutes.  It was no big deal...we were initially just going to head elsewhere for dinner, but then they ended up being able to get a table for us.  They even stored luggage for two of us (since we were in SF on a layover).  \n\nThe speed of service at the table was more problematic.  The waiter came by initially, but then we didn't see him for about 20 minutes after we were ready to place out order.  When we finally grabbed someone to say we'd lost out waiter, they did send someone else prompty to take our order.  They also explained that the waiters had taken a food break (seems like poor timing).  However, after ordering, our food took at least another 30 minutes to show up, if not longer.

The apples slices in the salad were a little mushy, and I left most of those behind on the plate.

The small dishes seem to pack more flavor than the larger ones, but that's a good thing since it encourage longer nibbling periods of more tasty beer drinking.  Speaking off, very impressive beer menu and I suppose some people come here just for it without ever trying the food.\n\nGiant Pretzel: You can tell a good pretzel when the outer skin is crunchy and the innards are moist and chewy.  Extremely hot to the touch when it arrived, this high end bar food tasted great in the cheddar dip (way better than cheez whiz).  The stone ground mustard was nice too, but my attention drifted towards the cheese mostly.\n\nMac & Cheese: I think I've been having way too much mac & cheese around town and have thus become very picky nowadays, but I blame on the fact that every fancy comfort place places it on the menu.  This mac & cheese was definitely up there, served in a hot skillet with a good crisp layer of browned bread crumbs.  Under the hood was some creamy goodness and the bacon add-on definitely upgraded the awesomeness.  My only wish would be for more melted cheese on top.\n\nPork Chop: The most expensive item on the menu, really?  It was a good chop no doubt: thick and juicy with nice grill sear marks.  Could have stood to have some more glaze as the flavor was a little a bland.  The cheddar scallion potato pancake was super dry and felt like potato particles rather than the shreddings of a typical potato pancake.  The brussels sprouts weren't caramelized enough since only a few of them had specks of crunchy outer leaves.\n\nChicken Pot Pie: Not really a pot pie since there was no pastry on the bottom, so more of a chicken ramekin with a pastry crown on top.  A tad on the small side, but packed with flavor.  The broth was super creamy encasing very fresh tasting peas and carrots.  Some pieces of chicken were tender and flavorful, but a few tasted skanky... I'd suggest not putting in the back meat cuts.  The pastry crown itself had some nice herbs to it.", "author": "Adam B."}

When the rest of our group rolled in at 7:30 the place was packed to the brim and was still full when we left at 10:30. The booth was comfy and big enough to fit six people... as long as those six people are good friends who eat off of each others plates and sip each others beer. We are.\n\nOur rockstar of a waiter was taking care of all the tables by himself so things went a little slow, but in a happily taking the time to appreciate all the beer and food kind of way not the antsy, I want to get out of here already kind of way. He said they weren't prepared for the amount of people coming in on opening night (not even the official grand opening last night) so I'm sure things will run smoother once they're open for a while. Even with the amount of people he kept checking up on us and made sure we had plenty of beer.\n\nThe winner of the night was the BBQ pulled pork sandwich... I just had a taste but will definitely be getting that next time. The bruschetta with wild mushrooms and cheddar was also amazing and I heard from the other end of the table that the burger and veggie burger were both great. I wasn't thrilled with my ahi tuna sandwich, not bad just nothing special. I'm looking forward to seeing a bigger dessert menu. I like cake with my beer.\n\nAnd the beer. My god the beer. I tried the Blue Dot IPA first... a pretty good, mellow IPA. They were having trouble with the keg so I switched to a favorite I've only seen at Toronado before - Bombay by Boat IPA and it made me happy to be alive. My stout loving friend just about fainted when he tasted the Old Rasputin Stout - Nitro. Besides being simply astounding in its size, the beer menu was well laid out and had thoughtful explanations of each type of beer. And for Christ's sake they have a quote about beer by Plato written on the chalkboard! \n\nSo go, try lots of good beer and save room for me at the Kettle.", "author": "Brandy H."}

Mushroom bruschetta, absolutely awesome...this is me talking on an already full stomach since we'd only just walked from our dinner at Cha Cha Cha...lol, yes me and my best friend...we are pigs.

Its was good again, so there is some consistency here at Monk's.  I shared a chicken breast sandwich with my friend.  Usually I do not eat chicken breast, turkey breast...breast in general.... but hmm...good amount of cheese on that sucker, lots of pesto aioli, and bacon...so it wasn't dry and it was actually pretty good.

Even if he had let us sit at the tables there would have been two 2 tops available. We felt discriminated against bc we are gay and weren't hipsters!

None of Stone's beers are for the faint of heart. You remember that \"Bitter beer face\" commercial from many years ago? Yea, if you're not used to hoppy beers, Stone will do that to ya.\n\nWhat's crazy about Monk's Kettle is that, yes they have my favorite brew, but that's not even one of the strongest or even the hoppiest of brews there.

My boyfriend tried the Bear Republic Hop Yard Rye, which he loved.  I had a black current cider and a friend had a tall glass of Pislner Urquell.  \n\nThe charcuterie plate consisted of pate, salami, prosciutto, some type of dried out pulled pork (everything was great except for this) and just a few slices of bread, which was clearly not enough for our table of five.  They had no problem bringing out more bread for us to eat with the pate.  The salads were large enough to share.\n\nThey had a NYE menu along with the regular menu.  The two special entrees listed were crab cakes and steak. Most everyone at our table ordered the NY steak at $22, which came with sides of mashed potatoes and chard with bits of bacon.  This was definitely the dish everyone was left raving about, especially the perfectly cooked cuts of meat.   \n\nOne friend had the crab cakes, which at $14 for two cakes and nothing else, was not nearly enough food to be listed as an entree.

Yes, I got TWO desserts! The beer I loved the best was the Scottish beer called Traquair. The servers were very knowledgeable about the beers even though the ones our server suggested paled in comparison after that Traquair. \n\nI highly recommend finding alternative transportation there as parking is typical frustration Mission-like parking. Also get there early, like 5 or 6pm to get little to no wait time. The atmosphere was very pub-like (close, warm, friendly) and I loved the little chalkboard where people just drinking could doodle.

There are few places you could considering going to before Monk's Kettle if you want to try some quality beer.\n\nBut I wouldn't say the same about the food.  It's not that the food isn't good - my girlfriend and I both enjoyed our meals, and the menu is well constructed to match well with most types of beer - it's just not the best for the price.   I'd call it more of a pub with (overpriced) food,  than a gastropub.  \n\nMy $25 beef short rib was not worth the price I paid.  The scallops we split as an appetizer were delicious, but considering the three small scallops and single slice of wrapped bacon went for $15, I can't say the value equaled the quality.  My girlfriend enjoyed her faux beef burger, but it didn't blow her away (it was priced more normally, however).\n\nI'm not saying I won't return to The Monk's Kettle - I definitely will - I'll just go in with a different mindset.  I think the perfect thing to do is to drink beer and split some of the smaller plates.

Good presentation, garnish was fresh, taste was fine but ... the burger leaked juice like it was a ripe orange and I'd poked a hole in it with a straw. When I finished, I had a puddle that filled the bottom of my plate. If you're using frozen meat, that's cool, but you might want to mix in some bread or starch, or fork them when they're cooking, or something.

We also tried to order a beer described as an \"Eisbock\" in which the water in the beer  is frozen and the ice removed to increase the alcohol content to about 12.5%, unfortunately they had been out of this for a couple of weeks and had not received a resupply yet. I will be keeping tabs on that as I just want to have tried an Eisbock. \n\nBeyond the beer, the food was heavenly, this included a couple of baskets of fries which were thin, crisp and delicious, a giant prezzel with beer/chedder dipping sauce, a fried goat cheese with tomatoes and garlic on baguette slices, and a mushroom brusectta.

Some start all red-hot and exciting, and then, one day, you're glancing across the table and you think to yourself \"Has this person ALWAYS been incapable of having even a single significant thought?  Have I really gone this long without noticing this?  I would jab this steak knife into my thigh if it would end this conversation right now so I wouldn't have to endure even one more second of it.\"  Some start all hesitantly, in screwy fits-and-starts, and then catch like the motor of an old Motown muscle car, content to purr delightedly for years so long as you regularly add fuel and lube.\n\nI really can't help you with the lube part, which I meant totally metaphorically, BTW (submitted for your consideration: compassion is the sine qua non lubricant for any well-oiled relationship), but if you need fuel, Monk's Kettle is the place to go.  And when I say that, I principally mean that you need to go there ONLY and SOLELY when I'm not there, because there just isn't that much seating, and I always feel weird when I have to throw people out.  I mean, I still do it, but I feel weird about it.\n\nYou can now find me at The Kettle (I will also accept \"TMK,\" but only when used completely ironically.  Thankfully, this is The Mish, and half the residents only know how to do things ironically.) on an almost weekly basis.  It took a long time to convince me that this was a relationship worth working on, fostering, fondling, enriching, extending, expanding.  Did I just say fondling?  Did I just write something as though I was having a conversation with you where I couldn't just glance up at the screen and know what I had typed?  Yes.  Yes I did.  And I'm okay with that.\n\nThe food is fantastic.  The beer selection has been cited as a cause for relapse in 5,329 AA meetings (for awhile, they had an on-site sobriety buddy/mentor/sponsor/coach/whatever the hell you call those guys, but they discontinued it because even they kept getting hammered and drunk-dialing college girlfriends.  (Sample excerpt: \"When I returned to the laundry room and found that you had carefully folded all my clothes that I left in the drier for hours, that's when I knew you and I were meant to be together forever, you whore!  Why did you leave me?\").).\n\nListen: there are a lot of places in this city where you can go to experience snobby bartenders, get overcharged, eat crappy food, and generally be treated poorly.  It's just like that string of horrible, abusive, unhealthy relationships you've been in over the years: you can keep doing the same dumb crap that you've been doing, or you can lose that zero and get yourself a hero.  [People totally still say that, right?]  Me, I say life has enough pain without self-inflicted Bad bAr Relationship Syndrome (or BARS, for short.  All rights reserved.).

Got the pretzel knot, fries, the bone marrow boat, scallops and the short rib. I thought the bone marrow boat was a little skimpy, as it's a huge bone, but it feels like there's only enough marrow for maybe 2 of the toast points they give you, not four. The scallops were a HUGE dissapointment, as for $15 I got three little nickel sized portions of scallops, and some unidentifable veg wrapped in half a piece of bacon. Fifteen dollars, and sitting at the pass for a good 5-6 minutes as I stared at the plate and prayed it wasn't mine? I think not. The pretzel knot is solid, as are the fries, and the short rib was pretty good, albiet a little stringy.\n\nAll in all, a solid place to come to unwind on a Friday night, if you don't mind the loud conversations going on around you, slightly overpriced food, and an amazing beer list!", "author": "David H."}

I am a big beer person and I have ALWAYS wanted to try this place. I ordered the Allagash White, from Witbier Allagash, Portland, ME. It was quite delicious. I wasn't able to handle much more (It was my birthday and we had a bit too much fun earlier), so we decided to come back for lunch the next day. Seeing the place in the day was great. I love the decor, the feel, and just about everything else. The next day I had one of the their burgers, which were really really good. They have this bacon jam that is just delicious. I also ordered a Aecht Schlenkerla Helles,  Smoked Helles Heller, which is one of the most interesting beers I have ever tasted. It had a smokey flavor and reminded me of being at a campfire.  This place has so many beers, and there isn't enough time in the day to try them all, so I will definitely be back.", "author": "Raquel A."}

I was surprised first by the service and then by the beer prices. I think this place's selection of beers has gone to it's head (or maybe they have horrible suppliers.) Most beers here are well over twice as much as other bars / restaurants and up to three or four times more than beer stores.\n\nTake the Aventinus (a wheat doppelbock) from Schneider-Weisse brewery in Germany for example.\n\nA 500ml bottle:\n$3 to $4 from stores like City Beer / Whole Foods\n$6 - from Lucky 13 (and even the \"Mission Dolores\" bar in Brooklyn)\n$8 - from Suppenk\u00fcche\n$12 - from Monk's Kettle\n\nHow can they charge this much? I could understand if they had cheap food, but their food hovers around 10+ for salads, 13+ for sandwiches, and 22+ for entr\u00e9es. The food was ok. I guess maybe they are trying to make this more of a dining experience then a beer destination, but with such a large beer selection, you would assume having a beer here would be easy. But this is not so. The place is always packed, narrow and if you're interested in a beer and some snacks, they'll stick you at the bar. Even toward the end of the night when a few friends and I wanted to sit at one of the 3 empty tables with some beers, they insisted that the tables were reserved for people eating dinner. Really? The place is winding down and you don't want our business? I guess the $100 or more we would spend drinking our beers in 20 minutes was just not enough for them.\n\nFor a better selection of beers and food, I'd go to La Trappe.", "author": "Alex L."}

After eliminating the millions of foods I'm either allergic to or just strongly dislike, he suggested I try the burger, sans bun, with a side of grilled polenta.  I added blue cheese and \"onion jam\" to the mix and was amazed to discover that this was quite possibly one of the best burgers I've ever had.

She told the same thing to another couple who then went somewhere else.  I would understand if it was a busy dinner service but this was 4:00 we're talking about.  Now if this happened twice in a minute, this must happen all the time and the owners should definitely know about this, which explains the single star. \n\nI hope I can finally go here again and not get treated like I'm lucky to be there.

Two stars for the beer...and for the big pretzel.  \n\nWhere I take issue is with the size of the place and with the staff.  We went here last night to celebrate my fiance's birthday.  There were 8 of us.  We were told that all 8 needed to be present to get a table, but that we couldn't be seated together.  Ohhh Kaaaay. It actually worked out fine, but don't plan on coming here with a group larger than 6.  The host literally had no idea what to do with all of us. \n\nOnce we were seated (after well over 90 minutes and several expensive beers from the bar), we were rushed to order dinner immediately. We had planned on a nice, leisurely dinner where we could drink, catch up and just enjoy hanging out.  Instead, after our plates had been cleared, our server informed us that he had been instructed by his manager to \"move the table along\" because there was a very long wait and he couldn't just let us sit there and drink.  With all 8 of us consuming beer after expensive beer, I couldn't believe that the management would effectively kick us out because we didn't want to order any more food, but that's exactly what happened. After waiting an inane amount of time for a table, we were hustled through dinner and then shuffled out the door after expressing that, YES, we wished to spend more money there.\n\nFine, jokers. We made a quick decision to take our little group 3 door up the street to Gestalt.  \n\nBut before we left, I made a quick stop at the bathroom (seriously, there's ONE bathroom in the whole place). I overheard our server bitching and moaning to a coworker about my fiance and the conversation they had about the table.  Look, I get it...I've been a server and I've certainly complained about a customer or two, but I ALWAYS made sure that the customer was not within earshot of my whining.\n\nGestalt is a bigger bar, with more space and cheaper beer.  We promptly ordered 3 LITRES of HopStoopid for a grand total of $18.  Granted, you won't get quite the selection that you'd find down the street, but I'll gladly take a reduced beer menu and decent service of Gestalt any day over the pretension and poor management of Monk's Kettle.", "author": "Jayne G."}

We were wrong. They have an overwhemingly (is that even a word) enormous selection of imported beers that I had never heard of.  Fortunately, one of the bartenders walked us through the menu and helped us find some real gems.  Seriously, he was incredibly helpful and answered all nine thousand questions we shot at him about the various beers.  The people there were generally super nice.  My favorite was the Echte Kriekenbier Brouwerij Verhaeghe (sour ale and, yes, I just copy/pasted the name from the website).  \n\nAlthough there are many options on the menu that are under $10, some of the beers on the list can be pretty expensive.  For instance, all of our eyes initially went to the Lambics but at $15-61 a bottle, we decided against it.  It helped us branch out in the end, but just know that this is not the place to go if you're looking for cheap beer.  You go for the good stuff. \n\nWe also tried the pretzel (which was on last year's list).  I'll admit it. I have never been a fan of pretzels. I always have thought that they are unnecessary carb overloads. However, the pretzel at Monk's Kettle was absolutely fantastic.  Everything about it was perfect.  Even better than the pretzel was that mustard that it came with.  I've always loved mustard, but I never knew that mustard could be that fabulous.  Put them together and you've got a whole lot of awesome going on in your mouth.  \n\nAll in all, we stopped at eight places on our fooding trip around the Mission and this was our favorite.  The place was cute, the atmosphere was fun, the people were nice, the beers were great, etc.  There wasn't much seating, so I can imagine that if you're not there early afternoon like we were, it'd be pretty crowded.  Nevertheless, I'd love to come back to Monk's Kettle and try the food.  The pictures of the hamburgers have made me particularly hungry as I write this review.", "author": "Alea G."}

They place less emphasis on their food than on their beer assortment. \n\nImported beers are overpriced by about 30%. I am overwhelmed by all the beers they offer. However, their draughts are all local and bottled beers mainly come from Belgium. I feel you should concentrate the list more on a few specific brands and offer a broader variety from different top beer brewing countries. Why not stock Czech beer? Why not have a few more German lagers and some British ales? \n\nThe food is kept simple and straight forward. Decent, but nothing to rave about. The \"Bretzl\", should not just be served with dips... omfg! The Bretzl is NEVER the main dish, guys. Bread dipped in mayonaisse is kids food!  If you really wann do the Bavarian thing, then do it properly and serve a Bavarian breakfast dish: Paulaner or Augustiner Weiss Bier with a Weisswurst, sweet honey mustard and a Bretzl on the side. \n\nUnderstandably, their wine list sucks. But, honestly, there never is an excuse to not offer good value house reds and whites by the glass. The wines on offer I would actually use to clean the bar and drains with. \n\nAtmosphere is great.

I know, I'm so gangsta.\n\nI get it, the whole gastropub thing is totally trendy right now, but please don't let that scare you away from hitting this place up.  I discovered Monk's about two years ago and it's still one of my favorite places to grab a beer at in the City. Oh, and in case you're wondering, the \"City\" is a cool slang term that only San Francisco hipsters like me are allowed to use.\n\nNow why do I like this place so much?  Well I'm glad you asked bitches.  Peep it:\n\nBEER SELECTION:  Dope!  Seriously, if you like beer hit this place up.  The selection is ridiculously awesome.  Don't believe me?  Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch check it out:  http://www.monkskettle.com/images/beer.pdf  \n\nWhenever I go here, I always go with the Signature Ale, Santa's Little Helper (sorry folks, I'm a huge Christmas nerd) and/or the Orval Trappist Ale.  I also have to give a special shout-out to the Hitachino Red Rice Ale.  It's not as good as the other beers I just mentioned, but what kind of Half-Asian would I be if I didn't name drop it in my review?  Besides, I would never disrespect my family or the Shaolin Temple.\n\nSERVICE STAFF:  The service here is always awesome.  The place gets pretty busy, but the staff is very attentive and you never feel neglected.  More importantly, all of the male service staff members always seem to be sporting some really cool facial hair.  Suspicious or mysterious?  You decide!  That being said, I wish I could grow a beard. :(\n\nFOOD:  The beer selection is awesome, the wait staff is efficient and the layout of the bar is cool.  So that must mean the food is horrible, right?  Well, here's the kicker, you blow up the third statue (that was for you Nate)...er...what was I talking about again?  Oh yeah, the kicker is that the food is actually really good too.  Dare I even use the word AMAZEBALLS.  Okay, I will.  AMAZEBALLS!  Yup, Monk's has some awesome grub and most of their items compliment the beer that they offer on their menu perfectly.  Just like Oprah, here are a few of my favorite things from it:\n\nThe Premium Gold Lamb Burger - It's served with lettuce, tomatoes, fresh red onions and a cucumber mint tzatziki sauce on a Metropolis sesame bun.  Yup, it's the tits.  You also have to make sure you eat this while drinking either a ESB or the Belgian Strong Pale beer.\n\nThe Giant Pretzel with stone ground mustard and house-made cheddar ale sauce or the Fries with chipotle ketchup, herbed aioli and curry aioli.  You're in a bar right?  So how can you resist the bar food classics like fries and pretzels?  The answer to that...YOU CAN'T!  I'd suggest eating these items while drinking any of the Pale Ales they offer.\n\nThe Premium Gold Angus' Flank Steak - It's grilled to order and served on a Metropolis Italian baguette with blue cheese aioli and organic baby arugula.  Yup, it's aces.  It tastes like an elf dipped in Unicorn blood, which we all know is OBVIOUSLY DELICIOUS!  I'd recommend having any of the Pale Ales or Dry Porter with this burger.  Believe Dat!\n\nPot Pies - So the pot pies change week-to-week and you don't know what they're going to be serving until you get there.  In the past, I was lucky enough to get the Scallop and Lobster pies.  Both of them were AMAZING and if you wanted a \"different\" type of meal to go with your beers, I'd say to give one of these bad boys a try.\n\nDESSERT - Sorry boys and girls, I haven't had desert here yet, BUT don't trip, I have had a couple of their Desert BEERS.  OH SNAP!  You should totally check out the Midas Touch Golden Elixir and/or the Mirror Mirror.  I got both of these beers because I liked their names.  I wish I had a cooler reason then that, but I don't, so deal with it.  However, you'll be happy to know that both of the beers are good, and you should totally try one of them if you are in the mood for a sweet tasting brew.\n\nWell there you have it, the awesomeness that is Monk's.  I've always aspired to be a beer drinker, but growing up, I always preferred hard liquor.  I guess it had something to do with the fact that I could get faded without having to:\n\n1.  Fill my stomach up with all of that beer.\n2.  Feel super fat and sluggish while I'm drunk.\n3.  Use the bathroom (piss on a tree or alley) every 10 minutes.\n\nAs I've gotten older, I really started appreciating what beer is all about.  I guess I started looking at it in a different light when I discovered that there is more to beer then just Schlitz, Mickey's and Old English.  Monk's is really one of those places that helped me appreciate how great beer can be.  So just like Da Band did for Mysterious, I gotta big up Monk's Kettle for hooking that shizzle up.  DY-LAN! DY-LAN! DY-LAN! AND DY-LAN!  In other words, Monk's beer selection is just like my Jean-Claude Van Damme DVD collection, huge, awesome and Belgian.\n\nHOLLER.", "author": "Ray-Ray B."}

Luckily she got there early and put in our name so we could grab a beer across the street. They were nice enough to call her cell phone once our table was ready so we popped over and were seated right away. \n\nThe place is really really small but somehow the staff makes it work.

Like I said, it's small so there isn't a ton of seating and the tables are small and very close together. However, I liked the crowd that was there that night. 20-30 somethings filled the place with lively chatter. \n\nEnough about the ambiance, now the food. The menu is very interesting and offers an array of dishes to satisfy your taste buds. We ordered an appetizer which was seared goat cheese, spinach and bread. I love goat cheese and this was great goat cheese. I then ordered the Lamb burger with fries and it was exceptional. I was really impressed because it was cooked just right and I loved the flavor of the meat and bread; nothing else was needed. I also tried some beer but I can't remember which one. What is really great is that they have beer and food pairings on the menu to help you navigate through their extensive beer list.\n\nIt's kind of pricey place but the food was definitely worth it.

No phone or opentable reservations, usually 45-90 minutes wait if you arrive after 7pm.\n* The food isn't great. I've had a burger with overcooked crunchy bacon, a vege burger which was extremely bland, tasteless pasta, some other vege dish which was so dry it was unpleasant. It's trying too hard, it's not working, and it's not a one-off.\n* I understand that imported and/or speciality beer is expensive. I really do - I'm a veteran of beers of the world, festivals and such, but the pricing here is absurb. I really cannot bring myself to spend ~$25 per 24oz for something I could have bought 90% cheaper in the host country. Which brings me to my next point...\n\nThe ugly:\n* Feels like I'm being nickle-and-dimed for beer serving size. Some draught/cask beers are served in 20oz glasses, but other \"authentic\" British ales in 16oz. Yeah, those authentic British 16oz servings. Most ridiculous one was a stout costing about $12 for 6oz. It wasn't a joke, but should have been.\n\nNow that I've been an SF resident a little longer, I don't find Monk's Kettle as unique as I did at first. You can have a similar experience in plenty of other bars in town, at a fraction of the cost, without all the pretense, and albeit with a much smaller menu.\n\n(Edit: I write British 20oz servings, which is pretty much authentic - I meant 16oz was wrong :)", "author": "John R."}

We ended walking out and finding a different venue due to the staff.  To start, the host/doorman's attitude was very pompus, rude and showed no care for customers.  When I told him that we had a party of ten, he immediately told me that only 2 people would be able to let in the restaurant, and the remaining party would have to wait outside.  Since it was early, and my party had not arrived, I asked if we could sit at the bar.  He said that was ok, but again, if any more of my party came, they would have to wait outside.  While he was saying this, parties of 3 and 4 were walking in without any problems.  So, as we are sitting down, we decided to put our name down for a table of 5 because not everyone wanted to eat.  Being people who work in the industry, we wanted to compromise, where we had a table for the few that wanted to eat, and the others would remain at the bar.  Instead of working with us, he flat out refused to take my name down for the waitlist.  \n\nThen, my friend did come, her hands were full as she walked in the door.  We were sitting at the end of the bar neat the door, and i made some room for her to put her bags down.  The host/doorman proceeded to come up to her and say, \"Excuse me, in this place, we ID\" and pulled attitude that she did not have her ID out fast enough.  Again, identifying her, while people walked in without issue.  \n\nAfter all of this, talking to the bartender was also an exprience.  I noted that it was my birthday, not for any \"free\" item, but because I was in the festive mood.  She looked back at me, and said, \"Honey, I hear THAT a lot\" and just walked away.\n\nI understand the establishment is small.  I understand that they are busy.

The joints that are all the rage there are known as \"gastropubs\". Simply put, a gastropub is a bar/pub with good food. \n\nThe Monk's Kettle is wonderful because it's so consistent: the food is terrific, the service is excellent, and the location is in the heart of the Mission district. The only thing consistent about the place that always peeves me and those dining with me is the wait. But, let me tell you friends, the place is well worth it (hell, go to Elixir for a few cocktails and everything in the world is right again). Starters like their baked goat's cheese and beet salad are phenomenal. They have a tasty and lean lamb burger (I loves me some lamb) that I find myself ordering time and time again.\n\nThe place is great for date night or a night out with friends. I strongly recommend making reservations if you plan to dine there on either a Friday or Saturday night.", "author": "Rodney P."}

The wedge, was a mess, completely submerged in gloppy dressing. Fries, were good. Mac N Cheese was a total fail, had to remove the top from the salt shaker and give it a full seasoning. It merely consisted of the same cheese sauce from the pretzel poured over elbow macaroni with some bread crumbs. The ale cheese sauce makes sense with the salty pretzel, but was very bland with macaroni. Nobody was disappointed with the chili.\n\nThis is a brewpub, that serves pub quality fare.

Deliver me from the evils of my job, and thank all that is holy for the respite of your gastropub cloister. I'm eternally grateful.\n\nI don't think I'm alone in these sentiments - your packed house every night is a testament to how well you're being received.  Over 600 reviews on Yelp is also telling.  You've got our attention.  What's more, San Francisco seems to be enamored with your extensive selection of beers, your persona, and your pub grub (some of which is de-lish).  \n\nThat nearly a third of the past 100 reviews are either mixed or disgruntled is a bit more prognosticating.  Be wary of shifts like this in customer satisfaction.  Your service, refined and helpful that it is, shows signs of wear - you've copped a bit of 'tude, and it's not quite what one hopes to find at a place that bills itself as once or twice removed from a monastery.  You can be high brow about recommending hard to find brews, but you shouldn't stray into snob territory.  And, that your \"host/hostess\" is misconstrued as a bouncer (or worse, vice versa) is going to further act as a deterrent.  You're not a club, you're a pub.  Pub's don't need bouncers, just ornery bar wenches that will soundly put you in your place when, for example, you reach behind the bar to refill your own glass.  (I would know nothing about this.)  \n\nNext, your prices are riding a very thin line between what's acceptable given the quality/selection and what's slightly insulting.  Do you really need to overcharge when you're raking it in hand over fist?  Your food is great, prices notwithstanding.  I agree that the pot pie, the mac and cheese, and the pulled pork sammy are the perfect medicine when imbibing vast quantities of perfectly fermented brews.  But really, $8 for a pretzel?  Here's a thought: serve them for $5 from a street cart outside the front door to the people waiting in line to get in.  You're guaranteed to placate people for the long wait, and then your pretzels will sell like hotcakes.  Otherwise, as a stand-alone side dish, it's really not all it's built up to be.\n\nLastly, I still love you.  I can bear with the lines, the waits, and the crowds just for the pleasure of your selection of beers and your grub.  But do us a favor and lighten up.  Life's too short, and we'd like you to stick around for it. \n\nAmen, brothers.", "author": "Nils E."}

This is a top of the line beer bar! They've got some really remarkable beers. They had Old Rasputin XI nearly two years after it's release and Duvel Green. The problem? Their beers are insanely expensive. This is in no way cheap, and not even a little pricey, it's damn expensive ($14 for some 8 oz pours)! Look at some of the bottle prices and you'll see my point. Which makes me think that it clearly is catering to an older crowd.\n\nThe establishment itself is very nice. Lot's of wood, with a beautiful bar! Proper glassware is served with all the beers.\n\nThe tap list really isn't the best I've seen, but it's good enough that it makes me interested. The bottle selection is really where they shine. I really wish they weren't so expensive, cause some of them are fucking gems! Yes, they have their fair share of very pedestrian beers, which are slightly more reasonably priced.

The host, waiting service, and staff made this the MOST AWKWARD dinner I have ever had. Similar to other comments, I met a group of friends there but were told the party was too large.  The host was quite hostile about us not squeezing people in at the table and said if he had known the party was so big they would have told us to go somewhere else. \n\nWe honestly respected that there are fire codes and it's a small place, but we tried to have one person stand at the end of the table, out of the way. We had the waiter say it was ok, then another staff member come and said it's not ok and the waiter was \"just being diplomatic.\"\n\nWe ordered appetizers and a round of beers and were talking when the waiter came up to our table and asked if we were going to order anything else. We said we weren't sure and then he said that the host should have told us that we have to order dinner. We understood that they have a busy establishment, and were going to order more food/drinks until the waiter said, \"Everyone would like to sit at a booth all night and drink a few beers, but our wait list is three hours long... but go ahead and finish your beers at your own pace...\" \n\nWe spent no more than an hour there and they made it clear that they wanted us OUT because we were not running up the tab fast enough. We really wanted a second round of beers but decided they clearly do not deserve/want our business -- I do have to mention that our tab was still close to $200 after that one round and three appetizers (including the more than generous tip we still left).\n\nHonestly, I am not picky about service at restaurants, but I have never been to any restaurant where they are so blatantly rude!

The beer selection is great and the food is amazing.  You can find great limited beers like The Bruery Papier and Russian River Supplication way after they're gone from all local stores.\n\nUnfortunately for most of us who aren't Bill Gates, the Google founders, a big-time professional athlete, or an evil, greedy investment banking executive, money is a thing.  Well, that is, until we go to Monk's Kettle.  After that, the thing in our wallets that was originally a bunch of money will have completely disappeared.\n\nThis place is really, really, ridiculously expensive.  Bottles of beer that you can get for $12 at City Beer, Healthy Spirits, or even Toronado are going to run you damn near $40 here.  They mark up beer like most nice restaurants do with wine.  Now let me just say as an aside that the reason I have a problem with this is not because beer is an inferior product.  I think a great beer is at least the equal of a great wine.  I just think that 2.5x or higher wine mark-ups are insane and people are crazy to pay them, and I enjoy the fact that great beer can still be had with a great meal for a reasonable price.  Not at Monk's Kettle.  You're going to be paying (and I read directly from their beer list) $35 for an AleSmith Speedway Stout (usually $12), $11.25 for a Duvel (usually $3.50), and $28 for a Lost Abbey Judgment Day (usually $10).\n\nReading these prices off their menu is really quite startling.  Makes you jump out of your seat and yell, \"Shit dogg!\"  For you British people out there, that's roughly the equivalent of \"Blimey!\" or \"Crikey!\" or \"Crimony!\" or \"Blikony!\" or whatever you crazy people say.  They occasionally have a half-price happy hour where their prices actually fall into the same range as City Beer's or Toronado's.  This is the only time I'd recommend going here if you just want good beer.  Otherwise there are far better options nearby (see 2 sentences before this).\n\nHowever, if you can take the wallet hit and want to impress someone with great food paired with world class beer, this is the place.  I had some really excellent food there.  There simply aren't many things better than great beer and great food.  Last time I went, I had a charcuterie plate, a creamy bowl of tomato soup, and a pulled pork sandwich, along with a La Trappe Isid'Or, a Ballast Point Sculpin IPA, and an '05 North Coast Old Stock Ale (reasonably priced surprisingly!).  All were incredible.  Monk's Kettle can really wow you, but you're going to have to hand over the majority of your paycheck for the pleasure.  Oh yeah, and it gets crowded and they don't typically take reservations.  Go before 6:30 for a weekend dinner unless you want to wait hours for a table.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm heading to Monk's Kettle to shell out $85 for a beer dinner.  D'oh!\n\n*Final note: I should also add Jermaine Dupri and Jay-Z to the list of people who don't think money is a thing, since they had a song specifically called, \"Money Ain't a Thing.\"", "author": "Nick D."}

The beef and turkey burgers here are also very good, and I still reminisce over a seafood pot pie I had here over a year ago which was a morsel of divine inspiration (monks, please please bring it back!).  I want to go back to try the lobster pot pie they are currently featuring.\n\nService can be hit or miss, especially when the place gets crowded, which is the only thing that keeps this place from 5 stars.

There may be other universes based on all sorts of other principles, but ours seems to be based on beer and salty foods.  \n\nMonk's Kettle is a celebration of beer, a universe unto its own, as the 6-7 page beer menu denotes.\n\nBut there is food here as well. As lavish as the food is described on paper, and despite the attention paid to its preparation, it clearly plays second fiddle to the brews. Just compare the 2 page food menu to the beer menu, which is continuously updated and affixed to a clipboard. No chef can change the fact that a pretzel is a pretzel or a french fry is a french fry. It's really all about the beer, any foods are really pretense to embellish the experience of drinking fine imported beer.\n\nIs it always worth it? The crowds, the price? Almost unequivocally. Yet both are just prohibitive enough to  provoke serious second thoughts unless the night's agenda calls for beer, and extravagant beer at that. Then there is no question.

Don't ask me what we had after that, because I honestly don't remember.\n\nFor noshing we ordered the pretzel which was yummy and from what I hear much better than the last pretzel - but it was cold on the inside.  The daily pickle was vinegary and crunchy and refreshing.  Next was the buttermilk battered fried rabbit.  The flavor was delicious, but the rabbit was a little tough (and I know my rabbit, I grew up with old-world grandparents and a whole grip of bunnies that we raised for food.)

I exaggerate not.  45 minutes after spending almost $100 on a bottle of sparkling wine and two entrees, we were asked to vacate our table. \n\nDid I mention that, up until 5 minutes before we paid and left there was an empty table in the back!?!?!\n\nThis is perhaps the worst service and treatment I have received in my decade of living in San Francisco.\n\nI will not be back and will warn everyone I know to avoid Monks Kettle!", "author": "SL N."}

The bartenders had detailed answers for all of our questions about the brewing process and styles of beer.  For example, they taught us why Belgians are much better served by the bottle rather than by draft.  Their beer menu was impressive in terms of quality and rare-finds.  You can easily find a drink for $5, if you're willing to pass up the opportunity to have something better.  I liked that each section of the beer menu had an introductory page describing the history and process of making that particular style.

Probably not in principle.  But would you do it for connoisseur cred?  Then maybe you're one of the people crowded 4 deep in the couple-feet-wide space between the bar and the tables when I try to be fair and check out this revered little place before adding it to the most-overrated list.  Maybe you're even at Monk's right now.\n\nBut probably not if you're reading this.  So my advice is not to bother.  I've lost track of how many times I've tried to go to Monk's when well-intentioned friends who know I like a good beer suggest that we head there.  It has been between 5 and 10.  EVERY time we have struggled to make it inside the bar because of the crowd, no matter what day it is or how few of us there are in our group.  What then quickly becomes obvious is that no one on staff gives a shit whether you get anything - on a list for a table, a beer, any kind of acknowledgment.  You're on your own.  So if you can fight your way to the bar and get a bartender's attention, your reward is a high quality beer with a high price tag that you will clutch close to your chest because you are packed in tightly enough that you can't move your arms.\n\nAt least that's how it was until a few days ago.  I was on a walk around the neighborhood with my girlfriend, not even planning to get a beer, and passed by Monk's.  Almost no one there.  Huh?  Maybe we should get a beer?  I'm feeling wasteful, so I say yeah.  \n\nWe step in, answer the host (they have one?) that we'll just be having drinks and get asked for our IDs.  Now I'm not the type to complain about that practice, but my girlfriend and I are both very obviously at least 5 years older than the guy asking, no matter what his silly looking hipster \"ironic\" moustache has to say about it.  And it just so happened that she didn't have her ID.  Turned away.

Honestly the flavors weren't all too compelling, and the dish was way over salted.  I think the salmon was heavily salted, which when combined with the olive tapenade created a perfect storm of sodium.\n\nBut I will absolutely try them again.

They have a huge selection of beer.\n\nThis place has hipster cred: a billion upscale beers, and all the waiters are \"cool\" especially the guy who hangs out at the door sporting an extremely well-groomed 19th-century mustache.  At least, I assume he works there.  To be sure, I'm talking about well-groomed hipsters with decent-paying jobs.  You know, dot-com employees who commute from the city.  I think the accepted terminology is poseurs, which is nice because they aren't as annoying as \"authentic\" hipsters.\n\nThe menu features a few different burgers, presided over by an executive chef so they're a bit pricey to boot, but not hysterically so.  It would have been nice if instead of shoestrings they served fat Belgian-style frites, maybe with a mayonnaise-based sauce, but then I was recently spoiled by such a place in Philadelphia so one can dismiss my pretensions.\n\nThe most memorable part of the meal was when the girlfriend asked if she could have a Coke or Pepsi, and the waiter explained that they didn't have those commercial beverages, but they could serve her a Jones Cola.  Later, it took a waiter some minutes to make change, as he seemed stymied by having to interact with the newfangled late-20th century electronic arithmetic device.

When you ask someone what kind of beer they like and then proceed to tell them that what they like isn't good, it isn't helpful, it's belittling. One of the biggest reasons I prefer beer is that it lacks the pretentiousness of wine (not that all wine drinkers are pretentious, but it is hard to talk about wine without coming off snooty).

We only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, during which time we enjoyed our first beers of the night. I have to say, I loved everything about this place, so there won't be any negative comments in this review, just pure adoration.\n\nOnce seated we started off with the pretzel that everyone and their mom has raved about on yelp, as well as the french fries (I have a hollow leg when it comes to french fries...

They offer the option to replace the fries with a side salad, which was definitely a great choice after having fries for an app. Our meals were delicious! My pork was amazing, being from the south, I have been craving BBQ for some time now and this helped to satisfy it just a bit. We weren't able to finish our entrees (again due to sharing two apps between two people, waaaaaaaay to much food).\n\nBesides the food, there were various other factors that won me over about this place. First off, they have a beer list that goes on for miles... but rather than an overwhelming list of names you can't pronounce, there is an organization about them that helps a beer novice like myself make a more educated guess as to what to order. AND they have gone out of their way to pair all of the food on the menu with a beer, even the apps! Such a nice touch! The waitstaff is incredibly friendly and helpful, especially when it came to deciding what to order.\n\nOverall, I really loved the layout of the restaurant, you don't feel like you're on top of each other, it has a very balanced layout.

To a beer enthusiast the menu is rich and has a lot of depth, and is exciting, if not overwhelming to go through.  For a \"lite\" beer drinker you may want to save your money and go to 7-11.  The menu will confuse you.  If you are an enthusiast, you will welcome it.\n\nI dare say I was a bit slackjawed by our server.... elegant but informal... .  She was knowledgeable, informative -- professional but not too familiar.  Adjectives shmadjectives.  We liked her quite a bit, yes we did.  Possibly as she was incredibly warm & cute as a button\n\nFood... could have dropped the stars here, but I am not going to mess with an awesome chef that has a vision in a wonderful restaurant, or one that wears tie dye pants.  Burger and bacon was a bit overcooked, and the burger sat on an artisan bun that dwarfed the burger.  It wasn't nearly enough to actual consider caring about... I ate my blue cheese bacon avacado burger with messy relish (but no *actual* relish.. yes I like homonyms)\n\nMy reviews are stupid long, I know I need to rap it up.\n\nWe got the cheese plate with slices of bread a wee bit too large for the cheese offering, and a large portion of candied walnuts and a few chiffonade thin slices of apple.  I would have like to see a bit more creativity or depth on it... but the Bleu d'Auvergne and Double Gloucester were quite good.\n\nThe last point brings me to the Mission.  I don't venture there at night, I just become a judgemental bastard.  What is it with me... I listened to far worse music and dressed far worse than these people intoning various dead subcultures, but I just don't get it.  It's like a cultural dead end.\n\nWhatever the case, you are in a place where they have spent unnecessary hours toiling on phone calls with distributors, working hard to get incredible beers from all over... \n\nand this chump walks in and orders a PBR.  I mean... Delirium and their funky illegal ass grillin' is across the bloody street.  I am sad that I am at a stage where this innocent chap who has done know wrong gets judged by me.  Trust me I am working on it.... \n\nbut PBR?  at Monk's Kettle?  It's like walking into the Louvre and immediately asking for Thomas Kinkade or Dale Chihuly.", "author": "Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X."}

Now I understand if you were full, or perhaps if it was 9 or so with a line out the door, but your doorman looked so bored with no line and there were 3 tables open and the bar had no seats for us.  But I didn't want to fight so we said \"Ok\"\n\nNext we were greeted by Pepe the awkward large man with the small beret... Who did not say Hi or good evening, but rather gave us the menus and told us we had to have small plates and not snacks... I was confused because you had always been a bar to me with great snacks, I was lost  :(\n\nBut again not wanting a scene we ordered what we could, the cheese platter with burnt baguette chips, the watered down soup, and the $8 organic salad made from what looked like Trader Joe's ingredients in one of their oh so delicious prepackaged containers (A great lunch I must add and twice as much portion as MK)  Pepe was not pleased I think he was hoping we would all order the large plates...\n\nAnd when we peppered poor Pepe with questions like \"What kind of Pilsners do you have?\"  He replied with \"Lots\"  which was the extent of his english, he only spoke in sentences with 7 words maximum, and brought out the most expensive one he could find... He definitely graduated from upsell academy!\n\nAnd then you forgot one of the beers, which is completely forgivable, it happens to all of us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-28", "description": "For those of you who have frequented Monk's Kettle over the years and are shaking your heads at my two-stars, I think you should go one more time to understand the disappointment that is the new Monk's Kettle.  I can only guess that Monk's landlord has either raised their rent through the roof, that the talent at Monk's has gone and started a good restaurant elsewhere (Oakland), or they've been quietly purchased by Applebee's.\n\nI think I'll start by talking about the pretzel.  if there is one thing besides beer that people think of when they hear Monk's Kettle, it's the pretzel.  When the waiter dropped what I can only describe as a dinner roll on a fancy plate in front of me, the looks from the regulars around the restaurant suggested that we were experiencing a collective mourning for what had been a decent restaurant.  I don't know if it used to be made in house, but the \"pretzel\" has been outsourced to some bakery that I'm sure is inexpensive and delivers on time.  And that amazing stone-ground mustard sauce that would follow you into your dreams at night they've turned into watered-down Frenches.  I remember that mustard used to sometimes catch your nose and you'd gasp.  It doesn't do that anymore.  Is the \"pretzel\" any cheaper you ask.  Guess.  It just amazes me that they would destroy something which is such a core part of their brand.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, the menu has changed in a bad way.  Its all bland boring food whose basic components at Chinese restaurant would be $5, $6 a plate but you dress it in a different oil and throw in some French words and suddenly you're in for $17.  And I don't say that lightly.  All the components are things that can hang out in a refrigerator for a while, nothing that had to be fresh that day, and no skill required in anything they're doing.  Their entire kitchen staff could quit tomorrow morning and by the afternoon, they could have a new group of guys producing the same food.  Hence my Applebee's jab earlier.\n\nAs for beer, as for Monk's just as a bar and accepting that the food has become secondary, I don't even think Monk's succeeds there anymore either.  If you really know beer, you know all the brands, how it's made, etc., Monk's probably has something special for you.  For the majority who don't fall into that niche, the wait staff is going to push you to keep having beers that are pretty expensive and you probably won't appreciate.  It's not a place for discovery.  I think the economics of running a bar in the Mission have pushed places toward having expensive beers which allow high margins and then, for some reason, PBR so they maintain some ridiculous street cred.   So, on this point, I can't single out Monk's.  At the same time I think the beer I had was $13 for an 8oz pour.  And if I could remember the name one of you might point out that its some rare special beer, but whatever.\n\nIf there's one thing I'd like to express in this review, it's my disappointment.  It's one thing in the Mission that was once special and is now not.  And it's part of a trend that you see in places like Grub and B3 where it's all marketers and sales people, but no artisans.  I guess its all part of the changing economics of businesses in the Mission, but still, I would have liked one last pretzel.", "author": "Luke C."}

A four top by the street window was waiting for us to come.  It had previously ensconced itself in a wholly noxious musk, but when we walked in, the host found that the table was glowing with invitation and promptly sat us down, the rest of the place completely stacked with human-folk and perhaps a beatnick yeti or two.\n\nThe beer list is four or five pages long.  Their tap selection is average, really, when compared to the best (in Southern California, at least, and Falling Rock in Denver or Monk's Cafe in Philly), and their bottle selection is pretty good, especially for Belgian brews (hence the kettle being chattel of a monk, I suppose).  Because it is not always available down south, I availed myself of three imperial (yes, imperial, sweet!) pints of Pliny the Elder from Russian River, wincing at eschewing the Belgian specialty of the place just slightly.\n\nThe server was knowledgeable of the beers and was able to provide good advice to a fellow diner in a very friendly and helpful manner.\n\nThe food was a hit.  The menu is not very large but everything seems worth ordering.  We decided to start with a cheese plate, matching a blue cheese with Iberico cheese.  They complement the cheese with pear slices, a wedge of preserves, candied walnuts, honey, and balsamic reduction.  With flavorful beers, this is an excellent choice.\n\nThe locals went with the big pork chop doused with a mustard cream sauce and accompanied with a potato cake and brussels sprouts and bacon.  A beauty and they were not dissatisfied in the least.  It became two meals for one of them.\n\nI went with the lobster pot pie, which was served with a big, square, fluffy, puff pastry and greens atop, and Sooz with the skirt steak with a red wine shallot butter, demi-glace, mixed greens salad, and fries.  The pot pie was a traditional pot pie except for the puff pastry, which was a tad difficult to incorporate into the dish but worth the work, and the large, luscious chunks of lobster.  Comfort food yet new food.  Very cool.  The skirt steak was perfectly cooked, very flavorful, and I liked the taste of the fries mingled with the demi-glace.  \n\nFor how crowded it was, service was pretty good.

You can just sit down at the bar, tell the bartender what kind of beer you'd like (malty, not too strong, with a bit of hops), and they'll present you with a tasty beverage fitting your requirements (a nice American Brown, for example). They will also give you a glass of water and refill it diligently when you decide to go through a couple of Imperial Stouts in a row.\n\nNow, I see there have been several complaints that Monk's will only seat people if they are having food. I have no particular problem with this -since they only have a few tables it makes sense for them to save it for dining patrons. And you should try to dine here, because the food is quite good most of the time. Sure, I didn't care for a couple of things one time or another, but it's very consistent overall.\n\nThe decor and ambience are really nice, especially the wall of glassware behind the bar. And yes, they will match the glass to your particular beer whenever possible. Belgian Strong Dark ales just don't taste the same in a regular pint glass. I also love the chalkboard that anyone can write on and suggest the beers for the menu.\n\nMonk's has a twitter account (@monkskettle) and they post daily to announce the menu specials and the new beers on tap. One thing to note is that some of the beers are overpriced, meaning that you could get the same beer elsewhere for cheaper. e.g. Duchesse du Bourgogne is $12 vs $7 at Shotwell's a few blocks away. I'd suggest going for the draft menu first as it has the best bang for the buck.\n\nOverall, this is a really nice addition to the gastropub line-up in San Francisco (La Trappe, Magnolia, etc) and I'm looking forward to the exclusive 5-course beer-pairing dinner they are doing this Wednesday.", "author": "Andrei Z."}

There are better beer places out there in SF. My only gripe is that i felt so ripped off after. The bartender introduced my friend and I to a $20 beer from the cellar. Raving about the taste and complexity. Sure enough we caved in and bought one. The taste was phenomenal. 3 years later I go back and the price was the same, figured this is the way it works with quality beer. Just today after having dinner in Santa CLara 45minutes from SF, I ventured into my neighborhood liquor store due to the \"we carry microbrew beer\" sign outside. Sure enough there it was, the $20 beer. However this time the white rectangular sticky price tag on top of the cap was $6.99, WTF?!", "author": "Corey T."}

The selection of beer is impressive, and I guess that causes the prices to go up for alcohol. But that really does not excuse the prices for food. \n\nI had the turkey burger, which was large and tasty. But it was not $11.50 tasty. It is a burger and fries. There was no fois gras or truffle on the thing - it was a turkey patty on a decent bun. Fries were thin and crispy. The giant pretzel was indeed giant, but it really just tasted like an over sized Superpretzel that you could get at the ballpark. And again for $8, I would be happier getting a mall pretzel for $3. \n\nI did enjoy the names of some of the beers. My friends ended up ordering \"Pliny the Elder\" and \"Poppy Jasper\" mainly because they sounded like Lord of the Rings characters. However the verdict was that while the names were whimsical, the beer was pretty meh. Monk's Kettle is really small and the place fills up quickly so I recommend going early or on off-peak times to get a table.

Obviously this does not seem to be a problem for their business based on how crowded it was when I went there to meet a friend on a Friday night. I dig Flemish brew and was anxious to try it out. I guess it is a case of supply and demand and as long as there is demand they can charge what the market will bare, but I felt like I was getting shafted. The food was also good but overpriced for what you got. \n\nThis leads me to my next point. The high prices probably reflect the demographics of the patrons, which at this point appear to be high-paid Marina/Fi-Di types who expect/don't care if they are being ripped off. Hard to fight against that.\n\nMy third issue was how openly rude/hostile much of the staff was. This place is hella crowded and when I was standing near the door the bearded-one bartender said to me in a wormy little voice: \"Excuuuuse YOu!\" I guess I was in his way. I would have taken off right then an there if I hadn't been waiting for a friend. More rude, patronizing help than I could shake a dead cat at. \n\nIn summary, the experience was very much full of the monied douchebaggy \"New Mission.\" I guess my kind is no longer welcome around there anymore.", "author": "Christopher V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-15", "description": "Amongst beer joints in San Francisco, Monk's Kettle outshines most others, as far as selection goes.  \n\nThe first time I walked into this place, I was handed a 4 page menu with small fonts, listing page after page of beers.  Beer, beer, and MORE beer!  \n\nGenerally, they have on tap approximately 20 or so beers, and the rest of the menu consists of bottled beers from, literally, all over the world.  Belgium is the superstar of this menu, but basically, if there's a particular type of beer you like, you can rest assured that Monk's Kettle has it or a version of it on their menu.  This secures them a strong 4-star rating from me.\n\nWhat throws them into the 5-star category is that their food is quite outstanding as well!\n\nIt's a small place, which always leaves me scratching my head as to where they can store all the kegs they must need, and you can basically peer into the tiny kitchen from the bar.  But what that kitchen can pump out is SERIOUSLY impressive.\n\nTheir burgers are delicious, large and piled high with a huge, juicy chunk of ground beef.  Their fries are fresh, and while they are rather thin-cut for my liking, I have to admit that they are tasty nonetheless.  Their pork chop was fabulous, and while this is not normally a dish I'd order with my food, this is where Monk's Kettle begins to emerge as a \"restaurant\" more than a bar.  Their steak was also delicious, cooked as requested.  \n\nBut best of all from that tiny little kitchen is their Giant Pretzel.  Seriously - with whatever beer you choose off of their menu, this is something you MUST order and try.  Served with several dipping sauces, this piping hot pretzel is precisely what your abdominal cavity craves as you sip down your outstanding foreign beer.\n\nGenerally speaking, I usually order stouts or porter here.  The bartenders are always very friendly and more than willing to offer you tastes of a variety of beers.  They are also really knowledgeable about their beers, which is crucial if you're going to offer hundreds of beers to your patrons.  I've followed their recommendations often without disappointment.  They also stock Delirium, usually on tap, which is perhaps the best thing to come out of Belgium, ever!\n\nIt's small, and it's packed here.  Parking is impossible from Thursday to even Sundays, which is typical of the Mission.  It can be noisy, and on some nights, what they call \"standing room only\" is reminiscent of a sardine can - if you can even get in at all.  Still, I find that Monk's Kettle is one of my favorite hangouts in the city, which, I guess, says it all.\n\nIt's worth whatever you have to endure to have a drink or meal here!", "author": "Grace K."}

Best to try to get a table or grab a seat at the bar; otherwise standing room is not really an option. But the look and feel is very authentic. The bar is classic, sleek, but with a bunch of surrounding oak making it have a more manly feel whilst keeping it elegant.\n\nThe group of us all grabbed beers from their never-ending list of beers (ranges from $7 to $50+) and had the following munchees:\n\nAppetizers:\n- Giant pretzel - so warm, perfect softness, and GIANT! The accompanying cheddar ale sauce and stone ground mustard made the pretzel complete; a lil' hint of cheddar, with a quick lil' kick from the stone ground mustard\n- Elbow macaroni n cheese - uses the same cheddar ale sauce as from the giant pretzel. To be honest, although that sauce was paired phenomenally with the pretzel, it wasn't enough to satisfy me as part of the mac n cheese. It was a little too mild/bland, more cheddar was necessary.\n\nDinner: I can't remember what everyone else got but I ended up just getting the wedge salad (I was craving it). It came out looking fine, but for some reason didn't satiate that craving I was having for it. Something was a bit off, I think I had wanted a couple of more tomatoes or something; and there was too much bacon.\n\nI think overall I give this place a 4 because of the atmosphere and the EXTENSIVE beer list (BIG BIG BIG LOVER of beer...so i'm a little biased). I definitely want to head back and have more of a meal instead of just a salad. They have an intriguing menu, each item with a beer pairing, so I'll definitely need to head back. Only thing that kind of bugged me is the price. The beer price, ok understandable since they are rare/unknown/imported/etc. but $11 for a salad and $12 for a side appetizer sized mac n cheese seemed a bit crazy to me.

We were quickly seated and given the extensive beer list (we were told the kitchen was closed) and waited.  \n\nI didn't mind having a moment to look over the beer list, but we were given more than ample time before the waiter returned, took the orders for three of our crowd of 6 and then left.  Wait, what?  Ten minutes later he came back (it was now 1:20am) and finally took my order, which arrived another 6-8 minutes later (now 1:28am).  Upon delivering and opening the bottle of Russian River Salvation Batch 5, he knocked over one of the other bottles beer on the tables.  Considering the cost of these beers, we were expecting some recompense, but only really got a bar towel and a meek apology.\n\nTo make matters worse, I was given less than 20 minutes to polish off the 750ml bottle of 9% ABV beer with one other person before being booted out because, as it turns out, the clock there runs ten minutes fast (so according to them, I received my beer at 1:40, not 1:30 and needed to be out of there by their 2am).\n\nAll in all, the beer was great, the service was highly mediocre, and the clock needs to be set to the right time (my watch was set to the atomic clock in Colorado, the official govt time, a few days prior, and being a Japanese digital watch, it wasn't wrong)...only in SF do bars intentionally close EARLY.  \n\nBeer prices are high, but these are good, rare beers so that is understandable.  Would like to come back and try the food, but this place is obviously hopping.  Nice to know there is another sit-down place that serves food until 1am (ahem, 12:50) besides the Brazen Head in the Marina.", "author": "Eric M."}

We sat at the bar (first come, first served) and ordered beers (duh).  I tried the Siamese twin-- a very Belgian-y belgian beer, and the bf had a Poppy Jasper.  Both were excellent.  My warning would be to check the alcohol percentage listed next to each beer-- they vary from about 4% to 10% for the draught beers and believe me, that's a BIG difference.  The Stone Pale was also good, but less interesting.  You might want to ask to try the IPAs before you order-- some of them were REALLY hoppy.  But the selection is fabulous, most of the beers are local, and you will definitely find something that you'll love. \n\nDinner was equally impressive-- the mac and cheese was one of the best I've had in the city-- creamy and cheesy and salty with a nice panko crust.  The lamb burger was good, although I was kind of expecting it to taste like a gyro.  It doesn't, its more of a smoky, gamey, lamb flavor.  Which was good too.  Fries are thin cut, crispy and well-seasoned.\n\nA bunch of us planned to meet at Monk's for drinks, and although we had a nice time, I generally wouldn't recommend doing anything at this place with more than 4 people.  Its crowded and narrow and there's not really a space to stand without being in the way.  \n\nBut for dinner and drinks for two, you can't do much better.", "author": "Kristin P."}

The lobster pot pie was really tasty.  VERY rich.  And for some reason, every bite that my boyfriend got had a piece of lobster, where as I got no lobster! He ended up giving me his lobster chunks.  It was really good.  Tasted like a lobster clam chowder.  The mac and cheese was good, but I think I'm a little biased.

I don't understand why it's on the 7 x 7 list though- I preferred the cheddar sauce over the mustard. We also ordered bruscetta with fresh heirloom tomatoes- however, I was unimpressed as the bruscetta was 2 large pieces of toast rather than small, easier to eat pieces. Weird. \n\nBy the time I got my pulled pork sandwich, I was almost too full to eat it. It was yummy though, the pulled pork was tender, sweet, and very spicy- just how I like it.

I never order chicken sammies in fear they will be dry and tasteless. (Makes me feel like I'm on some kind of diet). This one, with the promise of brie and bacon, sounded pretty sweet.

I flipped through the several pages of bottles they offered, divided by style, many of which I've never encountered before. (Biere de garde? American Wild Ale?)\n\nThe bartenders were impeccable in their knowledge and very friendly, and when I mentioned that I'm visiting from the East Coast; what should I try that I can't find anywhere else, the bartender eagerly provided a mini-flight of draughts and extensively gave the back story on each. That's great service. \n\nI'm glad I stuck around for a while because there was a tasting of Old Rasputin later on. It got pretty crowded and Monk's Kettle isn't spacious.

Gnomes are really the only bad tasting thing on the list. Unless, of course, they're braised in beer and served on a bed of cabbage. Delish!\n\nThis location used to be the home of Kelly's Burgers - the best damned burger joint in the Mission. Then one day Kelly's closed and I could no longer soothe my late night, Kilowatt fueled craving for seasoned fries. Some time later it became some lame Thai place - because the Mission REALLY REALLY needs another Thai/Asian restaurant. I never went there. It was too lame and it made me cry inside thinking that some place could try to occupy Kelly's. It closed.\n\nNow it's Monk's Kettle. Eh - not bad. I've eaten there 3 times now. I think it will be a long time before I go back. Reasons, you may ask?\n\n1. On my first visit with 2 friends, we arrived just after the too hip for me to read Guardian published their review. We arrived at 5:45 right after work and got THE LAST 4-top in the place. Our waiter was awesome and knowledgeable and welcoming. We had 3 small plates and split the pulled pork sandwich. By the time the sandwich arrive, the place was packed to the rafters with super-awesome-cool hipsters trying to pack 9 to a 4-top and chatting loudly about how super-awesome-cool Monk's is. My friends and I intentionally finished our meal slowly and ordered another round of beers just to annoy the crown of tight-pants/ironic shirt wearers who were eying our table. Beer was Great. Food was Great. Service was Great. Crowd was Poo.\n\n2. My second visit was with co-workers. We went for lunch. The place was empty. The food was Good. The service was Good. The beer was Great.  I was not excited with my chicken sandwich though. But I wasn't paying, so whatever.\n\n3. My third visit was on a Saturday at lazy late lunch time with the Love of My Life.  He hates Niman Ranch - and Bill Niman (just because the label says \"organic\", you sheep...). He loves beer and charcuterie. We both loathe bad service. My wonderful waiter from the first night had turned into a patronizing hipster. Is there something in the Mission air? Because of the Love's personal \"Ban on Niman\" - our choices were limited to charcuterie (a quite healthy portion of yum), pretzel (get extra cheese sauce if you can), and mixed greens salad with blueberries (the best fruit). The food was Great. The beer was Great. The server was Hipster Poo.  \n\nI recommend this place to Hipsters between 6pm and closing time every night of the week. Crowd on in and admire your collective cool. \n\nEveryone else should check it out - at least once for a pretzel and some great beers you might not find anywhere else in SF.", "author": "Bunny H."}

Still nothing to rave about. And it was practically empty as we came late in the afternoon on a weekday. However, we enjoyed ourselves and our beer. Had the giant pretzel, which was basically a frozen pretzel heated up. I don't know why I expected more. Guess I wasn't drunk enough. Maybe then I wouldn't have cared and it would've been just what I was looking for. Anyway, I guess this place is good when the 'scene' aint around.\n\n**edit*4.28.08*edit**\n\nUm, can we say, Pretentious? I did let curiosity get the best of me and with all that buzz, my boyfriend and I just had to check it out. That's pretty much all this place is worth. \n\nI liked the bar and chalk boards in the back. I liked that there were many beers to choose from. But, it seemed like they were just trying way too hard. \n\nFirst off, no one noticed when we walked in. We sat down at the bar, and then we were noticed, but simply ignored. It was the strangest thing. Finally someone came to take our order, but how can we know what we want when no one has given us menus yet?! So we ordered beer while we waited for the menus and then ordered dinner. But there were two different people behind the bar, and they clearly weren't communicating. So there was confusion about the check, is it int he computer or not. But how the hell should we know? We just want to eat dammit. \n\n\nThe food choices were weak. I mean, how many more gourmet burgers do we need in this town? In the end, it's just a burger on some special bread (though I do love La Brea Bakery). We did order it-- again, out of curiosity. That and I just wasn't in the mood for a giant pretzel. We were hungry. Wanted something more substantial.  We also got the chaucuterie plate, which when it first came out looked pretty hearty. I'm used to seeing those dainty plates with like a dab of patte and a slice of salami for $19. But this one had plenty of meat, pickles, all on a bed of arugula. Too bad it didn't taste like anything. The salami might as well have been from your local Safeway and the duck ribletts were so bland, which is why they had to serve it with cranberries. It's not thanksgiving. Nearby Il Couz's chaucterie is loads better.\n\nThe best part of our experience was the bread pudding. That's about the only thing worth coming here for. Warm, soft, sweet. \n\nYou want beer choices- go to Toronado, it also lacks the smug SF attitude that gets old-- fast. You want a gourmet burger and some other late-night hearty meal options-- go to Liverpool Lil's. \n\nBut you want to check out a typical Mission scene and feel cool with a $21 bottle of beer in your hand that has some cute little graphic label, imported from Japan.... then be my guest, and come here.", "author": "Nina H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-20", "description": "NOTE: this is thus far only of the bar; it was too crowded to try the food.  This will be updated posthaste.\n\nThe first thing you'll likely notice upon entering, if it's full, is that the place is damn loud.  This is really the biggest downside.  If it's full of people, the Kettle isn't a good place for conversation.  If you just want some damn good beer, though, you've found one of the best spots in SF.\n\nThe beer selection is huge.  They've got a whopping 30 taps, serving a fantastic selection of micro brews and some of the best Belgian beer in the world (the St. Bernardus Abt 12.  Seriously.  Wow.  There aren't words.)  And if that's not enough, there are I believe 5 pages of menu devoted to nothing but bottled beer, organized by style, with descriptions of each variation, and all listed with their respective alcohol percentage and place of origin.\n\nThe owners are happy to talk beer with you (they clearly love the stuff) and they've got little sample glasses so you can try the selections on tap before choosing one (most of which are served in 20oz glasses).\n\nThe only other downside?  A lot of the bottled beer is damn expensive.  The number of $12 bottles is fairly remarkable.  But then, ultra high end Belgian and German beers just aren't cheap, and are damn hard to find this side of the pond.  And a few of them come in half-liters or 750s, which makes up for it.  Better hope you're thirsty.\n\nSo the Kettle itslef: there's a big bar along one wall, with some fantastic carved wood detail.  Opposing it are a bunch of wooden & stone booths with cool ambiance lights between them.  There's a ledge with stools along the back, faced with chalkboards and chalk for patrons to express their drunken creativity.  There's only one bathroom, but it's shockingly swanky.  And there's a bunch of delicious sounding, rather fancy locally-sourced organic food that I look forward to sampling that they serve until 1am!\n\nOh, and did I mention the enormous selection of beer?\nGo drink some.", "author": "Don H."}

We had been wanting to come here for a little while on a number of high recommendations.\n\nWe sat right away at the bar on Friday night. The bartender was so knowledgeable. The menu for beers, ales, stouts was pages & pages in small font, so he asked Stephen what one of his favorite beers was. Of course Stephen couldn't remember the name, but it was Belgian, and he'd had it in a bar in New York ;*p. So the bartender gave him some tastings in these tiny beer jugs. Too cute. I had a sauv blanc, which was perfectly grassy, from the short list of wines.\n\nWe started with a cheese taster (Chimay and Basque - these were the bartender's favorites - and Stephen and I were in heaven), and a spinach salad with dried cranberries and tahini sauce. It was incredibly yummy. I usually don't like raw spinach, but tahini matches it so well. \n\nAfter our starters, Stephen moved to another delicious, but darker and heavier beer (stout?), and I switched to a syrah - to go with our (well, Stephen's) pork chop which was practically heaven, and the special ahi tuna pot pie, which was warm and comforting and delectable on a cold night.\n\nWe finished with dessert, as the bar was getting super-crowded, and we kept floating on happy-friday and happy-tummy cloud.\n\nWe will visit again - I forgot to mention the regulars there - the bartenders seemed to know them well - their drinks and favorite starters, too. The service was extremely smooth and very engaging for us. It seemed like our server/bartender was sincerely concerned. He also had very good manners. That is always appreciated, since people come in the door with any number of things on their minds. Oh, and we got to meet the chef. That was fun - he wasn't a skinny chef, and as he walked back to the kitchen (which is visible to the bar and some tables) the bartender said \"As they say: Never trust a skinny Chef!\" hee hee.

Yes.  And it was delicious.  The crust was flaky and savory and the sauce was a perfect fit for the scallops and peas.

I recall that they have 20+ on tap and over 100 in bottles and the staff knows their shit.  \n\nOn the downside, the food and service have been spotty so far.  I had a very good salad one day, with currants and almonds, and some tasty mushroom soup, but a mediocre Niman Ranch burger one day and a veggie burger another day that was completely unsatisfying -- like a pile of lukewarm, mashed-up lentil beans stuck between two slices of bread.  Bread was damn good, though.  I almost forgot to mention -- the french fries are superb.\n\nThe first night I went, the bartender was slow and seemed distracted.

I had two beers and my girlfriend had three and we SPLIT a burger, and it was EIGHTY DOLLARS FOR LUNCH. \n\nYeah, I get it. This is the place where you can find all the Belgians that you can't find anywhere else, and they cost money to import over here. I get all of that. But they have very few $5 pint options in case you don't want to spend $10 per beer. \n\nAnd let's not even talk about the burger. It's $10.50. To add cheese is $2.00. To add bacon is $2.00. To add onions is $2.00. When all was said and done, we ate a $17 burger that was disgustingly undercooked and on a hard, cold bun that was far too large for the patty. You gonna charge $17 for a burger, that shit better be flawless. And when I politely asked the owner if he could throw it back on the grill for a couple more minutes, as the patty had just mooed and taken a shit on my plate, he stared at me snottily and said \"So you want it more done then?\" Um, yeah, that's usually what people mean when they ask for it to be thrown back over the heat source. \n\nOne thing I will say, we had a very adorable server who was very attentive. Nothing wrong with the service here. It's just ridiculously overpriced. This is not your hang-out, feel-good Mission bar. This is a bar that should be in the Ferry Building where you expect lunch to cost $80. I say jump on the 22 Fillmore and get thee to the Toronado, where you can get a sensibly-priced pint for $5 and a properly-cooked piece of meat at Rosemunde for $4.\n\n***Amendment to review: the friend with whom I ate at this restaurant is friends with the owner of Monk's Kettle. The next time he went in, the owner mentioned reading this review and asked my friend to apologize to me for my experience here. I bumped it up another star because I appreciate the attempt.

Can't get into that bar.  So we head to The Monk's Kettle.  They get one star because they did not card me, thus I was able to get in with Awwad's license.  \n\nThere are so many beers to choose from.  I choose one from the hefe category.  It is good.  I really like looking around and seeing all the different types of beer glasses that they have. Some big, some tall, some small....  The place is small and full.  It is an awkward place to stand at the bar, as there is no room for that.  We put our name on the list for a table, though we just came to drink.  \n\nWe end up getting a giant soft pretzel.

It is a small place and it it quite popular so there can be a wait for a table.  However, we could not have been more pleased by the waitstaff here.   Our waitress was friendly, quick and knowledgeable.  She really knew that beers here and was able to describe and offer excellent suggestions.  \n\nWe got there around 6PM on Sunday and put our names on the list.  We ordered some beers wile waiting.  We did wait a very long time for a table.  I don't consider this the fault of the restaurant.  They can't really help how many people show up.  They did try to get us seated as quickly as they could and even comped us appetizers that we ordered while waiting.   They totally didn't have to do this, but it was an incredibly nice touch that engendered even more good feelings about this warm and cozy place.  \n\nThe beer here is also not cheap.  However, it is because they are specializing in beers that aren't cheap and are also often difficult to find.  If someone doesn't LOVE good beer, they may not appreciate it enough.  However, if you are a beer lover, this is the place for you.  One beer that they currently have on tap that is truly special is the Rodenbach Grand Cru.  Our waitress brought us over some samples since she thought we would like it.  She was correct!  All four of us ordered our own it was so good.  We are pretty big fans of Flanders Red Ales (we are currently brewing one at home) and after we told her that, she made sure that we tried this.  It is a bit sour, but very pleasantly mild and a bit malty.  Yum!\n\nThe food here was definitely tasty.  We had the charcuterie plate and fries while waiting.  Both were excellent.  We then all had the hamburger for dinner.  We saw other people ordering it and knew it was something we needed to try.  It was one of the best hamburgers I have had in a long time.  The bread for the bun was especially good and the burgers were juicy.  \n\nAfter writing this novel about how much I love this place, I will definitely be back.  My budget doesn't allow for this to be an everyday place, but if it did, I would be here most days.  The fact that I can't afford this place everyday is probably a good thing for my waistline.", "author": "Kate B."}

The waiter was great and very attentive, there were some beers on tap they were out of due to the busy weekend but he readily suggested replacement beers for the types we were interested in. GREAT selection of beers.  We had the black bean cake appetizer which was really delicious. I had the shrimp pot pie. I have never had pot pie before so I didn't know they are normally very creamy, which I'm not that into. It was good for what it was, especially the filo crust on top. I'm looking forward to returning and trying something else. My husband had a burger with fries, he loved the burger and I loved the fries. \n\nAlso, the place is beautifully decorated, they did a great job with the remodel.

The date and I were surprised, however, to find a cozy table for two right by the window. \n\nThe place is stylish, a little loud and a little crowded (I can imagine the last two items getting exponentially worse on the weekend).\n\nBut to the main event: the beer.  They had a very very solid beer menu. I am a big believer of drinking what's on tap- even in a place with tons of fancy bottled belgians.  Because after all, one *can* just buy a bottle at an upscale liquor store for much less and curl up at home- when I go out I like to see how these beers taste on tap.\n\nBut I digress. The beer: a great selection of local, regional and European. I had the St. Bernardus on tap (this is the first place I have seen in on tap since Amsterdam). And the Drake's Imperial Stout on nitro. I am not totally sold on the nitro concept but I am a sucker for a Big Dark beer. The date, who hates beer (yes he is awesome for humoring me) enjoyed his Fox Barrel Black Current Cider.\n\nThe service was fine, if a little slow and the bartender was nice and helpful. I will be back to try the food, which looks a bit expensive but really not that bad. I mean, ok, $12 for a burger is a bit intense but it costs $8 at Applebee's, so for a few bucks less you can sip a bud light. But that's not why you came to Monk's Kettle.", "author": "Rebecca A."}

I like the idea of a quality gastropub in the Mission, and I really like the interior design of this place.  But I have some issues...\n\n1.  Forget about going here during peak hours.  Way too crowded and loud.  But being wildly successful and popular is not the fault of the restaurant.\n\n2.  Very nice beer selection, but I would say it's severely overpriced when compared to SF's world class beer bar, The Toronado, which admittedly has a different vibe.  Most of the draft beers were over $10, which seems ridiculous to me.  I did get some great 10 ounce stronger beers for what I consider a fair price.\n\n3.  The food is priced similarly to Magnolia Brewpub, which has better food.  I had the burger, which was overcooked for \"medium\", and really sabotaged by the lame bun.  You can't have a great burger without a great bun, and Monk's Kettle, your bun just sucks.  See the bun on the Magnolia burger or the Absinthe burger for inspiration.\n\n4.  What is it with the hipsters and bridge and tunnelers that pack this place night after night?  How can they afford to eat and drink here?\n\nBottom line, worth a visit now and then, but I think Magnolia Brewpub bests this place in terms of food.  Magnolia's beers can also be outstanding.  \n\nYou can also slum it and get a sausage from Rosamunde Sausage Grill (which comes in a bun that is divine) and walk it over to the Toronado and have many of the same beers served at Monks' Kettle for much less $.  Of course, then you have to confront' the Toronado's rather gross bathrooms.\n\nUpdate:  Since I wrote this review, the Rosamunde Sausage Grill has opened up on Mission and 24th.  Go there.  Beer selection that is just as good, but about 35% cheaper, nice ambiance, excellent sausages, and... you can usually get in and get a table!", "author": "Paul S."}

I think there is something to be said about not mixing alcohol with studying, because we read through the descriptions every time we go. Still, no brew mastery.\n\nI've never accurately counted, but they must have about 20 beers on tap. The best part about beer is finding a bottled beer you have tried, but on tap. The difference to me is monumental. It could be placebo, but they always seem to have a different heart: sometimes better, sometimes worse. It's like...when you were a child...visiting a playground with a kid you hated, then a kid you loved, or vice-versa. The experience is completely different. In one instance, you enjoy the beer and, in the other, you ...wind up beating your playmate senseless for throwing sand in your eyes till your mother has to take him to the emergency room. What? Oh yeah, large selection of bottled beers, as well. Whew!\n\nI've never had a problem with the staff here. They are all very knowledgeable about the brews and tend toward a less snobby approach.

The chefs' hands, who prepare the food  on the other side of the board, are just visible. It gives an odd, almost surreal theater to the whole experience.

Our friend also really enjoyed his beers.\n\nThe food is good pub food but high class - we ordered the charcuterie  plate, which came with pate, various slices of meats, pickles, mustard, and bread - delicious with beer! I also ordered the potato corn chowder, which was so thicky and creamy and savory. I love that the bread came toasted. For our entrees my boyfriend ordered the lamb burger, which unfortunately was a bit more gamey than he liked, and I ordered the bacon salad, which is a lettuce wedge with cherry tomatoes and bacon bits. My lettuce had a bit of the light pink that comes with being slightly aged, but still tasted fine.\n\nOverall, the food and environment were great, and the selection in beers make up for the lack of space.", "author": "Katherine P."}

When I got there the service was flat out frustrating.  The place was packed and a table finally opened up and it took them forever to clear the table, even though we had told the bartender and a host-type person that we wanted a table and had put our order in at the bar to get things started, but that we wanted to move to a table.  We finally just sat down at the table because we were tired of standing in the way and the girls eating behind where we were standing were getting tired of the concussions our elbows were inflicting on the back of their heads, which made us feel like assholes for standing around.\n\nI was excited to try the vegetarian burger because as a former vegetarian, having a veggie patty made by the usual three brands every restaurant carries gets boring quick.  If they had bothered to tell me it was jut a pile of cold soggy beans stuffed in a bun I definitely would not have ordered it.\n\nAnd a waitress never came by asking if we wanted more beer.  We would have filled up the owner's cash box pretty quick if they did that thing where they come by and say \"can i get you any more food or drink?\"\n\nAlso adding to the disappointment was the fact that I was at Toronado a few days before, then Trappist somewhere in between, so by the time I got to Monk's Kettle none of the beers on drought were new and exciting.  I'm not a fan of bottled beer, I go to beer bars because you can't get good droughts anywhere else.   When I don't care about service and just want good beer I go to Toronado, for some reason I was expecting more out of this place.", "author": "SC .."}

It's one of the most distinct beer menus in San Francisco, and for a light beer drinker like me who has friends who drink A LOT, it fits everyone. \nThe inside of the Monk's Kettle reminds me of a pub scene of Harry Potter (that's the best example I could give you) Maybe it's because we went in when it was raining... but very much a pub of men and women drinking around a warm cozy wooden atmosphere. \nNow the food.. it what gets you. There are tons of bars around San Francisco, half of which serve food. Than out of those half only a third is good with another third being fried. The Monk's Kettle WINS BIG. Their farm to table aspect mirrors much like Town Hall Restaurant in the inner city. The charcuterie and cheese plate is the best mix I've had for bread and cheese... the cheese menu changes for what is in season, so does the charcuterie.. It's served with toasted nuts, house jam which is amazing, house mustard that tastes much like a dijon, and acme bread. So yummy!\nWe also had a small plate of the mussels, mixed in Belgian Ale, garlic and basil and again served with that delicious bread.

It's quickly become a weekly haunt.\n\nThey've got the most amazing selection of beers I've probably ever seen.  Though a handful of other places have more beers, the sheer variety of specialty and microbrews here is phenomenal.  They have a bunch of beers on tap that change regularly (daily?) and then a very large selection of bottled beers.  Occasionally, they even have a cask ale which is what I had the first time I went and I wish more people would order it so they would always have it.  If you've never had cask conditioned ales, you've never had beer the way it should be drunk.  Probably the best thing about the place is the amazing amount of stuff the bartenders know about the beers they have (and even about many they don't carry).  They are truly beer connoisseurs.\n\n[As an aside, one of the many beers I've now tried there and have fallen in love with is Brother Thelonious Abbey Ale from North Coast Brewery.  I suggested a couple of non-beer drinkers to try this beer and they also loved it.  The point is, even if you think you're not a beer lover, come try out something here and you'll be a convert very quickly.]\n\nOh, and how can I forget the food.  Even if it's just the fries or giant pretzel that are perfectly salted and paired with great dipping sauces to complement many beers, or the excellent mac and cheese (one of the better ones in the city) or the vegan chili, their food is pretty damn good.  Each food item, as appropriate for a place like this, has a beer pairing or two to go with it and some are dead nuts on.\n\nI intend to come back here on a regular basis to try every beer they offer.

An especially positive feature since I was there after knocking off work early on SF's sunniest day of the year so far.

My drinking companion, however, scored what appeared to be the lone table for two right next to a window on 16th.\n\nThe bartender greeted us friendly and passed us some menus and the waitress followed up quickly.  The menu was *quite* extensive -- reminded me of the wine list and Rubicon both in terms of quantity and price.  To avoid information overload, we stuck to the beers on tap, which were in the neighborhood of a dozen.

Fortunately, we were well happy with our beers and pretzel (a behemoth served with an excellent mustard and another dipping sauce I didn't taste) and decided to note the quality disparity in waitresses here on Yelp and not let it drag us down.

At the other end of the spectrum, you can get a PBR or Tecate for $2.50, but the real good ones lie somewhere in the middle.

If I had to nitpick, I'd say the waiter could have toned down the technicality of his beer explanations a bit (yes, yes ... we know you are an expert).  But I'm really stretching to find something NOT to rave about.\n\nNow for the food.  The menu is great and we were all basically happy with our selections, but all four of us found our dishes somewhat over-salted.  The meat and chicken were all perfectly cooked and the accompaniments were well done, but it's the saltiness that's preventing me from going all in with five stars.  Over salting food is the sign of an unconfident or inexperienced cook -- it's kind of a shame that the food doesn't live up to the high standards of the beer experience.\n\nOne other minor quibble -- we were seated next to two women that were entirely too drunk -- to the point were they were having trouble eating -- and yet the waiter kept bringing them drinks.  Not cool.\n\nThat said, we all agreed that we would go back soon!  Unlike some other reviewers here, we thought that the prices were in line with the service and quality.  Moreover, if you liked the food (as most reviewers appear to have), then why complain about the prices when you can clearly check them out before choosing to eat here?   This restaurant is a big asset to the Valencia corridor.", "author": "Roger S."}

Yet every time I go there lately the beer selection seems smaller, the douchebag quotient higher and the ability to sit and chill with a tasty beer diminished.\n\nThank god for the Monk's Kettle. It has to be said that we've been trying to go here for ages, but every time we stop by the wait for a table is edging an hour. Last night though, with our later arrival and the Mission relatively deserted, we were able to ban a table in less than a couple of minutes. \n\nI'm firmly of the belief that a Yelp review starts with five stars and loses from there, as opposed to working up from zero. In this case, there just didn't seem to be any reason to deduct anything. From the moment we arrived and the door guy did his best to get us a table (agreeing to seat us at the bar and move us when a table opened) to the warm greeting from the beer-mad server guy, the level of quality was consistently high.\n\nOf course the beer selection is amazing, but any beer geek can rent a space and fill it with saison, rauschbier, dunkels and imperial IPAs. It's what you do with that space that counts, and in this case the approach is to hire friendly, knowledgeable staff and crank out terrific food.\n\nThe steak and fries were bloody terrific, amongst the best steak-frites-type dish I can remember having in SF (and a dish that I think can immediately separate a decent restaurant from the crowd). The beer was lovely, in my case a Franziskaner Dunkelweiss  for the main course and Youngs Double Chocolate Stout for dessert.\n\nMy main recommendation is to go when it's not busy, so that you can truly savour the awesomeness without being irritated by a wait.", "author": "Neil S."}

Prices are a real crapshoot, though.  $3.50 for a glass of Dogfish Head Punkin isn't bad, but $13 for 8 ounces of Kwak?  I know the glass is cool, but come on!  I didn't find their draught list particularly inspiring, either.\n\nThe food is similarly confounding.  The portions they give are perfectly fine, and the flavors are by and large pretty good, but again ... that dollar sign kind of lays it all flat.  My $14 bruschetta (at $7 per 5-inch piece) wasn't either plentiful or particularly inspired, and the $5 basket of frites was a bit greasy.  No real complaints about the service, though.\n\nOverall, slightly disappointing, but certainly still perfectly okay.

Since there wasn't enough sauce to go around, we asked for additional sauce and were told it was going to be an additional $0.50.  Fine, $0.50 but when you are charging me $15 for a bottle of Tripel Karmeleit that costs half that at the Trappist in Oakland, why can't one give an appropriate ration of sauce for the pretzels?  All of at the table were annoyed at the $0.50 charge when they had given more sauce initially, then did not give an equal amount later.  We joked that from then on we would just order one pretzel at a time, but I think that we should leave that restaurant talking about the great food, good beer, not how they inconsistently rationed sauce and then charged us $0.50 for what should have been included according to their earlier rations.\n\nBesides the sauce rationing mentioned above, the pretzels themselves were very good and just baked.  The Three day ale bricked chicken, cranberry beans, and harissa dinner was quite good, flavorful and cooked just right.\n\nThe beer selection is great, and definitely our server was well versed in beer/dinner pairings, and his knowledge of the beers and details of certain breweries was impressive.  I did not realize that the Tripel Karmeleit was one that I have enjoyed a few times at the Trappist in Oakland, so when it came to the table, was surprised that I'm paying a bit more than twice as much as the other establishment, but I had ordered it, so I enjoyed it.\n\nI just will now read the menu a lot more carefully,  but am still impressed with the selection and would return for the food and drink.

Or they're narrowminded. Or both. Monk's Kettle is way less discriminatory than that. They have all styles of beers that I have ever heard of, plus a few that I haven't heard of, all carefully listed in categories and subcategories, with descriptions. And when I say all styles, I mean _all_ styles. Under the compelling header \"Grampa's suds\" even PBR is listed. Of course, with all the goodness on this menu I can't help but to hope that they'd throw people out if they tried to order PBR, but you have to admire the effort of covering all possible kinds of beer.\n\nSo, yeah, you could go here for the Belgian beer (and they do have lots of it!). But then you'd miss out on German smoky beer, Norwegian winter ale, good old English ales, and yummy American beers with unappetizing names. It's damn expensive, but hey, what do you expect from items imported in small quantities. The staff is knowledgeable and will give you taste samples of the draught beers, yay!\n\nIf I wasn't so goddamn honest I'd write a bad review of this place to keep you guys out of there, because there's just no way to get in. It's too damn full! \n\nI had the steak sandwich and the namedropping in the  food description just couldn't leverage the chewy meat. I looked forward to eating french fries with aioli. Unfortunately the ambition of the chef extended to putting herbs or gorgonzola in it, but failed to recognize that garlic is one of the three main ingredients in aioli, and that there should be lots of it. Overall the food wasn't bad, but a bit bland and not up to my expectations for a posh-looking pretentious we-have-more-beers-than-God kind of bar.", "author": "Lina M."}

If you want a $12 burger, you're better off at a place that have a menu full of burgers instead of beer. Come here after you've gorged on the cornucopia of cheap eateries around the Mission and spend the rest of your money on quality beers. \n\nSomething about the psuedo-wine bar layout with its cupped candles and IKEA looking furnishings greatly annoys me. If not for the inherited cramped quarters of a hole-in-the-wall lineage, the Kettle rings more true for the Marina than the Mission. But after a good belgian beer your scrutinizing, unflinching vigilance for neighborhood purity will dull and take on a bypartisan stance. Have you ever had a beer that reminds you of tea? How about a beer that tastes like vinegar and you actually enjoy this acquired taste? All the nonsense with the cutesy decor aside, the kettle brims with unique beers you'd be hard pressed to find under one roof anywhere else. \n\nPretentious? Yes, this place is pretentious as far as its appearance goes. The beers are of their own rite and remain unmolested by the misguided notions of the head monk. Judge the beers by the contents of their bottles and not by the house in which they are served.  After all, we are beer drinkers, we don't mess around with cuteness, we are about taste, and for a good taste, we're willing to put up with bad taste.   \n\n\nP.S. if anybody out there knows the owner/abbot, can you please tell him or her to give us what we all expect, a monastery. Cold wet stones and mildewy wood beams. Abbot if you make it happen, I'll come worship more often. Promise.", "author": "Ji D."}

Need to get there early and make sure you're entire party is there otherwise they won't sit you. I suggest if you only have 2 then you could try to squeeze in somewhere at the bar as they are free for all. The host and waitress were very nice though. They really wanna make it work for you but still follow the rules of the house. I understand! I work at a restaurant too!\n\nAt our table we had the fried oysters, pickled stuff, burger and fries, flatbread, shrimp wrapped bacon, and daily roast short ribs. The oysters were ok...but I'm not a fan of cornmeal. They did fry it to perfection though so you can still taste the oyster and not just a bunch of fried cornmeal. I didn't eat the pickles stuff but there were some interesting items in there if you like pickled things. The burger was on the cheesy side and I could only managed half without getting a heart attack but yummmmyyy!! And the fries were one of the best I've ever had. I think they called them hop fries! Mmmmm!!! The flatbread was decent. The daily roast melted in your mouth goodness. If you still have room go get they're carrot cake!! OMG! My hey don't put nuts or coconut which is a plus for me but they're cream cheese frosting is light and has just enough flavor to complement the carrot cake like it should.

The place was small; therefore, the wait list for a table was about an hour, but luckily we grabbed the last two seats at the bar.  \n\nThe bartender was friendly and very knowledgeable about the beers.  My friend tried 3 different beers, but the only one I remember is the dessert beer I tasted: Meantime Coffee Porter.  If you love coffee and porters, this is a dream come true; my friend was in heaven with this beer.  I was excited to see they had Beamish since I heard Coors wasn't importing it anymore, but I decided to go with a Hoegaarden to pair with my beer brined pork chop.  \n\nI had a bite of my friend's skirt steak which had a great sauce, but my pork chop was definitely the star player out of our menu items that night.  It was a big pork chop that was tender and cooked to perfection.  My mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  We both cleaned our plates although I did slow down towards the end.  For dessert we tried the chef's choice: poached pears with honey mascarpone and a lavender drizzle.  It wasn't our favorite, but that didn't stop him from finishing the plate.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience.

Most of the restaurants where we would go were closed so we headed to The Monk's Kettle to grab something to eat before going home.\nWe have been waiting to come here since my Husband is a big beer / spirits and wine lover and we heard good things about their food and beer selection.\n\nWe got there and it was packed.  The greeter told us that they have some tables that are opening up so go to the bar and they will come to seat us at a table as soon as it becomes available.  I checked to see if there were anybody waiting for a table ahead of us since we were starving, and all of the names on the list were crossed out.  I though \"Yes, we are next!\".\n\nWe went to the bar and there weren't even a stool open.  We stood uncomfortably in between the bar and a table right on the aisle.\nA server came by and said to us abrasively \"Excuse me!!\".  Okay. . .\n\nThen a table opened up and we sat down because 1), We were the first one on the list; 2), There weren't any room to wait at the bar; 3), We were hungry.\n\nThen a waiter comes up and said \"Were you seated by somebody?\"\nWe said no, and he goes \"This table is not even set up yet.  We will let you know when it's ready.\"  Okay. . . . .\n\nThen unbelievably,, a party of four comes in and sits down in front of us as soon as the table was set.\nWe looked at each other and said \"Really?\"\n\nWe headed right to the entrance without saying anything to each other and the greeter said \"Are you guys leaving? A table will be ready soon.\"  I thought, yeah right, we probably know more about what's going on in the floor than you do because you just sit there at the entrance, and everyone at the table were deep into conversation that none of them seemed to be leaving anytime soon.\n\nI asked the greeter as I was leaving, \"Were those people ahead of us?\" He goes \"They came at the same time as you.\"  I stared at him in the eyes as I left.  \n. . . . .  LIAR!  I saw the list empty, and those people were nowhere as we came in.

The list is enormous and can be a tad on the gourmet side (with prices to reflect it) but if you're on a budget, just gaze on over at the fan of a zillion taps and you'll find your match.\n \nSecondly, I never come here during the feeding hours of the common street hipster.  I've seen the place packed to the point of bodies spewing out of the door and with the loud chorus of drunken banter, could be any one of dozens of Mission digs.  Hence, my gf and I wander in about 5 or 6ish and thoroughly enjoy ourselves.\nLesson: avoid gratuitous crowds = personal space to enjoy food/drink.\n\nThirdly, the wait staff is totally on their game with knowledge and recommendations.  Ryan, our fave, is always helpful and friendly and gives you the beer lowdown in layman's terms.\nWe've never been disappointed and are always discovering a great unknown brew.\nBlue Apron and Telegraph Ale rock. \n\nLastly, the food has never been a letdown.  I've seen previous reviews that hammered on the food and all I can say is, again, I've never been disappointed.  Granted, you are in a beer establishment in the Mission but I find the food to be above par with the rest of the bar fodder in the hood.   Lobster pot pie??  Are you fuggin kidding me?  A++!  Of course, the mac n cheese is never a let dow (and perfect beer compliment at midnight) and the salads are fresh.  The gf digs the oh-so-fresh desserts.  \nI'm not a huge fan of the pretzel but it does rank well above Annie's shyte (as some poor tongueless reviewer suggested).\n\nIn all, one of my favorite spots in the Mish and with food being served unitl about 1 am, who can whine about that fer crissake?", "author": "Stephan J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-12", "description": "ORIGINAL REVIEW AUGUST 2008\nWent there with a group of four people this past weekend for a late lunch.\n\nWas very impressed with their beer selections (go to their website to check them out). Our group tried the Petrus Old Bruin, Ellie's Brown Ale by Avery and Stone 12th Anniversary Ale. All were on tap. Their bottled selections were also superb.\n\nThis is definitely more of a lunch/small dinner atmosphere than a bar setting, but they did have a small bar as well. They had beer pairings with each menu item as well which was quite handy. The server seemed to be busy, but was very attentive and responsive. Service the entire time was very fast.\n\nFood was actually really tasty. I had the skirt steak which was very flavorful and tender. My buddy had the chicken pot pie which was one of the best I've tried. Price was reasonable.\n\nStrong 5 star review.  Highly recommended if you are in the Mission District of San Francisco!\n\nREVIEW UPDATE AS OF SEPTEMBER 2010\nWent here with my family and had a 6-top.  Waited about 20 minutes for our table; it was a Friday night, so this was of no surprise.  The beer selections as I expected were superb.  EEmbrasse -  a belgian strong dark ale.  Strong, smooth and very good.  Pliny the Elder - always a treat.  Echte Kriekenbier - my girlfriend was raving about this sour.  St. Louis Gueze - strong horseblanket funk; delicious.  Moonlight Reality Czeck - always a treat; subtle but flavorful and easy drinking.  Moonlight Wheat (brand new and only at a couple bay area establishments apparently) - a sour wheat; very unique and glad I tried it.   \n\nThe food this time around was average to well below average.  The fried mushrooms appetizer was good which we started with, but it seemed to all go downhill from here.  The soup was not bad, but unmemorable.  The bruschetta was a terrible excuse for one.  Really, really bad.  Steak Sandwich was very unmemorable and lacked good flavor.  Burgers were lacking in flavor and well below average.  BBQ Baby Back Ribs were not bad, but I thought they were slightly overcooked and the bbq sauce was only mediocre.  The pot pie was average with too strong of a rosemary taste.  \n\nThe total for 6 was $245.28 after tax before tip.  Beers were expensive and food was moderate to expensive.  Service was excellent and beer was delicious, but the bad food is making me bring my strong 5-star rating down to a 4-star.  I'm not throwing the towel in on the place for their food; it could have been a new chef or an off night for the cooks.  If it is like this next time, though, I may just go there for the beers.", "author": "Benjamin P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-02-02", "description": "Visited the Kettle on a Friday and after enjoying some great company, drinks, and eats, I figured I'd share a few thoughts with the class.\n\nTIGHT QUARTERS - This place is cramped, seriously. When it's packed, it's hard to breathe. Even when you have a table. The entry area is jammed and valuable bar space is taken up by a giant lamp that looks out of place on the corner.\n\nGREAT BEER - The beer menu here is outstanding. The draught list is great, but the real story at the Kettle is the bottled beer selection. One can find all sorts of rare treats from around the world. If you're just in the mood for some swill, you can refer to the 'Grampa's Suds' section of the menu and grab yourself an ice cold can of PBR or Olympia for $2.50.  The list also details ABV for almost all of their beers, so you can better calculate that all important cost-to-drunkeness ratio.\n\nFOOD - Go for the fries..these things are seriously addicting. Beyond that, we tried the cheese plate and a Iceberg Wedge salad. Portions were large and the food was reasonably priced. (but don't expect a cheap night here, more on that in a sec!)\n\nWATCH YOUR WALLET - The slogan for this place should be 'Home of the $11 Beer'. Beers start at $2.50 (Tecate, PBR, Olympia) and go up from there...way up. The rarer the beer, the higher the price, with more than a few specialty brews sitting at around $10-12 for a regular bottle. Large bottles (500ml, 750ml) can run you way north of $40 if you're not careful. And of course, the bulk of this beer is STRONG, so you can easily walk out of here with a savage buzz and a hangover in your wallet.", "author": "Jared K."}

How excited was I to find this place, all warm and sparkly, a few doors down! (Actually, living in the East Bay, how excited was I to find a late-night kitchen, period!) The doorguy and waiter were very welcoming to a woman dining alone at 11:30 PM, and folks at the bar were having much fun with the bartender, who clearly knew his stuff. \n\nTHE BAD: Unfortunately, my nice waiter did not. When I said I wanted to try something new, either a Saison along the lines of a St. Feuillien or De Ranke, or a Belgian Strong Ale like Duvel or Chimay, he suggested Chimay. (Uh, no...) Then he leafed through the menu and read the descriptions to me (Again very sweet, but I actually know how to read). I asked him to ask the bartender for recs; instead he said he'd bring me an \"awesome\" beer he \"knew\" I would love though couldn't explain why. (Needless to say, there was no love.) After delivering the bottle (why would you open a bottle of something you can't even describe when there are 12-plus options on tap?), he never checked to see if I liked it, even when he brought my food. I had to grab him to say I hated his thin, formaldehyde-tasting recommendation, much to his apparent dismay. Finally he checked in with the big boy and brought me 3 tastes in teeny leprechaun steins (on my tall stool, I felt like a giant!). \n\nTHE UGLY: When I ordered the lamb burger, my waiter immediately starting pushing the extra toppings (at $2 each). It already comes with a horrid (dill? mint?) yoghurt sauce, which ain't gonna get any better by adding a completely different flavor profile like cheese, saut\u00e9ed onion, avocado, and mushrooms. I ended up spending $40 for a burger and a beer (with tip). The guys at The Trappist in Old Oakland are twice as savvy for half the price.", "author": "Faith A."}

For the most part, it was.  We were able to walk in on a Sunday evening and had no problem getting a table for four.  The pot pie of the day intrigued us and when we heard it was lobster pot pie, we were sold. We were a little worried about having lobster tidbit pot pie, but on my first bite, I had a huge chunk of lobster! It was creamy, filling and satisfying, but the crust could have been baked a bit longer. My husband was happy with his crisp, skinny fries, pork sandwich and beer.\n\nThe menu had a long and varied list of beers but the downside was it was too dark to read the details! Also, the cold wind blows right in when the door opens - and with the City weather being a bit chilly save for late August through October, it's quite cold inside.

However, as an eatery, it's overpriced for, at best, standard fare. They attempt to impress with presentation, but you've had better elsewhere, believe me. For example, I was stoked about the lobster mac'n'cheese - how yummy does that sound! Sadly, it sucked. The lobster was stiff and  the mac'n'cheese just wasn't that good. \n\nAlso, everyone keeps trying to sell me on their burgers. Meh I say. Go down to the Front Porch and get a real burger and some crab grits to boot. \n\nThe staff was nice, but the place is quite cramped and there is a definite douchebag factor in your fellow diners. I can accept that, it's that part of the Mission right? But just make the food worthwhile.", "author": "Jay N."}

I went on vacation with my husband for a week in San Francisco.  Using Yelp as tool to guide us towards the \"good beer\" in town, I decided to take my fellow \"Yelpers\" advice and hope on the BART down to Mission in order to experience the wonderful beer selection...\n\nFirst of all, when we got there, we were informed that it was standing room only, though there were open tables.  When I asked to sit at a table, they told me I was going to have to eat... Well, I was planning on eating a pretzel with a few beers, but they meant eat dinner.  My husband and I waited awkwardly in the small space between the bar and tables, becoming an annoyance I'm sure for every member of the wait staff... finally someone was leaving the SMALLEST table you have ever seen by the window up front and offered it to us after over-hearing me say, \"I'm sure we're everyone's biggest pain in the ass...\"  15 minutes later, 20 hands, and about 30 \"excuse me's...\", we're finally sitting. \n\nI am going to complain about the price.  Sorry, people.  If money's just not an issue for you, well, great... I'm from San Diego, I like my San Diego type Ale's and I especially like not paying 500% mark up on them.  I was aghast at the prices.  When I told the waiter it was like tearing my heart out to pay these prices for my local brews, he shrugged his shoulders and said, \"It's a restaurant?\"  Well, thanks, I can see that, but please explain why you're asking 65 bucks for a (I believe) Lost Abbey beer I can get for 6 at the store?  While the beer list is extensive, this place is not for the true beer-lover.  It was cleary for the bougie-types, and funny thing is, most of the people we saw come in and out throughout our stay had only ONE beer... who goes to pub to have one beer?  When they are as expensive as the Monks prices, many people.  We ended up having 4 beers between the two of us and pretzel.  Got a decent buzz and got out of there... \n\nThe decor is decent?  Eh, looked like synthetic flooring on the ground.  They have about 5 booths, pub style, and a bland bar.  Nothing special to wow you in aesthetic department.  In our search for good beer throughout the city, we found other places I'd like to recommend... my husband and I loved Magnolia Pub in the Haight, Toronado in lower Haight, The Irish Bank in Union, and The Thirsty Bear in SoMa.  They had decent prices and good beer.  \n\nHope this is helpful!", "author": "Natasha L."}

The food here is top notch (at least it was the last time I ate there, although they have apparently changed chefs recently). Despite what I've read in other reviews about issues with the staff, I've never had any problem with the guy at the door nor the servers.\n\nMonk's Kettle also does a monthly beer night where they have a special beer pairing menu which I've been looking into for awhile, but haven't been able to try yet...you have to reserve your spot well in advance and the website/staff are a bit vague as far as what the guest brewery/menu/specific dates are. \n\nThe only real con to this place is the size. Make no mistake...if you show up around dinner or later, especially on a weekend, expect to wait awhile for a table and/or get real friendly with the person standing next to you at the bar. There really isn't any spare room to stand/sit around and drink/socialize if you're not at a table or at the bar. But if you do get a spot, you're in for a treat.", "author": "Devin G."}

If you're looking for beers that you can also pick up at Safeway, this really isn't the place to go. It has an outrageous selection of (pretty much) all regional beers. Belgian, German, British, American microbreweries, etc. It's pretty dizzying to read through the 5 pages of listings. They even have \"The Kwak\" on tap, served in the funky glass.\n\nGreat atmosphere and the food is pretty good. They have a potpie of the day (I had the Wild Mushroom Potpie yesterday) and sort of the general bar fare. Beer pairings for the entrees is a nice touch. Kitchen's open until 1am.\n\nDrawback is how long it took us (party of 5) to get a table: it took almost two hours on a Saturday night. But considering the main attraction of the place (the beer list), you can put that time to good use. And the GREAT and helpful staff will help you pick out beers that match you.", "author": "Jack C."}

Went here last night and got an Old Rasputin Stout on Nitro and a Fuller's London Porter on Nitro.  Delicious.  The bar tenders were friendly.  The prices for the quality of beer is pretty reasonable.   Food - the pretzel is great and comes with some yummy beer cheese sauce.  My dining mates had the burger and I had the steak sandwich, which were all good.  I like that they aren't ketchup monitors and actually provide little bottles and not just a small cup.  \n\nMy biggest complaint is their handing of table seating.  We walked in at 5:50 and asked for a table for three.  The bartender said you are first on the list.  Another group of seven came in after us.  I don't know if it was because some members of that group were especially pushy, or the staff wanted to get them seated and out of the open area, but somehow, they were seated before us (at a four and a two top).  We got our seats after waiting an hour and 20 minutes (how's that for being first on the list).  Evidently, there is  much confusion about seating in the booths, as essentially every time a table opened a group would sit down.  Then the bar staff would have to make them all get up when the people on the list would need to be seated.  Perhaps some signage would end some of this confusion.\n\nFunny incident.  Some dude walked in there with two toddlers.  Then he walked out.  Why would parents think bringing children (of any non-legal drinking age) to a bar is a good idea?", "author": "Jory R."}

Similar to Chicago's Hop Leaf, the menu has a nice variety of tasty eats, and the beer selection is vast and delicious.  I'm sure both menus will only continue to improve as the pub matures. All the staff was super-friendly, which was a refreshing change from other beer bars in the city. I love seeing someone smile when they serve me.  Good music too. Nice ambiance. \n\nI found the bottle list to be pretty pricey - much of the bottles they offer I've bought for a pretty penny less, and I was deterred from ordering a few selections I was excited about, because I was unwilling to pay the mark up. \n\nI ordered my burger medium-rare, but there was no pink in the middle. Other than this small detail, the food was fabulous. In fact, there was a really funny guy next to us that exclaimed a loud \"OooOOhhh\" with each course he ordered.  The french fries, which are a special treat I rarely eat, were really really fantastic. Crunchy, then melt-in-your-mouth. My boyfriend also adored the \"pot pie of the day,\" which was lobster! A very unique and exquisitely cooked meal, indeed. \nWe finished off our meal with the seasonal cobbler - persimmon. Wow. It was wonderfully spiced, with a dollop of ice cream that melted into the pastry. I was in heaven, 4 sure. \n\nThe funniest part of the meal was the coincidental bum-fight just outside the window. I guess there is a crack house next door, and two guys got rowdy over some rocks. It was an entertaining ass-beating that made my beer taste that much better. \n\nI look forward to bringing my friends here, and I can't wait to see what other beers they are going to have on tap. I hope they keep a good rotation, and keep smiling while they serve.", "author": "Cheryl J."}

The lighting and a few other accents remind me of a French bistro.  It's the kinda place that I'd want to pull up to the bar and stay dry during a long, cold rainstorm.  That block of the Mission could use some more class and these guys have found the right formula.\n\nPopped in on a whim during the week and waited maybe 15-20 minutes (with a tasty Franziskaner Heffe) for a few stools to open up at the dining bar towards the back.  The beer menu was the most exhaustive (and descriptive) one I've seen and has something for everyone.  It's nice to see that they aren't trying to perpetuate the \"let's try to out do each other's wine list\" thing and are mixing things up.  And if it's a wine list you're looking for, there are about 9000 wine bars to choose from in town now (in case you hadn't noticed).  And for those complaining about the beer prices, well, there's affordable PBR *right* next door at Delirium.\n\nAnyhoo.  So, granted, I was starving by the time we sat down, but the BBQ pork sammy that I had was pretty perfect.  The bread (from Acme, I think) was just the right softness/freshness and the pulled pork wasn't overwhelmed by the BBQ sauce.  Good sized portion along with a boatload of excellent french fries.\n\nI liked that it was cafe style in that you order your grub at the bar and they bring it out to you when it's done (assuming it's different at an actual table).  Also dug the chalkboard that lines the wall in front of the dining bar (the wall could have been built taller to diffuse the bright/un-sexy kitchen lighting).  We got to hone our Hangman skillz!\n\nProbably not a good large-group place, rather it's better suited for a more intimate dinner with just a handful of friends, I'd imagine.

He gave great suggestions on what items were safe for my vegan-self, and he even checked my veggie burger when it came out from the kitchen to make sure none of that dairy or egg business had snuck into the dish. He advised me and my friends on what beers to order, and when my friend didn't like hers he asked her what she would change and grabbed her a new one, just like that.

I've read some complaints on here about the veggie burger, so I don't know if they changed the recipe or if I just have an unrefined palate, but I thought it was delicious! I really liked it with the grilled onions and spring lettuce - none of that iceberg nonsense here. The fries were good - I am more into the thickly cut steak fries, and these were skinny lil dudes, but they were flavorful and not too greasy. My friends had the flatbread and seemed to like that a lot, too. The beer was also great! It was a few notches up the price scale than what I'm used to paying for beer, but that is partly because I ordered a bunch of imports.

That was the first mistake.  This place is small and there is no adequate space for a group to wait.  We stood around blocking the aisles and being jostled by the waitstaff for approximately 45 minutes before our table was ready.\n\nWe mostly tried appetizers, and I will say that the french fries were excellent.  The pretzel was good, too, although I did not like the cheese sauce.  What really bothered me, however, is what happend with our lettuce wedge.  \n\nThe lettuce wedge comes with a bleu cheese dressing, in addition to several toppings.  I liked the toppings but am not a fan of bleu cheese, so I asked for the dressing on the side in case someone else wanted it.   I also asked if it would be possible to get an Italian dressing on the side for myself and the waiter said yes.\n\nNot only did the wedge come out with the bleu cheese dressing on it, it was absolutely DRENCHED.  There was not one piece of lettuce that didn't have bleu cheese on it.  The waiter said that the kitchen staff had messed up, but that unfortunately it was the last wedge of the evening, so basically we could either take it or leave it.  Since I was sharing it with someone else we took it, but I felt that we should have gotten it comped or something since it was their mistake.\n\nI wouldn't come back here unless I was with someone else who really wanted to.  There are a lot of other places you could go that have large beer selections and comparable food choices.  I would NEVER come back here with a large group.", "author": "Gami G."}

An Italian proverb inspired by the story reads: \"Perfetto come la 'O' di Giotto\" or \"As perfect as Giotto's circle.\"  Perfection of even the simplest of acts is undeniable, an achievement of skill and execution that is both noteworthy and singular.  \n\nAt The Monk's Kettle, their perfect circle is their fries.  Fries are deceptively simple to make but any chef worth their salt knows that frying is not  a simple cooking technique; there are so many variables in perfect frying (the condition of the fat, moisture content of food, amount of surface area, etc) that is as much an art as science.  The Monk's Kettle has perfected their art and subsequently turns out the most heart-breakingly perfect fries that even the Pope would weep.  In the two orders of fries we had with our meal, not one was limp and soggy.  Every single damn fry was perfectly cooked to crisp golden-brown deliciousness, an archetype of what french fries should be.\n\nWhile the fries are transcendent, the focus at The Monk's Kettle is beer.  A board over the bar has a quote by Kaiser Wilhelm, \"Give me a woman who loves beer, and I will conquer the world.\"  Not content with a couple of taps, their beer menu alone is over 5 pages.  Our server was helpful with recommendations and I settled on a De Koninck Belgian Pale Ale and my friend had the Frambozen Raspberry Brown Ale.\n\nThe food is grown-up pub grub, familiar and with thoughtful touches that keep it sophisticated but not pretentious.  Between us we had the vegan chili, pretzel, Angus burger, and the salmon sandwich.  I had the salmon sandwich, which was cooked just south of perfect at medium, but a forgivable offense with the delicious olive tapenade aioli and crispy shallots.  I didn't try my friends' food but plates cleaned of each speck of food speak volumes.\n\nThe Monk's Kettle is a neighborhood joint that keeps it fresh and sexy, classing up the traditional burgers and brew without a hefty price tag.

It was a good pretzel but it definitely was not worth the 10 i paid with tax and tip. The pretzel is definitely not giant, its just a large pretzel. I read someone elses review that said his pretzel was basketball sized. Maybe they made my pretzel too small on accident?  I noticed on the earlier reviews the pretzel was around 6.50 which is a MUCH more reasonable price than $8. In fact my sister was appalled that I paid that much for a pretzel when I could have gotten the same size pretzel albeit with many more different flavor combinations at Wetzel's Pretzels or auntie annies. The ground mustard I thought was disgusting. It just tasted like horseradish bits mixed with vinegar. The cheese sauce WAS definitely good but definitely NOT worth the $8. If you are rich and don't care about throwing down ridiculous amounts of money on a pretzel then go for it. However if you want to get 3 pretzels with more flavor combinations + a dollar back go to the mall food court!\n\nThe burger was good too but just good not great. Not worth the $11 not including tax and tip. Also the fries that came with it were ok tasting? Im not exactly understanding why people think theyre the best fries either. And this is coming from someone who loves mcdonalds and arby's fries!\n\nAs for service it took quite awhile before any servers noticed us sitting there looking very hungry or occasionally waving to get their attention.

Nice decor, love the bar and all its glasses but the place is small so come early or expect standing room only. Worth a vist but takes itself too serious.", "author": "Brendan H."}

Bartender had an excellent pour [though I admit I'm partial to my own] and they were super nice. Gouden Carolus Tripel was not my best choice -- too bitter of a pale for me -- should have gone with one of their Doppelbocks! The pairings on the menu are spot on, and the Tripel was nicely paired with my delicious chicken sandwich -- just not my favorite beer. Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbeir was good, and their pretzel was AMAZING! Get it. Super 'cute' and cozy, close quarters with the people next to you -- so naturally I struck up several conversations. :D", "author": "Angela H."}

The burger was tasty, the two different beers I had (both that our server recommended) were very good, and the fries, while not the best I've ever had, were certainly good. The others probably ordered less well, including the Bavette Steak, Grain and Chick Pea burger, and mushroom risotto. Of the three, the risotto (which I did not try) was viewed as being good, the steak was okay (but the much anticipated bacon fritters failed to impress) and the Chick pea burger, for a person who likes her veggie burgers, was pretty much uneatable (confirmed by the writer). The service was very good, both our server and the guy who helped with the beer were nice, attentive and fun. While I would go back for the beer, and would even eat there again, this is not a \"dining experience,\" it is good food (assuming you order correctly), very good beer and a cool atmosphere. One pet peeve is web site pictures. If you look at the one for the burger, it looks like a million bucks. The burger (and other items) that showed up on our table were pretty much uninspired. While I could, at some level, really care less about presentation in a beer joint, there is a certain degree of misrepresentation. Just a small deal, go, have some beers and grab a burger, this is a pretty good place.", "author": "C G."}

It LOOKED promising what with an extensive beer selection and close proximity to where our hotel was. Unfortunately it was anything BUT a good choice.\nMy boyfriend's steak pot pie was an abomination NOT deserving the name of \"pot pie\" it was, as he so aptly put it, \"a donut on top of a bad curry.\" Seriously. There was no crust surrounding the interior of the ramekin housing this noxious curry \"stew\" but a beignet with some salad greens resting on top. The taste sucked and there was hardly any steak to be found in it. My macaroni and cheese was supposed to include bacon but the server forgot it and instead brought me a side of crumbled bacon bits. WTF?! It's not the same taste sensation AT ALL! And he wouldn't be deterred from doing so. The mac and cheese wasn't cheesy enough and had a creamy and bland sauce. Great. The beer was the best part but also the priciest and not worth it in my opinion.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-05-20", "description": "One star? Yep, that's all this place deserves.  My friends and I were spent about 3 hours here and also a few hundred dollars.  The first server we had was nice.  She never screwed up our drink order and was generally ok.  We started with their giant pretzel appetizer.  It looked so awesome, but it tasted like vegetable oil and was way too salty.  I think it was like $8 bucks, too.  Our sever moved us to another table for dinner.  Our new waiter was this tall hippy guy.  He seemed cool at first, but then it became apparent that he was ridiculously sarcastic/serious.  See, this is a contentious point between me and my friends.  The dude seemed like the most sarcastic man in the whole world, but at the same time he wasn't sarcastic at all.  I found out that he wasn't sarcastic while waiting for the bathroom for 10 minutes, I asked him if he had any bread he could bring to the table.  It seems normal to offer patrons bread when they are drinking tons of beer and eating, right?  Anyways, he said no they had no bread.  The steak sandwich I ordered was on french bread so I figured that they'd have bread around.  I explained that I wanted some bread because I had some expensive cheese that was melting in my purse (ew).  I didn't want to throw out the cheese and I figured we were spending a bunch of money so what did they care if we ate our own cheese.  Well, our giant hippy waiter informed me that I should not eat my own cheese because it would really upset the chef.  He's apparently very *picky*.  If the chef saw my table eating non Monk's Kettle cheese, he would flip out and stab us with some large butcher's knife.  OK, not the words of the giant hippy, but that was the gist.  This all sounds sarcastic, right? Well, it's not.  He was serious.  I confirmed his seriousness when I asked, \"hey, but you wouldn't rat us out to the chef, would you?\"   The giant hippy replied that he would.  :(  He then suggested that we order the giant pretzel, again, and some Monk's kettle expensive cheese.  And then two women walked out of the single stall bathroom......So weird.\n\nWhen my steak sandwich came, I tried to take a bite and I found it to be incredibly chewy.  I investigated my \"medium rare\" skirt steak sandwich and found that the steak was cold in the center and basically still alive (seriously).  It even tasted a little fishy.  I sent it back and when it came back to me, the giant hippy said, \"Aren't you a lucky girl, young lady?\".  I'm pretty young, but it really wasn't cool for the giant non-sarcastic hippy server to belittle me like that.  He never came back to check on the done-ness of the sandwich, and it turned out that it was just as rare as before.  I ate two tiny bites and called it a day.      \n\nSo, overall, I guess this is a decent place to spend the afternoon, but just go for drinks and don't order any food and beware of the giant non-sarcastic hippy jerk.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nApparently, the chef at Monk's Kettle just messaged me.  Here's a copy of his very mature response to my review: \n\nSenor B.\nBlock User    \n37 minutes ago \n\nI'm the chef at Monk's Kettle. That by far was the funniest review of our establishment since we opened. I thank you for writing the best piece of fiction I've read in years. If it were true it would of been even more amazing but the only thing that rang true in that whole statement was 1.) We don't allow outside food for any reason in our tavern because we have a full size menu and frankly, it's just plain tacky to even ask and 2.) your 95% eaten steak sandwich medium rare was brought up to medium. Other then that, if you really think that a chef was going to murder you and the rest of your party for asking for bread, then you have bigger issues then a bad experience at Monk's but I do thank you for patronizing our very successful establishment and welcome you back anytime. Thanks for the laugh!!!! :D", "author": "K B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-19", "description": "Before I get started I'm going to admit this right now: I'm from Philadelphia where I am blessed to have dined many times at Monk's Cafe which is rated one of the best Belgian restaurants in the country and one of the best bars for beer selection in the world. When I see a restaurant with Monk's in the name I immediately assume that I will experience something similar to my beloved hometown joint, but unfortunately that isn't always true.\n\nI consider myself a beer enthusiast and when I learned of Monk's Kettle I knew I had to check it out. At first glance of the food menu I was surprised that one of the most important items on a Belgian menu was missing - mussels. Disappointment aside, I picked up the beer list to get a footing on their selection. I was thoroughly impressed by the draft selection.. around 20 beers including a lot of locals and several Belgians. I ordered a double-IPA and went back to figuring out what to eat. For it's location I found MK's menu to be extremely overpriced. A burger will set you back $11 without toppings with an outrageous $2 for mushrooms, $1 for caramelized onions and more for cheese, etc. My date's burger came out to about $14 with toppings. I opted for the pulled-pork sandwich.\n\nThe food arrived rather quickly which was impressive considering the place was full. The burger was presented on an incredibly nice looking sesame seed bun, but we were unimpressed with how small the patty was; extremely thin, a quarter-pound, maybe. The burger itself with mushrooms, onions and blue cheese was incredibly delicious though, great seasoning and cooked to the correct temperature. My pulled-pork came on an extremely soft (almost too hard to pickup) foccacia roll but the sauce was delicious. We were a little upset about the fries, they weren't so much frites and didn't taste like they were handcut.\n\nWith a decent food experience you might ask why I gave the 3-star score. The real reason is price. $14 for a burger of that size is unheard of, especially in that area of the Mission. On top of that I was very disturbed by the pricing on the beer list. Our waiter who was very helpful in the beer department suggested I try Russian River's Pliny the Elder double-IPA so we ordered a 500ml bottle with two glasses for $11.50. The beer was delicious but here's the problem. Last night I was in both Whole Foods and Healthy Spirits and found a 500ml bottle of Pliny the Elder for $3.79. Never in my life have I seen a restaurant mark up a single bottle of beer that much. Other beers on the menu reflected the same extremely marked up pricing scheme. I know I'm going to catch flak from fellow Yelpers who will tell me that these beer stores buy much larger quantities of the beer, etc., etc. but with Pliny the Elder which is brewed in very small batches that simply is not true.\n\nI called the restaurant to express my concern about their pricing and the manager assured me that \"that's just the restaurant business man, all alcohol gets a 300% markup\". He went on to tell me how Pliny the Elder is a very limited beer and the owners of Monk's Kettle price it high to try to keep it in the bar as long as possible. I found this to be funny considering Russian River explicitly has copy all over the bottle urging you to drink the beer as close to the bottling date as possible because double-IPAs don't age well.\n\nMy anal kvetching aside, if you don't mind spending some money and have an interest in trying beers from around the world, check out Monk's Kettle. Me? I'm going to stick to buying my beers from the amazing selection at Healthy Spirits on Castro for 300% less. Ha!", "author": "Ben K."}

I love the moderate portion sizes, wonderful marriage of flavors, and great quality of ingredients. Beef cheeks with polenta was some of the tastiest beef cheeks I've ever had - rich, buttery, and melt-in-your mouth! The burger is to die for with plenty of juicy fatty beefy goodness, onion jam, and artisan ACME bun, and I love the use of seasonal ingredients like the potato-corn chowder I had there the other day. I ordered some beer to taste as well, got the plight - and it did not arrive in time, so the server brought us four different other kinds to taste as well.

Okay, maybe not saunter; more like edged our way in. \n\nBe that as it may, we were greeted by the friendly host, who cheerfully informed us that it would be about 30-45min or so. However, this fellow had an excellent suggestion. \"Why not hang out at the bar while waiting for your table?

Even Olympia. Seattle sucks. But I do recommend the Reality Czech Pils. Also \"Let's Go Shopping\". \n\nLong story short (too late, I'm sure), our beers were fantastic, service was great; props to the tall fellow with the ponytail who made great suggestions for beer AND food. \n\nMy wedge salad w/bacon was delicious; my Angus burger was piping hot and drenched in flavor. Honey got the scallop pot pie, and I saw paroxysms of pleasure cross her face as she savored her meal. \n\nSide note: atmosphere was fun, and everybody (staff and patrons) were nice and friendly. We had a great experience and will be back. You can count on it. Crowded? A bit. A bit pricey. Perhaps.

Perhaps testament to the chef/ owners capabilities to procure fresh seasonal ingredients and transform burgers, ahi tuna, or pulled pork sandwiches to new levels.  The wine menu is often ignored, however, the beer selection is what makes this place addictive- need your fix of crisp lagers, wheaty, hoppy hefe's, ale, ciders, lambics, stouts- the monk has it all.

All the times I've been there the wait is about 30-45 mins but its worth it. This is a kind of place to keep an open mind and an open wallet. Not that it's extremely expensive to come here but when you ask the waiter to recommend drinks for you, you have to just go with it. The last time I came here with some friends we asked our waiter to bring us something. He took one look at us, asked us a question or two and BAM the drinks were on the table.

A friend and I had dinner there on Friday night and enjoyed the white bean bruschetta, the flank steak sando with gorgonzola aioli (YUM), and the burger, which my friend said was good, though the bun was toasted a bit too much and part of it was rock hard. I worried she might chip a tooth... \n\nThe service was friendly if a bit distracted. It was Friday after all. It was very busy, so I'll not bitch too loudly. Regardless, it is defintely worth a visit. However, I must reiterate that you should avoid the place on popular nights or peak hours. The crowd in there was huge and obnoxious. Again, it was Friday night, and you know, the mission on a Friday... so, I shouldn't expect otherwise...\n\nOriginal review:\nThe caveat is our experience was limited to beer. I cannot yet speak for the food or the service of any staff member besides the bartender. But, I fully anticipate a return visit on, say, a Monday or Tuesday night, or quite late on a Sunday. The worst thing I can say about our experience there was the crowdedness. The place all neck, no bottle, leaving little space for the milling, eager would-be patrons. We hawk-eyed the single teensy bar table and ungraciously swooped it from under several others who were not so vigilant. \n\nAll seating arrangements did seem a bit cramped, or you could call it friendly, depending on who you're dining with. I definitely wouldn't come here with a group that exceeded four very close friends. The room, however, despite it's, shall we say, cozy dimensions, is lovely, with dramatic touches of granite juxtaposed to the dark wood and lamp light. \n\nThe beer list is not only extensive, but also educational, and, according to the brewmaster with whom I was enjoying the evening, unusually accurate. These people know their beer. Our bartender was a bit harried in dealing with the crowd, but we never waited too long for her attention or our beverages. We were also checked upon a couple of times by the equally harried waiter who was on the floor. \n\nAfter devouring an extra-large pizza for brunch while watching football in the afternoon, neither of us was much up for snacks, but the food looked amazing and smelled delicious and I saw people scrape their plates. The charcuterie plate in particular looked fantastic and their food menu in general complied with the principles of buying local and organic wherever possible. \n\nAll in all I have happy feelings about the Monk's Kettle and plan to return there soon for a more robust experience. Though, at those prices ($70--including a rather crazy tip--for six beers. Granted they were quite expensive beers...) I'll probably wait for a pay day.", "author": "Sage R."}

Usually, you ask for some recommendations and they are more than happy to oblige. But I had an experience once where I asked the waiter to give me some advice with the extensive beer selection, and rather than helping, he was snooty and offensive, looking down his nose at me for my lack of knowledge with belgian beers. So to spite him I ordered the \"Oaked Arrogant Bastard,\" a beer they have on tap.

The food was good, however, smaller portioned. My friend and I went there thinking we'd leave full and satisfied. We had to keep ordering. We had the roast pork grill of the day ($23)  and the burger ($16 w/ bacon added) to split each along with each ordering an appetizer. Drinks add up fast. Great date place and definitely a scene to see- the place is packed and you need to get there before 6pm to even dream of not having a wait. The food is very good, we just thought the portions were small for the price. The beer selection is good, just overpriced.

At almost every other bar it is way cheaper -- like $4.50 for a 16 oz. pour of Anchor Steam.  Also, they have PBR and Oly, which means they are just trying to cater to the filthy people who indulge in the cheap taste of alcoholic piss.  It is so fucking frustrating that they would have those two beers which ruin the other 128 choices on the menu!

What makes it not so great is how we were moved 3 times in our short visit. First, while there were only 2-3 couples there, we were told we could not sit at a table unless we were ordering food. We said that we might be once we looked at a menu but, instead of being seated in an open table or booth, we were directed towards our seats at the bar, right next to the thru-way into the kitchen. Then we decided to order food so we were moved to a table. When our server came back around, she then told us we needed to move to yet another table (from a 4 top to a 2 top) so they could seat other \"dinner patrons\". So, begrudgingly, we moved again to a table so small that the 3 plates we did order didn't fit simultaneous with one another or the two beers we were drinking. So despite excellent beer selections and the fact that everything that I ate was really tasty, I am not eager to repeat the musical chairs game while policy dictates action over common sense (aka, give the paying customers there now priority over \"dinner patrons\" who may or may not ever arrive.) Had I been made comfortable from the get go, we might not have escaped immediately after our check was paid.\n\nThe rub? The two very small women who were eventually seated in the large booth we were eschewed away from didn't end up ordering any food. Just a single beer each and then an hour to drink them. \n\nTo Monk's Kettle's credit, they did comp us a single beer after bitching about being moved around three times. *shrug*", "author": "Rocky H."}

The food is acceptable, but the atmosphere is hell.\n\nMy husband and I went for dinner and drinks last night. We added our names to the waiting list & waited patiently in the ear-splitting atmosphere. About 15 minutes later we managed to get a drinks menu and ordered some drinks to keep ourselves busy. The drinks were fine and arrived quickly. About a half hour later we checked in with a waitress to see how much longer it would be for a table. She gave us a slackjawed \"don't know.\" After pressing she informed us that we'd have to ask the \"keeper of the list.\" Apparently, it didn't occur to her that she could communicate with her coworkers. Anyhow, when we asked the rather apathetic looking \"keeper of the list\"  for an estimate of the wait , he responded \"dunno\" and then went back to reading his newspaper outside.\n\nSeated at the bar near us was an incredibly shrill woman with an unfortunate fondness for whooping.  It was so loud we both quickly developed a headache.\n\nBy this time we were starving and would have left if  that wouldn't have meant starting to wait all over again at another restaurant. When we were finally seated our waiter was fairly quick and the food was acceptable--in a batchelor sort of way. I had a pot pie that was no pie at all and looked as if it was topped with frozen puff pastry. My husband had a pulled pork sandwich that tasted of storebought sauce or some \nkind of lack of imagination.\n\nAll but the most confirmed batchelor' can make better food at home... and should try before visiting this place.\n\nThere were tons of staff, but not much in the way of service.", "author": "Shannon S."}

I placed my fate in the hands of the sever and he brought me a goblet of sweet tasty Belgian Ale, a hearty 11% ABV which paired well with the food we ordered.  A large basket of salty crispy fries with three tasty dipping sauces- curry aioli, garlic aioli, and chipotle ketchup.  The lobster pot pie was a creamy masterpiece topped with puff pastry.  The beef carpaccio was bland but its fried capers provided a crispy touch.\nAll in all, this place is above-average for beer and food, and the service is top-notch.

And what's with the reserved table thing?  Some spots do a good job navigating the bar-restaurant boundary, but Monk's Kettle doesn't seem to have figured it out.

The mac n cheese was kinda bland. needed better cheese, more flavor. the charcuterie was ok. the duck proscuitto was really oily. \nand on to the entrees. i had the lamb burger. the fries was quite good, i like those thin fries. the burger, bland bland bland. i tasted not a drop of lamb, and i'm pretty sure they had not seasoned the meat either. just not good. i didnt even finish it. one other guy had it and he didnt finish it either. warning sign, dont get the lamb burger.\nanother guy had the chicken pot pie. again, looked good, but they must be afraid of flavor here, because it had none. If everything tastes like chicken and chicken tastes like nothing, where does that leave us?\nand finally the pork chop. Honestly, I was jealous of my buddy who ordered that, because it was the best food of the night. maybe a bit too much sauce, but it was well cooked and had flavor. well done. \nso with good beer selection, good pretzel and good pork chop, and a lot of other misses, i would recommend coming in for beers and pretzels...", "author": "Rich B."}

The last time was just a couple weeks ago - a friend was taking me out for a belated b-day dinner.\n\nFirst off - great beer selection - but that goes without saying.  Friendly staff - good job there - always willing to chat about the beers and I've always gotten good service.\n\nI can't remember what I got the very first time I went Monks Kettle - must have partook of the beer a bit too much.  But the second and last time I was there I got a pulled pork sandwich.\n\nThe previous time, the sandwich was very tasty with jicama slaw on the side.  I didn't want to take any chances so I ordered the same thing a couple weeks ago - wow - I think someone must have been smoking bowls in the kitchen because it was a completely different sandwich - runny, drippy, BBQ pork - almost like sloppy-joe.  When I took a bit of the sandwich the filling oozed out the sides - messy-ass meal indeed. \n\nAlso disappointing was the bread pudding.  It was very dry.  Probably been sitting in the fridge for a few days.   I had to gulp about 4 cups of coffee to get half of it down.  I left the rest of it for the dishwasher.\n\nLastly, the place is a bit cramped and I had the chair side of a duece which was adjacent to the aisle.  I got bumped in the head repeatedly by people going by.\n\nIf you go there, be sure to score the window seat, don't order the bread pudding, and hopefully the cooks in the kitchen wait until after their shift to smoke the fatties....", "author": "David M."}

We were sad they did not have brunch but decided to go for it anyway. We were seated promptly and greeted within in a moment. The server, Jason, was friendly and gave his two cents when asked about menu items. We both really enjoyed what we had. This is a great little place for lunch but a bit overpriced. Also, it cost $2.50 to substitute a side salad for french fries. The salad consisted of a small handful of field greens on the plate with my sandwich. I am hoping these were magic greens.

Monk's Kettle takes the Mission to new culinary heights, and not just because it's the only non Asian or Latin cuisine around for 4 blocks - it's just really delicious and simple food that plays to their strengths well, and that is you guessed it - BEER.  What I appreciate the most about this place is the degree of commitment they pay to the beer here. They don't play around with the quality by any means whatsoever. Just like what you would find at a really upscale restaurant when you look at a menu and see entrees besides a suggested a wine selection. You'll find a beer pairing coupled with an upscale version of a \"comfort food\" such as a Chicken Pot Pie, or better yet - a nice Neiman Ranch burger. I went here a few months ago with the awesome Carrie C. and must say - I have been dying to go back. It's so great to know that their kitchen is open until midnight. Monk's Kettle deserves 5 stars and more. Please note, the menu is a bit pricey, so prepare to spend around $20 a person for dinner and a drink.

How could we say no to such enthusiasm?  I'm not a beer drinker, so excuse me if this is inane, but I'd describe it as the shockingly attractive lovechild of Chimay and kombucha.  Smooth, fine bubbles, acidic bite.  As our new bar buddies exclaimed, \"It's vinegary.

It is mild and sweet, with a unique herbiness.\n\nWe only had snacks, but the food was excellent.  Everything was hearty and satisfyingly recognizable: pretzels, cheese, burgers-- we're at a pub after all!-- but with a slow food/gourmet twist.  \n\nTo address fellow patrons' complaints: Yes, it's crowded at night and waiting sucks.  But, you know, it's a great bar in the Mission.  And one *does* find hipsters here, but to complain about hipsters in this neighborhood is like bitching about old Italian ladies in North Beach.

I figured, it had better be good and worth the wait, in this economy: I'm talking Kobe beef, Belgian ale and some seriously good sides.\n\nSo we idle over to the Kilowatt, not our regular dive but saw a few friends over there, and it was happy hour, so perfect.\n\nOne hour later, we get the call that our table is ready. We are seated next to a loud group of dot-commers from Bangalore or some tech concern - loud, drunk geeks who can't seem to hit \"special shut down\" on the weekends. Ambiance? Non existent.\n\nOur 'beer sommellier' comes over and attempts to pair our beers with our burgers (now I've seen everything). I was actually rather excited for this burger to be better than sex the way she described it. With a creamy Belgian ale on the way, I was willing to forgive even the \"Killer App\" developers to the right of me. \n\nSo, I'm one Kilowatt margarita to the wind, the dot commers are getting more animated regarding their peerless industry prowess, and 3 sips into my beer, the plates are plunked down in front of us. Nothing like drawing out the evening, people. They make you wait one hour, but your dinner had better not take longer than 30 minutes, door to door. Decent food, for sure, but this $13 burger was just no big deal. Not bad, not great, but just nothing to write home about. I mean, I can understand waiting in line for Pauline's Pizza (artisanal and organic ingredients), Suppenkuche or Waldwerk (yummy German home cooking with imported beer on tap too). But the difference is that Suppenkuche and Waldwerk don't get all prissy about their beer and the pairing of it with entrees, they are German, (East and West) and they serve beer the way they drink it, wordlessly and without hyperbole. \n\nBut I digress. So the dot com guys are slathering over themselves, and my husband and I are wondering what the big deal is here - the forgettable burgers? The worlds largest pretzel? The beer sommellier? The fact that culture vultures all over town are willing to wait one hour for something that just ain't that impressive.\n\nSo we get our bill, 2 burgers, 2 beers, 40 bux. We could have gone to the Big 4 for the best cheeseburger in town for the same price. Or Whiz Burger for half the price. But it was \"date night\" so we decided to give it a whirl (based on all the 4 and 5 star Yelp reviews).\n\nBut in every cloud, there is a silver lining:\n\nIf you believe that \"it's not the destination, it's the journey\" philosophy like I do, you know that the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.... And working off the \"House that Jack Built\" methodology: if we hadn't had to wait an hour to get into Monks Kettle, we wouldn't have gone to the Kilowatt, and wouldn't have seen our friend Jessica who stated that our dear friends THE HOOKS and Socals legendary THE ZEROS were playing at the Elbo room, and we wouldn't have called Ronan Mulligan and he wouldn't have put us on the guest list and then we wouldn't have seen bands we would have happily paid to see individually. But together? Gratis? Even better! Considering that THE ZEROS were playing out when I was in braces (and on the opposite side of the country), I would never have seen them at all if we hadn't eaten at Monk's Kettle.

Overall, there were some very tasty items on the Monk's menu, and it was hard to decide what to get, so I went for the most basic item (burger), and was quite pleased.

I love this place, so I want to give them a great review, but they are small and I don't want to have to share. So let me tell you how awesome they are, and you will promise not to make it too crowded for me to get in. yeah? okay!\n\nSo I'd been wanting to come here for a long time, and finally had the opportunity to do so this weekend. I originally came by around 10:30ish , we were a group of 5 and were promptly told at the door that there was no room for us. We were disappointed, so we went across the street to tokyo-a-go-go for a bit, and then to a local bookstore before coming back around 12. We got in and after spending a good 15 minutes trying to get the bartenders attention with no luck, opted for a table, and ordered some snacks and drinks. It's a small place, so it was nice to be able to sit down and talk to each other without being spread out all over the place. This is definitely not the kind of place where you want to go with more than one or two people. that being said, the five of us had a marvelous time. Our server was super friendly, and helped recommend a few beers. We somehow missed the last call for food, but they still agreed to fry us up a second basket of fries. These fries were the most addictive thing in the world. Not only were the dipping sauces good, but they must had fried them in magic oil because I hadn't had fries that good since I was in Germany. \n\nCome closing time, one of the bar keeps is trying to get everyone to finish up their drinks quickly, and we're joking a little because we have half a glass of Hitachino left and are squabbling over who gets to finish it when Mr. Obnoxious buts in. From our playful jokes with the bar keep Mr. O takes it to the next level of fight. Sure, the clock on the wall was ten minutes fast, but can you blame them for wanting us all out before 2am so they don't get fined? seems perfectly reasonable to me. besides... it's 10 minutes, it's not like you were going to drink all that much in the last ten minutes. I didn't get to see how it ended, the manager was on the phone with the cops when we walked out, not in the mood for drama.\n\nAll in all, they have great food, an AMAZING selection of beer and a super friendly and helpful staff. I felt sorry for them having to deal with Mr. O at 2am, but I guess drunks will be drunks. \n\nNow that I have discovered this place I'm going to be dragging just about everyone I know here, weather they like beer or not.", "author": "Allyson S."}

Was hankering for some drinks and yummy grub and this did the trick!\n\nWe had to wait over an hour but that was not too big of a deal since they take your number and text you when your table is ready.  We went across the street and had some beers and ran right over when they called.  \n\nThe place is very small, but cozy.  I don't think I would be very thrilled about eating at the bar (too many bodies in such a tight space), but if you were flying solo, probably wouldn't be that bad.  We got a small booth in the back for our party of 4 and it was perfect.\n\nThe service was awesome.  The host was upfront about the wait, but very cool about contacting us via text once our table was ready.  Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the menu and available choices for beer and wine.  Their list is huge so any help deciphering is great.  They also offer beer/food pairings on the menu so you aren't lost in too many choices.  Our server did a great job of pouring the beer and made it seem like it was special treatment.  Which was probably good b/c the beer cost $14!  (However, if you want something on the cheap side, they have $2 cans of Tecate beer).  I drank wine and was impressed by their selection considering their specialty is beer.\n\nThe food was awesome.  We got two appetizers to share, the mac + cheese (w/ bacon on top of course!) and the wild mushroom bruschetta.  Both were fantastic, but I would recommend the mac + cheese if you're going to go with just one.  I had the steak sandwich which was perfect.  I would have liked maybe a little less garlic aioli, but overall a very solid sandwich.  The steak was still tender and easy to bite.  My dinner companions had the lamb burger, the chicken sandwich and the steak.  Everyone was happy with our selections.  The fries that came with all the sandwiches were great--well salted and slightly crispy.\n\nSo if you're into beer and good pub food, head to the Monk's Kettle.  If you're bothered by a long wait or a crowded and noisy atmosphere, probably you should go elsewhere.", "author": "Jennie B."}

They have a diverse, ever-changing selection from around the world, and around the corner. Beers are served in genre specific glass wear, so the amount of the pour will vary, as will the shape of the glass. Check the list for how many ounces you get for the price, and beware, those smaller cheaper choices add up quick. The bartenders are always cool about giving a sample from the taps, if your not sure about committing to a glass. They seem to be more about presenting you with a beer experience, than just pouring you a pint. I've had some great food there as well. I highly recommend their cheese plate, which is well portioned, and includes some other yummy nibbles to pair with your choices. They also make a great burger, and have other tasty seasonal food offerings. If you are a dark beer lover, you must try the nitrogen charged, Fuller London Porter, pure heaven.\nIf it's just a great beer selection and prices you want, go to Toronado.

Only problem was that things were over-salted - my friends fries suffered similarly - and the service was a bit behind (probably due to the ridiculous crowd).

Some people are amazing artists...I had to doodle around some of the artwork...there were faces, comic sayings, and even phone numbers LOL  If you find yourself needing a munchy but do not want a meal, I highly recommend their homemade giant pretzels with stone ground mustard and house made cheddar ale sauce. Delicious and satisfying and actually paired well with the Belgian Crisp Apple Cider beer. This beer was sweet, lush, crisp, and tasted like champagne.

I wolfed it down much to the detriment of the conversation at the table (sorry dear and understanding husband for my silence). For desert, the cherry cobbler. To be honest, this wasn't a real cobbler but it was still very nice. Tart wild cherries under a layer of puff pastry and vanilla ice cream.

I would definitely recommend splitting deserts whenever possible.\n\nAnd now the beer: other posters have commented on the extensive nature and of the list which covers so many palettes and tastes.

Plus, its SF and not cheap indian or mexican, which is what's mostly available late in the mission.\n\nThe decor and menu are great.  I love how there are explanations for each kind of beer on the menu.\n\nI went late on a sunday night with a couple of friends, and I was supremely exhausted.  The bartender noticed this and took me for a drunk and told the rest of the staff not to serve me alchohol.  That's a little harsh for not ever seeing me before and not interacting with me at all, but since I wasn't too thirsty it didn't really matter, and I'm sure that the late sunday night shift is going to be filled with more oddballs than a thurs-sat.  Then I looked at the prices of the beer and I really didn't want one.  I'm not a complete beer expert, but there is a wonderful Belgian beer bar near my place in oakland that I frequent and I recognized a lot of the beers on the monk's menu, and the price disparity was frightening.  Its not that there are beers over $10, its that there are plenty of them, and some over $20-30.  It just seems like price gouging to me.", "author": "Roland G."}

Most of the time I want one I'd prefer not to have a host stop me at the door and act like I'm probably going to be a problem because I want a beer. Especially at a place that has its main focus on beer. While the selection is really nice, the beers at The Monk's Kettle are EXTREMELY overpriced. San Francisco has a few great places to drink really good beer, and this is the most ridiculously expensive one I've been to. They even charge out the ass for local beers. For those of us who buy bottles of artisan beers regularly it's a little insulting. This place is also usually uncomfortably packed. It's tiny. So if you have to stand and you block the path of the waiters, they are understandably annoyed. On the plus side the food here has been exceptional every time I've had it, and the service is as good as it could be given the parameters. If you want something delicious and don't mind waiting a while to get into a loud, crowded spot with overpriced beer, this could be your place. Nine times out of ten I'll keep walking and go to Frjtz (good food, a few belgian beers), Bender's (awesome food, decent beer selection), or Shotwell's (no food, outstanding beer selection).

We had wanted to visit on a Friday night, but we were told that it was WAY too small for four people to get in (without waiting for a long time) during busy times.  After walking right by it a few times (the signage is not terribly obvious), we entered and were greeted by a warm atmosphere and a friendly bartender.  It IS really tiny, with a maximum occupancy of no more than 50 or so, but it was lunchtime on a weekday and we practically had the place to ourselves.  We started off by sharing a soft pretzel, served with house-made beer cheese sauce (drooooool) and stone ground mustard; it was a chewy, salty, perfect start to the afternoon.  Fiance opted for the grilled chicken sandwich with house-cured pepper bacon, herb aioli, and brie.  It was HUGE, but it was so tasty, it disappeared in no time flat.  I chose the lamb burger, which came with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, and a cucumber tzatziki sauce.  YUM.  The meat must have had some cinammon in the seasoning mix, as it had a sweet-salty-spicy taste that really wowed me.  The fries that came with both sandwiches were excellent--crunchy, hot, tender, and well-salted.  We really enjoyed our experience, and we had a great time talking to the bartender about the various beer offerings.  No wonder this place gets so crowded on the weekends!", "author": "Betty R."}

Had heard about the huge beer selection and headed there with a friend after work.  No problem getting a seat at the bar at 7pm. The beers lived up to the reputation -- huge selection of draught and bottled beers, with great choices for local brews and some seasonal selections. However, what took us by surprise was the food. I have devoured bread pudding in restaurants and homes for more than 20 years and this was truly the best bread pudding I have ever had. Everything else was also really well done -- pork tenderloin with bacon cream sauce (!), mac & cheese, salad. A tiny bit pricey, but they make no pretensions of serving cheap bar food, so it was worth the price (we got out of there stuffed to the gills and over the legal limit at $40 each including tip). The menu also has beer pairings, which I thought was a little OTT at first, but the Canadian beer we had with our pork tenderloin was indeed a great match. We left around 9p on a Tuesday and it was getting crowded, so I suspect that its insane during peak hours.

I had pictured this place much larger in my head.  I don't know why...I've dined in hundreds of SF restaurants before.  Annnnyways, I loved it.  I'm not too knowledgable when it comes to beer so I asked the bartender what he'd recommend in the way of light beers.  He kindly brought out two samples for me to try in mini mugs, fun!  We then ordered the cheese plate, the goat cheese appetizer and the mac and cheese.  Yes, we were in the mood for cheese, okay?  Is that a problem???  Moving on, the cheese plate was fantastic and our waiter happily brought more toasts as we quickly ran out.  The goat cheese appetizer was really good but oh so filling!  When we finally got to the mac and cheese, I was so full, I could hardly breathe!  But I charged on, because well, it's mac and cheese.  And it was dang good!  The only thing I'd have to say is that it was quite peppery but that certainly didn't stop me.  I must say, prices were decent as well.

My pulled pork sandwich was very average and i saw the line cook heat it up in a small pot to order...hmm, why not keep it simmering or something? It had super hot and then cold spots inside and for $13 I expected more. The fries were average and they need kosher salt on the table. My partner had the veggie burger and he said it was OK. I will go back if its not busy and sit at the bar and drink that lovely Belgium beer I had but think I'll skip the food. Oh, its not cheap, lunch was $60!  3 beers, 1 pretzel and 2 sandwiches.

So the giant pretzel is super cool - 2 sauces, a creamy mustard type sauce and a stone ground mustard. Yum. We ordered a reasonable bottle of Pinot Noir eventually - local CA, tasted great. I got the Lobster Pot Pie - thumbs up - super rich with a velvety sauce. The blue cheese wedge salad was another success, great big chunks of blue cheese, perfect bacon pieces, cherry tomatoes.

I dont care how that sounds I just dont see the attraction. Anyways, this place is great but Im not the only one that has this feeling so its super duper crowded starting right at 5. Well one day took a vaca day on a tuesday so this was the only time I could actually relax so I went here and just like sat from like 2-5 and had a great time since I wasnt getting squooshed. This is the place that got me into Belgian beers I just love thier selections. The food is really really tasty but its overpriced i mean come on....You can go to other places , get the same quality, and at lower prices... I have eaten like 4x here and I havnt tried anything other than that damn pork chop. It's braised in beer or something and super duper thick...They use the cuts that would allow one to stuff it. Because of this entre, I have started researching how to braise pork with beer bc I cant afford to spend $28 on a pork chop but its a damn good pork chop!!! Oh gosh, I always leave the potatoe/starch when i go out to eat in order to cut the carbs but here-well- that would be a sin not to medntion a waste. Its like au gratin or sumthin but they must use multiple artisan cheeses in thier recipe. You cant waste local artisan cheese..thats just un american..its quality scalloped pototaes for sure you cant help but eat it and  then the brussel sproats with truffle oil.  Im all about American food slow cooking and it seems thats what they do. It  does take a while to get the chop bu they warn you and im usually too busy getting sloshed anyways...Its just good but not that affordable. After a couple 9% beers you dont really think about what stuff is costing until you get a bill for like $85 for just your stuff including %18 tip..this is the cost for 3 imported beers $15 dollar a pop imported beers (why go ther if you arnt going Belgium)..and the $28 pork chop..I had to stop going here bc I was spending too much $. They have cheaper beers, but I want something special or else whats the point of going out. Also, I went to Whole Foods and saw that the same pork chop cut was sellin for about $12 a chop so I got to thinkin....yes they need to make a profit but i cook alot and its not hard to make so i had to slow down with this place...but yeah i would bring out of town guests here for sure. Gotta get there at like 4:30 if you want a table..firts come first serve and the bar is crowded. I sat there once and just drank and stared at the chic next to me's food. They usually have sports goin on the TV so its good for sitten and veggin out...Her food looked great...some delious looking fat steak. It was that think cut again...I will say they care about thier meats and i very much apprciate that. Im getting to be a meat and poultry snob these days.... They cooked it nice amd medium rare too. The problem is that its getting more crowded. Its startng to get to the point where you cant be like ...oh why dont i just take a stroll to Monk for a beer...bc its hard to get two seats together unless you get there at like 3pm. annoying. Also, the service is so so....The owner is cool and personable but his people....its like the bartender dude...I had a hard time getting served and getting a menu...he totally saw us... Mayby bc Im not a gay male but he acted like  we went gonna order anything..mayby cuz we are not a group he thinks he cant make $$ off of us.. I had to beg for a menu. He seemed surprised i was ordering food. I went here like a year ago and the staff was totally cool and they gave you tasting and education...Now they dont.

He was pissed that we didn't decide on our drinks and then when we asked for water, he acted as if we were asking for something free.  When we did decide what to drink, he delayed returning to our table, and he also did when we ordered food.  Finally, when the food came, he threw a spoon on the table for soup that my girlfriend ordered after already giving her one.   This was the point where I felt insulted, especially since our previous experiences had been wonderful.  So, the food was great, as always, and the service was epicly awful.  We'll probably go back because we love the food, but don't ask for Jake.", "author": "Zach H."}

I ordered a veggie burger and substituted a salad for the fries and was charged a $2.50 \"up charge\" for the salad (ludricous). I'm not positive on the next statement, but I believe the patty of the veggie burger was deep fried.  If not, it some how was crispy and greasy, which is not good (greasy) if one is ordering a veggie burger. Oh, and I added cheddar cheese which brought the total for the veggie burger w/cheese and \"up charged\" salad to $15.  Yikes!  I also ordered a glass of french chardonnay (the only chardonnay by the glass) for $8, maybe $8.50, which was such a small pour, that there were most likely six more \"small/short pours\" left in the bottle.  Overall, it was a bad deal or maybe you gathered my opinion already? Oh,  I forgot to add that the chardonnay was not very tasty :-)", "author": "louis l."}

Delicious beers, a pleasant, modern atmosphere, and a friendly staff. The unisex bathroom is such a refreshing change from the other dirty, stinky, paperless restrooms that The Monk's Kettle shares 16th Street with. It feels like you are in your rich uncle's bathroom with the wood accents, curtains, furniture, and lavender candle buring on the walnut armoire in the corner. The kitchen is separated by large chalkboards with chalk so that you can sit, sip a beer, and draw. Or you can sign your name while waiting to go pee. Enough about the asthetics. Good bar food. This place looks like you would spend $12 on a mustard pretzel but it's about $6! All of the menu items are very reasonable and from the few I've sampled, delicious. There is something for everybody, from a juicy cheeseburger to vegan chili. This is a definite must if you are in the Mission and in the mood for yummy food and good beer....oh, and a nice bathroom.", "author": "Greggory O."}

And i truly admire the waitstaff, because im sure night after night of screaming \"excuse me! pardon me! right behind you sir!\" must put quite a strain on ones vocal chords. yet they are still friendly and willing to chat with me casually about what beer will pair well with my giant pretzel and fries.", "author": "stephanie z."}

All of the waiters are really knowledgable about beer (which, sad to say, I know little about) and make excellent recommendations if you, like myself, don't know what you're doing. The Boyfriend, an avid beer-fan, loves this place as well. It's very small and easy to miss and there's always a line but you can put your name down, leave your number and they'll call you when they're ready to seat you. The place is always crowded but I think that adds to the fun atmosphere. I know some people have complained that it's too \"smooshy\" in there, but real estate in SF is hard to come by. Suck it up and get ready to get cozy with your neighbors. I really like the burgers but they're very large - don't eat too much before going to Monk's. For appetizers, I would recommend the mac-n-cheese with bacon which was apparently delicious (I didn't have any - it's a long story as to why not) or the pretzel (served warm and soft). Their specials change and I don't know if they repeat but the lobster pot pie was fabulous - puffy pastry with deliciousness inside.", "author": "Christine P."}

The ambiance is pretty cool with dark wood and little candles everywhere. I like the glow that it gave the place. We weren't really in the mood for beer (which we didn't know it was mainly a beer place, or we would have waited till we were in the mood since they have HUNDREDS of selections.) I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries, curry aioli and a slaw, my BF ordered the chicken pot pie. My sandwich was really good and I ate it all!!! The pot pie was very creamy and also delicious, but the helping was rather small, he ended up eating anything left on my plate. =P It was a good time, other then the 45 minute wait in the cold (the place is small, so there was no waiting area, but we gave the hostess our number and he called us when our table was ready.) I'm sure the beer is great and they may get more stars once I've actually tried any of them.

And a damn good thing we arrived around 7:15, because at 7:45 at least 10 people showed up simultaneously and stayed for the remainder of the night. Keep in mind this place only has about 5-6 booths and a bar that seats 10-15 max, so a good deal of patrons were standing. After 20 minutes of waiting a booth opened up for us. The bottled beer is a little expensive, especially if you're aiming for one of the lesser knowns from far away countries (or Santa Rosa apparently..), but most of the drafts ran $4-5. The food was pretty tasty though. I had the burger with white cheddar and sauteed onions, one friend had the BBQ Pork Sandwich, the other friend the steak sandwich. All three of us had no complaints. I guess after the add-ons on my burger, $13.50 is getting to the top of what I'd ever pay for a hamburger. It was juicy and definitely one of the better burgers I'd had.

Glad to see that SF is sprouting more places that serve food past 10pm. I've been to NOPA and I've been to Beretta, so I had to try out this place. Showed up at 11pm after watching The Dark Knight at the Metreon. It took quite a while before we were noticed standing at the door. We were seated and the menus were dropped. I was very disappointed that they didn't offer the full menu - only apps and \"in between breads.\" When I looked online I saw a menu with salad and entree options and those were what I was after. We almost left immediately after realizing we couldn't eat anything that wasn't a bread cheese bomb (and probably should have in retrospect), but we were hungry and so went through with it. The service was okay. Even though they were slow they could have used another hand on the floor (there was only one guy running the whole place). Once our orders were taken all arrived promptly enough. My girlfriend had the pulled pork on \"focaccia\" and I the chicken with bacon and brie. The onion slice on my sandwich was gigantic (like 1/3 an onion) so we took it off and used it as a saucer on which to place her nasty jicama slaw salad in a ramikin. The pulled pork was totally off. The chicken was alright, a little dry. No tastebuds bursting with joy and I felt a bit ill afterwards. I do see how people could be into this place - don't not try it just because I didn't like it.", "author": "pax r."}
