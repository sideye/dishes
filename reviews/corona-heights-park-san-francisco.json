The wooden chips they added make all the difference.\n\nI am a dog walker so I like to use this park as a variation for my dogs. Beautiful views and everything is well kept.\n\n2 things I dont like: \n- The fences on the street/housing side are too low. So if a crazy dog loses a ball there.. who knows what'll happen. It hasn't happen in my case but it's really easy to jump over for medium to large sized dogs\n\n- Some dog walkers here think they own the park and are assholes. It varies from flat out ignoring you to getting yelled at because you missed one of your 8 dogs take a dump. Don't have eyes in the back of my head. I wish tho. Fix yourself people, and maybe pick up dog waste you see that somebody might have missed. Not everyone is an *ssh*le.", "author": "Styn V."}

Blackberry bushes adorn the beginning of this path in the summertime. Hiking-wise the park has some trails but it seems to be more popular for people walking dogs and hanging out with friends taking in the view mesmerized by its beauty.  To make it more of a longer hike it's best to add on Buena Vista Park and/or the Saturn and Vulcan stairs nearby.\n\nOn a clear day the view is amazing and you can see all the way to the East Bay but keep it mind it can get very windy here.", "author": "Joan W."}

There are views of the city and it is a different view than the Twin Peaks area. It was completely new to me and then we somehow made our way to Buena Vista Park. This path is really unique and not something that I have done. From Castro to the Haight District, it takes an hour. It is uphill and downhill.

It's one place that's pretty unique and stands out from the hustle and bustle of San Francisco. Once you go up to the right sections, it's virtually sound proof. I had no idea it was going to be so calming. This is not the only best part about Corona Heights Park, believe it or not there is ample parking available if you are not taking public transit. I originally thought there was going to be less parking but even during pride weekend, there are still spots available at the museum attached and did I mention everything is free except food? I had no idea the park is in a rugged setting. It actually hugs a small hill. There is something for everyone here. If you play tennis or did so before, this is the place for you. Last this park has no tourists, it's all locals and they are real nice. There's something for everyone\nDrawback: bathrooms are limited here so don't drink too much fluids upon arriving. Shade can be hard to find on a hot day so plan ahead. Despite being close to public transport the commute to this area can be slow on city event days.", "author": "Michael W."}

It's probably almost as good as Twin Peaks and considerably less crowded. I like that it's nearly outside my back door, easily accessible on foot and offers a stellar view of the city in virtually all directions. It's a fairly quiet urban oasis, tucked away in the Corona Heights neighborhood. More rock and dirt than trees and brush, it's a well-maintained city park.\n\nThe dog run is maybe a little overrun.

My friend and I were traveling from Land's End to Mission when Google Maps routed us past this park. We saw the giant hills and knew that we needed to park and take a walk up this hill to see what we were missing. Street parking wasn't terribly difficult to find near the park--and it doesn't seem like a super frequented park since there weren't that many people there.\n\nAnyways, it's a light 5-minute walk up paved steps to get to the top. We went the day after #hellastorm so it was pretty muddy and gross, but I'm sure it would have been lovely on a normal day. The views are SPECTACULAR. I think the photos on Yelp definitely do it justice. You're very much almost in the center ish area of SF so you get great views to the north, east, and south. I don't remember views of the west, but maybe we just forgot to check. Anyways I just dig the place since it gives really nice views--not sure how it would hold up in the fog?

Cool! \n\nI went here with friends this past weekend during a trek around the mission, and this was one of the highlights of the day! We were somewhat disappointed when we had to climb hill after hill just to find another one waiting, but once we got to the top we were happy we made the climb. The 360 degree view of the city was fantastic! The Sutro Tower was just peeking out beyond the clouds, the skyline was at the extent of our vision towards the east, and the Mission sprawled out at our feet had an incredible amount of diversity. Looking down in all directions, perched at the top of the rock formation at the summer, we felt like kings and queens. \n\nI don't know how much of a \"dog park\" this is, but even if that is what the place is marketed as, it was great as a people park too! We started out on 16th Street looking for an entrance there, but the hole in the fence had been patched up. We then wandered along Flint Street until we found the steps and path that led up past the tennis courts to branch off to the building, but we decided to continue on to the right and head to the bench overlooking the east, where we stopped for a meal. There was a squatter's little camp nestled into the fencing at the bottom of the area though, which detracted a little from the view. After the quick break we continued the climb up the deteriorating wooden/dirt terrace steps up higher, where we took a side path directly up to the summit.

Yesterday, I was with 1 Singaporean tourist  friend at the Randall Museum.  I hadn't been there in such a long time, but I knew it was free and, near the parking lot, had an awesome view of SF.  As we were walking into the museum, my tourist friend noticed a person up on the peak and asked how he got up there.  Initially not knowing about this, I told him I didn't know so we shrugged it off and enjoyed the museum. \n\nI'm so glad he noticed the person because after our short visit to the museum, we decided to take a \"detour\" to find out how the person went up the mountain.  We walk to the side of the museum and, lo and behold, we see a hiking trail; my tourist friend got so excited he decided to run up the long, but not-so-steep stairs, while I took my time climbing them.  Turn around, and WOW....welcome to SF indeed!  The city in all its glory!  Definitely a better view than the daytime view at Twin Peaks (Twin Peaks is better for the night view of the city).  Because there were flora in the way, I was motivated to continue to want to get a better view.  I finally reach the top and that 360 view was absolutely breath-taking.  \n\nWith the current weather feeling like Indian-summer, SF and Bay Area locals MUST hike this trail before the fog rolls and/or the rains arrive.  This is THE most local place to stop and and quietly soak in the beauty of the city.  No words can describe the view.

But there are great views, and it's walkable from nearby neighborhoods.  The official entrance is on Roosevelt Way -- we tried wandering in up a very steep 16th St. hill and eventually turned around; it turns out you can get to the park trail from there (near the tennis courts) but there's only a very steep narrow dirt path with nothing to hold on to, so you're better off coming up by the gentler path if you're not feeling up to something strenuous and possibly precarious.

It's a special place for me because I hiked up to it on my first day when I moved here. I had never been to SF before and had only seen some pictures of the city, so I was in full exploration mode. I woke up from the hostel early to walk around, and made a new friend named Christian a couple hours later. He showed me the F Market line, which I thought was the coolest thing. We headed up Market toward Castro on the F-line. At about Octavia street is where the Red Rock comes into view, and I instantly started asking Christian about it. As soon as we got off the F-line, we headed up to there. I'll never forget the feeling that day sitting on that rock. It's a towering lookout in the middle of the city.\n\nIt really is an amazing spot, even if it isn't your first day in your new home. Now i live a couple blocks from it, and it's still the number one place I take my SF-newbie friends to see. It's just as nice a park as Tank Hill, but a little more touristy & you have to occasionally pick up after some other jerk's broken beer bottle. For the most part though, the park is in great shape, mostly because the fellow San Franciscans tend to take pride in it. It's also a great spot to sit and watch the downtown fireworks.\n\nThe best approach to the peak from Castro is to walk up States Street next to the Gay Cleaners (yes, it's called Gay Cleaners) until you see a small road on your right that leads into a lower park area. There's a switchback path on your left that takes you up to Randall Museum. Go around the back of Randall Museum and you'll find a dirt path that leads you up to the top.", "author": "Mike W."}
