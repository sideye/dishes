I went to tataki on a Friday evening. First of all, the place is in a very good location on California street. Looks tiny from outside, but long from inside. We just had a 15 minute wait and they dont take reservations on Friday and Saturday evenings. The place is quite clean, not smelly at all( I have experienced a few Japanese places that smell a lot, I mean seafood smell!!). I loved the EDMish and house music there.\n\nAbout the food - real good miso soup, dumplings in the appetizer and the sushi. All the vegetarian options were great!! They were uniquely made with good combo of veggies like beet and asparagus. I loved their sake too and it is served in a quite decent quantity. \n\nOverall, I appreciate this place and would come here often as it is quite nearby to my house.", "author": "Foram C."}

Happy hour is every day form 5-7, and has tons of food and drink specials. Service was great - our server was super helpful as we asked lots of questions. He also was all for the happy hour specials, not luring ya to choose the more expensive wines and allowing us to taste before selecting. \n\nOn the happy hour specials I recommend: garlic edamame, Arctic char roll, albacore tuna roll. The fried tofu was just as expected  - aka totally fine if that's what you're in the mood for but nothing particularly special. But hey, $4... We also got the striped bass and katsuo tuna sashimi pieces. The bass was delicious but the tuna was disgusting... stay away. \n\nOff the happy hour menu we had the seaweed salad (standard, delicious) and the extinguisher roll (amazing, but spicy!). The roll also comes with a flaming mound of salt which is fun.", "author": "Samara C."}

Another friend joined shortly after, so we asked for a table for three.\n\n*agedashi: fried tofu served with spicy daikon, scallions, fresh ginger, shredded nori, mushroom ponzu ($8)\n*brussels sprouts: sea salt, garlic oil, wasabi miso & spicy agave glaze ($9)\n*pork gyoza: crispy ground pork and vegetable dumplings, served with garlic shoyu ($9)\n*karaage: marinated chicken, breaded and fried in the traditional Japanese style ($9)\n*shiro maguro toro: pole-caught wild albacore belly, N Pacific ($15 sashimi)\n*kampachi toro: farmed amberjack belly, Hawaii ($18 sashimi)\n*uni: wild diver-caught urchin, CA ($14 nigiri) x2\n*shishito pepper: grilled shishito pepper with Hawaiian sea salt and shredded red pepper ($8)\n*pork belly: slow cooked pork belly, bourbon miso glaze ($12)\n*kikusui junmai ginjo: light & dry, aroma of fresh cantaloupe ($56 bottle)\n*kikusui nigori: dry & intense, white flowers & steamed rice ($18)\n*cabernet sauvignon: 2014 louis martini, sonoma, california ($14 glass) x2\n\nWe all just called out a few apps we wanted and I picked the sushi. I adore uni, so I had to get an order. It was nice and creamy. The two toros were good, though I'm a fan of otoro, so I like my fish fatty. I like it to melt in my mouth. The shishitos were blistered nicely, the karaage crunchy, and the gyoza fulfilled my dumpling craving. The agedashi was plated nicely. Though they had the sauce on the side. Helped keep the tofu crispy, but the flavor didn't seep into the pieces. I wasn't a huge fan of the brussels as I thought the sauce didn't have enough contrast. It was just kinda savory and a touch sweet. Maybe some citrus would have helped? Our drinks were fine. We enjoyed our sake and wine.\n\nOur server was sweet. He was attentive even though I could tell he was busy. We ordered in rounds: drinks, some food, some more food, and then some more drinks, so I know he had a lot on his plate. Plus we were here past closing and they didn't rush us. Much appreciated.\n\nCute sushi spot for the neighborhood.

Take a look at their regular menu to compare prices and see what you can get that's the biggest bang for your buck.\n\nWe got the cruchy spicy tuna, albacore and avo, katsuo nigiri (tuna), and Nasu Agebetashi, which is an eggplant dish that is filled with yummy umami flavor. Followed this all with a margarita, sangria and hot sake, as well as their specialty Tataki roll. Lots of good specialty rolls on the menu, it was super hard picking only one.\n\nWe loved our nigiri and Tataki roll for the freshness of fish. I had never had seared fish on a sushi roll, but it added a nice level of warmth that I thoroughly enjoyed. Their HH rolls are basic but good, and I would suggest trying 2 of them and then getting one of their regular rolls as well.\n\nHH is a busy time, especially for drinks. We got all of our food relatively quickly but our drinks didn't come until some time afterward. The bartender personally delivered them and mentioned that he was quite busy. Our waitress seemed a little frazzled as well, but still took the time to describe all of the nigiri to us. \n\nPro tip: if you're wondering what artic char is like we were, she described it as tasting and looking like salmon, but not salmon.", "author": "Allie L."}

The BF and I came in on a weekday around 6:30 pm and we were seated within a few minutes. We ordered some small plates and 3 specialty rolls to share, which was way more food than the two of us needed. \n\nAgedashi tofu -- 5/5\nReally good. I especially enjoyed the different globs of crushed daikon, spicy daikon, and ginger that came with the dish. \n\nKampachi tataki -- 4.5/5\nThe taste was a 5. Even though there was jalapeno on top, it somehow didn't overpower the dish whatsoever, instead adding a pleasant background heat (it wasn't too spicy whatsoever). Loved the sauce too. I'm docking half a star for the less polished presentation. The avocado was cut in irregular chunks and overall the dish looked pretty plain compared to everything else we got.\n\nGolden State roll -- 5/5\nThe contrast of the sweet/tart apple and savory fish was so good. I always try to get a specialty roll with fresher, more citrus-y flavors and this fit the bill perfectly.\n\nRatatouille roll -- 5/5\nDelicious vegetarian option. The fried eggplant was super crispy and definitely didn't taste \"healthy\" lol.\n\nTataki roll -- 5/5\nMy favorite roll of the night! It was beautiful to look at, with a rainbow of tobiko on top.

Hello, Pac Heights!\n\nI don't like the high prices and I constantly whine forking over $24 for 8 pieces of sashimi, but I'm a glutton for punishment and at the end of every meal at Tataki, I actually don't mind emptying my wallet here. It is worth it.\n\nTataki prides itself on providing its patrons with sustainable seafood. They closely follow Monterey Aquarium's seafood watch list. The reason being is to educate the public to refrain from consuming fishes that have been overfished or species that are in danger of being put on the endanger list. So, don't go looking for yellowfin tuna here nor the ever popular unagi. DO get to know your substitutes and feel better that you're helping the ocean replenish life. I've gone to love Arctic char (rich orange color similar to salmon and has soft texture), pole caught Albacore and Mackerel Pike. Whichever choice you make, you'll be sure to have fresh sashimi this side of town.\n\nIf you're not up for raw fish, appetizers such as the nasu agebitashi (grilled eggplant), seaweed salad or garlic edamame will whet your appetite. And thanks to foggy SF weather, you can always opt for their hot piping bowl of Tataki ramen ($16). With bouncy thin noodles, some Chasu, menma, nori and an egg, you're in it for a full meal. The complex broth is made up of pork, chicken and veggies simmered overnight, my only complaint is, they are really stingy with the broth. I always need MORE broth!\n\nSince dinner here is always a spendy one (even for just a neighborhood resto), I usually take advantage of HH from Sunday - Thursday, 5 - 630pm. While only a few rolls are on the menu, this is such a steal that I'm a happy camper. Don't forget that $5 Kin-sangria for happy hour! it's a delicate blend of beer, sake and wine to create the perfect pairing for their light tasting dishes. \n\nI feel good supporting this sushi place and for what they stand for. It's my little way of giving back for the ocean's bounty that I enjoy whenever I'm in the neighborhood.", "author": "Janice C."}

The Spicy Tuna Roll is mushy and you can barely discern the tuna from the 'spicy mix'. Additionally, I usually like to order Salmon Nigiri and they don't list Salmon on their nigiri menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-23", "description": "My friend and I were craving sushi for dinner, and decided to try Tataki. It's located in the lovely Pac Heights neighborhood. We didn't drive there, but it's located pretty close to the residential area neighboring Pac Heights, so I imagine one would be able to find parking if they ventured a few blocks away from the busy streets. It's also located a few blocks away from Salt&Straw if you're looking for a dessert place afterwards :) The interior of Tataki is lovely and has such a nice ambiance. There is a separate bar seating in one area, and on the other side is the sushi bar. And of course there is plenty of table seating. We tried to make reservations the night before, but Tataki does not take reservations on Friday and Saturday. Thankfully, we came at a good time (6:30ish) and were seated immediately. \n\nWe ended up ordering 3 rolls for the 2 of us and ate it all :P We ordered the extinguisher, which came with a fun small flame in the beginning. It was a tad spicy with the spicy albacore and spicy aioli, but it was still delicious :) The second roll was the tataki. It had a mix of seared fish with a sweet citrus shoyu sauce. The sauce combined well with the sauce, and I liked the variety of fish on it. I would definitely recommend both rolls! Our third roll, golden state, wasn't the best choice. The spicy scallop sounded enticing, but the scallop was tiny, and the roll was a little too saturated in sauce. If we could do a retake, I would probably want to try the kingfisher, which has their seasonal variety of fish. \n\nService was okay. It was a pretty busy restaurant, so I understand service can be a bit slower. Often times, we had to wave down our server since she didn't drop by often. But when she did see us waving her down, she was quick to come and help us with whatever we needed. Pricing is a bit more on the pricey side for rolls (ranged from $15-17), but I suppose that's the going rate in San Francisco.

The presentation for everything was beautiful but the quality and taste wasn't up to par.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-17", "description": "If you are ever craving good sushi in San Francisco, you should count your blessings because this city is a gold mine for amazing rolls and fresh raw fish. Whether you are looking for quick and affordable bites (woot Sushiritto), a full course experience (Tekka), or even something in between (omfg Ebisu), SF is dynamite... or should I say dynamite roll?! \n\nAnd the most recent place I've fallen in love with is Tataki. \n\nTataki is a little sushi bar tucked in the peaceful neighborhood that is SF's Lower Pacific Heights (used to be in other locations like Glen Park). A few weeks ago, my friends and I were looking for a very quick sushi bite in the city. Usually, dinners (even early ones) take forever in San Francisco. And sushi is out of the question if you want to be out in under an hour. But luckily, we struck a gem with Tataki because we got seated immediately and left in under 45 minutes. \n\nHow?? Porque?? Tai sao??? The beauty about Tataki is its location. Unlike most sushi restaurants in the city that are situated in overly popular neighborhoods (such as Akiko's in Union Square), Tataki was NEVER too crowded during the two times that I came. I came with my girlfriend the second time around 7pm on a Sundate (yes Sundate) and though it was busy, we again got seated immediately. \n\nMore specifically, Tataki is located on California Street near the corner of Divisadero. You'd think parking would be bad, but there's usually plenty of parking throughout the day at Lower Pac Heights. It's because the area is more residential than anything else. Bless, maybe I'll move here instead of the busier Sunset/Mission. Both times we went, we found parking in less than 5 minutes. \n\nThe first thing you will notice when you walk into Tataki is that the ambiance is A+. The lighting is dim at night, seating is pretty spacious for couples, and there's CANDLELIGHT in the evening! Personally, I feel like the best times to go are either 1. at night when you are on a date or 2. before 6pm during Happy Hour because some of their rolls are discounted. \n\nOverall, service is super speedy at this restaurant and food comes out fast. In terms of their menu, they have a good number of combo plates, sushi rolls, sashimi/nigiri, as well as appetizers and drinks. AND THEY EVEN HAVE RAMEN~ differentfood for everyone! Speaking of which, let me point out the ones that I've ordered during my two visits. ...\n\n-Fire Extinguisher (10/10). Usually, sushi with fire is more of a gimmick than anything else - meaning that the sushi is overpriced and you're paying for the fire. Tataki's Fire Extinguisher is definitely not that. One bite of this sushi and I instantly went to heaven. The albacore on this sushi is so fresh and the spices on this roll and a perfect addition for anyone who loves spicy food. Omg I love the habanero masago and the spicy aioli sauce. The fire is an awesome thing to witness too. I definitely think it's worth $14. \n\n-Golden State (10/10). If you read the ingredients to me before I came to Tataki, I wouldn't have ordered this roll. I mean apple reduction, really? But seriously, this roll is BOMB! The apple adds an amazing to the spicy scallop and seared albacore. Again this is worth the price of $15\n\n-Green Flash (10/10). Green Flash is definitely an interesting roll to order. It's made up of fresh albacore (once again), crab meat, and some chips among other things. If you like some crisp in your sushi, this roll is worth getting. It's $14, definitely worth the price.\n\n-Karage (8/10). I wasn't expecting much for Karage since places can be a hit or miss, but I thought the one at Tataki wasn't bad! It was a bit too much on the breaking (needed more meat, but it was still delicious and I loved the two sauces they had (spicy Sriracha and a mayo one). This is definitely worth $8. \n\nOverall, even though the food was amazing at Tataki, I have to say the best part besides the atmosphere is their mission; this place prides itself on sustainability and I LOVE IT! I have to give Tataki an \"omg, id travel 2 hours for this.\" With great food, lots of variety, and awesome culture, I'd say Tataki is one of the better sushi restaurants in San Francisco.\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

After a long day of exploring San Francisco, I decided to move way from the central action of the city to Tataki. While it is more in a slow, calmer part of the city, this restaurant is worth visiting.\n\nWhere to begin! Let's see from the moment you walk in, you are greeted with a smile. The modern look of the restaurant prepares you for what you are able to receive - a modern twist on traditional sushi rolls that does not dare compromise the quality of flavors. With extremely fresh fish and a very knowledgable waitress, we were taken on a true culinary adventure.\n\nWe decided to get the sashimi platter and an assortment of rolls. In addition, we decided to do 2 sake flights (Yes, two!) The sashimi platter was beautifully presented and as beautifully as it was presented, it tasted even better. There was not a single piece of sashimi that we did not like or felt was less quality than the other. Each of rolls were artistically presented. And then to top it off with the sake, we were left in a day dream. I still dream about returning. My favorite part was the bill. I thought that this experience would come at a bank breaking price, but no it was quite affordable for what we purchased.\n\nSo leave the main sushi places of central San Francisco and come out towards Tataki! You will not regret it. I will be sure to upload pictures soon!", "author": "Tar R."}

It's great that places are taking care to make sure we can have good sushi for years to come. \n\nWe started with the garlic edamame which was great. Served hot with a lot of sauteed garlic. It paired nicely with a couple of cold Sapporo's on draft. \n\nNext was the Double Double roll, philadelphia roll and shrimp tempura roll. All were quite good. My friend always orders the philly roll, it's his favorite. After this we tried a couple different nigiri as well as the extinguisher roll. The extinguisher was good, but not really a must have. It made for a good picture. The star of the night was the amberjack nigiri. We ended up eating 3 orders of it because we liked it so much.

The first is their mission of sustainability. As someone who cares a whole lot about the environment, it's often tough to eat sushi when I know the problematic role that fish farming and over catching play in our environmental struggle. Yet all of the menu has been sustainably sourced, which is a major feat, and the prices don't even show it!\n\nThe second reason is because it's a great sushi place for the gluten free diner. The menu already indicates what is gluten free and what can be made gluten free, and there are plenty of options (definitely not most of the specialty rolls, which is a bummer, but alas). There is also gluten free soy sauce for the table which is always nice.\n\nAll this only matters because the food was awesome as well. We got the seaweed salad and the seaweed and cucumber salad, and while both were great, order the regular seaweed salad for a more traditional set with better flavor. We also ordered avocado rolls (super small), butternut squash miso soup which was AMAZING, and a variety of specialty roles that were all awesome. We got a variety plate of sashimi (chef's choice) and honestly felt like the rolls were far tastier. Also had a most delicious mint strawberry lemonade from the bar tender.", "author": "Tule H."}

The edamame came steaming hot and was definitely lived up to its garlic name. The smell was divine and the garlic taste was very present, but not overwhelming. The soy reduction definitely helped with that and also gave the pods a nice sweet undertone. As for the fried calamari, they were nothing to write home about. That said, I did like that they were not too heavily battered.\n\nFor our entrees, we opted to share three plates: hotate (scallop tataki), the tataki roll, and the arctic char/avocado roll. The hotate was definitely divine. The scallop was soft and picked up excellent flavor from the sliced lemon \"bed\" and brinier masago. The tataki roll was pretty good in my opinion, though I wasn't a fan of it being served drenched in the shoyu already. It definitely took away from the flavor of the fish. The arctic char roll did make up for this though as it was the only dish where you had that nice, buttery soft texture from fresh fish. \n\nEach dish was presented beautifully and made this meal intimate, yet modern and chic enough to be a nice place to catch up with friends.

But if no one in your party is picky, there is plenty or sushi that is tasty.  \nOur friends brought us here and like this place because of the sustainable fish.  That is a really great aspect of Tataki.  I ordered the Golden State and then, from the happy hour menu Hotate nigiri and garlic edamame.  I loved the quality of the fish.  Everything was super fresh.  The rolls weren't huge, but well balanced.  Nice sized nigiri.  Garlic edamame was a big hit.  We also got brussel  sprouts, but asked for them without pepper and they looked well seasoned, but needed salt.  My 9 year old is not a fan of sushi(doesn't like sushi rice because of the vinegar or most of the fish).  To make it even more fun, poor kid can eat wheat.  So her go-to dish at Japanese restaurants is grilled salmon (aka Salmon teriyaki without the sauce).  Well, they didn't have that here.  What?  No Salmon teriyaki at a Japanese restaurant?  So we tried the waitress's recommendation of a some sort of grilled fish from the small plates menu.  I thought it was tender and tasty, but my kid didn't like it.  To make matters worse, the veggies that came with it were soaked in some sort of vinegary sauce or marinade.  AND...the cherry on top...there was no plain rice in the entire restaurant.  I've eaten at many Japanese restaurants and never have come across one where there's no plain rice.   \nIf it was just me, I would totally go back for the sushi--especially the Golden State roll, but, next time I'll have to bring food for the kids or just leave them at home.", "author": "Zoya R."}

LIKE YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO GET YOUR ASS HERE RN. \n\nSo I've been on the hunt for a spot with the perfect balance of quality and value and I think Tataki is THE ONE. Okay, so it might not be the most authentic Japanese and more on the fusion side, but hear me out.. \n\n$22 for 9 pieces of chef's choice nigiri. SO RIDICULOUS. So it's not labeled as an \"omakase\" exactly, but I think it's pretty damn close to an omakase you would get at somewhere like Amami. 9 pieces of nigiri for $22! I repeat, $22. THAT'S SUCH A STEAL. \n\nAnother reason why I love Tataki: they only serve sustainable fish. You won't find your usual salmon, tuna or yellowtail here. That shit is hella basic AF anyway. Come to Tataki to step yo fish game up:\n\n1. Kodai (tai snapper)\n2. Kampachi (amberjack)\n3. Katsuo (skipjack tuna)\n4. Suzuki (striped bass) - BOMB, pulled a DJ Khaled and got anotha one\n5. Faux-nagi (black cod)\n6. Hotate (scallop)\n7. Saba (mackerel)\n8. Iwana (artic char) - BOMB BOMB, got another one of these. Imagine salmon but better\n9. Shiro maguro (albacore)\n\nAll of these are on the menu, so you could order them all individually by pairs if you wanted but why would you.. \n\nMy only gripe is that they are a bit heavy on the rice but whatever, I'll live. \n\nI am so, so, so happy I found you, Tataki.

This has been a regular spot for my girlfriend and I, but the service today was terrible!\n\n- The waiter got one of the items wrong. I ordered a Tataki ramen, but he brought out a Tataki sushi plate. We had to correct him and the ramen eventually came out.\n- When my girlfriend's sashimi came out, she asked the waitress for some ginger.  The ginger never arrived.\n- Finally, our order of Arctic Char was taking forever, so my girlfriend inquired about it with the waiter. The waiter then goes over to the table next to us and quietly says that they accidentally got a double order of Arctic Char. The waiter takes their plate back to the kitchen and comes back a few seconds later and gives us a plate of Arctic Char. Then he gives the other table their plate of Arctic Char back with a half dozen pieces missing. The waiter obviously had our order replated from the table next to us. We pointed this out to the waiter immediately and he did not seem to understand how disgusting this was. The original plate of Arctic Char was sitting on the other table for 5-10 minutes. I don't know if the other guests ate from that plate, but it doesn't really matter. We asked the waiter to take away our plate and cancel the order, which he did without any argument.\n\nI don't know how the waiter thought his actions were appropriate.  The waiter had no sense of health standards or customer service. Not only did the waiter try to pass off other people's sushi onto us, but he obviously inconvenienced the other table by taking away their plate of Arctic Char during their meal.", "author": "Mark K."}

Real bulbs, none of that fluorescent lighting carp.\n\nAnd there is a sushi bar on one side of the restaurant, & a bar bar on the other end. I think it was a full bar, but I'm not quite sure. There's lots of seating, even when it got busy, it seems to flow in a way where people weren't waiting for outrageous times.\n\nThese people really know what they're doing. The prices are a little high, a little.

There's no way that it's 4/5 stars with 1000+ reviews and could be this shitty with their customer service.\n\nMe and my friend came on a Monday night, as servers who work at sushi restaurants ourselves, we know when we taste bad fish. \n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the hotate tataki which was super sweet and tasted pretty good. We ordered the kingfisher roll next and maybe because the fish was drowned in yuzu sauce we didn't taste anything bad. We actually thought it was pretty tasty.\n\nWe wanted to try their chef choice 12 piece sashimi. It was so nice of them to give us an extra 3 pieces of fish for free. But now we know why it was free. It looked amazing at first but once we started picking at the fish, there were several pieces that had discoloration or it just looked off. Either way, me and my friend didn't want to knock anything till we tried it. First piece of fish we ate was the Tai snapper, it tasted rubbery and bland. We thought it was meh. She tried a piece of the tuna and said it didn't have any taste and tasted like it was too frozen. At that moment I should've known better than to try it myself. I chewed half of it and spat it back out. Tried a piece of the medai and did the same. Sorry but the sashimi platter was unappetizing and gross. \n\nA girl server came by and asked if we wanted a box for the sashimi since we left more than half the order untouched. I told her what we thought of the fish and she said ok, took the plate away and gave us the check with the sashimi platter still on the bill. I'm sorry what? I'm not asking for free fish because it's honestly whatever to us at this point we just wanted them to acknowledge that their fish that night was bad. I put my card down and once again I told her again that the fish was not good and I spat 2 pieces out and I honestly wouldn't want to pay for something that's giving me stomach pains already. She said oh ok I'll talk with the manager. She comes back and said oh we gave you 20% off the platter and that it's beyond her power.  Our original bill was $78 she comes back with the bill being $70. \n\nAt this point it's not about the fucking money... you as an establishment put out bad fish and expected your customers to pay for it. I'm sure the other stuff on the menu doesn't taste bad but man. I'm sooo disappointed with their customer service.\n\n\nUPDATE: my stomach is hurting so bad I knew the price for the fish was too good to be true. \n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THE SASHIMI.", "author": "Julie H."}

Although I'm no expert at fish, I would say I keep a fair amount of Japanese restaurants in rotation to at least know what's good and what's not. \n\nThe ambiance is great, spacious and modern but casual. All dishes including the Hotate tataki and the Kingfisher roll were good, until we got to the sashimi. We ordered the 12pc sashimi and they were kind enough to give us 3 extra pieces, priced at $34 which was unusually cheap for sashimi. They gave us tai, medai, shima aji, kuromaguro and some type of sake and none of them were good unfortunately. The sashimi was extremely lackluster, bland and lacked texture. I only had 3 pieces before tapping out.\n\nWe let our waitress know about their fish and she smiled and brought us the check with the item still on the bill. Maybe she didnt quite understand? We let her know once again that their fish was not fresh and she came back with 20% off of the sashimi. Our original bill was $78 and after the discount it was $70...

The crowd here is mostly upper middle class families/couples with young children. The noise level was tolerable for a date or general conversation. It took a few of minutes before a server acknowledged us but we were pretty much seated right away after that. She did deny our request to sit by the window, citing that it's for \"3 people\", even though we saw a couple sitting there on our way out. First strike. \n\nFood: we ordered several \"happy hour\" rolls, a tataki roll, and a tonkatsu ramen. The happy hour rolls were fine (5pcs if you order the cut option btw) and the tataki roll was good. The presentation was nice and it tasted very good. However, the ramen was where it all went downhill. While I know this place isn't exclusively a ramen restaurant, it was an insult to ramen. They claim to simmer the broth overnight.. but in what? Salt? It looks milky like tonkatsu ramen usually does but it did not have the rich flavor that it should. All I could taste was salt, and even the soft boiled egg was extremely salty. While I appreciate the effort in seasoning the egg unlike many ramen joints, it was a total miss. The only thing they did right was the presentation of the  chashu (seared nicely) and the fact that they used sturdy ramen noodles with just the right amount of chewiness. For $13 a bowl, this ramen isn't even worth it if you're desperate for ramen. \n\nService: returning to the service portion, it was standard. They asked if we wanted a refill on water at the end but not during the meal. The waiter introduced himself and seemed pretty professional.\n\nI would only return for the rolls, but even then there are literally dozens of restaurants just like this.", "author": "Diana S."}

Everything they serve is presented beautifully as well.\n\nThey were out of several of the wines on the menu, but we ordered a glass of Sauv Blanc each and the eggplant appetizer to start.

However, a couple times I've been here, service was a bit delayed to start off. Maybe I've just come to expect this, whether or not it is an actual industry standard, but I think the server should come over to a new table a few minutes at most after being seated, say hello, and serve glasses of water. Even acknowledgement to say they'll be right over is reasonable. \n\nTo the food, Arctic char roll and the spicy miso ramen are delicious. It's a bit pricey, but what place isn't in SF and in this neighborhood. I think the price matches the quality though. It's not the best ramen I've ever tasted, but it's decent.

They have happy hour every day till 7pm which is awesome because you can enjoy small plates before your meal :) I came here in a group of 4 around 5:30 pm on Sunday night and it wasn't too packed. It took us awhile to get our menus and it might be because there were only two servers but given the restaurant size.. service should have been better. We decided to get:\n\nFried Calamari: during happy hour its 5 dollars! and it was worth it because it tasted soooo good! The portion was decent.\n\nSweet Potato cut roll: One of my favorites! surprisingly sweet potato goes really well with rice (: \n\nArtic Char cut roll: Delicious, very reminiscent to a salmon.\n\nSpicy Tuna hand roll: LOVED THIS. The tuna tasted fresh and spicy.\n\nGolden State roll: This has to be one of the best tasting rolls ever. The crisp apple combined with the yuzu really produced an interesting and delicious taste. The roll was slightly sweet, citrusy, and savory at the same time. Definitely worth getting.\n\nExtinguisher roll: I thought this roll was okay. It tasted good but it wasn't anything special. I thought the fire would actually cook the roll but it didn't, it was more for display.\n\nKurodai (tataki): I never had farm sea bream before but it was tasty! I think it would be a shame if you came here without ordering a tataki plate because it was unique and they really presented the fish well plus it was easily my group's favorite dish of the night.\n\nSangria: very fruity :) I loved how they put a lot of fruits in the drink, and the lychee added a nice touch to the drink.\n\nAll the food was great, slightly on the pricier end. I'm used to bigger portions for the same price I guess. The one thing that sort of annoyed me was the slow service. They were great with getting the food out on the table until the last roll. I saw our last roll just sit at the sushi bar for 10 minutes and it turned out that they forgot about it. Other than that, I enjoyed dining here.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

Great for pictures, but otherwise would not get again.\n\nGolden state roll (scallops, avocado, apple, yuzu, tuna) was fantastic.  Fish was fresh and the slight tang from the apple and yuzu was so yum.\n\nUni was fresh and good.\n\nHappy hour rolls were $4.5 for 5 pieces, and had relatively generous portions of fish.

The eggplant is cold and cut into nigiri-sized pieces. The first time I ordered it I thought it was fish because of the way it's prepared. The flavor is really special and unique - the combo of mirin, shoyu (like soy sauce) and ginger is slightly sweet and goes with the eggplant sooo well. I took my sister here and she said next time she comes to SF she may get this dish for every meal.\n \nOther go-to items:\n\n- Katsuo Tataki: Fresh skipjack tuna with just enough mustard and onion to bring out the flavor of the fish\n- Arctic Char and Avocado Roll: simple with really high-quality ingredients\n- Spinach Gomae: 4 pieces each served on a soup spoon, each bite is a tiny sesame orgasm in my mouth\n- Gindara Misoyaki: Flakey grilled sablefish in a delicious miso sauce \n\nThe one time I tried the sashimi salad, I thought the fish was not up to the standard of the other fish dishes I'd tried. I wrote it off as a one-off as everything else I've tried here, on multiple occasions, is very fresh.\n\nMy boyfriend sometimes orders the ramen, which has a really special smokey broth and is a great cheaper option.", "author": "Camille E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-11-24", "description": "Socal-quality sushi, with SF-quality creativity. \n\n[BACKGROUND]\n\nYelp discovered by a friend, who suggested it for a catch-up dinner.  It's a nice place especially for special occasions (including celebrating Fridays).\n\n[NICE AMBIANCE... AND LOTS OF TIME TO ADMIRE IT]\n\nNaturey theme, with very nice wooden tables, a bamboo wall divider, and little pendant lamps.  It's an extremely small restaurant, so on the one hand it's cozy and feels Japanese but on the other hand the wait takes FOREVER.  Even a party of four is considered large because they have so few tables.  They don't take reservations either, so plan your timing very strategically.\n\nThe rolls also take quite awhile, and there is a long lag in between each roll.  I'm surprised, because sushi chefs usually whip stuff up pretty quickly.  \n\n[FOOD AND DRANKS]\n\nEverything about the rolls is stellar, except that the portions seem very small in terms of number of pieces and also the size of each piece.  5 rolls for 4 girls and still hungry afterwards.  \n\n(+++) Extinguisher, $13 (albacore tuna, avocado, habanero masago, spicy aioli): Tip: get your camera ready!  You will get trigger-happy because this roll is served with fire on the side.  You'll be wanting to snap multiple photos because you get different flame patterns.  Also, since it's on a long plate, try to get an angle near the end of the plate to include all the sushi pieces.  Oh wait, this is Yelp, not a photo forum--back to food.  It's an interesting mix of rich foods (sashimi, avocado, sauces) and a complex spiciness.  \n\n(+++) Tataki, $13 (5 varieties of seared fish, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, sweet sauce): Probably the most traditional of the specialty rolls because it doesn't have much sauce.  Good for people who enjoy sashimi and don't want it adulterated with gimmicks.\n\n(-) Early Bird, $13 (asparagus, avocado roll topped with seared filet mignon and pineapple): This is quite popular but I personally didn't like it too much.  The sushi rice and filet mignon synergistically devalue each other.  The avocado addition just makes it even more mushy and bland.\n\n(++) Green Dragon, $15 (shrimp tempura roll, faux-nagi, avocado, wasabi tobiko):  I have no idea what faux-nagi is, but it seemed exactly like unagi to me.  This is a tasty roll, especially for anyone afraid to eat raw sashimi.\n\n(+++) Pacific Sunrise, $12 (cucumber wrap with 4 varieties of fish, garlic ponzu sauce, no rice): Perhaps my favorite.  Being riceless with only a thin cucumber wrap, the sushi predominates and goes very well with the lemony ponzu sauce.  The julienne daikon garnish adds a nice crunch.\n\n(+/-) House sangria: very fruity blend of lychee, grapefruit, and berries. This is + or - depending on your preference for fruity vs strong drinks.  I personally prefer the latter kekeke\n\nFor 2 drinks per person plus sharing this, it came out to $40 per person.  o.o  I guess this is the standard for classy food in SF, but in the rest of the Bay Area it would be around $20-30 for this level.\n\nConclusion: Delicious and caters to a wide variety of tastes, but be sure to bring a small appetite, a lot of money, and patience.", "author": "Edna C."}

It's a pretty small place inside but thankfully we were able to be seated without having to wait too long!  One thing that is nice is their happy hour menu that goes until 7pm.  We got the spicy tuna roll and arctic char & avocado roll ($4.50 each for a 5 piece roll) and the $5 fried calamari.  Both rolls were pretty good and we enjoyed our calamari as well.  I found it interesting that they try to use sustainable fish, so this might be a good place if you're into that kind of thing.  The arctic char is similar to salmon and is more sustainable fishing, that's why they use it.\n\nWe also got a rainbow roll ($13), which is a standard of sorts that I use to judge sushi spots, and the tataki roll (same price), which has seared fish on top of a cucumber/avocado roll.  We enjoyed both of our rolls.  The rainbow roll had pretty decent sized slices of fish on the top which were fresh, and the CA roll filling was very tasty as well.  The tataki roll was tasty also and looked really nice with the different color tobiko they used to top it!  \n\nThe only real complaint I had about the food was the water we were served.  Each glass had a slice of cucumber in it- kind of like \"spa water\" but the taste was a little funky for me so my wife and I didn't take more than a couple sips.

We all ordered a couple of things. My mom received both dishes. I received both. My boyfriend received one. My sister nothing. After that food was delivered THEN the waitress practically threw his hot tea on the table in front of him and ran away. I couldn't believe it didn't burn my mom or boyfriend. Eventually my sister finally received her dish. I saw the bartender whisper something to the waitress when she had a horrified expression on her face. We had just finished our entire meal and my boyfriend STILL hadn't received his ramen. She came over to explain we were out. How are you out of ramen on a Saturday at 7. And how did we not know about it until the end of our meal. We left her a little tip but jeez- if I return any time soon I had better be wowed. I'm so disappointed.

I heard that it was a great spot for delicious fresh sushi that was farmed with sustainable farming practices. It sounded like a dream come true. The only problem is if you arrive past 7pm or so to the 15-20 seat restaurant expect to wait! The restaurant is quite small, part of the charm so plan ahead and go early, or grab a drink next door at Wild Hare while you're waiting. Another option is to call ahead and carry out.  This is what I do most of the time and I love it. You'll see below my experiences dining in and carryout out Tataki! Check it out I,  promise you'll enjoy it!! 2815 California St. San Francisco, CA. 415-931-1182.\n\nP.S. A tip I'm going to share with you is that Tataki Sushi Bar has a fabulous happy hour menu served until 7pm (note it's dine in ONLY). Menu includes the below.\n\nHappy Hour Roll Menu $3.00 - $4.50: Crunchy California Roll, Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll, Arctic Char/Avocado Roll, Sweet Potato Tempura Roll & Mixed Vegetable Roll . Happy Hour Drinks Menu $2.50 - $5.00: Select Beers & Sangria\n\nThanks for checking out my post I hope you enjoy dining with The JetSetting Fashionista. Emily", "author": "JetSettingFashionista J."}

I ordered the udon soup because the couple next to us was eating it, and it looked so delicious!\n\nSo for the sushi combo lunch, we ordered 1 roll and it came with 4 pieces of chef's choice nigiri. We ordered the arctic char/avocado roll, which was very good! Overall, the fish was delicious and fresh! I like the sashimi at this restaurant. This also came with either a mixed salad or miso soup. We got the salad. The vegetables were crispy and I like the sesame dressing on top. The salad was amazing.\n\nI think the udon soup was a little bland but I like the texture of the noodles, and all the vegetables in it. We asked for red pepper and they gave it to us, which made it taste a lot better.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and was able to split the lunch special between us since we were sharing everything. The waitress was a little out of it though, I felt like she didn't pay a lot of attention to the customers. She was nice, and responded if you needed anything, but she didn't really follow up on us. \n\nNotes:\nYou can pay with card here but remember $15 minimum.\nIt's a very small location.

Not that it taste bad. It's just eh...\n\nThe desserts are such disappointments. I have sweet tooth and I almost always enjoy anything sugary but the green tea and chocolate mousse? It's worse than a disappointment. Bf concurred although he likes something on the milder side. Something is missing. The green tea mousse was too bland. The chocolate on the other hand was too rich. Other than the original flavor of chocolate and green tea, something is missing and lacking. I need more complexity.\n\nFor the food, we got extinguisher, the pork belly appetizer and artic char roll.\n\nThe portions were so tiny, I almost cried. This coming from someone who doesn't eat that much. And funny thing, bf who generally eats less than me, agreed that the portions are too small and hence, ordering 2 desserts instead of sharing as usual.\n\nExtinguisher is cool. They lit the salt on the plate. I'm guessing you dipped the extinguisher on this? Tried it and think it's better without. The sauce is nice if you like the typical Americanized/fusion sushi. But I still think something is missing.\n\nArctic char is also a decent roll. Again, very tiny portion.\n\nPork belly can use more bold flavors and not too chewy. It's okay. But I ate better pork bellies in the past month so this is pale in comparison to other Japanese restaurants that I tried. The bun was too sweet and too thick, overpowering the pork belly.\n\nAs said, the place is kinda hip (but what's with the lights that seem flickering when I first went in) and if you like to drink and socialize, this is probably fun. Sustainable fish... For you hipsters out there ;) cool menu design for the graphic designers... A deep pocket for you trust fund babies...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-29", "description": "I had yet to find a go-to sushi spot in San Francisco...then I stumbled upon Tataki. And now I do! Holy moly. \n\nOne of the first appealing things to notice about Tataki is their use of sustainable seafood. Yes, there is something to be said about wild, ocean-grown fish. But if it can be sustainable and still taste amazing than why not! I have seen other reviewers mention that the fish is bland and that's why Tataki has sauce (lots of hot sauce) on pretty much every dish, but personally I prefer more sauce and thought that the fish had great flavor. I guess it's just personal preference. \n\nI came in around 6 on a Saturday night and, as expected, there was already a wait. This place is very small and intimate and there are not many tables/seats. However we only waited about 15-20 minutes before being offered a seat at the counter - a chance to watch the sushi chefs in action! I'll take it. Definitely not a place to bring a large group however. \n\nWe ordered the crab croquettes to start, which were made with sweet potatoes and veggies. They mostly tasted like sweet potatoes to me, not much crab flavor, and had some sort of spicy barbecue sauce drizzled on top. I love sweet potatoes, so they were pretty damn good in my opinion and my sister loved them as well. I almost wish they had another type of sauce on them though, as the barbecue was a bit overpowering. \n\nWe also ordered the early bird roll and the extinguisher roll. This is where it went from good to great. The early bird roll is very different than anything I've seen at a sushi restaurant. Inside the rice is asparagus, avocado, and pineapple and on top is seared filet mignon. The combination of flavors was beyond amazing. You couldn't really taste each individual ingredient, which I thought was actually great because the flavors mixed so well. Very non-tradition sushi (no fish!), but it was definitely my favorite thing that I tried. The extinguisher roll was also excellent. It was made with albacore tuna, avocado, habanero masago, and spicy aioli. It also came with fire on the plate! Literally fire. It was perfectly spicy and again, the combination of flavors was just delicious. A+ on food and presentation. \n\nThe service was quick, helpful, and friendly. One of the benefits to being a restaurants with limited seating. Our water came with cucumber...a great touch and perfect for refreshing your burning mouth after the spicy sushi. They also were very good about keeping our drinks (Chardonnay) refilled at our desire. \n\nLooking at the menu you can tell that Tataki had limited ingredients..but what they do they do really, really well. All of the menu items here looked amazing and I will be back to try more!", "author": "Emma B."}

I thought the decor was nice, the cocktail I ordered (a soju sangria ) was great. The service we had was also wonderful. The main problem was the food. We first got the salmon special which came out as a mediocre roll instead of the sashimi we were looking for, which was a miscommunication.  The waitress apologized and offered to switch it but we were hungry so just ate it and got the tuna skipjack sashimi instead. It was fishy and awful. We ordered the squid which came out deep fried although the menu description made it sound grilled. The tataki was good , although pretty expensive.

The sweet potato tempura was wrapped in rice and nori, topped off with a dark sauce.   A rich and warm delight.  \n\nAnother plus is  Arctic char and avocado roll.  Arctic char is similar to salmon, without the slum conditions that normal farmed salmon endure.  \n\nDessert was a highlight.  We ordered the kinako mochi.  Imagine a S'mores, Japanese style.  Doubly yummy.  \n \n\nCons:  I always try rolls wrapped in cucumber, but I found the Pacific Sunrise lacking in taste and texture.  It's also stuffed with tuna along with other fish.   I'm not a fan of tuna, and I found Albacore less tasty than Bluefin tuna.  The other fish rolls weren't thrilling either.  \n\nLastly,  I loved the casual, not-snooty environment.

The fish was so fresh that it melted right in your mouth. Although we got the biggest plate of sashimi it was so good it left us wanting more.

Had a craving for both Sake and Ratatouille Roll. Now, just so you understand, on New Years we ate like 5 Ratatouille Rolls (between 8 of us) with other stuff too. Two of us even ordered one more for dessert, that's how killer this roll was with the crunchy eggplant tempura inside and topped with this orgasmic sauce, and toasted garlic. Holy @hit. So good.   \n\nOk, now fast forward to tonight. Not sure what happened. Maybe a different sushi chef, but was not up to standard. Inside tempura was soft, not crunchy, the sauce didn't have the pizzaz, and there wasn't enough of it, and the roll itself seemed to be smaller than is was the last few times we were there. We also had the Purple Rain which has killer flavor normally, but seemed to also be lacking the zest and the impactful flavor it had before. Maybe it was missing the dots of sauce on the top???

We waited, and waited and finally after about 30 minutes of sitting there got our server's attention and asked for the status of our food and were told it would be right out. Another 15 minutes later we asked again for anything, even our edamame and were again told it would be out soon. Finally after an hour of sitting there our rolls arrived, and 15 minutes after that we were finally presented with our edamame (were they hand picking it out back? What took so long?!).\n\nBecause the food was THAT GOOD, I decided to get take out a few weeks later. I went in to place and was told it would be 1.5 hours before my food would be ready, so I left empty handed.\n\nToday I decided to give them one final try. We sat, ordered and everything seemed promising as people around us were getting their food. We got our edamame right away (yay!) but about 35 minutes in our server came and asked is to \"remind him of what our order was.\" I figured he must have messed something up and didn't put the order in, but about 10 minutes later all of our food except our gyoza appetizer came out.

Well, the curiosity killed the cat.\n\nThe truth is, it is nothing memorable. Non-Japanese chefs = non authentic.\nSome of the fish was too watery, it's because of how they thaw frozen fish in a wrong way. Also the rice was mushy. If you wanna make good sushi, you have to nail it on rice.\n\nWe had some 2 tataki and 4 kinds of sushi, and 1 roll. The choice of rolls was disappointing. Almost all of them were \"spicy\", which means they are not using fresh fish, therefore you have to hide it with spice. \n\nAji was the best thing out of all. Katsuo and Amberjack were nothing special. Scallop tataki was not bad. White albacore, which is normally hard to mess up, was so watery, I honestly have never had anything like that before.\n\nThe best thing in this place was probably the macha cheesecake. Definitely not the fish.\n\nI do give the 3rd star for having somewhat rare fish on the sushi menu, like arctic Char. That's about it.\n\nVery mediocre and a little disappointing.", "author": "Cartman P."}

In regards to the specialty rolls, we really liked the extinguisher (it is on fire! so its a kodak moment) and the spicy albacore is really good. The pacific sunrise was also good, if you are into mixing sashimi flavors. We also grabbed the sashimi platter, and Tataki's sashimi was fresh as can be and didn't taste like it was in a freezer for a few years before served, so we were very happy with the platter.

But once we were actually seated, the service was quick and the food came quickly too.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered a plate of croquettes (comes with 4), miso soup, the nigiri sampler, the Tataki roll, the 49er roll, the Mix-it-Up roll, and a Philadelphia roll.  Without a doubt, this was way too much food, which I learned about 2 rolls in.  \n\nI enjoyed each roll, except the Philadelphia.  There was nothing wrong with that roll, I just personally don't love cream cheese and smoked salmon in my sushi, so that's my own fault.  All the other rolls were superb, especially the 49er roll, which has a thinly sliced piece of lemon on top of artic char, with some avocado, cucumbers, and other stuff in the filling.  I felt like all the rolls were thoughtfully made, both in concept as well as in execution.  Quality!  The crab croquettes were delicious too, but I mean, how can you mess up breaded, deep-fried sweet potatoes, right?  Note: they give you 4 sizable croquettes in an order, and I think that's what did me in.  If you plan to eat a lot of rolls, you might want to skip the croquettes, as all those potatoes will surely stuff you up way too quickly.  A mistake I learned as soon as the second roll came.  Oy.\n\nPrice-wise, it's a bit pricier, at about $12-13 for the specialty rolls, and $5-7 for simpler things like California or tuna rolls.  \n\nOverall, delicious, healthy-tasting, and beautiful!", "author": "Vivian C."}

Tataki has been on my radar for at least a year now, as it boasts a more creative veg menu than simply shitake maki and spinach-avocado rolls.  Given its small size (and long waits), the inconvenience of parking, and the frustration with traffic during prime-time hours, I haven't been able to find a good time until now.\n\nI ordered a Mixed Green Salad, a Spicy Tofuna Roll (a vegetarian version of the spicy tuna roll), a Ratatouille roll, and the Hot Potato Roll.  \n\nMy review is mixed.  The salad was nothing special, and the ginger dressing was so sparse that, amazingly, I found the salad dry.  I wouldn't order again (although I liked the addition of cashews).  The Spicy Tofuna Roll, too, was a bona fide miss.  Skip it.  It was terrible.  There was nothing spicy about it; there was nothing remotely tuna-esque about it either.  It's a total pass and borderline larceny at $7.50.  My favorite, by far, was the Ratatouille Roll.  A little on the sweet side but delicious.  I'd order it again.  The Hot Potato Roll, too, was good, but it got boring after a few pieces.  \n\nService was rude.  The female server started to clear the plates from me while I was still eating (and chewing).  While I arrived and ate within a half hour of closing time, there were two other tables still in the restaurant when I left, and it wasn't as if everyone was waiting for me to leave.  This left me with a bad taste.  It was terrible, terrible form.\n\nI sat at the sushi bar.  While it appears that Tataki has a commitment to sustainable fishing (even though there really is no such thing on any commercial level) -- and they have the Monterrey Bay Aquarium Fish Watch cards for people to consult and take with them -- the fish didn't appear super fresh in my opinion.  I don't eat fish, so this was immaterial to me and what I ordered.\n\nI'd eat the Ratatouille Roll again.  I may try the Reggae Roll should I ever go back (which is unlikely), as it was the only other specialty roll offered that I didn't order.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about either.  My three 3-star rating is generous.  It's really 2.5 stars.\n\nMeh.  I can't recommend, but I understand its appeal.

Offering takeout instantly knocks you down from potential Ino and Okoze status, to sushi rock.  You ruin the experience of people in the restaurant when you have brown bags flying out of the restaurant.  Sushi is an interactive experience, meant to be enjoyed through conversation with the chef and other patrons.  If you want takeout, go get Chinese or Thai food.\n\nI get that this place is driven by its sustainable sushi mission and not necessarily about the quality of the fish, presentation, and dining experience.  However, I don't agree with the decision to sauce every piece of fish on the menu.  \n\nI ordered maguro, hamachi, Saba, and aji....and every single piece had sauce on it.  When I see sauce, I think of interior quality fish - hence the need to mask the true flavor of the fish (or you are a sick person who eat sushi but don't like the taste of fish).  Ordering the extinguisher and spicy tuna roll was a mistake.  They sauce was so overpowering, I could have eaten cat food and not even noticed the difference.  The chard is just an exotic name for salmon.  What was even more foolish and disappointing was the calamari, which arrived after the nigiri and rolls.  Mind you, this was on a Thursday night and not on a random Tuesday or Sunday night.  Also wanted to note that our bill came out to $70 with a tip.\n\nThere was a zagat sign that said \"sushi snob worthy.\"  I question zagat's ability to judge sushi restaurants.

Something about the rice at this place is amazing, and keeps me coming back.\n\nAs has been said before here - be aware of the no-reservations policy and the sometimes substantial wait-times for parties size 2+.

We were able to put our name in for a table for 6 and head next door to Wild Hare to grab a cocktail before sitting down for dinner (the wait was ~30 min, which was perfect!). I love the sustainable seafood initiative and know that the fish will always be super fresh and tender.  \n\nWe ordered the garlic edamame to start and wwoowwww the smell & texture of the added garlic crunch to the edamame is brilliant!  So good! I ordered the seaweed salad (on the smaller side for the price), the tuna tataki (at the recommendation of the waiter), and the shitake mushroom roll (you know for...vegetables..).  The tataki was great & melted in your mouth.  I also tried a piece of the fried sweet potato roll (forget the name) but that was really really yummy & a great choice for any vegetarians in the group!  I docked one star for the waiter being very...blah (literally the only way I can think of describing him) which is unfortunate but my past experiences had been wonderful in terms of the staff.  \n\nAll in all, great place for sushi & worth the wait!", "author": "Raina D."}

Miya's in New Haven has been doing the sustainable sushi thing well before 2009, and I asked them about this. Miya's answer was simply that they've been using sustainable seafood in their sushi for a while, but choose not to use the \"sustainable\" label. Respect. So, in reality - Tataki might have an unwilling contender to that claim. That said, I won't compare it to Miya's as they are very different in execution. Tataki is certainly more traditional. \n\nThe rolls we shared were excellent and very flavorful. Nothing terribly unexpected, but everything seemed well-balanced and flavorful. \n\nThe sashimi was good, though not great. It could have been more fresh. I've become a stickler for sashimi/sushi at every sushi restaurant I go to, and I've learned to appreciate what truly \"fresh\" means. This wasn't quite there. \n\nService was so-so. Friendly enough, but not super attentive and our tea and water remained empty for quite some time until we finally asked to have them refilled. On the plus side, I didn't hate eating sushi accompanied by a full Tame Impala album. \n\nAll in all, this would normally have been a 3 star review for me - but it gets an extra star for sustainability efforts.", "author": "Robert K."}

This is more of a place for couples who have greens to fork out. \n\nTataki has 2 other locations; Tataki South (Noe Valley) and Tataki Canyon (Glen Park). This one happens to be the main location. Personally, I feel that Tataki South had better vibes than this place. \n\nATMOSPHERE N F O O D: \nThis location was dimly lit, service was MEH, and the food well...the rolls fell apart really quickly. The main spectacle here are the \"tataki\" items which is pretty much lightly seared sashimi grade fish in a pool of sauce. Yes, you read that right. \nA P O O L of sauce. For someone such as myself who has been eating fish almost all my life, I could really tell if the slice of fish was fresh or not. The Kurodai (sea bream) was definitely not fresh because there was this fishy aftertaste to it that bombed out the sauce too. UGH. \n\nThe Tataki roll at least wasn't as disappointing in terms of freshness. However, when I picked up a piece with my pro Asian chopstick skills, it fell apart as if it were a cake crumble.

There is no space to wait inside so bring a coat.\n\nI ordered an Asahi beer and the mix-it-up roll which was good. The sushi had a nice spice kick to it and the fish tasted fresh. I would definitely order it again. The pieces were fairly large and there were 8 of them. My friend ordered the avocado roll, sweet potato roll, and a miso soup. \n\nOur food was brought out as it was ready. So she got her miso and avocado roll first. A few minutes went by and I got my roll. Then a while went by and asked our waiter about the sweet potato roll. Apparently it takes longer because it's a tempura. But we were basically done by the time that came out. So I would say SHARE. That way no one is left waiting for their food.\n\nWhen our bill came out, they had forgotten to include our drinks which we pointed out.

I liked the Extinguisher much better than the Golden State, only because it had more pizazz in flavor. The Golden State was good, but there was no \"Wow\" in it for me. The Extinguisher came with siracha sauce on the side and I dipped my roll in it (it didn't need it) but I LOOVE being hot. For those who love presentation, the Extinguisher roll was served to us with flames on the platter. I was easily amused.\n\nWe also ordered a Philly roll, which had salmon, cream cheese and cucumber (?). That was good, but I wasn't really in the mood for cheese. Our calamari was delicious and not too battered.\n\nOur salads, one was the Ocean salad, the other was the Seaweed salad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-10-16", "description": "Deciding to try Tataki after being tasked with the responsibility of finding a place for dinner, our grouped headed up the street from Utoepia, not expecting the hour wait that lay ahead. The two Asians in the group were getting fairly hangry towards the end, with myself convinced that the food would not be worth the wait (those who know me know that I usually will only wait up to 20 minutes for food).\n\nFinally being seated, we decide on getting the garlic edamame, poke, scallop tataki, extinguisher and golden gate rolls, kin-sangria and a glass of umeshu, only realizing as we noticed the fauxnagi on the menu that Tataki focused on serving dishes using sustainable ingredients. The garlic edamame (garlic-y and vinegared), and the golden gate rolls were both excellent. The poke was served three ways (sweet, savory-sweet, and savory), with the savory-sweet style with the vinegared seaweed being tasty, but the other two presentations, the tataki, and the extinguisher roll (which is lit on fire when served) were good, but much less noteworthy. The kin-sangria also failed to impress, being, for the most part, underwhelming and bland.\n\nSo, while their food is not bad, and wait-aside, would warrant a 3.5 stars from me, the lack of reservations, coupled with long waits (the space is tiny and only has ~10 tables, with most being two-seaters), knocks them down to a flat 3 stars. Showing up earlier for dinner, especially on Mondays and Tuesdays, supposedly greatly increases the chances of being seated more quickly. Prices are, admittedly, a bit higher than usual, with our total bill after tip coming out to $100 (~$70 without alcohol) - we were, however, comfortably full at the end of our meal. Do note that they have a restriction of a two credit card max per table, so be sure to bring cash if you're splitting!", "author": "Johnny W."}

As well as a bar table in front of the sushi chef area. \n\nLunch menu: I came here for lunch and the menu is less than spectacular. It doesn't have many options and the chef apparently makes the choice for what sashimi or nigiri he/she wants to give you. My GF wanted to get maguro(tuna) but we couldn't choose just maguro specifically. (Most likely the chef chooses the sashimi that is getting old).\n\nWhat I got: I ordered the roll/nigiri lunch combo which is a total of 8 pieces of sushi. The nigiri wasn't the freshest and smelled pretty fishy to me. The California rolls were nicer than many other places but it's just California rolls...\n\nOverall this place is just alright, and I am still in search for the best sushi restaurant in SF.", "author": "Tj C."}

Small and intimate dining area with cool lighting that changes colors to make the dining experience even more fun.\n\nCreative rolls with tasty ingredients go really with the fresh fish. My favorite roll was the Russian Roulette. AA grade sushi with a shot of sake for the person who by chance picks one the potentially lethal aka spicy piece of the roll. Fun game to play while eating because it had us on the edge of our seats who would get the spicy piece + sake shot. I was secretly hoping it would be me (and it was) the entire time because I love spicy food.

The long wait and poor service overshadowed the food, and the food was average at best.\n\nMy friend and I ordered 3 rolls: 49er, Golden State, and Pacific Sunrise. Two of the rolls (Pacific Sunrise, 49er) were misses because of the lack of texture and flavor. The Golden State was fresh, but underwhelming. \n\nAside from the food, the overall experience of the restaurant was subpar. Guests are seated side by side with tables just inches apart, and most of the tables line the wall anyway, further closing off space. Our server was dismissive and unattentive from the beginning to end of our meal, and normally I wouldn't note customer service (since that can be a one-off experience) but it was disappointing for a restaurant of this recognition and caliber. Considering the prices and the hype, I expected much more.\n\nThere are not a large number of signature roll options here, so I'm disappointed that the 3 we selected were neither particularly creative nor tasty inventions.

Its a shame because the food here is excellent and it pains me that this awful experience might be enough for me to NEVER come back here again. \n\nI came here with my mom who was visiting from out of town and we were promptly seated. We ordered the Tataki Deluxe and two rolls. 5 minutes later, two other customers right next to us were seated and ordered a few rolls. I had the reasonable expectation that we would get our food since we came first. Not only did the customers next to us get their food before us, they were almost done with their food while we were still waiting. \n\nI don't think its unreasonable for me to expect our food to come before other customers who  come in after us, but the waiter was not upfront from the beginning on how long it would take for the Tataki Deluxe to work on. They could of served us the other two rolls before serving us the Tataki Deluxe so we could at least have something to much on. On top of us waiting hungrily for our food, the waiter did nothing to rectify the situation. He coldly told us \"well....you'll just have to wait...\" and walked off completely apathetic.\n\nMy mom and I left that night without ever getting our food. We ended up going to the another restaurant down the street.I felt completely bummed, since I wanted to show her the best of what my neighborhood had to offer. Its unfortunate, I come to this place to eat alot. Again, the food here is great and this is the first time I've had an issue with the service, but after tonight and the way I was treated by the waiter working there tonight, I don't feel like I could ever come back. \n\nI wrote this review in hopes that someone from Tataki actually reads this. Here are some pointers for the future:\n\n1) Make expectations clear from the beginning for your customers. Again, I don't mind waiting longer for food if it takes awhile to prep, I would of been completely fine with that if you had been upfront from the beginning.\n\n2) Attitude - At least try to be sympathetic towards your customers and attempt to rectify the situation.

The deal with Tataki is they are a sustainable sushi place, so some of your typical go to sushi choices might not appear on this menu. The flip side of that is you'll also stumble across some offerings you might not find on other sushi menus such as atlantic char and sea bream. I tried  the pacific sunrise, kurodai tataki, and the extinguisher (which comes out on fire!). Everything was very good, I was especially impressed by the extinguisher which was legitimately spicy. It was by far the spiciest sushi i've had at any sushi place and I really enjoyed it. All of my friends also mentioned that anything made to be spicy was not holding back. If I went back I think I'd hit up only spicy selections, they were that good!\n\nI'd also like to mention that they have one of the most extensive vegetarian menus of any sushi place I've been to.

The two groups that came after us were served before us and the waiter never came back to refill my water. The sushi was...interesting? We got the tataki roll, 49er roll, and the double double. The tataki roll was drenched in ponzu, which was not something I've ever seen before. The 49er roll was filled with masago instead of having it as a topping. I wish they stated that the masago would be the filling. The double double was cut in this diagonal shape making it hard to eat. Also, the double double was so spicy that it left an uncomfortable burning sensation that spread throughout my lungs and stomach. If you're into fusion sushi, then this is the place for you. But for me, coming from Japan and used to authentic and traditional Japanese sushi, this was not the place for me. Also, the chefs weren't Japanese, the sushi they offered were lacking in diversity (some due to their use of sustainable seafood), and ultimately, I couldn't get past their interesting but strange concoctions. \n\nAlso, when we called in to ask what the wait was for two people, they said that they had one table open. We stated that we'd be over there right away and whoever was on the other line said \"good luck.\" We thought this was a very strange response. Also, in the middle of our meal, we were debating on getting more sushi.

Their lunch specials is slightly pricey. $10 for a sushi combo with a 6-piece roll of simple sushi along with 4 piece nigiri or additional $4 for 7-piece nigiri. I ordered a philidelphia roll and the CA roll/4piece nigiri combo. Turned out to be $15 lunch... :/ The pieces are slightly small and their Philly roll just wasn't raw salmon. It was smoked-salmon with cream cheese.... is it normally like that cuz I always had raw salmon in my rolls. *shrug\n\nAll in all, I did have a satisfying lunch. Better than Godzilla, IMO. Way better. It's definitely not a daily lunch to splurge on~", "author": "Rosanne L."}

I wish that the seats at the bar had a little backing so I could at least hang my jacket or my bag. \n\nItwas a little hard to flag down a server to take our order since they were so busy. After we placed our order, the food came quickly and the chefs even just passed the rolls and sashimi to us over the bar. \n\nI really liked the Tataki roll since it had different seared fish. The sashimi was fresh and I love the idea that Tataki is sustainable sushi. Very impressed. We had several rolls, scallops, and sashimi. The rolls weren't exceptionally good, but all the fish were very fresh. My favorite of the night was the scallops.", "author": "Jay L."}

The place is a bit small but the high ceilings, large windows, and light colors kept it from feeling cramped.  We had about a 15 min wait but were able to check out the menu and decide what to order.\n\nI am a big fan of sangria so when I saw the kin-san-gria on the happy hour menu, I was intrigued!  It was light and refreshing and served in a fluted glass.  Fun for something different!\n\nHighlight of the night: the garlic edamame.  My boyfriend is constantly in search of good garlic edamame and this place did not disappoint!  The fried calamari was pretty standard and we were in the mood for rolls so we tried the extinguisher, arctic char and avocado, spicy tuna, and the golden state roll.  My favorite was the golden state roll mostly because it was so unusual.  I had never had apple in a roll but it was actually really tasty.\n\nWe will definitely be back!", "author": "Heather K."}

They don't take reservations, so unless you plan on being there waiting for the place to open, expect a LONG wait for a table. \n\nWe were planning on dinner here, then drinks and dessert at The Bubble Lounge after. We never got to The Bubble Lounge, because we waited an hour and a half for a table here. And that wouldn't have been such a big deal if the host/waiter had told us honestly that it was going to be that long. He told us it would be 30-45 minutes when we got there at about 7:45. Okay, no biggie, we're looking at getting seated at about 8:15-8:30. Not 9:15 which is when we finally got seated. \n\nAfter we got seated, we weren't offered any sot of compensation for our extended wait by our waiter. He didn't even bring us water for another 5-10 minutes. (I suggest he look up \"service\" in the dictionary.) When he finally came with the water, we were completely ready to order. Another few minutes, and we had our beverages, and a few minutes after that we had our sushi.\n\nAll in all, the food was good. Nothing too special - the sushi is fresh, and the portions are fairly standard for the price. The soy sauce on the table was a little salty, and we kept trying to flag down our waiter to tell him that, but he kept going past us. Lucky for us, one of the sushi chefs (Ken) heard us talking about it, and personally brought us low-sodium soy sauce. He also talked to my husband for a minute, found out he like spicy foods, and comped us one of their signature rolls, the Extinguisher. Like I said, the best service we got all night was from him.\n\nOne thing I need to say - I've never eaten somewhere where the server can have long hair not pulled back from their face. Our server had shoulder-length hair that was just hanging down. I'm fairly certain that's a health code violation. But I digress.\n\nOverall, this place is NOT worth an hour and a half wait. If you're planning an evening in the city that includes sushi, pick somewhere that takes reservations so you don't waste your whole evening in the cold waiting for a table.", "author": "Amy E."}

(I looked for any specific comments amongst the reviews and found none, however, which is why I felt compelled to add this note.) They came to a solution of nabbing a corner for us and thus confining the tiny one to his seat, which worked well enough as he's a fairly well-behaved child, but if you're planning to bring a kid along for dinner who actually needs a high chair to sit up or keep them from roaming? No dice here. Even so, the staff was courteous and fairly accommodating about the tiny guest in the corner, so all's well that ends :)", "author": "Stephanie C."}

What I also noticed is that they are good at what they do. A lot better than most places in the city. \n\nThe main thing about this place is their \"tataki\"...pretty much seared fish marinated with a sauce afterwards, which is pretty simple. Here at Tataki they do it a little bit differently. They serve a variety of fishes served in that manner, seared with a sauce/vinegar and some garnish. We had two different ones..the kurodai and the char. I preferred the char much more with the yuzu sauce.\n\nJust for kicks we had the extinguisher roll, that comes with a nice little fire on the side. Just salt that has alcohol lit up next to your sushi. The roll was good and I enjoyed it. I've always enjoyed eating rolls with avocado and such. Its an american thing hahaha, because my mom prefers just eating sashimi/nigiri.\n\nTheir nigiri/sashimi were fresh and we stuck with the chef specials instead. And they laid out a nice display of fish for us. \n\nI think we had 2 bottles of sake and a couple beers, I don't remember exactly but my face was heating up. By the time we finished everything, we noticed the rest of restaurant was empty...we were the last ones! I felt so bad, but they didn't rush us and allowed us to take our time. But of course, we finished our bottle quick so we wouldn't hold them back from closing up.\n\nOverall, Tataki was a good call. Though we had a bit of a wait, but that was already expected. Food and service was good, I would come back again.", "author": "phillip w."}

I was impressed by the conviction of the restaurant to create a sustainable sushi environment, though the fish seemed to lack something...i'll call it flavor.  Perhaps that's why other fish are overfished and these particular ones are not.\n\nThe star of the show was by far the Arctic Char.  Never heard of it before, but I left there a big fan.  The Arctic Char and Avocado roll was very good, and the Tataki Deluxe provided more slices of Arctic Char along with Katsuo, Kurodai, Scallop, and Albacore.  Each type of fish came with a special dipping sauce that enhanced the flavor of the fish, and at times, really provided the only flavor in that particular bite of fish.\n\nI agree that dining at a place like this greatly enhances your knowledge and sensibility of our ecosystem, sustainability, and all that great tree hugger stuff, and i enjoyed my awareness being raised on the issue of sustainability.  That being said, i would find it hard-pressed to make it back there on that premise knowing that the times that i do dine out, i'd really like to enjoy and savor the meal, even if it means making the environment second fiddle for 1.5 hours.

I kept seeing the bookmark on my Yelp but never made it out here until I met up with a girl friend who lives in the area.\n\nWe walked in around 6:55pm and the place was full but definitely not packed.  We opted to sit at the bar since service always seems faster there.  I looked at the menu and noticed that HH ended at 7pm.  I quickly looked up smiled big, and asked the sushi chef if it was too late to order off the HH menu.  :D  He said go ahead and we got the deep fried spicy tuna roll, the artic char, and the fried calamari.  We added the Tataki salad, and 6 piece sashimi to the order along with two iced teas.  \n\nI think this was the first time I've had artic char.  It looked a little like salmon but it tasted like...fish?  haha.  The deep fried spicy tuna roll was yummy but it wasn't spicy at all!  The tataki on the tataki salad was sooo good, and probably my favorite.  The salad itself was crammed onto this little bowl and it was nearly impossible to eat from it.  It was almost like a never ending bowl of greens.  The calamari was good but the leggy pieces were extra scary and some of them, I swore still had heads and eyes.  Pass...  Sashimi was ok, I only ate 2 or my share of pieces.  I also ordered a tataki roll, to go for my BF.  Before he got home, I secretly ate one and it was delicious.  I loved the presentation of this restaurant!\n\nThe whole bill, including tax/tip came up to about $65.  I don't know if I would come back.

I think the problem with sushi places, or a good majority of the restaurants in SF is that you can't make reservations. And I hate waiting. Not a good combo, especially when you're hungry, cold, tired and, because it's SF, cold again. \n\nWe waited a little over an hour for two people on a Saturday night. By the time we got in, it was 9:30. The entire space consists of tables of two that maybe seats 20 total, and a sushi counter that seats four. We sat at the counter and ordered: albacore tataki, divisaderoll, double-double, golden state, and 49-er. The albacore was awesome, but the rolls were just okay, but I have to admit, the quality of the fish was very good. My fave out of the rolls was the 49-er because I love that thinly sliced lemon on top. Mmm-mmm-MMM!\n\nService was decent and pleasant enough. The sushi chefs were nice as well. Once we sat down, the food came out at a decent pace, but the wait was a killer. Especially in sub-zero (30-degree) temperatures. There are two seats outside and like two inside to hide from the elements, but other than that, bring a puffy North Face jacket in the winter and brace yourself for a wait. If you bring a date, she might hate you for the wait. Unless she's totally into you and wants a long wait because she never wants the night to end. Highly unlikely.\n\nLooking at the menu, I would probably come during happy hour for the specials, although for our dinner, for that amount of food, it was only $60. \n\nAnd the key to this place is that it's sustainable sushi. So I guess it's not overfished. Personally, I could care less about this, but do appreciate it. Maybe if it weren't sustainable, they'd be caught faster and the wait would be shorter.", "author": "Ming-Jou C."}

I asked a waiter to give us an estimate for the amount of time we'd be waiting and he said 25-45 minutes. Hmmm....what kind of an estimate is that? We weren't sure if we had enough time for a drink next door, but decided to take our chances and enjoy a glass of wine at Solstice.\n\n40 minutes later (and a bit tipsy from wine) we were seated at Tataki and ready to get our sushi on.

First things first - you don't want to come here too late. Space is a bit tight, and even though we showed up at 6:30, we still had to wait outside for about 15-20 minutes before getting seated. There's no waiting space inside either, so if it's a cool night, make sure to come with something warm to wear! Prior to arriving, we didn't really look at the menu closely...so we were a bit shocked to take a look once we got seated and see no bluefin tuna, salmon, eel, or many of our favorites that are staples of our sushi-eating experiences.\n\nNevertheless, the food was absolutely superb. We got the tataki deluxe, which is a fabulous sampling of different types of tuna tataki paired off with different dipping sauces. I don't remember them individually, but each pair was unique in its taste, and all of them were very delicious. The toro, even though it wasn't the traditional kind, was fantastic as well; it just fell apart in our mouth when we ate it, and we had to order a couple more pieces before we headed out. The dragon roll was also very good as well. Despite using cod as a substitute for eel, it was still very savory, and you couldn't tell too much of a difference in the taste. My only suggestion would be to add a little more of a marinade or sauce to the cod, but otherwise it was fantastic.\n\nThe restaurant has a nice cozy atmosphere to it, and the service, even when completely packed, was very good and was quick to get our food served.

By no means am I throwing Burger King wrappers on the street or dumping battery acid into storm drains... but when it comes to saving the environment, I'm slightly behind the curve as I do my best to evolve into a full on hippie. \n\nI barely drive (opting for public transportation), I compost, I only drink tap water, I try to use tote bags when I'm at the grocery store, etc.... Now, I can carve another environmentally friendly tactic into my belt: sustainable sushi.\n\nBefore last night, I actually had no idea anything like this existed. Sure, I understand the detrimental effects of netting, fish farming and the like... but call me ignorant, as I had no idea some of my favorite sea creatures were technically on the 'avoid' list of terrible seafood choices. Some of those include unagi, king crab, toro and more. Most of these little critters are over-fished to meet demand, so it's destroying the underwater eco-system. It's a shame more seafood joints don't take an active role in educating their patrons about these hidden issues, but I'm stoked that Tataki not only takes the time to pull back the curtain, but they've built their entire business practice on serving nothing but sustainable sushi.\n\nMonterey Bay Aquarium has these nifty little handouts as a go-to guide on the good/bad seafood choices, and Tataki only serves stuff from the 'best choices' and 'good alternatives' section of the pamphlet. Sure, it limits their menu just a tad, but it's nice to have the peace of mind that you're not destroying an entire underwater population with every hand roll that swims into your belly.\n\nWith that limited and often fluctuating menu, they do a good job of ensuring you're getting a pretty quality meal. Their specialty rolls are dope (with my favorite being the extinguisher... whoa!) and they have day-to-day local specials based on whatever goods get plucked out of the San Francisco Bay that day. \n\nWhile everything I tried on the roll side was fantastic, I thought the miso soup and the ocean salad were Shit-tay with a capital S (as you can see). The miso was pretty bland, and the ocean salad just tasted like I was swallowing a mouthful of sea water with odd-textured seaweed. Not exactly the most appetizing way to begin a meal, so it's a good thing the sushi delivered a come-from-behind win. On my next visit, I'll likely skip the apps and go straight to the fishies.\n\nApparently, Tataki is the only truly sustainable sushi joint in North America... so despite their shortcomings in the starters department, what they're doing is remarkable and well deserving of five stars (in my opinion). \n\nIt's a pretty small joint, so seating is at a premium.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-12", "description": "I almost feel bad giving it three stars because it has such a fantastic star rating. However, my taste buds beg to differ. \n\nI heard about this place a while ago but never really solidly put it in my mind. Then a few months ago, I went to the academy of sciences night events on Thursdays and they were there doing a demonstration on sustainable sushi. They gave a great shpeal on how they use many different types of fish to substitute for the non-sustainable fish that they don't offer (i.e. salmon, unagi) and I had a taste and it was actually not bad. I had it in my mind to try this place, plus the bf REALLY loves sushi ... lol\n\nCame here last night with no reservations, surprised to have gotten a seat at their only window spot and it was nice. The inside is REALLY tiny and has about 10 tables and can seat maybeeee 20 people so this is not a good place for a group. It's a little difficult to find because it's so small and parking is just horrific near California and Diviserario (sp???) regardless. They have happy hour between 5 pm - 7 pm every day and we got there around 6:15 so took advantage of their happy hour specials.\n\nThey make a killer sangria and it's only $5 during their happy hour (normally $7.50). They had about five rolls on their happy hour menu which was **ok** ... their notable for the fact that the rolls had a lot of fish in it instead of small tiny rolls like I expected for happy hour. Otherwise, their normal rolls are creative and there is a lot of attention to detail, such as the olive looking sauce drip on top of their \"extinguisher\" roll ... but for the most part I thought the sushi here was only ok. Nothing was spectacular even the special tartare they recommended as a starter was only alright. Creative ideas, but maybe not so well executed?\n\nI did not have a bad time, but with all the other sushi offerings, perhaps non-sustainable and/or similar places in the area that are, I don't see why I'd come here for mediocre sushi and a lot of \"sustainability tax\" (i.e. the rolls were pricey, if we did not get happy hour rolls, it would have been probably $80-90+ for two people). I think this is a cool place to come, try and decide for yourself, unfortunately I decided it was only worth 3 stars for me.", "author": "Lorrie M."}

I suppose almost 400 people agree, so it's not exactly a secret, but after having fantastic sushi for years in NYC, LA and even Chicago, I have found sushi in SF to be just OK until now.  So what matters to me: Texture, Temperature and Taste.  None are more important than the other but all three = freshness.  I ordered the sashimi deluxe dinner and a couple of roles.  The sashimi came out just right.  The fish was cold and a bit firm when first biting, but then melt in your mouth afterwards.  The fish was full of flavor and each was very distinct from one another.  Just about perfect.  \n\nI also ordered the faux nagi, which was quite spectacular.  The dish exists as a replacement for the non-sustainable unagi, but I think surpasses the original.  They put a nice char on the fish and use a similar sauce, but the meat is far more tender and leaves a much cleaner aftertaste than the original unagi.   \n\nFor bonus points, the prices are very reasonable and they claim to be the only sustainable sushi bar in North America.  What does that mean:  they choose fish that are abundant, line caught or farmed in sustainable ways and do not contain all of that mercury and crap that you aren't supposed to eat.  So, your wallet, body and conscience can feel good about eating at this place.  \n\nI so wanted to give this place 5 stars, but there is room for improvement.  I didn't think the rolls were all that great.  The higher priced specialty rolls did not come with very much fish and they used so much sauce accompaniments, that it was hard to find the taste of the fish.  If you are going to jam that much stuff in a roll and add sauce to boot, you really need to bring more fish, otherwise it gets lost.  For the cost of two rolls, you can just about get another sashimi platter, a much better investment in my book.", "author": "Scott C."}

We came across this place on yelp and it have pretty good reviews. So why not give this place a try. This place is very tiny and packed with people. We have to write our own name on the waiting list. We waited for 50 mins before we got a seat at the sushi bar.  We ordered a hot tea, saki and Sapporo beer to start off. While we look at the menu we decided to order the sashimi regular, tataki roll and extinguisher. Service was little slow but understandable since the restaurant is packed and only have two sushi chef and two waiter/waitress. After we have some drinks the sashimi arrived. The salmon to me looks awfully dark, darker than I ever have for sashimi. Anyway we went ahead to try it and sure enough, it definitely tasted fishy.  Usually salmon should have a fresh sweet buttery flavor that would melt in your mouth. But this one tasted fishy. We have to turn it back. The waitress apologized and ask the chef to replace with something else. They came back with a snapper which tasted good. They put some ginger sauce on top. Maybe they were afraid we will complain again.  The next roll was the tataki roll with seared fish and a sauce was glazed over the sushi. I felt it was too soggy. The rice little wet and I don't taste the seared.  The extinguisher was on the hot side. Overwhelmed with hot sauce that I don't taste the freshness of the fish. Overalls my opinion with this place is that they try too hard to make the food fancy. Which caused the taste for the freshness of sushi. Almost all the fish I have there is covered or topped with sauce. The salmon they didn't cover with sauce was fishy. Really make me wonder if they want to hide the quality of the fish. On top of that the waitress came back and told us saying that the chef just want you to know the fish was fresh cut today. Really?? Makes me wonder.", "author": "Becky K."}

We bought a coffee across the street and waited, watching the restaurant like a couple of creepers.  And because we were feeling so creepy, we decided to wait for other customers to go in before we headed over.\n\nAnyway, Tataki is a small restaurant with about 28 seats, so the early bird thing most likely paid off in this instance since it sounds like the wait here at dinner time can be quite long, especially on a Saturday night.  Cool thing about this place is that there's happy hour everyday until 7pm.  We ordered the arctic char/avocado roll, a Kin-san-gria for me and a small hot sake for him from the hh menu.  I couldn't taste the alcohol in the Kin-san-gria; it was good!  About halfway through our meal, the phantom alcohol hit me, so I'm glad I only had one.  We then ordered the garlic edamame, pacific sunrise roll, uni nigiri and the tataki deluxe.  We tore through the edamame like no one's business; the soy sauce and slight lemony tang along with the loads of garlic was so yummy.  Both the rolls we ordered were pretty good too; not the best I've had but I liked them.  The uni was sweet and creamy; it was definitely good quality uni.\n\nThe best thing at Tataki is--you've guessed it--the tataki!  The tataki deluxe came with 20 delicious, delicately arranged pieces of various fish along with dipping sauces to match.  The fish and sauces paired together wonderfully!  Good thing I dined with the mister (well, it's always a good thing) because I was definitely not minding my manners as I double dipped my fish after each bite to get more of the sauce on each piece.  The next time I come here, I'd forego the rolls and stick to the tataki, sashimi and nigiri.", "author": "Thi D."}

The sushi had the fish on the outside of the roll and there was generous amounts of  red caviar on all the rolls we ordered.  \n\nI also noticed that the sushi was warm.. either slightly seared or served on warm rice.. and had some sort of marinade on it like soy sauce or something of that nature.  Not exactly what I'm used to as I prefer my sushi chilled. Taste-wise the sushi was also somewhat banal and I didn't really get a \"kick\" out of anything I had here.. not even the 49-er ;)  lol\n\nLastly, their wasabi was slightly discolored.. brownish. Perhaps it was organic or sustainable.. either way I didn't like this but accepted it figuring it was normal.\n\nWe went (2 ppl) on a Wednesday evening at 7:30PM and the wait was 5 mins. By 8:00 there were empty seats. We ordered between the 2 of us the half bottle of unpasteurized sake and another small sake, edamame, 3 rolls (49er, golden state, and something else I forgot, and the green tea cheese cake). \n\nOh, last remark about this place: Lots of rice in the rolls and so you don't need to order too much to be full.

I mean don't get me wrong, god (whoever that is for you) bless there souls for being ecovironmentally conscious, but it's simply a niche, and a valiant attempt at differentiating.\n\nAnd somehow, I guess it's working because I have no idea how the food here on its own can average 4 stars.  I came here on a Monday night, so there were no crowds or a long wait to sway my judgement here (unlike some other low-star reviews, this review is completely even-tempered, unbiased, and all about the food ;-) )\n\n- We had the baked mussels to start. They were a little gritty, not very hot, and parts of it stuck to the shell (not in a good way.)\n- Then seaweed salad; ok, it was seaweed salad.\n- Then we each had the 9 piece nigiri.  Nothing memorable except me thinking \"I wish this was the smooth, melt in your mouth fish like 7/10 sushi places in SF can do because the fish is just that great out here and all you have to do is slice it ... \".  But then I remembered, \"oh yeah, this is sustainable fish :-/  \", so I just ate and thought about my future children and mustered a smile.\n- then the extinguisher roll.  There was really nothing memorable about this at all except fire on the plate.  Plus the roll was tiny.  Am I really going to pay $12 for fire?\n- we had some other roll too, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it was like. \n\nSo if you've been craving really good sushi, and are scouring yelp looking for a place with great, fresh, fish, I would recommend you bypass Tataki and go for something ... less sustainable.\n\nOn the other hand, if you've just over-pumped the gas in your car and some of it leaked out, run over a squirrel, or otherwise maimed a breathing being (trees/plants count) and are looking for something to make you feel a little better about your part in the environment, then perhaps Tataki is the place for you tonight.\n\nCheers, and happy fishing.\n\n(Btw, I would have really liked to have given this a 2.5 star review based on the food, but had to go whole numbers; the wait staff unfortunately tipped it lower.)", "author": "Jenny X."}

How can you say no to that?\n\nLet me begin by saying I'm a total sushi snob.  I live for Sushi.  Before discovering Tataki, I was a complete newb when it came to sustainable sushi.  I discovered it with a DJ friend who had just met one of the owners, a true crusader for the sustainable seafood movement.  After meeting him,  learning all about sustainability and more responsible choices, I was inspired to follow in the same pursuit and be more conscious of what I ate from then on.  \n\nEverything they serve is either Best Choice or Good Alternative on the Monterey Bay Seafood Watch Guide so you won't find normal Sushi items such as Hamachi, Toro or Unagi, all in the Avoid category either for inhumane catching methods, being overfished or harmful to eat.  Some of the alternatives they offer taste and look exactly like, or even better than, the other stuff, you can't even tell the difference and you won't miss it - I promise.  The fish I've had there has always been fresh, juicy and delicious. I love the poke sampler, a sweet, savory and spicy trio; my favorite is the spicy, it's fantastic.  Also try the tataki roll and extinguisher roll, the flame on the plate adds extra pizazz! And if you're feeling ace, order the \"V.I.P. roll\", it's not even on the menu! Did I mention everything is delicious?\n\nI'm really glad I discovered this place and the movement.  Now I'll never eat farmed, overfished or inhumanely caught fish.

We were really hungry looking for a sushi place and waited until 6pm on a Sunday for the place to open.\n\nLuckily enough we were able to sit and order immediately. We started with Miso soups which were great as expected. We shared an order each of the Rainbow, Shrimp Tempura and Dragon Roll. Now the rolls we ate here stood out immediately as we started chewing. We had been eating at various sushi places frequently. Tataki's fish is simply fresher than fish at any other sushi place. Its texture is more natural and its taste perfect. Especially the Shrimp Tempura roll...It came with some sort of shiny-red crumbled batter which was excellent. \n\nAfter dessert we paid less than 50 dollars with a generous tip.\n\nI have been relying on yelp extensively to find places to go, so I decided it was my turn to give feedback. I'll go as far as to say that Tataki is the best sushi I hade in SF so far.", "author": "Bulent K."}

I came here, wanting, hoping, to love it and to think, 'hey, you CAN eat fabulous sushi and not totally lay ruin to the oceans!'  I hoped I would think, 'man, I wish there was a sustainable sushi place in my neighborhood!'\n\nOne problem: their sushi was not fabulous.\n\nOh, it was passable.  It was really fresh (I am coming to find that in San Francisco, most all fish is really fresh, and that's to be expected, considering its location) and I didn't think it would make me sick or anything.  But, well, I ordered the chef's choice of nigiri thinking that he would choose selections of fish that complemented one another, that had different tastes, that showcased the variety of his restaurant.  He didn't.  Three of the four selections were as bland of fish as I've ever eaten.  The waitress didn't even bother telling us what they were until we asked (she did, however, tell another couple as we craned our necks to overhear).  One of the four selections was absolutely fantastic - buttery and almost citrusy in its sweetness.  Too bad I don't know which one it is so I can't plug it!\n\nWe also got three rolls and the arctic char with avocado was, as promised by the previous reviews, the best.  Like a salmon-avocado with a kick.  The pieces were big and juicy, almost too big to fit in my mouth in one bite.\n\nWe also got Tataki's version of a rainbow roll, the Tataki roll, in which the chef seared the variety of fish on the outside with a blowtorch and topped the whole thing off with four kinds of caviar.  It looked beautiful and was fun to watch the guy prepare but... eh.  It was pretty good, but nothing phenomenal, and it had a blowtorch aftertaste.\n\nThe one roll I didn't even finish was their spicy tuna roll.  Spicy tuna mix wrapped in crab and topped with habanero and avocado... sounds good, right?  Not if the whole thing tastes like fake crab!  I asked before we ordered the roll - is this real or fake crab? - and she told me it was half and half.  Well, half and half doesn't matter if it tastes like the cheapest crab salad from King Soopers.  Really.\n\nNormally I would give this level of food and experience two stars, but for being sustainable and trying to do their part, I'm giving three - but begrudgingly, since no sushi in San Francisco should ever be worse than most of the sushi in Boulder, CO!", "author": "Hannah E."}

Everything was great, without being too much. What you would expect for sushi. Selection is not as large (don't expect Yellow Tail), but once you read about fish sustainability, you won't be wanting it anyway. Not a fan of the tataki roll, but personal preference. Rainbow was exceptional, tobiko really good. Edemame had a hint of butter which made them incredibly tasty. \n\nService: 4 \nYou sign in and might have to wait because of the size, but they are good at giving you a heads up and inviting you to grab a drink next door while you are waiting. Waiter was good, a little dry but really efficient. Rolls are served as they are ready, which is good and bad. Don't expect a large plate with everything on it, so if you like to end with a last bite of (name your roll here), you'll have to save it. Our last rolls came a little too late and had lost our eating momentum (and it was the Tataki which we didn't like as much, so dinner didn't end on the strongest note)\n\nAmbiance: 3.5\nwood chopsticks, small place, nice tables.

The restaurant is on the smaller side; it can probably fit about 30 people via tables and about 5 at the counter. The allure of this place is that it promotes sustainability, so that means no blue fin tuna. \n\nThe staff is very nice and knowledgeable. Water was refilled every second. \n\nHere's what I had: \n\n2 pieces of uni ($8) - wild diver-caught urchin, U.S :  fresh, had a lot of flavor. \n2 pieces of hotate ($6) -  suspension-farmed scallop, Japan : soft like a pilow \n2 pieces of Iwana ($5)  - closed-farmed arctic char, Iceland : tasted somewhat like mackeral, but I liked how soft it was.\n2 pieces of  Saba ($4.5) - wild Atlantic mackerel, Norway: tasted like Spanish mackerel \n\nTotal damage per person is around $30, it varies depending on what you get. I think 9 nigiri pieces is usually enough to feed the average person. \n\nThe fish on the west coast seems to be a lot drier than that of the east coast. It is like someone patted the uni and the hotate dry with a paper towel. It doesn't really affect the taste that much, it is just something I noticed. \n\nOverall, not a bad deal for sustainable, fresh, and rather inexpensive quality sushi.

Forget them, because at Tataki you'll be eating things like mackerel and char instead.  And they taste a million times better.  \n\nSwoon.  I love Tataki.", "author": "Julie H."}

We had already ordered. \"What is that?!?\", she exclaimed. Wanting to cross my fingers, I retorted with, \"Extinguisher...?\".\n\nOur order at this new & not-so-reasonably priced Sushi joint in Pacific Heights consisted of their Asian-fusion style Beef Carpaccio, an Artic-Char roll...and of course, the Extinguisher roll. \n\nEdamame was complimentary with our order, I always like that...and the beef Carpaccio appetizer was perfect for sharing--I hate onions but actually enjoyed the mildly onion flavored sauce.\n\nThe sushi was SUPER fresh, and being a fan of anything hot & spicy the Extinguisher roll delivered. At first you don't realize how hot it is, but there's this residual, \"OMG MY MOUTH IS ON FIRE I NEED WATER OH WAIT ITS NOT HELPING EAT SOYBEAN DRINK WINE AHHH IT'S GOING AWAY MUCH BETTER\".\n\nThen of course, you have another one.\n( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/8RnqktI7A5mY1_NdR1j7nQ/l )\n\nOur server had also mentioned the Nigiri special for the evening, Alaskan Salmon.

Everything is sustainable here so be prepared to try some new fish and it is absolutely delicious.\n\nThe arctic char was really good as well as a bunch of other fish that I couldn't get the name of.  We ordered the nigiri platter and got no explanation on what everything was which was disappointing.  It was all very fresh, unfortunately they only gave us one nigiri of each kind so my date and I couldn't try the same fish together.  The interior is small and cozy with 4 spots available at the sushi bar. The chefs were helpful but I felt bad after asking them what every fish was that i got so I spared them and shut up after a while.\n\nIt can get busy (at least on weekends) so be prepared to wait.

Ikura Nigiri was soft and gently popped in your mouth like small fireworks.\n\nThe Extinguisher was almost like a fancy show, that they put sugar on the side, light up a fire that was burning when they served it. Beautiful and eye-catching, the blood red habanero infused tobiko on kampachi avocado roll was inventive and delicious.\n\nThey also have an excellent selection of cold sake. We first had the Otokoyama as it's always a great choice. Then moved onto the vanilla flavour Sho Chiku Premium. Both were perfect complementary to the sushi.\n\nThey had 2 kinds of not so common desserts-- coffee jello with Kahlua cream sauce and whipped cream, definitely made my tongue dance! The green tea cheesecake was solid, creamy but not too heavy, and with slices of strawberry \"garnish\" which balanced the taste and made the experience unforgettable!\n\nAnd all these were ONLY 100 bucks. You just can't beat the excellent quality and perfect upbeat ambiance!\n\nTheir use of wooden plates and reusable chopsticks, as well as their promoting environmentally friendliness definitely made them stand out from many other sushi places I have been to.\n\nAnd even the bathroom had its own character, the round lighted mirror made an interesting reflection in your pupils.", "author": "T L."}

I've been to a few veggie sushi spots in the mission which were decent... but the most interesting roll I've had at one of those places was an avocado tempura roll.  Tataki has a full veggie menu with really awesome choices like a veggie philly roll (bean curd serves as the protein), hot potato roll (some sort of sweet potato in an amazing sauce), asparagus tempura roll topped with shaved pumpkin, etc. I'm not doing it justice so you'll have to go check out the menu yourself.  \n\nMy fish eating friends have all loved the regular sushi menu as well.  Apparently the fish is sustainable and extremely fresh.  Everyone I've come with has come back multiple times after our visit.\n\nMy only qualm is the space is a little small.

Probably got here around 6:25pm, parked by 6:30 (got lucky with parking), and waited about 40 minutes to get seated. This place is SMALL. I wouldn't recommend coming with a large party unless you come super early or super late.\n\nTo start off, the service was only average. For such a small place, I would've expected more attentive service. There was only one waiter and a lady who filled up water. We were served non-iced water with a slice of cucumber inside. Friends got some beer. Wanted to get the sangria but missed the happy hour after waiting so long, so... forget it.\n\nThe portions here are small. If we didn't order a platter of sashimi deluxe, I don't think we would've been full. The rolls had \"6 pieces\" or so, but they are so bite-sized! I guess being sustainable is more costly... ): but I didn't taste that much of a difference in the fish than other japanese restaurants of this pricing.\n\nWe started out with the garlic edamame appetizer. It was okay... kinda sour, which was weird. Don't recall finishing the dish. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nRainbow roll: YUM! I liked how they didn't throw in the shrimp as the orange color (like other places), but it was all fish (and avocados) on the top! I'm not a fan of california roll, so it was kinda nice to have a small roll with little imitation crab (: \n\nDivisaderoll: I liked it cause it was just albacore, avocado, and masago (I don't like all those extra cucumbers and stuff in my sushi).\n\nTataki roll: Very interesting! Wasn't a big fan of the sweet sauce, but the fish was seared just the right amount and the assorted tobiko was good presentation.\n\nGolden State roll: Not my favorite. I thought it would be better, but the apple was weird.\n\n49er roll: I liked this! I'm kind of a fan of lemon complimenting fish on sushi because of the kick of flavor, but the strong hint of lemon may be a way to hide other flavors, like \"not fresh\" fish\n\nSashimi deluxe: I wish I knew what everything on here was. There was the deliiciouuss sweet shrimp, the salmon was FRESH, there was skipjack tuna (weirdly dry? and flavorless), scallops, albacore tuna, artic char (tastes and looks similar to salmon), and some dirt tasting sashimi... seriously i was like wtf is this? i ate a mouthful of dirt (it was wrapped all fancy)\n\nCalifornia roll and spicy tuna roll: Both pretty basic rolls, but they did throw on some crunchy stuff on top to make it \"special\". \n\nI did appreciate how they did not throw everything on the table at once. They brought things out as we finished another dish, so we never had a cramp table from too many dishes presented at once.\n\nAll together with a sapporo and an asahi beer, the meal was $160 (+t&t).\nDon't feel like I'd come here again if I just wanted to get some sushi.", "author": "Adorable T."}

Not only is it 100% sustainable, it's vegetarian-friendly, and its sushi rolls are superb. Apparently lots of people think so because this place is CROWDED with LONG LINES. Walking by on Sat night, there were more people waiting outside than eating inside. Wisely we came back on Sun night at 9. Every seat was taken, but we were seated promptly (dishes come out quickly).\n\nThe stand-outs are the specialty rolls (had the ratatouille and 49er). The flavors are synergistically combined and balanced, ingredients very fresh, not too much rice... The regular rolls (futomaki, arctic char/avocado) were excellent as well. \n\nTataki is one of the few sushi restaurants that's vegetarian and vegan friendly. I'd even take my veg friends who're not into raw fish here just for the veg specialty rolls. \n\nOne of the things that make Tataki stand out from the numerous sushi places in the city: Tataki takes sustainability as its core design. Considering that sushi restaurants typically serve unsustainably farmed salmon and overfished tuna, Tataki is a much-needed trendsetter (http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?fid=60, http://www.sustainablesushi.net/). In fact Tataki is part of Monterey Bay Seafood Watch Restaurant Program http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/seafoodwatch/web/sfw_restaurant_program.aspx \n\nService is friendly and helpful enough however this place is badly in need of 50% more waitstaff (with more experience) and a hostess to manage the crowds. Better still OPEN ANOTHER TATAKI in my neighborhood (9th/Irving). Yes there's Koo and Ebisu already but Tataki is better and more exciting.\n\nFood: 4.5 stars (rolls are 5 stars)\nService: 2.5 (too crowded, not enough waitstaff to be attentive)\nAmbiance: 4 (again too crowded to be relaxing, 5 stars during not crowded hours)\n+ 1 star for sustainability", "author": "Yvonne C."}

This is a good place for a date that can stand waiting outside and being in a small, cozy Japanese sushi place.\n\nFirstly, this place is about sustainable sushi. This is a very good thing and I can eat my raw fish with little to no guilt. The wait can be pretty daunting. We came at 7:45pm on a Wednesday and the wait was still 30 min in the cold. We sat at the bar as we didn't want to wait longer for a table.\n\nMy foodie partner cannot eat certain kinds of fish, and we asked questions about the fish in one of the dishes and they were very accommodating in changing the fish in the dish to tuna.\n\nThe server was very helpful but after our order it took 10 minutes to get our drinks and first plate. That may not seem like a lot, but we asked and as it turns out the server totally forgot. He apologized and things went smoothly after that. Nevertheless, it was 8:30 before my first bite and I was famished.\n\nThe fish was, in a word, phenomenal. Kurodai tataki (5/5), 49er roll (4/5), sashimi taster (5/5). Every bite just melted in my mouth. The presentation was simple, elegant, and effective. Overall, the cost is a bit steep but it's what to expect for high quality sushi. A great place for a date, for sure.", "author": "Dave K."}

I'd called ahead and specifically asked about the wait and about coming early, and was told it was fine. So I asked another person and whether it was okay if I ordered and she was really cool about it and let me sit...\n\nThe sushi is awesome, both vegetarian and fish.

In my top 2 of sushi places ever.\n\nSeeing as how I'm vegetarian, I am very picky about what constitutes good sushi for me, but I also went with a meat-eater ;) and she gave it a thumbs up as well, so there's something for everyone--the mark of awesome sushi eating!\n\nFirstly: do not go if you are in a hurry on any evening--this place was packed on a Thursday night at 8pm! We waited about an hour to get in, as there is literally only about 8 tables and bar seating to squeeze everyone in. But the menu is amazing and just the smell of it was enough to force us to wait to be seated. The real problem with seating is that the waitresses fill it on a whoever-fits-first priority, so even though there were three of us in my party waiting an hour, a two-person party was seated quicker, because a two-seater opened up first.\n\nThe place is lovely once you're inside. Very cozy and romantic, and the sushi chefs were very nice! They talked to us a bit and made sure our meals were good.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian sushi plate, which came with a whole range of weird things I'd never eaten before (I did upload a pic also!), including avocado rolls, weird orange crunchy rolls, inari, a teriyaki mushroom roll, and veggie rolls. There were about 10 different options on the plate, and most of them were really fantastic. I don't care for mushrooms, but my girlfriend ate that one and said they were good.\n\nI also tried the veggie-option appetizer...which I can't recall what it's named, but it was SO GOOD. There were these root-type things that were fried I think and coated in a sweet and semi-spicy sauce. My gf and I are them all LOL\n\nOur friend tried the hot potato roll and after giving me one bite had to order a second one because I was drooling all over her plate. It is VERY spicy with the sauce on the plate, but you don't have to dip it. It was filled with a sweet potato and other awesome things. Our friend also tried the cold tofu entree; I didn't get the chance to ask her if it was good because it disappeared before I could!!\n\nMy gf ordered a California roll and the house roll (Tataki Roll) and both were phenomenal, she said. Our friend also got a miso soup, which was fab (NOT veggie though, because of the fish flakes for the broth).\n\nWe spent about $75 here for three people, which I don't think is TOO bad. My stomach says the price was well worth it. I will eat here again ANY day!!", "author": "Snarky R."}

All their rolls (while tasty) were lathered in sauces, so the fish in them was lost underneath.\nIt reminded me of sushi joints in Mexico, where the not-so-fresh fish is disguised with tons of other stuff (sweet, spicy, creamy, etc.). Sad, as I know they do work hard on obtaining fresh and sustainable sourced products. Not quite what their fish deserved.\nOne of the dishes even came with a flaming pile of sugar on the side, and although it was dramatic, did not deliver on the fish expectation front.\nThe place felt gimmicky.\nThe food was OK, but I would much rather go to a different place for my sushi, as I like the fish to speak for itself.", "author": "Rebeca R."}

The arctic char roll and the crunchy spicy tuna rolls were delish. I must say, I wasn't too impressed with their sake sangria thing. Stick to the cheap beer. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this place is tiiiiiiiinnnyyyy. We got there fairly early so there were only a couple of diners when we were first seated, but halfway through it filled up quickly. I may as well have been sitting on my neighbor's lap.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-05", "description": "I'd been wanting to check out Tataki for a while now. I like sushi, but I have to admit I kinda feel bad dining in sushi restaurants since so few offer sustainable options. Needless to say, I was thrilled by the idea of a sushi restaurant selling solely sustainable fare. But I never seemed to have the courage to dine here, since my desire to try other SF hotspots always won out. Well, I finally took the plunge when a group of us were in the city a couple weeks ago and we decided to grab dinner here.\n\nThere's a pretty diverse mix of sushi fare on the menu at Tataki. We wound up ordering a lot of food to share. We started off with some appetizers--an order of edamame, two orders of seaweed salad and two orders of the \"sea change\" jellyfish salad. (Get it? Our oceans will be full of jellyfish if we don't choose smart seafood choices.) The edamame were hot and not too salty. The seaweed salad was crisp and chewy--in a good way, mind you--and very flavorful. The jellyfish salad was, um, unique. I'd never had jellyfish before, so this was an interesting introduction. Flavorwise, it had a nice kick from the daikon radish. But I couldn't get past the texture, a bit like stringy Jell-O. I was glad I tried it, but I'm not sure I'll be rushing to order more jellyfish.\n\nWe ordered a plate of sashimi and four or five rolls for our main course. I didn't partake in the sashimi, but I did try a couple of the rolls. I lost track of what was what, but I know we ordered one that arrived on fire! Pretty entertaining, basically getting dinner and a show! We also ordered an off-menu option, the VIP roll, with the \"faux nagi\"--seared blackcod instead of fried unagi eel--that was pretty good. I was pleased to see so many veggie options on the menu at Tataki too. I ordered the veggie Philly roll (bean curd, cream cheese and avocado) and found it quite tasty. We also tried the Hot Potato roll, with sweet potato tempura inside and topped with \"tofuna\". The tofuna was, like the jellyfish, an interesting experience--it had paste-like quality to it, honestly. And I'd be remiss if I didn't give the chefs at Tataki points for presentation. All the food we ordered looked like works of art--from the intricate rolls to the jellyfish salad in a martini glass.\n\nWe ended dinner with a sampling of desserts--green tea cheesecake, red bean mochi ice cream, hot mochi and coffee jelly. All were mighty tasty, though I have to say the green tea cheesecake was the weakest (pretty standard in comparison to the rest, plus I'm not the biggest cheesecake fan). The mochi ice cream was great, as was the hot mochi, which tasted like peanut butter and graham cracker. The coffee jelly was nice--like Jell-O for grown-ups.\n\nWhile the food was pretty good--I'd say a solid four stars--our service was phenomenal. Our server was very friendly and very patient with us as we ordered food for the table. She was helpful, giving us some recommendations of her favorites. But most impressive, she handled our large party with grace, even whilst juggling other tables in the packed restaurant. The second server stopped by a few times and likewise, he was great. I rarely bump a restaurant up an entire star because of service, but Tataki's servers easily earned this restaurant a five-star review. \n\nI'd come back to Tataki in a heartbeat because they were so welcoming here. The food's great, but its really service where Tataki shines.\n\nBut just a quick word of warning--Tataki is tiny, like *seriously* tiny, so it was a bit of a wait for our table of seven. Even though we put our name in as soon as we got there, we wound up waiting 40 minutes--maybe even a whole hour?--for our table. It's not exactly a spot that's conducive to large groups. Not only is it hard to get a table, there's just not much room to move around.", "author": "Raul N."}

We searched on Yelp for the highest rated sushi restaurants and came across Tataki.  There is a reason why they have such high ratings.  The restaurant is small and intimate perhaps with around ten tables.  We were serviced right away.  We asked the waitress to have the chef prepare us whatever came to mind as we are not that big on ordering sushi (nothing fried and little or no rice) from menus.  The first roll that came out was riceless with four different types of raw fish rolled in cucumber covered in a sauce which tasted like ponzu.  It was delicious.  The second roll had smoked albacore with some sort of yellow roe on top.  Delicious as well.  The third roll I can't quite remember what it was but it was delicious as well.  For dessert, we ordered two different mochi desserts.  I wasn't too crazy over the first one (hot mochi covered in crumbs that resembled graham cracker).  The mochi kept getting stuck to my teeth and it was hard to chew.  We also had mochi ice cream and that was great.\nEverything came out pretty fast and our waitress was very attentive.  Best of all is that they are the only fully sustainable sushi restaurant in all of San Francisco, so you know that what you are consuming is the freshest sushi that can be offered.", "author": "Leslie S."}

Does that count?  I don't know if it classifies as sushi, but it sure is tasty!), \n ---and the double double (oh, my, god, melty-melt goodness!).  \n\nOh, I almost forgot to mention, I inhaled an ocean salad while simultaneously salivating over all the plates heading from the kitchen to nearby tables.\n\nI have to admit, like a parrot distracted by shiny things, I fixate on pretty presentations...but these aesthetically pleasing sushi  arrangements are like diamonds, not rhinestones.\n\nIn that vein, the bathroom has a magical mirror and equally ethereal lighting.  Don't give into the delusions--I know I don't look that good, not even after a large bottle of unfiltered sake!  But it sure makes me feel good.\n\nIn fact, everything about this place makes me feel good.  The pretty bathroom, the chill music, the friendly and unpretentious staff and chefs, the delicious food, and drum-roll, the environmentally friendly mission.  \n\nNow, if only it weren't so small (about four or five tables- and only four seats at the bar) and so very out-of-the-way for me.

Now I know what you're thinking.. really? California rolls... amazing?  YES!  We asked the chef -- and they use a special Japanese mayonaise which is creamy and delicious.\n\nThe sushi chef recommended the red snapper which was heavenly - light and buttery and the perfect fish for nigiri style. The seaweed salad stood out because it had 5 different kinds of seaweed plus cucumber. Typical seaweed salads have 1 or maybe 2 kinds. Again, great flavors. The waitress added some complimentary gobo (my request) which was a fun touch to the salad.\n\nWe left feeling very satisfied and spent only $50, which I consider a great value for sushi.  I'm not sure about the other Yelp reviews that say this place is not a good value.  I thought it was a fantastic value and this is our new favorite neighborhood sushi restaurant.

And I schlepped over again tonight in the chilly, windy weather because I liked this place so much before. I was anticipating the great sushi but what I wasn't anticipating was the absolutely rude staff, finger wagging waiter and vulture-like guests all huddled around the absurdly small front door galley waiting for 2 and 4 tops like they never had eaten before. Done.  Done. And done with this place. \n\nI waited for about 30 minutes for a table (over wine at Bistro SF Grill next door - btw, fantastic gourmet burgers, genuine and congenial service and delicious Turkish coffee) because apparently Tataki refuses to take the necessary steps towards making this a more pleasant dining and working experience by either 1) taking reservations along side their walk-ins, 2) allowing people to leave a phone number to call rather than yelling names when you know people aren't there/standing outside, or 3) investing in some vibrating remotes. So instead, patient patrons either hover in a 2x2 front door space, outside in the freezing wind, or are forced to check back to see where their names are on the list. So I went for the most rational option and went next door to have a glass of wine while I waited and decided I would check in every 5-10 minutes. I was right next door after all. \n\nI checked back 3x in the span of ~30 minutes to see where our names were on the list. At the third check in I was told to wrap up our tab at the cozy place next door as our names were next. No more than 3-4 minutes later we wrapped up our tab next door and popped back over to Tataki. After being ignored for a few minutes, I told the waiter running the list that we were back. Oh, wait. Just kidding. In the 3-4 minutes it took us to pay our tab literally 2 steps away, they called our name and because we didn't answer (duh, because I told you we were next door closing our tab as instructed) the waiter gave away our table. Already an awkward and rude move but  fine. However, when I asked why and got the finger wag in my face and then \"you're lucky I didn't just cross your name off the list all together\" comment, I figured it was game on. Don't even tell me I'm lucky you didn't do something. YOU'RE lucky half patient people put up with that nonsense on a regular basis to keep YOU employed. Please check the California unemployment report and number of good sushi places in this city before you make comments like that to people potentially paying your rent. I crossed my name off the list myself thank you very much and then went back to the friendly, cozy burger place next door and had a fantastic rest of the evening. \n\nI'd like to note that in addition to the great food and atmosphere at Bistro SF Grill, the owner brought us two pieces of their the new homemade polenta on the house. Clearly Tataki should take a few lessons from their new neighbors. \n\nAbsolutely no plans to go back to Tataki again.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

Here are some highlights:\n\n- Sashimi quality: The albacore tuna was so mushy it was disintegrating under pressure from my chopsticks- characteristic of fish that has been rethawed.  Every piece of yellowfin tuna was stringy.\n\n- Creativity: The first time I came here I ordered the sashimi regular, which consists of a \"chef's choice\".  In this case, the selection consisted of the exact same four fish featured on the cheaper sashimi taster plate, just more of it.  If that's what I wanted, I would've asked for 2 orders of the sashimi taster!\n\n- Rolls:  They tasted good, but the ones with cooked ingredients were at room temperature by the time they got to our table.  Also (and I'm not docking stars for this, but it's worth mentioning), they didn't meet the expectations set by their descriptions.  Two examples:\n1) The Extinguisher roll was good, but for all the hot ingredients and the flaming salt (!) on the plate, it would barely qualify for \"medium\" spiciness.  It even came with dollups of extra \"hot\" sauce on the side, which would have been more appropriate if it actually made the roll spicier.\n2) None of us could distinguish the apple flavor in the Golden State roll, let alone the scallop.

So when I was in the neighborhood again, I was looking forward to eating here, because I had heard/read some decent reviews, and in the past there really wasn't that many good sushi places within 8 blocks of here. \n\nSo we came just in time on a weekend night, early enough to beat the crowds. The place is quite small, and it can be a very long wait to get a table, as they do not take reservations. Come on a Friday or Saturday night at 7 pm and you may starve before you eat. Maybe that is why all the reviews are so good, because people were famished?\n\nYes, they try to offer sustainable seafood. That is admirable in environmentally PC conscious SF. From their website:\n\n\"Our Mission at Tataki is simple: to showcase the beauty and delicacy of Japanese cuisine while respecting the sanctity and fragility of our environment. If we are to preserve the art of sushi, we must also safeguard the health and biodiversity of our oceans. With this in mind, we strive everyday to integrate the concept of sustainable dining into our menu options.\"\n\nThis is marvelous and admirable. In fact, they were excited to offer a new seafood that night because it was new to them (did it just get released to the sustainability list?)\n\nBut as far as the total restaurant dining experience, I was underwhelmed. I really can't put my finger on it. Maybe I have been in really good sushi-ya in Japan and had too high expectations. Maybe the lack of Japanese service staff didn't make it feel authentic, although our waitress was very good. Maybe it was the slower than expected service. Or cramped tables. I don't know what I would have thougth if I had waited an hour like several people did, watching us through the window, waiting. \n\n The Chefs and co-owners are Chinese from Hong Kong, Raymond Ho and Kin Lui, with Casson Trenor, their \"sustainability guru\". \n\nWe orderd Edamame, which was a lot, and we finished it all well before the next dishes came. We also ordered sake, which they have a decent selection. The sushi was also pretty good, but not exceptional in my book. In fact my dining mate, an Italian American who hasn't had half the sushi experiences I have had, didn't think it was that wonderful either. \n\nFor me, a 5 star Sushi-ya,and I have rated many at that level on Yelp, so it is not that I am stingy or a complete snob,  needs to have a certain \"kimochi\"....or .feeling about it, a certain je ne c'est quoi, where everything fits together as authentically Japanese, with really good sushi. It doesn't have to have fancy decor, fancy sake, expensive and unique creations, just a certain feeling. Maybe it is a feeling locked in my earlier memories, when my grandparents in Japan owned a sushi restaurant, or my mother's memories as she grew up surrounded by sushi.. \n\nTataki is good, you can try it if you can wait your turn to eat. \n\nBut for me, it just doesn't quite excel for me personally.

The girl that sat behind me flicked her hair on to my head a few times on accident-thats how cramped the place was.  Also, they played hip music that did not go with the ambiance.\n\nWe ordered \n2 misos\n1 beer\nsashimi sampler (6 pieces for $11)\nsashimi special (2 pieces for $8)\nphili roll\nand some spicy roll\n\nThe miso was really odd.  Both of us thought it was made from pork- because that is EXACTLY what it tasted like.  My boyfriend could not finish his and I could hardly finish mine.  We asked the waiter and he said it was made from fish stock.  It was honestly the only miso i have ever had that I disliked.\n\nThe rest of the meal was good- but we racked up a LARGE bill.  \n\nAll of the fish is caught sustainably which is cool.\n\nWe will not be returning because of the environment, the gross miso and the high prices.

See them!). A pattern appears to be forming. \n\nAs for Tataki, it is small, has a nice initial vibe, then you realize it has music blaring loud enough that people have to bark over it (not very relaxing) and there is an odd smell of burnt arm hair that lingers in the air from chefs/servers who have singed their arm-pubes on the flaming extinguisher roll.\n\nThe food? Well, nothing was gastronomically memorable. The menu is very one-note and limmited with their offerings. There were two special nigiri of the day; an uncured mackerel and a \"fresh\" crab (I think king or snow crab). We had a couple orders of each, but sadly they were really uninspiring. The mackerel was OK but nothing like the rich flavor and delicate texture of a great Aji (which is cured but still is mackerel). The crab was very much frozen at some-point in it's life...so it was \"fresh\"ly thawed? \n\nNot the worst sushi experience, not good either. \n\nSub-note: \nA pet peeve of mine was hit at this place. I asked for hot tea, and it comes served in a shot-glass sized cup. Which in itself is not a problem. The promblem materilizes later whenl refills of tea never appear. Is an oz of tea supposed to suffice for my entire meal? Do I need to be the annoying customer who has to flag down the server after every sip, begging for a refill?  This is a majorly annoying failure of concept and/or service. Hot tea is something I like to sip during the entirety of my meal. It cleanses the palate, it calms the burn of a spicy offering, it is a huge part of my love for the sushi experience. A shot glass of tea is like some gigantic tease.

They only have sushi (sashimi, nigiri, rolls, et al), a few salads and miso soup.  No noodle dishes, tempura or say chicken teriyaki.

The Sashimi was SO good, Chef's choice included 3pcs each of: suspension-farmed Scallop from Japan, closed-farmed Striped Bass from Colorado, pole-caught Albacore and closed-farmed Arctic Char from Iceland. \nAs I've already mentioned, we don't get sushi of this quality in Portland (Bamboo Sushi is the only exception, but it's super expensive). \nThe Golden State roll and the Extinguisher roll complimented each other very well. The Golden state was light and refreshing and the Extinguisher had a heavier texture with lots of spice and the Presentation was pretty Awesome with Fire and all! \nService was great throughout the meal.\n\nI LoVED this place.

Oh, but go somewhere else for dessert.\n\nAnd since they serve high quality, sustainable sushi, you can also feel good about eating their food.  It's a very small place and they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait if you're coming during peak times. \n\nTri-Vegetable Sampler: Lotus Root Tempura, Skewered Potato, Spicy Burdock Root - a plethora of tastes and textures. The lotus root tempura is perfectly fried - light and crispy. The soft, smoking hot potatoes are drizzled with a sweet sesame sauce. The burdock root is salty, sweet, spicy, and chewy...almost like Chinese beef jerky. YUM! \n\nArctic Char Carpaccio - bright and refreshing. The tart yuzu sauce perk up the buttery, seared arctic char. The many capers overpowered the fish, but just remove a caper from each slice and it's just right. \n\nUni and Toro Nigiri - my two favorite kinds of sushi so I'm most particular about these, and Tataki did not disappoint. The uni was sooooo fresh, sooooo sweeet, soooooo creamy...soooo sublime. The toro was remarkably light and melted in my mouth. \n\nSpicy Tuna Roll - average.

Their pickled ginger was really good though. \n\nSashimi Deluxe - beautifully presented shiro maguro (white tuna), iwana (arctic char), maguro (tuna), hotate (scallop), katsuo (bonito), kodai (snapper). Overall, the sashimi was pretty good - the arctic char and scallops were excellent. The arctic char was so rich and silky that you don't even miss salmon (which is only available a few months). The scallops were plump and sweet. \n\nCalamari - the best calamari I've had in a long time. The batter was super light and crispy, while the squid was tender and warm. I loved the smoky, black pepper seasoning. \n\nChocolate & Strawberry Mochi Ice Cream - hard and grainy mochi. It must not have been fresh and/or frozen too long. I could get better mochi ice cream at Trader Joe's! \n\nKinako Mochi - toasted mochi in soybean flour.

After reading lots of great review on Yelp about this place and how they only use sustainable ingredient that doesn't undermine the ego food chain, I decided to go out of my normal treks and drive down there on a chilly SF Friday night.  \n\nWe had a group of 6, but it looks like the place is most suitable for dates as they have small tables of 2 (how could I missed the \"good for groups: NO\" on yelp! Inexcusable!).  We eventually got seated after 45 minutes of waiting which felt like 2 hours in a windy/rainy SF night.  The place was small so there's no way 6 of us could stand inside so we had to hang out under a nearby bus stop. Once we got seated we wasted no time in ordering the crowd favorites: the extinguisher roll, calamari's, an assortment of nigiris and sashimi's to try party favorite UNI sashimi. The food came after 15 minutes as we were drinking sakes.  Again, this is a date dining place with super small tables and elbow to elbow room.  So naturally a party of 6 celebrating a birthday could be a bit loud and we all stood out for our antics. We were fortunate enough not get called out for being because in 300 sq ft there's really nowhere to take our conversation.  \n\nWe devoured our appetizers upon their first impact.  The calamari itself were fresh and the house sauce was excellent, but the portion was too measly for our group of six. Next up were the nigiri's and tataki's... and let's just say that they don't taste as fresh as they sound \"on paper\".  But what the hell, we were starving after the long wait and having a good time and less about critiquing.  The long anticipated Uni's were up next, but again it was really... pedestrian.  I could name 5 sushi place in SF and Oakland that can easily run off with the best uni award and this place can't even touch them.  \n\nOverall, the experience was okay, but definitely not recommended for a big group.  The food was average.  And yes, whenever you wait for 45 minutes in ANY restaurant, your anticipation level just build up so anything less than stellar would cast a large shadow to your entire experience, so I could be a bit biased and filled with over-anticipation.

Try the Extinguisher Roll which comes complete with flaming salt, and the 49er Roll (masago and avocado topped with arctic char and a lemon slice).\n\nRestaurant is small so make a reservation lest you get stuck putting your name on the waiting list...

My first choice was to check out Sebo after all of the great reviews and the special on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations I really have been wanting to try it out but unfortunately they were closed.  I had heard of Tataki before and it was close by so we decided to check it out.  \n\nWe waited about 20 or so minutes to get our table and as we were waiting we were reading about sustainable fishing and the concept of their restaurant.  It was quite interesting to learn that hamachi was similar to sake in that they are heavily farmed and in many cases in \"dirty\" and questionnable farms so Tataki does not serve hamachi or sake.  They also serve fish in season that are fresh and would have lower levels of mercury, etc. \n\nWe decided to go with the sashimi deluxe platter along with a bunch of nigiri.  The sashimi platter was great since it had so many different types of fish.  I thought overall the fish was really fresh and whether its the sustainable fishing or what not, some things were very memorable.  To name a few, I really enjoyed the shiro maguro (tho strangely the toro shiro maguro wasn't quite as good!), hotate and amaebi was sooo sweet and yummy, aji was very good, ikura was fresh and not too salty, saba was lightly seasoned with seaweed, and the artic char was very good as well.  \n\nThe only thing about this place was the service which I thought wasn't so great.  I felt the staff wasn't very friendly, helpful or knowledgeable which made the experience not so grand.  Hopefully it was just that night because in general, I thought the food was good and I'd like to try some more of their dishes.  I would probably give this place a four star if it weren't for this one downfall...", "author": "Jessica T."}

They have a small selection of drinks, appetizers and selected sushi rolls that are reasonably priced. My friend and ate until we were stuffed and only spent $45 on dinner and drinks!  Make sure you go early so you get a seat for happy hour.  The restaurant is on the smaller side, so if you don't get there before it fills up, you'll be waiting for awhile. \n\nI always get the Arctic Char and Avocado roll.  The Char is like butter.  It literally melts in your mouth.  A good alternative to Salmon (since the restaurant only serves sustainable fish), it has a slightly more delicate flavor.  The crunchy california and crunchy spicy tuna rolls are good, but nothing too special.  Also, the Hotate (scallops) have a very sweet flavor.  Service is usually pretty good.", "author": "Nita K."}

Easy parking and a block of walking take us into the small, yet not rustic dining area. We sit at the bar in front of two friendly, fashionable Japanese Sushi rollers who smile at us. We smile back. Underground hip hop on the speakers bring a sway and bop to body. Same for the innovative reggae that plays later in the eve. \n\nWe order an initial app of organic edamame, which arrives in front of us in less than two minutes: warm, addictive, perfectly salted (ie, not too much). A vegan fare of three delicious, decadent rolls, await us next. Tataki boasts a separate and admirable vegetarian menu, and about 60 or 70 percent of the items are vegan, or can be made vegan. I like this, a lot.\n\nA Faux Tuna Roll with cucumber, and Vegan Cali roll with bean curd, vegan mayo and avo, arrive in the first 8 minutes after ordering. A few minutes after finishing these rolls, the Reggae Roll appears, looking rastafied, filled with tempura asparagus and topped with shredded seasonal pumpkin, avo and tomato. All are delicious. Six-dollar saki and Mochi dessert (goopy rice cake rolled in seaweed) bring the meal to divine harmony. \n\nI recommend this place, the best Japanese food I have tried as of yet in San Francisco. Plus, they offer small, paper guides discussing the fish to choose that offer less harm to marine life, and those that have more or less mercury. This is a conscious restaurant that educates and nourishes. Enjoy.", "author": "Gaya G."}

There are lots of Japanese places out there as you know, from purist sushi restaurants to all-you-can-stuff-your-face-with joints. You name it, I've probably been there. But I've never had better sushi experiences than at Tataki. I don't know where to categorize them. They're just ELITE. \n\nTataki is beautiful, an intimate spot to enjoy the freshest and most delicious sushi and sashimi. Being that they're sustainable just makes it that much better. Some of my traditional favorites are not served here like salmon and eel but I didn't feel deprived one bit. You might think their selection is limited because they only serve sustainable fish but when you order a Chef's Choice of nigiri or sashimi, you will see soon enough that you can help maintain the fish population and enjoy a delicious Japanese meal. \n\nThe Chef's Choice of nigiris was simply amazing the last time I was here. Do you ever see those plastic sushi displays outside of Japanese restaurants? It looks too perfect because they're fake. Well the plate that came to us was that beautiful but it was real! The fish was rich in various colors and just glistening even in the low light. I was tempted to stuff them all in my mouth immediately but I resisted, took my time and savored each flavor. The scallop was sweet and delightful. The black cod called \"faux-nagi\" is grilled and seasoned to taste like eel. I don't think it tastes like traditional eel because it's so much better! The \"faux-nagi\" is light and not as salty as a piece of teriyaki drenched eel. I love the added smoky flavor. The wild atlantic mackerel is well balanced. The tai snapper and almaco jack were also divine. Now I remember why I love nigiris. They are the prime example of the best and freshest. \n\nThe sushi rolls are innovative as they are tasty. One of my favorites is the Golden State Roll. It's fresh scallop with minced apple topped with albacore tuna, avocado, and even some 24k gold flakes. The apple is minimal but brings a sweet crisp flavor to the fish and rich avocado. During their happy hour from 5:30-7pm, my other must have roll, the Arctic Char and Avocado is only $4. The artic char replaces salmon and it is hard to tell the difference. It's the same color and it's still buttery and rich.  \n\nThank you Tataki. I can only hope that my next milestone review will be as environmentally responsible, delicious and makes me as happy as you! I've found my sushi heaven.\n\nNote: They also serve sustainable uni, sea urchin. Thank goodness! You just can't replace that.", "author": "Julia T."}

Splitting the Tataki Deluxe [20 pieces of seared fish with their respective dipping sauces] between two after ALL those starters was the exact portion to leave you satisfied, but not stuffed.

Came here for dinner last night with a friend. We started out with the edamame, hot sake and albacore tataki (seared albacore tuna with a garli sauce). Straight from there we both could instantly tell that the quality of the fish is impeccable and incredibly fresh. Their presentation is creative, original.\n\nAs for the main course, we decided to share different rolls. My favorite was by far  the Paradise sunset roll: cucumber and tuna rolls, (no rice). It was refreshing, light and really flavorful. We also had the popular extinguisher roll, which was delicious and pretty big for one roll. We also ended up getting a Golden State roll to finishi things off. After all the sake and great food, dessert was out of the question unfortunately.\n\nIt would be awesome if they took reservations though...waiting outside in the cold is not ideal, especially for a romantic date (not that I was on one at the time).

You pretty much can't go anywhere or do anything, your friends stop calling you because they always have to pay for you, and anytime you do get money it's like there's a hole in every pocket in every pair of pants you own. \n\nTataki is one of those places that makes my heart hurt at the sight and sound of it, because I could never afford it if it weren't for a special occasion. And it kinda was the other day, when boyfriend and I had our 1 year \"anniversary\" (we don't actually have a date, just, like, a nebulous realm of time that counts as the anniversary) so we walked to Tataki, and we were the first ones there which always makes me feel stupidly special (but you gotta be sly at this place because it fills up QUICK).\n\nAnyway, it was to die for. We ordered way too much, but that's just the way you gotta roll sometimes. Service was attentive, informative, and unintrusive. We ordered the Mix-It-Up roll (the best ever), the Reggae (vegetarian) roll (fresh, light, crunchy, perfect), the extinguisher (dramatic and superb), some arctic char (it sounds like some super ugly fish but it was so creamy and melty and insane) and katsuo nigiri, baked sanma (like fish jerky, but that's how it was supposed to be), and hot sake and beer. And dammit I thought we had ordered everything good off the menu but looking back at the menu there's about a million other things I want to devour, even dessert, which I never order at Japanese restaurants.

Met up with 2-friends on their recommendation at Tataki last saturday night around 7pm.  We were lucky not to have the long wait experience that most reviewers seem to have had here...probably because people were still out of town during the after-christmas weekend.  It was also 32-degrees, pouring rain, there was a huge bolt of lightning, a loud thunderclap, and the world pretty much looked like it was about to end.  Sort of a sushi armageddon kind of night....\n\nIn fact, I was first to arrive and the waitress said they usually don't sit people until everyone arrives....cue the lightning & thunder.....and she said I should probably sit down and not wait outside.  Great surprise.....cuz most places in any big city have this requirement...but great to see someone free thinking and flexible with the situation.  Sat myself down at a table for 4 and ordered the required edamame and a large sapporo.  The waitress was very good explaining the sake menu, and I ordered a carafe of one called Mu...which was very smooth & good.  My friends showed up 10-minutes later and we started the fish fest.\n\nWe must have hit this place on a fish delivery day, because all of the fish we tried was amazingly fresh and good (a sushi chef told me one time to avoid sundays because the fish will definitely not be as fresh).  We ordered the chef's selection sashimi platter (arctic char, striped bass, shiro maguro, yellowtail toro.)  They were out of the saba which is one of my favorites but had the aji instead which was very good.  \n\nOrdered more sapporo and more sake.....\n\nWent on to the rolls.  The hot potato roll was great, as was the extinguisher and the double-double.  I did have a problem with the extinguisher....the sterno soaked white salt that is on fire when the plate arrives.....in hind sight....definitely don't eat that.\n\nOh yeah....I did not mention the sustainability factor here because other reviews certainly gave enough mention.  But it made the place that much better.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium website has a great sushi section on helping people choose sustainable options.  \n\nAll in all this place turned a stormy night into something great.

Leaving your number in the notes section of the sign-in list does not help either, as they will not call you.  If I could read, I would have known this.  Smooth move, Guy.\n\nTheir food is all sustainably farmed, as we were reminded with every dish that was presented.  I could not taste the difference until they brought out some Faux-nagi, because apparently eels are becoming endangered or something.  Considering unagi is my favorite type of sushi, this was the only thing that bothered me; if they didn't want to become extinct, they shouldn't have made themselves so delicious and easy to catch!  The use or Arctic Char instead of salmon was actually quite nice.  Mind you we dined omakase, so I can't really complain about not getting what I wanted.  The execution of each dish was flawless and beautifully presented.\n\nI recommend trying the sparkling sake, which was unique and delicious.

I'm so in. \n\nI've come to Tataki numerous times since 2009. And this place never disappoints. This place is small, and when I come, I'm usually here with a small group and we have always been accommodated. Great service. \n\nNow if you have never had plum wine, I advise you to get a bottle. This changed my life (no joke) and it's a classic go-to when I'm here. On the menu the Kin-san-gria is also a great choice. Light, but it'll kick you in the ass after a glass. Which are the kind of drinks I like.\n\nNow to the food and sushi. Forget a california roll. Forget tempura. Forget your classic go to's for sushi. Because this place goes above and beyond the call of duty as far as sushi goes, and if you're gonna come here, you might as well indulge in the artistry that is put into making these amazing rolls.\nFor starters I highly recommend the baked mussels or crab croguette. I dont know what is added (i want to say sweet potato) but it makes a world full of difference. These ain't yo mamas crab cakes! If you like tuna and you're watching your figure, you can have the tuna tataki salad which is surprisingly satisfactory in terms of being full after eating. The spicy sauce gives it an extra kick. I love love love the kurodai tataki which is black sea bream, avocados and jalapeno -ponzu sauce. Are you kidding me? And the presentation (on everything) is what really makes this special. The futomaki rolls are very brunchy (is that a word) in terms of taste- eggs, shitake mushroom and spinach. Delish! And the Early Bird roll? Forget about it! \n\nIt's such a treat to come here and I have loved every experience. And I emphasize experience because that's what it truly is. \n\n*Note- last time I came we were told max for card splitting is two.

Tataki is another one of those cute stops.\n\nMy friend brought me here the other day, and as soon as we walked in, I was pretty shocked by how small the place was. It literally houses maybe at most 12 tables, of course all really close to one another (close enough for me to stare at the couple grabbing each others' forearms from across the table and the little girl who positioned her stuffed doggy on the table while she ate). But of course, this is all part of the sf dining experience!\n\nFirstly, I love that the place makes an effort to choose fish whose populations are sustainable. Their mission is to respect the sanctity of the environment! In a place like San Francisco, I am sure this is well-appreciated.\n\nWe ordered the shrimp ceviche, char carpaccio, the tataki roll, and the golden state roll. I'm not a huge fan of asian fusion, so I think it's a bit difficult for me to enjoy sushi that's not plain sashimi or nigiri with a dab of wasabi-soy sauce. \n\nThe char carpaccio came out first, and my friend noted that there was a little informational brochure on the table introducing the fish that they served. Based on taste, I would say that the char has a similar taste to salmon and has a grainy texture towards mackerel, however not as fibrous. Nonetheless, the carpaccio was delicious! They topped each slice with a few capers, which I'm not a huge fan of, but past the capers, the fish itself was lightly flavored and delicate. \n\nI normally only get ceviche at Latin American restaurants, and this was a bit of a disappointment. They mixed the shrimp with tomato, and the tomato was way too overpowering. They served the ceviche on mini fried rice cakes, and though it was really creative, I was bummed I couldn't taste my shrimp. \n\nLastly, the tataki roll and the spicy scallop rolls came out, and I really enjoyed the tataki roll. I can't handle anything too spicy, and the spicy scallop roll was seriously some of the spiciest scallop I've eaten. I was a big fan of the tataki roll - I unconsciously was eating all the pieces until my friend pointed out I was doing so. \n\nTataki is really nice, cute for a date, a bit intimate for dinner with friends, but overall good quality and good service. It is a bit on the pricier side (what sushi place in sf isn't?), but I would definitely like to come back and try some of their other rolls.", "author": "stacy c."}

Perfectly prepared, and tasty - light, but filling.\n\nWe shared the 9 pc chef's choice sashimi for our main course - which looked like your typical order of tuna, hamachi, and salmon.  Instead it was maguro (from yellowfin tuna), Iwana (char), and Suzuki (bass).  The fish was AMAZING.  So colorful and tender and fresh - like jewels from the ocean.  We followed that with the chef's recommendation of Kona Kampachi nigiri, which was buttery delicious.\n\nThere are many other things to try there - rolls, etc.  But I will be back for that sashimi (and uni, when they have it) - and for the wonderful feeling I had when I left knowing that the food had come from responsible sources.

You must know that I LOVE sushi and can seriously eat it everyday if it weren't for my paranoia of consuming too much mercury! :)\n\nThe restaurant:\n- Small and cozy, simple yet well decorated. \n- Sits about 30 - 40 people comfortably. \n- Has a small sushi bar that can sit about 5 people. \n- They don't take reservations but has a list outside. My group of 6 got there around 8:30 and we only had to wait about 5 minutes to get a table.\n\nService:\n- Servers were informative and gave great recommendations.\n- Was a little slow at refilling water and had to constantly ask to get our tea re-filled\n- Food did not take too long and arrived at the table one at a time.\n\nFood:\n- Started with Edamame (cooked just right but had a bit too much salt) and Sweet Potato Croquette (Very Good!!)\n- Sashimi Plates: Great variety of fish ... was very surprised with the scallops which I usually don't like. But they served it here with a slice of lemon and it was delicious! Almost tasted sweet!\n- Tataki Deluxe: Seared fish with complimentary dipping sauces. YUM!\n- Rolls: Good but on the small side.\n\n- The fish was EXCEPTIONAL! FRESH!\n\nNOTE: If going in a group ... they have a 2 card minimum.", "author": "Hiyasmin D."}

So we were impressed that the seafood here is sustainable and they even have a stainable 'guru' on their website to make sure to provide the freshest and guilt-free sushi you can possible eat.  I also read that they were the only sustainable sushi restaurant on the north coast that in itself was impressive.  \n\nThe place was small and quaint nothing too special about the ambience.  So we ordered a lot of sushi since there was quite a few of us so I think I sampled a lot of their sushi personally.  We ordered the chef special and the raw fish was very fresh and smooth tasting.  There were other rolls (including the extinguisher) and nigiri ordered that I don't recall but I was impressed with the fresh taste and enjoyed my food.  We ordered saki as well and it had a nice refreshing taste.  All in all, good for the environment, guilt free and good service. I would definitely go back and recommend the place.", "author": "Eating And Living Well U."}

Without fail, I always ordered it when I dined at a sushi joint.  However, until recently I didn't realize that Blue Fin tuna are endangered.  Overfished to the point of extinction, I now feel irresponsible ordering the highly prized meat from these fish.  The voracity of fishing for these prey, especially for the Japanese sashimi markets, is startling and sad because like many resources we abuse, there is no end in sight.\n\nI came here with a friend on a cool San Francisco evening this winter.  Usually there is a line out the door but since we were only a party of two we were sat at a two-top rather promptly.  I am mostly not a woman of too many details (besides you can get ALL of the details in other posts here no doubt) so I will just say that the sushi was delicious, the sake very pleasing and the service to be warm and frank.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-28", "description": "Unfairly, the review's tempered by the hour-plus wait in chilled SF climes. Yes, I knew beforehand the place is about the size of a hotel restroom. The efficient-but-not-oozing-with-love-for-humanity waitress estimated a 30-minute wait. Of course once you've committed to standing outside for 30 but the minutes keep ticking by, you're going to stick it out, goddammit, and wait for those chatty bastards sucking up real estate even though they've licked the wasabi plate clean. \n\nThe two groups (literally) left out in the cold did get consolation calamari once we were seated, albeit a very small portion--really, more of a \"sorry you had to wait 20 minutes\" size, rather than \"lord almighty, you were deranged enough to stand out there on your birthday for more than an hour, here's a bucket of tentacles.\"\n\nPrice reflects the sustainability of it all, some items better than others. For instance: seafood salad underwhelmed and the citrus sauce overwhelmed the mix-it-up roll (spicy tuna with crab), but golden state (scallop, apple, tuna, avocado) and 49er (lemon with atlantic char) were quite good. Green tea cheesecake and kinako mochi made for good, light finishers. \n\nDefinitely worth going if you're in SF and the wait's not crazy (clue: gauge for yourself how many large groups there are, and if they're the oblivious-to-the-hordes-outside sort), but not to cross the bay. (Equivalent for instance would be Uzen in Rockridge, and just avoid the overfished options, and arguably better would be Kirala.)", "author": "V C."}

All were filling and delicious, and the presentation was lovely.  I was also very pleased with the service, our server, patient in answering our questions, and accommodating of my friend, who happens to be extremely picky with his sushi.\n\nI took advantage of one of their happy hour specials--a sake cocktail, which the name of escapes me, but it was your typical frou frou drink, complete with umbrella and all.  It was decent, just good enough for a sake hit.  As usual, there are also rolls that can be had for less at this time, between 5:30-7 p.m..\n\nPrice-wise, I can see how a meal here can be expensive, but I think they're on par with comparable sushi joints, if not a tad more.  I'm as frugal as it gets, but somehow didn't mind shelling out $30 for dinner.  You're definitely paying for the quality here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-07", "description": "Four of us headed to [url=\"http://www.tatakisushibar.com/\"]Tataki[/url] last evening. This restaurant heralds itself as being 100% sustainable and the offerings are not remotely typical.\n\nBeing the only one drinking to start, I began with their version of a sangria; riesling, sake, and fresh fruit (lychee, Asian pears) which was very refreshing and enticing. The other three had bowls of miso.\n\nWe started with the Baked Sanma (mackerel pike) on skewers with sea salt. These were thin and crunchy and a great start to the meal.\n\nNext came two tataki specials, the seared albacore with garlic sauce and their version of an Arctic Char which was sliced thin and topped with capers and yuzu citrus sauce. The albacore was stunningly tender and although it was offered with a bit of wasabi, the garlic sauce was preferred. I was all over the Arctic Char which reminded me of one of the better crudo offerings at Ame.\n\nWe had a vegetarian in the group so we ordered a number of their veggie offerings (which go WAY beyond your typical cucumber sushi). We had two versions of pumpkin served; a sweet potato roll with mixed vegetable (spinach, egg, gourd, and shiitake mushroom) and the hot potato roll where the sweet potato was tempura and topped with spicy tofuna and sweet sauce. The latter was a bit on the spicy side for me and for some odd reason, reminded me of Mexican food (probably the spice). \n\nWe then also shared a sashimi sampler; tuna, arctic char, amberjack, and albacore. The quality and richness of the fish is remarkable.\n\nIt would have been possible to stop there, but we were enjoying the now-ordered chilled sake and the company, so we ordered two more rolls; the Golden State, a spicy scallop with minced apple topped with albacore tuna, avocado, and 24k gold flakes and a Vegetarian roll, the whole of its ingredients I don't quite remember except that it was topped with thin slices of tomato. I was genuinely impressed with the craftsmanship of the Golden State when I saw the avocado; most often a roll which is topped with avocado it is thick slices. But here the avocado was thinly sliced and fanned -- but this is something one would not normally see as it is topped with the apple. So there is a pride in the work that the chefs take which shows in the quality, plus there is the supremely superior quality of the fish.\n\nSo, all the food, two bottles of sake and one sangria came to about $45 a person; a fabulous bargain considering the quality and quantity of the food. This is a place best shared with friends. I will go back alone, but probably stick to the tataki and sashimi offerings.", "author": "Carolyn T."}

They did, and I'm glad they shared.\n\nThe sashimi deluxe sampler was delivered in an elegantly arranged basket, on top of edible filler.

My friend who's vegetarian was very impressed with all the vegetarian options and loved the sweet potato roll. The rest of us split some of the fishy things and everything was yummy. Prices are comparable to most mid-range sushi places for nigiri ($4-8) and a bit on the high side for rolls ($11-14).

Five different slightly seared sashimi slices (4) with 5 different dipping sauce. It was yummy. We also had some nigri sushi that was good, fresh, but slightly lacking true flavor.  What I really appreciated is that all the sushi and sashimi was room temperature and not chilled. We tried some of their rolls, which barely needed any additional soy sauce. The only thing that bothered me is their sushi rice. It was too dense and didn't match with the delicate pieces of raw fish and seafood. Therefore, the nigri and the rolls felt a little heavy.\n\nThey claim to be a sustainable eatery, but honestly, a sushi place cannot be truly sustainable. Fish imported from Japan, New Zealand, etc. have an inevitable environmental cost. Decorating the Golden State roll with gold flakes is not planet-friendly either. Fortunately, they're going to discontinue the use of those flakes... but luckily, not the roll itself! It was delicious with all the Californian ingredients: scallops, albacore tuna, avocado, and apple.  \n\nOverall everything tasted good, the ambiance was nice, and service was friendly.", "author": "Szilvia H."}

It's moved on to sustain *me,* greedy human that I am.  However, I do like the idea of eating species of fish that aren't over-fished, endangered, or that aren't caught using processes that wreak havoc on miles of ocean floor.\n\nTataki serves only this \"sustainable\" kind of fish, and I can appreciate that.  Their selections are varied, the fish always tastes good.  I like the miso soup & the Chef's choice sashimi (9 healthy pieces) over rice.  Unfortunately, I've only ever been here for lunch when the Extinguisher roll that everyone raves about is not available.  I'm dying to try it - spicy & flaming, sounds great!\n\nThis is a tiny restaurant, so avoid busy times.  It's clean and pleasant, but not exactly cozy and romantic.\n\nEat here.

And it felt good to eat it because I knew that it was sustainable sushi. The fish was really fresh and melts in your mouth. The tataki here is amazing, living up to the name of the place. You can tell they made everything with care, and the plates looked like an art piece.\n\nThe service was good, and the chefs were very nice. The server asked if we wanted another beer, and we said, \"No, we're good.\" and she misunderstood and brought us another one. When we told her, she took it off our bill but gave us the beer anyway, which we ended up giving to the chefs. \n\nThe only downfall was that every sushi restaurant we go to, we ask if they have a natto-maki. When we asked here, they hesitated, probably because they don't get asked this, but made us one anyway. They should have just said they didn't have it. The natto-maki turned out to be something very odd....very dry, and not very natto-like. It was probably sitting in the freezer for a long time. I think the sushi chef knew what he was giving us, so he asked us how it was and we truthfully said, \"um....it tastes kinda dry and funny.\" So he took it back and off our bill, and we got tobiko instead, which was very yummy.", "author": "Emy s."}

As a vegan, when I mention that I like sushi people often stare at me dumbfounded and say \"Wait, how can you eat sushi?!\" Raw slimy fish is only for us omni kids. Then, I have to explain, \"No veggie sushi, silly head.\" Actually, I feel like I get that with every cuisine. \"Wait, you can eat Italian (Mexican, Chinese, Thai, bla) food?! No way!\" And yet, if you look over my reviews all of those cuisines are represented. OK, end of vegan rant. \n\nAnyway, Tataki is one of those awesome sushi places that gives out some good vegan love. It's true if you go to a super authentic place, they like to put fishy sauce or powder in practically everything. It's like salt to them. Anyway, not so at this place. They had a whole separate vegetarian menu, and the waitress did warn me that the miso soup had fish broth in it. Sad day, since I love miso soup, and I especially love the little tiny tofu cubies in it, but it was nice that she knew vegan meant no fish, even in broth form.  \n\nWe ended up ordering the vegan cali roll, the mixed veggie roll and the spicy tofuna roll. The first two were really good and fresh and delicious, but the spicy tofuna was by far the best sushi roll I've had in a long time. It had a vaguely oceany flavor with a spiciness that snuck up on you in just the right way. It's hard to describe, so just do yourself a favor and go eat it now. \n\nAlso, as a side note, being a grumpy vegan I don't usually like to sit at the sushi bar, but I did here and it was totally fine. One, the fish was not smelly at all, and two, the creations that were coming out were amazing and very pretty (that is something you don't hear from me very often, meat is  pretty!?) but the brightly colored roe and carefully assembled rolls, some of which came with some flaming stuff on the side were just, well, pretty! The rainbow colors and careful construction of the sushi definitely makes it seem a lot less like meat and a lot more like little works of art. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place to other veggie peeps who find themselves in Pac Heights or don't mind trekking out there for some delicious tofuna rolls!", "author": "Jeani H."}

The decor is very \"eco\" and I like that they're all sustainable and junk, but that's not enough to make a restaurant successful.  Thankfully they spared us the chips and salsa, although I can't imagine why as it seems that other folks dining the same evening got them.\n\nThe extinguisher roll will clear up any sinus issues and burn the hell out of your lips, so buyer beware.  It was fantastic and we loved it!\nThe hamachi was nice and buttery, the tuna just okay, the veggie roll has romaine lettuce in it (?!), and the tataki we had was the most disappointing thing we ordered.  We even waited the longest for it, since despite reading our order back to us, our waitress still didn't get it quite right and we ended up with the nigiri version rather than the tataki.  If you're going to call your restaurant tataki, your tataki had better be slamming me thinks.  We too noticed the really long wait between courses, but with only one sushi chef, it's to be expected.  Prepare yourselves and order some apps if you're starving.  Bring a beefy bank account too, dinner for two of us (two rolls, 3 orders of nigiri, tataki, beer & sake) was over $70.\n\nSumming it all up:\nService was friendly but slow\nThe idea is a good one\nFood was mediocre and EXPENSIVE\n\nWill I come back?

I definitely support  what they are doing - eating sustainable fish etc. and it's a good place to go if I'm craving sushi and don't want to deal with driving, parking etc., but not a place that I go to when I want damn good sushi that I salivate for.  \n\nI do have to share one other thing that happened during my visit.  I got locked in the bathroom for a good 20 minutes.  It's a single bathroom for the entire restaurant and I guess they had been having issues with the locking mechanism not unlocking and you can get stuck.  I was a little panicky afraid that I would spend the night in a bathroom.  When I finally got out, I was relieved, but  I was just surprised with the response after one of the guys was able to unlock or take the knob off as it was not a big deal.

Creative menu, Gorgeous presentation, very very fresh and tasty, moderate prices, nice atmosphere and good service. I can't complain!

But their focus on details and presentation is so lovely.

First thing you'll notice is that it's very easy to miss if you're driving past it.  Along with that the venue is very small, maybe about 10 small tables and a bar that sits four.  They do not take reservations, but if you arrive around the time they open (5:30pm on Monday), there will be no problem getting a table.\n\nWhat stood out about this sushi place was that it emphasized sustainable fish as one of its competitive advantages.   On every table are little place cards that explain what types of fish are best for the environment and fish population.  The bar also had a small book that went into detail about regions and specific fishing practices; nice little read while you're waiting for your food.\n\nStarted off with 10 pieces of hamachi sashimi.  The presentation was quite nice (5 pieces on a plate, 5 pieces rolled up like a flower in a high-ball glass).  The five pieces that were arranged like pedals differed from the other as they were from the belly of the fish.  Both types were extremely fresh and delectable, but the belly portion was smooth as butter.\n\nWe ordered two other rolls, the Tataki roll which is a cucumber and avocado roll with 5 different types of seared fish blanketed on top and sprinkled with 5 different colors of tobiko.  This is their signature house roll and is a joy to eat.  \n\nThe second roll was the golden state. Spicy scallop and apple inside with albacore tuna, avocado and tobiko on top.  The spicy scallop delivers a nice punch while the apple compliments the taste with a crunchy and tangy flavor.   \n\nBased on the quality of the rolls, the freshness of the fish, the location and venue, I have no choice but to give this place 5 stars.  There was nothing wrong whatsoever.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood and want to give a new sushi place a try, give Tataki a go.", "author": "Serge S."}

It was either Tataki or Koo. I went with Tataki since Koo seemed a little overpriced.\n\nAt first, I was too fond of how small the restaurant is since we had 10 people in our party but gradually I found it very comfortable and quaint. The hostess sat us within 5-10 minutes which was fast! Our waiter was amazing! The whole time he catered to our needs with a smile on his face. We were on time for happy hour, which ends at 7pm. Sangria's were oh so delicious! For $4ish, it wasn't so bad. The lychee and strawberries were most definitely marinated in alcohol. More alcohol in the fruit than the drink itself. We also ordered a few sake bombs that were at a reasonable price. We ordered probably 4 or 5 orders of calamari and mussels. Which were also $4.50 for happy hour.\n\nAs for our sushi, it was so delicious. We ordered:\nGreen Dragon\n49'er\nDouble double\nEarly Bird\nGolden State\n\nThe 49'er was definitely a treat! The sushi melts in your mouth! I would describe each sushi but that would take too long :] So check out the dinner menu!  We even ordered each sushi maybe twice or three times. Yes, it was that good. Very fresh and delicate to the max! \n\nAs for the dessert, I brought rum cake from Dianda's Italian-American Bakery in the Mission of S.F. My friend told me to be careful since they may charge me for cutting up the cake. So, after the birthday song, they took it to the back to cut it up. it took a long time however we didn't mind :] They sliced strawberries and placed strawberry syrup for each individual slice for a beautiful decor FOR NO ADDITIONAL COST! We were all very impressed. So I asked the waiter to also take a piece :]\n\nThe bill came out to be around $350 including sales tax and 18% gratuity. IT WAS WELL WORTH IT!\n\nThis place is great! Thank you Tataki for a very pleasant experience.\n\nBTW, the restroom is spotless! I usually rate the cleanliness of the restaurant by its restrooms. And it was IMPRESSIVE!", "author": "Liezel D."}

If you are also a fan of salmon, you maybe surprised to not see salmon on the menu.  Instead of salmon, Tataki offers Arctic Char.  In appearance, the Arctic char looked very similar to salmon but its taste was a little different.  I ordered the Arctic char nigiri and an Arctic char roll. At this point I think I still prefer salmon but I would order the Arctic char again.  I enjoyed my Arctic char nigiri and roll.\n\nTo get more of an understanding of Arctic Char, I have posted some information from one of my two reliable news sources, Wikipedia.com (AOL News is the other in case your wondering).  According to Wikipedia.com, \"Arctic Char is both a freshwater and saltwater fish in the Salmonidae family, native to Arctic, sub-Arctic and alpine lakes and coastal waters.  In Siberia, it is known as golets.  The Arctic char is closely related to both salmon and trout and has many characteristics of both.\" \n\nBesides trying a different type of fish, there are other reasons to try Tataki.  As my close friends will tell you,  I like entering and greeting new restaurants as if I'm the mayor welcoming a place to the neighborhood.  If the new restaurant's staff is friendly, there is a good chance I'll be back and recommend to other people. Though I just ordered two small items, the staff welcomed me; thanked me for trying and offered me some tea while I was waiting for my sushi to be prepared.  It was great service!\n\nAnother reason to try Tataki is the ambiance inside the place.  Tataki is stylishly decorated and perfect for a group of two or four.  If you ever went to the Subway that was previously in the space now occupied by Tataki, you'll be pleasantly surprised at what a good job Tataki did with the small space.", "author": "Josh K."}

It was a small place, but the lighting and seating was just right for an intimate dinner date. Whether it be with a small group of friends, or an evening for two, this is the place to be! Note: it's not meant to be a dressy restaurant, but we didn't feel out of place in our fancy attire [not like tux and red carpet dress, just not jeans and a skirt with flip flops]\n\nOur first reaction was just with the atmosphere...the food was a whole other story.\n\nThe sushi here is fresh and tastes great. The menu wasn't extensive, but considering I'm super indecisive, that was probably for the best. Also, the items they had on the menu (what we had) were fantastic! The Tatori Specialty roll was great, lots of fresh tender fish accompanied with cucumber and avocado. Yumm!\n\nSomething that surprised us, was that the Miso Soup was incredible. It sounds really weird to be praising Miso Soup so much...but it was definitely the best we've EVER had. Not like the bland side dish soup you get with maybe one piece of tofu, this was flavorful and had large pieces of seaweed and just enough tofu!\n\nAs for dessert, we splurged a bit and tried both desserts. The jello coffee? Great for coffee-lovers, but for us, the texture was too weird. We couldn't get through the whole dish, but if we had a third or fourth, we probably could have. It was just the texture of the dessert that held us back--it tasted great, but squishy coffee chunks? Hmm...\n\nThe green tea cheesecake was great! Usually, for me, cheesecake is too sweet, but this was a pleasant balance. Just a note: the green tea flavor is very subtle. \n\nIt was a wonderful evening!

The fish itself was just OK - the fish had a strange bitter aftertaste and it was a bit dry. And the ebi was tough, chewy, and limp (ick). Koo's fish, in comparison, was moist, plump, and sweet. Maybe the rolls here might be what people come for since many people commented on it, but I judge a sushi place based on the quality and selection of fish. \n\nAnd I laughed when I read the comment about the dull wasabi color - bright green artificial powder is preferred?

Though the place is certainly small, it's sleek and well designed, both in term of lay-out and decor. The menu is great: concise- highlights what they do best (sometimes I don't even know where to begin with dauntingly long sushi menus), hits all the \"favorites\" that you'd expect from an SF sushi bar with some original flair thrown in, and for a reasonable price. The rolls them self were fresh and simple, with the quality and flavor of the fish not hidden under snazzy, bling bling ingredients. \n\nThe meal didn't blow my skirt up (although the (literally) flaming \"extinguisher\" role was a dramatic touch), and the service was nothing worth noting. However, I get the impression that Tataki is consistent in quality and in taking good care of their customers- both things that are key for a local spot.

Their philosophy on serving sustainable sushi is incredibly appealing and very rare amongst SF sushi bars. Most sushi lovers tend to appreciate a wide variety of fresh fish but forget the fact that salmon, for example, isn't in season year round and therefore is creating an exhausting demand for the diminishing supply. Tataki's eco-conscious menu also delivers in quality and taste.\n\nThe sashimi was extremely fresh and nicely cut. It included arctic char, maguro and a few other chef's choices I can't recall. The beef carpaccio wasn't my favorite, but pretty tasty nonetheless. I was excited to see they had a sake menu which included a few of my favorites to compliment the delicious menu. I usually go for more simple traditional sushi, without all the fat rolls packed with cream cheese and mangoes, but I had to give their Extinguisher roll a try. (Yes, it was served with a flame) The presentation was clean and creative and the roll itself included a mildly spicy amberjack topped with avocado and masago with a spicy sauce. Simple and delicious! \n\nFor desert, I ordered the green tea cheesecake and sparkling sake. Great finish to an amazing meal. Even though the sake and drinks ran up the bill, overall the quality was definitely worth the price.\n\nAlso, the service was the best I've had in quite a while. Our waitress was friendly and timely, despite the fact that it was a busy start to the night. Great service is hard to come by, and having worked as a server myself, I truly appreciate someone who cares for their customers.\n\nGreat little sushi bar with a yummy menu and sake to pair.

So I cannot completely say that this is the best restaurant to go to. \n\nMy friends and I ordered a huge variety of Sushi for New Year's Eve. For the vegetarians (myself included) we ordered:\n\nratatouille roll (fried eggplant, carrot, zucchini, bell pepper, tempura, topped with minced garlic)\n\nreggae roll (asparagus tempura, cucumber, topped with avocado, tomato and shaved pumpkin)\n\nhot potato roll (sweet potato tempura topped with spicy\ntofuna and sweet sauce)\n\nAll three of these were AMAZING, these are their specialty rolls and are so good. I could not get enough of them. \n\nMy favorite was the Hot Potato Roll. Typically when I have sushi, I LOVE dunking it into my soysauce/wasabi mixture, but these rolls were so good, I felt I did not even need my fantastic mixture of soysauce/wasabi. \n\nThis place did a great job on take out, pricey yes, BUT I think it's worth it.", "author": "Parijat T."}

I had no idea what that meant but thanks to the little phamplet they give you, you get to learn exactly what that means. In a nutshell, you can eat sushi without feeling gulity. I LOVE spicy food so I  tried the spicy crunchy tuna(made with yellow fin instead of the diminishing blue fin tuna),arctic char  roll, and my absolute favorite- the extinguisher. The name says it all, you will need one after eating these rolls of spicy goodness. The best part aside from the taste? They bring the roll with a FIRE going next to it. When do you see sushi rolls on the same plate as fire? The food is awesome, happy hour specials are really good.

It's a tiny place so expect to wait if you come in with a large group (45 minutes for our group of 7). We also happened upon one of the best things I've heard, a happy hour for a sushi bar that extends into Saturday. That's a double bonus! It goes from 5:30-7, 5-7 on the weekend.\n\nI couldn't resist taking advantage of their happy hour so I grabbed a crunchy CA and arctic char with avocado roll, which came in at 4.50. (Hand roll versions are 3, a bit smaller). That alone was actually enough for a dinner, but I felt like I had to sample some of their regular priced wares and I went for a chef's choice of 5 piece nigiri, all of which tasted fantastic. One of my friends also went for the aptly named Extinguisher Roll, which came to our table ablazing. A nice little touch for those who are more adventurous.\n\nNeedless to say I like this place I lot. The happy hour prices are fantastic (it gets crowded so get in early so you aren't forced to wait until it's over) and their sushi tastes great. In addition, the place is very much into sustainable seafood, so you won't feel bad environment-wise either eating here.

I eat sushi for quality and quantity not for the aesthetic beauty. Go to Muir woods or the Japanese gardens for that.

Duh.\n\nSo when you walk in, there are Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood/Sushi watch cards all over the place,  for people to look at while eating and take with them when they leave. It tells you which types of sushi are better on the world and on your body. YAY!!!!!!!\n\nI had the \"extinguisher\" and can be a bit of wimp with super spicy stuff- even though i really like a bit of spice on my food. It was perfect. It came to table with part of the plate on fire. That was rad. Then we had the Sashimi Taster- and everything on it was delicious! We also had this thing with scallops and apples- I wasn't a big fan but my dinner date loved loved loved it. As I am new to raw sushi- I just put it as me learning what I like and don't like. I like spicy and could skip the sweet. oooooohhhh---- the extinguisher. I could have eaten that all night. \n\nOther than all the WONDERFUL WONDERFUL things i feel and think about this place- there was only one reason I would ever go to another sushi place again. Unfortunately, because of their limitations on what kinds of fish they can serve responsibly - their menu is also relatively limited. It is very important to me to be responsible in my choices about where my food comes from- so this place is definitely going to be on my must go back and often  list.", "author": "Jill S."}

He and I are definitely sushi aficionados having started at a young age and always been willing to spend for the best. So, after years of the same generic salmon, yellowtail, hamachi, ebi, tombiko, mackerel, combinations I was excited about trying some different fish that was sustainable. \n\nWe arrived for the Happy hour ordered: the two specials, (halibut and fatty albacore),  then off the happy hour menu a veggie roll, spicy tuna roll, and the artic char roll.\n\nEverything was really good and fresh! Especially the specials!! It was so fresh that it had the crisp, but melty quality that is difficult to achieve. The veggie roll was ordered as a filler roll, but was light and tasty. The artic chard was more of a typical salmon, avocado roll that was standard, but guilt-free! The crunchy spicy tuna isn't something i would normally get because I try to avoid tempura at all cost,  but it turned out to be one of my favorites, since it wasn't oily and seemed to form a symbiotic relationship with the tuna.  By far the Nigiri specials were the best! \n\nFor dessert we shared the coffee jello with Kahula--soooo good!! To top it all off we also ordered some unfiltered sake and some beer very reasonably priced. \n\nWe escaped with about a $50 dollar bill for the two of us. So reasonable!\n\nwhat really placed this place above others was the clean/modern atmosphere, kind people and good service.An additional plus is that everything that everyone else in the room was ordering looked really good too!

The mixed vegetable salad was huge, with asparagus, orange cherry tomatoes, carrot, and cucumber, along with a generous pile of roasted cashews and an apple dressing quite unlike anything I've ever tasted before. \n\nI ordered the futomaki and the spicy tofuna roll. The futomaki was very good, and the spicy tofuna roll was terrific. It's cucumber and tofu mixed with something (spicy vegan mayo, I believe, but I can't swear it was vegan) that really made it taste fantastic. I sat at the sushi bar by myself and the sushi chefs were attentive and charming and took the time to answer all my questions. I also asked them to recommend the best fish for a single order of nigiri and they gave me two pieces of kampachi that were buttery-soft and fresh, over some of the best sushi rice I've had in this town.\n\nTheir other veggie rolls sound creative and delicious, a real boon for vegetarians who like creative, US-style rolls filled with goodies but are normally confined to futomaki alone for their fix. Unfortunately, most of the other rolls contained various tempura'd veggies, and, since they prepare their veggie tempura in the same oil as their tempura shrimp, and I'm allergic to shrimp, I wasn't able to try any of them.  \n\nI love that they are committed to sustainability. It's high time a sushi place focused on this, since the global fish situation is getting dire. The one drawback was that there was a large party there, and the small restaurant quickly got very loud. But the waitress seemed as annoyed/amused as I was by how loud it was, and struggled her way through the crowd to refill my tea again and again, so I really have no complaints. \n\nThe other thing bummer is they have a delicious sounding coffee jello with kahlua cream for dessert, but they make it with actual gelatin jello! The Japanese are the masters of making jelly-desserts using seaweeds and rice - it's too bad they couldn't make this in a vegetarian version.

The service, professional: attentive without being intrusive, with each order somehow arriving just after the last one was finished.\n\nThe evening's menu looked like this:\n\nChef's choice sashimi (12 pc) ($19)\nMix-it-up ($11)\nGolden State ($15)\nUni ($8)\nAji ($6.5)\nShiro Maguro ($5)\nEbi ($5.5)\nHotate ($6)\nDivisadero Roll with tuna ($6.5)\nLarge Sapporo ($6.5)\nSparkling sake (gratis on account of my companion's birthday)\n\n$105 for two bellies full of sustainably-caught, impossibly fresh, insanely tasty fish? Oh yes. I will be back.\n\nThe space is very small (and humid -- a bit of ventilation would have been nice), with only four seats at the bar, maybe seven two-tops and probably another two or three four-tops.The lighting is soft and the music is cool: the perfect ambiance for devouring the magnificence of Tataki's wares. We waited only five minutes on a Saturday at 8 PM. But in hindsight, I would have been willing to wait an hour. Or two.\n\nI literally dreamed about Tataki that night.", "author": "David B."}

I dropped in here last night excited to check it out as it has only been open since Tuesday. I was going to get a few things to go since I was by myself, but there was a seat in the corner and the sushi bar and I figured why not...I'll get the full experience so I can decide if I love it or hate it. \n\nI agree with the other reviews - the tortilla chips and ceviche/shrimp salsa/whatever is a little strange, but interesting nonetheless. But the fish is outstanding. Whenever I check out a new sushi place, I usually de-virginize my experience by ordering only nigiri on the first visit. Anyone can make a decent roll if you put enough stuff in it, but if the fish isn't fresh the place isn't worth it.\n\nTataki is definitely worth it.\n\nI asked the sushi chef for a few recommendations and all were excellent. The albacore was melt-in-your-mouth fresh with just a tad of garlic sauce on top. He gave me a hamachi/kampachi combo order and explained the difference - both great with a preference towards the hamachi (a little softer). Arctic char was another recommendation - similar to salmon but darker and less oily - really fresh. I asked about the aji, which he said was on the stronger side of fishy, so he gave me one piece to let me try it out. He was right - it was still good and fresh, but not my favorite. I had more albacore!\n\nThey have some really interesting specialties - a lot of tataki (go figure) and the rolls sound really yummy (esp. the extinguisher if you like spicy) so I look forward to checking them out next time.\n\nThe sushi chef is really friendly, the service was decent (could have been a little better but it's only been three days!) and the atmosphere is relaxing...very zen...but the place is pretty small. Only about 20 seats and another 4 at the sushi bar.\n\nTataki is a great addition to Pac Heights and a totally different (and better but more expensive) experience than Osaka, Godzila, Toraya, etc...", "author": "Kate S."}

The place is tiny, with only 2 sushi chefs and 2 servers. Luckily we were seated right away, but it was a looooong time in between plates. Good if you are with company you like and like to throw back a few cocktails in between, but if you have somewhere to be (as we did), it can be a little bit frustrating when it takes almost 2 hours to get your 5 plates.. \n\nAnyhoo, you must get the Kin-San-Gria! It's made with Riesling and sake, and soooo delicious! Has apples, strawberries, and lychees - you can't even taste the alcohol, it tastes just like juice! Had driving not been in the picture, I would've had a few more of these! \n\nStarted with the Tuna Tataki which is seared yellowfin tuna with tataki sauce. They serve it with a LOT of fried garlic flakes. I don't know about you, but too much garlic wreaks havoc on my (usually) iron stomach, so I scraped most of mine off. I must say though, you didn't get a whole lot for your money ($13). I guess you pay to have a cleaner conscience? \n\nFifteen minutes later, we got the Mix-It-Up, which is a roll with spicy tuna, crab meat, and avocado citrus sauce. Pretty damn tasty. A little spicy, but not too bad. \n\nAnother 15 minutes later, we get the 49er and the Early Bird rolls. The 49er roll is how I define if a place is good or not. This one was okay. They make theirs with arctic char, which is similar to salmon (what most people use). I don't know if it was the fish or the roe, but it was a little fishy.. The Early Bird was a success. But how can you go wrong when there's filet mignon on your sushi?!.. Rolls are pretty big too. \n\nLast on the list was the faux-nagi nigiri (black cod), which we had to remind our waitress to get. Ten minutes later it came out. It was okay. They charred it, but you could really taste it, which I wasn't too into. Other than that, it tasted a lot like butterfish or waloo. \n\nAll in all, it was good, but not great. Would have been better had the service been faster, but what can you do?", "author": "Vera H."}

The place is small, but warm and cozy, even though it was small we didn't feel like we were rubbing elbows with other tables. \n\nFor drinks to start, I ordered the House Sake and she ordered the sake-sangria special. Hers was much better! They used fresh fruit and it was very flavorful. The House Sake was just...House sake. \n\nFor appetizer we got Fried calamari. This was one of the best I've ever had. It was light, crispy and not overly salty like some other places. The sauce that came with it was also very good, I'd describe it as a cross between thousand island and spicy mustard sauce. +1 for the Fried Calamari. \n\nThe Sushi: We got the spicy shrimp tempura roll and a Early Bird Roll. The Spicy tempura was good, and quite spicy the way I had hoped. It is spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, a jalapeno slice and some vegetables. I liked it alot, but I probably would not get it again, mainly because as good as it is, it was nothing special.\n\nThe Early Bird roll was much better! seared Fillet Mignon with avacado and fresh pineapple. It doesn't sound like it would work, but it did. The fillet Mignon was soft but not mushy, and was seared perfectly ( cooked on the outside, pretty rare on the inside)  The meat seemed to melt in our mouths. Best Sushi roll we've had in awhile!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-08", "description": "I would have easily given it 4 stars, but unfortunately, this place has been \"discovered\", which immediately has put it in the overrated list. This little, cozy restaurant was a real gem - fresh sushi, quiet location, simple but inventive menu. \n\nThen the crowds arrived. Now, any time you drive by, there's a crowd outside - a sure sign of an overhyped SF eatery, such as Burma Superstar or Pork Store Cafe. So, it's time to expose Tataki's few but noticeable drawbacks. \nFirst, the place is tiny, so if you bring a date here, be prepared to share your conversation with neighbours to your left and to your right. There's barely a space between the miniature tables for the waitress to squeeze by. \nSecond, the staff is, well, not very Japanese. Waiting staff is just plain boring American, and the chefs are, I believe Chinese, although I could be mistaken. And to be honest, I am tired of Chinese and Korean owned sushi restaurants in San Francisco. I mean, it's not like opening another Chow Fun take out. \nFinally, even though the quality of fish is generally good, there's just a tad much focus on its sustainability rather than taste. I don't really want a lecture on fish ecology during a sushi dinner. \nBut overall, it really is too bad this place has become more popular than it can handle to be.", "author": "Evg R."}

Good fresh fish is expensive, so we understand why good sushi will never be cheap.   We were delighted when Tataki opened up on California St, only two blocks from our house.   We've eaten there a few times, and although crowded, the sushi is good.  Rolls vary from good to ordinary.   We order takeout from them often and have always been happy with it.\n\nLat night (Sunday, 5/26) we took a friend to eat at Tataki.   The music was very loud, with an overwhelming beat.   It was nearly impossible to talk without shouting.   We asked the waitress if she could turn down the music, and she gave us a strange, not very welcoming look.   But she did turn down the music a bit.   A few minutes later it seemed to get louder again, so we asked one of the guys behind the counter if he could either change the music to something less jarring or turn it down.   He seemed surprised, but did turn it down somewhat.   The music, at any level, was not at all relaxing.    It seems likely that this is no accident.   Loud, discordant music, can cause tables to turn over more quickly.   So the bad tude and the loud music kills it for us for an eat in.   Will still get their takeout, but sure won't be eating there again.   None of the owners were there Sunday, so not sure if it is the staff's preference or the owners' orders for loud music.  Why does a small restaurant even play music?    Are the owners acting out their aggression?", "author": "Ian B."}

So my boyfriend and I showed up tonight at about 5:45 and dutifully added our name to the wait list (all names above ours were crossed off, as though already seated).  After a ten minute wait, a table opened up that we thought would/should be ours.  But no....they gave it to a couple that appeared a few minutes before being seated and who were clearly well known 'regulars.'. Strike one.  An additional ten minutes later, we are finally seated.  We order the extinguisher and \"crunchy\" spice tuna roll.  They come fairly quickly, although each separated by at least five minutes (serving us at different times).  They are \"okay,\" but know that their crunchy spicy tuna roll is NOT tempura battered...they have 'tempura flakes' only.  The extinguisher had some spice, but was pretty mild by my standards.  The sushi, for it's prices and the wait, was mediocre at best.  I've had far larger portions and much more tasty sushi in San Luis Obispo county.  Strike two.  Not feeling full so far, we ordered a spicy tempura roll.  After waiting twenty minutes (without food or even a check in or apology by the waitress), we ask for our bill.  She says, \"we're slicing your roll now.\". We say, no, we'd like the check.  Still no apology.  Strike three.  I would expect better from a San Francisco establishment, but now know I will get FAR better in my home territory.  This place is just a bunch of hype.  I won't be back.", "author": "Lisa S."}

Since it was after 6, parking was free and about 50 feet from the restaurant. We walked up and it was extremely small and every table was filled. If driving on the rode, you wouldn't even notice the restaurant. Since it was so small, I felt hesitant but my boyfriend put our name on the waiting list while I used the bathroom. The bathroom was very clean but a challenge to get to considering the small space between tables. I looked for other sushi places near by and then our name was called. I decided to give the place a chance and I'm so happy I did!! We had a delicious experience! We got the rainbow roll, the golden state, the extinguisher, the baked mussels for an appetizer, and a glass of Chardonnay. The mussels were wonderful. My boyfriend did find a very small crab (dead and cooked) which must of made residence in the mussel. It did not gross me out because it reflected the freshness of the mussels but he said the crab was hard and if he had bitten it, it could have hurt his teeth. The Chardonnay was quite tasty and the waiter was very helpful in helping me select the right wine. All of our rolls were fantastic. The golden state have apple in it which I was very skeptical about but it was AMAZING. They flavor their tobiko in different things such as habanero and yuzu which adds for a wonderful decoration and taste. The price was pretty food for SF, nothing over the top or very cheap. The extinguisher is their most popular roll and once you taste it, you know why-it has quite a kick and comes with a side of FIRE. I kid you not, they bring the plate to you and it has fire on it. A truly unique decoration I doubt I will see anywhere else. The only thing about this experience that I was not the biggest fan of was how the waiter always seemed so surprised and perhaps even judgmental when we ordered all of the food we did.

They have a great theme going on in regards to their attention to the environmental commitment.  They only use fish caught using fishing methods that does not harm the environment.  I thought that it was pretty cool although it means that they don't have the more common fish found in other sushi restaurants.  \nOn the downside, their dessert menu is VERY limited.

The restaurant has a limited amount of seating, nestled in a small, quite neighborhood. Waited approximately 10 minds to be seated. Service was moderate, there was only one server for the entire restaurant, and two sushi chefs. We ordered the Tataki special..? Can't remember the name of the dish.... blame it on the alchohol... it was 4 pieces of 5 different fishes served with their own designated sauces to compliment the fish. It was good, I was starving and I ate everything, minus the leaf the fish was sitting on two seconds earlier. For good measure we ordered a roll called the extinguisher. The salt on the plate was on fire.... I missed it... oh well, a picture will suffice. It was good, but not great... We were still hungry so we ordered another roll... This one was deep friend with tempura in it. It was good, but not great. To be honest, I found that was my opinion for the entire restaurant. Good, but not great. I've tried a good amount of sea food and sushi in my life. I liked how small and quaint it was however the food didn't hold up for me.", "author": "JJ O."}

Had dinner here last night, August 15 and have been before so i was aware of the lack of tables due to size of restaurant which is fine but the way they handle the waiting list is retarded.  We didnt want to take up space at doorway and creepishly stare at people while they enjoy their sushi so we sat down at Bistro SF next door for a glass of wine. I got up to check where they were on the list every 3 sips of wine so we wouldnt miss our turn.  Finally, I noticed they had crossed off/sat the person above us on list so I thought yay we are next. I went up to the hostess chick to let her know we are next door closing our tab and we are ready to be seated.  When we came back 3 minutes later she sat people at our table! All she could say, very rudely \"well you werent standing here\". Um excuse me but you either suffer from memory loss or pure stupidity because I just spoke to you 2 minutes ago.  All she could say is \"well you should have been standing here.\" We waited 30 minutes patiently for a table, stayed out of their way but checked back every five minutes.  What a rude place.

The track lighting above was modern and tasteful and the bathroom was alarmingly cool with tiled walls and a stylish square sink. \n\nWhile I'm not an environmental activist, it was refreshing to discover that Tataki supports sustainable-sourced seafood. An enlightening  pamphlet on the table, sponsored by the Monterey Bay Aquarium, informed us which seafood to avoid. \n\nThe calamari, lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and served with an unique dipping sauce, was the perfect appetizer. For the main course we ordered the Reggae roll (warm asparagus tempura, avocado and pumpkin), Philadelphia roll, and Tuna roll with avocado and masago.

I hopped on Yelp in search of the perfect meal that that would give me tingles when I were to reminisce of that night.\n\nI find Tataki.\n\nWhat I loved about Tataki:\n- There's Bamboo everywhere. Why is this important, you ask? Because it's a Japanese restaurant that tauts itself as being in support of sustainable fish. In the meantime, they also seem to be in full support of sustainable materials in general, because bamboo grows like wildfire. I can appreciate that. \n- I went to the bathroom first. I LOVE THE BATHROOM. You know how you can tell that a restaurant puts thought into the design of their space by how lovely the bathroom is? Yeah well whoever put this tiny retreat together did a fine job. I love the sink. Love how the tiles glisten depending on your vantage like they are abalone shells.\n- The whole sustainable fish idea is pretty cool. Sustainable fish is generally farm-raised. Every table has information on what fish are good to eat and which to avoid.\n- Sake list is pretty extensive and surprisingly well-priced. You can definitely stretch your dollar there when it comes to liquor consumption.\n- Uni was AMAZING last night... if you are looking for that perfect moment to introduce your palate to the greatness that is a wonderful bite of fresh Uni, here and now are the place and time. Santa Barbara Uni. I'll have to remember that... there is a wonderful caramel sweetness about good uni. Uber Yum.\n- Preparation was thoughtful. We didn't eat a lot, but we did eat enough Nigiri to know that the chef put thought into the aesthetics of each cut. \n- Definitely get yourself some Hotate. Scallops were some of the better I've ever had... anywhere.\n- They serve you cucumber infused ice water. mm..\n- General ambiance: fantastic. Very friendly staff, great recommendations, gave you the space you needed and weren't overly pushy on turning tables (maybe because it wasn't full).\n- They played great music. \n\nWhat I didn't particularly enjoy about Tataki:\n- Wasn't a big fan of the wasabi they offered. It was dry and brittle.\n- The sake bottle was glass and had that hole for ice... great idea but it drips everywhere when you touch the thing. I would have preferred another bottle.\n- The more expensive sakes seemed to have more thoughtful descriptions. I just thought that was interesting.\n- General variety of fish offered was not as great as other restaurants. This could be both good and bad I suppose... I guess when you know what you are good at you stick with it?\n\nOverall, I will definitely be back. I really enjoyed the experience.", "author": "Annie T."}

I had not read the review yet, but as she described it it was full of hate and anger. Her description was accurate.\n\nNobu K. should get his facts straight. He claims that the chefs are not trained, and that is flat out wrong. Although they may be from Hong Kong, they are formally trained.\n\nThe sushi is excellent. The service is friendly. The atmosphere is modern and intimate. I could care less if they serve me cold water, even if that is not customary in Japan. \n\nThis is probably not a traditional sushi restaurant, but I don't know that it claims to be completely traditional. There is a huge variety of sushi restaurants in San Francisco, and they all have their place. These guys are doing a great job bringing sustainability to sushi, and they should be commended for that.\n\nClearly Nobu K. is pretty much alone in his review. Almost all other reviewers give Tataki increadibly high marks. If you click on the link Nobu K. provides of his other reviews of sushi restaurants, you can see that he is a very hateful person.

I have carried around a Sustainable Seafood Watch card for many years now, but it is very unpractical to use it, especially at a Japanese Restaurant.  How many times are you going to make a waitress run back and find out if your salmon was farmed or from Washington or from somewhere else!? So the fact that they make all the sustainable choices for you is amazing.  \nHowever, we had to wait almost 1 hour for rolls (we were already seated!!) that weren't even that tasty!! Also, the price was a little too high, especially for the measely amount of fish they serve.  \nSo, 1 star knocked off for super duper crazy slow service and 1 more knocked off for the rolls being kinda blah.", "author": "Jacqueline T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-05-09", "description": "I am not usually compelled to ever write reviews, but my group's experience at Tataki was disappointing enough to finally write one.  There were five of us in our party so the 25 minute wait was expected and not a problem. What was a problem was waiting that long for a table big enough for five and then being given a table that was only for four.  I didn't think that was going to be a problem since the fifth person could have just sat on the end. That lasted half a minute before we were told to get out of the server's way and squeeze three people on to one side of this very small table.  Apparently that still wasn't good enough so the other server kicked my chair as she passed.  Instead of receiving an apology she stared me down and made sure I knew our five-person group was an inconvenience. I don't know if she was having a bad day or not but she definitely made us not have an enjoyable experience. \n\nI realize service can be hit or miss at many restaurants so I will say that the food was good and the concept was interesting.  I definitely have never eaten sushi while listening to the Notorious B.I.G. If SF wasn't such a big city with so many restaurants to choose from I might be compelled to give them a second try, but too bad for them that isn't the case.", "author": "Erik Z."}

Unfortunately I failed.\n\nAfter ordering drinks I felt my stomach sink like a rock.  Our waitress mentioned in her sermon on sustainability that they wouldn't be serving yellowtail, salmon or eel.  I've been to Catholic churches so I'm familiar with religions requiring abstinence.  Yet, this felt like the equivalent of In-And-Out Burger deciding not to carry hamburger, fries, ketchup and buns.  She'd prohibited my order in total and I felt like a dirty enviro-sinner.\n\nLuckily there was still chance for redemption.   She went on to mention that I could order their \"sustainable\" alternatives for the salmon and yellowtail.  I started to wonder if these alternatives would be \"sustainable\" if all sushi shops used them, but was distracted by feelings of benevolence and acceptance.\n\nThe miso soup came first.  It clearly had too little salt and no fish stock, I'm guessing to keep vegetarians happy.  Sorry vegetarians, Japanese food is not meant for you.  The rolls themselves weren't bad, but they were all spicy which is often the mark of a Korean sushi chef.   The fish were very watery, appearing to have been frozen.  They also forgot the \"sushi\" in \"sushi rice\", there was no taste of vinegar.\n\nThe decor was very soothing and the staff was very welcoming.  I would say that the service was very good but I kept feeling a bit like I was dining in the center of a \"Stress Test\" encampment.  On the way out they even tried to force some sustainability pamphlets on me--no thanks Environmentologists!\n\nIf you're thinking of eating here for good sushi please look at the number of 3 and 4 star reviews that give bonus stars for \"sustainability\" or being \"eco-friendly\".", "author": "David R."}

The roll is composed of spicy amberjack topped with avocado, habanero masago, and hot sauce. The plate included about 8 pieces, which was filling enough for me, and featured a small dune of lemon salt set ablaze. Yes, there was fire on the plate.

The food to note is nothing too crazy nor out of the ordinary, however, let me say this the quality of the fish is pretty amazing. Tataki's major marketing point of focus is the use of sustainable seafood that provides an alternative to your usual seafood selections that the \"other\" places usually do not prefer to give piece of mind to. This sustainability not only helps with the prevention of over farming in certain areas of the world that is causing harm to the local eco-system. Now let me tell you, i'm not a rookie sushi go-er i'm actually quite the fanatic and i hold japanese food and sushi very close to my heart and It could just be me, personally, but somehow it seems like the quality and taste of the fish here is simply heavenly (maybe i just came in on a good day right after purchase but HEY who knows!)

From a very true perspective, if you do NOT go here, you are out of your mind.  My wife, of 48 hours now,  found this true gem right here on Yelp.  Reading the reviews something did not add up, but it was intriguing.  How can you have 4 1/2 stars with a low $$ rating and serve top quality sushi?  Let me tell you how.  After reading the menu, I had to ask our incredibly knowledgable server Gretchen \" I see everything on the menu is either line caught or totally sustainable.  How in the world can you do this at this price point?\"  Without going into detail, our conversation summed up to this....a true love and belief in the food, technique and seasonality without making you think that what you are paying for or about to experience is going to make you feel like you just gave up your savings or money market account.\nFrom the unique baked mussels, the sparking, yes sparking, Sake, to the incredible green tea cheesecake, there was not a moment where we did not look at each other and just know that we were experiencing something extremely special.\nEvery person in this very comfortable, very quaint location believed and UNDERSTOOD exactly what they were creating and serving.  Each dish was so different, so bright in their flavors that we found ourselves looking at the menu asking \"OK, what next?\"  Because we had so many courses we could not try everthing but we did the next best thing, we looked at the menu and discussed what we would have next time we returned.  It was that special.\nService was fantastic.  Beyond knowledgable, very attentive.  The chefs and owners (one in the same) work behind a small 4 seat sushi bar and create beautiful and intriguing dishes.\nWe will be back many times.

I've also had several rolls and other menu items.  The food at this restaurant is put together with thought.  I love it!  \n\nThe service is friendly and fast, yet timed nicely... at dinner with my fiance, we ordered several items and everything came out slowly enough that we could enjoy one dish before another was set down on the table (not the norm at other neighborhood sushi restaurants).  I agree with other yelpers mentioning great ambiance... this tiny restaurant used to be a Subway?  You would never know -- the interior is so cozy, yet not cramped.  \n\nOne review mentions speed, and at this point there are 2 sushi chefs working at a time as well as a few servers.  Nothing was slow, and all tables (except one) were full.

To spell it out for you, that means that they are paying more, and putting in more effort to bring us the freshest, yummiest, and most environmentally friendly fish out there!  How great is that!?

Love what they're doing as far as sustainable fish. Easy place to walk in, at this point anyway, and on a weeknight at least, and easily get a table for a last-minute dinner out. Thought the fish tasted really fresh, the extinguisher roll was fun since the plate came out on fire, and the sake was good. Pricing seemed reasonable enough for fresh fish. The restaurant could do to (1) dim their lighting a bit - at 10pm it felt like broad daylight! and (2) improve their service. We had to flag people down to order more and to get the bill. Nothing phenomenal but a good addition to the hood with good food ethics.", "author": "Sarah R."}

I'll give it points for having good fish and kind of creative rolls and being a cute little spot.  I'll dock it points for having most of the same fish as any other sushi spot.  Carrying arctic char instead of salmon does not make you sustainable.  Plenty of other sushi restaurants carry artic char and little if anything on the AVOID list and they don't claim anything special.  I'll also dock points for value.  The sashimi sampler we had was over $30 and it didn't even begin to fill us up.  And all the special rolls are all $11 and over?  Plus they're all super tiny.  We didn't get any drinks and  2 people still spent over $60 without tip and left hungry.

Wow - that is some delicious food.  Loved the jalapenos on top.  \n8) Golden State Roll - very creative and very tasty.  I liked the touch of apple.  \n9) Coffee Jello - not good.

The restaurant is small and we had to wait for a table big enough to fit 3. (It was actually 2 individual tables pushed together.) They have a sign at the entrance announcing that parties have to be completely present in order to be seated. Parties of 2 got seated pretty quickly though.\n\nI started off with the miso soup. This could be a positive or negative but it was bland. I don't feel like I have salty taste but I had to add more soy sauce into my soup. We then all shared the beef carpaccio. I didn't think that this dish was flavorful at all. A friend recommended it and that's why I ordered it. The taste of the meat reminded me of the rare beef that is used in Vietnamese Pho Noodle soup. This dish also came out after some of our rolls even though we told the waiter that we wanted it as our started. I guess I just don't understand why raw meat with some sauce on the sides would take longer than fancy sushi rolls. I also had the Mix It Up roll. I am not a fan of fish but I wanted to give this roll a try. I would say that the crab meat on top overpowered the dish. All I tasted from each bite was spicy crab meat. So I guess for me, it was a good dish because I didn't have to taste the tuna. \n\nMy friends had the Hot Potato roll. They felt like it was a good veggie roll. The spicy tofuna was an interesting taste. I'm not a big vegetable person so I didn't really like the roll; it was kinda \"weird\" and nothing special.

I thought the waitress was very odd and cold and I guess service means a great deal to me.  She never once asked how things were and when we tried to wave to her politely to obtain more food, she seemed genuinely annoyed and expressed it with her odd demeanor.  I wouldn't bother going back again.  I'm sick of paying expensive prices for service that is cold and impersonal.", "author": "S.C. H."}

Maybe *the* best, since I felt comfortable knowing that the fish was sustainable and carefully researched and chosen. Kudos to the owners! I stopped eating sushi earlier this year as I learned more about fishing practices, overfishing, the impact on other sea life, etc.  Oh, it's hard trying to care about the world! Anyway, on top of the awesome philosophy of the place, the sushi was absolutely delicious, melt in your mouth good! I went with two recovering vegetarians who had never had non-vegetarian sushi before, and my sister's friend who knows a ton about sustainable fish. It was so exciting being able to order without constantly checking the Monterey Seafood Watch guide (which they did have out on every table, awesome! The sushi one comes out on Oct 22). We had the Golden State (scallops and apples - awesome!), the Extinguisher (spicy and delicious, and the plate comes on fire!), and skipjack, prawn and black cod nigiri. My friends had the Reggae, Veggie Philly and Tataki Rolls, and we traded a few pieces here and there. Everything was fantastic. Our waitress was not only super nice and totally on top of things, she also was totally informed and had an answer for every question we asked about the fish. I seriously am going to go here all the time. I missed sushi so much, and I'm so happy to be able to have it again!", "author": "Janet G."}

Val's colleague from MIIS sources all the fish, he also works for a non-profit dedicated to sustainable seafood. I had a few firsts when I went, which was the Uni (sea urchin) and pickled jellyfish salad. I actually liked the jellyfish, which is good since it will be about the only thing we have left to eat from the oceans in about 30 years unless we do something drastic to reduce overfishing. The Uni tasted like gritty condensed seawater...not my favorite, but I didn't nearly vomit like one of our friends that came along with us. I probably won't order Uni again voluntarily. The other 99% of our meal was full of amazing fish that took us on a journey of sustainability throughout the world's oceans. Everything we had (aside from the Uni, which is personal taste) was absolutely delicious and about as fresh as possible. The Sake was also amazing, we had several different varieties, and our server was a sake sommelier so we were in good hands as she described the subtleties of each of the sakes was tasted. This is an amazing place that I highly recommend, especially if you are genuinely concerned about the future of the oceans, our food supply, and sustainability.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-21", "description": "So, I think it is only appropriate that Tataki is my first review on Yelp.  This small, intimate sushi restaurant is the real deal.  I have actually never had fresher fish served and I have been to dozens of them.  Its a little pricier than the average spot, but you are paying for delicous food that is raised and farmed in a sustainable way.  Yes, some restaurants tout their sustainablblity hallmark, but Tataki is 100% genuine about their efforts toward this worthy cause.  I even over heard one of the owners mentioned that \"we're going to put jelly fish on the menu so that customers ask why we serve it and we will respond by saying that if we are not careful, we will all be eating jelly fish in the years to come b/c that will be the only thing left to eat in the ocean.\"  The owner is very passionate, genuine and happy to please.  He not only knows how to hire terrific sushi chefs, run a restaurant, and find the best/freshest fish he also seems to be a really good guy and is some one I am more than happy to give my money to.  I recommend this place for couples or some groups (4 max.).  The restaurant is simply too small for anything larger than that.  I was impressed all around by the food, presentation and friendly staff.  This is restaurant is 100% attitude-free, no egos what-so-ever.  I took my girlfriend last weekend for her birthday and I would recommend this place to other couples or very small groups (4 max.).  They do not take reservations and that may be my only complaint of the evening.  I wish Tataki the best of luck, we need more restaurants and people like them.", "author": "Jeff L."}

I don't know what sushi the rest of you reviewers had, and i don't want to believe that sustainable = awful, but the fish was not fresh, and none of the specialty rolls were anything other than average fish with gimmicky garnish like sweet sauces, tobiko, roe, or a small flame to distract your taste buds from the mediocrity underneath.

I have been here 3 times and service is always a problem.  We waited about 10 minutes and were the only ones waiting. No one suggested having a drink or even told us how long it would be.  When we were seated, the food came in piecemeal. The sushi was generally good but not great, same quality as Godzilla for twice the price.  The albacore was cut way too thick for sashimi and it was a not a good value.  They always try to make up for quality by making things even spicier and it rarely works.  I asked if they use real crab on a roll when I ordered and he said yes. Then we get some kind of chopped crab salad dollop on top of the roll (with hot sauce of course to make you forget about the fact it is not whole crab meat).  Wine is priced by the full glass and served in a shot glass.  It is frustrating to pay $10 for a glass of wine and get a 3 oz. portion.", "author": "Z A."}

Okay so the place is tiny, the decor is nice, and the place is intimate,  They managed to have sushi bar to seat 4 people. The tables are tiny and I felt like I'd knock every thing down if I moved a muscle.  This place literally fits like 25-30 people.  I figured service would be better but the waitress took forever to take our order and when she did she suprised me by not writing my order down on a check and guess what she missed one of our orders.  And I told her I wanted to cancel it since the food did not really give me any reason to keep it coming. The amount of food compared to the price was not equvilent because taste was not there. They did not once ask if everything was okay? I would not go here again. I order the fried calamari which was dired and not succulent and does not melt in your mouth like others I've had.  The seafood salad was tiny and I didn't really dig the vinegar dressing. The MIX IT UP was a traditional spicy tuna roll with an addition of crab meat on top. Nothing special for $12 bucks.

However, there were two tables open and two seats at the bar so we sat at the bar and greatly appreciated the friendliness and warm smiles from the  two sushi chefs behind the counter. The sushi rolls and appetizers at this restaurant are very original and detail oriented. The chefs use different colored fish eggs and lemon peels on assorted rolls to add color and just that extra hint of flavor. I would recommend ordering the house roll, Tataki roll, delicious and very different! Also, I would recommend the V.I.P. roll, its not on the menu but it is absolutely delectable and involves the chef slightly torching the fish. For an appetizer try the Ahi Tuna Poke,  fresh raw ahi tuna assortments with three different flavors topped with flavor infused fish eggs, something I have never seen before. Great place, very homey yet hip with a very friendly environment.
