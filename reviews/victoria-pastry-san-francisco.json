It's always the bday person's choice, so this time, we had a cake from Victoria Pastry. We celebrated on Tuesday, October 23rd around 2pm.\n\nWe got their Princess Cake: made with a Vanilla sponge cake (triple sec soaked) with a layer of raspberry jam, vanilla custard, and whipped cream, draped in green almond marzipan. I've never had a princess cake before working at this office and I have to say, it's really tasty. Light, but still decadent. Plus, the triple sec soaked cake gives it a lot of flavor and moisture. I'm not big on marzipan, but it works in this case. Actually, the combination of the custard, jam, and whipped cream all work really well together.\n\nDefinitely a great bakery for princess cakes. We always pick one up here every year for this particular bday.", "author": "Elena N."}

Italian old-school type. There is no high-end fanciness, but just amazing eyes-popping-out-of-your-skull flavors offered for purchase. Awesomeness defined!\n\nThe individual cake slices most often our weakness when here. The Princess and Strawberry layered whipped cream are our personal favorites, while we will often succumb to the temptation of another equally looking sinful selection while we have chosen wisely. \n\nHaving more than two or three different slices with a coffee each is 'how we roll' most often.\n\nThe extra bonus in going to this venue is that right around the corner is XOX truffles. I will run down there to grab a take-out box of their wonderful truffles after I get my fill of the sweet decadence here @ Victoria! \n\nWhen there are TWO iconic sweet stops within a block of each other in Beautiful and Historic North Beach, you know that, Yes: There is indeed a God! \n\nHOW GOOD IS THAT??", "author": "william s."}

When you visit Victoria pastry you are able to enjoy your purchase indoor or outdoor's. This is always helpful depending on your mood. I'm not sure of the flow of business in the morning, if they're missing out on business because this place opens up at 7 AM. Most people are halfway to work by 7am. If they would like to broaden their customer base it may be helpful if they opened up at 6 AM when people are on their way to work.\n\nI ordered a quarter pound of cookies to go, it was a mix and while waiting for a friend I ordered the cheesecake. The cheesecake was fair however since I'm from the East Coast and very familiar with New York cheesecake or cheesecake made with Philadelphia cream cheese this version was lackluster. It had a nice texture but lacked flavor. The cookies that included a Linzer tart that was eaten when I arrived back home in the Philadelphia area. Again the cookies that I ordered were fair, I'm not really impressed with any of the items that I purchased!\n\nWhen ordering it may be helpful to have a small sign in front of each selection of cookies so the customer is aware of what the options are. It's kind of annoying to the point at each cookie and ask, 'what is this?' and 'what is it made of?' The signs hanging above the workers written in a chalkboard style is not that helpful. But it's a small business I wish the very best", "author": "Leah M."}

I'm not sure how I didn't see it here before, as I visit the truffle shop around the corner every time I'm in town, but today I did see it. I had just checked into my hotel, and taken the bus up to this neighborhood to get truffles as my first SF destination (because priorities) and I decided to take a quick detour for a pastry or cookie or something first. It's the kind of thing that a trip to San Francisco *should* involve. Having delicious destinations, but being open to trying all kinds of new things as they come up. Finding cute bakeries and sharing a few treats while seated at a small table, watching people walk by. Sipping, smiling, sampling.\n\nRoll the dice and sometimes you lose, but not today. I walked in and saw that they have cookies for sale by the pound, and I ordered one of every single cookie on the middle shelf. They happily obliged and I ended up with a menagerie of delightful little cookies. They were all very European--small, cute, and would have been perfect to sample, share, and compare notes. But I was flying solo today and ate them all myself. I sat down at the cute table out front and ate every last one all by myself. I closed my eyes and felt the sun on my face, the breeze in the air, and the flavors in my mouth. It was aaaaalmost perfect.\n\nOf the cookies, the lunette is the most interesting, with its heart shape and window between layers that lets you peek into the jam. They're gorgeous. But the real winner was the almond flavored one, with the pine nut topping and the amazing chew. I can't even describe the perfect balance of sweet and texture and crunch. I could eat a dozen right now. \n\nThis really is the kind of place you just pop in and try. Their signature princess cake looks tremendous and you can try a slice, or there are a few others that were very tempting. The eclairs (choose from cream or custard) also called my name, but I will come back to share this sort of experience with others in the future; there's much to try.\n\nI left, and then went and got my truffles. And then I wandered and tried three other places on a whim. But there's so much more to explore, so I'll be back to the neighborhood, and back to Victoria.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

We chose a sun-drenched spot on the seating area outside to enjoy the pastries. The princess cake is probably the most ~ aesthetic ~ due to its bright green marzipan covering and intricate frosting lol. It tasted okay, but the marzipan was a little overpowering. The cake itself was fluffy and moist. The apple strudel was good, but would've been better warmed up since it was so hard to tear apart. And the cannoli was different from any other cannoli I've had - it's less sweet and you can really taste the ricotta in the filling.

With this said....if HE says it's good, trust me folks..., IT'S GOOD! ;)\n\nI've never been a huge fan of cannoli's until my hubby. I always thought they were too rich and too sweet. The cannoli's from Victoria's are nothing like that. The cannoli's found at Victoria's are freshly made everyday and you can actually taste the freshness. The texture of the cream filling has a thickness that pairs well with the outer shell. The flakeyness of the puff pastry is perfect! Every bite is deliciously decadent, and the puff pastry stays in contact with every bite. Other cannoli's usually break and start to flake off- not at Victoria's! Buy your cannoli's here, they are worth every penny!\n\nHere at Victoria's they also brew up some pretty good coffee. I tried their latte, which was perfect with my freshly made cannoli's.

The original location at Vallejo and Stockton was actually one of the first places I Yelped over a decade ago, so it's about time I revisited my ancient review with fresh eyes. Well, I don't know if my eyes are so fresh anymore, but the Pignoli cookies sure are. It's still among my favorite cookies because of the splash of amaretto that infuses the chewy dough amid all those toasted pine nuts (photo: http://bit.ly/2i5m4cJ).\n\nI also like the Biscotti here because they're compact, unadorned with chocolate, and not a challenge to expensive dental work (photo: http://bit.ly/2i5gOpN). The simple baked goods work best for us, but Christmas did bring some more elaborate treats like trees and stars with candied sugars (photo: http://bit.ly/2jfTcwm) and unreasonably happy gingerbread men with rainbow sprinkle berets (photo: http://bit.ly/2joQkkY). Their move to Filbert Street a few years back certainly makes it easier to get the cookies if you're hanging around Washington Square Park, which provides the idyllic opportunity for noshing on these goodies.\n\nSo why have I taken a star away? I guess for me, something's been missing since the move, that hurly-burly sense of abbondanza when it was in the true heart of North Beach. It's almost too tranquil being down the street from Saints Peter & Paul Church (photo: http://bit.ly/2iUDhHk), but I imagine spiraling real estate prices in the city forced the move. And at the end of the day, we're lucky this old-school Italian bakery didn't close or move to the 'burbs (although in fact, there is another one up in Greenbrae).

They are outstanding esp the pine nut cookies. I bought a variety of cookies and a Napoleon. All good stuff. At 8pm I could tell that the Napoleon was a bit soggy from sitting likely 12 hours but still as good as this type of dessert gets. See photos. At Stellas I know they sell cannolis and typically they only have a couple filled on display. As the day goes along they fill more to prevent soggyness. Didn't see any cannolis today at Victorias.

I recommend buying a slice and sharing with a friend along with a few pine nut cookies each.\n\nTry also in SF Tartine and BPatasserie. In Alameda try Crispian for the best almond croissant youve ever had.", "author": "Stefan T."}

I ended up having the Almond Tarte (flaky pastry, almond butter cake and raspberry) and the Cannoli (ricoota and chocolate chips). \n\nFirst off, the Almond Tarte was meh. It was chewy and borderline solid. It was too difficult to attack with my fork, although I may be misinterpreting the \"tarte\" as a cake? Either way, I didn't taste the almond and the raspberry had a peanut butter-ish texture that I was not a fan of.\n\nBut the CANNOLI. Oh man! It's basically a thick crusted, flaky pastry wrapped around a long tube of cream. When you bite into it, the thick crust just cracks the entire cannoli into pieces but the combination of the crust and the cream made me want to take another bite! It was delicious!\n\nI honestly do feel like the pastries are a little overpriced for what it is, but it's a type of pastry I've never had and Victoria's might have started a new addiction.

I have not yet to try anything else but I am sure it's just as amazing. I just remember 13 years ago while in college I was going to CCSF, and I had tried this cake and I fell in love with the cake. It is so yumy, I swear you will love it too. It has layers of flakey crust, taste like taramisu in between with custard, but I could be wrong and these creme puff's on top It has a lilttl bit a chocolate and it is just amazing. I love sweets and sugar, but for a cake not that sweet, I love it. I drive up here every year to get Andy's birthday cake. I think it's worth the drive. Now that they have this new location, you can find parking a whole lot easier than 13 years ago. When you place an order, you have to pay on the spot fyi. which I think is great becasue when you come and pick up your cake, you can just get it and go. The storefront looks so much better than their old location, where you can see through the windows and they eve have outdoor seating, if you want to enjoy your desert. They sell the cake by sllices or whole. PLus there is a park near by across the street, but soe desert and walk the park. \n\nI take that back, they have this pricess cake if I recall, that cake was amazing too. It's a small and dainty cake but it's good. Noy like the St. Honroe cake, where you can buy it round or full sheets. Best cake ever!!!", "author": "An N."}

It's the biggest reason to stop in at Victoria Pastry Company.\n\nMy first stop-in was with a Yelp friend, and we'd settled on a couple of other choices, considering the high-gear of our sweet tooth at that moment. However, when we sat down to enjoy our eats, we noticed a couple sitting next to us with just the Princess Cake. The woman of the couple began to strike up a conversation with us... about Princess Cake.\n\nShe is addicted to Princess Cake - considers herself a connoisseur of Princess Cake. She says that everyone usually goes to this one other bakery for Princess Cake, but she's found that Victoria Pastry Company has THE BEST. She would know. She has to have Princess Cake if she ever sees it anywhere. When she discovered neither of us have had it, she refused to let that continue to be the case and lopped off a piece of her cake and gave it to us to try out.\n\nHello, Princess Cake! Where have you been in my life?!\n\nCake has always been a member of the \"It does the job and generally all right\" club, but Princess Cake gets special honors. The textures, the flavors, especially the texture of the marzipan puts this slice of heaven above the clouds.\n\nI did return during my trip for a slice of my very own and to try other things. While the other pastries are quite nice, Princess Cake is the business.\n\nI think the only drawback is that their offerings of tea are Bigelow (yuck!) and their offerings of coffee typically taste burned.  There is nothing like a good cup of tea with your pastry, but you're not going to find that good cuppa here.\n\nPrincess Cake. Done.", "author": "Cate T."}

It used to be on Stockton St and the cakes were the best in North Beach.  However,  since it  moved to Filbert St. I feel something has changed.  We took home their rum cake and it was not the same as we remembered it from before.  The quality of the cake had gone down.  First, the outer layer used to be all whipping cream.  Now the sides are partially covered with buttercream or some kind of icing.  It's okay if you like the buttercream taste but to us, it tasted artificial.  Second, the bottom of the cake used to be drenched with rum and you could certainly taste it.  Now, there was no rum taste at all.

After numerous calls around SF for a birthday cake for my girl (to be picked up on Saturday), I spoke with Victoria's and opted to go with them because they had positive reviews. So... After 3 calls back & forth with Brian we were all set. My design and message for my cake were planned. They called the night before to confirm, I confirmed (call #4). No one - and I mean no one - told me that I had to pay in advance in order to have the cake artist actually put the design and the message on the cake. So what happened, no design, no message, crappy cake writing by an employee who tried her best but was not trained on writing on cakes. The cake artist was only there for a few minutes Saturday morning. I was in the air en route to SF so I did not get the managers one call on Saturday morning requesting payment. They cancelled the design. The manager Sylvia Raygosa and the employee Brian were not on the same page about this, and honestly, neither one of them cared. Sylvia said I had to pay in advance, but Brian who took the order didn't know and didn't care. He was the worst, he just sat there playing games on his phone when I was in the store. You could tell he is just one of those humans who comes in to collect a pay check and doesn't care about anything other than himself. \n\nWhen I arrived in SF I had no other options. It was too late. The chocolate truffle cake was mediocre, good, but certainly not great. In SF you have so many other better options. Don't support these people because they don't support their own customers.

Worth it. \n\nTotally. \n\nThe bakery outlasted my parent's marriage, unfortunately... but that's not the cake's fault. \n\nTook my husband last time we were down there, and he agreed. \n\nIt's a rockin' bakery.They have other good stuff too. \n\nWe didn't risk a car wreck though, we parked several, ok many, blocks away and walked over.\n\nThe cake still tasted delicious.", "author": "Janet M."}

The guy helping us seemed like he had a long day and was over it, which is fine but service was just passable. \n\nWe settled on a chocolate cake with chocolate shavings and a peanut butter cookie. Both were fine. I liked the cake. Cookie was on the crunchy side and was sweeter than the already sweet cake.

I had my first Chocolate Eclair here and had it many more times after that.....today it's just as tasty as I can remember.\n\nThe Eclair is filled with either Whipped Cream or Custard and topped off with a Chocolate Frost.  You have got to bite into this....it's lite, it's tasty.....I don't mind getting whipped cream all over my mouth while eating this....but please do not touch my Eclair.\n\nThe St. Honore Cake\n\nThis was also one of my favorite cake in my younger days and today it still is.  The St. Honore Cake is a Vanilla pastry cream flaky crust and layered with rum soaked sponge layers and topped off with a ring of vanilla cream puffs.  Should you order a whole cake you can ask for extra cream puffs.  Do not take a slice of St. Honore Cake without the Cream Puff......because they go hand and hand.  Not too sweet, you can taste the Rum a little.  A fun cake to eat!!\n\nThe Princess Cake\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VxtDQfBA3ECjTUO7CG1YXQ?select=eyhHHmI92CQPLGqPTFaayg\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VxtDQfBA3ECjTUO7CG1YXQ?select=CB3aDY11FvUEsB92zuMVXg\n\n3 sections of sponge cake filled with whipped cream, vanilla custard and raspberry filling.  This is topped off with a Marzipan icing (Green, Pink or Natural color).  I brought this cake into work for a celebration and it was gone within 20 minutes.  At our company usually we have lots of cake left over...but not this time.\n\nNext the cookies....Amaretti Plain Cookie and the Amaretti Pinenut (Pignolli) Cookie.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VxtDQfBA3ECjTUO7CG1YXQ?select=K3S1QHj1QdLwiWDVSjwaIw\n\nThis is a Macaroon almond mix and on the sweet side of thing....this is made with egg whites.  The Pignolli has Pinenuts added to the cookie.  Both cookies are on the rich side but very tasty.\n\nThe Torrone\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VxtDQfBA3ECjTUO7CG1YXQ?select=qGwUZ-AvFRJNF5sDMhsb2w\n\nTorrone is an Italian candy, very popular in Italy.  They make their own at Victory Pastry.  It's made of Honey, Fresh roasted Hazelnuts and nougat.  Very chew nougat.  The Nougat is sold in blocks....I like to cut up the blocks into small so it's easier to eat.\n\nAll this was around for me when I was growing up and today they continue to put a smile on my face.\n\nSpecial orders be sure to call it in or go online and place your order!\n\nI've not had an item here that has failed me......\nThey take cash and Credit Cards....\nThere are a few tables available for having a snack and some coffee.\nEnjoy the food, enjoy the fun!!\n\nRating - 5 stars from ever since I can remember.\nService - 5 stars....very nice people.\nParking can be a challenge in this area.", "author": "Alan L."}

I frequent Chinatown every weekend for my weekly veggie and fruit shopping and Vietnamese food or dim sum fix, yet I never thought of walking in here to try their pastries....until I suddenly had a craving for cannollis. I don't know why, but I haven't had a cannoli since I've accepted my lactose-intolerance status years ago. I think the last time I had one was...10 years ago (?) from Dianda's Bakery here in the Mission. And here I was, craving for a connolli and I think it's because Lent is upon us and I usually give-up certain foods during Lent, including dessert, but cannolis??  Anyhoo, instead of stopping by Dianda's  on the way home (I live nearby), I thought I'd try this place since I was already in the area getting my pho fix. \n\nAs I walked-in, there was a lot of chatter from the patrons who were in there having coffee and pastries as an afternoon snack. No, not Italian, but Cantonese =). Remember, Chinatown is a hop, skip away. So the display was pretty empty. They still had cookies and various whole and slices of cakes, but I didn't see any cannolis. I was the next person to be helped and I told the young woman that I wanted two cannolis. She looked in the display case and of course she didn't say any left, but told me she would go to the back to get some. From what I've read in a previous review, they make their cannollis made to order. I paid for my cannollis ahead of time and about 5 min. later, she came back out with small box of cannolis =). I was happy. I now had my cannollis to satisfy my craving and dessert fix before Lent. \n\nSince I had two, I decided to only eat one with my tea when I got home and save the other for the next day. I was happy with my choice. Filling was firm and not runny, not too sweet, and had mini chocolate chips with a marachino cherry on each end. Mmmm....good choice, although I was eyeing there slice of tiramisu in t heir display case. Hmmm.....I just might have to go back on Monday or Tuesday before Lent to try that =D. \n\nOh, the cannolis set me back $8.50 ($4.25 for each). A little pricey??

The first time I went to Victoria's it was in a different location, and the shop was pretty big. It had an old time Italian feel to it, the walls were all painted with murals, and the dessert casses were filled with every little Italian pastry you could imagine. The people who worked there were very nice and they accomodated the large group I was in with ease. Went to North Beach recently with my hubby and we thought we would check out the new location and sit in the sun at the nearby Washington Square.\n\nWhat a mistake that was!! So many Italian bakeries in this area that we could have spent our money in and we choose this place. \n\nFirst off, we walk in, excited to be there, me thinking its going to be like my last visit, and we are immediatly ignored by the person behind the counter. She was cleaning the espresso machine and was too busy to even greet us with a \"hello\". \n\nWe then started our order, starting off with a dozen pignoli cookies, 2 canolis, and another type of almond cookie that had powdered sugar and slivered almonds on top of them. The woman that was helping us not only took her sweet a** time, but she made a mess by getting the canoli cream on the side of the bag, and throwing the pignoli cooking in the bag like they were rocks. \n\nWhile she was abusing the pastries we ordered, I asked to use the restroom, since the sign on the restroom said \"for customers only\". Well I am going to buy all those pastries so I am a customer. She didn't even look up from what she was doing and said \"yeah its right there\" and pointed to the restroom door.\n\nTo top off this already negative experience, my husband asked for an iced latte since we were going to sit in the sun at the park and it was such a nice day out. Rudly, this same woman said, \"I can't we dont have any ice.\" Are you serious?!? I get it, somtimes you run out of materials and you have to tell the customer no, but dont make it seem like it is OUR fault that YOU ran out of ice. That is extremely terrible customer service and bad manners in general. My husband settles for a hot latte and she hands him a cup with coffee all down the sides and gives us a total for the goods. \n\nNot only was the service down right unacceptable, the canolis were soggy and the ricotta tasted a little sour. We ending up giving the nasty pastries to a homeless man who was very excited to receive it. The pignoli cookies are always the best, and you have to almost try to mess up this cookie, but Im sure i can fine another bakery in the area that will have a better product and they treat their customers with at least respect that I would be happy to give my money to.", "author": "Lizzie D."}

The girl was sweeping the floors. \n\n\"Hello,\" I said quietly. She didn't hear me and continued sweeping. \n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said a little louder. \n\n\"Yeah?\" \n\nI was a tad taken aback; she didn't seem happy to see me. Granted, it must've been close to closing time, but still. Undeterred, I asked what the bakery was known for in terms of baked items. To her credit, she answered with a list of stuff, just not stuff I like to eat. \n\nSo I decided to go with a cream puff. She said sure, walked over to the case, and took the cream puff out. (Remember, she was sweeping floors before this. And she wasn't wearing gloves.) I happened to look where she was holding the puff, and she had her bare thumb ON the top of the cream puff. There was no napkin between her thumb and the puff, the former of which was in contact with a dirty broom not too long before that. \n\nWhen she saw I was watching, she did wrap up the puff before putting it into the bag, all without touching the pastry. I went and paid for it and ate it just because I had to satisfy my sweet tooth. \n\nSo in summary:\n\n- Don't go in right before closing and order stuff, especially if they're sweeping up. OR if you must, then keep a close eye to make sure hygienic practices are followed. \n\n- Customer service attitude wasn't great, but it was late in the day.\n\n- 3 stars for the cream puff. Not the best I've had, but it was decent. \n\nI likely won't go back.", "author": "Evelyn C."}

RASPBERRY TART:  This had a nice hard crust and the middle was crumbly with raspberry filling.  It was topped with strutsel, powdered sugar, and something else.  My friends and I loved this.  Because this dish has so many layers, we felt it was interesting because we picked up slightly different flavors with each bite.  \n2. COOKIES.   Their cookies are amazing, but you'll pay for them.  Check out my pictures to see which ones we chose.   If you do get cookies...definitely ask for their recommendations.  Our favorite was that almond shortbread cookie.  It was crispy on the outside, but surprisingly chewy in the middle.  The chewyness was kinda fruity-nougaty, for lack of a good term.  \n\nThis Italian bakery has been around forever, they're super helpful, and the food tastes great.

Since we were in North Beach, I knew we were surrounded by bakeries, but the real question was...what one should we go to? I didn't have to look very far because Yelp pointed me in the direction of Victoria Pastry Company. \n\nThis bakery is as delicious as everyone else says it is. It's simple, doesn't have (or need) frills and serves delicious sweets that hit the spot. They have a wider variety of daytime sweets but they still have a small selection of breakfast pastries. My two favorites were the lemon bars and and a long cinnamon/apple breakfast pastry (not sure what its exact name was, but just look for the long rectangular pastry topped with delicious looking frosting). \n\nThe guy behind the counter claimed the lemon bars were the best there is and although I had already reached my sweet capacity for the day, we couldn't leave without trying one out. The guy was right folks. Those lemon bars are some of the best out there and I really didn't think the taste of lemon bar could vary, but I was wrong. They top these lemon bars with a crumbly, crust-like topping that is the perfect twist.

My first experience here was my sister's wedding cake, their famed St. Honore's cake - think multiple cream puffs bunched into a round cake, but filled with custard instead of whip cream (gee.. sounds like Beard Papa's) and topped with halved marachino cherries.  It was a kid's delight, especially when my favorite drink was a Shirley Temple... love dem cherries.  Today, I had three things in mind, but they only had two available:    \n                     1.  Mini Palmiers - purchased a half pound of freshly made\n                          \"butterflies\" as we called them as kids.  Great with coffee\n                           for breakfast or general munching.\n                     2.  Tiramisu - saving it for breakfast, but should be good \n                           since they now own Stella (\"best in town\")\n                     3.  Chocolate half/half cookies - didn't have this today so I \n                           passed on their substitutes; this is a chocolate butter\n                           cookie that is chocolate covered on one side and not on\n                           the other.\n\nNo, I didn't get their signature pastries, but they have a hearty selection of biscottis, cookies, bear claws, tarts, and croissants to choose from.  My purchase came to $19.00 which is no bargain compared to the Chinese bakeries a few blocks away; but the quality and flavor justify the added cost.  You get a variety of customers ranging from dine-in (small tables inside and out), family take home buyers (whole cakes), or breakfast munchers like me.  No, I didn't eat them all in one sitting and I did share.  Nothing like peeking in the fridge and finding something worth satisfying your hunger.  I miss you Tiramisu!", "author": "Mike C."}

I know it's been discussed before, but their Princess Cake is divine.   Pastry cream, whipped cream, and marzipan with one layer of raspberry jam is perfection.   Their tiramisu is a little heavy on the alcohol, but still good.  The other pastries I've tried have been good, but don't knock your socks off like the Princess Cake.   So on our last day driving out to Redwood City to our son's house, we were going to pick up Princess Cake but Richmond bakery called Schubert's was way more convenient.  VPC is a slightly better cake but about 60% more expensive than Schubert's on Clement St., so take that into account if you don't want the hassle of North Beach and want to pay $20 for a cake rather than $34.   Wish I got to the Bay area more often (only there about once/year to visit my son & his gf) as I adore VPC.   The owner & the staff are sweeties.  A few tables out front in the shade, as well as a few tables inside where my long-suffering husband sits & waits (he rarely eats desserts).  Miss you already as the DC area where I live has a dearth of good Italian pastry.   North End in Boston & North Beach in San Fran are the best IMAO if you're into cannolis, tiramisu, that zabaione cake (sfaggonia, one of my other favorites when I don't choose the Princess Cake).", "author": "Suzanne G."}

After reading about the St. Honore cake, I thought to myself, \"Well, that sounds like something tasty...let's order one for Dad's birthday!\"  So having schlepped all the way over to North Beach to inspect the cake and put in my order, I was expecting quite a bit from it.  Too bad it didn't live up to expectations...\n\nFirst off, I did not appreciate the fact that they got the inscription on the cake wrong.  All it needed to say was \"Happy Birthday Papa\" along with the date.  They got the first part, but didn't even bother putting in the date, which I specifically asked for.  This could have been caught at the bakery before I brought it home, but they had the box already tied up with string and I didn't want to seem like a bitch by asking them to undo everything.  That should have been a tip-off that something was wrong...all the other bakeries I've ever gone to, including the Chinese ones, show you the cake and the inscription before they box it up.  Its not a huge deal, but it would have been nice to get what I wanted on the cake.\n\nThe cake itself was just okay and not really worth the $27 I paid for an 8 inch cake.  The decorations on the cake were sloppily done- the little maraschino cherries were different sizes (honestly, would it have cost that much more to get full cherries, rather than quarter pieces?), the whipped cream turrets were uneven, and the whipped cream frosting on the outside of the cake didn't even fully cover the cake.  The cake looked more like something out of a home kitchen rather than a professional bakery.\n\nAs for the taste of the cake, I personally found that the taste of rum was a little overpowering.  The cake also seemed puny- there was only one actual layer of cake, while the rest consisted of a custard filling and some puff pastry at the bottom.  The only redeeming feature of the cake was the cream puffs, which were delicious.  I'm glad that they filled the cream puffs with custard, rather than the more standard whipped cream.  \n\nThe St. Honore cake from Victoria is unlikely to ever grace a birthday party in my family, especially since there are so many other bakeries to choose from.

So, I was like \"WTF!!?\" and I asked her if there was a problem.  Well, she bit my head off, but at least she put her attitude in check and she was nicer to the next customer... and I was on my way home with a box full of delicious pastries.  Well, I was very much pleased with the product; but not so much with the customer service, particularly because it had been my first time there.  \n\nToday while I was shopping in Chinatown for a cheap broom, I decided to stop by and give it another try.  The older-lady that helped me was very nice and helpful.  I left happy.  (Probably the only thing that I was not happy about was that the gorgeous boy that works behind the counter has not ever actually helped me.  I always get the girls.  Maybe one day I'll luck out!)  Well, I got home and I opened my box of pastries to find out that I was not given what I had asked for; I had requested a custard canollie, but instead I got an eclair.  It was delish anyway! \n\n So, this is the thing that  gets me about San Francisco, there are tons of places with so much potential for being Gold-mines, given that their product is high in quality and value, BUT, the customer service is often weak.  I've found myself going to corporate businesses   mainly because there, the clerks' job description requires that they smile and treat me with respect.

You should know a couple things about me. I try really hard to eat well six days a week. The seventh is pure gluttony! And I plan for it. I strategize as to how I am going to indulge. Today it was Victoria Pastry Co. I made the family wait in the car as I ran in to order (mainly because I knew my wife's mouth would drop as I picked one item after another). \"I'm gonna need a box\" I said when she asked me what I would like.  I ordered 2 cannolis for myself, a piece of chocolate cake for my wife's belated birthday, a napoleon for me, a kitty cat cookie for my daughter, and a chocolate eclair for me. (I do think of others....) \n\nI consider my self a critique of the eclair; so questioned the contents, \"is there real custard in there or something else\" --- \"I hava both custard and cream\" = \"Custard\" I replied without hesitation. \"And the napoleons too?\" --- \"Custard also\" she retorted.\n\"one of those please\"\n\n\"Youra gooda boy\" she said and handed me a complementary piece of cinnamon sour cream cake ( not bad also). I could not wait to get home.\n\nNow the review: the cannoli is as traditional as I have had in a while, not overstuffed with over-sweetened cream. The cookie was sturdy, and had more flavor than many of the other wafer types you find. The cream, though a bit bland for my taste, was very good. All in all, a solid A- for the treat. The napoleon: B+, though I am not a frequenter of the pastry. The pastry layers were a bit stiff, making the process a bit difficult to navigate. The custard was phenomenal! The cookie was good (and cute) and the chocolate espresso cake was very rich and moist; a clear A-. Now the best for last.\n\nThe best for last. Having tasted the custard with the napoleon, I could hardly wait to eat the eclair. But when I did, it surpassed my expectations. This is old school and what I mean by that, this is classic pat a choux, real custard and a fabulous chocolate ganache. This is like grandma used to make.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-02-18", "description": "Let me preface this review by explaining that I have been frequenting Victoria Pastry (other locations as well) since I was a young child, so least 20+ years. It has always been an absolute gem in my eyes, especially concerning their most prized and delicious princess cake. I have simply never tasted one as good...EVER. Needless to say, I went out of my way this past Sunday afternoon, traveling from the opposite end of the city for what should have been a very special treat. Boy was I shocked and dismayed by arguably the worst customer service I have perhaps ever experienced. Unfortunately I do not have the name of the server, but from the moment I walked in to order, the service my partner and I received was shockingly aggressive, ill mannered, and simply demeaning. When asked what we would like, I proceeded to order a napoleon and an almond torte. The first red flag occurred when the server proceeded to assertively rush me  as I was deciding what to order, and was extremely aggressive in his tone. He then proceeded to place my order into a box and while doing so, one side of the torte fell off--to which he used his bare hand to push back together. Unsanitary much?? From the moment after I stated my order, he loudly yapped the total price to me, ($9.10) probably a good six times. At this point he hadn't even finished wrapping my order, so I was confused at the veracity of his tone--especially being that there was no one else in line. By the seventh time he barked at me, I was really confused and quite perplexed. It was as if he thought I was going to run out of the establishment without paying? To make matters worse, he then shouted to my parter the price one last time, before my parter became heated and told him not to worry and that we were going to pay him. It was then that the server answered back that my partner was giving him a \"weird look\" so thats why he repeated the ten of $9.10 with sure a forceful tone. I have no idea what his problem was, but it made my parter and I feel so upset and uncomfortable, that we decided to walk out. It is moments like these that have the ability to make or break a business, regardless of the high quality of their product. I sadly and unfortunately cannot frequent this establishment again, especially this location. I am tempted to report this behavior to the labor board and /or health department, especially the grossly unsanitary portion of this experience.", "author": "Ahna K."}

Tried the apple filled which wasn't too sweet, and I didn't think I would like the blueberry and cream cheese pastry, but I had a couple bites and it was a pleasant surprise. I don't remember all the cookies that I got, but there was one with a hint of almond that had just the right amount of chewiness. The cookies are small so you can try a bunch of them without feeling TOO guilty, but be careful, because before you know it...you'll have eaten an entire bag.

SO i almost NEVER write reviews but I felt that i had to for this WONDERFUL place. \n\nLets start the beginning of my journey.. \nWe wanted to get cakes for Prom (4 full sheets) and were looking for a really good place and of course I go  on yelp, and TADAAAH. Victoria's Bakery popped right up with her famous princess cake (which are DELICIOUS btw). \n\nAnyways. So I go over there, and was very, very sad to find that it would cost 1500 for 4 full sheets (precut). But Victoria was extremely helpful and genuinely wanted to help and offered an alternative: mini napoleons, mini eclaires, and only 2 full sheets pre-cut princess cakes. She originally doesnt do mini cakes, but she said \"for you, I do it.\" Dont you know thats the one thing a gir loves to hear?!~ It all came down to 1,100. A little bit over our budget... so she took 10 percent off and BAM. 990$ (barely matching our 1000 budget). WHOOOOHOOO!! \n\nTo top it all off, she gave us a free saint honore cake, free slice of princess cake, and free cannoli. yummy. Great service, wonderful and cutesy lady (i love her accent tehe), and sure...the price might be a tad expensive, but its WORTH IT. Trust me!", "author": "Natasha S."}

We ended up with the whole bottom tier left over, most of which had to be thrown away. We wasted a lot of money. Strike one.\n\nThey refused to deliver it, even with over a month's notice to get someone on the schedule to bring it out--and we were willing to pay their outrageous $200 delivery fee. Strike two.\n\nBut the reason I was so upset was that they mis-decorated it. My mom went in with me and we told the woman taking the order over and over again that we wanted something just like in one of the pictures on their site, only with no roses. We told her maybe six times and she just nodded. Finally my mom asked her if she should write it down. We were having a Hawaiian themed wedding and wanted to put live hibiscus flowers on the cake. The roses wouldn't work with that. The woman said she'd remember and refused to write it down.\n\nOf course, when the person who had so selflessly volunteered to go pick up the cake brought it in, roses on wires had been stuck in. I couldn't even remove them to re-decorate. I was already stressed out, so I couldn't help just busting into tears. The Victoria Pastry Company literally made me cry!\n\nThe cake was the one thing I really regretted about my wedding. Everything else was lovely, but we over paid, had to deal with incompetent and stubborn staff, and got a cake that just didn't look as good because it stuck out like a sort thumb.\n\nI suppose we'll still go to Stella's for our annual Christmas cake, but the Victoria Pastry Company is out of the running.

It was very delicious!!!\n\nWhen we came in for our tasting the lady who helped us was very nice and gave us generous portions to try. We came in with both sets of parents and she even gave each dad a big slice of the Princess Cake that they didn't have to share with any of the rest of us! :-) The moms, my husband and I all shared a piece, plus 3 other slices of other flavors that we were choosing between.\n\nThe wedding cake was beautiful and delicious. I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for two things:\n\n1. We ordered a sheet cake in addition to the 3-tier wedding cake so we would have enough cake for everyone. The sheet cake was never delivered to the reception site and I didn't find that out until we were getting ready to cut the cake! Luckily we didn't end up needing it. There was enough cake for everyone who wanted it (plus a little extra - we got to keep the top tier). The owner was very nice about reimbursing us for the $ that we spent on the sheet cake that we never received\n\n2. At our tasting I brought the dimensions of our Lenox cake topper because I wanted to make sure that it would fit. The lady did not write down the dimensions and insisted that the cake topper would fit. Well...on wedding day it did not fit. The cake still looked pretty with fresh flowers that my mom collected from the guest book table as our cake topper (good thing she entered the ballroom before any of our guests did to check it out).

I had to wait a really long time to buy them though, I think because it was before Christmas. This woman in front of me ordered a cake and she was annoyed because they jacked up their prices for the Christmas season and charged her $2.00 to write \"Merry Christmas\" on top of the cake in red frosting.

I trolled Yelp reviews looking for a place to get a birthday cake for my daughter's 5th birthday. After reading so many positive reviews I decided on Victoria. I also like the fact that it seemed like a neighborhood favorite and local mom & pop place. I called first to make sure that doing a kids b-day cake was something they could do and the lady said sure come on down to order it.\n\nSo I troop down with my four year old and baby, find parking in Chinatown and the lady behind the counter is a total nightmare! A young girl was trying to help me but she needed to consult with I'm guessing was the owner, an older lady, and that is when things went downhill. She was so completely rude that I was caught off guard. I could tell that the younger lady was really embarrassed because she kept apologizing. The older lady was downright nasty when all I was trying to do was order a pretty basic cake, have them decorate it for a kid and add a candle that I brought along.\n\nIf you don't want to do a kids cake fine, I understand that it may not be their thing but don't tell me you can on the phone. And above all lose the attitude. What a total waste of time.", "author": "Brooke M."}

The place looked good inside, but the pastries were less than good.  The person that helped us was rude and rolled her eyes.  We asked about nuts in some of the pastries, because some of us are allergic.  We still wanted to give the place a shot.  We took the pastries home to enjoy  later in the day and found that 2 of them were burnt on the bottom and dry inside.  After discovering this, I called to notify them.  They took down the info and said that a manager would call us the next day.  The manager did not call us back and we had to call again.  Speaking to the manager, she said that she would not refund our money and hung up on us.  We called back to find out why and she hung up on us again.  This is very poor customer service and the manger acted very childish.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I have never been treated like this from a business before.", "author": "Alan A."}

So a few days ago, for my birthday, my husband suggested that we buy a cake from Victoria Pastry. So we crossed town and it took us for ever to find parking and then, after a long wait, we got a chocolate cake that looked great. But when we got home and tried it it was totally stale. and it wasn't jut a little stale, it was at least one week old, or probably more. I stopped after one bite. None of our guests could eat it either. I am surprised that it actually didn't get us sick. The next day I called them and complained, but an empoyee answered and just took my name and number and they never called back. I didn't want to cross town again in order to return it. But that stale cake cost $20 and I will never go there again.", "author": "farinaz A."}

Having had pastries from them before, I can say they are among the best.  The taramisu is light, yet complex with lady fingers, savery marscipone, and chocolate.  The conoli is crispy with savery marscipone, dark chocolate shavings, and a fresh cherry.  The custard eclare is to die for with custard so thick that it holds the pastry together, as opposed to it comming apart.  The custard is thick yet light; the pastry itself is light with a wonderfully thin chocolate on top.  Round it off with a decaf or regular coffee which is just right and you will not be disappointed.  So, for excellent Italian pastries at reasonable prices with friendly service, Victoria Pastry cannot be gbeat.  The shop is clean with plenty of tables to sit and mingle at while looking out on to busy North Beach.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}
