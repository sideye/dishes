There's a server who wears skeleton earrings who maybe had a bad day, or maybe just dislikes her job...it's hard to tell. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered the burger and specifically asked twice for no pickles. He even repeated it before she left, and she nodded. Guess what? It came with an absurd mountain of FIFTEEN juicy pickles (15). When he flagged her down to show her, she sort of rolled her eyes, stared blankly, and asked, \"Well, are you allergic?\" \n\nWHY does he have to be allergic? He specifically asked for no pickles. It's not like he was asking for a soup to be remade without meat, or for fries to be fried in a specific oil, or anything like that. It was a simple request. The pickles were so juicy that they soaked through the bun and permeated the meat. She didn't write anything down, maybe that's the issue? She actively avoided our table after we brought it to her attention. Our next interaction was an hour later, getting our check. \n\nAside from that, my catfish poboy was nothing spectacular. We didn't have knives to cut anything with, and we didn't have water on our table for over 20 minutes. To think of it, I had a 12:45pm reservation for Saturday lunch and we weren't seated until closer to 1pm (there were four tables open; the girl at the lobby was just on the phone while everyone crowded into the narrow awkward foyer). \n\nThey tried to right it by bringing some hush puppies for dessert. But we didn't have plates or utensils, so we just sat there. A different server noticed we didn't have anything to eat them with, and eventually plates and forks appeared. It didn't make up for it, but it was a nice gesture. Our interaction just left a bad taste in our mouths aside from the lackluster food....coupled with how inefficient things seem to have gotten here. I won't be coming back.", "author": "May L."}

Renditions off the classic egg benedict are a dime a dozen, but the time and forethought placed into piecing together this dish made it incredibly good. I don't even like crab, but I thought this was superb.\n\nMy sister really enjoyed her polenta + eggs dish ($15).

Parking in the area can be tricky as this restaurant is surrounded by other businesses and warehouses so street parking is the way to go.  Be patient and you'll find one, I'll guarantee!  Came here for Sunday brunch; we made reservations for it but we were pretty early for the time we reserved for so then we would have to wait for a table to open up.  The bar area was open and free to sit so we decided to sit there rather than to wait another half hour to be seated when a table became available.  No problem there... the hostess was very flexible with us and so we decided to just sit at the bar area.  The bartender was friendly and attentive to our needs; the drinks were great and the food was also amazing.  The menu was of modern American food but playful.  Here's what we ordered:\n1.  P B & J:  An interesting modern take on the classic PB&J but this had a confit pork belly, battered brioche (french toast), and jam.  The taste was of savory, sweet, and salty which was very yummy.\n2.  Cornbread benedict:  Almost like a classic benedict but this included braised pork and a little heat from the chile.  It was good but not as memorable.\n3.  Serpentine burger:  The burger was good; juicy and flavorful but tasted more of a regular burger you'd find anywhere.  I expected a little bit more from it.\nOverall, it was a good experience.  Customer service was great and food was okay but we enjoyed the restaurant.  It was clean, comfy, and a lot of character.

There's nothing wrong with Panda Express but the problem is charging $15 for one piece of chicken. The biscuit is not flakey or fluffy which left me guessing that it's not properly baked. Also, the fries are not crispy or seasoned well. Overall, the entire dish has a soggy/mushy texture which made it unappetizing. \n\n\nI fail to see the allure of Serpentine. My opinion maybe a bit biased as this place has been so hyped and recommend that I expected something more. The impression of Serpentine is a restaurant that thinks they are the sh*t and acts like they are the sh*t, but really, they are so far from being the sh*t. This is the worst type of restaurant because this illusion permeates all the way through to the service and the food. \n\nI'm usually pretty lenient on service, however what I can't tolerate is pretentiousness. There is an aloofness and ingenuity with staff which I find unprofessional. We arrived on time for our reservation and the hostess ensured that our table was being prepared. We thought it would be quite quick as it looked like it was a relatively slow day with open tables available. 10 minutes roll by and she comes back dismissively stating that our table is still being prepared. Another 5 minutes go by until she gesturally points her finger across the room to an open table. She has a smirk which we assumed meant, \"I'm too lazy to walk over to sit you, so you can make your way over yourself.\" Overall, there is a lot to be desired with the service.\n\nMuch like the service, there is also a lot to be desired from the food. The overall quality of the food is subpar in relation to the premium price. If you're looking for brunch place around the Dogpatch neighborhood that serves a burger or fried chicken, I would recommend going to either Alta MSP or Marlowe. On a positive note, the one good thing about Serpentine is their Bloody Mary - it's light and refreshing with a subtle spicy kick. \n\nOverall, the brunch experience is unmemorable and unremarkable which is a great neutral baseline for other restaurants to be judged too.

This place has it all - cool location, modern ambiance, friendly service, and above all excellent food. We had a great time from start to finish.\n\nWe began by sharing the mussels as a starter and absolutely loved them. The broth was laden with ground chili, lime, and garlic that was a unique and delicious twist on a classic white wine and garlic preparation.  Beware that there's a good kick to it, but we thought the heat level was great and didn't detract from the flavor of the dish.\n\nI had the scallops for dinner, and my husband had the halibut. Both were outstanding. I was particularly impressed by my scallop dish - again, a welcome departure from seared-scallops-and-puree. There were so many layers of flavor in the vibrant broth and the bed of rice laden with charred fresh corn and chanterelle mushrooms, and the scallops were just perfect. My husband loved his halibut as well, with its briny topping of capers and beautifully charred market vegetables.\n\nWe concluded our meal by each ordering the lime + graham cracker, an awesome variation on a key lime pie.

My friend said the salad was too dress so it tasted a bit on the saltier side, but perhaps this could be fixed with asking for the dressing on the side, so no biggie. The french toast was very egg-y, flat and not fluffy, and the fixings had mango and pineapple, so that was tasty, but the toast itself was underwhelming. The short rib and hash brown was kind of bland. The short rib meat came shredded on top of the hash brown and the hash brown came as a pile like mashed potatoes while the sides being a little brown but not at all crispy. It was topped with a sunny side up egg. I wasn't very impressed by this, BUT the great redeeming factor was the truffle fries! Omg I would come back for their truffle fries and maybe drinks.

Even with a reservation my date and I had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, but that's just testament to how good the food is and we grabbed some coffee at the bar and it wasn't an inconvenience at all. \n\nThe Nashville hot fried chicken biscuit sandwich was massive and definitely a fork and knife dish than something you can actually pick up. The bisect is honey-sweet and the chicken is just slightly spicy so as to not be off-putting for a breakfast dish. The cornbread benedict was also great. The bread was sweet just how I like it, and tall/dense enough to stand up to the saucy goodness on top. On its own it was a tad dry but when I busted open that flawlessly poached yolk the bad boy was singin. I could have used another slice of bacon to get the ultimate balance, but I did not leave hungry so I'm not complaining.  \n\nAs great as the two entrees were, it all began possibly stronger...with the absolutely phenomenal buttermilk cinnamon sugar donuts. Crispy, dense, and slightly tangy, these are the donuts of my dreams. Served with two immaculate dipping sauces - salted caramel and vanilla icing - every bite was explosive, and the sauces were so good I kept them and dunked my perfectly crisped potatoes into the sweetness in between bites with ketchup and hot sauce.\n\nIf you're looking for a new spot to get some wonderfully creative yet super hearty breakfast I highly recommend checking them out.", "author": "Sean S."}

After looking through OpenTable to see what reservations were avail, I decided on Serpentine. I made a reservation for three a couple days prior for Saturday, March 4th at 2pm.\n\n*Fried Egg Biscuit Sandwich: fried egg, arugula, gruyere, dill aioli, crispy potatoes ($12)\n*Cornbread Benedict: spicy maple bacon, poached eggs, hollandaise, crispy potatoes ($15)\n*Prather Ranch Hamburger: pickled red onions, house made pickles, arugula, acme roll, french fries ($16), add Gruyere (+$2), Nueske's Bacon (+$3)\n*Nueske's Bacon ($3)\n*Bloody Mary: vodka, house bloody mix ($11)\n*Senator: rye, lemon, maple, absinthe ($12)\n*Avinyo Cava Reserva Brut Nature 2011: Catalonia, Spain ($12 glass)\n*Organic & Fair Trade House Coffee ($3) \u00d73\n\nI ended up getting the breakfast sandwich and a side of bacon. The breakfast sandwich was good. I love my oozy eggs and these were nice and over easy. I didn't really read the menu well though cuz I would have added sausage to my sandwich for the extra $4 if I did. I do love my meat after all. The side of bacon did fulfill my meat craving, but I wish the pieces were thicker and not as crispy. I like a little chew to my bacon. For drinks, I had a coffee and a glass of bubbly. After the night I had the day before, it was a good way to ease into the afternoon. My friends seemed to enjoy their meals and drinks.\n\nFun place for a simple low key brunch.

The cornbread they put it on was HUGE. I do feel that the cornbread was delicious but it was more on the dry side which made it hard to eat since it kept crumbling apart. The spicy bacon they add instead of ham was tasty as well. The poached eggs however were extremely overcooked - they were basically boiled eggs so I didn't get to enjoy the satisfying feeling of breaking the yolk. I felt so full after eating only half of my dish. \n\n- Eggs, potatoes, bacon, and bread: The portions for this dish was huge as well. They didn't skimp on any of the components and it was a very filling dish. The potatoes were perfectly crisped and salted as well.\n\n- Pimms drink: My FAVE! I became obsessed with pimms after I studied abroad in London. It was such a refreshing drink and paired well with the gingerbeer and lime. \n\n- Brunch punch: Definitely on the stronger side of things but it was just as tasty and even had a sprig of rosemary in the drink. \n\nIt wasn't too pricey for all we got which ended up  being around $60 with drinks.

I enjoyed a beautiful and healthy Mahi Mahi dish and my mom devoured her pork belly with brown rice dish. The presentation and the flavor of both dishes - wow! I never knew quinoa could taste (and look) that good! What I really enjoyed was knowing how healthy everything was. There was barely any oil used to cook my fish. \n\nTip: Get their homemade lemonade. I went for the original, but the peach was also very good. \n\nThe girls working at the restaurant were super friendly and attentive. The only drawback was the parking situation.

I ordered the breakfast sandwich and the apple compote pancake to share. The breakfast sandwich came with a delicious biscuit and spicy house made sausage and fried egg with some peppery arugula that did a good job of cutting through the heaviness and grease. I really like their crispy breakfast potatoes with rosemary. Their pancake was to die for, super rich but fluffy and light at the same time. And the apples were tart enough to complement the whipped cream and butter and crumble topping. \n\nThe second time I came here for brunch, I ordered the basic breakfast which had all the same elements as my breakfast sandwich, minus the arugula. The eggs were obviously fried in butter, which I found to be too rich tasting. And the biscuit was dry and tasteless. The potatoes and sausage were still tasty, but who knew I would miss the arugula that much. Additionally, the pancake choice was strawberry rhubarb and they drenched the pancake in syrup to the point that it was practically inedible. It was way too sweet to eat; I was bummed. \n\nTheir redeeming factor is that there is plenty of parking nearby and they take reservations. I'll probably be back if I'm on a tight schedule, but I'd prefer to go to Plow if I have the time to wait around for a table.", "author": "Leslie H."}

The first time I came here was over a year ago for my first interview in San Francisco. I ordered a stone fruit salad with steak and I was VERY pleased! You can tell a lot about a place based on the way they treat and present their salads, and I knew instantly that I liked Serpentine.\n\nFast forward a year, when I returned with high hopes. I came with my boyfriend, and whenever we go out to eat, we try not to order the same things so that we can try more things on the menu. That day, the Prather Ranch burger was calling out to both of us, and thank goodness we each had our own burger! I really enjoyed the pickled onions (and since my boyfriend doesn't like pickled things, I got double!) as well as the salad, which reduced the guilt of me eating a burger early in the day and so much so that I didn't feel bad stealing a few fries from my boyfriend.

Pork belly was fried to perfect--the meat very tender and the fat melting in your mouth. The potatoes were deep fried, turnips roasted, and the dish was topped with greens, a bit of mustard, and two lovely poached eggs. The flavors paired up beautifully getting that fatty crunchy with an earthy radish, silky egg yolk, and bitter green. Overall, a great dish but not for the faint of heart... A friend ordered the huevos rancheros and thoroughly enjoyed the lightness and vibrance of the dish--light tomato sauce, fried eggs, beans, and tortillas. Another friend had the eggs benedict over biscuits and enjoyed the dish.

It holds it together.  It covers you when you aren't ready for the show but you know you should have been prepared.  On a good night, it makes you Tom fucking Hanks winning the Oscar.  Unfortunately, this bun is now limp and lacks any sense of it self.  \n\n2) No bacon, no cheese:  You no longer can choose what type of cheese you want on the burger or if you want to add bacon.  I mean, do you think you have 5 year olds ordering these burgers? \n\n3) No more truffle: there was an amazing time when you could add truffle to your Serpentine burger.  An amazing upsell worth paying for.  Whether its a high margin item off the menu or no is beside the point.  Short story, I am f'ing pissed I can't put truffle on my burger anymore.\n\n4) Condiments: the mustard isn't ground anymore.  I expect more from you serpentine.  Plus, they took away the 3 condiment side that used to be standard (ketchup, aoili, ground mustard).  That standard made me feel special.  More importantly, it made me think you were a special establishment.  This is a small thing to some, but it shows me the attention to prep has lost its way...\n\n5) The meat: when you ask for medium rare...jesus H, serve it medium rare.\n\nIf you have read this far, I am passionate about burgers.  But more importantly, I am passionate about Serpentine and what it has meant to me in my time in San Francisco.  It was the first restaurant I ate at when I first moved here.  I think its fair to say its special to many people.  It starts with the food before it starts with a remodeling.  You still have a chance Serpentine to bring that amazing factor back.  \n\nAll my love,\n\nX", "author": "Xan S."}

I arrived on time and I was assigned a table for 2. The waitress, she was not fast, and asked us what we would like to drink, I replied grapefruit juice, orange juice and a cup of cappucino. When I was waiting to be seated, I already saw the juice was ready and a jar of juice was sitting by the bar, so I assume it should be fast. NO, IT'S NOT!\n\nA couple sat next to me 5 min later, waitress showed up and asked her what they wanted. The waitress did not come back with our juice and she took their order. Soon, other waitress came back and served the girl with the orange juice she requested. I was like what the hell, your sequence was wrong. Finally she came back around 10:22am, with our juices and coffee, explaining the coffee was little slow.\n\nImmediately after that, in fact, entering from 10:00am, I have overly enough 22 minutes looking at the menu, I request to order, I order lobster and crab croquette, monkey bread, a side of toast, a side of biscuit and a side of fruit. And the table next to me placed their order as well.\n\nI jokingly said if the next table would get their food earlier and it was just like what I said.  10:42am, next table got their two brunches served at the same time. I did not get anything. Few minutes later, we got our large fruit bowl. I think that is amused, that should be easiest side/fastest side they could serve but they did not serve it until 1047am, despite that I have been sitting there for 47 minutes!\n\nFood was good, but I was so done. I don't have the mood to enjoy the food anymore. The crab and lobster croquette was very decent. The service is not tolerable. My last dish, monkey bread was not serve until almost 11am, but it was listed as the main dish of the brunch, not a side. What is the point of eating that if you serve the side dish first?\n\nHere is the few things that I don't like about:\n\n1. Serving sequence:If you have your juice ready, which I know you have a full jar already prepare, please serve it not until the cappuccino is ready. i am not sure what goes wrong but the serving time of your cappuccino is definitely below industry standard. Especially the next table ordered the same thing and she got it even faster than us. The serving of the drink delay the whole process of the order. If I knew  Serpentine served their drink so slow I would place my cappucino later when i ordered my entree. I approximately have 10 min delayed here.\n\n2. Serving speed: Again, it is very slow and it is very easy to tell when the next table order everything later than you and got their food faster. If I knew your monkey bread could come that late, which was a order I placed at 10:22am but did not show up until almost 11am. Believe me, I can go to the Neighbor bakehouse, which is just less than a block away and buy a Ginger pull apart which is a similar pastry, wait in line and come back and still faster than the monkey bread.

It's one of those places I've gone by many\u00a0times but have never had an occasion to go. After a walking tour in a nearby neighborhood, my friend and I headed to the Dogpatch to find food and drink. Serpentine closes between lunch and dinner but we arrived just after 5 PM, when they re-open. There was a chair blocking the doorway so we had to ask if we could come in. The hostess was reluctant and didn't seem to know what was going on. There were still supplies and stuff up on the bar, so even when she finally let us sit there, it still didn't feel as if we were supposed to be there.\n\nBut that rocky first impression was quickly erased as we were greeted and served by a delightfully charming bartender. The hostess gave us a happy hour menu but said they weren't doing happy hour on the weekend, the bartender said it was fine so we're not sure what the rule actually is. In any event, it means some specialty cocktails are $5 (instead of $11/12) but the food is the same price as far as I can tell, it's just a limited selection.\n\nWe ordered delicious specialty cocktails; mine was some kind of vodka lemonade with a sprig of rosemary and it was delicious. My friend had a cool cucumber drink with black pepper from the happy hour menu. Super refreshing and yummy. After our first round, I ordered one of hers. We ordered a hamburger and a cheeseburger with salads and side of fries to share, per our bartender's suggestion. The fries are ridiculously good. Beware! The side salad with the burger is huge so we had plenty of greens with our decadent meal. The local grass-fed burgers were juicy and delicious, though at medium rare there was quite a bit that was rare. Medium might be a better temperature to order in future. Not sure I needed the gruyere for an extra $2.\n\nYou wouldn't know it from the outside, but Serpentine is bright and airy. The windows are not at ground level; there are sky high ceilings with huge windows high up that fill the place with light while giving it the feel of a secluded spot. It reminds me of Nopa on Divisadero but without the crazy crowd. It was filled with bar patrons by the time we left, and was starting to get busy for dinner as well.

We took awhile to order since we were chatting due to the fact that we haven't seen each other in ten years, but the waiter was patient and kept checking in until we were ready. We started with mussels and truffles fries. The fries were a fairly large bowl which was filling for an appetizers, but it was deliciously seasoned and crispy thin. The mussels weren't really fresh, but the sauce was good and helped mask most of the oceany flavor from them. I had the main entree of the scallop and thought it was a perfect portion after the heavy appetizers. It was decent, but nothing exceptional. My friend's pork chop was too chewy for my tasting. Short ribs were flavorful and not bad, but again the dishes where were unique, but they were decent. We were too full for dessert so we wrapped it up early.

He's a 30-something who lives in the Mission, so he always comes up with something fun and worthy of a vacation meal, usually a recently opened hot spot. Hard to do, particularly for a large party, but this time, he got a table at Serpentine, for a party of eight, at 9PM on a Thursday.\n\nWe ended up being a party of nine, and when we walked in, it became clear that we were the only party even close to that size. They seemed a little stressed out about our extra person, but we squeezed comfortably into a group of clustered tables. The space was great--lively ambiance and trendy decor, faux semi-industrial with high ceilings. Service was solid. They took care of our unwieldy group quite well.\n\nIt's been a couple months and I was a couple drinks in when I got here, so to be perfectly honest, I don't remember the food and drink in tremendous detail. I think I had one cocktail, the Fall Back, made with mezcal, Ancho Reyes chili liqueur, Orchard Pear liqueur, and burnt orange, and I think I liked it.\n\nThe food was good. We all went in on some fried squash blossoms and bourbon glazed pork ribs, both lovely appetizers. The squash blossoms came with corn pudding and mojo verde, the ribs with pear and pickled pearl onion. The ribs were probably the best item of the night, tender and succulent with plenty of flavor. I had the fried Hoffman chicken for my dinner, served with cornmeal waffle, braised chard, parsnip, beet relish, and yuzu maple. This was a decent entree, if not the most viscerally satisfying fried chicken I've ever had.\n\nI had a great time at Serpentine.

Our wait staff were all attentive and helpful, and kept things moving along without rushing us.

We loved everything we had! The standout for me was the pork chop, which isn't on the Restaurant Week menu but is a sublime dish: the meat is flavorful and melts in your mouth and it comes served on top of amazing-tasting veggies and polenta. Seriously amazing. If you eat meat, I highly recommend this! The sourdough bread they serve is also noteworthily amazing (yes, even the bread is worth mentioning!). \n\nRe: the restaurant week menu, the Caesar salad and butternut squash soup appetizers were both delicious and creative takes on familiar dishes. The potato dumplings were comforting and delicious, and the seared ahi tuna was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The salted caramel pot de creme was exceptional -- super flavorful and delicious -- and the apple crisp was a buttery and gluttonous indulgence that we enjoyed as well. \n\nCocktails were good and there was a nice selection of beers and wines as well.

Made a reservation and were seated promptly despite the crowd.  \nServer was quick to take orders for drinks, being water and take food order. \nFood came out shockingly fast. I had the soft scramble and my dining partner has fried chicken sandwich\nSoft scramble was a bit too \"soft\", verging on raw. I had to mix it up a bit to let the residual heat firm up the runny bits. All of that aside it was virtually tastelessness. No taste of the mushrooms, charred lemon or the manchego cheese. The fris\u00e9e leaves had a nice, bright dressing that helped but I had to use more S&P than I remember doing in a very long time. The slice of slightly warm bread was delicious but would have been even better with a bit of butter (it was \"dry\")\nI did not try it but my friend seemed to thoroughly enjoy the open-face fried chicken sandwich. He ate every bit with the exception of a few of the nice, crispy, SEASONED fries that I nabbed off his plate. \nDogpatch Pimm's and then IPA were great. \nAll said, for what we got in think $80+ is a bit steep, even for San Francisco.", "author": "Us And J."}

So when the line at Plow was 1.5-2 hours long, brunch here sounded like a fine alternative.  We arrived, a party of four, around noon and were seated in a few minutes at a cute little half booth.  The menu looked incredible.  Everything was going well so far.  \n\nBut when the food came, it really didn't live up to what we (my boyfriend and I) were expecting.  We had agreed to go halfsies on our brunch, and I felt bad in doing so, because...\n\nMaryland blue crab Benedict (two poached eggs - hollandaise sauce - spinach - fried lemon - fines herbes - buttermilk biscuit - crispy potatoes), my order, was dry and too fishy, the bread was oddly cake-like in texture, there was not much hollandaise, and despite the fried lemon on top being fried well, all the flavors together didn't make for a good dish. The potatoes on the side were over salted and not crispy enough, and the greens with fennel on the side were fine and surprisingly not overdressed.  I've had much better crab benedicts, and I didn't want to even finish mine.  Not making any assumptions - I noticed the woman next to us had ordered this same dish and barely touched hers.\n  \nHuevos rancheros )two eggs - spiced black beans - cilantro - avocado - hen of the woods mushrooms - sour cream - queso fresco - ranchero sauce - corn tortillas) were also not very flavorful or good. They were, however, better than the benedict, but only by a hair. The flavor was fresher and brighter somehow than the benedict. The tortillas were pleasantly crispy but sadly it was brought down by the bland sauce. \n\nThe side of bacon we ordered was limp and not crispy.\n\nThe service was fine; it was just unfortunate that neither dish we ordered was delicious or satisfying. It just felt like a lump of unnecessary calories in my stomach, taking up room that could have been used by Mr. and Miscellaneous ice cream (located just across the street).", "author": "Christina G."}

I can have pancakes at brunch that aren't completely buttered and unhealthy-- yes, please!! These are topped with pomegranate, bananas, and apple slices as well as candied walnuts. They taste healthy, but I say that in the most delicious way possible. Not in a bland, overly oat-y way at all. I'll take an order of these.. every Sunday.. thanks.\n\nRed Flannel Hash: big chunks of tender beef brisket with beets, potatoes, and arugula and topped with poached eggs. This was probably the most filling entree we ordered. That beef brisket, though, so good.\n\nDungeness Crab Benedict: The crab wasn't as prominent as I would've liked. This was my least favorite dish we had at brunch since I've had better benedicts. Thankfully, the pancakes and hash out shined the benedict. \n\nWhy the one star deduction? Some might think this is petty, but other egg lovers will understand. The poached egg on the benedict and on the hash were not runny! Overcooked poached egg?! How am I supposed to snapchat #eggporn?!

Almost everyone sitting around us ordered these dishes too, and the popularity is well-deserved!\n\nSide note: I'm not usually a huge fan of beets, but the roasted beets in the Red Flannel Hash were so well-cooked and paired perfectly with the brisket.

The pieces of gristle were too hard to chew through and I didn't want to spit them out at the table so I had to choke them down. I could only eat a few bites, and brought the burger home. Later that night I got hungry and tried again, but had the same experience and gave up. The bun was great, the way they prepped and combined the toppings was great, but the meat itself was unlike anything I have encountered in a burger. I'm hoping it was a fluke and will probably try again, ordering something else.\n\nUDPATE: Came back here for brunch. Bloody Marys were great, but I wouldn't recommend getting it with the green chile vodka because it overpowers the other flavors. The crispy potatoes are as good as everyone says. Got the cornbread benedict with bacon and crab. You could barely taste the crab and it wasn't worth the additional $6. As other reviewers have pointed out, they purposely overcook the egg so there's no runny yolk to counteract the dryness of the bread. Thumbs down on the cornbread--it's slightly sweet and doesn't work with the savory of the rest. It would have been great with an English muffin and a runny yolk.

Needs more meat and less beets for a good balance. \nBiscuits & Gravy - 3/5 - The gravy was very good but the biscuits had the consistency of cornbread. Decent, but there are much better biscuit options out there.\nBuckwheat pancakes - 4/5 - Very good. Would order again.\n\nOverall, Serpentine made for a decent brunch. I don't think I'd go out of my way to come for it again but I will likely be back to try their lunch/dinner options. Brunch was \"A-OK.\"", "author": "Mark O."}

This part of town, while sleepy looking, has a lot of good and popular restaurants. You think there is no one, but you'd be surprised the moment you step into a restaurant for a brunch - they are almost always filled with people. \n\nSerpentine is known for their cocktails. Naturally I got a Bloody Mary here to try. It was pretty good, savory, but with not enough of a kick. We got the chilaquiles and the breakfast with house made sausage patty. The sausage patty was well spiced, but it had that weird pork smell - like how most of the pork in this country smells if not properly slaughtered. The chilaquiles were good though.\n\nI would definitely come back for dinner if not for more cocktails. The score is rounded up for the cocktails, but I think their food has potential. I suppose smelly pork is just a big pet peeve of mine having grown up with a mostly pork diet.", "author": "Alice C."}

I had the eggs, meat, potatoes, and bread dish while my boyfriend had their truffle burger. The portion size of the dishes were pretty generous and I was pretty full before I even got close to finishing. I really enjoyed how the sausage patty wasn't too salty as it seemed more healthy. The potatoes were crispy and delicious, while the bread was crunchy and the jam was perfect. My boyfriend's truffle burger wasn't as truffle-y as he thought, but we both really enjoyed his fries. The prices here are a little steep but it's worth coming here once in a while for a nice brunch.", "author": "Cindy C."}

I got the eggs benedict, which has corn bread as the bread part! I'm not a huge fan of English muffin, so the bread part is usually my most disliked part of eggs benedict. But having corn bread instead of English muffin, in my opinion, was such an amazing substitution. The dish got great portion but not too overwhelming. Excellent poached eggs with great hollandaise. The bartender was also super friendly and suggested a couple of places we can visit nearby since it was a super nice day.

I am so stoked on brunch reservations now - it's like I can't really imagine going back to the life where I wait two hours without a drink for eggs in the blazing sun. Of course I will have to at some point, and I shudder just thinking about it. \n\nWe were promptly sat at a pretty sick table in the corner. We started with brunch cocktails, naturally. A Pimm's Cup for me, which was refreshing and delicious, and a tequila cocktail for him. I do not do Tequila cocktails at brunch, unless we are in an establishment that willingly selects Def Leppard for its musical stylings. \n\nI ordered the brunch burger, which is an odd choice for me. But we were running late for the reservation, and I was starving by the time we got there, and sometimes a burger just hits the spot. And did it ever. Serpentine's burger is a must-have. I ordered it with cheddar cheese (in retrospect, I should have had Gruyere and cheddar, but oh well), cooked medium, with fries (and not salad for god's sake. Why are you going to ruin a perfectly lovely burger with a side salad? If you're going to do a burger, do it right.)  My goodness, that burger was amazing - it was just cooked so beautifully - juicy, delicious, wonderful. The bun did not disappoint (9 times out of 10, when a burger sucks, it's because of the bun), and the fixings (I think, pickled veggies) worked perfectly. I want to do it again. And again. \n\nMy boyfriend was less pleased with his dish, the biscuits, steak and gravy, but since this is my review and not his, five stars. Also, he ate half of my perfectly-cooked burger for his 157th career assist. \n\nTo finish, I had a lavender cocktail with elder-whatever blah blah blah hipster cocktail. But it was great. I followed it with a double espresso. Then I took a long walk. \n\nYep, you want to go to here.", "author": "Sunny S."}

A quick Yelp search led us to Serpetine. It wouldn't have been my top choice but we were only a block away and decided to take a chance on it. We were seated after waiting only about 5 minutes. By then, I was practically ready to pass out from hunger. We strategized over the menu and agreed to share the Red Flannel Hash and Country Fried Steak & Eggs.\n\nThe food came out relatively quickly and I started with the Country Fried Steak while he started with the Red Flannel Hash. We had agreed to each eat half of the plate and then switch. I was enjoying the tender Country Fried Steak and the crispy potatoes that accompanied the dish were surprisingly flavorful.\n\nWhen it was time to switch, I realized that he hadn't said much about the Red Flannel Hash. Then I took a bite and I realized that I had just traded away the better dish. If it wasn't a first date, I would've pulled the plate back and said \"sorry!\" Despite the hype around the Red Flannel Hash, it's just not very good. The beef brisket, which was arguably the most important component of the dish, was tough and bland. The beets did not go well with the meat.\n\nDespite the slight disappointment with Red Flannel Hash, I was pleased with the experience.

Called on the phone at 11AM on a Sunday morning, and they told us the wait would be ~30 mins if we walked in for a party of 3 (reservations are not allowed less than 2 hours prior) so we decided to go. They wouldn't put our name down on the waiting list, fine.\n\nGet there at 11:45AM , and suddenly the wait jumps to 1 hour. Fine, slightly annoying, but we did get there 45 mins later, and there were 2 parties ahead of us in the line, plus they had their reservation system. We sat at the chairs in the entrance of the restaurant, waiting for a seat.\n\n40 minutes or so pass by, and it looks like we're gonna be here for a while. They said some seats opened up at the bar, so we could take those if we wanted. We decided to do that because we wanted to eat (can't brunch ever be no-nonsense and simple?). Sat down, ordered our food, and we start to eat. By now it's passed the typical rush hour for Sunday brunch and the restaurant starts to die down.\n\nThere are a few tables that open up, so I asked the waiter if we could switch to a table instead of sitting at the bar. She informed me that \"we usually do not do that\" and that \"they might have reservations, but they could check for me if they were free\". It's almost 1:30PM, there are 2-3 tables that have been empty for some time now, why you gotta be like that? Are your tables really so precious? What do you mean you don't \"do that?\" Is my request really so ridiculous?\n\nAnyways, after she talked to the hostess, we were informed that those tables were reserved and they couldn't do anything to accommodate us. Ok, honestly, if that's the case, fine. But what drives me crazy is that when we left around 2:30, those tables were still empty. There were multiple tables that were unused, and even though I asked politely to sit at a table, they don't \"do that\". I guess they don't \"do\" half-decent customer service. I feel like this was my biggest gripe - their table management and asinine reservation system. Suggestions: If you're gonna have a reservation system, let people reserve closer to the time, or just get rid of it completely for brunch. Leaving tables empty for the sake of accommodating people that don't make their reservations during one of the busiest time of the week makes little sense to me.\n\nFood was alright. Customer service was off-putting. All service people look so goddamn unhappy, I think small mannerisms built up my frustration. This was just the biggest gripe I had.", "author": "Albert C."}

However today for the first time we came to serpentine with some friends and our 1 year old son, who was sleeping in his stroller. The server woman was rude, unaccommodating and inconsiderate. We were told that we could not eat with our son in the stroller and my husband and I essentially took turns eating with our friends while one of us has to be outside with our son. Several tables which were more suited to a stroller opened up but the server was completely unwilling to make it work for us. We have been to 100 different restaurants with our son and never been treated in such a poor manner. It's really sad when a restaurant cannot accommodate a baby. I think that's a reflection of the poor quality and lack of sophistication of a person and restaurant. A kind gesture towards a family with a child goes a long way which was completely lacking here. We are certainly not supporting this restaurant anymore, there are plenty of other places where the staff are kind and accommodating.

Fortunately, our post-noon brunch wait was only 15 minutes. The service here ain't sparkling--no, they won't let you split half fries-half salad; no, they won't cut your burger in half for you. Doesn't hurt to ask, kinda hurts to get rejected. That's life, no?\n\nThe boy got the $17.50 Dungeness crab Benedict: two poached eggs on buttermilk biscuits, topped with hollandaise sauce, spinach, fried capers & lemon, and herbs, served with a side of crispy potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/serpentine-san-francisco?select=4w3ceH2V1eJjNHpIJ5p6lA#4w3ceH2V1eJjNHpIJ5p6lA).

The $13.50 Prather Ranch hamburger was topped with arugula, pickled red onions, and housemade pickles, cushioned in an Acme roll and served with your choice of french fries or greens (but not both, evidently).

Started the sentence with \"back in the day\" to describe Dogpatch is a sure sign of aging. These were once young girls who would not leave Cow Hollow or the Marina because there were no cabs available on Sunday mornings, it was way before Uber and Lyft showed up and way before people met online. These women met prospective dates through friends of friends, a big incestuous pool covering a few neighborhoods: Cow Hollow, Marina, Telegraph Hill, Russian Hill, Pac Heights and North Beach. It was quickly decided that good ones were swiftly taken and the bad ones forever got tossed back into the pool. \n\nFinally the struggle was complete and children after children later, they became ladies who lunch. They do FB but not Twitter nor Instagram; they talk about play dates and the difficulty of getting pregnant again in their 40s; and yes, they gossip about divorces and the \"THAT\" mother in their kids' elementary schools. You know, the one who's dialed in and get into everyone's business, but still so helpful in so many ways. City girls are now mothers with houses in the East Bay, Marin and Peninsula, notwithstanding the last one, who against all odds, stayed but moved to Inner Richmond, because Peabody is a better elementary school than that Catholic school in North Beach. \n\nStill, no matter how old these ladies get, they must find good places to brunch like the Sex and the City women did. They must because what else is left but that occasional escape from being a wife and mother? \n\nIncoming Serpentine who is rumored to offer great brunches in a neighborhood that has parking. You see, no matter how old you get, Marina and Russian Hill are still hard to find parking in.\n\nFood. Yes food is good. Always go for what the waitstaff recommends. Pouched eggs with crab meat, very seasonal. Fried egg sandwich reminds one of something you had in Nopa, and the beef hash was filled with beets on the bottom and soft eggs on top. All delicious.\n\nIndustrial looking decor. A very young crowd. Not like the Outerlands, which is always filled with strollers, this is not for parents with little rug rats. Which in this case, is a plus. Service is very good. The coffee was filled frequently, and the water came with ice. Not to mention, they were superbly good at seating people right away - although, brunch reservation did have to be made over one month in advance.\n\nFor a successful brunch to end on a high note, one must examine the surroundings.

I was really excited to hear about the remodel/revamp of one of my favorite spots so I went as soon as they reopened. Actually I've been a couple of time (which is why I've waited to write a review). IT IS AWESOME! The food is AMAZING (see descriptions bellow)! I love the new space - the light is amazing (esp. from the new windows). They've always had great drinks, but the new cocktail list is really worth exploring.I'm one of those people who eat with others primarily so I can try what everyone else is eating so I'm going to do a quick rundown of my favorites:\n\n* THE BURGER, always considered one of the (if not the) best in SF is the same - they just added aioli, which if anything, enhances it's greatness!\n* Bowls for lunch? Yes! I ordered the pork belly bowl last time for lunch and loved the the crispy egg fried garlic combo with just enough spice from the fermented chili vin. I also tried the both the salmon & veggie - all of which had really nice flavor profiles and combinations. \n* Deviled Egg Salad is also a hit! Two of my favorite flavors (deviled eggs & Caesar dressing) together is a combo that was happily discovered.\n* Kampachi: I loved this! It's a fresh balance of flavors that was a welcomed on the warm evening that I had dinner. \n* I'm super particular about fried chicken and often skeptical about savory & sweet combos, but it was cooked perfectly and the spice really balanced out the sweetness of the honey. Plus, there's fried okra which can't be beat.\n* And then there's the pork chop. What a chop! Cooked perfectly to medium and as thick as they get. I didn't get to each much of the Carolina Gold rice though b/c my dining companion got to it first (there's always next time...)\n\nI can't wait to go back!", "author": "Daniel M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-23", "description": "Another hip little place in fierce competition with the SF brunch scene.\n\nIt has a neat ambiance, very industrial-themed with minimalist decor, accents of cement, and the telltale warehouse high ceiling.  They are also minimalist with the hipsterness--menus are on a cute clipboard but there are no mason jars.\n\nThe fact that Serpentine takes reservations is godsend, because the impossible Plow crowd plows up all my patience.  However, be sure to make the reservation at least a week ahead of time, because for some reason they only open up 20% of their tables for brunch reservations.  I was proud of myself for snagging a 1:30 timeslot and watching the OpenTable reservations quickly disappear, but then it felt silly to see several open tables when we arrived at the ungodly brunch-almost-turned-linner hour.\n\nBAKED EGGS, $12.50 (two eggs, spiced garbanzo beans, spigarello, roasted summer squash, hen of the woods mushrooms, roasted cherry tomato salsa, rosemary salt, with toasted levain): Some previous reviews warned that that this was underwhelming, but it sounded unique enough that I decided to give it a try.  It was not mind-blowing, but I liked how it was lighter and vegetarian, compared to all the typical food coma-inducing bacony brunch fare.  I think they need to work on the composition though--there is nothing in the mix to soak up the glorious runny yolks, so it ends up being a greasy puddle.  (Perhaps brown rice would be good for this... mmm, breakfast bibimbap)  Also, the mushrooms were scant and there was an overload of garbonzo beans--tasty, but it got tiring to eat because the beans were so pungent and chewy.\n\nRED FLANNEL HASH, $12.50 (beef brisket, crispy potatoes, roasted beets, arugula, horseradish cr\u00e9me fraiche, poached eggs, rosemary salt, grilled levain): A dish could not have a more hipster name than red flannel hash (FYI flannel is not a vegetable like I thought; it refers to the red potatoes in this dish.)  The beef brisket melts in your mouth!  The levain is a crunchy artisan bread which tastes delicious and looks good in pictures.  \n\nOverall Serpentine has solid, creative brunch food (plus rumors of the burger run deep), but I think my main complaint was the service--the server was flippant, minimally interactive and minimally attentive.  She clearly smirked at us judgmentally  for taking pictures of our food -_-;;  Jeez, we are only showing our appreciation for the food and the ambiance, plus we're advertising for free!

The restaurant was 2/3 full with a large party and the bartender was busy making drinks for them. I'm pretty sure they were one bartender short, so we were fine with waiting. When we did get served he was still (understandably) stressed-out. I got a lesson on why my cocktail, which was light and delicious, would not be summer appropriate (but srsly, it would be with gin). \n\nWe *really* wanted to order food and it took quite a while to even get a menu. And the food was not great. The citrus salad was full of very tough, bitter greens (dandelion, mustard) and large pieces of (pickled?) fennel, all of which were difficult to manoeuvre.  The warm olives are...a dish of olives.  Sure, fine. The mac and cheese was very soupy, with no crust, and overly-sharp cheese. Did not like at all. Loved the brussels sprouts--really crispy and flavorful.  Our bar-neighbor got bread; we had to ask for it.\n\nWe spent about $90 with tip for three $12 cocktails (all solid), two starters (including the aforementioned plate of olives) and two sides. No entrees. By San Francisco standards (ugh), it wasn't insanely pricey. But it really needed to be better.\n\nIf it were up to me (it seldom is), I'd eliminate the bar completely. It doesn't work well in the space. There are two pillars which make it feel very crowded even when all of the stools aren't full. Think of it like a stadium where half of the seats have an obstructed view. One end of the bar is right by the kitchen and there's no space for anyone to move freely or prep. There's a lot of rushing around. At one point someone was hastily folding napkins right next to me. It's just a really small space with poor layout, and I felt bad for the people trying to utilize it.\n\nTl; dr- If you're going to Serpentine don't sit at the bar and maybe avoid the small plates.

Ordered only oysters, fave beans, short ribs, and duck duck chicken plate.  Poured it over with very dirty-extra olives-Ketel One martini.  That was enough food for 2 of us.  Food was very fresh and tasted wonderful.  It is quiet loud in there, I guess the aquatics of the place.

Maybe the Serpentine strength is in breakfast / brunch. I wonder if Serpents are stronger in the morning. Server seemed a bit aloof, while pleasant and \"on task\" she acted like she had better things to do, she did accomplish the task at hand: to take our order and get it to the kitchen and get the food to the table. Surveying the tables, nary a millennial was munching, nuttin wrong w/ the middle aged+ Chardonnay sipping crowd, but the \"who\" in \"who is dining at a joint\" can be a temperature gauge of relevance. The bar is the center piece of the joint and with the many workers close by, I would guess that it is a popular watering joint; although directly across the street is the Dogpatch Saloon which dates back to 1912.\n\nHad a few appetizers at the table (calamari / chicken livers / heirloom tomatoes), they were OK, nothing that stood out, the portions just seemed skimpy. \n\nEntrees:\n\nHanger Steak: ordered medium (because I wanted to share it with my honey since we both had a late lunch), came out RARE. Ms. Serpentine Server offered to return it to the kitchen for a few more minutes on the grill, I decided to take the steak home and just order another meal - the Duck on a rush. While pleased it landed on the table quickly, it was a disappointing dish. An OK taste but a bit too mushy (yes Martha, Ima aware of how the dish is prepared - braised), even if braised it should require chewing. \n\nGnocchi - tablemate reported as OK, a consummate polite international student, so, not really sure it was enjoyed. Being young, not yet of drinking age and hungry does provide wiggle room for what is \"good\".\n\nRavioli - reported as underwhelming. \n\nNot sure what has happened to Serpentine, but RED FLANNEL HASH just ain't enough to impress diners on an ongoing basis. Seems like this joint needs a reboot. cltl-alt-delete. Refresh & UPDATE.", "author": "Matsuo U."}

They said it'd be ready in 15m so I biked over in 10m (5m commute) and like clockwork, just as promised, it was ready to go. The guy who greeted me (tattooed guy behind the bar) was really nice and didn't hurry me since I was only doing pickup, he saw I was sweating from the bike ride and immediately offered me water and even refilled it as he was processing my payment. Most places try and get you in an out as fast as possible when making a to-go order and never ask if you need anything (besides utensils and what not).\n\nThe Goods:\nBetween the pickled onions, yellow tomato and crispy (but not overcooked or dry) bun, the crunch in this burger was perfect. The meat itself was cooked to perfection and definitely quality. The blue cheese was an added bit of flavor that the burger didn't even need (yet it was very much appreciated). Fries were thinly sliced and salted just right. Kind of like (dare I say it) a better version of McDonald's fries. The bun really stood out as well. It was really fresh and buttered nicely. I literally could have eaten the bread from the bun alone as an appetizer. All in all, each piece of this meal was good enough to stand out yet complimentary enough to all work together. \n\nFunny thing is, lunch/dinner isn't even what this place is known for (based on yelp), which only makes me want to come for their brunch and breakfast even more.

I've heard about Serpentine's burger and told burger enthusiastic bf so we knew we had to get it. \n\nWe both ordered the Serpentine burger and added bacon ($15 total), cooked medium w/no pickles.  I love how they use Acme bread for the bun, but the bun is bigger than the burger patty.  My burger was cooked a little more on the medium well to almost well done side however.  It was hot and juicy but started getting dry after eating half of it.  I enjoyed the pickled onions and arugula as well.  There was a little too much arugula though.  The fries served with the burger were perfectly crispy.  The bacon was so crispy and salty as well; they didn't skimp on it.  \n\nService was fine and straightforward.  I honestly expected Serpentine to be bigger, but it is a little on the small side.

(Hence...the reason I prefer a small menu).  However, the downside to a small menu was I am not a red meat eater and only one fish and one chicken main entree. I didn't want chicken and scallops didn't jump out at me.  So, the two of us just opt'ed for a bunch of appetizers, soup, salad and of course martinis.  We even had a couple desserts. We shared everything.  The Brussels sprouts were one of the best I have had and yelp reviews steered me right with the hush puppies.  Soup was a meal in itself.  Salad was delicious, portions were generous and everything fresh.  Desserts were amazing...red velvet lava cake and our other was salted Carmel something.  I wanted to lick my plate.  (I recommend not passing on desserts).  I was glad we went the route of NOT ordering entrees bc we were able to try more things. One noticeable and annoying thing was I felt too rushed when asking questions about the menu and placing our order.  I never take long as I respect the server's time, so this should actually be a star deduction but I will let it go this time.  We were never rushed through our meal...it was only when the main server came by.  It is a trendy beautiful restaurant. Unfortunately, we sat pretty close to the front door and it tended to be very cold each time the doors opened and closed.  It was a cold night. I put my jacket on and off through dinner.  For this reason and...If given the choice I would have preferred a different section of the restaurant. It is a popular place therefore I also suggest making reservations.  Parking wasn't too difficult, we found a spot after driving around twice.  I look forward to a return visit next time in SF and I highly recommend.

I usually steer away from beets but haven't really tried it enough times to really form a clear opinion on it so ordering this was kind of a gamble for me. I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was! The beets were perfectly roasted and tasted sweet and buttery. The potatoes were perfectly done, crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside.

My friends and I had a reservation for 11:30, which we were late for by about 10 minutes. Despite that, we were seated immediately.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a pretty chill atmosphere. It's relatively small, but doesn't feel cramped because of high ceilings and lots of natural light. There's also an extensive bar, if you guys want to get a little buzzed to start your day off right. Our server paid just the right amount of attention: she came by often enough to make sure the food was okay and that our waters were full, but didn't come by so often that she would interrupt conversation.\n\nThe food was pretty good; the part of my meal I enjoyed most was surprisingly the potatoes. Usually I'm kind of \"meh\" when it comes to potatoes, but these were delightfully crispy on the outside but soft potato-ey goodness inside. They were well seasoned as well. Portion sizes were fairly large, with no one in our party able to completely clean their plates. I got the crab cake benedict, which I did not really taste the crab cake for unfortunately.  However, I did enjoy the cornbread and the eggs were done perfectly.\n\nParking in this area is not too bad. If you go a block over from 3rd, you should find lots of (FREE) parking, quite the rarity in San Francisco these days.

He was right, the thing exploded with meat juice once cut in half. Made me wish I didn't have to split it so my mouth could experience that glorious beef bomb.  \n\nThe airy and soft bun easily gave way to the almost aged/gamey flavor of the beef. Very good. The burger reminded me a lot of Slow Club's, later found it's the same owners.\n\nThe light and crisp fries dusted with herbs were good too. Not as good as Chez Maman's but similar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-26", "description": "Though this hole-in-the-wall off 3rd Street was far from easy to get to, the trek through the city was well worth it for the atmosphere, the menu's offerings, and the service.\n\nHaving been my first time here (and, mind you, the kickoff to my winter break), I couldn't not start the meal --- and the morning --- with a cocktail.  I opted for a sparkly, refreshing mix, Monice's Shrine, which was the perfect fix for anyone gin-and-grapefruit-lovin'.  I had a sip of the Whiskey Smash, but drinking an entire glass of this might have been regrettable. Cocktails? Yes.\n\nIt's hard to tell if Serpentine is known exclusively for their brunch, but the menu was, without a doubt, lusher than many breakfast spots I'd been too recently.  Lucky for me, going out with a couple of food-loving roommates, I was able to get a taste of three different dishes, starting with my own: Frittata, Fried Egg Sandwich, and Red Flannel Hash.  \n\nThe Frittata was super clean, filled with friend turnips, carrots, and fontina cheese --- the flour-less dish would have been a great option for anyone Gluten-Free.  This in it of itself is also my one complaint; like, where is the crispy, doughy crust of the egg dish?! \n\nThe Fried Egg Sandwich, which I only tried a bite of, is what one would expect from the classic breakfast sandwich, but it almost seemed overly bready, which, don't get me wrong, isn't always a bad thing.  \n\nThirdly, and absolutely the most unique dish on our table, was the Red Flannel Hash.  Made up of beef brisket, horseradish creme fraiche, poached eggs, and beets, the Hash was a colorful array of dynamic flavors, something I would recommend to the more daring diner.  Disclaimer: enjoying beets is a must for this one.  Dare I say there might have even been too many?\n\nI needn't forget to mention the starter we enjoyed as we waited for the entrees: biscuits and gravy.  This was, hands down, the dish that made the meal.  While I'm a fan of the classic buttermilk biscuit and decadent gravy recipe, this twist of the classic had a crispy-on-the-outside-fluffy-on-the-inside corn bread, and a meaty gravy that tasted homemade.  It honestly could have been a little bigger, but keep in mind, this was split between 3 hungry people.\n\nIf you haven't yet made the trek to Dogpatch for Serpentine's brunch, there should be nothing stopping you.  It's worth the commute, and if you end up having to wait a few minutes (we didn't have to), don't fret, just hit up the bar and enjoy the big picture windows and cool crowd of late 20-somethings.", "author": "Rachel H."}

They don't skimp on alcohol here, so if you're having dinner at the bar, you're going to get a good drink and great quality food. Just be prepared to spend a bit (entrees range from ~$20 - $30, so if you're having some sides and a drink, it'll be at least $45/person before tax and tip).\n\nCame here for dinner on a Saturday night, and the wait for a table for 6 was only about 45 minutes, which was fine, but I think it was shorter than usual because everyone was gone for Thanksgiving weekend. Service was prompt, and the fries (not twice-fried), brussel sprouts (very crispy), and cheese board was solid. The lamb cheek appetizer was particularly good. You don't get any of the gamey taste because of how well it's cooked, and it comes with a grain side (couscous?). Potato gnocchi entree was fantastic. The oxtail was simmered slow to the point where it was tender, and the gnocchi wasn't over or undercooked. The pork chop, though, was ridiculous. Excellent herb and peppercorn crust. Cooked so it's not even close to tough, but just right to the point where you can tell it just crossed from pink to white on the inside. Ambiance is low-key, but not so much that you couldn't dress up to get here. The only thing I wish would change would be a price change.

They were nice and sat us before our full party was there (I had a reservation), even though there were others on the wait for brunch. But once we weren't ready the first time our server asked us about ordering, it was extremely hard to flag her or anyone down for anything. She always seemed really brusque and in a hurry - I always felt guilty for taking up her time somehow. Also we asked for bread at the beginning and it didn't come until way after our food did..\n\nSpeaking of the food, that was actually pretty good.\n\n* Fried egg sandwich - 3.5 stars\npic: waiting on a friend!\n(leadbetter's english muffin - fried egg - arugula - dill aioli - crispy potatoes. $10, add $3.50 for house pork sausage, add $1.50 for gruyere)\nWe really could not taste the dill aioli - even asked a server (after not being able to locate our own server for a long time) who insisted the aioli was in the sandwich - we actually took it apart and looked and could not find any. Maybe a small dab on top of the bottom bun. But not significant by any means. Not bad, not outstanding, a good sandwich though.\n\n* Red flannel hash - 4.5 stars\npic: waiting on a friend!\n(beef brisket - crispy potatoes - roasted beets - horseradish creme fraiche - poached eggs & grilled levain. $12)\nAbsolutely fantastic. The beef itself was incredibly soft, well flavored, and there was tons of it. Add runny egg yolk to anything and I'm happy beyond belief.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-05-07", "description": "\"Would you like to start off with an order of fries for the table?\"\n\nWow - I haven't heard that one before at a restaurant. Normally, the server asks if you want water or an adult beverage. But I gotta admit, we were all impressed by the brazen inquiry. And naturally, our party of 5 said \"Hell YEAH!\"\n\nUnfortunately, the crispy French Fries were the best part of my Serpentine experience.\nLocated in SF's Dog patch, this is definitely one of those off-the-beaten dining destinations. Though based on all the positive Yelp reviews, it was a trek worth taking.\n\nHowever, after we received our order of fries for the table, things quickly dissolved. My co-workers and I were there for a lunch meeting. And the folks we were meeting with happened to be liquor reps (who work nearby AND have spirits on the cocktail menu). We all decided to throw caution to the wind (and embrace our \"Mad Men\" egos) and order a cocktail for lunch. This was all fine and dandy, except for the fact that it took over 20 minutes for our 5 beverages to arrive. And to be honest, these weren't complicated libations. In fact, none of the drinks we ordered had more than 3 ingredients. I kept looking around the half-empty restaurant and wondering what happened to our server and bartender. Were they on a cigarette break?\n\nFinally, twenty minutes later, we received our beverages. I had ordered a Negroni, which is one of my favorites cocktails. This is a drink that is equal parts gin, campari, and sweet vermouth. You really need to measure your ingredients with this drink. And these guys clearly didn't. It was super bitter and almost undrinkable. And for $11, that's a pricey snafu.\n\nFor lunch, our table ordered the burger, a few salads with chicken and/or steak, the short rib hash with poached eggs, and I had the chicken tikka masala sandwich on focaccia bread. I think my cohorts all ordered better than me. They all seemed pleased (though no one was really gushing about anything in particular). The salads really looked quite tasty and filling (note to self: order that next time). My Indian-inspired sandwich (which sounded great on paper) was underwhelming to say the least. The thick chicken breast was a bit undercooked. It really had no spice or heat. The cabbage and cucumbers it came with really didn't add anything distinguishable to the mix. The side salad on the plate was completely under-dressed. If this was a run-of-the-mill neighborhood deli, I wouldn't have minded. But Serpentine is a casual-chic restaurant with over 4 stars on Yelp. \n\nAt the end of the day, this place is fine. I'd be willing to give it another shot. But my biggest gripe was the service. There barely was any. It took us a long time to order our food and drinks. And then it took forever for the drinks/food to arrive. And even when it did, the server put the wrong drinks and the wrong dishes in front of the wrong people. Not once did the server come by during the meal to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything else - except to deliver the bill.\n\nThere was no love here today. What we had was was \"hipster\" food served by hipster people who clearly couldn't give a damn whether we were having a good experience or not. Given how off-the-beaten-path Serpentine is, I'm not exactly sure if I'll be making a trek back here soon.", "author": "Kevin B."}

The tables are fairly close to each other and you can somewhat hear your neighbor's conversation. Music was playing, but can't really hear it since everyone was talking all at once, so yes, the place gets really loud. The ambiance is nice with high ceiling- kind of reminded me of a warehouse/loft. The menus are on a clipboard and they seem to be printed daily on what they are offering only for that time being. They have a full bar with minimal seats if you decide to eat there instead of the tables. \n\nI ordered the Prather Ranch Burger (medium well) and it came with crispy fries, however they seasoned it with too much salt. The burger was delicious. Everything on it was fresh- arugula, sliced tomatoes, pickles, and their own pickled red onions. My boyfriend ordered the Cured Salmon Benedict and he devoured it within minutes (I'm assuming it was that good).\n\nThe service is OK. Our waitress didn't check up on us at all and not once did she smile. The only time she interacted with us was when she took our order.

The menu encompasses quite a range of dishes including huevos rancheros, smoked salmon eggs benedict and buckwheat pancakes.\n\nThose aforementioned pancakes?  Get them.  Crazy delicious and topped with an awesome combination of cool whipped cream, pineapple and pomegranite whose temperature, juice and acid balance out the pancake's contrasting qualities exquisitely well.  Not far off in second place, the fried egg sandwich and its layer of gooey gruyere and dill aioli was piping hot and damn good...even sans pork sausage/bacon.  My friends' red flannel hash and house smoked salmon benedict were both great as well and quite fresh, just not nearly as standout in terms of flavors.\n\nRegarding service, we were unanimously pleasantly surprised at how quickly all the dishes came out.

It wasn't too crowded, we originally had a table of 5 but later changed to 7, which caused our wait to extend from 30 mins to 1.5 hrs. We understood changing the amount of people would increase the wait time but who knew it would have tripled. Towards the end of our wait, parties that just arrived were seated immediately, which didn't make sense to me since we were still waiting for our table. I peeked in the window several times and saw about two opportunities where we could have been seated. \n\nDespite the unreasonable wait, we continued to wait for our table because this place was highly rated. I ordered the red flannel hash, which is the ONLY reason why this place gets a 3 otherwise it would be more of a 2. The brisket was real tender, soft, and teared apart like butter. The eggs were perfected poached. And I love beets which is why I got this dish. The only downside is that it came out room temperature, not even warm. It would definitely have tasted better if the brisket and eggs were hot. The salmon Benedict didn't have much flavor to it and it also came out room temperature. The presentation was real nice. Both the hash and eggs Benedict came with potatoes which were EXCELLENT. I loved their potatoes, that was the only thing that was warm on the plates. Nice and crispy exterior with soft fluffy potato goodness in the center. I tried a bite of their buckwheat pancakes which by itself I would pass on but their creme fresh was amazing. It was fluffy, light and not too sweet. It also definitely moistened the pancakes making them easier to take down. My friend liked her granola and my other friend said to pass on the country fried steak. His country fried steak wasn't warm either. Not sure if our food was sitting out for a while before it was served. \n\nService was mediocre. Staff wasn't extremely happy but they weren't rude. It also took some time until a server came to help us. We chatted at our table for about 30 mins until we had our orders taken. At least waters came out quickly. It felt like the food took forever to come out. I didn't actually notice the time cause by then we were all starving and what seemed like forever might not have actually been that long. \n\nAll in all, we waited 2 hours to get our food which tasted mediocre. Not hot or even warm. Room temperature to almost the point of cold. Will definitely NOT wait 2 hours for this place but I wouldn't mind coming back for those potatoes and red flannel hash.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I've been to Mama's in North Beach (it's know for their benedicts) and this place just blows it out of water. \n\nHere's the run down -- the sauce was rich and creamy, not too sour; the eggs were perfectly poached, with a super runny center; the sauteed spinach added depth to the dish (and a bit of veggie to make you feel better); the real crab is subtle but gives it an umami kick; and the kicker, the homemade flakey/buttery biscuit instead of English muffins. There's also a fried lemon slice and capers on top. The spinach/shaved fennel salad cuts the richness of the benedict and the fried potatoes is a great vessel of dipping into any left over hollandaise/egg yolk runoff. The dish is so perfect, it'll be tough to order anything else when I come here for brunch in the future.\n\nI also tried my boyfriend's pancakes.

It will make your life 100% better, mostly on weekends for brunch. \n\nThe things that were ordered:\nThe red flannel hash was amazing, the two poached eggs well placed on top of the delicious arugula and beets was almost just an amazing pairing. The eggs were poached to perfection with the yoke being runny, just the way I like it. I loved how the bread was toasted on the grill making the grill mark on the bread. The outside crunchy, with a chewy middle. To make it even more perfect, adding a runny poached egg on top. A match made in heaven. It seemed like a light brunch, but the crispy potatoes and the beef brisket made it a very filling meal. A def. must get at this restaurant. \n\nMy friend got the sausage, scrambled eggs, and potatoes and he was very satisfied. He  loved the scrambled eggs, saying it was made with care and it reminded him of Gordon Ramsey and his video on how difficult it is to make a perfect scrambled egg is. He said they def. hit the bulls eye on this. He was very satisfied after this meal. So much so that we walked (or rolled) all the way back to SOMA. \n\nAll in all, this place is an awesome brunch stop. The only con is that the service here needs work. We didn't get much attention at all by our waitress and I had to wave my arms really big in order to grab the waitress's attention, which is super annoying.

In the beginning we had great interactions with the staff, we even grew really friendly with a couple of the servers who would recognize us coming in.  It seems they've had a shakeup in staffing, or people just went their separate ways, but we've had a very different experience as of late.  A couple of recent examples:\n\nWe sat at the bar at kind an off time for a late lunch, and when the bartender asked us if we'd like anything, we asked if they were serving food at the bar right then, and he responded with a curt: \"Well this is a restaurant.....\", and he wasn't particularly friendly throughout the whole meal.\n\nToday, I ordered a burger to go, and when I got home, realized the burger I ordered medium rare was very well done.  The bun was clean and dry, so it was pretty clearly overdone.  We called to tell them, and asked if I could bring it back to swap for a medium rare one.  I returned, and two people asked me in a snarky tone: \"are you the burger guy?\" when I walked in.  The guy that I spoke to basically blamed me for it being overcooked saying that when you get it to go, it continues to cook in the box, all without looking at the burger.  He then said they'd make another.  I waited for just over 25 minutes for a replacement, and there was no apology for me having to come back, or for how long it took to replace.  He wasn't very pleasant.  I actually had to ask, because it seemed like they forgot about me.\n\nIt makes me a bit sad, as we've been big fans of Serpentine, and brought many friends from out of the neighborhood here, but after the last few experiences we've had, I don't feel like I ever want to return.  They don't seems to understand what good service looks like anymore, and the quality of the food just doesn't make up for the way you're treated.", "author": "Cliff B."}

I was surprised that at 1:30 pm on a Sunday, I had to wait for a table.

There was just too much going on between the quantity of bread, the large fried egg and the sausage. It was almost too much to eat all together. I did like the touch of arugula, cheese, and fried green tomato. I did like the potatoes that came with the dish - they were crispy and had a good texture.\n\nHouse Smoked Salmon Benedict ($15) - I had higher hopes for this, given that I love poached eggs and biscuits. This was supposed to be black cod instead of the smoked salmon, but they had run out. The hollandaise sauce was a little overpowering, or too much was put on, and the biscuit was the texture of cornbread instead of a real Southern, buttery, flaky biscuit.\n\nI haven't completely written this place off, and may be back for dinner and drinks some time.

Perfectly ripe heirlooms, just the right balance of tomato to cucumber so that it's not all acid or all bitter, a hint of shaved fennel and some herbs, and a vinaigrette that brought it all together.\n\nThe gnocchi were subtlety flavored and tender with a mix of roasted veggies and bacon cubes. There was a light caramelization on the veggies, like they had been briefly seared with a blow torch, and that gave the dish a hint of that marshmallows-in-a-campfire sweetness that was a pleasant surprise and somehow really complemented the flavor of the gnocchi.\n\nWe also had the hangar steak, which comes with a demi-glace reduction and chimichurri. Simply seasoned but perfectly seared medium rare, with a mix of veggies on the plate to complement the meat.

I know Serpentine has been around for three years, but because it's a converted warehouse with all its windows up high, I had no idea what it was about. There's also been at least one major turnover of chefs there, so that usually means a roll of the dice when you try a place, especially one that Michael Bauer dismissed as fussy in execution. I don't know what he had, but Jamie W. and I were pretty enthralled by the food we had there courtesy of chef Deepak Kaul. \n\nIt's an understated, dimly lit place that's not too crowded nor too loud considering how high the ceiling is. We liked it because we were surrounding by couples who weren't in an amorous state but honestly getting into the food they ordered. While we enjoyed some fresh Acme wheat bread slathered in butter, we decided to share a $9.50 Chicories Salad, a really nice combination of crunch and sweet (see photo). It featured all sorts of chicory leaves with a nice nutty crunch dressed in a fresh citrus juice. Pistachios provided even more crunch, the cara cara and blood orange slices provided the sweet. Herbed goat cheese was crumbled throughout. Tasty freshness. \n\nEntrees were uniformly excellent. Mine was the $25.50 Grilled Storm Hill Ranch Hangar Steak, sliced and prepared succulently in a medium-rare state. I twas accompanied by a pile of goodies - roasted rainbow carrots, creamed nettles, sunchokes, crumbled feta cheese, and fried shallots - all in a shallow pool of sage jus (see photo). As great as that was, Jamie's order was the evening standout, the $19.50 plate of Housemade Potato Gnocchi. Gnocchi can be a hit-or-miss affair depending on where you order it. Here it was perfectly cooked to a pillow-like texture and accompanied by a variety of pungent but not overwhelming flavors. \n\nThere were baby fava beans, hedgehog and black trumpet mushrooms, green garlic (my favorite), pecorino piccolo, oregano and bite-size shards of Nueske's applewood-smoked bacon - all of it topped with breadcrumbs put under a broiler (see photo). A really outstanding dish. We decided to share a dessert since we were impressed with everything so far. We went simple and ordered the $7.50 Dark Chocolate Bundt Cake, as old-fashioned as you would think but perfectly baked with a raspberry puree and sprinkled with chocolate malt crumbs. A big scoop of Bi-Rite Creamery's Chocolate Ice Cream was thrown on the side for good measure (see photo). \n\nDecadent but not overly sweet like the dense Pineapple Upside Cake at Wayfare Tavern.

The Huevos Rancheros and Eggs & Polenta - odd choices for lunch - must be popular hangovers from their brunch menu.  I considered, but bypassed the Bacon Melt (does one really need gruyere and fontina??) and opted for the Mojo Pork Sandwich whose menu description - or list of ingredients rather - is: \"savoy cabbage slaw - calabrian chili - pickled red onion - mustard aioli - english muffin - greens/fries.\"  Let's start from the outside in, shall we? \n\n- The bun - errrr, I mean English muffin . . . I think: Two bottom halves of a brioche bun do not an English muffin make.  Nowhere to be found was the slightly sour taste or the deep nooks and crannies (yes we all remember the Thomas's commercials) that define the English muffin - whose American home at one point, ironically, was San Francisco.\n\n- Mustard aioli: When the plate hit my industrial, brushed-metal table, I did a double-take and thought \"I didn't think there was cheese on this sandwich.\" But then I quickly realized that this mass of oozing, yellowish, semi-liquid goo pouring out of my sandwich wasn't cheese but roughly a quart of the mustard aioli.  I'll be the first to admit: in certain circumstances - as a dipping sauce for fried potato-based fried products, for example - mo' aioli is mo' betta, but not so much as a blanket for every service of a sandwich. And certainly not when it's neither very mustard-y nor very aioli-y.  A piquant Dijon mustard would have complemented the pork just fine. \n\n- Savoy cabbage slaw - calabrian chili: In my experience, cabbage slaws contain at least two - and often many more - ingredients: 1) cabbage, 2) at least one other ingredient.  This was the first one-ingredient slaw I have ever had (i.e. just cabbage).  I didn't know what a calabrian chili was before I ate this sandwich and I still don't.\n\n- Mojo pork: I am an unabashed lover of pork in all its forms from head to foot (literally . . . just the other day I had a lovely fried pig head and trotter sandwich at Belcampo in LA's Grand Central Market).   Additionally I am no stranger to the animal's adipose areas - pig fat can be transformed into magical stuff in the right hands.  I was looking forward to biting into slabs of mojo-marinated citrusy/garlicy pork shoulder.  Instead, hiding under the gushing \"mustard aioli\" was a glistening, quivering, translucent pile of unappetizing pig fat with scant pieces of actual shoulder muscle clinging on for dear life here and there.  At this point, after several unsuccessful attempts at peeling back layers of fat in search for some actual meat, I sent the sandwich back and asked the server to have the chef examine its contents for the purported ingredients.\n\nService\nThe bright spot to be sure. The sandwich's massive mound of goo must have made on impression on my attentive server as she graciously comped me the price of the sandwich.  Additionally, she customized one of the dessert items swapping out a chocolate chip cookie for one of their delicious pistachio biscotti.", "author": "Doug H."}

My bf and I arrived at 8:45 for our 9:15 reservation, really early. We gave them the benefit of the doubt, just ordered cocktails to begin with. I ended up getting the Acadian, it had Absinthe in it, and I was interested. It was a pretty strong drink, I enjoyed it and felt a good buzz but my bf didn't like the taste. \n\nAnyway, 9:15 rolled around, no one seated us yet. 9:30 rolled around, and we noticed that everyone sitting down from when we arrived at 8:30 was still siting down!  It was puzzling that no one had left yet. My bf complained, and they gave us FREE champagne since the wait was ridiculous. They then seated us at the next leaving table.\n\nWe ended up ordering the Brussel Sprouts and Chicken Livers. Both were delicious - I'd definitely get the Brussel sprouts again. It had crispy shells but soft centers as well; the best of both worlds!  The Chicken liver was good but a little gamey. My boyfriend loved it.\n\nFor entree, we both got the burgers. We heard about the burgers before from a Zagat article (http://blog.zagat.com/2012/11/sf-burger-guide-best-patties-by.html) and were very eager to try it. The burger itself was delicious. It's an upscale burger with your choice in cheese (cheddar, gruyere or point reyes blue) for $13.50, and is also topped with Arugula (yum) and an Acme roll (super good quality, you can definitely tell).  Fries were good too...but what made them stand out was the Ketchup. I asked why it tasted so special, and they said it was Heinz - but ORGANIC!  Quite a wow. Whenever I buy ketchup, I will purchase the organic from now on!\n\nBut overall, service was still slow even when we sat down to get our food. We didn't get out until around 2 hours later! Even when we were eating so late at night. It was just stupid. I might come back....perhaps for lunch.

My boyfriend got the eggs, toast and potatoes plate, while I got the country-fried steak and eggs. His dish was good but pretty standard--nothing that would distinguish it from the millions of carbon copies at other brunch places. My dish was more interesting and what I imagine a million wannabe-Southern restaurants wish they could create. The steak was battered perfectly (so crisp!) and smothered with the most amazing country gravy--thick, creamy and savory. The accompanying biscuit was HUGE and unbelievably moist and sweet, yet perfectly complemented by the same savory gravy in which it was smothered. The potatoes were seasoned, starchy perfection and the arugula was the perfect fresh \"green\" touch to balance out all the richness.\n\nNow the bad--the service.\n\nFirst, we were forced to wait almost 10 minutes for someone to seat us (despite having reservations) because there was no one at the host(ess)'s desk. Yet, there were plenty of staff members milling around with nothing to do but chit chat with each other. Whenever I tried to make eye contact with one of them long enough to gesture to them, they quickly looked away, as if afraid to do their job. WTF?\n\nSecond, when we were finally seated, we had the coldest, unfriendliest waitress. She seemed to hat everything about her job and never once checked in on us for the entirety of the meal.\n\nThird, our food was brought out by someone who was not our server, yet was equally cold and rude. In fact, our server never actually did anything else for us after she took our order except hand us our bill.\n\nFourth, it's not fun having to try to flag down someone--preferably your waitress but at this point ANYONE will do--for close to 15 minutes just to get your bill, so you can pay and leave for pete's sake. We're busy people with a lot to do, and neither of us enjoy wasting our time because other people refuse to do their jobs.\n\nThe ONLY thing that made this experience remotely worthwhile was that Serpentine is across the street from Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous, which I finally got to introduce to my boyfriend who'd never been before. But that's really a positive reflection on Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous, not Serpentine.", "author": "Josephine L."}

The chicken in the garlic marinated chicken sandwich was juicy and plump and paired very well with the gruyere cheese. I think the chicken itself could have used more flavor but texture-wise the sandwich worked out well.\n\nThe baked eggs were good, but I wasn't in love.

I did enjoy the novel mixing of mini heirloom tomatoes, eggs, and oyster mushrooms. \n\nThe crispy potatoes are like square versions of fries and fun to eat. \n\nPrice-wise I think Serpentine is a good value.

Quick service, hooks under the table for your coats and purses, and beautiful lighting prime you for an excellent dining experience!\n\nAny item on the brunch menu is terrific so far. The country fried steak was tender, and the potatoes are fried to a crisp perfection.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-05", "description": "Walking up to Serpentine, visions of a password through a peephole necessary to enter swirled about when inching closer to the entrance.  With an exterior resembling an actual warehouse in another life, one could easily mistake it for an underground club.  \n\nThey must save a lot on electricity with the dimly lit arrangement inside.  Most of the light comes from candles situated all over the place from table tops to wall crevices.  A relaxing vibe reverberates from each end of the restaurant.  With one side a bar full of chatty folk and the seating area on the other, space is economically used to the tee.    \n\nOUR ORDER:  \n*Asparagus & watercress soup - Coming down to this or the meat plate, we chose to share this.  The thought of the meat plate just seemed too overwhelming for the two of us.  The soup was very smooth and not watery.  The dimly diluted cream on top was very necessary and the almonds were definitely a nice touch.  The bowl seemed warmer than the soup if that means anything.  All in all, it was a good and light starter.  \n\n*House made potato gnocchi - A very cute plate with a pinch of pizzazz describes this dish to a point.  Bun picked this right away; I guess you really are what you eat.  Before she could demolish the plate, I sampled the a couple pieces and dabbed the dressing that it came with.  Execution wasn't pristine and I would have elected for the extra bacon for an extra kick which she did not.  Looking at the homemade gnocchi's consistency alone, they were excellent.\n   \n*Prather ranch hamburger - I bypassed all the really delicious sounding choices from the dinner set for the burger.  This burger went down every pipe from my mouth so cleanly you can feel the natural freshness of the ingredients.  The dark setting totally underscores the quality of the juicy burger.  I added blue cheese which was a little heavy handed and also the bacon.  I highly recommend adding the bacon for substance.  Bun sampled the portion I cut for her and she also thought the burger was delicious.  This is someone with a dairy allergy chomping on a blue cheese filled burger.  All the adjectives of a superior quality burger one can think of should be stamped on this.  One question I still have, why it cost a buck more for dinner compared to lunch is beyond me.       \n\nBest part of Serpentine is their attractive mood setting tone.  A collective of familiar and intimate at the same time describes its personality.  Food from dinner garnered as a whole was more than an arm's length higher than above average.  When ordering their much praised Prather ranch hamburger you'll get an ultra premium grade burger with a very compatible blend of fixings.  From our patron neighbors picks I was a little envious, but still glad I got the burger.  Next time, my next prerogative is to make an attempt at their brunch or breakfast which I also heard is very appetizing.", "author": "Arnold T."}

If any of these sound tiring, perhaps you've been going to the usual San Francisco brunch spots too long. For as much of an individual touch each SF establishment likes to put on their dishes, brunch hasn't followed suit. Rather the status quo has been to stand in line for 3 hours for yet another eggs benedict made from somewhat happier chickens raised in a slighly larger yard giving eggs with infinitesimally more warm fuzzies.\n\nWell, no more.  Serpentine turns all that on its head.  You will find your eggs benedict, but with a unique shrimpy twist.  You will find hash, but done as their \"Red Flannel\" hash with sinfully tender beef brisket and just the right amount of beets.  And you will find the polenta, pork and eggs, with polenta as good as any Italian restaurant.  There are several other menu options I look forward to trying also.\n\nWhat brunch is complete without delightful BEvERages? Serpentine's bar is seemingly endless, I had an Espresso Whiskey cocktail which was great - two of my favorite things in one. The Pimm's Cup was also great.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing is that there was *no wait* since Serpentine takes reservations.

And frankly the restaurant deserves better. \n\nWe were a family of four (2 adults, 2 preteen boys). We had waited 30 minutes outside for the restaurant to open on a Saturday morning. When the gate lifted and the waiting masses flushed inside the walkway, I was second in line and there were maybe 5-6 parties waiting behind us. \n\nThe host seated the first party, then approached me to ask how many. I told him we were four but I was standing alone because my husband and kids were just outside. He then said he couldn't seat us until everyone was here and motioned the party behind me to step in front. \n\nI then spotted one of my sons in the back of the walkway and called for him to come up and called out for my husband and other son. My husband came up. I then said to the host, \"OK we are here\" but then noticed one of our sons was still not standing with us. My husband said, \"We are all here but I have just asked my one son to stand outside for a minute because he is being punished.\" Ignoring my husband's explanation, the host then said, \"OK, so when you are all here, I will seat you,\" then went around us to usher in the people standing behind us. \n\nI immediately called our other son to walk up, which he did right away, and at that point a different host, who had been standing just 3 feet away the whole time, asked us robotically, \"How many in your party?\" and \"Are you all here?\"\n\nI understand that this is a popular restaurant and there is a seating protocol aimed at managing the efficient flow of customers without bottlenecks in service. But that particular host (dark hair, man bun) is executing on the protocol so rigidly, it's obnoxious. The bottleneck that he sought to prevent was literally one minute. One minute that was meant to teach our preteen son a lesson about proper public behavior. Instead of welcoming us in to be seated, to peruse the menu or order a drink for that one minute, the host preferred to lay down the law, send message of rigidity, and refuse service. \n\nThe only reason we didn't walk out was because we were there to celebrate Father's Day and did not want to ruin our morning.

She gave us a complimentary buckwheat pancakes (pomegranate - bananas - pineapple - candied walnuts - mead & mead's maple syrup - whipped cream) to start with. How sweet and nice was that?! It was really good and filling. We all had a small bite as we wanted to enjoy our dishes too. (I will give that a 5) The boyfriends both had the Country Fried Steak & Eggs (flat iron steak - scrambled eggs - biscuit & gravy - crispy potatoes - arugula).

Bunny said he'd make reservations. He listed a few restaurants and said I could pick. I forgot what the other names were but all I could remember was choosing Serpentine because it had a catchy name.\n\nPrior to our outing, I had browsed over the menu online. Since I had such a love for potatoes, the House Made Potato Gnocchi sounded perfect! Bunny had read good things regarding the burger and had his mind set up to order The Prather Ranch Hambuger.\n\nIt was a Friday night and I headed to the city straight after work. I was wearing my casual Friday Uggs and jeans. Not sure if there was enough time to change or being a bit lazy to bring other clothes, I thought I'd be fine with my attire. Boy was I wrong! The outside of the restaurant looked old and was in an area that was nearby the docks. However, the interior was a whole other story.\n\nWith dim light and a romantic setting with candles, I felt a slight embarrassed. After being seated, I felt better knowing that no one could really see since the lights were so low. We decided on the same entrees and decided on adding a soup. We picked the Aspargus and Watercress Soup. Remember an experience with ordering a heavy meat sampler as an appetizer and being too full to finish our dinner, we both felt a soup would be just right. That was a good start to our evening. It was green colored and had cream on top. We shared it and liked our choice.\n\nThe gnocchi was great with all of the potates. The texture was chewy and there was a side of dressing which added flavor to the dish. I enjoyed my dinner. Bunny's burger was so huge that it had to be cut up. Adding blue cheese and bacon added a special touch to the burger. The meat was fresh and it was a nice burger. It wouldn't have been my first choice because I usually have sandwiches and burgers for lunch, but I didn't mind trying some.\n\nThe presentation and dining had a nice feel to it. I wouldn't coming back here again to try some of the other dishes. All in all, it was a fun evening and great way to celebrate our 5th anniversary!", "author": "Doris W."}

The steak last for 4 bites although I will give them credit for actually cooking it to medium. The pork that came with the polenta  was stringy and unexciting. Everything else on the plate tasted dull and had a texture reminiscent of microwaved food.

Between the two of us, we ended up sharing the Blossom Bluff peach and apricot salad [ http://flic.kr/p/cfz9UE ], gnocchi with braised oxtail, almond torte, and their version of a New Fashioned (involving rum, cherry, bitters, and a few other things).\n\nWhile the gnocchi was a bit disappointing, because the pasta was a bit too mushy, with flavors that were a little too bland, the rest of the meal was quite enjoyable. The mint in the salad was a little unusual, but overall, the flavors worked together well to create a tasty salad. The torte, definitely the highlight of the night, was not too sweet, with flavors that melded together just right, to create an amazing dessert. The New Fashioned was a great drink as well, though perhaps a bit more a matter of preference, as it has a fairly medicinal kick to it.\n\nThe space has an industrial warehouse feel to it, which is neat. Service was quick and friendly, and prices were as expected, coming out to ~$38 a person after tax and tip (I believe I've omitted one dish from the aforementioned).

I understand that this place gets their vegetables from organic sources. But does that mean that customers should then happily expect bugs in their dishes? My friend got a small bug in her dish and she called our waitress over to let her know about it. She was courteous and matter of fact, and all we sensed from the waitress was that she wanted to make it look like it wasn't a bug or that she was trying to get out of the situation by making something up. But she was wise enough to halt mid sentence and then took the dish back to the kitchen. Then came out the manager or whoever and he wasn't helpful or nice about the entire situation at all. It really could've have been solved easily and pleasantly for both parties. But he was pushy and impatient. He first didn't even apologize for the fact that the washing wasn't done thoroughly and straight up blamed on the organic sources thing. Then he just said \"So do you want something else or are you full?\" when it could be seen easily that my friend only took a few bites of her dish. Don't assume that you can just half-heartedly ask that question and then be done with it. When my friend asked for the same dish again, but perhaps switch out the arugula on which the bug was found, the guy literally didn't even wait until my friend was fully finished before he just asserted that nothing could be done about that and asked to put the arugula on the side - it was definitely more of a command than a question. \n\nI don't care how good your food is, if you treat your customers like this then please don't expect, at least my friend and I, to go again.", "author": "Nancy Pian-Pian L."}

I highly recommend the dungeness crab benedict! It was super fresh and delicious!! My friend and I also split the braised pork and polenta which was sort of disappointing, but that might have been because we ate it after the benedict, so it was a bit cold. My other friends also got the chicken friend steak, which they liked a lot! One of my friends went to school in the south and said it was just like the chicken fried steak they make in the south, so that's probably a good thing! \n\nOverall, great place for brunch away from the crowds, and it's super hip!

Originally called in to get a reservation for my friend and I for 11am but ended up showing up right as they opened at 10am. Just the fact they take reservations for brunch (which rarely exists in SF) deserves 5 stars! Found street parking very easily which isn't unusual in that area. A few other groups of people were there too but it wasn't super crowded even as we were leaving later around Noon. \n\nAs for the food: My friend and I both got the single pancake with a side of potatoes (huge bowl!), coffee, and bacon for me. Everything was delicious!! The bacon was a little oiler than usual but still nice and crunchy while the pancakes were sweet but not too sweet and really moist. The pomegranate seeds were an interesting touch too sprinkled on top of the whipped cream. Added a bit of tartness to balance out the sweetness of the rest of the dish. I was so full by the time I left with a small take out box for my leftover potatoes (which was amazing!). The ambiance there is super relaxed and great service/ attitude from everyone who works there. I'd definitely come here again for brunch. Their bar is fully open for brunch as well and I saw lots of people at other tables getting the grapefruit mimosa so i'll have to try that next time. \n\nPrice: Worth it. Total including tip for the two of us was $40 but that's on par with pricing as other brunch places in the City these days. $2.50 for coffee, $7 for one large pancake, $3.50 for side potatoes and $4 for side of bacon (3 strips).", "author": "Deb Y."}

Not only was this meal created just so you can sleep in on the weekends but it's never complete without a healthy portion of starchy potatoes or a bread/pastry of some sort. Not to mention somehow the combining of the two meals makes consuming a cocktail before noon acceptable without appearing to be a huge lush. I noticed Serpentine when making one of my trips to Mr & Mrs Misc for ice cream. So I yelped it, read all of the splendid reviews and decided to finally make it out this way just this past weekend. \n\nI loved the former warehouse industrial look of the restaurant with high, paint scraped ceilings but yet bright and airy below. The restaurant was pretty efficient in having the table set aside for reservations as we were seated immediately upon checking in. \n\nI ordered the buckwheat pancakes (1 ct) and the gem salad. The buckwheat pancake was wonderful and was larger than I'd anticipated. And usually I'm not a huge whipped cream fan but along with the berries, syrup and the walnuts, I enjoyed every single sweet, nutty bite. The little gem salad was pretty simple but the full-of-spice vinaigrette dressing made it what it was with Armenian cucumbers, cherry tomatoes and slices of peach. C had the savory bread pudding which came with a side salad. I took a few gruyere flavored bites to sample his dish and it was delicious. They offer a pretty decent list of cocktails and juices to go along with your food. \n\nI'm sure I'll be back in the near future to try dinner.

In fact we ended up eating at Chocolate Lab http://www.yelp.com/biz/chocolate-lab-san-francisco,  which was great. \n\nMy friend was raving about this place so we decided to brunch there. When we got in we were told it was a 40 minute wait - completely reasonable as this is SF on a Sunday. The hostess then told us we could wait at the bar until our table is ready. We grab some seats, sit down and order drinks. 5 minutes later, the hostess informs us that we can't actually sit at the bar, as there is a waiting list and a couple wants our seats. Um, ok. So we tell her were still waiting on our drinks and we'll move after we pay. \n\nShortly thereafter, the hostess comes back and says she can seat us at a table, but we can only sit there for 40 minutes. WTF? No thanks, we say, we'll wait. At this point, I really don't want to eat here anymore, but my friends want to stay. \n\nThe people seated next to us at the bar are leaving, so the bartender says we can just scoot down to take their seats. Just as we are moving, the hostess comes back again and says, no, we can't sit there either, but we can stand at the end of the bar. I'm really pissed off at this point, and I tell my friend we can stay, but I'm not eating. Why should I support a business that would treat me like this? This is when the hostess comes back up to us and tells us that we can sit in the seats at the bar - the same seats she had just told us not to sit in, and she had the nerve to act as if she was doing us a favor. I am not eating here, I inform my friends for the umpteenth time. They finally get the point, and with that, we left. \n\nIf you are going to eat here, make sure the short chubby chick with blondish/brownish hair (and pocked skin, according to my friend) is not the hostess. She is terrible. The bartenders, however, are great. Kudos to them for trying to smooth out the situation.\n\nEDIT: Apparently I am not the only one who had a bad experience with the front of the house.

Reservations are recommended (it was busy on a Tuesday night!). Everything on the menu looked pretty fabulous, but there was only so much we could order. \n\nThe reviews - \n\nMarianted gaeta and castelvetrano olives: A mix of large green and small [light] aubergine olives that were perfectly salted. The green ones were a little sweet and balanced out the savory nicely. \n\nShaved summer vegetable salad: This salad consisted of arugula, summer squash, radishes, fennel, torpedo onions, ricotta salata breadcrumbs and a green peppercorn vinaigrette. The salad was light and didn't look like it had any of the dressing on it... but wow! What a salad! Sweet, savory, sour, and with a little texture. The hints of breadcrumbs were pretty much awesomeness in my mouth; they were the size of rock salt granules. Perfect.\n\nHouse-made potato gnocchi with wild mushrooms: When I see a menu with gnocchi or papperdelle, it's a must order for me. I haven't found the best gnocchi yet, but am en route to doing so! I have to say though, the gnocchi was pretty good. Smooth enough to want more, however not as smooth as I imagine the best gnocchi would feel. The creamy sauce wasn't too weighty as most cream sauces are. There was more of that awesome rock-salt-sized bread crumbs, lots of wild mushrooms, and some broccoli di ciccio (side note: \"broccoli di ciccio is an heirloom, old-fashioned kind of broccoli. It's sweet like 'regular' broccoli, it's what they developed the giant broccoli heads from. All stems and leaves and everything can and should be eaten. Chop the whole lot and cook as you would a bag of 'convenient broccoli florets' reference\") \n\nWould I go again? A definite yes yes yes! And next time I'll take pictures!", "author": "Rachel B."}

Well now, that does tell me that a table here during the prime time hours are hard to get.  Luckily, we got here after 8pm so we had roughly a short wait before being seated.\n\nThe dining room and bar itself is on the small side...I counted maybe 35-40 seats and another 10 at the bar.  The place has warehouse like tall ceilings with ceiling fans for circulation so I didn't feel even remotely claustrophobic.\n\nAs for the food, we tried their pumpkin curry coconut soup, the cheese pureed potatoes, the burger, and the gnocchi.  The soup was decent although with the taste of curry in there, it was difficult to taste the pumpkin although the soup was pumpkin colored.  The pureed potatoes were a nice soft consistency...not too rich in butter to make it heavy.  The gnocchi was served very rustic style with a lot of veggies and different flavors mixed in with the pasta.  The pasta itself was soft and tasted very fresh.  I'm not sure if gnocchi is usually served in this fashion elsewhere but I have to say that I'm a fan of this dish.\n\nI asked our server about the bread pudding and she told us that it actually was a savory dish, not a dessert.  Bummer!  A savory bread pudding wasn't what I wanted to hear but I wouldn't mind coming back at brunch here to find out!  \n\nLastly, I have to say that the front of house staff busted their asses working this night.  Being seated near the kitchen, I noticed that they didn't have any bussers to assist them so I saw a lot of back and forth jaunts from kitchen to dining room.  The ladies who I saw waiting tables deserved every cent earned.  \n\nI may likely come back to try brunch as my dinner experience was great.", "author": "Ben H L."}

I think the semi industrial yet hip setting is much better during the day, especially with the high windows and skylights.  Plus, the wait wasn't too horrible on a Saturday morning.\n\nFor breakfast, they have some more unique cocktails like the espresso/whiskey one, which my friend loved.  I loved Monice's shrine last time, and I had to get more of this during brunch.  Coffee has unlimited refills, which is nice.\n\nBrunch items:\n1. Crab egg benedict: served on a biscuit, good hollandaise, perfectly poached sphered eggs, and lots of crab meat that's well seasoned\n2. Egg sandwich: get it with pork sausage, make sure it's runny.  Not amazing, but not bad.\n3. Polenta and eggs: lots of soft polenta, fried egg, and pork\n4. Savory bread pudding: unique, lots of vegetables, served warm in a ramekin with a side of greens. The ramekin isn't huge, but it's quite the filling dish\n5. Burger: they wouldn't add the egg at dinner, but I got my sunny side up egg with brunch!  I also added gruyere, and it's topped with lots of pickles and pickled onions.  Definitely get fries instead of a salad.. they're thin, seasoned well, crispy\n\nI've always been a big fan of brunch, and Serpentine did not disappoint.

Probably the best breakfast potatoes I've had in the Bay. \n\nService: Nothing in particular about the service.

The restaurant itself is clean (lots of white wood, a bar, and metal chairs) and has high ceilings and plenty of light. \n\nOverall Impression: BRUNCH. RESERVATIONS. I'll say it again: BRUNCH. RESERVATIONS. You can expect a 20 minute minimum wait at any of your standard brunch places in SF, but at Serpentine? Plan ahead and you'll be rewarded with zero parking time and zero wait time.

It always signifies that you are in your weekend mode and its proof that you have an active social life (brunch should not be done alone). It can also set the tone for the rest of the day.\n\nLast Saturday we were able to hit up Serpentine.  The building was great, and fit in with the rest of the dogpatch, a bit industial with a touch of  modern chic.  From the outside there didn't seem to be that many windows, but inside it was well lit with natural lighting.  The windows must have been higher up on the walls.  \n\nThe vibe was definitely electric with the place being busy in stark contrast the quiteness of third street.  It was almost liked I walked into a secret place.  Everything on the menu seemed delicious, but we went with the Baked Eggs, Buckwheat Pancakes, The Red Flannel Hash, and a side of bacon for me of course (Neither Steph nor Jenn touched it...hopefully not out fear that I would slap their hands...haha).  \n\nAll the food was prepared well with delicate flavors.  Each element of each dish stood out on its own.  A dash of salt made it perfect.  The Baked eggs were okay, not the greatest dish ever.  The Red Flannael Hash with the corn beef and potatoes swimming in a crimson tide of beet juice was on point.  The highlight for me (other than the bacon, which is always a highlight anywhere) were the Buckwheat Pancakes...light and fluffy and covered with Candied Walnuts and Strawberries with some Creme Fraiche!  Amazying!  \n\nThis was a great place for brunch...I need to hang out in the Dogpatch more!", "author": "Veasna H."}

As we entered, there was no one to great us at the host stand so we stood awaiting further instructions. The host came over after a few minutes and found our res and took us to our table which a booth at the far end of the restaurant. There was a crowded bar and not too many tables. I liked our table in that it was pretty secluded with walls on all 3 sides. \n\nThe server was nice but I wasn't sure if she was a tad passive aggressive. I'll assume it was just me because the service was great overall. \n\nMy friend ordered oysters and out came 2 of the smallest oysters we have ever seen. Then came our Meat Board appetizer. The \"board\" was smaller than my kindle. However, when our entrees arrived we were pleased to find that they were normal sized entrees and not minis like our appetizers. \n\nMany people on yelp raved about the burger so I got that with fries. The burger was cooked medium and it tasted superb! My other friend ordered the gnocchi which I tried and thought was ok. I thought it tasted a bit bland. \n\nWe had told the server that it was our friend's birthday, and she brought out a small birthday dessert for her with a candle but she charged us for it. It would have been a nice gesture if she didn't..! \n\nOverall the ambiance was pretty casual with dimmed lights. The bill for 5 came up to $160.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-01", "description": "When I jumped on this zero/reduced beef kick, one of the first things I started to crave for was a burger.  Now, I'm not talking about just any burger you can get at a fast food joint.  No, I'm talking about a real, legit burger that's been all gussied up and done right.  The type that just oozes quality when you bite into it, and filled with fresh condiments.  The kind of burger where you know the cow from whence the meat came died for all the right reasons, with cheese that doesn't feel like its been made into a sheet and squared.  No, I'm talking about a real burger....am I making you hungry yet?\n\nEnded up coming out to Serpentine with a few of my buddies so that we could specifically try their offering of said burger.  After one of them found it listed on the 7x7 list of best burgers in the city, we obviously had to put them to the test.  And although briefly perusing the menu revealed a few other dishes that seemed rather appealing, we were all pretty set on what we were going to get. - four Prather Ranch burgers, beers, and their meat board starter.\n\nThe meat board appetizer included five varieties of charcuterie (duck prosciutto, duck liver mousse, speck, piccante salami, and spicy coppa) with some pickled green beans, mustard, and grilled levain toast.  Overall, it was pretty decent and tasted about how you would expect...hard to mess it up though.  However, I liked that the duck prosciutto was on there for something a little different.  Oddly enough, my favorite part of the order was actually their grilled levain toast...some of the best bread I've had!\n\nAs for the burger, I don't know how it compares overall to the other entries on the 7x7 list (Spruce and Marlowe come to mind), but I liked what I had.  Served on an ACME roll with arugula, pickled onions, homemade bread 'n' butter pickles, a slice of gruyere I added and fries, it was definitely a hefty plate of food.  The patty was pretty thick and juicy, and I was impressed it was cooked just as I ordered.  Though it was seasoned well, it was actually the gruyere and pickled onions that brought the best out of the burger for me.  The gruyere is a nice change from the usual cheeses you get, and that twang from the onions was a perfect complement.  A little messy from the juice/oil, but it was delicious.  \n\nAs for Serpentine itself, it was pretty hard to find something to complain about.  Our waitress was awesome, really friendly, and made some great beer suggestions when it came time to order. The restaurant itself has a unique personality top - a nicer, casual sort of feel (if that makes sense to you like how it does to me, then you get a gold star), but in a warehouse sort of environment (high ceilings, wide open, commercial type of space).  Definitely plus points for both.\n\nI knew that at some point during this pledge, I was likely to breakdown and have myself some beef.  While I've been disciplined for the most part, one can only stave off those cravings for so long.  I'm just glad that Serpentine was about to help me cave the right way.  After all, if you're going to get caught stealing a car, you don't want to get caught breaking into some janky ride, do you?  Four stars for now until I have something comparable to compare it to, but I definitely want to come back to give brunch a shot!", "author": "Mike L."}

Celebrating my honey's birthday, we started off with cocktails at the bar as we waited for our table.  The Smokey Bandit cocktail was the perfect way to start the evening.  The drink was a little sweet with a bit of smoke.   \n\nCrowning my honey with a red sequin Santa hat (I couldn't find a king's crown), we all wore similar Santa hat in different colors (silver, gold, and green). The wait staff loved us and said we were the most festive bunch that evening. On to the meal. \n\nWe shared the meat plate, cheese plate and the sweetbread dish. The meat plate consisted of 4 different cured meats and liver pate. The liver pate was just divine.  The sweetbreads were fried to a nice crisp. My honey said it tasted like KFC, which is a good complement.   The cheese plate consisted of a  substitute cheese of goat and  cows milk, as they ran out of the original one. It still was a slight pungent and salty, which I liked.  \n\nWe all ordered the steak dish for our entree. Mines rare (of course) was deeeeeeeeeeeeelicious!   I finished that meat as if there was no tomorrow.   Seared on the outside, raw in the middle....as the French would say, \"Bleu\".   \n\nDessert, we shared the ginger cookie sandwich, chocolate cake and bread pudding. All the desserts were delicious, but it was the ice cream that accompanied the desserts that won me over.

Perfect casual place for yummy, hearty food!  I had the \"Eggs-meat-potatoes-bread\" with 2 slices of crispy neuske's bacon.  Simply named item that had a generous portion of nicely seasoned, crispy, cubed potatoes, 2 slices of grilled levain (a traditional French bread) that comes with homemade jam, and 1 sunny side-up egg.  Too bad I didn't order seconds because the potatoes were THAT GOOD!  I wanted more!  Dipping the potatoes in ketchup makes it even better!  The bacon came out well also; not too oily nor overcooked at all; both bacon strips were seasoned well and had a crispy finish, just like it's supposed to be!  The eggs were typical, nothing too special about sunny side-up.  \n\nMy little quibble here is that the bread, I felt, may have been overly grilled.  Perhaps that's how it's supposed to be, but I had a hard time biting on my bread; I prefer my bread toasted or either plain (not toasted).  I find that much easier to enjoy, having less chances of wasting delicious food.  The jam, while I applaud & appreciate their efforts for it being homemade, and at least I tried it, I prefer a fruit jam over a floral-flavored jam.  There's something about floral jam that seems a bit strong for my taste; perhaps it was also my first time trying an unfamiliar jam flavor (I guess that's not a quibble, more a personal opinion).  \n\nThe amount of food hit the spot; enough room to enjoy ice cream (then again, there's always room for dessert) and keep us energized for our short hike up Corona Heights.

The baked eggs dish (which I've had twice) could not be more delicious.  Yummy benedict.  Perfect potatoes.  The atmosphere?  Lovely.  The service?  Well, at first she was friendly when we sat down, even when we didn't know right away what we wanted.  My friend and I were catching up after not seeing each other for a while, so we were chatting.  However, the mood turned chilly when we were mostly done but not letting her clear our plates right away because we were still nibbling.  Finally she said, \"Look.  The host wanted me to give you until 11 and now it's 11:30, so we really need your table.  People are waiting.\"\n\nI understand that we took a little longer than perhaps you were predicting.   Maybe our table was one you had reserved for the people who made reservations.  I think waiting for brunch at a great restaurant in SF is not that unusual.  But even if you blame it on the host, it feels bad to be asked to leave, so you could be a bit more diplomatic about it.  Tell me about how cold it is outside, how many people are waiting, how badly you feel about telling us to leave, but don't tell me that you've been generous with our time allowance and your patience is up.\n\nWhen we walked out, we saw 2 bigger groups and only 1 couple.  That twosome must have been destined for our table, since it was a tiny corner table for 2.  I hope they had a reservation, because otherwise I can't imagine why we were ushered out.  The food is great, but I wouldn't come back unless I knew for sure we'd eat fast.  And that's not why I go out for brunch.", "author": "Samantha G."}

Though this restaurant is super chic, sadly the food didn't blow me away. We ordered two vegetarian dishes - the shaved vegetable salad and the gnocchi entree.\n\nPros:\n* Great ambiance\n* Friendly servers\n* Unique dishes - seemed to have a lot of interesting non vegetarian options (which we didn't try)\n\nCons:\n* Vegetable salad was a little too heavy on the citrus for my taste. Though the toasted hazelnuts were a great addition, the strong lemon flavor combined with the bitterness of the arugula was not to my liking.\n*The gnocchi was very light which was refreshing and I liked that it was coated with breadcrumbs. Unfortunately, yet again, the citrus flavor of the sauce overpowered the dish. (We also substituted greens for the mushrooms which may have contributed to the problem). The sauce was lacking in flavor and was not as full-bodied as I would've liked to accompany the relatively bland gnocchi.\n\nThough I was not impressed with dinner (mainly due to the lack of vegetarian options), I would come back to Serpentine for brunch which is what most of the reviews talked about.", "author": "Vaibhavi U."}

We walked in without reservations and were able to snag the last open table. Serpentine is a tiny restaurant (table seating for 25 or so, communal table for 8 and bar seating) and I can imagine it getting busy during peak and dinner time, so it would probably be wise to make reservations. \n\nFOOD:\nI have to note that Serpentine's brunch menu is NOT diet-friendly; well if you're on a lo-carb diet that is. I spent nearly 10 minutes trying to figure out what I can get and what I can substitute out to make it somewhat healthy. Although the savory bread pudding with ham, gruyere and caramelized onions sounded divine, I didn't want to regret it later so opted for the Baked Eggs.\n\nBaked Eggs - Black beans, White corn, Squash, and Guacamole ($11.50): I opted out of the corn bread and added a side of house made sausage ($3.50). YUMMY! The veggie mixture was topped w/ two baked eggs and a tablespoon of guac. The veggies were tender, yet had a bite to it. The white corn was sweet and crisp and the guac was savory and buttery (I wish there was more though). However, the eggs were overcooked as the yolks almost solidified. \n\nIt's a good thing I ordered a side of sausage, otherwise I would have still been hungry. The sausage was very flavorful, it was salty and smokey w/ a slight sweetness. You can taste the fennel seeds, which gave it a mild liquorice flavor.\n\nAlthough my food came out fine despite the overcooked eggs, I have to note that my friend's order had an EYELASH on the poached egg! We didn't send the order back and instead the affected portion was just cut away. Talk about unappetizing... \n\nSERVICE:\nAlthough our waitress was friendly, she was aloof. After taking our order and bringing our food, she never checked in with us. She also messed up the order after repeating it to her several times. My friend specifically told her no biscuit and no potatoes on the Crab Benedict. Our waitress tried to convey that it comes with a biscuit and my friend had to repeat again, no biscuit and no potatoes. Yet, the Crab Benedict came with the starches. Not a big deal I know, but there's nothing worse than wasted food. *sigh*\n\nI had requested no corn bread and a side order of the house made sausage. 5 minutes later, our waitress said she can only substitute the corn bread for sausage for a fee. Ummm...I ordered a side of the sausage full knowingly that I will be charged and never asked for an equal substitution.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nSerpentine looks a lot bigger from the outside than it really is (45-50 or so capacity). I love the simplistic industrial design; rustic hardwood floors, ivory walls and ceilings, mirrors throughout and vases of ivory calla lilies. \n\nPARKING:\nVery easy street parking which was the main reason why we went here.\n\nSerpentine's food is 4-Star worthy, however because of the eyelash incident and the mediocre service I have to drop it down to 3-Stars. However, I would definitely return for that Savory Bread Pudding one of the days...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

So when it was dinner time and my boyfriend suggested Serpentine, I was down! \n\nNeedless to say it was just an okay experience when factoring service, quality of food and pricing.  Serpentine is comparable to Marlowe in price and type of food, except I'd hands down choose Marlowe.  \n\nThe service at Serpentine was slow, like really slow.  We walked in and got seated at the bar.  After some time we ordered out drinks, which were great cocktails, nice & strong!  Then we had some cold bread that was alright -- nothing special.  \n\nFor the food we ordered scallops as appetizer, hanger steak and of course the burger (I believe this is one of the entrees they were really known for). \n\nScallops were okay.  Appetizer sizing comes with three pieces. The sauce that it came with could have been better. \n\nHanger steak @ medium rare again was just okay. Nothing special and not anything that I wowed about.  The flavoring on the steak wasn't great and I guess I didn't realyl taste much to it except for the steak itself. It came with some peas and vegtables that were decent, but I would have preferred fries or mash potatoes to go alongside it. \n\nThe burger my boyfriend liked, but in my honest opinion, I just wouldn't pay that much for a burger. The fries were good though. \n\nOverall, the service was just lacking. I know they are busy, but it's not like this is a fast food joint.  I've sat at bar for Marlowe as well as being seated at a table and the service has both times been impeccable and personal.  Our bill was about $90 with tip, which is close to the same as Marlowe, so I'd say go there if you can instead of Serpentine. \n\nMaybe next time I just need to come for brunch as it seems there are a lot of reviews for this as well.", "author": "Suzie B."}

Serpentine did just that for me for brunch this past Sunday.\n\nFried Egg Sandwich (Leadbetter's english muffin, fried egg, arugula, dill aioli, crispy potatoes) - The texture whore in me was jumping for joy!  My anticipation was climbing as I assembled the beautiful layers.  The english muffin was toasty and crusty.  The fried egg was fried just enough so that the yolk was still a bit yolky without the risk of exploding everywhere upon the bite.  The arugula was fresh and crunchy.  The dill aioli was singing my name.  One Bite....... HEAVEN.  Also, they were not kidding when they said CRISPY potatoes.  These golden nuggets were crispy and crunchy.  \n\nCountry Fried Steak & Eggs (flat iron steak, scrambled eggs, biscuit & gravy, crispy potatoes, arugula) - The preparation for this country fried steak was unique.  It had a tempura-like batter making the fried steak almost \"light\" and airy.  It was delightfully (yes, I said delightful!) tasty - perfectly seasoned and crunchy.\n\nThe biscuit - I have to talk about the biscuit by itself.  Something in my gut told me to order a biscuit on the side and that something was sooooooo right!  This biscuit was fluffy and dense at the same time?  How is that even possible?!  The grill marks on the outside left a nice chewy texture and the fluffy and dense inside was mouthfuls of carb heaven.  Could it get any better?  Yes, I added on a pat... okay not a pat...

It was mostly pineapple and bananas, with bits of orange and strawberry. I happen to dislike pineapple and bananas so boyfriend got to eat most of it. My baked egg was really disappointing. I think I had expected a drier dish with tomato salsa on top of it per other reviews, but instead it was more like a watery soup/stew, topped with an egg. There were chickpeas, swiss chard, hen of the woods and *canned* tomatoes, which resulted in a watery and extremely sour/acidic dish. All I could taste was the canned tomatoes, nothing else. I didn't finish it :( Boyfriend said that the separate ingredients in his hash were great, but the dish was lost on him when he put them together. He didn't finish his either :\\ \n\nAll in all, pretty disappointed. I probably would've given a 2 star rating, but I know that dinner here is so good.

We finished every little single thing on our plate and felt like little fatties after but it hit the spot. \n\nThe only complaint that I had was that they were out of some things from the menu and when I ordered a mimosa, they didn't have chilled champagne so I had to wait a bit for that and when my friend ordered a cocktail the server came back to our table after about 15-20 mins of ordering the drink and said they were out of some kind of liquor so they couldn't make her drink but overall we had a great time and loved our food. I will definitely be back!", "author": "Daisy W."}

Even though I didn't have a reservation, the wait was minimal (maybe 5 minutes tops?). Staff were friendly and the interior is comfortable and interesting. \n\nI tried the Fried Egg Sandwich, having read elsewhere that it's one of their hit menu item. I also ordered the Buttermilk Biscuit which came with homemade jam. I'm a huge fan of homemade jam from Venus (in Berkeley), so I really wanted to find something at that level. Oh and a Ruby Mimosa to go with it, as I had recently fallen in love with mimosas.\n\nThe Fried Egg Sandwich was good, but a little too greasy for me. The bread was a little thick (I'm trying to cut low on carbs!), considering the other ingredients. Overall, I got the feeling that each ingredient was good, but the combination didn't really amuse me. The Ruby Mimosa was good but quite plain (it made me wonder why the Mimosa at La Note in Berkeley tasted so good). Maybe try again next time? \n\nI got the impression that Serpentine and Slow Club are operated by same management, or at least have a friendly partnership (since Serpentine had Slow Club business cards in their front desk and had a similar drink menu). Between these two, I think I like Slow Club a little bit better. However, if you don't want to wait to get a decent brunch, Serpentine may be your place.", "author": "Soo Jung R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-10", "description": "We made a brunch reservation for six people a month or so in advance. We picked Serpentine because of the multiple vegetarian options on the menu, the 10:00am opening time (flights needed to be caught right after), and the ample parking nearby. We'd vaguely heard good things, but no raves, and were hopeful the food would be good-- and we were not disappointed. \n\nWe ordered the huevos rancheros, the frittata, the polenta & eggs, and the buckwheat pancakes, and also a side of crispy potatoes. Coffee was a dark roast but the attentive refills were appreciated. One of our party ordered the senator and was a fan. We loved the huevos rancheros -- two poached eggs with spiced black beans, hen of the woods mushrooms, and corn tortillas with a few avocado slices. The crunchy tortillas were a nice twist to what is usually a (wonderfully) mushy mess of dish and we also loved the flavorful salsa (some heat but not too much) that came on the side. \nThe polenta and eggs was also solid-- roasted vegetables - braised spigarello (which according to wiki is a leafy green that tastes like broccoli), fried eggs with runny centers, and piquillo & poblano pepper salsa. \nThe buckwheat pancakes were good-- not too sweet as some brunch pancake dishes can be, but nothing too special. \nThe frittata was probably our favorite-- it was rich, but perfectly done, and we loved the tomatillo salsa on top. It might be hard for one person to eat alone but as a shared dish it was fantastic. \nAnd the side of crispy potatoes was totally worth it-- creamy on the inside crispy on the outside and served hot hot hot. If you consider the potatoes at Plow to be #1, these are definitely contenders for second place. \n\nGiven the positives this place has going for it, we will be back-- definitely for the frittata and the potatoes, and perhaps to try the fried egg sandwich. Ideally we'd time it such that we could go to mr. and mrs. miscellaneous across the street to finish the meal on a sweet note.", "author": "T K."}

When reading the dinner menus for both Serpentine and Slow Club, we were torn.  Liked the entrees and appetizers from Serpentine and the desserts at Slow Club.  Decided on Serpentine after tossing a coin.  \n\nReally loved the interiors.  An open industrial space with washed ceilings, old wood floors and wooden accents highlighted with beautiful light fixtures.  We were seated in the bar area.  Our server attentive and enthusiastic, in the right kind of way.  \n\nWe started with cocktails.  My friend ordered the Acadian: bulleit rye, sloe gin, honey, lemon, rosemary, absinthe.  This concoction was delicious, not too sweet and perfectly balanced with just a hint of rosemary.  I had the the 3rd from the bottom.  A blend of batiste rhum, grapefruit, maple, lemon, cayenne.  The server warned this was a spicy drink, I appreciated the hint of heat on the back.  Our evening off to a good start.\n\nWe ordered the Spiced Brentwood Yellow Corn soup with lime creme fraiche, spiced croutons, and summer vegetables.  This soup was the highlight of my meal.  Perfectly creamy.  The flavors bright, you got a different flavor and texture in every bite.  The perfect way to highlight the farmers market ingredients currently available.  \n\nEntrees:  Pan Seared California Halibut topped with oil cured olive tapenade and served with fresh cranberry beans, summer beans (both green and yellow), cherry tomatoes, and sauced with a delicious herb puree.  This dish was visually stunning and quite tasty.  I ordered the Grilled Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon topped with slivered almonds and served on a bed of quinoa, watercress, in a delicious romesco sauce.  Also on the plate were three mussels.  When the server brought the plate there was an overwheming \"fishy\" smell.  The fish ordered medium was overcooked and dry, maybe too long under the heat lamps?  I really enjoyed the quinoa and romesco sauce.  Perhaps this just wasn't the dish for me.\n\nI'll give Serpentine another try.  The atmosphere and service make it worth another trip to Dogpatch.", "author": "Kim A."}

Spiced lentil soup with pomegranate seeds and creme fraiche was not the best combination.  While a little small for the price, the Serpentine \"meat board,\" a collection of salumi with grilled levain toasts, is a great starter.  Served on an Acme roll, the Prather Ranch burger with arugula, pickled onions, and house-made bread and butter pickles is not one you want to smother with condiments: ketchup, mustard, or mayo would only adulterate the pure beef goodness. Light and crispy, the French fries were crispy and perfectly cooked.\n\nIf you order a G&T, you will not be turned away, but the bar emphasizes hand-crafted cocktails featuring super-premium, low volume spirits.  While bottled craft brews abound, there are no beers on tap and only an \"adequate\" wine list.\n\nService at the bar was glacial: flatware was not delivered at the beginning of the meal, water glasses were left unfilled, and used plates were not promptly removed.

The fries tasted really good also, thanks in part to the salt and herbs that are served up on them. \n\nAs good as the burger was, so was the pork shoulder sandwich. The pork, roll, and greens combined well together. Yes, I suspect that the aioli and avocado in the sandwich were fairly influential too! Whatever the reason though, don't pass it up if you enjoy anything like this.\n\nOh, and there's the unique pinot noir grape juice. Yes, it's fairly sweet, but non-alcoholic, grape juice. It's a local product (comes from Navarro) and surprisingly tasty, even when compared to the fresh orange juice, which I'd ordered for brunch previously.\n\nPro Move: If you order bacon for just a burger, you'll get enough for both that burger and another sandwich, as I found out.", "author": "Mike H."}

It was very good but didn't blow me away.  Of course, this was in part due to the fact that I ordered my patty medium well (I had a bad experience with rare hamburger meat once and have been traumatized) so it wasn't as juicy as it would otherwise be.  The bun was nicely toasted and the pickled onions made the flavors in each bite much more interesting.  But what makes this burger 4 stars in my eyes are the fries.  The fries are perfection.  Sometimes it's hard to get skinny fries right, but Serpentine's were uniformly crisp while still being moist on the inside.  They were served fresh out of the fryer, the portion size with hefty, and I finished almost every single fry.  Of course I was stuffed silly afterwards but it was well worth it.  I also tried the ginger squash and coconut soup with chives, cashew, and chili oil and it was excellent.  Each and every ingredient was discernible and united in perfect harmony and I was so inspired I came home and made my own simpler take on this soup.  So Ironically, while it was the burger that initially drew me in, I was much more impressed with the fries and the soup!", "author": "Beatrice W."}

The steak and eggs was REALLY GOOD. The steak was moist and the breading was flavorful as well. It was a tad bit under seasoned but I wasn't complaining. The eggs were made the way it was supposed to be made. You can tell it was done on low heat and cooked slowly. The eggs were soft, moist and well seasoned. The dish also came with their homemade biscuit and gravy, and a small arugula salad. The salad and eggs paired together amazingly well. The biscuit was also really tasty. When you first see it, you wonder if it is actually a biscuit. Honestly, it looks like some kind of cake or corn bread but it was so delicious. Crispy exterior with moist center and tastes exactly like a biscuit. I ate everything off the plate because it was so delicious.

It was a very busy night and as we were waiting to order drinks, a man interrupted the bartender while he was making drinks and asked for 4 manhattans.  He wanted them a particular way, so the bartender said \"please.....\"  and then the guy asked again, and the bartender said \"please\" - wanting the customer to say please.  Then, there was an older lady next to me using a light from her phone to see the menu because it was dark and the same bartender asked her to shut it off.  I mean, not a great experience for my first time at this place. The waiter was very friendly and sat next to us to take our order. He was a doll.  The food was great, but the mushrooms dish and calamari was room temperature.  We asked if we can have the mushroom dish hotter and he obliged.

This was the second place I visited this week that has been lingering on my bookmark list since last year.  Weird, but it's such a satisfying feeling to delete things off that list...like I accomplished something.  Haha.  Anyways...\n\nAt coworker Dave N's suggestion, we hit up Serpentine for lunch today.  Unless you know that it's right on the corner, you can easily pass it up.  I've driven by here hundreds of times and never noticed it until I put it on my list.  Inside is pleasantly bright.  The seating is kinda tight, but the amount of space overall does not feel claustrophobic.  After hearing about how good their burger was, that's exactly what I ordered, medium rare with cheddar.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/68-n3xi30GwhEvkElVNgiw?select=1OteAW4s7Z7MZTNzzi8HmQ)  Right away, you notice that the exterior of the bun is stiff.  Is it toasted?  I can't tell.  But that's what it felt like. The entire burger as a whole is pretty thick.  And speaking of...the patty itself is pretty thick .  Wait, I take that back.  It's not thick, it's THACK!  Seriously, that's one big ass patty.  (My apologies if anyone out there is named Patty.)  The flavoring of the burger was okay.  It wasn't bland, but it wasn't eye-popping either.  My love for the Marlowe burger has been well-documented.  So unless I find something completely mind-blowing, I'm pretty much ruined for other burgers.  Oh, it gets oily too.  Fries were good tho!\n\nOur waitress was meh.  She wasn't rude, just not in the happiest mood it seemed.  I scored a parking spot a block away on the other side of 3rd.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-13", "description": "Blog Post - http://dabblewith.com/2013/05/25/serpentine/\n\nErin Rooney started her restaurant businesses with Slow Club in 1991 in Potrero Hill. In December of 2007 Rooney added Serpentine to her collection. With the recession setting in soon after Serpentine opened Rooney decided upon keeping everything concise, so the staff is few extensively trained people and the menu is limited but packed with exceptional dishes (20 dishes max both small and large). Eric Held help Serpentine maintains its original space which was a boiler room for a 100-year-old can factory with an industrial interior design. Eric Held did so with exposed brick walls, a stained and mottled concrete ceiling 20 feet high, and large warehouse-style paned windows, painted black. Rooney chose the name Serpentine because it is the California State Rock and it was a jagged specimen of which she found under the floorboards during construction.\n\nSerpentine is known as one of Dogpatch's must try stops, they serve new American Cuisine for weekend brunch, weekday lunch, dinner (everyday) as well as extensive cocktail menu. However, there menu has changed because last year Serpentine underwent a huge tragedy when their lead chef Caesar Chuc was 628x471killed in a 20 person street brawl in the Mission District. Deepak Kaul is the new chef and his menu is slightly more expensive but definitely worth the wait. Kaul actually has a pretty unique path having left Boston University Medical School to follow his true passion cooking. Starting off staging dishes at Union Pacific Restaurant, led him down a path of working in the kitchens of Jardini\u00e8re, Rendezvous Central Square, and Nettie's Crab Shack, and now at Serpentine. I would highly recommend checking out Serpentine because Kaul has mastered the use of San Francisco's fresh and local ingredients and gives each dish a unique flavor with his extensive use of spices. The menu of 20 dishes often changes with the season but they do repeat popular dishes. Below are the dishes I would recommend:\nBrunch:\n* Prather Ranch Hamburger: arugula, pickled red onions, house made pickles, acme roll, french fries\n* Buckwheat Pancakes: pineapple, bananas, strawberries, candied walnuts, maple syrup, whipped cream\nLunch:\n* Coconut Carrot Soup\n* Fried Green Tomato Sandwich: Nueske's bacon, arugula, aioli, torpedo roll, greens / fries\n* Pan Seared Local Rock Cod: hen of the woods mushrooms,saut\u00e9ed ramps & fava leaves, roasted asparagus, carrot puree, black olive tapenade\nDinner:\n* House Made Potato Gnocchi with Wild Mushrooms: leeks, baby spigarello, grana padano, oregano, creme fraiche, bread crumbs, mushroom stock\n* Grilled California Salmon: fingerling potatoes, cauliflower, fava leaves, olive tapenade, sorrel nage\nCocktails\n* Ancient Lemon: hangar one vodka, aqua di cedro, lemon\n* Ransom Martinez: ransom gin, sweet vermouth, luxardo, orange & angostura bitters\n* Desert Sage: siete leguas reposado tequila, sage, lemon, honey, lemon thyme", "author": "Cameron M."}

The texture was a bit too much like a quiche, though -- I would've liked the general center to be a bit fluffier, and not as soggy. I added a side of scrambled eggs to eat along with the bread pudding, which definitely helped balance out the sogginess at the bottom. \n\nCountry Fried Steak = A thin cut of beef, breaded thickly and drenched with gravy. The flavor of the gravy is there, but there just wasn't enough substance. The steak was much too thin, so it tasted essentially like fried breading and gravy. The biscuit that came with it was horrible -- flat, tough, and bland.\n\nThe brunch food here is average, and not really memorable.

The pasta came with dungeness crab, a creme fraiche sauce, cara cara oranges, and some herbs.  So tasty, but there could have been a bit more crab.  The pasta was also a bit on the bland side, but that was an easy fix with both salt and pepper.  My favorite part about the burger was the braed since it came on an acme roll.  The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and good, but nothing to write home about I thought.  It may have been better with the blue cheese instead of the half I had, which was topped with American cheese.  \n\nService was great, waitress even made some recommendations.

The blossom bluff stone fruit gave a nice citrusy kick to the salad.It also came with toasted hazelnuts, ricotta salata in a white peach and ginger vinaigrette. The only sauvignon blanc by the glass was a Bedrock Sonoma County.

I've heard a lot of good things about this venue and I think unfortunately that caused some hype to cloud my culinary expectations. My brunch was filled with ups and downs and that really gets to conclude that Serpentine was simply...(by SF standards)....average. Let me explain...\n\nFood - \n\nThe good: I ordered a great item on the menu: fried egg sandwich (buttermilk biscuit, fried egg, arugula, tomato). The pork sausage that I added for an  extra cost was very tasty and well-seasoned. The egg was cooked to my liking (overmedium) and the arugula really worked with all the other components of the dish. \n\nThe bad: my pork sausage was undercooked. I cut open the medium-sized patty and the inside was undeniably pink. Now, i may not know a lot about cooking (as opposed to eating), but I am uncomfortable with pink centered pork. In addition to the undercooked sausage, I didn't like how they cut the tomatoes. They looked SO fresh, so tasty, and I really wanted to eat with the rest of my sandwich, but what was the problem? - they were not cut into thin slices like most tomatoes are for sandwiches. They were cut into thick wedges similarly to how they are presented in a salad. How am i suppose eat the tomato with the sandwich if the tomato cannot even be fit  between the two slabs of biscuit? :::confused:::: Cute, but not practical. \n\nService - \n\nAverage, maybe slightly disappointed. I had to almost ask twice for them to replace my undercooked pork. I referred my waitress to it and it was like she had to take a second glance to make sure I wasn't making something up. If a customer is providing a legitimate complaint, you need to honor that complaint without question. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I tried it b/c there was so much excitement about this venue's brunch. Now i'll be glad to bring my business elsewhere.", "author": "Nathan T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-27", "description": "Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.  Came with my husband and sister-in-law for a birthday dinner.  The menu is full of seasonal ingredients, so everything had great flavor and was very fresh. We ordered:\n\nSpring Carrot Salad - it was quite acidic, but I love vinegar and acidic flavors, so I didn't mind. \n\nCrispy Brussels Sprouts - PERFECT\n\nCured meat platter - my husband was a little disappointed with the size, but I was happy with it, because come on - its a platter of saturated fat!  So it was an appropriately moderate size. Comes with toasted bread rubbed with garlic. The chicken liver mousse was to DIE for and it was my favorite part of the platter. But it is small, so if you have more than 3 people in your party, it's not perfect for sharing. \n\nLamb shank - very tender, not super gamey, flavorful sauce. It came with quinoa, which was a surprise. Normally braised meat dishes come with mashed potatoes, which is always delicious, but it can be quite heavy. So the quinoa kept the dish light and, of course, more nutritious. \n\nPetrale Sole - needed more acid, so I could have asked for a slice of lemon but I just decided to enjoy it as is. It got cold pretty quickly, so I don't think it was piping hot when it came out. But the fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was a beautiful bright green and very tasty. \n\nGnocchi with Crab - this was my least favorite dish. The gnocchi was light and airy, but the sauce had this strange flavor I just did not enjoy. Grapefruit and fennel?  With crab?  It tasted... Weird. That's all I can say. \n\nFor dessert:\n\nLemon Buttermilk Cake with Huckleberry Sauce - OH. MYYYYYYY.  GOSH. Incredible dessert. The texture of the cake was ridiculous. So airy and light. Did they steam it? I am still amazed how they did that. The lemon curd on top was a little eggy. And I wish there was more huckleberry sauce.  But that's ok, it was still a delicious dessert.\n\nStrawberry Mascarpone Tart - compared to the lemon cake, this was not as sweet, and that was actually brilliant because it was nice to go back and forth between the two.\n\nBut if I had to pick just one dessert to order again, it would DEFINITELY be the lemon buttermilk cake. \n\nThe service was very good. The place was jam packed, even at our 8:00 reservation, but we never felt neglected. If you don't like noisy or dim restaurants, then don't come here. But I enjoyed the ambiance, it's very intimate, the music was good. I would definitely recommend this place for a third date, when you don't need to talk as much and you feel more relaxed with each other. \n\nDefinitely coming back here!  There were so many things I didn't get to try so I'm excited to return and sample more things.", "author": "Maya A."}

If you are early (even a few minutes) you will wait at the bar to get a drink and settle your bill therefore getting you to your table 20 minutes later than your reservation pushing their schedule back a bit. We were told when we got to our table that they had a reservation for that spot at 7:30 (it is now 6:20) so we felt a bit rushed. When 7:00 rolled around and we had just gotten our entrees we mentioned to our server that we were feeling this way and asked if perhaps he could move us to another place.  He didn't know that we were told our table had a so called expiration time. He made us feel comfortable by telling us we have time and ended up telling us we had until 8:00 PM. Funny thing was, we left the place at 7:45, if we had been seated right at 6 and ordered our drinks at the table, this wouldn't have happened. \n\nThe food was AMAZING. I would come here again knowing the key to getting to your table on time and not feeling rushed. Amateur mistake from the child of a Marine who has to always be on time or early or her stomach hurts. Our server was out of this world, very efficient, light conversation and super cute.  The drinks are classic cocktails with a modern spin and are made by bartenders that know how to make drinks.\n\nMeal highlights:\n::  Rome Beauty Apple Salad - sharp cheddar, spiced pecans and perfectly dressed\n::  Swordfish - so light and tender, not heavy and steaky like some swordfish, clams on the side were perfect.\n::  Lemon Buttermilk Cake - need I say more? If there is a lemon dessert on the menu, that is what I am getting and this made me feel like I was floating on a lemon island.\n::  Bourbon dessert drink with coffee beans on top made the ride home a lot more fun!\n\nRecommended for a date night for sure!", "author": "Katie S."}

Dinner was set for 8:30. \n\nWe get there at 8:25, table wasn't ready yet. No problem, since the vibe of the place was perfect: we're both New Yorkers, and this place definitely had that kind of thing going for it. The hostess was extremely apologetic for the delay, but since the people at our table weren't moving, there was nothing she could do.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes, we get shown to a table, and it's a real table, not the ones in the front of the place that are reserved for walk-ins -- sweet! And to top it off, the waitress sent over two glasses of champagne and a free appetizer of calamari. I don't even like calamari, but I couldn't get enough of these. Seriously, order the calamari. \n\nI really don't remember what else we ordered (because this night is already a few months ago), but I remember that it was great, including dessert.

I went back a week later with some friends who typically never set foot in the Dogpatch/Potrero area, but did this time because I had been raving like a lunatic about how good this place was.   Well, Serpentine didn't disappoint because my friends really enjoyed it.  \n\nOne thing I noticed on the second visit was just how expensive this place is.  I understand its San Francisco, but the place has a warehouse feel and is located in the less expensive (rent wise) area of the Dogpatch among industrial buildings.  I don't expect them to lower their prices because judging by the amount of people in their restaurant each night they have no reason to.  I think the cheapest way to enjoy Serpentine is to go in for their delicious burger along with a beer.  You can do that for under $20.  \n\nAlso, if you are not worried about the extra fat that builds around your mid section, you will definitely want to try their desserts.  They have dessert which I am in love with.  Its got two cookies on the outside and ice cream in the middle (forgot what they called it).  Its amazing.

It is one of those neighborhood restaurants in SF that doesn't really stand out on paper.  There seem to be 100 Serpentine like restaurants in SF.  It is so hard to work my way through the list.  I am glad I finally checked out Serpentine.\n\nThe decor has a great industrial vibe, but it still comes off as very SF in style.  Pretty cool.\n\nThis place reminds me a lot of Nopa.\n\nThis place has the best burger in all of SF so far.\n\nMy previous favorites were Nopa, Mission Beach, and 4505 meats.  This burger beats them all in my opinion.\n\nIt comes with house made pickles and house pickled onions.  The meat was prather ranch, which is an all grass feed beef.  For some reason, the beef had a nice fatty richness to it that I am accustomed to with grain fed beef.  It was seasoned perfectly.  I find most burgers to be under seasoned for my taste, but this was right on.  \nI ordered my burger medium rare, and for the first time in SF, it came out medium rare.  Most times I order medium rare and it comes out Medium.  Medium is a great way to enjoy a burger, but sometimes I prefer medium rare, and no place at SF has managed to deliver except this place.\n\nI typically add mustard to my burger, but because the burger had pickled onions, I decided against it.  There was enough \"acid\" on the burger without the mustard.   \n\nI opted for blue cheese instead of cheddar.  The blue cheese was from cowgirl creamery and it was heavenly.  I havne't had a burger with this quality of blue cheese in a long time.  Despite having a lot of blue cheese on the burger, I was suprised that I couldn't really taste it on some bites.  When I did taste it,.....WOW! \n\nI had a nice, big,  (perhaps jammy) Zin to go with my perfect burger.  \nIt was a winning combination. \n\nAside from possibly dry aging the beef to get a more intense flavor and perhaps adding a bit more blue cheese, I would say this is the perfect burger (for my tastes). The addition of bacon would have detracted from the other flavors IMHO.\n\nWe had some calamari as well.  Calamari is a common dish that is not that exciting anymore, but Serpentine found a way to make it interesting again.  They breaded it with chickpeas to give it a unique texture, and they also made it with a broth that had a fair bit of acid in it (lemon juice maybe?).  It was a great dish and I really enjoyed it.\n\nWe also had sweetbreads.  It is rare that a place like this would even offer sweetbreads as an appetizer. The sweetbreads were very good.  \n\nOverall, this place was great and I would come back again. \n\nI wouldn't say it is better than Nopa, but if you live around dogpatch, it offers a solid alternative.", "author": "Jeremy R."}

Both the servers and bartender answer questions about the food accurately and intelligently, and make appropriate wine pairing recommendations. Fantastic beer selection.\n\nThey do take reservations, and I would recommend them if you plan on dining later and prefer a table. We arrived at 9pm last night (Tues) to a packed house, and waited about 15 minutes for a seat at the bar. Not a problem for us, and we had great service.\n\nLast night's bill: Calamari, 2 burgers, 1 wine, 1 beer came to just under $60.", "author": "Carnley P."}

Last night we double dated for dinner. Even though we had a nice time and the food was good, I wasn't impressed with the restaurant. It's terribly overpriced for what you get. I won't likely return, at least not for dinner, perhaps just for cocktails. Speaking of, I ordered the Vista, and mmm mmm, it was worth the $11. I can't say the same for the small plates we ordered. The cheeseboard appetizer was tasty, but sharing the miniature-sized portions between 4 people was a joke. We liked the seared padron peppers side dish, but they tasted the same as what I make at home for a lot less than $8. Two of us received generous platings of our mains: oven roasted chicken, and the hamburger w/blue cheese and bacon. I had the burger, so I can attest that is was very good. $20 good?? I suppose, I wasn't unhappy with my choice. However, our two vegetarians each ordered the ravioli, and their sad little servings really shocked us. Also, the ravioli wasn't that great (reminding us of that classic Annie Hall joke \"the food is terrible...and such small portions!\") Well, the ravioli wasn't terrible, it just wasn't anything to rave about, and for $18, it should have been. Finally we ordered desserts, and the chocolate cake with ice cream definitely did not disappoint. Delicious. I wish they'd remembered to bring me the decaf coffee I'd ordered along with it. But that's the only ding on what was otherwise super-attentive and friendly service. The last thing I want to mention is that the noise level in this restaurant is ri di cu lous. I was hoarse after two hours of trying to converse with my friends, the din is nightclub level. Don't come here if you want to have a relaxing chat over dinner, Serpentine is not the environment for that.", "author": "Christine C."}

They ask for your phone number to call when your table is ready, but I decided to stand right outside on the ramp. Luckily we didn't have to wait that long, and she came out and called me by another name. When I told her that wasn't me (I didn't want to take someone else's table), she asked for my name, and told me she just called me. It was weird to me that they don't call out the name to the crowd outside before calling the number. My phone was tucked away and I didn't hear it. Anyways, no big deal, then we were seated at a cute little booth.\n\nI got the Baked Eggs (two eggs, spiced garbanzo beans, rapine, mushrooms, and green salsa) and a Buckwheat Pancake. The baked eggs came with a few thick slices of bread with butter. The bread was SO HARD. I seriously had to gnaw at it so hard, my friend started laughing at me because I looked RIDICULOUS. She even asked why I was still trying to eat it. The baked eggs weren't good, either. It just tasted weird.. Sour, almost. When I drenched the food in hot sauce and egg yolk, it was bearable. Safe to say, I didn't finish it. I don't like my brunch sour tasting. The buckwheat pancakes came topped with whipped cream, a couple pieces of pineapple, strawberry, bananas, and walnuts. Whipped cream on pancakes? Isn't it usually butter? Unless it was a sweet pancake, I'd expect butter on it. And buckwheat...... I guess I've never had buckwheat because it was disgusting! I ate all the fruit and took a tiny piece of the pancake dunked in syrup, and it was DISGUSTING. I can't even describe the taste, but I took a bite of my sour baked eggs to get rid of the taste in my mouth.\n\nNot only was my meal disappointing, the service was seriously lacking. After we were served, the waitress did not come back in the hour and a half we were there. Not once. Everyone that came in after us were already gone. There were moments of eye contact when I was about to ask for a box (for my sad pancake I thought my dad might like) and the check, but they just turned around and walked away before I could say anything. Another 10 minutes went by, still nothing. Finally got the attention of one of the girls, but she decided to begin taking the order of the table of 12 next to us. Waved down another one of the waitresses and asked for a box and the check. She boxed the food, came back. No check ... Waited another 10 minutes and they FINALLY, very nonchalantly, brought the check. No eye contact. No thank you. Good thing we didn't park in metered parking.\n\nDisappointed. I won't be coming back.\nLuckily, Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous is right across the street!", "author": "Jaime H."}

Needless to say, It was a bit of a turbulent experience.\n\nFirst off, our server seemed a bit impatient.  He was helpful but he managed to pick up our tray of oysters before we were finished and picked up my girlfriends glass of wine when she clearly was not done as well.\n\nSecond, portions were lack luster and masked by the same sides on multiple dishes.  I ordered the salmon and they convinced me to order it \"their\" way.  Which I did.  It was cooked on the outside properly, but RAW in the middle.  I like my salmon tacky unless i'm getting sushi.  The gnocchi was good, but there was only  6 pieces on the plate and it was masked by the side of broccolini.  The same side I had on my plate as I mentioned earlier.  Some variety between sides would have been nice so that you don't feel like you're eating in a cafeteria.\n\nDessert was good.  Went with the ice cream sandwich and i loved it.\n\nOverall, I may try this place out again.  I would have given 3 stars if I didn't feel like we were being rushed out of there  by our server and they would have been a little more descriptive on how they cook their salmon.

Veggies at brunch (or in general, for that matter) typically don't enthuse me, but the roasted beets and fresh arugula in this dish are so flavorful, I could eat them by the bucketload and not once think about my usual bacon-and-eggs-dripping-with-grease brunch. Those yummy beets and arugula can hold their own, but combine them with crispy potatoes, beef brisket, two poached eggs, and toast triangles, and you've got the kind of dish that I'll scarf down Cookie Monster-style. The potatoes shatter on contact, the beef melts in your mouth, and the eggs burst into puddles of warm yolk, begging to be mopped up by the crunchy toast. Morsels of heaven!\n\nOther favorites:\n\n- Chicories salad with chicken: Fresh, leafy greens with a variety of oranges, garlic croutons, and maple vinaigrette. I'm not a fan of most croutons, but these were delightfully crisp and packed a garlicky punch. The chicken was surprisingly moist, tender, and well-seasoned - I'm not sure I can go back to eating the dry chicken breast in packaged Trader Joe's salads anymore.\n\n- Buckwheat pancakes: Fluffy pancake with bananas, freshly whipped cream, and candied walnuts...what's not to love?\n\nI've also heard rave reviews of their burgers. Must try next time!\n\nLove the vibe of this place: industrial, modern, and laid-back.

The sauce was tangy and spicy, which went well with the green salad. Melt in your mouth delicious.\n\nDrink:\nNow, I'v had quite a few Manhattans in my years in SF. I'v been served the entire spectrum, from a sub par well drink served on the rocks, to the rare bourbon mixed by a pro bartender served up in a martini. Serpentine serves theirs up and serves it right. Easily one of the best tasting and smoothest manhattans I've ever had.\n\nEntree:\nThe Masami Ranch Pork Loin End Chop came out glistening in a reddish hued cherry-mustard jus. Presentation was perfect. The chop itself could have been a little more tender, but the flavor spectrum in this dish was amazing. A side of mushroom flan?

We had heard amazing things about brunch at Serpentine so yay for us!\n\nFirstly, LOVE the decor. It looks wherehouse-y in the inside but is brightly/well-lit and feels very cozy. There are both high-tables with stools to sit on or regular tables and even booths. Luckily, we were able to get a cozy booth. (Love the color/furniture in here - very rustic yet modern with brick walls!)\n\nWe all ordered the ruby mimosa, super tasty, and we also started off with the biscuits and gravy. The buscuits are soft and chewy and sooo yummy, and the gravy that it comes with is good, but it's very meaty so it's not veggie friendly. Luckily, we got it on the side because we had one veggie person. The gravy is definitely tasty and comes with chunky pieces of pork.\n\nFor the main dish, we ordered the salad, the fried chicken sandwich, and the baked eggs. Salad in my opinion was good, but not outstanding. Everything in it was very fresh and was delicious, but it wasn't anything special. If you're used to fresh salads in SF, this will be another one. The fried chicken sandwich was YUMMY and very filling. The fried egg in it is crunchy and tasty, and the potatoes that come on the side are great too. My personal favorite was the baked eggs - what a unique dish. It comes in a skillet with a bunch of veggies (garbanzo beans, squash, tomatoes, etc.) and it's topped with the egg. I don't know what it is about it, but it tastes very very Indian almost! The flavoring tastes a little masala-esque or something. All of us absolutely LOVED this - it is by far one of the most unique tasting brunch menu items I've had.

The place was packed, as it is on most nights, and everybody was having a good time. In one word, I think it's overrated. The food is alright, but way overpriced and the portions are small. We paid $25 for what had to be $5 worth of salmon, and there wasn't much else on the plate. They have a wide selection of specialty cocktails and fancy beers so I would be inclined to classify Serpentine as an upscale bar rather than a nice restaurant. It's a very social place and a good choice for small groups looking to hang out and buy several rounds of drinks, that is, if you manage to get seated. Then again, if that's the case, you're probably better off going to the Dogpatch Saloon across the street because it's actually a bar rather than a restaurant with a bar in it.", "author": "Laurent L."}

The eggs were a little too tough for me, and the beans and salsa and carrots on the bottom kind of made it too spicy and soggy at the same time.\n\nService was pretty sparse - my glass sat empty for a long time until they finally came and refilled it.  I would definitely make reservations for this place, as it's pretty small and fills up very quickly.\n\nI loved the sound of the other food stuff there (um hello, Crab Benedict??) so I would definitely go back and get pretty much everything else on the menu.

It seemed just a short while ago that everyone was going bacon crazy, and foods with a salty component were the craze. Now I'm finding bitter elements in everything. I suppose it's just the current food revolution. Either way, I'm super sensitive to that flavor, and it's a little annoying to find it's now a key component in today's food culture. I guess you can say I'm bitter about bitterness.\n\nI am so totally off topic. Serpentine. Met up with my date there for an impromptu late dinner and deemed it tasty, if overpriced. He had the burger and cleaned his plate. I did as well with my oxtail gnocchi but that was partly because I felt that the portion size was about 2/3 the size it should have been for the price tag of $20. Oxtail is a cheap cut of meat, and gnocchi is made with potatoes. Talk about a huge food cost markup. \n\nThough I find the menu items to be inventive and of good quality, due to the portion sizes I would have said I might not return.

Our waitress was very personable, friendly, and outgoing. My dad has pretty sophisticated tastes in alcohol, and he seemed pleased with their selection. I was also very pleased with my cocktail, \"The Hard Fall,\" although it turned out to be too sweet for dinner, so I mostly saved it for dessert. We also ordered a bottle of wine, and the waitress was thoughtful enough to leave it to breathe while we waited for our food.\n\nThey served some delicious bread, but I thought it could have been more well-sliced. It was just four big pieces. As it turned out, though, we didn't have much chance to eat it anyway, as dinner arrived VERY quickly. I have never before complained that my dinner came too fast, but on this occasion, I could've used a bit longer to converse and savor my cocktail. No big deal, though.\n\nWhen our food arrived, another waitress came to pour the wine, and seemed a little confused. She interrupted us to ask if we wanted our wine with dinner. Um...it's not a dessert wine and someone clearly told you to bring glasses? I think she was unsure because we all also had other drinks, but that was still weird.\n\nMy gnocchi with bacon was quite good, but I ended up wishing I'd ordered my dad's lamb shank, which looked amazing. (I actually have his leftovers in my fridge, so I guess I'll find out!) I kind of felt like my portion was disproportionately small compared to theirs, and it wasn't as beautifully presented, either. I felt like the gnocchi should have had some kind of a side vegetable or something, in retrospect. My husband had the burger with Gruyere, which he seemed to enjoy quite a lot. I munched his fries and they were possibly the best french fries I've ever had, with several dipping sauces for them, too. Our wine was by Storybook Vineyards, and it was perfect with my food.\n\nI was still kinda hungry after my entree, and my tablemates saved room for dessert, so we had the salted caramel pot de creme (two of them, actually), apple rhubarb cobbler, and affogato. All of them were amazing, but I loved the cobbler especially. I wished the pot de creme had a biiiiiit more salt, but then I am kind of a salted dessert fiend.\n\nWe stayed and drank for quite a while after dinner was done, and didn't feel rushed at all.

Medium on the outside, rare in the inside - and asked if it is fine with us. We said yes. The fished was completely overcooked not even a little pink on the inside - again the rest of the dish was promising - but the salmon - the heart of the dish was just so dry.\n\nWe didn't have success with deserts either. We had the chocolate cake with the ice cream. The ice cream was nice, it was from Bi-Rite, the cake was the most simple chocolate cake ever. Not to insult anyone there in the kitchen, but it kind of tasted like something you can buy in safeway bakery - or even a shelved cake. Really nothing special. The combination of the chocolate cake with ice cream is always a success - but it was so mediocre in its quality, not a restaurant dish. \n\nSo why 3 starts and not just 1?\n\nService was OK (though he forgot to bring our padron peppers), I love their brunches, cocktails are very good.\n\nStay away during nights, get here for brunch.", "author": "Too M."}

He refilled my glass of water, brought us new wine glasses and came to check on us very often. It was a pretty packed night too. \n\nOnto the food. We ordered the clams and mussels and the Serpentine meat board as starters. The clams and mussels were pretty flavorful. The meat board was just okay except for the duck liver mousse. It was amazing! I spreaded some of it onto the bread they gave us, and it was delicious! That thing is 100x better than butter (not factoring in cost that is)!\n\nI ordered the Pan Seared California Halibut as an entree, and I also had a taste of their Grilled Storm Hill Hanger Steak. My fish was super salty and dry. The radish rabe beneath it was super salty as well. However, the potato was delcious! One of my friends ordered halibut also, but hers was bland. Maybe they double-seasoned mine. The hanger steak was delicious! If I ever go back, I would order the hanger steak.

Yes, I'm a suburbanite who drools at the sight of a menu that isn't laminated, but this place offers a stellar brunch.  \n\nI opted for the Red Flannel Hash (think gourmet corned beef hash with beets and perfectly poached eggs), my 2 girls (ages 2 and 5) shared an order of 2 buckwheat pancakes with whipped cream (best buckwheat pancakes EVER--they actually were light and fluffy like buttermilk ones!), my brother got the fried egg sandwich (which looked amazing!), and my sister-in-law got the baked eggs with beans.   Everyone was happy with their food and we had no complaints about any of it.  I would definitely go back to eat there again the next time I'm in the city.\n\nWith OJ, milk, and tea, the total bill was about $60 and I left a $12 tip as I always feel bad about the disarray left behind because of my kids.  They are really good compared to most kids, but I am hyper sensitive about their behavior.  I expect quiet indoor voices, no playing with the silverware, and no eating with their hands.  Nonetheless, I often have to wipe up messy tables and sticky seats with whatever leftover napkins I have, so I always leave a nice tip.  This isn't really a kid-friendly place, but they gave us a huge booth in the back and my 2 year old had a grand time sprawled out on the bench seat.\n\nSo the tip was more about my guilt over bringing my kids here.  Service was ok.  It's on par with the service I get at ethnic restaurants or the diner down the street from my house in the suburbs and those places are far cheaper--they came by to refill water once, they cleared the completely empty plates (I did say it was good food!) about 5 minutes after we finished eating (which is still prompt enough but at these prices I expect more precise and attentive service), and they offered straws for my kids' drinks.  They didn't bring me extra napkins, which is standard at most restaurants when I bring my kids.  So I couldn't  clean up after them today but luckily I didn't let them have syrup on their pancakes so it wasn't bad at all.

I'll mention that my friend and I are both bartenders at very busy restaurants in San Francisco. Both of us will not be back.\n\nI just left Sunday brunch service. The restaurant was half empty, including multiple open bar stools. We informed the host we wanted to sit at the bar - he asked us to wait, walked over to the bar and bussed two dirty glasses. He came back, said nothing to us, and greeted 3 parties behind us. After seating them in the dining room and ignoring me for another few minutes, I walked over to the bar, moved some dirty plates away, and sat down. There were 6 vacant stools all together. I chalked it up to confusing, awkward hosting.\n\nWe were not greeted by the Bartender, whose name was Paul (a fact I learned only by reading his name on our bill.) In fact, he didn't utter one single word to us. Not to ask us what we wanted, if the food was OK, if we needed anything. He pulled out a piece of paper, looked at us, and waited for us to place our orders, which he scribbled down and turned away. He could have been a mute. I will never know. Not tip worthy service by any means. \n\nWhile waiting for our food, I became hypnotized by watching a certain food runner/server carrying plates from the kitchen to various tables in the dining room. She had long blond hair, falling over her shoulders to about mid back. Each and every plate she carried had her hair dunked gracefully in the food. I watched her run a sandwich to a table by the window, with her hair covering the plate she held closest to her body on her forearm. Her hair actually clumped up in the aoli and over the fries, and as she dropped the plate, the aoli globbed up in her hair and on her shirt. I was absolutely disgusted. I prepared myself for the awkward \"please take this plate back as your hair is all up in it\" conversation. However, a nice brunette dropped our food, with her hair tucked up in an elastic. I was relieved.\n\nI ate 1/3 of of my food, drank half of my bloody mary, and bounced. We were there for exactly 28 minutes, at which point I was so turned off that I didn't even want to stay. \n\nIts against my beliefs to leave 0% gratuity, because a percentage of my tip outs are left for bussers and dishwashers and other back of house employees.

I must say I don't spend too much time in this neighborhood and I'd been meaning to give Hard Knox a try forever now but Serpentine has beaten the Knox to it. Let me say that I love the fact that a lot of the building's original elements like the exposed brick, hardwood floor, high ceilings and textile factory style windows were kept. Add to that new wood, metal accents, and double draped restroom pods in the middle of the room facing the sizeable bar, you get a dichotomy of classic industrial and modern sleek.\n\nThe place isn't very large although the high ceilings give it a more open feel than it actually is. I'd say my one gripe about the place is that it's a bit cramped. We were both bumped from behind multiple times from both patrons and staff trying to get around our area and we were against the wall! However the delicious semi upscale comfort food and drinks made up for it.\n\nWe started with the savory bread pudding which had butternut squash and topped with a buttermilk bleu cheese dressing. Not only heavenly but super filling. We got the appetizer portion and it came out as a huge mound and if we didn't stop ourselves and get it boxed we would have been full on that alone. Great deal especially if you have 3-4 people. I also got the lamb riblets, braised in what was a savory/semi sweet sauce with some greens. This was tasty but it didn't wow like te bread pudding. For the entrees we got the buffalo short ribs with what seemed like drits and grilled persimmon. Delish in the braise and fall off the bone with a meatier bite texture than your standard beef ones. The entree was the roasted rabbit loin accompanied by a wilted spinach mash and buttery crisped spaetzle. This might be the best rabbit dish I've ever had since it was moist and the skin was  cripsed (like the spaetzle) perfectly. I thought the seasonings were flavorful throughout all of our dishes. \n\nThe ambiance gets pretty noisy as the night carried on. We got their early in order to make a show and shortly after we got our drinks the place filled up to capacity. The service was a little uneven at first because of the rush but smoothed out as they got in their flow. As I mentioned earlier the only issues I had were with the space because it is quite packed in.

You may recall (I am sure you do) that a couple of months back, d took us to Yield, a wine bar on 3rd Street which we all really enjoyed.  Well, wouldn't you know it, right across the street was Serpentine, a newish New American restaurant that is a sister restaurant to Slow Club.  The vibe is both cozy and stylish with leather booths (I love booths) offset by tall ceilings in this modern extension of a red brick warehouse space.\n\nFeaturing a limited but solid menu, Serpentine's offerings surpassed my expectations.  We started with a house favorite: the savory bread pudding with fennel, baby spinach, roasted garlic, and swiss cheese.  It was mouth-wateringly good.  We also had the little gems lettuce with hazelnuts and shaved red onions but let's get real, it was the zoe's bacon and blue cheese dressing which made this a little stand-out.  For my entree, I had their Prather Ranch hamburger with greens, pickled onions, and blue cheese on an acme roll.  For $13, it was a solid burger, one I can't wait to try again.  Dessert was so-so (I can't remember what we had) but overall, a really enjoyable meal.\n\nService was friendly and more than compotent, on par with Slow Club.  Check this place out, it doesn't hurt that you have to spend zero time finding parking in the Dog Patch.  For now, anyway.", "author": "Saminda W."}

There's not much in between, and that's where Serpentine comes in.\n\nI came here with my boy for brunch. I love the space though during brunch the light from the windows bounces off all that stainless steel and can be a bit blinding. \n \nHe got the Country Fried Steak & Eggs (flat iron steak - scrambled eggs - biscuit & gravy - crispy potatoes - arugula). I got the Baked Eggs (two eggs - cranberry beans - summer squash - sweet corn - epazote - red spring onion - green garlic salsa) with corn bread. The food was delicious and most significantly, everything was executed perfectly. The country fried steak was just perfectly fried, didn't taste of old oil and was very tender.  The portions were fairly generous for the price.\n\nWe also drank a blood orange bellini and a grapefruit mimosa, or perhaps it was the other way around. In any case, our drinks had a great balance of juice to booze. \n\nCocktails were less than $10 (8 I think). No entree was above $20. It's easy here to have good food and good drink without emptying your wallet. \n\nI love how close Serpentine is to Mr. & Mrs. Misc. too.

However, I really feel like this restaurant has some serious fundamental problems with service. Upon arriving, the greeter was pleasant, but the restaurant was completely booked in reservations. We opted to sit at the bar, which only had three other guests. Upon sitting down, the bartender was cleaning glasses and looked to be organizing a bit, but took over 5 minutes to greet us or even look at us. When he finally got us menus, he didn't smile or say anything like \"good morning\" or \"how are you\"... We ordered a mimosa and Bloody Mary, which he made quickly, but again, no smiles or small talk. When we asked for suggestions on house favorites, and in particular, the corn beef hash, his answer was curt and unwelcoming \"I personally don't like it... It's ok.\" We ended up ordering the polenta and pork and the fried chicken, both which were kind of bland. Nothing to write home about. And the very end of the experience, he got our check, didn't ask us how our food was, and never said thank you or have a good day....

The wine, Horse and Plow, was decent, not amazing, at $36/bottle. They were fairly attentive about refilling water glasses, although providing more bread without being asked to would have been nice (very good bread with a nice crust and crumb; would have preferred nice olive oil over the butter provided though).\n\nFood- very good, although I heard quite a few mutterings of \"bland\" and reaching for the salt- I understand it is easier to under-salt and let guests apply their own amount of salt and pepper, but it was very noticeable. For both the rabbit and gnocchi. The dishes were presented very nicely; the gnocchi were nicely textured- not too soft but well made, with beautiful mushrooms and a nicely spiced creme fraiche. The TCHO chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream was wonderful, piping hot \"souffle\" underneath the ice cream, with caramelized cocoa nibs on top (not a fan of these, too much)- a small dessert but just enough for one person. The coffee was very good, but not amazing. \n\nOverall, worth checking out, unless you are really hungry, because you won't get filled up here. Before 7pm, it was quiet and easy to talk; after 7pm however, on a Thursday night, it got pretty loud and packed out quickly, even at the bar.", "author": "Amanda S."}

The minimalist decor inside was nice, but can imagine more nice for dinner. Something about the place doesn't scream cozy brunch spot, but it was definitely attractive.

We couldn't find her to ask, so when someone came to bus our plates, we asked the buser for two more drinks. As exchange was occuring, our waitress popped up and put the bill on our table. It was a little awkward - because we basically drank our 2nd drink with no food and felt a little rushed. In hingsight, the food came out so quickly after ordering, that we didn't really have the leisurely brunch experience.

For that, Serpentine is a great find.

(why wait in line?) Or come before the 11 o'clock rush.\n\nPROS:\n\nEasy Parking. Easy access to public transit. \n\nElegant and simple industrial decor. \n\nFull bar. There's mimosas, belinis, though, sadly not bottomless. Bloody Mary is delicious too, though no celery. I'm partial to having a celery stalk in my BMs.\n\nCoffee - excellent.\n\nOrdered in the group were, Burger, Baked Eggs, Crab Benedict. \n\nBurger got a firm thumbs up. \n\nBaked Eggs as well (though comment was the veggies were on the bland side). \n\nBenedict is tasty, though I found it a bit on the tart side, and if you order it I'd suggest getting a side of bacon or sausage. Benedict came with a pleasant arugula/fennel salad, and home fries were nice and crispy.\n\nPancake! If the server asks if you'd like to order one pancake to share, say: YES. (assuming no one is ordering pancake) We had a delightful banana pancake with whipped cream and candied walnuts. \n\nCONS:\n\nNot much. A few times, had to ask for refills on coffee. But otherwise, service was decent.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nAnother good brunch place to keep in mind. Should try out dinner sometime.", "author": "Boris C."}

The crudo (a special I think) was delicious as is the gnocchi - add the bacon, it's worth it. However, my absolute favorite thing on the menu is the brussel sprouts. I know, I know, that's weird. But the red peeper and peccarino on the crispy roasted sprouts creates something truly magical. I crave them and have managed to make an acceptable version at home.

Toasted Acme bun, pickled onions, arugula...Everything came together, nothing overpowering, and perfectly beefy. With another half of the burger left, we cut up the leftover chicken liver and put it all together! LOL it was awesome. But seriously, the thing I like best is the acid on the burger, which was missing from Marlowe's (Michael Bauer's fave).\n\nService was great, and cocktails were nice as well.

I just found it expensive for what it was.  As I warned my girlfriend before she made her plea to try something different, I was concerned that this would be \"insubstantial.\"  It was.  For $81, we got essentially a few small plates and a drink each (she got wine, I got a lemon vodka martini).  Portions were tapas-style.  The one outstanding side was the fries -- wonderful -- and uniquely plentiful. \n\nThe number of vegetarian dishes is modest, and I think we may have ordered every one (I suspect they would modify some recipes on the menu should someone want to take out a non-veg ingredient, such as the pancetta in the other salad).  We had the mushroom gnocchi, a salad, fries, snap peas, and the soup of the day.  The gnocci was okay, but a tiny portion for the price.  The salad was okay.  The soup (scallion) wasn't good.  The snap peas were great, as were the fries.\n\nIt wasn't really a meal.  Neither of us was satisfied.  And it was over $80.  Is this what life in the City is like?

She obviously loves what she does, has the biggest, most honest smile and is one the friendliest people you will ever come across.  It felt as if I was at a friend's house and she was cooking dinner for us...quite comfortable, amiable and absolutely personable.  I didn't get your name, but thank you!  You are awesome!\n\nThe drink menu is pretty extensive!  Cocktails of all kinds, an impressive wine list and a unique array of beer to choose from...you can't go wrong that!  Serpentine definitely strives to appease all libation palates.  Winner!  I opted for the Hibiscus Fizz--Be Careful!  You may want to down it like juice.  Nuff said.\n\nSo, onto the food..The menu focuses on fresh, local ingredients.  You can definitely sense this when going through the list of dishes.  We both wanted to order the Yellowtail but when I saw that the Alaskan Cod had BACON in it, I immediately changed my mind and didn't even look back!  \n\nOne thing that I noticed about my dish was the fact that each bite was wonderfully different.  One bite had a tinge of bacon with crispy skin (YUM) and the next was a mouthful of cod and veggies.  I don't think I've ever called a fish dish amazing...so there it is.  AMAZING.  My favorite part?  The artichoke chips sprinkled over the dish.  Definitely a lovely surprise!  I cleaned up my plate.  I was a bit embarrassed, being on a \"first date\"...but whatevs.  It's the real me, right?  :)\n\nA definite must is dessert.  They turned an old childhood favorite into an unforgettable masterpiece!  The ice cream sandwich with Bi-Rite's Roasted Banana ice cream, ginger cookies, rich caramel and toffee bits.

The only thing that really disappointed me about this place is that I hadn't gone before.\n\nSome how I forget how close Dogpatch is from my home just like I forget how much it has changed in the last ten years and especially in the last couple years. One of the biggest changes has been the hipster restaurants that have opened in the area. Serentine with it's high windows blocking any view of 3rd street  and prices in the 20's for entrees is part of the 3rd street rail gentrification.  \n\nAll the food though was lacking in pretentiousness and deliver in quality, creativity and value. With most of the dishes under 20 dollars and many under 10, it's a good value for the quality and portion sizes.\n\nThe meat board is a great selection of cured meats with selections you wouldn't even find at the Boccalone meat counter. Highlights were the beef heart pastrami and the spiced coppa. The only average portion was the country pate which was really a terrine and a fairly average one at that.\n\nThe chickpea batter calamari is a great deal at 8:50. It is an entree sized dish with a huge heap of calamari on a bed of lupini beans. The beans were a nice compliment to the tender and crisp calamari.\n\nAlthough I was advised by the waiter that the Harissa Rubbed Sonoma Goat Leg Roulade was an appetizer, I found it to more than adequate as an entree. The severing of Roulade was around 3 ounces and was wonderfully cooked. There was still the richness and tanginess of the goat that perfectly matched with the harissa. \n\nThe vegetarian dish we had was just as good as all the meat dishes.   The house made potato gnocchi was light and fluffy and the sauce as well at the vegetables were delicious.\n\nThe only miss of the whole meal was the dessert. We had a chocolate cake with coconut ice cream and cherry sauce. The cake itself was dry and bland. The coconut ice cream was good but it is from Bi-Rite creamery and not made in house. The cherry sauce wasn't good enough to improve the texture or flavour of the cake.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

This actually was much lighter and delicious.\n\nNow for the burger...\n\nMind you, this is the 4th burger we've had and outside of Zuni, they were all pretty unique and tasty.  That being said, I wasn't disappointed in Serpentine's burger, there was just nothing to make it memorable.  The outside was pretty charred while the inside was very medium rare (I asked for medium) which is fine, but it seems like maybe the way they cook it is not making it even throughout the burger.  The meat was juicy and delicious tho, so a plus for that.  I asked for blue cheese which may have been a mistake because the taste is so strong but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  Other than that, there were pickled onions and pickles on a plain bun.  All were good but nothing that says 'this definitely should be on the top 10 burger list'.  \n\nSo with all that said, it was good - but when I go back to Serpentine (which I will!) I wont be jumping to get the burger.  I'm rating this #3 (or 4) of all the burgers we've had so far.  Stay tuned for the next burger review!", "author": "Melanie N."}

We shared an apple salad with spiced pecans, cheddar cheese, fennel, and an apple cider vinaigrette -- it was plenty for two to share.  I had the Indian-spiced braised lamb shank and my wife had the wild mushroom/chestnut ravioli.  The lamb was a huge portion - I took half of it home.  (No ravioli survived.)  For drinks I had the Broc Cellars Valdiguie -- an unfamiliar varietal.  It was nice but a bit light for my taste.  I loved the Travers Cote du Rhone, though.  My wife had a delicious aged Manhattan and a glass of Happy Canyon Merlot.  The desserts sounded great but we were too full.  Maybe next time.  The service was a bit slow -- it was a Friday night and the place was packed and the servers were working hard.  But otherwise everything was just great.", "author": "Robert W."}

It ended up being a satisying experience and I will definitely be back.\n\nFrom the exterior, this place looks mysterious and one could easily pass by it without a glance.  We were seated immediately. I ordered a fried egg sandwich and it was divine. The bread...what was that stuff? I don't know, but I'm drooling thinking about it.  The bread they used for the sandwich was really unique and yummy.  The texture was crumby, but the moistness held it together very well.

Their burgers are good and always cooked to order:  they truly understand \"rare\" which I prefer, and have hit the mark with all my friends regardless of burger preference.  I just had their pork tacos which were super yummy.  The service is always prompt, friendly and professional.  The decor is exactly what you would expect in Dogpatch.  I love this place!\n\nUPDATE:  the above is my previous review.  Went to dinner there last night 9/7/17 for the first time since the remodel.  What's up???  New management and new chef too???  Not sure but it sure felt like it.  Super disappointed.  Ordered the pork chop - all bone a grizzle.  Not fit for human consumption.  And the ceiling fans - did the construction guys who did the remodel forget to leave the controls?  They are set on high and feel like a category 4 hurricane!   When the fan continues to blow out your table candles you ought to know there's an issue.  Service was good and thankfully they comp'ed the horrible pork chop.

With one friend in particular, we have an unspoken agreement that we try a place neither of us have been to in town.  We chose Serpentine because the menu sounded both interesting and comforting.  What I mean by that is it is American with a twist.  \n\nWhat we shared:\n\nFresh oysters on the halfshell:  two different varieties, came out with grated fresh horseradish and prosecco mignonette, and lemon slices.  \n\nMaple roasted pumpkin salad:  large slices of sweet pumpkin with dense texture (could have been kabocha), with arugula salad and citrus vinaigrette.  \n\nBraised pork spareribs: they were really more like baked babyback ribs, with quince and cranberry mostarda\n\nChickpea battered calamari: with salad of italian butter beans and tomato\n\nOne ancient lemon martini: their version of lemon drop martini\n\n\nThe best part:  our server.  She was prompt, efficient and friendly.\n\nSecond best part:  fresh oysters.  But they did not require cooking.\n\nFor the most part:  This is one of those cases where everything falls a little short of expectation.  Roasted pumpkin was dry and the chunks were too large.  The ribs lacked the \"braised\" juicy texture, and they were dry.  The quince and cranberry mostarda was also just tart and dense. Calamari were not crispy even though they were battered and deep fried, they were rather swimming in oil.  \n\nOur biggest gripe really was how cold it was in the restaurant.  The place looking like a converted warehouse, we kept looking around for portable outdoor heaters but found none.  Instead we ate with our coats on and still shivered.\n\nMaybe I will try their burger next time if I happen to be in the neighborhood during summer time.", "author": "Alice A."}

Now that I spend about 70% of my time working in area, I'm proud to say I know about all these great places and I'm happy to patronize them and recommend them to all. \n\nBefore my shift, I like to take a seat at the bar for Serpentine's yummy brunch. Despite the noted wait times in previous reviews (as well as for any other brunch joint in SF on a Sunday), I've never waited for a bar seat and the service has always been quick and friendly. So far I've tried the Beef Brisket Hash and the Chicken Fried Steak. The hash was truly memorable as it was colored beautifully by the accompanying beets. The steak was the perfect little portion and boasted an amazing beefiness that only well sourced, good quality beef can possess. Both dishes came with home fries that were fried just like my grandma used to make em, with a light, crisp, golden brown exterior with a creamy interior. \n\nEven though I sit at the bar, I haven't had a drink yet, but the alcohol selection seems extensive with some organic pours on hand. I will have to stop in for just a drink sometime, post work. \n\nGo Serpentine for presenting a great brunch without the hassle of waiting.

The roast chicken, often a dangerous choice, was as juicy, crispy, and flavorful as any in town, and the bed of pureed squash and chicken juice was bread-sopping delicious.  Salad was strong.  Service was friendly but slightly unfocused - we said we were sharing but they didn't offer share plates or cutlery for two.  On the other hand the waiter made a spot-on wine recommendation.  The dessert list is slightly disappointing.  Each of the five or so choices was something you could easily do at home and involved a variant of Bi-Rite ice cream, so they were tasty but not at the creativity / effort level of the rest of the food and $7 seemed a little much for that.\n\nI love the interior, and that's part of the charm.  It's a dramatic high-ceiling brick warehouse that they've left in rugged form, then added a warm modern appointments down below at diner level.  It reminds me of some of the best designs from the 1990s when SOMA first became the place to be.  Here in the emerging Dogpatch neighborhood, it can be very cold, windy, and eerily lonely on the broad long streets outside... but inside it's warm and there's a crowd even on a quiet night.\n\nEven though it's not quite perfect the chicken was so good, and the vibe comfortable and endearing, so I would definitely put this on my short list where I'd like to come back because it all kind of hits the spot.", "author": "Gil S."}

We made sure to get there right as they opened, and they were great about getting us squeezed in right away. Absolutely exceeded my expectations, especially for a packed holiday weekend! The service was great all throughout the meal, too. Attentive but not too pushy; speedy but friendly. \n\nThe food was excellent. Our table sampled a lot of the dishes, and everyone seemed to quite like their food. I had a buckwheat pancake and split some steel-cut oats with a friend.

And not to mention the crazy cab ride over. The space is nice, this was my first introduction to the Dogpatch. Who knew SF has a Meatpacking District.\n\nI always thought that was the Castro. Cheap shot, but hello - to my people.\n\nBut the lush warehouse interior was empty, industrial, and slightly vacant... but the service and smiles more than made up for it. We sat at the bar, because our crowd of three (a new mother, a crazy hairdresser and me) decided that's how we roll.\n\nI don't remember our bartender's name, but he was from the East Coast--the hairdresser, Daniel knew him and he was cute. We called him Justin Timberlake. He was bringing sexy back in those delicious sidecars he made. He also looked so capable that I told him to surprise me, as I saw him pulling rosemary from a stem for another drink.\n\nBartenders that pull rosemary = they aren't fucking around.\n\nWe had a smorgasbord of appetizers. I don't remember the names, but I can list (some of) them off. I blame the third sidecar at this point.\n\nDuck gesiers = never tried innards of a duck, but they were good...polenta, classy touch!\nCalamari = really flavorful, accented well with some beans that I was chewing.\nMeat board = I wanted more meat... pat\u00e9 was off the chain, I am a sucker for pat\u00e9.\n\nAt this point, we were drunk and after getting a stink eye worse than Anna Wintour at Lindsay Lohan's debut at Ungaro from a few other patrons... we had to go. I guess it's not appropriate to talk about the penises, sexual practices, and things of the such over dinner.\n\nI'd love to explore this neighborhood again and would perhaps go back here on a date.

Between my partner and I, we ordered to share the Oso Buca..the pork with garbanzo beans and vegetables. It was so delicious how the pork pulled off the bone so easily. This dish had a lot of flavor.  I am a fan of brussel sprouts and loved the way Serpentine prepared it. It was deep fried and had a crisp grilled taste to it with some zest. We also had the lamp cheeks..so tender with a rich sauce. I had the rum punch and it was strong and tasty. Not bad to be know as a restaurant bar that has stiff drinks. They do not have beers on tap only bottled but they serve them in a glass and it's not a big deal.\n\nThe decor is minimal, modern, urban and nice: vaulted concrete ceilings, wood trim windows and mirrors. The only thing I didn't really enjoy and it's minor but would be a good thing for the hostess to know: we were seated at a two person table before the dinner rush. There were several tables to our side and when the next couple came in, they were seated right next to us instead of spacing them out at least one other table away since there were about 5 tables next to us. It felt awkward because all the other tables were empty and because we were so close there was no buffer zone for a private or intimate conversation at our table while there were several empty tables. I couldn't hear my partner. I had to keep leaning in to her him and he was talking loud and the couple next to us had to talk loud to hear each other as well.\n\nI know it's a restaurant so I don't expect it to be private and of course I expect people to be seated next to me at the next table but if i were the hostess and I've have been one, I would not have placed two parties that elbow close in that situation of not having nearby tables occupied.\n\nOverall, the food, drinks and service were great.\nGlad that I was able to be have been there.", "author": "Racheljoy R."}

So I found myself among coworkers and vice presidents alike.  Sitting at a table across from my manager, all I wanted to do was get to the punch line of my joke. Maybe the set up was too long or maybe the days' tedious events were much to alluring to ignore, but either way I wasn't finishing my joke.  The starters were ordered along with plenty of red wine.  Mr. Villa and I are well known to partake in libations fermented with a grape base so we had the reins in term of choosing wine for the table.  A few olives and a couple of glasses later the table was ready to make its selections for dinner. I had the gnocchi with mushrooms while my coworker, seeking a way to stick it to the company, arbitrarily ordered the most expensive dish on the menu. This dish just so happened to be a large sloppy piece of bone-in lamb shank. My buddy was embarrassed at its sheer size. While everyone else opted for something more manageable, my buddy really went for it. My gnocchi was underwhelming in taste, but had a wonderfully complex presentation and an even better smell. If I only ate with my eyes I would have been full.  The dish needed more depth, or maybe just salt. I understand the idea of preserving a delicately flavored dish, and this dish was indeed that, but more was needed. My friend's dish on the other hand was flavor incarnate. He was up to his elbows in lamb before he started offering some to the rest of the table. I took a sliver and found it very rich without much balance. I could go on, but this review is becoming aimless and verbose. All in all the food was not bad the service followed suit, and a good time was had by all. Would I go back with the wife?

Unfortunately, there are many other SFers that like to laze over blueberry waffles or huevos rancheros with perhaps an early start to the nightlife via mimosas and bloody mary's.  Which translates to a lot of competition trying to grab brunch at the best places over the wknd.\n\nOccasionally my go-to place, which is Mission Beach Cafe, has lines that are out of control so I was forced to find another place in my hood (soma/mission/potrero).  My friend recommended Serpentine to me for dinner, so on a whim, another friend and I decided to try it out for brunch.  We called for a \"reservation\" 30 min before we went into the restaurant, and was pleasantly surprised that we were seated immediately.\n\nAnd the food was quite yummy.  They also use fresh, seasonal ingredients for standard brunch fare and also have a small but high quality selection of lunch food as well.

My boyfriend had chicken with biscuits and gravy. he is pretty much a culinary expert and couldn't stop raving about the biscuit. I had \"Eggs Meat and Potatoes\" pretty straightforward and very good! Crispy potatoes cooked perfectly, and the bread was hearty.

Very fresh, very crunchy not burnt.  Perfect.  The scrambled eggs were slightly slimy and gooey.  Just the way I like it.  The steak sits on top of buttered toast/muffins?  I couldn't even tell..I just knew it was the shiznit the moment my tongue told my brain it was.  Yes, that wonderful.\n\nBread Pudding:  Personality - awesome.  Strengths:  Taste good.  Why - because it's official like a referee whistle.  Seriously, don't ask too many questions.  Just order and shove it in your mouth.

My friends and I were stuck in cross town city Friday rush hour traffic and basically running extremely late for our 6pm reservation. 15 minutes before our reservation, we call in to give them a heads up and they say no problem they can hold our reservation for up to 20 minutes. Well those 20 minutes evaporate as we're still sitting in traffic and I call back again to see if they will still hold our table. They tell us sure, no problem. Mind you, I'm totally worried as past experiences with restaurants consisted of dealing with an irate host/hostess who looks at me with disdain at not arriving on time (it's not like I'm late on purpose, I know what a reservation is) or losing the table b/c the allotted 15 minute buffer time has elapsed.\n\nOnce we finally get to the restaurant, we were greeted with a warm smile and confirmation that they still had our table ready for us. Whew! That alone made our evening. The hostess even commiserated with us and recommended for us to relax with a nice drink from the cocktail menu. That's pretty much 3 stars in my book.\n\nDinner was great, I ordered the duck leg, and my friends ordered the Prather Ranch burger (with guyere) and the Roasted Mary's Chicken. I may have overstuffed myself eating the leg. The polenta and persimmons served as a nice balance to the duck and basically contributed to me hoovering down the entire dish. I should have paced myself as I couldn't even enjoy dessert which was a chocolate bundt cake with chocolate Bi Rite ice cream with raspberry sauce. The cake wasn't overly sweet and the ice cream was amazing. I could only manage a few bites, but those bites left me wishing I could have more. :( \n\nGuess I'll have to add another place to the list of must visit again.", "author": "vivian h."}

My friends got stuck in traffic and arrived 15 min late but no worries.  I enjoyed a cocktail while waiting.  It was a simple martini straight up with olives and was fine but was not in your normal cocktail glass - maybe they had run out of the normal kind as I could see them on other tables?\n\nThe ambiance of the place was chic / cool but quite loud.  The restaurant was nearly full and everyone was talking loud to be heard which just made it louder.\n\nThe dinner menu has quite a variety of starters but we decided to just order our dinners.  The dinner menu was limited to eight items but they all sounded interesting.  I and another both ordered the hanger steak while the other friend ordered the House Made Potato Gnocchi with Wild Mushrooms.  We all loved our entrees.  The steaks were marinated and perfectly done as requested and excellent.  The portions are pre-carved and served on the plate and could have been slightly more generous but they tasted great.  The gnocchi was really delicious and I would be tempted to try that next time.  The wine menu was reasonably priced for an SF restaurant but not real extensive.\n\nThe service was good.

Serpentine manages to maintain a true Dogpatch feel, all the while remaining a more refined dining option than the three places I mentioned above.\n\nWhen I showed up for breakfast at 10:05, my friends had already been waiting for me.  They were sitting in a booth that reminded me of a muscle car.  Could it have been the brushed stainless steel tabletop, the charcoal leather seats, or, perhaps the combination thereof?  Whatever it was, it looked cool.  It also seemed as though our car had a sunroof, because the whole place was lit up with tons of natural sunlight.  The decor had a distinct industrial look to it, without being fake or pretentious.  Very well done.\n\nThe restaurant was pretty empty for a Saturday morning brunch, which allowed the waitress to focus on us.  She seemed a bit out of it, but she was there when we needed her.  She also refilled my coffee once, although I did have to wait a few minutes.\n\nWe ordered the buckwheat pancakes, served with blueberries and homemade whipped cream.  Despite being made out of heavier buckwheat flour, the pancakes were as fluffy and light as ever.  The homemade whipped cream was also a big hit.  I would strongly recommend getting at least one pancake to complement your meal (1 for $5.50, 2 for $8.50).  \n\nI also went with a basic scrambled eggs/bacon/potatoes/toast combo ($9.50).  The bacon was delicious: meaty, not fatty and cooked to perfection.  I was not a big fan of their \"crispy\" potatoes.  Whatever seasoning they use to make them golden brown didn't quite work for me.  It was OK, but I would have preferred simple, plain potatoes.  I really liked their levain toast which tasted like baguette bread, but a tad more sour.  It went very well with butter and raspberry jam.\n\nNo lines, easy street parking, pleasant atmosphere, decent sized portions and reasonable prices . . . you bet I'll be back SOON.  \n\nMore like 4.5 stars, but sometimes it's fun to round up.", "author": "Yan G."}

I expected this Dogpatch joint to be empty on a Wednesday at noon.  Not so.  Plenty of bustle.  I also loved the fact that three things jumped out at me on the menu.  I decided to go with the chick pea veggie burger -- any establishment that can master the veggie burger can probably master anything.  And this was quite the veggie burger.

The brisket is perfectly seasoned and melt in your mouth goodness, the potatoes cooked to perfection and the grilled bread is a great way to soak up the poached eggy goodness.\n\n\n I was torn between the hash and the fried egg sandwich since it was served on a homemade biscuit - we solved that problem by ordering a side of biscuits. Jo loved her fried egg sandwich - I may have to try that next time if I can tear myself away from the hash. The only item that we had that I wouldn't recommend is the pancakes - serving size is gigantic but flavor wise they were a bit bland and on the dry side.\n\n\n Our meal ended on a comical notea pigeon walked in the open front door and was cruising around on foot for a minute before deciding to check out the view of Serpentine from a pipe located directly over our table. Once he started grooming himself right above us we decided to move to the bar to have dessert/coffee. The staff couldn't have been friendlier and comp'd us dessert and gave us a discount on our meal for the trouble. A very nice touch, the type of gesture that will keep me coming back to Serpentine.

Despite the limited restaurant space, margins between tables were generous, and the high ceilings added to the feeling of spaciousness. I thought it was great for groups, as long as you make a reservation ahead of time.\n\nSERVICE: Stellar. Tim was our server-- he was super nice, funny, and responded well to friendly banter. It seemed like he was a bit harried towards the end of our meal (more tables to take care of?) but he always had a smile on his face.\n\nFOOD: Good.\n- Serpentine meat platter ($12): Tasty duck liver mousse. I didn't get a chance to try the other assortment of meats, but judging from the speed at which everything disappeared, I'd say it was pretty good.\n- Chickpea battered calamari ($8.50): Unique batter. Beans that came in the dish were a little underdone for my tastes.\n- Housemade potato gnocchi ($17): Delightfully soft, fluffy, perfectly seared little pillows. Based on the uber savory aroma emanating from this dish, I thought it would be too cheesy/heavy... but I was wrong! It was delicious and actually pretty light for gnocchi. \n- Pan seared local opah ($24.50): The fish was perfectly cooked: nice and flaky, medium, with a great pan seared crust. Too bad the fish alone was fishy tasting :( But when paired with the divine sauce, all was forgiven. It wasn't my favorite dish, but very well executed (save the poor base ingredient). \n- Ice cream sandwich ($7.50): OMG. YUM. Soft, cakey pumpkin cookies paired with Bi-Rite vanilla ice cream, SALTED CARAMEL sauce and nutty brittle? nomnomnom. This disappeared the instant it was set down. So good in fact, that there were requests I replicate this dessert for our puma potluck. :]\n\nOVERALL: Great neighborhood eatery. I'd come by more often if I lived in the area. Since I do not, I'll settle for visits every once in a while. Definitely planning to return for BRUNCH.", "author": "Susanna W."}

Service was somewhat better at Serpentine, but not without a few hitches (We were served another table's food.

We had to ask three times before being allowed to order. \n\nFood emerged from the kitchen haphazardly, one dish at a time, not all together as you'd expect. \n\nCrispy fried potatoes were almost perfect, highly salted, but not to excess, perfectly crisp on the outside and creamy inside. It was all downhill from there. \n\nThe potatoes arrived a good 10 minutes before anything else, so they at least served as an appetizer while we were waiting for our main courses. But they had been ordered as a side dish for me. \n\nSecond to arrive was my dining partner's Oyster Benedict. The oysters were almost inedibly old and stinky. I suggested that they be sent back, but she just pushed them listlessly around on her plate. \n\nMore than 5 minutes later, my Nicoise salad finally was delivered. \n\nIt looked as if someone had dumped a bunch of random items on a plate and sent it out without looking at it. Some of the sliced eggs were broken into bits and strewn across one side of the dish, The tuna was oddly served seared-side down, and was somewhat dried out from having sat around for a long time. And the boiled new potatoes were undercooked and inedible. \n\nWhen it was time for an iced tea refil, the waiter again developed a hearing disability and ran by repeatedly before grudgingly agreeing. He took my glass away and kept it for another 10 minutes before bringing it back with more tea in it. \n\nHigh prices, lousy service, and a kitchen which clearly does not care: this is truly a dining experience to be missed.", "author": "Jacob L."}

I never would have known it was there if a friend hadn't pointed it out. Its the sister restaurant of Slow Club in Potrero Hill, with a similar style and menu, slow food of course. The staff at Serpentine is more laid back, bordering on dippy, but the service is quite good.\n\nThe space Serpentine occupies is a classic San Francisco post-modern industrial brick affair with obligatory exposed pipes and white washed walls. We had plenty of time to take it all in as the wait without a reservation probably would have seen us seated and served back at 'Just For You', but hey, that's life.\n\nWith a round of musical plates I got to try the Brisket Hash and the Country Fried Steak. Neither really blew me away, although the poached eggs that came with the hash were pristine. The County Fried Steak seemed a little tough and the batter basically fell off at the approach of a utensil. The Hash was better, but very non-traditional with the addition of some sweet golden beets. The brisket was a little dry having been refried with the hash. The coffee was excellent.\n\n\nI'd go back with a reservation. I think I am less picky when I'm not grumpy.", "author": "Zac H."}

I devoured the Savory Bread Pudding with ham, Swiss, rosemary, and a bed of fresh greens with piping hot earl grey...YUM...heaven! I'm accustomed to having sweet bread puddings so I had to give the savory a try and glad I did. The menu is not overwhelming but it's not skimpy either. The fare will definitely have you filled up and please don't forget a piping hot cup of tea or coffee with your meal. \n\nThe ambiance is great because although a very open space with extremely high ceiling and a somewhat industrial feel with red brick walls and hard edges, the food is total comfort!

Nice because it wasn't noisy.  We had a terrific server.  We ordered many dishes and tried not to duplicate.  We had roasted green chilies,  the daily cheese, the chickpea battered calamari, the Gravenstein apple salad.   The chilies were adored by all but not to my personal taste (just too plain and chili-ish).  The calamari were wonderful.  The daily cheese was  blue....I heard no complaints but did not try it.\n\nThen we ordered the seared cod, the duck leg, the gnocchi, and the flat iron steak.  I actually ordered the gnocchi and received the cod by mistake; then the server insisted on buying us the gnocchi as well to share.  I am so glad I got the fish because this was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had.  It was so delicate and served with a crunchy slightly Asian-flavored (to me) vegetable accompaniment.  It was heavenly.  The gnocchi were perfect...not greasy at all...light, and with the peas, tomatoes, cheese...the best.  I tasted the duck and it was excellent...tender and flavorful.  My husband pronounced the steak a 91/2 out of 10.  Amazing.  \n\nDessert included two flavors of bi-rite ice cream (mint and banana) and the wonderful corn meal based upside down cake.  There was something else equally delicious but I forgot it in my blissful state.\n\nThe only criticism is that some of the apples in the apple salad were mushy.

And loud. Since all the warm tables near the oven were taken, we decided to walk over to Serpentine. (sorry, Piccino!! next time, I swear!!)\n\nOnce inside Serpentine, we were hit by loud layers of conversation. Quiet it wasn't. But it was warm and cozy, and there were 2 seats at the bar inviting us in for dinner. So we stayed.\n\nSo many things tempted me on their menu. There was roasted buffalo bone marrow, duck rillettes and savory bread pudding for starters, and stuffed quail, beef cheeks, and a burger for main courses.\n\nSince I'd cooked quail the night before, am laying off beef for a few days, and felt like comforty food, I decided on the roasted chicken. My friend got the quail. For starters, we opted for the arugula salad with avocado, bacon, frommage blanc & a red wine vinaigrette. \n\nThe salad was perfect. Light & peppery greens mixed with creamy cheese and avocado, tossed with salty, smoky bacon!\n\nThe chicken was lovely. A 1/2 chicken perfectly roasted and served on a bed of sauteed crispy french fingerling potatoes, spinach, frisee, fennel, and castroville artichokes, finished with a roasted shallot vinaigrette. I must admit, though, that the potatoes, while tasty, were not crispy. But I cleaned my plate.\n\nThe star of the meal was the quail. Cornbread Stuffed Wolfe Ranch quail on a creamy puree of butternut squash, grilled broccoli di cicco, and black trumpet mushrooms. It was the perfect combination of flavors and textures, and while I really enjoyed my dish, I admit I had a touch of food envy.\n\nWe opted to finish the meal with the apple thingy that was topped with airy lightly sweetened whipped cream.\n\nIn addition to the fine meal, I'll add that the service was great. The bartender described menu items in a lively and informed fashion. Courses were not rushed and our water glasses were never empty.\n\nAnother point is the wine list.

I would stop in and probably will just to sit at the bar and knock of few these badboys back.  \n\nWe had called on a Saturday to make some last minute reservations and the only opening was 9:15. We take the slot and head over an hour early knowing that they keep the occasional table open for walk-ins and worse comes to worse we drink at Yield. After being lulled into to bliss by the Whiskey Smash we are chatting with the awesome bartenders and someone taps me on the shoulder. The hostess had a table for us! I was actually a little disappointed with the expediency. I wanted a good reason to keep drinking and it had just been taken away from me!!!\n\nMy unhappiness disappeared quickly when our food arrived. First up, crispy fried oysters and hush puppies served with a dipping sauce. Spiced perfectly, the oysters were phenomenal and I'm not a big fan raw or otherwise. My main was hand cut egg noodles served with crispy pork belly. Clean, simple, and delicious. I've checked out the changing menu a few times since we've dined here and I was disappointed to see that this wasn't a staple on the menu as I envisioned myself becoming a regular at the bar and drinking Whiskey Smashes with crispy pork belly egg noodles. \n\nThe non-Serpentine (damn you!!) building was beautifully restored with an untouched exposed ceiling. It's a very open and welcoming spot. Which is only accentuated by the incredibly cool staff. We just had a damn good experience here and I hope to eat many meals here in the future.", "author": "Bucky K."}

When making the reservation for 11 people, we were told that our party would have to be split up; but when we arrived at the restaurant, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the staff had arranged a few of the tables-for-two so we could all sit together.\n\nOf all the dishes ordered, the best ones were the savory bread pudding, the buckwheat pancakes, and the red flannel hash. The bread in the bread pudding was warm and delicate, and though I'm not usually fond of ham, it was just right in the bread pudding. The hash was excellent-- I was surprised to find out that the meat in the hash was actually brisket because it was so tender. Went amazing with the perfectly poached eggs. But what absolutely killed me were the buckwheat pancakes. The combination of the buckwheat, walnuts, and apple compote-- though I feel like compote is too squishy a word to describe something that was just the opposite of soggy and disgusting-- was just perfect together. It would be criminal for you to go to Serpentine and leave without trying them-- one huge pancake can be shared between two or three people who just want to taste.", "author": "Le V."}

Delicious, conscientiously sourced food that's house-crafted, creative without pretension, and satisfying to the senses and soul (intellect and other mind-body parts happy to be along for the ride, but optional).  A hip atmosphere without withering hipster stares.  Attentive service by people who meet all the foregoing criteria.  Lovely cocktail and wine list.  Prices that don't raise your blood pressure.  I'm giving 5 stars not because there was a dish that I'll remember on my deathbed, but because it was a night that I would like to.\n\nEnough of the technicalities -- they did an awesome job with my 12-person birthday party last night.  Thank you, Serpentine!  FInding a restaurant of this caliber in SF that will not only cheerfully but skillfully host a party of 12, keeping your glasses full, the food coming, and the party flowing as you gab your way through the night like a family at Thanksgiving, is quite a feat.  Fait accompli at Serpentine.\n\nProps to the Acadian cocktail (because no birthday party is complete without absinthe), the Spiced Brentwood Yellow Corn Soup -- bowlful of summer! -- and the Housemade Potato Gnocchi with Braised Oxtail.  On the last one, I had to know what fava leaves tasted like.  Answer:  a kind of green beany parsley, which with the rest of the dish added up to delicious. \n\nThere's a bit of a story to how we ended up here for my birthday.  I tried to book a similar sized group here for my birthday 2 years ago, and they said sorry, they couldn't handle the large party, but referred us to their sister restaurant Slow Club.  We went to Slow Club and had a ridiculous good time.  So when this year's festivities rolled around, we asked Slow Club if we could stage a comeback, and they said sorry, they couldn't handle the large party, but referred us to their sister restaurant Serpentine.

We were among the last diners left - we didn't want to leave.  it was THAT good.\n\nFirst of all, the restaurant was buzzing like crazy on an otherwise quiet Tuesday night, so if you are going to go, I highly suggest that you make reservations.  (You are going to go).  Call or email the restaurant.  They are closed on Mondays.\n\nIt's a medium-sized industrial-style restaurant with high, high ceilings - almost like you are standing in a rectangle turned on its side.  Think lots of exposed brick and cement beams, but warm and inviting.  I love this type of restaurant - it plays up the structure of the space rather than trying to manipulate it too much.  The bar is long full of people, but they keep it well under control.  I had heard that it used to be cold inside, but they have fixed that problem and the temperature is warm and comfortable.  The overall feeling to me was slightly more dressed-up than Slow Club, which I liked.  It's also not nearly as loud.\n\nDrinks are not listed on the website, but if you are inclined, the Whiskey Smash is an outstanding cocktail.  Minty, sweet, and just damned tasty - my friend ordered it, and I had such drink envy!  Also, the wine list is totally reasonable - many bottles in the $30 range.  We had a very nice Pinot from Sonoma with our meal, which they let us taste before they brought it.  Reasonable, affordable wines make me very happy.\n\nAnd the food...wow.  The first thing that came out was the Crispy Hama Hama Oysters.  Divine!  Perfectly cooked, perfectly breaded morsels of juicy oysters served with tiny hush puppies and a delicious pimenton sauce for dipping.  MUST HAVE dish.\n\nHeirloom Chicory Salad - it's nice to have a creamy dressing for a change after so many vinaigrettes.  Toasted almonds and citrus make for a great flavor combo.\n\nSavory Bread Pudding - unique,excellent, another MUST HAVE dish. It has nettles in it, which makes the color of the pudding an interesting green with crispy brown edges.  The portion size is huge, plenty for 3-4 people to share.\n\nWarm White Shrimp and Potato Salad - this dish was different than what we expected - think potatas bravas with some shrimp thrown in.  Not my favorite, but mostly because everything else was so outstanding.\n\nRoasted Mary's Half Chicken - who is Mary and why is she roasted?  This is not a typo, this is how this dish is listed on the menu.  A simple, well-cooked half chicken - juicy and tender.  Mmmm.\n\nEarl Grey Pot de Creme - wonderful!  so creamy (but somehow not too rich), balance of sweet and tea flavors, with shaved ice on top for a delightful little shock of cold and texture.  MUST HAVE.\n\nOur server, Demitrius, took great care of us - he made great recommendations and the flow of our meal was orchestrated perfectly. We all laughed a lot, like old friends.  They were slammed with more business than usual (in light of the review that came out over the weekend), yet they kept their cool and we were very well attended to by all of the staff.  It was amazing to think that they have only been open for 3 months - they operate like they have been doing this forever.\n\nThe Ciffs Notes recap is:\n- make a reservation\n- drink the Whiskey Smash\n- MUST HAVE the Oysters, Bread Pudding, and Earl Grey Pot de Creme\n\nI will be back -the sooner the better.", "author": "Liz S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-08-20", "description": "I was glad to see Serpentine open in the Dogpatch, as I work in the neighborhood and there just aren't many places you can go for quality food and a cocktail nearby.  I really like most of the food...the savory bread pudding is one of my favorites and the arugula salad is spicy and tasty and has edible flowers in it.  The short ribs are a bit too fatty but the fried Hama oysters are delicious.  I started eating here at least once a week, and whether I sat at the bar or a table, the service was cool and quick. \n\nI really like the staff here...the bartenders are great, the servers are intelligent and friendly and my food always comes how I ordered it.  Unfortunately, this restaurant is so badly managed that things keep going wrong every time I eat here.  And that's why one of my favorite restaurants gets a one-star review and why I will never eat there again. \n\nWhy should anyone have to wait an hour for a table when they show up on time for their reservation?  Yet this has happened to me not once but TWICE and I have seen many folks having trouble with the same issue while I was dining. \n\nOnce, my girlfriend arrived five minutes before me, knew I was on my way, and was told by the hostess that she could not be seated without me, even though we had a reservation.  My girlfriend offered to sit at the bar, and the hostess told her they needed the space for dinner customers.  Now that is just plain insulting. \n\nThe day hostess in particular is snotty and unapproachable. She acts like it is a tedious chore to help anyone in any way, and seems to be much more interested in herself than any of the people that walk in the door.  I have seen her roll her eyes at honest questions from customers more times than I can count.  I finally stopped coming to Serpentine for lunch because every time I interacted with her it pretty much ruined my mood.\n\nIn fact, the whole host staff acts like it is beneath them to accommodate anything a customer asks. I just read the reviews here on Yelp and there are so many stories of hostesses making people wait needlessly, refusing to call cabs, ignoring customers, being unaccommodating, seeming annoyed, and so on.  You may ask...why would the management keep these people on??  \n\nAh, but I know why!! A few weeks ago, I spoke to one of my favorite servers about it, and the server told me that the hostesses are the managers.  Ah...now it makes sense.  \n\nAnd it means I won't be going back to Serpentine. \n\nYou know, you can tell a lot about a restaurant by watching their staff interact.  If it is a cool place to work, people are happy and brisk and chatty.  Most of the staff really seem to enjoy themselves and their jobs; they seem to be great people.  But the hostess/managers almost never interact with any of their staff and when they do, you can tell from body language that these folks don't like their employees too much. And the feeling seems to be mutual.   \n\nThe final straw was when I saw an off-duty hostess walk in and sit down with her friends about a half hour after my group was seated. We could not believe it when we waited 40 minutes for our entrees while watching their table fill up with some of the same dishes we had ordered.  \n\nIt's too bad that the catalyst for my entry into Yelp is negatively motivated; I've been reading reviews on here for months and have followed many recommendations that have proved fruitful.  I have been meaning to get on here and post some great things about some of my favorite restaurants and bars in the City...unfortunately, this just pissed me off so much that it became my reason to dive in. \n\nTo recap: if you like great food and a quick, friendly, cool staff but don't mind being treated like an annoyance when you walk in the door, then Serpentine is the restaurant for you.", "author": "Good Food Lover V."}

Review here: http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=_pIG1_s6Bzymn1zeyLjBHQ&q=hard+knox\n \nOn Thursday night of last week - my friend and I decided to check out \"Serpentine\".  Now, I have never been to \"Slow Club\", which is on my list of PLACES TO TRY- but since Serpentine is owned by the same people of the allegedly fabulous SC - I was excited to try it out.\n \nWell - WOW.\nI'm impressed.\nOn a tall. white building, which appeared newly renovated, you see S-E-R-P-E-N-T-I-N-E spelled downwards on a building.  Compared to my lunch hour visit to Hard Knox when parking was impossible, dinner-time parking was simple.  Walking in - it's a hip location, very crowded with people eating, but also standing around just mingling at the bar area.  Many of the people hanging out at the bar were probably local to this area, and I had to agree that this was a good \"after work\" hangout.  The hostess was friendly and pleasant - and we were seated immediately in a corner table for two.\n \nOur server was also quite pleasant, and while she was busy and not exactly attentive - - she did come around often enough to keep us content.  The food, however, took longer than I would have liked.  \n \nThe wine list is nice - - with wines from all regions and many different varietals, most available by  the glass.  \nThe menu is exactly how I like it.  When I read a menu, I want to see the offerings and descriptions, and WANT to try that dish.  I want to end up having a hard choice because I am not sure which, of the many, I'd like to have, since I have to narrow it down to a few.  Serpentine's menu reads delicious.\n \nAlas, since it was only two girls eating dinner, and because I simply wasn't that hungry (unheard of, I know, but it happens once in a blue moon), we shared on appetizer and each ordered an entree.  The appetizer of the evening was:  BEEF MARROW BONES.  Served with toasted bread and coarse salt, you peer down a big ol' bone, dig your knife in and scoop out the goodies inside, spread it on your bread with salt, and wolf down.  It's a very heavy dish both in texture AND taste, but the kumquat salad that they served with it was a PERFECT blend with the kumquats sweet rind, sour middle and rather bitter flavor.  The citrus juices just really brightened up the taste of the marrow, and actually enhanced the dish.\n \nFor our entrees, my friend had the half-chicken - and the taste I had of it was tender and juicy.   It wasn't deep-fried, and very fresh.  It was good, but nothing about it stole the show, so to speak.  I, strangely enough, ordered the Hamburger, and added the option of Gruyere cheese, cooked medium rare - and it was very, very good.  It wasn't quite \"medium-rare\" but still, it was great meat frrom Prather Ranch, and the condiments just worked.  Extra points, too, for bringing out my ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise - ON THE SIDE.  The only one I use is mayo - so this was cool, or else I'd have to spend 2 minutes scraping off ketchup.  Blech!#@!@\n \nFor dessert, we shared a warm Apple Crisp with a vanilla cream type of sauce atop it.  It was pretty much a mashed up Apple Pie a la mode - - and who can go wrong with that?  I couldn't stop picking at it.\n \nNow, more than ever, I am excited to check out SLOW CLUB.  If Yelpers still believe SC to be better than Serpentine, then it must be quite memorable.\n \nFor Serpentine, I'd go again to try their different dishes.  It was a good dinner with outstanding company, great wine, and even finished with a bang with that dessert.  It broke down to $45 per person or so including tip, which was alright, given that we only had two glasses of wine, one appetizer, 2 entrees, one of which was a mere hamburger, and a dessert, but it was tasty enough to not make me feel like it was money wasted.\n \nSerpentine - GOOD FOOD!", "author": "Grace K."}

Among us we had the beet salad, the spinach salad, lamb riblets, rabbit, the burger, and the flat iron steak.  While it was a very autumnal menu, well, it's cold outside, and it tasted exactly right.  The wines we had also were good.\n\nSecond, the ambiance:  whew.  Well, the bones are good, but the space is carved up a bit awkwardly (by the placement of the bathrooms amidship), and it's very loud.  I would have kept the integrity of the open space (by putting the bathrooms in back), and though it's heresy, I'd  possibly paint the exposed brick white to make it uniform in color and to provide a blank palette in order to hang warming art.  I'd break up the space not with the big wall of the bathroom, but instead with some library tables, or something antique.  (A similar cavernous space that's terribly warm is the delightful Boat Street Cafe in Seattle, which marries warehouse aesthetics with a pared-down Provence vibe to great effect.)\n\nThey should lower the din too, perhaps with some velvet curtains.   It would be worth the money to really consider how to bring the sound down some.  Way too loud last night until around 9:30.\n\nBut it's Slow Club in its food, and I liked it.

The bread pudding was to die for -  a bready, cheesy, herby, square of absolute lip smacking goodness. The spinach bacon salad was fabulous as well. I got the pork shoulder as my main course - the meat was so tender it fell from the bone with even the tiniest poke. \n\nThroughout the meal, service was great - our server was very pleasant.  However, I had a major problem with the way they handled our departure. Like I mentioned earlier, my friends and I came from the Marina. We had arrived via cab. As our meal came to a close, I asked a server if somebody wouldn't mind calling us a cab. She came back 1 minute later to tell us that she tried but couldn't get through - so we'd better start calling ourselves. Okaaaaayyy.....my friends and I got through to a couple of places but after we'd been waiting around for a good 30 minutes with no cab in sight, we went back in to ask for help again. \n\nBy this time we were the last customers hanging around the restaurant. I asked yet again that they help us get a cab where they proceeded to tell us that the cab company that they call had turned off their phones already. When we asked them if they had a phone book, they responded with a, \"probably not,\" and walked away.\n\nWe finally flagged one down ourselves by sheer luck and made it home but I couldn't help but feel slightly miffed at the way the restaurant handled our situation. If you're going to have a restaurant in a location like the Dog Patch, you're more than likely going to have many patrons coming from neighborhoods that aren't near by and who will be requesting cabs.

I make regular trips back to SF just to fulfill my cravings for these savory delights. But, something profound happened during my last trip up north. My dear friend Michelle brought me to Serpentine. You see I have a French fetish. Im crazy about all things french. Especially young waiters with thick accents. Opps, I digress. We tried Cafe Claude earlier in the week. The food was so so. The drinks were fantastic and waiters w/ French accents lulled my irritation over some really shitty Rillettes so it was not a complete loss. This dear friend knew how crazy I am about the Rillette.

I had arrived a little early and had a great margarita at the bar with El Tesoro tequila, not a brand your average bar carries. The bartender was nice but a little too introverted for my taste, I like mine chatty and fun. \n\nThe food was well prepared, yummy and a pretty good bang for the buck.  I look forward to eating at Serpentine again and trying other selections from the menu. That being said, for \"simple food\", I'd rather eat at 1550 Hyde Street and Wine Bar, which I would go to more often if it was closer to my house and had easier parking.\n\nOne big plus Serpentine gets is for the convenient location, the parking in the evenings in Dog Patch is very easy and it's close to Bernal Heights (where I live). This is a big plus, sometimes convenience wins the day. I like to dine early, so the combination of parking and getting seated could sway me to eat here much more often. The price wasn't outrageous either, it was reasonable for the quality.\n\nThe food:\n\nTo start, we shared the Savory Bread Pudding (nettles - roasted red onions - swiss add mixed greens $11.50). That dish is FANTASTIC. It's like the best stuffing you've ever had and tastes of artichokes and butter. \n\nI had the Escarole Salad (shaved sunchokes - sieved egg - bacon lardons - tarragon garlic cream $8.50) which was very good and tangy although the shaved sunchokes added no special flavor to the dish, it was really more like a garnish.\n\nFor entrees...\nI had the White Shrimp & Anson Mills Grits (sauteed onions - poblano peppers $10.50) which was very good and comforting, but should have been spicy, since it had poblano chilis in it, but wasn't.\n\nOne friend had the Roasted Half Chicken (roasted ruby crescent potatoes - baby fennel - nicoise olives - catstroville artichokes - savoy spinach $18.50) which was very delicious.\n\nMy other friend had the Marin Sun Farms Flat Iron Steak (parsley root puree - roasted shallots - baby carrots - broccoli rabe - anchoiade $24.50), which was good, but not my favorite.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a banana ice cream thing, which was unremarkable. Their dessert menu is nothing special and seems more like an afterthought. I have a feeling they do not have a pastry chef at Serpentine. Hopefully they will add a better selection of desserts in the future; thus, the one star deduction for this review.\n\nWith 2 glasses of wine and a large bottle of sparkling mineral water, the bill including tip was $45.00 each. Not bad.\n\nAfterwards we walked down to the ReTox Lounge on 20th Street for a drink. I love the Dog Patch district and now there's another great place to eat there other than the Hard Knox Cafe.", "author": "Yvette K."}

We were wowed by the cocktail menu as well as the look of this place.  Since we all work in the Interior Design industry we are total snobs when it comes to decor.  This place was dead on.  A great industrial feel, cold cement and filament light bulbs.  Horrah.\n\nThe cocktail menu is definitely worth the trip to the dog patch on its own.  The food was as expected for the decor and price range.  \n\nI had a second visit with a group of friends in from New York.  I had mentioned that I've been before to my friend who organized the dinner so she made a rez and we checked it out again.  The cocktails, again, are still awesome.  The food was pretty delicious.  The service had a few mishaps (my drink was mixed up with someone else and they forgot one of our entrees), but the Owner (maybe manager) was really attentive to our group and made corrections quickly.  \n\nOverall, probably the best place in the dog patch.

Where can you show up at 7:45 pm on a Thursday and find parking it the City? That alone garners four stars. \n\nWe were promptly seated in a back booth with great views of this industrial space.  This is the kind of space that appeals to me, not too much decoration to cover up the natural aesthetic of the building.  \n\nThey have a very reasonably priced wine list, not over the top in terms of selection but our $40 bottle of pinot was quite good.  We began with two salads, one with mustard greens and the other with beet greens, both were excellent.  I was really thrilled by the freshness of both, they were clearly right outta the ground and used seasonally fresh ingredients.  We also split the lamb riblets on the advice of our waiter.  TASTY!  Seriously sooo good.  \n\nWe then moved on to pork chops and sea bass.  Even though there were four of us we still did that dorky couple business where each couple orders the exact same thing, so much for variety.  I thought the chops were tasty, but not to the level of Nopa, my date had the same opinion.  For me the chop was a little too, um, savory?  The sea bass looked good, with both parties cleaning their plates so I think that's a safe bet. \n\nWe finished the meal with the goat cheese dessert with strawberries, fresh cream and cracked pepper.  WOW.  It was seriously amazing.  The hit of the meal outside of the lamb riblets! \n\nI didn't notice any problems with the service, although I will say that it took quite a while for our entrees to come after the appetizers were served.  Not a problem for our group as we were chatting, but could be a problem if you were on a tight time schedule. \n\nAll in all a great meal, I'm trying Slow Club next...but this place is great alternative, especially if you want to park, eat and ride.

The steak arrived cooked perfectly and sliced, not sure if they did that because we were sharing or if that's standard, but it worked well, and the meat was very good. \n\nWine list was a bit funky - lots of unusual varietals, and a focus on the lower end - it seemed like sort of a \"bargain wines\" list... Not super exciting, and so I expect that will be refined with time. The space is sort of recycled concrete/wood arty/industrial - it's OK but not going to wow anyone on design points. Service was solid, especially for their third night. Full bar - nice to have in the now fully \"emerging\" area. I'll be back.", "author": "Bowen D."}

Especially because I've gone to their other restaurant, The Slow Club numerous times over the years, and it has always been great!  \nBut the staff at Serpentine needs some help!\n\nWe got in for lunch about 2:40PM, they stop serving at 3PM. \nThere were two tables of people already sitting and eating. We were seated immediately. And given menus and water. So far so good. \nIt seemed that there were at least four people on the floor and whoever else was in the kitchen. So why did it take ten minuets to order and then 20 min to get our food?? We also order cocktails when our food arrived and those didn't come until well after we were finished eating. \n\nI think our total sit down time was an hour and fifteen minuets. If a restaurant says they serve till a certain time they need to be prepared to serve up to the last minuet, or change their times! \nWhat's going on with this place? I know we came in towards the end of the luck time, but we were the only table!!!\n\nTo top it all off our bill was $68.35. It was paid with a $100 bill. The change should of been 31.65.  $21.00 was brought back to our table.\nWas that a self tipping custom that I not aware of?  After trying to get the waiters attention, we pointed out that the change was wrong. He said it would be fixed. This time he brought back $31.00. Still .65 cents short. which wouldn't of been a big deal if we weren't shorted the first time! Again we tried to get the waiter's attention, this time with major attitude he asked what was wrong. We told him It was still short. He then counted the cash in front of us at our table, and said, \"oh a dollar\". (65cents) He then tossed a dollar from his apron on the table with the rest of the money, and walked away. And that's exactly what he got a dollar! \n\nI don't know about the rest of you out there feel about this. But if a business is going to round change out, it should be in customers favor!

It was so dark we felt we were sitting outside on someone's deck, without lights. Which can be nice when you're on someone's deck in the dark without lights, but in a restaurant, personally, I prefer to be able to see my food when enjoying it. \n\nThe menu was, um, a bit different.

All of us found ourselves flipping to the 2nd page to see what further food options there were (but it was just the drinks list). So at first, we were a bit skeptical. But when the food arrived, we were all very happy with the flavors and our selections. \n\nThe savory (veggy, FYI) bread pudding is a must try simply because of its uniqueness.

Tealights added a charming romantic glow, perfect for lingering and chatting.\n\nFood/Wine.  Interesting items; we shared various small plates.  Highlights included: the baby red mustard green salad in which the fresh mint punched up the spicy/bitter greens while the goat cheese and buttermilk dressing soothed things down; and the savory bread pudding that came looking like a piece of coffee cake but the dense, creamy concoction was tasty and filling.  Just OK were: the Monterrey sardine which was one fried fish (with head) without much character but the accompanying olives and roasted artichoke were delicious; and the generous portion of lamb riblets which were tender but smothered by a brown sauce that was a tad too salty.  Didn't get to dessert this first time (ducked across the street to Yield for apres dinner wine and chocolates instead).  Nice wine list, reasonably priced; decent stemware.\n\nService.

I was still mighty hungry. \n\nOur server returned and broke the news that they were out of the bread that the sandwich came on and could they bring me something else?

I have some dietary constraints so was asking if certain dishes were made with dairy and my questions were met with such impatience and near disdain.  That already soured the dining experience, but later when I found a hair in my salad and pointed it out to Victor, instead of an apology (there was never an apology) his response was a blunt \"so you want a new salad?\" and then as he was walking away a frustrated shaking of his head and I imagine (since his back was to us) a rolling of the eyes to go with it.  As a whole, his demeanor was unpleasant, unfriendly, and certainly not about serving the customer.  \n\nDinner in December = 5.  In this case, when I was asking the waiter (unfortunately I don't remember his name) which dishes could be made to accommodate my dietary constraints, he not only pointed out items on the menu but pro-actively asked if I wanted the chef to make me a dish of roasted vegetables instead.

What I love about the burger is that when you ask for medium rare, you always get a perfectly cooked, juicy burger with just enough toppings to make it interesting, but not overwhelm.

I really enjoyed the Whiskey Smash, although it was a little bit too sweet & left me feeling pretty hyper. I sipped on some Old Potrero next, & then it was dinner time. Since the bar tab was very much on the expensive side, I opted to go with the burger for dinner, which was superb. I cleaned my plate, fries & all.\n\nIn summation, I loved the space, the food was fantastic, service attentive, but drinks were on the expensive side.\n\nI'd definitely go back if another situation called for it.", "author": "Pete J."}

The steak was delicious and very tender.  I did not care for the mustard greens, they were too bitter for my taste.  Maybe they were cooked beautifully, but I just did not like them.  One of the things that bothers me about places like Serpentine is how skimpy they are with the wine servings .  The serving was not even half a glass. If the glass is about ten bucks, I expect a little more.  \n\ni ordered the mascarpone cheesecake with candied kumquats and meyer lemon curd for dessert, and I was disappointed.

I hopped over to Serpentine this weekend (courtesy of their new reservation line) and had a great dinner.\n\nCrispy Hama Hama Oysters: The oysters were fresh and tender, as their Washington pedigree would suggest, accompanied by a decent litter of hush puppies.  Definitely recommended.\n\nPork Rillettes: I was expecting a bit more flavor out of the rillettes, having to cover for its extra-mild presence with the accompanying mustard.  The texture was nice, and would have made nice pyramids to hold a pig's tail like how the old Frenchie's used to do, but ultimately needed a bit more salting.  Recommended if you're one of those people that likes unsalted over salted peanut butter.\n\nSavory Bread Pudding: Awesome.  Bread pudding with some body to it.  I'm usually not much of a fan of bread pudding, but the nettles pesto (where'd they pull that one out of?) made me reach for more.  Definitely recommended.  Although, +$4 for mixed greens to go with...really?  \n\nBraised Prather Ranch Beef Cheeks: Really solid all around.  Braised to perfection, and well buffered by the leek and potato puree, it was the perfect course for a colder night.\n\nAlmond Blancmange: A close cousin of panna cotta, this dessert left me a bit wanting.  It was just a chalky taste from start to finish, and the sprinkle of blood oranges wasn't sweet enough to keep it together.\n\nOverall, it's a gem.

That's how long the wait was.\n\nLooking at the menu, I was saddened at the prices. $11.50 for a hamburger. Good lord that's a lotta money. It is a reasonable price for an entree, but the idea of paying $12 for a burger and fries just seemed off to me. The service was great and accommodating though, checking to see what the chef could concoct for our Vegan friend (note to vegans: ask them what they can make for you, as there is nothing on the menu that is strictly vegan).\n\nAll of our food was delicious, and I'm very torn on giving this place only 3 stars.

No problem. At the bar, I ordered an absinthe, of which there were two on the menu, but I wasn't asked which I would prefer, so was given the $14 version, which was better I was told by the waiter later during my meal. Usually, the bartender is supposed to prepare the absinthe for you, but in this case, I was given all the necessary items and left to my own devices. Minus one half a star. \n\nThe hostess passed by after ten minutes and we stopped to ask her if our table was ready. She said it was but she'd bring us menus if we wanted to eat at the bar. I got the sense she was annoyed by our inquiries, but oh well. I was annoyed by the other bartender telling us we needed to pay for our drinks at the bar, rather than being able to put them on our tab and take them to our table. For such a classy place, you shouldn't have to be told what to do. Minus another half star. \n\nOur waiter was superb, funny and informative, with excellent knowledge of the menu and suggestion for wine pairings. The lamb riblettes were amazing, as was the chicken with trumpet mushrooms, black rice, and carrots. A starter salad with cranberries and goat cheese was also delicious.

The Monice's Shrine cocktail is my absolute favorite (I love, love grapefruit juice and sparkling wine). If up to me, we would get a meat board to share, pickled vegetables to share, chicken livers to share, any salad they make to share (every salad I have had has been amazing), and either a fresh fish dish (seasonal), or a cheeseburger for the main course. \n\nFor dessert, an ice cream sandwich or the meyer lemon buttermilk cake (my most favorite), if they have it. Though, I did just have their autumn ice cream sandwich with pumpkin cookies, vanilla ice cream, a salted caramel sauce, with pepita praline - absolutely phenomenal. \n\nHonestly, having eaten many different dishes they have had, I would recommend almost anything off their menu, depending on what you have a tooth out for.

We had the biscuit & gravy, granola with yogurt and buckwheat pancakes. The biscuit was nice and texturally was spot on, but my problem was with the gravy which was way over-salted. The granola was tasty, but was served with ordinary natural yogurt which really diluted the flavor of the homemade granola. Greek yogurt would have been a better pairing because of its thickness. The buckwheat pancakes were also just ok. They were a little dry. The candied walnuts, fruit and maple syrup that they were served with really made the dish and a bite including all the components was quite satisfying. Sadly, there wasn't enough of anything but the syrup to have with every bite and I haven't enjoyed drenching my breakfast in maple syrup since before puberty. The interior is quite cool, but service was slow and I got the impression our server lost interest in us when we didn't order cocktails. The tables are super close together, so if you have any junk in the trunk you run the risk of grazing the neighboring table's meal. I would consider going back for dinner (and cocktails!) but only with a four top and I'd request one of the booths so as not to be wedged in next to other dinners.", "author": "WaltzingMatilda T."}

The eggs are overcooked about 1 out of every 3 times I order it though so it's not totally consistent but it's still good. They add a little lemon zest to the dish which gives it a nice bit of extra flavor when done right but they often add way too much. I've had the fettuccine for lunch here before and it was pretty bland. The bread putting is quite tasty and savory. I still haven't tried this place for dinner but will eventually.\n\nOverall the food is ok. I'll keep going here for the benedict on days when Butler and the Chef isn't an option.

If it wasn't for my friend's recommendation, I would have never known this place existed since there were no street level windows to peep in. The painted sign on the building's corner column was a subtle hint of the industrial feel of the dining area.  We were graciously seated and kept busy with some bread while the kitchen warmed up.  I ordered the open face ham sandwich with fries.  I don't even like ham but I think I do now thanks to Serpentine.  The open face part of the sandwich took some getting use to.  I saw how goofy my friend looked trying to eat it like a pizza so I opted for the knife and fork.  The same goofy friend later tells me that SFWeekly voted Serpentine as having the best burger in the city or bay or general area.  I would have loved that piece of information when we were ordering.

Feeling hungry for some grilled meatness after the holidays I made a reservation on Friday night and showed up in Dogpatch with my burger companions, Melanie N. and Gene X. Turned out I screwed up and made the reservation for the next day, but the folks at Serpentine were kind enough to still give us a table with a minimum of wait. We took our spot in a nice booth and ordered some drinks. I got a cocktail made with brandy, vermouth, Cynar, and a lemon twist which was great and had a nice balance between sweetness and bitterness. Usually we just get the burger, but the menu looked appetizing enough that we decided to get an order of Chickpea Battered Calamari. The decision process went like this: Gene and I, \"I'd be up for X, Y and Z\", Melanie - \"Calamari\". No sense in arguing. :) In any case, I'm not a big fan of calamari normally, but Serpentine's version turned out to be delightful.\n\nThe burgers were delivered soon after. They came with arugula, pickled onions, pickle slices and a plateful of fries. I was disappointed to see that mine was medium, since I ordered it medium-rare, while Melanie had the opposite problem. The burger itself was decent, with that specific flavor of Prather Ranch that I've learned to recognize. One thing that turned me off a bit was that half of the burger- and by that I mean not one side or another, but actually half - was charred enough to give each bite an acrid taste. Uneven grill temp is all I can think of. The pickled stuff worked well with the meat, and I enjoyed the fries as well. However, I just can't get excited about this meal since it was simply a decently executed burger with nothing special to make it memorable. I could buy Prather Ranch meat, grill the same patty, use the same Acme roll and come up with a version damn close to or better than what I had. So this puts this burger in 4th place on my list so far.\n\nI wish I could give Serpentine 3.5 stars, since the calamari and the service were good. But it'll have to be 3 stars, because of the problems with the burger and the lack of imagination that it conveyed, despite the cost ($14 with cheese). I hope to return to try something else on the menu and update my review then.", "author": "Andrei Z."}

I absolutely adored my tequila and grapefruit concoction, but my friends were off-put by the liberal dose of bitters in their bellinis.   The other bummer about the cocktails is that it took FOREVER for me to get my Ruby drink - it definitely prevented me from ordering another, and I really wanted to!\n\nThe brunch menu is incredibly tempting - egg sandwhiches, red flannel hash, eggs benedict, chicken-fried steak - how can anyone with a hearty appetite and no fear of cholesterol resist???\n\nI had the red flannel hash and really enjoyed it - the beets were delicious and the beef morsels were well cooked and extremely flavorful - but, there wasn't a lot of the beef in the dish.  The eggs on top looked like perfect little round ghosts, but, inside my yolk was overcooked and almost entirely hard.\n\nThe table also ordered the egg sandwhich - and the home-made sausage on that was outstanding, but the rest was pretty standard.  The chicken fried steak was probably the best of them all - really delicious steak and coating.  We also ordered the savory bread pudding, which was really good, but my friends said the savory bread pudding at Picino nearby is much better.\n\nThe potatoes that were servered were the little peeled, cubed and fried type - which, I like, but I normally prefer the unpeeled earthier type of friend potatoes with break fast.\n\nI loved our server - she was warm and fun and genuine and she also made sure that we ordered their delicious buckwheat pancakes with apples for the table, and, I must say, was really the highlight of the meal!  The pancakes are topped with a delicious hand-whipped, not-too-sweet whipped cream and were certainly worth going back for.\n\nBy the end of the meal we were all stuffed - and because of the pancakes, we could not bring ourselves to order dessert...but, I have to say I really enjoyed the meal and want to return.

It was way overcooked to the point of being dry and tasteless.  How can fava beans, cherry tomatoes, olives, and romaine hearts have no flavor?  Somehow, at Serpentine, they did...and they added nothing to an already overcooked, tasteless piece of fish.  The sea bass was a giant waste of otherwise great ingredients.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was several delicious cocktails, including a mojito that everyone said was \"perfect.\"  The Russian River Red Pinot Noir was also good.

The space is lovely... someone put a lot of care into the decor and it shows.  I didn't like the metal tables (loud, cold) but besides that, no complaints.  We went for lunch... savory bread pudding w/ nettles and pesto to start (which was okay, a little... monotonous or something after a few bites)... roast beef for me (yummy) and a burger for the 'spund (burgery).  Why people order burgers when they aren't in their car on HWY 5 is kind of beyond me, but I guess I did marry the guy, after all.  Anyway.  \n\nFor dessert we had an Earl Grey pot de creme, interesting take on the concept.  The server was organized and knowledgeable... I hate it when I ask for a wine suggestion and they say, \"let me get you the list.\"  No, my food is sitting here, you see it and should know what will go well with it if you know your list well... so just suggest something.  He suggested a lovely young Rioja that went perfectly with my dish.  \n\nOnly slightly odd thing was the portion sizes.  My 'spund had the bread pudding last week and said it was half the size it was this time... and my beef dish was decidely the mini-version of the same dish at the next table.  It was plenty for me; I was horrified when my neighbor's dish came out and dreading a half-cow-portion when my turn came, but mine was back down to a normal 8-10 oz or so.

As one person in our party put \"it's like someone left a butter flavored cloud on my plate.\"  And that it was.  The flank steak was really well cooked, minimal fat, great flavor that made use of the amazing meat.  \n\nThe duck was allegedly heavenly, as well.  That member ate it right up! without even offering anyone else a try, which should tell you a bit about how good it was.  \n\nBut some of the other suggestions, well, less impressive.  The whiskey smash was so much a girlie drink, it should have come with a paper umbrella and a maraschino cherry it was so damned sweet.  Not very many guts either.  The drink was also so watered down, i think i actually hydrated myself. The wine list is pretty impressive though, with a good smattering of choices in each category of wine.  Some reasonable, some a special treat (but not too special).  \n\nWe didn't try the most recommended treat (the earl grey creme brulee), but the lemon tart with marshmallows felt like a cheap combo.  At least it made the lemon tart part feel cheap.  Not that it was badly prepared, it's just that marshmallows have a distinct flavor that took from the experience for some reason.  \n\nOur waiter swooshed his rump and pivoted like the best runway model.  And everyone was attentive.  Wine was quickly refilled, he was super fast with pretty much everything, and knew when to make his presence known and also was nice enough to ask us if we were going to hang out and talk or we'd like to pay (we were there later in the evening).\n\nIn all, it's a nice place that has a really nice ambience, without being too loud or too poorly lit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-14", "description": "We had mixed reactions about this place. We really wanted to like it and after walking 2.6 miles from Union Square to get there, we were hungry enough to be generous but it just didn't mesh.  The area, dog patch, is interesting enough and unique enough to be intriguing. After walking through a mile of a literal no-man's land of parking lots and empty lots, we got to this area of kind of warehouse like businesses and then this little downtown. There's a bar down the street, and ice cream store across the street and a couple of coffee shops (that close up early, however). All seem relatively new and we were kind of excited to be exploring a new neighborhood. Serpentine itself has a kind of cold, concrete, metal feel to it. High ceilings and small space with a bar (the stools looked very uncomfortable) and some tables up front split by the bathrooms and a few tables in the rear. We were seated up front next to another table for two, with two empty tables to our right (along a banquette like seating area). A big table for 10 was being seated right across from us.  The waiter was attentive, almost to much so.  We like slow meals, we like to finish our drinks and take our time over the menu, and perhaps unfairly, we like the waiter to figure this out.  This waiter did not and even after I specifically said we do not want the food to come until we finish the drinks, the food came too soon. I said it again and the next couple of courses slowed down.\nThe cocktails we started with were good and interesting. I had . . . and we also had a drink with a cinnamon rim which was unusual but good.  We also had a glass of wine and a second cocktail, with tequila.  We ordered the fried, salted little peppers to start. These were tasty (but nothing compared to the similar dish at A16).  Two pieces of bread and butter were brough then. The bread was flavorful and good.  Our next course was fresh tomato salad with pecorino, I believe. This we give mixed reviews. Some of the tomatoes were good while others seemed a bit old, mushy and cold (as if they'd been in the fridge). It was quite a disappointment everytime we'd bite into one of those. Then we had gnocchi with fresh oregano and tomato. It was exceptionally tasty but a strong bite from the fresh oregano, something some people might not like.  We ate this very slowly, hoping to slow down the next course. The wait staff came by the table lots (it's almost as if they have too many wait people). They were constantly trying to clear things and it was disruptive.  Keep away from the table for a while already!\nAfter the gnocchi, we had smoked goat, that they smoke on the premises, and their hamburger on an egg bun with french fries.  The goat was very tasty but for some it might be too gamy. The hamburger was cooked medium rare as we requested, but parts of the outside were so seared they were inedible (and hard as rocks).  The french fries were good.  \nIn the middle of our meal, the host asked us if we could please move to a table at the end of the banquette so they could seat a larger party using our table and one next to it.  He explained he'd comp one of our drinks. We said fine, and moved down.\nWe passed on the desserts and finished up our drinks.  When we got the bill, it was inaccurate but the waiter realized it and brought us the accurate one before we even said anything. But, in addition on that second bill the drinks weren't comped. But, we didn't want the hassle of complaining about it and it wasn't like it was a huge pain to move, but it did seem indicative of the general lack of training, maybe?, of the staff?  Overall, the experience was fine and maybe we'll be back. But given it's location, in the middle of nowhere, it would probably have taken a more positive overall experience to make us go through the hassle to go again.", "author": "Vivek V."}

One of my dining companions was convinced that Serpentine would make a great brunch place so he asked every single person if the restaurant is open for weekend brunch (multiple times).  \n\nFortunately, the staff at Serpentine was very friendly and they all entertained his inquiries.  \"Sorry, no, but we hope to soon.\"  \"Um, no, we don't have eggs florentine for you tonight.\"\n\nAll that aside, our meal at Serpentine was delish and educational!  I learned what a sunchoke was since they were shaved onto my escarole salad and I lapped up my egg noodle with beef brisket dish.  One of my dining companions had a tasty roasted squash salad and a very yummy lamb t-bone.  The other dining companion feasted on a warm potato and shrimp salad and ate all around the little tiny bones of his stuffed quail (or pajarito, as the bus boy called it).\n\nBut the star of the meal - the superstar diva, if you will - was the SAVORY BREAD PUDDING (with nettles, roasted onions and swiss cheese).

It was hard to pick something because everything sounded good.  I ended up going with the Spring Pea Risotto.

At 8pm on a Friday night the place was full and the wait for a table long; the place had a nice buzz about it. My wife and I managed to score a couple of stools at the bar and ate there, which we actually prefer to do. I quite liked the space though its a bit smaller than I thought it would be. The decor is industrial and minimalist with lots of concrete and pillars, soaring ceilings and low lighting.\n\nIt took us quite a while to be served at the bar which was a bit annoying as we had to sit there like statues trying to catch someone's eye. All it takes is a nod of acknowledgement to let us know we've been seen and you'll get to us when you can; but alas nary a nod nor a  smile were to be had for quite a while. \n\nEventually we were able to get our orders in - we shared the carrot puree soup to start while I had the stuffed quail and my wife the flat iron steak for mains (they had run out of the beef short ribs which is what she originally ordered). The soup was quite nice - hearty and wholesome. The highlight of the night was the quail - juicy sweet and tender, contrasted by bits of smoky bacon which were part of the stuffing. It also came with a beautifully soft butternut squash mash with grilled broccoli. The flat iron steak however was chewy and didn't have any taste. I forget what came with it as the dish was not worth remembering.\n\nThe service did improve once we got over the initial impasse and in general we had a good time. The food overall was good and I would go back again as I hope the poor quality of the steak was simply because it was a rushed substitute for the sold out beef ribs. I had heard the food can be a bit hit or miss, and that seemed to be the case. Thankfully its not something that cannot be fixed.", "author": "Nam D."}

We opted for soup and a tasting menu of their appetizers. The carrot soup was sublime. Then we had the heirloom chickory salad, yum, and the warm shrimp and potato salad. It was not at all what I expected, had a sort of mole type sauce, but I really liked it.

I was deterred by that comment and ended up ordering the hanger steak; about 3/4 of my party ordered the burger. The burger was a big, hearty size and was served with shoestring french fries, which were really good. My steak was good as well. However, I ordered it medium and it felt as though the meat went from medium-rare to medium as I ate from one end of the steak to the other.

We were a little late because we took the scenic route to get there, but parking was no problem whatsoever.  We got a prime parking spot right across the street.  I had only just recently discovered the Dogpatch neighborhood after being introduced to Axis Cafe and am eager to try more places here.\n\nSerpentine is located in an old warehouse, I believe.  It's a very industrial looking building and the decor inside goes with that.  We were seated right away in a cute little booth when we arrived and our server was very nice.  \n\nAs for food, we shared the Chickpea Battered Calamari and the Braised Grass-Fed Lamb Meatballs.  I liked the meatballs.  They were tasty.  They came four to the dish, so I got two, while Hue L. and our non yelper friend had one each.  The calamari was good.  It wasn't as breaded as most fried calamari is and not as crunchy.  It has a softer texture, but was still very good.  For my entree, I ordered the House Made Potato Gnocchi, because I love gnocchi!  It didn't look like much on the plate, but it was super duper filling.  Hue L. ordered the Prather Ranch Hamburger which came with fries.  He was getting really full, but still managed to stuff the whole burger in his mouth.  His only complaint was that it was a bit salty.  That might've been because he requested blue cheese.  He thought they were just going to put blue cheese crumbles on it, but they put a whole slab of cheese on it.  Our non-yelper friend ordered the Braised Eden Farms Berkshire Pork Osso Bucco, which was totally huge and she managed to finish the whole thing.  She said it was very good.  Even after being totally stuffed, we decided to all split one dessert.  I believe we decided on the Salted Caramel Pot de Creme with Earl Grey Shortbread Cookies.  The Pot de Creme was good, but I was not a fan of the shortbread cookies.  The Earl Grey taste was overwhelming.  Probably because I'm not an Earl Grey fan.\n\nOverall, a very good experience.

I honestly wouldn't have noticed this restaurant because it is in a block that has alot of warehouses.  Parking is always challenging during the day, so if possible take Muni it stops right across the street (T Line...next stop after UCSF Mission Bay going away from AT&T park).  Serpintine has trendy decor and soft colors that are pleasing to the eye. It's cozy, so come early and be prepared to move your table in and out a few times to let patrons around you \"squeeze\" into their table. I had the roasted corn soup (which was absolutely scrumptious) and one of the burgers (nice as well).   Based on the food, I would definitely recommend checking this restaurant out. They have a nice lunch menu, and I'm not sure what their dinner service is like, but would go back to give it a try. Great for a pair, and up to 3-4 people at a time.

I was searching for a place that was casual, interesting, and had a wide range of menu items. I usually search SOMA and Mission area for restaurants that appeal to my taste, so it wasn't an easy find. I hope Serpentine gets the crowds it deserves... or maybe the \"hidden gem\" factor is just in my mind. \n\nAnyways, about the food! The food was delicious with that Mediterranean style that makes you feel satisfied, healthy, and good about yourself when you leave. I loved all the seasonal aspects about the menu, and the variety of small plates made it perfect for sharing amongst our table of 3. I love being able to share plates without ordering too much, or too little. The dishes are perfect for sharing between 2-4 people, which allows you to experience the menu fully. \n\nThe chickpea battered calamari was so delicious and extremely light, especially with the mint added to the tomato sauce. But the best was the gnocchi with peas, mushrooms and light breadcrumbs on top.The cocktail list was very fun, and was hard to choose.  I wish the had a more interesting variety of ice cream to match the desserts. \nAll in all, I had an enjoyable meal, and the booths feel very private and comfortable for the small (even though very tall) space. The staff was friendly and our waiter was very accommodating, as well as quick and efficient. I'm always bothered when the waiter/waitress will linger around and have a fake enthusiasm (not that it's bad to be enthusiastic or eager, but putting on a show for guests is different).  \nI encourage those far from the Dogpatch to definitely make the trek over... parking isn't difficult.....aaaasss long as there isn't a Giants game going on!", "author": "Alexandra a."}

I've been several times and really like the food, decor, location. But it seems the service just gets worse and worse with each visit. And I think it has reached the point where it overshadows any decent dish they set down in front of me. This time, we arrived on time for our reservation for 4 people. The hostess pointed to our empty table and said she would need to just set it up. That took 10 mintues. Then she sat us without giving us menus. We waited another 10 mintues for someome to come by to offer us water and to realize we had not yet received menus. Two of us had to get up and walk to the bar to request our one and only refill on our iced tea since no one came by to check on us after we had already sat there for a long time with empty glasses. Then we had to sit there for another eternity waiting for our check. After waiting for another unacceptable period of time for someone to come run the credit card, we just got up to give it to someone. Very disappointing. AND embarrassing, might I add. I was bringing friends here to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday and felt like a schmuck for suggesting the place. Listen, I will return to Serpentine.

Located on Third St. in a spot where you'd never in a million years figure it for a restaurant, Serpentine reveals itself as both casual and intimate, with a simple menu prepared very well.  Two things stand out in my mind from my last visit:  First, I had a few fantastic glasses of wine, and second, my wife had a bread pudding that made her very happy.  Second, my wife and I--who almost never fight--got into a heated argument over campaign finance reform!  Seriously, who the hell would fight over that?  (Not that I was wrong.)  This has to have been one of the most pointless arguments of all time, but obviously, we're made for one and other, and I'm looking forward to another visit to Serpentine, so long as my wife doesn't bring up health care reform or the auto industry.", "author": "Ty D."}

We didn't have a res, but found two seats at the bar easily, where they serve a full dinner menu.  \n\nThe place definitely has a warehouse feel but the light, warmth, and chatter makes it feel cozy juxtaposed to 3rd St outside.  It looks like the restaurant was also going for cozy by nestling a table between the two bathroom entrances, but I don't think this juxtaposition of consumption and excretion works as well.  \n\nAs mentioned by previous reviewers, the space gets kind of loud, which lends a misleading air of privacy.  The only person not chatting away throughout the night however, was the bartender, who barely said a word to us the whole night in a really awkward kind of way.   I occasionally got the feeling he was eavesdropping, while not refilling my water glass.  WEIRD.  Maybe he didn't want to explain why we waited 45 minutes between our appetizer and entrees.\n\nThe food was good.  Not as good as Slow Club, but better priced.  I thought the menu was confusing, since it was difficult to tell what was an entree and what was an appetizer.  I had the burger, which is fantastic considering it is $13 (with cheese).  My friend had the flank steak with red wine reduction, which appeared to come with tater tots and asparagus.  I thought the proportions looked a bit off: lots and lots of meat, to three tots, and 4 pieces of asparagus, but a guy might feel differently.  We shared the asparagus soup, which we agreed was a good deal better than any other green soup we had tasted.  I tried to remember which way was the proper way to tip the bowl when scraping the bottom.\n\nBottomline: Eh, I'd rather go to Slow Club.", "author": "Brooke G."}

Immediate reaction was echo, echo, echo, echo, echo. The restaurant was full, which in turn means it was loud. High ceilings and cement walls do not provide the best acoustics, in my humble opinion. The host asked us to wait by the bar for ~20 min. We got some drinks - I enjoyed a Blanche de Bruxelles and Christian S. fell in love with Le Fin Du Monde (I heart French). During our wait, which was longer than 20 minutes, one of the waiters had the nerve to ask us to lower our voices. I really didn't appreciate this when it was impossible to hear anyone over the echoes of the other parties. Throughout our meal, that waiter continued to give us nasty stares from across the room even though we were tucked away in the corner, by the bar, away from the rest of the restaurant. Chill, dude. Onto the food - food was excellent. I love Slow Club and this was on par. I had the savory bread pudding, which was tasty and perfect if you don't want a big meal. Christian S. had the black bass, which was done very well. Meg C. had the last cod cakes of the night, which rocked. Others at the table had the burger and they seemed satisfied.

And it was worth every moment of belly-aching agony that I suffered at 3 o'clock this morning.  So much so that I, with full awareness of what I was doing and what the repercussions would be, ate the leftover savory bread pudding for brekkers this morning. Yup, I speak the truth.\nEverything about Serpentine was enjoyable, right down to the hip music being played (where else can you have a candle-lit dinner and be serenaded by the likes of Common?). The menu is somewhat limited, especially if you are a veg. But everything we ate was taaaasty. We started with the fried oysters (typically I prefer them raw, but what the hell?) and the South Carolina hush puppies, which we dipped into aioli (I think I actually felt my heart struggling to continue pumping). Next was the Warm Ruby Crescent Potato & White Shrimp Salad with lemon vinaigrette, mmmmmmm. I had the savory bread pudding (nettles, roated onion and swiss cheese) which was so rich and indulgent that I barely managed to eat half of it (until this morning, of course). I feel a little conflicted: I would like to recommend you order it to share, as it's a little too rich for just one person, but once you taste it you won't want to let anyone else get his grubby hands on it! You'll turn into a selfish only child who has never learned to share! ANYHOW, the wine selection was pretty good and the service fantastic. I dig it.", "author": "Lisa F."}

I'll give them a break since they just opened. The appetizers were much more interesting than the main courses. Not to miss- the crispy oysters and green beans. If you going to eat any fried, eat these! Lamb riblets and spinach salad were really good. Skip the buffalo for the main course- taste like chicken.. I mean beef. We were too stuffed to try the dessert because the bread pudding, while super good,  was rather dense and put us over.", "author": "Lily C."}

Wonderful addition to the neighborhood. \n\ni've only given three stars for the following reasons... i agree with Gabe H about the blinding lunch hour light. but i work in the same building and can tell you that it doesn't occur all year... still it's a little uncomfortable. a bit expensive as a daily lunch alternative but great for something different once in awhile or a drink after work.

Even upon walking into the restaurant, the service was great, and the space is truly fantastic. The texture on the warehouse walls and ceiling, the sweet light fixtures, the metal booth walls, the amazingly beautiful wood floor - it's just captivating. And warm and inviting, which is always hard to balance with industrial/warehouse.\n We started with the best cocktails I have had in quite some time, and my friend said his peach bellini was -the best- that he'd ever had. Here is the only lack I found in our entire meal: I wish they'd had a pastry or coffee cake to share, because I was really hungry, and there was no pre-brunch snack to be found.\nNext were our mains, I had eggs-meat-potatoes-bread and each bit was really great. My eggs had cheese just like I asked, the potatoes were soft AND crispy, my housemade sausage was delicious, and the raspberry jam for my Acme toast was great. My friend had the savory bread pudding, and though he didn't finish it, his review was equally glowing.\nWe did decide to share a little dessert (possibly because they didn't have any pastry goodness?), and had the maple creme brulee with ginger snaps. The creme brulee was creamy and thick but not gloppy, the top was crispy, and it was mellow maple-flavored. Unfortunately, my ginger snaps weren't so snappy, they were more bendy. Oh well, the flavor was good.\nAll in all, it was a fabulous experience. The food was great, very reasonably priced, and the service was helpful but not overbearing. The space was really amazing - one of the best parts of an already great meal. I will definitely be going back for dinner. And brunch again, and so on...", "author": "Colleen M."}

Unfortunately, our table was inhabited by two clueless women who felt the need to park their asses at the table for almost two and a half hours. The staff finally had to tell them to move along (awkward), which was around 8:30. They were really apologetic to us and we ended up being given two glasses of Prosecco and 10% off our bill. Wow. I was happy enough with just the Prosecco. They went above and beyond given that we weren't really that put out because it wasn't like we had later plans. Once seated, we shared the shaved salad, my better half had the chicken and I had the burger. Everything was really, really good, and we got nice wine suggestions from our server. Oh, and the affogato - good lord. Bartender was also very nice, made a nice cocktail and answered a few questions. So bravo Serpentine.

Very professional team in a well thought-out space. We enjoyed the wine we had although I find the selection of open wines quite small and as typical, high priced. Good wines though which we ended up ordering. Dinner was good too but we found one thing wrong with the meal. My girlfriend had the chicken dish and I had the hangar steak. Everything was awesome except for the steak. The sides of the steak dish were so much better than the meat that they actually drowned out the flavor of the meat. It was still really good but not perfect. All-in-all we really enjoyed the place. Had one of the two-top booths near the kitchen. Nice view of the bar area and yet somewhat separate.

Chicken - scrumptious.  Everyone thought the fries were done perfectly.  And, we all fought over the two orders of brussel sprouts - yes, brussel sprouts. \n\nTo cancel out the brussel sprouts, we all split the mint ice cream sandwich and the espresso martini for dessert.  The ice cream sandwich was really yummy and rich - perfect for splitting.  The espresso martini was good, but I probably would not order it again. It was more of a novelty than a dessert.\n\nOn top of all the good food, the service was just the right balance of attentive, yet casual.  All in all, we all enjoyed the evening.

The bar is wonderful, both for the quality of the cocktails and the friendliness of the staff.  The food is AMAZING.  The volume can be a bit high at times, but my fellow diners are almost always happy.  The staff are great.  One time when i was there, a bunch of older, bitter-looking women were at the table next to us, and one of them started grandstanding about the variety of lettuce they were being served.  The chef had to actually come out and show her a sample of the two different types of lettuce to convince her that she had been served the correct one.  All this was done with grace and politeness by the wait staff, when they should have decked this woman for being so high-maintenance.  \n\nAnd to Persimmon girl below, WTF?

The cucumber salad and the ribs were really nothing special. \nBeing the tomato lover that I am, I ordered the heirloom tomato bouilabaisse with high hopes of a tasty, acidic experience. It was too way too salty and there wasn't a single chunk of tomato in the entire dish. \nToo, it was a bit too noisy. The layout of the restaurant was a bit awkward, I thought.

I was quite excited to try this new restaurant in the Dogpatch for a few reasons...first and foremost being the tasty looking menu and the appeal of local/organic food.  I went with a group of about 13 friends for a birthday dinner.  Upon entrance, I was immediately taken in by the juxtaposition of the industrial cement ceilings and metal fixtures with the warmth of the brick walls upon which hang gorgeous large format photos of seascapes, a la Richard Misrach style.\nFor the sparseness of being out in the lonely Dogpatch this place definitely has a warmth and coziness upon entering.  Our servers (two of them) were fantastic for dealing with a group of rambunctious celebratory winos.  They treated each one of us as if we were the only person at the table, which is rare for large groups.\nWe started by ordering a round of appetizers, the best being the bread pudding (definitely the star of the evening).  The rest of the food was quite dissapointing as everything was much too salty. Every item on this menu has great potential (Fried Green Tomatoes & Summer Cardoons\nsmoked pimenton aioli - lemon , Seafood Boullibaise, Pork Rillettes with santa rosa plum preserves  with whole grain mustard and pickled shallots; Marinated Squid with coco blanc beans, padron peppers and cherry tomatoes - aioli ).  \nI am giving them three stars because due only to my disappointment of tasting salt instead of flavor, but would definitely go back in the hopes that this was an off night for the kitchen.", "author": "BLACK M."}

Went for the alaskan sockeye salmon benedict over fried green tomatoes - lemon cucumber - pickled red onion - dill - hollandaise - crispy potatoes.  Perfectly cooked and really nice piece of salmon.  Depending on what part you were eating it was either quite underseasoned (salmon) or overly salted (potatoes) so if you couldn't get all of the ingredients just right in each bite (pretty tough to do) it could be either quite bland, too intense in one direction or really balanced and yummy.  It also took nearly an hour to get the meal to the table do to some glitch and they went out of their way to make this right by additional discount off bill, but we didn't mind since allowed us to enjoy the no kids morning and get through a bit more of the NYTimes.", "author": "Bob K."}

I knew things were going to be bad when the bartender couldn't make a decent martini.  Later on 3 people from our group actually sent their drinks back which I haven't seen in a long time.  This is not a knock on the service, the waitress was great.  The food was truly mediocre though, in our group of 6, no one really liked their meal (that's a problem).  I ordered the osso bucco.  Even osso bucco at my company cafeteria has some amount of tenderness.  This osso bucco was tough and flavorless, the worst I have ever had.  That is meaningful especially when they tell you that it is the best thing on the menu.  Go somewhere else, don't waste your money here.", "author": "Rob S."}

During the last warm spell in SF four friends and I decided to try Serpentine on a Saturday evening.  They were booked but were very accommodating and pushed their two tall bar tables together for us.  It was a bit toasty from the weather, but I'm sure that's a rarity.  We started with tasty cocktails including a very strong Anise Anise and some grapefruit gin thing that negated the hot weather.  The bread pudding is awesome and I generally think fennel is overdone these days, but it was perfect in this dish.  I think I ate and entire half a roast chicken on creamy heavenly polenta or was it grits? some creamy corn deliciousness.  mmmm.  The little warm chocolate torte with candied kumquats and vanilla ice cream rekindled my lost love for heavy chocolate desserts.  Oh, and stop by Yield wine bar across the street after dinner...", "author": "Kate T."}

I have to say that the best part of my meal was the spinach salad I had. For the first time I didn't get that weird film on my palate that I so often get each time I eat spinach salad - maybe it was the shallot vinegarette? Or perhaps the poached egg on top - what ever the case it was delicious! I want to go back just for that. I learned that it's the sister restaurant to the Slow Club and the space and design does reflect that. My pregant taste buds only allowed me to have the burger but I'm glad I did - it wasn't monsterous but just the right size. As for dessert - they ran out of the apple galette but the chocolate hazelnut tarte did not disappoint especially since it's served with a big scoop of ice cream from Bi-Rite, which reminds me to get my ass there toute suite - I'm probably the only SF resident that hasn't had the damn salted caramel that you wet your panties over! Back to the tarte - big chunks of hazelnuts and dense but not dry. Delicious. Also good the fried oyster starter w/hush puppies - oysters were better than the hush puppies though. I really want to go back now for that damn salad but then again it must just be my pregnant taste buds that are driving me to go back.

The food, wine selections and cocktails are all Slow Club quality for those of you who is a big fan of Slow Club like me!!  Oh yeah, of course, same owner and chef!!  I had a mahi mahi and a glass of sauvignon blanc for lunch two days ago.  It was exquisite!!  Then I went again tonight for dinner.  We ordered rabbit stew and spinach salad for starter.  The rabbit stew was  rich in flavor and tasty.  The spinach salad was refreshing with just the right amount of dressing and sprinkle of bacon for flavor.  The main dishes we had were Alaskan halibut and steak(medium).  They both were extremely satisfying and delicious!  I ordered monice shine,  an infused martini to pair with the starters and a glass of Rioja to complement the steak.  I highly recommend Rioja and steak pair.  When I drank Rioja by itself, nothing extraordinary, but with the steak and mashed celery roots was a WOW experience.  Unfortunately we had to leave early therefore no time to try their desserts.

I'd been meaning to try this place, since sitting across the street at Yield and seeing the cool space and loving the populating of Dogpatch with another good eaterie. So I thought. \nWent there on a saturday night with another couple. On the plus side, the hostess was very nice and sat us down a bit earlier than our reservations. Our waitress was also very attentive. Kudos also for Acme bread, although we had to ask for a bread set-up. \nOne of us ordered the soup, some type of cream of vegetable. Basically tasted like a stick of melted butter with lots of salt added to it. Two of us ordered the cod, the other two ordered the beef ribs. The cod was, well, bad.  It did manage to taste both dry and oily, too salty and bland. While that may represent some kind of culinary prowess in a twisted way, to a paying customer it simply tasted-well-bad. The fish sat in a puddle of green mush meant to be blackened eggplant (???) scattered with a few forlorn canned chickpeas. \nWish I could say the ribs were better. Nope. Stringy, and slightly gamey. \nDessert followed suit. My friends ordered the scoop of Bi-Rite Mint Chip ice cream, which nobody could mess with. They were right.  I ordered the chocolate pudding, which was not pudding, but instead a dry piece of chocolate sponge cake topped with some gummy chocolate concoction. \nMaybe this was an off-night. But in San Francisco, you are going to have to do better than that to lure me back. For this price I can go to Zuni Cafe or Delfina and KNOW I am getting a great meal every time. \nSorry Serpentine.", "author": "Rebecca P."}

I don't know why I don't go to the Dogpatch more, the neighborhood seems really cool! Anyway, Serpentine is located there in a gorgeous space, it's pretty industrial but they've really done a great job with it. We were seated right away and my husband ordered the eggs with housemade bacon, crispy potatoes and toast. I ordered the red flannel hash which was brisket, chiogga beets, potatos, arugula and two poached eggs with a horseradish creme fraiche served with rye toast. Mine was pretty good although I thought the arugula threw the dish off balance because there was so much of it and it can be so peppery. Also the chiogga beets were a bit out of sync as well with the beef and potatoes, they were a bit too sweet. I might have preferred regular roasted beets instead. The eggs were poached and one was over poached and not pretty while the other one was poached well but they were kind of cold on top so they didn't really wilt the arugula much when I cut into them which I think was a detriment to the dish. I did love the horseradish creme fraiche though, it was wonderful and added the perfect kick to the brisket. I tried my husbands dish and it was excellent. I think they really excel at doing the basics well, just like Slow Club's excellent burger but I think they falter more when doing stuff outside the basics like my hash. Pete's eggs were perfectly scrambled and his potatoes were outrageously delicious, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I would definitely recommend this place for brunch.", "author": "Cathy T."}

To get food of this quality for around $10 an entree is totally a treat in a city where I sometimes find myself paying $8 for a burrito.

But now I have Serpentine (and Piccino's of course).  I probably hold the record for number of savory bread puddings eaten there by someone not on the staff.  I can't get enough of it.  My only tiny whine is last night they served it in a ramakin, which meant it wasn't as crispy, and I just love the crispy edges.  It tastes the same, still rich and cheesy and bready, so don't let that deter you.  And order a rum punch to go with it.  It's fruity, it's refreshing, and it - well- packs a punch. (I know, I know, keep my day job ;).  And if the risotto cake is on the menu (it's got a funny name and makes no mention of either risotto or cake), get that too.

Others at the table had the pork and turkey sandwiches, and agreed that the meat was fine but the relish and jam condiments were particularly tasty. We didn't have dessert, which I regretted when we passed by their giant cookies on the way out. Giant! Cookies! I'm fine now, thanks for asking. The service was good and the decor is that stripped-down industrial look of which my lazy secret self approves.

The chicken fried steak is the thing to get ... if you like that type of stuff for breakfast - nothing like fabulously seasoned chicken fried steak and biscuits topped with a mushroom gravy and eggs. Yum! The potatoes are more similar to french fries, nothing to ride home about, but nothing to cause you to pull your skin that you paid money for it. We also got the buckwheat pancakes, very dense, but loved the texture - BE WARNED - these suckers are HUGE....and by huge I mean monstrous - 4 huge buckwheat pancakes - these aren't the light & fluffy pancakes, we're talking.....dense buckwheat pancakes.
