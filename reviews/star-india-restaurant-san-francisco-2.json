The manager was really vague about who was running the place now and didn't want to give up the names of the owners (shady). \n\nI'm really grossed out by the fact that they spray Windex in the dining area where people are eating (instead of just using a rag soaked in antiseptic solution). The manager confirmed that the spray they use is indeed Windex and didn't seem to think chemicals wafting into diners' food was a big deal. He also mentioned off hand that the Health Department was in there \"all the time\" - as if this was supposed to justify their use of the spray. Out of curiosity, I looked up their score online (he DID mention the Health Department was there \"all the time\") and was disgusted to find that they had a few instances of \"high risk vermin infestation\" (https://101g-xnet.sfdph.org:8443/ords/eeopn/f?p=132:2:::NO::P2_LOCATIONID:19076). It seems to have improved in recent months - but still. The bathroom is dirty, the buffet food usually tastes two days old, and apparently spraying chemicals near food while people are eating is okay with them. This no longer seems like a restaurant with a commitment to food safety practices. I think it's time to take my business elsewhere.", "author": "L D."}

They are really on top of their business, always answer the phone, and deliver on time. The food is very reasonably priced (example: a hearty portion of all white meat chicken tandoori will only run you about $12.95 and it comes with some peppers and onions as well). Their Aloo Gobi is delicious, as is their naan. They don't deliver all over SF, so you have to venture away from downtown or closer to their shop, but it's worth seeking out. Would happily cater company meals from them if they ever opened that option. The food is great quality and they are very pleasant to interact with on a frequent basis. Try out their Indian pizzas, they have a variety for all dietary restrictions from carnivores to vegetarians and even vegans. Delicious twist on Indian flavor, definitely check those pies out.", "author": "Alison A."}

I asked for Mild spicy and my dinner was the opposite of spicy. There did not seem to even be any flavor to the Lamb Tikka Masala as all you tasted was your taste buds on fire. I have had spicy Lamb Tikka before and I could still taste the flavors through the spicyness. The rice did not have much flavor either and tasted kind of plain. I also usually experience that the lamb falls apart when you go to eat it which is awesome because of the way it was cooked yet the lamb from here did not fall apart and was just a kind of block you had to chew through. We also ordered garlic naan and I want to believe that they just messed up the order and sent us regular naan because nothing about that naan tasted garlicky.", "author": "Yochabel U."}

I am not a super huge fan of Indian cuisine, but this place is not bad, especially for the price you're paying.

Believe me or not, it worst the worst food I had. The meat had a terrible rotten smell, and so the veggies. I am an Indian and a cook myself and I can tell how rotten the peppers are, that were used. The prawns needed at least 20 minutes of more cooking as I could smell the raw garlic C paste that were still raw on it. The lamb tasted ( since it was so overcooked and bad) like plastic and the sheesh kebab I keep rubber. \nIt was terrible. I spent $25 over this shitty foo DC and I want it back.

I work in a warehouse where the temp climbs to 110 degrees or more. And when they need help on the floor I am there!  So after an exhausting work day of manual labor (I'm usually in front of a computer) I was absolutely refusing to cook for dinner.\n\nFound Star India on Eat 24 for delivery. Of all the Indian restaurants that deliver to my house, this is the only one that offered a sweet two-person meal deal. We got the cheaper option, vegetarian, and it came with large portions of Chana masala, saag paneer, a HUGE bag of veggie pakora, and a cup of raita, naan, and two types of chutney.  I also asked to upgrade to garlic naan and offered to pay the difference but they did it on the house (I think lol, haven't checked my bank statement yet). I also ordered an amazing chile and cheese naan which is super spicy and savory. SO GOOD.  It was a great deal that, with tip and free delivery, came to around $27.\n\nMy boyfriend and I only managed to eat half the food and this is my third day eating leftovers.  Cant complain, Indian food is my fav.  Is it the best Indian I've ever had?  No.  But is it pretty damn good and satisfying after an exhausting day?  Absolutely!  Driver came on time, food was hot, and I went to bed full and happy.  Next time I'll definitely tip more.. it was so much better than I expected.  Keep it cool, Star India!", "author": "Kimiko Q."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-19", "description": "I absolutely love this place. I work very close and go here at least once a week, often more. The buffet is a great deal. Sure it's not as cheap as Taco Bell but the food is outstanding. I literally just got back from eating there and I seriously want to go back for more. \n\nThe buffet includes yummy dal soup, pakoras and papadams to start, freshly made naan, rice, and plenty of delicious main dishes to choose from. It even includes chai tea, although I have never tried that. Oh, and salad, just in case you come to an Indian buffet for salad (weird-o).\n\nI'm mostly a vegetarian, so I always eat the veggie options and despite the fact that I come in so frequently, I never tire of the food. They always have saag paneer and veggie (sometimes with paneer) korma. They have different veggie dishes, usually one with potatoes and one or more without. They rotate out bean dishes, too: sometimes chana masala, sometimes rajma, sometimes dal; I've even had black-eyed peas, and as a transplanted Southerner I can tell you I appreciated that. Although my mom wouldn't recognize the ones I ate here. :-) \n\nAlso, the people here are amazing. I LOVE them. They are all, without exception, nice and warm and wonderful. They work so hard, even though almost everyone there is usually taking advantage of the delicious buffet. They refill my water faithfully and bring naan quickly (remember, it's prepared fresh for each customer so it doesn't come right away, but it's way better than having to rely on dried out naan from under a heat lamp). They greet everyone who comes in and strive to provide good service and food to each of their customers. \n\nI will be honest, sometimes a main dish might not be as good as it usually is. Sometimes the soup isn't as spicy as I like it. Sometimes they run out of something. But seriously. It's a buffet, you guys. These things happen. Overall the food is always satisfying and the dining experience is always positive and every single time I leave I'm glad I went to eat there.\n\nYou must try it!

Usually, I rate Indian buffets based on 1.) whether there was free chai/naan, 2.) price, and 3.) variety. This place delivers on all three, but the food is just really...meh. I really wanted to like this place since it's the only Indian buffet close to my apartment, but goddamn, it just wasn't good!\n\nRating Breakdown:\n1/2 Stars for Taste --\nThe one star is for the stellar goat curry and the desserts (aloo ghulab and kheer). The curry was laden with juicy chunks of goat and the desserts were not sickly sweet. The tandoori chicken wasn't that bad either. However, avoid the daal, it tastes like lentil water.  The chicken tikka masala tasted like...peaches? The naan (both plain and garlic) was a little dry. Once my friend remarked that they tasted like KFC biscuits, I just couldn't un-taste it. The resemblance is uncanny. But c'mon, an Indian buffet that can't get its naan and tikka masala right? Those are the main staples! UNACCEPTABLE. And the chai was not good. SACRILEGE.\n\n1/1 Stars for Value --\nIf your tastebuds don't mind mediocre Indian, $10.99 buffet for lunch and dinner is a steal. There's a large selection of vegetarian and meat curries and kudos for having good desserts! \n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nThe waiters were super friendly and quick to take away our dirty plates. It kind of breaks my heart to have to give this place a mediocre review because these servers were just so awesome, but blame the chef!!\n\nNo bonus star because I will definitely be giving this place a hard pass in the future and satisfy my Indian cravings in the South Bay.", "author": "Abby W."}

The chicken tikka masala, which is my favorite thing always at Indian restaurants, was not flavorful at all, just bland and blah.  I actually think Trader Joe's chicken tikka masala from the frozen aisle is better (TJ's version is actually REALLY good, guys!).

The food arrives and the bag does not include the rice. I call them and they apologize and say they will send the rice. Now to wait again. Rice arrives 15min later. We serve the food and begin to eat. As we are chewing the Chicken Tikka Masala the texture feels rubbery. We examine our chicken and we realize there are pieces of UNDERCOOKED chicken. We check other pieces and same thing. What happens when you eat UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN? Let's hope my two kids, mother in law, and I don't physically find out. I call them to inform them of this and they tried to give me the excuse that it's because of how they cook the chicken. Please, I've eaten here several times and CHICKEN SHOULD NEVER BE UNDERCOOKED. I ask for a refund this time and he says he can't give me one. He can only send me more food at no charge. No thanks. I don't want to risk getting more undercooked food.

This past Friday, I was craving Indian food and decided to give Star India another shot. Since I was by myself, I knew I would only want a curry, naan, samosa and maybe a side of rice. This was one of the only places that has a $20 minimum versus a $25+ min. I ordered via Eat24 since I had a $2 off weekend promo code.\n\nSamosa vegetable ($3.50)\nThe shell was nicely fried, flaky with a little chew. I enjoyed this with the mint dipping sauce.\n\nGarlic naan: garlic leavened bread ($2.25)\nFor me, this could have used a little more garlic, but the naan had a nice chew.\n\nChicken tikka masala: chicken tandoori with herbs and tomato sauce ($10.95)\nGood flavor. The sauce actually got better the next day since it tasted spicier. The chicken was good. I wish the pieces were smaller since it was a little hard to eat with the huge chunks of chicken. The first day, the chicken was good. Slightly dry, but nothing the curry couldn't mask. The next day with reheating, the chicken was so dry! Really hard to eat. No amount of sauce could cover up the dryness. \n\nPilau rice: basmati rice with peas, tomatoes and spices ($3.50)\nThis has raisins and nuts. I wish they put that in the description since I literally when through the whole container and picked out all the raisins and nuts. The rice itself was good and had a nice flavor.\n\nNot sure if I'll order from them again as everything was just okay. But I do like that they have a $20 min.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-24", "description": "As I've eaten at this restaurant for over 25 years on and off, more so after the Star India on Polk street caught fire and went out of business years ago, I am usually curious what my dining experience will be because it hasn't been too consistent over the years. Since I've only eaten the buffet food, depending on the time of day, its quality varies every time. Yesterday I invited a friend who had never eaten there before, although she's lived in San Francisco for over 35 years. As she likes spicy food, I thought it odd she'd never tried Star India.\nFirst, it was in the middle of the afternoon and the place was not busy and I was trepidatious about its buffet being not so fresh. Fortunately for me and my friend, the buffet table was full of various and fresh selections. One dish looked like it was made from beef which baffled me. I was told it was ground lamb. As a vegetarian, I passed it up. The rest of the dishes were tasty and spicy enough for my friend as she tried them all, but I felt the heat was too mild, even with the chutney sides. Most appealing was the daal, spicy, piping hot and tasty. The green salad was refreshing and the tomatoes were actually ripe and red without being mealy. The papadan was dry and tasteless but the freshly cooked naan brought to our table was a nice touch. Samosas would've been nice, sure, but the khir and fried doughy balls - sorry, I'm not sure how they are called - in sugary water made up for the lack of samosas. My friend especially liked both desserts and the chai, even though the chai seemed a bit anemic to me. The selection of Indian beer and mango lassi were available, but we opted for free chai instead. The bill came to under $25 with tip. Because it started to get busy about 4:30, we were pleasantly sated and left before the early dinner crowd descended.\nThe staff wasn't obtrusive or gratuitously eager with the water refills, and to me that made the dining experience much more pleasurable. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because it's not wheel chair accessible and my friend has mobility issues. To walk up and down three stairs to the buffet table and or bathroom was an impediment for her. The decor was as authentic as I would imagine, and the shrine to the God ganesh was a nice touch. I would recommend this place for a first time introduction to Indian buffet food. As it's not a large restaurant, and I've been there when it's been crowded, busy and not stellar during peak times, I suggest going after the regular lunch or dinner times.\n\nPs.\nSadly, I read on yelp just now that the health department gave it a poor, clean health inspection, under 5%. Eat at your own risk.", "author": "Gemma S."}

That made me laugh as I wouldn't have expected such the colorful soundtrack inside an Indian restaurant.  Throughout the evening, there was an interesting mix of music.  That stuck in my mind the most about our dining experience. \n\nStar India seems to be a popular take-out/delivery type of eatery.  There weren't that many patrons that evening.  However, we constantly the delivery guy carry huge bags of take out packages out of the kitchen.  It took about 20 minutes for us to get our food bc there were so many takeout orders. \n\nAlthough there was an AYCE dinner buffet for $10.99 pp, we opted for ordering a la carte.  I passed by the buffet bar on the way to the restroom and didn't think the buffet looked that impressive.  However, I thought that the dishes we ordered were just OK.  \n-Plain naan: Slightly greasy and smaller in portion size than naan from other places.\n-Fish Tandoori: Huge cubes of salmon came out on a sizzling platter with green bell peppers and onions.  It was great with a squeeze of lemon.  Only downside was that the salmon was overcooked and a bit dry. \n-Chicken Vindaloo (chicken breast meat):  A huge portion of chicken and potatoes ordered to our preference of mild spiciness.  Only problem was that the chicken was dry.  Without the curry, it would have been much less edible. \n-Saffron Rice: Great mix of saffron rice with cashews and raisins.  \n  \nOverall, portions and value are great.  Our total tab was $35.  Cooking execution needs some work.  Service is tentative.  Ambiance is casual and laid back.  I might or might not go again to give them another chance.

Since my last review, I've stopped being vegetarian and have tried new dishes. Their Sag Paneer is my roommate's new favorite guilty pleasure, and my new go-to entree is the Prawn Korma. The Chicken Korma is awesome, too, and the initial reason I got turned on to the Prawn Korma.\n\nIt's seriously the best comfort food in the Inner Richmond. \n\nThe staff are continually sweet, too! The other day I ordered online, and online the wait was listed as 40-60 minutes. I was hungry and grumbled a bit but knew it was worth it.

Why? Because their minimum is only $12, and the food is usually all for me after work when I don't feel like cooking (which is more often than not). Also, if you order through beyondmenu.com, you can get free veggie samosas which are sometimes a little too salty for me, but mostly A-OK.\n\n2) I always order garlic naan, although halfway through I wonder why because it just vaguely tastes like garlic and yet has this crazy yellow coloring on it that sometimes stains my fingers. Also it isn't that soft, but that's probably because it's being delivered. I've never been one to enjoy the tamarind and mint sauce that comes with naan, so I'll skip over that part.\n\n3) I've had Chili Chicken, Chicken Madrasi, and Chicken Vindaloo so far. They're all quite tolerable, but I think the problem is that the chicken is a little too dry. And because I'm a sucker for tender meat, this is somewhat disappointing. I have to say my least favorite dish was the Chicken Vindaloo because the sauce was very pasty.\n\n4) When you ask for spicy, you SERIOUSLY get spicy. I have a VERY high spice tolerance, to the point where waiters warn me when I order my food, so there's my credibility. On all three occasions, I've specified my food to be spicy, and on all three occasions, when I'm halfway through my meal, I find myself not being able to think straight temporarily because the food is so spicy. So you've been warned. I'm still recovering.\n\nSo all in all, A-OK, and convenient for delivery, but nothing that blows me out of the water.", "author": "Jenn L."}

The order was almost 30 minutes late\n3. They didn't bring me chutney I had ordered.\n\nWhen I called to ask about my chutney the woman on the phone asked me if I wanted to be refunded or have the chutney brought to me. I told her I wanted my chutney brought to me because the spicy vegetable jalfrezi i ordered was a soggy bland mess. She said she was going to send the driver back after he finished his current delivery. She calls me back 20 minutes later to tell me that the driver had many orders so it was going to take a while to get my chutney to me. I told her that was fine then I'd rather just be refunded for the chutney. This is what seems to have upset her.\n\nAt first she was frustrated that I just didn't want to wait for the chutney. She then claimed that they hadn't actually charged me for it which is interesting that this suddenly became an issue once i told her I didn't want to wait for the chutney. I told her I could see that I had been charged for this chutney because we ordered through grubhub. She then threw in my face \"Are you going to make a big deal about this for $1?\" Very rude considering I had been patient with her through this process. At this point I was just irritated said \"Well yeah isn't it your job to properly send me my food?\" She said fine and that she was going to have the driver come back to me with $2 for the hassle.\n\nAn hour later the driver arrives to our apartment to \"refund\" us. He only gives us $1 but at this point I just was over the entire situation and just accepted it. He then tried to argue with my boyfriend that it was just $1. \n\nThis was a lot of headache to eat bland food. There are too many faster and better tasting places with less rudeness and better customer service skills. Will not order from here again.", "author": "Vanessa T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-05-08", "description": "I know as someone with a very low spice tolerance, ordering Indian food is always a gamble so I try to be fair in reviewing it. I'll break it down by menu item that I purchased.\n\nMy order:\nOnion Bhaji\nChicken Korma\nKabuli Naan\n\nI was super excited to find a place that carries onion bhaji, because it seems to be something of a rarity when I get Indian food. I was disappointed though that instead of the crispy, flavorful onion bhaji I love, I got soft, squishy onion rings. It was very disappointing!\n\nI almost always order korma, because it's usually the safest pick for someone who doesn't like spicy food. This is easily the spiciest korma I have ever had (and I have eaten A LOT of korma in my day!), and all of the subtle flavors I love in korma were totally lacking. Again, very disappointing!\n\nThe Kabuli Naan was good (something not spicy, yay!), but as the only thing I was able to comfortably eat out of the whole order, it's nothing to write home about. \n\nHowever, what I will say in favor of this place is that the portions are good, they don't skimp at least. Downside for me is that I have a good chunk of food in front of me that I can't eat, because it is too spicy or too mushy. I will try and save the korma and adjust the flavor myself as a leftover maybe, but I think the onion bhaji is beyond saving.\n\nI appreciate that the delivery was prompt though, especially since my place is hard to find. \n\nMaybe if you like your food really spicy you will have a better experience than me, but overall I think the spiciness just covers up the fact that the food is otherwise fairly bland in terms of flavor and complexity.\n\nUnfortunately, I won't be eating here/ordering from here again.", "author": "Kirsten E."}

Yes, its a pretty good deal if you are looking for a cheap meal to pig out on. I was introduced to Star India by my friend, Ken C. (his review is below on 2/8/11) who obviously loves this place. While I never thought of it as 5-star quality, I do think there are some worthy dishes served at Star India, along with some that taste pretty bad.\n\nAbove all, their best dish has to be the chicken tikka masala. After trying the entire selection on the buffet line, I can vouch this has to be the winner. After experimenting with some unappetizing dishes like the green-colored one in my photo (sorry I don't remember the name but its green) on the buffet line, I'll happily stick with the chicken tikka masala, rice and naan! Their dessert is also delicious, and tastes great paired with the chai tea!\n\nIf you enjoy eating Indian food, I'd suggest trying Star India at least once, just because its such a great deal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-16", "description": "I went here today with my girlfriend for dinner.  She purchased a living social deal where it was $10 for $20.  By using this deal, we were not able to purchase the buffet  at the rate of $9.99 per person.  We purchased Al a carte.  \n\nOnion naan.:  Bits of onion in the dough and what appears to be garlic and little green specs baked into the naan.  Not bad at all, and it complements the Chicken Tikka Masala very, very nicely.\n\nSaffron Rice: Rice in three different shades of red with raisins, peanuts and cashews.  I must say I was pretty impressed by this Biyani.  However, it did not have a couple more un-edible ingredients that would bring out more flavor to a dish I eat at home called \"dam-bout.\"\n\nChicken Tikka Masala:  The chicken wasn't too dry and the sauce was so good that it made you want to dip everything in it!.\n\nSpinach mesh with Yogurt Pieces: I forgot the actual name of this dish, but I have to say I enjoyed it.  The yogurt had the texture of firm/chewy tofu, and I was very pleased with this dish.\n\nMango Ice Cream:  If you check in on yelp, you get one free mango ice cream!  Unfortunately... my girlfriend and I both \"used\" our mango ice creams and we only ordered one and needed to order one.  The way it tasted was frozen Mango Lassi.  My guess is there is a mango syrup added to a yogurt/milk blend, frozen and then diced into little cubes then served to us.\n\nOverall, I am giving this place a 4 (Though I felt like giving this place a 3 for the majority of the visit due to the wait).  I am a bit upset about two things.  \n\n1) We entered the store at 7:10p.m.  We were seated immediately, but no water/menus were given to us until 7:19p.m.  I saw the waiter and waitress work on bussing the other tables.  One main piece of advice is that you do not have your customers wait for you.  Those tables are less important than us.  Had I ordered the Taj Mahal beer at 7:19p.m. I guarantee you it would've been done before any of the dishes would've touched the table.\n\n2) We ordered at roughly 7:25p.m.  At 7:44p.m. the waitress said our food would be with us shortly (my personal favorite for buying a bit of time). Received our dishes at 7:48p.m.  The wait took far too long.  There was another couple that came in at the same time as us, but instead chose the buffet option, and they were gone before we even had one dish on our table.  \n\nOnce we received the food, we were very pleased.  However, we feel that we probably would've been better off doing the buffet style without the deal from the beginning.\n\nOne note:  If you choose the buffet option, you must order naan through the waiters, you cannot pick that up.\n\nI am definitely going to give this place another try, especially for a chicken tikka masala pizza, which I think would be wonderful.  But the wait today, was a bit too much.", "author": "Morris C."}

The naan is served to order (included in the buffet) which means you get freshly baked naan with your meal...mm! They offer at least 8 different dishes, salad, parathas, kheer, gulab jamun, lentil soup, and chai. When I crave chicken tikka masala I crave the one they serve here - it's creamy, not overly tomato-ey, and spiced well. The lamb curry was rich and delectable. And even if you're not a vegetarian you have to try the vegetarian curry; it is light and slightly sweet. I really appreciate that every entree has a unique flavor.

She didn't know the difference between dal soup and a dal dish. Maybe she should ask if she doesn't have experience in ordering Indian food. Any of the staff would be delighted to help her. Plus who orders a 3 dollar dish at a sit down restaurant? This is not a cafe.\n\n I frequent this place quite a bit and feel as if everyone is always extremely polite. I even watched them try to amend the situation and offer her another dish and dal soup to go as well.\n \nI guess you cannot always please everyone, especially those who are delighted to bitch about everything in life. She even was rude on the way out and left the food that they had wrapped (and gave free dal soup with) to go. \n\nPeople like this irritate me. In fact after she left, I even asked what that \"rude bitches\" problem was. They tried so hard to accommodate, but I guess she just didn't want to helped. \n\nSo for you Judy G, I'd like to say, I really hope you don't frequent any other of my favorites restaurants with your cheap ass. I realize some people are on fixed incomes, but even if that is the case, it still gives you no right to act like such an ass.", "author": "Zoeboe D."}

Their lamb is GREAT. Very tender you can tell it is choice meat & slow cooked for a long time. Delicious rice, lassi, & saag paneer. Everything was good here but the chicken tikka was not a main attraction. Also they have massala chai included in the buffet that you can get yourself! \nMy favorite part that i discovered at the end was that they have different size plates! I love that they have big plates, small plates & tiny plates available too, i hate always having to use a giant plate, so that made me almost as happy as the masalla chai! The salad was very simple with many different non american dressings. Great mango lassi for $2.50, thats a good price. dinner buffet is $10.95. Nice atmosphere, quiet, like home.

Indeed, they were bland to the point that I was bored out of my mind eating and gave more attention to my glass of wine. I can make better Indian food despite the fact that I do not know how to cook Indian food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-10-01", "description": "We had the buffet here, so I can't speak to their a la carte items, but we chose the buffet because it had a number of vegetarian items I normally really love.  I agree with a previous reviewer that some of the food tasted really, really bland.  I was reaching for salt, pepper, anything I could find to add a little flavor-- not good.  The palak paneer was particularly disappointing.  The veggie korma was also bland- though better than the palak paneer.  There was a lentil/read-bean \"chef vegetarian special\" dish that was unidentified, but more promising than the others.  Also what seemed to be simply sauteed broccoli.  Not bad, but not good.  The chai was almost undrinkable, which is too bad, and the gulab jamun tasted really stale.  I mean, still sweat and cake-y, so, you know, I ate it, but still.  Sad monkey.  Naan served to our table was okay- but nothing to write home about.\n\nTo give credit where due: the dal soup was very tasty, but sadly too spicy for my not-spicy-loving-palate.  But if you can handle a little heat, then the dal soup is yummy.\n\nAlso, the main hostess was incredibly nice, and the waiter we had was also very nice.  The prices were not bad, but not cheap enough that you thought: \"oh well, mediocre food... it's not all that bad\"\n\nMaybe we hit a bad night?  Maybe we tempted fate by doing buffet instead of a la carte?  Whatever it was, with all the other Indian options, we'll probably try our luck somewhere else.", "author": "Tarah D."}

The spicy vegetable jalfraze was good but not very spicy at all (would forego if you're looking for spice). However, it was a solid vegetarian dish with good flavors. The onion kulcha naan was good, though it was a little doughy for naan (I'll try the garlic naan next time). Next time, I'd also like to try the tandoori chicken with yogurt marinade (yum!).\n\nWe ended the meal with delicious kheer - very mild and soothing rice pudding - and Kulfi ice cream. The ice cream was awesome - like eating cold chewy ice cream that tasted like a million diff subtle flavors. \n\nService was great - really attentive. The waiters were nice and friendly and always kept our glasses full of water.", "author": "Nami S."}

Also, it was always the same owner, and he was always there, and he always took time out to make us feel welcome.  And, it was obviously a family establishment.\n\nNow, they just have waitresses.

They are adequate, not friendly, no smiles, just doing their job.\n\nSo, now that I analyze it, I realize it is not only the awful food that disappointed me, it's also a great decrease in customer service and general ambience that makes me not think favorably about this establishment any more.\n\nSeriously, Star India owner - go to the old owner.

I didn't have an overcharge problem though because I only went for the 9.99 dinner buffet.\n\nI do like the lentil dahl soup they offer -- the thickness is just right and it is on the slightly spicy side.  I prefer it here to other places which serve a literally watered down version.\n\nThe curries offered at Star India were equally divided along vegetarian and meat choices.  It also seems they vary according to the season which makes sense.  The last nite I went, they had cabbage curry, chef's curry (peas and potato), a 2nd chef's curry (vegetarian kidney beans), spinach saag with indian cheese, vegetarian korma curry, chicken masala curry, lamb curry and lamb keema (ground lamb) curry.  There was also chicken tandoori.  If I'd gone during the summer, I'm sure the veggie curries would have been slightly different.\n\nThey don't use a lot of cream and yogurt in the curries offered in the buffet, which I do appreciate (exceptions being chicken tikka masala and any kind of korma curry which require dairy, but even those aren't too heavy).\n\nI'm not a big fan of pakora fritters in general, but at least they were in chickpea batter so I could still enjoy them (I eat GF). Another gluten-free item I loaded up on was the papadum lentil crackers with cilantro yogurt chutney - YUM!  I couldn't eat the naan b/c of my wheat allergies, but I did notice that everyone who got the buffet meal were treated to freshly baked naan to order. The basmati rice was well-prepared and not mushy like some other places.  I'm trying to keep my carbs down so being able to control the amount of rice via buffet is helpful.\n\nAll in all, a good deal for 9.99 when considering my other options for the evening.

And there are good, clean bathrooms (an absolute necessity for a restaurant with a good Indian buffet). Can't say a bad word about Star - very highly recommend this spot.", "author": "Rick P."}

It's a highly decent place, and it satisfied my craving really nicely. \n\nBasmati rice seemed a little on the oily side, but it still tasted really good. Actually, it may not have been oily at all, but it just looked... wetter than usual. I had chicken tikka masala and some other meat curry and the ground lamb. The meat dish was full of bones... It was really tasty, but just inconvenient to eat. Ground lamb was... Interesting. I honestly didn't know what to expect of it, but I was highly intrigued. I felt like I was eating an Indian version of a sloppy joe. Maybe I should've sandwiched it between the naan bread and ate it like a sloppy joe naanwich. Pretty good stuff. \n\nChicken in the tikka masala was cut in huge chunks! A little bit dry, but easily fixed if you break it down into smaller pieces and soak them in the sauce. I admit, I really enjoyed the tikka masala. Mixed in with some of the yummy raita, and yum all around. \n\nNaan was a little different from how I'm used to. It's a little more crunchy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. I'm more used to it being on the fatter, chewier side of things, but it was still good. Just... different. I can hang with that. I can deal with change.\n\nCustomer service is excellent. Felt very comfortable and welcomed. If I craved Indian and was in the area, I wouldn't feel bad about coming here, although I probably will explore some more. I won't forget this place though!\n\nOverall, the food is really, really decent and the price is really good, especially since SF tends to be more expensive when it comes to restaurant eats anyways. Obviously, if you're snobby about your Indian food, this ain't the place, but if you're looking for a cheapish, fast bite of Indian, you could do worse than this place. \n\nOh. I also liked their kheer, and I was super surprised that I like gulab jamun after all. I didn't use to like it until I came here. I'll be giving that dessert another chance now. \n\nI left really happy.", "author": "Hayne P."}

Walking in I noted that they weren't crowded and I thought \"uh-oh\" Also there was this silence in there as well. I don't know about you folks but most Indian restaurants usually have some sort of music blaring. The restaurant decor felt like it was something out of the 70's or early 80's era. \n\nAnyhow, I digress. So what you really want to know is how was the food right? It was pretty decent for a $10 all-you- can- eat buffet. They had my curry lamb, tiki marsala chicken, mango chutney and that spinach dish with the cubes of cheese. Can't really complain too much since all my favorites are there. Bonus that they had my little fried dough balls in syrup and chai tea. \n\nI highly recommend the lamb curry; it was really good. A major bummer about the lunch was that the food wasn't that hot temperature wise. Many of the dishes were luke warm. We weren't too happy about that. \n\nAlso for some odd reason I never saw the Tandoori chicken the whole time I was there. Where was the chicken? Only saw a layer of onions and a lemon wedge where the Tandoori chicken should have been. Hmmmmm..... \n\nThe naan was decent.

We had just gotten out from a movie and were a little hungry.  It was almost 10pm and he was wanting Indian food, so I googled what was still open.  \n\nWhen we walked in the door it was the start of one of the most awkward dining experiences I have had.   I know it was late, but you would think that there would be a few people out enjoying the night out and stopping in to eat.  There was pretty much one other couple there in the main part of the dining room that was definitely to themselves and whispering to each other. They disappeared like ghosts halfway through the meal,   I think there was a family up behind us but couldn't really tell.  \n\nThe staff wasn't rude or mean, but it felt like they didn't really want us there.  Sitting by myself while my date went to the restroom felt more awkward than a horrible set up with someone you cant stand. \n\nWe ordered our food from the menu and got it pretty quickly.  We knew they were closing soon so we tried to eat fast.  Even though the food was pretty good, my bf was scared to eat some of it.  He has lived in India for a decent chunk of his life and he was so freaked out by the bright red cut up chicken legs that he wouldn't even touch them.

Second, it is the best Indian food I have had in the city and the prices are fantastic!!  Third, it actually serves my favorite PIZZA in the city!!\n\nYes, I said pizza.  Indian Pizza.  They do not have it on the menu in the restaurant, but it is on the take out menu.  They will serve it to you in the restaurant, if you ask.  The chicken tandori pizza is to die for.  They also let me on a little secret that they also serve a Chicken Tikka Masala Pizza that is not on the menu.  I have yet to try it, but I can't wait too!!\n\nI have introduced this pizza and this restaurant to many friends and have yet to have anyone give it less than a 5 star rating.  You have to try Star India!!!  You will be hooked for life.", "author": "Jennifer M."}

When the bill came it was several dollars above what it should have been. When I pointed it out to the waiter he was not surprised at all.  He said that the menu I'd ordered from was old, and that the bill was correct because it was printed from \"their system,\" which had the correct prices in it.  He said they had ordered a new menu with new prices, and just didn't have the menu in the restaurant yet, but that the new prices were already in \"the system.\"  lt was my gut feeling that the new menu story was b-s.   Besides, if you're handing someone a menu and telling them to order, you should charge the price that's listed on the menu!  The manager said he would \"honor THE PRICE LISTED ON THE MENU anyway, even though it's incorrect.\"\n\nI have since been back by the restaurant and there is no \"new menu\" with new prices.

Customer service and food are seriously lacking at this place- and isn't this the whole point of going out to eat???

I ordered the Dal, the Bengan Bhartha, Chicken Vindaloo, and the Garlic Naan.  The only complaint I had was that when ordering online I was not prompted if I wanted to get rice with my dishes as well, and when they called to tell me that my food would be there in 45 minutes, again was not asked about rice.  I totally forgot about it because usually at other Indian Restaurants it either comes with it or my server will ask if I want rice.

On any other occasion the plate rubbing incident would have been enough to drive us out. \n\nNow the food, cold, tasteless and oily.

They had their dinner buffet going, but unfortunately the voucher specifically stated that it wasn't good for the buffet... though once we saw how tasty the buffet looked & smelled, we decided to go for it anyways, as it was only $10 a person and the voucher was still good for anything ordered off the menu.  So we got the buffet and then ordered some cheese naan, poori, and samosas off the menu, all of which were pretty damn good.\n\nThe buffet items were all really good as well... the tikki masala flavorful, the palak paneer amazing, the tandoori chicken nice & tender...  My only complaint is that they had some fried veggies out that looked like they'd been sitting out under the heat lamp for a while, and biting into one confirmed that that was indeed the case.  But everything else was good.\n\nI got some of the raita for dessert, which was tasty, though I have had better.  The gulab jamun was also somewhat mediocre and a bit lacking in flavor, at least compared to how I've had it at other places.\n\nAll in all though, this place rocks.  It's not the best Indian food you'll ever eat, but for $10 you're getting more than your money's worth.  Taking the food and price into account, it's a solid 4-star.  However, at the end of the meal, we hadn't yet ordered a full $20 from the menu so I asked the waiter if we could order something to-go, despite it saying \"no takeout\" on the voucher...  After running it by the manager, he was more than happy to make an exception!  This definitely earns them an extra star, because I know a lot of restaurants can be real dicks about the stipulations on their groupons & living social deals.

When it came out though, there was both garlic and plain naan.  They also have samosas on the buffet, which is a good thing.  The dishes on the line were pretty standard, as were the chutneys, although they were kind of hard to see through the oddly dark tinting of the sneeze guard.

How the hell can you not want to eat here?\n\nif i ate here every week I would be so fat. But i CRAVE their food. I know what your thinking, Indian Buffet = cheap crusty chana masala and tough cold nan. Not the case here.. First of all, they have tons of veggie options, which like any good indian place, they should, especially if they are Sihk. I was incredibly annoyed last night however when I went in to spend my $8 like a baller and had to listen to the girl next to me who was on some college double date from hell ask repeatedly to the staff \"does this have animal byproducts in it??? Does this have dairy???\". Okay retard, you're vegan.....WE GET IT ALREADY!!! Now SHUT THE FUCK UP AND EAT THE DAAL!!!!!\n\nseriously, why are some 'vegans' so damn annoying? No wonder people roll their eyes. At first I thought maybe she just was allergic to dairy, but when she spit out the 'animal byproduct' line, I knew what we were dealing with. How can you live in the city, be in your mid to late 20's and not know that the majority of indian food is Vegetarian and that cheese is a huge component in the food? And I'm saying all of this as a vegetarian who eats vegan about 40% of the time. Cause ain't nothin gonna stop me from the Veggie Korma at star of india. Korma is probably the best invention of all time. I would bathe in Korma daily if only it were possible.\n\nSo yeah, if you like tasty Indian food and don't have a ton of cash to spend. Hit up the Buffet at this location. You will not be dissapointed.

In San Mateo there are two Indian restaurants, Bombay Gardens is always packed because the food is mild on the spice.  The other one much less busy because they are too spicy.

I think I love them much in the way that clinical sexaholics crave dubious, unsafe liasons with complete strangers. I love the first step into dimly lit, dark paisly wall paper establishments as Bollywood pop music enraptures my senses. Coriander, cumin and cardamom in the air invade my veins like crack cocaine and I can't wait for the first bite.\n\nFar in the back is the all you can eat buffet at the very reasonable rate of $8.95 for Lunch AND Dinner too! The spread is not the most impressive but it has all the core staples of lamb curry, chicken tikka masala, various pakoras, paneers, tandooris and naan. Unlike many of the other Indian buffets I've been to, they also have spicy papadoms on the buffet table! I feel sorry for everyone who's ever died before having tried at least one papadom.\n\nSince I was getting to go, a very dry restaraunt manager said that I was allowed two ladles from each dish. With eight to ten different dishes, my to go box wouldn't be able to fit all that food!\n\nMy only critique is that Star India does not quite have the variety that most other buffets offer. The food although quite delicious has a little room for improvement.\n\nBecause Star India provides the buffet for both Lunch and Dinner, this is a recommended restaurant for newcomers to Indian cuisine to give them a chance to try several things at once. Veterans of curry will not find dissapointment either!", "author": "Stuart Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-21", "description": "Most Saturdays, I go for a bike ride into Marin.  My route home brings along Arguello across Geary and many is the time in my post-ride hunger when my nose hairs have prickled at the tasty scents emanating from Star India.\n\nToday, I finally got around to marrying those scents with tastes on my tongue and the experience was pretty good.\n\nThe buffet is in the back, well lit and well labeled so you know exactly what you're getting.  They had chicken tikka masalla, lamb curry, tandoori chicken, a few veggie dishes, daal soup, basic salad, plain rice, plain and herby looking naan and some kind of potato bread that reminded me of the bread you get at Ethiopian restaurants.  They also had samosas and some deep fried veggies and various sauces and dips.  For dessert, they had rice pudding and sweet doughy balls of goodness.\n\nThe samosa were pretty bland - tasty enough but hard to put your finger on exactly what it was you were getting.  Same goes for the potato bread things.  However, the curry dishes were actually pretty good.  I found the chicken tikka masalla to be mild and creamy, just like it should be, with big chunks of decent looking chicken and no bones.  The lamb curry was also very tasty - the lamb itself was quite fatty but for me that only added to the flavor.  Neither dish was particularly spicy but it certainly had enough going on to keep my mouth occupied.  In both cases, there was a high sauce to chicken ratio, but since you are serving yourself it is easy to use the spoon to cherry pick the best chunks of chicken and cut down on some of the sauce.\n\nThe tandoori chicken was a little boney - but I did get to the restaurant after the main lunch rush so perhaps I'd missed all the drumsticks and thighs.   The rice and naan were OK - rice was cooked decently, the naan a little chewy.\n\nJust when I thought I'd eaten enough, I remembered that I'd seen some sweet stuff so I headed back with a little plate to scope it out.  The rice pudding was very good indeed - very creamy tasting and quite decadent.  The sweet doughy balls were also nice and made a good compliment to the rice.  I ended up going back for a little more.\n\nThe place seemed clean, had enough customers to keep the food moving even at 2pm on a weekday and best of all, the things that were supposed to be hot were actually hot - there are few things in this world that I like less than tepid buffet food (yes, I'm talking to you, Lee's Deli - would it kill you to turn up the temp on your food heaters?) and I can happily say that at Star India the temp was definitely hot enough.\n\nFor $8.65 including tax I'll definitely be inclined to stop off next time I am riding past.", "author": "Adam S."}

Uhh...not the norm, but I went ahead and drove across town to get my lunch.  A few weeks later, my roommate placed a delivery order, which arrived on time, but then a duplicate of her order arrived 15 minutes later.  For some reason she agreed to pay for this extra food, but that kind of sloppy service rubbed me the wrong way.  Last Saturday, I decided that I'd give them one more shot.  \n\nThe food arrived on time and looked great, but there was one caveat: I felt sharp pains in my stomach immediately after eating it and then I experienced acute food poisoning, screwing up my plans for the evening.

We ordered from Star India for the first time after having many of their menus dropped at our door. Big Mistake. I took a bite of the naan and thought. \"Hmmm. this kinda tastes like cardboard. Well, maybe it's not their forte.\" Well, every item we tasted was worse than the one before. It seems completely impossible to me that EVERY dish could be so bad! We ended up dumping everything in garbage. YUK. We actually keep the Star India and India Palace menus in our kitchen drawer with \"BAD\" scrawled on the front in black marker....so we never accidentally order from either of these places again. If you want good Indian food try Indian Oven or Roti.", "author": "Pam H."}
