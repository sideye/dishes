The owners and the workers are all very nice as well! During lunch time, their portions are huge.

I usually order this with no  green onions and onions. \n\nMongolian rice: 4.5/5\nI love eating this dish, since it has a little kick of spice in it, but it's a little greasy for me as well..

No matter what you plan to order, add an order of the salted chicken wings. They say they're spicy on the menu, but I'd say they're only spicy if you eat the jalape\u00f1o chunks tossed in with them.  The skin is perfectly crisp, with no chewy/slimy/soggy parts of skin and the wings were meaty. We also had a plate of green beans w/ minced pork and a soup.  One soup order was enough for the 4 of us to each have a cup.  This place is perfect for ordering family style.

Our favorite to go places have closed over the past couple of years as the costs of running a restaurant have increased annually.  The latest being the minimum wage increase in the City.\n \nSince we were on Clay St., I saw Capital and having heard from others about this restaurant, we decided to give it a try. As you walk in, the layout is the classic Chinatown diner set-up with a counter in front with tables for four on the sides and larger round tables in the middle.\n \nChecking out the menu, they had a lunch specials along with a good selection of dishes. With dinner a couple hours away, we decided to opt for something on the lighter side, so we each ordered wonton noodle soup. We asked, but they did not have the wider egg noodle, so we stuck with the standard thin egg noodles. There were 6 won tons with a small portion of noodles in a flavorful broth.  I was expecting shrimp or shrimp/pork won tons, but these were classic all pork. Relative to the price, they were ok and nothing special. I still prefer shrimp won tons.\n \nIt appears Capital is known for its salt and pepper chicken wings. If I come back, I will opt for something other than wonton noodle soup and might give the wings a try.", "author": "Al L."}

While walking in Chinatown in SF, I figured, I am hungry and need some good comfort food. Walked right on by and saw their chicken and other menu items on their window. Dang it looked good huh?\n\nI will say, the place is small but cozy. I loved how they have this \"bar area\" where you can sit and eat, especially if you're eating alone. I walked in and was immediately greeted and sat at the bar area. I ordered their salt-n-peppa wings and looked at the lunch menu and got their lunch combo of rice and pork with beans. \n\nI will say that the wings are exactly what you want: crispity crispy skin, super hot, beautifully cooked, and nicely seasoned with salt. I will add--there is nothing special about these wings. I know, I know, I'm sorry, but what is so special? The salt they sprinkle on top? I'm sorry, but we have better places here in Washington. I will definitely say it is worth trying to try, to say you had it, but I will definitely show you better if you ever come here. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was tender and juicy, but didn't have anything special to the flavor. The frying of the wings were perfect though. They gave me hella wings though--the serving came with at least 10 wings. I could not even eat them all.\n\nThe green beans and spare ribs were good. Loved the right amounts of soy sauce and oyster sauce and I appreciated how tender the ribs were. Definitely a great lunch option! Both dishes were less than $20. Pretty good deal for the food portions. Food came out fast and everyone was so friendly here. You can tell people love coming here though. During lunch hour it was filling up with locals. I would definitely come here again if I needed to and when I'm here again. Free soup in the meal (i'd pass on this, nothing notable to say). Cash only!", "author": "Tan Lo S."}

So, we adults ordered our own and the kids ordered there own.\n\nFor starters-\n\nFamous fried chicken - crispy, juicy and flavorful \n2 egg roll -  4 very small pieces cut in half, crispy on the outside but very Mushy inside and no flavor and little bit of filling   \n\nMain entree\n\nAdult table-\n\nChicken fried rice - worst fired rice ever, it didn't even look like or tasted like \nchicken fried rice.\n\nClam with black bean sauce - small portions, barely had clam meat in side and it was very very salty. It wasn't good at all. Don't bother getting this dish. Not fresh :(\n\nChicken chow main - noddle with over done, to soggy , very salty, and chicken was old And rubbery. - even the toddlers didn't like it \n\nHoney walnut shrimp - it didn't taste like any of the honey walnut shrimp we ever had. It would of been good but it tasted like they put Lemon juice or some kind of ingredient that didn't go well all together. :(\n\nSweet and sour chicken - now that was just  perfect :) hit the spot,  only good thing there.\n\nBBQ pork egg foo young - meh, no flavor \n\nKids ordered \n\nChicken fried rice, honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken and I forgot the other order. They didn't like it, especially the orange chicken - it was overly drenched with sweet sauce that it was over powering and it was hard to eat it. So we told our server that our kids didn't like the orange chicken, b'cuz it didn't taste right at all. There were no apology or asked to exchange the food. All we got was a rude response with evil eye saying that's how our orange chicken is. We asked her nicely to take it back and exchange it for the sweet and sour chicken.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-17", "description": "Throughout my first 7 years on Yelp I had read a number of reviews about Capital Restaurant and their famous chicken wings often referred to as the best chicken wings in Chinatown, and while I may have meant to bookmark the restaurant I never did.  As time went by I eventually forgot about the restaurant again.\n\nThat is until September of 2014 when I finally decided to check out Capital Restaurant after seeing some delicious pics posted by Scottsdale, Arizona Yelp friend Aileen B.  After just that one visit I was sold, and in the past several months I've found myself returning here more often than I have at any other restaurant when visiting San Francisco Chinatown.\n\nCapital's signature Chicken Wings are indeed a big draw here, and I agree they are very good.  I've certainly ordered it on more than three occasions.  These are big, plump chicken wings fried crispy with just the right amount of salt and jalapeno.\n\nMy favorite item to order on their vast menu however is the Hung Tao Yee Foo Wonton Soup.  This item was introduced to me by a bail bondsman acquaintance whose office I pass daily on my walk to work.  He's a Capital regular and one night while dining at the counter he stopped by and suggested I try this on my next visit.  I certainly did and I found that I really liked it.  The big plump wontons are deep fried then covered up in a rich seafood-filled broth.  You might think that the process completely negates the deep frying by making the wontons soggy again, but here's the secret.  The wontons end up with a delicious toasted flavor unlike any wonton I've ever had before, and the broth is amazing too combining bits of firm shrimp, squid, scallops and assorted mushrooms.\n\nThe Wor Wonton Soup is very good too.  Served in a clearer broth the plump traditional wontons are accompanied by Chinese greens, BBQ pork, mushrooms, shrimp and squid.\n\nIf rice is more favorable to your palate I suggest the Fukien Fried Rice.  It's egg fried rice covered in a gravy filled with chicken, shrimp, squid, scallops, Shiitake mushrooms and Chinese broccoli coins.\n\nOn par with other Chinese restaurants is the Beef Chow Fun with Bean Sprouts.\n\nOne thing I would not recommend is the Fried Crispy Squid which arrived hot and crispy but unseasoned and bland.\n\nThe service here is unlike most Chinatown restaurants in that the waitstaff is generally attentive and friendly, two traits not often associated with Chinatown restaurants.  The restaurant is cash only so be sure to come prepared.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-12", "description": "Chinatown history is daunting.  Over the years, it's incredible to fathom how much the neighborhood has changed.  \nFor old timers, this restaurant used to house one of a handful of Chinese American food spots in Chinatown named Mary's.  These places were widely known by local community residents, business people, and some who worked in the Financial District... Sun Wah Kue, Jackson Caf\u00e9, Tai Sam Yuen, Uncle's, etc.  As these old time favorites slowly closed, Capital came to be a popular breakfast and lunch spot for the local work force.  They offered breakfast favorites like ham or sausage and eggs, omelets, and my favorite ham and macaroni soup.  For lunch, they offered plates with daily specials which include corn beef and cabbage, ox tail stew (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qeCd6bbxM1T7i7VITWcqDg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  And for the bigger spenders, prime rib is offered.   Is it a culinary experience?  No, merely a chow down reasonably priced eats place.\nWith the closing of Pacific Court Caf\u00e9, there is a shortage of these businesses in Chinatown other than that roast pork place on Jackson Street.  The nice part here is that you can order Cantonese favorites like chow fun or wonton noodle soup.  \nThey are famous for their salt and pepper chicken wings, crispy, seasoned perfectly and still juicy inside; do not compare them to those Sunset District dry fried chicken wings as they are just different.\nOn a recent weekday lunch, not having ordered or eaten here in a while, I picked up an order of Mapo tofu over rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SEd4VyCI1DWS3U-a_IzBRQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) which did not disappoint.  They even packed a small container of their house soup to accompany my meal.  \nOld time style.  Old time service.  \nSometimes, there's just no reason to change things especially when it's good.", "author": "Mike C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-10-25", "description": "In the '60s and '70s, most Bay Area towns had at least one greasy spoon that served Chinese and American food.  Ping Yuen Bakery and Cafe on Pacific served a three course meal for a bargain price. I remember talking to an owner there who bragged that they bought their prime rib and steak from the same supplier as the Fairmont Hotel because a co-owner was a chef at the Fairmont.  The prime rib and French lamb chops were good there.  The other two courses were not very good, but it was a bargain.  \n\nCapital seems like the last of this dying breed.  I have walked by this place many times, but never entered until now.  \n\nMom said the place is a favorite of ABCs (American Born Chinese). Funny, she was born in SF, but never took me here until Friday.  The fried chicken wings are its most notable dish and the prime rib special served only on Tuesday is in the same vein as Ping Yuen's.  I asked if there was a special of the day and the waitress looked at me like I was crazy.\n\nWe started with the fried chicken wings which were beautifully fried.  The skin was very salty and crunchy.  Too bad the chicken meat was lacking flavor.  I was very disappointed.  I think they should marinate or brine the wings before frying.\n\nWe also had West Lake soup, black bean clams, garlic saut\u00e9ed snowpea greens and white rice.  What can I say...the greens were good.\n\nThe place was really noisy and all of the customers were speaking English, except for a group of French tourists.  When we left, someone was smoking a cigarette in the restaurant.  We could not see who it was but the smell was very strong.  I think it came from a table of restaurant employees who were eating their dinner.\n\nI think nostalgia led me to expect a better meal.  Even in the old days these Chinese American food places were sub-par, so why would it be great 40 years later?", "author": "Joanna S."}

Juicy inside crispy outside, but overall is too salty. Fukken fried rice was salty as well. You will find urself drinking a lot of tea after. I would not consider cheap just because it located in Chinatown plus you can find better food that was served under their price point. Service was meh, but it's normal because that's the signature of any chinatown in the US. Really? people would go here to eat from Canada or LA, no..not sure if these tourist just happened to pass by and owner makes it that up. I doubt it because it 's really normal food, nothing special. The FB video will help to draw the crowd in, but think twice if you wanted to fly all the way here for so so food. My opinion above is based on all the good food I tried so far in CA.

Having to fight for the attention of the employees should have tipped us off that this was going to be an awful experience, but we are positive thinkers. We had asked for a split check, and apparently this was too complex of a task because the splitting of the check was the catalyst for an avalanche of overwhelmingly disappointing behavior that lead to me, someone who never left a yelp review, to waste time out of my trip to San Francisco to write this review to warn any human being (or animal that might want to eat the trash from this place) to stay away from here. Not only was the food worse than freshly mowed grass, the waitress fumbled up our split check, overcharging us for the plastic food. It took 30 minutes to sort out the mess because of the waitress' incompetence and almost malicious behavior, and the only reason why it ended was because we decided this whole exchange wasn't worth it anymore.

This all changed when I went in for the first time--the food quality is really awesome! The fried tofu I had was perfectly cooked, with a crispy exterior and a tofu interior that is semi-solid--enough to hold itself together when you pick it up with chopsticks, but soft enough to crumble when you bite into it. The spiciness is also just right. The food quality of the place is especially surprising, given that this little modest shop one of the better restaurants I've eaten at in c-town. Talk about exceeding expectations!\n\nThe washroom is the one thing that is non-ideal (you have to walk in the kitchen, and past the entire kitchen crew), but the folks who work there seem to be doing the best they can with what they have (trying to keep it clean, by c-town standards). A lot of other c-town restaurants degrade to unimaginable levels (I'm looking at you, Sam Woo), which just goes to show how much effort the Capital Restaurant folks put into running the place with the sub-par equipment they were given.\n\nPlus, you can get free lemonade for a Yelp check-in.

Tasty, albeit a bit dry from being fried too long.\n\n* Egg Tofu w/ Special Meat Sauce - Not entirely sure why this was under the vegetarian section, but, basically, lightly fried egg-covered silken tofu discs, topped with meat sauce. Not bad, but a bit on the bland side, and not as spicy as the waitress hinted at.\n\n* Oxtail Clay Pot - First off, this was served in a metal bowl, not a clay pot.

Service was also much better than you normally find in this part of town.

Is it a tourist trap? Was it because Chinese New Year weekend was happening in Chinatown? \n\nMy husband and i were told before heading out to San Francisco we would have some of the best Chinese food in America . I took out my mighty yelp app and let the force guide my way. The darkness fell over yelp that day as we walked into Capital Restaurant. \n\nWe were ushered to a two person table top and given menus near the door.  The table and chairs were very retro by that I mean they were probably here when the place first opened. The menu had a huge selection to choose from. The outside and the inside of the building had pictures of the food so it could help in making an easier decision.\n\nAfter waiting about 10 minutes after putting in our drink order of water and tea I was getting frustrated. There seemed to be only one waitress for the whole place! WTF?!!? We finally put our food orders in and the wait began. This place is fairly cheap food and shouldn't take forever to cook. \n\nI ordered the fried tofu seafood hot pot. The fried tofu was soggy (even the pieces not in the broth). The seafood was good  but overall this lacked flavor. My husband meal is where it went downhill in a bad way. He ordered what I called the \"tourist trap combo meal\". It contained: soup, sweet and sour chicken, white rice, egg roll, and fortune cookie. The soup he decided to get was wonton and it was very Delicious and then the rest of the meal came out. I swear LaChoy family meal in a can taste better than what was served. The beef and broccoli was similar to some MRE meal I had eaten out of desperate while I served time in the Middle East while in the Army. The egg roll was overcooked and burnt. Also it didn't look like your traditional egg roll as it wasn't deep fried.\n\nIf this wasn't bad enough after the meals we didn't finish our meals. :( We decided \n  we both wanted to use the restroom before heading out back into Chinatown. I went first in search of the restroom to be told it was located in the kitchen area. WTF?!? I went thur the kitchen to discover the cooks preparing food and see a makeshift bathroom/cleaning closet that serves as a unisex bathroom. I came back and told my husband where to go. Apparently he went farther down into the kitchen and ended up seeing 2-3 sinks full of meat with water pouring of it.

It arrived at our table just warm.  I like it searing hot out of the fryer.  I am sure it would have tasted better fresh, it was just okay.\n\nThen came a plate of spareribs.  Maybe it was the Capital Spareribs?  Some pieces were rather bony and you had to fight for anything to eat.  Other pieces were very meaty.  It was tasty though.  I liked it.\n\nWe had a seafood and vegetable dish I can't find on the menu.  The squid was cooked perfectly.  It was nice and tender, not rubbery.  The same goes for the noodle dish we had.  I can't identify it either, but it wasn't very good anyway.  It was a little greasy.\n\nThe highlight of our meal was the chicken wings everyone talks about.  We saw a couple at a nearby table who ordered nothing but a huge pile of chicken wings.  I was sure it was more food than they could eat in one sitting.  We were incredulous...until we tried them ourselves.  Yes, they were as good as others said they were.  We probably could have knocked off another platter or two.  I had two pieces and could have made room in my stomach for more.\n\nWe were served orange slices for dessert, which I preferred to fortune cookies.", "author": "The Bottomless Pi T."}

Every week, I would go to the Sanrio store with 2 sandwich bags full of pennies I would find around the house and random places to buy one hello kitty lollipop. SADNESS. Talk about first world problems...\n\nKnowing the value of money, I should be haggling at the open markets, \"Two foi three dolla? NO...two foi one dolla and we deal!\" like my mom would. Instead I find myself, throwing down a hundred dollars on a weekly basis for one meal, the same amount my mom would use for a month's worth of groceries. Hey, I'm scarred penny pincher. :X\n\nContrary to my guy friends' belief that I'm a high maintenance food snob, I love my hole-in-the-wall restaurants too. When Albert L. told me about the $13 Prime Rib Tuesday Special at Capital, I couldn't wait to go as it would also give me a chance to try their infamous Salt & Pepper Wings. \n\nCapital Restaurant serves home-style Chinese cuisine in the heart of Chinatown. CASH ONLY. Most of the customers are locals and poh pohs and gong gongs so you know it's legit. It was a lot cleaner and larger than I expected it to be with good lighting and clean tables to accommodate about 70 people. \n\nF O O D\n*PRIME RIB TUESDAY SPECIAL ($13) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WWZtA0b7hY-4n19e2F4rbw?select=ODwlKhVXjHtXOB0uJ0Pp4g#P7F863oGBMMsdzpXu88-ng\nServed during lunchtime, we got the last slice of the day during dinnertime which we were warned ahead of time would be a medium doneness and a little cold. The prime rib was a bit tough, dry, and bland (I assume being the last slice and all). We really had to utilize the au jus which was oddly sweet. I believe in you pay for you get and this was a prime example. Please don't expect anything like House of Prime Rib quality because you will not find it in Chinatown and certainly not at this price. \n\n*THE INFAMOUS SALT & PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS ($7.95) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WWZtA0b7hY-4n19e2F4rbw?select=ODwlKhVXjHtXOB0uJ0Pp4g#vhCZ9oYvMdy8_OiNjbdcRg\nAfter hearing all the rants and raves about these crack-like wings, we were disappointed that they weren't very moist and the meat was incredibly bland. We must have received an old batch because the wings weren't piping hot either. I prefer the Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings at D&A Caf\u00e9 hands down. \n\n*STEAMED PRINCESS CLAMS ($10.95) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WWZtA0b7hY-4n19e2F4rbw?select=ODwlKhVXjHtXOB0uJ0Pp4g#ODwlKhVXjHtXOB0uJ0Pp4g\nThough I'm on a \"seefood\" diet where I eat everything in sight (*sigh*), I'm not a seafood person. However, this dish was one of the highlights of the night. The tender clams ntermingled with al-dente vermicelli noodles and seasoned with a mouth-watering savory sweet soy sauce. \n\n*EGG TOFU w/ Spicy Minced Meat ($8.95) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WWZtA0b7hY-4n19e2F4rbw?select=ODwlKhVXjHtXOB0uJ0Pp4g#RSC00Zp-BxrT21JpbtwBXw\nA must order along with the steamed princess clams; the tofu was incredibly silky soft like Japanese agedashi tofu with a nice crisp exterior. The ground beef with peppers gave it a nice spicy bite. \n\nS E R V I C E\nExpecting HELLA Chinesey service (aka rude and inattentive), I was pleasantly surprised to find the staff to be friendly and warm which boosts them up to 4 stars. Like a food paparazzi, one of the ladies saw me taking food pictures and she joked in Cantonese \"you better be taking nice pictures\". After taking 6 snaps for each dish and getting the silent \"hurry the f*ck up, you Yelp whore\" look from my friend, I better have taken decent pictures. \n\nOur \"cheap\" dinner ended up costing $60 for two people....for Chinese food.

The food is consistently good and the place is well managed.  It is a worthy substitute of Uncle's.  Uncle's was cheaper and there was more food - but Capital is better run and the food is just as good as the old Uncle's.\n\nThis is the place where people go for lunch who work in the area.  It's also where the elderly go for a meal.  You will see lots of elderly Chinese gentlemen at the counter wolfing down prime rib on \"prime rib day\" -   and flirting with the attractive waitresses who smile and tease the men in a genial way.  They speak in Chinese so I'm not exactly sure what they say.  The men always leave a generous gratuity.  \n\nWhen I was working, I came here by myself and sat at the counter to eat.  They have a special menu for different lunches every day of the week.  The special menu has two sides: Chinese and American.  I liked the corn beef on the American side - corned beef, cabbage and rice.  On the Chinese side I liked the minced pork with salted fish.  Usually I ate Chinese food there - and it was always good.  With your meal is delivered a soup and at the end is jello or ice cream.  The soups were always creative and delicious.  There is a memorable soup that has bits of corn cob in it.  I never fail to be impressed with the skills of Chinese cooks!  I never considered that there was a delicate and unique flavor to boiled corn cobs!\n\nI know it seems kind of dumb to go into a Chinese restaurant and order American food - but it may surprise you to know that the Chinese cook American food better than Americans - or Mexicans for that matter!  I once asked for Chili beans (something that most Chinese don't really enjoy is Mexican food) from a Chinese cook.  I expected something close but not that tasty.  I was surprised to find that what she produced was better than what I got from a Mexican resturant.  She did this cooking Indian food also.  She carefully watched my Indian friend cook the food - and then served it to me the following week better than what the Indian made.   You may likely be as astonished as I to eat the American special of the day at Capital and discover it to be better than what you could find at your own American restaurant.\n\nTip:  Their fried wings are the best I have ever eaten.  One of the best lunches I have ever had was to buy a growler of beer from The Thirsty Bear,  two boxes of those wings and consume the lot in Yerba Buena Gardens (near Thirsty Bear).  You need to coordinate with a friend because it's Capital is about a mile from Yerba Buena Gardens - but it's worth the effort!", "author": "Steve S."}

As an appetizer, they serve their soup of the day I believe. This time was a bok choy soup, which made me feel like I was at home. It had great flavor and wasn't overwhelming, yet not extremely salty like how many other restaurants make their soups. Next was like heaven on a plate, a thick, juicy, slab of prime rib served with rice (you have the choice of either spaghetti or rice), a side of veggies, and a bowl of au jus. Their perfectly cooked, medium rare slice of prime rib was melt in your mouth delicious. They even gave me the bone with quite a bit of meat on the side (if requested). I absolutely loved every bite of it, especially dipping it in their lightly peppered au jus that absolutely takes it to another level. If you didn't think you had enough, they top it off with a small bowl of jello and ice cream at the end to have you, and especially young ones, leaving with a full stomach. Your meal also comes with a cup of coffee, which is bomb, because the refills are free :)\n\nService:\nThe waitresses are always both friendly and attentive. They remember me and my parents whenever we come back. And even though they may seem busy, they notice if you're done with your dish, or if you need something, and they come right over and are happy to help. \n\nTips:\nSadly, this special is only available Tuesdays, but if you want, they have other specials available the rest of the days of the week. Sometimes, they run out of their prime rib special in a couple hours, so I suggest you come at 11am when it opens, or not too late. I remember I went at 12 once, and they ran out.

With that said, this past weekend I had a craving for some solid Chinese food so decided to check out Capital after reading all the hype. After weaving through the streets of Chinatown I get to this joint at around 6 PM which seemed like a solid time to go as the \"dinner rush\" gets in at around 7 and boy does it get busy. This restaurant is busy with tons of activity and the folks running it were actually very friendly oddly enough.  We were seated pretty quickly at the counter which is not the best spot as there are plenty of people walking in and out. \n\nThe servers were quick about bringing utensils and menus and took our order. Decided to order the Salt and Pepper wings, the string beans, and of course the egg tofu topped with meat. For whatever reason, the food took a bit of time to come out that day but the lady was sweet and brought out free soup and consistently asked other people to check on our order in the back which I found thoughtful. The wings are pretty solid but I would still say San Tung is my favorite but they are totally different. The wings were cooked well and the skin is great with the light salt and pepper flavor. The chicken itself was okay but the skin is what really makes these wings. The string beans were solid as the sauce seemed a bit sweet which surprised me because I thought it was a spicy dish. Nevertheless a solid dish and no complaints. The winner for this dinner was the egg tofu. This thing has great consistency and is just a solid plate of food. I thoroughly enjoyed this tofu dish and was actually sad that it came out last as I was already starting to get full.

I got the dish with two kinds of mushrooms. I think these veggie dishes are meant to be shared as sides because the server asked if I wanted a side of rice. I wish I asked for a side of wheat noodles. (Really don't like rice. Well, noodles come from China, don't they?) Argh. Now want noodles!\n\nThe food reminded me of my Chinese-friend-from-growing-up's mom's food, except better tasting and without cheap corn oil. In spite of the ubiquitous brown sauciness of the dish, hints of crystallized ginger came through. The flavor of mustard got lost amidst the mushrooms but at least it wasn't repulsive.

Their menu's cover pretty much has a picture of the chicken wings and says \"Best chicken wings in SFO\" too. The food was good but if that's truly the best chicken wings that SFO has to offer, then we're all in trouble. More on this below...\n\nThe good: We ordered two items and paid $20ish for them. Their menu was huge with the usual suspects in it (the typical budget-friendly Chinese restaurant at the neighbourhood corner flair). I wish the rest of my family was there so we could have tried out I more items. The food at the other, bigger tables looked and smelled good. \n\nThe bad: Cash only!! The place was crowded and looked dirty!! It's good for a small group but larger groups might have a hard time sitting together.  At first glance, you might think there is no space for a washroom - but you'd be so wrong! You have to pass through a pretty dirty kitchen on your way to a washroom that looked more like a built in portapotty from the outside. It was so bad, I could not even make it into the washroom and I just walked back to our table right away. \n\nThe food: \n1) Dried Scallop And Egg Fried Rice - really good. I highly recommend this. Not oily whatsoever and the flavour of the wok really came through. I would have come here for this.\n2) Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings - skin was nice and crispy.  Too salty and I could see the MSG too. And this is coming from\nsomeone who loves salt and would dot her fried rice with soy sauce. I really wish it came with a dip - as with most wings, the meat itself was not flavourful so it was definitely asking for some sauce or dip. The meat did not taste fresh - if you've ever had chicken that thawed longer than it should have, then you'd know this taste that I'm talking about.\n\nI would come back for the fried rice more than the chicken.", "author": "Carla A."}

I had a horrible customer service experience here but, shoot, it's Chinatown and since that whole region is NOT known for their customer service, I didn't knock any stars off for that.  \n\nIf you are in a group, get the Salt & Pepper Chicken wings to share.  There are normally 10 to a plate.  I usually don't care for chicken wings but these are light and crispy and one of the best in Chnatown (although I've heard that Sun Sang is better & cheaper too!)\n\nSurprisingly, the Egg Tofu with Spicy Pork (ask for a side of rice with the meal if eating solo) is really good!  I like tofu but not enough to order it at a restaurant but here, it's my favorite dish.  The tofu is soft and fresh and the minced meat and vegetables are tasty.  I've tried a LOT of their other dishes before I banned the place but will have to say the egg tofu with spicy pork is what kept me coming back. \n\nThey serve really cheap lunches ($4.50 - $7 range) and the food is good (not spectacular, just good) so I gave this place 3 stars.  Hong Kong Clay Pot is similar to Capital Restaurant in style but tastes better and is just as cheap so I would recommend that restaurant above this one based on taste and price and DEFINITELY customer service. \n\nAlthough I won't knock stars off for their service, I will highly recommend that if you order food to go to refuse to pay until the food is ready.  They are interested in closing a food order (getting the cash from those who haven't yet paid) over service so you might find yourself labeled as their bottom priority once your money is in their hands.   I was unapolegetically placed as a bottom priority after paying cash upfront for a to go order.  I sat and watched patrons come, order, eat, and go and still wasn't served.  When I asked about my order, I was told that they would go check but was never updated afterward.  They even asked me to move seats so that I can make room for other customers.

There's nothing particularly endearing about the place, but I guess when you hit a certain age you just want to re-visit the sites of pleasant memories with friends. \n\nWe get to Capital and it's crowded with locals, which is always a pretty good sign. It's a 20 minute wait for a table, which was a bit of a tight squeeze and hard to pull the chairs out with all the people hanging back in their seats on either side of our table. \n\nI think I changed my mind a good five or six times before the waitress came by to take our order since there were so many delectable choices.

Very filling with lots of meat slices, wontons, and noodles. I was also quite happy with the fried rice, which was thankfully much more savory than dry. \n\nGreat... it's coming up on 1 in the morning as I write this and now I'm drooling like Homer Simpson, wanting fried rice right now.

After reading the reviews, this place looked promising. Granted I didn't read every single one of them and with a hungry family, it was what we picked. We walk in and it's pretty empty, so with a group of six, we go in. It's cash only, no ATM available, but the lady, who I guess is the owner, tells you there's one around the corner and you can get cash from there. We sit and look over the menu. The waitress comes over, no greeting which I've already expected, and asks what we want to order. I start given out what we want and she walks away. I didn't even realize she was gone until I look up and find myself talking with no waitress around. She walks back a few minutes later and says she heard what I ordered, but I hadn't even gotten through half of what we wanted. There is a number associated with the dish and I start giving her the number and she tells me no number just say the dish, so I start naming off the dish and she has a hard time understanding me. I have no accent, grew up in the states, so I know it's not me. She's standing across from me next to my husband and instead of coming over so she can see what I'm ordering she just keeps asking me to repeat myself. No big deal, just did what she asked. You get a free order of lemonade for checking in, but only 1 glass no matter how many entrees you order. I wouldn't have ordered it, but my boy wanted lemonade. I saw her mixing the drink, which is powder and water, you can skip it, doesn't taste good. The hot tea that they serve is pretty much like other places. After all that, we are done ordering and can't wait to eat. We order a good amount of food and the food comes out pretty quickly. The food serving is enough for us and it tastes good, so we are happy. \n\nSo, walking around San Francisco, it's best to use the restroom when you can. My little boy needed to go, so we ask if there was one and surprising, there is. It's through the working kitchen in the back. I really, really wish we hadn't needed to go. The bathroom is so gross. Dirty rags, dirty floors, just looks like it hadn't been cleaned in months. I understand Chinatown is older and most stores are like that. Bathroom is just a side note, I know we aren't there to rate the bathroom, but the kitchen was so gross! Bugs, roaches climbing everywhere. There were chicken wings soaking in the sink. Who know how long it's been there. The water wasn't clear, but milky looking. People eating there would come back and wash their hands in the sink where the chicken was soaking. There was an open trash can, like the ones you put your trash in to take out to the curb, with the lid on top of the counter. Omg!! If I had seen this before we ate I would have walked out. I've been to Asia and am Asian, so I know this is common there, but with health standards in the states, it was shocking to see. The food tastes good and no one was sick after eating the food. The waitress and staff doesn't even bother me, I'm use to it, but because of what I saw in the kitchen area, we wouldn't eat there again. So 3 stars for taste of food, 0 star for the kitchen, so I give the place a 1.", "author": "Jean S."}

The noodles was not good & not impressive-no quality taste and the texture of the noodles is so so bad!!!! The chicken wing? Well nothing special at all, fried, served with jalape\u00f1o slices & that's it!!! Worst thing about this place is their kitchen!!! Ewww you have to see what I meant! It' s freaking dirty. I happen to see it when I went to use their bathroom. While I waiting for my turn to use the bathroom I had the chance to observe & look around. After I saw how their kitchen was, i wanted to throw up.

Second, the food is usually pretty greasy and MSG-filled.  However, I must say, the prices are always right and you kinda know what to expect and you can get more of the \"authentic\" dishes. \n\nHaving said that, the atmosphere is pretty shabby.  I don't know if it's word of mouth or they are published in some local tourist guide, but for a Sunday dinner, 90% were tourists and we were pretty much one of the few tables that were Chinese.  \n\nAtmosphere: The place is a total hole in the wall.  In order to get to the bathroom, you have to walk through the kitchen which is actually kinda cool.  Saw a big bucket of shrimp in the sink right next to the bathroom wasn't quite appealing though.  The bathroom is typical of all Chinatown establishments.  There is also counter seating for the solo-travelers looking for some cheap eats.  \n\nFood: Order from the pictures on the wall.  They have everything you want from veggies, seafood, meat, and all your chow mein and fried rice, and clay pots.  It's a good selection.  We had a variety of food.  I like the vermicelli clay pot and the tofu and the fried chicken.  Our friend brought their own fish for the chef to cook up (now thats the homey hook-ups).  After eating the food that night though, I was super thirsty (a sure sign of the MSG).  The food can be on the greasy and saucy side depending on what you order.  \n\nOverall: Its cheap Chinese food in Chinatown.  It has all the bases covered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-27", "description": "After a few missed attempts to grab a bite to eat, Vicky L. and I finally got a chance to meet-up for dinner recently.  On the menu?  Some budget-friendly food in Chinatown.  After all, when on the hunt for some good, cheap Chinese food, I can't think of anyone better for some recommendations than CCG!  Well, in addition to my utter uselessness for choosing restaurants in Chinatown (sorry Vicky!) - no joke, most of the places I know of have closed down or changed.  Given the semi-rain that was coming down, we took a short walk and eventually found ourselves at Capital.  \n\nNow, I have to admit...despite having lived in the city for years and years, I had never even heard of Capital and their famous Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings before we went.  When it comes to \"famous wings\", two generally come to mind - San Tung and Hooters.  And really, the latter isn't all that impressive (but the former is...and so good).  After grabbing a table and debating what to get, I ended up going with the Eggplant and Meat Sauce to go with the aforementioned chicken wings.\n\nServed hot out of the kitchen, there certainly is something about Capital's wings that puts the ones I've had at other Chinese restaurants to shame.  Whether it's the crispy skin, the moist and juicy meat, or the perfect seasoning (or all of the above really), it's no wonder people keep going back for more.  While most other places  will be decent in one regard or another, Capital's is good all the way around.  Though they may not top San Tung's wings for me, they are definitely the best Salt and Pepper Wings I've had.  The only drawback I could possibly think of is that it's served literally \"hot out of the kitchen\".  Should you decide not to wait for it to cool, don't be surprised if that oil scalds your tongue a bit.  Sure, it might be worth it at first, but then how are you going to taste the rest of the delicious wings after that?\n\nAs for the Eggplant with \"Meat Sauce\" (essentially ground pork and sauce), it was pretty good, mostly because the eggplants still had bite to them.  It's always nice to see when a place doesn't turn the eggplants to mush by the time the dish reaches the table.  The flavor of the \"meat sauce\" that came with it was good, and I really appreciated that they slather on a whole mess of it either.  In this case though, I did wish there was a bit more on the plate.  \n\nThe funny thing about all of this is that at the restaurant, I thought the food was pretty good and that I would end up rounding up to a four star rating.  The wings are a definite must have on any trip here, while my rice plate was solid, though not spectacular.  However, by the time I got home and had a chance to snack on my leftovers, everything tasted even better.  I don't know if it's because sitting in that box gave it a chance to soak in more flavors, but I nearly polished off the box.  Obviously when you're drunk or hungover, that's usually the case, but this was different.  It's somewhat rare to have that happen when you're sober and aware, so for that alone, they earned that last half star.  Definitely would come back for some cheap eats (parking permitting).\n\nAfter reading the reviews, and meeting the legend, I've now seen how the real CCG eats, and I can now say that it truly is good.

We stood around at the entrance waiting to be seated. Several parties walked right in, made gestures at one of the waitresses, and then just went to go sit down. (Rookie mistake #1 to avoid if you go). Once we decided what we wanted, mushu pork, we waited for someone to come take our order. Again, other tables were just waving their arms and/or grabbing someone as they went by (rookie mistake #2 to avoid). We gave them our order and they brought out some tea which was nice.\n\nThe mushu itself was really good. I thought the pancakes were oddly textured though, much thiner and tougher than I've had at other places where the tortillas resemble, well...tortillas. 4 stars for the food. \n\nThe bathroom is literally through the kitchen which was interesting. Typically I don't like to see the remains of the animal they cut up to put in my food, but I guess a good sign for freshness? That was a huge turnoff. \n\nThe main reason I subtracted a star was because the restaurant was so noisy, there was a ton of banging around, and lots of yelling. Service was also pretty non existent.", "author": "Rachel E."}

Service is different between Chinese and non-Chinese customers. I was here without my Chinese family and with a half-Chinese friend instead, and they pegged us as being not Chinese, which was a pretty interesting experience. Some notable differences: we weren't immediately offered hot tea, and were given a fork instead of chopsticks (the ultimate disappointment- I was rendered in shock for minutes!). \n\nAfter I started speaking Chinese, my service changed to what I would normally expect. I was also offered chopsticks (yes!). Later, I ordered a beer, and had my ID checked by one of the waiters. A few minutes later, another woman barked at me in Chinese asking \"are you even 21 years old?\" (now this is the kind of authentic Chinese service I expect!)\n\nI bore through the emotional stress of having lost evidence of my ethnicity all the while believing that glorious, delicious food awaited. We had the seafood hotpot, roast pork chow mein, and potstickers. Potstickers were ok, no surprises there. Chow mein was lacking in pork- slices of bbq pork were cut into even smaller slices for the noodles, and they tasted like they were likely yesterday's pork. The seafood in the hotpot was good, but lacked good fresh tofu and more vegetables- there was only cabbage leaves at the bottom (have definitely had better elsewhere). \n\nI go to Chinese restaurants to get a taste and feel of home, but I felt very alienated here!", "author": "Vicki S."}

I ordered a seafood Ho Fun with shrimp, and man I had to add soy sauce, and lots of it because it had almost no taste to it. The service here is okay, probably wouldn't be any good if you don't speak Chinese though. Overall, if there's another place you can go to, go there.

That being said, I can't believe the rating of this place! 4 stars? Are you kidding? In the San Gabriel Valley of Los Angeles, there are many dozens of places that out do this place on their worse day!\n\nThe fried chicken wings were the best of the bunch. They were crispy but a bit salty and tough. The tofu with meat sauce was good also but was under seasoned and the onions were not cooked out enough. The crispy chicken chow mien is a staple at all Chinese restaurants and an easy one to make. Unfortunately this popular dish gets a failing grade at this place. The noodles were under fried & soggy, sauce was under seasoned, and the chicken was full of cartilage. The  Chinese greens with garlic was underwhelming also. The problem here is that they used a really cheap main ingredient and majority of stems instead of ends. This is similar to eating a plate of broccoli stems! The last dish was a plate of fried rice which is best described as lifeless - flat in flavor, color, and appeal.  Skimpy on ingredients, but full of rice.\n\nThis place is cash only, so be prepared.

I guess Will Smith was lucky and stumbled upon a \"good\" Chinese restaurant (see pictures of him in the restaurant). We ordered the hot & sour soup (it was pretty pepper-y, and I thought it was good, typical), glazed walnut and shrimp (good, but also typical), some fish with eggplant (the eggplant was good but the fish was just alright), some fried rice (typical)...\n\nAnd now for the salt & pepper chicken wings. I was skeptical about how amazing it would be... And, I was right to be. It wasn't that amazing. It was average. As I bit into the wing, the oil splurted in my mouth. It was kind of gross, in that sense. The chicken was still tender, but it was too much oil for me. I wish there was more flavor, well more than the oil.\n\nAnyway, it is one of the better restaurants in Chinatown, so it would be a place to take somebody if you wanted to show them Chinatown's better food.

Came here with the rents one day when we were out in China Town just doing our thing. When we walked in we definitely stuck out as the only non-Asian people, but I knew that had to be a great sign in such a touristy area. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nMongolian beef: I'm the hold out non-pescatarian among my parents. They both went that way a few years ago, but I can't do it. This Mongolian beef was awesome! The slices of meat were super tender and juicy. Great flavor!\n\nScrambled egg and Prawns: very odd combo, but probably my favorite dish. The eggs were perfectly cooked and flavored just right. \n\nSeafood chow mein: awesome assortment of scallops, shrimp, fish, squid and I don't know what else. Super tasty. \n\nShrimp fried rice: one word: bomb. \n\nSweet and sour prawns: perfectly crispy shell. Sauce was to die for. \n\nThe service was pretty good. We're used to dishes coming out all at once, but here they came out as they were ready which lead to a bit of a time lag between the first and the last dish. I was ok with it, my parents less so. \n\nPrices were very reasonable. \n\nI certainly suggest a visit if you're in the area and looking to get away from the super tourist congested restaurants.", "author": "Eli Y."}

If you want Chinese food, stay away from anything that sounds like it came off a Panda Express menu (although hey, if you're a tourist and you like that kind of thing, then that's your jam), and go for hotpot or a noodle dish (preferably Shanghai or chow fun style). If you want American, they're famous for their wings, which I'll probably try next time I go. \n\nThe place was fairly crowded on Saturday night, about evenly distributed with Caucasians and Chinese (and a couple of mixed tables, too). The owner and waitresses were pretty prompt, considering the locale, and the food came quickly enough considering a steady stream of take-out customers waiting at the door, too. The beef chow fun with sprouts was standard, bit greasy and not the nicest cut of beef, but a good gravy and fresh sprouts. We also ordered the jajiang mien, which surprisingly was not the black gravy noodle that I expected, but a mildly spicy pork and bell pepper mince over the same kind of noodles - it was good, but definitely not traditional. \n\nDon't go here if you're on a diet, and don't go if you're expecting to be wined and dined - the list is red, white, and Sapporo, and you're going to be competing with tourists for half the seats in the restaurant - but go if you need a quick comfort food fix and you need a restaurant open past 7p.", "author": "Naomi L."}

Sis right off didn't like their tea so the server took it back and just refilled it. she was then told it's pre-made and comes out of a big POT. same thing just hotter. If you're fussy about your tea like my sister, then bring your own tea bag. I ordered a #80 which is shrimp with broccoli - remember that unless described in the menu as coming with other items, everything is otherwise priced separately. Say you order the shrimp with broccoli as I did. It doesn't come with rice or noodles; if you ask for rice or noodles it'll be priced individually and added to your total bill as a separate plate. The restaurant had about 10 persons eating, some asian and the rest visitors. The food was served quickly and it was piping HOT with good flavor which is a good sign  ;)  I did notice on the menu that they DO serve fried oysters which is something I've had before elsewhere but it was years ago, so the next time will try that. To get to the single unisex restroom you must go thru the kitchen, down a step and to the left. No parking on street unless you're extremely lucky.\n\nNOTE: Returned various days during June 2012 and ordered the fried Oysters (6) and O M G. They are HUGE oysters that are the size of mussel shells!!! they are BIG and batter-fried. Very tasty!!!! They were so huge that along with my food order I couldn't eat it all!!! Am told that actual size(s) of the oysters will vary but so far after many orders on different days (even to take out), in general the size has been pleasantly BIG  ;)", "author": "Tony L."}

The wait from order to food was okay but I could not help but notice that others in the restaurant (possibly regulars?) were receiving much more attentive and prompt service.\n\nI ordered General's Chicken, my favorite dish when eating Chinese.  It was only okay and on par with other places I have tried.

Their reputation for the salt and pepper chicken wings is well deserved--because I can't tolerate too much heat, I ordered them without the peppers and they are still just incredibly delicious. Beautifully crispy and fried to perfection--and I prefer the 'dry' style of them to something covered in sauce. I also tried the egg tofu with meat sauce. I'm typically not much of a tofu fan but these were really interesting and the sauce is very unique. Portion sizes are big and the prices are great, especially for the quality. The restaurant is kept very clean and the patrons are a great mix of neighborhood fans, families, tourists, working folks and locals. Absolutely among the best Chinese restaurants in all of Chinatown.", "author": "Jess R."}

I thought they were done well with the perfect amount of spice and a nice crunch but not as good as the wings at San Tung. Every other dish we ordered was sadly sub-par. \n\nEgg flower soup, bland broth that tasted like straight water with no eggy flavour along with what looked like leftover vegetables scraps. Beef stew clay pot with turnips, was decent. The meat was a little tough and the flavors were somewhat satisfying. BBQ pork chow mein, again nothing really notable.\n\nMy go-to dish for Chinese restaurants, dry sauteed string beans, was a huge disappointment here. Flavorless beans, some undercooked, accompanied by large amount of dry and bland ground pork. \n\nOverall, everything was just bland.

The ambiance was festive, filled with families spending time together over the weekend. We ordered the medium seaweed tofu soup ($4.95), signature fried chicken wings ($5.50), and oysters omelet ($8 plus change) to share.\n\nThe seaweed tofu soup was filled with silky tofu, egg flower, mushrooms, split peas, and plenty of seaweed with generous pieces of slippery pork deliciously marinated with starch. The soup base was light and easy with a tinge of salt as the perfect gateway to the rest of the meal. Next, our 10+ pieces of fried chicken wings came with a dash of salt, jalapeno and pepper. This simple concept was perfectly executed with a scrumptious mind blowing crunchy texture on the outside and juicy piping hot chicken meat within. The wings were well seasoned and the amount of peppers and jalapenos added a nice accent without compromising the essence of a good fried chicken. Lastly, our fried oyster omelet came with eggs well done with scallion and generous portions of oysters embedded at the center. It was a dish that reminded me of childhood and met my expectations.\n\nService was brief but disappointing. The last time I was insulted when our table was treated differently from the rest with their offering of fortune cookies instead of fruits at the end of the meal. This time, we were skipped over on both items so we were left hanging without either sweets or treats. Oh no you didn't--so unfair and jaw dropping sadness! Three stars for the badass chicken wings. Since I don't know how many more rounds of poor service I can handle at this place, can someone please tell me where to find better chicken wings that come with some decent service?", "author": "Daniel L."}

We also found a piece of black rubber in our pea sprouts dish.

Given that it's crab season, I expected crab with much more meat in it. Next time I'm craving crab, go to R&G for their salt and pepper crab.

I've been hearing great things about their wings so I was super excited to try this place out but I was pretty disappointed! I only wanted to try the wings so I ordered it as a take-out. It was around $8 for 10 or so wings. I consider that pretty pricey but nothing to the price of wings at San Tung. The outside of the wing- fried skin part- was delicious! It was crunchy, tasty, and everything you're looking for in the perfect wings. However, once I got though the skin and into the core of the wings. It was bland. It was not juicy, tender, and flavorful like how I imagined it to be. It was just a typical salt and pepper wing that I can probably find at a Chinese shop in Chinatown, if not better.

That's when I put my trust into my fellow yelpers to lead me in the right direction. It seems that everyone loves Captial's \"famous\" chicken wings, and the Lord knows I absolutely love wings - I even once entered in an all-you-can-eat wings contest. So it was a no-brainer to try their \"famous\" chicken wings. \n\nThis place seems catered toward the American crowd although there were some Chinese in there. Decided to go with the Mongolian Beef and of course, the \"famous\" chicken wings. I was excited. \n\nThe Mongolian Beef came out first and was your typical dish ordered at most Chinese restaurants. Nothing stood out about this dish but who cared at that point because I was just there for the \"famous\" chicken wings. And that's when I was disappointed. The wings are just that, wings. Nothing special about them. In fact, no special batter and/or seasoning. Just salt and pepper and deep fried. Not to mention WAY too over-salted. It was pretty bad. I believe a single order is 13 wings, which was a great portion amount for the price. But I honestly had to force myself to finish them off because I don't like to leave food behind.\n\nI just don't understand how people can rate these \"famous\" wings so highly.

Weirdly enough, I've never had to wait long for the food here.  This past time, I came with a group of about 10 people. When we sat down, we immediately ordered 3 plates of the chicken wings. ITS A MUST!!! Its hard to describe, but its almost salt-and-pepper type that's juicy and deep fried. SO good.\n\nThe other food is pretty decent. I haven't had poor service or food here yet.  The servers are friendly and quick.  Since we had a huge amount of food and many people, the table was actually a little small. But the servers were able to work around that and keep basically all the food on the table...sans the rice. Our rice was placed on a side table.  For about 12 dishes (I count all three chicken wings), the total came out to about $130...and that's including a nice tip.\n\nPlease note - I think it says something about them accepting credit cards here...I don't think they do. I asked the servers once and they said no...", "author": "Lily W."}

None of my girlfriends read Chinese so it was up to me to tell them what was on the 'all Chinese menu'.\n\nAfter much discussion we decided upon a few homestyle dishes to share.... a stir friend veggie with garlic, some pork dish (I don't remember what it was exactly) and a steamed chicken dish. Steamed rice and complimentary soup were given to us probably as part of the meal since we didn't order any.\n\nThe food was just so-so. I mean it's edible, nothing exciting and it wasn't bad. My girlfriend was getting pissed off at the bad service but I mean c'mon, we're in Chinatown...... not Beverly Hills! \n\nWe ate and we sat and chatted without them getting too pissed off with us.

I was also looking for some peace and quiet. I sat at the counter where the staff quickly made room for me. Unfortunately, they sat me next to two AMERICAN TOURISTS, who without introducing themselves asked loudly where I was from. This took me a little by surprise, so I answered, \"I live here.\" I could tell they wanted me to play the \"aw, shucks, isn't this city neat\" game, and I was really hungry, having run errands all morning. After answering their blunt question, I looked back at my menu so I could give my order to the patient waitress. The woman tourist said under her breath, \"she doesn't want to talk to us.\" Really, lady? I'm 5 inches from you. I heard that. And no, I don't want to talk to you, but I was going to be as polite as I could be, but now I'm going to be exactly the kind of person you think I am. It's a cash only restaurant, which is written all over the entrance, but they failed to see that, and they only had two dollars, which they loudly lamented to everyone. The man was rude to the waitress, who was tenaciously kind back. They went to an ATM together and left her purse because she didn't want to be \"left alone with me\". Seriously. \n\nMy wonton soup was good.", "author": "Kat R."}

That's the only reason to explain why it's so freaking tasty and addicting.  \n\nWe had no clue about the wings - we were in the area and wanted to try a new place.  We looked at the menu and it looked promising.  Actually, the dishes on colored paper strips throughout the restaurant are the real winners.  I was reading and exclaiming to hubby \"wow, they have this\" and \"wow, they have that\".  I only wish I had my family with me so we can order everything I wanted to try.  But my rational hubby suggested we only try a few things, just in case it's not good and we can always come back.  Makes sense but so hard to decide what to order.  \n\nWhile debating, we noticed almost 50% of the customers had the salt & pepper chicken wings and were chomping away.  This turns out to be the highlight of the meal.  Spare me just a minute to explain.  The dish had ~14 wings - just the middle section and they were big, plump and juicy.  The best yet though is the crispy skin - it was so light, crispy, finger licking tasty and not oily.  The flavor is more than just salt & pepper, there was a hint of the five spice.  Hubby said it tasted like the ones we get in Vancouver - a very popular joint that often has a long line of die hard fans.  It also reminded me of the wings we had in NY Chinatown from a street vendor - where we braved pouring rain but laughed and enjoyed every bite while soaking wet.\n\nWe also had the \"tong yuen\" - flour ball - I was really looking forward to this dish.  To think I can eat this at a restaurant and not have to spend hours making it at home or begging my bro-in-law to make it.  While it used all the right ingredients - it just didn't cut it.  Back to begging or bite the bullet and make it myself.\n\nThe last item we tried was the oxtail stew w/ bean curd over rice.  I have to give it to hubby on this one because he nailed it - they used too much vinegar and we believe they did that to tenderize the meat quicker.  Yes, another pass.\n\nYeah, 2 dishes were passes BUT the wings can redeem them and then some.  \n\nEven if you only come here for the wings alone, it's worth it.  CASH only.", "author": "Gloria H."}

I'm pretty sure my ancestors were laborers or farmers since everytime i eat some Clay Pot Rice...i feel at home and with a nice contentment that lasts until the next urgent meeting and firedrill pops up at the office.\n\nEvery so often i'd rally up some other souls who crave the flavors of rice that is enhanced by the clay pot as it is by the dried cured meats and a light soy mix.   It's an ancient art and done so right here since the translucent rice absorbs all the flavors and oils from the dried meet giving off  a strong, yet somehow pleasant aroma.  I always ordered the cured duck with sausage and cured pork... i have to use my broken chinese...but it works here and they don't laugh too much.  My other comrades just sit back since they're all ABC but appreciate this earthly homely cuisine. Good thing they serve it big as we have a party of 5 dudes.. (also note the Claypot Rice is not on the menu...it's posted in the side in pure Chinese)\n\nWhen the huge clay pot of rice comes, you open it up and smell that homely goodness that's at one time greasy and warm...yet oh so delicious and refreshing... food for the chinese farmer soul.  The rice is perfection and so good this way...they've already scouped out the meats to  a dish for you.  chinese antipasta?...but again... strong tasting but soooo good.  We have to fight for the pieces of duck and cured pork...but oh so worth it.  They also give a dish of bok choy with huge fried garlic on the side to help digest this heavy food.  The best is yet to come... they offer to pour broth of soup to the bottom of the pot when your done..but that's a chinese no no for me... the best part is the slightly burnt, crispy rice stuck to the bottom and edge of the pot.  Not only is it crispy, but it's enhanced by the duck and pork fats from the cooking..it's like finding another treasured dish within a dish.\n\n\nTheir other dishes are standard chinese dishes you get anywhere but done a little above average...although their salt and pepper fried chicken here is a must and stand out.  Comes straight out from the fryer, it's salted just right, with garlic and I try to bite it with the jalepeno's as often as I can.  One of these days i'm going to pull a happy hour here with some tsing tao beer and these wings by themselves...probably the best executed salt and pepper wings in the bay area.  Bursting with juices and moist...they've probably brined these tasty wings but who cares... it taste friggen good.\n\nOverall, highly recommend their clay pot and chicken wings.  Just make sure you get a lot of people as the clay pots are huge...and they told me comes in 3 sizes...with the smallest the size of a 9 quart kettle.   (if you want a smaller size clay pot rice for 2..i'd recommend utopia that's down the alley block).", "author": "Vien C."}

Some say you can't go wrong in Chinatown when eating chinese food, but they would be very very wrong. You can do quite bad. This, fortunately, is none of that. \n\nThis place is indeed low key as it should be, with an extensive menu including other things in Chinese as one would expect. The bathroom is located behind the kitchen, so you have to go through their workspace to urinate, which is quite intimidating at first, but they're used to it, and the kitchen is (surprisingly!) very clean (for Chinatown). The wait staff was also surprisingly good with English and very friendly, with a sense of humor. \n\nThe food was quite good, with no bad dishes in our ~10 dish dinner (preset menu + some additional stuff). The spicy chickenwings were a surprise, they seem to be quite popular and they should be, perfectly fried, not too greasy/battered, and quite salty (but not too salty). We also had a whole flounder, which was cooked in a black bean sauce instead of fried, so it was probably fresher than we've been used to. The beef stew bean curd clay pot is outstanding, and everything else is cooked nigh perfectly with no complaint by anyone (all chinese and one anglo) at our table. Spareribs were sweet and crispy, the soup (NOT the hot/sour, but I'm not sure which it was) was great, whole chicken was good. They even have waffles/ice cream for dessert, and offer breakfast in the mornings ! Prices were standard for Chinatown, about $6-12 for dishes, averaging around $7.50. \n\nThere's pretty much nothing not to like about this place, at least when I went there.

For seven bucks, you have an amazing snack that you have trouble putting down!  Admittedly, the rest of the dishes here is about average compared to the other restaurants you could go to in the area, but nonetheless this is the place I always go when I visit friends working in SF.\n\nThe restaurant itself has the typical \"dirty Chinese restaurant\" feel, though I often like to say that this is how you know the food will be good: dirty to where the tables are a little sticky, but not because of food particles; having a particular smell that only seems to go away after you've been sitting for five minutes; and there are tons of \"special items\" written in Chinese taped to the wall.\n\nI typically go with about four people, though they have two tables that may be able to squeeze 7 or 8 in.  There's no TV so do not expect to stay by yourself too long, though they do have a bar-like seating in case you are by yourself.  Taking to go seems to be common here.

I've always called Chinatown as a cesspool and a place that only caters to tourists. I'm even willing to claim that Chinatown in SF uses Chinese cooks in the back yet, the food tastes worse than when a non-Chinese cook is stirfrying and cooking his heart out elsewhere. \n\nThis place was a very pleasant surprise. We were on a time crunch and had an appointment near Chinatown so unfortunately I couldn't go to a more desired restaurant that the city offers. A quick check on my iPhone yelp app and scanning a few reviews reminded me of Capital. I came here once years ago, slightly buzzed, very hungry and not really remembering what I ate except for these delicious wings. \n\nWe hopped on in, sat down and ordered. It is your typical Chinatown \"shady restaurant\" and things can definitely use some windexing and tables and chairs can be a little sticky, but the food and service here was very pleasant. The waitress actually smiled... and stopped what she was doing to refill our water. We ended up with the sizzling rice soup - very yummy! The shrimp was completely deveined and they had little slices of calamari in there. (Very fresh...) Salt and Pepper chicken wings.... Totally divine!! S asked for a side of sweet and sour sauce. I loved how there was very very limited batter on these wings. Nothing but little wings seasoned with salt/pepper/jalepenos. We also got a salted fish/chicken tofu claypot. The claypot was on the salty side, the salted fish added a nice brine to the dish without being rancidly fishy. The tofu was silky and plump. The dish was a bit heavy on the ginger - probably to cut the fishyness. If we didn't have the chicken wings, the claypot would have been great. The chicken wings set a new bar and expectation... in comparison, the claypot was only mediocre. Highly recommended if you can get past the sticky shady Chinatown look.\n\nOh yeah, bring cash.

I've burned my tongue on a dish or two here.\n\nBe careful of some of the servers.  They act like they speak English but then they have no idea what you're saying.  This is after you point to the menu too.  Once we tried ordering and she said okay and walked away.  A minute later she came back and said, what did you want?  We pointed to the menu and she said ok and went away again.  She came back with another waitress to ask again.  Pretty funny.   Just ask the lady with the heavy eye shadow.

Sat at the counter and ordered the only combination plate for one, which included wanton soup, sweet & sour chicken, beef with broccoli, and egg roll and rice. I found the portions more than generous although the flavor seemed a little off to me. The sweet & sour chicken erred a little too far toward the \"sweet,\" coming off like some sort of chicken-flavored candy. The beef lacked flavor altogether (and was a bit chewy). The wanton soup also lacked any real flavor, although it's possible the salty expectations set by my local Chinese takeout restaurant in Cambridge, Mass. influenced my opinion somewhat. And the egg roll looked like an overcooked appetizer from the frozen food section of the supermarket. Worst of all, the sauce from the chicken pooled around the plate with the water from the beef/broccoli making a big soupy mess on the place.\n\nThere must be something about this place as it filled up quick and I see a lot of good reviews, but unfortunately I don't have nearly enough time in town to get back for another go and this particular experience just didn't do that much for me.

How did I find out about it?  A Japanese waiter from Umi told me.  He was drooling just talking their famous chicken wings.  So we go there and see what its all about.  We walk in there with our Santa suits from Santacon.  The owner had to take a picture of us.  We got hella stares, especially from all the older Chinese ladies.  Couldn't help but laugh the whole time, but other than that, let's get to the food and service.  So I speak Cantonese and the waitress and I got chummy chummy already.  Joke with her, calling her my sista, and she was on it.  WAs super sweet, attentive, and even persuaded us to get two orders of wings and a round of beers.  The wings came and they were hella hot.  Salted just right, with jalapenos to spice it up a bit.  Super cripsy, juicy and yay, pretty good.  And its my favorite part of the wing too.  How could they go wrong then.  Then we ordered the pea pod leaves, tofu mushroom and beef chow fun.  The food came out fast, even with a packed house.  Beef chow fun was a bit bland, but nothing a little soy couldn't fix up.  The others dishes were good.  I enjoyed it, but honestly. . . Chinatown, trying to find parking just to have wings.  Hmm, maybe just a once a year visit will do.  Nothing I can't go thru a Popeye's tp get even more conveniently at.  Any who, and the last bit.  Have fun going to the restroom.  Its way in the back.  You have to walk thru the kitchen, pass all these short chefs, and then go down another level further into the pits to use the restroom.

They also serve waffles (random?) so the whole place smelled like batter. It was super cheap though - huge portions and all for about $10 a person.", "author": "Marina P."}

The only thing is parking is impossible to find.. I usually do take out and eat them quickly before it gets cold.   Also, I tried the clams with black bean sauce they are also a winner..5 Stars for the Chicken wings.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

The string beans were cooked perfectly. \n\nI have two complaints: very little gravy came with this dish and the portions were not big (but adequate). When I order a rice dish, I like lots of gravy to go with the rice and I had to scrape the bottom of the barrel to get enough to mix with my rice. The meal was well cooked, however, so I plan to return to try their other dishes. \n\nTea and soup was included with the meal.\n\nThere are two lunch menu specials - a Chinese one and an American one. The American special includes ice cream for dessert.\n\nI don't know what the purpose of serving American food in a Chinese restaurant is but it's done here.", "author": "John C."}

Everything else on the menu is good, too, though I'd skip ordering a waffle. Really, who orders a waffle at a Chinese restaurant? I actually have no idea what else I've eaten here, as I'm always with people who speak Cantonese, and I can't understand a thing they're ordering. However, you could almost certainly order randomly and still be happy, provided you're truly omnivorous. Just make sure you get the wings!", "author": "Michael G."}

A little bit at least, it's just not as good as it used to be. On a good day I would give it a 3.8 star, but over all it's a 3. Salt and Pepper chicken is pretty good like everybody say it is, everything else is average/decent, nothing special, and it's not that cheap considering the quality. But they keep the place pretty clean and cozy, so it's pretty good to sit down and have a comfortable meal, try them.", "author": "Wes Z."}

My friend had the spare rib with green beans.  I stole glances at the plate in front of another woman at the counter; she had some shrimp & dumpling looking feast.  Lots of locals were dining here, thus my decision to venture into the spot off the beaten path.  Another local patron made me promise not to disclose the one of a kind find.

Looked ok from the inside, so I decided to order. I ordered the Dinner Special 1, which is beef and brocoli, pineapple chicken, rice, dumpling soup and a fortune cookie. It took about 25 minutes for the food. Not terrible, but I saw people being seated, ordering and receiving the food before I got mine. So, I was a little put off. But, that wouldn't have been enough to warrant my 2 stars. The food is just OK in my mind, nothing special or memorable. Everybody did rave about the chicken wings, and I saw a couple of orders, and they looked better then what I got, so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.

It is a bare bones place with wooden tables and chairs and a Formica or wood floor.  The waitresses are very nice.  The prices are rock bottom.  Pot stickers have skins that are crispy golden on one side and not too thin or thick and not doughy on the other; the filling of your typical ground pork, ginger, and cabbage filling which is excellent.  The Capital plate (barbecued pork, which is tender and marinaded in Honey and Chinese five spices, egg rolls that are crispy with fresh vegetables, and fried prawns that are greasless, crispy, and succulent.)  The sweet and sour sauce was well balanced.  Round everything off with a Ching Dao and you cannot go wrong.  The bill, which also included my mother's red wine was $21.20.  So, for rock bottom prices, quality service, and excellent food, Capital Restaurant cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}
