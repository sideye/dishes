It seemed modern, but much smaller in size than say the SFMOMA. With Asian museums and Jewish museums..it's nice that there's a museum for African-American people, culture, history, etc. But the exhibits did not stand out today. I was lost and not sure about the focus of these exhibits. I think if they had a bigger space, they could do more. It could be very useful to spread knowledge and awareness of African-American culture, life, and experience. I went for free, but it's usually $10. Located in SOMA. I am sure tourists might find interest.", "author": "Denise C."}

Books. Beats\" w/ DJ Cavem Moetavation. This holiday party on the first floor of the museum featured a curated selection of must-have cookbooks celebrating food of the African Diaspora. There was plenty of great tunes from hip-hop, soul, & jazz. I especially loved the old school hip hop including songs by Tupac, Tribe Called Quest, & Nas. \n\nI am a Bryant Terry fan as he is a African-American vegan based cookbook author who lives in Oakland. I love his cookbook \"Afro-Vegan\" as it features farm-fresh African, Caribbean, & Southern Flavors remixed. \n\nI have cooked from his cookbooks before & find the recipes highly creative & innovative. My favorite part of his cookbooks is suggested songs to go w/ each of his recipes as besides loving vegan food I also love an eclectic array of tunes.\n\nBesides the DJ playing plenty of great tunes there was also drinks & light bites. I enjoyed some Middle Eastern food including Muhammara & Butternut Squash Tahini w/ pita bread & Za'atar mini'eesh which was all vegan. It was a great spread. There was also two types of wine available yet passed on those as don't drink.\n\nAs I was enjoying my eats someone was speaking to me next to me yet the music was so loud I couldn't hear him at all & only saw his mouth moving as not to be impolite I just nodded my head.\n\nBryant Terry walked up to us & was very personable as said hi to us for a hot minute. So cool to finally meet him.\n\nThe staff who worked here were very kind & welcoming. The books that were curated in the gift shop were on point. I will definitely return here to check out more of the Museum another day yet have to admit they throw some serious holiday parties & serendipity happens.", "author": "Shane S."}

Apparently (although I didn't see it anywhere) when we went it was all about Carnival in different Caribbean nations. This might have been interesting but nothing was particularly engaging. Some of the pictures were beautiful but the descriptions were seriously lacking i.e. sometimes made no sense and did not explain the exhibit (maybe I'm just dumb). The reason I say to check the exhibits it because I was expecting more variety ie talking about wider diaspora and so it's helpful to control your expectations.\n\nThe place is also tiny. Like seriously we were done in 45 min and we were not going fast there was just not really much to see despite 3 floors. I wonder if sometimes the floors have more stuff. \n\nAnyway all in all could have been better but good to show your support for the cause. Hope they can continue to improve.", "author": "Neechi M."}

There is more nudity than I believe is reasonable so we will not be bringing our children to visit with us.

We expected the MoAD to be a museum of historical and cultural items related to the migration of people from Africa to other parts of the world. We know that much of this was done forcefully with the slave trade but continues today for many reasons, both good (educational & economic) and bad (flight from war and other catastrophes.)\n\nWhat we found was more of a small art gallery. Most of the exhibits were visually appealing however overall the exhibits and posted explanations were not clearly related to the diaspora. In that, we were disappointed, or at least confused. \n\nThe smaller pieces were attached to the walls using paper clips hanging from small pins in the wall. This looked rather bizarre for a museum/gallery, amateurish. \n\nThe woman at the admission desk was very friendly and gave considerable orienting information. The cost is low. We parked in a public lot about a block away, that cost us $10 for 2 hours. The museum website has a link for parking in the area.  That was very helpful.", "author": "Nancy O."}

As the years continued, slavery was eventually abolished and what was left were their descendants who never set foot on the African continent. All they knew was that America was their new home. So began the struggle to claim and assimilate into American culture.\n\nMet with a huge amount of resistance, they still persevered and fought for equal rights, not only for blacks, but for all minorities alike. \n\nWith great leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. who took part in the Civil Rights movement and adopted Mahatma Gandhi's approach of non-violent protest, this opened many doors for awareness and equality. This is the beauty of what we have accomplished here in America.\n\nThis museum has a compilation of African art and history from not only America, but also from around the world.\n\nA proud and noble display of the achievements and progression of African culture in different countries; here at MOAD, they recognize and put forth their defeats and their creations, their losses and their triumphs, and their sadness and their pride.\n\nAt this museum, they offer exhibitions that use projection screens, multimedia images, computers, talking walls, and interactive tables, not to mention the various artwork displayed throughout. \n\nAdmission is fair.

I would return to see that again. The one issue I had were the stations around the corner that played various types if music - gospel, blues, jazz, etc. That interfered with the Cflua Cruz film sound. Perhaps the volume on the stations could be lowered or headphones could be provided. \n\nI listened to a bit of the audio of slave narratives. I looked at the stations about food and the diaspora - seemed like a good idea but the info seemed a bit too basic - perhaps it was aimed at children. There were three stations that addressed culture, appearance and dress that motives faces into another and another. I've seen this before but this was well done and compelling. \n\nThe stairs and elevator have tons of tiny photo portraits covering the walls. Made the trip visually significant. \n\nThe Heritage Center was a bit hidden. There were some pieces if art in the walls leading in. A staff member greeted me and let me know the film that was running was about the Fillmore neighborhood of SF. There were computers with info about MOAD. I wasn't sure how that was different from the website but didn't ask. \n\nThe reason I went to MOAD besides that I had been meaning to go for years was to see the Romare Bearden exhibit. I had seen his collages and watercolors at MOMA a few years back and that was a fabulous introduction and overview of his work. This was his graphic work and really illustrated his process. There were a few examples were several versions of his work were shown. There were a few etching or collograph plates on display. Some handwritten pages about different art materials made me feel as if I were looking over the artist's shoulder. \n\nI was tremendously inspired by seeing these works if Bearden's and I may try to return before it comes down in two weeks time. \n\nBecause I so thoroughly enjoyed the film and the special exhibit the $10 admission seemed reasonable. \n\nI do think the permanent exhibits could use some work.

'Diaspora' is defined as being a migration or scattering of a people.  I'm unsure as to why this museum specifically used this word because they do not host works specifically on this topic.  And why not just be a museum that hosts the rich history of African art instead of one movement of the African experience?\n\nMOAD is split up into three levels.  There's a gift shop, performance area, education center, and art collection.  If you're expecting to look at a lot of African art, prepare to be disappointed.  While the art they do have is very good, it's primarily 2D visual arts.  There are some multimedia pieces and a theater that plays a short documentary, yet nothing that competes with other museums such as SFMOMA, Asian Art Museum, or even the new Contemporary Jewish Museum.\n\nI've been wanting to come here for a long time but never really heard anything about it.

Me, my sister, my BF and my brother all went to this place so excited at celebrating the African Diaspora.  Instead, we saw a sparse \"gallery\" and left within thirty minutes feeling frustrated and disappointed.  \n\nThe gift shop is very small considering the amount of space on the ground floor.  It was also disappointing to see that some of the dolls were Einstein dolls and Freud dolls... What do they have to do with the museum?\n\nOn the 2nd floor, it was like a gallery with series of pictures in different areas with little or no discription by the pictures.  I was hoping for even a small story or background pertaining to the pictures.  In one series a metal ship was show out of water photographed from various exterior angles.  We wondered, was this a ship that transported African slaves?  Or was this a ship that was used by Africans to trade goods or flee their motherland?  Or maybe, someone suggested, these pictures were merely by an African artist.  \n\nAnother series of pictures showed a blackened pumice looking landscaped with slaughtered goats accompanied by men.  We wondered, is this a ritual killing?  Is this a systematic or seasonal function, or was this just the open market for buying and trading meat?  \n\nThe worst was a series of pictures of tire marks in mud with water pooled in the mud.  They were laying on the floor with velvet ropes around them.  Was this the mud from Africa? Or were the tiremarks made by an African?  Or was this the truck that drove someone out of Africa?  \n\nThe most exciting and informative part of the feature was a small 6-8 foot wall that had video slide shows on food.  I read about black eyed peas and how beans and rice are common to most cultures around the world, and how rice came from Africa... and how beans and rice were a complete protein.  Then we learned about greens, how in Africa greens were consumed as a staple food.  When African slaves came to america, they cooked the discarded greens off of root vegetables, such as turnips.  This was the the information and integration of culture I was looking for.  But unfortunately, this was only a minor display inthe scope of the entire museum. \n\nThere was a small dark room in which slave narratives where being performed.  (Pre-recorded audio.)  That would have been interesting if there was more of a story in place.  But most Americans should have some sense by now what slavery was likened to, and have read at least one account of such things.  And it didnt really tie into the entire theme or idea of the African Diaspora.  \n\nThere is a small computer learning room tucked away (seemingly) in the back offices of the museum on the third level.  But this information is like accessing the encyclopedia britannica online.  Where the museum was lacking, the computer room had so much information.  But to read about the African Diaspora in this manner, was so arduous.  For that much, I would rather stay at home and read about African cultures, assimilation and migration at home, online.  \n\nAnd then the computers offered the history of each of the 2000+ pictures that create the mosaic that can be seen from the street.  But who has time to click on each picture while on the computer?  When I clicked on 6, all six were lacking stories anyway.  \n\nI think I would have been much happier buying an art / photography book such as those \"24 hours in...\" books.  I would have learned SO MUCH more.  And I would have spent the same amount of money.  \n\nI just wanted to really have a great richness added to the views that we have on the African Diaspora, and this museum failed miserably.  \n\n(I did write to the museum in hopes that they will revamp the museum.  Everyone that I went with was quite disappointed with the museum.)", "author": "GingerSnap G."}

There's also another room that has nothing in it. you sit in the dark, there are two benches. there is darkness and voices of slave reenacted real slave narratives speak in the darkness and tell their stories. there is an excellent opening video in a different room when you first walk in that discusses the diaspora of all people out of africa. I really liked that because it really shows how much we all are the same and all the so - called differences are really silly. \n\nThe second floor I think has temporary exhibits. honestly it wasn't much there.  The third floor had a temp exhibit too about jewelry in north africa. that was pretty interesting \n\nThe staff were all very helpful. I must say that I was looking around thinking that i must have missed rooms and exhibits, but i didn't. it's very very small indeed and light on overall information. it would have been interesting to have a permanent exhibit about the \"diaspora\" of blacks that came to california and specifically san fran.  discuss their experiences. Provide information about Mary Ellen Pleasant (a free woman of color) who many thought was white due to her appearance but was of african ancestry  who amassed $30 Milliion Dollar estate, designed and built an enormous mansion in San Fran and a summer house near Napa, and how she fought for civil rights. She helped slaves on the underground railroad, and contributed to several abolotionist movements. She later changed her racial status from white to black after slavery was over but was always openly proud of her heritage amongst blacks and it was not a secret to them but due to the climate of the times, she had to \"pass\" as white to be able to amass her fortune. \n\nAnyway, I think it was a great museum but it really needs to take advantage of more of the local history and turned into something more robust.", "author": "Food C."}

The theme is really compelling: Africa being the origin of the human race, one of the museums goals is to trace the movement of people and culture out of Africa and around the world.  More specifically, it looks at movements and culture of slaves, refugees, emigrants, etc. around the world, as well as Africans in Africa.\n\nUnfortunately, the Museum is way, way too small to give you anything more than a select glimpse at these migrations and cultural transitions.  Worse still, much of what they do show you could be effectively reproduced in other media: radio, tv, and the web.  The Museum appears to be lacking in a permanent collection: archaelogical artifacts, cultural objects, art, etc.  It functions as much as a showroom of interactive museum display styles as it does a rich and interesting experience.\n\nGiven the small size of their space, their lack of collection, and their large ambitions, MOAD has clearly sought to expand their wallspace by using interactive multimedia exhibits.  Unfortunately, in doing so they forgot that when people pay $10 for a museum entry, they expect a robust and unique experience to rival the other museums of the city, whose entry fees vary from $10-12.50.\n\nI give them a second star for their theme, in hopes that someday they can grow into a museum worthy of their name.

I had to visit this place twice for a school project, and each time I was constantly bugged by the security guards and staff. They followed me everywhere and kept asking me where I was going. I was beginning to understand what it feels like to be wrongfully persecuted!\n\nI think the ideas behind the museum and its exhibits are great, but the execution could be greatly improved.", "author": "Jane R."}

Until, that is, we actually went in and learned that the slavery in history exhibit was really just a paltry excerpt from a traveling exhibit on slavery in NYC, a \"darkroom\" in which one listened to overly dramatic recitations of slave narratives, and some mediocre film shorts, including an truly DREADFUL film on Toussaint L'Ouverture.  I was muy appalled.  \n\nIn the interests of fully disclosure, I must note that we were told that the third floor was switching exhibits, so we only saw the second floor (the first is a gift shop).  Although they gave us half-off the admission price of $10, I still felt cheated.  The museum itself is a fabulous and essential idea, and I was very much wanting to love it, but -- sadly, enough -- there just wasn't much substance there.  :o(", "author": "Samantha R."}

Second floor:  slave narratives (which I think you can hear on the web), small interactive thing about food, screening room showing short documentaries, moving exhibit on amulets.  Third floor: exhibit of an Ethiopian artist.\n\nThe exhibit of the Ethiopian artist is fantastic.  The slave narratives were cool, but the room you sit in is awkward (weird light show, uncomfortable seats...  maybe it's intentional).\n\nThere was a part of the museum that was closed when we visited.  I can't remember what it was, but the woman that greeted us said that it was her favorite part.  \n\nIt's worth a few bucks ($5 for students and seniors and $10 for adults) and a few hours (ok, maybe 1 hour) to check it out.", "author": "S J."}

Snuggled up in an art \"snack\" of a museum. You'll get no art fatigue here due to its relative abbreviated square footage.\n\nFinally, I will always love MOAD, because my fiance and I went there right before we got engaged.

I found the layout to be an  interesting use of space as was the use of so much audio/video material. \nFor me, the video presentations moved very slowly--I could simultaneously watch two side by side and not miss a thing. Besides being slow moving they didn't have a great deal of depth, either, just glossing over subjects like African influences on music and food in this country. It seems like a great learning tool for the young, however.\n\nThe Hewitt Collection of African American painters was excellent, though. Earnest Crichlow in particular impressed me, and there was a wide variety of approach and subject matter. It's worth the price of admission.", "author": "Lance H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-10", "description": "Ok, I'll bite.  What is a diaspora?  It means, essentially, \"dispersion\".  So the African Diaspora refers to the dispersion of the human race from its original home in Africa, as well as more modern dispersions (eg, the slave trade).\n\nIn other words, this is *not* a museum of Africa.  I suppose you could call it a museum of anthropology, and particularly racial and cultural identity as viewed through an African lens.  Sound ambitious?  It is, and in many ways the museum is neither big enough nor sophisticated enough to pull it off without falling into feel-good/feel-bad humanitarian cliches or (as with the section on music, food, and fashion) outright pedestrianism worthy of a kids' museum.  The short films in the \"freedom theater\" are quite good, however (and one features a very prescient appearance by a certain future president).  Ultimately, the two temporary exhibitions outshone the rest of the place and were more to the point, especially \"Decoding Identity\", which hints at the tensions between past and present, individual and collective, ethnic solidarity and ethnic fluidity, all of which happen to be intersecting in a very critical way at this point in history (and especially in this country).  If only they would take that ball and run with it, this could be one of the most unique, relevant, and fascinating museums around.  But the trick, as always, will be in the execution.", "author": "Wes M."}

I first learned of this museum from a company event, in which we had the executive director come visit and speak more to African history.  Seeing as to how we also purchased a corporate membership, I went and checked this place out one lovely summer day. \n\nThe entrance is really cool, and has a face of a young girl, which is a collaboration of thousands of peoples' faces!  The pic is basically a representation tracing back to everyones' origins to Africa - it's the pic that is created if we had people of all ethnicities, colors, and nationalities mixed into one - cool, huh?\n\nThe museum has a really interesting and interactive exhibit on culinary traditions, slavery passages, and some desi (Indian) - African diasporic art from the Caribbean.  I also watched three films on Nelson Mandela and The End of Apartheid, Toussaint L'overture and the French Revolution, and another film on Thurgood Marshall.

This is a weird, small museum with an unclear concept and really bad layout.\n\nI was greeted warmly and told that the exhibit today is RIchard Mayhew. I could learn about Richard Mayhew on the 2nd floor and then see his artwork on the 3rd floor. Okay then. So I proceeded up the stairs, watched a very, very interesting movie in a painfully bright room about black native americans. The seats were badly arranged...all flat, so the people in the back row are out of luck (but that's normal for a museum). But weirdly, people kept walking through the room. Entering from the back, proceeding through an opening at the front. Weird. So I got up, wandered around the rest of the 2nd floor for about five minutes and saw a very strange mash-up of facts. A giant Kaiser Permanente poster about diet. A kiosk about creole music. A kiosk about clothing. I saw a man come out of another room. Some asked him \"so what was it?\" and the man said \"just an empty room with a soundtrack.\" I skipped it. I never did see anything abotu Mayhew on the 2nd floor...maybe that was it. So then I tried to go upstairs, and realized that to get there, I had to walk through the movie room I'd started with. Weird. Upstairs, the Mayhew art was beautiful, nicely displayed, tastefully lit. \n\nI don't know, if you're going to tackle such a big subject, maybe you need a bigger space.\n\nAs noted by another review, the gift shop is incredibly small. Smaller than the jewelry counter at the MOMA gift shop.\n\nAfterwards, I went to the Jewish Contemporary Museum. I'd advise you to go there instead.\n\nBy the way, I saw that they rent the facility, but unless you're just planning a meeting for 20 or fewer people, or a standing cocktail party for 40, that's not going to work. There's no large open space.", "author": "Karen Z."}

The new building is really nice inside and out, but actually pretty small. The permanent collection/2nd floor uses entirely video and audio recordings, rather than having objects on display. Everything was well done, but ultimately I felt like I could have gotten more out of it if I had all of it on a DVD or website at home - being there didn't really add anything and actually made it harder to pay attention. The visiting collection/3rd floor currently has a great selection of modern art. It's definitely worth a visit, and I'm interested to see how things evolve.", "author": "Amy E."}

I was hoping for quite a bit more with such an austere and powerful title.  The first floor gift shop was moderately interesting, but the overal presentations were entirely lackluster, and aside from a briefly intriguing exhibit on Ethiopian artwork when I was there in February, there wasn't much to go off on.  The idea of the African Diaspora as defined by thsi museum is so broad as to be basically meaningless; I can appreciazte what they're tryign to do, in terms of being inclusive to all potential visistors.

Yes, experiment. Most people don't really grasp the diaspora concept-- which I think is MoAD's greatest challenge. They are not only trying to bring the history, stories, and art of the recent movements out of Africa, but also trying to connect all people through the original African Diaspora. \n   MoAD has a long way to go still, but how many Museums in their third year have achieved such a beautiful building and taken on such a bold mission. NOTE: SFMOMA is 74 years old and began in someone's home.\n    If you really enjoy Museum's and watching something progress, this is your spot. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. You begin by getting an overview from the Visitor Services Manager and then you get to experience the amazing stairway mosaic. The mosaic is \"the signature piece of the Museum\". It is made up of over 2000 images sent from all over the world, and represents the African Diaspora. If you look closely, there are Africans, African Americans, and Caribbeans, but there are also folks from Asia and Europe and South America. This is the whole idea of this place. You look at the little details and see difference and separation, but when you stand back, it becomes one person-- one human race. \n   The changing exhibitions are good in that they key into the whole mission. I first experienced Hungry Planet, but didn't really like that one. Then, they featured an exhibition called Africa.dot.Com in 2007. That exhibition showed the transition from drum (earth) technology to digital technology all over Africa. It was great to see Africa represented in the current global era. This last summer and fall they had an amazing exhibition called Double Exposure, about African American representation through photography. It was amazing and a quiet little gem. Now, they have an exhibition called the Hewitt Collection, which was collected by a middleclass couple who actually knew most of the artists represented in the show: Elizabeth Catlett, Jacob Lawrence, Ernest Crichlow, etc. They even have a Henry Ossawa Tanner!!! It's awesome.\n   Support this Museum, it's awesome. The critics should do some more homework and not compare apples to oranges.", "author": "Demetri S."}

Granted, the MOAD is probably half the size of the Modern Museum of Art, but the large number of interactive exhibits gives this museum a \"cutting edge\" feel. The MOAD does an excellent job of blending African Roots and American branches.

Its mission, it says, is to connect all people through the art, culture and history of the African diaspora, to promote the universal connection of humankind to Africa and explore the impact that people of African descent have had on contemporary life the world over. \n\nThe wall alongside the staircase leading to the second-floor galleries is covered with a collage of black and white photos --- faces of the African diaspora. One of the first rooms you enter on the second floor projects films about celebrations, and features various people talking about life and its celebrations. \n\nThe next room has a series of interactive exhibits about dress, food and music. The music exhibit is fun, too: you can listen to and read about various types of music, from samba to hip hop. Next, there's a theater that plays different short films. And finally, there is the slavery passage gallery, a heartbreaking reminder of our nation's difficult past. It's a darkened room with a projector casting vague shadows on the wall. As you sit there, you hear the voices of escaped slaves telling stories of their experiences. \n\nThe third floor is the special exhibitions gallery. Through June 4, they are showing art of the contemporary African diaspora, featuring artists from all over Africa who work and live in Western countries. My favorite was \"Scramble for Africa\" by Yinka Shonbare. It is a striking exhibit, with 14 headless figures dressed in colorful robes sitting around a table. On the table is inscribed a map of Africa. The piece is intended to depict the Berlin Conference of 1884-85, where Africa was divided among five European countries.", "author": "Deb K."}

However, if I were a teacher bringing a class of 3rd or 6th graders, it might have been worth the effort.  This museum ins on the first floor of some tony hotel.

The current Kinsey collection show is very good. They've had some excellent and very unique shows over the years, several of which I've gone to see more than once. The staff have always been kind and helpful, not always the case in some of the larger museums in San Francisco. MoAD is very accommodating for those of us needing disability access, too. They do an excellent job of blending art and historical context. In this way, it is very worthwhile in gaining a more complete picture of American history. As the museum name suggests, they also highlight the work of people from many other parts of the world. The museum is small and needs more community support to grow. They don't have the funding base that museums like the deYoung have. Sometimes they've had problems such as the audio not working in the darkened room where one hears very moving, oral histories of people who were enslaved.

There were a lot of bright colors, video displays, and flashing lights, but little information or engaging exhibits. On the first floor, there was a gift shop and an LED map of the world. On the second floor, there were three rocks in a gigantic room, with notes that they are 2.5 million-year-old tools. Also was an \"interactive\" display where you could click on the names of food and find out how to grow, say, yams. The third floor was a lot of modern artwork that I hoped would comment on the modern experience of African descendants, but I didn't get a sense of this. I hope their \"real\" exhibit will open soon, or else they will condense the exhibits into less space and open up a design studio on one of the floors -- \"MoAD\" could be a good name for a studio that designs jeans or perhaps expensive plastic vases.", "author": "Ellie P."}

E.g.,  there's a lot of \"interactive\" museum, i.e.photographic and audio/video media, music, foods of the world on computer displays and big button video displays.  There's also a small theatre and screening areas which loop documentaries- let's hope they don't get in a rut.  The giant photographic collage draws you in, but up close they seem passive reproductions- maybe a lack of detailed history and the relevancy to \"diaspora\" is what leaves me longing.  The top floor with rotating Art also lacked a theme which directly related to \"diaspora.\"  I'm patiently waiting until the kinks are ironed out and more of an identity is shaped or infused into this place of great promise.", "author": "E L."}

The latter alone is worth a visit to the museum; and set aside at least an hour alone for it. There are two viewing rooms showing videos of the civil rights movements in the USA and South Africa. And a large listening room playing audio of similar content. In between is a small room where you can learn about the migration from Africa to the Americas of certain Afro-American food staples such as yams, beans and rice.
