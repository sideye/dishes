{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-06-09", "description": "This place was horrible. Do not eat here! Yesterday my family and I were in town and decided to go site seeing. After walking around forever, we decided to get food. When we stumbled upon this place, they were completely empty, which is always an indication the food is not good. By this point,  my parents were tired of walking and we felt like the children would enjoy pizza before anything else.\n\nWhile looking through the menu, we noticed the food was extremely high-priced. Honestly, with me being from TX, I thought maybe this was the norm for Cali and I would be a country bumpkin to complain about it. Nevertheless,  we ordered. I purchased the meatball sandwich which was about $12. The sauce was the worst sauce I've ever tasted and the meatballs were tough. It came with a bag of chips that consisted mostly of air and the only delicious part was the toasted bread it came on. I will admit though, it was large enough for 2 people, but all of my family passed on my offer to take the other part of the sandwich off my hands.\n\nMy daughters pizza was \"ok\". The sausage on it was horrible and left a bad aftertaste. The chicken wings my mom ordered were very salty and 1 wing came with a feather on it. I mean I know chickens have feathers, but how hard would it have been to pull the feather off, before presenting it to your customers?\n\nSo we finished what we could of the food. Our ticket came with everything on 1. We asked if they could separate it by person. We were told no and that they could have if we said something beforehand. So, what is the difference between doing that before or now? And our waitress went a step further, saying \"Can't you just have 1 person pay and everyone pay them back?\" Well clearly, we will have to. It's not as if you suggested something we aren't being forced to do anyway. My mom offered to bite the bullet, gave her card to pay about $161, which included \"gratitude\" as the waitress called it. AFTER they swiped my mom's card, they brought the receipt for her to sign, but this time we noticed there was another fee for about $5..which was a non-cash payment fee. Something I've never heard of...so you charge a fee for not using cash? Bonkers! My mom didn't argue b/c she just wanted out. As we're leaving, I noticed a lot more people were there and I'm assuming b/c they saw us, a large party, in there so this must be ok. Absolutely not! Worst place so far I've been to in San Fran.", "author": "C T."}

We walked by the slice place across the street & found it empty other than the Asian guy sweeping outside. So the Hubs thought it was too sketchy & opted for this place. There were a few people eating, a table of about 6 young college looking kids in the middle of the establishment who seemed to be enjoying the food. Walked up to the counter to order our small pizza. Was told it'd be about 15-20min. Ok, no prob. We sat down at an empty table and took in the view. And then we looked up Yelp. Uh-oh. 2 stars. Well, here's hoping. \n\nWhen I saw another pizza being brought to that table of youngsters, I felt more at ease. Surely it can't be THAT bad if they ordered more, right? That's when Hubs said, \"Or they might not care that much after drinking.\" Well, true dat. When our pizza finally came out, which was ~$20, we took one look at it & I knew....this is NOT gunna be good. As we walked out with our pizza in hand, we walked by the place across the street where a few people had since ordered & were eating their pizza. Naturally, I took a glance and said to Hubs, \"We should'a just went there.\"  The slices I saw looked waaaay more appetizing than the whole small pizza we were carrying back to our room. Dang it!\n\nWhen we got to the room & tried the pizza, sure enough, it wasn't good. It was barely ok. Toppings were minimal (we ordered pepperoni & Salami) & not evenly distributed among the slices, but worse, the crust was kinda doughy, especially in the middle. Hubs was all, \"I sometimes like it a little doughy.\" Yeah, but this was more than a little. \n\nI REALLY wanted Fisherman's Pizzeria to be good so I could redeem their name, but they just didn't even come close. Also, I think the doughy pizza might've even upset my tummy, cuz I was not ok the next morning. Boo!! Hopefully they'll get their act together. \n\nSo, if you're in the area & looking for some good pizza on the late night, go across the street.", "author": "Dionne T."}

We found this joint just by luck as my husband and son were hungry after doing half the day roaming around the city! We also wanted something that was spacious because we had a stroller with us! And this restaurant by far had alot of space and was not as busy as expected!\n\nWe ordered our food and my son wanted fish and chips and for some odd reason the waitress said they ran out! Hmm thats odd! The place didnt look busy and it was only 2:00 pm! And youre telling me you already ran out of fish and chips! As for my husband and I we ordered the small Fog city pizza to share which had 6 pieces. It consisted of shrimp, clams, onions, garlic, bell pepper! It looked appetizing but once you bite into it, to me it lacked some flavor, im not sure what though! My husband on the other hand liked it! We also ordered clam chowder which was good but I wish it was warmer to taste! I like my soup hot and this by far was more cold than hot! \n\nAs for the price well when youre in a tourist area and the Bay area at that everything is by far expensive. All in all we paid about $65 for just those 3 items! I wouldn't t have mind paying that amount if I actually liked the food! Moral of the story, don't look for a restaurant when you're re super hungry cause you'll end up eating something you didnt want to really eat in the first place! Waste of calories!

The lady taking our order was nice and pleasant, that's deserving of 2 stars.\n\nWe ordered the Mexican Special which consisted of: Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, Onions and Jalape\u00f1os (minus the onions).\n\nA group of strange drunk Asian guys walked in with a white girl and started asking the waitress for a bag.  She was confused and told them that they only use boxes for the pizzas, yet these guys are still so persistent on getting a bag.  They even asked if they could buy a garbage bag from her, which she said that she couldn't sell one to them.  They walk out and sends the white girl back in alone to ask for a bag again!  No idea what that was about.\n\nOf course, I'm sitting in this empty place with my kids and I tell the lady that I changed my mind and asked to have my order to go.  I wasn't about to take a risk with a bunch of drunks coming back and forth to harass the poor lady & possibly cause a scene.  So, we paid and head back to our car and told her we'd be back to pick up our pizza in about 20 minutes.\n\nAt more than $30 for a medium, I expected a semi-decent pizza.  I wasn't asking for gourmet or even good, just good enough.  However, it was edible to say the least, just lacking in flavor of any sort.  I couldn't even tell that there was any marinara sauce in my pizza slice and I don't even care for marinara.\n\nI guess this place is able to stay in business because suckers like me end up hungry and desperate at the wrong place, at the wrong time...", "author": "Sivilay T."}

Of course, we asked for parmesan to spread all over BUT, to my surprise, I noticed a blackish/greenish area inside the parmesan bottle. My fiancee at this time had happily sprinkled a ton of it on our pizza. When I took the top off and took a closer look, it was MOLD. Nasty MOLD in the parmesan bottle. Of course we nicely told the waitress and she apologized and made us a new pizza. She also brought us a new batch of parmesan and stated \"Oh Im sorry. The person who closed last night forgot to put the bottle in the refrigerator\". So with hesitation, we ate the pizza which was average at best.

We ordered a Pizza, Jalapeno poppers and fries. I asked her for extra ranch and she poured maybe 5 ML of extra ranch into the soda cup and walked away. We shook it off and proceeded to our hotel to enjoy our overpriced dinner. Upon getting to the room we notice Anne screwed up our order and gave us wings instead. So we headed back to let Miss Rude Anne know about her incompetence.  She then wanted to argue and claim that we never said Jalapeno poppers and we told her chicken, We never ever said chicken clearly the owner of this establishment needs to educate his employees with Rosetta Stone. She still wanted to argue but threw the poppers in the fryer anyway. After that she ignored us completely. She plopped the poppers in a togo box and handed it to us. Then she told us she was going to  to the back to go get ranch. Funny how the ranch came from the front when we originally were in so she must have been trying to give us her \"special ranch\" We decided we didn't want Annes ranch from the back, so we left.

I guess the SF homeless problem just gets worse every year.  \n\nI can only imagine how difficult it would be in the evenings with all the co-eds stumbling in drunk from the bar across the street.

The fish was slimey and some of it was raw. \n\nFinally my burger comes out, and at first look, the bun seemed moldy to me, but the waitress assured it was rembrants from the grill (which is still gross) so I sent it back...took another 15 minutes to get another burger. Took a few bites and it was very obvious that this was not only a frozen beef patty, but it was also not seasoned what-so-ever. I was so hungry, I just had to take a couple more bites, but left most of it behind and eat all my fries (which I could get at safeway and pop them in the oven). \n\nMy friend did them same, eating his fries, and leaving the fish. \n\nIt's sad that this is in such a prime tourist location. I hope tourists don't use this place as their first impression of food in SF.", "author": "Alex M."}

Overpriced but it is a tourist trap area so I get it. At least it wasn't crowded and the food was OK. No crazy waitresses today that we saw. To the person who complained about too much ice in their glass of \"cock\", I'd say you should be thankful it wasn't filled with \"cock\". I'd much rather have ice myself but it's a free country. Is there better pizza for the same price or less, of course. But if it's close and not total garbage, that's par for the course around Pier 39.  One major gripe with all the restaurants in this area is this. No freaking bathrooms? You have to go outside with a code to use them. The custodial staff were a pair of dicks (or \"cocks\".

It's just bad. The crust is bland and unremarkable. The dough is probably frozen. The toppings, pepperoni, onion, bell peppers, are all cooked to different consistencies, which means that the cheese base and components were probably precooked separately hours ago and then assembled. My husband said it tastes like the pizza you get at amusement parks. You're better off buying a Red Baron pizza and staying home.", "author": "A. M."}

Those words sold me.  Well, not really.  It was actually a few feet away from my hotel room and I was letting my laziness dictate where to dine.  The attentive waitress handed me their menu and after a brief perusal, I ventured for their $20.90 small \"Vegetarian Deluxe\" pizza and ordered a glass of Anchor Steam beer.  \n\nAs pizzas tend to normally take some time to prepare and heat, I wandered around for their restroom to wash up.  Upon seeing my bumbling, confuzzling and desperate look for a restroom, the waitress approached me and said they have no public restrooms.   I trekked back to my hotel room to wash up and promptly returned to the waiting game.  After seating myself, she presented me the \"glass\" of beer I ordered.  The Anchor Steam tasted great, but it was disappointingly held in a warm cheap flimsy plastic beer \"glass\".  As part of this waiting game: I stared at the flat screen TVs, played with my phone, people watched, zoned out looking at my table and occasionally sipped on my beer to pass the time.  \n\nI noticed my beer was half filled when my Vegetarian Deluxe pizza arrived.  Vegetarian, it is.  Deluxe, it ain't.  The toppings were pitiful as the toppings were half cooked or not even cooked at all.   I see bits of mushrooms, but it was sparingly used. The only thing good to say is their crust.  It's surprisingly good.  Nonetheless, it's not worth $20.90 and participating in the wait-a-thon.

This time a few of us walked the streets in the Ghiradelli area looking for a place to eat at 11pm on a Wed. This pizza place was the only thing open other than In-N-Out. \n\nLarge pie with pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms and onions. GOOD. A little soggy in the middle, but after a few minutes the oils soaked up and it wasn't too soggy. \n\nService was whatever, but maybe it was because it was so late and they were gonna close up. Either way, this is going on my list of neighborhood places to grab a bite, late night.", "author": "Jen D."}

Good ingredients, fresh taste.\n\nBut here's why I'm giving it a 1:\n\n* Sells \"coke\" in the menu. It's not - it's RC Cola and they charge for refills.\n* Over 10 minutes to process a credit card payment.\n* Waitresses are cooks too. I watched them handle money, then handle food directly. No hand washing.\n* Observed waitress blowing her nose, and then handling food. No hand washing.\n* Observed cook touching customer's food, licking his finger, then touching the food again (cutting a pizza.)\n* Service is really really... really... slow.\n\nSo, if you can get over the ick factor of those issues, give the pizza a try.", "author": "Kale R."}

They were playing the Duck's game (BOOO!!!) and they were in OT, so I asked a patron and they said that they'd play the Sharks after. I ran up to my hotel room to shower and came running back! The game wasn't on so I asked if they could turn it on. Everyone was super friendly and really helpful! Sadly DirectTV was being a butt and the game wouldn't play. But I was really moved with their sympathy! I ordered the Hot Fisherman's Special Sandwich with no tomatoes and onions. My food didn't take long to make and trust me, it didn't take long for me to devour this baby up! I was so stuffed that I couldn't even eat the bag of chips it came with. I wish I knew they vouched for the parking garage next door because I parked across the street! Boo me! It was a great night with great food and a great game!

The pizzas here tastes great. You must eat it fresh right when they bring it out the oven and right after they cut it or else it will get soggy. The cheese is all melted and when you take a bite and pull the slice away, the cheese wll be stringy.  The crust taste great too. Sauce isn't too saucy. Fresh tasting ingredients. All in all, GREAT pizza. Service usually depends on who you get. Bathrooms are kinda far. I honestly think this place has the best pizza in S.F.

By far the worst pizza place I've been to of all time!!! The service, well lets just say they did the minimum they needed to do, I'll just leave it at that.  The place wasn't very clean looking at all, the only reason we stopped here cause we were starving and my kids had to have pizza.  Well the pizza was horrid, the crust was krispy, for the first 5 minutes, then completely soggy.  I'm pretty sure the pizza sauce was either powdered tomato with water or just a regular can of tomato sauce, because it had to flavor what so ever and it was literally watered down and that just killed it for me!

We asked for a quarter of it to be pepperoni for our son and they said sure.  The pizza was under cooked and most of it was pepperoni on it. The server asked if it was okay and said they could remake it which we agreed to that. The server talked to the cook who was watching football at the time since we were the only people in there at noon.  He argued with the server  loudly about how he wasn't going to do it.  We decided to leave and pay for drinks.  We make a remark about why we were leaving and the cook just arged and when I made a comment the gentleman rudely told me that he was talking to my husband and he wouldn't look at me and from his comment and his mannerism it was telling he wouldn't because I was a female.  Never been so insulted by a anyone.  He didn't care and funny thing is they didn't care that they were empty at noon on a busy weekend.

The trash was overflowing and food all over the floor and they were all playfully arguing over who was going to have to dump it.  The pizza was so greasy we had to blot it like 10 times in order to eat it.  When we asked for a to-go box, she brought a clear plastic container that looked like it had spit in it.  The 2 waitresses and the cook were laughing and joking around and never once even after I raised my hand finally for service did they even acknowledge us.  It was unbelievable.
