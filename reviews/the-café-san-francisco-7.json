Excuse yall, but this is the most poppin place in Castro, and probably the city. This is my go to dance spot just because it's always a good n wild time.\n\nMy friends and I can always count on The Cafe to come in clutch and provide for some crazy stories and a lit SnapChat story. Seriously, people have reached out to figure out where we be bc it looks like so much fun. I think Saturdays are the best nights to go because the hostess has the mostest. She is so wild, omg, always calling people out and having people dance on the little stage. I once witnessed an impromptu twerk competition, which was so great because the people that come here can DAAAANCE. Aside from that, they usually have professional buff dancers shaking what their mama gave em. So please tip em! The music ranges anywhere from hip hop to rnb to pop, from old to new.\n\nThe drinks are okay. Prices aren't that bad, but it is cash only so girl please stop at the BoA ATM before stepping in here.

While I think it's functional - I don't care for it at all. Too narrow and not the best for people who aren't standing right next to the rail. \n\nThis venue gets packed out regularly so a tip would be get there early to get a good spot by the stage and to avoid long lines at the bar. Speaking of which, BRING CASH. The bars only accept cash unfortunately. \n\nI was here for the All Stars Reunion and did the VIP package which includes a meet and greet with all three girls. \n\nI didn't know the set up was like a professional photo shoot since most meet and greets at clubs consist of taking pictures with your phone in bad lighting. So this was a nice touch. You just have to wait to them to post your pictures on their Facebook the next day. The professional camera and lighting was a nice touch. \n\nMixed drinks run around 9-12 dollars it seems and bartenders are not very friendly but do their job well. \n\nOverall, this is a big venue. However, I'm not a big fan of the set up and most likely won't return unless it's for a special occasion and a favorite queen of mine is booked here.

One of the most popular nightlife spots here because of the multiple bars and multiple places to dance. Large in square footage, and larger in life when it comes to bumping butts with the Castro regulars and the beats of the DJ.\n\nThere are platforms everywhere with men dancing in next to nothing for atmospheric purposes. Barmen walking around with shots of sweet and sour who-knows-what-just-drink-it making life easier when you're in the middle of the dance floor, want a drink, but have not want to swerve through the masses to the bar. Convenience at it's finest.\n\nThere is a coat check - because everyone ends up naked somehow at the end of the night, and an ATM since the bars are CASH ONLY. An extremely accommodating place to function. Oh, also, yes, cover on the popular nights, but well worth the $5-$10.\n\nGo to Castro, go to Cafe, grab a pizza after, and turn up at home.

The club is rather decent in size but the layout can be confusing.  once you ascend those stairs you're not quite sure which way to go.  If you head straight you'll hit a bar and eventually the bathrooms while passing a smoking area on your right.  What you left behind you was another bar and a larger smoking area. It seems as if this bar has missed the fact that we're in California.  Granted people smoke, I get it.  I guess I just don't want to fill my lungs with harsher stuff that I'm filling my stomach with.  regardless your liver will be working double time at this place.  So will your heart.

Later I came back to the same hipster working the smallest bar and he asked me for a third completely different price.

TELL ME!\" I was shocked and told him that I do not appreciate his tone nor his language. He proceeded to not give me our drinks (my third one of the night) as well. I pulled out my phone to take a pic of him and he rushed for it, grabbing my arm with an iron deathly grip. I barely wrenched free by dropping my weight down below the bar. Then I proceeded to splash him with the water that I had asked for earlier to make sure he wouldn't try to attack me again...\n\nThe man apparently told security that I had thrown my drink at him but I had the empty cup in my hand when they escorted me out, and i went calmly. I reported him to one of the security guards and have been trying to reach the business unsuccessfully for a week almost. Therefore I am forced to take it to Yelp. \n\nfor the record...

The go-go boys were also very hot, not your starved-skinny twinks which makes me want to throw cake, not dollar bills at the boys. \n\nWhat I did not like: the doorman persuaded my bf and I to pay a VIP price to get half price drinks, faster drinks and a photo-op with a drag queen named Willam from RuPaul's Drag Race. SO NOT WORTH IT. Most of the bartenders were incredibly bitchy about the fact that we were to be paying half price, several telling us to go to a different bar. We did NOT get drinks any faster than anyone else. The photo-op was more lame than I could imagine; again the queen herself and the other folks managing it seemed beleaguered to have to deal with us.

It's a hard job but someone's gotta do it.\n\nThe place was PACKED.  We ran into other people from school!!  And I went to school in Philadelphia.  Drinks were strong.  The men were topless.  Music was bumpin'.  A good night was had by all.\n\nMy friends all took their shirts off and next thing I knew, I was topless too (with a bra).  No one cared about me though.  The thing with gay bars is that no one, absolutely no one, gives a shit about me, and that's a new experience.  I felt like a hanger steak at a vegan convention.  It's fun for dancing (if you can move without getting elbowed in the ear by someone else), and a few of the go go dancers were cute but all were really short.  They looked great on stage though.  I saw a guy who dances at The Abbey in W Hollywood just chillin here with his new boyfriend (he was not short).  I can't believe I still recognized him with his clothes on!  \n\nIt's been a while since I was at a club this packed.  There was hardly a place to stand without getting trampled by stampedes of men.  Men flirting, checking each other out, drunk men, sober men, high men, giggling, hugging, grinding, sweating, squeezing past one another to the next best thing.  \n\nThe worst was the bathroom.  Pretty much everyone used both the men and women's room interchangeably and there was NO WATER at the sink in the ladies' room.  Can you imagine how nasty that is?  No TP, no water, and the one faucet that was working earlier spurted scalding hot water that almost cooked me.  I remember peeing and not having any TP, and wiping the pee off my puswanee with my HANDS, and then discovering that there was NO FUCKING WATER.  What is this?  Rural India?  I ran into the men's room with my pee stained hands flopping in front and used their only running scalding spout, yelping with equal parts pain and relief the whole time.  Fix the situation please!  It's gotta be a serious health code violation of some sort.

A group of us were visiting for the weekender and to catch up with some friends who had moved there.\n\nThe two nights were fun, but for different reasons...\n\nNow...coming from LA and being a bit of a weho-ho, I had some elevated expectations for the castro district nightlife. Friday night was much more my kind of crowd in that there was a fair amount of hottie boys to ogle over...even thought it was a look, but don't touch kind of thing. I don't mind. The boys here are definitely a bit different from in LA, though... While LA is much more pretty-boy/wannabe actor kind of thing, the guys here are much more diverse. There's old and young, of all different ethnicities. The music was fantastic Friday night and we danced our butts off the whole time. Drinks were ridiculously affordable (though the cash only made me MUCH more aware of how much I was spending). Cover was $5, but with the inexpensive drinks, I think it evened out.\n\nSaturday night was.......interesting. If I had experienced the Saturday night crowd on Friday, I'm not sure I would have come back. I guess it was latino/latina night Saturday night and it was a much different crowd. There was salsa dance music and drag queens singing some kind of ballad...a little odd to me. The redeeming factor of the night was meeting my friend's cousin, who was a gogo dancer. Beautiful. I felt like I had my very own Magic Mike moment when he came down to dance with me. *swoon* Literally didn't know what to do with myself because I'm such a prude and he was so much sex in a highlighter pink speedo.\n\nI'd definitely come back on a Friday night, but Saturday ....maybe not so much...unless Paul will be there agian. ;)", "author": "Lilli I."}

Aside from that, though, it was a pretty decent night. \n\nWe got there a little early, around 10:30pm, so it was a little slow, but they had $5 tequila shot specials, so hey, why not? Things livened up a bit as the night went on, and by midnight, the place was pretty packed. The music also got much better throughout the night  - mostly top 40s, hip hop, old school pop and hip hop, with occasional EDM. (I loved everything but the EDM.) There were also some very scantily clad dancers on stage, if you're into that sort of thing, haha. \n\nOther random tidbits: the $5 cover is better than most places, so whatever. The test tube drinks servers bring around are pretty good, and they're topped off with some whipped cream, so if you like sweet things, definitely try it at least once! The bathrooms were in good shape, which is always appreciated! And no problem with the bouncers, fighting breaking out, etc.\n\nAll in all, we had a good time, but will probably explore other venues next time we're in the Castro.

Then, I kept walking past on ladies' night and since that's not my bag, didn't want it to be my maiden voyage (pun intended) to the new, supposedly improved, Caf\u00e9.\n\nSo last night, with my entourage in tow, we went to check it out for the first time. First impressions; it's not THAT different, really. Sure, the bathrooms became a coat-check room, so that narrow little hallway is no longer a bathroom line. Good call, that. The look is newer, shinier, more LA. The new backroom loungy area was blocked off, supposedly for the guest DJ's, which I thought sort of defeated the purpose of having it. Especially bothersome since I tend to migrate toward \"loungy areas\" and that was where I would have liked to have been.\n\nSecondly... no gogos on a Saturday night. I know, I know, they're there on Fridays. But why have a gogo stage if there are no gogo boys? There were ticket-sellers to some event, not eye candy, front and center on the stage.\n\nThe crowd. Mixed. Old and young. Men and women. So-so.\n\nSo overall, first impressions were just okay. Nicer look, better layout, same crowd, same drinks, no dancers, and the best area blocked off.

No creepy dudes trying to grab girls and no nasty pick up lines to be heard.\n\nThe drinks are very reasonable! and they are very generous with vodka. The test tube shots were yummy; especially the watermelon ones.", "author": "Monica H."}

We came here on a Saturday night and coverage was only $5. They allow in & out privileges so u can go out to the gas station literally 5 ft away to buy cigs rather than the $8 pack at the vending machine inside the club. There's an area to smoke inside with a balcony that looks out onto the dance floor. The staff was great, someone was always cleaning up. There's also a lifted stage in the middle of the dance floor where they have the dancers. Once they go on break anyone can go up and dance, but no drinks allowed. \n\nI will definately come back here :)", "author": "Sophia T."}

The Cafe then did what most celebrities do- it underwent  massive amounts of cosmetic surgery to stay in the game.\n\nI'm totally not hating.  I would have done the same thing.  And, now the Cafe looks incredible.  It's now modern and chic with beautiful, clear, urban inspired touches and subtle, fluorescent lighting.  They've even extended the ceilings to create a dramatic loft feel in some of the rooms, and added a lounge area (complete with black leather couches) in the back past the newly renovated bathrooms.  \n\nIt seems like the only thing that is missing are some Philippe Starck chairs and chandeliers.", "author": "Jacquie L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-08-10", "description": "The French have a saying: \"You can't polish a turd.\"\n\nAs we all know, the French - on top of being largely uncircumcised and connoisseurs of hard bread and French alternative rock - have a way with words.  Real lexicographers, those French folk.  Can't build a reliable car or write a linear narrative, but when it comes to the witty put-down, they're world-class.\n\nWait, what was I talking about? \n \nOh, yeah, turd polishing.\n\nAnywho, anyone who has tried to polish a turd will know that it can't be done - a turd is a turd.  And so it is with the newly-renovated Caf\u00e9.  They've spent a lot of time and a little money fixing up the place - and to a certain extent it's paid off.  The d\u00e9cor has more of that white-plastic iPod sleekness that's so popular with the kids these days.  The lighting scheme is better and they've really opened up the bar and dance floor.  Drinks are cheap (for the Castro) and don't peel the enamel off your teeth like the drinks at some other bars.\n\nBut, as the French also say, a tiger can't change his stripes.  With all that effort to class up the place, they still play the same, tired 92.7 \"dance\" music (Joey V from 92.7 was the DJ the night we were there, which helps explain it).  They also have tacky soft-core porn playing on TVs throughout the bar.  Really?  Soft-core porn?  We're still doing that?  \n\nThe French have one last saying (yes, they only have three): \"to each his own.\"  And in that vein I probably should leave the clientele alone.  But this is a review and you didn't read this far only to have me leave out one major component.  So, with apologies to the French, I give you my take on the crowd at the Caf\u00e9....\n\nThe Caf\u00e9 has a following - people who have been coming back week after week for years.  There's the sweaty guy in the K hole flailing about with his arms over his head, completely oblivious to any \"beat.\"  There are the guys who live their Sunday through Thursday lives for those four hours on Friday when they can take their shirts off on the dance floor.  And then, of course, there are the guys who live to get out on that floor, feel that beat ...and fart up a storm.  I don't know why, but the Caf\u00e9 dance floor always smells like a Rhino is buried under the floor boards.  \n\nI don't know where these people went when the bar shut down for renovations, but they're back on the Caf\u00e9 dance floor like it was never closed.  And, come to think of it, it felt that way to me, too.  Same bad music, same tacky porn, new, slightly better d\u00e9cor.  Sorry, Caf\u00e9, but the Castro now has better options.", "author": "Richard T."}

They also host a lesbian t-dance once a month.  \n\nCons:\n- cash-only bar (Trigger and the Lookout both take credit cards)\n- $5 cover, which is okay I guess\n- The transgendered woman at the door that checks ID's ALWAYS has a scowl on her face and looks like she would rather be anywhere in the world than there.  I mean really, get another job if you hate people so much.\n- DJ, he plays the SAME music every weekend and if you are there for a few hours in one night, you will most likely hear the same song two or three times.  It is sooo redundant .  I think he just has a cd that he plays every time. \n- Several hot messes in this place.  Trigger is VERY good about kicking out people that are too drunk or disruptive, Cafe doesn't handle this at all, therefore you will have drunk fools spilling drinks on you at some point.\n- They just did away with the smoking part of the bar which sucks.  They used to have an outside balcony which they also dont open anymore.\n\nPros:\n- three bars\n- bathrooms are pretty clean and maintained regularly\n- the gay boys here are soooo nice\n- lots of space and even places to sit\n- you always know what you'll get here\n\nIf you have never gone, check it out.", "author": "Sofia G."}

It was ridiculous but I was so curious so we gave it a try. We walked in and immediately I saw the difference. It had been renovated and looked MUCH MUCH better. The crowd was different, and the worst of all the bartenders I once had grown to love were no longer there. After that, I gave it a couple more tries and wasn't impressed.

The club was very nice, people were very good at the front, the music is awesome, the crowd is not too bad with the high ego. However! I had the worst experience in my life with this african-american bartender who I asked for a Mango Martini. He gave me pure pour of absolut mandarin, shake it, and threw in a cherry. My friend and I paid for our drinks and gave him good tip.\n\nThe freaking drink has no flavor AT ALL, just alcohol bitterness. I asked him to put something into it to make it sweeter or something to give me some life for my drink please (I am not those types that makes a fuss unless I tragically am desperate, my gesture of request means I need it). He threw in some flavoring for 5 seconds, then he threw me back the drink somewhat unhappy. Again, that drink was just flavored with slight triple sec and it was still the same with just some nice aroma and rough taste. I couldn't stand it, I just asked him I rather have just normal Coke instead because the drinks are horrible for me to even go further. He got annoyed, told me that this is how he makes his martini just pure from the bottle, he took my drink and threw it away and wouldn't even help me out the rest of the night. Seriously? Is this the best bar in town people hyped about in San Francisco? I'm sure the rest of the place is nice, but with this kind of experience, I have to say I do take it personally, especially when they just threw the drink I paid for away like that.", "author": "Oak M."}

Cheap covers and cheap drinks meant for an always entertaining night.  And while the decor may have changed to what one reviewer aptly described as an airport bathroom, The Cafe still, really, is a good place to go dancing and drink to make people more interesting (or attractive).\n\nThe cover is $5 and the drink prices are average, but hey... they put tvs all around and the go-go boys are actually attractive.  What's not to like?  The format of the music is trending towards Badlands with an ever increasing number of remixed pop songs.  But the dance floor is usually going strong so its all good.\n\nThere are two bars at The Cafe, one main bar by the dance floor which is usually packed and a underutilized second bar up the small stairs in the direction of the bathrooms.  If you're in a hurry to grab a drink, make the trek to this second bar for faster service.\n\nOverall, i'm a fan of the new Cafe.  Airport fabulousness or not, it still is a club that you can enjoy meeting up with friends, drink, and remind yourself why \"recession\" only applies to non-alcoholic beverages.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-23", "description": "I've been a loyal Cafe customer for many years -- starting back in the '80s when it was the Cafe San Marcos, a mostly lesbian bar with carpeting, couches, and a fireplace where the dance floor now is. I spent New Year's Eve 1989 there with my then-boyfriend. I came back a handful of times in the '90s after it was renovated and turned into a dance club.\n\nAfter many years of absence, I returned in June 2006 for the premiere of Boy Bar (Gus Presents' Friday night club). I loved Boy Bar and immediately became a regular. I would go at 9:00 and pay the cover to get my hand stamped, and then return later when it was busier (but I wouldn't have to wait in line since I already paid the cover). Eventually I started going earlier and earlier, to the point where I wasn't paying cover because I got there before 9:00.\n\nWhen I met new best friends on a cruise in late 2006, The Cafe became our after-work happy hour spot. We'd sit on the balcony watching people go by on the street, or watching patrons playing pool. We eventually became friends with the pool team and other regulars.\n\nBefore the remodel, I would pop in anywhere from 5 to7 nights a week. Every day has a different vibe and feel, and draws a somewhat different crowd to supplement the regulars.\n\nAs for the remodel? I love it. I especially love how they've moved the bars and opened things up to increase floor space and improve sight-lines. The bathrooms are amazing! Instead of a shared room with one stall and a trough, there are now separate men's and women's rooms with dramatically increased capacity. I love the sliding glass panels for the smoking atrium that won't be subject to ripping in high winds like the poor old canvass ones before. Right now they are still closed on Mondays and Tuesdays until the final finishing touches are done, but I hear rumors that they'll be back to a 7 day schedule after Labor Day. \n\nI do have two small recommendations (nothing worth knocking off a star). First, a tiny splash of accent color inside (like the dark blue they use for some of the tiles in the smoking area) might be nice. But what do I know, I'm not a designer. And also, most importantly, some portable seating in the smoking area, balcony, and inside. It's hard to sit and chat with friends when the seating in the smoking area is a long bench.

I get all sorts of guest so im constantly trying to find great places to send my guests. I have been to The Cafe many times and before renovations it was absolutely my favorite place. It seems that with the new renovations quality of service has sufferered. I went there last friday and was punched by a girl who was pushing through a crowd. She admitted that she had been there drinking for the past 7 hours which I cannot believe a bartender would serve a person drinks for 7 hours. Isnt that illegal or something?I reported it to security and they handled as if I was overreacting and that they werent trained on how to handle such a situation. I hadnt had a drink the whole night and was smart enough not to hit her back. I have a lot of aspirations and to be thrown in jail is the last thing I needed. I also dont want top be 86 from a place that I often frequent. Friends that work security at Trigger, Qbar,and Badlands tell me that they 86 people for throwing drinks.\n\nMy main complaint is a few days later I returned to the Cafe and there she was again. This is unbelievable that a girl can show so much disrespect for a business/person and still be allowed back in. The bartender even admitted to me that she knew the girl because she goes there all the time. \n\nAfter what happened at Ruby Skye I can no longer send any guests to a potentially dangerous place. I myself will never set foot in this establishment for fear of my life.", "author": "Gina S."}

I never felt out of place, and had a couple favorite employees to get drinks from (one of the guys would make the most delicious, spicy Chile Verde shooters). \n\nSo the new Cafe is what I can best describe as \"glossy\". I do really like the LED ceiling which reminds me of that one Justin Timberlake video. \nSince the club is keeping a more upscale \"classy\" theme, there are still those plastic shooters that you can buy, but it is no longer kosher to throw them down and stomp on them. The clientele is more Badlands than Midnight Sun now. Last time I was there a girl was throwing up in the sink in the bathroom and then went back out to live it up some more, gross! Also, coat check was $3! Yes I know they have to pay for the renovation somehow, but whatever.\n\nSo yeah, the Cafe is alright, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. It's not horrible, just not as relaxed and as fun as before. I'm sad that it's not the same, but nothing can stay static forever, especially bars and clubs.

I told them I'd be over right away to pick it up!  I told them I lived 4 blocks away, when in reality I lived more like 15 (so they would be more inclined to wait) so I had to run like dickens.  And let me tell you, running (still buzzed) through the streets of SF at 4am, is a totally crazy workout.  Well, the really amazing thing is that not only did they wait for me in the parking lot of the nearby gas station while I sprinted to them, but they even gave me a ride home.

And there are lounging areas where you can sit if you don't wanna dance. There is an indoor smoking area which I love and there is always staff picking and tidying up the place. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because their website isn't up to par, it should get updated more often with previews to events they are gonna have and should be able to offer guest list (but since it's only 5 can't really beat the price). If there is half a star it would be 4 1/2 but ya. Go to The Cafe. Regardless if you are gay or straight you definitely feel comfortable there!!!!!", "author": "Francesca T."}

It's good to go out to happy hour with friends.  GoGo boys are a little awkwardly placed on the little platform, but more dignified than holding one hand up on the ceiling at the old Cafe.", "author": "Nick G."}

AND they even went through the trouble to help protect the rails when the dancers are dancing on the tables. Ok so yeah not dancing on the tables would be wonderful to all that go to really play pool, but hey we can all play in the sand box together.", "author": "lori t."}

Although the client\u00e8le has changed a bit, there is still a bit of the old cafe crowd around. The drinks are a bit pricey, but after an expensive remodel I guess you can expect that. If you want a good time with good music and you don't do badlands, this is the best place for you! :)", "author": "Tyler D."}

It looked like it needed much more work than just the few more days before Pride.  I won't be here as I usually go to Toronto instead, but, hey, if it opens in time, right on!", "author": "Tom D."}

Doorman super rude and think because there is a line they are God. Bartenders dunno they drinks and music sucks big time. Just go somewhere they value your business, Trigger is just accros the street and you always will get a \"good evening\" from the doorman. That's costumer service... Something that the cafe has always failed to provide!", "author": "Luis G."}

The Cafe's renovation is beautiful and the vibe is always welcoming.  It's also not as crowded as the other bars, there's actually space to dance and chill out. I wish they would bring back hip-hop on Monday nights! Hands down the best spot in Castro!! Buy me a drink if ya see me! ;-)", "author": "Kan P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-14", "description": "I have been to The Cafe several times now, before and after the renovation. I love the new renovation they did! The ceiling lights are the topper. It's fun to have go-go dancers too. Ok here's the deal though, you will inhale smoke. It's inevitable as you traverse through the crowd and the dance floor because of the indoor smoking area. Great if you're a smoker, sucktastic if you're not. Just try to steer clear of being near that area. Secondly, do not go early! I've gone early a few times (before or around 11pm). Don't do it! You will run into the before 11pm crowd and believe me, it's not pretty... literally and figuratively speaking. The funner, more outgoing crowd shows up from 11:30pm on, that's when I now show up. The crowd is fun, the DJ is good (you will pretty much hear all the radio songs but at least they're good radio songs you can dance too!), the go-go's are some good eye candy, and the dance floor is always full. Saturday night is the night! Check it out. It's worth your time. Who knows, ya might see me there. :)", "author": "Shannon S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-03-07", "description": "This renovation took out the soul of the Cafe. Yeah, things change, places need updating...but the old Cafe was cozy, with its perch atop the stairs for crowd watching, the quieter patio and balcony for smoking (but really for socializing), and the darker colors. In their effort to open up the danceable space, they  wrecked the crowd flow and hangout spots, and they used a terribly sterile decor. It feels hollow and lifeless. The patio is now saturated with smoke (the vents don't cut it); the balcony now no longer opens on to the street. Change isn't always good, sad to say. This was not an artful redesign.", "author": "John L."}
