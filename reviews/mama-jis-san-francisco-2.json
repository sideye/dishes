The turnip cake was pretty good, the fish itself was good but way too spicy. And the chicken/eggplant dish was decent, what you would expect from a Panda Express.\n\nAnd maybe this place is good for the Castro.

Because it was later in the evening, the restaurant was not too busy and we received pretty good service throughout our meal. The ambiance isn't too great and I did not look too closely, but I got the feeling that everything was dirty? I don't know? It just didn't feel clean in there.\n\nTHE FOOD: overall, pretty good! We ordered shanghai dumplings, potstickers and the cucumber salad as appetizers. Before I say this remember that I am a dumpling snob: the dumplings were not that great. They were extremely soppy/soggy at the bottom. Don't get me wrong, they had great flavor, but they weren't my favorite. The cucumber salad was great, as were the dumplings. We then ordered the combo fried rice, fried chicken and green beans, beef and green beans and sweet and sour pork. Everything tasted good and the portion sizes were pretty good. I personally thought the dried chicken and green beans were the best, but everyone thought their respective dish was the best and I'd say that's a good sign. All of the plates had good flavor! \n\nOverall, I think the food was good and I would come back, but maybe I wouldn't order the Shanghai dumplings again. I would be open to trying some of the other dumplings on their menu - maybe they are better!", "author": "Bri T."}

There were only two of us, so we got the last open table. It was pretty busy, but the staff was attentive and gracious. \n\nWe ordered only from the dim sum menu. It was pretty good, although we agreed the pot stickers needed more flavor. I think the prices are a little higher than average for dim sum. We waited quite a while for the last item (pork & shrimp shu mai), but the others came out at a steady pace. \n\nThere is only one bathroom.

Mama Ji's wing's probably make it into my top 5 in the city. Other than the wings, another dish I'd recommend (surprisingly actually) is the fried rice. I normally don't order fried rice at Chinese restaurant because it seems like such a average filler dish but the fried rice here was done really well. Good fried rice is where every grain of rice has been coated with a tiny bit of oil and has had the chance to toast in the wok its cooking in. Mama Ji's nailed it in this regard.\n\nI'd definitely come back if I'm in the area looking for good Chinese food!", "author": "Austin W."}

If you come for dinner on a hot day, try to grab a table out front. 18th St can get a bit loud, but it's still a nice place to sit with a bowl of hot and sour soup while the evening cools you off.\n\nFair warning to beer drinkers: if you insist on Tsingtao or Asahi to compliment your dumplings, you're out of luck, as they only serve Belgian brews here.

We arrived on a Friday evening over Labor Day weekend and were seated immediately. The restaurant is quite small but charming and we were seated at the window which I loved. We ordered dumplings, sweet and sour soup, noodles, and quite a bit more. It was all delicious, fresh, and filling. The price was reasonable and the service was excellent.

The big decision of the day for me was naturally where to eat!  A few restaurant names were thrown at us from our local friend.  Our only restrictions were that it had to be close to our hotel, and we needed to be finished by 12 noon in order to head to SFO.  I was not about to waste this meal on breakfast as I feel it can be easily made at home.  The name Mama Ji's was mentioned, so I hopped on Yelp to check out their pics and menu.  I was a little turned off by what I saw, but you know what?  I'm glad we tried them.  \n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThe simple eatery is in the middle of a residential area in the Castro, with regular table seating and a few outdoor sidewalk seats.  It's not a traditional Chinese restaurant by any means.  No gaudy chandeliers, no big floor vases, not a big dining room at all.  Quaint, simple and clean.\n\nBecause we came in on a Sunday morning just before 10am, we were the only ones in there.  By the time we left an hour later, the place was jam packed!  \n\nMENU:\nDim sum items though no cart, dumplings, rice rolls, steamed buns, noodles, soups,vegetable dishes, chicken/pork/beef dishes, dessert, teas, wine, beer.\n\nA nicely printed order paper inside the menus are used to mark down your items.\n\nFOOD:\nPan Fried Pot Sticker - Though they're listed under the deep fried category on the menu, they we actually steamed and pan fried the traditional way.  The 3 gyoza were on the larger size, stuffed plump with pork and shrimp, and were nicely finished with crisp bottoms.  Went perfect with the bottle of dark vinegar on the table.\n\nShrimp Stuffed Mushrooms - 3 big mushrooms caps were stuffed with a heaping shrimp mixture and sat in a pool of a mildly sweet & savory sauce.  Nice and light.\n\nPork Shumai - One of my favorite dim sum items were tasty as expected here.  The 4 pieces of pork mixture encased in a won tun shell were nicely steamed and flavorful.\n\nNoodle with Chili Bean Paste - Yowza, this was absolutely orgasmic!  The noodles were a thick chow mein style, simply boiled, then topped in a thick, brown chili bean paste gravy that consisted of ground pork, frozen peas and carrots, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os.  Maximum savoriness and extremely delicious, and not spicy.  Highly, highly recommended.\n\nShanghai Dumplings - These 3 little dumplings sat in mini baking aluminum pans that were steamed with a pork mixture and were very juicy when biting into them.  Be mindful of geyser-like squirts lol!\n\nBBQ Pork Rice Roll - Similar to a look funn dish, or what I refer to as Chinese burritos.  The big rice rolls were stuffed with char siu and bits of cilantro (yuck for me), steamed, sliced, and covered in a thin, savory brown sauce.  Delish!!!!\n\nSteamed Golden Lava Buns - The only disappointment of our meal, IMO anyway.  I'm a fan of Chinese custard tarts, but because they weren't available, we thought we'd try this as the menu lists it as \"flowy egg custard\".  I knew they weren't tarts but knew I'd get that custard flavor that I love.  What came were 3 white steamed buns with a yellow dot marked on the top.  Tore off a piece, and this thick yellow liquid poured out.  It would've been good but the liquid custard was super gritty like unbaked custard.  Yuck.

Not to mention there is generally a solid crowd and often a table wait. So my girlfriend and I decided to give it a whirl with already high expectations. \n\nUpon arrival we were immediately seated at one of the last remaining two tops.\n\nDetailed below are our thoughts on each item ordered.\n\nSichuan Beef - Standard, what you would expect at any Chinese restaurant. Nothing to write home about.\n\nShanghai Dumplings - Found to be rather on the larger side. Was a complete mouthful with each dumpling. As I find dumplings are intended to be consumed in one bite, this made it rather difficult to enjoy.\n\nChongqing Chicken - And now for the chicken. It was bizarre. It tasted very chemically. My honest thought, is after the chicken had been plated in the kitchen, the cook turned to the right or left to grab something accidentally knocking over a bottle of 409 or Windex which emptied in to the plate. The bottle fell to the ground which when the cook turned back around they were none the wiser. It was then expedited and served to our table. In reality we of course know this is not the case and our only conclusion is that the peppercorns were creating the strong and very distinct flavor. But it was definitely something we couldn't shake or get past.\n\nRegarding the service, MaMa Ji was our primary server and she was extremely pleasant and friendly. We give her 5 stars. The other staff on hand that night was quite good as well. \n\nWe wanted so bad for this place to hit a home run but were a bit disappointed in a few areas. Maybe we'll give it another shot sometime.

On a recent weekday night around 9 p.m. this place was packed with boisterous diners, me among them.  There were two servers, each about whom I have no complaints, and even MaMa Ji herself stepped up to my table to ask how everything was.  So service?  They've got it covered, despite what one might read elsewhere on yelp.  \n\nFood?  They've got that covered too.  \n\nI was prepared not to feel fondly about MaMa Ji's after reading several non-rave reviews from shortly after they opened but I admit to being completely won over by my meal here.  Whatever kinks they opened with appear to have been ironed out, as the crowd and the steamy good food attest to.  \n\nAn assortment of small dishes (spicy cucumbers [$5.95], crispy spring rolls [$4.75], excellent pork pot stickers [$4.75]) was followed by a fiery dish of Pickled Long Beans with Ground Pork ($10.95).  So fiery, in fact, that more rice was required just to get through it.  MaMa Ji doesn't lie; when the menu says this Sichuan cuisine is fiery take note.  Fiery and good.    \n\nAn eating establishment in the Castro that's alive and hopping on a weekday night?  Good service?  Really good food?  I'm a yelper and I experienced all of that at MaMa Ji's.  There's probably better and cheaper versions of this food to be found elsewhere in the City but when this is where you are, this is the place to go.

Apparently, we weren't the only ones to know of this place, because the wait on Sunday for lunch was about an hour! We ended up ordering a wide assortment, and I will say that pretty much everything was spot on. \n\nOf note were: shu mai (plump, moist, chock full of shrimp and shiitake mushrooms and pork goodness), shrimp dumplings with pea shoots (large in size), fried shrimp balls (these were the smallest I have ever seen, but fried perfectly and not oily at all!), garlic and ginger sauteed gai lan (tender and perfectly cooked, with a nicely light ginger sauce), haw gow (tasty with a lot of shrimp filling), beef chow fun (really good and not too salty or oily which often happens). \n\nI did not try the chive and shrimp dumplings or the xiao long bao, since I was stuffed, but my friends had no complaints. Nor did I try the dessert custard buns with condensed milk and egg, but they were appropriately oozy and hot upon arrival. \n\nThe only dishes I didn't think were up to snuff given the price were the shrimp in rice noodles with the soy sauce, because the rice noodles were SO mushy and fell apart at the touch. I also thought that the vegetarian egg rolls, while better than most, were still a bit boring. I wish that they would try for the Shanghai style egg rolls which have a much tastier filling, but I do understand that they are a restaurant that specializes in Szechuan-style cuisine. \n\nService was speedy and responsive, especially for a Chinese restaurant. I think it's pretty obvious that this is a family run establishment, as the serving staff was not formal at all. It helped that we could speak Mandarin. I would not hesitate to return to try some of the other dishes. \n\nAnother vote in their favor in terms of authenticity? There were actually Chinese people waiting in line amongst the hipster SF crowd that you normally see when there is a wait outside a restaurant.", "author": "Leslie H."}

The ingredients tasted really fresh and cooked well so the veggies it was cooked in was not soggy but still crunchy i.e. the celery in the country shrimp. Our favorite dish was the kung pao tofu (recommended for vegetarians) and the shrimp and chive dumplings.\n\nThe mama ji's special country shrimp, though well cooked was overly salty for my liking. Kung pao tofu was just perfect along with the shrimp and chive dumpings and i highly recommend these dishes if you come by. The fish fragrant  tofu was our least favorite dish as the bamboo shoots over powered the dish and it had a kind of prune after taste to it. The chinese broccoli with garlic wasn't as flavorful as we'd expected it to be and i wished they included hoisen sauce to go along with it.\n\nI later found out that this was a Szechuan place and wishes we ordered the soup instead maybe one day.

I've lived here for three decades and I'm particular about food. I brought many friends here, including recent immigrants from China, and they said it was their favorite, too! \n\nBut something changed. Suddenly, a little less than two years ago, maybe a year after Mama Jis had opened, the food became AWFUL! I came again, because I couldn't believe it, and again, the food was so awful I couldn't stomach it!   I tried to ask what had happened to my favorite dishes I had so loved, but got nothing but defensiveness or blank stares in response. So I quit them. So sad! \n\nBut tonight, after almost two years, I thought I'd give it another chance. I ordered the fried pumpkin in salty duck egg yolk. The first 6 or 7 times I'd ordered it, after they'd just opened three? four? years ago, it had been divinely light, delicate, and flavorful, with a wonderful, crunchy, dry, salty batter coating the soft, delicious pumpkin inside. Tonight, the batter was thick, heavy, bland, hard, and covered with yellow slime. Bravely, I bit through it anyway, and it had ZeRO flavor, and the texture was absolutely stomach turning.  I objected and asked for my bill, and the owner? or manager came to ask what was wrong, I told her it was terrible, and she argued with me! And handed me the bill! Which I stupidly paid. But she was stupider. If I hadn't wasted $16.50 (with tip) I might not have been pissed enough to write this review. \n\nThey lost their mojo right when they were getting so popular.

Where else you going to go in the Bernal / Mission / Castro area for Chinese food? Chinese Food & Donuts? Only if you enjoy explosive diarrhea.\n\nB) Run by NICE Chinese people. This is quite a novelty for me. I usually get extremely anxious around my own people. So much so that my boyfriend refuses to go to any other Chinese restaurant with me because I naturally regress to my mother in a Chinese restaurant. Because you know - you gotta fend for yourself. ...But here, they're nice! Mama Ji herself is nice! Perhaps this is the luxury of the restaurant being in Castro. Which takes me to my next point.\n\nC) The dim sum is pricier than say Good Luck Dim Sum in the Richmond. But people, it's dim sum in the Castro. And it's GOOOOD and very authentic. I'd say they have some of the highest quality dim sum in San Francisco. Maybe not as good as Yank Sing, but competitive. Their selection is small. But it's a small restaurant. You can tell that everything is made fresh with great ingredients. And the best part - if you go early, you can get seated right away and not have to wait an hour and a half to get berated by Chinese waiters.\n\nBesides their dim sum, their chow mein, chow fun and string beans with beef are amazing. I have had some other dishes that I think are good, but not great. I'm Cantonese so I can speak more to their dim sum than their \"numbing\" dishes. \n\nThe absolute must have - Their lava buns. Is it the best in the world? No. But considering I feel like this is something you could only get going to a very chinese dim sum place, but they have it here is amazing.

The first time I went here after the change, I had pretty mediocre dim sum as well as a bagel with lox left over from the old menu. It was bad.\n\nYears later  (yesterday) I decided to give it another chance as it's close to my house and I love Sichuan food. Enough time to work out the kinks, right?\n\nRight. Pretty good, in my 'hood and many of the dishes are superb. \n\nGet the spicy cold noodles if you're a Sichuan style food fan. It's expensive, but a large portion and really good. The shimp/eggplant dim sum are also good, as are the Har Gow. \nI also like the pork rolls, but they were pretty pricey. Yummy if you're splurging.\n\nSkip the xlbs (called Shanghai Dumplings here)  No soup inside and the pork filling was mushy and bleh. I was also not a fan of the deep fried Meat Dumplings because they tasted like they had those icky dried shrimp inside (sooo not a fan of that strong fishy flavor.) Kid really liked those because she said the consistency was perfect, and she doesnt hate on the dried shrimp. She thought the dried shrimp flavor came from the oil they were fried in, but didnt matter where it came from for me....it was there and unwelcome.\n\nI looked at the regular dinner menu before I left, and I'll go back to check it out;  it looks good.

Booo!  \n\nWe came here on a Saturday night. The restaurant was jam packed at the time. It was about a 20 min wait for a party of 3 (we waited outside in the cold brrrr). After being seated we were handed the menus and I scanned it...hard. What caught my eye were the shrimp dumplings and the shanghai dumplings (you know..the one with the soup inside). When I turned to the back of the menu it had a list of \"Tonight's specials\" and to my surprise I saw Beef Chow Fun on the list. I was so happy, like WOW it was my night! *insert crying emoji here *insert XD emoji here\n\nOrders came out in a reasonable amount of time and we dove in.\n\nBeef chow fun--Very nommy but was very greasy..It looked like I had lip gloss on after I was finished. It was chow fun with obstacles, I had to dodge the green onions and regular onions (I'm not a fan of either). I guess there was miscommunication with the waiter when I asked him what was in the beef chow fun and he said something about celery and I didn't want that. Anyways it had a good amount of beef, bean sprouts, and carrots which I didn't mind. I wanted ordered more but I didn't want to be the only one eating/finishing it. Plus I would've skipped into a foodcoma and I was the driver...\n\nShrimp dumplings--Delishness! especially with the special soy sauce that went with it. My friends and I ordered extra it was so nom nom nom.\n\nShanghai dumplings--It was okay. There was nothing special about them and they didn't have much soup inside. I've had the authentic shanghai dumplings in Shanghai and these were nothing close to the legit ones. The only thing they had in common was prolly the appearance. \n\nOverall, service was good, food was good, but parking was a BIT CHallenging!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-22", "description": "A couple Sundays ago, my friends and I wanted to get dim sum, but the usual Richmond spots were overflowing with people. We decided to come here since we had to get one of our friends from the Castro anyway. I wasn't sure how to feel about a restaurant with Szechuan food and Dim Sum under the same roof. That's weird. It's like having mushroom risotto and chicken tikka masala on the same menu. I like to think of myself as a pretty open minded person so I mean, why not?\n\nHa Gow - They were plump and filled with nicely cooked shrimp. The shrimp stuffing was underseasoned and needed more young bamboo though. Also, the skins were too tough. Most Bay Area Dim Sum places make ha gow skins too delicate, but MaMa Ji's fall on the other side of the spectrum.\n\nSiu Mai - Not enough shrimp or shiitake. The flavor is mostly dominated by the ground pork so it could use some more balance. \n\nXLB - Plump and juicy. The skin wasn't too thick, and there was a good amount of broth inside. Some more ginger and green onions would help, but these weren't bad at all.\n\nPan Fried Radish Cake - These tasted pretty good. There was a good amount of radish, dried shrimp, and Chinese sausage mixed in. The thing that bothered me was that they didn't seem pan fried enough. They came out piping hot, but there was zero browning on the top and bottom. I'm not sure how to explain that.\n\nSticky Rice Wrapped in Lotus Leaf - The rice was stuffed with a good combination of pork, shiitake, and dried shrimp. I like having some Chinese sausage in there, but it's not crucial. One thing that stood out to me was that there was a plain egg yolk inside. Usually when there's an egg yolk inside the rice, you're supposed to use salted egg yolk as a flavoring agent. A plain egg yolk doesn't really add much to the rice. I don't even like sticky rice with the egg yolk, but if there's one inside, it should be salt brined. \n\nFried Shrimp Balls - These were probably the best thing we had here. Thin, crispy waves of batter on the outside with juicy, tender shrimp paste on the inside. There's not much to complain about. \n\nWe also ordered a Szechuan dish just for the heck of it. I'm a big fan of Szechuan style garlic pork belly, but the one at MaMa Ji's wasn't all that great. The pork wasn't very tender, and the sauce wasn't that flavorful. I could taste the highlighting flavors of garlic and Szechuan peppercorns, but it didn't have a strong base. Maybe it needed more soy sauce or stronger stock, but I think there are better versions elsewhere. Little Sichuan in San Mateo and Z&Y in Chinatown make great garlic pork belly and Szechuan food in general. \n\nGiven the location, it's hard to expect MaMa Ji's to compete with more established restaurants in other parts of the city. For a place that stands out by offering this kind of food in the Castro, it's fine.", "author": "Nei N."}

Especially the dim sum.\n\nOn a quick layover in San Francisco, I was finally able to try the famous Mama Ji's, recommended by my sister, who absolutely adores this place. Came here on a Monday around 11ish? And thankfully, guess no one likes Mondays because it wasn't as packed as people have complained it to be YAY!\n\nIt's a very hole-in-the-wall place, and if I didn't know of it, I'd pass by it without looking back. It's pretty easy to miss (as someone who's not from here), because it's located in a neighborhood area.\n\nBut let's talk about the food. WOW. I have been disappointed multiple times by people overhyping restaurants but this place was amazing!! We ordered the har gao (shrimp dumplings), pork and shrimp shumai, the soup dumplings (xiao long bao), Bang Bang chicken, and the fried pumpkin. Everything was so delicious, I can't even begin to describe it, but I'll try.\n\nStarting with the dim sum: har gao and shumai. I love both those things, and since they're some of the basic dim sums, hard to go wrong. But the har gao was perfectly juicy and steaming hot. It was pretty packed to the brim with delicious shrimp and was really melts in your mouth good. The shumai taste was pretty average (obviously on the tastier side of average), but the texture was awesome. It's topped with some kind of fish roe or something and it gives another dimension to the texture, which is really fun. \n\nI dedicate an entire paragraph to the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) because I LOVE THEM. I LOVE THEM TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND I WISH I COULD EAT THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. But anyway, the way the XLB is served here is pretty interesting, because it's not on top of the steam paper on inside of the bamboo/metal steamer like most XLB are. They come in their own cute little scalloped individual tin (almost like an egg tart tin). It's 3 to a steamer, which isn't that many, but HO LEE COW. It's one of the best XLB I've ever had. Haven't had Din Tai Fung, so sorry I don't know, but this place is juicy and the piping hot soup inside is AMAZING. The only downside it that the XLB wrapper is a little bit thicker than I'm used to, but I can dig it. Doesn't affect the wonderful taste at all.\n\nThe Bang Bang chicken was WOW. I love love spicy food, and this totally hit the spot. Perfectly crunchy, and the garlic hits you (in a good way). Some of the best wings I've had. Wingstop and BWW, please step up your game (sorry, do you guys have this in California??) Then comes the fried pumpkin. At first, the name was not appealing to me at all--\"fried pumpkin with salty duck egg yolks\"--??! What?? Do not be repealed by the name! The pumpkin is sweet, and goes well with the saltiness of the egg yolk. The egg yolk gives yet another texture to the fried crispiness of the pumpkin with its soft powdery-ness. At first, the taste is a bit odd, but I found myself liking it more and more and kept eating until I wanted to pass out from food coma.\n\nBetween 2 people, this was more than enough and we were really really full afterwards. We left with happy bellies. Can't wait to visit again.", "author": "Erin K."}

Among the good food that time were shrimp and shanghai dumplings, fried rice, and some sort of chicken dish. My friend and I left super full and really happy.\n\nThe second time eating-in was totally underwhelming. There was a super long wait, the service took FOREVER because they \"forgot\" our order, and then the food was really meh. The bean paste noodles --- not good at all. Dunno why people are stoked about them.\n\nFinally, I've gotten takeout a few times. This has been fine. It's just nice to have someone cook for you though. The food is good, it's served hot, they're pretty quick and it's all reasonably priced, but I'm just no longer impressed with the flavors.\n\nIf you're looking for dim sum and for some reason you can't travel anywhere else in the city, go, but would I recommend this place as a go-to spot? Nah.\n\nOther notes...\n-- It's a bit cramped\n-- If you order food to go they ask you to wait outside\n-- Shanghai dumplings are really good\n-- they serve beer/wine\n-- they are conveniently located just a few short blocks from the heart of the Castro", "author": "Andrea D."}

(Which for those who don't know, Szechuan is a variant of Chinese cuisine but very different from traditional Cantonese Chinese cuisine which is most prevalent in the Bay Area.)\n\nNeedless to say, mama ji's is all about extremely fresh handmade dumplings. It's like grandmas cooking and my mother and I definitely agreed we had to take grams here asap. \n\nWhat we ordered: \nChives and shrimp dumplings - bomb\n\nShanghai dumpling - comes with 3 in order and ginger. Pretty solid level of soupiness and size.\n\nHand pulled rice wrap with shrimp - very fresh!\n\nPork and shrimp siu mai - one of the best I've had\n\nTriple c wings - best wings ever. So juicy with a sweet, spicy, and crunchy skin. So bomb.\n\n\nTotally coming back. They also deliver on caviar so it's convenient too. Enjoy :)", "author": "Lauren Y."}

And a charming smile that will make you melt. Ohhh and...a hinny you can bounce a quarter off of.\n\nOnly boobies don't make him go ga-ga, pecs do. Ahhh, why are all the hot guys, gay? I've never seen such a large congregation of hot guys in one place than the Castro. \n\nAnyhow, after reading that there was a new all-day dim sum joint with full service in the Castro, I was thrilled as none exist in San Francisco (Dim Sum King in Pacifica is the nearest one). I had especially high hopes for MaMa Ji's since early foodie publication reports said that the owners hired a former Koi Palace cook (voted best dim sum in the bay area by SFGate and I agree) but later reports said the cook was from Yank Sing. Regardless of where the cook hailed from, both Koi Palace and Yank Sing are well-known though the latter is more well-known for it's not very Chinesey prices and catering to non-natives.  \n\nI'm all about supporting my peeps and mom and pop shops, but MaMa Ji's dim sum was far from solid with Koi Palace prices at hole-in-the-wall takeout quality that you will find in Sunset or Richmond for 1/3 the cost. If you never had dim sum before then this may suffice but if you're a dim sum connoisseur, you may be sorely disappointed.\n\nThe owner was very nice but service was non-existent. We had to go to the counter to order and get our own waters. Our \"waitress\" lacked basic interpersonal skills and was MIA most of the time. She never checked on us and there was only two other tables there who were laptop camping. I could of cared less had the food been good because inattentive service is a given at most Asian places so I didn't really factor service into my rating. \n\nBack to the main reason we came here: The Dim Sum. \n\nAlthough there's 40 items listed on the menu ($3-$6 per an order), over 1/3rd of the items were not available the day we went. In addition, some of the things arrived not as pictured on the menu. I'm allergic to MSG and was told they don't use it; I even asked again in Cantonese to make sure. However, I could immediately tell there was in fact MSG as my tongue went numb and I became very thirsty. Not a good thing as I had to stop eating midway through, though I'm sure my thunder thighs were relieved. \n\nOur order:\n*Woh Tip: Potstickers ($3): http://bit.ly/10TJIac\n*Hai Gow: Shrimp Dumplings ($4): http://bit.ly/16DRpco\n*Shrimp \"Balls\" ($4): http://bit.ly/14oAmUI\n*Shrimp Stuffed Mushrooms ($4): http://bit.ly/10LUvqk\n*Shrimp & Chive Dumplings ($4): http://bit.ly/14oAzY2\n*Chicken Siu Mai Dumplings ($3): http://bit.ly/11RmrKV\n*Spareribs in Black Pepper Sauce ($4): http://bit.ly/11mrzF9\n\nThe best dish was the plump Chicken Siu Mai. Everything else was 2 stars worthy. The Hai Gow was small with not much shrimp filling. The Potsticker's filling was rancid with an weird aftertaste. The Scallop & Chive Dumpling had a gummy skin and the chive to scallop ratio was way off with just one very teeny weeny scallop bit in each dumpling.\n\nThe Beef Ribs in Black Pepper Sauce were brought in lieu of of the Spareribs in Black Bean Sauce because it wasn't available but they didn't bother telling us until they were handing us the beef ribs. Ugh not wanting to argue over a $4 dish, we said we would take the beef ribs which was just basically scraps of bones and fat.\n\nThe Shrimp Stuffed Mushrooms were topped with an identifiable opaque white seafoody mousse (4 received versus 8 as pictured on the menu) while the Shrimp Balls were not even balls at all.\n\nSadly, a solid dim sum joint with no MSG in the Castro was just too good to be true. As we were about to leave, the owner asked us if we liked it and I did as obedient Asian would do. LIE. Shake my head. Smile. AND Lie. *sigh*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We were told to put our name on the list outside and we had to wait for our entire party before being seated. For a Thursday night, this place was pretty crowded. A couple tables for two sat empty, so there definitely wasn't much of a wait, if any. Here's the breakdown:\n\nService: Friendly service. They took our order with a smile and were attentive.\n\nAmbiance: Chill, casual spot. Small. They sat the three of us at a table normally meant for two. We got cozy. Also, we were right by the door, which almost never stays closed (unless you constantly close the hinge on the top of the door every single time after someone enters/exits).\n\nFood: After consulting Yelp, we ordered the shrimp dumplings. Chongqing chicken, and dried fried green beans. Nothing really stood out to me. The shrimp dumplings were pretty solid. The chicken was just deep fried chicken and really more of the crispy exterior than chicken. I was a bit disappointed. The green beans were typical - nothing special, but not bad either.\n\nDrinks: They have quite an extensive wine list, which includes some pricey bottles. We ordered a bottle of white wine (I forgot what it was called), but it was pretty good. Went down nice and smooth.\n\nWould I return? I wasn't particularly blown away with our food, but the table next to us ordered a couple dishes that smelled really good. It's a toss up, but I don't think that's enough to get me to return.

We came here last night and ordered our favorites just like normal. Out came dim sum and followed with the Spicy Cold Noodles, right off the bat I noticed they were completely different. Usually it's a gorgeous bed of thick egg noodles that's mixed table side. This dish was just a blob of tiny string noodles mushed together in a ball that the server couldn't even mix. Not appetizing looking at all. This dish use to be gorgeous and now it's just a mess. Not to mention it did not taste the same, we actually sent it back because of how bad it was. And I never send anything back no matter how much I detest something so that just gives you an idea of how much they messed up this dish.\nSo apparently they changed the recipe that day and now will be using the little noodles drenched and mushed in sauce.

Out of the 6 dishes we ordered, only the seafood shumai turned out to be really good; the rest are really terrible (yes, the contrast is quite stark). \n\nCRISPY SPRING ROLLS\nNot good. Authentic spring rolls should be stuffed with steamed turnip strips, which gives the spring rolls a fresh flavour by countering the oily taste from the deep-frying. These spring rolls were stuffed with cabbage strips, which added to the oily taste. Not good. =( \n\nSTEAMED BBQ PORK BUNS\nAny self-respecting dim sum place should get this staple dim sum dish right. But their buns were not nearly as nice as they ought to be: the meat was too hard (the fats didn't melt into the meat like they should), and there isn't enough gravy in the bun to keep the insides moist. The result is a slightly chunky and dry bun. Real BBQ pork buns taste waaaay better than this. =( \n\nSHRIMP STUFFED EGGPLANTS\nThe shrimps are deep fried, and taste like fish cake. I think that pretty much sums this dish up. I was SOOO disappointed with this dish, because I like eggplants so much. \n\nSEAFOOD SHUMAI\nFinally, a really decent dish!! This tasted good; the prawns were succulent and not fish-cake-like, and it tastes just like how it should. You should order this dish, if you really have to eat here. \n\nFRIED RICE\nThis was terrible. Real fried rice should have a fragrant \"wok\" flavour, where the rice is semi-caramelised. It's the signature flavour of all fried rice. This is just rice tossed with MSG in a pan (and it's really too salty). It's a shame to call it fried rice. \n\n SHANGHAI DUMPLINGS\nAfter reading the raving reviews about the Shanghai dumplings (xiaolongbao), we decided to give it a try and give this place one last chance at redemption. It was a mistake. If you think that this xiaolongbao is good, wait till you taste the real ones. \n1) the skin is too thick; real xiaolongbaos have thin skins that house the meat and soup within. \n2) there isn't enough soup in the dumpling. The soup is a signature of xiaolongbaos. \n3) the meat tastes bad; it doesn't taste very fresh. \n\nOh, and they also don't share their wifi password. =(", "author": "Yu Sheng T."}

I'd locked my cell phone in my host's house and needed to find a place in walking distance, so I was resigned to having a mediocre meal to pay for my stupidity. Turns out this place is a bit of a hot spot for Chinese food in the Castro. I enjoyed my dinner greatly, and wouldn't mind going back more on purpose in the future.\n\nWe went at around 5:30, right at opening, and had the place to ourselves for a bit. The space was small and pleasantly homey. There was friendly service to match.\n\nThe menu offered an extensive selection of dim sum and Sichuan specialties. It was hard to choose what to order with just two stomachs to work with, but we settled on some seafood Shanghai dumplings, spicy cold noodles, and fish with chiles and Sichuan pepper. The soup dumplings were tasty, made with pork and maybe shrimp? They were juicy and very hot, but I feel like I'm always burning myself on soup dumplings. The spicy cold noodles were fine, nothing special but easy to eat. The noodles were firm and the sauce had some good flavor. The centerpiece of the meal was really the fish, a giant bowl of fillets swimming in a bright red broth loaded with peppers. The fish was delicious, delicately meaty and permeated by the broth. There seemed to be an endless amount of it, too--must be some cheap-ass fish, not that that mattered at all. The broth was good, spicy and a little bit numbing, if lacking a bit in depth. It tasted great on the fish and splashed over rice.\n\nMama Ji's isn't the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to or anything, but it's a solid joint in a central location with seriously satisfying food. I'd make good use of it if it were within walking distance of my house. I might even come to depend on it.", "author": "Steph C."}

At this point, we're full and are tired of waiting.

The shanghai dumplings for example are 3.75 but they only give you 3 of them, whereas for the same price, other places give you 4. \n\nNot saying it's not worth it -- it's completely worth it if you aren't able to travel all the way to Chinatown or Richmond for great Chinese food as there really aren't any other sit down places in the area that are as high quality as this place.\n\nThere are lineups from time to time but the wait is usually not more than 15m. They take on the longer side to prepare food, however.\n\nIn terms of ambience - it doesn't look like your typical Chinese restaurant since it has a pretty modern look. The owner is Mama Ji and her husband who helps seat and greet people and take orders. The space indoors is very crowded in the sense that the tables are all very close together.

It's was 1/3 full but we weren't allowed to sit till my husband parked the car, seems silly when there were plenty of tables and we were made to stand...ahh another one of those inflexible staff with no common sense.  I can understand if it were full.\n\nAnyway, we ordered the following\nSpicy noodles $8.95 lacked flavoring and very bland for a house special, but had a lot of veg and pork to mix in together.\nOrdered a bunch of dim sum from $3.75 medium to large $4.95. Noticed there were no small dim sums. Most came in 3s and we were a group of 3, so it worked out fine. pretty good, nothing special.  Only bad dim sum were shrimp balls, which lacked flavor and texture and they were quite small and not worth the $4.95.\nIn Chinese restaurants tea is usually around 50 cents person but here, they give you iced water instead and tea is $3 per person.  \n\nOverall, brunch was ok...tried it, done it and probably won't go back.  Will go to the regular Riverside or koi Palace for more authentic and cheaper Chinese Sum.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

We went through several refills of tea and even when the line started forming, felt almost encouraged to take our time and enjoy ourselves.\n\nWe noticed their wide range of Belgian beer (bottled and on tap) which was a random surprise, but just another reason for us to come back and try dinner, which has expanded options.

The chef makes all his own sauces from scratch and has a NO MSG policy. The food was top notch, from the amazing Seafood Shumai, to the delicious Steamed B.B.Q. Pork Bun, and the Chive Shrimp Dumplings. However, if I had to pick only one Dim Sum as #1, I would say that the Steamed Egg Custard Bun is probably the best I have ever tasted -- including several trips that I have taken to Hong Kong!\n\nThere were a few Dim Sum that one could not yet order as I guess they were not yet ready for prime time -- but we will definitely be back to try them soon. \n\nThey serve four types of Chinese teas directly from Taiwan and each one is served with it's own small teapot -- so that everyone at the table can order what they want and get unlimited refills of hot water.\n\nThe other exciting thing about MaMa Ji's is that at night they will be open to serve Szechuan cuisine -- if the food is anything close to the Dim Sum, which I'm sure it will be, it will be very exciting to have a great Chinese dinner place in the Castro.\n\nIf you love Dim Sum as much as I do and want a local neighborhood setting, then you should definitely try MaMa Ji's!", "author": "Laurence N."}

We were able to get table for our group, though it was near closing time.   \n\nThe food here is really tasty, but it was also oily and heavy. Be prepared. Though I guess that was a good thing since it allowed me to soak up all the liquid beverages I had earlier. \n\nThe dishes that we ordered were the dry-fried green beans, mapo tofu,chongqing spicy chicken, boiled beef slices in fiery sauce, kung pao chicken, wonton noodle soup, pot stickers, and  crispy spring rolls.   From all the dishes, my favorites were the boiled beef slices in fiery sauce, wonton noodle soup, spring rolls, and pot stickers.  The boiled beef meat was tender and flavored well. It was really a good dish, that I would have eaten all of it, if I didn't have to share. \n\nI didn't care for the dry-fried green beans as it was too difficult of a dish to eat with chopsticks. The green beans were chopped into small pieces that it was just difficult to eat. Not a pleasant eating experience.  The chongqinq spicy chicken taste was nothing special. I couldn't taste any flavors that would make it stand out unfortunately.   The mapo tofu was just too oily.\n\nI think Mama Ji's would be a great lunch/dim sum experience, that I would be willing come back to give it another go.", "author": "Marck N."}

I was so starving that I forced myself to eat, but had that not been the case I would have left the entire order untouched.  The potstickers were OK, not terrible but not great.  The hot-n-sour soup was SO bland and tasted only like pepper. It looked delicious but looks can clearly be deceiving.  We also ordered the kung pao chicken and beef with string beans.  The KPC was extremely bland and the chicken pieces were overcooked so much-they were the hardest pieces of chicken I have ever eaten--seriously, it was like eating little rocks!  The beef was chewy and overly salty.  Both dishes seemed to lack flavor with the exception of Soy Sauce.  Service was also pretty bad.  We had to ask for water numerous times and still didnt get it until after half our meal was over.  In addition to that, I had to get up to get our own plates and chopsticks to eat our meals.(like HELLO were we supposed to eat with our hands or our soup spoons?)\n\nOverall, I was lucky I had good company at the dinner with me, because otherwise it would have been a total BUST!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-14", "description": "Uhm. Well first things first, I wasn't expecting this restaurant to be so...Americanized. I guess its location in the Castro was a pretty good hint that dim sum was not a common cuisine in that neighborhood, but still I was expecting something more authentic and Chinese-y when I was reading the yelp reviews. Instead of that rowdiness and loudness I normally associate with going out to eat dim sum, my experience at Mama Ji's was surprisingly quiet and civilized (I'm only half joking). The restaurant itself is a sit-down environment, rather than the round tables with dim sum cart pushers walking to and fro. What is normally a half sheet of 8x11 paper given with a little pencil at most other dim sum places, the ordering sheet here was a piece of paper complete with full-on color, sufficient English titles of the dishes, and pictures (that's practically unheard of!) I was so amazed for the first 5 minutes because I've never seen such a well-done ordering sheet in my life. I didn't even want to write on it, but I was hungry...so I did. \n\nHere, dim sum is served all day, which you order on their glossy colorful ordering sheet, or you can order from their regular bound menu. We only ordered dim sum at our particular visit last week, but we saw other people enjoying dishes off their regular menu that looked amazing! \n\nJust a few comments on the dim sum we ordered:\n-for the most part, I was able to recognize the dishes on the menu, but their selection is extremely limited compared to a legit dim sum place. But it is reasonable to say they have a smaller menu since their size is a lot smaller and the restaurant does not have the capacity to offer as many dim sum selections as other established dim sum joints. \n- soup dumplings were served with tin cups underneath..what's up with that? Never have I ever been served soup dumplings that way (see pic.) it was just a bit off-putting for me, and ruined the experience of eating them as all the soup would fall out when you peel the dumpling off the cup. Oh, and also, they're tiny as hell. I could eat one in one bite if I really wanted to. (PS: make your own soup dumpling sauce with the vinegar, soy sauce, and chili oil.) \n- shrimp shumai was on the better side of ok. Meat was juicy but it tasted a little bit sweeter than what I'm used to tasting with shrimp shumais?\n- rice roll plates were close to 75% rice roll and 25% meat (in our case, we ordered shrimp rice rolls, and there were only 3 pieces of shrimp lying in a huge bed of rice sheet). We did not finish this dish because it just did not taste right with the disproportionate ratio.\n-pea sprout shrimp dumpling: I DO recommend this dish. It's awesome, try it.\n- steamed pork buns was too dry for my taste. Bleh.\n- lotus rice order was made traditional and was wrapped with not only the tea leaf, but also two layers of paper. Talk about really unwrapping your meal before you eat it. Made with dried shrimp and salted duck yolk, which are traditional ingredients, but over all, it tasted a lil bland.\n\nIn general, I do not consider myself a picky person but after reading what I wrote in this review, I am reconsidering that conception. I do say that I enjoyed my meal here at Mama Ji's but not as much as I could have, knowing that I've had much much better dim sum experiences. Also, the prices are higher, with portions smaller, for what I've had before, which comes to no surprise, given its location. Overall, I cannot see myself making a special trip back to this place for dim sum when there are way better places in Chinatown, but if I ever do find myself in that neighborhood with a killer craving for dim sum, yall already know I'll be at Mama Ji's.", "author": "Kristi L."}

I've had a good share of authentic Szechuan food and I believe MaMa Ji's borders more on Szechuan fusion, in a good way. Sometimes it's nice to get away from the yelling waiters running back and forth from the kitchen, which is a common scene in most authentic Chinese establishments. The entrees can be shared or enjoyed individually.\n\nI got the Noodles with Chili Bean Paste ($8.75). For some reason, I was expecting a noodle soup, but this is literally cooked noodles with a thick layer of sauce on top. It also came with a lot more vegetables (peas and carrots) than I envisioned. The sauce is not too spicy and makes the dish a comforting, non-oily dinner option.\n\nMy friend got the Fish Fragrant Eggplant ($9.95), which is actually vegetarian (they just use the same sauces that would traditionally be paired with fish I believe). It was a bit spicy, but quite delicious, and I was jealous.\n\nThere were many local, almost-next-door couples and individuals dining here; the table next to us said this was their favorite go-to dinner spot. I loved that the food wasn't overloaded with salt, MSG, and oil, as Chinese food usually goes.", "author": "Jessica F."}

He warned me ahead of time that there might be a wait but since we weren't starving and it was a warm sunny day, we decided it didn't really matter. We totally lucked out and found a parking spot right in front of the place (usually parking is at a premium in this neighborhood) -  we were already off to a good start...\n\nBrother put us on the waiting list (we were #4) and no more than 5 minutes later, we were ushered into the bustling restaurant. \n\nWe decided to order the pork buns, pork & shrimp shumai, shrimp & pea sprout dumplings and the shanghai dumplings. The service was quick and the food hot and tasty. There was a line outside the whole time we were there, but never once did we feel rushed to finish our steamy treats.  \n\nMy only wish was that the shanghai dumplings (aka soup dumplings) were more soupy. I was expecting to bite into the plump little dumpling and taste a lusciously flavorful broth like I did when I ate my very first Xiao Long Bao at Joe's Shanghai...but that was NYC, and well, this is not. It was good, but more soupi-ness would only serve to enhance the meaty morsel.\n\nI'd definitely go back and try some of the other dumplings on the menu, it all looked great.

They served everything in rounds. After about the 4th round of food, we started asking every time if there was more coming hoping the answer would be no.\n\nSome of my favorite things about Mama Ji's are\n- green bell peppers stuffed with shrimp \n- sweet rice with egg and sausage filling\n- shrimp stuffed eggplant\n- good selection shu mai and other dumplings. they have at least 3 different types of shu mai. omg. also the deep fried meat dumpling is excellent.\n- their beer, cider, and wine selection\n\nNext time I might skip on the pan fried turnip dish and the shanghai dumplings.\n\nI do give them an extra star because MaMa Ji's had a warm and cozy vibe compared to other dim sum restaurants.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-28", "description": "Been here a few times now, and it's definitely one of my favorites in the area. It does commonly get busy, so there can be a wait, and while the prices aren't bad, it's not cheap either. Portions are reasonable overall. Service is also okay, but not great. I sometimes have to ask multiple times for something before getting it. But regardless, the food is great, so I'll keep coming back. Many like it for the dim sum, but I'm all about the dinner food. \n\nThis most recent visit was a Friday night around 7:30pm. Fairly full inside, with another 5-7 parties waiting outside. Happened to slide in at just the right time to get a table for 2 with no wait. Though there were a couple more right after me who had to wait. Turnover does seem pretty good overall though, from what I've observed.\n\nShared a few items between 2 of us:\n- Fish with Chiles and Sichuan Pepper: this is an absolute staple for me, and I've had it 3-4 times now. It's roughly a fish soup with a very oily and spicy chili-based broth, with white fish, mung beans, and cabbage. This is one of my favorite incarnations of the soup, after having had it 4-5 places total. Though after having it this most recent time, I do have to concede that there's not that much fish in there, and overall the portion is fairly small compared to that at Chef Zhao's, another I had recently, for a comparable price ($2-3 difference). Still, it's damn good and not something I think I'll skip anytime soon.\n- Mama Ji's country-style shrimp: tried this for the first time. a mix of shrimp (maybe 10-15), bell peppers, and green onions. A little spicy too. Loved the veggies, and the flavor of the dish on the whole, but would have liked more shrimp, and this is coming from a veggie-lover. \n- Stir-Fried Pea Leaves with Garlic: Another relative staple for me. This comes out something like a cross between stir-fried spinach and broccoli rabe, but more on the spinach side of flavor, being a bit lighter. Delicious, and I personally loved putting it in the broth from the fish with chiles, letting it soak that in a bit. \n- Chinese Broccoli with Garlic: Something I've had less here, but still quite good. Not a lot to say about it, but a good serving size of the Chinese broccoli. Came out nicely cooked so that it still had the firmness to it but was a little soft.\n\nOverall, came to about $50 with tip I think. And another wonderful visit. I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Kris K."}

I'm giving it five stars with the expectation that the few hiccups will improve as they work out the kinks in a new operation. Here's the scoop: Szechuan food in the Castro, apparently with a hefty dim sum menu, and a selection of craft beers and Ritual coffee.  Yes, you read all of that right. \n\nAs an aside, I've felt that aside from Frances (hardly a frequent dinner choice), the Castro is a good food desert.  Forever-dieting gay boys do not require a hot food scene.  But the Castro is a food desert no longer. \n\nI came here last night with my dude, two coworkers, and one of the coworkers' young child.  The place was basically empty, and the ambiance could use a bit of work.  For example, as others note, the lighting is really harsh.  But we were basically attacked by waiters, and the dude behind the counter working the beer taps was answering questions and making suggestions left and right.  I felt like the service was extremely friendly. \n\nWe ordered: \n- Pork Shumai: These were good, but nothing special.  But hey, I like good, and don't usually look for special in my shumai. \n\n- Shrimp dumplings: The dumplings were great! They were filled with plump, well-cooked (read: not overcooked and pasty) shrimp, and had a delicate lining.  They were kind of higher-priced at around $9, but worth it. \n\n- Spare ribs:  These were a delicious set of cut up spare ribs in some sort of a soy-like but thickened brown sauce.  Not spicy, and very tasty. \n\n- Steamed fish and tofu special:  Holy hell, this needs to go on the regular menu.  Big chunks of fish with slices of tofu in a light-your-mouth-on-fire spicy red sauce. Very big yum.  Order a second glass of water. \n\n- Stir-fried pea sprouts with garlic:  This felt necessary after all of the heavy indulgence.  This again was good, but nothing special, but I just wanted some relief for my tongue so that was what I wanted. \n\n- Deep-fried pumpkin special: This again needs to go on the regular menu.  Chunks of pumpkin, dipped in I think it was duck eggs, and crispy fried, almost tempura style.  It was delicious, especially after being dunked in a chili-soy-vinegar mixture. \n\n- They made a special noodle dish for my coworkers' little girl who doesn't like spicy food. \n\n- We also ordered beer and wine. I think the wine list could use a bit of work (this is San Francisco, after all).  A nice dry rose or crisp riesling would compliment the spicy food very nicely.  But they have a ton of options for beer, and a couple of belgians on tap that will quench the fire in your mouth very nicely. \n\nIn all, a couple of kinks, but I'm excited to see what this place turns into.

Heck, we might even just set up an account here because we live practically next door.  But, alas, the good thing is that you can only eat so much dim sum.  Because if you eat too much dim sum, you probably surpassed your daily sodium intake in one sitting.  So, just eat some dim sum, but not too much dim sum.  Hmmm.  Is \"dim sum\" a term to describe a type of food presentation- you know, like hot pot or buffet and I am totally butchering its use?  I really don't want to look it up in wikipedia.  \n\nThe wifey and I bring our toddler here when we don't feel like cooking dinner.  Sure, it may not be the best toddler food in the world, what with the spicy cold noodles and the salty dim sum.  But it's food.  And it's pretty good.  Just not the best for a toddler.  But heck, tell that to the Szechuan Province full of toddlers.  But I may be using a broad generalization, because this is obviously not an \"everyday\" sort of thing.  Or is it?  I don't know.  I know of people who eat McDonald's everyday.  Do you remember when McDonald's hamburgers were only 5 cents?  No, because you'd be dead.  \n\nWhen compared to Z&Y in Chinatown, the cuisine isn't as enticing, but I don't care.  It's practically next door.\n\nAlthough the dim sum wrappings are variable and many-a-time show signs of premature sloughing as you attempt to pick them up out of the bamboo steamers,   the end product is what matters:  good flavor and substantiating satiety.  If I were younger and more of a d-bag, I'd bemoan the shortcomings of the number of folds on my xiao lum bao's (which would be 18) or whether or not water came to my table in a timely manner (because these flames are not going to be taken out by themselves).  I don't care about any of that anymore.  I mean, have you taken care of your kid when sick?  You know, like carrying a screaming kid with a fever around all night to console him and 3am visit to the emergency room for racemic epinephrine and decadron.

After a bad BBQ oyster at Fish in Sausalito for lunch, my wife wasn't sure she'd be able to eat but I somehow convinced her to try again; on top of that, I'm totally baffled how I got her to agree to Szechuan but she did.  Seeing Mama Ji's reviews and staying just around the block we headed over for a late dinner on Sunday night.  \n\nThe owners: attentive, engaging, and Mama Ji lives up to her name as she dotes on all the young kids.  Her husband was an absolute pleasure to talk to, making beer pairing suggestions while keeping up a light-hearted banter about food and whatnot.\n\nThe food: the deep-fried pumpkin--oh my god, even though hours before my wife swore off food she commenced to put away almost the whole plate.  If you see this on the menu it is an absolute must.\n\nAn aside about the menu:  it's limited but rightfully so. You're not going to be given a telephone book full of choices but that's because what they do, they do well.\n\nThe other dishes: pork spare ribs were savory, not the sickeningly sweet red dye no. 5 garbage you get elsewhere; BBQ pork buns were sticky, sweet, and fluffy; Kung Pao chicken was full of fresh peppers and cashews, perfect with the brown rice. \n\nIf we were locals this place would take home a good part of our weekly paycheck.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-11-03", "description": "Not a Chinatown hole in the wall!\n\nIn the mood for high-end, attention to textural detail dim sum, and not wanting to pay Yank Sing prices for a solo meal, I went to check this place out.  So, right off the bat: I was not going out for 'authentic' dim sum... which is super cheap, ingredient quality is mostly low, service is hurried and impersonal.  That ain't this place... so reviewers who gripe about 'slow' or 'inauthentic' should already be checking the wisdom of going for dim sum in the upper Castro if those are points by which they will judge the meal.\n\nThat said: I am adding an extra star on top of my overall 'meh' rating of the food.  This is because:\n1. The ingredients and cooked temperatures were to a very high standard.\n2. The service was quite attentive; both owners and several staff regularly checked in on me to make sure I was okay and fill water for both teapot and glass.  The food was not fast, which was not a problem for me in this context.\n3. With their heart so clearly in the right place, and knowing that I am very picky about dim sum, I don't think messing up their yelp ranking with another 2 star rating is warranted.  They wouldn't need to fix much for me to give them 5 stars! (more on that below....)  And I look forward to trying them again in the future to see if they have upped their game.\n\nI was only there for the Dim Sum... I cannot comment on the stir fried or deep fried menu items, soups or noodles.\n\nOkay... the problem for me:  The skins on the dumplings are just too thick and gluey.  While the shrimp inside the har gao and the pea sprout/shrimp dumplings was perfectly cooked (very important, and equally as hard to consistently get right), the skin sticks to your teeth and is not adding a positive dimension to the mouthfeel or flavor of the dumplings.  There is a slight raw rice flour flavor that comes through; and that also explains the gluey-ness.  I think they are making their own wraps in-house... so this issue should be easy to tweak and correct.\n\nThe XLB (Shanghai Dumplings) are missing the mark by a wider margin.  Again, the wraps are just not quite right.  Serving in the little metal cups is a good idea, but the tops are thick and stodgy where the dumpling has been sealed; while the skin around the midsection and bottom is almost bread-y.  The soup inside is not seasoned enough.\n\nThe condiments are also insufficient for one reason: the chili oil has no flavor.  I didn't ask for sambal or paste, or for whatever options they may have available on request, but what is provided on the table fails to offer flavor balance.  Their uber-plain chili oil, black vinegar and soy are not a sufficient palette with which to make a sauce with balance for my palate!\n\n but, again, great ingredients and cooking!", "author": "Josh K."}

We went elsewhere. \n\nAs a former server, I'm a pretty patient and understanding restaurant customer. But I still have some minimum expectations. \n\nOne of those expectations is to not be left outside in the rain, along with two other parties of two, because the only empty tables are four-tops. \n\nAfter staring at one such empty table for ten minutes through the window, the two-top squeezed into the kitchen entrance (your standard afterthought table) vacated and was offered to us. We inquired about what was wrong with the more suitably located empty table, and were told it was for four (really?). When I pointed out that a party of four had been seated at a pair of pushed together two-tops, I got a condescending \"Young man...\" from the host (perhaps the co-owner, though I'm not sure). Clearly this was not a matter of seating rigidity, but rather of greed. \n\nVery disappointing, as I really wanted to try some of the vegetarian dishes.

Two servings of brown rice was too much rice for us- one would have been better. Everything was great- lots of Szechuan pepper in the chicken, fish, and green bean dishes (maybe a little bit too much?) We preferred the chicken to the fish dish. iI was *so good* when we'd get a small piece of ginger that had been fried up with the chicken- a nice, bright and clean counterpoint taste to the vinegar and numbing pepper. Those few ginger pieces seemed accidently and we wanted more of them. Unlike dry fried green beans, the pickled long beans were diced into small pieces, which soaked up more sauce and spice. Since all theses dishes were heavy on the Szechuan pepper, it was a little too much of that numbing effect to have all of these in one meal. The pumpkin was our favorite- because it's so good and also because it was a little sweet and totally different from the other things we ordered. The duck egg yolk coating was not quite as powdery as I've had elsewhere and was really nice with a salty dusting on outer surface. The lava buns had a firm center, not the flowing custard that we expected, and that was disappointing. Overall, great food. \n\nThe service was... \"serviceable.\" Fast enough though not super attentive, nor particularly friendly, which is preferable to forced/faked friendliness. As someone else said, the dining room was very warm on a cool night. You might be more comfortable if you wear removable layers or leave your sweaters at home. The night we went, the crowd wasn't very lively. Since it's small in there, every time my husband made me laugh we drew glances from the other, quieter diners. \n\nMy husband asked about bringing my Chinese dad for dinner, but I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be into it. For the type of food it is, it's much more expensive than the places he would frequent. And, to be blunt, there weren't a lot of Asian people eating here. This is very good Americanized Chinese food. It has better flavor and better preparation that your typical \"take out Chinese,\" but that's the general category I'd place this restaurant in. Well prepared, tasty, and \"safe\" or easy Chinese food, using only the parts of that chicken that were used to eating in the US. Though I'm not planning on bringing my dad, we'll go back for sure.", "author": "M B."}

Had about a 10 min wait when we got there. Seated at about 12:45. We give the server our order card and proceed to wait. After about 45 min of waiting we finally receive our first dish. We think \"maybe the kitchen is understaffed, things will pick up now that the place is emptying out.\" No such luck. We proceed to get one dish about every 15 to 20 minutes. Tables around us all got their food in one go. We even saw people get seated, order, and receive all of their food (some of which we had ordered and were still waiting on!) in the time it took for one dish to get to us. We asked what was going on, and the server gave no explanation. Finally after 2 hours of waiting and 4 plates our still-hungry party of 4 decided to leave and ask for the check. From there we had to argue with the server and get the dishes that we never received taken off the final bill. In all, a really unpleasant experience.

The Place is always busy and the reviews were good. I think the owner or someone related was our server, we told her it was our first time so she started recommending things. Everyone around us had the usual, fried green beans, dim sum, so we decided to be different and go with all her \"house specialty\" recommendations. \n\nWe ended up getting Nam Yu Spare Ribs and Spicy Fish Fillet. The spare ribs resembled Chicken Tikka Masala but more brown, and the fish tasted like hot oil, nothing else. Neither one of them was visually appealing and I actually had to have them remove the fish, it was completely inedible and the fish and tofu together were just mush. I grew up in my parents restaurant so really am not a difficult customer and only say something when it's truly bad.\nWhen I told her we didn't like it she told me how many Chinese people go in there and order it all the time. 1. That will not make me like it. 2. I DOUBT many Chinese people are running to the Castro to Mama Ji's for authentic Fish and Tofu. \nWe then ordered chicken Su mei and she brought us pork because she said the chicken would take too long. \nShe still charged me for the fish then brought us a dessert of a macaroon and oreo, which I can tell you, I am Chinese and those desserts are not typically paired with Chinese  food.\n\nI think if you stick to the basics, dumplings, green beans, chow mein you're fine. Just be careful of the House Specialty's and recommendations.", "author": "Diana L."}

I was quite disappointed after settling on a place in upper market that there were actually few good dining options in the area.  While a burrito or a slice of pizza might be exactly what I want after a night out, there were shockingly few options for a good dinner.\n\nEnter MaMa Ji's.  A newcomer like me here to save the day.\n\nI know this is said many times in reviews below, but the owners and waitstaff are great and really bring a warmth to an admittedly basic space. \n\nForget the space though, I was there for the food.  I went with a couple of friends last night, and can really only echo what others have said.   \n\nThe food was great overall, but I would, if you like spice, to especially focus on the spicy items on the menu.  I had the special fish with tofu and it had just the right level of spice.  The kind that gives just the faintest hint of sweat on your brow, that fills your mouth with a kick, but that does not burn off your tastebuds.\n\nThe other dishes (wonton soup and Mao Po tofu) were equally good, but as I mentioned the spicy dishes are where the restaurant shines.\n\nOne last thing, the prices here are ridiculous.  While they may seem in line with other asian restaurants in the area, that is before they come out and you realise each dish on its own is enough to feed a small family.  I used a bit of the sauce from my dish this morning to add some flavour to  some eggs up and am still able to create an entire additional meal with the leftovers.\n\nSupport this local institution.

We got the spicy cold noodles, bbq pork buns, soup dumplings, the pea sprout shrimp dumplings, and the sesame dessert buns. \n\nSpicy cold noodles: SO AMAZING. I inhaled this. My boyfriend seemed surprised as how peanutty it was but it was divine. I secretly wish they were warm, but when I said that's partner looked at me as if I said something blasphemous. \n\nBbq pork buns: I was not impressed. I've had these homemade for me before, and in my humble opinion they were much better at home. These buns were entirely too sweet (much more than I tasted in the homemade ones) and it threw me off. Also, there was so little meat inside them that I couldn't really taste it. \n\nPea sprout dumplings: delicious!! Big pieces of shrimp and good flavor. \n\nSoup dumplings: not too much soup in them but good flavor. They brought the ginger and mixed it all up with the vinegar, which is apparently the traditional way to eat them. Super yummy!\n\nSesame buns (dessert): very yummy. Super crispy outside, complimented by the lightly sweet red bean paste on the inside. \n\n\nAll in all, a good dim sum brunch experience. We got in and out quickly, food was good, and the whole bill without tip was $27. And I walked out of there stuffed with a doggy bag.", "author": "Emily L."}

There's a much smaller selection of DimSum, no roving carts, about one tenth the size and no huge portrait of MaMa Ji on the wall as you walk in. However, in a number of ways we actually liked it more than Yank Sing. First, we tried several dishes and found every one absolutely delicious!  Then there was the fact that there was no wait for primetime Sunday brunch. Service was quick and courteous; the menu held an extensive selection of Belgian beers and ales as well as a few wines; parking was relatively easy and a major difference: the check was about a third of what it would have been had we dined on similar fare at that other place. So, nothing will ever replace Y.S. but as a delectable (and economic) alternative I highly recommend MaMa Ji's. I know I'll certainly return again and again.", "author": "Joe M."}

One-couple and one-family w/two children (aprox. age: 6yrs old and 3yrs old).\nAt 8 minutes: waitress returns to take our order, but hadn't given us menus.\nAt 10 minutes: I watched waitress hand menus to another party that arrived and was seated after us.\nAt 13 minutes: Waitress brings 2-waters to table (no ice), and makes second trip to drop off menus.\nAt 21 minutes: Waitress returns to take our order (each dish ordered was asked and confirmed to be strictly vegetarian):\n Deep fried spring rolls; Vegetarian pot stickers; Deep fried eggplant; 2-side rice; 1-diet coke\nAt 26 minutes: I was in the restroom washing hands when dinner partner's diet coke arrives in can and full glass of ice (yea!).  He was informed that the house was out of vegetarian pot stickers (waaah-waaah).  Ordered item was replaced with \"bean curd\" something or other.\nAt 30 minutes: Wobbly table was getting on nerves, so I took one napkin and folded several times to place under table leg to secure.\nAt 36 minutes: egg rolls (3) arrived, without silverware.  Silverware was requested.\nAt 39 minutes: another family w/two children (aprox. age: 2yr old; 4mo old with stroller) arrive and are seated at perpendicular table next to ours.\nAt 40 minutes: after flagging waitress, asked for drinking straws, silverware and additional napkin.\nAt 42 minutes: waitress brings sweet and sour sauce for egg rolls to table along with drinking straw, silverware and napkin.\nAt 45 minutes: dinner partner burns mouth and spits bite of piping hot egg roll into napkin.\nAt 50 minutes: child at next table turns around to face our table, and then begins to stare at us while her mother begins to breast feed the younger sibling.  Father picks up a couple of crayons and begins to color in a book, attempting to coax the child back to their table.\nAt 55 minutes: another male waiter brings the tofu dish to the table.  It is cooked in a ground beef sauce.  After examining it for a minute, it becomes apparent to us that the sauce is indeed meat based and we ask for a replacement dish of what we ordered (vegetarian).\nAt 55 minutes: eggplant dish arrives.  The food item resembled battered and deep fried zucchini.  It appeared to be a very dry item, so we thought we would wait for the rest of our meal to arrive before eating.  We later learned that the food item was heavily salted.  Heavily.\nAt 60 minutes: we prompted the waitress for our 2-orders of white rice.\nAt 63 minutes: waitress brings the white rice and quickly runs off (we now had dry white rice and dry fried eggplant before us).\nAt 65 minutes: having no idea how salty the eggplant dish was going to be, we flag male waiter and ask for soy sauce, which he immediately brings.\nAt 68 minutes: the tofu dish finally arrives in a spicy bean sauce, cooked with frozen diced carrots and frozen peas.  The food item was also heavily salted.  Very heavily.\nAt 70 minutes: small children at 3 separate tables are either crying or throwing tantrums.\nAt 75 minutes: a male manager/owner began walking around to all of the tables asking the parties if all was okay.  We overheard another party complain that they had placed their order a while ago and while making the complaint, a waiter brought out their first item.  This manager shortly thereafter arrived at our table to ask if all was okay.  We were speechless and just nodded, \"sure\".\nAt 85 minutes: we were able to finish half of our meal, one diet coke and three glasses of water.  The menu stated \"no msg\", but it was so low in flavor and so heavily salted that we did not ask for a container to take the unfinished portions home (1/2 of the meal).  I have never, not taken \"left over\" food with me, if even to give to a homeless person.\nAt 90 minutes: we paid for the meal and for the duration of our 8 minute walk home, couldn't stop thinking about the poor dining experience.

Pork buns, pot stickers, Lotus leaf rice thing, etc. wonton soup is also good, especially when fighting a cold! Dried fried green beans are excellent. \n\nDim sum portions are stingy. 3 pieces/ order on average. \n\nAvoid the fragrant fish eggplant. Way over spiced and sauced ( no fish at all). It was rated a 1 for mild spice on the menu -- we generally like spicy food and we couldn't eat it.  it was like they doused it in extra spicy Kung pao sauce. Yuck. -1 star for this dish alone.", "author": "J L."}

With the amount of laundry we had, a trek to the Richmond was out of the question, so we decided to order from Mama Ji's via Postmates given the high Yelp rating. We ordered ~6 items. When the order arrived only 2 of the items we ordered were included and we had been charged a lot more than estimates by Postmates. We called Postmates to inquire and after some time on hold, it was determined that Mama Ji's had changed our order because items we selected were not available. I understand that this happens and it's not a big deal, but switching a $5 for a  2 $11 items and then failing to include the more expensive items is shady. We were charged $23 for Seafood Shanghai dumplings which we didn't order, and didn't arrive anyway. The restaurant sent bland veggie egg rolls instead of steamed pork buns. Postmates rectified all of Mama Ji's errors, but this shady place should be avoided.", "author": "Laura G."}

We loved every dish we tried from the turnip cake to the shrimp chive dumplings. It was so good. And where else can you have Ritual Roasters Coffee, choose from 4 belgian beers on tap (no to mention the bottle selection), and Red Blossom tea with delicious dim sum? The location is great, too. It's on a quieter part of 18th, away from the main on a residential block with victorian row houses that makes it all the more San Franciscan.

She's white, I'm Chinese, and we both enjoyed the food a lot.  She's very picky about the Chinese food she eats (she doesn't like what she calls the \"rubbery\" texture of the meat at a lot of Chinese places), but nonetheless liked it, and I'm happy to have a solid Chinese place in the neighborhood.\n\nWe ordered some dim sum:\n- Chicken shu mai\n- Pot stickers\n- Shrimp + rice wrapped in tea leaves\n- BBQ pork bun\n- Shao long baozi (Shanghai dumplings)\n\nWe also ordered the pea leaves sauteed with garlic and tea.\n\nEverything was great, except the pot stickers, which were kind of lukewarm, but the restaurant has just opened and it seems they're still getting the hang of things, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  The BBQ pork bun, in particular, was nice and fluffy and the pea leaves were sauteed to just the right level of tenderness.  The green tea was great and provided a refreshing way wash down the savory dishes.\n\nThis is not the best dim sum you'll ever eat, but it's definitely solid, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a better place in terms of quality and price outside of Chinatown, let alone the Castro.  I hope this place stays open - I'll definitely be back again.", "author": "Beyang L."}

The food has always been a cut above the rest, and the service passable. However, my most recent visit left much to be desired AND the turnip cakes were not up to their usual standards. Whereas before they were impressively fresh (I could taste the turnip) and not oily, this time they were no different than other turnip cakes I've had at other dim sum places. What prompted me to write this review, other than the disappointing lack of consistency of the turnip cakes, was the service. Nobody came to take our order (a piece of paper) for a long time. Our dishes took longer to arrive. Some did not come for a long time, until we asked, twice. In all, I had to flag someone down no fewer than 7 times to get through the meal and out the door. 7 times!

We ordered appetizers around 6:25pm.  7:15pm Nothing came.  People that arrived after us and ordered way after us started getting their food before us.  I mentioned to the owner that i'm very sorry to complain, but people that ordered after us are getting their food before us!  He said it was because we ordered the shrimp chicken shu mai which takes 15 minutes to steam.  It was a lie because we ordered it at 6:25pm. I know the time because i received a text from a friend at 6:30pm, but it was right after we ordered the appetizers.  They simply forgot to put the order in and then tried to lie about it.  This ordeal caused an argument at my table.  My friend got upset at me for saying something even though i was polite about it.  When the appetizer finally came it was after our dinner was ordered although dinner was ordered 15 mins after the appetizer.  After the shitty service, my friend and i got into an argument about how much to tip.  Our bill was 58 dollars and i felt that 63 was more than enough.  My friend wanted to give a normal tip bc he works in the tipping industry, i disagreed (i am one who normally always leaves 25% tip minimum, i've been a waiter before also).  We got into an argument about it.  Ughhhh.  Fuck this place and their shitty service!!!!!!!!", "author": "Brandon P."}

The menu is homey but sophisticated Chinese comfort food and there's a well-considered beer list.\n\nI love the fried turnip cake, the country ribs, and they do a great job with vegetables- especially green beans. My quibble with the dim sum is that like so many restaurants, it's ordinary- the product seems to come from a vendor (Kingdom of Dumpling?) and is completely outshone by the in-house production.\n\nHigh heat levels. If there are three red peppers next to an item on the menu, they mean it. Service can be flaky but always cheerful.", "author": "Rocco P."}

I can't stand the licorice like taste of star of anise so that was disappointing, but the rest of the meal more than made up for that though. \n\nThe two owners, a husband and wife, were very friendly, attentive and personable.

First I was assisted by someone who did not speak English fluently. I guess this was the waitresses assistant. The actual waitress was friendly and mostly available. The manager was visible and checked on the order. But the restaurant looks dirty, old, and out of date and just did not appeal to me. There are many tables crammed side by side in a small space. Meanwhile there is an oversized bar/service area that really has no purpose. The kitchen is behind what looks like a dirty shower curtain. The bathroom was also dirty, small, and looked like someone's apartment bathroom from 1970. There is outdoor seating but there are no heaters.", "author": "L. A."}

About 15 mins in, a waitress came over to take our order. There is a large coffee menu on the table. I asked for a latte(which is on the menu) and she said, \"Oh, I don't want to make that. I don't know how.\". Um, ok... I'll have a water then. Then we ordered various dim sum and she was on her way. The plates started coming but unfortunately every plate the waiter brought was not ours. When we would say it wasn't ours, he would just place in on another table, which of course was not their food either. I saw some dim sum end up at 5 different tables. This went on for the entire meal and it took about 2 hours to complete our order. English was definitely not their strong suit, which is fine, but the lack of organization is dismal!

If you want the real deal (hint: beef broccoli and orange chicken are NOT the real deal), come here. My favorite was the fried pumpkin with salted duck egg. Yummy.", "author": "Caroline T."}

Favorites are sweet rice with shrimp, sausage, and egg in lotus leaf; turnip cake; and steamed BBQ bun. Authentic and value!", "author": "Ken S."}

Pork buns were light and fluffy and the house special spare ribs were fall off the bone tender. The dim sum overall was very impressive given that this used to be a coffee house. The Chongqing chicken was super spicy and perfectly crispy. I will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Sebastian A."}

We went last Saturday evening around 7:00 and were surprised to find the place pretty crowded. One of the owners (\"The White Guy\") greeted us as we sat down and took time to explain each item on the dinner menu. NOTE: This is REALLY helpful as it is often so really understand what some Chinese dishes are! My husband and I don't eat red meat so we stuck to the vegetarian and chicken and fish/seafood dishes. The Hot & Sour Soup--vegetarian--was fabulous and a great way to begin. It's really hard to find a good, vegetarian version of this dish here. We continued with the Ma-Po Tofu, the Chongqing Chicken and one of the fish dishes (can't remember what it was called but it was amazing). The Tofu dish was delicious--large cubes of silky tofu perfectly cooked in a spicy, delicious sauce. I'd never had Chongquing chicken before but I'm a big fan now. It's deep fried and, then, cooked in the wok with lots of Sichuan peppers. Yum. The Castro has really been lacking in decent, let alone really good, Chinese food. I really think that Mama Ji's is going to make up for that\n\nThat said, they really were very busy on Saturday night and the place filled up just after we sat down. But, while there were some service issues--and this is to be expected in a new restaurant--the owner went out of his way to apologize for any lapses in service and even offered us complimentary wine and dessert (a very generous gesture). So, I'm going to be going back again and again for the great food. All new restaurants need a bit of time to get their momentum going. The really good food makes Mama Ji's stand out. Service issues can be fixed! Give it a try--you won't be disappointed!", "author": "Barry W."}

You don't have to like hot but if you do you'll really love some of the choices, this place offers some really impressive \"home style\" dishes that are a refreshing change from other Chinese places. A couple of the most impressive dishes were not hot at all, the chicken won ton soup was full of fresh cabbage in a decent broth and hand-crafted won tons with tons of greens in them - biting into the dumplings was a delight.  The rib main course was also rich in a home cooked style sauce that was a pleasant change from the over-corn starched sauces of other places. Other mains that were impressive were the Chicken with Tofu in a red sauce laden with spices but not too overwhelming.  Beer selection is heavy on craft monk-brewed Belgium ales that go well with the robust flavors. Desserts included a steam dumpling egg custard bun, where the pillow of fluffy white dough encased a tasty real egg custard, and such good value with three puffy balls arriving for a very reasonable price. Good luck to this excellent addition to our somewhat otherwise mediocre food choices in the Castro. Can't wait to try the Dim Sum.", "author": "Bill e."}
