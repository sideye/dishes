My date arrived earlier, and the second I got to the bar, this bartender comes up and asks what I want. I tell her I just got here and haven't looked at the menu. She starts going off about how she doesn't want to keep coming back. And how when she goes to bars, she is respectful and immediately chooses what she wants to order. It was literally crazy. I had been there for like 2 seconds. I was stunned. And she just wouldn't stfu. It was so uncomfortable and out-of-line. I had to tell her I didn't care to hear anymore of her bullshit and to leave us alone. Afterwards, my date told me the first time she came up, she asked her for a drink recommendation and she responded with \"read the description.\" Lady, if you're reading this, you're a bartender. It's your job to take drink orders. Get off your high horse, psycho. You're a shit person who shouldn't work with people, especially in atmospheres that are supposed to be fun. If it bothers you so much, wait more than 30 seconds after someone gets to the bar until you try to take their order. Sorry I was on a date and wanted to actually say hi to her before I decided what I want to drink. Shame cause I could've totally made this my spot, but she totally ruined it.

Andrea, our cheery bartender-ette  was both fun and entertaining!

From the outside, it looks like a total dive bar and any other time I probably would have been a little weary of it. However, I trust him and he's a fan of this place. For a Wednesday night, this place was pretty popular. It's small, but there were probably at least 25-30 people inside. We ordered a couple beers at the bar and went to go find a comfy spot to sit. \n\nThe interior of this place is like a cave! But a tripped out cave! Graffiti everywhere, seating in random places, high back seats at the bar, and a black light by the window. Crazy, right? We found a spot in a cozy booth by the window to chat and drink our beers. Soon afterwards, we noticed a crowd of about 8-10 people sit in the booth next to us. It's a bit hard to describe, but essentially, these booths were completely separated except there was a gap in the partition by the window. So, when leaning up against the window, you could turn to your side and converse with the people in the other booth! The other group had ventured out to get donuts and brought them into the bar -- pretty cool idea. So, somehow we befriended these people and they passed us pieces of the different doughnuts to try.\n\nAs we enjoyed ourselves, the bartender came by to check on us and see how we were doing. When we finished up our drinks, he came by again to see if we wanted another and collected our empty cups. We declined, since we were finishing up for the night, but it was good to see he could handle the place all by himself and still provide great service.\n\nWe bid our new found friends farewell and headed out.\n\nThis place is definitely a cool bar I would go back to in the future.

Dogfishhead 120 minute for $5 for a 6oz pour. It's a sour beer, but it's also 18% and awesome. \n\nBARTENDERS\nSeem to be pretty nice, it's a relatively small bar, but it was easy to order the beers, and I think I saw one of the bartenders actually providing assistance to a young lady asking about which beer was right for her.

They're never too crowded because they're a few doors down from a much more popular bar.  The decorations inside are wild.  I really would love to see this place in the light of day.  Last time I was there, we were all fooled into thinking there was a peep hole-esque window from the bar into the restroom.  Haha, it wasn't what we thought, so don't be concerned, the bathrooms are private - it's just one of the many quirks of the establishment.  I like that they have a really yummy pear cider on tap and a constant stream of fun music.  \n\nSeveral years ago, they hosted a speed dating event that fell through when the event coordinators failed to inform the participants who signed up that they were canceling due to event gender imbalance.  I would venture to say this is not a great venue for an event like this because the lighting is so dim, but a bunch of us stuck around and hung out because we were entertained by the ambience.\n\nThis is definitely a unique bar.

The NocNoc isn't a Zeitgeist with a feigned roughness that adds character or an in your face attitude. This is a place where everyone is welcome.\n\nIt's sad to read yet another obnoxious bitter review on Yelp, but I'm used to seeing this in the later days of Yelp's success.

It had a dark, hippie, rave vibe to it which to me seemed like one giant oxymoron. Some how it kinda worked for them, though...\n\nI walked up to the bar and realized quickly that they didn't serve anything outside of beer and wine. The couple next to me weren't quite as quick to catch on and kept asking for a vodka Red Bull. The bartender repeatedly screamed at them that they they didn't serve vodka Red Bulls which went way over their heads. \"What do you mean? Just pour some vodka and Red Bull together and accept this cash!\" \n\nThat was more entertaining than anything else but the reeealllly annoying thing about this bar were these giant, built in, wood backed stools that were ridiculously inconvenient.

The decor is definitely unique and they have these chairs with a funky high back to them that looked it was taken off the set of the TV old show, \"The Adams Family.\"  The lighting is dim.  Not too dim, but it makes it a bit more of an intimate setting.  Good place to kick up some good dialogue with friends or a date.\n\nThe peeps in their last night were all low key.

Sake and beer as well, but no hard stuff can be found here.  Often the Toronado is just way too crowded and if you don't have the patience to put up with the crap service there, you can usually find a seat at the Noc Noc.\n\nThey have a small DJ cave and I have spun records in it.  Really small, but there's a couple dusty technic 1200s and an older mixer.  What else do you need?  The range of music I've heard in here is quite vast, encompassing just about everything.  The quality control on the DJs is minimal as if you are friends with the owner's son, Sampson or drink and talk with him in there, you could get invited to spin there.  The sound in the place is ambient - it is not a place you go to focus on the music, really more to socialize and drink.\n\nThe decor is wacky and a bit psychedelic.  A unique place to say the least.

That sounds about right.  This is NOT your typical bar.  Doesn't look like it, doesn't feel like it.  And those ubiquitous domestic lagers are conspicuously absent.  Instead, you will find umpteen imported and domestic beers, ales and ciders on tap, and a nice selection in the bottle, including a number of Belgian and Belgian-style ales.  Wine and sake are also available, but no hard liquor.\n\nThe furniture, the bar, and just about everything else are works of art and craft created by various folk from the original Japanese fellow who opened the place, to friends and family of the present owner.  Noc Noc is a work in progress.\n\nThe vibe here varies depending on the night of the week.  On weekend evenings it can get quite crowded and the crowd is mostly young and hip.  During the week, the regulars dominate, but for the most part, they don't bite.  If you are open to a new adventure, come on in.  Then again, if you are the sort who gets nervous in a place that doesn't resemble anyplace you've been before, maybe you're not ready for Noc Noc.\n\nCaveats:  Art as furniture may not be comfortable for people with back problems or other physical limitations.  The place is accessible, but accessible and comfortable are two different things.  Street parking in this neighborhood is extremely challenging (see my reviews of other local businesses for more), but it's well served by the Muni.\n\nDISCLOSURE:  I am not and have never been employed here, nor do I have an interest in the business.

I could be mis-remembering this, but I also could be remembering correctly.\n\nAside from this \"mebbe I went there once\" time I have not been to Noc Noc again until last night.  And, I didn't even have a drink there last night.\n\nLet me explain why - considering I may or may not have been to this establishment during operating hours and have never bought or been served a drink there - that Noc Noc gets FIVE stars (ten, if I could give it ten.)\n\nPicture this:\nBig Saturday party somewhere in the Mission.  Party ends, no one can get cabs.  There is one sober guy (Fong you rule) amongst a sea of drunks.  The sober guy takes pity on me - who really just wants to go home and go to bed, as opposed to continuing to party as everyone else seems inclined to do - and, says \"I'll give you guys a lift to X place where you - girl who wants to go home - can catch a cab back to the Avenues; and, you - three people who want to continue to party - can continue to party... but, FIRST I need to stop for some food.\"\n\nFair enough, sober guy with the car gets food.  Totally kosher with everyone.  Apparently, less kosher with the universe, as the first pizza place we try is closed.  McDonalds is closed.  Popeye's is closed (we actually didn't check - we just went on the assumption that if McDonalds on Haight was closed, Popeye's would be too.)  There is no Taco Bell with in a thirty mile radius (which is probably a good thing.)  At this point we are seriously considering either the Lucky Penny or eating one of the people in the car.\n\nThen we find that  [Insert Name of Pizza Place Here] next to Noc Noc is open.  So sober, hungry driver and drunk, hungry friends jump in line to grab a slice and I go in search of a bathroom, as all the vodka and cranberry juice from the previous evening of partying is causing me to dance around like a five year old doing the pee-pee dance.\n\nEXCEPT: It's almost three in the morning and EVERYTHING except for the pizza joint is closed.\n\nI am about to cry, I have to go so badly, when I see the door to Noc Noc is still ajar.  I timidly knock (shut up) on Noc Noc's door and say, \"Hey would it be okay if I came in to use the bathroom real quick?\"\n\nI fully expect a \"Fuck no, drunk girl who has to pee, we're closed.\"  But, instead - like a gift from God, Allah, the Earth Goddess or whatever you believe in - I hear the voice of Rahmat (the owner of the bar) saying, \"Sure, go ahead.\"\n\nNot only does Rahmat let ME use the bathroom; but, he lets two of my drunk friends who are also doing the pee-pee dance use the bathroom.\n\nRahmat is the most AWESOME person on the face of the planet.\n\nI promise you, I will be returning to Noc Noc and giving them my business (once I'm done with the whole three months of sobriety thing) as the awesomeness of Rahmat indicates that it will be a choice place to hang out.", "author": "Kate R."}

I cut my drinking teeth at noc noc. I also learned a whole lot about music from one of the DJs there. In '97 there was no better place for an awkward music geek. \n\nIt had been about 10 years to the day since I'd set foot in there. At first glance, very little has changed; Dark as ever, same arty 80s music video decor, still beer & wine only, the same blend of electronic & avant garde from the DJ booth. I think Rahmat is still running the place too.\n\nBut some things have changed, for sure. The couches are cleaner, the bartenders aren't as friendly as they used to be, and the homeless guy with his dreads on a stick isn't milling around offering to tell tourists 'the story' for a few bucks.

There's a lot art, the furniture is great--specially the bar stools. \n\nThe Ambiance: Good, interesting people. It's the type of place where if you're there, you probably have something in common with the person next to you. All the people are alternative in some way--punk, hipster, goth, mod, nerd you name, it's here.\n\nThe Service: Very casual, just how I like it. \n\nThe Drinks: This is the part that makes me sad.

So consider this an anti-Yelp Yelp. \n\nThis place is always chill, there is always a table open. People are allowed to bring their dogs and food in - nobody cares. The crowd is always salt of the earth, LH style. The happy hour has $3 drafts. Mythic pizza is next door and you can bring slices in as stated above. It represents Lower Haight to a tee.\n\nThe music is the best part. It is seriously eclectic and good. Every single time I go there I hear tracks that bring back memories - the good underground tracks - everything from ambient to experimental to metal and punk. You cannot see the DJ's because they are hidden away in their little pod getting stoned. Don't even think of making a request because they will kill you.\n\nThe space, as mentioned before, is one of the most unique spaces in San Francisco for sure, and possibly in the US. It is straight out of Blade Runner meets Aliens meets Mad Max meets the Flintstones on acid. It is dark and dingy and weird and you feel like you are in some underwater world in the post apocalyptic future. \n\nActually, I take it back; the part about the anti-Yelp Yelp.

Seriously though, this place kind of trips me out.  \n\nSo let's pretend you aren't really looking at the design, like maybe you haven't been drinking for the past 3 months and you're coming to Noc Noc for your first beer.  I give this place credit for having excellent beers on tap, and even more credit for having some really good bottled beers (Duvel, Delerium), not to mention they don't charge you ridiculous amounts of money for them.  While I realize it can be construed as pretentious, I did enjoy that the sign near the front of the bar said something to the effect of \"No Miller!  No Bud! No Coors!  Try something new!\"  They also carry some St. Peter's brews, which are delicious (i recommend the organic ale) and come in 16.9 oz bottles.\n\nOn the flipside, I'm not crazy about the design.  Maybe I'm not artsy enough.  I find a lot of the seating undesirable for a conversation with a group bigger than 4 unless you happen to nab one of the few seating areas that would be good for that size group.  Otherwise you end up in weird positions where maybe two people are sitting while everyone else avoids blocking the walkways in the bar.

Live DJ spinning actual vinyl (not a macbook), tucked away in a tiny cave in the back. \n\nAs someone who isn't overly into dance music nowadays, I still really enjoyed my time here. We found a place to sit, never had to stand shoulder to shoulder, bumped elbows, or had drinks spilled on us like most other respectable bars on a Friday night. We sat in a booth area in the back but noticed cushions for floor seating next to us and traditional bar stools around the middle. \n\nThe interior decor is a little Fred Flintstone discovers a black light. As the night lingered on, the crowd went from sparse locals to a bit of an SF State crowd. \n\nExcellent beer and sake selection.

However, Noc Noc made such a positive impression on me that I feel the need to post a review, after I stopped in while on a trip to San Francisco.  It has quite possibly the coolest, weirdest bar decor I've ever seen.  A Japanese artist apparently designed the interior, and it reminded me of the waiting area for the next great Disneyland ride.  While other yelpers have adequately described the interior, I'll give the bizarre innards of this pub my best shot:  it looks like a spaceship crashed into a hobbit hole deep within the forest, and the hobbits worked around the wreckage to create a cool bar and lounge featuring the most eccentric art they could find.  The beer list is top notch (I love their sign that indicates no Coors Light or PBR is served), and during my visit, they had not one but two sour beers on tap.  Laura (Lara?) was my bartender on the Sunday night I spent within Noc Noc's comforting embrace, and I must say she was one of the friendliest, most knowledgeable bartenders I've yet encountered.

Besides wine and beer, they serve sake, and if you smoke, you can smoke in there, too, although I didn't see anyone smoking last time I was there so they may have cracked down on that.

Because this joint is so unique and unlike any other place here in SF, I give it a well deserved 5 stars. No more smoking allowed indoors however, you'll have to join the bums outside for a cig or head over to Amber.

And when you see the furniture, you'll realize that you have to be a little bit odd to fit in here.  Erich von Daniken meets 1,000,000 BC might be the most apt description.  Throw in a bit of another famous Swiss loony, H R Giger, and you've got Noc Noc's decor pinned.  A live DJ and no jukebox, no mainstream American beers, and no booze are some of the other more obvious non-decor related unique selling points.  The bar staff are exemplary, the regulars are fascinating.  My only complaint, more related to Lower Haight than Noc Noc per se, I guess, is that the bar's character changes completely over the weekend when large numbers of youngsters descend upon it with the sole intention of getting completely plastered.  But it's at times like those that you'll appreciate the presence of the other regulars, and you can all hunker down and complain about the youth of today ... ;-)", "author": "Daen d."}

I mean that in an entirely good way, cave like feel, with lots of detail, patterns, textures and lots of nooks to chill. I commend the brave and TOTALLY unique design of the bar. The feel of the bar is def a local tight knit group of people that know each other by name. The patrons are extremely friendly have a sheek, urban, hipster feel, willing to make a toast to a stranger and converse. Beer and wine alcohol only, but I was impressed by the web site's descriptions of their unique specialty drinks. I'm hoping i caught the bartender on an off day because he really lacked in salesmanship skills. I informed him its my first time at this bar and told him I'll try anything. Trying to pull information about what to try seemed to annoy and tire him so I gave up and settled for the snakebite. Did I say settle? It was really no settle, it was fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Oh, and DJ HopAroundFromGenretoGenre? Stick to a flavor. Part of being a good DJ is following a groove. Going from trip hop to gabber back to drum and bass just sounds like fucking noise. I did give it an extra star because they have Speakeasy Big Daddy IPA on tap. For that they even get a little tickle behind the ear.", "author": "Mick F."}

It remains one of the all time great bars in San Francisco and for no good reason reminds me of a David Bowie concert, circa high school.  Last time I was there, someone I went to college with came up to me and said, \"you look just like Laurel B., but you are too young to be Laurel B.\"   Sigh.  The end of a perfect evening.   (I don't think he was drunk.)  That was the night that the BF and I had a business dinner with his colleague from Australia, we went to RNM but the BF bailed because an arsonist set fire to the building next to his, and his apartment building caught on fire.  Rising to the occasion, alone but valiant, I entertained business colleague in fine style (cocktails, wine, heard all the secret work gossip) (!), and we wound up at the Noc Noc.  BF:  not so happy when I got back home.  Something about a fire, and what was I doing out with some other guy until 2 a.m.?  So much for self-sacrifice.  But the Noc Noc was as great as ever.    And the firm paid.  For it all.", "author": "Laurel B."}

Entertaining at the very least, although I think it would be a terrifying place to stagger through drunkenly. The beer selection is good, and they seem to cycle through varieties pretty quickly so it's always interesting. The mixed drinks they have are pretty creative, although I'm not going near the Sake and Redbull any time soon. Totally worth a visit.", "author": "Carl T."}

THIS PLACE IS THE SHIT!. i mean live music everyday and the atmosphere is perfect! yeah it was owned by some japanese guy before but now its totally different. the atmosphere it great, just some place you want to chill with a couple of buddies. the bartenders are awesome and really chill when you get to know them. basically they serve the best Belgium beer and if you need a break from Toronados, hit up Noc Noc's and feel like your at home with the super inviting staff. 5 out of 5 stars!", "author": "kenneth L."}

It looks like an aspiring artist was awake for 72 hours, went to the junk yard, went to Noc Noc and started hammering stuff on the wall and ceiling from the junk yard.  When we first arrived there were \"normal\" songs i.e. N.E.R.D, Kanye, etc....then they started playing angry metal/electronica and some girl in a long bohemian skirt started twirling around non stop and dancing by the door like she was on acid.", "author": "LT B."}

I've been going to this cave for so long I don't even see what people are talking about anymore.  Cave?  Psychadellic? Dark and Loud?  I keep forgetting why I liked going there in the first place.  I guess there's a reason I've been going there for almost five years without fail on what was almost a daily basis, then weekly, and now that I'm out of the neighborhood, about monthly (and why my room is so dark and cluttered and booze-filled).  But it's worth the ride on the bus.  Nothing like stinking of Liberty and smoke rolling back into a neighborhood in which I might be shocked to find someone trying to steal my sparkplugs right out of my bike then have a \"good natured debate\" on classicism and the ideologies of ownership.  It's wierd, baby.  But I'll be back.  Just like how you can't keep a good dog in the grave, I'll come crawling back just to see the joyous old faces of yonder years that'll outlive me, no doubt, because I'm stupid for having ever left a part of myself there.", "author": "Roy M."}

Despite it's abscence of liquor, Noc Noc serves delicious beer cocktails amid it's great selection, along with quite a variety of sake. The decor, which is probably what this place is most notorious for, would probably look like a David Lynch movie shot in a cave. The bartenders are super chill, in contrast to their nextdoor neighboors at Toronado. The DJs play an eclectic selction of tunes, and its actually possible to carry on a conversation with the diverse crowd.
