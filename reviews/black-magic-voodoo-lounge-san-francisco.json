{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-02", "description": "I won't hold the fact that this spot is a Saints Bar against it.  But, since I have the opportunity, I would like to point out that the Saints are a bunch of cheating little ******* for deliberately targeting Brett Favre with cheap shots during the NFC Championship game.  Yep, they got busted, but they got to party with Mr. Lombardi.  Me, I got more heartbreak.  I've never seen a Saints game here, but I plan to come and talk all sorts of trash about my absolute least favorite team in the NFL.  The Saints were ridiculous cheaters in 2009/2010 - They should have lost their rings. \n\nThat's feels better.  Now, that one unfortunate fact aside, it's a cool bar.  I've got nothing against New Orleans itself.  There is a New Orleans theme to the decor here, but other than that it's hard to see much evidence in terms of the drinks, music, etc.  They do have one beer from Abita.  I'm primarily a beer drinker, and I'm not blown away with the tap list - they could use at least one higher ABV IPA beyond regular Lagunitas.  It's kind of a small bar and it's all in the one area - there's no quiet corner to hide.  The decor is pretty cool and they have a nice juke-box.  I've been impressed with the bartenders across the board - not because of any mixology prowess, they just seem like a cool group of people that help build the community of regulars that makes a bar more than just a place to grab a beer and watch sports.  That is what brings it up from a 3 to a 4.      \n\nThe location itself is also an asset.  You're in the confluence of the Cow Hollow, Marina, Russian Hill and Fisherman's Wharf.  Corner of Van Ness and Lombard.  As you are making your way from one district to the next, it's sort of at the crossroads.  It's opens reasonably earlier and stays open all the way until bar close.  There are a lot of motels/hotels very close, so you'll find this a reasonably friendly spot if you're visiting from elsewhere.  And, if you happen to be coming back, it's a good place for a \"final final\" before calling it a night.\n\n(Pro Tip:  Viking's Giant Subs is next door and they are open until 8:30pm - you're fine to bring in food if you'd like to grab a sandwich as you are enjoying your afternoon or early evening drink.)", "author": "Adam S."}

Literally felt like I was back in New Orleans when I came here to watch the Saints. Everyone in here had Saints gear on. They don't serve food, but are fine with you bringing in your own food. Someone even brought in Popeye's making it feel even more like New Orleans. On any other day it seems like it would just be a cool neighborhood bar to get some drinks in.

It is an authentic Louisianan bar (which sells Abida Beer and the best Bloody Marys) that tries to spread their southern love by keeping their drinks high quality and their prices low ($4.00 for an authentic southern spicy Bloody Mary). :)\n\nThe ambiance is also great. Most of the patrons, especially during Saints Sundays, have connections to or are originally from Louisiana. This gives the bar a unique feel, almost like you have traveled into New Orleans.   \n\nHowever, the thing that surprised me the most was the friendliness of the crowd and the bartenders. The bartenders go out of their way to make your drink exactly how you like it. They will personally deliver the drink to your table if they believe that they will take too long to make it.  Also, on a more personal note, we were getting a little hungry so we asked the bartender where there was a good pizza place nearby. He recommended a place that delivered, he then ordered the food for us, gave us paper plates and napkins, and then periodically checked on us to see if we were enjoying the food. I have never seen a bartender make such an effort to make their customers feel as comfortable as possible.   \n\nThus, if you are looking to experience Louisianan culture/friendliness at its finest, then I would highly recommend that you check this bar out (especially during a Saints game).", "author": "Scott E."}

I had my birthday party here in mid April - and I couldn't get over the fact that there was such a great dive nestled in the Marina.\n\nThe club was great... especially with the old world New Orleans vibe. It was the perfect venue to accommodate my Black Magic Voodoo Vixen theme. I was at first worried about the size of the club. But they had a great seating arrangement against the wall, so we all fit in perfectly!\n\n The bartender was very friendly, and he knew exactly what he was doing when it came to a good NOLA Hurricane and Sazarac. They had a Kubler Absinthe Fountain, and I was served Absinthe the traditional way, with not sugar cube muss and fuss. \n\nOverall I had a really great experience with the Black Magic Voodoo Lounge. Affordable brew, a great NOLA vibe, and Absinthe done just right. I would definitely pop back in for NOLA time soon!", "author": "Elizabeth L."}

The Black Magic has Molson on tap, and Pabst; that should tell you a lot about its vibe.  Every time I've been here there was available seating at the bar or at one of the tables.  Excellent jukebox.\n\nThe bar staff usually has some sporting event on the TV, but neither the tube nor the music overpowers the room.  You can converse without straining yourself regardless of the media.  That can be rare in the Marina.\n\nThis is also one of a handful of bars where people occasionally smoke inside and nobody seems to care.  It makes this place seem like a throwback to a different time, which adds to its relaxing feel.", "author": "John E."}
