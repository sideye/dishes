This place hosts a free comedy night every Tuesday so it's a great day to go there and grab a pizza with friends and listen to some really stellar comedy (better than any other free shows I've been to).\n\nI tried both the margarita and marinara pizzas and both are great. The Margherita is thin but cheesy enough and the crust is extremely crispy. The sauce is extremely tasty as well. The marinara pizza is incredible. I'm not a huge fan of pizzas without cheese, but this pizza is an exception. The sauce is super flavorful and goes great with the crust. They also sell pitchers of ros\u00e8 and white wine and have tons of options for pizzas, making it a great place to go!", "author": "Sampath D."}

My favorite of the night, especially if you're craving savory meats.\n\nSALAD\n* Intermezzo ($7.36 medium) - 3 stars\nThis was fine, nothing to go out of your way for. I didn't particularly feel like a salad but people liked this so I ordered it, but I found there were too many chicories, giving it a pretty bitter flavor. \n\nPIZZA\n* Margherita ($13.79) - 3.5 stars\nGood classic pizza. Could've used with a little less oil, a little more tomato sauce. \n\n* Rocket Man ($15.63) - 3.5 stars\n I was excited for an arugula pizza, but the lemon juice was a bit much.\n\n* Short Bridge ($17.47) - 4 stars\nVery delicious meat pizza!

I heard that the mother dough is from Tartine and I believe it. It's a thin crust that has the perfect amount of chewiness and flavor without tasting like card board or Costco pizza.\n\nThe Rocket Man is a go-to for me. The arugula that is lightly tossed in a vinaigrette compliments the garlic, fresh mozzarella, farm egg, lemon juice, chili paste and amplifies the crust (subtle sourdough taste, nice balance of chewy and crisp).

We go out for pizza because sometimes you just don't want to crank up the oven to 550F and bake your entire house (and for some 'industrial espionage' culling tips from the pros all over the pizza planet). Pizza Hacker came to our neighborhood and we have been converting friends and family to PzaHckr denizens whenever we don't have our own dough growing at home.\n\nPizza Hacker is top notch along side Tony's, Capo's, those NY Patsy's and Grimaldi's and better than John's, and we think superior to una pza napo. (Now that they're gone, why bother talking about them anyway). Hacker's sauces stands shoulder to shoulder with the best Nancy Silverton would make, harvested from Early Girl Tomatoes bringing this POW! The pepperoni on the Ohio has so much flavor, cups and miraculously doesn't issue an oil puddle you would find under an old Chevy with a leaking transmission. (They even shared the secret of their pep source). Tangy sauce and pepperoncini make a wondrous pizza. We've tried them all, lately we keep going back to Ohio.\n\nPizza Hacker likes to cook until their crust is stiff enough to support the toppings and get a fair amount of char on the crust. The dough tastes good, with a little yeast and some of that SF sour, but just a touch.\n\nBeer choices rotate, usually an IPA, a saison or sour, a kolsch or something light on tap. Wine and sodas too.\n\nAlways love the Intermezzo salad. Reminds us of the old days getting lunch at the Owl and Monkey. Very fresh and full of colorful beans and roots, and well tossed. The Kale Caesar is great too.\n\nPrices are fair, even pretty reasonable for San Francisco. What's to complain about? Communal tables shared with kids maybe, sometimes you have to wait, but turnover is pretty good. People who do not believe Pizza Hacker executes deliciously probably believe The Love Boat was the greatest show ever broadcast, IOW, they have little taste of substance and might be happier at \"Yard of Pizza for One Dollar\" strip mall chains. That's cool, they can go elsewhere so we can enjoy this good stuff.\n\nPizza Hacker, keep doing it like you mean it!", "author": "Jibber J."}

They use a sourdough for the pizza base which pairs very well with their thin crust style pizzas. The pizzas are crispy with just the right amount of chewiness and a slight tangy flavor that just works. I'm a fan of thin crust pizza so this place is high on my list of pizza places. The pizza selections are pretty simple, they have a handful of signature pizzas. I recommend the short bridge and the rocket man. The short bridge is a their take on a pepperoni sausage and mushroom, they of course use fancier toppings but it's the same idea. Very tasty and well balanced for sauce cheese and toppings. What really surprised me was the rocket man, typically I don't like egg or arugula on my pizza but this one worked. The rocket man has a fresh egg, arugula, garlic, lemon, and fresh mozzarella. The crispy chewy crust really works well with the flavors of lemon and garlic and the nuttiness of the arugula pairs well with the mozzarella and egg. I don't like to deviate from the typical pizza but this one was good. The staff are friendly and welcoming and the place is very casual.

The salad contained large leafy greens and a strong poppyseed dressing. I liked the idea of little gems and farm eggs but those were hard to find. \n\nNext we had the Crowd Pleaser which I was really excited about because of the prosciutto! When the pizza finally came, there was only prosciutto on one half of the pizza... We were slightly confused. After telling the waitress, they kindly put more prosciutto on the other half of the round! whoot! But sadly that was the only good part of the pizza. The bottom was mildly burnt and the greens made the entire bite taste completely bitter. Maybe we should've said something? But I assumed this is what the crowd is asking for. Can't complain about what we are being pleased with! \n\nLastly we had the Heavy Nettle. I just wanted the lamb meatballs and the stracciatella (since I thought that it only came in an ice cream form). This time, the pizza was baked perfectly and the meatballs and other ingredients were a beautiful compliment to the thinly baked dough. I was super happy with this one.\n\nPizzaHacker are for the right minded people that are evolving from the ordinary combo pizza.", "author": "Linda K."}

I love the combination of the lemon, arugula, and pandano. the only thing that sucks is that it's really hard to split the egg because it's just on once slice of the pizza.\n\nOverall, it was good pizza.

Something that will hit that [sweet] spot and make me groan with incredible satisfaction. You know, pizza. A piping hot slice of cheeselicious pizza at 3 am always hits the spot right?\n\nSoft opening 3 weeks ago, Pizza Hacker's brick and mortar (formerly Incas) finally came into fruition after years at Dolores Park and popping up at Vinyl Coffee & Wine Bar baking pizza from a makeshift pizza oven using a Weber Grill. How cool is that?\n\nI never got to try their pizza but since Pizza Hacker's new spot is just several minutes away from me, now was my chance. \n\nThe chalkboard menu is small with just one salad and five pizza options: http://bit.ly/1fi0rvL. I don't mind small menus since it allows the chef(s) to select the best seasonal ingredients and perfect the few dishes they offer well.\n\nAll pizzas are a very reasonable $15 which includes tax. They also have one red and one white wine  ($8/glass, $30/bottle), 4 beers ($5/glass, $27 pitcher), and sodas ($3). CC's accepted.\n\nPizza Hacker is family friendly since there's picnic tables (communal seating); right to be exact and a chalk board for kids to scribble on while they await their pie: http://bit.ly/1dB8oJl. If you find yourself having to wait for a table, hit up Rock Bar (owned by Front Porch) down the block for some drinks: http://bit.ly/1avgubW. \n\nThe staff is incredibly friendly. It was our waiter's first day and he did a great job and promptly taking and delivering our order. \n\nI'm four reviews behind on my pizza reviews but Pizza Hacker is a step below Delfina's for me. My top five picks are still Una Pizza Napolatana, Pizzetta 211, Baonecci, Tony's and A16 (pending review).\n\nMaybe I choose the wrong pizza but I felt the Intermezzo Salad ($8) outshined my pizza: http://bit.ly/1mCiTBD. The salad was ginormous and was enough to feed 4-5 people. All the ingredients were uber fresh and dressed in a deliciously savory and nicely tangy poppy seed dressing. I loved the garbanzo and kidney beans for a meaty bite. Definitely one of the best salads I've had!\n\nFor my pizza, I decided to go with the Crowd Pleaser w/ Radicchio, mission figs, bleu cheese, balsamic, fresh mozzarella & rosemary ($15) since it got rave reviews from their previous Yelp reviews: http://bit.ly/19SdlCF. Plus, I'm a sucker for savory and sweet pairings. Sometimes less is more and which this was the case with the crowd pleaser as it was overwhelmed with radicchio and balsamic vinegar making the pizza too bitter and sour for my liking. The middle was immediately soggy as a result too. \n\nBeing the carniwhore that he is, Mr. NSS for the Yo Vinny: Marinated onions, goat horn peppers, 4505 hot Italian sausage, tomato sauce & fresh mozzarella ($15): http://bit.ly/1e1fJGw which I favored over the Crowd Pleaser. Everything was well balanced with a good amount of oooeeey goooey cheese and a spicy porkiness from the sausage. \n\nNow the reason why I can't rank Pizza Hacker in my top 5s is because of the crust which truly is a matter of preference. What makes Pizza Hacker's crust unique is it's sprinkled with smoked sea salt for that extra bite of flavor. However, I felt the crust was too carb heavy for me as I prefer a more light and crackly, thin crust.  Also I couldn't get over the immediate sogginess with the Crowd Pleaser. \n\nNext time, I'm going with the Rocket Man which is topped with a farm egg. Maybe that will change my mind. Nothing quite gets me going like the sight of oozing yolk porn....", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I was ecstatic when they opened up a store front in Bernal a couple months back. I finally made my way over there and was disappointed by the pizza; however, the value / price is amazing. I would return just because I feel like I ordered the wrong thing....\n\nTips:\n- They don't do 2 flavors on one pie. You can modify ingredients (for a cost).\n- One pie is 6 slices, can serve 2 people who aren't super hungry because the crust is decently thick for thin crust.\n\n* ROCKET MAN ($15.63) - 3 STARS:\nArugula, Garlic, Fresh Mozzarella, Farm egg, lemon juice, chili paste. (+Sausage). The crust is thin but thick enough to have a nice and chewy bite, but I felt that there wasn't enough toppings and flavor to balance it out. It was a bit flavorless, despite it being doused generously with oil and roughly cut garlic. The most disappointing thing was that the egg was completely hard and overcooked. \n\n* CABERNET SAUVIGNON ($19.31) -  3 STARS:\nY+B - Cabernet Sauvignon - Lodi - 2011.

Thanks for shaking my disbelief, Pizzahacker. \n\nMy fiancee and I are food snobs in our own right. She's really into freshness and flavor, and I'm obsessed with food pairings (i.e. Cilantro+Avocado+Lime). We ordered three pizzas - the Yo Vinny!, \"Top Shelf\" Margherita, and the Rocket Man - and, goodness gracious, it was awesome. There's a lot of good food in the Bay Area but there's something really special about this place. Everything tastes homemade and in the good way. The really good way. Behind us were shelves of onions, peppers, and olives that they were marinating/pickling.. They make the cheese fresh every two days. The chorizo (which is the best I've ever had) is imported from Spain. There's a lot of shortcuts you can take in food preparation, for both convenience and cost, and Pizzahacker totally disregards that and serves you handcrafted love. \n\nRyan, our server, was the man. Not only was he super friendly and helpful, he was a blast to talk to and he genuinely wanted us to try how good his restaurant's pizza was. Here are Ryan's recommendations and they will blow your mind: 1) Get the \"Yo Vinny!\" with Spanish chorizo and use the fresh chili sauce at the table. 2) Get the \"Rocket Man\" with an extra farm egg.

The menu is written up there, semi permanently with seasonal specialities which usually puts a twist on the classics such as the Margherita.\n\nThe open kitchen is at the far end, with a large pizza oven.  It's not one of those brick ovens or the large ovens with each brick hand laid from Italy-nothing fancy.  It's an industrial size one that I've seen at other places like Goia or Arinell's.  I'm not perturbed by the sight.  I'm not a pizza purist like the Una Pizza Napoletana's owner - I accept that variations in pizza cooking styles are as variable as each handcrafted pie.  They're good when they're honestly made, with precision, and love.\n\nMy favorite is the Yo Vinny.  The pickled horn peppers and the marinated onions forms a great kinship of sweet and spicy, with the slight subtle sting of the hot Italian sausage.  The tomato sauce, made from organic, heirloom tomatoes are usually Early Girl tomatoes of which the sweetness marries well with the fresh mozzarella.  \n\nA close second is the Short Bridge, a second cousin of the Yo Vinny, with Fra'mani Sopressata, mushrooms, dried oregano, and grana padano.  I was a little skeptical of the oregano which didn't seem to belong on the pie but it lent an herbaceous nuance to the pie that I imagine what a nana's tomato sauce would taste like.  \n\nThe pies come out quickly, blistered and slighted charred, leopard skinned, with small hills and valleys.  A perfectly symmetrical pie, a la Domino's or Pizza hut style it is not.  The crust maintains its crisp crackle but eat it quickly as it doesn't last long under the weight of the voluminous toppings.  I'm usually a two slicer myself, but faced with such a beauty, I happily inhale half of the pie.  Thank goodness it's sooo thin!\n\nA jar of calabrian peppers is at each table, available at Bi-Rite according to the waitress, an indulgence that is in accordance to their religion that is to create the perfect pie but a surprise when you consider the price of such pie.  For such quality ingredients and product, the prices are definitely a bargain for the Bay area, heck, for any area.", "author": "Betty T."}

Having heard of the FranenWeber pop ups, but me not wanting to be out and about after midnight, I was happy to see a brick and mortar for pizza.  Let's face it, if you know this area there is not much decent pizza nearby.  One may be fine for kids, and the other was very good a dozen + years ago, pizza pickings are slim.\n\nI've tried just about every pizza offered, but usually fall back to my standard Top Shelf Margherita or Yo Vinny, my favorite being the Yo Vinny.  It is something about those marinated peppers.  I always add a hefty dose of the chili paste.  Toppings may be sparse, but that is the nature of a good pizza.  I don't want tons of cheese or toppings; I want quality ingredients bringing everything together.  That's what you get at PizzaHacker.  Thin crust, properly charred in an electric oven that reads 666 degrees.\n\nAn Intermezzo salad is available with poppy seed dressing, but ask for croutons.   Beer and wine are available, but I usually opt for water.  Some pizzas are added as toppings come into season.\n\nNot much in atmosphere, as tables consist of park tables and benches with chairs scattered.

But when I arrived on a Thursday evening for dinner we practically had our pick of tables. The place was only half full.\n\nWe ordered the top shelf 'marg' and the heavy nettle pizzas. The top shelf 'marg' was absolutely amazing! I'm not sure how they do it but the combination of melted cheese and tomato created this creamy mouthfeel and wonderfully satisfying flavor. I took a bit and immediately thought this is what comfort food is all about. Looks and sounds really simple but they've managed to elevate it to something else - doesn't even deserve to be in the same category as standard margherita pizzas. The heavy nettle pizza was good but in my mind not as amazing as the top shelf 'marg'.\n\nBoth pizzas were big for personal pizzas. Ideally 2 pizzas could be shared between 3 people.\n\nService was good but inattentive.

I can live with the trade-off in cool and cocktails to get my food right away.\n\n*** NOTE: if you pay by credit card the total shown on Square includes tax and if you auto calculate tip it will be calculated on that total - if that matters to you 18% on the total is around 20% on the food only.", "author": "Jean K."}

I was not impressed -- the tomato sauce was under-seasoned and lacked deeper umami taste.  My dining companion thought that the crust was not very satisfying because it did not have those slight chewiness developed with yeast.  Their ingredients tasted all very fresh -- and I enjoyed the combination of arugula and egg in Rocket Man, but I did not taste any lemon that was supposed to be one of ingredients in Rocket Man.\n\nAlthough staff there were friendly and courteous, there was some issues with services.  The first pizza arrived reasonably quickly, but we waited another 15+ minutes to get the second pie.

He was super bummed about it since it was a Saturday night and they just opened but he said his buddy had a place called PizzaHacker \"with the same kind of dough\" \n\nWe sat around in our car looking at yelp for other options and 20 options later we ended with PizzaHacker -___- Should've just gone with it to begin with! We drove to Bernal Heights (it was crackin that night! WTF a line to get in everywhere. Whats happening to this neighborhood?!) and after finally finding parking, we still entertained ourselves with different options. We looked at BluePlate but I didn't like their menu and tried to get a table at the new ICHI location but there was a two hour wait (dafuq) so again, PizzaHacker it was!\n\nThis place is communal seating only and its decorated with christmas lights and high ceilings so I felt like I was eating outside the whole time! They also have a chalk board wall that anyone can draw on and an open kitchen and very small bar area. \n\nWe got the top shelf margherita (only 20 made a day!) and considered getting a salad. Their salad was $10 so our fat logic concluded we could practically get another pizza for that price so two pizzas it was! We got the Spinach Man 3? and that was by far my favorite. My boyfriend knew I would like it as soon as he bit into it because it was spicy aka way too spicy for him so he practically ate the entire marghertia himself. We were talking about how we could eat the leftovers for breakfast the next day BUT THERE WERE NO LEFTOVERS! I wasn't even hungry and I ate an entire pizza to myself. My bottomless pit of a stomach has won again. \n\nWe got two glasses of the blend aka the cheapest wine they have on the menu. They also have bottles, carafes, and beer. The wine looked like a bigger serving than usual but it might've been an illusion to satiate my alcoholic eyes. \n\nA mexican band randomly walked in and started playing music and I was rocking out too hard to not tip them when they walked around with their little plastic bag to all the tables.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-11", "description": "I know, I know. I'm kind of bringing down the mood in the PizzaHacker review feed, raining on the proverbial parade. But hear me out - if the good people behind this place (and in front of it, for that matter) this pick up what I'm layin' down, beautiful things could happen here. \n\nI'm not a local - in fact I was a good 2,000 miles from home when I walked into PH. So I got the scoop on its background from the friends I was dining with, and suddenly it all made sense: PizzaHacker was the product of a food truck putting on the breaks and taking up a less mobile home in this space. The problem is - that's exactly what it feels like. \n\nOn a food truck, the emphasis is on creating memorable, craving-inducing street eats. It also can't hurt to be friendly with those who wander up to your truck to create a sense of loyalty. It seems PH had these two aspects down pat, and they translated perfectly to the new space.  Our server was a great guy, attentive and welcoming. The owner was on hand touching tables and hanging out with guests. The menu is simple, sticking to what they do best - thin crusts that somehow manage to be both crunchy and soft at the same time topped with innovative ingredients (with the requisite clever monikers, to boot). The Heavy Nettle was a massive hit - foraged nettles are a seriously rad pizza topping; who knew? Don't expect heavy toppings here - they're going for balance and I love it. With gourmet ingredients like these, I don't want a blanket of cheese to overpower it all.\n\nRating solely on food and service, I would have given them 4.5 stars. But when dining (and especially if  I'm going to pay $15/pizza), I'm looking for a full experience - and the atmosphere at PH needs a little help. I love the fun touch of the lights strung overhead, and I don't even mind the picnic table style seating. But when the dining room only gets a decent cleaning at the end of the night (napkins fell on the floor and stayed there, tables remained un-bussed for long periods of time, the singular bathroom for the entire place had standing water on the floor and was in pretty bad shape), the experience starts to suffer. \n\nIn general, the space had an unfinished feeling - extra supplies lying out in the open, disorganized shelving where items just hadn't found a permanent home yet, and a starkness that left it feeling a little cold despite what could have easily been a more festive environment. Some adjustment with the lighting and the addition of something to soak up a little sound (it gets really loud with even a small crowd) would do wonders. \n\nAnd finally I have to mention the house red wine - an excellent value, but my god does it taste like straight up grape juice! If you love a sweet red, you're all set (and many of the pies are spicy, so a little sweet can't hurt I guess). I get that this is definitely a beer kind of place, but I'd love to see the wine list expand a little to create more interesting pairing with the pizzas. \n\nThe good news, PizzaHacker? You're off to a great start. Hoping to be back to the Left Coast soon to check on your progress and try a few more of your creations.", "author": "Amanda H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-09", "description": "I don't know how to start this one....it's a vegetable centered restaurant focusing on fresh and local that makes pizza...no, wait. That's not totally right. It's a pizza place that creates magical pies from local vegies and goods...no, it's still not enough.\n\nHow about this: It's the first pizza restaurant where I have eaten that I leave feeling not too full and my tummy is as happy as my palate?\n\nI can't rave enough about this place.\n\nUsually, when people take something stock and standard and try to add \"health\" you get things like the \"Sawdust Bakery\" of my youth, or scary, slimey tofu burgers (with deference to an ex-roommate from college who shall remain nameless). \n\nMy credo has been (and will continue to be), if it is not broken, do not attempt to repair away the calories, sugar or flavor with \"healthy alternatives.\" I've had lo-cal desserts, imitation milk/sugar/fattening additives in things, Tofurkey (I shudder) and a mass variety of goods over the years and dutifully gone ahead and ingested them in the name of gastronomic trailblazing, all the while considering, quietly, that I actually just took one for the team.\n\nI'm a hag. I loathe fake. If you want a potato chip, go get the real thing and eat it. Shall we discuss the brief encounter our culture had with fake fat in potato chips? And the fact that Depends sales shot up? Nevermind....\n\nI eat well. I have lost 75 pounds as of the summer of 2015, and I know what I'm doing. I also like yogurt and all-bran for dessert at home. I know-I'm weird. But if I really want the real deal, I go out and get a little slice of cheesecake or some fresh fruit and toss it in cream. I don't eat 16 ounces of the stuff, either, I just have a good portion, call it done, and go back to being mindful for weeks on end.\n\nBut this place just blew me out of the water. All my preconceived notions of health and happiness ran together under one roof and I have nothing to grumble about (except that they're closed on Mondays. There, I'll obsess on that....)\n\nWith as hard as they work they deserve a day off. For the Rocket Man, they take arugula and mozzarella, add a cooked egg, put it on a beautiful crust of *whole wheat* (yes, I didn't stutter) --or some kind of whole grain--and it's beautiful. Add to that, no tomato sauce which, for me, is a relief (can't eat 'em) and I'm happy as a clam. The end result is the joy of eating arugula (aka \"rocket\") with its many flavors depending on temperature, and the crunchy, bready goodness of pizza like I haven't had since I was in Florence. Or New York. You pick.\n\nThe other fave is the Heavy Nettle with stinging nettles, straciatella cheese--a lovely invention from Apulia--and two flavors my Middle Eastern friend recognized: Harissa and Zatar. An amazing mouthful complemented by a lamb sausage that makes me want to curl up in a little ball and purr. \n\nA nice touch? We tried the Yo Vinny! one night. I braved tomatoes for a day...I didn't say I won't, just that I can't. Or shouldn't. Anyway, I suffered for your enjoyment. My Middle Eastern friend (we go there a lot) saw the pork sausage and almost removed all meat when they suggested switching it up with the Heavy Nettle: try the lamb sausage on this! It's really good!\n\nThe beers they have vary by the week/month and they always have four to choose from. And a great selection of wines, AND some fabulous salads. \n\nI obviously can't rave enough about the place, so I'll just stop right here, but the food is fab, the service efficient and warm and the whole place has the ambience of that comfy, funky place we all frequented in college. Now with much better food.", "author": "Steven H."}

Occasionally I'd try to make a pizza myself, which never worked; hunter's aren't cooks. it was demanding and no more.\n\nThe PizzaHacker opens a brick and mortar.  In its soft launch I came in to seek the pizza I've always wanted. There it was on the menu.  Labeled on the board as the \"Rocket Man\".  Arugula, lemon, chili pepper, mozzarella and and egg.  Cooked, charred every so gently on the sides, and on the table swiftly.  This pizza is beyond explanation and is all you'd ever want.  There are a few other pies on the menu and a salad...but I don't imagine not getting the Rocket Man unless it's no longer seasonal.  \n\nTill then, a quick walk to La Lengua is all I need till my next pie.", "author": "David S."}

Screaming children everywhere, and parents that decide it's okay to let them run free. The acoustics are so bad that all you hear are echoing screams. I don't need to eat my pizza in a fancy restaurant, but this is just beyond chaos.  Also, two people had dogs with them. In the restaurant. Who does that?? The service, while pleasant, is REALLY slow. After my dinner last week, we just wanted to escape the screaming children. It took 30 minutes just to get a check. Argh! \n\nAs for the pizza, pretty good. I'll probably get it again, - BUT AS TAKE OUT ONLY! We ordered both the margherita and the \"top shelf margherita\" to compare.

I love the thin crust with bits of sea salt on it. \n\nI like the kid-friendliness of the place and the bill is always cheaper than when we go to other pizza places in the city. \n\nI only wish perhaps that it weren't so noisy inside. It can get quite loud.\n\nAlso one of my sons is gluten intolerant and sadly they don't have gluten free options. So I can only go when my oldest son isn't eating with me. When we are all together as a family we are forced to go to Paxti's instead because of the gluten free option. I much prefer pizza hacker to  Paxti's.", "author": "ellen c."}

I don't know if that is intentional. I only got that vibe because of the colorful string lightbulbs hanging across the restaurant. Besides the flashback to my cabo vacation, the place is waaayyy trendy. The employees look like they are all in some basement indie band. \n\nWe ordered two pizzas, the Yo Vinny! and the Rocket Man. Both were so yummy! I especially liked the Yo Vinny! (marinated onions, mama lil's pickled goat horn peppers, house-made hot italian sausage, tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella). Probably one of the top five thin crust pizzas I've had for it being only $16. \n\nAlthough the pizzas were great... the customer service made me want to pick up an apron and do everything myself. We asked our waiter for water and patiently waited about 10 minutes while he did other things and passed by us about 15 times before finally asking another waiter. Then it took even LONGER for our waiter to come around to us to grab our order. And when it came time to pay our bill, we asked for our check and once again waited about 10 minutes before asking for our check again. Our waiter replied by saying \"Yeah, yeah your check I got it...\" and a few minutes later came by with the WRONG check. We were so fed up at this point that we just went up the counter to pay the right bill. My friend told our waiter that he gave us the wrong bill (the check he gave us was about $27 and we knew ours would be about $55). The waiter insisted that it was the right check before finally double checking and giving us the right bill. We were basically begging the kid to pay more money than he insisted. \n\nOverall, really yummy pizza... really bad customer service.

It's really no nonsense, casual atmosphere and I love that you can see them cooking the pizza from your seat while sharing a half carafe of wine at one of the big picnic style tables. They give you menus but who needs 'em when they've got the goods displayed on the huge chalkboard wall. Finally - normally I wouldn't even mention salad, but their 2 options are great and I love that you can get a family style bowl. We shared the Intermezzo salad, and it is actually worth mentioning.

Rises above the heady artisan pizza competition in the Bay Area such as Una Pizza Napoletana, Tony's, Gialina, Pizzaiolo, Flour & Water...\n\nThe crust has the perfect crispness and char on the outside and chewiness on the inside.  Unlike pretty much every other Neopolitan style pie around, the crust is firm not soggy in the middle.  Has a subtle soughdough taste (elusive -- only Una PIzza has it) with nice sprinkle of smoked salt on the edge.  The house-pulled mozzarella cheese is creamy, flavorful, melted perfectly.  The housemade tomato sauce has just the right amount of sweetness and acidity.  The toppings are creative and complement each other very well.  We ordered six pies which all were great even though the restaurant was only three days old and running at full tilt.\n\nThe space has a nice, laid back feel but with an energetic buzz from the excited crowd noshing their pizzas.

Gal comes back and says they're out of Pinot Noir. Ordered the other red and she says \"We're out of that too.\" How can you be out of all your red wine? It's a non-perishable. Anyway, since we were sitting right in front of the drafty door and could drink a nice glass of wine with our pizza cozier at home we asked her to box it to go. More disappointment when we get home and find that the arugula pizza, called the Rocket Man, had NO f**ckn arugula on it (or chile or lemon as posted). Just crust/cheese and a rubber egg (which admittedly could be due to the transport time). The \"top-shelf\" tomato sauce on the Margherita was meh and while a more naked salad could have had potential it was ruined by overdressing with poppyseed yukkiness. And it's their only dressing option. They do not have the act anywhere near together and the food isn't good enough to make up for that.

We went there on a Wednesday night and got a seat immediately. We didn't know how big the pizza was, so my wife and I ordered two pizzas. We had one Yo Vinny (sausage, pickled hot peppers, onions, tomato sauce) and one Rocket Man (arugula, garlic, mozzarella, lemon, no sauce, egg on top), and both were delicious. I could've used a little bit more sausage on the Yo Vinny, but the peppers had a great kick, and the tomato sauce had a great tangy flavor to it. The Rocket Man had plenty of arugula on it -- I hate when pizza places only put a little bit of arugula on their pizzas -- and the arugula had a nice lemony kick from the dressing. We didn't finish the pizzas, but what really impressed me was how well the Yo Vinny pizza stood up the next day when I re-heated it for breakfast (I didn't think the arugula would keep well).
