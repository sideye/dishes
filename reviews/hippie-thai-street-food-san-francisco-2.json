They don't seem to follow specific recipes. I've ordered many things from them, but here's a simple example: The fried pumpkin. Sometimes it's more fried, sometimes it's fried but the pumpkin is undercooked, sometimes they give you a lot, but a couple times I was pissed because they only gave me like 4 pieces for the same price. When you order from here you can never be 100% certain as to what you will receive, especially portion wise.\n\nMost of the time the food is good, but it's a gamble.", "author": "Melle R."}

The Haight has Veganburg which is a unique spot featuring all vegan veggie burgers as Veganburg started in Singapore as their spot in the Haight is their first branch in North America. I wasn't feeling a veggie burger though so decided to check out some Thai food.\n\nHippie Thai Street Food has Thailand street food. There isn't anything too hippie here except for the fact of being in the Haight which is where the Summer of Love started 50 years ago & the neighborhood where the hippie movement started.  \n\nHippie Thai Street Food features friendly & efficient service. My server customized my order vegan. I went w/ the lunch combo w/ pad thai w/ fried tofu & veggies, veggie soup, & spring rolls. The portions here are generous & hearty while I was able to finish all mine might be better to stick w/ one of the entrees yet the lunch combo is only slightly more.\n\nThe food was tasty w/ a relaxed & casual vibe. Nothing really suggests hippie in the interior atmosphere as there is a cool detailed map of Thailand & a picture of Miley Cyrus w/ some of the staff including my server. I don't know too much about Miley Cyrus's music yet think it is cool that she is vegan & does Ashtanga Vinyasa yoga like I do.\n\nI look forward to returning here!", "author": "Shane S."}

If you aren't going to honor reservations, then why take them? They had gone to another destination (Hall of Mirrors) before and could have spent more time there rather than waiting for a table. Very frustrating, especially since I made sure they knew it was a birthday when I placed the reservation. \n\nThey did come home with leftovers and typically when you order something and it comes with a sauce, you usually get sauce with it when it is in the to-go bag.

We haven't found this central Thai dish done well in any other spot in the city and I would definitely recommend it for any pork belly and shrimp lovers.  \nAnother great dish is their Khao Soi. Anyone who has been to Chiang Mai has probably fallen in love with this golden curry and Hippie Thai does it right! Try it out. The mixture of soft and crunchy egg noodles in turmeric-laced coconut soup is amazing on chilly SF nights. We usually steer clear of old standards like Pad Thai, but if you're craving that, we can also say that their Pad Thai is also surprisingly delicious!

Granted this waitress was buzzing around doing many roles and trying not to miss any business opportunities as she place as many people as she could in the small space. \n\nThere was a male there that I see often when I'm there just standing by the area where the chefs put the food out to hand her the food and make sure the order were correct but other than that the one waitress this particular time of day was doing all other roles alone. In short, they needed more staff or the male there could have done more to assist her. \n\nThe bathrooms could use some updating but it was clean the one time I needed to use it out of the 6 or so times I've been there.

This had been a go-to place when we did not want to cook and did not to deal with parking, etc. as it is nearby.  We always order crab fried rice and red curry with beef.  The crab fried rice did not seem to have any crab and when complained and it came back with supposedly more crab, it was still bland and could not find the crab.  The red curry was watery and lacked spice.  The crab fried rice used to have a bunch on the top. And the curry used to have some heat and not watery.\n\nDid they change cooks?\n\nIt has lost its place as a \"go-to\" joint.", "author": "Ross T."}

But it was cheap and open late, many dishes were under $10. When I saw the place had re-opened as Hippie Thai, I was kind of excited to try it out, hoping for better quality and a decent lunch spot in the Haight.\n\nToday I decided to, and regret to inform that it is not worth it.\n\n-Ordered a hot tea which was $1.50, it was very weak tea, on par with tea that is offered complimentary at some restaurants. My server couldn't even tell me what sort of tea it was, other than being herbal.\n\n-Portions are small for what you pay for. Some dinner places can get away with charging $10 for curry that doesn't include rice if it's fine dining, high quality, etc. With a name like \"Hippie Thai\", you're coming off more as a casual lunch spot, and not including rice with a small portion of $10 curry is heinous.\n\n-I ordered sticky rice to accompany my yellow curry. The curry itself was actually pretty good, creamy and mildly spicey, but the rice was terrible. Not sure if \"sticky\" was the right word to describe it, perhaps \"incredibly chewy, tough, and dry\" would have worked better. \n\nI paid $15 for the picture you see below, not including tip.\n\nWill not be back.", "author": "Megan D."}

I had eaten there once before in store and the food was just meh. Everything in the restaurant just seemed so dirty though, it did not make me want to come and dine in again (but maybe that's just the ambience of Haight in general). \n\nRight when I placed my order through Eat24, I got a phone call from the restaurant. The person from the restaurant remarked that my directions for the driver to walk a minute down this big drive way to hand me my food was too complicated and that I should go and grab the food from him. But here's how he put it \"Yeah, the driver is not going to come into the building. He's gonna park outside and you go get it. OK?\" I was slightly confused but agreed THEN HE ADDED \"Oh and you need to tip him in cash. Tip him ok?\" And I was appalled. It's one thing to remind a customer to tip, it's common courtesy of course I would tip, but to say it in such a demanding tone makes me never ever want to order or eat here again. And the fact that I have to go and get the food from him, making his job easier does not want me to tip him any more. I would rather pay for extra to have any other Thai restaurant come deliver for me. When the driver got here, I did not hear my phone but I saw that he called 5 times (4 minutes ago) and when I called him back, he was screaming at me to come get my food because he was busy and sounded really irritated even though I told him I was on my way. And when I gave him a tip he added \"Wow, that's it?? Next time come and pick it up at the restaurant.\" They really need to work on their customer service, especially since it is a new restaurant and is not very established compared to others like King of Thai or Osha. I'm telling all my friends to never come back here.", "author": "M T."}

Was actually across the street at another restaurant with pals, and came over here instead. Happy I did. I got fresh spring rolls which were HUGE and served with both peanut sauce and thai chili sauce. I also ordered the pumpkin curry, which was super delicious. It came with a huge portion of rice and the curry dish itself was a big size too. Loaded with pumpkin and veggies and just the perfect amount of heat that I asked for. Every bite was awesome.

However, I liked the old restaurant better, Best of Thai, which was recently replaced by Hippie Thai. Since the change, prices have gone up several dollars per dish and I personally don't find the food worth the cost. Best of Thai was my late night, cheap-but-big-portion place to go. Now, the food tastes the same to me, but they give you smaller dishes. Also, every time I come here, the pad kee mao noodles are clumped together so much, so there are thick bites of noodles that don't have very good flavor. I think it's time for me to give this place up.", "author": "Jen W."}

I ordered vegetarian Rad Nah with tofu. It is on their menu under \"stir fried rice and noodles\"described as \"Stir fried flat rice noodles, choice of meat, with Chinese broccoli, topped with soybean gravy sauce\"so I expected a pan fried rice noodles like pad see ew. what I got was a box of wide noodles that were stir fried and really oily and a huge container of what seemed to be 1 and a half cups of water with a half cup of oil and some cornstarch with some vegetables and tofu. I was confused by what I got because I didn't order soup. I called them to confirm my order and the  guy on the phone said that it was the right order and that way because it was vegetarian...I gave it a try. It tasted beyond bland, the texture of the goopy greasy sauce was unpleasant. I brought leftovers home thinking I could drain most of the sauce and add siracha for dinner,when I opened it again later it had separated into pools of oil and water. So gross!! No amount of hot sauce and draining could save it. My friend liked her food but I don't think I will be recommending this place to my customers.", "author": "Leann W."}

I ordered the yellow curry (vegan) and a side of rice noodles, it was delicious. We also got the fried roll appetizer, also very good. My friends were pretty stoked on their dishes as well.

Overall it's been a middle of the road experience. The flavors are on point, but the one criticism of the food I have is that both times the chicken was tough and dry.\n\nAs for the service, it was ok. Not the fastest but they were busy and they're just starting out. One big note is that the small metal water cups, while interesting, aren't ideal. They don't hold very much water and the waitresses can't see through them from a distance to see if people are empty. I didn't get one refill the entire meal.\n\nEasily correctable issues overall. The place can flourish with a few small tweaks. I'll give it another chance in a few weeks...so if management is looking I'll be happy to revise :)", "author": "Michael B."}

A few of the dishes that now include rice isn't under $10. \n\nWater is served in a tiny tin cup compared to full sized glass.\n\n**UPDATE --\n\nSo far, their specialty here seems to be soups because they do it extremely well and perhaps the best if not one of the best I've ever had.

Order the same thing more than once and you'll get a different version every single time. I get home late some nights and unfortunately it's one of the only places open late on Haight St. Being a creature of habit and loving pork belly I usually order the #51, the pork belly with Chinese broccoli and rice. Ordering this has turned into my once a week game night as the possibilities really are endless. Tonights version was another surprise with the absence of any real pork. Thats's right, a pork belly dish with so little pork I had to search through the forest of Chinese broccoli and an Everest portion of steaming white rice to find it. There was so little pork that if I actually ordered something different for once I would've forgotten what it was. Past pork belly dishes have had so much chili added to it that I couldn't eat it. And no, chili isn't mentioned in the menu description. I've been given every other piece of the magical animal but for the belly, cooked three different ways. I've gotten pork sausage, BBQ pork and roast pork in herbs. I have to admit, that last one was good but it's not what I ordered. I'll chalk that one up to broadening my thai food horizons. I cant wait to see what I get next time. If I ever go back.", "author": "Adam F."}
