Hello garlic fried rice, send over general tso's chicken, save me some beef chow fun, don't hog the honey walnut shrimp, the green beans are my main source of fiber, and I'll eat anything eggplant. \n\nQ1: Is it authentic Chinese you ask? Is anything authentic Chinese after decades of exposure to Twinkies, bagel bites, Costco rotisserie chicken, and late night comedy specials on HBO?! Maybe I'm projecting a bit here but seems to me the real question is why is any restaurant named for something you'd buy in the outdoor garden section at Lowe's is being judged for its genealogy?\n\nQ2: Is Big Lantern perfect? Is Brad Pitt even perfect?! Ok yes, Big Lantern has made me wait over 70 minutes for a 2 mile delivery, yes Big Lantern has hung up on me a couple times. But you know what? It was worth it and I relish the day when Brad returns my calls so I can compare. Please bring the dimsum combo when you come over Brad.", "author": "Cindy T."}

If you respect your body and your stomach in particular, you will not eat here. \n\nMy friend wanted some meatless chicken, so we decided to check this place out since they have an entire section on their menu dedicated to imitation meat. \n\nWe went with the Braised Tofu with Bok Choy, General Meatless Chicken, and Sesame Meatless Chicken. \n\nOkay let's begin with the tofu. If any of you eat tofu regularly, you know you need to season it for it to be consumable. Unfortunately, Big Lantern did not follow these general tofu preparation guidelines. What we received were soft blocks of plain tofu swimming in thin gravy surrounded by large chunks of bok choy. I tried, fam, I really tried to enjoy the tofu but it was inedible. The bok choy was chopped into huge pieces that were extremely difficult to consume in one or multiple bites. I ended up slathering this dish in sriracha. \n\nLet's move on to the chicken. The General Meatless Chicken was funky y'all! It tasted bitter and sour-- as if the meat itself was bad. I did enjoy the cashews and veg that accompanied the chicken though. As for the Sesame Meatless Chicken, that was probably the tastiest dish out of the ones we ordered. It had your typical Sesame sauce, and the chicken was prepared in the most appealing way out of the two chicken dishes we ordered. It was fried, however, I would have appreciated if the fried shell was a tad bit crispier as it turned out to be on the soggier side.  \n\nI do want to note that the service was pleasant! Everyone was nice and accommodating to us, so I don't want the quality of food to overshadow the other aspects of this place. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't plan on returning any time soon.

A co-worker and I ordered from them through Eat24.  Delivery showed up on time.  My co-worker is a vegetarian, so we ordered some vegetarian dim sum and one of their lunch specials, a meatless chicken option.  The vegetarian dim sum was okay, the skin/dough of the was a little too thick and I'd describe it as pasty.  The taste of the inside was decent.  We liked the meatless chicken, it had a good taste and a good portion for the price.    Overall, it wasn't bad.

We ordered soup, potstickers, two meat entrees, and pork chow mein. The sweet and sour chicken was cold and brought first, then time went by and they brought out potstickers, our soup bowls sat at the center of the table languishing empty for basically forever, and a young girl came out and asked us if we wanted the check. Uhhhhmmmm... how about our food, maybe? Then, and this is why I'm even taking the time to write this, she said, \"you shouldn't have come here on Christmas.\" Don't worry, kid, we won't make that mistake twice. To top the whole thing off, she brought out some tepid chow mein with chicken... we had ordered pork.

On a Saturday afternoon, the place was mostly empty (rather large restaurant) but heavily staffed. I came here craving dim sum and ended up ordering some shrimp dumplings, sesame balls, and their lunch special Mongolian beef. Everything was just okay. To be clear, this place is very Americanized Chinese food, so if you're looking for highly authentic experience and flavors, this is not the place for you. The shrimp dumpling's skin was oddly gelatin-like and sticky, but the filling was decently flavored. The sesame balls tasted great, but the fried outside portion was not crisp enough for me to poke even a chopstick into it without using a lot of force. The Mongolian beef tasted fine but felt heavily Americanized with extraneous sweet brown sauce. It lacked punch / spiciness and was more sweet than savoury.\n\nEverything was just okay but I will say that the employees working here seem very sweet and attentive. I overheard one lady saying in Chinese to a delivery boy as he went out the door that he forgot the vinegar for a customer's order of dumplings and that she didn't want the customer to have to eat the dumplings without it. So he went back in and the lady employee put the vinegar into the delivery bag. I thought that was a nice gesture.\n\nAll in all, if you do decide to come here, I would set my expectations.

Another plus was the food arrived super hot. \n\nThe soup was delicious! I got the small portion and it was a generous size - enough for two servings. The chicken fried rice was tasty - a tad greasy - but hey, it's fried rice so that is expected.

My travels through the vegan food circuit have lead me to so many funny, interesting and genuinely kind-hearted souls, and I am very grateful for that. \n\nMy friend Rosanne P. made a reservation for a baker's dozen, but only 11 were able to attend. The menu is slightly overwhelming, especially for newcomers. I had only been to Big Lantern two or three times, and it had been ages since my last visit, so I was ready and willing to return. \n\nWe ordered family style so we could get a taste of everything. We selected quite a vast array of Chinese delicacies, veganized: \n\n*Steamed Wontons with Chili Oil\n*Onion Pancake\n*BBQ Meatless Chicken Bun\n*Spinach Dumpling with Meatless Chicken\n*Chow Fun with Meatless Chicken\n*Sauteed String Bean With Fried Tofu \n*Garlic Eggplant\n*Sesame Meatless Chicken\n*General's Meatless Balls\n*Sesame Balls\n\nMy favorites were the Sesame \"chicken\" and the green beans and tofu. Everything was delicious except maybe the General's Meatless Balls (I'm not even sure of the real name, but they were ball-shaped and kind of strange-tasting). The eggplant was a little undercooked, but otherwise, the cooks did a fabulous job of keeping up with our gigantic order. The pacing was perfect. We never felt rushed nor did we feel like we were waiting a long time for anything. \n\nWater glasses were promptly replenished, which was very much appreciated, as most of their dishes leaned towards the spicy side. I love that! My friend Roshi and I kept adding more chili to everything. I am a heat freak. The hotter, the better. I did choke slightly on my first bite of the wonton with chili oil, as I was not expecting for it to have such a ferocious kick. Definitely worth ordering!\n\nWe all feasted until our bellies were bulging and our belts were waving a white flag... it was an incredible meal shared with ten lovelies, and I'm so very glad that we chose Big Lantern for our friend Clyde's one-day-too-late birthday bash. \n\nI will definitely be returning for some take-out.

It's hard to mess up white rice, but I was pleased that it was still warm and moist when it got to my door. My vegetarian companion was equally pleased with her dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-04-09", "description": "This place is responsible for the worst delivery experience I've ever had. So in a way, they should be proud of this achievement. I placed an order at 9:25pm. At 10:47pm I inquired as to its whereabouts. The owner said it would be 20 more minutes. At 11:15 I asked again, he said the driver was on his way and that it would be a few more minutes. At 11:40pm, he said it would arrive any minute... At 12:07am I cancelled the order. \n\nThe issue isn't so much that it took almost 3 hours and never arrived, nor that they were completely unapologetic the entire time. The issue is how the issue was handled. It is pretty clear that the driver was never enroute. I know that the first thing you're thinking is why didn't I just cancel the order after about an hour and 15 mins and order from another place. Fair question. Part of the reason was that it had gotten so late that I was somewhat committed to the order and also because I was watching Game of Thrones and didn't want to step away. Part of the issue is that had they just admitted that they messed up, I could have cancelled the order and placed another one. \n\nSo the bottom line is that Big Lantern earns a one star review, a rating that I rarely give. The one star is also extremely generous. If you are reading this Mr. Lantern, I think you handled this situation terrible and I don't want to call you a liar but I also don't know how to finish this sentence. \n\nOh and seeing as this order was placed through Eat 24, the entire facts of this are verifiable and on record.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-12", "description": "I've now been to Big Lantern on at least a dozen occasions -- both for eat-in and take-out -- and my experience with the breadth of its vegetarian dishes is much better and much deeper.  I don't take back anything of my previous review (other than the rating), as I acknowledge (both then and now) that my earlier review was premature.  That said, I stand by my qualified hesitation regarding the General's Meatless Chicken.  I've never gotten it again, and I don't think I ever will.  I know now, however, that one can order the General Meatless Chicken without it being deep fried.\n\nMy favorite dish, bar none, is the Kung Pao Meatless Chicken.  It is, in fact, the very best vegetarian kung pao I've had anywhere.  Despite my concern about the veggie chicken based on its deep fried preparation, this veggie chicken is amazing.  It's delicious.  It's wonderful.  I love its taste and texture.  I've tried it in the kung pao, the basil meatless chicken, and the Mongolian meatless chicken (different kind of meatless chicken, I think).  I've also enjoyed the Mongolian meatless beef -- the meatless chicken was better, and the price of the Mongolian meatless beef the most expensive item not on the menu (I think they jack up the price to screw unsuspecting patrons).  I've tried the fried rice -- both veggie and meatless chicken (veggie better).  Moreover, I've tried some dim sum -- all vegetarian -- the egg rolls, the potstickers, and some of the dumplings.\n\nTo be sure, I have some reservations about Big Lantern.  First, I've found that the food is uniformly better during the week than it is on the weekend.  There is a different chef, and the kung pao in particular is not nearly as flavorful Friday-Sunday, as it is on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.  That said, when BL is on, it's really quite satisfying.  The portions are reasonable; the flavors are vibrant.  It's classic Chinese food prepared in a vegetarian way, which is so very difficult to find.  The soup (vegetarian wonton) and the dim sum, universally, is just okay.  It's well prepared and not greasy, but it also lacks flavor.  \n\nOverall, with experimentation, one gets a good sense of what's good to order at BL.  And, with that, it stands in a class by itself.  While I love Golden Lotus/Golden Era, it's Vietnamese, and these Chinese classics are not offered.  Oakland now has a place called Nature Vegetarian, which is a vegetarian Chinese restaurant, but it just hasn't delivered.  While Big Lantern is not a dedicated vegetarian restaurant, it delivers more often than not, with delicious vegetarian chicken (or meatless chicken, as they call it) that brings one back to her Chinese roots.\n\nThe only other game in town for a good Chinese vegetarian menu (other than Enjoy Vegetarian) is Wild Pepper further down in the Mission.  Wild Pepper is good, too, but leans towards the salty side.  Between the two, I prefer Big Lantern, although I think that Wild Pepper is probably more artfully prepared.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-25", "description": "Great place for veggie dim sum and a big selection of vegetarian/vegan dishes on the menu. More importantly, they actually make their dim sum from fresh ingredients. It's not frozen out of a bag like some places. Dim sum favorites include the taro vegetable puff (light, crispy & flavorful-I could eat 10 of these!), chive dumpling, tofu vegetarian roll, and turnip cake. If you like garlic, the cucumber with garlic chili sauce appetizer is not to be missed. It's a little spicy, salty, slightly sweet and oily (like most garlic chili sauces), and tastes amazing with steamed rice. When you're done eating all the cucumbers, save the sauce and take it home. The garlic chili sauce is delicious on everything. I've even used it to marinate tofu the next day and mixed it with noodles to make szechuan style noodles at home, yum!  I'm also a big fan of their meatless fish, although sometimes the v-fish has arrived as v-shrimp which is ok since I like that, too. Just ask to be sure which veggie fish they're using if you have a preference. You'll see all the usual suspects in the veggie section of their menu including kung pao, general tso, mu-shu and beyond (like the crispy fried tofu with spicy pepper). Really delicious food for the neighborhood. Prices are competitive and for people who complain about how much they're paying here, come on, it's not Chinatown, look around. And for the Mission, it's excellent. I'll admit, delivery isn't great. If you order delivery, make sure you can wait 60-90 minutes for them to show up and you're willing to re-heat once it arrives. And since I'm giving you that tip, don't expect anything crispy to be crispy when it gets delivered. Know what delivery food means and give these guys a break.

This is a really nice place. The decor is pretty good.  Service is fast and friendly. I tried the Dim Sum combination, the curry puffs, and sweet rice tamales. The Dim Sum combination was good. It consists of three mini pork buns, three siu mai, and three shrimp dumplings.   It is served with hot mustard and hot chili oil.  It was well made. It was not dry or greasy.  The curry puffs were interesting. It is different than the ones I am used to seeing.  The pastry is dry, flaky and sweet.  The filling is a bit dry and reddish. It looks like grounded chorizo meat. It has a strong and spicy curry flavor, but it took a while for me to notice it.  Again, it was not greasy and was well made.  Overall, I like it.  The  sweet rice tamale was good.  There was nothing really special about it.  It was flavorful and the rice had the right amount of moisture. They simply  took a good Chinese dish and gave a Mexican name.    \n\nLater on, I tried one of their meatless chicken rice plates.  I had the General Meatless Chicken.  It was really good.  I do not know what they really put in these fake meat products, but it was really good.  It tasted like chicken, and had the right texture.  Of course, it was not as greasy or oily as chicken.  It did have the right amount of moisture. I was very satisfied.  The sauce they put on it was different than what was expecting.  It was more fruity, but not overly sweet. The sauce was thicker, and they used the right amount of it.  It had little or no garlic in it.  Some places usually drown the meat with too much sauce, that is either watery or sugary. This place got it right.  The rice was pretty good, not overcooked or undercooked.  \n\nThe prices are little higher compared to other Chinese places, but it is well worth it.  I did notice that the  flatware they used was above average compare to what other Chinese places use.  The stainless steel flatware had a bright polished finish and had good weight and balance.  Other Chinese places tend to use cheap, lightweight, dull, flatware that would bend easily if used to scoop slightly frozen ice cream.  Basically flatware, that is a one step higher than the free plastic  spork you get at a KFC. \n\nOverall, I was pretty happy with my visits and look forward to trying other items on their menu.", "author": "Hiroshi K."}

Whereas you might drop a Franklin on a dinner for two at some trendy spot elsewhere in the Mish, you can leave this place satiated for about $25 on average (based on three previous encounters here). It's also pretty quick, so if you're just looking for a solid base to counteract the impending booze binge down the street, it's a good call.\n\nOf the stuff I've tried, I really dug the sweet rice tamales, the vegetarian puff, the shrimp dumpling and the pork bun.

I was absolutely devastated when I saw the sign.  Don't worry, though, they re-opened a few months later.\n\nIt's mixed menu but AMAZING veggie food, extensive selection, savory and delicious.   The food is pretty heavy, but in a good way (and sometimes that's exactly what you're looking for, right?)\n\nBest dishes: Sesame meatless chicken, any kind of meatless chicken, veggie dumplings, numbing noodles, Singapore style rice noodles, taro puffs, or any and all kinds of veggie dim sum.\n\nThey have been known to give meat to veggies, though, so watch out.  I usually remind them 2-3 times that everything is veggie-only. \n\nAlso, service is almost always awesome, except when they're super busy (i.e. Pride weekend.)  They just started serving soju cocktails, and the drinks are great.  But a few weeks ago they wouldn't serve any cocktails because it was too busy; and then today the waitress wasn't sure if they would serve them.  If they're listed on the menu they should always be served, no big deal (hopefully that's what will happen in the future.)\n\nBig Lantern has grown in popularity over the years, and once in awhile you have to wait for a seat.

Black Bean Asparagus, Garlic Broccoli, Garlic Spinach, Dry Sauteed String Beans (my favorite), and on and on.\n\n- Tofu dishes, of course.\n\n- Yummy dim sum (served anytime) dishes like Taro Vegetable Puffs (HOLY GOD!!!!!), Taro Cakes, and several other vegetarian items not found at many Chinese spots.\n\n- Plus they have things like the Meatless Chicken Salad - a yummy shredded cabbage salad with a crisp coated meatless chicken \"breast\" on top, and a creamy, sweet and light dressing.

I ordered Orange \"Chicken\", white rice and veggie dumplings. They said it would arrive by 3:05. So I waited, and waited. And then waited some more. When it got to be 3:15 I called and said its been more than an hour and asked about my order. The woman was nice and said she would call the driver but she was sure it was on its way. She said she would call me back. They never called back. I called back at 3:40 thinking ok it's been almost an hour and a half it should be here. She told me he was very close and that she was sorry for the delay. The driver then called me and said 5 minutes. He finally arrived about 10 minutes later. Like I said, I'm not from here so maybe this is the norm in terms of delivery in these areas. \n\nClearly by the time the food arrived, it was not very hot but the orange chicken was good. It was pretty fried, which I somewhat expected, but it had good flavor and really good texture for fake meat. The dumplings were ok, they had good flavor but because of the delay in delivery they weren't very hot and started getting a little moist from the steam in the container. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely eat at Big Lantern again but I think I would go into the restaurant rather than order delivery. Kudos on the orange chicken though!", "author": "Meghan S."}

It looked, felt, and tasted like the meat of chicken.  After eating some, I started to feel insecure about it and called them.  Sure enough, they had given me the corpse of a dead chicken.

We decided to try Big Lantern because it seems to be one of the few places with a decent selection of truly vegetarian dim sum.  \n\nWe were not disappointed!  We got a few of our favorites, the rice noodle dim sum was delightful, as were the tofu rolls.  We also got the vegetarian selection, which was very tasty.  Additionally, we ordered extra food to take home for later - the mango faux chicken, and the spicy not-meatballs.  Both were not only delicious (and spicy!) but the servings were generous enough that we had leftovers for the next day!  Always love that!\n\nWant to mention that the service was swift and gracious, and they got our order exactly right.  I noticed some criticism here based on take-out orders made via an app or third party delivery service, and all I can suppose is that the fault is not with Big Lantern, their food or staff, but with the app or delivery service, because our dining experience was lovely.  \n\nI recommend Big Lantern as a choice option for vegetarian Chinese food in the Mission.

It's not too expensive, but then again, it's not Yamo.  It's not too tasty, but then again, I've had way worse nearby.  And better yet, the food doesn't have that terrible aftertaste I associate with Panda Express, ensuring that you don't feel like you're going to die from MSG fats overdose immediately after.\n\nBut do yourself a favor and stick to the American-Chinese food items, if you're expecting good Dim Sum, or Roast Duck or Pork Intestine with Chinese Pickles this is definitely not the place for it.

Sure you can find some delicious stir fry and noodle dishes, but I'm talking about a hearty craving for Sesame chicken, or something of the like.  Big Lantern is the answer.  They have delicious meatless chickens.  I'm not sure if they're tempeh or soy based, but they are SO GOOD.  My usual order here is the Sesame meatless chicken with brown rice and a side of crab cheese puff.  Wonton soup is also good. YUM. \n\nThe reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5, is because EVERY time I order delivery I ask for a packet of hot mustard instead of the soy sauce packets they usually include...

Free delivery anywhere in San Francisco with a minimum $10 purchase!\"\n\nBy \"Free Delivery\" they mean that you will never receive your food and will not receive any kind of update or notification about it. In fact, you will have to then call them three times within the next TWO HOURS to find out that your food is lost. Yes, lost. Maybe it pulled a Patty Hearst and wanted to stay in the young delivery boy's car forever, we will never know. \n\nI've eaten here several times and never had a horrible experience. I've at least always managed to acquire food from them. Still the best thing I could tell my lady when she was calling was that it \"sometimes didn't make me sick.\" \n\nSo we called and placed an order (my lady-jew needed her chinese food on what she refers to as a \"americanized waste of a day\"). They had trouble understanding the address right off the bat and stopped ladyfriend to ask whether this was an apartment or house before she even had the chance to tell them. \n\nSo we wait. And wait. And wait. We ordered at 7:37. At 8:52 we called. We were told it was \"on its way.\" \n\nAt 9:30 we called again. \"It got lost.\" I'm sorry, lost? Did it wander off in the dark? Try putting some light up shoes on it next time? I hear LA GEAR has some sort of lighting mechanism on the soles. Much like small children, Chinese food will get lost in crowded cities/places apparently. Take the Chinese food to Disneyland and rest assured it will never be seen again.\n\nThe man on the phone said \"Things happen.\" Really, Sir? Do \"things happen?\" Does food just walk away? This is after he hung up on us the second time we called to check on our food status. My ladyfriend asked to speak to the manager, which clearly never happened, instead they just went silent on the phone and then hung up 20 seconds later. She then called back, very angry. \n\nAfter much anger on our end he offered 20 percent off. Hmm. Sorry. Not good enough, especially when we've been trying to locate our food for the past 2 hours and you've been nothing but brisk, short and utterly rude. On top of that  we pointed out that 20 percent is essentially 10 percent due to taxation. So we took our business elsewhere, which to be honest, was fine.\n\nTry somewhere else and save 2 hours of your life and quite possibly multiple trips to the bathroom.", "author": "Caitlin C."}

I've given this place a few different chances and each time it has disappointed me. Nothing stands out and the flavors all taste the same. Salty and fishy and not in a good way.  I mean EVERYTHING tastes like that... Even the chicken. I've tried the chow fun- lacked flavor. The house spicy chicken chow fun- also lacked flavor as well as heat. The Mongolian beef was overly salted and overcooked. The chow mein also lacked any flavor. The noodles are weird. You get the idea. How can everything I've had lack flavor when it's clearly MSG-laden?? Oh they all say no, but my pounding headache and unquenchable thirst says otherwise. The only thing that was ok was the shrimp dumpling. It was convenient because they do deliver, but forget about getting your order in less than an hour. It may take longer. It always takes longer than they say... at all hours. The last time I ordered I called them to ask where my food was after an hour and 45 mins- after they told me it would be 45 minutes... Then they told me they won't deliver to my house anymore. I know what you're thinking- I must have been rude. Quite the contrary, my orders have always been over $30-40 and I've always tipped the driver way more than 20% for their troubles and was always courteous on the phone even though they barely understand and u have to repeat myself a bunch of times. Maybe they think my house is too far- either way, an explanation would be nice.

The food is good, consistent and reasonably priced.  They have an online ordering service that's easy and totally works.  We frequently request all white meat in chicken dishes and that's exactly what we get.  The Mongolian beef is a favorite and so is the basil chicken.  Tonight we went for mu shu pork, Mongolian beef, brown rice and pork potstickers.  The total was $25 and the food came right away.\n\nIt's not the very best Chinese food you'll have in your life, send your foodie friends there right this minute but it's our regular Chinese delivery and we've never been disappointed.  Once in a while they throw in free chow mien or fried rice (might be Monday nights but not sure) and that's sort of fun.  \n\nIf you're looking for reasonably priced good Chinese food, give them a try.", "author": "Cynthia A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-09-22", "description": "Omg. I have never seen my garbage disposal of a boyfriend spit out food until we ordered from here. He eats \"gross food\" all the time too. He loves smelt, tripe, tongue, preserved egg, fermented tofu, jelly fish, snouts, brain, etc. etc. etc. You name it and he loves it. \n\nSo when we were too hung over this weekend to leave the house and needed food we settled on Chinese. Plus we thought, let's order extra so we have lunch leftovers! \n\nFirst we each ordered soups (the only truly edible dishes we ordered). I got egg flower, he got west lake beef soup. They were the exact same soup but one had beef added to it and one had mushrooms added to it. I had the first bite and when the BF asked how it was I said, \"Very warm, bland, but ok.\" He took his bite and agreed. \n\nNext up we opened the fried rice. It was dark brown. It was completely drenched in soy sauce. I actually contemplated rinsing it out. I've read Susanna Foo's book, I know how non-Chinese cooks (*points to self*) ruin Chinese dishes. By adding too much soy sauce and oil. This dish is the perfect example for Susanna Foo's \"how to not make fried rice\" example. If you like drinking soy sauce then you'll love this dish. But while I do love to put soy sauce on almost every Chinese dish I order, I couldn't eat much of this. \n\nThen came the order of Chive Dumplings. This was the first dish that was spit out. I think my BF took it as a challenge to be able to prove to me he can eat anything. He barely swallowed it. I don't know how a chive dumpling can go so wrong. The chives tasted like overcooked collard greens that were rotten. The rice wrapping was even bad! It had the worst texture I've ever tasted or seen. \n\nNext we decided maybe we'll try our Beef and Broccoli. And it was decent. It was edible and not overcooked. But it was soooo over sauced. I was able to eat about 4 whole bites. \n\nAnd here comes the best part.... \n\nOk, maybe the Mu Shu Chicken will be better. BF unwraps the foil to get the mu shu wrappers and guess what he finds.... TORTILLAS. Yes. Actual Mexican tortillas. So I dish some filling onto my plate and try it first. It tastes like sugar. Seriously, I think the sauce was made out of simple syrup. I get a weird look on my face and so the BF grabs a bite and instantly spits it out and runs to the sink to rinse his mouth out. A tortilla couldn't have made it taste any better. \n\nThe only thing we both actually finished was the soup. We ripped up the take out menu and I'm posting this review to remind myself to never order from here again. I thought even \"bad Chinese food\" was supposed to be good. I was expecting a Panda Express type meal, but instead all we got was a lot of smelly garbage. \n\n$40 down the drain. \n\nOh- but the delivery was very fast.", "author": "Ali R."}

Their menu is very extensive which renders me not knowing what to order. So I asked the question that is forbidden at almost any Asian restaurant: \"what are your most popular items?\" I was ready for something like: \"I don't know. It's up to you\" or \"everything is good\" or maybe a lousy suggestion of some random dish they come up with on the spot. Instead, the guy gave me a list of like 15 dishes AND I also really appreciate that he actually gave it some thought; he was \"mm-ing\" between suggestions until I finally picked a dish. I literally ran to my boyfriend and told him I just talked to the nicest Asian restaurant worker ever.\n\nFood arrived in approximately 30 minutes (give or take). I don't know if the delivery guy is the same as the order-taking guy, but he was very nice too. I live in a condo and I guess the front desk people went home, so the delivery guy couldn't get in. He called me and SANG, ~~~Big Lantern. I'm downstairs~~~ LOL. It's freezing-balls out there. Who could sing anymore?\n\nFood was still warm. At just the right temperature to eat without burning yourself, except the soup which was still very hot. The General Chicken (one of their most popular item) was \"very good\" according to my boyfriend. The deep-fried battered chicken pieces seemed a bit soggy, but that's just the difference between eating at the restaurant and doing take-out. I ordered a second entree because the guy told me free fried rice if you order two entrees. I ordered the Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings, not one of his recommendation but it was something my boyfriend and I adore back in our hometown. Mmm. Not so great here. Neither salty nor peppery. Topped with a ton of fried garlic and some sliced jalape\u00f1o with a hint of curry/cumin and lemon AND they're on steroids. Next time I'll stick with the guy's recommendations. The fried rice was a big fried rice (I think 26oz) and you get to pick what type of meat you want in it. Even though it was unusually dark, it didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Boyfriend said he preferred steamed rice. My chicken corn soup (without chicken) was disappointing. There was barely any corn.\n\nTheir service was definitely worth 5 stars. Their food is sub-par. But I will order delivery from them again. \n\nHighlights:\n+ friendly service\n+ speedy delivery\n+ doesn't limit their delivery service to only places within walking distance; they did say they'd deliver to anywhere in SF\n+ extensive vegetarian options\n\n+/- free fried rice with your choice of meat if you order 2 entrees (not that yummy)\n\n- sub-par Americanized Chinese food\n- barely any corn in my corn soup (me sad)", "author": "Jennifer L."}

I had never eaten there, but I was comforted by the fact that it's usually pretty busy inside.  The Yelp reviews said it specialized in something called \"meatless chicken.\"  It was the most popular thing on the menu. \n\nThe first time I ordered it, the meatless chicken came in brown cubes.  The texture was so meat-like and it tasted so chicken-y that I thought they had made a mistake with my order.  Perhaps I was a little naive, but I had eaten plenty of similarly advertised meatless items before.  So befuddled was I over the mystery meat's identity that I couldn't finish it.    \n\nA few days later, I was still so uncertain over my meatless chicken experience that I decided I needed to order it again.  This time I ordered the meatless chicken as lunch special with a sesame sauce.  (Btw- lunch special is a great deal - it's cheap and it's huge.)  The meatless chicken was totally different this time - deep fried and smothered in the sesame sauce to the degree that my taste buds could detect no fake chicken-y taste at all..  Reassured of the product's meatlessness and encouraged by the fact that it was deep fried in fatty goodness, I enjoyed the artificial meat much more the second time around.

We ordered all types of different foods, but it wasn't your ordinary plate, they gave us a bunch of different big bowls of Orange Chicken, Kung Pao, Beijing Beef, etc. It had a hella nice traditional family dinner feels to it, plus the food was super good. I just wish it wasn't so small. I felt super squished the whole time. They had Tv's w/ ESPN on, so it's great if your sports fanatic.\nMY favorite part about Big Lantern was the area. It seemed like a really cool community, and everybody knows each other.\nGood people. Good Food. Great area. If that's all you care about, then this joint's a win.", "author": "Biciok K."}

This is a great place for  vegetarians who want all the choices everyone else has (so long as they can eat gluten) and meat eaters who have just gone veg who are prolonging their relapse back into meat. Almost every dish you can think of can be found in a veg version with fake meat. I really like the General's Meatless Chicken but the truth of the matter is my stomach does not.\n2.) Take out has always shown up for me when they say they're going to show up.\n3.) They're open late.\n4.) I know from experience they can be talked into delivering outside their normal delivery zone if only you spend enough.\n5.) Service is usually attentive, even if it gets busy.\n6.) Most of the dim sum options are pretty yummy. The dumplings are usually pretty darn good.\n7.) They have a huge menu but not so large that you feel so overwhelmed you want to give up the second you see it.\n8.) Dining room is clean and looks nice.\n\nThe Cons and The Questionable Stuff:\n1.) I cook more authentic Chinese food... and I'm an American Mayan-European mix.\n2.) You may get better food than me. Or you may get worse. Flip a coin to measure the consistency of quality at this restaurant. They seem to have some standby dishes though that they never mess up. The chow mein so far for me has been one of these. It has a lot of crispy, fresh veggies  though in all honest it's a little greasy.\n3.) Truth be told, everything here is kind of a bit too greasy.\n4.) Tortillas are always yummy. Well, actually, not quite always. They are not so tasty when topped with the gelatinous gravy from this place. This is the way I envision my Mexican American grandmother cooking Chinese food, except much lighter and healthier.\n5.) Sometimes (but not always) their fried rice tastes a lot like how I used to make fried rice when I was five. I just added soy sauce every time the rice started to stick to the bottom of the wok. The result is very, very salty rice.\n6.) The spring rolls are a gelatinous greasy mess. *gag*\n7.) Delivery, while on time, is still so slow you might actually end up getting so hungry that you eat before they get there.\n8.) This one of very, very few places I've ever been to where we've been asked to leave our table the instant we paid the bill. I get that they may want the table for someone else but this comes across as tacky.\n9.) Beware the leaky take out containers!", "author": "A J."}

They do offer up a surprisingly large dim sum selection for a delivery place, and while they aren't great, they are decent.  Similarly, they have a very large faux-meat selection, and I always enjoy their general Tcho's meatless chicken.\n\nHowever, there are significant issues when trying to order on the phone:\n\n1.  The environment where they take orders is extremely loud, and many of the folks manning the phones have a limited command of English.  This makes ordering from them *extremely* frustrating, as you have to essentially scream and repeat yourself many, many times in order to make yourself understood - ordering delivery is supposed to alleviate stress, not create it.\n\n2.  Most of the time, the food is not packaged carefully, and there is almost always significant leakage when you order dishes that have a lot of sauce.\n\n3.  Prices are somewhat expensive, although portions are also sizable, and with 2 dishes you get a free fried rice or vegatable lo mein.\n\nOf these criticisms, #1 is the most significant, and can make ordering delivery a truly unpleasant experience.", "author": "Daniel M."}

Who is the wackjob that is sending their employees walking all over San Francisco?\n\nAND their website and menu doesn't say ANYTHING about a $35 minimum.  Actually your website says free delivery and the online ordering system says an $18 minimum.  if you SAY 18 dollar minimum you can't tell your customers that you are not buying enough food because you are \"too far\" and then demand that they order more.

And I know I'll get a lot of judgement from the San Francisco Chinese-American community on my high rating for this place, but you must know that it comes from a very subjective perspective (as opposed to my other reviews): I live nearby and am a vegetarian. \n\nLocation: Fabulous location, right on 16th St. between Valencia and Guerrero. Tons to do before and after eating and accessible to absolutely anyone and everyone.\n\nSpace: Looks like most other Chinese restaurants in they city. (Except Chinatown....you never know what to expect in that area.)\n\nAmbiance: The strangest crowd of people. People from the area. Hipsters. People who just want Chinese food and don't know that this place emphasizes vegetarian dishes. This is more like the place you order from twice a week when you don't want to cook and are tired of Mac N' Cheese. Or the place you stumble on after a couple of beers at Delirium.\n\nService: I love the service here! It's absolutely horrible. I believe every single complaint about the service written in all the other reviews. But that's part of the whole experience of eating at ethnic places. If you walk into a real Mexican restaurant, none of this Aztec Taqueria bullshit, all the servers will shit-talk you in Spanish in the back. We just have different views of service in other countries. So just order your food, eat it and be prepared to have a little argument with the waiter or waitress every once in a while. \n\nFood/Drink: The food is good and priced well. Obviously it is not Chinatown price: quality ratio, but it's as close as you'll get in the area. I love the greasy-ness and VAST menu. Tons and tons of vegetarian options, which is why I am giving this place a 4 star.

Another is rubbery chicken, which is unfortunately all too common in delivery Chinese food.  My world definitely changed for the better, though, when I picked up a Chinese delivery menu left outside my door and saw that the place offered an \"all white meat\" option for an extra couple bucks.  Though that chicken ended up being subpar, I realized that asking for all white meat chicken is a viable option from most delivery places if you're willing to pay.\n\nI've since done so at a couple different Chinese food places, but Big Lantern is far and away the winner in terms of the big, juicy chunks of chicken breast they include in everything I order.  My go-to is the Mongolian chicken, which will actually taste spicy if I insist I can handle it, and the Kung-Pao chicken, which definitely does not skimp on the peanuts, bell peppers and zucchini.  \n\nFried rice has also been one of my favorite foods since I was a kid and is kind of hard to screw up, but Big Lantern does it right for sure.  I get veggie egg fried rice, because unlike the all white meat chicken I order, the beef and pork are too chewy for my taste, meaning that \"combination\" rice isn't an option.  I'm totally good with the veggie fried rice, though.  It comes with tiny chopped up pieces of zucchini, broccoli, regular peas (something I usually eat around), snow peas (something I usually and inexplicably DON'T eat around), and egg.  And LOTS of soy sauce, just the way Mama J. cooked it for me when I was a kid and would freeze single servings in Ziploc bags to microwave as after-school snacks.\n\nBig Lantern is also super fast with the delivery.

His assistant would stock the cart with ingredients while he deftly wielded his large wok over a raging fire, throwing ingredients into the mix and tossing them high into the air.  Pure artistry.\n\nThe results were tasty.  They weren't the exactly the height of culinary perfection.  I'd rank it somewhere in the range of PF Chang's but cheaper and with considerably less pretentiousness.  Oh, they deliver too.", "author": "Christopher K."}

Lots of soy sauce (which isn't that bad, but I prefer a tiny less) and it seemed to have a sweetness to it. MSG? Sweetness from the pork? Not sure. The fried rice was definitely very greasy; I've had less greasy fried rice elsewhere.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is actually quite nice. On the outside it looks pretty cruddy.\n\nService on the phone was interesting...:\nMe: Hi, can I order for pick up?\nGuy: Yes, what's your numa;dfkjaf?\nMe: What? Did you ask me for my phone number?\nGuy: Hold on\n[puts me on hold for 5 seconds]\nGuy: Hi, what is your phone number?\n[I give him my phone number]\nGuy: What is your name?\nMe: Angela\nGuy: What do you want?\nMe: Pork fried rice and that's it.\nGuy: What is your phone number?....it will cost....ok 15 minutes.

The assorted dim sum was freshly steamed and wasn't so bad (though the shui mai was definitely only a 3).  The Chef's Special Mandarin clay pot is what pushed Big Lantern from 3 to 4 stars though.

First stop: Big Lantern.  Bonus points for having the huevos to be a Chinese place in the Mission.  No neighborhood needed you more, BL.   \n\nAbout the food...First thing I noticed was the ample vegetarian selection.  I'm not veggie but my friends are and it's nice to have options for them.  We ordered the sizzling rice soup and it was really good, full of veggies and chicken and fish.  The baked pork buns were nice, too.  I liked the meat:bun ratio -- not too much of either so they're perfect little snacks for two before dinner.  The entree was Mongolian Beef and the best I can remember having.  Pea shoots not so tasty and a little soggy, but eclipsed by the fact that our fortune cookie fortunes were uncanny in their accuracy.  Oh and the house tea is Jasmine (my favorite). \n\nThe service, like the pea shoots, left something to be desired, but on the whole, Big Lantern was a good experience (just be proactive about getting your order taken and you're set).

After cutting my teeth on Boston and New York Chinatown food, something about the local Chinese seemed, well lacking. Maybe it was the fact that every chinese place here seems to sell the same Hunan cuisine that there's not much to distinguish it. Even the venerable Henry's Hunan has lost its luster.\r\n\r\nSo, when friends from Tampa said we should have Chinese tonight, I hit the reviews online and decided on Big Lantern.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant - clean and bright with an open kitchen. We were shown a table by someone that we assume is the owner. The menu was unexpected - focusing on special dishes with only a small selection of the typical Chinese standards. After talking to the owner about their best dishes, we went with a selection of dim sum, meat dishes and a noodle dish.\r\n\r\nThe dim sum ranged from excellent to good. The stuffed crab claws and hargow were excellent. The siu mai, siu long bao and the shrimp toast were very good, and the pan fried pork buns were good. Nothing bad, and the crab claws are the best any of us have had in ages.\r\n\r\nI asked if they had pork belly for twice-cooked pork, but unfortunately they didn't have any - but he offered a similar dish with roasted char siu, which fit the bill. As of their next printing of the menu, real twice-cooked pork with pork belly will be on the menu. We also had Kung Pao Chicken, very well made, but I am not a fan of zucchini in this dish. The surprising dish was an excellent spicy \"numbing\" noodles - lo mein covered with a ground pork and shiitake ragout.\r\n\r\nAll of this, Pu Erh tea and two beers ran us $60. Plus, they deliver out to the ballpark, meaning that we have a good delivery option in SOMA/Mission Bay.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended for dim sum or main courses.", "author": "Avery G."}

The dim sum is a little pricey (and certainly can't match Chinatowns You's and Lou's), but they are the only dim sum place for miles so who can blame them. If they bring the good chinese food they are allowed to charge a little more for dim sum.

This is because of delivery problems, which I'll explain below.\r\n\r\nFirst, I've enjoyed the food.  I haven't really ordered off the menu -- I just ask for what I want, and see if they have it.  I have been pleased with the food.  And, when I've eaten in, the service has been very good.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I ordered delivery strange things happend.  First time, the delivery person didn't come all the way to my house.  Instead, he called from his cell phone and said he had delivery for me.  I went down to my front door and didn't see any delivery.  I went outside, and he was 1/2 way down the hill from my house!!  Second time was a bit better.  Third time a different delivery guy actually came to the door, but then complained about having to deliver.  I gave a pretty good tip, and he COMPLAINED ABOUT THE AMOUNT!  I only live like 4 blocks from the place, by the way.  After that I stopped ordering.", "author": "Bruce S."}

It wasn't very crowded so it was nice to have most of the place to ourselves. The environment is nothing to marvel over, but it certainly has character.\n\n1/2 Star for Food - Certain dishes tastes like frozen dim sum, while others are decent, but nothing I had blew me anyway. Also the portions of dim sum are super tiny. You should expect to order about 5-6 orders just for yourself in order to stay from being hungry.\n\n1/2 Star for Service - Our server was efficient and polite, brought us water and tea within moments of being seated. The food took awhile to come out, even with only two other tables in the place.\n\n1/2 Star for Convenience - apparently there was confusion as to when it opened. We were told, either online or by the person who answered the phone, that it was open at 10am, but it actually opened at 11am. We showed up at 10:15 and had to wait. Not a big deal thought. \n\n1 Star for Overall Experience - Good company made for a good meal, also our meal was cheap, like $10 per person and we ordered a lot. Nothing spetacular on this menu, and I'm unsure if i'd drive all the way there just to go back.", "author": "Kev C."}

Filler -- I hate places that pervert delicious dimsum by introducing cabbage, lettuce, and carrots as filler where it does not belong. why? Why is there cabbage in my shrimp rice roll? More shrimp!

Their dim sum is pretty tasty and I don't know of any other place in the Inner Mission that has dim sum.  Its a little on the salty side and a little bit more expensive than your average dim sum, but its a good find if you're having a dim sum craving and don't feel like making a long trip.  The dim sum combo (pork bun, sui mai and har gow) does the trick for lunch.  I'd go 4 starts for that.\n\nI just tried my first delivery from here and it was pretty average.  Had mango chicken and broccoli prawns.  The meats seemed good-- no worries about it being a mystery animal, excessively greasy, or containing large amounts of rat droppings, etc... but neither dish had a lot of flavor.  \n\nI'm going to stick to dim sum at the Big Lantern and keep trying on delivery places.

We had a selection of dim sum items: Shrimp dumping (har gao), pork dumpling (siu mai), potstickers, pork buns (char siu bao), green onions, roast pork pastry (char siu soo), taro vegetarian pastry.  Shrimp dumpling & pork dumpling were good.  I'd skip the green onion pancake (not enough salt).  Taro pastry was way TOO greasy, I'd skip it.\n\nWe also had the cold sesame noodles appetizer which was absolutely humongous.  You could have this as a full entree for two if you're not that hungry, one if you're starving.  I will say that I thought this could also use a little more salt.  For a vegetable we had sauteed pea sprouts.  It was quite good, and not too greasy, but yet again I think it needed a little more salt.  \n\nMaybe this place just worries about hypertension?

Best chinese in the city. \n\nThe delivery can be a bit slow, but the delivery dudes are super friendly and will even come find your desk at work if they know where you sit (I order too much from there, hell). \n\nI've tried a bunch of their dishes, but here's some of the best:\n\nBig Lantern Spicy Fried Rice: This rice is the shit. Loaded with shrimp, pork, beef, and chicken, it is greasy as hell, but your body is loving every minute of it (until later on, but who cares about that right now). I've contemplated laying the rice out on a paper towel when I bring it home (I often order and bring it back to the east bay as NO chinese hits the spot like Big Lantern) to suck up some of the grease, but the grease level will never stop me from ordering this amazing dish.\n\nGeneral/Five Spice Sesame Meatless Chicken: What? Oh my god. Perfection. Tastes just like chicken for those of you who don't eat a lot of tofu (and those who do). Fantastic flavor and crispy broccoli with it.\n\nAll of the Dim Sum is fantastic, especially the pork and/or chicken Siu Mai. I also recommend the bacon shrimp rolls.\n\nThe salt and pepper chicken wings are to die for and will leave you wanting a nap IMMEDIATELY after. The flavor is right (all the way down to the squirs of lemon and the diced garlic that garnishes the dish) and the batter is golden-fried to perfection. These are chicken wings that you will want to get every time. \n\nIf you work in the city and you need food delivered, this place is your best bet if you've got something to busy you for about 45 minutes to an hour for the delivery wait.", "author": "Chris M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-21", "description": "I stopped eating Chinese food after I discovered how consistently better Thai restaurants tend to be. My brother used to work as a waiter in a Chinese restaurant in Northampton, MA and told me about how they \"recruit\" their chefs. Basically, they would take the day's pick of immigrants  who somehow got to New York City and sent them to a crash course Chinese American cooking \"school\". From there, they were sent out around the east coast to cook up familiar greasy spoon standards for round eyes with one day off every month or so, presumably working off some kind of indentured servitude. At any rate, the point is they were not cooks in China, just trying to make an honest buck in the US, and they apparently preferred to make items not on the menu for their own meals. But I digress. \n\nSo Big Lantern, really good. Great Dim Sum, great soups (try the mixed wonton with wonton, shrimps and other real pieces of seafood). Seafood Claypot also really good. There are a couple of beef dishes that are deep fried beyond belief but really tasty. They serve brown rice as an option which I particularly appreciate. Haven't tried the faux chicken. Onion pancakes always a favorite. Nice, healthy food, also open late night. Same owner as Jasmine tea house on Mission. You can line up around the block for an hour after looking 30 minutes for parking to get some really run-of-the-mill food at House of Nan King with your Aunt and Uncle from Montana or get hip and go to Big Lantern. Another plus, the super cranky waiter seems to have realized that I come in often enough that I'm going to remember what an asshole he was to me last time and now greets me like and old pal.", "author": "Darren K."}

Success!  \n\nAs we eat, I hear faint female voices and notice that it is coming from the semi-open kitchen.  And sure enough there are women cooking in the kitchen as well as men.

It pains me not to give them 5 stars, since their food is so amazing, but because they serve meat, the best I can give them is 4 stars.  This is reminiscent of the Chinese food we always had when I was a kid.  They have so many amazing faux meat dishes.  I know many omnivores who were amazed that they were eating soy chicken.  No trip to Big Lantern is complete without the following: Turnip Cakes with Meatless Veggie Chicken, Veggie Fried Rice (hold the egg), Curry Noodles and Sesame Meatless Chicken.  The service is always fast when you dine in.  They also deliver, which is awesome, and the food is usually delivered within 30-45 minutes.", "author": "Dana P."}

I would highly recommend this place ONLY for the 'meatless chicken' options, which are all delicious -- I especially recommend the 5 spice sesame and the kung pao.  Even meat-eaters will like them, promise.  The meat and seafood options are.... not good.  At all.  Also, do NOT get delivery; we live three blocks away but were feeling lazy on a stormy night so we ordered delivery -- our cold, greasy food arrived nearly two hours later.  5 stars for the meatless chicken options but 1 or 2 stars for everything else averages out to 3 stars.", "author": "Sarah B."}

Eating in the restaurant is also a pleasant experience as the waiters are friendly and provide good recommendations.  \n\nWould suggest getting the onion pancakes, AKA scallion pancakes in some restaurants.

She had never had them before, so we asked the waiter his opinon of them. He informed us they had actually won a reader's guide poll in some SF weekly newspaper for best asian resturaunt in the mission just BECAUSE of their turnip cakes. We went with the recommendation and didn't regret it. It comes with I think a peanut sauce (not sure, i didn't use it, put soy sauce on mine instead), but its something I'd definitely recommend.\n\nService was fast and courteous, we went when it wasn't very busy, probably around 9 or 10, so there wasn't much of a crowd.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-07-24", "description": "We are always on the lookout for quality chinese food delivery in the Church/Mission/Duboce triangle areas, and were dissapointed by Big Lantern.  Since Hunan Garden is closed on Saturday, we gave these jokers a try.   The minimum standard for good chinese delivery is speed of delivery and convenience.\r\n\r\nFirst, the delivery took about 40 minutes, as promised.  After getting spoiled by the fact that Hunan Garden always takes no more than 20 minutes despite always warning 40, this was a small disappointment.  Second, the food was terribly packaged!  Only the rice came in the traditional chinese food delivery container box, while the mu shu chicken, orange chicken, and sesame beef came in squarish styrofoam containers.  Thus, almost half the sauces and juices in those three dishes had already spilled out of the styrofoam-box-thingy by the time it came to us, soaking both the bag and making all the containers in the bag super-sloppy and wet.   These guys seriously need to invest in the fold-top doggy bags.\r\n\r\nThe mu shu chicken was the best item....they give you a ton, and although the mu shu pancakes were thin, delicate, and non-tortilla-like (which is a good thing), they proved strong and resilient against the common problem of mu shu-rupture...they easily withstood the pressures of plum sauce and over-stuffing the pancake.  Both the orange chicken and sesame beef were sitting on top of very thin and liquidy sauces.  The orange chicken was solid, with lean meaty portions of chicken. The problem was that each piece barely had any sauce on it or soaked into it, because the sauce had (sadly) already departed the flimsy container it came in.   The sesame beef had an odd sour taste with some undercooked broccollinis at all four corners.  Since most of the sesame beef sauce had already spilled out and was all over the place, it really put a damper on the festivities.     The whole point of delivery is to have a delicious, convenient pre-made meal delivered to your door, ready to eat.  The spectacular mess brought to us by Big Lantern failed on all those counts.", "author": "Dan L."}

Still, what's a girl to do when she has an immediate and necessary Chinese food craving to attend to??\nEnter Big Lantern. Reasonably priced, especially for Mission Chinese food, and reasonably tasty.\nI've gotten take out from here a few times, and have yet to have eaten here, but so far the round of dishes have been okay--not sub-par, but not amazing, just good enough to pass the craving test. My favorite so far is the Singapore Rice Noodles, a dish that I've easily seen go wrong or simply not exist on other restaurant menus because of its slight difficulty in perfecting fried rice noodles and combing it with all sorts of goodies like chili peppers, curry powder, onions, bell peppers, chicken, chau sau, shrimp and bean sprouts, yum!!!\nWell, Big Lantern almost hits the mark but leaves out key ingredients (very little meat, absolutely no chau sau), and the veggies look a little sad... a bit overcooked perhaps. Still, quite tasty and as close to the real thing as I've seen in this district. They do delivery and pick-up and have a plethora of authentic as well as American-style items to try, so another plus for variety.\nMy Singapore Noodles are $7.95 without tax and, since I never eat there, I never have to bother with tip, so it comes to about $9 for rice noodles. The serving deals out about 2 large portions or 3 small portions, so easy two-days worth of yummy dinners.\nFor AMAZING Chinese...

I have probably ordered delivery at least 50 times from this place, and always by calling directly - I've never used a third party service (I think third party services take too long).  I, too, am a former Jasmine Tea House fan that converted to Big Lantern.\n\nThey've never been egregiously late.  They've always had proper change for me.  The order has always been correct.  I've only ever gotten one dim sum dish that was poorly prepared.  Sometimes the sauces leak a little into the delivery bag, but this is not an uncommon occurrence when you order delivery.\n\nWhen you find your favorite dishes at this place, they're delicious and consistent.  I cried when they took the shanghai-style rice cake off the menu, but the numbing spicy noodles, flaming chili fish, szechwan chicken, mu shu pork, and spicy string beans happily filled the gap.  No, this place isn't completely mind-blowing, but it's filled a need wonderfully for me for over a year now.  \n\nI don't care if the authenticity police call it Americanized.  Lots of noble cuisines in this world have been created by people moving to a new land and adapting their cuisine to the ingredients and styles of their new home.  To bag on that is to be a hater, straight up.\n\nThe only reason it's not getting five stars is because, well, Great Eastern is the best...  Henry's Hunan is in second...", "author": "Kenois M."}

The beef satay was nothing more than beef with vegetables and a brown sauce; no spice, no \"peanut\" taste that I'd expect with the mention of \"satay sauce.  Again, meh.

My favorites are the Hong Kong style pan fried noodles, the meatless chicken (non-fried), and the meatless combination plate. Substitutions are definitely ok, and sometimes it may even become a new menu dish! The staff are courteous, they work very well to keep things going,  and service is very prompt. When dining in late, they do not rush you and one can thus savor the meal. I am a repeat customer and will go back again. I also enjoy ordering delivery...Although I don't live far away, the staff always say that it my food will arrive in 45 minutes...and then it seems to arrive in 15. :D", "author": "Ursula E."}

In particular, the Sesame Meatless Chicken is one of my favorite dishes ever!   The sauce is perfect and the meatless chicken makes me almost question if they screwed up my order and gave me the real thing.  I went Vegan for animal compassion reasons, not because I hated the taste of meat/chicken so I want that fake meat to taste pretty close to the unfortunately murdered and tortured real thing.  They do a very convincing job of it and I have to remind myself that the amazing Sesame Meatless Chicken was not an animal with a Central Nervous System who was locked in a cage, beaten, tortured and then finally killed to feed my face.  Now doesn't that just make you want to switch to delicious meatless versions such as those that Big Lantern offers?  YES ON PROP 2!  The decor/ambiance is great and the service good. Go order the Sesame Meatless Chicken!  Do something positive for the World for once and enjoy it at the same time.  Go Vegan!", "author": "Roy J."}

It was good but the food was mysterious and reminded me of jelly fish and other radio active deep sea creatures.  Sometimes the crab legs would poke out just a bit wrapped around fried stuff.   And there were sweet buns that were bright white on the exterior  like a babies sunless bum.  And things called \"puffs\" and \"tin foiled wrapped chicken\".  The chicken should have been called pepper chicken because it was soooo peppery.  All these little dishes to share was nice and added to the conversation had it ever slowed.  The titanic song seemed to play in the background for a long time at a very slow calming entrancing way...It was warm inside and pretty peaceful.  To me it is funny because the outside looks like it might be modern inside and all hip like.  But inside it was all straight laced and traditional with gold fish and pink cloth napkins.   It was good but not great but oh so cheap!!! It was some 30 odd dollars for 4 hungry people to get stuffed to the brim!", "author": "Lauren S."}

I will not mention the names of the third rate establishments banned from bringing greasy grossness to my door, but will laud this 2nd rate establishment for the impossible: They delivered three chinese food dishes that tasted TOTALLY DIFFERENT from each other. I know you know what I mean here. The mango chicken was tender, tons of garlic, and chock full of fresh mango. The vegetable fried rice was, you know, rice, soy, veggies, but good! I asked for the mixed vegetables \"szechuan\" style which thoroughly upset the phone guy, but we got the spiciest, most gingery, best version of this usually boring dish I've ever had. A real mix of things, not just carrots, onions and cabbage. Pot sticker filling was ok, but I don't go for those doughy wrappers. The curry puffs were yummy.

I ordered mostly dim sum  tonight and, although I didn't expect much since it was delivery, I didn't think it would be that bad. As soon as I tried the pork shui mai, I knew something was wrong -- it had a weird taste and was waaaaaaay too salty. The other dishes didn't taste any better either. Once my stomach started hurting, I couldn't eat anymore and decided to throw everything away. Plus, their dim sum isn't cheap either, but i guess there has to be some sort of premium for having dim sum delivered to your doorsteps (even if it's terrible). Not sure where the positive reviews below are coming from, but I'm assuming if their dim sum is this bad, then their other dishes can't be any better.", "author": "Peter C."}

I went with a large group so we got a great dinner menu planned by the gracious and friendly owner.    We started with chive dumplings, Shanghai soupy pork dumplings, stuffed mushroom, mushu pork, peking duck, and duck soup with winter melon.  I was in foodie heaven.  The big platters came next - shrimp with snow peas and lily flower; seafood medley of scallop, shrimp, squid, clams, and fish with mushrooms and snow peas; garlic spinach; tofu with bamboo skin; west lake fish (flounder filet); onion and pepper lamb.  For dessert, we each got a coconut milk egg custard tart.  It was truly sublime and easy on the wallet.  We had 8 people and it was $25-30 per person for all that food which included about 10 beers.  If that's too pricey, go for lunch or just dim sum.  The rice dishes for lunch are from $4.95 - 7, and the dim sum dishes start at $2.50.  Go.  Your taste buds will thank you.", "author": "Lisa F."}

I will NEVER order from this place again. The story is I ordered food from them on Saturday night. The food was fine, really nothing special. What has completely turned me off from them is that they charged someone elses order to my card that night (along with my own). I called them immediately when I realized that I had two charges from their restaurant in one night and was told by the gentleman who answered the phone that he would have to speak with his manager. The next day after not hearing back from anyone I called again and was again and told they would look at their receipts and credit car transactions. Finally three days after the initial call I was called back and told that they couldn't credit my credit card and asked if I had friends that lived on Church Street who may have used my credit card. I told them that absolutely wasn't the case and they offered to give me a store credit. So even when they realized that they had charged my card for two different orders and one was clearly not mine they still wouldn't refund me my money. At that point, I realized that the only way I was going to get my money back from them was to dispute the charge so have now taken it up with my credit card company. Needless to say I will NEVER order food from Big Lantern again and I would advise anyone paying with a credit card to never order from them either.", "author": "Mara Z."}
