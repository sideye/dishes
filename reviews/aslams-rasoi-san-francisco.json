The moist and tender lamb biryani and the naan was satisfying. Mildly spicy was just hot enough for me. The mix of the flavors was invigorating.", "author": "GARY C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-25", "description": "Came in here for a date night on Friday - night started off right as we found parking right outside the restaurant on Valencia (applause) , the place wasn't crowded as this time and we were promptly seated . We started off with the special beer on draft (chimay) , gobi pakoda and chicken tikka. I usually hesitate to order pakoda's as they are oily and leave you full before the meal arrives but my husband is a bug sucker for gobi and the pakoda's didn't disappoint- they were light and fluffy and perfectly seasoned. \n\nThe chicken tikka was the best I have ever had in SF, perfectly moist and marinated - I did find that the pieces sitting on the hot serving plate became a little hard by the time we got to it, so we should have pulled them all into our plates as soon as they arrived.\n\nWe got the kulcha and paneer makhani for entrees - we asked for spicy and it was spicy :D they had used black pepper to make it spicier rather than the traditional red chilli so it did become a little too much for us. We got 2 kulcha's but 1 would have been just fine.\n\nFor dessert, they only had kulfi with pistachio - it was pretty good :)\n\nThere was some error in our bill so we got some complementary mango lassi which was yummy and shall be ordered next time.\n\nI would totally take people to this restaurant, good service - good food - place to breathe .

As for the ambiance, it's well lit, spacious by SF standards, and quiet enough to hold a real dinner conversation. If you go early enough it's not packed and there's rarely a wait, though it picks up after 8. A great sit down place in the hood and at a moderate price.\n\nSaag Paneer - Creamy, but not too oily, you can taste the spinach!\nLamb Rogan Josh - Meh, not that much protein only a few chunks.

It was delicious - creamy and full of good flavor. There was not a whole lot of chicken but there was a large amount of sauce. I wish that rice came with the dish to help mop up the sauce! The garlic naan was also really good and full of flavor. Overall it was a tad expensive but I guess this is standard for SF.", "author": "Amy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-15", "description": "There are quite a few sure-fire Indian restaurants in the Mission from the no-frills tandoori delights of Alhamra to the tasty small plates at DOSA to the veggie nirvana of Udupi Palace to the addictive goat korma at Deccan Spice. In other words, there's a lot of selection if you're in a South Asian culinary mood. Perhaps the plethora of choices is the reason Jamie W. and I have bypassed this somewhat more higher-end spot on Valencia, even though we heard it was among the best of the bunch. We've also been scrupulously watching our intake of food for the past several months and benefiting from our healthy outlook in many ways including our evolving taste in Indian food.\n\nThat meant we bypassed the naans, the samosas, and even the papadum in favor of the $5 Kachumber, a delightfully light, sharable salad of fresh cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes with fresh herbs and lime juice (photo: http://bit.ly/2upWc24). It managed to lend fresh crunch and cleanse our palates for the treats to come. The centerpiece of our order was the $22 Full Tandoori Chicken, which we hadn't had for many a month. It was indeed a full chicken cut up and marinated in yogurt and spices and served on a metal platter rather than the standard black cast-iron plate (photo: http://bit.ly/2t1U25c). Perhaps because we hadn't had it in a while, the poultry tasted particularly satisfying that night, comparable to our gold standard at Alhamra.\n\nWhile Jamie focused on the breasts, I went headlong into the drumsticks and thighs and enjoyed the tender meat and charred skin. To offset the protein, we ordered one of our favorites, the $11 Bhindi Masala, a plate of okra saut\u00e9ed with bell peppers, onions, fresh tomatoes, and spices that wasn't too saucy and provided a fresher taste than most we've tried in the city (photo: http://bit.ly/2vodN7R). We were particularly won over by the $11 Dal Saag, a saucy plate of fresh spinach with lentils, herbs, and spices that had just the right mix of flavors to complement the chicken (photo: http://bit.ly/2te2Ys2). No jasmine rice for us as we were watching our carb intake, and it was good to see they offer vegan and gluten-free options for the true health nuts.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...fresher Indian food than the norm with some particularly tasty spice mixes thrown in\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...one of the nicer Indian restaurants d\u00e9cor-wise, more spacious than you would expect\nSERVICE - 3 stars...reasonably alert though a bit more elusive as the evening progressed\nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely on the short list for solid Indian food even if it is a tad pricier than most spots", "author": "Ed U."}

When we passed up Dosa (a block down) to come here, I assumed it was a more affordable option, and it was not. The server was very nice and helpful. When we were unsure about which type of samosa to order in our appetizer sampler, she suggested the jalape\u00f1o/cheese samosa. The pakoras in the sampler were amazing! The chutneys were very unique - the green chutney was creamy, the red chutney had a plum sauce consistency. We went with a rice, baingan bhartha, butter chicken (our indicator of how \"good\" the Indian restaurant is) and garlic naan. We like Little Delhi's less creamy, spicy butter chicken, but this was the best garlic naan we've had... maybe ever! I'd definitely go here again!", "author": "Zinia G."}

(5/5)\n- Tandoori Chicken looked amazing and I loved the presentation. The meat was tender, but did not consist of as much flavor as I was hoping. (4/5)\n- Murgh Makhani (Butter Chicken) was good, but again not as much flavor as we were hoping. Portions were also pretty small, so if you're hungry you might need two orders. (3/5)\n- Garlic Naans were light and fluffy and you could tell they were fresh... but they were lacking the taste of garlic (4/5)\n\nOverall, I think this is a great place to go on date or for a special occasion with family/friends.

Minor saving graces were the roti and daal but barely. 2 stars had this been a $ restaurant but such food for the price was nothing short of a joke. We decided to skip the beer and try the rasoi chai. I've made bad chai in my life by overboiling the tea grinds but this was wayyy worse.

From the Vegetarian Samosas to the Goat Cheese Naan to the Garlic Naan to the Paneer Makhani, everything was just okay.  The samosas were small and narrow in flavor spectrum.  The naans were not fluffy and flaky, as I imagined they would be, but rather on the denser side.  The Paneer Makhani (one of my favorites) -- indeed all of the curries -- were thin (my dinner companion ordered a chicken dish which had the same anorexic consistency).  I prefer body to my Indian curries, thickness and creaminess.  There was none of that here.\n\nService was borderline terrible.  The servers and food runners were all pleasant, but after our order was taken, no one came back to check on us, refill our water, or take empty plates away.

The dishes here are fairly authentic (well, for an Indian restaurant in the US). Especially their murgh makhani, chicken korma, and dal makhi are amazing. What I especially love about the place is the consistency of their food and that in my experience is hard to find for Indian restaurants. I also love how they have incorporated south asian flavor to seemingly bland things such as salad! I was very pleasantly surprised with their salad when I found hints of cumin and garam masala in the dressing--innovative!\n\nSecond, the ambiance is great for a mid price level Indian place. I love their window seats as it offers a great view. Their service is great--once I was almost late to a concert and upon informing them they served us really fast. \n\nFinally, their food ingredients are fresh and the meat quality is great, which I personally appreciate a lot.

Two legs, a breast, and another piece (thigh?).  I love that this comes out sizzling - makes for a really impressive dish to order. The chicken has incredible texture, even though it's pretty standalone without sauce. It's very moist and soft, yet has a great char from being baked. I really liked mixing the grilled veggies in the rogan josh sauce too (below).\n\n~~LAMB SPECIALTIES~~\nMenu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aslams-rasoi-san-francisco?select=Kx06C6bD_0dilIzs2r4noA#_QGkTOOBWEMdjOp0lFu-xA\n* Rasoi's Rogan Josh - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aslams-rasoi-san-francisco?select=Kx06C6bD_0dilIzs2r4noA#ty4zHlx6xZeXLLg7ZvFuyg\n(Classic lamb curry cooked w/ ginger, garlic, onions and safron. $14)\nWe were deciding between this and the kebab. I appreciated that our server was honest and said since we were having tandoori already, we should go for this one (even though it was the cheaper option!). He was right about having this variety. The sauce was thick, had great texture. The lamb was very hearty - a little hard almost. It would have been very dry if it weren't served int eh sauce. A little disappointing that there was way more sauce than lamb - for the entire plate of sauce, the lamb took up less than 1/3 of the area of the plate.\n\n~~RICE SPECIALTIES~~\n* Pulao - 3 stars\n(Basmati rice cooked w/ saffron, cumin, cardamom and cinnamon. $3)\nThe long grain rice could've beeen a little more soft/sticky. On the menu, this sounds really impressive with all the spices, but I couldn't taste most of it. Plus you end up eating this with other dishes, like the rogan josh, which always have much more flavor and will cover up what little there is in the rice. This came with exactly two green peas.

The lightest, slightest layer of crisp. Perfectly soft on the inside. However, it wasn't exactly \"stuffed\" with goat cheese, and we didn't taste any bell peppers. The first piece we had was phenomenal - it had a huge chunk of goat cheese on top, was slightly sweet, and was like an indian flavored pizza. But later we realized this was basically all the goat cheese since there was no more *inside* the naan, the rest of the pieces were rather bland.\n\n~~DESSERT~~\n* Saffron pistachio ice cream - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aslams-rasoi-san-francisco?select=Kx06C6bD_0dilIzs2r4noA#Kx06C6bD_0dilIzs2r4noA\nThis didn't look very impressive but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Texture-wise, it honestly looked similar to a frozen block of canned tang (except it wasn't orange, obviously) that was sliced up. It looks kind of cheap, frosted over, not very creamy. The flavor was quite startling - there were hints of cardamom, horchata (maybe some sort of rice flavor?), and lots of other wonderful things we couldn't place. As the edges of this dessert started melting, it became much more soft and creamy. I liked that it also didn't have a completely homogeneous texture - there was something a little chunky/nutty in there (maybe pistachios?). Overall, I loved this!", "author": "Ziyan C."}

The staff is really warm/friendly, and authentic, this ain't no Mission Chinese with Caucasian hipster waiters. The location is awesome, if you're bougey like me you can park in the garage on 21st without leaving the sidewalk (or take the BART and walk over to Valencia if Uber pool is too rich for your blood)\n\nFood Commentary:\nAs an Asian yuppie who has eaten my fair share of Indian, I learned there are 5 things you can always safely order at an Indian joint... 1) chicken tikka masala 2) tandoori chicken 3) samosas 4) garlic naan 5) saag paneer (not sure if its served here)... I always get #1-4 when I am here, which uncomfortably fills 2 jumbo Murican sized people but I imagine naan/rice can stretch it to fill 4 people if you're being really cheap or anorexic\n\n1) Aslam's chicken tikka masala sauce is best described as Indian Boudin's clam chowder with a lot of crack sprinkled on it. I can drink a gallon of this stuff, it is so good! With rice, chicken, naan or your fingers - it always feels so good when it hits the lips!!!\n\n2) Aslam's tandoori chicken is best on the bone, and it falls right off the bone. It is juicy, tender, and probably one of my favorite chicken dishes out there. Imagine getting a Costco rotisserie chicken and making it 100x better for only 2-3x the price.\n\n3) Samosas are always awesome to get that appetite going, they give you a few cool sauces that I don't use. That's like putting ketchup on a steak.\n\n4) Garlic naan is complementary (I think), and I always ask for more. Personally I like eating the tikka masala sauce with naan the most, though the rice here is amazing too (their basmati has a really great texture to it, and I know my rice)\n\n*Tip: Order your girl a mango lassi, I heard the secret is they use Mitchell's ice cream\n\nTrust me, this is unbiased, I usually dread Indian food but I LOVE this place.

On this meal we scraped our plates clean, which came to $23/person with tip. We ordered an entree each + 2 orders rice + 3 orders naan + 1 beer (the rest had water). As a control factor for this comparison, I usually order the same dish because I tend to love it so much (mattar paneer). \n\nThat said, it wasn't just the portion size that had us scraping our plates clean: the food was really, really good. One of our party had a curry dish with pineapple (pineapple, really?) that was amazing. \n\nNoise - The high ceilings and hard floors make lots of echoes, to the point where we had trouble hearing each other across the table.

So, I don't feel truly qualified to rate Indian cuisine, so take this review with a grain of salt.\n\nWith that said...my litmus test for Indian food has always been based off one particular restaurant in Campbell, California...called the Royal Taj.  The food at the Royal Taj is delightfully spicy and simply delicious, so much so that even thinking about it makes my mouth begin to water.  Everywhere I've ever traveled or had the opportunity to eat Indian food...it was always been compared to the Royal Taj.  \n\nSo...pretty much every Indian place I've ever eaten at has always fallen just short of the Royal Taj...often the food was either under-spiced...or very bland...obviously being altered to accommodate their customer base.\n\nHowever, Aslam's Rasoi is the first Indian place that actually exceeded what has long been held as my favorite Indian restaurant.  \n\nThe wait staff was knowledgeable about the menu and quick with recommendations...and were very friendly and quick.\n\nAs for what we had...we got the Assorted Appetizer platter...and I don't know every single item on it...but everything was excellent.\n\nWe also got the Chicken Tikka (everyone knows this one)...Karahi Gosht (a lamb dish cooked with butter, ginger, and spices)...Chicken Jalfrezi (chicken cooked with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, herb and spices)...and Paneer Tikka Korma (Homemade cheese cooked in a mild creamy sauce with fenugreek)...and an order of assorted Nan to sop up the sauce with...\n\nAll I can say is that everyone liked every dish...and while I was figuring on having a lot of left overs to take home...we devoured everything!  \n\nIf you like Indian/Pakistani food...give this place a try...I know I'll be heading back there next chance I get.", "author": "Richard J."}

Well, silly, it's the nine days a year to try places you've always wanted to try in the Mission but haven't tried yet because you're tired of dealing with hipsters and techies.  During TotMW, aka Burning Man, you can do as I did and have Aslam's Rasoi all to yourself because all the hipsters are getting high and dirty in Nevada, and some of the techies are there as well because they think they're hipsters and have way too much money not to spend it on made-to-order art and really expensive drugs.\n\nThe food was good.  The sauce in one of the dishes reminded me of the sauce that comes with the malai kofta at Chaat Cafe in Berkeley.  I wasn't expecting that flavor pairing with what I was eating, but it wasn't bad, just surprising.  All the ingredients seemed fresh, and the naan was delicious.  This place definitely gets high marks for its naan.\n\nThe service was good, but I did feel strange being the only person here.  I think the workers were also puzzled by how dead it was at dinnertime.

If ever I'm facing an ingredient-free fridge and takeout is the answer, I think of Aslam's Rasoi.  The food is delicious.  The flavors are deep and complex and the execution of the basics is spot-on.\n\nThe pulao is superb, the grains are separate and distinct, tender but toothsome.  As a rice enthusiast, this is important to me!  The naan is similarly perfect.  A little charred, a little crispy, and very chewy and bubbly.\n\nI always get the chicken tikka masala and it is fantastic.  The meat is tender and juicy with a hint of smokiness which is delightful.  The sauce is flavorful and rich.  Last time I requested \"spicy\" on my order and they did deliver! It was HOT! \n\nThe samosas can be a little bit hit or miss, but last time they were great.  What I appreciate most is that the pastry itself is well seasoned and delicious.\n\nMy main complaint is probably more an issue with Grubhub, but occasionally I'll log in to place my order, only to see that I'm \"outside the delivery radius\" and I can only order for pickup.  Mind you, I've successfully had their food delivered to my apartment many many times.  But now and then, there's some sort of malfunction.

The only reason I say it's pretty good is that the I thought the chicken Tikka was a little dry although the sauce is delicious, and the papadam was just okay.  I'm comparing the papadam's you get in London with an array of different sauces - chutney's and other.  It was very minimal of choices and I didn't like the fact that it's a shared container vs specific for the table use only.\n\nThe best thing we had was the Dal and Saag Gosht (Lamb) - definitely up to par of what I'm used to at a good Indian restaurant.

You aren't jammed next to other diners and there is room to move about. Nicely decorated, in that it's comfortable and soothing to the eye. \n\nThe service was great, and I really enjoyed our plucky server, Rosie. She was very accommodating to my best friend and I. We were seated right away and our water glasses were always full. The food came out quickly and everything was hot and fresh.\n\nThe drawbacks were few, but noticeable. They were \"out\" of chai when we got there, which was after dinner rush. I'm not exactly sure how they were \"out\" of a staple at an Indian restaurant, but oh well. Things started to go sour when we were told they were also out of kheer (Indian rice pudding). Our server did suggest another dessert, but we weren't a fan of it. \n\nWe almost left because they were out of two of our favorite Indian dishes. \n\nInstead of chai, Rosie brought us two other Indian drinks--a rose water infused Lassi and a special lemonade made with a hint of cardamom. Both were good, but it didn't hit the spot like chai would've.\n\nThe entrees weren't overly portioned (most likely not big enough to share if you have an appetite) and seemed dare I say bland. They give you a hearty serving of rice. \n\nThough it has nothing to do with service or quality, the people sitting next to us were incredibly loud and obnoxious and I got to hear all about this Marina girl's torrid romp on the roof of a building.

It really is a taste explosion. \n\nRecommendations:\n\nPrawn Korma - Yum! In fact, all the Korma dishes are good.\n\nRaita - One of my favorite things ever. These guys introduced me to one of my top 5 favorite foods. \n\nNaan - What more to say? This stuff is \"moorish\" as my English girlfriend would say\n\nThe food here is delicious, however the staff makes it that much better. We have always been treated with lots of attention and feel like family (although a very pale skinned family) when we're there.", "author": "Robert B."}

This is a family runned business and every employee provided me with excellent customer service. The signature dish they serve here are the lamb chops. The chef explained to me that it's marinated for 24 hours to keep the excellent taste. I would definitely recommended this to anyone who likes Pakistani and Indian food! The restaurant is also very clean and they rate 100% on the food safety scorecard.

The first time was with my brothers of my fraternity where we had reserved a large table, the second time was with my girlfriend.\n\nMy brothers have organized a very nice dinner for 16-20 of us, the restaurant was very accommodating when we had to add another seating arrangement.  The food was excellent, The restaurant was very nice in splitting the bill for all of us.  A brother and I decided to share so we can try more of their dishes.\n\nTheir samosas are very good, the chicken vindaloo was juicy, and the lamb biryani was decent.  Can't forget about the naan.  Service was excellent and we were all served in a timely manner, even for a large group.  This visit deserved 4 stars.\n\nMy second visit with my girlfriend was different.  We were seated quickly with a slight wait on a Friday night, it helped that I found parking nearly in front of the restaurant so we weren't terribly starving at that point.  We were seated near the corner near a corner table, and the way they packed the tables was inconvenient.  My chair was bumped when the patrons at the table next to us got up to use the facilities and when they left.  The table arrangements could be better.  I've ordered exact same items as when I was with my brothers, except the lamb and the chicken was over cooked.  The samosas were still amazing and the naan was slightly burnt.  This visit got 3 stars, decent table location, the samosas were the saving grace.\n\nWas the change in quality the difference in party size, because both occasions I have been here was a Friday night and they were just as full.", "author": "Calvin T."}

It came with two small prawns, two thumb sized lamb sausages, two literally bite-sized pieces of lamb, two bite-sized pieces of chicken, and a very petite, slim piece of tilapia cut in half.  It cost $22.  It was delicious, but for the amount of food, presentation, preparation, and decor, it was not worth it.\n\nI'm not against paying for good food, but Aslam's pricing, on average, makes it more expensive on average than Mission Chinese Food and Udupi Palace (similar restaurants arguably at the top of their niche) and about as expensive as Beretta or Pizzeria Delfina.  Aslam's is not comparable in decor, service, or vibe to either.  \n\nI recommend the food at Aslam's, but be careful.  It looks and feels like a chill, neighborhood restaurant that serves good food, but the pricing makes it more of a special occasion place.

Let me tell you...as a Kashmiri, I take my Rogan Josh / lamb dishes VERY seriously...it's in my blood. And this one rivals the most authentic Kashmiri Rogan Josh I've had in India)\n\nthe -1 star is for the lousy service...we came in around 9:30, when the restaurant was half-empty, and still had to wait 20 minutes to get a table (inefficient)...we decided to wait by the bar, and it took 25 minutes to get a glass of wine and beer (yes, your math is right...we got our drinks AFTER we were seated, even though we ordered at the bar). \n\n^^ That's nonsense. If this restaurant wants to be taken seriously among the dining elite (which I think it really has potential to do), then it needs to drop the Indian Standard Time and get it's act together with fantastic service. \n\nPS: Pro tip, they have a little romantic corner table on the left side of the entrance which you should snag if you're with a significant other", "author": "Meghana D."}

It kind of went downhill from there...\n\n1) Really REALLY small portions! $14 for a lamb korma that had less than ten small cubes of lamb (they were roughly 1-inch cubes, some smaller). My bf said it was really good, but he was sad about how little meat he got. The veggie jalfreezi needed to be at least 2-3 times bigger to be worth $11. It also felt really processed, there was definitely frozen corn/peas/carrots in the mix, which really makes the dish look and taste cheap. The sauce for the jalfreezi was thin and a bit runny.\n\n2) You get nickeled and dimed here. No sauces, no sides included in any meals. We had to order a side of tzatiki as well as any carb (rice/naan) that we wanted for our food. With how small the portions are for the price, I would've expected at least rice included. No such luck. We had to order two portions of garlic and basil naan. It was super tasty, but we only got 4 squares of pita per order ($3 an order). \n\n3) Friendly service but slow slow slow. It wasn't very packed, but nobody ever refilled our water and it took us about 10 minutes of waiting and waiving people down to get our check. \n\nSucks, but in the end, I would never go back.

There's no real spice in the sauced dishes and by that I mean aromatics.  A great dish should have whole spices in it and there should be bones, not just chunks of dry, lean cubed meat a la Safeway.  Everything is thin and \"soupy\" -- never a good sign -- even the gobi aloo which is frankly impossible to screw up.\n\nMost offensive was one lamb dish that was brought out at a rolling boil -- as if we were eating tofu soup in a Korean joint.  Curries don't need to boiled violently -- there's a reason they taste great straight off a competently done buffet, more so when they're prepared to order.  Boiling destroys the delicate aromatics that make Indian food great.\n\nThe only decent items were the saag paneer and the surprisingly good naan.\n\nI am a strong partisan of great Indian/Pakistani food, and this place is definitely off my list -- Lahore Parahi, Naan'n'Curry in South Bay, even Pakwan down the street are all better bets.

But it's also easily some of the best Indian food I've had in a long, long while, even prior to that. Aslam's is actually a family run restaurant, with the current owner, Asif (who was waiting on our table), having taken over the place after his father.\n\nOur group of four ended up ordering the vegetable biryani, machchi makhani, and rogan josh, while Asif comped us a gobi pakoras (one of the guys in my party has been a long-time patron of Aslam's), all of which were solid and tasty. \n\nThe gobi pakoras was a lightly battered cauliflower dish that went well with the two sauces on the table, while the biryani was a surprisingly light rice dish that went well with the two curries. Of the two curries, I was a bigger fan of the lamb rogan josh - a nice and spicy dish which could have benefited from more tender lamb though. The tilapia makhani was also good, but a bit sweeter and milder than I prefer (because the one who ordered it doesn't handle spice as well).\n\nI was already far too stuffed by the end, but the others in the table ordered a couple rounds of Aslam's chai.

This is one of the few places that actually makes my food spicy enough for my tastes (though they're happy to make dishes less spicy).  I have tried most of the things on the menu, and the only thing that was not good was the Achar Pachranga.   So many dishes here are \"favorites,\" that it's impossible for me to order less than 5 items.  I either have to dine with friends or just make a pig of myself.\n\nAmong my favorite dishes are:\n- Kachumber (this is light and refreshing, a great way to start the meal);\n- Raita (their raita is the best I've had in SF, and no matter how much I try, I can't approximate theirs at home); \n- Paneer Makhani (this tastes different than anything else on the menu - rich, buttery, tomato-y, so very good);\n- Seekh Kebab (the meat is very fresh tasting, it's spiced perfectly and delicious with fresh lemon - this is the best seekh kebab I've had anywhere);\n- Lamb Biryani (the lamb here is just wonderful in general);\n- Goat Cheese Naan (normally i am not a fan of cheese mixed with naan but the peppers and green onions make this so tasty).\n\nSee what I mean? This is my minimum order... the tandoori chicken, saag paneer, paneer tikka korma, saag aloo, and karachi gosht are all excellent as well.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant is colorful, and it's pretty clean for the Mission.  The staff is very friendly, though service can be very slow, and they're not the most helpful in answering questions about the menu and ingredients.  I never feel hurried here, even when patrons are waiting for tables, they do nothing to rush you through dinner.

First of all, the staff were very friendly and helpful.  I have a special diet and can't eat certain food and our wait staff was very instrumental as to what I should order.  My wife thought I was being high maintenance, but the waiter was so patient.  We ordered the following:\n-Chicken Tikka Masala\n-Chicken Tikka\n-The spinach with cheese\n-Grilled veggies\n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Tikka were good.  They met our expectations.  The spinach with cheese was my favorite and when I told that to my waiter, he added that they made the cheese in-house.  I've had this dish at various Indian restaurants and I have to admit, the cheese made a difference.  The veggies were ok.  It was just grilled and nothing especial.  I wouldn't have minded, but I thought they over-charged for 6 small pieces of veggies. \n\nThe one caveat is that it is a bit pricey for the amount of food you get.  I've had the same quality of food for less.  Would I go back? Absolutely.  I would rather go here than Roti's.", "author": "N A."}

Even though Aslam's Rasoi had been on my list of places to try for awhile, I hadn't had the opportunity. When we got there, we were told it'd be about a 20-25 minute wait, which we were ok with. While we waited, Asif came by and gave us an update on the table status every 5 minutes or so. Then, to top it off, he gave us complimentary glasses of wine.\n\nASSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is fairly spacious, with high ceilings and lots of tables. Nothing too fancy. There's a full bar, so you can grab a bite there if you want. The atmosphere is lively, some might say loud, but it didn't bother me. Servers are quick and easy to flag down if you need something. \n\nBut service can't be all. The food here was really good too. The mixed pakora was crispy, and came with eggplant, onion, and potato. The mango lassi. It was smack-me-in-the-face good. Prawn biryani definitely had a bit of the spice and was full of nice plump prawns. Aloo gobi had the big ol' chunks of cauliflower, which you could actually taste. I'm not sure if that's normal, but I appreciated it. Chicken tikka masala had a flavorful sauce and tender pieces of chicken. Garlic naan to mop up the smatterings of masala sauce was perfect. A little chewy, a little char. Yeah, boy. Pricewise, it's not cheap. I'd say upper mid-range ($10-15 per dish), Naan ($4). \n\nIf it weren't such an f'ing pain to park in the Mission, I'd probably come here a lot more. We'll have to see if the service and food stay consistent on my return visit, but I'll say that Aslam's Rasoi has crept onto my list of standby restaurants. \n\nASSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!! \n\nSee you next time, buddy.", "author": "Saunders C."}

Friendly, knowledgeable and quick, everything you'd want in a waiter. I found it difficult to read the menu and had to go the bar where there was more light to see what I was reading. \n\nWe ordered the calamari dipped in a chickpea batter as an appetizer. Delicious! The calamari was tender and practically melted in your mouth. \n\nWe shared our entrees which is probably a good thing to do. We had the lamb marsala which had about seven chunks of lamb in a sauce with raisins. It was both sweet and spicy, going well with the plain naan. \n\nThe star of the dinner was the fish tandori. Five chunks of sizzling fish with slivered onions and other veggies. The fish broke apart with a fork and was so tender and flavorful. Definitely try this dish if you visit. \n\nThe rice was also tasty. \n\nAslam's has about five beers on tap. I had a hoppy one with a watermelon finish that was a nice compliment to the spiciness of the food. \n\nWe asked about desserts and Aslam Jr. said they weren't big on desserts, offering just two. We ordered the one that seemed like two donut holes with a warm, sweet sauce. They were just OK.", "author": "Scott S."}

The samosas were fried to a delicious crisp. \n\nThings we had:\nSaag Paneer: vegetable dish with Indian cheese. Very mild tasting cheese but the spinach is simmering in a wonderful slight spice.\n\nChana Masala is a garbanzo beans dish in a complementary sauce (the taste is bean-y and quite mild). \n\nMurgh Makhani is a chicken dish simmering in a buttery sauce with baby tomatoes. Yummy over rice or with naan! \n\nI forgot the name of the other dish that I really liked, but it had a variety of grilled vegetables: sweet potatoes, bell peppers, onions, and some cubes of cheese. Really flavorful. It sizzles on a plate when it comes to you!\n\nThere are many items to try here and the descriptions are very helpful. The wait staff are also happy to recommend or describe something to you. The menu is pretty extensive and has an awesome variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. I saw a table with two ladies who ordered a table full of food. They were hungry!\n\nWe came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and at the end they even brought out some interesting tasting ice cream drizzled with mango lassi. I tasted a bit of ginger in there too. And the waiter with the beard who helped us out was FANTASTIC! Super sweet and accommodating guy.\n\nNice intimate atmosphere but it gets louder during peak dining hours (if you like the clinking of dish and glassware and the chatter of conversations it's a great backdrop for a pleasant dining experience. I do!)\n\nThe only downer here is the PARKING! Or, lack of it. I circled for 25 minutes before finding anything. But it's the Mission, on a weekend, so walk or take public trans if you can. That's not in the restaurant's control so I won't dock stars for that.\n\n5 stars!", "author": "Brandy A."}

It's definitely not a hole-in-the-wall kinda place.\n\nThe food was also pretty good. I tried the Chicken Bartha ($13), which is chicken and eggplant, the Garlic Naan ($3), and the Machchi Pakora appetizer ($8), which was battered and fried fish. The Garlic Naan was a bit crunchy and burnt for my taste, but the fish and chicken were tasty. \n\nOn the other hand:\nYou can get the same quality Indian food for cheaper. I personally don't think that Aslam's was any better than other cheaper places. \n\nTo conclude: \nIf you're looking for an Indian restaurant with a bit more \"atmosphere\", come here. You'll pay a bit of a premium, but the food is tasty. If you're just looking for some cheap Indian takeout, go a couple blocks north to Pakwan on 16th.", "author": "Talia G."}

Usually most places that give you the cilantro sauce give you this watery cilantro mess of a sauce, but instead Aslam's added a bit of cream to the sauce which solves the whole watery mess and the cilantro sauce stays on my papadam instead of rolling off into a green oblivion.", "author": "Terrine B."}

The open kitchen has a lovely wood and colored glass pane above the window.  Food was very good - naan and kulcha were tender and tasty.  Dum Aloo came in a delicious tomatoey sauce.  Tandoori halibut was excellent.  The fish was not overly spiced, many Indian places tend to slather on the masala, but at Aslams the fresh fish taste came through.  I like food that has a good spice balance but not too much heat from chillies.  Aslams Rasoi hit the right note in the medium spice level.\n\nHowever, while the food was very good, the service, though very friendly, and perhaps because of being very friendly, was a bit uneven.   Our naan and kulcha did not get served the same time as the entrees, and it took a couple of tries to get someones attention.

Yup, Aslam's Rasoi deserves an enthusiastic five stars \n\nI had the lamb biryani.  It was a bit too spicy for my tastes, but the overall flavor of it was very fine and delicious.  The next time I order this, I will get it with no heat at all.  I spoke with the waiter (who was the chef's son) and he said that this could very easily be done--they are happy to customize spiciness to your preference.  I also had some of the tandoori chicken--a masterpiece in its own right.\n\nEveryone else here absolutely loved their food.  The service was also excellent.  Our waiter remembered us from last time and was happy to see us return.  This may be the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to--not just for the food but for the overall experience.  It's one of those places that is worth driving out of your way for.

The food actually tastes like you are eating in India / Pakistan which is a plus if you are from there and have trouble finding non americanized indian restaurants. I don't make my way to the mission very often as it's a little far for me but this place is good if you want Indian and are nearby. The service is relatively attentive and most people are pretty good at giving recommendations. Furthermore, it is fairly priced so shouldn't be an expensive meal even at dinner with appetizers, mains and drinks. Recommend the following, i haven't tried any seafood dishes here\n\n-Appetizers: pakora, samosa\n-Chicken: tandoori (they go heavy on the red food coloring and spices so it looks really red and has a lot of flavor), chicken tikka masala (good portion of chicken and not just sauce), chicken jalfrezi\n-Lamb vindaloo\n-Chicken biryani had too much chicken and not enough rice. prefer the vegetable biryani or plain pulao or prawn biryani\n-Vegetables: Dal, Paneer makhani (heavy on the cream sauce), bengan bartha (this is a ton of eggplant and tastes really indian so don't order it if you don't love eggplants), chana masala, mattar paneer, aloo gobi (this is  straight up potatoes and cauliflower - suggest you only order this if you've had it before and know you like it)\n-Naans are big - like the garlic ones and onion kulcha", "author": "sasha h."}

Alphabet Dining, as it's name suggests, is the plan to visit a variety of restaurants in alphabetical order. The first week you go to a restaurant that starts with A, and the following week you dine out somewhere that starts with B, and so on. The catch is that you must go in order, and our group of friends decided to make it even more tricky by only choosing restaurants that none of us have been to. Given the fact that we are ALL San Francisco natives, this is not the easiest of tasks. Luckily San Francisco is a busy, bustling city with a multitude of delicious and diverse restaurants to choose from. Even for natives looking for new eateries. In alphabetical order.\n    I've always heard that you can tell the true quality of a restaurant by how packed it is at any given time. Luckily we had made reservations ahead of time, because though Aslam's was a relatively large venue, every table was filled with people. Mind you, we went in the middle of the week, so I can't imagine how packed it would be on the weekend! Definitely a good sign.\n     The best and worst thing about Aslam's was their enormous selection of delicious curries. We probably spent more time deciding what we were going to order than actually consuming our food. But that may have also been because it was really good and we were really hungry.\n     The food did not disappoint, from the meat plates to the veggie options. We asked for mild to medium spices, and nothing was too spicy or too bland. No complaints here!\n     Shoutout to my friend Chester who didn't tell us until after dinner that he does not care for Indian food.", "author": "Chelsea M."}

I can't recall everything that was ordered but my mother ordered a dish that was gluten and dairy free. The great thing about Indian food is that plenty of the dishes offer these options and she had quite a selection to choose from. My 10 year sister went with Chicken Pakora as well as nibbling off our plates and the starters we ordered. She stated that this was her new favorite restaurant.  For starters we had the Kachumber (cucumber, tomato, onion mixture with lime and herbs) which was so fresh and flavorful; Calamari (very nice breading that wasn't too heavy); Achar Pachranga (a spicy pickle mixture that was a little different and not as popular at the table as the others); and the Chicken Tikka - Tandoori style which was absolutely amazing - the chicken was moist and had the perfect tandoori seasoning flavor of herbs, garlic, spices, and served on a hot skillet with onions and peppers. \n\nFor our entrees my boyfriend had the Rogan Josh with lamb which he rated as being good, cooked well, but the flavors were a bit muddled and didn't pop as much as he hoped they would. My Chicken Jalfrezi on the other hand popped and wow'd myself and my boyfriend. This dish was amazing. I am a huge fan of curries that have the perfect kick of heat - usually my go to is either Madras or Vindaloo but this time I opted for Jalfrezi and am so glad that I did.

They're always great about customizing the dish to your spicy or mild preferences as well.\n\nAs a vegetarian, it passes my test of having plenty of variety (the Chana Masala is also delish) so it's a good spot to take my fellow vegetarian friends. That being said, I've brought along my meat loving pals and they've enjoyed it as well. \n\nThe atmosphere is great, never too loud or crowded but not so dead that I fear the doors will close permanently anytime soon. The service is lovely because all the people that work there are friendly and accommodating. They serve a ginger ale that they'll customize to your taste.", "author": "Christine M."}

One of my companions kept bragging that his dish was the best, but I kept disputing with him that MINE was the yummiest. Heh. What I had was really creamy and heavy. When combined with naan (bread), it was pretty balanced and refreshing. I can't say that I love it though because I am not that used to Indian food, but I don't think it's a hard thing if I give it a couple of more chances. \n\nWhen we came, there wasn't much business.

Please avoid this place and go to a real Indian / Pakistani restaurant. Shalimar does better food than this overpriced establishment. Initially, when I was browsing the menu I thought hey -  this place is very reasonable compared to the likes of Amber. However, when I got the food I understood why. For $12-14 an entree you're being jipped by the quantity and quality. We ordered a nimo pani (they are ripping people off $4 for water and lemon concentrate from costco ... ATLEAST use real lemons! I can make better nimboo pani at home). For our entrees we ordered the chicken bhartha and paneer makhani which were both sub-par. The paneer was too lemony and the base watery. The chicken bhartha was different and I had never had something like that. The garlic naan and raita were good! Now moving on to the wine. We ordered two glasses of Malbec and the wine tasted like it's been open for some time and it tasted very vinigery.

No spice/tea flavor at all. I pointed it out to our server \"My chai doesn't have much flavor and tastes like plain warm milk. Is there anything you can do to make it better?\" and he said \"That's just how we make it. 'Chai' is Indian for tea.\" which I thought was rather insulting. Duh, I know what chai is, and yours sucks. Thanks for not offering to substitute a different drink. My girlfriend got the iced chai and didn't like hers either (she took one sip and left the rest).\n\n2) They asked us how spicy we wanted our dishes on a scale from 1-10.

It is definitely not your Indian Dive joint that you find in the 'Loin, but it is a mid-range family-owned place that does their Food extremely well. The Master Chef and Owner, Mohammed Aslam was from Indian Oven in the Haight formerly and has won many awards from Zagat, SF Weekly, San Francisco Magazine and the like. He opened Aslam's Rasoi in April 2006 where he took over the former restaurant there which was called just Rasoi and thus made it Aslam's Rasoi.  His Son, Asif and Daughter, Sehrish, both work there and are very sweet and extremely accommodating. This is a family operation and they have always made us feel at home there. \n\nSo what else is so great about Aslam's? Well, let me tell you...\n\nFor me, the Curries are perfectly prepared where the Spices are just right. The Meats, from Lamb to Chicken or Prawns are always incredibly tender. And their Menu has many things that you don't typically find in hole-in-the-wall joints. I do have my favorites though, so let me share these with you.\n\nmust-try's if you're into that sort of Dish:\n-if you like Lamb Saag, you HAVE to try theirs.  Meat, juicy, tender, spices, just right...\n-their Chicken Tikka Masala is good, but the Murgh Makhani (Butter Chicken) is better...\n-Love the Karahi Gosht and thier dal is awesome.\n-the Raita is thick and creamy and substantial...  perfect.\n\nBUT, if you try anything.  Anything, at all on their Menu, you HAVE to try the Rasoi's Lamb Chops!   Tender Lamb Chops marinated in homemade Yogurt and Aslam's Spices. You won't find this under the Lamb section, but in the Tandoori section. They are Unbelievably Good! So Tender, Juicy and Succulent... Mmmm...\n\nIt is a wonder that I haven't written about this place sooner. We go here all the time and I mean, all the time! At least once or even twice a week some times, I would say.  I'm not going to lie, we even came here after our lunch at the French Laundry. Sorry FL! This place is great for almost any occasion, from dinner with the girls to large birthday dinners and it is consistently good every time.\n\nTrust me on this one, you have to try it.\n\nAll I can say is if you like Indian/Pakistani Food... EAT HERE. \n\nFor the full deal with Raptor photos go to  http://raptorsdelight.blogspot.com/2008/05/aslams-rasoi.html\n\nThanks!", "author": "Rose C R."}

Udupi Palace, Dosa, and Aslam. It might be hard to find a seat in the other places but never in Aslam! I know the reason why, this place is overpriced for the quality of food.\n\nThe food was decent, it wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular either. The servings were a good size. If you want to take your date or eat somewhere nice and quiet, you should probably come here. \n\n1) The naan servings are too small. \nThey give you a small Naan that basically makes you require ordering two Naan per person just to eat your meal with a proper side. They provide rice for free so you have to order that or another plate of Naan if you want to eat your meal properly.\n\n2) I can always judge a place's is overpriced by how much they charge for Mango Lassi. The cheap places go from $2-$3, the higher end places go from $3-4. Aslam had it for $5. You can buy an actual tin of Mango Pulp + A container of yogurt for that much.\n\nNot a fan, don't feel like going back when there's more quality places in the area. I think I'll just eat something else other than indian if Udupi and Dosa are full.\n\n*PS.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-21", "description": "This 2 star rating is given based off a poll taken amongst my party of 4 people. 3 of use agreed the restaurant deserved 2 stars, while the other was nice and thought they at least deserved 3. Why is this the case?\n\nIt first begins with our wait. We were told that we would wait for fifteen to twenty minutes for a table for four. The host then asked us to wait outside in the cold. While a fifteen minute wait in the cold is understandable, the wait became unbearable when it turned into a forty-five minute wait. This greatly disappointed us.\n\nAfter being seated we then waited another ten minutes before receiving water. The restaurant attempted to placate us with a free appetizer, only to overlook the fact that a member of our party was vegetarian by serving a chicken dish. \n\nWhen our food arrived they preceded to bring the wrong portion sizes. At the same time, the amount of food we received given the price was highly lopsided. For example, one serving of naan cost $2 and only included one piece of naan. This stands contrasted to any other Indian restaurant where you receive many pieces of naan for the same price. At the same time the food was mediocre at best. The chicken tandoori lacked substantial amounts of meat, the vegetarian dish and yogurt were prepared incorrectly, and the curry lacked flavor.\n\nWhat is the kicker in this night? For parties of four or more they automatically charge an 18% gratuity, which they definitely did not earn.\n\nAll in all our experience at this restaurant was substantially below average, which warrants 2 stars.", "author": "Richard G."}

My family and I ordered the Bombay Pakora, Chicken Tikka, (Tandoori dish not the masala dish), Lamb Biryani, Chicken Madras, and  lastly Kulfi (ice cream). The lamb biryani was very moist, blending in all the spices that makes a excellent biryani. The Chicken Tikka was flavorful and juicy. However the dish that stood out the most was the Kulfi. Normally when I order Kulfi at other Indian restaurants , they are missing a certain ingredient. This place probably had the best Kulfi I had tasted in a while. It was very light and  refreshing making it the final dish to wash away the spices. The service was on par. Our server (who is one of the owners) was very courteous and even recommended us a special when we stuck ordering. The only disappointment I had was the Bombay Pakora. It simply wasn't flavorful. However tasty food and expect me to pop by sometime soon.", "author": "Krishan S."}

Both friends I dined with here were shocked that I had never had Indian food.  I guess I was kind of shocked too.  But for my first experience with this tasty and robust food, I was glad that I had it at Aslam's. \n\nA little fearful of the spice-level and subsequent digestive calamities it may produce, I settled for the Chicken Tikka Masala -- chicken sauteed with herbs, spices, tomatoes and cream. My friends had the Chicken Madras -- chicken curry cooked in a spicy coconut sauce with golden raisins -- and Seekh Kebab -- ground lamb mixed with a bunch of herbs and spices. Thankfully, the waiter asked us that important questions... \"how spicy do you want it?\" We all responded... \"mild!\"  Yes, we all are a little spice-phobes, but too much spice can ruin a meal for me. My entree was fantastic. Very rich, and filling -- I was only able to eat about half of it. My friends also enjoyed their entrees -- although one friend thought the food wasn't as good as it had been on previous visits. \n\nWe also order some Pulao -- a Basmati rice cooked with saffron, cumin, cardamon and cinnamon. It was very flavorful, yet light. We also order some regular Naan bread and a goat cheese Naan that were great compliments to all of our dinners. And, a great way to sop-up the delicious sauces.\n\nI really like the atmosphere of Aslam's too -- it wasn't too Bollywood-ish. It was really colorful and cozy. We had a table in the corner by the window, a bit set-off from the rest of the diners. And the bench/couch I sat on was very comfy with plush pillows that I could sink my tired back into. \n\nOverall, I'd have to say my first adventure with Indian food was fantastic.

The Pinot Noir ended up being our least favorite after the tasting and we went with the tempranillo. He was very knowledgeable about the wines on his list and was more than happy to help us decided which one to choose. \n\nI ordered our food and we sipped our wine while we waited. One of the waiters came by with a complimentary side of Papadum to munch on while we waited for our dinner. That was awesome. \n\nFood was amazing as usual. As I said, i come here often and definitely think their indian is among the best in the bay area. This time we had the seafood curry and the lamb korma. I was not disappointed. My girl loved it.

I am adding an extra star because every single dish I've had here has been delicious, and the service is consistently so nice and friendly. It's a sad commentary on this city that this is so unique here.\n\nTonight, we were asking about ingredients in our favorite cucumber salad. The waiter (who also works in the kitchen sometimes, and is the owner's son) gladly told us. One of the ingredients is roasted cumin. Since neither my husband nor I cook with cumin, we continued our inquiry... roasted cumin? How does one do that?\n\nHe went into the kitchen came out with a little plate of cumin seeds, and the ground roasted cumin which they *roast and grind on the premises.* He also showed us their oregano and fenugreek - also ground fresh. All their spices are.\n\nHe then said that due to the economy, they were going to cut some of the prices, and introduce a \"prix fixe\" type of combo next week. OK? So now you have no excuse.\n\nAnd mind you, we're not super regulars, or anybody's best friend there. We go in every now and then. But you know, this is what dining out should be like. Special. Fresh, selective ingredients. Friendly service. An interior that is clean, inviting, and interesting, not just some sleek mod design that most upscale restaurants seem to be fascinated with since the late eighties.  Rasoi's is a true dining experience.\n\nAnd by the way: before you go, take off those skinny jeans and put on some normal pants. You look silly, and you'll be glad by the time you leave that you have some extra room to fill your tummy.", "author": "Dusty R."}

They were so hospitable that our experience from the start was more than we could ask for. The venue was large and allowed a lot of room for us to feel comfortable. \n\nTheir dishes can be described as: Indian Food Orgasm in my Mouth! OMG, I  finished every last drop of the sauces their dishes came in with the garlic Naan. SOOO yummy, I wanted to have more the very next day, but as Valentine's this year fell on a Saturday, Aslam's was actually closed the next day, a Sunday. Instead, I decided to try Dosa, a place I had initially tried to book reservations for on Valentine's Day but was told by staff that they were all booked. I was disappointed with what Dosa had to offer and their ridiculously expensive prices. Dosa might look more modern, but modernity means nothing when the food is mediocre and doesn't punch you in the face. \n\nAslam is the bomb. Try it.

Best non-traditional Christmas dinner ever (threw in the non-traditional for you mom, don't worry)! \n\nI started with a there thinly sliced eggplant pakora appetizer ($4). It had a very crunchy outside with tender eggplant in the middle. Very tasty! The Chicken Korma ($14) was one of the best I've ever had just enough spice and flavor without being extremely hot. It's very creamy and uses quality chicken, add a generous serving of rice and it's plenty of food for two people. The Garlic Basil Naan is also very good; the basil adds an extra kick. All this with a nice glass of Riesling ($8) and it was a wonderful holiday meal for me. \n\nThe servers were a little slow but very nice, attentive and more than happy to provide recommendations. I did not have room for dessert but they brought a little taste of the Rose lassi for me with my check which I thought was a nice touch.

We walked in on a Monday night, after deciding that Dosa was too much of a scene, looking for a low-key meal, not too expensive, with very little hassle.  There were only a few people in there, so our expectations weren't that high, but it was Monday night and late (around 9:45).

They offer more pakoras than I have ever seen, so if you love pakoras, this is the place for you.  Little fried things, get in my belly!\n\nThen we had the Chicken Madras, which is similar to Korma, cooked in  coconut sauce with raisins, and it was also delicious.  The Aslam's Lamb Chops, cooked in the Tandoori oven, were succulent - I asked for them rare, and our sweet waiter kept offering to cook them more for me, but they were perfect.  \n\nThe naan was tender/crisp and had a nice portion of clarified butter on top (yum), and my lemonade had an interesting spice to it that I loved.\n\nThe prices are higher than in some Indian restaurants (around $11-13 for a currry, $14-18 for tandoori), but the food is more sophisticated, so I thought that they were warranted.  The executive chef used to be at Roti and Indian Oven, and it definitely feels like a mash-up of those 2 restaurant's styles - less trendy than Roti, but more inventive than Indian Oven.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try some other dishes, including the Saag Paneer, which is one of my favorites.

The most experience I've had by far is here in SF. Rasoi is exemplary. It should set the bar for all Indian food, period. \n\nMost Indian places very obviously use frozen items, like peas, in their dishes. Most Indian food in this city is so incredibly greasy that I feel gross after eating it and have digestion problems that linger. But here, the food tastes clean, fresh, and innovative.\n\nInnovative: How many Indian places do you know have specials?? That's right, they announce specials, and on my last visit my party of 6 unanimously loved the \"Indian french fry\" special that is fresh potatoes sliced and chickpea battered, with a delicious dipping sauce. I don't even LIKE rice pudding, but a friend on a recent visit ordered rice pudding and I couldn't keep my paws off it. Perfection of creaminess and complexity of texture, sweet, and savory. And Rasoi has vegetarian entrees I've never seen on other Indian menus around town, 2 paneer dishes I can think of right now.\n\nClean: I do not have digestive issues after dining here.\n\nFresh: The flavors are very obviously fresh spices and vegetables.\n\nI've eaten here 6 times now, and I just can't fathom going anywhere else. I will note, and this is important for some readers, that Rasoi is more expensive than the other places, by about $2 to $4 per entree. This can add up. I think it is worth the extra price for the incredible quality, but budget diners shouldn't come here.\n\nAh. I should mention Dosa. I want so badly to love Dosa, but I think it's a poor excuse for South Indian that can get away with it because it has no real competition in town (the other places are North Indian). It's a nice atmosphere, and the owners are lovely, but the food is just so....off.", "author": "Stephanie P."}

Anyways, it tasted good to me.  The Chicken Tikka Masala (which I understand is a \"wuss\" on the 1-10 scale) had me wiping up every last drop of the sauce.  The garlic naan was  perfectly crispy and chewy at the same time, great for dipping.\n\nAs for price, It was about $25/person for ordering an entree each, 4 portions of rice, 2 naan, and drinks.

It looks classy enough when you get in, but the staff is really disorganized and the tables are really bizarrely placed; some of the 2-tops had an L-configuration for the seating instead of the two chairs facing each other. There were no hostesses (at least when we went) nor any sign-in sheet to tell who came first, so of the 10-12 of us waiting, no one really knew who was next. One of the waiters told us that we can all just sort it out ourselves....\n\nwe were sat in a 2 top that was booth-seat on one side and the chair was put in an L-configuration on the left, (so we werent facing each other). we were right next to the kitchen which has a window so you can peak into the kitchen-- which I suppose they think is a novelty. but the lights from the kitchen were really bright and harsh and came down on my eyes (I was sitting in the chair) so we ended up both sitting side-by-side on the booth side of the table, with our backs towards the kitchen window.\n\nfrom there the service wasnt terrible. it took a while for water to come, but thats it. \n\nAgain, the food was great.

Parking can be a bit of a pain, but there's a pretty cheap lot nearby, and it's just a few blocks from the 24/ Mission BART and MUNI station. I've had two birthdays here, and both times they were very accommodating to my large group, even adding more chairs as unexpected guests showed up. Another time, I brought my dad and his out-of-state girlfriend, and even though we arrived half an hour before they opened for dinner, they rushed out as we were about to go wait somewhere else, brought us in from the cold, and took our orders, bringing us our food impressively fast for somewhere that wasn't even supposed to be open! The servers are so nice and friendly here that I always wonder if they remember me from last time, even though I don't come here often enough for that to be the case. \n\nDespite being so great with large groups, it's intimate and sweet for a date or catching up with a friend. And the food! I've never had a clunker here, and I've tried paneer, chicken, lamb, fish, different kinds of naan, rice, etc... The mango lassi is the best I've ever had, and my favorite food items are the goat cheese naan, the garlic naan, the fish pakoras, and the lamb rogan josh, which is always tender and never gamey. Even my dad, who normally isn't a big fan of Indian food, loved this; it's not your typical greasy Indian buffet fare.  What's more, half the time I've been here, they've brought some little dessert treat with the check, which always makes me feel welcome. It's been great for my vegetarian friends as well, for what it's worth (although most Indian places are!).  It's a little pricier than some other good Indian places in the area, but I think that the food here is noticeably better, the atmosphere is really cute, and the service is top notch; you get what you pay for!

I live around the corner, it's my \"local\" (if you don't count the divine, but very different, Dosa, up the street).\n\nBut after I ate here, my dining companion actually said \"someone should burn that place down just to keep innocent people from having to eat that excuse for food.\"  Seriously the worst Indian meal either of us had ever had.  It all tasted like someone in the kitchen was playing a joke, heating freezer-burned vegetables and slopping them in with canned sauces and charging $12 for the \"dish.\"  That is the only excuse for the quality of the meal we had--it must be reheated packaged stuff.  Because if someone is making that stuff from scratch, they need to be ashamed.  And if they're not, they need to lower their dang prices to reflect the freezer-burn of their meat/veg.  The chicken was tough and stringy, the samosas tasted like cardboard, the CTM was oily and bland, and the service was laughably slow and unorganized.\n\nThe saddest part is that we paid $80 for dinner for two and this was not exactly a feast - just rice, naan, chicken korma, chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, samosas, a glass of  house wine each and chutney (which they charge for!).  For $80 two can eat at Range up the street and have one of the best meals in the Mission.  Or across the street at the usually awesome Spork.  So it is insult to injury that not only is the food at this place pretty awful, but the prices are high.\n\nI can never figure out why this place is usually so busy, nor how it has so many glowing reviews here.  Perhaps our meal was an abberation--I can only hope so--perhaps my standards are too high (I highly doubt that...I mean, I love me some Naan-n-Curry)--but I won't ever be back to Rasoi.\n\nIf you're in the mood for Indian, but want it actually to be tasty and fresh, try Chutney for the classics or Dosa for something new.", "author": "Marie S."}

Aslam, the chef/owner of this family owned and run restaurant, has been a chef at many well known restaurants including Indian Oven and Rottee.\n\nWe wnet early last night which gave us a chance to chat with the whole family. I've never met such genuine people in my life.\n\nNow the food...yummmmmmy!!! My wife and I love indian/pakistani food and have tried just about any restaurant in the bay area. This is one of the best! First off, the ingredients are high quality and fresh. We tried the Sikh Kabob which was THE BEST we've had anywhere. The ground lamb is not the low quality stuff you may find at some of the places in the tenderloin. High quality, fresh goround lamb, perfectly seasoned. We also tried the assorted appetizers, chicken vindaloo, a mixed vegetable dish that was made with cream, fresh frruit, and nuts, assorted naan basket, and basmati rices. EVERYTHING was very well done! For desert we had golab jamon and rice pudding, on the house, and both were freshly made and delicious.\n\nSee, I used to live in london and kind of spoiled when it comes to indian/pakistani food. This restaurant is the first restaurant in the bay area that comes very close to the indian food in england.\n\nI can say with confidence that we've found are favorite pakistani/indian restaurant and we will go back many many times.\n\nGood job Aslam...delicious food!", "author": "Reza E."}

We ordered plain naan, onion kulcha and the appetizer plate (which came with samosas, pakora, and papadum). Everything was well portioned for two people, not so much for three, meaning not quite family friendly servings. Plus just having to order plain naan is odd to me, but I'm not going to dock them for that. The onion kulcha was delicious with the raita and the naan.. well that was normal. We split the samosas and pakora but at least I can say I walked away knowing the pakora was good, can't really say the samosa impressed me.\n\nWe ordered the chana masala, lamb korma, and half tandoori chicken all at medium (we asked for pepper on the side). The food came out without the pepper on the side so my roommate who adores hot foods had to wait and the waitress had to be reminded to bring it out. I am generally not a fan of tandoori chicken but it was well prepared, tender, and overall good. Chana masala was decent with some good notes to it but I was sort of sad with the lamb korma. That plate came out with a few pieces of lamb which made us all wonder what would have happened if we did individual plates (someone would be starving). The korma itself was bland so I was grateful when the pepper arrived to give it that extra push.\n\nOn the bright side the waitress was accommodating when we requested wine and brought two tasters for us to decide upon. After the meal she brought us a shot of mango lassi which was delicious. So the service was great but the dishes were just not that impressive.", "author": "Shauna S."}

I rocked the Karahi Gosht this time but like the lamb dish I got better the first time around. OH, try to sit in the windows because people watching is AWESOME and there are plenty of people to watch and make faces at on Valencia.\n\nI went here on Saturday out of curiosity and came out pleasantly surprised. There was a bit of a wait since there was a large party in the restaurant and I was hungry as hell after walking to Palace Steak House only to find out it was closed for Thanksgiving. Bullshit! But back to the review ....\n\nThere was a slight wait, which irritated me, but it was well worth it after the food came out. Our waitress was a daughter of the chef and we just asked her to bring us her favorite dishes. We ended up with the lamb curry (first lamb dish on the menu) and the chicken shish kebab. Both of them were super tasty and crazy delicious with mad props thrown down on the chicken. We kicked things off with the samosa, pompadour and fritter(?) appetizer. My stomach was all like \"Oh snaps son! Tasty!\"\n\nI don't know why people are hating on Aslam's. Dosa always has a line and I feel like the food is over hyped. It's like my neighbor telling me Taco Bell is the shit. I could care less about \"being seen\" at a place which is what I feel Dosa is all about. Hell, I better be having a good meal when I am eating out since my personal chef only gets two days off a week. Really, I make him cook hard.\n\nIn the end, I felt Aslam's was well worth the price. It might be a bit more expensive than other Indian restaurants in the city but it definitely gained me as a customer. We also scored a free dessert as well since we were so awesome. Dosa where u at?\n\nBATHROOM REVIEW\n----------------------------------------\nAslam's had a nice, large bathroom that is unisex. There is plenty of space in the thing if you wanted to join the \"I had sex in the restaurant bathroom\" club. From what I hear, it is more prestigious than the Mile High Club. But eat at Aslam's knowing you can play Battleship in relative peace and cleanliness when the time calls.", "author": "Bathrooms Only .."}

Hands down my favorite in SF.\n\nThe highlights here are the naan and vegetarian curries. All of these are excellent: Bhindi Masala (okra), Saag Aloo (spinach with potatoes), Dal Saag (spinach and lentils), Navrattan Korma (mixed veggies, nuts, fruits) and Paneer Tikka Korma (think Chicken Tikka Masala but with cheese instead of chicken).\n\nMy favorite dish is probably the Kashmiri Biryani, although the fact that it includes raisins and other fruit makes it an acquired taste.\n\nOn the meat side of the menu, the Chicken Tikka Masala is just OK. The Seekh Kebab (ground lamb) however is excellent.\n\nWhen they ask for spiciness, \"medium\" is a good balance. \"Medium-hot\" is about my limit.\n\nI will say that service, drinks and atmosphere are not their strong points: you go here for the food, first and foremost.

But the last few times I've been, the food has been increasingly more greasy and the restaurants have been increasingly more busy than normal. (Is there a relationship? I do not know.)  I'm happy for them and glad they're getting more business, but since I've moved, it's more of a trek for me to get up there, and one that I'm less likely to make if it will be hit or miss once I get there.\n\nAslam's is a bit pricier, between $9 and $14 for a dish as opposed to between $5 and $8, but I find it to be worth it.  I've never had a bad dish, and I've been enough times and with enough people to try quite a few.  Favorites include their Chicken Korma, Keema Aloo Mattar, and Aloo Saag. (All their spinach dishes are really good, I think because they like mince the spinach especially a lot, or something.) \n\nLast time, I took my very-extroverted-waitress-from-Austin friend who was in town, and she got palsy enough with our waiter that he brought us a free bowl of kheer for dessert, which was a nice touch.\n\nIt's probably a good precaution to make a reservation, especially on the aforementioned yuppified weekend nights, although they've always been able to seat me even without reservations.", "author": "Megan D."}

Just wrote a negative review, so I want to balance out with a place that I love. And that would be Aslam Rasoi.\n\nEverybody has their benchmark dish. Mine, for Indian food, is Sag Paneer. Wherever I go to a new Indian place I order up Sag Paneer. For SF, Gaylord's Sag is delicate, Naan 'N Curry is intense, Pakwan is value priced. As for Aslam Rasoi, well they're in a class by itself. I haven't had Sag this good since London. \n\nBut, wait there's more. Aslam is the only Indian/Pakistani place I've ever been to that serves up Calamari Pakoras (what they call Bombay Pakoras -  perhaps, if I had spent more time in Mumbai). Now, Calamari is my ultimate benchmark dish. You see, my former love thang co-authored a Calamari cookbook and was co-owner of the now defunct India Joze (of Santa Cruz fame), which had a yearly Calamari Festival. In fact, their side street was renamed \"Squid Row\". So, I think I've learned a thing or two about the pleasures of fried cephalopods. The first is that almost every restaurant over cooks it - to the point of having the texture of shoe leather. Some chefs call it al dente; I call it inedible. Not Aslam Rasoi. Tender juicy morsels.

I've lived in this city for five years, and I've eaten at many, many Indian restaurants: Clay Oven, Bombay India in the Castro, Dosa, Masala in the sunset, Pakwan (which is not Indian, I know), Naan-N-Curry (both locations), and many more in London, Boston, and Chicago. \n\nI have been to Aslam's at least seven times, and I must say, their food is outstanding! Their chicken and lamb tikka are the most tender, flavorful, and succulent of their kind that I have tasted at any Indian restaurant, period. Their curries are spiced with more nuance and subtlety than you'll find in most Indian restaurants (try their daal, karahi gosht, and lamb madras). Their curries are balanced and complex, unique in that they don't drown out the natural flavor of the meat. \n\nIt perplexes me that people aren't raving about the food at this place. Since it's a fairly new restaurant, one has to expect that they'll be working out kinks in the service (and reviewers are right - service can be great or missing), and, yes, the place does want for ambiance.

Maybe the pre- and post-Aslam reviews should be placed in separate Yelp entries?\n\nTonight, we enjoyed the Rasoi rogan josh (lamb curry), chana masala (garbanzo beans), and bhindi masala (okra) with rice and garlic naan. Everything was tasty and well-prepared. We asked for the food to be medium spicy, and it was definitely hot enough to pleasantly heat up our mouths and keep us drinking water -- in a good way. The lamb was tender, its sauce deep and complex. The garbanzo beans were nicely cooked, not hard as they often are in other places. (Does everyone prepare theirs from scratch, or do some places use canned?) The okra was cut into short strips and fried, a very different kind of preparation than what I've had from Al Hamra.\n\nOn our previous visit, we had the saag paneer (spinach with cheese cubes), bengan bartha (eggplant), and tandoori prawns, all of which were great, but I can't describe that meal in as much detail, as it was several months ago.\n\nService on our first visit was a bit disorganized, and it was definitely better this time around. Everyone was friendly, although I noticed our server on both visits, a guy with longish hair pulled back in a ponytail and sideburns, kept trying to sell us appetizers and drinks.

I tend not to choose seafood when I order Indian and Pakistani food. Aslam's Rasoi has changed me. The tilapia curry was unbelievably yummy. Very creamy and flavorful. Probably my favorite of the night. But everything else we had was also delicious. The cold Chimay on tap was the perfect accompaniment to our spicy meal.

The servers know what they are doing and truly wonderful.  From the sauces to the meats, you can taste the quality of food you are being served.  Usually, Indian restaurants that serve quality food also tend towards smaller menus with many things unfamiliar to the standard Indian fare.  Personally, I don't seek food because it is unusual, I am very happy enjoying the food that I love and they certainly have a strong menu that features familiar flavors and more.\n\nThe space is also quite nice.

The host was incredibly friendly, offering to seat us at the table (sans rest of party) or to escort us to the bar for a pre-meal drink.\n\nThe dcor is lush and the atmosphere lively without being obnoxious.\n\nBetween our birthday party of 8, we ordered the samosas (be warned - there's only three per order!), chicken tikka masala, chana masala, a spinach-based dish, and another chicken dish.  Orders of rice and naan for all.  SO GOOD, EVERY BIT OF IT.  It was one of those experiences where you know you shouldn't eat a single bite more but you can't resist the short-term pleasure, even with the long-term belly ache waiting in the wings.\n\nThe menu was neatly categorized and as a lax-vegetarian I found it difficult to choose between all the dishes (clearly labeled \"vegetarian\").  Not sure how vegan-friendly the restaurant is as many of the vegetarian dishes included cheese as the main sustenance source.\n\nThe waiters and waitstaff were all very attentive and courteous and it really made a difference.  The waiter was sure to ask everyone if they wanted they're meals spicy, medium spicy or very spicy which I thought was considerate as I had clearly forgotten that Indian food spicy is of a different caliber.  Ow!  He was also quick to offer extra rice and naan when he saw the table was running low.  I think I counted my water being filled like nine times without being asked!\n\nWe brought bottles of wine with us to drink for a $12 corkage fee and cupcakes for the birthday boy, which the kitchen kindly provided a lighter and candle for.  \n\nSo needless to say, our party had a great experience.\n\nI guess FOR ONCE it pays to listen to the he-said she-said.", "author": "Amanda C."}

OMG the Rasoi's Lamb Chops are the most tender you ever tasted! Fresh veggies in the Vegetable Biryani, just made Naan, and the Mixed Seafood Curry braised in a rich tomato curry sauce was just soooo delicious and of course everything else we had was just as delightful.   \n\nThe staff is personable and friendly...when we asked if we could bring in our own birthday cake (coconut passion fruit cake from Tartine Bakery)  they said \"yes\" with pleasure...they even let me go into the kitchen area to help set up the candles right before bringing it out...then they surprised us with a very special treat to compliment the dessert...so thankful for the generous hospitality they showed us.\n\nIf you haven't experienced Aslam's Rasoi you are missing out on the BEST!!

Food is kick-ass...really tasty...not your average bland or over spiced muck you can get at the cheaper Indian restaurants. The dishes here have the complex flavors you'd expect from quality ingredients.\n\nTip: Start your dinner with an order of Pampadam, Achar (freaky salty Indian pickled stuff) & Mango Chutney. With your appetite all ready, ease into a couple main dishes (the curries are great, so is the sagg panneer, haven't tried the tandoori yet), add some rice, naan and a couple Kingfischer's & you are all set my friend.\n\nI met the owner when the restaurant first opened (under new ownership), he's a great guy & gave me a tour of the kitchen, which looked great. They use the authentic tandoori ovens (with charcoal vs. electric heat). His daughter, son & other relatives all work at the restaurant, and are really nice. Sometimes the restuarnt can feel a little cavernous when there aren't many customers, if it bothers you then sit in the window seats or at the bar to make it feel more cozy.", "author": "Casey R."}

The service here is outstanding, especially if you compare it to other Indian/Pakistani restaurant. These folks were speedy and attentive. Attentive is a rare attribute compared to most Indian restaurants that I been. Portion size was substantial without being excessive. \n\nThe reason for the 4-star review was the murgh makhani (indian butter chicken in tomato base sauce).  It was beyond super-excellent for my Asian American palate. We nearly licked the plate clean but opted to be civilized by using the garlic naans to wipe things clean.\n\nTheir medium hot vegetable biryani was decent with a good amount of spice but I had the feeling the vegetables were from a green giant freezer bag. I'm relatively new to biryani so I'm not an expert. Aslam's is good but I prefer the biryani at Naan 'n' Curry on O'Farrell where it has more robust flavor and the spice is slightly more intense.\n\nThe only disappointment: samosas. Although they had fine flavor they were stingy on the filling. Also I prefer more green peas in the filling. \n\nThe meal above (garlic naan, samosa, biryani, murgh makhani) cost ~$40 including tax & tip for 2 people to feel thoroughly overfed (but no leftovers).", "author": "Jeff L."}

I ordered my favorite (vindaloo), which I always request at a ridiculously high spice level -- where 10 is mild. At most establishments, the reception I receive to said request is dubious: \"You know vindaloo is already spicy, right?\" says the server, as s/he shoots me a \"Girrrrlll, please\" look and likely scrawls \"Mild!\" on the notepad. (I must have no tastebuds, because what may cause even some of my Indian friends to sweat bullets always tastes just right to me!) The server at Aslam's didn't bat an eyelash, though, and my vindaloo was delicious. It was sufficiently spicy, even for me, and richly flavored, but not oily or heavy. The aloo gobi was some of the best I have had, and the naan was fluffy and filling (but not oily). Our server was attentive and friendly, too. I will definitely be back!", "author": "Katie M."}

I spotted Chef Aslam through the window and he shot me back a hearty grin -- and every time I looked back in he seemed to spot me and shoot back the same grin.  It started feeling awkward.\n\nIn any case, I have to give Aslam's HUGE credit for preparing its curries (or at least the Bhindi Masala I had) without boring indian restaurant goop.  I asked for it hot and it came out spicy enough but the kind of spicy that is too much like white noise -- heat without the flavor of the chilis.  Save for that complaint this is probably the best bhindi masala I've had at a restaurant in recent memory.\n\nI was not totally jazzed by the fact that Aslam's, like a lot of other indian restaurants these days, it seems, requires that you pay for papad.  I ended up opting for the assorted appetizers - samosa, pakora, papad, and the items themselves were solid.  I have to call Aslam's out on the chutneys though -- they might as well have been aiolis, with none of the bite you except from a solid chutney.\n\nI also got the raita which I found to be better than the average restaurant raita.  Too often I get restaurant raita that is exactly (or inferior to) what I do at home -- prepare the yogurt, add shredded cucumber, add powdered and toasted spices, whip -- but Aslam's had something going on that I could not quite figure out, and couldn't help but devour.   \n\nOverall a solid north indian restaurant, although (in my mind) north indian restaurants are generally terrible.", "author": "Srikanth S."}

It was soft and coated with garlic and butter and complimented the murgh makhani very well.  The aloo paratha was dissapointing.

Reservations actually mean something at this beautifully appointed place.  We were seated right away and were welcomed to take our time with ordering.  I really appreciate that.  \nThey admitted they were understaffed which I also took as a plus because we knew what was going on and could roll with it.  Most awesome of all, when we ordered a bottle of wine that they had run out of, they offered another which was way more expensive at the price of our original request.  That's great customer service!  Who cares if I don't have my water glass filled every 5 minutes.. \nAh the food ... \nSamosas - yummy but not super flavorful.  \nPakoras - also yummy and despite the fact that it's hard to hate fried anything, I was able to taste the onion and chickpea.  \nThe magic green yogurt chile sauce is just that:  magic.  \n\nI ordered the Lamb Vindaloo and it knocked my socks off.  Super tender lamb and the sauce was not just spicy for hot sake, it was complex and divine.  The server (who reminded me of a hummingbird) gave us options of how spicy we wanted) \n\nAlso on the table were Chicken Tikka Masala, Prawn Madras, Chicken Saagwala & Bengan Bartha.  No one complained.  It was all super tasty.  I tried a little of the Bengan Bartha and verified that it was really good.  The rice for me was just a sauce carrier so no big kudos for rice.  Same story for the naan, both garlic and plain.. Sadly, there was no room for dessert but even if there was, I would have elected to find the cremebrulee guy instead.  \n\nPortions are great, price is reasonable, service was genuine ...

My husband and I both think that Rasoi is THE BEST Indian food we have ever had.  Here's why... \n\nThe tandori chicken is nothing  like we've ever before.   It's actual pieces of chicken rather than the typical kabob pieces that are usually dry.  The chicken is so moist, seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection.  We've been to Rasoi multiple times, and each time the chicken has been perfect.  Which is unusual because sometimes restaurants don't have the same consistency with chicken.  I also ordered the Bengan Bartha (eggplant) without shreds of ginger because I'm not a big ginger fan. Delicious!  Another item we ordered was the Chicken Korma, which has a sauce that reminds me of the shrimp dish at ChaChaCha.  It's creamy and great for naan dippin.  Oh!  I almost forgot the samosa and  the AMAZING green sauce that is on the side.  I can dip everything in that green sauce!

He noticed our wobbly table, said he'd be back to fix it and never returned. My wife eventually got napkins that partially did the trick and someone came by even later and finally fixed it. The drinks took almost another 10 and by this point we realized that we needed to grab the waiter when he returned so that we could place our order or risk a night of hunger. This much was obvious at this point: it was a Friday night and the place was understaffed with what we believed was only two waiters who were rushing to lessen the slow-motion disaster around them. The food was fine, nothing special in the realm of Indian food -- I've had much better elsewhere. During dinner we watched as an entire table of diners was drenched in lassi. And when the bill came, surprise: 20% gratuity was already included. How sweet of them! Well, my restaurant experience tells me one thing: the only time a waiter does this is when he thinks he may be stiffed. And our party of six wasn't going to stiff him, but we certainly weren't going to give him 20% for a job not well done. After another 5 minutes of trying to get the waiter's attention, one of our party eventually went to the bar to pay the bill where he complained about the poor service and being charged a premium for it. The manager came to the table to apologize for the poor service, but insisted -- incongruous to the apology -- that it was worth the 20% gratuity. Again, it wasn't the money issue that bothered us, but the idea that we were paying a premium -- a reward -- for poor service. The experience left a bad taste in our mouths.", "author": "Douglas H."}

The atmosphere is both charming and romantic. With dim lighting tasteful artwork and dark wood stained furniture Aslam's creates a wonderful cozy eating environment. The food is nothing short of incredible. My wife and I shared  An assorted appetizer, Vegetable Biryani, Lamb Vidaloo (absolutely divinely seasoned and cooked perfectly), And finally Dum Aloo Vindaloo (Spiced potatoes cooked in a hot tomato curry sauce with cumin). My wife has a sometimes delicate stomach and had no problem with any of there curry's which we ordered to be on the spicy side of medium.  The service was good our waiter had a particularly good memory and was the perfect balance of attentive and un-intrusive.

The Keema Aloo Mattar (lamb with peas and potatoes) was very tender and had a fruity and layered spice complexity. The appetizers were somehow forgettable, together with the two chicken dishes that my friends had. My best guess is that not all the dishes in the menu (pretty wide by the way) are going to be spot on. They also have a nice selection of wines.

And it is my absolute favorite for Indian food. In fact, we have trouble trying any other places in the Mission, because once we get down here we can't resist coming to Aslam's!\n\nMy husband and I started coming here when they first opened a couple of years ago. Back then, it was pretty much just Mohammed Aslam and a helper in the kitchen, his daughter was the hostess, and his two sons were the wait staff. They immediately welcomed us in and treated us like family. We even got a tour of the kitchen. \n\nAdmittedly, the family ambiance has diminished a bit as the place has gotten more popular and they have hired actual staff. However, every time we come in we are greeted with a smile and hugs by the family, who know us by name and truly seem to appreciate our business. And we can scarcely walk by the entrance to the kitchen, which is on the way to the bathrooms, without poking our heads in and saying Hi (and Thank You).\n\nThe food is as good as it gets. We have had just about everything on the menu at this point, from vegetarian to lamb to chicken to seafood, and we have never been disappointed. My favorite appetizers by far are the pakoras. A really great, off-menu dish is the prawns makhani. Unlike a lot of Indian places, everything tastes fresh, and the dishes all have distinct flavors. The meats are moist, not overcooked and never greasy. The saag paneer is the best I have had anywhere.\n\n The only drawback is the price, which is a little on the expensive side for Indian (when we want cheap we hit Shalimar), but I believe you get what you pay for here. Highly, highly recommended.", "author": "Lea R."}

Every time my family goes out to dinner to celebrate something, we go to Aslam's Rasoi. When my boyfriend and I introduced our parents, we took them to Aslam's Rasoi (it was his parents' first time eating Indian food, and now they want to take me out for Indian food again). This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the city--and, as it happens, in the world. The food is sublimely beyond compare, the staff is friendly and helpful (and patient), the decor is beautiful...what more could anyone ask for?\nOnce, when my whole family had eaten there a few times within a short period, they recognized us and gave the whole group free kheer for dessert. Needless to say, it was both delicious and a very generous thing for them to do.\nI don't think I've ever ordered the same thing twice (although every time I try something I vow to get it again sometime) and I've always been delighted with my food. As a vegetarian, I usually find my choices limited in both quantity and quality, but that is not at all the case here. And all the non-vegetarians I eat with like that they can, for once, enjoy both their food and mine!\nThey offer a variety of breads, but we always end up getting at least one order of the kabuli naan, because it is without a doubt the best kabuli naan I've ever found. Other than that, it's hard to make specific recommendations because everything I've tried is top-notch. My boyfriend always gets the chicken saag because he loves it (and he will get variety from eating my leftovers), my brother loves the mango lassi, and the fish is always cooked perfectly--the salmon melts in your mouth.

I have always been impressed by the rich flavors and quality of food. I remember being a bit tentative when it became Aslam's Rasoi and prices increased dramatically, but the food also improved with the prices. I tried a new dish last night, salmon in a creamy tomato sauce. It was peppery, spicy and the salmon was moist and tender. My friend had ordered a mild vegetable Korma and when it came out extra spicy the waitress gracefully offered to remake the dish. My friend loved the Korma and was constantly surprised by the variety of fruit mixed in with the vegetables.  The service at Rasoi's is pleasant, but hard to get at times.

Then we tried two new things, one was a special: tandoori sweet potatoes. Insane! Just goes to show you that ANYTHING can taste better coming from a tandoori oven with tandoori spices. I'm in love. Then we had vegetable jalfrezi. OMG. Comes in a wonderful white sauce with sliced almonds. Yum. The appetizer we had the vegetable pakora, which is fried in chickpea flour, which for a gluten-free person like me is heaven! Finally I can enjoy pakora again! And the service. Can't be beat for friendliness, prompt and courteous service, accommodations when needed, the works. Aslam is a nice, warm and friendly person, whom my husband and I met one day a few months ago while walking past his restaurant. After a short conversation we promised to come by soon. We could kick ourselves for waiting so long! Aslam's son, Asif, is so nice and really helpful and funny, too. He waits tables and appears to manage the rest of the waitstaff, all of whom are friendly and helpful, as well. If Yelp offered a 10-star rating that's what I'd give Aslam's Rasoi. Yaayy! Our quest for the best Indian restaurant in the world is finally over!!!", "author": "Sheila C."}

This family-owned and operated gem is never too busy - which only tells me that it hasn't been discovered yet.  Every time I go (and I go a lot), they hook me up with a little treat, and that just makes me feel ever-so-appreciated!  Not that they'd  have to do that to keep  me coming back.  The environment is fun - kinda Bollywood-ish, and the music is lively.  The lighting sets a good mood, and the food...oh, the food!  I followed the chef from Indian Oven to Roti, and now to his own nook on Valencia - and it just keeps getting better.  Indian Oven was a bit hectic and crowded - and now I don't even know if it is still open...Roti could just be oh-so-snotty sometimes, and the prices weren't that great...but Aslam's is AWESOME!

I thought the goat cheese naan was new and interesting, but the staples that everyone raves about didn't really do it for me at all. Specifically, the chicken tikka masala was very oily (and the kind where the oil separates from the rest of the sauce) and we had to keep stirring it. Moreover, it was a bit bland. The Saag aloo was pretty good-- the ingredients seemed fresh and the seasoning was okay. The other dishes we ordered were just okay (read: forgettable). Lastly, the price was pretty high for the kind of Indian I was seeking. All in all, I prefer Spicy Bite over Aslam's - cheaper, consistently tastier, and delivers!", "author": "C K."}

No floating oil or musty smelling dals here!  I've eaten a lot of Indian food from SF to Berkeley to Oakland.  This is by far the yummiest.  The service is like a 5 star hotel.  My buddie and i walked in looking for South Indian food.  A smiling man and woman met us in the entrance and regretfully informed us that they did not serve southern food, but that there were two right down the road that did.  They were kind and seemed not at all slighted that we would not stay.  They were so charming that when we got outside, my friend and i decided we wanted to stay and try this restaurant first!  Our waitress was like a modern Marry Poppins.  She wisked in, when we were undecided about  wine types, she dashed off and reappeared with 3 wine samples each! Amazing.... and the wine was delicious!  As for food, she ask  us (most places don't)  if we wanted mild, medium or hot.  When the delicious spinach lamb was still a bit hot for me, she said something like, \"I have something just for that.... it will cool it down\" and reappeared with raita (not even just plain yogurt) and said \"this is courtesy of the house\".  Our waitress was top notch.  Alsam's R - you have a treasure in the house!  We also ordered the vegetable korma.  The sauce was the best korma sauce i have had in about 10 years.  The only suggestion i have for this fabulous restaurant is to skip the common vegetables and make the Korma with just paneer, raisins, and almond slices.  A restaurant in Massachusetts used this killer combo.  The atmosphere is delightful as well.  I plan to return with my whole family... 3 generations worth.", "author": "Tara W."}

I always thought Indian restaurants had a policy of serving what appears to be little but ends up being almost too much food, but Aslam's proved me wrong.  Far from awe-inspiring, I left feeling disappointed.  For an order of vegetable samosas, chicken tikka masala, vegetable korma, and two chai teas, the bill came to $40, about $20 more than it was worth.  Both dishes were far too creamy and although we compromised on medium spicy, all the chile flakes were dumped into the chicken tikka masala.  (Not a problem for me, but when you're hoping for the entire meal to be medium spicey, it's nice to spread things out a bit.)  The chicken tikka had more sauce than what appeared to be not even half a chicken breast in it.  The service was attentive and polite.

Anyway, aside from the food everyone there is so nice it really feels like you're stepping into their living room. And btw, Aslam's was there before Dosa and Udupi. I like them both (since I spent 4 months in South India I'm very happy that South Indian food is finally entering our town), but it's just not as relaxed as Aslam's. Also, in South India Dosas are more of a street food, kind of like tacos from a taco truck, so I'm still having a hard time with the \"designer dosa.\" Either way, I'm very glad little India has come to my corner of the Mission.
