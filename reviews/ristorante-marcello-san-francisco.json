The place filled up yet we never felt rushed or that the service was lacking.  We ordered the dinner, salad/ minestrone soup.  The salad was cold, crisp and fresh.  The soup was traditional and very good. The pasta also was fresh, perfectly cooked and arrived hot.  We had to wait a bit for my entree as it took longer, however our waiter let us know that it would take a little longer,  I appreciated that he checked in and let us know. \nI ordered the Pollo Ai Fierri.  Both dishes arrived at the same time, hot and frankly it was the best roasted chicken I have had in a restaurant. It was moist, perfectly cooked and hot.  (I have a thing about my food arriving hot in a restaurant - so many times it arrives lukewarm) My mom had the Chicken Dore (similar to Chicken Milanese)  - she absolutely loved it;  she can be hard to please.  All in All a great experience. We bought the gift certificate. This is now one of my very favorite Italian restaurant's.", "author": "Janet C."}

Then once seated it took 20 minutes plus the involvement of the owner to get water and bread.  Then it took another 60 minutes to get the main course out.  At no time did they offer to bring the mains for the kids out early even though some adults got the salad menu option. We ended up there over 2.5 hours and other that that first time they set the water down it was not until 2.25 hours into our meal that we got the water refilled.  Wait staff stopped by exactly 3 times in that timeframe.  All in all TERRIBLE service. Food was okay but not special. All the servings were different sizes of food -- 2 dishes of gnocchi for example were 25% different in quantity.  You go here if you have fond memories of some dish long ago I guess.  Or you want an instagram photo in front for the 1950s era bar kitsch.  But for a nice meal with a family I think you search a new place.", "author": "Brad R."}

One of these old-timely Italian places been around forever.

I'm not dieting nor vegan. It's simply the best anywhere. And I mean anywhere. Thick slices not breaded, ethereally light and coated with both a tomato sauce and a gentle addition of b\u00e9chamel. You cannot see this white luscious sauce but it's there adding unctuous goodness to this sublime vegetable. There are always a nice portion of sliced potato Anna and a vibrant green vegetable that accompany it all. \nDoesn't matter what you get. It's all so very del ious. Really. I'm not sure I've ever had a bad meal there. Or even an uh meal. I've enjoyed birthdays, engagements, during the week meals there-you name it-and have always been delighted. \n\nSo we get the meal here. That means a little plate of rigatoni w meat sauce to start then this salad with an Italian vegetable dressing. I've told my family to tel them I'm dying and my last request was for this salad dressing recipe. When gourmet magazine had a section called \"you asked for it\" I was hoping I'd get it then. Yes it's that good!! I've already been back in the kitchen to learn how to make the eggplant. (And still cannot replicate it!)\n\nIt's way over on that side of town. Nothing chic nearby. Doesn't matter. Or shouldn't. Before Marcelo the owner runs away porcini hunting again please go. Indulge in this delicious reasonably priced Italian food.  \n\nI feel lucky to have this as part of my history. So many memories have been made there. All good. All.", "author": "Peddie A."}

We were greeted by an older women as I had a 5pm reservation which really didn't seem to matter and the restaurant was empty with 3 people sitting at the bar. Our waitress was nice and you could sense she has worked there for quiet sometime, but lacked an order of how to waitress. We received menu's and as she overheard me asking my party about wanting escargot's she jumped in asking if she should put in an order to be fired up. I held her off until everyone had made a decision of what they wanted to start off there meal with. She returned and an order was placed for escargot's and carpaccio. She then returned to take our dinner order. Never once asking can I start you off with something to drink. Overlooking things being done kind of backwards the food arrived. The escargot's and carpaccio were excellent and thought we were off to a good start! Then salads arrived and just fell flat with excessive dressing (too much vinegar) on the house salads and a bed of lettuce with all the toppings looking like they had been flattened with a rolling pin made the salads look quiet unappealing. I had the Caesar's salad which should have been crisp and cold and the yellow portion of the romaine lettuce and it was just the opposite warm lettuce and all green which was bitter and just fell short of what should have been a great salad. The Pasta of the day arrived for my mother and husband who had ordered the complete dinners were handed a tasteless penne pasta in a bolognese sauce with a running water sauce. I had the cannelloni which I was told was stuffed with spinach, ricotta and veal and I searched every bite for spinach and ricotta and to great disapppointment never found and I then unrolled the cannelloni and really questioned if it was even veal. My son had the Gnocchi in cream sauce which lacked any taste and felt like the Gnocchi came out of a box. My father had the pepper steak which had a lack luster tasteless pepper sauce and a cut of steak for the price was overpriced! His potatoes were cold as was everyone's potatoes that accompanied their dinner's. My husband had the special which was veal with porcini mushroom's and not wanting to rock the boat at the time, but we got home said it was just terrible and tasteless and the plate really fell short with cold potatoes and green beans. We then ordered desserts to be again disappointed that they could only fill 3 out of the 4 orders of creme caramel because they had run out. Not really disappointed after tasting and sharing with my son as the creme caramel tasted old and flat in appearance and size. Who runs out of dessert going into a start of weekend with celebrations for Father's Day?? The Tiramisu however was excellent!! Fresh as if had just been made. It was unanimous among all of us that this would not be a return restaurant on our list as it lacked presentation of dishes, taste and exceptional service for the prices they charge. Oh and by the way, when I told the waitress about the cannelloni which I specifically had asked her about before ordering responded \"Oh, they must have changed it\"! Too bad the price didn't change since it did not have the contents as you described. Not returning and extremely disappointed.....", "author": "Michelle W."}

This joint is dripping with atmosphere including the old bus boy with his uniform or the owner who sits at a cute little desk with a mushroom lamp. Its been in business  45 years and you can tell since nothing has changed since the day it opened - in a good way. Nothing trendy or foodie here. You ain't gonna get organic or local. The wine list is a hoot but people bring their own wine. Reminds me of the restaurants I ate in as a kid in the 1970s and the menu is straight from that era.

It's a neighborhood restaurant and bar with the same folks sitting at the bar who were there in 1968.  Not a man bun in sight.  It's a breath of fresh air.\n\nIt's an old-time red-sauce Italian place, and the food is delicious and plentiful.  The best thing on the menu, though, is the minestrone.  Dear Lord, is it good.

I decided to go with my gut and try the fettuccine Alfredo, and was thrilled to smell the presence of nutmeg in the dish. Flavors were classic Alfredo and the pasta had a wonderful al dente bite.  I wish there was a blackened chicken option but that might be more modern take.  The other dishes were pretty tasty as well, and I was a fan of my nephew's gnocchi and pesto.\n\nService was really friendly and made you feel like part of the family.

She said it was the best she'd ever had. \n\nI couldn't leave without having dessert. I got my usual, cheesecake. I wouldn't say it was the best dense cheesecake I've ever had, but it was really good and I was satisfied. On the other hand, my friend ordered their gelato(half chocolate/half hazelnut). I was disappointed with it due to all the good reviews for it on yelp. The hazelnut part was delicious, however the chocolate had some frostbite on it as it did taste a little old.\n\nRistorante Marcello is in the 2 dollar sign range but on the higher end of it. \n\nRegardless, I really enjoyed this place and definitely will come back!", "author": "Priyam D."}

The place is spacious, with a very friendly gentleman as your server to pamper you with delicious food. Not to mention their generous servings. All this for a reasonable price.\n\nI was craving Vongole in particular, and the only place I could find on Yelp in proximity was Marcello.

Very comfortable atmosphere, and along with the great service, this place really makes you feel happy that you are there.\n\nTheir house special salad is refreshing and light, and their soup of the day was very warming. Nothing was overly-seasoned/oily/dry, everything was just right. According to the gentleman who was our server, they make their pasta slightly thinner than elsewhere, because it gives a better flavor. I found this out when I asked him about the angelhair-thin Vongole that came out. It did taste good, and the portions were ginormous. LOTS of clams, already taken out of their shells - I really appreciated this since this shows that Marcello wasn't skimping out on the clams (many places tend to place just under a dozen clams, in their shells, in order to make it look like there is a lot). \n\nBy the time I finished my beloved Vongole, I was too full for dessert. But there's always next time, because I plan on making this my go-to Ristorante in the Bay Area. \n\n\n**Tip: Also seems great for families.

I felt like I was in a Scarface movie..... all in all.. maybe I will update this soon with a better review.... but as for now it sucked., and my hype was so overrated. \n\nI totally wanted to love it but i couldn't..sorry maybe next time....

I have been to your place twice this month and I have purposely did not Yelp about you.\nWhat have you done to me? I was not like this before I met you. \n\nI must let you go now - I must let others enjoy you. As an Elite Yelper, I have a civic, Yelp duty to share great reviews. As so, I have to Yelp you, and reveal you to the world. \n\nOh Marcello. I will be back. Things will not be the same between us anymore. More people will come to you, love you, Yelp you and they too, will spread how good you are to everyone.  You deserve this. I cannot bear to be so selfish anymore.\n\nxoxo, Vanessa\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNorth Beach serves the absolute best Italian food? Hm. No.\n\nRistorante Marcello is a fantastic, Italian restaurant tucked away in \"the Set\" [Sunset District]. This place has no windows. It's as if this is an Italian food lovers secret society -- and this is the meeting place.\n\nWhen you first walk in [hopefully you've made reservations], you open a big wooden door. You walk in and there is a bar with local patrons all around - talking, laughing and drinking. On your left you see an upper level of many tables full of deliciousness, glasses filled with wine, happy, dressed up women with ruby red lipstick and big, grandpa-like men enjoying themselves. This is the place to be.\n\nThe dining area is intimate, and the waiters and busboys maneuver their way around to provide the best, top-notch service.  This restaurant has white walls, adorned with paintings. There is a fireplace near the entrance to a kitchen and you feel like you might be in grandma's cozy living room. It is warm and inviting -- very Italian. The servers are Italian and give great service - always checking up on you [but not disturbing you] & they give great recommendations on wine and what to order. \n\nThe food. Every night, Marcello's has specials. Valentine's Day night specials included: veal, rabbit and salmon. \n\nThey bring fresh baked bread and butter after you order. \n\nAppetizers - their clam chowder is creamy and comforting. \nTheir artichoke hearts was delicious and came with a great olive oil/vinaigrette dipping sauce. \n\nFor their entrees - their roasted half chicken is cooked to perfection and tender. \nTheir rigatoni with bologonese sauce is delicious. I try making my own and never again! - Italians always do it better.\nTheir Canolini is cheesy and filled with meat and some more cheese -- all the leftover cheese is perfect as a dipping sauce for the bread.\n\nMarcello's wine list is quite extensive; I personally like Rieslings when I eat Italian foods.\n\nFor dessert, they often have different flavored ice creams among other Italian desserts.\n\nYou will leave here feeling full, a little buzzed, very warm, and very, very happy.", "author": "Vanessa W."}

Me and my family came here because my step-dads co-worker gave him a gift certificate to this restaurant. Supposedly he said it brings back childhood memories, since his grandmother used to take him there all the time...making it a pretty old restaurant. \n\nService was nice. I believe it is a family owned business. Our waitress was very helpful in helping us choose our dishes.\n\nFood was not was I expected it to be. I was expecting more homecooked dishes with some secret sauce or ingredient but seems to be that the secret ingredient was adding extra oil to every dish. I ordered the carbonara with bacon. I was expecting to eat a creamy pasta meal with a pouched egg over it or something, but turned out to be a big plate of pasta, olive oil, and small bacon bits..I wasn't feeling it, and neither was my mother and her zucchini dish.\n\nThe restaurant needs redecorating/renovation. You can tell it's been in business for years and that the customers are loyal customers. I saw a lot of elders... but I gotta say, it's a new generation! Young people love eating and if a business is to succeed, it has to step it up with some flavaaa or that extra pinch. This place is missing something..", "author": "Lisa M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-10-06", "description": "After seeing this restaurant had four stars on average, the highlighted review said family friendly, and was rated at only 2 $'s, I figured this place would be good to take my two friends to while I was in town.\n\nI should have walked out the moment I walked in. The first sign that something was amiss was when I realized that we may have been underdressed as we entered the place but we were still paying customers, and the reviews on yelp HAD said family friendly, so i dismissed the thought. \n\nThe hostess came up after giving me and my friends the \"once over\", and She LITERALLY pursed her lips as I smiled and asked for a table for 3. She then clucked her tongue when i mentioned we didn't have a reservation. Her reservation book was empty, she perused it right in front of me like she was looking to see if she had any space available, so why would a restaurant be upset about a walk in when there were no reservations? I would have rather just been turned away because we weren't up to dress code. We then waited about ten minutes for a table at a half empty restaurant. \n\nI knew yelp is sometimes incorrect about pricing, but I never realized how off  it could be. I would not consider $25 (on average) per plate a 2 dollar sign restaurant. We had barely sat down when our waiter came up and asked us what we wanted to drink. We were still contemplating when he rattled off all the specials of the day and walked off without our drink orders. \n\nAbout 12-15 minutes later, after being ignored by the waiter, we had to hail him down by mentioning we were ready to order our dinner. Even after our vocal notice, he continued To ignore us (didn't even acknowledge we were there) and the bus boy brought us cold water (iceless) to sip while we waited. When the waiter finally did get back to our table, my two friends ordered fettuccine Alfredo (both opted just to drink water, though the waiter didn't even ask them if they wanted anything else) while I ordered the tortteline ala panna along with an iced tea. \n\nAfter the waiter left the bus boy came and refilled our waters. Our food DID come out in record times, but my iced tea was missing. I didn't mention anything was amiss because I wished to see how long it would take them to realize their error. The whole time we sat at the table, the waiter walked past us over twelve times to serve the customers around us. 4 other parties that came in after us were catered to first, 2 of those parties received their meals first. never, during his waiting other tables, were we asked how our food was or if we needed anything. The fettuccine, so I'm told, was mediocre at best, and my tortteline was in one of the saddest excuses for a sauce I'd ever seen or tasted. \n\nThe only saving grace of the whole meal, was the bread that they served 3 moments before our meal came out. After we were finished eating, the bus boy finally came out with my iced tea. I told the man we were already done eating and I didn't want it anymore. Why was the bus boy serving us anyway? The waiter served drinks at the other tables, why hadn't he served us? \n\nthe entire time we were seated, not once had the waiter come up and asked us how our meal was, or if we needed anything else. He didn't even check our water glasses, which were empty halfway through the meal, mine even before he had taken our orders. he did ask us if we wanted dessert when he handed me the check.\n\nafter i payed for the check, wanting to get out of there as quickly as possible, I didn't even realize they had charged me for the iced tea I hadn't even received, let alone drank, until the END of dinner, until after I got home. \n\nBefore we left the building, one of my friends went to the restroom, once we had  left, she mentioned that the servers she walked by on the way back to our table had all given her dirty looks. I will NEVER recommend this place to anybody. I've been more attended to at a coffee shop than I have here.", "author": "Tabitha O."}

That combined with the fact that it has obviously never been remodeled, give it a serious time-warp feel, which is actually pretty cool if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nAnyway, I'm not exactly an italian food connoisseur, so I just tried something that sounded old school: the spaghetti alla matricianna.  Best spaghetti ever.  Other people's dishes, like the pesto pasta, weren't as phenomenal.  The other major dish of note is the spumoni: it's the real thing.\n\nIf you're up for the ambience, you could certainly have a good dinner here.", "author": "Wes M."}

When you are outside of Ristorante Marcello, you brace yourself b/c it looks like a seedy bar.  You expect that when you open the door, you will be surrounded by smoke (well two women were smoking outside already).  You are pleasantly surprised to find a paradoxical atmosphere of fine dining and relaxation.  The waiter is extremely funny and kind.  Regulars come there as frequently as a daily basis.  The clientele were senior citizens minus myself, mom, and a couple.  The gentleman next to us stated, \"I don't use Facebook or Twitty! LOL When I talk on the phone, I don't need all that stuff, just hello-goodbye.\"  Ahh, where else will you find awesome people like that?\n\nI ordered the ravioli with pink sauce (mix of white and red wine), and the portion was just right to fill me up.  My mom was so cute and hesitantly asked the waiter to explain some of the dishes.  He was more than happy to do so.  She ordered the spaghetti with pancetta, etc.  Bonus: They have two flat screens at the bar, and the waiter chatted with me about my beloved Giants.

I ate here with my boyfriend's visiting family (all of whom LOVE Italian food) on a recommendation from a friend. That friend is now no longer allowed to recommend anything.\n\nI had the pasta primavera, which was among the worst I've ever had. (Seriously, a Michelina's microwave meal would have been more palatable.) The uninspired mix of vegetables (broccoli + cauliflower?) were both soggy and flavorless--I suspect, because they were frozen. The cream sauce was mediocre, though admittedly I've had worse. They only offered one kind of pasta: spaghetti (don't bother asking them to cook it al dente). My fellow diners had cheese ravioli (decent) and beef ravioli (which everyone agreed tasted very much like chef boyardee and was, also, likely frozen). The bread was cold, stale and inedible. Though we were still hungry at the end of the meal, we could not bring ourselves to order dessert, for fear of what we would receive. \n\nAs for the atmosphere....it was like walking into an estate sale in 1963. If the Brady Bunch house had a love child with a swap meet, that child would be this restaurant. I can not fathom how some reviewers deign  to call this place \"classy.\"  The best I can say about the decor is that the dirty doily curtains (hanging from crooked tension rods) perfectly complemented the popcorn ceiling. The stuffed animal head replicas peppering the bar, moreover, really balanced out all the paintings of \"the old country.\" The fact that the waiters are required to wear tuxedos  against this drab and utterly confused setting is all the more troubling (if not laughable).\n\nI will admit, though, that the waitstaff was very, very nice.", "author": "Catherine T."}

Marcello's is not part of the Hip San Francisco Restaurant scene, nor does it strive to ever be apart of such a movement. Rather Marcello's is representative of a time when neighborhood establishments where viewed as a place to gather with friends and family for events big and small. A place where people know you, a place to have a formal celebration, or just a rowdy Saturday night with some friends. At Marcello's the atmosphere is always friendly and inviting. \n\nWith all of that being said, not a thing in Marcello's has been updated since the day they opened - including the bus boy. This is not a bad though - it adds to the eclectic ambiance. I also find it ironic at the Italian Establishment that all of the waiters are Irish Immigrants. \n\nThe service is different than one would expect for Bow Tie sporting Irishmen. The waiters and bus boy are a little slow to the draw, but what they lack in speed the make up for in personality and friendliness. You never leave Marcelleo's feeling unappreciated. And furthermore you should not go to Marcello's expecting James Beard Golden Fork Service. \n\nThe food and cocktails at Marcello's are always consistent. I would recommend \"Frank's Salad\" and the \"Veal Marcello\". I would also recommend the full service dinner that comes with soup and pasta. The apps are also a good bet as well. Their wine list is weird, but very reasonably priced. You can get a bottle of Jordan Cab for half the price of anywhere else. \n\nThe other night me and a group of 6 of my friends went in for dinner armed with 5 of our own bottles of wine and purchased another 7. I don't exactly remember leaving, and was a little embarrassed to return, for fear that we upset the staff. But much to our surprise, when we returned they bought us a round of drinks and told us that they were glad we were back, \n\nThat is just the kind of place Marcello's strives to be.", "author": "Jack S."}

The veal, as mentioned, is fabulous.  If you can get it with the porcini mushrooms- order it because Marcello, the owner, hunts high and low for the best porcini's.  They also have a dynamite porcini risotto.  I sometimes order that entre as an appetizer for the table.\n\nThey offer each meat entre either as a \"dinner\" selection or \"a-la carte.\"  The dinner menu includes soup or salad- great homemade dressing, pasta, and a decent  portion of the main dish with potatoes and vegetables as a side/ sharing the main plate.\n\nHomemade pasta sauces are all delicious-great palce to have alfredo sauce.\n\nOverall Marcello's is a great place to go if you are out in the sunset and don't want to schlep downtown for old school Italian food.", "author": "Edmond S."}

A slow Tuesday night at about 8pm.\nWe had a wonderful experience!\nHe ordered one of the specials of the night, the sea bass with a caper sauce(which he seemed to enjoy). I had the eggplant Parmesan. \n\nI originally thought this should be a 4.5 star rating. But the place was so nice and hospitable that I decided it deserved to be rounded up to a 5 star rating.\nI only say 4.5 because the eggplant Parmesan was a little odd; it had a white sauce under the marinara (which made the eggplant extra soft, but also added a strange gravy-ish flavor). Both dishes came with sliced potatoes (sort of like au gratin) and greens on the side, maybe close to kale greens or something like that. But they were still both good enough dishes that we took the leftovers home.\n\nVery lovely atmosphere. Wonderful waiter and busser, both of them joked around with me and my dad. The busser took my wine glass away as soon as we sat down at the table, which peeved me for a second, but I look younger than my age, and it's not like it hasn't happened before. \n\nWe got the dinner meal with the salad and the pasta, which ended up being so filling that we weren't able to really crack into our entrees. Yes, the entrees did take a while to come out, but I think in general the restaurant is accustomed to people ordering this particular style of meal and allowing time between the courses for digestion.\n\nThe atmosphere is very comfortable, with a little bit of class added in. I felt under dressed compared to the wait-staff, but not compared to everyone else in there.\n\nOh and also they have a wonderful selection of wine!\n\nSorry this review was all over the place! \nI'd definitely go back because of that atmosphere and would love to try some of their other dishes.\n\nI wish the outside showed more of the character of the inside though, because this place is a gem!", "author": "Chaslin S."}

The menu, while extensive, isn't fancy, but features classic Italian dishes. Marcello is quite the mushroom hunter, and if you're lucky, his restaurant will have some fresh mushroom dishes as a special. I had a very nice veal scalopine al funghi with fresh porcinis mushroom; very flavorful with a nice touch of lemon in the sauce.\n\nThe place was pretty busy for a Wednesday night and service was a little slow.

It's a cute little place inside, it has a homey vibe to it. Lots of mushrooms hidden around the place, not sure what that is about. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were greeted when we walked in by the owner, Marcello. He had kind of a grumpy-grandpa thing going on about him, but seemed to be very friendly with the regulars. Being friends with the regulars is a great way to do business, but not being friendly with the new-comers is a great way to encourage them not to come back.\n\nA couple came in shortly after us and stood in the doorway looking confused, they weren't even acknowledged, and eventually asked if they should just seat themselves. \n\nOur wait for our table wasn't very long at all, considering it was a Saturday night during dinner time. They seem to do a decent amount of business, and have just the right amount of seating for a Saturday night. I did not see many people waiting for tables after us. \n\nThe food was extremely unmemorable and kinda over priced for what it was. I ordered the baked salmon and my boyfriend ordered the seabass. We were served basically the exact same dish, same stale potato (\"fries\"?) pieces, the same bland wilted greens with boiled onions in them... and the same sauce on our fish. His had capers on it. \n\nThe best part about the meal was the house pino nior, which they served generously. \n\nIt wasn't a bad experience by any means, the service was a 3 out of five, the wait time was short, the wine was good, and the food was mediocre. \n\nI likely won't be returning any time soon.", "author": "Sara L."}

(Diners are dressed relatively casually, though!)  Good food, good wine.  Good service.  What else could you possibly need?\n\nThe place was relatively crowded on a Tuesday night, which I took as a good sign.  We sat down and were fed bread and butter and water immediately.  Service was quick.  Our meals came with salad which had a great house dressing.  Two of us ordered the special salmon in a champagne sauce, which came with pasta with marinara sauce, served before the entree.  To me, that brings to mind Ragu and noodles, but it was actually really great--ziti with parmesan in a bolognese sauce.  The salmon itself was delicious--cooked perfectly and very tasty--with spinach and potatoes.  I ordered a Pinot Noir to go with the salmon, which was also a great pour One of my fellow diners ordered another special--ravioli with cheese and veal in a red sauce.  Everyone loved their entrees.  Granted, they were specials and we may not be able to order them again--but after food that good, I would order anything that looks good at this place.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Creme de Cacao and Creme de Menthe parfaits.  Also delish.\n\nReally, no complaints here.  Entrees were $11-$25, for whatever it's worth.  Great Italian food.  Highly recommended!", "author": "Erin W."}

The decor hasn't changed a bit for 40 years, the bar deserves some kind of hip retro status (though it is undiscovered as far as I can tell).  The waiters do wear tuxedos and have all the grace and charm you would expect if you went dining with your grandparents. \n\nPerhaps the most authentic thing in this place is the way they process money.  There are no digital cash registers or credit card terminals here.  It is all done by hand, on paper!  Just like they used to.  \n\nI have even seen some well dressed senior Italian men there with some menacing solidly built bodyguard types in suits - draw your own conclusions :)\n\nThe menu is a slice of Italian American food heaven from 50 years ago with all the classics, some of which I haven't seen in a long time like Sole Almandine etc.  The food is good.  And I am sure would have been considered top notch in 1958!  However, food has changed a lot since then, so I am not sure it's really up to snuff with current favorites in this competitive city.  That said I really enjoy the menu and always enjoy my meals with a classic martini or two. \n\n Go to Marcello's for the whole experience and you won't be disappointed.  If you lived on the tail end of those times like I did, it will kick your nostalgia glands into full gear.  If you are younger, it will possibly seem foreign and wonderful like something out of a Godfather movie.

So, delicious, with plenty of veal and just the right amount of mushrooms and artichokes. The thinly sliced potatoes and streamed spinach was the perfect amount on the plate and mixed well with the Marcella wine sauce. \n\nThe house was full that Saturday night, which I think is an indication that people know the food is good and at a affordable price. \n\nThe dinner price is a good value as you get choice of soup or salad with a side serving of pasta for the day. And then a cup of coffee or tea at the end of the meal. Dessert is separate. \n\nWe shared the creme brulee, a very rich and satisfying custard with caramel sauce. \n\nParking is not easy to find along Taraval Street. L-Taraval trolley stops a nearby.

I just wanted some seafood pasta in a nice wine sauce. So as the BF and I thought of Italian places in the Sunset, this was pretty much the only place we could think of besides OG. We'd driven past this place a million times but it always looked closed.\n\nSo after doing a quick yelp search on my trusty iPhone, we decided this place might be worth trying. And I'm glad we did. This is not an out of this world good Italian joint, but it is good. BF ordered the chicken saltimbocca and I had the spaghetti di (del? something starting with a \"d\") mare, the seafood pasta I craved. \n\nThe Good:\n-The service--our waiter was very nice and kept offering me generous portions of parmesan for my pasta, which I accepted as I like lots of cheese on my pasta but I didn't want to seem like a piggy asking for that much cheese.\n-The atmosphere--just like other yelpers said, it feels like a restaurant our of an italian-American mobster movie. A la The Godfather or the Sopranos, which is perfect for BF, who dreams of eating Carmella Soprano's cooking and recites lines from Scarface. Our waiter with his accent sounded like he was a Sopranos character. \n-Food was good. My pasta wasn't quite as wine-y tasting as I like for my seafood pasta to be. but it satisfied my craving. Saltimbocca dinner came with a side of pasta, salad or soup, side of veggies and potatoes.\n-Parking's easy to find.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Price. Price is reasonable the pastas, from $12-16, but it was $20 for the meat dinners. I think it's a little cheaper minus the side of pasta and salad, but still.\n\nSo 5 stars\n-1 star for good but not spectacular food deserving 5 stars\n-1 star for prices just barely within my budget\n= 3 stars, but I would eat there again should I have a pasta craving while in the Sunset.

As I have said before, it is hard to find parking in the Sunset, and this restaurant doesn't have a parking lot, so my grandmother likes to park in the driveway of the nearby auto body shop, since they're closed when we go. I order the same thing every time I go. So far this is the only place I have been to that knows how to prepare veal. Normally, veal isn't something I would have even tried, let alone even admit to eating, but once you've had it here, you'll understand. Compared to Marcello's, I think other restaurants serve regular beef (or whatever the heck it's called) and try to pass it off as veal. I can't comment on the prices because Nana pays when we go out, but I can say the service has been consistently excellent over ten years. Although they're usually packed when we get there, I think we only had to wait once for a table, and that time we sat at the bar and had a drink.

We ordered dessert, after he finally noticed we were finished with our meals & that was served quickly, again, which is great, but why does it take forever for the server to figure out that his table needs something? Like the check? Isn't dessert the last thing someone orders? Then the surprise of my son's chicken breast, which cost $17.50. WTF. I called ahead of time to make sure this was a family-friendly restaurant, which clearly it wasn't. Maybe the lady who answered the phone thought I was asking about if it was ok to bring my grandparents, not my child. Because everyone was definitely at least 40 years older than me. The decor matches the clientele & the wait staff probably moves slow to support the pace of their regulars. We only chose to eat here because I didn't want to drive all the way to Fisherman's Wharf for some clam chowder. I should have turned around the minute we walked in.", "author": "Lachelle J."}

We walked in, not knowing what to expect, and we were really out of place.  Marcello's is really old-school, both in decor and demeanor; the kind of Italian place where the waiters wear tuxedos, and almost yell at you for not talking fast enough.  Customer service is kind of non-existent, but food is ok. I imagine it's a good neighborhood go-to for Italian, but definitely not worth trekking all the way out to the Sunset.", "author": "Emily M."}

I ordered it med-rare. I was looking forward to it.  When it arrived it was already sliced to each rib. I took one bite, did not taste like any other lamb I ever ate. I am a Mediterranean I know lamb! Hello, it was BRINED!!\nIf anyone ever ate brined lamb ribs or any kind of lamb I would like to know where so I will not go there! My friends tasted it as well, one of whom does not like lamb even she agreed that it tasted nothing like lamb.\nI was and am very disappointed.. Tortellini was good, I tasted it, so were the potatoes and the vegetables which came with my  \"BRINED RACK OF LAMB\". I did not want to spoil the evening, did not send it back, just gave it to the sweet Golden Retriever Ruby (minus the bones).\nIf you ever order lamb at Marcello's please ask if it is brined and insist on finding out or just skip it!\nWhat a disappointment!", "author": "Yasmine S."}

He had a smile on the whole time though, so I give him that. I don't think I'm likely to come back. Oh yeah, one downer is that the whole menu is in Italian with no english descriptions.

They do not introduce themselves by name and say that they will be our \"server.\" I like that too. When I am in a restaurant and a person wearing a black suit, white shirt and black bow-tie approaches my table and gives me a menu I don't need them to tell me they are a waiter. I do not care what their name is. This is a business transaction. The ambiance is unostentatious and friendly, seems to have old-world class. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. Our waiter knew the menu and was easily able to tell us about the specials, answering all our questions in a friendly way.  The bread was fresh. We started with a rich dark minestrone. Salad is also an option on the dinners. Then came a serving of the house pasta with a tasty meat sauce. Cheese is always offered and generously supplied. They serve good quality Parmesan with lots of flavor. I had sea bass with a lemon and caper sauce which was really good, lemony and savory at the same time. My entree came with a delicious serving of chard and some sliced potatoes which were perfect for getting up the yummy sauce.  My dining companions were all happy with what they ordered. The wine list is reasonably priced. One of my dining companions was my father. We were celebrating his 91st birthday. On the way out I noticed happy looking people drinking at the bar. As we left the owner asked us if all had gone well. This is a great place and we will be back.  According to my mother, who has lived in the Sunset for a long time, this place is what the area used to be like decades ago.", "author": "Willy F."}

My BF and I ordered from the deluxe dinners that come with soup or salad, pasta, and after meal drink of tea or coffee. The menu was kinda hard to decipher unless you're a major foodie or just know Italian food. I know I had the shrimp scampi on the deluxe menu but it was called something else. BF had the veal. They have like 4 or 5 veal dishes. Very tender but it was the first time I had veal so can't say much about it. As for the pasta, it was a penne was cook to perfection and had a really good meat sauce.  We also had two types of vegetables that came with the meal. I didn't really care for it much. The potatoes were really cute  when I first saw them but they were kinda dry on the edges and as Alton Brown on the Food Network says, \"that's not good eats\". They did serve bread with our meals. Not so sure about the butter being really, really good. They didn't skim on the bread either like most places do. So I like that especially since I'm usually really hungry by the time we sit down.\n\nAll in all, I think the regulars know exactly what they're getting and stick to the tried and true method. \n\nI would like to try the homemade ravioli now that I read another yelper's review and save room for some dessert...", "author": "Judy P."}

The building has no windows and there doesn't appear to be any people going in or out....it says Marcello's on the outside...so it must be the place.  It's a cold and rainy Friday night at about 7:30.   The six of us walk in and the place was just packed to the rafters and as loud as can be...it was electric with people enjoying themselves.  Better wear your sun glasses and day makeup though...it's bright in there.  We were treated like old friends.  You will get a hearty meal, good service and at a reasonable price.

This is definitely an 'old guard' Sunset establishment. The clientele wasn't particularly diverse and the vast majority looked as if they were over 50. Not complaining, mind you, just giving you a sense of the environment there. The food was...okay. Not great, not bad, just okay.

If Don Draper from Mad Men were Italian I would expect him to drop by and have a drink at the bar alone and stare into space.  The waiters all dress in tuxedos but customers feel right at home wearing sweaters sans jacket and coat.  Ok maybe Don Draper would feel a little over dressed but he would enjoy the food if he ate something rather than drink scotch.\nWhat I also love about this place is that if you want to split an entree they do it agreeably  without a condescending attitude as some restaurants do.  If you bring your own wine they are happy to open it and even suggest decanting it for you.  They do charge a corkage but that is only fair  and I have no problem with that.  Also if you want to have more vegetables and forget the potatoes that is fine too.  Actually you can't do anything wrong here, the customer is always right.  A rare attitude with some restaurants.\nThe food is tasty, and served warm by a friendly waiter. \nIf you like the 50's and 60's when things were easy,  comfortable, normal and uncomplicated you would love Marcellos.", "author": "Sally F."}

For starters, I showed up there with a party of five and without a reservation when the place was totally packed.  The staff was very friendly and made us feel comfortable waiting for a table to clear up.  The atmosphere is certainly old school, as you are inclined to find out in Parkside.  For me, that is a good sign, not like the over crowded low quality touristy joints up in North Beach.  Once we sat down, the real fun began.  Once you have picked a wine from their ample cellar, move on to making a selection of appetizers.  I highly recommend the avocado and shrimp salad.  If you are in a large group, pick a few more and enjoy the familial atmosphere.  Any selection of entree is sure to satisfy.  Marcello's is a little expensive, but the price is comfortably reflected in the quality and service that they provide.  Good for an unpretentious-yet-fancy romantic date, or a graduation dinner.", "author": "Mr. G."}

So the basic vibe here is traditional Italian, with a whistling owner/matre d' patting backs and greeting long-time friends with grace, candor, and old time humor.  The food is good, and the bar is large and features more than a few fantastic regulars.  So why only three stars?  Well, there's a place called Golden Mirror, which is very close by, and does the exact same experience, but better.  You won't have a bad meal here (the veal is as tender as you could ever hope for), and, in case you were worried, I won't fault you for dining here, so you got that going for you.  But, basically, this falls squarely between Villa d'Este (on the low end) and Golden Mirror (high end) in terms of West/SouthWest SF old school Italian eateries.
