I've ordered from Eagle Pizzeria a few times now and I can honestly say that I have made it a habit to order from them as a first option!\n\nFood:\nSimply delicious. I really appreciate the quality that goes into each pizza. From the hand-formed dough down to the fresh toppings, You don't feel like you're eating pizza made from some teen at Domino's who's just there to earn a check. Pizza is definitely a passion at Eagle and their pies are very delightful to eat. My go-tos are Eagle Special or Meat Lovers. \n\nAmbiance:\nNever dined in, but the place makes me feel like I'm in a little league team who's celebrating a win. \n\nService:\nNever had a problem with service.\n\nParking:\nManageable, but might have to park a block or two away.", "author": "Tyler D."}

The jalape\u00f1os add a spicy kick to the pizza and the onions give it crunch. The sausage also gives it flavor, but it wasn't too salty which I like.\n\nMeat lovers - comes with pepperoni, ham, and sausage\nIf you love protein, you're going to love this one. The ham was really tasty and juicy. Not as flavorful as the Amy E pizza but still a good pizza.\n\nUsually I don't eat the crust but it was enjoyable on both pizzas. I ate three slices and finished the crust for each slice. The crust was perfect -- crunchy to perfection and not hard.\n\nService was great. The owner asked and made sure we were doing alright, but of course we were... everything tasted delicious so how can we complain? We were honestly extremely impressed and satisfied.

Sorry to say the establishment has gone down hill. First the pizza. Very basic and with VERY limited quantity of toppings. Ordered pepperoni and sausage and there was hardly any sausage at all. Also, the pizza was decent but basic and not very flavorfull. Next the drinks. $2.50 per soda, not the biggest cup, and they have the audacity to charge another $2.50 for a refill! I would not have accepted the waitresses offer for another soda if I knew they were going to be cheap and charge us for another drink. Next the napkins. We were given one napkin each without another to be seen on the table or offered. Greasy pizza often requires more than one napkin. Give extra napkins when the pizza comes to the table. \nPositives were nice employees and very nice sports memorabilia on the walls. I hope this place can get back to the way it was years ago but things are not looking good.", "author": "Evan J."}

Delivery guy and person who answered the phone and took our  order were very friendly but I can't speak to the building itself.\n\nThe pizza was ooookay.   The same league as Irving, Noriega and North Beach down Taraval but better than Taraval and Seniores  4 star? Definitely not.  The cheese was piled on with no care, maybe to disguise the scant use of topping.  The toppings that were there, were tasty though.  The sauce was on the dull side, but I liked the thin crispy crust.  HOWEVER, all of the above was negated by the night sweats I had from it and the heaving my friends did later on.  Hence the 2 stars.  Not sure if it was unsanitary conditions(since we had it delivered), or that it was room temperature when it arrived, OR it was whatever gluten substitute they used.

The sauce they make is awesome as well, hardy, not too sweet, and just the perfect amount as to not be overpowering. My go to is the mushroom and sausage pizza. I really like that they cut up the sausage into small pieces so that every bite has the perfect mix of ingredients. Every pie here is great, but for some reason tonight's was exceptional.

The gourmet vegetarian has all the veggies we like including artichoke hearts. We also like the clambake and request for just mozzarella cheese, and no cheddar cheese on that. And the margherita cheese and tomato is very good. The extra large pizza is a generous size. I like that the crust is thin and crisp on the bottom and the crust on the edges, is lightly crisp on the outside and light and tender on the inside - like a good French bread.

The first couple times it was great, crispy on the bottom but just enough doughy goodness, not too much sauce, not too much cheese, nice golden brown color on the cheese.  But then one night, I got a mound of un-cooked cheesiness with toppings that were almost absent.  So I tried again and it was almost good as before.  This last time though, it was inedible.

I went in after work to order a very simple medium pizza. I waited for 5 minutes before I received an acknowledgement of \"I'll be right with you\". The woman then very coldly took our order and said it would be 20-30 mins. In that time not once did we get a smile or a simple hello. But I should mention that all the familiar customers that came in were greeted very warmly and friendly. I'm not asking for you to kiss my behind but you don't need to be rude. How do you expect to make loyal customers when you are so rude. Maybe if they were busy I'd understand but it was DEAD in there .\n\nOn to the pizza, it was O.K. Nothing more and nothing less. Not worth 20+ that's for sure. It upset my stomach but that may have been because after 30 minutes of waiting I had lost my appetite.

The pizza crust reminds me of pre-formed crust from Pizza Hut only it wasn't even as good as Pizza Hut...which is pretty bad. The pepperoni was so off tasting and the cheese was not like real cheese. My boyfriend and I were actually laughing at how bad this pizza was, it reminded me of the SNL skit where the mom tries to serve her family 'almost pizza'. (See skit https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IHSRKU8XKIs ). The only way to describe this pizza is like aliens from outer space heard about pizza and then made an attempt at replication but it doesn't taste, smell or even look like real pizza. I wish I had taken a picture so I could share it here but we threw out the rest of the 'pie' after we had a slice each. I will say that we ordered a Greek salad and that was ok.  Basically, my recommendation is that, even if you are super hungry and desperate, you are better off making Ramen noodles at home than ordering out for pizza from this place.", "author": "Amanda G."}

I have no idea how the two of them made all the pizzas, set out place settings, served drinks, tended the bar, etc. the whole time.  I was even willing to help out, just in case, but they had everything taken care of!  \n\nThe local sports decor pretty much tipped it over the top for us.  Giants and Niners - YEAH!  AND Seals memorabilia was plastered all over the place.  Helmets, newspaper prints, signed images - they all help create a really SF feel to this family run establishment.  \n\nWe had 6 different pizzas, and they even made a tiny sauce and cheese pizza for Robert!  The dough is crunchy and bread-like: perfect!  The cheese is gooey, like mozzarella should be.  The toppings all tasted good and fresh, too!  \n\nNow, the beer.  OMG, the beer.  They put me on Moylan's.  I'm seriously a fan of their beer now.  The blueberry beer is like nothing I'd ever tasted before.  If you've never tried it, you must.  They still had some bottles of Orange&Black Congrats Ale.  Pure awesomeness.", "author": "ROB L."}

There are a couple great things worth noting:\n\n1. They have roasted garlic as a topping.\n2. They have blueberry beer.\n3. They deliver that beer.\n4. The service is incredible. \n\nIt makes me sad that it's not always bustling when I go in because it deserves to be. \n\nI discovered it one night when I was looking for a bite to eat in my (then new) neighborhood. Every pizza has been consistently delicious, and every beer consistently chilly. You KNOW they're happy to have your business because they're friendly and warm whenever you come in, and even when you order over the phone. Just in case you're not a pizzatarian like me, this kind of service is rare for a pizza place, where they usually just trying to rush you off to get to the next call. \n\nOne con: It seems a little pricey for pizza, but I guess you have to remember, this isn't Dominoes.

We usually wait an hour or more from our favorite pizza place, so this was a happy surprise.  The person who took my order over the phone was cordial and helpful, and the delivery guy was nice too.  Excellent!\n\nThe pizza itself is pretty good for SF pizza.  The sauce is rich, and the amount of cheese was just right.  The toppings could have been a bit more generous but they were tasty.  The crust is thick, pillowy and chewy, PLUS it has a lovely crunch on the bottom.  It's not extra-flavorful but I give it full points for texture.\n\nOverall this was a good experience.  I'll definitely order from these guys instead of the usual suspects next pizza night.", "author": "Lorelei S."}

We chose this place because they offer a gluten-free crust. \n\nWe (2 adults and 1 child) went out for dinner and had 1 small salad, 2 small pizzas (1 gluten-free, 1 thin-crust), and 2 beers. The salad was so bad we almost left, but I was hungry and wanted to give it another chance. Once the pizza came my 3 year old wouldn't even eat it. What saved the place was the man who served us, he was very friendly and we had a good time. The real blow came with the bill,  $60. I expected to pay more for the g-f pizza crust, but when we looked at the bill my friend's pizza was more -he was charged over $6 extra just for answering \"thin\" to the question \"would you like thick or thin crust?\". It was disappointing to spend so much money on such low quality food. There are other pizzerias in the city with delicious gluten-free pizza that don't over charge.

This place caters to the family, with kids toys in the corner and classically cheesy red-and-white checkered table cloths. Thankfully I got my order to go.\n\nA few nights ago I ordered a greek salad and a medium pizza, half cheese and the other half mushroom and pepperoni. The total was a little over $35, which seems really expensive to me. It was also kind of weird because it took the guy forever to run my card, then even longer to get me an itemized receipt.\n\nThe salad ($10) was bountiful and the vegetables used were pretty fresh. The dressing was kind of weak, seemed like a modified Italian dressing, but it wasn't awful.\n\nThe pizza (~$22, apparently) was a mix of good and bad. I really like the crust and sauce, but I think they could stand to use higher quality cheese and toppings. Like with most places in SF, it's thick crust, which isn't my preference but is still appreciated when done well.\n\nThe food here isn't bad, but it's not good. It's also expensive and gimmicky.

And bummed I tested this out on friends.\n\nThe salad dressing tasted (and smelled) of garlic. Nothing else. No anchovies or creamy, just garlic. The lettuce wasn't crispy and had some brown edges.\n\nOur pizza was, well, not the best. I've had gluten free pizza from Amici's and, altho the owner of Eagle talked it down, it tasted better.

Went there on a Sunday afternoon with family.  The gluten free  stuff isn't on the menu yet (8/29/10) , but the sign in the window was clear enough.  The owner was working the front room, so he explained that they are getting ready to update the printed menu to reflect the gluten free crust. \n\nOne of us had to have the gluten free crust. And this person has become a bit of an expert on gluten free, and loved the crust.  Also ordered was a regular combo with most things on it.  Both pizzas were very good.  The toppings were very good quality, the crusts were crisp.  Not doughy, not soggy.  It held up well.  \n\nAnd they serve the Racer 5 IPA, which appears to be a cult classic.  \n\nFinally, some pizza theory.

All the ingredients were small and thinly sliced, which is great for me because, having a distaste for mushrooms, I couldn't taste the fungus with all the bread and cheese I ate. Eating the anchovies was different--in that it wouldn't be my first choice of topping, but that's just me--and juice squirted out when I bit into it and definitely had a fishy flavor that was not outright unpleasant. My only disappointment is the size of the sausages.

Dough is made fresh every day (according to the owner) which apparently helps with making the crust just right - pizza holds up (doesn't start folding in half) and it doesn't get soggy from the sauce. They do not use a lot of cheese either - just barely enough to cover the top (I'm used to a ton of cheese from other places) and not overpower the other toppings (or make you feel full quicker). \n\nCleanliness \n\nPlace looked clean. Bathroom surprised me - not just the fact it was clean and stocked, but that it had baby supplies! Baby supplies! You know - diapers and wet wipes! LOL! What a relief for parents! Also, it took only him and his coworker 15 minutes to clean up the place after the birthday party crowd left (props to the dad of the birthday boy for offering us TWICE their birthday cake cupcakes for our kids, which we politely turned down). \n\nFYI - S.F. Health Dept. requires restaurants to post their scores. I saw the sign when we left and it was a perfect 100! For someone who had retaken and passed the Food Safety Manager's certification class, I was impressed to see the score. \n\nOverall: \n\nThey apparently have loyal customers as another family group came in, apparently getting ready for a Fantasy Football League draft party. The father went right up to the owner like they've known each other for years (which seemed the case). Lots of 49ers and Giants memorabilia! This place is the real deal!  Nice to see that old school neighborhood restaurants still exist.  Come on by for a good time and GREAT PIZZA!", "author": "Mario P."}

I have to stress the down right homey feel (red and white picnic-like table cloths, kids running around, complete with a stocked diaper changing station in the restroom) you experience with the friendly service and family oriented vibe, and is the real reason Eagle Pizzeria gets 4 stars. \n\nOur large group arrives and though we had reservations for the large table with view to the large tv, we were seated elsewhere (near the smaller tv) because another large group occupied it. We were told we'd be able to move to the table at a later time which was fine at the time because we were waiting for a few others in our party. 4 or 5 pitchers of beer later, we decided to just stay put at the table, and the waitress accommodated us (added new table) as best she could. Nice that bought us a pitcher for our troubles. \n\nAs some of the other reviews have mentioned, the pizza is not the best, but definitely solid with the crispy crust leading the way. We ordered the Eagle Special and Amy \"E,\" which we were later told are the best off the menu. The Eagle Special is your typical combination with peperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, green onions and olives. The Amy \"E\" is simpler with sausage, white onions, mushrooms and jalapenos. I love heat, so this was favorite...simple flavors, and nothing competing each other. \n\nGo to Eagle Pizzeria for the excellent service, and the Amy \"E\"...will not disappoint.", "author": "Marie B."}

My daughters were occupied with the play kitchens and it was refreshing to know that there were lots of kids there, so I didn't feel too bad when my youngest started to whine.\n\nThe owner is extremely friendly.

This place feels good when you walk in. I immediately figured out it was a family owned restaurant. The walls are covered in childrens drawings and sports memorabilia from many different decades of bay area teams. The baby chairs are ones you would buy at any baby store and not those ones that are wooden and look very unwelcoming for a little kid. I appreciated that little touch. It made me feel as though I was in someones house rather than a restaurant. The server, and I presume the owner, sat at our table and took our order. No problems at all with the service. Everything was well done on that front. \n\nNow to the food. We didnt get pizza, which I feel is a little unfair for Eagle's because the food we got might not be the best representation of their menu. Most people rave for their pizza and we didnt get it, but the food we did get was pretty good. I got chicken parmigiana(sp?) and my buddy got penne alfredo with chicken. Mine was good.

Granted the Giants were playing Game 2 of the World Series and the place was not that busy. The game was on the TV and the owner? paid more attention to the game than to us. It took a while for the pizza to be delivered and it was mediocre at best. There was an odd smell in the air. It actually smelled like a wet dog but my friend said it may be the smell from the cheese. The table clothes were still dirty and I did not want to use the utensils. I had to request the check two times. Even though this pizzeria is within my neighborhood, I probably would not recommend it.", "author": "John M."}

Coming here back in high school I guess I didn't really notice it but after I have tried coming here twice within the past few months both of my experiences were the same. The food itself was good, the service exceptional. The decor was nice and the place had a good vibe. Waiting for longer periods of time while larger parties await simply sucks. Outside of that you need to find a time where there aren't too many kids around and order yourself a nice beer and have a wonderful conversation with the owners/workers.

They use the same Still Riding GF pizza crust that Amici's does, but they seem to cook it to a more crispy and preferable texture.  They have a big selection of toppings, and the majority of them are GF (all except the BBQ chicken if I am remembering correctly).  The owners are friendly and attentive, and have been very accommodating to my dietary restrictions on both visits.  On the most recent visit, a mistake was made in the kitchen and they sent us out a free salad while they re-made the pizza.  The atmosphere is very homey and they have a great collection of sports memorabilia (Go Giants!) on the walls.  It seems like a popular place for parties and sports teams to eat.  In terms of the prices, GF pizza is not really cheap anywhere, but we have found the bill here to be a less than for a comparable pizza elsewhere.

I've only been here once, but the pizza was good. If you like fluffy crust and fresh toppings, which I do. It's sort of deep dish in quality, but not really. I'd compare it to the pizza you get at Milanos, but I'd give it a slight edge. They have Racer 5 and other micro brews such as Moylans and Marin Brewing  which gets them a huge bonus in my book. (They even have Chimay). Beer is an important ingredient for a pizza place. I wish they had more taps (3), but that's ok. The keg was acting funny that day and the girl gave me an unusually big head on my beer, but I brought it back and they fixed me up with no argument or attitude.
