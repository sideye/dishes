Phillip, one of the owners of Olea, happened to be our waiter and from start to finish was kind, funny, informative, and beyond helpful. \n\nWe decided to go to Olea because THEY TAKE RESERVATIONS which is so important on a Sunday brunch in SF. No wait for our table and we got to sit outside in the beautiful sunlit weather. \n\nHere's what we had around the table: chillaquiles, cazuela, custard toast, pork belly sandwich, huevos rancheros. We all sampled and tasted the foods at the table and everything was so amazing. Personally, I would recommend the cazuela because it was amazing and a great brunch option after a rough night. \n\nPhillip was so incredibly helpful and his restaurant is so cozy and welcoming and warm. He told us a bit of his story and a bit about SF and it was such a great time for all of us. This place is worth a trip no matter what your plans! We'll definitely be back on our next trip to the city. 5/5 location, 5/5 food, 5/5 service!", "author": "Cory S."}

Oh well - still happy with the meal!\n\nI think it's unique that Olea is only open Sat/Sun. There wasn't a wait for 2 - though there were larger parties waiting to be seated when we arrived around 10:30-11.

I'm still thinking about how it's made as it was so unique. My best guess is they use a syringe as to inject the egg whites because the insides were truly amazing. \n\nIf you're ok with nothing savory, getting a full serving is probably better than half serving (3 pieces vs 2) because you don't want to come here and feel like you haven't gotten your french toast fill.

Lo and behold, the outdoor seating of Olea beckoned us and we found ourselves in the lovely seating of the outdoors. \n\nFantastic service. They were incredibly diligent in making sure we had a blast eating at their place, and they made sure we had enough for my friend (who drank literally a gallon of water). Attention to detail was everything, and they were there for that. \n\nThe French Toast, as you may know, is one of their highlights. I was amazed as such delectable item that found its way into my mouth, and with the combination of custard coated in cinnamon sugar, it was simply a 5/5 off the bat. We almost fought each other to finish the last bite, which I am happy to say I won. Get this for sure if you're by yourself or don't have a stomach like a cow (or me...)\n\nThe Breakfast sandwich along with the omelette also made for a great combination - it's hard to venture away from a place that simply makes great breakfast food. And don't forget to get the French Press coffee - you'll want it to keep awake after a food coma inducing meal! \n\nWhile we didn't have to wait in line for brunch, I'm definitely heading back here to engage in another series of breakfast and brunch in San Francisco.

Most of the seating is inside, but if the weather happens to be one of those rare sunny days in SF, there's some seating outside to enjoy the sun and warmth. \n\nMenu was pretty short and simple, primarily with egg-centered dishes, and everything looked healthy.

Just the right amount of fluffiness and sugar. \n\nSometimes when I find my perfect order, it's hard for me to venture away from it, but I've tried some of their avocado toast and scrambled eggs; it seems like you just can't go wrong!\n\nLocated a block away from Polk street, it's not as packed as some of the other popular spots and the food is superb. There's still usually a line though so I'd suggest getting there about about 20 to 30 minutes before you'd like to be seated. It quite packed inside, but cozy with outside tables available as well. On a sunny Sunday morning, it's a great place to be.", "author": "Shira W."}

We sat outside and ordered the BLT with fries and avocado focaccia. Overall the food was pretty basic and overpriced. Was super disappointed. The service was also slow, our glasses of water were empty almost the entire meal.

I wasn't that impressed with Mymy (though love their other restaurant Griddle Fresh), but still thought it was a little more well rounded than Olea.  \n\nOur waiter was friendly but the wait for an order of French Toast and a scramble is just way too long.  We got there on Sunday afternoon around 1:10-1:15 and they close at 2.  No wait for a table luckily.  They just didn't seem to be as efficient in the kitchen, granted I know that the kitchen is small, but one should not have to wait over a half hour for these two fairly simple breakfast dishes.  The staff was busy but did not seem very attentive.  I ended up switching my husband my migas con huevos for his French Toast.  The custard French Toast was amazing with just the right amount of sweetness and apples garnishing the rustic bread.  My eggs were pretty much a scramble with some pork tenderloin some salsa and veggies.  It was a small portion and was just lacking seasoning.  Though hubby thought the scramble was alright.  \n\nI heard their dinner is really good, but not sure if they crank it out faster or if it is also just less crowded in general.  I think if I were to get Olea again, it would be the French Toast to go.  4 stars for that deliciousness but - 2 stars for slow service and the bland migas con huevos.", "author": "Cat C."}

We had wanted to go to mymy across the street but the line was ridiculously long so we decided to give Olea a try. We were quickly seated inside. Unfortunately, the service leaves a lot to be desired. 1) My friend wanted to sub out her salad for toast (or fruit which they don't have) but was told that wasn't an option and she could just pay for a slice of toast on the side. 2) We were seated directly in line of the front door which they decided to leave open on a pretty windy day to accommodate the servers needing access to customers seated at the tables outside (which I understand). We asked whether they could close the door a bit as we were freezing and we were flat out told no. After we pushed a bit, he finally conceded and closed the door a few inches. 3) If you just want drip black coffee, good luck because you'll be forced to order expensive french press coffee. \n\nOur food came quickly. I had ordered the veg omelette - it was ok but nothing spectacular. The service and attitude really killed it for me.", "author": "Yin H."}

I chose Olea because of it close proximity to our hotel, its price point, and its menu. \n\nThis particular morning was rainy and cold, so we arrived wet, hungry, and a tad late for our reservation. Luckily they saved our table for us, because the restaurant was packed. Olea is a small, but cute place. Our waiter was attentive and took good care of us. \n\n\nWe ordered the French Press coffee first and studied the menu. The Challah Custard Toast was calling my name, but I was trying to be 'good' and chose the bacon omelet while the Mr. ordered Huevos Rancheros. He enjoyed his and mine was 'okay' but truthfully I couldn't stop thinking about that toast. I think we shocked our waiter by adding it to our order mid meal. The Mr. likes to eat, so we decided to split the large order. Yes. We were being piggy. I have absolutely NO regrets. The Challah Custard Toast was everything I hoped it would be.

As many people have already pointed out in the reviews, *Extremely rude* and arrogant \"owner\"/waiter who seemed to take every chance to talk down to patrons. Owner (\"Philip\") was rude to my friend and started lecturing him, at one point even dropping that \"I run a successful business...\" fool please, we're in San Francisco, I run a business that makes yours look like a lemonade stand, do not try to pull that kind of weak, showboating behavior here. By the way as an entrepreneur: Shame on you Philip.\n\nAnother tip, BUSINESS 101: DO NOT lecture your paying customers. And learn some manners. SF is a small city - I will be recommending to everyone I know to avoid this establishment. If you're reading this, you should too.\n\n2. Very mediocre yet overpriced food\n\nI've never had such a bad experience in the city and such an unpleasant manager/owner/waiter who doesn't know how to treat customers. This business deserves to fail because it's owner is a rude and extremely unpleasant person, and I certainly look forward to seeing it shut down in the future.\n\nIf you want to see first-hand how rude and arrogant the owner is, just look at the responses he has posted to people who have left reviews in the past calling out his rudeness.

So disgusted with the service here and food. \n\nOrder was taken first and 5 tables came after us and they all got their food no more then 10min.  Server did not even acknowledge or came by to check on us for over an hr until we ask where our food was. When ask about our food, server did not apologize for the food but simply pass by and said yeah it's coming. No refills on water.  Being in the restaurant industry, service should be valuable.  I truly believe they have forgotten our order, it happens. What's unforgivable is not acknowledging their customers after walking pass our table over 5 plus times to count the least. \n\nI will give them credit for the press coffee, very smooth and done right. The mimosa was so sad, it was prepared on a regularly ugly cup and barely have any orange flavor to it given that it was suppose to be fresh squeeze orange juice.  Omelette was not greasy but very dry. Cazuela chicken was nothing special. Bacon was on the dry hard side. Perhaps because we asked for our food after an hour, maybe they just put it together super fast I don't know and I'm very disappointed. \n\nI seriously hope the owner read this review and work on their rude service.

I really couldn't think of anything that could've been better about our meal or the experience.\n\nWe waited less than half an hour at 11am on a Sunday, which is very reasonable for the city. \n\nThe food though. Oh my. If you haven't heard already, the challah bread french toast is amazing. It's a fluffy, cinnamon sugary, puffy goodness. Slightly damp in the center, but not too soggy, it's like a warm and fresh donut + churro. Since the french toast is basically like a dessert, I'd recommend a half order of this (or sharing a full order) and trying one of their other dishes as a main course.\n\nThe seasonal omelette with garlic, corn, mozzarella and collard greens was amazing. It was a pretty delicate and thin omelette, which just left me wanting more. The egg was very evenly cooked -- not too browned, just a nice soft texture that paired well with the filings. \n\nThe cazuela was really good as well. A sightly spicy pork broth, all baked in a dish. It also came with two eggs that were perfectly cooked. Grilled french toast on the side was very complementary for soaking up the saucy yumminess. The yolks weren't runny, but they were still slightly soft and orange on the inside. Left me wanting more. Again.", "author": "Audrey L."}

Glad I came, and it was worth biking across the city from the Mission!\n\nTHE WAIT: No reservations, no call-aheads (as per usual on SF). But there's no list even once you arrive; you stand in line outside the restaurant. You do have to brave the direct sunlight (bring sunblock or a sunhat!), but it moved pretty fast, and the guy managing the line (who reminded me of Tim Gunn, in both looks and demeanor) was efficient and checked often. It would've been about a 30-minute wait for a group of three around 12 noon, but our 3rd was late so we grabbed coffee at Contraband. When our 3rd got there around 1pm, we'd popped back into line for only about 15 minutes.\n\nTHE SERVICE: Great, efficient. Our server even got me a couple extra free slices of toast to finish off the stew in my Cazuela.\n\nBRUNCH\n* Cazuela (2 baked eggs, ground beef, bacon, fire roasted roma tomato, red bell & pasilla pepper stew, tortilla chips, pamesan cheese. $13.75) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/olea-san-francisco?select=tJoWFCTS0sNRSbLFVHYuFg#20tOHZ65BODG75Ct41P-ZQ\nYelp reviewers seemed to love this so I had to get it. I loved the crunch from the chips, softened slightly by the stew, the intense spicy flavors, the hearty meat. However, the soup was more watery than I expected so it wasn't as hearty as I expected.\n\n* Enchiladas (filled w/ shrimp, cotija cheese, carmelized leeks, poblano cream sauce, fresh salsa, black beans. $14.25) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/olea-san-francisco?select=tJoWFCTS0sNRSbLFVHYuFg#dm68z_VGkztAiv2a4Jzfjw\nI was surprised to like this so much!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-10", "description": "I definitely recommend this place for brunch.\n\nBased off of other reviews, the wait time can be a little long because the place is so small. We took those words of wisdom and arrived a half hour before they opened. At first, we were like, \"This is crazy.... why did we come so early?\" After about ten minutes of being there, we were more like, \"Woah, I'm so glad that we came early.\" This is definitely a popular place and the line does stretch down the block pretty early on.\n\nThey don't do any sort of reservations and it's first-come, first-served. Before you're seated, your entire party must be there to ensure that a seat isn't going to waste. I completely understand the concept since every chair is prime real estate. With that being said, if you're an introvert and have to have your bubble of space, just know that they will seat people at the same table as you if there are seats available. Some may find that awkward, but that never bothers me.\n\nI was already smitten when I sat down to see they had a full espresso bar as well as French pressed coffee. Of course I had to order both an Americano and the pressed versions to try out both methods, but my favorite was the pressed option. The Americano was good, but the carafe of coffee that was presented to me was nice and hot, smooth and made with a great bold, dark roast. It was about $5, and if I hadn't ordered the espresso drink, I just might have ordered another pitcher of the black goodness.\n\nFor food, I went with the ever so popular Olea's Challah Custard Toast. A full order got you two huge pieces of soft bread that had been dipped in egg and custard and grilled to a nice golden brown perfection. On top comes some delicious strawberries and once I poured on the maple syrup I was doneso. It's probably some of the best French Toast that I've ever put in my mouth.\n\nWe also split the scrambled eggs on an Acme rustic roll and it too was delicious. The bread is nice and hard on the outside and soft inside like a piece of ciabatta filled with a generous amount of eggs, bacon, tomatoes, and cheese that's served with a small side of greens.\n\nService was great and I loved how the owner came around to each table to converse with his customers. It was super busy, but he made sure to talk to everyone, clear tables, refill drinks, and give checks when his servers were helping other people. We never felt neglected.\n\nI'll definitely keep this place on my radar the next time I'm in SF, I'll have to explore their dinner options at some point, too!", "author": "Ryan C."}

I almost wish I had just sucked it up and waited the extra hour to get a table across the street at Mymy, but we were also pressed for time. \n\nMy overall experience with what I ordered/experienced/ambience/etc. is getting a two star rating. HOWEVER, I did try my friend's Challah French Toast which was off the hook (no one says that anymore...I don't know why I said that). So if I was reviewing just that dish alone, I would say four stars. The bread was thick and fluffy and randomly moist in the middle...it was just great.  \n\nThat was probably the only redeeming thing of my whole experience here. I also tried the kale/butternut squash omelette (which came with a pathetic salad on the side) and the Cazuela. Both the dishes were just mediocre and nothing stood out in terms of taste.

We were finally seated and the menu is very limited. Usually, places with limited menus will focus on the quality of the food and excel. However, I was quite disappointed to be honest. The majority of my party ordered the cazuela which they enjoyed. I tried it and it was good.\n\nI ordered the braised pork shoulder sandwich with fries. The pork shoulder sandwich looked  very good and I was excited to bite into it. However, the pork was chewy and dry. Usually meats that are braised have a soft texture with juices oozing out. This wasn't the case. At nearly $13 for the sandwich and fries, it didn't really meet my expectations in terms of price and quality. When it came time to pay for the bill, it took a very long time to receive our check then which was at least 20 mins and then again to get our cards back.

This was true; however, it seems as if they did not increase their wait staff.  Instead of a quaint brunch with friendly servers, it seemed as if they were overworked, and running around.  The table to the left had to ask multiple times for their check.  We did not get cream/milk with our coffee (and I mean for 8 bucks, really...) or syrup with our french toast.  The saddest part was when we realized that they changed our favorite dish - the Cazuela.  Instead of a special dish, it seemed rather plain in appearance and in flavor (its usually kind of green).  The waiter replied that sometimes they change the ingredients and was not sure when the other dish would be back.  \n\nSo anyways, still a decent spot, BUT i'm not sure it's worth the wait in line, over-worked servers, a-OK service just for slightly above average brunch.", "author": "Aly A."}

The host then repeated to us in a condescending tone that he does not move seated guests, and that we would have to ask the couple next to us if they were willing to move. Again, we asked them in front of him, and again, they said yes.\n\nWhen the food finally came, we asked for a single slice of bread to help mop up the sauce. The waitress said she could not bring us a slice of bread. We would have to order four slices of toast from the menu.\n\nThe staff never came by to check how we were doing during the course of the meal.\n\nThe food here is good. It's overpriced, but it's good. It's prepared nicely.\n\nThe manager should not be in his role as a manager. Nobody wants to visit a restaurant where they're given a hard time for making a reasonable request to feel comfortable.\n\nAnd now I'm getting harassed by the manager for this review.

It is a bit small so I don't recommend bringing your kids.  The host didn't want us to bring our stroller inside and said to leave it outside.  Really?  We told him that it can fold itself and wouldn't take much room. We finally were able to get seated after a 20 minute wait-with the stroller.  Not really kid friendly here, I guess! \nThe food was just not good for my taste... \nI had the corncakes with fried eggs and veggie mash.  Sorry but I hardly ate it.

Your pathetic lies and immature response says everything about your piss poor attitude and service. We never rearranged a single seat or table. We were told by one of your staff it's first come first serve at the patio and sat on a table of 4. The table had 4 empty glasses. Nice attempt to make us sound like hooligans, little do you know about us. Maybe what you didn't really like was my people's colour. \"OYE\" lol \n*********\n\nLast weekend, four of us plus our two dogs came to Olea for brunch. There was a small line up outside. We stood in line and the host happened to be asking how many ppl. We said 4 and will sit outside since we have dogs. Waitress said ok, its first come first serve outside so whenever one opens but we don't know the wait time. All the other customers ahead of us were waiting to be seated inside as it was drizzling (we heard them say inside and my wife personally asked everyone to verify they are not waiting for outside seating). A table of 4 eventually opened up on the patio. It hand empty glasses (no dishes at that point). Since we were next in outside seating we grabbed it (per the instructions to grab when one becomes available). Shortly after a waiter or buss boy came to grab the empty glasses from our table. We actually helped him collect the glasses and placed them on his tray. He started saying \"you should check with host before sitting\", asked us to move b/c he was cleaning and how it's \"common curtesy to wait to be seated\". Seriously? Didn't even ask if we check w/hottest  already, he was lecturing us in a rude aggressive manner. He clearly did not want us there for some reason so we simply gathered ourselves and went across the street where we've always had wonderful food and experience. It was silly of us to think \"let's try something new\".

It was Challah with custard filling and covered in cinnamon sugar, topped with strawberries. The food was absolutely delicious, was the perfect amount of sweet. The full size was two of these bad boys, but with the extreme fluffiness from the custard, it was very filling. We also ordered a large french press coffee for the four of us, only was enough for three full cups. The coffee was pretty regular, nothing special, but can't say it was bad.\n\nWhen me and my three friends arrived, we walked right in without a line. Service was pretty good and quick. However, towards the end, It started to get a little packed and people were waiting for tables and the waiters/waitresses seemed to be eyeing us and getting a bit pushy so we would leave and give up the table. We were basically still finishing up our meal when we noticed this attitude.\n\nHave to say that the pricing was a little high as well. If I remember correctly the french toast was around $14.75 and the large french press was $8.75. In my opinion, that's pretty steep for breakfast. On the bright side, they were giving 3% off of the check if you pay with cash, so this was pretty nice to have.\n\nIn conclusion, enjoyed the food, service was great until the very end, prices were a bit high, but would recommend.", "author": "Steven P."}

The perfect breakfast for a chilly SF morning. Mine had shredded chicken and a tomatillo sauce, with egg and some sliced mushrooms (?), but yes it all worked. It was wonderful. We also tried the challah french toast which was a good addition for some sweetness. Hell, not some sweetness a LOT of sweetness but it was soft, fluffy and worth getting. The avocado toast needed a sprinkle of salt to really shine. And it had to be eaten all together to taste good: egg, perfectly ripe and delicious tomato, and the salad. At first it seemed bland but as you ate everything the flavors melded together and it is a light addition to a meal. On our second visit (yeah they earned two out of our five SF breakfasts!) we had the huevos rancheros, and the corn cakes with vegetable hash. Both were done nicely. My sweetie loved the vegetable hash. I felt the corn cakes would have been better if warmer. I liked the sauce with my huevos, but huevos always leaves me a little hungry...I should have added something more filling. Still, their mexican sauces are seasoned well, and everything was fantastic overall. A french press coffee was good and strong, and I loved my cappuccino on the 2nd visit.

It was so good, that Matt P and Robert H decided to copy my order, and order the same thing.\n\nThe other party in our group ordered the slowly braised marinated pulled pork sandwich with green cabbage, cilantro and yellow carrot slaw and a side of roasted new potatoes.  Between the two, our dish was definitely better.  The scrambled eggs kind of reminded me of a different way of making chilaquiles.  IT's not as good as chilaquiles, but it did have more eggs.  I liked it, and the amount was a good size... enough to leave me full.\n\nSince this place was pretty small, we sat at a long community table with two or three other groups.  It was a fun experience.

Super nice, very pleasant. The male server ( not the owner ) was a bit absent service wise (must be specific, don't want to mislead the owner) , but nonetheless helped when I asked or water or for ketchup.\n\nFood:\nTook about 20 min for the food to come out. Place was quiet (came in at 11am) but felt that the wait for the food was just a bit long.\n\nSimple plating, both my friend who's a cook at 1760 (so he knows his tastebuds and has credibility food wise!! ) and I agreed that the food needed seasoning. \n\nI thought that since I love salty food I was just the only one, but he agreed as well. We tried to eat the omelette and sandwich without salt and pepper but just couldn't do it! Had to get an extra ketchup because the food needed it. (also they only give you a tiny bit of ketchup with a good amount of fries..after reading other reviews, maybe it's because they're trying to save.....)  However the fries were very very salty, luckily I love salty fries, but for someone/my friend that isn't a salt addict like me, it was too salty for him. Very crispy though :) \n\nFrench Toast was nice, custardy in the middle, not too heavy. Sweet enough, but paired great with maple syrup. \n\nLatte- friend said was not bad, but not amazing. \n\n****All in all the food was alright. For a $15 dollar sandwich (including tip) I would have expected a little bit more. And my friend who had the omelette enjoyed his omelette much more after some salt & pepper. \n\nThumbs up for the male server that asked for my ID since he saw on my card to \" SEE ID\" so that made me smile, what he lacked in service he made up with reading what was on the back of my credit card :)\n\nLuckily I didn't experience the wrath of the owner even though  he was there...He gave us our french toast and told us that the rest of the food would be coming...

Cazuela is served in a hot skillet and is absolutely a must try if you've never had this dish before. The Migas Con Huevo is a little heartier than the Cazuela and also fantastic.

Along with that, Olea's owner is the host and he does NOT allow outside food or drink. No seriously, he will force you to chug your coffee or juice that you went out and got because you were forced to wait in line. The two women who were sitting next to us somehow got the coffee by the Drink Nazi himself, and made for an awkward situation as he said he doesn't allow outside drinks and needs her to chug it now or give it to him. \nWeird right?\nNow for the good news...the inside and the beverages. I liked the music (upbeat, loud), the fresh squeezed oj or grapfruit juice(mimosas), the french pressed coffee (self-pressed by you at your table), and the polite servers.\n\nSo the food...I ordered the scrambled egg sandwich with tomato, bacon, and cheddar served on an Acme rustic roll w/ a side of greens...overall: 3/5\nWhy? I like a fried egg not a scrambled egg...always makes for a more bland sandwich. My favorite part was the bread...\nMy girlfriend ordered the Cazuela...a renowned and beautiful dish of theirs (Baked Eggs with Pork, Bacon, Garbanzo Beans, Spinach, Parmesan Cheese, Tomato Sauce)\noverall : 3.5/5 \nWhy? It is okay but for $13.75 'the juice is not worth the squeeze... ' It is a flavorful broth with a few eggs cooked in that my girlfriend said is nothign she would go back for. \nLastly, we gave into the hype and split the French Toast that the Yelp reviews were ranting about. I thought it was pretty tasty and gave it a 3/5 my girlfriend would've joined the hype and given it a 4/5 claiming \"it was just perfect. \"\n\nOverall...Olea's brunch gets a 3.7/5 and I wilI : MAYBE go back\nWhy?

Ended up having the Challah custard French toast with a large French press of blue bottle.\n\nAll that time and maybe three dozen visits since (I live much closer now, in the bay), I've only ever ordered the toast. It's the best French toast I've ever had.\n\nLike all relationships, there's been growth. Management changed, a mini-Cooper drove into the side of the building, closing it for a few months... You know, typical relationship stuff.\n\nI enjoy the current owner, Phillip. He's straight forward and takes the business seriously. He reminds me a bit of Tim Gunn. Despite ownership changing hands, the quality of the food and service remains high. It's still a fabulous location (and the building is probably more structurally reinforced now following the compact German car's uninvited half-entrance).\n\nFew rules: you line up outside and will only be seated when you're all there. It's a small place, and even though they have outdoor seating now, the wait for 4+ during peak brunch hours can easily run over 30 min. No outside food or drinks.\n\nLook, I can't tell you how the eggs are here, or whether the dinner menu is good. I see other people ordering not-French Toast and I get brain hurt. I'm sure that food is all terrific, because their ingredients and the overall menu are all excellent. Still, Olea is a challah custard French toast factory as far as I'm concerned.

The dishes veritably ooze freshness, wholesomeness and healthiness, and they're damn tasty too. Add a cozy basement location in (or at least near) the city's best neighborhood and what more do you want?\n\nWell, I think the pork chop could have been juicier and arranged on a more exciting bed than brown rice and peas. But it was still tasty and didn't do anything to erase my memory of the frisee salad with mussels I had as a starter. That was absolutely stunning - the best salad I've had this year.\n\nMy Girlfriend's meal consisted of the flat bread (flattest bread I've ever had and among the tastiest) with ricotta, pears and greens and a Mexican beef stew. Both of those were positively delicious. And the chocolate pot de creme for dessert was awesome as well.\n\nOur waiter was a delight as well, so all in all this was a hit and we'll be going back for sure, not only for more dinners but for brunch as well.

The feel is very European as you look up at the sidewalk from the site situated below street level. The simple curated menu features three starters-two salads and a bowl of mussels, and a handful of entrees. We shared the mussels and sopped up the delicious garlic and wine broth with sourdough. The duck was perfectly executed and melted in my mouth. My husband reported that the pork chop was overcooked and dry, the quinoa salad, although quite a small portion for the price, pleased my daughter. There are no sides offered, although they kindly brought a bowl of mash potatoes when requested. For dessert we had the tres leche cake, but it failed to satisfy. Other desserts included tiramasu and gelato.  We were told that the regular chef was on vacation, yet we found that the sous chef did a satisfactory job of executing the menu. Corkage is a very reasonable $15, and Philip was keen on providing fresh stemware with each vintage. The owners have opened a restaurant in Oakland on Grand near Lake Merritt called Kitchen 388 where they are serving Southern comfort food. Sounds like another place to check out. Our family enjoyed the meal and the homey ambiance. Make sure to make a reservation as capacity is very limited.", "author": "Cynthia B."}

In the midst of explaining where to go, we mentioned that we were going to Olea, so they decided to check out the menu and wound up trying it out. As they left, they approached our table, and one woman said to us \"I'm sorry to bother you, but I just wanted to let you know that that was by far the best meal I've had since we've been on holiday, thank you so much for pointing it out.\" \n\nIf that's not enough to sell you, I'll elaborate.\n\nOlea is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. \nHow can I make such a bold claim, you ask? There are a number of reasons.\n- Genuine and welcoming owner\n- Attentive but not overly-pushy staff\n- Gorgeous, fresh, high-quality food; literally everything on the menu is delicious\n- Warm, inviting atmosphere\n- Excellent wine selection and a skillful recommendation from the owner himself\n \nOlea's brunch is delicious (especially the french press coffee and the french toast), but the atmosphere is close and busy, and you don't get the full experience like you do in the evenings.\n\nIn the evenings, you'll be greeted by the owner or one of the equally kind and generous staff. As you sit, sipping a tastefully recommended glass of wine, you'll notice passersby drawn into the warm glow, peeking over the candlelit windowsills. You'll look over the menu and feel equally impressed and overwhelmed, as everything sounds so good - and I'll tell you, everything really is so good. Allergies aside, you really can't go wrong with a single dish on the menu. It varies with the season, as they only use fresh, high-quality ingredients, so if you're eyeing something but afraid to branch out, just do it; it might not be available next time you're in. \n\nThe pork tenderloin is incredible, and seems to be more of a staple among the rotating, ever-delightful assortment of fresh fish, lamb meatballs, risotto, short rib, white wine mussels, the list goes on. \n\nThe staff are hospitable and attentive, but observant and respectful of the guests' space;\nyou won't feel like you're being rushed to free up your table. The owner is one of the most genuine people I've met in the service industry. My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to become regulars at this wonderful spot, and he always greeted us like old friends. He seems simply delighted to be doing what he's doing, and it shows through his calm, charismatic demeanor, and the wonderful atmosphere of his restaurant.\n\nTL;DR - Nothing but good things to say about an evening at Olea.", "author": "Amy J."}

The owner/manager was super nice and kept acknowledging us and letting us know where we were on the list. \n\nFirst, we started off with a large french press coffee to share.

I love the extra crunch from the tortilla chips, but it also came with some crostini on the side. Yum! And definitely ask for some hot sauce. They make it themselves with whatever ingredients are in season!\n\nThe winning dish of the day was their amaaaaazing french toast! They call it custard toast on their menu and that's exactly what feels and tastes like. Because they use challah bread, it just soaks up whatever cream sauce they dip it in. The bread looks dry, but it's so creamy and soft on the inside. There's no overpowering egg taste like traditional french toast and it's just the right sweetness! It's so good that you don't even need to eat it with syrup! The sprinkle of cinnamon sugar around it is enough!

No complaints here -- we didn't have to wait at all!\n\nWe shared the pan seared coho salmon with lentils and avocado relish, as well as the pappardelle pasta with veal meatballs, spinach and parmesan cheese.

I love salmon, lentils and avocado, so it shouldn't have been hard for me to love this dish, but it was.\n\nAnother thing -- the fork that came out with the pasta was piping-hot.

The restaurant changed owners in May of 2013, which I was surprised to learn upon my arrival.  Fortunately, not only did the new owner apparently purchase the recipes from the former owner, but he is similarly a very friendly fellow.  We had two strollers and two babies, and he was very accommodating.  (FYI: this TINY restaurant is not ADA compliant and is not really stroller friendly, but they made it work.  The restaurant is half underground with high windows and about 6-8 tables for private parties in front of a small open kitchen and a communal table on the other side.  I have seen huge lines for this place on the weekend.)\n\nBecause it was Friday at 11:30, we did not need to wait for a table.  Yee-haw!  I had a TINY breakfast when I left Los Angeles very early that day, so I was ready to eat.  I was super bummed that the cazuela listed on the online menu was not on the menu for the day.  But, I opted for the Migas Con Huevos ($12.50).  It was delicious, albeit a bit on the small side (like TINY - \u00be of a cup of food).  They were fluffy scrambled eggs with sun dried tomato chicken sausage and shredded yellow squash and zucchini on top of crispy little tortilla squares and drizzled with an ancho pepper sauce and some sesame seeds.  It was served with two little pieces of crostini.  I inhaled every bite of this absolutely delicious dish.  My only criticism is the size.\n\nTwo in our party ordered the Olea's Challah Custard Toast.  For $13.25, it was two big pieces of challah bread, about 1.5\" thick, in an excellent egg custard that was grilled to perfection and still a little goopy in the middle.  It was topped with cinnamon sugar and strawberries and served with maple syrup.  OMG.  This was so decadent.  I was lucky that my friend was full after a little more than half (FYI - the half order is one slice of toast), because I finished it and it was awesome.\n\nIn addition to the very friendly owner, the staff is friendly and attentive without being intrusive.

With a reservation, everything goes smoothly, and without a reservation, I've only had to wait a little while (as I tend to go fairly late and with only one or two other people).\n\nThe service is prompt and friendly, and always genial and patient with people who take a while to mull over the menu and debate wine choices and so on. \n\nThe wine list is solid, though not thrilling in any substantial way.\n\nThe menu is brief, but manages to really deliver with only about four entree options. I have yet to bring anyone here who cannot order a meal option as-is off the menu with no modifications. In such a short menu they nonetheless manage to address every allergy, every dietary preference, and even some of my friends' weird food finickiness that is unique to them. The prices are really solid in the low-mid range, so dinner here is completely reasonable to everyone's budget, too.\n\nOnce delivered, the food is delicious! Even when it sounds simple, it is prepared with finesse and sensitivity. The vegetables are never over cooked. The meat is (so people tell me) always perfect. The balance of flavors is always spot on. The textures work together harmoniously.\n\nThis place is best for a very small group, or just two people, because it is so small, but as long as you are aware of your size limits, this is a great go-to for dinner, especially on a weeknight when you want something a little nicer than usual.", "author": "Vivienne P."}

I ordered a half order of french toast with a side of scrambled eggs and a glass of white sangria. The scrambled eggs were ok, and the sangria was a little tart for my taste. Maybe that's because I normally drink red sangria or because the only fruit in the glass were slices of lemon and grapes, but toast was heavenly. I wish there were more breakfast sides offered... since I don't eat pork but didn't want a full order of french toast, I was kind of limited with choices.

Our group of four was second in the young coalescing line at the time. At least six different parties were in line by the time the doors officially opened at 9:30am, but I quickly lost count. We were seated promptly at a communal table that could host a total of ten, and we got to share the table with three other parties (with group sizes of one, two, and two) during our stay. The small restaurant seemed to fill up immediately and had a wait list going.\n\nOur side of the table ordered the cazuela, soft scrambled eggs, and two omelettes with sides of bacon, coffee, and green tea. Everything was delicious, but I think our soft scrambled eggs orderer pined for the pork shoulder sandwich when all was said and done. One of the other communal table mates ordered the challah custard toast, which looked amazing enough for me to want to come back the following Saturday to try. (He also ordered a while ale by Hitachino's Nest to go with it. I'll personally try their mimosas next time.)\n\nI personally liked sitting at the communal table: we enjoyed the company of strangers, who turned out not to be strange after all. The guy who ordered the challah said he was finally breaking his gluten fast, and being the test for whether gluten really makes him sick, this may have been his last meal with said ingredient. The first couple who sat down went to art school and were discussing product design with the possibly-gluten-intolerent guy. And the latter couple was visiting from New York and, while they had just gotten married a couple of months ago, they were also planning a traditional Chinese wedding ceremony.\n\nThe verdict: I'm glad Olea is in my neighborhood, and I plan to make brunch somewhat more regular now that Ellen C. introduced it to me.

I hope, dear readers, you see this before you decide to try this place out. I wish I had.\n\nThe food would have been 4-5 stars had it been a better experience getting to that point.

A little pricey, but if the service is good, well worth it. \n\nWhat puts a sour taste in my mouth is the host/owner/whoever he is- is extremely rude and needs to treat his patrons with respect or he will lose customers. He had both me and another couple laughing with disbelief as he almost refused to seat me because he did not believe that I would order food on my own, asking me 3 times if I would actually order or if I was just going to sit there (I had a flaky friend who hadn't decided if she was coming to meet me or not, which was no hinderance to me getting my own breakfast!). Besides that annoyance, when I ordered an iced coffee and asked for a little cup of hot water to make a little simple syrup with the sugar (evenly distributed sugar, ftw!) he basically said no, and told me that regular sugar was better. Dude, just bring the girl some hot water if she asks for it! \n\nEither way, small enough things that I didn't leave immediately to go across the street to my neighborhood staple, MyMy, but I was annoyed enough to want to forewarn others and give feedback.

If you are just eating the french toast, many of my friends find the half order sufficient for one person. \n\nWhile I'm generally a fan of the place, keep the following in mind to prepare for some issues that people run in to here:\n\n* The place is small, though recently they have added a couple more tables on the sidewalk. Try not to come here with more than 4 people. \n\n* They do not take reservations for brunch nor can you put your name down. You must physically stand in line until it's your turn. My recommendation is that you go put your name down at Mymy across the street and grab a coffee at Contraband while you wait in line. Depending on when you get in line, the wait can be up to an hour. \n\n* The owner seems to have a lot of rules. One of them include not bringing outside beverages in to the restaurant. I feel it's a reasonable enough request but for some reason it really seems to upset people.

The shorter line at Olea across the street looked appealing.  The wait was about 15-20 minutes on a Sunday.  The relatively short wait was the best part of the place.  Unfortunately, the food was only eh.  I read some of the reviews online and saw that most of the recommendations were for the Challah French Toast.  Although I was tempted, my brunch partner did not want to share an order so I ventured for the savory instead of sweet.  I had the squash enchiladas, which I am not sure if qualifies as a breakfast dish but it was in the menu so why not.  I do not think its part of the regular Brunch menu, but I guess the dish itself would also be indicative of other non breakfast dishes. My dinning companion had a more traditional breakfast egg dish.  I tasted her dish as well and was not impressed either. It was ordinary.  The enchiladas were okay, nothing great.  I really thought the squash would add an interesting dimension but they mostly tasted like mush.  The only redeeming part of the meal was the homemade habanero salsa the waiter brought when I asked for some spice.  That sauce was very tasteful, and was the right amount of spicy.  Loved the sauce but unfortunately it could not save the dish.  \n\nFor the price/atmosphere/reviews, I was expecting more.  Next time I will just wait the Mymy madness.

We Came here after the legendary Red Door Cafe's line got cut off at 10:25am on a Sunday morning (really?) and were pleasantly surprised.  Wait was only about 15 minutes which was cool because I actually enjoyed talking with the person I was brunching with.  Ok TMI, moving on.  We got some omelette thingy which was good and then the CHALLAH CUSTARD TOAST WHICH CHANGED OUR LIVES.  \n\nIt was both delicious and mysterious.  It looked like regular toast from the outside.  But then on the inside (or maybe it was on the bottom, I don't know because I don't think I turned it over) there was this gooey sweet custard, \"like a crack filling in the middle\" I was told, quite accurately.  It was served with a few strawberries which were a nice contrast.  They also gave us maple syrup to pour on it - but for probably the first time in the history of me eating French toast (is this French toast or Challah Custard toast?) I actually thought it was better without the syrup.  Which was weird.  I kept having bites with syrup out of habit, thinking they would be tastiest, and then had to stop doing it because the bites with just the toast as it was served were actually better.  They hit it out of the park with this one.  Do it!", "author": "Aaron M."}

This new Olea with new ownership gets:\n* 3 stars for food\n* 1 star for service and \n* negative 5 stars for host and owner. \nThat's a total of -1 stars, unfortunately yelp doesn't allow negatives.  I'm sorry for anyone that didn't know what the old Olea was like. The early 4 and 5 star reviews on yelp  reflect the original restaurant not the current restaurant.\n\nI've lived in the Nob Hill area for over 10 years and in that time we have definitely been in need of a brunch place. When Olea opened up several years ago, it was a welcome sight, not only because we were missing brunch places, but because the food and service were awesome. This soon became my Sat morning go to place and when they started serving brunch on Fridays, I would pop in whenever I could. The staff were exceptional and knew me by name; and the food was amazing. Fast forward to a few years ago, I returned from a lengthy trip, turned up at Olea to find it \"weird\", the food was the same, the staff different but more than that there was just a weird vibe. I asked the waitress if there had been a change in ownership and she told me there had been - aha! that explains the shitty vibe. My first reaction was sadness because I soon figured out that the nasty host who had made the experience that morning unpleasant was in fact the new owner. Nonetheless I perserved, thinking that his terrible attitude was a one off. Boy was I wrong, I've frequented Olea less and less mainly because of the arse-hole attitude of the cranky old looking owner, and today was yet another crappy Olea experience and my last. Hey old man, you can continue to be a prick if you like, but soon enough people will associate Olea with the arse hole owner no matter how good the food is. Your attitude stinks, you are not the only brunch place in this neighborhood, there are now more and more brunch places, one only needs to cross the street or walk 2-3 blocks away to Polk where there are plenty of good brunch places with much better customer services than what you provide. There's no need to be a prick to your customers. No food in the world is worth being subjected to that kind of behavior not even yours, and yours has gone down hill since you've taken over. I hope you sell it soon, so someone else can bring the old Olea back.", "author": "Elzabeth G."}

This line is in part because there's no waitlist, but after maybe only a 20 min wait after 11 on a Sunday, our group of 3 got seated.  Had a half order (1 slice) of the Challah Custard Toast and their omelet of the day. At first I was worried that the toast might be a soggy affair like LaBoulange, but in fact it was pretty much perfect - the custard toast was actually quite fluffy with crisped edges, dusted perfectly with cinnamon and sugar, and some strawberries. No need for syrup, although they supplied that as well. I'd rank this one as good as or better than the Butler and the Chef. The omelet was equally yummy, containing white corn, collard greens, garlic, cheese, and maybe something else. It was a great combination, and the garlic worked really well, being present but not overpowering. Spacing between tables can be a bit tight, but otherwise no complaints.

We just missed the first seating so we put our names down and were the 2nd on the list.  They do clearly tell you that they won't seat you unless your entire party is here.  No worries.  I went with my bf so it was just the 2 of us.  I remember the guy who put his name in before us because he had these crazy boots on.  We were told it would be 30-45min, so went next door to get coffee and apparently missed them calling our name (were back in 20 min btw).  They said we had to go to the bottom of the list, which would be at least another hour.  What????  Meanwhile the guy in front of me got to keep his spot on the list because his whole party wasn't there yet.  And as soon as his buddy arrived they got the next seating.  Huh????\n\nSo I get punished for having everyone here but he gets to keep his spot in line because his wasn't?  What crazy logic is this?  Everywhere else in town lets you go next if you missed your turn being called, as long as your whole party is there.  I get it if your whole party isn't there, but I've never heard of a place that forces you to the very bottom of the list if you miss your call.  What about the guy before us?  He clearly wasn't ready to be seated either but because he was physically there when they called him, even though he wasn't ready to be seated, he got to keep his spot on the list?  \n\nThe guy calling the names didn't even care to explain his logic to me, he just kept saying, sorry, you need to wait here on the sidewalk if you want to be seated.  Then why have a list?  At Dottie's, they make it clear you need to wait there in line b/c they have no list, so if you step out of line, well, you lose your spot.  Clear.  At Brenda's, there's a list.  You put your name down and can do whatever until they call you.  If you're not there when they do, they circle your name and call you again.  You don't have to go to the bottom of the list.  \n\nI was so furious (and clearly still am given the length of this rant) that I refuse to reward a place with such a crazy system with my hard-earned cash.

The only reason I was up and out for brunch is because I live on east coast time, so this felt like brunch time for me. I'd been up since 4:30am PST yelping spots that I could get a good carby brunch and I originally decided on Mama's. It opens at 8am and I got there at 8:13am. The line was down the street....at 8am!! It put Clinton Street Bakery's line to shame. Daniel Humm himself could have been in that kitchen cooking and I wouldn't wait in that line.\n\nSo, I started looking for another decent spot. I'd bookmarked Olea and we waited in a coffee shop across the street for it to open. I'm so glad we did. I ordered the full order of French toast and it was amazing! It's high on my list of favorite french toast dishes. I'd definitely go back again the next time I'm in SF.", "author": "Brittanie M."}

Three stars because as tasty as the food was, I found it to be on the bland side and waters didn't include ice in it, so it was slightly room temperature (I always drink water with ice, that's why).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-15", "description": "Note: This is an updated review based on the fact that I have now been to brunch there. I stand by my original 3-star review for dinner, which is included in full below.\n\nBrunch: 4-sars\nDinner: 3-stars\n\nSo if I could give them 3.5 total I would.\n\nBrunch:\nReturned to Olea based on the strength of other brunch reviews - and I must say I was not disappointed. Clearly a 4-star brunch at least!\n\nAs everyone else attests to, the custard french toast is truly great! It is rich and creamy, but without being undercooked, There is just a hint of browning and crunch on the outside edges, but without ever being overdone. They offer both a full and half portion - be kind to yourself and just get the full version! You will thank me later.\n\nThe custard french toast has enough natural sweetness that you barely need any syrup - but if you choose to add some anyway, you want be sorry, there is no fake high-fructose syrup here, just the real stuff. \n\nThe wait (they don't take reservations for brunch) was about standard for this city on a nice Sunday (maybe 20-25 minutes). But don't worry, just leave one person in line and the rest can go grab a to-go coffee beverage of choice from Contraband coffee just across the street. Please note: the owner regularly checks the entire line and will seat full parties even if they are further back ahead of partial parties at the front of the line. Personally I think this is an A-OK practice and appreciate that it probably helps them turn tables faster, but it is just something to be aware of - if you are with a group, make sure everyone is there!\n\nService was great, attentive but not aggressive. The menu is small, but focused, and the quality is great. And quite honestly even if the menu was only a single item (custard french toast) I would still recommend it, that's how good it is!\n\nOverall:\n4-stars for brunch! (But sadly not as great for dinner in my opinion)\n\nPros:\nAmazing french toast\nGood service\nFocused, clear menu, with great attention to quality of ingredients\n\nCons:\nNone really. The only possible con I could think of is that they don't take reservations for brunch, but then again most places in the city don't.\n\nSummary: \nGo for brunch. \nIf you are more interested in dinner, expect a similarly small, focused dinner with a focus on quality ingredients prepared in an un-fussy way. But beware of a lack of options in apps and dessert category, and a wine list that seems expensive (see below).\n\n--------\nOriginal review:\nHad dinner here the other night, and the food was delicious. Lovely duck breast, cooked fairly well (maybe a tad overdone for my taste, but still quite good), and great pasta. But I probably won't ever be back except maybe to try the brunch which seems to get rave reviews. \n\nSo why won't I be returning? To begin with, the lack of menu options: while there are enough entree options (a fish, a pasta, a fowl, a meat, vegetarian and vegan options), there was a near lack of starters - in my opinion two salads not constitute an appetizer menu (no hot apps, no soup). And the dessert options that night had nothing for those that like chocolate. \n\nSecond, the pricing at Olea seems a little out of whack. The entrees are all amazingly priced (nothing over $18!) and still have large enough portions, but the wine list is overpriced for what you get ($15 for a glass of Kendall Jackson?).\n\nPros:\nGreat farm to table fresh entrees \nGreat value for entrees\n\nCons:\nOverpriced wine\nLittle appetizer selection\nNo full bar\n\nMy verdict: maybe go for brunch based on other great reviews, but don't go for a leisurely dinner expecting 3 full courses at a relaxed pace.\n\nUPDATE: \nThe owner left a note on my review that wine prices are based on a 8 oz pour. And that would be totally understandable, except I don't think I got an 8 oz pour. So I stand by my original review. \n\nPlease note there are many great things about dinner at Olea - the entrees are remarkable, featuring excellent produce and meats, prepared in elegantly simple dishes. The limited menu (around 6 entrees) is in no way a detractor for main dishes where every option seemed great, but can be problematic for apps or dessert where there are often only 2 options. And if you are being charged for an 8 oz pour of wine, then make sure you get one.", "author": "Jane B."}

It's a quaint little shop that only has about eight or nine tables including one large table that can sit about eight people. Our waitress and server was a very sweet lady. We enjoyed a small blue bottle french press that's perfect for two while we waited for our mains. The lady got the french toast, and I must admit that it's the best that I've had in the Bay Area. Challah must be the best kind of bread to use for french toast because it gives it a crispy crust and a thick, airy filling with a light custard. Topped with cinnamon sugar and strawberries and you have one amazing french toast. I had their omelette of the day that had very complementary flavors and a kick of heat setting it apart from most other omelettes.  \n\nI wished I lived in an area with little neighborhood restaurants just like Olea.

We're friends in that ex-colleague who get along and run into each other every 6 months kind of way. I don't get any special treatment or get comped any food when eating here. So even though my friend has been telling me to try the brunch here for ages - and I mean ages, like 3 years - I admit I'm lazy when it comes to brunch. I don't like getting up early on the weekend and if I have to to get dressed to gout to eat before noon I prefer it to be close to home.  So if it makes me a bad friend, sue me.\n\nIn those 3 years I've managed to befriend someone who lives in Nob Hill, so naturally when he suggested brunch (yes, men do sometimes suggest brunch) Olea was the first thing that popped into my head.  After much debate over whether brunch should be closer to breakfast or lunch, we settled on 10:30 AM.  Good thing I didn't get my way because it put us at the top of the waitlist when we arrived.  The restaurant was already full and as we loitered not eh sidewalk outside more people kept showing up and putting their names down.  Apparently Olea is the place the go for brunch and I'm the last person to figure this out.\n\nWhen we sat down it was apparent that the brunch item to order was eggs.  Any egg item if you into savory brunches.  Between us we were tempted by and ordered all three egg options: eggs baked in cazuela, flat omelette and standard stuffed omelette.  I was only able to try the eggs in cazuela and flat omelette.\n\n* large carafe of blue bottle coffee - enough for 3 people plus another round\n* eggs baked in cazuela (with ground pork, bacon, kale, cannelini beans, tortilla chips) - comes with homemade hot sauce which is super hot but goes so well with this dish if you can stand the heat, great combination of flavors and textures, I love tortilla chips in soups and stews so maybe I'm partial\n* flat omelette (with andouille sausage bits, chinese long beans, oaxaca cheese) - I actually liked this even more than the cazuela dish, the sausage and long beans were super tasty\n\nI would definitely recommend Olea for brunch.

We walk or drive by the place so much and finally decided to give it a try. We arrived around 10:30 and there was already a line. Since there's only two of us, we were seated within 10 minutes at the communal table. We read that Olea is known for the French toast, so we decided to split that and this chilaquiles like dish. They also serve Blue Bottle coffee so I got to experience that for the first time here too.\n\nThe coffee arrived in a posh-looking French press. The place has the organic raw sugar cubes, also adding a classy touch. The coffee was mild (or some would call it \"smooth\"?) compared to the Starbucks stuff that I'm used to. I am not a coffee connoisseur so whatever makes Blue Bottle so popular and expensive is lost on me. Definitely happy to try it, though.\n\nThe chilaquiles-like omelette was fantastic! I've tried the one from the Ferry Building farmer's market, which is suppose to be a very good version of the dish, and wasn't impressed. Granted, Olea didn't call it a chilaquiles, but the dish had all the elements -- the scrambled eggs, the sauce (green, in this case) and the fried tortillas. The tortillas were in strips instead of chips and they stayed crunchy until the last bite. The sauce wasn't as sour as the green sauce on the chilaquiles from the Alemany farmer's market and it had small speckles of pork. The eggs were wonderfully soft and runny, just as I ordered. I would definitely get it again.\n\nThe star of the meal, without a doubt, was the French toast. They probably soaked the challah in the custard batter for a while for it to soak up all the goodness. The French toast was so soft and airy, with a mild sweetness, but not soggy. I can still feel the texture of the egg bread. The dusting of cinnamon and sugar mixture is a little crunchy and makes the treat extra special. There was so much reluctance in Orin's eyes when it was time to switch plates, it took everything he had not to run off with the plate to a deep cave somewhere to enjoy it all by his lonesome. Mmmmyyyyyy preeeeeecious...\n\nAfter our brunch experience, I'm quite excited to go back for dinner. The portion size here is on the small side, but that allows you to walk out of the place without the fear that the button on your pants will pop off the minute you stand up and take out someone's eye.

They were extremely nice and let us know that we had several options for seating arrangement, but my party insisted that we sit together. So, I would recommend this ideally for a smaller party of less then 4. Any more, then you would have to get there earlier, however, I promise that it is quite worth the wait. \n\nThe host, Daniel, was extremely friendly make sure that my party was comfortable. he occasionally checked up on us actually while we were waiting outside. \n\nWhen it came time to order, I asked our server, Amanda, if I could have the scrambled eggs a bit runnier. She insisted that the eggs were perfect as is and I honestly took her word for it. You see I judge a brunch placed on their scrambled eggs. the beauty in the dish is that you think that it is simple, but it isn't. I expect the eggs to be a bit runnier as it create a creamy silk text. It should basically melts in your mouth. I digress.\n\nSo I believe the manager, Wade, (at least I think he was the manager) served my plate and suggested that I try the eggs with a in-house hot sauce. The first bite of the eggs and I can't believe how perfectly it hit that consistency of my ideal scrambled eggs. It was also seasoned perfectly, I did not have to add any additional seasoning, or the hot sauce. I have to say it is the best brunch place that I have been to so far. I was totally in love with Dottie's True Blue Table, but I feel that Olea edged them own just by the slightest hair. \n\nWade would check on our table periodically and would be quite the joy to chat with. He suggested that we share their french toast. I have say that I was also not disappointed by this choice. IN fact, I am so happy that he recommended it. It was the fluffiest French Toast that I have ever had. They use a custard mix and soak a day old bread (it was a fancy name, but I don't remember what it was called). This helps to create that fluffy consistency without it becoming mush. There is a perfect balance between the use of brown sugar and cinnamon. And the \"Cherry on top of it all\" was the light brown sugar coating on the fresh strawberry toppings. The sugar balances the tartness amazingly. \n\nTheir other server, Samantha, was also attentive as she made sure that our glasses were consistently filled. \n\nI have to say that this wasn't just an awesome food place, but it was also an amazing experience. The space was small enough to feel like someone's home, but not so tight that I didn't feel that I couldn't breathe. My party was extremely happy and well attended too. \n\nI look forward to my next visit and possibly checking out dinner.\n\nTL;DR: great service and awesome food especially the French toast and scramble", "author": "Richard S."}

Lucky for us, the former is true (though there are plenty of pork-infused options in case you got worried for a second.)\n\nMy s/o ordered the Challah Toast (since everyone and their mother recommends it on Yelp and Foursquare.) I, meanwhile, ordered the omelet with sweet potatoes, collard greens and almonds. The Challah Toast was delicious. Not life altering like some have mentioned, but definitely worth trying. The omelet was interesting -- the almonds added a nice texture to the dish, and I always enjoy an egg dish prepared with new flavors. After finishing our main brunch meal I was still a little hungry so I ordered their yogurt & granola with agave nectar, strawberries, persimmons and fuji apples. It was as good as it sounds. I also had their fresh-squeezed orange juice which was literally being squeezed before it was brought to the table, and was the perfect way to kick start a lazy Sunday.\n\nI don't know if I'd return to Olea for brunch again because their menu options are limited, and there's not much else on the menu I want to try - plus the lines are so long.

All looked appetizing and sufficient enough to accompany our mimosas with fresh squeezed \"organic\" oj.

The omelet was as expected, but it was the baked eggs residing in tomato sauce with smoked ham and basil-almond pesto that stole the show.

The wait time wasnt too bad but there are only 2 tables that can hold a group of 4 so that would be the only thing that could cause a longer wait time. The omelets change weekly with all the freshest ingredients they can find. Since there were four of us, we decided to all get different things to try, along with their freshly squeezed orange juice.\n\nCustard toast with cinnamon sugar & strawberries: AMAZING. definitely a unique twist on french toast and though it was more of a dessert dish, it wasnt super sweet considering they cooked it with custard. it said it came with maple syrup, which was probably added into the toast before being served, but i wish they had a small container on the side so we could add more on our own. \n\nEggs in a cazuela with french toast: hmm...definitely different then what i expected. It had an exotic middle eastern look, basically it was poached eggs inside a tomato/cheese/ground beef soup with strips of toast on the side. Although it was flavorful, I wish it had a little spicy kick at the end to make it special. plus, for $13, i expected to be a bit fuller after brunch. The bowl it is served it is probably half an inch deep, MAX. \n\nMussels soup: the broth reminded me a bit of the asian sweet and sour soup with some corn mixed in. The sourdough bread that was served with the dish tasted fresh and soft, perfect compliment.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-12-17", "description": "I've lived in the Nob HIll/Polk Street area for a few years now--since before Olea opened, in fact--and I've only just recently tried this restaurant. I really cannot point to a single reason why I avoided going here for so long (is that hideous font on their sign REALLY a reason to pass it by for years?); however, having finally given it a shot, I can safely say I have no reason to go back. \n\nIt's been a suspicion of mine that brunch is, perhaps, one of the most over-hyped things of the 20th/21st centuries. It always seems overpriced, it's rarely memorable, and, frankly, I can't help but feel like I've been had every time I've ventured out for it. Though perhaps \"had\" is the wrong word... or perhaps it doesn't convey exactly what I'm going for. What I mean to say is this: every time I go to brunch, the feeling afterward is akin to what I would feel after getting not-so-subtly groped by an ugly stranger on a bus.\n\nAnd after eating brunch at Olea, I'd add the following: that feeling you get while you're looking through your wallet the morning after a pretty wild, drunken night. You know the one I'm talking about? That moment where you're pretty sure you should have $20 - $40 more in your wallet than you currently do, and you're also pretty sure it fell out of your pocket in the cab because you were too fixated on getting fresh donuts instead of organizing your money properly...  \n\nYea... \n\nSo my boyfriend, Joaquin, had the french toast. It was \"good enough\". I need to put that in quotes, because I need to somehow stress that this french toast was not at all the ground-shaking dish many here seem to claim it is. It's FRENCH TOAST, Yelpers! Do we realize how uncomplicated this dish is? They use challah bread, which is a wise choice for french toast, but trust me, I've been making and eating french toast for years (one look at me in person will verify this statement), and this is not a difficult dish. Olea's output is not surprising or unique.\n\nI tried the cazuela, and it's no lie that I was expecting something far more interesting and flavorful than what I received. It's one of those dishes where you know--you just KNOW--the individual ingredients are more flavorful than the semi-watery pile of egg scramble you've been handed. You look at the menu again, and you just can't figure out how 1 + 1 + 1 somehow ended up a 0. There were tortillas in the mix, so it had a bit of crunch, but beyond that, it just didn't amount to much of anything. \n\nMy iced coffee was good, as was the orange juice, but that by no means redeems the  meal, much less the price we paid for it.\n\nIf I was somewhat skeptical of the brunch concept to begin with, this place sealed the deal. It's just not worth it.", "author": "Brian K."}

I've heard from friends about this place time and time again, but didn't really believe it until I tried it for the first time about a month ago. And I still think about it, and wonder when I'll return next.\n\nWhat we ordered (best to least favorite):\n1. challa french toast with a side of bacon: BEST combination ever. Their challa french toast is the perfect density, sweet but not too sweet, and just tastes fresh. Add a small piece of bacon to a bite of the french toast, and you're smitten. The bacon is not greasy, it almost seems like it's been baked or something. Anyway, the crunchiness of the bacon with a bite of the \"chewy\" (in a good way) makes you just want more.\n\n2. Cazuela: DELICIOUS, savory in every way possible. The toast that accompanies is more like slices of french toast baguette toasted, which brings a great texturewhen eaten with the cazuela. The cazuela was soupy, but rich and almost creamy-like.\n\n3. xuxo's fresh corn torte (not at all bad, but something has to be my least favorite): Think of corn bread, but sweeter and like a dessert. It comes with a very dense/rich cherry syrup with cherries. Delicious, more like a slice of cake than an entree-type of dish, but still delicious.

They kept the cazuela and the addicting french toast and the secret have to ask for spicy sauce.  They still have the best brunch in San Francisco and we consistently go every 2 weeks at least.  Most importantly they kept that wonderful neighborhood feel.    Incredibly low prices for organic, farm fresh food.  Simple menu but everything is executed perfectly.  Whether it's a crispy french fry with just the right amount of sea salt flakes clinging on or the baby lettuce leaf salad with castelvetrano olives and pumpkin seed (just layers of flavors so fresh!), I've never been disappointed here.

The owner just doesn't sit around chatting or lording over the staff, but busses, serves, and gets right in the thick of things to help run the place.  \n\nI really hope people come to see this kind of soulful small business ownership but I know you'll keep coming back for the best brunch ever.", "author": "Jae H."}

That said, it gets two stars from me for the very unpleasant customer service. When we asked the host to put our name on the list, he told us that the wait for a table for 2 was 30-40 minutes. He then added a series of \"rules\" - he told us not to \"wander off\" and also not to \"put our name on the list of the place across the street\". \n\nI'm sorry, but this is San Francisco - brunch is competitive business, especially in nob hill. Your customers are going to shop around for the best brunch experience they can find. Also, if customers are expected to wait over half an hour to give you their business, they should be treated with far more courtesy than that. \n\nI'm disappointed, Olea.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-19", "description": "It's a Friday morning, at 10 am. My friend wanted to try Mama's for her first time but when we arrived, the line was crazy long! Probably 1-1.5 hrs wait..but ain't nobody got time for that! Also, I was on a time-restraint to head to work at 11:30, to the East Bay. (Dam you BART strike!!) Any who, we decided to search for the next closest brunch place with good reviews. It led us to Olea! Olea is about 1-1.5 miles away.\n\nMy friend and I were walking down the block, smelling good food. We were trying to find Olea and we stumbled it at the corner of Larkin & California Street. Olea is half underground with high windows, so it may be hard to find. The entrance was a half door and when you step inside, there are 3 steps of stairs (going down). There are 6-8 tables inside (big and small!..big like a family dining table that can seat up to 8 people and small that can be seated for parties of 2-4..or more if you push the tables together).\n\nThe atmosphere inside the restaurant was nice and cozy. This place was just so cute! The staff is friendly and super attentive. I dropped my fork by accident and as I was picking it up, she was already bringing me a new one! 5 stars for this! The owner seems nice too! He brought out my mimosa for me, and he would check up on us to see if we were enjoying our meal.\n\nNow the food...\nI cannot get over their Olea's Challah Custard Toast with Korintji cinnamon sugar and strawberries, and bacon! (Yes, bacon!) Their menu is small compared to other places but you know what? That's okay! Because their food is amazing! When I had the first bite of french toast inside my mouth, I felt like I was in heaven! The texture is very soft and fluffy, and it felt like it can just melt in your mouth! so that's why I say it's quite heavenly. I love the touch of strawberries to it! This is probably by far the best french toast I've ever had. When I first saw it on the menu, I said \"Dam, $13 for a french toast..This better be worth my money.\" It was definitely worth my money, because it exceeded my expectations. After I finished it, I couldn't stop talking about it..and honestly, I don't think I can! I'm about to rave about it on my instagram, haha. My friend tried my french toast and she loved it too! She didn't like the cinnamon too much but I still think it's good. \n\nYou probably don't expect much from bacon right? Unless you're a bacon fan like me! I asked for a side of bacon and honestly, at first I thought it was a bit over-priced for like 3-4 pieces of bacon for $4.25. Nope, it wasn't over-priced, because the bacon was cooked to PERFECTION. Not over-cooked, and not too crispy or crunch. Just perfect. \n\nMy friend ordered the Cazuela and she liked it. She wasn't expecting what she ordered upon arrival but after trying it, she said it's not bad for a \"hardy breakfast.\" It's like a light chili meal! I had a taste of it and I thought it was alright. The bread that came with it was kinda hard though..at least only the outer layer was. (The crust is hard!) So..I didn't like it too much. \n\nOh, forgot to mention but I had ordered a mimosa (for the first time!) And I'm not really a fan of it..but maybe because I'm not used to it (I did just turn 21 not too long ago). My friend has had mimosa's before and she tried a sip of mine. She said it was alright but she thinks their OJ was too fresh, haha. But I guess it can be a good thing if you order OJ by itself :) \n\nI definitely recommend their Challah Custard French Toast and bacon! They're both delicious and it's just .. perfect! I can't wait to come back here. I was raving about it to one of my other friends and now she wants to try it! Worth the drive across the city for me :) \n\nI live in Hayward for school, so it's a bit far but in the meantime, I'll just reminisce about the food until I can bring more friends here.

I loved Olea, in part because in our quest for finding it, I became best friends with the operator of the California line cable car we were in.  This guy was the NICEST public transportation worker I have ever encountered!  \n\nWe took the cable car to get to the top of Nob Hill, which in itself was one of the great highlights of our trip.  The California line stops right in front of Olea and we got there just when it opened, along with a few other parties who had the same idea.  It's tiny but airy and light-filled and has that same laid back service that we found in most of the restaurants we visited.  \n\nThe orange juice is fresh squeezed-- everything is better in California, we would later reminisce-- and the breakfast food is wonderful.  I had eggs, bacon, and tomato on a rustic roll, which came with a side salad with a light vinaigrette.  I feel like a broken record with my SF reviews, but each individual part was amazing, adding up to an egg on roll that would put any other egg on roll to shame!\n\nHowever!  That's not even the best part.  My sister had the challah custard toast with cinnamon sugar and fresh berries.  We had yet another \"I've never tasted anything like this before\" moment-- the inside of this french toast is literally SILKEN custard.  Silken.  I have NO idea how they accomplish this with simple egg and bread.  It was a huge serving that she couldn't finish and I am happy to report that this still tasted wonderful cold a few hours later, eaten as a snack while strolling the Golden Gate promenade.\n\nIn short: a perfect breakfast in an adorable neighborhood!", "author": "L C."}

I admired the chef owner that started it some years ago and went nearly every Sat. a.m. for breakfast for a few years now. I'd always get the same thing - the egg sandwich and coffee. The way the chef made the eggs was sublime - they were so fluffy and light, just the best egg with crispy bacon you could possibly imagine.\nI haven't been in since the change but decided to try today. I was seated at the long table even though I was in line and should have gotten my own table for 2 as I always did before. I didn't complain so I took the seat but I do not like eating my breakfast less than a foot away from total strangers. Even worse I was at the foot of the table so I was facing this threesome that was probably wondering if I was listening to everything they were saying (I wasn't because I'm hearing impaired). \nThe service was good and attentive, so no complaints there. The eggs were not as good as they were though. They were good but not great. The said diners next to me had the famous french toast and it looked pretty good but I noticed it is not presented as well as it was previously. People still seem to rave about it so undoubtedly the owner trained the new staff on his culinary secrets but regrettably I don't think it's the same.\nI'd go back but will not consider it if I'm seated at the long table again. Maybe I'm the sole loner in the place (it is a great place for couples) but if I stood in line like everyone else I should have the same seating options as everyone else.

Once inside we were immediately greatly very warmly by the owner Phillip who immediately sat us at our table.  I must say that with much trepidation we agreed to come to this restaurant, however, our good friends highly recommended this place and I wanted to vet out the truth behind the negative reviews on this restaurant myself.  In short I have found that the owner Phillip is a genuinely warm soul that truly loves what he does.  His love for his craft comes through in every detail of this fine restaurant.  The staff is exceedingly professional, very polite, very helpful yet non-intrusive to let one savor a fantastic meal at their leisure.  He has selected one of the most masterful chefs that we have experienced at any level.  She is plating up fare with her own interpretation of American Fusion if you will.  The pappardelle meatballs were the most succulent blend of mouth watering pork and beef cooked just right to be moist and savory with a fantastic flavor accented with perfectly prepared spinach mixed into the beautiful presentation.  The scallops were prepared just perfect, stunningly fresh bringing our their true flavor without a heavy sauce to mask their nature.  The waitress suggested that the chef could prepare an off menu side of Swiss chard and I can tell you that this was almost worth the trip by itself.  Fresh and tasty with garlic and carrots with just the right amount of salt to enhance the flavor, just perfect.  They also carry a modest selection of very nice and reasonably priced wines.  In fact, everything on the menu was an exceedingly reasonable price in an arena were you could easily spend more than double!  So dear Yelpers, those of you that crave a hidden gem, that are looking for truly fantastic fare in a setting that not only nourishes your body but your soul at a price that is more than reasonable give Phillip and his staff a try you will not regret it !!!

Even though it wasn't what I was craving at the time, it was still really good.  The spices they used on the pulled pork was fantastic and the fries were good too.

The crowd is fairly casual but the waiters are extreme casual; they wear street clothes so you might not even know who works there at first glance.\n\nTheir signature dishes according to Yelpers are the Cazuela and French toast. The Cazuela is interesting but basically eggs poached in tomato broth with crostinis. It taste as simple as it sounds so nothing stellar here. French toasts were a masterpiece with the nice custard Challah bread. This was magnificent but for $14 it better be the best bread I have ever eaten, even if it is kosher. What disappointed the most was the pulled pork sandwich. It totally lacked flavor and originality. In addition, the juices made the bun soggy so it looked like wet dog that you could not pick up.

The exterior is decorated nicely but maybe some lighting indicating 'open' would help Olea remain in the neighbourhood. \n\nA comfortable, welcoming feel to this place. It reminded me of a family dining room. Maybe Sunday dinner with Aunt Molly? Table manners, good people, familiar conversation, hardwood floor, dark wood table and vase of fresh cut flowers. Some tables for two and a larger one for 8 or 10 in case the neighbors show.  \n\nSemi-open kitchen that told you the chef knew who he was serving (a warm smile and dark eyes above chef whites had greeted us from above the glass as we arrived), but the functionality of the kitchen didn't intrude on my desire to be served & not in the kitchen tonight.  I liked it. \n\nThe glass of Argentinian Melbac was to satisfy a craving tonight, not pair with my yet-unknown order.  So satisfying. Lush, smooth, big without tannins. \n\nPerfectly done flatbread.  Very different presentation with the goat cheese, grilled peaches and greens with oil on the side.  A fun share plate.  Refined flavors.\n\nQuinoa with mushrooms.  My friend ordered.

They had some great vegetarian options.  \n-Most of the staff were very friendly.\n-The fries were the best part of the whole meal.  That is never a good thing though.\n\nThe bad: \n-They only have a sample menu online and the menu items we got were radically different and actually less appealing.\n-Restaurant is TINY!  Make sure you either go early or are prepared to wait outside in the cold.  \n-There is no inside waiting area.  That's how small it is.\n-This place is SO tiny that the cold air filters through quickly when the door is left open.  I recommend requesting a table as far away from the door as possible but again, it's so small that the cold hits everywhere very quickly.  It was just a very uncomfortable experience.\n-Food wasn't all that good considering that people raved about it.  Their specialty was the Fried Egg Cazeula and it was ok but it wasn't as flavorful or savory as everyone said it was.  It was served so hot that I couldn't eat it for at least 10 minutes.  It also cooked the egg too much and it became rather hard in the middle.  I was hoping that the eggs would be runny.  The bread that it was served with was rock hard and combining it with the boiling hot soup, made for a very unpleasant culinary experience.  They served it with grated Parmesan.  This powdery substance ruined the dish.  I would have like to have a fresh Mexican cheese. \n-Got charged $3.75 for tiny rock hard \"bread\" slices with butter enough for 1 person even though there were 4 of us.\n-French toast was just ok.\n-Pulled pork was dry, cole slaw not good.\n\nAfter reviewing my experience, I can not give them more than 2 stars.  When there are other restaurants around that offer a comfortable environment, this place ends of being way below average.

He would not seat her even though I was only half a block away parking (he could see my car from the doorway) and there were open tables & no line.

(10/15/07)\n___\n(10/22/07)  I went last night to the opening party and I am going back for a real meal tonight.  Everything was wonderful!  The decor was homey and inviting. I loved the three steps you had to walk down to get inside.  It gives you a wonderful perspective of the street.\n\nThe food was amazing and although I am sure that all the food served there will not appear on the menu, it really highlighted the chef/owner Gabe's talents.  There were wonderful cheese, flatbreads,  meatballs with roasted tomatoes, back rice with shrimp, and a wonderful steak that melted in your mouth with a peppery olive oil.   Lemon infused chickpeas and escarole crotins finished off the food.  Everything was delicious and I cannot wait to go back tonight and try more.\n___\n(10/22/07)  My sister, my friend D. and I enjoyed dinner here tonight.  We shared a lot of things to get a good sense of what was available.    The menu is small, but varied--and as an added bonus it changes every week. \n\nWe started with an Italian cheese plate (backward in the meal sense but it looked so good--and was!).  \n\nWe proceeded with appetizers of grilled shrimp with black rice and butter bean crostini with arugula.    For our mains, we shared a green bean salad with a citrus vinaigrette, the BEST halibut I have had in my life and a vegan plate with farro, broccoli and walnuts.   Dessert was an amazing cheesecake with layers of vanilla, walnut and chocolate.  The top of the cheesecake was \"bruleed\" and accented with swirls of a blackberry coulis.\n\nWe all drank 3 glasses each of different wines.  The selection is small, but it was nice that it was.  A different change of pace.  \n\nPrices were very reasonable (apps starting at $3.75 and entrees at $9.50).  A very enjoyable evening.

I usually order something savory for brunch, but I decided to order the french toast after reading the reviews on Yelp and I was glad that I did because they were probably one of the best french toasts I've ever had. They were soft yet perfectly toasted; the pear and syrup complemented the french toasts well -- I felt warm fuzzies in my tummy :) \n\nMy vegetarian friend was pleased with their vegetarian option as well. She had an omelete that was light and fluffy. My other friend had the cazuela and that was also a delight. A huge bonus of this place -- they serve Blue Bottle Coffee!! \n\nWhile the food is great, I thought the service somewhat fell short. I asked the waiters to take away my menu three times and they ignored me all three times. I guess I can sympathize since they don't seem to have enough staff to serve a packed restaurant. The brunch was excellent so I'd like to come back another time to try their dinner.", "author": "Melody L."}

The service was slow, the server unknowledgable.  I requested basted eggs as a substitute for the hard boiled eggs.  I think of hard boiled eggs the same way I think of well done steak--you 'can' do it, but you really 'shouldn't'.  The server looked at me like I had a head injury.  She said a little smugly that she didn't know what that was.  I said that I was certain the kitchen would know.  Since they're already frying eggs, it takes very little to squirt water in the pan or on the grill and cover it, instead of frying both sides. It's a pretty standard prep for eggs if you're a restaurant that serves breakfast.  She came back 10 minutes later and informed me that the kitchen doesn't do 'basted eggs'.   It should have been an easy request to accommodate. Seemed a little goofy that they were so inflexible.  When I finally did receive my avocado toast it was uninspiring.  My partner was equally unimpressed with his omelet.  Bland and overpriced.  And although the location and interior of the restaurant should be cozy and welcoming, the staff was cold and impersonal, so I never did feel comfortable.  I was really surprised, but after reading quite a few reviews and the owner's response to those reviews I can see that I wasn't alone.  The owner seems particularly defensive.  Rather than taking constructive criticism and responding accordingly, he seems to think that just saying the word 'organic' is a panacea for an array disappointments.  I think the owner's response to the reviewers reveals something of the character of the restaurant.  Nobody likes criticism, but when people take the time to comment critically, you would do well to listen rather than leave glib retorts or patronizing scolds.", "author": "Fifi L."}

It was nice to visit a restaurant that was not overrun with tourists and had a great local neighborhood vibe.\n\nThe interior was cozy and  very inviting.  Service was friendly and attentive.  I had a light breakfast consisting of yogurt, granola, agave honey, and a mimosa.  My friend raved about her french press coffee and garlic fries.  We were very tempted to make a return visit there just for the coffee.  They change their menu weekly and have a daily fresh bread picked up from a local bakery.

Small corner restaurant in Nob Hill, we were drooling from the wafting aromas emitting as we waited for our party to arrive. And yes, EVERYONE must be present in order to get seated. With only 1 large table, groups larger than 4 or 5 really can be a challenge in this small space. \n\nthe FOOD - yes, agree with yelpers that Challah Custard Toast ($10.75) was delicious. Two thick slices of challah bread are immersed in a vanilla egg milk mixture and then fried or baked to a nice golden brown. Cinnamon and sugar sprinkled across the top, finished with strawberries, made for a very fluffy light french toast. \n\nI complimented my sweet carbs with a side of bacon ($4.75), where I had 5 crisp bacon strips that was plenty to share with the table.\n\nI also had a bite of the Baked Eggs Cazuela ($11.75). Cazuela is a S. American soup which Olea gave its own interpretations to. It was tangy warm and a nice change from the usual brunch items.\n\nBlue Bottle Coffee was nicely served in a french press, your choice of 2 or 4 cups. One downside is that one cannot order coffee while you wait for a table. You must actually be seated to get some morning wake up fuel.\n\nOverall, great food and atmosphere though they are a stickler for rules. Oh, and they don't take AmEx.", "author": "Cindy W."}

We made it a point to show up early so we didn't have any problems getting a table. The food was delicious. The Challah French toast dipped in custard was heavenly!\n\nThe only thing I wasn't impressed with was the service. Our waiter was a bit snobby. Their menu clearly states that they prefer no substitutions, well when one of us asked if another cheese could be substituted for parmesan in the cazuela dish the waiter said, \"No.\" There was no explanation or politeness. I realize that certain dishes make substitutions more difficult than others, but he simply needed to politely state that rather than reply indignantly. \n\nThe other thing was that it was quite a chilly day and we were seated close to the door which was open we were seated. We were all quite frigid and asked the waiter if he would mind closing the door. He said sure, then proceeded to walk away and do several other things. We ended up just closing it ourselves, but were a bit peeved by the overall lack of politeness. Lastly throughout the meal several members of our party got up to go to the restroom. Well after we had all finished eating my dad went to the restroom and the waiter came over to fold his napkin. Weird. I'm all for folding napkins when people leave the table, but be consistent.

Well in my experience that's almost never a good idea. And this was no exception. \n\nI had the eggs baked in a cazuela (a pot) with basque style tomato sauce and spanish chorizo. Now, I can't say for sure what did it but it smelled and tasted like vomit. Sorry, graphic I know, but seriously it was absolutely disgusting. And this seems to be their featured dish. Don't order it.

I tried the omelet w/ kale, leeks, butternut squash and feta (the host mentioned that most omelets won't be repeated until the next season because the chefs like to get creative with different seasonal veggies each week).

I was a bit indignant about how small the pour was and that my big earthy red came in a small chardonnay wine glass.\n\n-1 for small portions for how high the price is.  Sure it is tasty but everything on the menu should be reduced by about $3-$4.  We would have spent the same amount on dinner had the prices been more reasonable but we would have left without feeling cheated...and hungry.\n(and they don't serve bread which would have helped fill up my big hungry boy and he would have complained less about not getting enough to eat)\n\nI hate to give a low review to such a cute place with good food prepared so skillfully.

I came here with a friend for Sunday brunch and it was a delightful experience.  My friend is a regular here and knows everyone.

It has good lighting, a nice open kitchen, small tables, a few plants, and a large shared table.  I don't know if they have wifi here, but if they do I would like to come here to do work and hang out.\n\nI noticed a wall of lovely wine and champagne glassware on the side wall, which is a nice addition.  While I didn't have wine, next time I will.  I did not notice a wine list on the menu, so I recommend presenting one to extend the bottom line for this restaurant.\n\nWhile we did not have wine, we did have a fresh squeezed orange juice and a french press of Blue Bottle coffee.  Nob Hillers, come here for your Blue Bottle coffee fix.  Also, the fresh squeezed oj is among the best I have had in San Francisco.  Olea, what kind of oranges are you squeezing?\n\nOur meal was a flat omelette with shreds of pepper, a wheat grain, avocado, and cheese.  The food was very light and incorporated a combination of subtle flavors.  If I had to describe the food here in one word, I would describe it as subtle.  \n\nThe menu here changes a bit every week, although I believe there are a few standard items.  I noticed a neighbor eating an egg dish with tortilla chips in it which I will have to try next time.  We also had crispy fries, which are like the fries they have in France.  Thin and slightly crispy.  Olea, will you consider making mussels so I can have Moules Frites with you?\n\nA great experience.  Everyone here is so friendly.  I want to be a regular here.

The kitchen is in plain sight and you can see all the delicious food being prepped nearby.  It's a proper neighborhood restaraunt, and doesn't try to be something larger and more grand.  It's simple, clean, and really well done.\n\nFirst courses, salad with beets.  Simple, light, tasty and very refreshing.  Flatbread with ricotta, pears, and spinach/endive.  The flatbread was crisp, salty, tasty, and paired well with all of the components above.  The ricotta and pears worked really well together, the spinach/endive was less successful in my opinion, but I'm not a big fan of either ingredient to begin with, so that would make sense.\n\nMain course was duck.  Nicely seared, thick coated, sitting on top of a pile of couscous, corn, and mushrooms.  While I'm not typically a fan of couscous and mushrooms, they played really well together.  The duck was surprisingly sweet, and perfectly cooked and tender.   Sadly, the chef told me it was the last night he was preparing this item in this fashion (and being the last dish of the night, it was the last preparation of his duck in that format), but I'm sure if he's looking to improve upon this, it will be pretty solid in the future as well.\n\nFor a shot of the duck course, see Flickr - http://www.flickr.com/photos/swnktstic/4045020848/\n\nSadly, didn't have time for dessert, but Blue Bottle coffee is served here, so plus one there too.

The restaurant space is pretty tiny, the door resembles the portal from Being John Malkovich, and the selection of food is meticulously local and seasonal. It looks like a neighborhood spot featuring a menu with city-wide appeal. \n\nWe went for brunch this morning, but I'm sure we'll be back for dinner since we just moved to Nob Hill. Boyfriend got the french toast (per my recommendation, per Yelpers' recommendations) and I got a flat omelet with fingerling potatoes, dandelion greens, onions, and pecorino cheese. We also got sides of toast and bacon, french press coffee, and bf got the fresh orange juice.\n\nCan I just say... the french toast was phenomenal. I'm tempted to use expletives to convey my zealous lust for this \"custard toast,\" but I think you'll get the drift with g-rated language. It was sinful, perfect, and absolutely incomparable with most french toast on earth. It is by no means good for you (I think -I KNOW- I've had healthier desserts), which is why I let my boyfriend order it, but HOLY crap is it worth the calories. I'm not sure I'd ever get it for myself because I'd likely polish off an entire order, but if someone is willing to split I say \"do it!\" Do it.\n\nFlat omelet was good... it reminded me of something a chef would make himself for breakfast. In comparison to the french toast, it was just alright, but that's not really a fair comparison. Especially because it's so much better for you and not covered in cinnamon-sugar. \n\nAlso, the side of toast is really cute... as opposed to most breakfast places that give you 2 pieces of toasted bread, it's sort of like a bread basket at dinner. There were 2 types of bread (challah and something else like sourdough) lightly toasted served with butter and jam on the plate.", "author": "Amanda C."}

It seemed like a 'special occasion' place for dinner so J and I finally went in tonight to celebrate our anniversary.  \n\nWhere to begin?  The place is rather small, with a cozy feel, not like a big impersonal restaurant.  The food changes seasonally, and presumably this is why its just so incredible.  Clearly these folks also get an organic box delivered!  Everything was incredibly fresh and delightfully yet lightly seasoned.\n\nI had the halibut, J had clams.  In-fucking-credible.  Seriously, even the chickpeas, radish and cucumber garnishing the fish were delicious.  And I don't even like radish!  Every element seemed to be perfectly placed, and prepared with such care as to render the meal no less than exquisite.  Truly amazing.  \n\nI must caution you that I am a grad student and do not usually spend this much on dinner, so perhaps not having been a party to much truly amazing food, my awe is explained.  But in awe I was, truly, amazing food.  \n\nThe dessert was beyond words.  A rich chocolate mousse with a sprinkling of sea salt and fresh raspberries.  I thought that it was like good German chocolate died and went to heaven to be crowned by wings and a halo, while J argued that it was more akin to the pure and perfect soul of German chocolate unsullied by sin.  Whatever it was, it was pure delight.  \n\nI love the setup, its very intimate and the magic happens in the little kitchen just beyond the tables.  The place is set slightly below the sidewalk, you walk down a set of stairs to enter.  In all the effect was one of being transported (or maybe that was the wine?) to another land where flavors perfectly complement each other and each element is urged to share its own subtle and unique being.  \n\nSince when did I care what a chick-pea tasted like? Since now that I know of the genius that results when the magic happens.", "author": "RJ M."}

Both times I was ravishingly hungry and both times I left a teensy bit disappointed.  \n\nThe first visit I had some veggie-egg dish that was delicious, but left me wanting more and having none.  Although it may not have been possible to completely satisfy my oversized appetite (thank you, munchies), I was sure I could get close enough to full that I could forgo second-breakfast.  Unfortunately, Olea couldn't do it for me this time around.\n\nThe second visit had some high and low points.  \nHigh Point: Blue Bottle Coffee...absolute perfection\n\nLow Point: My friend and I were sat behind a pillar and it took our server waaaay too long to notice us.  Don't get me wrong, I'm down with the privacy that a giant cement column affords me, but please be sure to peak in every once in a while to, oh I don't know, TAKE MY ORDER.\n\nMid Point:  I, too, had the Challah Toast and, at first, it completely changed my perspective on french toast (a dish which usually leaves me feeling more thirsty than necessary).  Theirs struck a flawless balance of moisture- not too soggy, not too dry.  So why the mediocre mark, you ask...  Part way through the meal, I was so overloaded on sweetness that it became nearly a chore to finish.  I so wished I had a small bite of a savory ANYTHING to counter the utter richness.  I guess sweets for breaky isn't my thing...", "author": "Christy F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-01-13", "description": "If you're planning on going, go soon.  This place has a flaws that I don't think will get settled soon enough to save it.\n\nI really wanted to like this place.  Their general idea is exactly what should be the next phase in SF restauranting: well prepared modern food at (almost) moderate prices.  The Nob Hill Grille has started this route and is pulling it off: I was excited to think we'd have a second in the neighborhood.\n\nFirst, the menu is off-putting. Once you get past its clumsy layout (no capitol letters- Wow! Edgy! Or rather: wow! edgy!) then comes the problem of not knowing the preparation of the dishes.  Was the Steelhead poached, broiled, or seared?  Who knows?  Past that, the dishes just didn't sound all that appetizing.  \"Duck breast and vanilla poached quince slices.\"  Is the duck breast poached too?  What's the seasoning?  Is there something to contrast the vanilla, an odd choice for savory dishes, one that almost always fails. \n\nEach dish we had misfired on some level.  The ricotta cheese and flatbread dish would have been delightful if not for the cold, under roasted grapes.  This dish needed acid and punch to wake it up, not sweet and floral.  The mixed greens salad was good but over priced at $8.50.  It's still just a mixed greens salad. The scallops were greatly overpriced at $14.50 for three small scallops on undercooked, hard chick peas.  The steak was smallish and served awkwardly by itself with a small pile of veg on the other side of the plate with a ramekin of mostly oil salsa verde to pour on yourself.  The plating style is that sparse, separated look which works well in cookbooks and magazines, not so much in real life.  The squash and potatoes with the steak were wonderful, but looked pitiful and small by itself.\n\nObviously, the place is too focused of its food-cost and not focused enough on creating the impressions of value and satisfaction, the cornerstones of being a moderately priced eatery.  And, actually, we spent $40 a person for three courses, which qualifies as \"spendy\" and not \"moderate\" according to the scale at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe service was competent even if the server was a condescending putz.  Our table was made up of  professionals, thirty-five to forty-three, all experienced diners who did not need a teenager treating us like we just got off the turnip truck.  He actually said to us, \"Our dessert tonight is a Gateau Breton.  Are you familiar?\"  Good service does not include a pop quiz that can only embarrass or insult  the customer.\n\nWe went elsewhere for dessert.  Discussing our meal, up popped phrases like \"learn to walk before you run\" and \"style trumping substance.\"  This conflicts with the positive comments others have written here, I know.  But, the crowd I see each night as I walk by is made up of non-neighborhood people and they aren't enough to support a \"neighborhood\" restaurant.  Ask Harvey's, or Zare, or Red Door, or King's Cafe . . . you get the idea.", "author": "Christopher S."}

As many of us know, costume generally equals getting drunk and making an ass out of yourself, which is generally pretty fun, but Kathy is in a yoga teacher training program on the weekends and she is trying hard to be good.\n\nI suggested dinner at Olea, a new Mediterranean place in Nob Hill. I had been to the opening party, which was thoroughly enjoyable, and I wanted to go back and try the food for reals. \n\nOlea is one of those places that feels like it's giving you a hug when you walk in. The decor is inviting and stylish, great for a casual friendly dinner and could also work well for a romantic date. We ordered the green bean salad, which was good, though it could have used a bit more of a bite- maybe more lemon or garlic. It was served with a nice piece of cheese that livened up the flavor considerably. We also had the green olives and flatbread. The olives were mild and fruity, the flatbread crisp and salty. It was a good combination. We shared the vegan entree, which was farro with broccoli and walnuts and was superb. It was served with a delicious peppery, savory sauce on it. The wine list has some interesting selections. The malbec I ordered ($8.50/glass) was perfect with the food and everything a good malbec should be- smooth and subtle.\n\nSadly, we were too full for dessert and Kathy had to get going so she could get into her slutty German beer girl costume (yes, she did!) and go to not one but \"several\" Halloween parties.

Twice in a few weeks, we chose to order the vegan dish and I even took some home, as I was more than satisfied with the incredibly fresh ingredients, brilliant combination of tastes, and impeccable seasonings.The chef, Gabriel, is talented, has a subtle  touch, and his kitchen is discreetly quiet, tho it is open to the dining room, no kitchen noises intrude on your dining experience. The wait person Ryan was friendly, caring, and totally knowledgeable about each menu item.\n\nI look forward to going  for brunch this coming weekend...run, don't walk to this incredibly special spot in a city of many interesting dining choices...you will be pleasantly surprised.", "author": "Kay H."}

After being awed with the Chihuly exhibit at the de Young, Mom and I were very hungry.  The parking karma gods were in full effect that day and there was no wait, so we were seated immediately.  \n\nWe shared the Challah French Toast with fresh fruit and the egg dish baked in a cazuela.  Absolutely heavenly.  Later that evening, I lamented the fact that I didn't have the Olea chef in my apartment to make me more french toast.  I could have inhaled it, it was so good.\n\nI'd already had plenty of Blue Bottle coffee from the kiosk in Hayes Valley, so no coffee.    I was very tempted though.  Any restaurant that serves Blue Bottle is a winner in my book.\n\nOne of the co-owners, Glen, came by to make sure that we were pleased with our meal.  I love personal touches like that.\n\nThe interior is tiny, but beautifully furnished and decorated.  Even the vintage desk where our efficient server entered our meal choices was gorgeous.\n\nNext time, I'll definitely get more french toast to go.

It was a bit uneventful and needed doses of crushed pepper and sea salt.. \n\nI'll give this cute place another shot to satisfy my taste buds, since everything else seemed so good & service was friendly.. upon seeing all the other reviews, I think the french toast might give me what I'm looking for.", "author": "Tammy S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-01-13", "description": "To say that I was not impressed by Olea is an understatement.  First the \"OK\":\nThe food.  \nIt was just \"OK\".  To read some of the reviews here on Yelp I would have expected a gourmet wonderland that left me gasping for air on the shores of an ocean of gastronomic delight.  But no.  It was \"OK\".  Nothing exciting, nothing remarkable.  Just \"OK\".  The food was cooked \"OK\", and the flavors were \"OK\".  \n\nNow for the \"not so OK\":\nPretension:\nThe whole restaurant reeked of pretentious assiness.  From the wait staff to some of the customers, I was just plain annoyed by the level of \"look at me\" and \"I am so cool\" that seemed to pervade the place.  Hint to wait staff:  Don't try to make cake sound overly fancy by calling it \"Gateau\" and affecting an air of \"I am cool because I can use a French word and I must school you in cooking.\"  Desert was slightly less than \"OK\" as the cake was not so fresh and had a hockey-puck-like consistency.\n\nPhysical atmosphere:\nIt's a cute space, albeit a tad small (it's San Francisco, what can you do).  It was overly warm in the restaurant and at one point in the night apparently there was a mishap with one dish which quickly filled the restaurant with a heavy burnt smell, opening the front door for a few minutes would have cleared it out but apparently no one thought to do that.  Hint:  Fix your range hoods.  The little fans in the windows don't really cut it.\n\nPlating:\nEither get smaller plates or give bigger portions.  While I disagree with one of my companions on the size of the meat portion on the plate, I do agree that sides like fingerling potato's and squash etc are cheap and more of them would have gone a long way to making the plate look \"fuller\" without substantially increasing plate cost.\n\nPrice:\nFor the plate size and the food being \"OK\" at about $40 per person (without drinks) it's a bit high.  $14 for three rather small scallops on a bed of stuff (can't remember what it was outside of blood oranges) and then $17 for the undersized (when viewed on the large plate) hanger steak it should be more than just \"OK.\"\n\nWill I go back?  Honestly?  Probably not.  Sorry Olea, but I believe strongly in first impressions and as I said at the start of this review, I was not impressed.", "author": "Matt E."}

Olea happens to do this combo insanely well.\n\nThe challah french toast is amazing.  I prefer it to the french toast at Mama's, which is saying a lot.  It's a big portion, it's cooked and garnished appropriately, and it's oh-so-good.\n\nMy side of bacon wasn't crazy good, but it was certainly a cut above your run-of-the-mill bacon, and they gave a sizable amount.  It was cooked right, firm but not burnt to a crisp.\n\nAnd the coffee, served in a french press, was the perfect compliment to this meal.  For some, this might not be ideal, as not everyone likes the the french press.  But good coffee is good coffee, whether it's press or drip, and they serve good coffee here.\n\nPrices were reasonable, service was good, and the decor/atmosphere was pleasant.

I have to admit our waiter may be right when he said they had the best french toast in San Francisco. Perfectly moist with just the right amount of sweetness. There was no wait for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and the prices are reasonable (brunch items averaging about $11-12). I was also excited to see that they serve coffee from the Blue Bottle Coffee Company. Blue Bottle is known as the \"Microroasters of organic and shade grown coffee\". The coffee came in a french press for either 2 cups or 4 cups. The meal was very pleasant the the staff is extremeley attentive and friendly.

When it happens, you can only hope that the next business to open in the same spot is a deserving successor. Maybe this is why some seemingly prime locations seem to be cursed - a favorite business shuts down, and then the locals eye each successive venture with suspicion, giving the owners the stink-eye at every opportunity and generally spreading ill will about the place.\n\nIn this case, I'm talking about the Red Door Cafe. It was a humble and charming place, with mismatching furniture and chipped pottery, but it was one of my favorite breakfast spots in the city because the food was good, parking spaces were generally plentiful, and I never had to contend with a line stretching around the block (rare in this city when you're talking about good breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday morning).\n\nAnyway, this is a long way of introducing Olea, the successor to the Red Door. What it lacks in the Red Door's humility and charm, it more than makes up for with an obvious dedication to the fine details of breakfastry.\n\nThe menu is small and changes weekly - a thing I always love. The coffee is served in a French press for two or four people, and this is always a reliable way to make very good coffee. Juices are fresh squeezed. The bread and other baked items are fantastic, and the main courses are carefully crafted and perfectly prepared.\n\nAs a bonus, parking is still pretty easy, and there's not usually any line at all.", "author": "Shawn S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-23", "description": "We had brunch at Olea this past Saturday & really enjoyed it. \n\nWAIT: There was none. We ended up getting there before they opened at 9:30 because we were unsure of how crazy the line would be (last week's trip to Brenda scarred us, I guess). Turns out there was no line... in fact, they were still seating people immediately when we left about 10:30.\n\nFOOD: The wife and I shared two dishes. The challah French toast was quite possibly the best French toast I've ever had in my life (wife agreed). It was sweet, but not overly so, and had a delicious custardy inside. I'm salivating thinking about it! The eggs baked in a cazuela were fairly tasty, but needed a bit of salt (better under-salted than over-salted, of course). Also, I wish the \"stew\" part had been a bit thicker... it was more like chicken soup with poached eggs than what I had imagined. The coffee in a press and fresh-squeezed orange juice were great!\n\nAMBIENCE: It's an adorable little space. It was getting close to full by the time we left, but the noise volume was not at all painful (again I show my scars from Brenda's).\n\nSERVICE: Mostly good, with a few misses. On the plus side, our waitress was friendly, attentive, and efficient. The first miss was that they didn't let us in until about 9:35--we and another couple were waiting outside in the cold, windy morning & it would've been nice if they had opened the doors a tad early (or at least on time!). \n\nThe second miss didn't affect us directly, but I'll relate it here in the hopes of encouraging the staff at Olea to be a little more flexible. After they finally opened the door, the wife and I snagged the 2-top farthest from the door, and the other couple went to sit at a 3-top even farther from the door. One of the staff asked them to choose one of the 2-tops, which would be reasonable if they were at all busy, but they weren't. So the other couple somewhat reluctantly sat at one of the remaining 2-tops closer to the *open* front door. Of course, like 15 minutes later, the 2-tops were all full and the host promptly sat two people at that same 3-top. So it was kinda dumb to hassle the couple who showed up early and waited in the frickin' cold.\n\nThe last miss was that our waitress helpfully brought us a couple of plates to help split the food, but one had old cheese stuck to it, which was gross (it was stacked under a clean plate, so she didn't see it).\n\nOVERALL: A delicious and (mostly) pleasant experience. With 2 entrees, small coffee press, and small juice, it was $42 with tax and tip. We'll definitely go back sometime to see what other yumminess the chef has whipped up.", "author": "James K."}

Olea did not disappoint!  While in SF for leisure, having read the rave reviews, we checked it out for a Friday morning breakfast, making sure to arrive promptly upon opening at 10am.  The first ones there, we were greeted warmly and seated by one of the many windows which makes the daylight basement location seem inviting.  Soon all of the tables were full, and the scene was in full swing.  We had the baked eggs special-of-the-house and the pulled pork, which they graciously agreed to serve without the bun (there are no substitutions as a house rule).

Nothing as perfect as a cup of french pressed in the morning with the full pure flavor and aroma of great coffee with the glisten of the bean oil floating faintly on the surface.  mmm mmm mmm - heavenly.  I am just a breath away on this side of the thin veil of imagination of being able to really smell it.  It's lingering in my mind no doubt.  \n\nThe space is on the (super) small side but if you are patient or can get right in, jump on it.  This is truly a cute little gem of a joint with a super simple menu and very fresh fresh fresh ingredients.  Not to be passed by.  I spyed the dinner menu and really want to swing by one evening to give it a sampling.  I am suspecting there won't be any disappointment. \n\nThe menu (both brunch and dinner) was nice and simple and straight up.  Nice friendly service and considering the space, they were very mindful of not being too in your face every second.", "author": "Kathleen K."}

Came here for brunch, and this place was adorable in its 6 table glory.  But sadly, the food was nothing great.  I had their special \"cazuela.\"  This tomato based egg dish with pulled pork.  It was different and that made it special.  However, the general lack of salt was just unacceptable.  It had more of a tomato soup esque thing happening.  Sadly, the dish made me sad.  It also came w/ two crostinis.. which just isn't enough.  So when my friend asked for more (she ordered the same thing), the lady then gave us an order of various toast, which also came with just 1 crostini.  So fail on that.  But I guess we got some challah toast.\n\nMy other friend had the omelet, that seemed ok. She ate most of it.  The menu changes weekly, so maybe this was an off week for them.\n\nI will say their french fries were perfectly crisped.  Sadness, would I be back?  Maybe not.  With so many great places to eat, why give it another chance.\n\nOn the side note, the french toast looked like the popular thing to order.

I may go back to check it out, but if they mess up again I'm out.\n\nThe menu is VERY limited, and the choices aren't logical.  So they had 2 shellfish apps, 2 vegetarian apps, and not much else.  For entrees they had a vegan dish, a pork dish, a duck dish, a burger, and a cod dish.  The duck dish was out by the time we got there for our reservations at 8.  It was the only dish that looked good.\n\nAlready disappointed, my boyfriend and I shared the burger and the scallops app, our companions had the cod and the pulled pork.  The pulled pork was boring...just pork on polenta, neither of which were that good, and nothing else.  The cod was okay.  The burger was nice, but tiny on a huge bun.  It just didn't work.  Who doesn't offer poultry other than game?  What if I kept kosher but needed meat?  I'd be screwed if the duck was gone and I didn't want a $15 burger that wouldn't fill me up.\n\nThe service was weird.  The guy would come over and bring us something, turn around, and literally turn right back around in two seconds and ask us how it was.

I came here last weekend with 6 others, half of whom don't live in the city, and it was the perfect San Franciscan spot  to enjoy - its local, seasonal, sustainable bit was perfectly indicative of why I love our restaurants here.\n\nGiven the quality of the food, it was so refreshing to be in an uncrowded, quiet setting on a Saturday night. We took up the communal table, and there were only another 3 parties of 2 the entire night. Actually, for such a charming place, I sort of wished they had more diners!\n\nI had a spectacular short rib over a bed of polenta. The two ribs were huge pieces and fell off the bone. They were fork tender and quite flavorful. I usually don't like polenta, but there was something so buttery about this one that I nearly finished it off. The sugar snap peas on the side were a bit soggy and seemed like an afterthought, but that's ok because I looked at it more as a pretty green garnish. \n\nOur table ordered the Syrah and prosecco, both of which was just lovely. Oh, and backtracking - we were served warm bread to start (warm! I love that touch) with a nice olive oil. \n\nThe service was wonderful as well - our server was Ryan (well, the only server on duty that night) and he was very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive to our table. I think I liked him even more because he knew the wine maker of my favorite winery.\n\nWhy 4 stars? Well, for one I'm trying not to give all my Yelp reviews blanket 5 stars. The final tab was on the pricier end. I also wasn't completely in love with my appetizer, a mushroom flatbread, although I do recognize that may be because I'm a soft and chewy person rather than a crispy...and uh, flat...person. And, nothing in the dessert selection really blew any of us away, so we opted out of dessert.\n\nAnyway, all in all, I highly recommend Olea. It's a good date spot too, for those of you looking for one. I can't wait to try it for brunch!", "author": "serena l."}

As an appetizer, this would have satiated me with its simplicity, bit the quail centerpiece offered little to be excited about in its little quail frame.  It was a little too reminiscent of chicken and was seasoned in a way that remind me of reasonably good chicken legs from the oven, though not the kind of potent flavor that makes you cherish every little bite.\n\nMy friend's yellowtail ($18.5) was the opposite.  The three pieces of yellowtail were scrumptious.  The meat was flaky and tender and well seasoned, but quite small.  This would have been OK if they were paired with something tasty, but instead they weren't on a bed of black eyed peas that were far from fergilicious.  While they had a very thin and earthy sauce, they never let you forget \"we're beans, only beans, don't expect too much\".\n\nThe menu changes often which means that next time my options will probably be different and hopefully better, though with only five entrees, being disappointed in two is not the best of records.\n\nThe waiter was charming and knowledgeable about the food and wine and recommended the Syrah ($9), which was smooth and slightly chocolatey, though a little flabby.  We also ordered the three layer cheesecake ($8) dessert which was more enjoyable and an interesting take on cheesecake, which though it can come in 50 flavors, somehow always feels too familiar.\n\nI will probably be back because this place is so close to a friend's place, but if dining were like speed dating, Olea would inevitably have to be cut.  We'll see on visit number 2.\n\nAnd if you don't go to the TenderNob/lower Polk area much, allocate a lot of time for parking.", "author": "Tom W."}

Went to Olea for brunch yesterday and found it to be a nice venue for a good Sunday meal but not an amazing one, but still pretty good.  \n\nWe got there right at 12:30 and despite the rain, not surprisingly, SF folks were still having brunch, and every table was taken.  When we got there, there was only one guy ahead of us on the waitlist and then we put our names down for 3 (2 of us were there and another friend was on his way) after his.  While we were waiting for a table to open up, more people trickled in and got their names on the list after our's.  Still the friend we were waiting for hadn't made it in as he was making rounds in the neighborhood looking for parking.  During this 20-30 minute period approximately 3 to 4 parties that came in after us, were seated and we were passed b/c our friend was not in, though we did inform the host that he was nearby, but just looking for parking.  The host was very nice but still did not seat us.  At a few mins before 1:00, when our friend made it in, we still waited and had not been given a table yet.  We started to walk out at I think 1:10 to go somewhere where the wait wasn't as long, but the host stopped us (again, just want to say that he was very polite) and said a table was paying and we would be seated immediately.  \n\nI wanted to mention this in case you ever go to Olea and do not have your party all together, you can expect to wait.  With that said, here's something about the service and food, both of which were great.\n\nI got the eggs baked in a casuela vessel, which comes w/sausage.  Since I'm vegetarian, they were cool about substituting the sausage w/potatoes.  The tomato stew tasted alright and it came with three small crisp baguettes.  I liked my dish, but it wasn't that filling and by the time I got home, was still hungry so I ended up snacking on stuff I had in the fridge.  My friend on the other hand, ordered probably THE best French toast (and really fattening!) any of us had ever tasted.  It basically was like a cinnamon roll covered in the most mouthwatering maple syrup, it was insane.  He got protective of his food (understandably so!) and only let us each steal a bite.  My other friend got a burger and fries and seemed to be happy w/his order.  Our waitress was slammed but was great about checking in w/us and was very friendly.\n\nI would say this place is ideal to go to if you live in the neighborhood (I don't), but not a place I personally would go out of my way to eat at otherwise.  Good service, atmosphere, and overall vibe though.", "author": "Swetha G."}

Their emphasis on local products is laudable, but what will keep me going back is the quality of the food.  The flatbread is really good--strong flavors, a nice contrast in textures.  Unfortunately, the smallness of the portion is magnified by how good it is.  I've also had a shrimp starter that offers an unusual combination of savory grilling paired against fresh heirloom tomatoes.  Their short ribs are great, but I preferred their black cod, which was cooked just right.  \n\nStaff and guests are very friendly.  I like it when table neighbors are chatting with each other and staff periodically join the conversation.  With only 25 seats, the space is intimate, not cramped.  I expected it to be a bit noisy, but it's not--so if you're looking for a place where you can chat with your companions, consider this place.", "author": "QuodE D."}

My meal - luke-warm, half-cooked noodles with a suspect medly of crushed baby carrots and overcooked kale- was unpleasant. But the arrogance of the owner was astonishing. He decided to give our table an unsolicited lecture on how he was putting money back into his precious food, wine, and servers by refusing to split more than 2 credit cards and sacrifice $0.50/card/transaction. Nevermind the significant and totally avoidable inconvenience this causes a group of customers that don't tend to carry around exact change or lots of bills. Someone should remind this pretentious fellow that it's the customers that ensure he has a business to worry about in the first place. Customers don't eat out at fancy restaurants so they have the pleasure of being insulted. For what's worth, he's lost my business forever and I'll encourage everyone I know to avoid Olea, its mediocre and overpriced food, and above all, its wretched customer experience. I'm pretty sure that the lost CLV will exceed the savings associated with his two-card-only policy.", "author": "N H."}

Love this place from top to bottom.\n\nSeamless service started quickly, but courteously, as our waters were  filled by the back-waiter while our server took our order for  Blue Bottle lattes, freshly squeezed orange juice mimosas, and a beer. The server was well versed in the menu and did a great job of describing and recommending items from the menu that changes with whatever is fresh and in season. He also described the beer that I ordered in perfect detail. Our food arrived in what felt like a very appropriate amount of time, not diner fast, not annoying slow. In fact, everything in this meal was so on point that I found myself more focused on the feeling of ease and pleasure than feeling annoyed by things not being done well, and my need to diagnose the situation and then rant to my friends about what's wrong. (haha, I've been working in the food industry from a long time now, maybe too long.) Olea in this case was the opposite of that. My pulled pork sandwich was more delicate that in your face. The flavors less aggressive and intense, than they were refreshing and uplifting. Fresh shredded carrots and cilantro added a sweet and aromatic touch to the pork that was perfectly dressed so that I could still taste and appreciate the flavor of the meat. My friends had the soft boiled eggs with ham and blue lake beans, and a mildly spicy red sauce the topped it off. Deliciously rich without being too much. Yum. Another one of my friends had the vegetarian omelet with feta, kale, and something else that I can't recall. The omelet, just like all of the other portions was perfectly satisfying, without making anyone feel gluttonous. Oh, one last thing about the food, The FRIES were perfection. Perfectly salted, perfectly crispy, perfectly natural, just perfect. This was by far one of the best overall experiences that I have had dinning out in recent memory.", "author": "Nolan W."}

Here's what I had on one of my recent visits.\n\nAppetizers: I had the grilled sardines over pickled onions and garbanzo beans and it was soooo good. This was my first time having fresh sardines and to my surprise I liked it and they were large.  My friend started with a mixed green salad with kumquats and goat cheese. The  greens were very fresh and the combination of flavors were yummy to my surprise.\n\nEntree: I had the hamburger that was thick and juicy and simply delicious....but wait the fries are to die for! It seems like they worked out the hamburger kinks. My friend had the lamp chops and they were cooked to a medium rare perfection. The serving was not small at all as one reviewer mentioned. I also don't get why some people feel that the portions are small here because we both found them to be just right as it allowed us to enjoy several items on the menu. Perhaps these diners are looking for a place that they normally find on Polk street? Go figure......what I say is check it out for yourself and make your own decision. I think you'll leave satisfied and not stuffed but feeling just right.\n\nDessert: Many of other yelp reviewers said they loved the three layered cheesecake so we decided to share that and they were right. We are not huge fans of cheesecake but this one is delicious. We loved it!  I was surprised to see that they also sell the blue bottle whole beans.\n\nSo my main points about Olea is that it's a very casual place, great service with food that is not over seasoned and simply delicious. I would recommend Olea and will definitely return to see what's new on the menu. I hear that brunch is good too so I'll have to try that soon.", "author": "Mary C."}

The french-press coffee is outstanding - rich and full of flavor, it doesn't even need sugar.\n\nI've eaten at Dottie's for breakfast on more than one occasion, and I would definitely put Olea into their category. Let me qualify this though, Olea does what it does extremely well. Dottie's has more variety and is the type of meal that you have to take a nap and leaves you very full and satisfied in the way mom used to make. After you eat at Olea, you will be able to walk home, and not have the waiter roll you out of the restaurant.\n\nI would definitely recommend the french toast, I always end the meal with it. The challah bread that's used is a perfect choice. Since it's a custard variation on French toast, you get all the richness of the flavor, yet the bread doesn't fall apart, whilst the korinjinti cinnamon matures the sweet enough that you can even use maple syrup (sparingly).\n\nAnother dish that's always good is the niman ranch hamburger. I wanted to try everything on the menu, however, once I tried the burger, it was kind of hard for me to do anything else.\n\nThe omelets can be excellent or so-so. I'm not found of the cazuela eggs, a bit too little for my appetite. It has its charm, but there's something missing, can't quite put my finger on it.\n\nI've also been to dinner, which is not as outstanding as breakfast. This is mostly due to the lack of variety from week to week as well as the portions are modest.\n\nIf you're going to come here, get in line and go on the weekend, you'll be glad you did.", "author": "Adrian J."}

The menu changes weekly, but this week it included: roasted scallops with sliced beets in lemon sauce, grilled shrimp over riso venere, pan seared cod with escarole, marinated olives with flatbread, slowly roasted pork shoulder over polenta, and -- a vegan dish -- butternut squash over farro. And for dessert? Slices of grapefruit with local honey, artesian cheese plate, or chocolate walnut cheese cake!\n\nThe only thing to keep in mind is that everything about this place is small. The menu is tiny (5 appetizers, 5 entrees, 3 desserts). The portions are small which, while incredibly refreshing and unusual, means you will probably need to order an appetizer to satisfy a healthy appetite. You know what else is small, though? The prices! They are surprisingly reasonable for the high quality of food you get.\n\nEven the food itself has a very simple (small?) taste. No overpowering flavors. No over-seasoning. Just light, fresh, and subtle.\n\nFrankly, I really loved the reigned-in self-control this inspires. There's no over-eating and stuffing yourself here. The menu feels very carefully chosen and so, when you are eating here, you feel welcome to take your time and enjoy the moderation. \n\nAnother big bonus point is the fact that everything is available for takeout (Really! High-end food to go!!), and a very nice little wine selection.\n\nSo, what I'm saying is, if your looking for a simple, fresh, tasty, comforting meal Olea is definitely the place to go.

I tried the pan-seared duck breast, which was cooked too perfection.  The meat was tender without being raw; the seasoning was flavorful and contrasted nicely with the duck and japonica rice.  They must have ran out of the asparagus, because my plate came out with oven-roasted brussel sprouts instead, which were a little on the bitter side (unless you properly core brussel sprouts, parboil and then bake with salt and pepper, you're gonna get bitter brussels sprouts....just saying).  My partner had the pollock, which wasn't anything spectacular in my opinion, but tasted fresh and tender.  The orange cornmeal cake we shared for dessert was also good, but nothing that was too out of the ordinary--cornmeal is not quite my cup of tea, but the orange flavor provided a nice contrast and so what you end up noticing is that the cake has a different consistency than if made with purely flour....meh\n\nAs for the service, the waitress and the host are incredibly sweet and will chat you up about anything.

A friend and I came here on a Saturday afternoon right before the brunch was over at 2:15, so getting a table was no problem. That's usually not the case, I hear. Anyway, the menu was odd... It changes frequently, I was told, but I had a really hard time picking anything that sounded good. Finally, I settled... yes... settled on \"Eggs in Cazuela\" or something like that. I asked a very nice waiter what that meant, and his description majorly failed as I basically got egg soup, the sight of which almost made me sick. Now, I am an adventurous eater, but I just couldn't do it. I am one of those people who is barely comfortable with \"sunny-side-up\" eggs even though I can do Eggs Benedict with not problem. Yes, maybe I should have told that to the waiter, but NOTHING in the menu or his description alarmed me. Fine. The server was very nice and took the dish away. I felt weird asking, but he saw I wasn't eating it, so kindly took it away. He then recommended a supposedly very popular egg dish with tortilla chips mixed in. Yes, it was weird, and barely edible. Honestly, the waiter was so nice and I so hungry that I just didn't want to make a fuss. I struggled through my disappointing breakfast, but managed to finish most of it.

I know the proprietors but I've been there a couple of times now so I feel I can give an objective review.\n\nDuring dinner on opening night, I had the roast chicken and it was really good. I wish I had the pork loin (which they ran out of) so I'll have to try it again. Dessert was very simple - a cheese platter and a chocolate cake. Both good. The wine list is very limited but enjoyable.\n\nThe friends I was with had the fish of the evening and it looked really good and he seemed to enjoy it too.\n\nYesterday, I went back for brunch. I had the butternut squash omelet with dragon-tongue lettuce and potatoes. It was so sweet and yummy. I never would have thought of putting the squash in an omelet but it really worked. My partner had the salmon omelet. Not as good as mine but maybe it was a little cold by the time we switched plates.\n\nI also checked that they plan on offering a vegan dish nightly so I'll definitely be coming back with my vegan friends.\n\nTo sum it up - a great intimate restaurant with tasty food not overly done. I'm looking forward to future visits with the seasonal menu.", "author": "Glenn G."}

My friends know the staff (some of them well), so I was expecting everyone to be friendly, but I didn't know just HOW friendly, understanding, accommodating, and welcoming everyone would be.\n\nI began my evening (it was almost 100 degrees in SF on Friday, by the way) by sitting down and finding out that a bottle of hair mousse had exploded in my bag while I had been walking up Nob Hill, COVERING my DSLR in white (lovely-smelling) foam! This would normally have been a humiliating disaster, but I was immediately swept into the back and given a rag to wipe off the camera. No one made me feel like I should be embarrassed or feel stupid, which, seriously, meant the world to me. I know I am a walking disaster and to not have it brought up again or even at the time was so fantastic! Plus, my camera is fine.\n\nOne of my friends brought a bottle of wine with her, and our waitress (I am so sorry, I have forgotten your name--must have been all the wine!) offered to bring glasses and cork it for us, which was really nice of her. The food was AMAZING. I tried a bit of the green salad appetizer, which was light and extremely yummy (and included feta); and had the sea bass for my entree. This sea bass was of the highest quality and was prepared flaawlessly--yum! Lastly, I was brought out what my other friend termed \"sex in a bowl\"-- a chocolate creme dessert with sinfully good mousse. And it had a candle in it, natch. The intimate setting was a great place to be sung to in.\n\nWhat a GREAT birthday dinner this was--truly special! I couldn't afford to go here other than on special occasions, but what a worthwhile venture. My recession-earned dollars were VERY well-spent.\n\nThank you for everything!", "author": "Amber G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-16", "description": "I wouldn't say I am a HUGE fan of Olea, but I am certainly a fan.  It's original, like no other brunch spot I have been to in the city.\n\nI love walking down the steps into this cozy little restaurant.  I would say that it feels like home, but it's so much better decorated than any home I have ever known.  Almost looks like Martha Stewart had a hand in it.  Jack Johnson tunes fill the air (both times I have been there).  This might normally be kind of irritating, but it fits the mood of the place...kinda swanky, but not stuffy.  \n\nAdmittedly, I have only been there for brunch.  They have a very limited menu, but everything that I have eaten is tasty and unique.  Flat omelets, AMAZING french toast, egg bakes...different each time, but always yum.  Get different things and share, so that you don't have to commit.  They have Blue Bottle Coffee, which they bring to your table in a french press.  The server cracked us up (unintentionally) telling us to wait 180 seconds before pressing and pouring the coffee...why not just say a few minutes?!  Anyhow, this is good stuff, apparently $20 a pound, and the difference is noticeable.      \n\nWhat I don't particularly like about Olea is that you get what they give you.  I tried to order wheat toast, and they only had a toast plate (for sharing) with whatever they thought looked good that morning...a composite of challah, sourdough and a darker toast with nuts in it.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not exactly what I was hoping for.  And, this is not stated anywhere on the memo, so the first time you go, you inevitably feel like you didn't get the memo.  You have to ask for skim milk, which they will bring you, but not without making you feel like it's a bit of an odd request.  Don't even think about asking for sugar substitute...it's raw sugar cubes or nothing.  I have to remember to bring my own next time.\n\nAs far as value, I have never left feeling ripped off, but the place isn't cheap.  The serving sizes are modest, but they do the trick...this last time I left very satisfied (the french toast is filling).  Brunch menu items are about $12 or $13 bucks, and then add in coffee, toast, french fries (the closest you can get to homefries or hashbrowns) and/or bacon, and it can easily get you up to or above $20 per person.  Typically, this much would buy a decent breakfast, toast and potatoes included, plus coffee AND a mimosa, but you're paying for quality and ambiance.  I suppose I am okay with that.  \n\nThis certainly isn't your every weekend brunch spot, but it's great for a special occasion or for a treat when friends are in town.  OH, and it's a small place, not a lot of tables, SO GET THERE EARLY OR CALL FOR A RESERVATION (only available for groups of 6 or more).  And, keep in mind that they won't seat you without your entire group.  Be prepared to spend some time hanging out on the steps just inside the door drooling over everyone's food or standing on the corner of California and Larkin.  Perhaps because the food comes quickly, tables turn over reasonably fast.  Though, my friend and I did almost have words with a girl who stood up, put on her jacket and purse and then sat back down to slow play the paying of the check.  We were hungry.\n\nThe host said they are very happy with their brunch service, but are struggling a bit more with dinner.  I would imagine the food is just as good, though probably a bit more expensive.  If you're looking for a nice dinner without the huge wait that comes with upscale SF restaurants, check it out!", "author": "Mara L."}

I typically don't like fresh toast because I think that it is too sweet, but not at Olea.  It was also relatively light and airy with just the right amount of sugar.  \n\nI am an orange juice snob.

I think they've been open for a little over a month now, and I felt like a lot of the bugs other reviewers mentioned have been ironed out.\n\nNo-one played with the dimmer setting while we ate, though the waiter is still a little whimsical and very eager to find out how everything is going. He also cleared everyone else's plates while my wife was still eating. That's one of my pet peeves. It might be OK at casual US style restaurants, but for anywhere nice it's too crass - please wait until everyone is finished before rushing around, bustling and interrupting the conversation. \n\nThe food was really good. The portions are relatively small - but put it this way: that means you can have a starter, main and dessert without feeling completely stuffed! Too many US restaurants serve waaaay oversized portions of mediocre food, instead of smaller and high quality. If you want to supersize your meal, go to McDonalds! \n\nI had the shrimp starter, delicious grill flavor to the shrimps. I had the beef with turnip fries - the beef was amazing, the fries good (though I wish I had more, since everyone kept eating them!) There was some kind of sauce in a little ramekin for the  beef, but to be honest the meat was so good (and the sauce a little nondescript) so I ate most of it without sauce. Dessert was the highlight - I had the 3-layer cheesecake. The top layer was torched, almost like creme brulee. Soooooo good!\n\nI thought the price was quite reasonable for the quality of food & service. Expect around $40/person for 3 courses and sharing a bottle of wine.\n\nNo real bike parking around, but a very convenient post right outside the window.", "author": "Magnus B."}

To drink , I was all over the blue bottle coffee (when it's on the menu, is there any other choice?), which they prepared as well as Blue Bottle themselves.\n\nOverall, it's a good deal (brunch dishes ~$6-10), fresh yummy food and a very cute set-up.

This time, the service was excellent, attentive but not in your face and the food was good (but not great). \n\nThe food - we shared 2 appetizers - the flatbread and the salad.  The salad was very small, maybe 5-6 leaves of romaine with barely noticeable dressing, in fact, I'm not even really sure there was dressing on it.  The flatbread was good, but came as one big cracker on a plate, then on a separate plate, a little scoop of ricotta, a few grapes, some cooked veggies and olive oil.  Very bland although the bread was tasty.  Not worth paying $10 each. \n\nThere were once again only 3-4 entrees but luckily this time they had them all.  I had the skirt steak, which was cooked perfectly at medium-rare, and very flavorful.  It came with a polenta/corn side and a green chile salsa.  All of the flavors together were excellent and the corn/polenta was particularly tasty.  If i had been rating purely on the flavors of this dish, it would have been 5 stars.  Again the portion here was very small.  \n\nThey only had one dessert left by the time we were done, which was luckily chocolate so we got it - but it makes me wonder if they are still in the habit of running out of menu items.  \n\nOverall I would come back here but it's not one of my favorites.", "author": "Amy W."}

Got to the point of peeking in and looking at the menu in the window, but never quite pulled the trigger.\n\nThis neighborhood definitely needs more decent eateries, especially since Ti Piacera down the street is really not that great.  I'd say that the closest competition is literally right down the street-- Nob Hill Grill.  \n\nThough it's open for dinner, it seems that Olea has established itself as a brunch hotspot.  On a Saturday around noon, it was crowded enough that they have a sign up sheet and there is often a wait.  The place itself is quite small with limited seating, though they have smartly put in a community table that seats ten.  We didn't mind eating at this table at all.\n\nThe brunch menu is not very large either, but at least the selections are well selected with a decent variety.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, and my brunch companion had the scrambled eggs and bacon on a roll.  The pulled pork came with some delicious, perfectly done fries and the egg sandwich came with a tasty, fresh side salad.\n\nThe egg sandwich was pretty good, and the eggs were fluffy and tasted fresh.  The sandwich itself was a bit on the petite side, but tasty.\n\nThe pulled pork sandwich was not anywhere near as good as I've had, however.  It tasty vinegary.  We determined that it was some sort of sauce that they put on the bun and not the pulled pork filling itself.\n\nWe also had a glass of very pulpy, freshly squeezed orange juice, and the french press coffee for two.  Both were quite tasty and fairly priced.  Service was good, and we didn't have to wait long for our food, either.\n\nOverall, I'd say that this place is pretty decent, but it doesn't knock your socks off.  Compared to places like Brenda's, Zazie, and Ella's, the brunch food doesn't quite match up... but the location is good and the wait isn't long like those other places.", "author": "Dave N."}

Olea fulfills the first two of those requirements.\n\nThe ambiance is darling and laid back, with calming music being played over a charmingly inappropriate iHome.  The restaurant is placed slightly underground with a view of people's lower halves as they walk by on the street and the vines as they grow over the windows.  The tiny space makes for an intimate dining experience, but the high ceilings and wraparound windows keep it from feeling too claustrophobic.\n\nI've been for both brunch and dinner, and while the dinner is good, the brunch is EXCELLENT.  Eggs in a cazuela changes a little each time I go in, but it is always delicious.  The coffee is phenomenal.  The burger is yummy.  The pulled pork sandwich is divine; not too gloppy and with a perfect amount of vinegary cole slaw to balance out the sweetness of it with some acidity.  Yum!  \n\nIf you want to be a fat kid like me, I definitely recommend getting one of those as a first course, then finishing your meal with an order of the orgasmic custard toast to share with the table.

Oh, I know what you're thinking: 'that is such an overused word' or 'she really hasn't eaten many places' or 'she's just lazy' but honestly, my favorite. You could say I even have an infatuation with them. I've been a consistent diner at Olea since they opened-- and I don't know why I've waited so long to review them. I guess because I just felt so close to them and I didn't want to lose the magic by putting down on paper... er.. website... for all of the world to see. Sometimes when you try to put something so fabulous in words, others tend to doubt or judge. And I know that's what yelp is all about, telling others your take on it, but I didn't want to feel judged for my deep held love for Olea... is that wrong?!\n\nFirst of all, I eat there mostly for dinner and I've always had an amazing dish, every time really. The chef, Gabriel, is so thoughtful about his cooking, so intelligent with his use of ingredients, so subtle the play of flavors that I can't believe he's not more of a big local star. I've had their brunch a few times, and I've loved it too. But I'm a huge fan of the dinner creations. And I know that Olea has reached my favorite status because, as my husband pointed out, I always want to go there. Always. Whenever friends or family come in town, I want to take them there. It's perfectly sized to actually have a conversation and be able to hear the other person. Somehow, the music they play seems to have been taken from my iPod and self-indulgently I love that. Plus, not to mention, they always take care of us in the most caring way. The wait staff is super kind and friendly. And Glen, the manager/co-owner, is a sweetheart. My husband even arranged to have a birthday dinner for me there and they were incredibly accommodating about it. We practically took over the restaurant, and they didn't even blink, while serving unbelievably tasty dishes the whole time, completely unfazed.\n\nI just feel like Olea and I are on the same wavelength, ya know? They just *get* me. Kind of like when you meet someone and have an instant connection, except that this is with a restaurant... didn't know that was even possible... but so glad it is...", "author": "Nina W."}

I liked the intimate atmosphere, and it proved to be a pleasant surprise. \n\nWe were the 1st ones there and service was better than fair. Our server explained a good bunch of the menu as well as wine selections. When it got a little bit busy, we waited a little bit for our check. I thought it was pretty reasonable considering there were only 2 servers plus one of the owners doing the seating and helping with the service.\n\nNot too many choices as far as entrees are concerned, but the choices proved to show a good variety with steak, fish, chicken, and vegan dishes. DH had the hanger steak. My 1st taste of the steak was a bit rough for a medium cook, but another taste proved otherwise. I guess I just got the end part of the steak. I had the halibut with brown rice. I enjoyed the relish sauce it was paired with, but I think the fish was a bit overcooked. OK, but not buttah; I wanted a bit more relish to cover the taste of the fish that was left over. We had the squash with flatbread appetizer which was a good starter for us. For dessert, we had the homemade 3 layer cheesecake which went well with our French Press coffee. I also liked our wine selection, but you're probably better off getting a bottle if you and your company plan to drink. \n\nFor us, it's a restaurant we definitely want to revisit, but not the type yet where we'd go back the next week. We'd probably try other dishes and maybe their brunch to get a better feel. For now, it's a 4 stars.", "author": "Berna P."}

Ended up coming here for brunch instead. I got a giant french press coffee here which is pretty good (blue bottle coffee beans). I tried one of the omelets, this egg with pork dish, challah custard toast, and umbrian farro salad. I think they make these dishes with a few slight variations in ingredients based on what they have and what was available. I liked the omelet the best out of the four. The custard toast was my second favorite since I was impressed by the consistency, fluffiness of the toast. The egg and pork dish was my third favorite. The farro salad didn't taste bad but I expected a warm dish, not a cold dish. It was a bit of a disappointment since I wanted something warm for the soul. Everything tasted wonderful.

To me that's garnish and therefore does not qualify as \"with fruit.\"  When I questioned it, I was told that strawberries are out of season and therefore I'd have to pay $2.50 for more.

You open the door, descend on several steps and begin to feel like you've entered familiar territory in the form of someone's simple and charming home. On my first visit, I immediately noticed the fresh flowers and plants that tastefully adorn each table and window sill. Next, I noticed the chef (the guy in the yelp picture, HA!) appear in the rustic little kitchen at the left side of the restaurant. I've been here twice for brunch and I especially enjoyed my second visit when my group was seated at the communal table. \n\nI am drawn to this place for brunch because the menu is creative while being contrite (10 items) and they serve blue bottle coffee in a french press.  Like other brunch places in the city, menu items are made from organic ingredients that of local farms. However, Olea has been somewhat more creative with their menu options. The challah custard toast with korintji cinnamon sugar and strawberries (berries vary by season) was heavenly and perhaps the best I've ever had. The flat omelet option stays on the menu but the ingredients change on a weekly basis. The omelet was the perfect portion for me, it's focus on the ingredients- peppercorns, homemade fromage blanc, purslane greens and tomato was a nice departure from my usual mushroom, cheese, canadian ham trapped within an insanely amount of egg type of omelet. The eggs baked in a cazuela served with crostini was also very good and something that I've never had before. Our table ordered french fries which were the 'good' kind of fries - skinny, just the right amount of salt and sprinkled with parsley...yum!\n\nMimosa's are made with fresh squeezed orange juice and the coffee is good.

It came with three small pieces of toast which was no where near sufficient for the amount of soup. We asked if we could have a couple more slices and were told a simple flat out, \"No\". Not even a suggestion as to something else we could do. I couldn't believe they just wouldn't give us more bread!

That is just not the way of things.  On occasion though, serendipitous winds come down from the that cloud that you didn't even see and collide with your intentions to walk through a city with completely aimless intent.  It is encounters like this, coupled with the brush of unexpected fortuity against your shoulder that lead you to places like Olea.\n\nThere I was, watching a confrontation between a cab driver on a cell phone sitting right there on the track refusing to turn left left and a cable car driver (the front man) screaming at him to get the hell out of the way.  I was really enjoying the energy of the skirmish.  It was a showdown in the sun and I had a front row seat.  Then I dropped my book.  I barely had a hold of it to begin with; just pinched between my index finger and thumb.  I turned to pick it up and noticed that the Red Door was no longer the Red Door.  It was new.  It was revamped.  It was, a brand new addition to the corner of California and Larkin.  Forgetting about the cab driver who needs to invest in a blue tooth headset, I walked in.  The layout was new to me - very simple, yet welcoming and clean.  It reminded me of Carmel.  I chose a seat facing the window and ordered a coffee and an omelet with cheese and spinach.  My waitress brought me an empty cup, which I initially thought was strange (that there wasn't any coffee inside the cup) but I opened up to \"you can't kill the rooster\" in \"Me Talk Pretty One Day\".  A few minutes pass and she comes back over with a great big French press carafe and then it all made sense.  \"Let it sit for about a minute before you press down on the handle\", she said.  I obeyed.  Then I poured...  I think this must be the first time that I've ever had French pressed coffee because it was fantastic - I think I'd remember this flavor.  Anyway, I went back to my book and kept trying not to laugh while sitting there alone at my table, but I really couldn't help it.  Sedaris is funny.  A man with a white coat came over and sat himself in a chair at the table next to me.\n\n\"I'm being committed\", I said to myself.\n\n\"We're all out of spinach, my friend.  How about green beans instead?\", he said.\n\n(realizing this was the chef, not a member of the SF mental ward staff) I said, \"hell man, you can use green beans or broccoli - I'm indifferent.  Whatever works best for you.\"  He smiled and tucked away behind the counter to the kitchen.\n\nThe food came out.  Superb!  I've never had green beans in an omelet, but I assure you this will not be the last occasion.\n\nThe sun shone in through the window and the music played on - Flamenco style.  I stayed until a couple came in and sat next to me and ask the blinds be pulled shut...  Entitlement-centric bastards.\n\nI'll be back here for sure.", "author": "Benjamin G."}

We kept getting whiffs of delicious things when passing Olea, though, so we ventured in. \n\nIt's a timeless little place where it seems that you might be anywhere in the world--perhaps Paris, Italy,...? The colors are serene, it's spotlessly clean, there are simple flower arrangements on the large tables, and you are welcomed into a tiny little community for an evening when you walk in. Since it was so early when we arrived, there was only one other diner, and we engaged in a short but friendly conversation with him and the waiter before our food arrived. We were already thinking that this would be our favorite place in the neighborhood if we lived here. \n\nI had ordered a vegan quinoa and veggie dish, and my partner had the fish. He loved his right away, saying that he often wishes he could get food just like this--beautifully prepared, high-quality ingredients without overpowering seasoning, just balanced, honest flavors. At first bite I thought of mine, well, it is very simple, but by the third bite I was savoring every delicious bit. We also had the chocolate pot au creme with sea salt and berries, and though I'm not actually a big fan of salt with my dessert, we both loved this too. \n\nOur waiter, Steven, and the gentlemen in the kitchen (which is one corner of the establishment and totally visible) were so nice to us that I only wanted to patronize their establishment again all the more. We will definitely be back, and will tell others about this wonderful little find.", "author": "Wendy F."}

It turns out this was served as a sandwich, on a wonderfully fresh slice of Acme bread.  The combination of flavors and textures made the dish absolutely sublime.   My partner had the omelette with asparagus, pork tenderloin and a reddish pepper sauce . . . out of this world.  The coffee is Blue Bottle, served in a french press, and was superb.

I could make a better, more hearty version at home!  That said, I am giving 3 stars as my bf ordered the eggs baked in a cazuela with tomato sauce.  It was a unique and delicious dish. Spent a total of $35 for only two entres (+tax, tip).  Over priced and does not live up to my expectations.  Won't be going back.", "author": "Margot M."}

It was happenstance that I stumbled into this new venue in my Nob Hill Neighborhood late this Saturday  morning, after being pampered at my favorite Recharge Spa which is just a few doors up the street (now this combo on 1 block could be addictive).  The entire scenario was so welcoming I ended up staying for brunch,solo, as in all by myself with no book or newspaper in hand. Stating I was only inquiring as to the new place, I was warmly greeted, not pressed into staying,  and the Host Glen was one of the Owners, a savvy and effervescent man. Pointing out small tables for 2 that I could dine at, he hit the right button when he showed me the\"communal table\" - why not? Met some great ladies, chatted over our plates and my experience was divine.  If you've ever had an omelet in France - then you know what real egg dishes are and this chef (the other partner!) created an exquisite moist scrambled eggs and prosciutto cotto. These eggs rank way up on top of my foodie taste buds and I can't wait to return to order what I didn't: the organic eggs baked in a little dish with chorizo - more OLE for Olea. I'm so happy this establishment has come to our Nob Hill neighborhood - now let's all go for lunch and dinner and support a totally affordable and aesthetic restaurant. This is a winner for our taste buds and Visa cards! PS - It's the perfect venue for a private party , maybe 24 diners: intimate and the chef is right there for you.   I'm going back this week to try the take out lunch (came home with all the menus!).", "author": "Guido B."}

Gave Olea a try and wow!  Very small, simple space.  Short menu relying on mostly local ingredients prepared beautifully.  Salads were gorgeous greens, the most delicious cucumber I've ever had, lightly dressed with the best feta ever.  I had rock cod and my husband had pasta--both spectacular.  Dessert was an olive oil, corn meal, orange cake served with whipped cream and preserved cherries.  We only got one serving and a fistfight almost broke out. . .it was that good.

I asked for something next to a wall or a little more private if he could and he said he'd try.  Now, while I figured I had about a 50-50 chance of actually getting my request, I was not at all prepared for what he ended up offering us.  3 seats at some one else's table!  WITH the other people!  I'm not talking about 2 tables close together or something, I'm talking about ONE 8 top with 5 people already sitting at it.  Are you kidding me?  Is this Benihana?  If I want to do the counter thing, I'll go someplace where I'm not about to drop $200+ on a nice dinner.  I really think Olea needs to tell a person that they might be forced to share a table with other diners when they make the reservation-- not after they've gotten all ready and driven all the way over there with no other dinner plans.  We refused to endure the uncomfortable setting in this place and left.  Thank god for Yelp mobile... or we would have never eaten that night.", "author": "Matt L."}

The menu changes every week depending on what is in season, and the chef and servers are welcoming and friendly. There is always one vegan dish that is usually quinoa based and there is often a vegan salad. We started with a mixed greens salad with beets and pumpkin seeds that was delicious. The beets were a very nice touch, and the salad dressing was salty and zippy. We then shared the quinoa dish, which had some very nice mushrooms and other veggies in it and was pretty yummy. One thing I noticed was that a lot of the side items to the meat dishes sounded really delicious. One meat dish came with green lentils and some of other veggies that sounded really good, and I thought it would be really nice if they would offer them \u00e0 la carte or offer a second vegan dish comprised of those items (no extra work needed!). I do love a good quinoa pilaf, but it's also something I can make on my own pretty easily. Some veggie protein like lentils or fava beans or something of that nature and/or some fresh seasonal veggies would be a nice addition to the menu. We paired our whole meal with a reasonably price bottle of Prosecco that I think had a bit of residual sugar on it. Overall, it was a lovely meal, I would just encourage the chef to offer a bit more on the vegan front.", "author": "Jeani H."}

The service and food are great.  I had the eggs baked in a cazuela with moroccan tomato - really enjoyed it! It comes in a shallow dish, has two eggs baked in a light tomato base, and I think it's got bread crumbs or something baked in there with it.  It comes with few slices of crostini - excellent together.  My friends and I shared the french press coffee and each had a mimosa.  The coffee was superb, and you could tell they use fresh squeezed oranges in the mimosa, very pulpy!  We split a side of fries which were great.  I tried a bit of the french toast (challah custard toast with korintji cinnamon sugar and fresh yerena farms berries) that my sister ordered... YUM! Fantastic! I am not usually a fan of french toast, but Olea's got some GOOD french toast - I highly recommend it! This is a great spot, I'd go back again for sure.", "author": "Christine Y."}

I was muy impressed with the french toast with fresh berries.  It was nice and soft on the inside without being gooey.  I also ordered a tall glass of the $6 OJ which I proceeded to devour in 2 minutes it was so good.  Not a good ratio of consumption to spending, but I enjoyed it.  My bud Madhu had a nice healthy salad since there aren't too many vegetarian options on the menu and she doesn't eat eggs so I tortured her while I smiled happily eating my french toast.  We saw some frites go by and couldn't help but ordering a plate for ourselves.  I hate when people order fries because when I see them I'm compelled by the power of the potato to order me some.  Death.  All in all, very impressed by brunch at Olea.  Waiter was super attentive and helpful.  He refilled my glass of water like 5 times unprompted.  Small place, great service, excellent food.

Actually, the taste of anything coming close to fennel (like anise) will make my mouth pucker up for hours on end (It may have been the bad reaction to ouzo I had one time in Greece).  Which is why this place surprised me.  Now mind you, I didn't realize there would be fennel in the food.  In fact, I was there with three other people, we all got different dishes, and there was fennel everywhere.  Apparently, it was a fennel themed evening, and you know what?  I actually enjoyed my meal.  Fennel spores, which are very light in flavor, the waiter informed me after I nastily asked him if there was fennel in the food, aren't that bad, as it turns out.  Indeed, the steak I ordered was cooked perfectly, was seasoned well, the service was great and the place was quite charming.

The polenta was creamy and buttery and perfect and is making me drool right now.) California white bass with chickpeas and a light orange peel/onion/pepper sauce had a delicate flavor that didn't overpower the dish but the pepper added a nice little kick at the end. I tipped the staff off when I made the reservation and they were kind enough to put a candle on our dessert (warm vanilla brioche bread pudding with amarena cherries. so crazy good.

Even sitting within distance of a neurotic sister my food was delicious.  The custard filled french toast sprinkled with cinnamon was nothing less than lovely, the texture, the scent, each bite lead to another.  The split peas, radish, and eggs cooked in the claypot were an ideal brunch item, lite and hearty.  The toast would have been more enjoyable if it were not for the jelly that came out of the store bought jar, still holding the shape of it's original container, and more like something from a science experiment than a breakfast spread.

But the place looked cute and we'd been curious to try, and variety is the spice of life, right? We ordered mimosas which came in small flutes and took at really long time. BUT the good news is they have Blue Bottle coffee in a french press--it was great, even without the splenda--diabetics and weight watchers bring your own little fake sugar packets, they just have cubes of the real stuff. The menu is pretty limited and the one dish that really grabbed my attention-some baked egg dish with spicey tomato sauce and black beans, they said too a while--did I mention i was a hungry girl?  So my boyfriend and I both ordered the egg sandwich. It was good, but needed ketchup--since I was told there was no fake sugar I figured they wouldn't stoop so low as to have processed tomatoes, so I didn't ask.

You're willing to put up with a lot with some places just for the sake of geographical convenience - sticky tables, creaky chairs, surly wait staff, and mediocre food.  But, when a new little spot opens up in your 'hood that seems like the restaurant manifestation of all you believe in regarding food (organic! seasonal! reasonably priced!), you just can't help thinking that it has the promise of being that perfect place around the corner that you've been longing for all this time.\n\nMaybe it is unfair, but I was holding these lofty hopes up for Olea.  It had none of the aforementioned traits that I put up with in some restaurants I go to around the block.  In fact, it is undeniably a cute, warm nook of a restaurant, the kind that you can slip into and feel coddled in.  The waiters were charming and did a great job of putting diners at ease.  Also, the menu reads like a teaser - braised pork shoulder over all'uovo pasta and peas to me conjured up images of a luscious, darkly sauced hunk of tender meat over toothsome pasta, exactly the kind of dish you want on a fall evening when you've endured weather that dulls your senses.  Alas, out came five, bite-sized pieces of plain-ish pork on a nest of plain-ish ribbon-edged pasta.  Suddenly a dish that appeared like it could be a steal now seems like it's a little on the pricey side ($14.50).  Little gem lettuce salad ($7.50) reinforced that the kitchen has an overly restrained hand with flavor.  It was lightly dressed with a garlic vinaigrette and had no other accompaniments besides the leaves, though they were crisp and fresh.  I do like simple food, and appreciate Olea's concept.  However, I just wished that its \"simple cooking\" would carry a bit of punch as well.\n\nI have faith in Olea.  I will probably try their brunch, which looks great on the menu, and perhaps give dinner another go-around, as it is so close to where I live.  But why settle for mediocrity like I do with those other places?  I'm rooting for it to be that perfect neighborhood spot that I'm still holding out for.", "author": "Rachel L."}
