Bacon bits or bacon crumbs *do not* count! \n\nAlso, your expensive SFbreakfast burrito shouldn't be premade and reheated at the prices you're charging. Make that sh*t fresh, you feel me?! You can't charge me $8 for a snack size, made the night before, bacon bits, more tortilla than egg- burrito! That breaks ALL the burrito codes!\n\nAnd finally- i just gotta ask- mayo? Really? Oh wait, it's *chipotle* mayo. No. No no no no. You don't dip a breakfast burrito in mayo. It's salsa you're looking for- or add even kimchi- but not mayo!

Unlike your typical \"coffee shop with free Wifi\" you have to pay for a spot here. In truth you're paying for a variety of comfortable seating options and super fast WiFi. Who among us has not gone to our local coffeeshop and been frustrated by the speed of internet? I find that personally I get more work done here because everyone around seems to be in a work mind set as opposed to socializing. Not of the food options have ever enticed me (I get food from other places and bring it) but I have gotten the wine happy hour which is a tad bit overpriced.

You get the first 10 hours of work for free, after that you get charged per hour.  So SF, am I right? \n\nThe pros to working here out weigh the hourly charge for the space, thank goodness.

The menu is limited, and it's very expensive, but it's really more of a workspace, with a bonus caf\u00e9. The coffee was expensive, it was three dollars. And you had to refill it yourself at the self-serve coffee station. And that cost three dollars as well! However, if you want to meet someone here for a business meeting, or casual place to grab a coffee, you need to charge your phone, or maybe bust out a quick paper... This is the place to go! There was a clear separation between the workspace in the caf\u00e9 area. There were signs that said you could not pull your laptop out in the caf\u00e9.

I'd say there's 3+ sections in the Workshop Cafe. The first is the outdoor area/patio. There are probably around 20 seats outside with tables to hang out, chat, and do work. You don't have to pay to work here. The second is an indoors area still before the paid point, which is where I did work after grabbing my coffee. The third is the pay-to-work area further in (and around) -- this is a sizable space with plenty of seating and outlets. There are even rooms I assume you can book or reserve.\n\nThe line when I entered was pretty short -- just two people in front of me, with one cashier handling transactions and several more employees working in the kitchen. This would be fast, or so I thought -- I waited in line for around 15 minutes as the person in front of me set up a room reservation with the cashier and the other employees twiddled thumbs in the back. I finally ordered my usual -- small black coffee -- and received an empty cup from the cashier. To the right was a steel canister to self-serve the coffee. That would have been fine, but the canister was empty. I notified another employee, who looked at me and sort of snapped that he'd get to that later. I sat down with a half cup of coffee and waited for the employee to switch out the canisters. He politely let me know.\n\nI hung out here for about an hour or two. I realized the caffeine had gone through me but that as a non-pay-to-work customer, I didn't have access to the restrooms. I left to find a restroom elsewhere.\n\nOverall, wouldn't really come back here unless necessary. The service and staff are a bit slow and unfriendly, the atmosphere isn't too great because (as a non-pay-to-work customer) you can see everyone else with access to outlets, restrooms, comfy seating, etc. that you get. The coffee is coffee, and I'm sure I can find a better cafe elsewhere.", "author": "Rahul R."}

For example, I focus best with high ceilings and corners of a long table. They had that. There's sofas, round tables, rooms with white boards, etc. I didn't even finish scoping out all the spaces cause I looked like a lost tourist staring at everyone working hard core. \n\nFirst three hours are free! After that, it's a subscription of hours (5 hrs for $15 and up to 40 hrs for $80).

Not much seating for just having a meal, but we enjoyed our meal outside. Only complaint my mom had is that the coffee cups are too small, so she didn't have enough.", "author": "Jodi T."}

There are a variety of workspaces, whether seats at shared tables, personal armchairs, or more private workspaces and conference rooms. You can purchase time directly from an app, which you can also use to order from their caf\u00e9, which has a surprisingly good selection of food and drink. \n\nThe net result is an environment that has more amenities than, say, the free Capital One caf\u00e9 nearby, yet it also feels like a \"lite\" version of WeWork. If you don't want to pay for your own space, the front of the caf\u00e9 is free for everyone, but it consists of only a few backless sofas and you'd be better off going to Capital One, Peet's, or Starbucks. In any case, you can order items from the caf\u00e9 without partaking in the shared workspace.", "author": "Vincent L."}

The chicken is actually cold and shredded but the flavor is good. The bread has a crisp outer shell though the inside was a bit dried out. Between the slaw, chicken, and bread, there's a slight sweet taste to it all which is balanced out by the cheddar. I do wish there was more cheddar but other than that the flavors work very well. It comes w/ Terra chips which are chips made from a variety of root vegetables. I love root veggie chips but Terra isn't a brand I'm particularly fond of. They seem to have a staleness to them (even the bags I've purchased at stores). \n\n-Breakfast burrito: So friggin good. I'm very particular about breakfast burritos and this one almost has everything just right. The only bad part is they have those overscrambled fake tasting eggs. Otherwise it's great. Their bacon isn't too salty and has the perfect amount of fat on it. There's not an overwhelming amount of potato and I like that they used white sweet potato which was a bit starchy and only a little sweet. It complimented everything perfectly. The best part is that they fry the tortilla a bit so it's super light and crispy.

This is no ordinary cafe,though. And the price is well justified twice over. \n\nOf all the places I've tried studying/getting work done, this place hits all the points in what I would ideally want: \n\n- music isn't too loud or overpowering. If you need it to be quieter, go towards the back where the conference rooms are. You can hear the music even less back there, and you also don't hear the sounds of the kitchen and patrons coming in. If you're fine with some background noise then you can sit in the front. I've usually sat in the front and have never had Noise problems. What's great is that everyone is there to get stuff done so it's not like other places where the people next to you are loud. Everyone seems to be very focused, even if they are just on Facebook. \n\n- it's open until 10pm, making it one of the only places around open passed 7pm. + major points \n- there is food. Not just cafe food (coffee and pastries) but actual food. Good food, might I add. I've gotten the popcorn, the Thai wrap and most recently the chicken bowl. I was into all of them.  They have beer, wine, kombucha, and.... Stumptown coffee! \n- more plugs than you know what to do with\n- the seating is really nice. There are booths, high tables, low tables, and the chairs are comfortable.  There is plenty of space to spread your stuff around. You can even reserve conference rooms. \n- the staff are all really cool and friendly on every single occasion I've been here. \n- the place is clean. There are people constantly wiping down tables and making sure everything is ready to go for when tables are reserved. \n\nThere definitely need to be more places like this in SF (perhaps open even a bit later?) That serve as a one stop shop for those of us who need to a place to study/work (because if I go home, I'll just end up taking a nap). \n\nFinally, a lot of people have said their food is a bit pricey. True. I probably wouldn't pay the same price for the same thing somewhere else. But you have to factor in the convenience here. This place goes above and beyond being just another cafe.

Great coffee. Working wifi. Spacious tables. Too many outlets. Penty of alcohol. I think the only thing they need now is a lounge area. You know, with a couch and some tv's for that occasional study break. As an alumni, we've all experienced those midterm or final nights to cause us to search frantically for a decent study spot. Workshop Cafe definitely made me feel like I was in school again. However, it is NOT conveniently located (in Financial District). You know what a pain it is to get there? But then again, the spot doesn't get busy as there's not much people who want to spend another hour after work. They all go home and so that leaves me with the perfect opportunity :) It was a smart investment on the owner's part as they know there's not much around after work hours. This leaves limited options for people and so they come here. \n\nAs you enter, it can be intimidating as it is pretty quiet. Their menu is up on the screen. You order and find a seat. Now there's a catch. Nothing can be too good right? You have to pay by the hour ($2/hr). However, as noobie, you get your first 10 hours FREE!!! Yes, FREE! Then afterwards you gotta pay. Don't like the idea of paying for a seat? The solution: they have free spaces in the front and outside. And yes, wifi still works. On a bright and sunny day, who wouldn't want to sit outside then? \n\nI'm pretty sure outside food is allowed, but don't take my word. I'll be sure to bring my sushirrito the next time. \n\nFor the owner: Please consider playing the same song/radio. It was a bit annoying having to hear two completely opposite songs try to do a collaboration. Otherwise, Fifi super likes!", "author": "Fiona L."}

You have a cafe serving the usuals along with some exotic teas and other dishes and you have a workshop area where you use an app to pay for each hour you are there. The two combine to form Workshop Cafe, a concept I'm slightly uneasy about. \n\nIt's cool that when you first show up, you get ten free hours. I might use those since they're free but I can't see myself paying $2-$3 per hour for an outlet and wifi. There's a lot of things about working at a typical cafe that is lost here. One thing I like about working at cafes is the chit chat going on in the background. That white noise is like a little melody that you can't find when working at home. That noise seemed to be missing here when I stopped by. There's also the people watching aspect of it. You sit at a cafe and you see all sorts of people wander in and out- here it's mostly people plugging away at their laptops much like what you'd see at work. \n\nYou could argue that this is the place to be if you are looking for silence. But then I'd rather just go to my public library. It's quiet there and you are surrounded by books you can peruse whenever you feel like it. The library is free and plus it feels good to support your local library. \n\nWhile I thought this was a good concept, it's not compelling enough to drive me to pay for an outlet and wifi.", "author": "Philip W."}

I was super impressed by the front of Workshop Cafe - that industrial-looking chandelier with oblong bulbs and orange wiring is sooo cool! - but once inside, the space felt...worn out.  Burnt out light bulbs overhead, scuffed walls, and deflated pillows made for a less than stellar impression of the back area of Workshop Cafe.  Cleaning maintenance is not performed often enough in the bathrooms, too...blech.   \n\nSure, this work space is good for meetings, but isn't it also meant for those needing a space to study?  Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of being able to order food from your phone and having a designated spot to work from.  However, the food is overpriced and nothing to write home about.  Maybe they charge for delivery to your desk?  \n\nMy main complaint is that the music is just too loud for good studying.  It is actually louder than other cafes I have studied at, which is strange.  In addition, the private, enclosed study rooms are no quieter - trust me, I've tested them out.  I found myself glazing over my notes because I kept latching on to words from the catchy tunes that were playing overhead.  Who studies to rap tunes with lots of words, anyway?  I guess some people do, but for me, the more words in a song, the less I can pay attention to my reading material!  \n\nAnyway, back to the food.  The food is mreh and suuuper pricey.  We ordered the chicken pepper stir fry ($12), breakfast tacos ($6 each, eggs/salsa/black beans/cheese) and the nutty wild rice salad ($7.50, organic wild rice/figs/toasted cashews/pecans/raspberry vinaigrette).  The first two dishes are things I can make at home for under $5 each, while the nutty wild rice salad was unique, reasonably priced, and yummy.  \n\nIf I return back to Workshop Cafe, it will be within the first free ten hours, and I'll probably just order the nutty wild rice salad and a drink.

Insanely stable wifi, an unreal outlet per square foot ratio, and solid cafe snackies to sustain your multi-hour work bender.  The place is packed with people grinding on work, which facilitates an environment that really pushes you to be productive. The cafe is really big. The front half is your standard cafe seating--outdoor tables as well as small indoor tables and a long counter top to work on. The back half is a pay per hour space (roughly $2-$3 an hour which you pay through their app). This space is loaded with different kinds of seating options to accommodate a variety of work condition preferences. They offer long counters, small tables, communal tables, private work rooms, lounge chairs, booths, and standing wipe boards among other work arrangements. It's an awesome work space and they provide you with three free hours in the pay space for your first visit. Vibe-wise it's a very productive space.

Sure, it's convenient for telecommuting laptoppers and Steve Jobs wannabes, but it strikes me as yet another way to encourage people not to interact socially with each other. Call me old-fashioned but I normally patronize a cafe to forget about work and hang out with friends or just read a book with a cup of orange pekoe tea as I pet my Persian cat. But the Workplace Cafe wants to have it both ways - a place to do work and have meetings as well as a place to have some caffeine and a croissant (photo: http://bit.ly/1baxP3P). Well, at least the approach solves the problem many cafe owners face of laptoppers hanging out for hours at a time while sipping on the same latte.\n\nNow they can hang out all they want for ten hours and then they charge $2/hour after that. That strikes me as awfully generous given the access to free WiFi, workstations, meeting tables and whiteboard spaces. You could run that internet business you always dreamed about and not have to worry about overhead costs. As for me, I think I've only been here for half-hour visits, just enough to charge up my iPhone and order the $4 Chai Latte (photo: http://bit.ly/16EOVsz) which isn't bad but doesn't last you very long. Pastries are an option as well. Open until 10PM, this is quite a large spot brightly lit with high ceilings. No mood lighting in here, and it's in the heart of the FiDi right next to the Bank of the West headquarters on Montgomery. This is definitely worth a stop if you just can't imagine a life disconnected. But I guess it depends on how you define being connected.\n\nCOFFEE - 3 stars...decent chai latte if a tad overpriced\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...pretty spacious...I've never had trouble getting a seat\nSERVICE - 4 stars...always friendly here, never intrusive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...yes, I've give it up for the space", "author": "Ed U."}

I was looking for a private space for a job interview via phone, which also included a test on my laptop via Skype. So reading the description of this caf\u00e9, it sounded good and I rented a single room. When I arrived, room was empty, had my name on the door, things starting off right. After setting up, had a little difficulty connecting to the wifi but was able to get on after several tries.\n\nNow the fun begins. Potential employer calls and interview begins. After a minute, found that the cell signal was horrible inside. Interviewer said sound quality was bad and call kept dropping. Interviewee called me back 3 times and finally gave up. I'm in a panic, run out to the front to get help from one of the employees and the person who spoke to me didn't give an F. He just said, oh, yes, cell signal is not good in here, but wifi is and tries to walk away. He looked like and dressed like he was the manager. I stopped him and frantically asked several times, is there a phone I could use?!?! Answer was no and he just kept going and left. I run outside, called the interviewer back and am now doing the interview outside, with all the background noise, people in the street, cars, you name it. I was really, really bummed out. Lucky for me, the interviewer understood my situation and he gave me a chance. I now went to get my laptop for the test via skype. As the manager said, the signal strength was good. But I couldn't connect to their F'ing wifi!!!! More than likely, their dhcp ran out of addresses and I struggled for the next 20 minutes trying to connect, I had a one hour deadline to finish this test. I was literally F'd and so F'ing pissed off. I grabbed my things and ran down the street to Starbucks to pay another round of fees to connect to their wifi.

To be clear, the Egg and Cheese Bagel Sandwich isn't a steamed egg patty with a slice of cheese. They scramble the eggs with cheese (I think cheddar) and plop it in between two toasted buns. The Latte has a decent amount of foam with my perfect cream / coffee ratio. One of these things keeps me grinding for a good couple hours. If neither tickle your fancy, you're more than welcome to bring in your own goodies. \n\nEnvironment: This place must have it's own breaker with the number of outlets available (that means there's A LOT of outlets!). There's a nice mix of programmers, students and young professionals. In my experience, this isn't a place to talk to your neighbor. The vibe is pretty laid back but people try to be productive here. Not to mention, +1 for having to worry about bums harassing me while I work like at some other coffee shops.\n\nAt first, I was completely against going to this style of coffee shop because I didn't see the value for paying to sit somewhere to work when I can go elsewhere for free. Now, I come here a couple times a week simply because I don't have to get up for my own coffee plus it forces me to be productive. This place isn't for everyone but I definitely recommend everyone give them a try.", "author": "Chris W."}

I waited 28 minutes for my turkey sandwich, and when it arrived, it was on bread so stale that I had to throw it away. I would have asked for another, but at that time my meeting was starting in 10-15 minutes, and I had to leave. I was able to pull off and eat the cheese and turkey, so I guess there's that. \n\nIn their defense, it was super busy, and so I understood the long wait time. The service was friendly, especially the guy at the register who took my order. However, the bread was so OBVIOUSLY stale, that I am quite surprised it made it to the plate. \n\nThe space is very well-designed and functional, with a TON of space and electrical outlets, and I can see why so many people go there to work. I just wish the staff would have been more selective about serving something that was totally inedible.", "author": "Jean O."}

Basically, you pay 2 dollars an hour for a guaranteed spot with outlets in a beautiful and creativity-inducing environment.  With that, you also have the ability to order drinks and food from your phone, which will then be brought to you.  Also, you get to network with likeminded people thru the app.  I mean this place is basically the coolest hub I've ever been to.\n\nThe coffee is brewed from Stumptown beans so you know you're always going to get a good cup.  I can't say too much about the food, I only had a chocolate croissant, but the salmon miso salad was screaming my name. (Next time I promise!)  Also you can get popcorn which is weirdly something I always crave when I'm hard at work.\n\nAlso, you can get beer and wine (for a surprisingly good price).  Although it was a bit too early to add a cold Pranqster to my order, it's a definite possibility for the future.  I mean, what makes reading through academic research papers easier than a tall glass of beer? (Answer: nothing)\n\nWhile this isn't a place I'd come to everyday I'll be missing it whenever I'm in my normal cafe settings.

It's so unsanitary, smells and most of the time in the afternoon your basic restroom needs (toilet paper, paper towels or soap) aren't even available.... which makes me think that your kitchen is even worst... \n\nYour food could be better but no judgement there, you guys are a co-working space not an actual cafe or restaurant.....

Different table styles as well from high stools, comfy office chairs, couch types or regular wood chairs all for your tush's liking. \n\nOnce you've redeemed your ten hours you have to start paying for use per hour but its quite affordable for what you get.

You don't even have to get coffee or food (since you're paying for the \"time\"/\"space\" rather than the drinks,) but it works in a pinch since they can just deliver it to your seat. There are outlets EVERYWHERE-- you never have to fight for a space, yaaaas! There is also ample seating, and if you stay in front, you never actually have to pay for working here (hint hint.) \n\nIt reminds me of all those London coworking spaces without the prices. Over all, I had a pretty good experience here and it was pretty conducive to working. I'll have to come back to try the coffee, but the iced chai I had wasn't that bad at $4. The food seems overpriced, but they are also more than willing to get more food nearby at an additional cost if you're not happy with the selection they have at the cafe.

This is only reinforced by the rest of the experience. \n\nThe seats for the free section are horrible. Metal. Small and uncomfortable to sit in longer then 15mins. I use no hyperbole when I say McDonald's plastic chairs are more comfortable, all the while in view of the 'paid section' chairs  which are plush and comfy. \n\nThere is no power available in the free section. Although you can admire and covet those in the 'paid section' that will have all their electron demands fulfilled. \n\nLastly, it's as if they went out of their way to punish those that dare sit in the 'free section' by offering tables that are so skinny, your laptop hangs in constant danger of tipping over off the precarious edge. \n\nIn summary, if you plan on working for an extended period of time, it makes more economical sense to invest the money you would pay for just the privileged of a comfy chair and power outlet, into another cafe that you can use to buy food, and get a comfortable chair and free wifi... for free.", "author": "Tim D."}

The turkey apple sandwich was delicious, not terribly expensive (for SF anyway) and a hefty portion size (I ate half for lunch and half for dinner).  My friend got the pomegranate mocha, which was a little sugary, but also super tasty.\n\nI only have 3 gripes about this place:\n(1) The $2 per hour fee they charge to sit in the workspace kinda sucks.  If it's your first time, you get 10 hours free, so that's nice.  But otherwise, I don't think I would come back here after my 10 hours are used up.\n(2) Street parking in the FiDi is a hot mess.  The first time I tried to come here, I circled for nearly 30 minutes before giving up and going home, because it was impossible to find parking.  Today, my friend and I got very lucky as someone was leaving their spot right as we turned the corner.  I would recommend taking public transit/walking here instead if you can.\n(3) The bathroom was very poorly serviced.  There was NO toilet paper in any of the stalls, and the floor could have used a good cleaning.", "author": "Jess H."}

Total lie. Pain to sign in, requiring a laborious text message process, and I was there meeting a client, so ended up wasting both our time just to \"sign in\" to a cafe. But that's not all. We were interrupted after 20 min because apparently both people at one table have to \"sign in\" just to be at a cafe. Fine, we both sign in. Then we get accosted for not entering our credit card information. The employee actually told me to my face that she needs my credit card info to be entered into their website so they can verify I am a real person...excuse me? I'm literally sitting in front of you and you don't think I'm a real person? What a mindless sheep of an employee. You need my info so you can charge me for some nonsense without my knowing. We tell them we're almost done, then literally 5 minutes before we were going to leave, a different employee aggressively demands our credit card info again, and then kicks us out when I tell him I don't feel comfortable giving my credit card info out for no reason. Apparently the good old flesh and blood technique of proving you're real no longer applies to pretentious, intrusive SF cafes.

Living in SoMa is great during the week and during the weekdays, but after 7 or 8 pm, it's a ghost town.

Some cafes are open until 6, but remove all outlets so prevent people from trolling. Other cafes simply don't have enough seating.\n\nEnter Workshop Cafe! Solves all these problems. Workshop Cafe is open until 10 pm, AND it is open on weekends!!The only downside is that after 10 hours of free internet, you have to pay. Aside from that, they provide all other services that can help you get work done without getting off your ass. You can reserve seats, which is great because sometimes I'll often trek to another side of the city to a cafe only to find that there are zero seats. You can also request service from your phone or computer without walking up to the cashier. I guess this is what makes up for the cost of doing work here.\n\nI will say however that I am more productive at Workshop Cafe, knowing that I will soon be paying for my wireless usage. It's not expensive, and I have yet to hit the 10 hour limit, but... it is a great motivator!\n\nLike others have mentioned, the coffee and food isn't the cheapest thing in the world, but they do allow you to bring in other food and drink (as if it ever stopped you before).

And it's AMAZING! (See what I did there? You thought I was indicting the tech elite, but I tricked you!)\n\nSeriously though, this is the best place to get some work done. These people have managed to make the concept of an internet cafe hip again. (Or maybe it's not a true internet cafe, as you have to bring your own laptop--99% of the ones I see are Macs.) For those who've never been, it's simple: find an open seat in the spacious area in the back, plug in, sit down, and work. (And enter your seat number into their mobile-optimized web app.) There are a few standing desks in the back, a few rooms with whiteboards, and a lot of power strips.\n\nOh, and the Wi-Fi! It's free, and the speeds are decent. Based on my ultra-scientific testing, I believe each laptop is throttled to 5 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up. Not bad.\n\nI also taste-tested their mocha, which was very sweet. Love it. Their yogurt parfait has raspberries, blueberries, and granola, and is similarly very sweet. I also appreciate their taste in music, which happens to intersect with mine (alternative/indie).\n\nOf course, this atmosphere isn't free. After your first 10 hours, you'll need to pay at the rate of about $2/hour. It's well worth it.\n\nWorkshop Cafe. It's a library without the books. It's the future.", "author": "Daylen Y."}

The restrooms are well-maintained, there's freely accessible water, and you can sit around for up to 10 hours staring at your computer for free!

For the purpose of getting work on your laptop done, it sure beats your usual cafe, in that it's nice and quiet (but not too quiet) and there's tons of accessible outlets and table space. In terms of the clientele scene, it's probably one of the most hipster-y cafes in the Financial District north of Market; in fact, I had to gush to Facebook about how I saw the most hipster facial hair combination I'd EVER seen (in San Francisco or anywhere else) on a fellow patron here. It felt like there were a few students here, but mostly graphic designers, freelance creatives, \"techies\" (j/k, I hate that word) and bro-y non-technical founder-types.\n\nI tried to order the Kyoto iced coffee I've heard so much about, but they were out. I got a regular pour-over, which took the requisite like, four minutes to make. It was pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend coming here just to get a coffee to go.\n\nThe coolest thing about this place is that you can reserve a spot even before you get there. Go to their website online and choose a spot, then check in there when you arrive. They'll put an orange clamp thingy on your desk indicating that it's reserved.\n\nMy only minor complaint is that people working here kind of seem to think this is their own personal UX testing ground. Ten minutes after I sat down to do some work, I saw one girl near me get approached to do some usability testing of someone's app, and then ten minutes later, I got approached by another pair of testers! I think it's cool to encourage an air of collaboration, but they need to make sure that it doesn't tilt too far into an interruption-fest such that you can't really get work done here.", "author": "Sylvia C."}

I got a Chicken Veggie stir fry- and it was really bad (hence the 4 stars). Veggies were not fully cooked, and still cold. Sauce was too sweet, and the rice was very dry, not worth the 12 dollars.

I always get a lot of work done when I go. The music they play in the cafe is also really good. Customer service is really nice too, everyone that works there is willing to help you and give you great service. What's cool too is that you get the first 10 hours free, if you work in the workspace and sign in with your application. Remember that the workspace is different from the patio/lounge. The patio is nice, but usually it's cold in the city, so its not ideal to get work done. Lounge is eh.. It's good for socializing, but not the best to get work done. No comfortable chairs or nice desk space. So, if you want to get work done, it's best if you go into the workspace.

What I love the most about Workshop Cafe is the fact that the cafe is specifically set up for people who want to get some work done. People are respectful and aren't just here to socialize. On the other hand, it isn't maddeningly quiet like a library is. Everyone's on their laptops and it's a modern, minimalist space. The fluorescent lights are a bit harsh, but hey, at least it's well lit. They also have white boards in small, enclosed rooms (might be a good place to duck in and make a phone call if needed), as well as benches and chairs for small group meetings. They also offer printing and scanning (for a small fee). \n\n(2) Wifi? Workshop Cafe boasts having super fast Internet and provides the first 10 hours of wifi on the house. After that, it's $2 per hour. They track how many hours you use using a check-in system. You notify them, by checking in on their website or mobile app using your seat number, that you are working online and they put a little doodad on your table to show that you've checked in. \n\n(3) Caffeine? Their drinks are around $4-$5. Expensive, sure, but I'll pay a bit more for the knowledge that I'm actually going to be motivated to work while I'm here. I love their ginger lemongrass tea. Slighty sweet and spicy - yum! Ooh and you can order drinks from your seat through their site / mobile app and they will bring them to your seat for you to power up while you power through :].\n\n(4) Lots of seats and outlets? I have yet to have trouble finding a seat on the weekends. It's a pretty large space with a good amount of seating and PLENTY of outlets. \n\n(5) Food? They serve little pastries and a toubouli salad, but they don't have sandwiches and that sort of thing. However, they do let you bring food into the cafe to munch on, which is a great policy. Working Girl Cafe is a block away (highly recommend the huge and delicious Chipotle chicken salad) and Sushirrito is also nearby (which I have yet to try, but have heard great things).", "author": "Eileen E."}

There are 6 indoor seats and about 8 more outside - just enough to catch up with a friend, not enough to turn it into mooch central.\n\nThen there's the \"workshop\" part, where dozens of individual seats, benches, desks, tables, and call zones make for an awesome spot to check in for a few hours and get some work done.

Approaching the entrance of the space, I saw a lot of folks seated throughout their outdoor seating engaged in lots of crucial conversations. The energy was interesting. \n\nWalking inside, their process is pretty easy and the team was very helpful. I was greeted by a nice cashier who explained the process of utilizing their paid space and the amenities included. I was fascinated by the amount of people inside Workshop Cafe, seemingly committed to their work. It was the energy I was looking for. They took my credit card and gave me table with two chairs ($2 per hr) near the front of the paid space. The baristas were quick and also pleasant. I ordered a soy latte ($4) and was pleased to learn they use Stumptown coffee. \n\nWhen my 5pm meeting arrived, I did not feel pressured to have to speak at a certain volume because of all the hard working guests around me. We were able to have a substantial meeting at a volume that worked for us. Plus, everyone was on headphones anyway. After my meeting, I returned to the cashier who closed out my \"tab\" of 1 hour of work time and my latte. \n\nOverall I had a great experience and appreciate the productive energy and culture inside of Workshop Cafe.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-08", "description": "I saw this place while walking to North Beach one day and had to check it out. I thought it would be a typical cafe that serves drinks and provides wifi. However, it's more of a socially connected workspace that uses modern technology with a trendy coffee shop vibe. There are plugs everywhere and lighting is great--basically very ideal cafe for laptop work/studying.\n\nAnywhere you sit, there will be a laminated piece of paper that explains how the cafe works. If you're in \"the workspace\" area you have to check in to your exact spot on your phone/computer. What? Check into a table? Yes, if you're sitting in seat #30, you have to check into it. After you do, they will put an orange vice thing on your table to signify that you've checked in. Apparently, if you do this, you can then get service to your personal space by using an iPhone app or a browser version if you don't want to use your phone. In other words, if you want a coffee or a cookie without getting up, just tap what you want on the app, you'll be served it, and your card will automatically be charged. Too bad they can't pee for you too. Something I thought was even more interesting was that you can check into a specific spot at the cafe if you're not even there--just log onto your app from elsewhere then reserve it so when you get there you have a space. For this service, they charge $2/hour but the first ten hours are free. I think that's a fair price because the place is well-lit, you can get personal service to your table, and there are like a million plugs everywhere.\n\nI liked the Kyoto coffee system (I had to order something made from it) that had and the baristas were all nice.\n\nThis is like the best cafe to get work done in SF. The hours are good (close at 10PM) and it's easy to sit around for hours for whatever you need to do. I hope more places like this open.", "author": "Marlon T."}

I attended a lecture near the front of the store, complete with whiteboard, that gave me knowledge I will take to work with me in the morning.  The complimentary food for the meeting was Patxi's deep dish pizza, and the free lattes I drank in real ceramic cups were superb.   \n\nThe gimmick that will draw programmers:  you will order your coffee through a smart phone app.  Yes, after you download the app you'll find out your table number and place your orders through it.  The snacks and coffee will be delivered to your table.  \n\nThe store plans to open for business some time next week.  I don't know what the prices will be, but if you are ordering your coffee through a smart phone app, I'm sure it will be a little more than Starbucks.  However, you'll get a much nicer working environment here.  \n\nIf you're like me, you are in the 50% of the market that uses a flip phone instead of a smart phone, and the app isn't going to help you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-12-09", "description": "You know what? I'm in a pretty lame catch-22 situation when it comes to working from home/writing fiction for fun. I hate bustling, agitated loudness and utter lack of electrical outlets that come with a lot of smaller cafes in my area. Unfortunately, I also live in an apartment with a room the size of a smart car garage space (with two cats who sometimes act like neglected, howling toddlers who can't be reasoned with). So, while I'd prefer to work in the privacy of my own home, a lot of times venturing out into cafe-land is my only option.\n\nMy boyfriend recently mentioned he'd gone to Workshop Cafe while waiting for me to finish up at work and absolutely loved it. Last weekend, with both of us in need of work space outside of the home, he suggested it again.\n\nThe Financial District is notoriously empty on weekends, so it was a surprise to me initially that this cafe was even open (let alone until 10pm!). The one time I'd wandered into Workshop Cafe to grab my guy had been on a weeknight during the end of business hours and the place had been packed (though not horribly loud, I'd noted). To ensure there was space available for two people to sit, we checked online prior to leaving the house. You can reserve your space prior to arriving for $2/hour (the first 10 hours are free to try out the place though...rejoice!), which I found really awesome. Who wants to spend money and time trekking down to FiDi on MUNI only to discover there aren't any spaces available?\n\nThe app revealed that there was ample space, so we decided to take our chances without an early reservation. Sure enough, we had our choice of spaces to sit down together at. It's perhaps a little irksome then that we didn't realize the near-arctic blast of wind that entered the building every time the door opened about 10 feet away would be hitting us straight-on for the next 3.5 hours we were there until after we'd chosen and paid for our seats. We probably could've moved elsewhere without too much fuss, but decided to brave it out. Unless you're a seasoned Midwesterner (and sometimes not even then, as I'm a Minnesotan myself), I wouldn't recommend any of the seating to the left of the entryway when it's cold enough to see your breath out. \n\nAnyway, the staff were friendly, the WiFi was super fast, and the drinks were more than sufficient. My only (other) complaint was that they didn't have any of their food available (not exactly sure if they just don't serve it on weekends or if they were actually out of it). We settled for cafe fare (granola cookies and the like). As a transgender guy, one of the things I dread most about ordering drinks at coffee shops is when the barista reads my name off my credit card and proceeds to shout it out when my drink is ready (I haven't legally changed it to my preferred name yet, and my legal name is very much female-oriented). Both times I ordered a drink though, they specifically asked me for my name, rather than just filching it off my credit card. Kudos. I appreciated it.\n\nThe atmosphere in the cafe is pretty chill. Sure, you'll get your occasional career-phone-chatter sitting right next to you, which can be obnoxious as heck (the bf and I were just really having bad luck on Sunday, it seems), and there will be some people who meet up to have group chats in the space. Overall though, Workshop Cafe is relatively quiet and comfortable, and if you have to get up to order another drink or run out for a bathroom break, it's nice to know your seat won't be taken when you mosey on back.\n\nDefinitely recommended for anyone who needs a space to work or study.

If there were some long term membership like three months for $150 and then for example $1 per two hours could be way better for regular customers.

Most people expect that a coffee house will allow them to use their laptop, it's a coffee house for goodness sake! This is the first time I've ever heard of a coffee house/caf\u00e9 not allowing that. People specifically go to cafes like this one to work and drink their coffee. Not only was it rude, but embarrassing in front of the other customers around me. They should be more upfront with customers about the fact that they don't allow people to work in their \"lounge\" area, perhaps by putting up a sign. This is the only caf\u00e9 I have ever heard of that has this policy. Again, I don't think it's a smart one.

I understand that businesses cater to their customers, and the Financial District isn't known for its warm and cozy mom and pop feel. The caf\u00e9 doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, and I respect its model even if I don't love it.\nIn fact, I want to like Workshop Caf\u00e9. There are very few coffee options in the area besides Starbucks and Peet's, so it'd be wonderful to have better alternatives. But this place simply doesn't vibe with me.\n\nI find the place overwhelming and uninviting. The furniture, the methodology, the layout, the young corporate workers walking by flashing something--what??--on their iPhones to the workers simply doesn't appeal to me. Check-ins, apps, and touch screens have nothing to do with coffee to me. \n\nI understand that the concept is fine and useful for the area, but why also the Ikea-style furniture? Why make everything precise and factory-like when the concept is also a little dehumanizing and cold? There's something off-putting about a business establishment that literally only caters to people who own smart phones and credit cards. If you've got a landline and like to pay with cash, half the services are useless for you. \n\nI will say, however, that the workers are friendly but not always helpful. When I asked about the set-up of the place on my first visit, I got a memorized, word-by-word rendition that made me feel like my one human interaction in the sterile environment was with a corporate robot. Also, I fiddled with the grab-and-go station for a good five minutes, gave up, went up to the counter to pay instead, and only then was told that yeah, their grab-and-go pay station hasn't been working all day. Then why not help me?? Why not take it down??\nNow, I can overlook all this. I mean, they still have a counter, a menu, and they still serve coffee. I don't HAVE to use the work areas or sit on the furniture if I don't want to. But unfortunately I also don't like the coffee, even after multiple tries. I've now tried both their espresso drinks and drip coffee, and it's definitely not a favorite, to the point where I don't want to finish my cup. Definitely not a good sign.

It's just a coffee shop with unimpressive food that rents out table/chair workspaces  on an hourly basis.  As an out of towner I didn't really get the concept and the fact that that if you sat down you had to check in and checkout was annoying.  The salads and sandwiches we ordered were memorable only because they were so non-descript and something that could have easily been thrown together anywhere.  The place was also pretty dirty which was a big turn off.  If you're coming for a quick cup of coffee this could be OK but for lunch, not so much.", "author": "Doug G."}

There are ALOT of positives, but there are some things that, for me, really drag their rating down. I have an account here and I've been here many times. My account with a large amount of hours left on it, so I'll be back quite a bit more.\n\nSo, I'll start with the good:\nTheir coffee is high quality and so is their food. \nFor the most part, there is no commodity, GMO, pesticide ridden food/drink here. Yay! \nThey have comfy furniture to sit in and outlets everywhere. \nThey even have chargers for you to borrow in a pinch!  \nThe customers are there to work. \nThe employees are helpful.\nThe music is not too loud.\nIt's a positive, productive environment.\n\nNow for the negatives....\nThe bathroom is shared with the rest of the building, so you need to use these nasty keys with large objects attached to them to go to the bathroom. I don't like washing my hands and then having to carry a dirty key afterwards!\nThe bathrooms smell too bad too often.\nThe tables are not cleaned as much as they should be for being a pay-by-the-hour cafe/workspace.\nIt also seems to get dirtier in general and unkept more than it should for being a pay-by-the-hour place.\n\nFor me, the plusses outweigh the minuses, so I'll be back often, but I wish they would improve these things!", "author": "Ang S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-22", "description": "CAUTION: This is an opinionated review.\n\nThe good:\n\n* Wifi\n* Conference rooms\n* Monitors\n* Coffee\n* Food\n* Printer\n* Power outlets\n\nRich, one of the founders, is a very nice guy, but I noticed after about our first email exchange that offering suggestions for improvement wasn't going to do very much, unfortunately. An employee told me he gets suggestions all the time and has thought about everything a lot more than you or I have. Also, I think the importance placed on priorities may be skewed. So I'll just post my thoughts here for you guys to read, and maybe _that_ will help make things change.\n\nAfter spending enough time watching people come in, I don't think *some* of the staff do a good job of making first time customers feel welcome; hiring people who are going to be a little more passionate about their craft, obviously cannot hurt.\n\nThen, today I ordered a Mocha \"for here\", but received it in a to-go cup with an apology. They simply didn't have enough cups. There was a load running, and I was told they were understaffed. Does buying enough extra mugs to the point where this sort of thing doesn't happen fall too low on your priority list? I mean we're talking chump change. You should probably have at least double your capacity worth of mugs, if not three times. Also I would have waited for a mug, like I had initially requested, since I was not in a rush, but was not offered the option until it was too late. I told her it was no big deal, and not to worry about it -- it's not her fault, obviously.\n\nThey also have what I call the \"guard-dog\" who literally sits at the entrance to the workplace. The \"guard-dog\" is forced to have you sign-in through your phone, and prove to you that you signed in, by showing your phone to him/her. This is just awkward. Please do allow me to sit down without being badgered by someone I don't want to talk to. Also, the desk and chair you give the 'guard-dog' looks so uncomfortable, I'm sure anyone who has to sit there all day would become quite unhappy; I would.\n\nThen you get to the app. Let's not even get started here. If you're going to open a techy cafe catered to programmers, designers and the likes, you REALLY need to up your \"app\". First of all, don't call the app an app. It's a _website_, and it sucks so bad, you can't even use it on your actual desktop. Furthermore, is it not optimized for the desktop. I really don't want to use my phone. I want to use my computer. And I don't know if that's jQuery Mobile but it's hideous. The whole checking in thing should probably be re-visited. We're programmers. Do something smart. You're already assuming everyone has a phone right? Well every phone has a Mac address. For your customers, they ususally always connect to the wifi. Your phone connects to wifi before you enter the building. Save mac address, make relationship between user and mac address, automatically detect users before they walk in the door, profit.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits outweigh the costs in my book, but you still have a long way to go before I'd give this place higher than 3 stars.\n\nI'll mostly be coming back because of all the super hot nerdy girls.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI just had super weird experience in the bathroom. I went to go grab a key to use the bathroom, and someone grabbed it at the same time as me. So we went together. Only problem is, their male bathrooms only have one urinal and one stall. Somebody was in the stall. I was nice and let the guy go ahead of me, but he must have had http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paruresis because he didn't even start peeing until the guy got finished his business in the stall. I had to awkwardly wait for this guy to finish getting over his pee-shyness. It was either that, or go in the stall. And trust me, you did not want to go in that stall after hearing what was going on in there. Bottom line is... you need more bathrooms. Period. This is essential to any business.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThere is Ikea furniture here. And no, the Eames chair does not make up for it.", "author": "Zachary K."}

I happened to come across this place through a Yelp search earlier today while looking for a nearby coffee shop to work out of for a few hours.  This place fit the bill perfectly!\n\nAs the video on their homepage does a great job of explaining, you're basically paying $2/hour to rent a seat in their location with the option to buy food or drinks (or not).  For folks who just want coffee, there's some free area seating up front.  For everyone else though, you can reserve a specific seat either on the fly, on your walk over, or days in advance (though that last one involves a $4 reservation fee).  Your phone number is your identifier in the system online, and your first 10 hours are free to test out the concept -- so there's nothing to lose.\n\nThe setup feels just like a shared office environment where people have cafe memberships - such as NextSpace...except without the monthly fees.  As I'm just starting up my own company, having the ability to work outside of home in a space that's guaranteed to work (ie fast wifi and accessible outlets) without being tied to pricey monthly contracts is great.  They also have different seating setup types depending on your mood and who you're working with (shared tables, booths, private spaces, etc).\n\nOh also, they have free chargers for you to borrow (they just need to hold onto a card or something) to charge up your phone, laptop, etc.  That was a HUGE save for me today.\n\nThey're still working on figuring out things themselves I think, but I'm not taking away any stars for that as they legitimately seem like they're continually improving their offerings and genuinely want to make you happy.

I like a little noise, and enjoyed the music (mod level, alt-j sensibilities), helps me concentrate.  Food is quite good. Enjoyed the salad and have made a habit of the warm cereal & espresso ($6 deal!) in the early morning.  (BTW: Thank you for opening at 6am weekdays, I know, its hard). Internet is fast, and was there when they had an outage and I they comped everyone for the hour.  I can't explain the super-neg reviews except to say that wasn't my experience at all. I wish there were more places like this.", "author": "David B."}

Also, that's because there's a good menu with items in all sizes and for all tastes. The place is very well located right next to the embarcadero ferry port (where they have a market and all sorts of goodies btw). The space is well designed, temperature is nice, and it's nice to work with a view on the street, or further inside for less distraction. I like that you can even sit outside. It's 2$ an hour for the workspace but they start you off with 10 free hours which spells confidence in their business; I like that. I tried quite a few of their menu items, you can order via the app straight to where you are sitting without getting up (also a nice touch), and the food comes in all sizes and kinds so you can munch a  bit while you work as the day goes by or pause and have a meal. If you don't want to pay for the workspace, you can sit outside in the non workspace sections and run your machine off the battery. I like that that is an option: the thing is I feel like I have the choice of where and how and what to do and that's my kind of business.", "author": "Zou Z."}

The only reason I came here in the first place was because I was looking for a bathroom open on the night of the CNY parade. Now with that out of the way, onto the review itself.\n\nI ordered two drinks: a cappuccino and a cold brew, both about 4 dollars each. The cappuccino was excellent. Not only was it topped with a creamy cap of finer-than-fine  milk, it met so well with the dark espresso underneath that I was instantly asking my friends to try it upon my first sip. Shit's good man. The cold brew was pretty good, but not quite as satisfying. I wish they sold some sort of chocolate treat, as it would complement the flavors very well. Still, this could just be personal preference.\n\nOh yeah, the bathroom is pretty nice to.", "author": "Zeno H."}

The quality of this place has gone way downhill.  They recently hired some new employees who seem to have dragged the business down quite a bit.  My last few visits have been frustrating to say the least.  \n\nOne visit I ordered an item from their menu (using their phone number app), received a confirmation text, and 30 minutes later nothing.  I texted again asking about it and again nothing.  At this point it had been 45 min so I talked to an employee directly and found out they sent my order to the wrong table.  I understand mistakes happen and I blew it off and remained a regular.\n\nMy next visit back I was working at a communal table which seats ten.  Their were already about 5 people scattered around the table and everything was fine until a woman came in trying to teach a class.  She decided to take over the table we were working at.  Clearly they wouldn't fit and instead of taking it somewhere else she decided to inconvenience everyone around them.  They dragged chairs from all over the cafe and squeezed the people already working there into a corner.  Some people just left fed up and others tried to tell them they couldn't do that.  It honestly felt like the customers were doing the staffs work in dealing with the situation.  Staff eventually came over about an hour later to check them in but again didn't fix the situation.  Another flood of her students later came in and we just decided to move across the cafe.  She was also so loud you could hear her from every corner of the cafe.  It was very frustrating and inconvenient. \n\nAfter this experience I'm sad to say I won't be back.  The older employees have always kept everything in control and maintained a reliable and consistently great environment.  The newer staff didn't do there job and left the customers to deal with a mess that shouldn't have been their problem.", "author": "Jas C."}

When I walked up to the order counter, I was immediately educated by the counter girl, that this is a 'workstation' bar. But, I am welcome to order some food and either take it to go, or sit outside. Here they cater to people coming in and utilizing the many electrical and computer ports, while sipping their favorite (fill in the blank) beverage. I was a bit put off by this bold explanation. But, told her I wanted to order a salad anyway. . . I paid and was told they will call my name when it's ready, I am welcome to . . sit outside. (again a little put off by the dismissal to the outside). So, out I went, which was where I intended to be anyway since it was a nice day out. . . and I waited. . . and waited. .  .and waited. . . 20 minutes of waiting for a flipping salad. I walked back in to see if they had called my name inside, and didn't remember I was outside. Nope... the girl says, \"what was your name again?. . Oh, yeah, I'm going to get to that\". . (please let me explain to you the reader, that there are NO OTHER ORDERS being worked on). Well, another 6-8 minutes and my salad was handed to me. I went outside where I had already been banished, and ate my lunch. I am giving ONE STAR here simply because the salad was actually good. BUT, the service (extreme lack of) and the attitude towards a person who simply wants to sit down and enjoy their lunch, I definitely say, forget this place. . . While I was growing old waiting for my order, a couple of women walked up to the door, and one says \"there's no crowd here, it must be bad\". . . then they turned around and walked away. There is no crowd because they have no concept of service.", "author": "Greg S."}

Plenty of space to work, plenty of power, and you can order from the app and they'll bring the food right to your table.    They claim that they have \"crazy-fast wifi\" but I just tested and got about 2.5Mbits down and 25Mbits up.  the upload speed probably does qualify as crazy-fast, but that download speed doesn't deserve the \"crazy\" label.\n\nI think this model of charging by the hour is superior to the workspaces that charge by the day.  There are quite a few people here, despite it being pretty late on a weeknight.\n\nDownloading torrents seems to be blocked by their router.  My recommendation to them is to have some portion of food/beverage purchases count as a credit for future work-sessions.  This would incent users to purchase food, and come back again - it would serve as a built in loyalty program without requiring a loyalty card.\n\nUpdate - I came back again, and its starting to get really crowded - still room, but i anticipate that they are going to need to open up a few more locations to keep up with demand.", "author": "Denis G."}

But, when I needed a place to get some work done I stopped in here one day (the first ten hours are free). I got a surprising amount of work done; the place is designed for it. The cafe portion of the enterprise almost seems like an afterthought. There are plenty of outlets, monitors to plug into, decent wifi, printing/scanning, etc. For all that, a couple dollars an hour doesn't sound too bad. Sure you could go to a regular coffee spot, but you aren't going to get those amenities and you are going to feel obligated to buy something. I feel no such obligation here. That said, the pomegranate mocha is pretty good. If you do order something, you don't even have to stop working, just text them your order and they will bring it to you.
