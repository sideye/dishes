{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-29", "description": "As happy as I was to discover a burrito joint so close to my office, I can't say I was expecting much either.  Which is kind of odd, since those two sentiments essentially contradict each other.  However, Publico doesn't exactly ooze authenticity.  I mean, I get that they're going for an \"emission-free, indoor taco truck\" concept (which is essentially just...a taqueria), but it's hard to get excited when I can't see the meats cooking on the flat top grill!\n\nIn all seriousness, besides the mildly odd layout (order from the \"window\" on the right, pick up from the one on the left), Publico actually gets the job done if you're craving Mexican food.  Despite offering only the three basic meats (just pollo asado, carne asada, and carnitas), at least the rest of the menu has a pretty good variety of offerings - Burritos, Burrito Bowls, Tacos, Tortas, Nachos, Salad, and Carne Asada Fries(!).\n\n-- THE CALIFORNIA BURRITO - Carne Asada, Jack Cheese, Fries, Pico de Gallo, and Guacamole in a Flour Tortilla...$9.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/publico-urban-taqueria-san-francisco-3?select=jGvtlqTOELpQ4U5iFOhAdQ)\nNot bad, but not all that fantastic either.  My burrito was filled with a decent amount of carne asada and fries, but I felt like their flavors were overpowered by the pico de gallo.  The fries also made the filling feel a little dry, though the guacamole helped with that (needed more!).\n\n-- FISH & CHIPS BURRITO - Beer Battered Tilapia, Fries, Avocado, Chipotle-Lime Crema, Jack Cheese, Lettuce, Salsa, and Guacamole...$9.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/publico-urban-taqueria-san-francisco-3?select=mBwvQ4QA9nHtbGu6X1bPeA)\nOn the surface, this isn't all that authentic, but it's DELICIOUS!  While it sounded weird at first, it's really not; imagine a California Fish Taco, but as a burrito.  The tilapia was flakey and fried perfectly, the fries were crispy(ish), and I loved how the cheese and guac blended together.  Plus, their chipotle-lime crema is awesome!\n\nWhile Publico's prices are a notch higher than taquerias in the Mission, they aren't particularly awful and the quality of their ingredients is supposed to be better (all natural, grass-fed beef, etc.).  Although the California Burrito isn't worth it, I have no qualms paying $10 for their Fish & Chips burrito.  What's more, Publico is pretty convenient - walkable from anywhere in Mission Bay and there's never much of a wait (except, perhaps, on Wednesdays, when the farmer's market is going on).\n\nAll in all, based on the two things I've had (and what my coworkers had to say about their food), Publico is pretty okay for what it is, and great for something relatively quick or on the way to a Giants game, but not anything to go out of your way for.  The rest of the menu has a couple of things that sound interesting, but to be honest, it's pretty much Fish & Chips burrito or bust for me.\n\nTHREE AND A HALF STARS rounded up.", "author": "Mike L."}

Although the prices are on the high end for Mexican food, Publico makes it a point that they use grass-fed beef, natural ingredients, etc.  Plus, it's impressive that they have a perfect score for health inspections (though this is expected as part of UCSF).  My main complaint is that all their meats are fairly salty (not expected for UCSF) but I guess that's what it so tasty.\n\nThey have food for every occasion in the typical life cycle of a grad student:\n\n-the vegelicious MEXICALI SALAD ($8.50) for something (relatively) healthy--my staple.  Bonus health freak points for black beans, radish, and avocado\n- the high-fat-diet CARNE ASADA SUPER FRIES ($8.75) for pre-gaming pre-carbing \n- the comfort food CARMEN'S NACHOS ($7) for satisfying cravings of nachos and the general salsa-meat-guac-melted cheese Mexican food flavors\n- the basic STREET TACO ($2.75)  for a simple snack, with the healthier/fancier/pricier option of a GRILLED FISH TACO ($4)\n- the massive SUPER BURRITO ($8.75) for a super massive appetite\n\nConclusion: Exactly what the residents of Mission Bay need--tasty taqueria food that you can pick up after a long day (and a long bumpy shuttle ride) that you can bring up to your room and stuff your face in preparation for a long night of work to get done.

It was so greasy that I ended up not eating the tortilla (which became completely soaked in grease after a few bites) at all. It was disgusting. My wife ordered a carne asada burrito and did not have the grease problem, but did have the terribly-rolled  and fally-aparty problem. \n\nThe good?

Mission Bay is in dire need of some new eateries (food truck or otherwise). It's set up as a \"low-emission food truck\", meaning it's small with food truck inspired d\u00e9cor, but its an actual establishment that won't leave you stranded every other Friday wondering where to go for lunch. I've had the burrito morales, a quesadilla with add-ons of guac and sour cream, and the carne asada fries. \nBurrito morales ($9ish): Mexican rice, black beans, lettuce, sour cream, salsa fresca and avocado all stuffed into a tortilla. It's a pretty good size, but lacking in flavor. I also prefer more moist veggie burritos (i.e. MORE GUAC and SOUR CREAM).\nQuesadilla ($7ish with the add-ons): not bad at all, probably because it was stuffed with their guacamole which I am a fan of.\nCarne asada fries ($9ish): the only menu item I've had with meat in it, and I was sadly disappointed. I expect carne asada to be crispy, retaining some juiciness, and packed with flavor. This contained Chipotle-esque chunky pieces of steak that lacked that carne asada broiled flavor. The fries were too soft to hold that amount of sour cream, salsa fresca, and guac, and tasted like they had been frozen. On the upside, the guacamole tastes fresh and they are generous with it.", "author": "Ruth M."}

But for a *convenient* spot, it's an enjoyable one.\n\nMy favorite thing thus far is the tacos. They're piled with meat, and therefore a pretty good value. I would say -- get two if you're ordering sides, three if it's your whole meal. Those will likely be my go-to's going forward. \n\nBurrito is OK. Pancho Villa's kind of my benchmark, and these are enjoyable but not quite there. But that's not to say they're BAD; just not my favorite. However... one time, I mistakenly got the one with fries, which was a little much for me. Be warned!\n\nOn the last visit, I ordered the side of beans and OH MY GOODNESS, you get a large serving. They're pretty good. They're on the plain side, so don't worry about overly spicy beans.\n\nThe chips are OK. I prefer chips on the thinner and lighter side, so maybe it's a preference thing, but they aren't my favorite. If you like thicker chips, you'd probably enjoy them.\n\nThe salsas (available in ketchup and mustard squeeze bottles) are pretty good. The green salsa is mild; the red has a kick (just enough of one for me).\n\nPRO TIP: before you go, make sure you have your WHOLE order.

Located at the UCSF Mission Bay South building housing complex next to Subway. \n\nThe details:\n\nMexican Salad = best decision ever. It's gotten smaller over time though, so it's less of a value than it was before. If you ask for special instructions such as salad dressing on the side of something, chances are they are going to mess up. It comes with a layer of beans on the bottom, lettuce tossed on a cilantro salad dressing, topped with corn, radishes, meat of your choice, salsa, sour cream, avocado slices and chips. Pro Tip: Definitely recommend getting the chips on the side, they'll give you a baggy and that means MORE salad! I love getting the green chille verde chicken on this salad, it's like free flavoring. \n\nAguas referescas: Watermelon, horchata and canteloupe are your choices. Watermelon \n\nSoup = if you buy it, you are in store for the saltiest and oiliest experience ever. THe best thing to do is to go home and water it down with some hot water and it'll taste a lot better. \n\nStreet Tacos: They're nothing too extraordinarily special, but you do get the equivalent of two tacos. It's a basic two tortilla deal with a heap of meat topped with cilantro, onions and lime. Pro Tip: split the meat in half and make your own tacos with the two tortillas they give you each taco. If you eat it as is, you risk just breaking everything apart and making yourself into a hot mess. \n\nCali Burrito: Carne asada, fries, guac, salsa rolled into a burrito. It's a tasty guilty pleasure. Definitely something you splurge on because it's pretty hefty. ($8). Good enough for two meals! \n\nFish-cali burrito ($~8)  - skip it. ( Fried fish pieces, french fries, guac, some cabbage and sauce)The fried fish in it is pretty dry, and tehre isn't much flavor overall. The sauce they put in is just like mayonaise. You're going to have to drown the thing in ketchup. It's pretty pricey for what you get.  \n\nHours: they have some weekend hours now, but are still limited. \n\nStaff: they've been notorious for messing up for orders... shame on me for asking for no beans or salad dressing on the side. But hey it happens. They're nothing to gush about, but nothing to get really fired up about. \n\nThe verdict: I'm addicted to the mexican salad, but the rest of the menu is nothing special in terms of Mexican Food. It's a step up from taco bell definitely, but not your mission style taquerias.  If you're in the neighborhood or work in the area, it's worth a lunch trip, but not a place I'd go out of my way for.", "author": "Christine B."}

And I agree that the cheese quesadilla is kind of inedible - it's rare that I would say this, but there's just too much cheese.\n\nThis is a little tricky, because for a taqueria, it's ok but not phenomenal, but for options on the UCSF Mission Bay campus, it's pretty good.

I might stick with this and their guac, which I do think is pretty awesome.  Their quesadillas without meat are nearly the same size as those with meat...meaning there is a TON of cheese in them!  I love cheese, but I don't need a whole pound of it in my quesadilla.  Also, they make the quesadillas look more like a squished down burrito rather than a folded-over tortilla...after you get it you'll know what I mean.  Which is fine, but just be warned.  And they do grill it well, I thought...I like the crispy outside.\n\nI've had other things on the menu, and in general, they just don't wow me.  I've never tried the al pastor torta, but thanks to Stacey H.'s recommendation below, I may next time.  The meat burrito only has meat, beans, rice, and salsa.  I really wanted a burrito San Diego-style...meat, guac, salsa.  In order to get that, it would cost me $1 extra for the guac, making it like $6.99 I think, AND i would have had to be \"that girl\" who stands there ordering something \"without X, without Y, etc.\"  Which I hate doing.\n\nOverall, there's nothing really bad about the food, their service is friendly, but I would go elsewhere if I could.

I look on the menu for a fish taco...then my eyes land on \"Charlie's Crispy Taco\" for $3.99 and I'm like...hmmm....I am usually intrigued when they name a dish after someone or the restaurant...I have this idea that it should be good. Anyways, after just quickly glancing at the name, I told the person behind the cash register (while holding out my $5 bill to him) that I wanted the \"Charlie's Crispy Taco\"...he then asks, \"what filling\"...and I'm like, \"uh...everything!\"\n\nThen he replies back, \"ok, you want chicken?\", and I'm like, \"uh...\" realizing he wanted me to tell him what type of meat filling I wanted. Ok, then I ask, \"do you have fish?\" (while still holding out my $5 bill for him) And he's like, \"yeah, but it'll be $2 extra\" and I'm like \"ah...Ok,\" and he's like \"Ok, what?\" in a kind of irritated tone of voice.\n\nI reply back, \"Ok, I'll take the fish even if it's $2 extra\" thinking...hey, i wanted to see if their fish and \"crispy taco\" would be just as good as Nick's even if it costs more than my $5 tuna footlong. Then he replies back, \"that's not going to be enough\" and I reply back, \"well if you want to take my money first (that I had been holding out since I first approached you) then I can get my wallet and get you more money\" I admit I was a little grumpy/annoyed...had trouble sleeping the night before, rushed to catch Caltrain...basically, I was hungry and just wanted my food, NOW!\n\nThank god I beat the lunchtime rush, can't imagine having to wait for my fast food order for more than 3min.\n\nAnyways, my order: 1 Charlie's Taco $3.99 with fish substitute $1.99, tax $0.51, Total: $6.49.

Decent sized fillet, filled the taco in one piece. \n- Temp: slightly more than warm...but not hot enough for me. I like Nick's fried fish that you get the feeling that it just came out of the frier piping hot! \n- Other: decent amount of guac (nice and green), tomato, black beans with shredded lettuce (green with slight light brown edges); flour taco outside nice and soft/lightly toasted with lathering of the black beans which held the crispy crunchy corn taco...a little soggy inside because of all the wet fillers (fish, beans, guac).\n\n- Total Taste: typical of a fish taco, nothing exciting, it was good because I like quac in general and it was decent...but not like Nick's, unfortunately  \n\n- Will I come back? Maybe, might want to try the Charlie's Taco with chicken and/or sthg else...but only if I feel like Mexican...which doesn't happen that much, maybe once every 3 months...unless it were Nick's Fish Taco.\n\nResearch shows that there is a Publico at 555 9th St (between Bryant St & Brannan St), San Francisco, CA 94103\n- might be \"Public I\"", "author": "Cindy W."}

I wouldn't recommend this place to any of my friends or co-workers.", "author": "Chris W."}

You two big halves that you could share with a coworker or be completely stuffed on. I also enjoy their carne asada soft tacos and their baja fish taco. Dont think youre going to receive a small fish like other places. Their fish wont even fit in the taco! The small portion of chipotle sauce on the bottom gives it the right kick.\n\nThe downside to this place is their long lines and ridiculous wait times.

The black beans that pair with the enchiladas are really yummy. The tamale is good for the price. But the tortilla soup is the best tortilla soup I've ever had, and being from So-Cal, that's a big statement. It's served to you with a lime slice on the side so that you can control how much citrus you want in your soup. Genius! A third of the cup is all big pieces of pulled chicken; add in tortilla, rice, avocado, and beans, and you've got yourself a really hearty soup! Yumm . . .\n\nI would say things here are fairly priced and very convenient since I'm not too far away, but the one drawback is that they use these eco-friendly take-out containers made of really thin cardboard paper (you native SF residents know what I'm talking about). While I'm not against saving the planet because I'm a big \"green\" promoter too, it just doesn't make the best medium for carrying saucy Mexican food. The yummy spicy rojo sauce that covers your enchiladas just ends up getting soaked into the container (which is probably why they double box all hot orders), and your enchiladas also get stuck to the paper container as well. Boo!\n\nTip: Have a hangover? Go for the tortilla soup and a side of rice. It'll put that bounce back in your step in no time.", "author": "Linna L."}

Let's just call it \"Pubico\" from now on........\nI work nearby and as a vegan I order a burrito with no meat or cheese. They have messed up the order about 5 times (by putting cheese in the burritos). I kept coming back because there are so few places to eat in the Dogpatch area and because when they DID get it right, it was good. Their salsa was another issue though because it tasted like canned tomato sauce with some hot sauce in it.\nBut this time I went and ordered the vegan burrito and the guy said \"We don't have vegan burritos here. The beans are cooked with beef stock.\" I was shocked especially since it says on the menu \"vegetariano black bean negritos\" which would seem to mean beans cooked without meat but the guy said there's only one bucket of beans back there.......Bucket?

The flavour was good. I could eat it again. \n\nI was looking for a little more selection of meats. The usual suspects were listed with one omission. Was looking for the crispy carnitas!\n\nThe fish taco was pretty good. The fish piece was big. It was a little over $3. Again, a little high. Also, had the crispy taco, also a little over $3. It is like a light double decker taco. \n\nI had the carne asada and al pastor meats. They were seasoned well and had a nice flavour.\n\nIf you're keeping score, that's $9 for 3 tacos. I didn't think it was that gourmet that it warranted $9.  \n\nThe extra points are for being a glimmer of light in the otherwise sparse food plaza.", "author": "Andrew Y."}

I barely ate 20% of the burrito before I began feeling nauseous and ran to the restroom to hopefully beat my \"vertical spill\". I looked inside the burrito and noticed the meat was extra dry and seemed quite old.....I did go over before 12Noon, so it was probably stored from the day before. Oh, to dismiss any outliers, publicos was the only thing I ate that day. So went back over to tell publico about my experience, needless to say, they said it wasn't their food and they didn't serve meat from the day before. Which is completely false! I saw the cooks shredding lettuce at 2pm and putting in white barrels, yes for the next day of service. Lunch hour was over. Next the cashier said her manager told her not to disclose any more information to me and that it wasn't their fault. First, I was not trying to sue you, I just thought that not eating 80% of your product would be proof that it was horrible for me. Second, why not just give me my $8 back for hardship and horrible service. I called publico's management, no one has ever called me back a month later. \n\nWelppppp..... thats the end of me supporting them ever. The food is not the best mexicali in the city.

Sorry Publico Urban Taqueria, I thought the crispy taco was close to being up there with Nick's Crispy Tacos yet your bad employee has lost you a potential regular customer.  Plus, you don't have a customer bathroom- so if you want to/need to simply wash you hands before eating you will need to go to another nearby restaurant or cafe and buy something additional to use their restroom... Four star plus taco, minus one for no bathroom, and minus another for poor customer service.  If you had a real salsa bar, it would be worth a positive star but you don't...

The torta is the best thing to get here either chicken or steak with a Jarritos. The thing about the new BREAD, is that its tough and not soft, so when you try to split the torta is falls apart. This happens every time, and it didn't with the previous bread. My advice change back to the softer bread. The new bread is even hard to bite through. I asked one of the cooks and he confirmed it, they did in fact change the bread. Their burritos aren't very good at all, their $8 salad is really good.
