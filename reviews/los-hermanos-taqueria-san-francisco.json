Also you can get free chips to eat with said salsa, which is always a win in my book.\n\nOpted for a super burrito with pollo asado. The burrito was huge, definitely more than I could finish.

In 2018 they got the NASTIEST BURRITOZ FOR THE HIGHEST PRICES. Totally not worth getting your burritos from here. I live in the Tenderloin and I come here often. Im starting not to trust them with my food. I highly recommend you get them in the Mission District instead for a much LOWER PRICE and much HIGHER QUALITY. Every single time I buy here I feel completely ripped off for the quality of my burrito. They always fold the torilla up to take extra space in my burrito and put nasty left over meat inside my burrito. Its just completely fuken nasty. I suggest you check your food. Just tryna help you out. Eating nasty food can be really disturbing and disappointing. Especially when you look forward to eating all day. I actually threw away nearly my whole burrito. Have never done that in my life. This has also occurred on many separate occasions not just one single time. Please consider other places before getting your nasty burritos here.

I don't know why I thought that a taqueria within a corner store would take the time to fry the fish to order, rather than tossing some pre-cooked fish sticks on the grill to warm them up. I cannot blame Los Hermanos for my own na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\nBut I *can* blame them for the deceptive descriptions on their menu. To wit, \"cilantro & onions\" are not listed as ingredients included on the fish tacos. Nevertheless, after I observed the cook remove the fish sticks from the grill and toss them onto tortillas, I was horrified to watch helplessly as he sprinkled - nay, doused - the fish sticks with cilantro & onions. I do not eat onions. If the threat of onions had been advertised on the menu, I would have requested that the onions be omitted from my order. But I had no way of knowing that onions were even in the conversation! And before you say, \"Alexandra P., this is your own fault, you should have known that cilantro & onions are standard toppings at a taqueria,\" consider this: cilantro & onions are explicitly listed as ingredients in several other tacos featured on the menu. Because they are listed as ingredients on other tacos, and were not listed as ingredients on the fish tacos, the reasonable inference is that they are not ingredients on the fish tacos! This is a case where the absence of evidence should be evidence of absence, Los Hermanos! Get your menu right!\n\nI was not heartbroken when, on my third attempt at a bite, one of the fish sticks slid out of the tortilla and landed on the floor, rendering the taco inedible.", "author": "Alexandra P."}

When you view the menu on Yelp before entering your address to order, there are beverage options available that then disappear when you start the ordering process, namely the horchata and the fresh juices. That is probably an issue that Yelp needs to fix, however the restaurant did a horrible job of responding to me when I called them for help ordering juice (since the whole group wanted juice or horchata).\n\nThe woman who answered the phone frustrated me quite a bit. I told her the drink options were not available and asked her if I could add them on to the order via phone. She didn't say yes or no, but repeatedly said \"I don't know\" and then told me to call \"them.\" She wouldn't clarify who \"they\" were, and when I said \"I'm ordering through Yelp/Eat24 but I don't see a way to contact them/don't have time, can I please order the drinks with you and give you a credit card number over the phone\" she kept saying \"call them.\" After a few times going back and forth with unclear responses from her, I said, \"So you can't help me?\" and instead of giving any sort of normal response, i.e. no I'm sorry or yes, what would you like and I'll add it to your order, she started talking to someone else in the background and ignored me, and then a few seconds later, she hung up on me! \n\nI have worked in a restaurant before, so I understand the pressure and stress of having to answer the phone in the middle of lunch service. But all she had to say was, I'm sorry it's not possible, the drinks aren't available, and I would have hung up, but keeping me on the phone for a few minutes, to say nothing concrete or direct and then to straight up hang up on me was the wrong way to go about it.\n\nI had to go through with the order since it was too late to find an alternative. I chose sodas for the drinks. And here comes the next problem: a delivery man arrived with the food in 2 backpacks - the kind you use to hike. It was all squished - the regular burritos were ok but the sauce from a wet burrito and enchiladas had dripped all over them! It was an unacceptable condition for the food to be in.\n\nWe will never reorder from this restaurant. The restaurant should consider changing how they transport their deliveries so that the food is in a presentable condition when it arrives. The enchiladas and wet burrito looked really gross, with the guac and sour cream and beans all messed up and squished onto the top of the box. I really hope they reconsider their approach to customer service - the people answering the phones should be polite to the customers. And PLEASE update your menus with Yelp if you can!", "author": "Madeleine B."}

The delivery icon showed up under Los Hermanos so we ordered.  Shocked to get a phone call an hour later saying they don't do delivery.  We go to pick up and on their outside sign it even says \"FREE DELIVERY.\"  Drove all the way over there in the rain - lot's of employees there - they could  have delivered.\n\nIT GETS WORSE:  the food.  If you can call it that.  Only 1 out of my 6 flautas had any flavor or meat.  Looks like they stuffed the top flauta with lots of goodness and then decided to just fry the shells for the rest of the 5.  They were horrible - I couldn't even eat them.  So I paid for 6 flautas, ate 1, had to throw the other 5 out.\n\nHusband's Burrito:  He ate it - never complained but an hour later he threw up.  \n\nSo disappointed in this place.  Owner could have gone out on a limb to deliver our food.  We ordered Delivery dude! \n\nGotta throw this out there - I am very critical when it comes to food in San Francisco.  So many great places to eat so keep in mind when you read my 1 star review - my standards are very high.  Just want to be realistic and honest.", "author": "G G."}

It is in my opinion the best Taqueria in the Lower Nob / Union Square / Tenderloin area.   I like the feel of this place and the people are always very pleasant.\n\nLately it has seemed as though they've had a little turnover in the kitchen.  Maybe they rotate different friends or family in -- who knows.  For the most part the food is always great, but I've found a couple of the less familiar faces to be a little less consistent than the rest of them.  Anyway, tonight they had someone back there I had never seen before.\n\nI ordered the pollo asado super burrito with black beans on one of the flavored tortillas, and it ended up being the best burrito I have ever gotten here (and among the best I've gotten from any taqueria ever).  Perfect.  Fuck it was good.  The tortilla was warmed perfectly, it had the perfect mix of ingredients, and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Everything was just perfect.  \n\nReally you might be thinking \"BFD\" but I've had a lot of burritos in my life and this thing was perfect.

Jump in a cab and go... wait a minute, where are you dropping us off?  There's no restaurant around here just this liquor store, it's kind of a seedy area. Yep the restaurant is more like a lunch counter inside of a bodega/liquor store. Only a couple of tables, not exactly what we were expecting. The beef and pork in our dishes was a bit over cooked and tough but the overall flavor was really good. I would try the chicken. There is a little salsa bar with a couple of salsas which were very flavorful. It was a great local experience, glad we did it.

It's a hole in the wall location, with a few seats crammed into a tiny space next to the food counter (it's located inside of a supermarket, so there's really not much space to work with -- I'd recommend only bringing a small group here).\n\nStill, service is friendly and prompt! Boyfriend and I had our food within about 10 minutes of us ordering. His carnitas burrito was hefty for a regular and my lengua tacos had some huge chunks of meat (I'm used to seeing smaller cubes, but they seem pretty generous here at Los Hermanos). The salsa was spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. This is also the first place I've been to where they used a red salsa instead of a green salsa with their lengua. Regardless, it was yummy!\n\nI also highly recommend getting their cantaloupe juice if they have it -- their agua fresca selection is available on a rotating basis. It's refreshingly delicious and not crazy sweet. It's a little pulpy towards the bottom (I'm pretty sure they just straight up juice the fruit and pour it for you), but if you can get past the texture of it then you are golden.\n\nDefinitely recommend this, though it's a bit of a hike from Civic Center BART.

Using the neighborhood search I found Los Hermanos which was only 6blocks from my apartment plus they had solid reviews, sold!\n\nVery friendly staff, good price on the Carne Asada regular burrito, added some spicy salsa, jalapenos and cilantro to give it that kick I need and in under 10 minutes I was on my way home with dinner. The Salsa bar looked fresh and colorful. The bonus for me was the grocery store that Los Hermanos is located in, it has all the Latin food groceries that you need, I'll definitely be back!\n\nMuchisimas Gracias Los Hermanos!", "author": "David P."}

And the salsas in the back are fresh, tangy, and tasty, not bland and mushy. \n\nYou can tell if a taqueria cares by the size and freshness of the lime wedges they provide at the salsa bar (unlike the fingernails of lemon at Chipotle), and in this area too El Tesoro is a standout. \n\nOn the Tenderloin side of the Tendernob, the location may not be a draw, but the seating is all behind the counter/kitchen area, well away from street noise.... which makes it something of a sanctuary, even if you just stop by for a Corona. \n\n(I almost forgot: The super-low prices are the only thing that's below average about this place.)", "author": "Brent C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-23", "description": "This taqueria is in the front of a grocery store. It's a pretty good and unique Mexican spot. What makes it unqiue is that offers different kinds of tortillas to wrap your burritos, quesadillas, or whatever you get. They offer garlic, chipolte, and spinach just to name a few. I'm a person who loves cheese on their burrito and they did it right. Not only was it melted, but also when I bit into it, the melted cheese came out and pulled away with my bite instead of it being clumped in with the or fillings or the tortilla. Also, they had guava jarritos there which I've never seen before and that me and my friends almost took all of. This place does have a couple of down sides. They are a little pricey compared to most Mexican spots that I have been to and they have a limit to how many salsas you can have (2) for free before they charge you despite them having a salsa bar. Although these two negatives are definitely understandable and minor because of the quality and there desire not to waste anything.", "author": "Brent C."}

Most of the other restaurants were closed because I was looking for a late night snack at 11PM.  \n\nThe first thing I discovered, it is located inside a grocery store called MID CITY.  This makes it very convenient but hard to find if you don't know what you are looking for.  The service was great, although they don't really understand English.  They understood enough to give me my order exactly how I wanted it.\n\nThe food was spectacular, and for a very inexpensive price.  The servings are huge.  So don't over order, or you will have plenty of left over's.  As for the location itself, it's a hole in a wall.  I didn't go there for the decor or ambience.

The tortilla is tasty and chewy, a perfect blend - not thick and leathery like some taquerias (Pancho's), nor thin and prone to rupture as at others (La Canasta). And it's griddled just right, browned even -- delish!\n\nSo lessee. I happen to have an El Tesoro super burrito right here. The pollo asado is fine, though my preference would be to blacken it up like Gordo's does. There are peas and carrots in these babies -- a thoughtful little enhancement.\n \nI just picked up the second half and gooey cheese dripped out. That's a burrito, mmm-mmmm good.\n\nAnd get this - they have a HAPPY HOUR for burritos! Between 3 and 5 p.m. a regular is $4 and a super is $5. Compare that to $8.60 or so with tax for a super at the overpriced El Patron a block to the west. And they have a steamer so once the burrito is in foil, they zap it so it's piping hot. You don't see that at a lot of taquerias, and it should warm the cockles of any burrito-lover's heart.\n\nMore -- there's a nice, clean salsa bar with a variety of selections. Two are green and they're legitimately spicy, and this from a guy who puts Dave's Insanity Sauce on his Cheerios. There's a pleasant seating area from which one may watch the entertaining drama that is the Tenderloin through an open-air window.
