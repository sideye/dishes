Only complaint is that sometimes the brown rice looks a bit like instant rice in terms of quality. BibimBar has been a lifesaver whenever I'm craving something more flavorful yet healthy for lunch.

Ha so smart. You choose if you want a bowl or stone bowl. If you want a stone bowl to get the nice crispy rice at the bottom, it's $1 more, but in my opinion totally worth it for that extra flavor and texture. They put the bowl on the fire to heat it. Of course, this is also if you have enough time to eat it because it doesn't stay much hotter so, if you're rushing, then a bowl is likely best. \n\nChoose your bowl, base, meat/toppings, sauce. They also note vegan or gluten free options which is cool too. \n\nWe got two orders, one order was half rice half japchae, marinated chicken, with all veggies, and medium spicy in a stone bowl.

You'll quickly notice this is one of the places with the longest lines out of the vendors in there. \n\nThey offer stone bowls and regular bowls. Regular bowls (and to-go orders) will get you through the line and out the door quickly. Stone bowls are another story. On multiple occasions I've seen people waiting around for the tone bowls to free up (they have to go pick them up from around the court, clean them, and hear them up). Needless to say stone bowls are not the way to go if you are in a hurry. But enough about that. Onto the food. \n\nEvery time I've come here I have gotten the exact same thing. The bulgogi with the japchae. It's awesome, filling, and reasonably priced. However, beware with the super spicy sauce. I would assume the overwhelming majority of the lunch patrons are on their lunch break, and assuming you don't wanna come back to your office dripping in sweat - I would stay away from the super spicy sauce. I should probably mention that I love spicy food and it wasn't necessarily the spice that was unbearable, but, but I just started to sweat profusely. The medium spicy sauce will do just fine and you won't go back to work looking like you just showered. \n\nThe stone bowls are heated and they are very cool but don't really add/take away any flavor (although they do make for some pretty cool snapchats/ IG pictures). Get it once and then get regular bowls and you'll find yourself sliding right though the line. \n\nBulgogi is really well seasoned, and it comes with a sizable amount of vegetables as well so you can convince yourself you're being \"healthy\". Pro tip: add an egg on there. Your welcome. \n\nThey have a variety of other offerings, but I honestly can't even see myself getting anything other then the bulgogi with japchae (with medium spicy sauce) because I got so hooked!

The veggies and noodles were delicious and the orange ginger sauce gave it a nice zing. I was a bit disappointed in the tofu, it was kinda mushy and lacking a bit of flavor so I did add some extra hot sauce (which was damn hot even though I got the 'mild') that flavored it up a bit.

You have a choice of brown rice, white rice or japchae for your base and then they usually give you the assortment of the basics. If you want meat, it's either $1.50 for the chicken or $2 for bulgogi. The fried egg is $1 so your meal ends up around $10 if you get everything in it. The portion sizes are fairly reasonable for lunch. You won't be hungry after you eat here but you also won't be very full if you come here while famished. A small bowl of kimchi soup comes with each order. Surprisingly, the kimchi soup may have been the best part of my meal. It was very tasty!\n\nDefinitely one of the better options at the International Food Court!", "author": "Cassie Z."}

A little Chipotle-esqe with all the starch, veggie, meat and sauce choices served in a fast casual manner.  But if you eat it in the food dungeon, you can upgrade to a hot stone bowl that will crisp your rice and keep your food warm.  Ends up being a bit cheaper than ordering dolsot bibimbap in a waiter service restaurant.\n\nKimchi Tofu Soup: More exciting than the free miso soup that Japanese places often give you.  Reminded me a bit of cabbage borscht since the cabbage flavor dominated the soup more than the pickled or spicy flavors of the kimchi.  Just enough tofu to give some morsels of texture, but nothing like a soondubu.\n\nSpicy Pork Belly in Stone Bowl: I've tried the various meats and the spicy pork belly is definitely my favorite.  It's like triple thick bacon that is mostly firm on the outside with some tender section in the center.  The spicy sauce adds a nice accompaniment and, since it's already giving you a kick, you can feel free to order a not-so-spicy sauce at the end like orange ginger.  The raw veggies (carrots, red cabbage) were crisp and fresh while the pickled and cooked veggies each had their own nice flavor and texture profile.  I was partially tempted to eat each one separately, but then that notion passed and I mixed it all together per usual.  With the stone bowl I like to have a thin layer of white rice on the bottom, so it gets nice and crispy, and then some slimy (in a good way) sweet potato noodles on top.  The staff seems happy to oblige my quirky starch order.", "author": "Adam B."}

When I heard that the tofu wasn't ready, I told her to omit it out but it seemed like she didn't hear me or just ignored me. When I got the food, I noticed the meat was beef and told the cashier that the wrong meat was put in. So the cashier said she would remake it for me and was kind about it. However the other lady seemed a bit peeved that she had to remake something that she had originally put in wrong in my bowl. I may come back but I'm not sure and I'm not in the city too often.

I had to choose between the Filipino place and BibimBar but obviously went here and didn't regret it at all.  I got the dolsot bibimbap with pork belly.

For about $10 I got lots of seasoned pork belly (and it's not too much fat), fresh veggies, sliced egg and rice.  Not much of my rice got crispy though unfortunately.  Despite me getting the pork belly, I feel like it was a pretty healthy lunch, and you can even opt for brown rice and no extra charge.  But everything had lots of flavor from a \"food court restaurant\" and is one of the better dining options in the area.  My friend always goes with the hot stone beef.

It was a nice gesture from her as I never asked or expected it. We were going to \"The Dungeon\", a downstairs food court at corner of Bush Street and Kearny Street. When I go to \"The Dungeon\" I go to Foogle to buy lunch. This was my first time I went to BimbimBar. The concept for your lunch bowl is you order either rice or noodles, choose of meat, and select a sauce. I wasn't sure what to order since this was my first time. On the counter there was a sign of a new item - J Bap, which is sunny side egg, rice, pulled beef, and American Cheese. I ordered this dish because like Anthony Bourdain I'm an egg slut. I liked almost everything of the dish. The mixture of rice and American cheese had a texture of macaroni and cheese.  I love that the egg was sunny side up instead of over easy as yolk tends to be creamier. When you break the egg yolk and eat it with rice and cheese the texture is similar to a risotto. I liked everything except the pulled beef. In general I don't like pulled or shredded meat because the quality it possess. I think pulled pork is overrated because it tends to be flavorless or dry. When it comes to nachos I never order shredded chicken because it makes the dish watery. There's a difference between when the meat is moist or eatery. Moist meat brings out the flavor of the meat while watery meat makes the meat flavorless. For the dish I ordered the pulled beef not only was flavorless but watered-down the dish. It turned the creamy egg yolk into a soup. If I do come here to eat again I'll make sure I'll order a meat that isn't pulled or shredded.", "author": "Gerald R."}

I have to admit when I was a young FiDi pup back in 19-none-of-your-business, I used to come down here all the time, health code violations be damned. It was cheap eats for someone who was barely scraping by as an assistant media planner. Now all these years later, the place pretty much looks the same except BibimBar looks much fresher than the other kiosks. The concept is pretty simple - it's Chipotle meets bibimbop.\n\nIt's like the Chris Brown and Rihanna of the International Food Court without the black eye. Actually they call it \"The Fresh Korean Salad Bar\" which is apt since most of the ingredients in my dish were cold. In true Chipotle fashion, you first order your \"style\" (Bibimbop for me, of course), then your base (Brown Rice 'cause I'm watching my girlish figure), your topping (no question in my mind...Spicy Pork Belly along with a bevy of shredded veggies) and finally your sauce (upon the recommendation of the server, the Bibim Spicy...whatever that is). The $8.95 result was quite a large bowl of good-looking ingredients (see photo).\n\nHowever, I have to admit I was disappointed that the only ingredient that approached lukewarm was the pork belly, which was on the slightly burnt side since I arrived after the lunch rush. In hindsight, I think my lesson learned here was that I should have gone for the Bibim Hot Stone for the extra dollar in order to get a fighting chance at a hot bowl. Otherwise it was much more like a big salad as billed. I also received a complimentary bowl of the Spicy Shrimp Soup which was a nice warm treat to offset the bowl. I would definitely give it another try with the hot stone even if it does mean another adventurous journey into the dungeon.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...certainly big enough but was hoping for something warmer and a bit spicier for lunch\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...it's like that scene in \"The Dark Knight Rises\" when Christian Bale is trying to get out of that prison pit\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...friendly enough\nTOTAL - 3 stars...bibimbop go boom just a little", "author": "Ed U."}

My friend and I made the mistake of not ordering our food in the hot stone bowls, so by the time we got to the bottom of our bowls, not only was it cold, but I was sorely missing my \"crispy\" rice I usually get.  Won't happen again, that's for sure.  It's awesome that they also offer japchae noodles as an alternative, but you can also mix that with white/brown rice!

Pretty amazing, they've got 6 restaurants down here...\n\nThe bibimbap bowl is HUGE, for $9. Your base comes with white rice, brown rice, japchae, or a combination of those three. Then veggies are piled on top, followed by your choice of meat. Add a 2nd portion of meat for $1 extra. Comes with a bowl of tofu soup. This is all nearly enough for two meals.

Good amount of veggie mix. Rice doesn't get as crispy brown as usual, but that's prob due to the \"bar\" style of making your bowl to order. Will be coming back! Oh, free small bowl of tofu soup too!

Very efficient for the lunch crowd looking to get in/out easily. However, the Korean lady behind was quite rude to the staff and myself.\n\nThe situation:\n\nI was standing in line and there was a Korean guy 2 people behind me. I know this because the lady behind the counter asked him and he politely nodded in agreement. \n\nI get to the front of the line and it's my turn to pay. I hand the cashier my credit card, she swipes it, and is about to hand me my food. However, the Korean lady jumps in and attempts to push everything out of the way so the Korean guy can pay for his stuff first. He didn't have it pre-made or anything, I saw his bowl being prepared the same as us all. I tell her that I just paid and my bowl is sitting 2 feet from me, just hand it over and we're done with the transaction.\n\nNope, she insists that the cashier made a mistake and set my stuff to the side. I tell her I just paid and I see the guy attempt to usher me out of the way, but I hold my ground and tell her that my bowl is right in front of her. She eventually hands it to me and then let's the Korean guy pay right away...\n\nIs this even worth complaining about? Seems ridiculous, right? Of all the crap we have to put up with on this planet... this... this is what I choose to complain about, \"oh some lady wanted to let some other guy cut in front of mes\" Doesn't really matter in the large scope of things, but maybe there's something deeper going on here. I don't know, but  what I do know is that it bothered me enough to write a negative Yelp review...\n\nOk, so maybe next time I'll just tell the dickhead behind me to wait his damn turn.\n\nActual useful information:\n- The food is decent. House of Lumpia next to it is a lot better.\n- They need to reverse the layout of the food so the rice/vegetables is at the start and the meat/toppings are at the end.

The bibimbap bowls are flavorful, healthy, quick, and cheap, and the mini bowl is perfect for those days when you don't have as big of an appetite. \n\nFor the bowl, you get to choose whether you want brown rice or clear noodles (or both), your choice of meat (or tofu/kimchee for the vegetarians), and an assortment of toppings. I've had the shrimp and tofu and both are superb. Add all the toppings. \n\nThe international food court is a little odd from the outside as it's in the basement wit no grand entrance, but the area is actually really large and can host large groups for lunch. \n\nThe only reason I'm subtracting one star is because they're often out of the clear noodles.

The bowl is $7.50 which comes with your choice of sauce and starch (rice, brown rice, or noodles).  An assortment of vegetables comes with it too.  Meat, eggs, kimchi, etc.. are considered add-ons and range from maybe $1-$3 EACH.  So I would considered this place $$ not $ - it can get pricey, but does not have to be.  The lady was very nice and super friendly.  She gave us some pork belly to try, which was really good - better than the bulgogi.  The portion is actually really good for the price.  You will be stuffed!  Since this place is in the international food court, everything is prepared already.  They just grab everything and throw in a bowl.  I really enjoyed the food and found it to be delicious and would definitely come back.  I recommend you guys to go check it out!  The service is 5/5 - the lady is very sweet!

It's less spicy that hot cheetos.  And pretty good, so you might want to try it (unless hot cheetos are too much for you).\n\nOh, and they give kimchi on the side now.
