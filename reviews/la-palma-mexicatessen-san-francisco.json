As others have mentioned this is part grocery store part taqueria.  The best part is that some of grocery items are freshly made - tortillas, gorditas, huaraches, chicharron, masa, etc.\n\nUpon entry I made a bee line for the fresh tortillas on the counter in the back.  I picked up a pack of the chicken huaraches, beads of condensation still present on the inside of the bag and warm to the touch.  I also picked up a bag of their tortillas.  \n\nOn my way to the cashier up front to pay I passed by the display of chicharron and stared at the jewels of pork meat and skin inside.  They were not labeled so I asked the cashier what was available and she told me they had meat with fat, meat and meat with skin.  I asked for a half pound ($9.99/lb) of the meat with skin but wish now I had purchased one pound.  They were quite good and did not contain chunks of fat, but just relatively moist meat and crispy skin.   I've had super dry and stale pork skin before that made me cough and choke when swallowing them and these were NOT anything like that.  They were delicious!  They were almost like Chinese roast pig but the chicharron had different seasoning and were deep fried.  I would definitely come back for these.  For leftovers, they were easy to heat up and softened up a bit (skin was crispy but not rock hard) after 10 minutes in the toaster oven.\n\nI tried the tortilla as soon as I returned home and it was thick, chewy and flavorful.  I ate it with some pork chile verde and liked how the tortilla held up pretty well to the wet filling.\n\nDuring my visit to La Palmas the store was relatively empty with a only couple of other patrons there.  The cashier was friendly.   A few tables are available outside for those that wish to dine there.  Parking was generally pretty easy during my visit at noon on a weekday.", "author": "Melissa L."}

I wanted goat meat,hence the Sunday visit but they were out. But I did not learn that for a while because most of the people taking the order do not speak English and my Spanish is limited to \"gracias\". I tried to say what I thought was goat...birria or something like that. Nope wasn't working. I felt like I was talking to customer service at Century Link, an internet provider back in Ohio. Communication after \"super\" and \"burrito\" ceased. All I wanted was goat and no cilantro and put on what everyone else gets. Finally someone else steps up and says goat was sold out. This place is a 45 min trek on 2 busses.  I have to get something and it sure won't be tripe or brains! Al Pastore...I remember that is some sort of pork.  That's it.

Not much seating either but you can eat at the park or somewhere else nearby. \n\nHighly recommend the sopes. I got the chicharon sopes and it had chunks of crispy pork, some hot sauce, taco sauce, a little cheese and lettuce. At first I ate it with a fork but then decided to just pick it up and go for it. Such an amazing mix of flavors, this is awesome. Definitely order this.  \n\nPupusa: I tried the pupusa revuelta which has pork, cheese, and beans. They serve this on a disposable plate with a bag of slaw like stuff and some hot sauce. I definitely liked the sope more as it had much more flavor but after dipping the pupusa in the sauce, I found it to be good also. I think if you eat this the \"authentic\" way- hot and topped with the vinegar and cabbage slaw this would be better. It was still pretty good, not the best I've had but enjoyable. I'd order two sopes in the future though instead of one of those and one pupusa. \n\nBurritos: The burritos are alright though definitely not the best I've had in the Mission. If you really want a burrito and nothing else, I would go somewhere else. They aren't bad by any means though so if you come here to get other stuff and want a burrito, it is a convenient option.  \n\nIt's also a store and they sell masa you can make pupusas and sopes and what not at home. You can even buy the meat and other ingredients here and just assemble everything together at home. \n\nPrices are awesome, you can get a lot of food for not a lot of money. The food isn't super spicy which I like but if you do like more spice you may want to bring your own hot sauce. Also note it's not really a restaurant so don't expect a lot of seating or anything. On a nice day, you can take your food and walk around the neighborhood or eat at the park. \n\nI'd probably give them five stars for the sopes alone and four stars for everything else.

Al pastor is usually cooked with pineapple juice but it was really strange when I got a whole chunk of pineapple in my burrito! Overall, the burrito was mediocre and really dry. \nMy coworker got a vegetarian burrito and it had broccoli and carrots in it?! The menu says the vegetarian burrito is the same as the super burrito without meat. Not even close, it lacked guac and sour cream and he definitely was not expecting there to be broccoli and carrots in his burrito. Another coworker got a regular burrito and asked to add sour cream and salsa in it. When he got his burrito, it didn't have either so he went in to ask for sour cream and salsa on the side. The employee states that the regular burrito doesn't come with sour cream and salsa and claims my coworker never asked for it, but ended up reluctantly giving it to him.\nThere are so many other great options in the area for Mexican food, I'll pass on coming here next time.", "author": "Emily L."}

La Palma does a nice job packing the catered food to go. Everything came wrapped in tin foil containers so it was easily transportable. \n\nThe only feedback I'd give is the process it took to place the order. Terry was extremely helpful but not super responsive to email. It wasn't always convenient to call during the work day. We played phone tag a few times and when we finally spoke some minor follow up items were not fully confirmed, so I had to call again. I understand they are super busy.

Visiting some friends who live in the Mission, they told us that this was their go to spot for cheap, authentic, filling Mexican eats. Sign me up.\n\nSeating is first come first serve on a few tables outside. You order inside, wait and hope a table outside will be open. I went with the suggested roast chicken burrito with spicy beans and guac. This is what dreams are made of. This is why I moved to California. The burrito was oh so smooth with a delicious homemade tortilla, tender roast chicken and creamy beans and rice. Yes! Everything about this was fresh and just so damn good. Room for improvement? Always. I wish it was a bit more spicy and that goes with the burrito overall. However, this was my first and only time visiting, so I need to revisit often to check out other menu items.\n\nThe man loved his roast chicken tacos, which in hindsight I think I'd get next time for a less heavy meal and one that focus on that roast chicken. Home made chicharonnes and other Mexican delights make this spot a must visit when on the search for authentic eats. \n\nA few other things: \nLooking for hot sauce? You have to buy the whole bottle if you want to sprinkle it on your burrito. Boo.\nLooking to host your own taco party? You can buy everything by the pound. Carnitas meat to go, a lb of that guac or roast chicken, or a pint of beans. Buy it and bring it home and eat at your leisure.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

I was in search of a better place for some delicious mexican food!\n\nLa Palma is awesome! Their food is super delicious, and usually fast. The customer service is okay, but honestly their prices and food is what keeps me coming back. \n- The flauta plate was delicious, their quesadilla suiza was okay, it was a little too greasy for me. \n- The breakfast sandwich is tasty and will keep you full forever.\n- The huaraches are very good and are freshly made in the morning! I like buying a pack of that and salsa and eat it with over easy eggs and lettuce and call it a day!\n\nHere are a few tips:\n- It is a really tiny spot and inside is all retail, there is seating for eating outside around the corner, as well as standing tables right upfront. So don't plan on dining fancy while you're here. \n- If you can take public transportation or just walk. It's in the mission, on 24th, near Potrero, so finding parking is nearly impossible during day time. \n- La Palma is a grocery store as well, so it can get hectic and crazy busy at times. \n- They have 3 counters which can get a little confusing, but the one all the way in the back on the right is where you place your order, the counter closer to the door, where they sell various chicharron is where you pick up your order. \n- They accept cards!\n- If you know what you want, call ahead! The food is usually ready in 10-15 minutes and all you have to do is go to the first counter on your right and pick up and pay!", "author": "Jade C."}

My waiter at The Progress restaurant suggested it to us so I looked it up and saw a lot of positive reviews and man it didn't disappoint. In Chicago the best places for Mexican food are little hole in the wall mom and pop places some have been there for many many years. This spot seemed like that had the same feel, located in the mission district an old part of town it seemed, me and the wife hit it up early first meal of the day, good thing because this place gets packed and we got there before it did. No tables inside just about 4 outside 1 of them a stand up one, man this food was so legit! Homemade tortillas out of the tortilla maker, they even sell them there. Little grocery store inside, I ordered the mission style burrito ( they put rice and pinto beans inside in Chicago no rice and the beans refried ) delicious the steak inside was full of flavor, my wife ordered deep fried tacos with beef served with cabbage cheese and a chipotle style salsa, with some chicarron on the side too we shared. Food was so good I went back inside and ordered two more steak tacos to try on their homemade tortillas and those were bomb! Very memorable experience food wise, had a atole too ( Mexican hot  chocolate ) this was ok have had better. Saw the menudo and Pozole, and the guisados cant wait to visit again and eat here so I could try those next.

The taco itself was decent, we got the chicken but I didn't think it was too memorable. Mostly, the experience was overshadowed by the confusing chaos in the store. Not sure if it was an off day, although the customers were pushing around the store as if this was the norm. There are 3 stations: one to order, one to pay, and one to pick up your food. This did not speed up the process as it should-- instead, it seemed like it confused the employees even more on who ordered what. It took us ~20-25 minutes to pick up just one taco. The time we were there, we just stood at the side observing it all. There were two orders switched, one lady hadn't received her food and was complaining, multiple orders had to be remade because the customers never got their food, and we saw the employees call out for at least 5 orders that no one claimed. \n\nI would try it again during a time that isn't so busy, I guess.", "author": "Hideko T."}

I could have eaten this alone with salsa and be a happy camper; it was THAT good!\n\nAs far as the filling, the chicharron was very sparse. The heat from the seasoned rice and refried beans softened the chicharron causing it to lose its crackling crunch so it tasted more like salty pork jerky.\n\nI also bought a tub of Salsa de Guacamole. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bNvaWa9wSLHjlFlrD7i9Ow?select=3-VodcFXM5OxqpO-JohmoA The salsa de guacamole was like an avocado cream that was seamlessly thick, rich and buttery; perfect as an accompaniment if you want to add a buttery layer. My only gripe is I wish there was more of a citrus (i.e. lime) component to brighten up the flavors.  \n\nNext time, I'm going back just for the chicharron and the harina tortillas so I can make my own chicharron soft tacos.

Chili Rellano is a tender pork that comes in large chunks, wish they used more meat. But overall, very wholesome and filling, just one is enough to fill the hungriest person up!\n\n* Quesadilla Suiza with Chicharron ($6) - Unlike Taqueria Cancun's, this place serves the lettuce, sour cream, and other toppings on the side. If you like that semi crispy / chewy texture of chicharron, you definitely need to order your item with chicharron. It's a good deal, and a large portion, but not quite as gigantic / cheesy / meaty as the ones at Cancun, which obviously is the bar for Mexican Food in the Mission.\n\nI got both of these for less than $12 after tax (they accept Visa and Mastercard), what a deal!", "author": "Jess C."}

One taco was a handmade corn tortilla ($2.99) and I also got a Tacos Dorados (crispy shell, $4.99). There are more ingredients inside the Tacos Dorados, and the corn tortilla is more of a basic taco. I'd have to say I loved the corn tortilla more, since there was less going on. I felt like I could taste the meat more in that taco, compared to the tacos Dorados. \n\nWe also shared a papusa (but mostly my bf ate it, since I got so full from the tacos!), which was pretty good. We ended up eating everything, so yes it was delicious!\n\nYou go in there and order, like a deli. There is some seating outside, and some stand-up tables as well.

Needless to say, we were not disappointed. La Palma Mexicatessen proudly delivers authentic Mexican cuisine to San Francisco and does it damn well.\n\nAmbiance:\nDon't expect much - it's a very small and cramped shop combining a grocery store and a takeaway restaurant at the same time. You have multiple checkout stations so it could be a bit overwhelming and confusing at first, but easy to pick up. Look to the side of the establishment if you're looking for a place to sit and chow down.\n\nCustomer Service:\nReally great actually! From a dingy authentic restaurant, you usually trade in good customer service in exchange for a banging meal. However, La Palma Mexicatessen maintains a friendly attitude. Your food comes out pretty efficiently as well.\n\nFood:\nMy boyfriend and I ordered 2 Burrito Supers - your choice of meat, rice, and beans, filled with guacamole, sour cream, cheese, cilantro, and onions. You could also request it to be spicy. We ordered the burritos with carne asada and no regrets. This burrito was kickass and super filling. One bite into the hot mix of fresh ingredients and wonderful flavours and we were in heaven. You have plenty of other meat options as well if you're not that huge of a fan of carne asada (god forbid) - al pastor, chile verde, colorado, carnitas, milanesa, tripitas, and even... tongue?\n\nI have to admit that I didn't know what the vast majority of these were and tasted like, so if you're a newbie to Mexican food and not feeling that adventurous try the Carne Asada or Al Pastor.\n\n---\n\nThe journey to find La Palma in the heart of Mission District was definitely worth it. Great customer service and a delicious burrito worth every penny - it's no wonder they rock that \"People love us on Yelp\" sticker.", "author": "Clarissa Y."}

I ordered a chicken taco with their handmade corn tortilla and an horchata.  I think their handmade tortilla is THE best tortilla I've ever had next to being homemade.  I had the option of getting roasted chicken, but I think next time I'll get marinated chicken.  The roasted chicken was delicious, but I think the marinated chicken would've gone well the the black beans, onions, and the cilantro that were in the taco. The horchata was good too, and very sweet.  I wanted to try a strawberry tamale, because I've never heard of it before, but they ran out.  I got, instead, a corn tamale, which was heavy.  I wish there were whole kernels in the tamale.  I also wish they told me they ran out before I purchased it since the corn tamale was cheaper.  Even when my roommate tried to order a cinnamon tamale, they suggested a strawberry one.  They need to be informed as to what the inventory is.\n\nOtherwise, I'm definitely coming back and ordering sopes because the one my roommate got looked so good and she enjoyed it.", "author": "Vira P."}

My friend mentioned to the worker behind the counter that we were splitting the burrito. She offered to cut it in half. Then my friend went to pick up the burrito from the counter and noticed it was not cut.

The Mexicatessen is known for their hand-made tortillas, Pupusas, Tamales, Rotiserrie Chicken and other yummy foods such as Tortas, Tacos and \"Burritos\". \n\nSurprisingly, I have yet to try the shop's burrito.

And because the shop make their own line of flour tortillas, I might do that very soon.\n\nAs I was standing in line for some items to take home, I saw a lady dumping a fresh bucket of Chicharr\u00f3n (pork rinds) inside the warmer. The lady told me they were fresh and just cooked. For $6.99 per pound, I took a half of pound for a later snack. \n\nThe later snack didn't last long, less than two minutes to be exact. As soon as I got to my car and the bag of the pork rinds were still hot,  I had to take a bite of the treat. With the crispiness of the outer layer and the mixture of the pork's fat and lean meat make this treat explosive. Despite being a little fatty and salty, the treat isn't good for you. But it's \"GRUBBIN\"\n\nIf you're watching your diet, the fresh pork rinds is not a treat you can eat everyday.

Today I stopped by to buy some carnitas meat, chicharrones, huaraches with chorizo, arroz y frijoles refritos.

I went to the counter, paid for rice, beans, huaraches with chorizo (delicious by the way), 1 coke & 1 flan-$24.00, then a minute later I was asked to pay again (with a credit card for both transactions by the way) for the meat...?? Really?? Okay, anyway I paid, another $22.00-wow!

You haven't had a full Mission experience until you've had La Palma.\n\nHands down, La Palma makes the Mission's best burritos, pupusas, tacos, and whatever else can be made. Don't even try to argue with me about how La Taqueria makes the best tacos or how El Farolito makes the best burritos. Pound for pound, everything coming out of La Palma will knock out the competition. As an added bonus, all of the tortillas and tacos are made fresh to order so you'll never have to wonder if that bag of tortillas has been sitting on top of the steam machine for weeks or months at a time.\n\nWhen you get here, make your way to the register in the rear in front of the menus to order. The front registers are usually for buying groceries and other items. Bear in mind that this place is quite cramped, but this will give you time to really appreciate all of the Mexican goods that you never knew existed. If you run through the menu and still can't decide on anything, I suggest grabbing a super burrito with your favorite meat or some of the handmade tacos. Both will satisfy you like no other. The burritos just taste better with the fresh tortilla. They're just softer and more moist. And the tacos actually taste like tacos! We're all used to the steamed premade taco tortillas that most taquerias use. At La Palma, the fresh taco tortillas actually have some bite to them and don't fall apart on the first bite. For once, my tacos end up in my mouth and not on my shirt.\n\nBest part of La Palma? The 'exotic' meats like lengua and buche taste way better than the 'standard' carne asadas and pollo. Most taquerias half-ass the meats that aren't big sellers since they know not a lot of people will be eating them and they might just end up wasted. At La Palma, everything tastes good and every meat is shown just as much care as any other. I realize this sounds a little overly sentimental but settling for poorly cooked meat is just a travesty.\n\nSo, do yourself a favor, stop at La Palma and grab a bite.

I love seeing them transform a ball of dough into a tortillain one second with their magical tortilla press.   I had the following today:\n\nVeggie Huarche (3.00)  Lots of shredded cabbage, onions, and cilantro on top of an oval tortilla filled with beans/cheese.  It was very much like a pupusa but with veggies on top.  Pretty good but kinda boring.\n\nPupusa (almost 2.29 each)-- I had one with cheese/beans.  The cheese is really aromatic but the texture of the pupusa was too thick and doughy.  I prefer ones with thinner skin and that soaks up the sauce.  The tomato sauce here tastes exactly like watered down ketchup!  That is not good.  I do like their cabbage mixture that goes on top of the pupusa.  I weren't buy their pupusas again.\n \nTacos (3 dollars)--  I had a tongue taco and they were very generous with the meat and there were lots of garnishing.  The fall apart chewy handmade shell gave it a very authentic and fresh twist.  I like it!  My partner enjoyed his with pork skin taco (there are three kinds of pork skin here).  One of the pork skins offered here has a good deal of meat still on it and all of them are 6 dollars a pound.\n\nNacatamale (3 dollars)-- pork tamale with all the trimmings.   It's about two pounds of pork, RICE, masa, green olives, tomato paste, and potatoes.  Greasy, acidic from the tomato paste, and just plain comforting!  Make sure you have this with something light like veggies because it's a bit too rich by itself.\n \nLa Palma is in a nice quiet area of the Mission.  It's difficult to find parking but it's a nice place to get some really fresh and high quality Mexican food.  You can feel their pride when you walk in because it's a clean place that is run efficiently.

However, the buildup of oils and the sudden desire to be on an exercise bike midway through the burrito made the second half more difficult to finish.

This was my fifth burrito/taco meal I've eaten in a week!\n\nLa Palma Mexicatessen is store/restaurant (take-out orders only).  They close at 6pm (5pm on wknds) so unless you're in the area during the day, you're SOL.  \n\nLuckily, I happened to be in the neighborhood today and got a chance to check it out.  La Palma is known for its homemade tortillas and it was good to see that they sell these separately.\n\nYou order in the back, pay in the front and wait for your food in front as well.\n\nI got the super burrito with carnitas.  They have specific tortillas (flour, whole wheat, cactus).  I got the cactus kind b/c it sounded interesting and I also got a chicken tamale.\n\nThe burrito definitely has some heft so you won't be disappointed if you're looking for something substantial.  I'm not sure if they got the order right with mine because the pork pieces were rather large and not the seasoned, browned pork that I normally associate with carnitas.  But after my first bite, I didn't really care as the large chunks of meat were very tender and of good quality.   \n\nWhat was interesting though was first time that I can remember, I think the tortilla in the burrito overshadowed the meat and filling inside.  The tortilla is soft but has some substance so that it won't break and make a mess.  Typically, I don't look forward to the last bites of a burrito where it's all just carb-heavy tortilla where it's been folded in.  But in this case, that was the best part!\n\nThe tamale was just ok.  The chicken was dry and the tamale itself paled to the burrito.

You walk in on the left next to the counter and there is a guy at the far end on the right who will take your order. You then proceed to either the guy on the right in the back or one of the two registers in the front of the store to pay. Its really confusing and crowded so hopefully this will help first timers. After you pay at one of the three stations you proceed to the register closest to the door near the front to pick up your food. \n\nNote they will call your number form the back, the front, the side, from all over. The pick up spot is the place in front however. Keep your receipt to in order to pick up your food. \n\nThey get minus one star though because hey I get it I am a white girl sorry for living, but just like other people complain all the time about being treated differently it happens to us too. I wasn't sure of where to pay etc since it was my first time in there and I didn't understand the system.

I say, choose the shop/restaurant with the biggest line, and that's how we came across La Palma.  The shop was packed with people buying fresh tortillas, masa, meats, and hot prepared items.  There were so many delicious items, many of which I'm not familiar with but were dying to try ( I was staring at a big pan of chicharrones at the deli and drooling).  \n\nWe ordered a couple of pupusas and an El Salvadorian tamale.  The tamale was wrapped in a plantain leaf rather than a corn husk (which is used in Mexican tamales).  The plantain leaf gives a different but delicious aroma to the masa.

It is such an overlooked part of San Francisco. It was my first time driving through Mission (and actually paying attention to my surroundings) there is just so much culture and diversity all jam packed into a few blocks. Also Dynamo Donuts is there as well. \n\nSo La Palma Mexicatassen. I should mention do NOT park on Mission St. itself. Turn off into a block and park somewhere there... It's much easier to park and leave... And not risk getting sideswiped by an anonymous! \n\nFor the price, and the burrito... WOW. BEST burrito I ever had. The amount of meat is ridiculous. This burrito is just filled with so much meat, I'm complaining that there isn't enough beans and rice! Love their carnitas, their chicken is just okay. Also the tamales really suck for some reason.... It is the opposite ratio of their burrito. It's like 80% masa (am I spelling it correctly? Forgive me, I have long forgotten Spanish since my high school days) the flour part, and 20% meat. And they were quite expensive, so SKIP tamales and get a delicious handmade tortilla (you can see them make it in the back!) AND buy their fresh salsa in the fridge on the side. Also you can taste their divine cheese they have at the back behind the register in the front where you pay. This woman who was in front of me said she drove all the way from Daly City to buy this cheese. I have no idea what it's called besides blanco queso (which means white cheese) but I am shocked, I love it. It is really fresh and crisp. You can definitely taste the difference. \n\nI would say run inside the store, order your burrito, run out safely to your car and drive off a reasonable distance and enjoy.

But if there is a table occupied entirely by white people, it is deemed unacceptable.\n\nThe arrival of the \"other white people\" to either restaurants or vacation spots instantly means that lines will grow, authenticity will be lost, and the euphoria of being a cultural pioneer will be over.\n\nSo yea- this place is an AUTHENTIC mexican joint on 24th thats for sure. My gringo authentico meter tells me so and I must say that makes it exciting in itself. The menu is in spanish not english (sweet!). When they yell out your number, its in spanish not english (the food here must be amazing!).\n\nIf you want to have some fun, take your friend who isn't from California and doesn't speak a lick of spanish and watch them tremble in terror as they try to figure everything out and place an order.  They place will confuse the shit out of them and make them very uncomfortable.\n\nAlright onto the food. This is just for tacos nothing else. They DO make their own tortillas in the back (bonus) but you know what? These were tasty I admit but really thick and by the time I took my to go order back to where I was eating they were also soggy (perhaps this is my fault). I'm also not a huge fan of the carne asada. Its fine, nothing special though. You can find meat and salsa and cilantro better than this in the mission (If I catch you putting beans on your taco I will kick you in the balls, or the...well...you will get kicked in the crotch region)\n\nI still say Farolito up the street on Mission and 24th kicks this places ass. \n\nMorgan gives you 3 stars...", "author": "Morgan H."}

The invitation promised food, drink, and mirth, and who are we to come up short? Since so many of the guests were in from the east coast, our goal was to provide a little bit of local flavor to the proceedings, and we entrusted La Palma with part one of that. La Palma, in a word, knocked it out of the park. \n\nI started the process on Monday by phone and followed up on Tuesday to speak with the people directly, get a sense for the place, and leave a deposit. I left feeling confident that I had made an excellent choice. They were super helpful and walked me through all the ordering (even helping me remember to think of the vegetarians!), provided me an estimate and I paid the deposit. I will say that a background in Spanish helped to talk to a few of the people, but there was plenty of English spoken by most of the people I talked to. If that sort of thing concerns you. \n\nPicked up the food on Friday afternoon at 12:30, and they were ready to go as soon as they saw me. I never caught the name of the woman who helped us out, but she and her team helped us get everything into the car, explained the additional preparation requirements for some of the foods, and offered serving advice. They even called immediately when realizing I had left one small part of the order behind that I wouldn't likely have noticed if they didn't. We ordered the A, B, and C plates, which fed the 75 people they estimated it would with plenty of leftovers for our house! Yay to tamales all week. All the food came out to just shy of $500, which sounds like a lot until you break it down. $7 a person for catering? Pretty good, I think. \n\nMost importantly of all, our guests were impressed - very happy with the food and some particularly rave reviews. I've got the same rave reviews for Paco and his crew at La Palma. They handled our business professionally, made some great tasting food, and most importantly pulled the whole thing off with no more a hassle than the four blocks we had to return to get the last set of tamales. When you're planning an event with such potential for stress, it's nice to have a business you can count on, and La Palma was that.", "author": "Ian M."}

Mexicatessen is the best way to gain an appreciation for the universe of Mexican sandwiches once you boil (or fry!) it down to its basics. \n\nWhy does La Palma call themselves a Mexicatessen? \nThey focus on Latin \"sandwiches\" (i.e. fillings bounded by bread) made out of fresh ingredients, while you wait, much like a deli would for Anglo-Judaic sandwiches. Taking that analogy further, if Kasa is the Indian Taqueria and is Apple-esque (see my review), then Mexicatessen is the Latin Katz's Deli and is very Microsoft-esqsue (complex and bewildering choices!). Phew! The Earl of Sandwich would pause from his card game to pay heed...\n\nI could barely understand the range of options, but realised by watching my friends order, that  Mexican sandwich architecture works like this:\n1) Pick a filling (some kind of meat + cheese + garnish + onions etc.)\n2) Pick any one of several outer bread shells (thin flappy, thin crispy, corn-based, flour-based, soggy, oily, fluffy, puffy, fatty, or fried)\n3) Decide if the filling goes inside, atop, rolled-within or sandwiched within the bread shell, then process by frying, grilling or smothering in liquids of varying degrees of sogginess or greasiness\n3) Execute. Add sides like chips, salsas etc. for flavor and crunch\n4) Pack into white styrofoam box. Bill. Close.\n\nMexican sandwiches include pupusas, gorditas, quesadillas, burritos and so on. Grab your boxes and retire to Dolores park, or the green medians in Bernal Heights, and enjoy!

I threw a party recently and bought ten (yes, ten!) pounds of carnitas from here, 180 handmade corn tortillas, a couple of Mexican salsas, and proceeded to have a full on Mexican gorge-fest back at the proverbial ranch.  We ate about 5 - 6 pounds of the carnitas when all was said and done several days later.  At $6 a pound, I can see why there are so many taquerias springing up, and it almost made me think I'd just make my own henceforth.  However, it turns out that having ten pounds of carnitas in one place can lead to a feeling of carnitas immersion rarely experienced.  I went at LEAST two weeks without eating carnitas, sort of on the rebound, and then tonight at Gordo Taqueria on 9th and Irving was when I finally broke through and had it again.\n\nOne more tale of glory -- my girlfriend and I went on an exploratory expedition here before the grand Carnitas Purchasing of 2007, and tried things from the back counter including a pork tamale (which I loved, had a jalapeno spanning its length inside that I didn't notice until the whole thing slid into my mouth on the first bite, and boy, was that spicy), a chicharron taco (crispy pork skin with bits of meat attached, oh yeah, this thing clogged my arteries so fast I didn't even have time to say CARNITAS, g/f says I can only eat two a year, I am counting the days), a carne asada taco (my personal fave this time around), and a carnitas quesadilla (yummmm).  All high qual.\n\nWhen we picked up the carnitas bag we also grabbed several burritos, this time I felt edificated so I got a carne asada burrito, my friend had same, and g/f had chicken.  It turns out their chicken is seriously tasty.\n\nThese guys have earned my undying love and affection.  It's tough to order since you really will do better if you know some spanish, and don't miss the number-ticket machine at the front right when you walk in.

As the bag was filled and priced, she continued pulling torts from the machine, counting and setting them aside. While they were all warm and fresh, I noticed that those in line, waiting for their number to be called for other items, would wait until the most recent bag was placed on the counter, with the other just packaged tortillas, so they could get the freshest bag.

The ingredients taste so fresh and aren't heavy as so many mexican dishes are.  The portions are humongous, so expect to have some leftovers.  Their tortillas are handmade and you can watch them being made as you order your food, the tortillas alone are enough to make the hour long bus ride worth it.

La Palma is not a sit down restaurant. There are a couple outside tables, if it's nice out, but basically, this is a Mexican grocery store with a take out part in the back. There is a sign that stresses that they use no preservatives. They make their own...everything. Their tortillas are awesome tasting, the cactus chips, the guacamole, they even make their own popsicles, which I've never tried. The burritos are big and tasty, but the best things are the papusas (bean & cheese!) and the tacos sonoras. Oh and one special pepper thing they had only one time and we've never been able to find it again. Those tacos are not the tiny things you get in other places. HOWEVER, it's not always good. For one thing, they often as not mess up our order. The order, payment, and getting the food are in 4 different places, which complicates things and clutters the store, and when everything's wrapped up in the bag it's hard to check. By the time we get home half an hour later or so, it's too far to go back when we realize we're missing some things, or this has the wrong meat, or meat when it's supposed to be vegetarian, etc. Virtually every time we go, we say ok, we're on a break from La Palma now. The next time comes around and we say hmm we were on a break, why? Then we eat there and remember. This last time, we ordered five tacos sonoras between the two of us, four carnitas and one asade. It was an easy order, so they only messed it up as they were taking it, and we received the right food. I think that was the FIRST time we got everything we've ordered, and we've been there at least ten times. But it was fatty. Often the meat is good quality, but you can't tell when, sometimes it will be poor. I did LOVE that tortilla on the taco, and the sauces, but La Palma, we're once again on a break. However, I do recommend that you come here. Especially if you want the fixings to make something at home, go here. Or, just try their various offerings, especially if you live nearby and can run back easily if you realize you're missing something. It's not often you get cheap, homemade, non preservative food. (yes, did I mention it's really cheap yay). As you can see, I'm still conflicted about this place.", "author": "Merredith L."}

The prepared foods are ridiculously delicious -- even something as simple as a quesadilla is wonderful at La Palma. If you go on Sundays, expect long lines and don't forget to grab a number as you walk in the door (the dispenser's usually to your right as you enter). If you're lucky, they'll have freshly-made huaraches (flat football-shaped corn tortillas filled with refried beans) or gorditas filled with chicharrones bagged and ready for you to carry out.\n\nNote that La Palma has a small selection of canned goods (beans, hominy, etc.) but DOES NOT carry fresh produce -- but quit yer bitchin' because there are plenty of other places nearby that do.\n\nBest Sunday morning idea ever: head to La Palma to grab supplies for a last-minute brunch with friends -- chorizo (to pan fry and scramble with eggs and a little S&P), canned black beans (to toss into a pot with jalapenos, onions, tons of cumin, and a dash of salt), and fresh salsa, queso fresco, and crema to serve on the side.

I've been wanting to try more of their stuff but  I just did not have the courage given my nearly non-existent Spanish-speaking capabilities.\n\nSo, I created this La Palma For Dummies/La Palma Survival Guide:\n\nSocial Scene:   Mission neighborhood Spanish-Speaking People, sometimes a whole family with 3 kids packed inside the store. 98% Latin, 1% white and % Asian (me).\n\nAmbiance:  Mad house. The place is so jammed pack that I was literally elbow to elbow with people. This is a shop or a grocery store, not a restaurant.\n\nService:  Friendly staff.\n\nTreats:  Handmade tortillas, fresh cheese, chorizos, tacos, burritos, carnitas, tamales, rice plates \n\nHow to order:  \n1.  Find your way to the back of the store.  You'll walk through a very narrow aisle of Spanish goods until you arrive at the huge  counter.  Grab a number from number dispensing machine.\n2.  Hold on to your number and wait for yours to be called in Spanish.  (Thanks to my Spanish conquistadores I know at least how to count in Spanish.)  Keep you eyes on the electronic number board for your number. Sometimes they don't go by that number, so just be alert.\n3.  Look at the menu board and try to decipher the menu in Spanish while you are waiting to be called.  They sell burritos, tacos, all kinds of freshly made tortillas without preservatives, pupusas, etc.  \n4.  After your number is called, you  can tell them what you want in English.  They will be able to help you.\n5.  Step aside while waiting and go people watching.  It's fascinating to watch the activities in the kitchen.  Wait patiently and be ready to wait for a long time depending on what you ordered. Going to this place is truly a culturally enriching experience.\n6.  After you get your food, don't forget your tortillas, queso fresco, freshly made tortilla chips and/or chorizo.\n7. Elbow your way back to the front of the store and pay at the register.\n8. Head to Casa Lucas one block down to get the rest of your produce to make guacamole, salsa etc. for cheap!\n9.  Or to La Victoria across the street for Spanish pastries.\n\nHelpful Hints:\n\n1.  Be polite at all times. Memorize at least these:\nCon Permiso (excuse me) and Gracias (thank you)\n2.  Bring plenty of quarters for parking\n3.  Recommend:  La Palma is well known for great carnitas.\n4. Skip: Their pupusas.  They were really hard and chewy.  Not good.  You are better off at Balompie or La Santaneca!\n\nYou HAVE to do this:  After you get your freshly made tortillas, get in your car or find a corner spot on the street, tear the bag open, eat a whole tortilla (or 2 or 3) while they are still piping hot, they will melt in your mouth. Just be careful that you are not to be mistaken that you are getting high on tortilla, not crack.\n\nNote:  If you want to skip all of these, at least the waiting part, call in you order, skip the number, go straight to the counter to get your order.\n\nEnjoy!!!!!!!!", "author": "Leah E."}

On holidays, this is where the locals line up to get their fresh masa and on any day of the week it's one of the best burritos/pupusas/breakfast burritos (if you're lucky -- they often sell out) in town.

SEEEEE! \nI finally found time where I was off and had nothing to do and I was in a good mood to go over to this place, and I am soo glad I did. First off it was very easy to find; we went on a weekday so parking was really easy. Now before going inside I informed the boyfriend (aka the chinese boy who failed spanish 1) that from previous yelp reviews there is a big language barrier, he told me to order haha. So I go into the store first thing I noticed was a big parrot coin bank on a shelf in red and pictures of Jesus everywhere (BONUS POINTS!!! In my house I have the exact same parrot but in BLUE and we are Jesus lovers too!!!). I fall in line not knowing you had to pull a number so needless to say I stood there for a good 10 minutes smiling, hoping the lady would be like \"aww what a geniune smile I'm gonna help her\", but that didn't happen. Finally found the number and waited. When I ordered the tacos it was pretty simple, on the counter it had it's picture there and it's menu number, #1, so it was simple. But get this, there is a wait...i know sucky. But come on you are waiting for delicious food. We decided to eat our delicious tacos in the car and oh my god it was amazing. It was such a simple taco chicharon, some mild sauce, jalapenos, onions, and cilantro, and DAMN it tasted sooo good. Maybe it was because of the home made tortilla, or becuase of the fried pig skin, but wow best taco yet. \n\n\nOh and on another note.\nI was like WOW this could be a great day if we also had MItchells too!

Fast forward to the present and I am now intimately familiar with La Palma and her offerings of papusas, tortas, quesadillas, chicharron and masa by the pound. They still make papusas by hand right in front of you. And they will make it without cheese if you ask, but you have to wait about ten minutes. They do take credit/debit because I've done it several times but there is a $10 limit I believe. A lot of things have changed on 24th Street.

Of course I want homemade - well, the homemade is actually a gordita or something very bready - like a pupusa almost.  Not what I was wanting - I wanted a thin tortilla.  Finally, she asked me what kind of beans and if i wanted everything - I said black and yes.

But this is definetely the place everyone goes to get masa for those homemade tamales or tortillas. The lines during x-mas and New year is around the corner! You need to DEFINITELY try their CARNITA HUARACHES its a long oval tortilla stuffed with cheese and beans and topped with carnitas, cabbage, sour cream, and  green sauce YUUUUUMMMMMM!!!!", "author": "Maria H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-08-14", "description": "I hadn't been here in many years but my SO wanted some tamales and the only ones I really like are sold at La Tapatia in South San Francisco but I live in SF and was lazy and the review on Yelp was excellent. I bought both the Mexican & Salvadoren~ean - they were AWFUL, the chicken was STALE and the masa wasn't properly cooked - two bites and into the trash - AVOID! I will never ever come back. Geez, go to Trader Joe's their FROZEN TAMALES are a thousand times better.  A-W-F-U-L! I went at noon no wonder the joint was empty. Dumpy neighborhood with tough parking. Gotta say the handmade tortillas are good though but hardly worth a trip.", "author": "alex b."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-06", "description": "This place makes the best tortillas ever.  They make them in the back. You can get them hand made if you want them a bit thicker or machine made if you want them thinner.  Their chips are also awesome.  If they're a bit soft  after a day or two, just stick them in the oven for 20 minutes at 225 F and they will be fine.  I don't know how the rest of the stuff is and I don't care.  I schlep my tortillas all the way to Oakland from this place because they are exactly like (and in some cases better than) the ones I used to get in Mexico when I was a little kid and I would go to the tortilla factory with my mom and sit with the other ladies and wait for a fresh kilo of tortillas. As for rating this place as a restaurant, anybody with an IQ higher than 60 can walk into this place and recognize it is not a restaurant.  It's basically a tortilla factory with a few other miscellaneous things.  The other things may not be as good as the tortillas but I refuse to give it less than 5 stars. The tortillas are that good.", "author": "cecilia g."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-08", "description": "This place makes hand made tortillas and sells fresh masa and a few groceries. Their huaraches are amazing, even plain. On the tortillas: yes, I get that they're handmade, but well-made tortillas, even by hand, are not supposed to be 1/4 inch thick. But, the tacos that they make there are tasty.", "author": "kirin r."}

The fresh tortillas are wonderful, and the tamales are also quite yummy. Sometimes you can find bags of home made potato chips - nice and greasy.  They also have an outstanding selection of pinatas.  The people who work there are very nice, and I really enjoy taking people there to watch the ladies in the back make tortillas!", "author": "g l."}
