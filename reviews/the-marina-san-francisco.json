I've always enjoyed my visits to this neighborhood, but, like every other neighborhood, it's not without its flaws.\n\nThe Marina is aptly named because it's home to two yacht harbors. In between these two harbors is the Marina Green which is a large, flat, expansive, and park-like greenspace that has great views of the aforementioned locations. The green is 74 acres. The neighborhood has close access to running trails such as those at the scenic Marin Headlands across the Bay (https://www.yelp.com/biz/marin-headlands-sausalito). The highlight is the Palace of Fine Arts, located on the far western edge of the Marina (https://www.yelp.com/biz/palace-of-fine-arts-san-francisco). It's beautiful and I pretty much consider it a must-see. It's one of the most iconic spots in San Francisco.\n\nFort Mason, an old army post, is also located inside the Marina. In recent years, it's been home to \"Off the Grid,\" a popular street food event with live entertainment. The event taken place every year for the last eight years on the lower level of the complex (Fort Mason Center). This year (2018), Off the Grid is taking place every Friday night, March 2 to October 26, 5pm to 10pm. https://www.yelp.com/biz/off-the-grid-fort-mason-center-san-francisco-3\n\nSpeaking of food, you can find a lot of the Marina's restaurants and bars on Chestnut St and Lombard St. These two streets run in parallel and are only a block away from one another. A place my mom (and sister) loves is Pacific Catch, a fresh/casual seafood restaurant on Chestnut (https://www.yelp.com/biz/pacific-catch-san-francisco). A relatively new dessert place I enjoyed on my last trip to San Francisco was Smitten Ice Cream, also on Chestnut (https://www.yelp.com/biz/smitten-ice-cream-san-francisco-7).\n\nWhen it comes to demographics, the Marina is predominantly white and affluent. A lot of young professionals reside here as well as new mothers. You'll likely see the latter, or their nannies (typically Hispanic), pushing strollers around while looking pretty in their lululemon pants. This neighborhood is one of the more cliquey neighborhoods in the city. It can get fratty and bro-y so if you don't like that culture, you may not like the scene here. There's also an older, active cyclist crowd.\n\nOverall and compared to other neighborhoods in San Francisco, the Marina is one of the nicer, cleaner, safer, and fancier neighborhoods. There are quiet residential streets and hopping, busy, shopping streets. If you've never been before, it's worth checking out. It's small enough so it doesn't take long if you want to explore it quickly.", "author": "Daniel B."}

I was very low-income before moving to the exact opposite environment from where I had been.  Me, of all people, the antithesis of everything the Marina is about in every way, lived two blocks from the bay, and boy did it seem my luck had changed!\n\nAfter living in awful apartments with paper-thin walls, incompetent landlords, a downstairs neighbor who hung himself, and nowhere to walk but into a smoggy landlocked sea of traffic, it was pretty awesome to be able to walk to the beach and not worry about anything for a change.  Our landlord was super chill.  I had a favorite restaurant and cafe (both extinct now) where the owners knew me & made me feel extra welcome.  At night I painted to the sound of foghorns through an old window.  I felt very lucky.  \n\nBut I also stood out, being no one's blonde trophy wife pushing a baby stroller with my rich husband's dry cleaned suits on it.  I observed a lot of those strange robots walking down my street.  And a lot of men talking WAY too loud about business deals on their phones, and over-compensating in all the material ways, to buy their trophy wives who also coincidentally talked WAY too loud, except in MUCH higher pitches with a distinct shrieky-nasally dialect native to Union Street, if that's your jam.  I got tired of using headphones, so I left and moved somewhere with normal people.  :D  \n\nIt's not my favorite place to be, but it might feel appropriate for a stereotypical white privileged ivy league frat type who doesn't comprehend much in life beyond beer and the business degree his parents paid for.  \n\nGosh that was judgy of me.  I'm sure some of them are really nice people.  Ultimately it's really just about what kind of place feels compatible with who YOU are.  I'm not super into Chestnut Street vibes overall, but Marina beach is nice and like just about anywhere, there's a gem here and there if you have a good outlook on life.  It's not the worst place, it's just not for me.  But maybe it's for you?  If Marina is your jam, that's your business.  I won't say anything.  I'll just sit here and quietly judge at a safe distance.  ;)", "author": "Pho Q."}

With my child almost always with me, I'm an instant throwaway which is okay by me; these guys are too young anyway. \n\n(I flirt with their fathers driving their immaculate Porsches and Teslas like I did tonight, ha ha). \n\nStore owners seem more attuned to bringing in window shoppers and there are more camera-toting tourists complaining that it's cold!\n\nLots of singles and young families live here, especially singles in the older, expensive 1920s apartment buildings (how do they afford it anymore?) and long-entrenched families occupy the single family homes overlooking the Golden Gate or in multi-unit buildings located on sensually curved streets with names like \"Mallorca\" and \"Avila\". \n\nWhile enchanting for a short time, the homogenous feel of the Marina sends me packing to my Western Addition neighborhood that now looks (sigh) depressingly homogenized too.\n\nMy \"expensive\" errands tend to be centered in a The Marina District, usually involving the Apple store. \n\nDining options at every price point and cuisine abound so couples, families with kids- there's a place for everyone here. \n\nWith tremendous dining and shopping options, the Marina's a great place to meet up with friends for dinner or hang out on Sunday funday.\n\nBe forewarned however, the Marina is built over the Bay on old shipwrecks and detritus from the Pan American Exposition.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-08", "description": "I fell in love with San Francisco as a kid, and this is probably the first neighborhood I really got a feel for; the first time my young mind really grasped the thought of different parts of town, with different vibes, and different character. It was the late '80s then, and SF was a different place. But I remember tooling around with family and noting the landscape, the views, the water, and how it felt different than the Mission or Castro. \n\nFast forward to the early aughts. I'm traveling a ton for work, and often finding myself near the bay area. I remember one day, doing work in Vallejo and having a particularly rough day. We called it a day early, and decided to drive across and down, and into the city for a night in the city and away from the crud we had been dealing with in that town. We came across the bridge, and found our way to Chestnut. My boss drove for almost 45 mins looking for parking. When he got frustrated, we switched seats and I buckled, turned right, and turned into a parking space. This 'hood felt like it was welcoming me as a temporary resident. We enjoyed a few meals here (a rosemary crusted chicken pot pie, some fusion noodles served from a very attractive Bosnian woman) and I locked away the neighborhood as a fave. \n\nA few years later, I was looking at possibly moving to town, and had the sticker shock of SF prices. This neighborhood isn't cheap--not than any of them are--but I realized that the spot has a lot of pluses, and everyone knows it. We didn't end up moving to SF, but I have visited constantly for the better part of the last decade.\n\nThat brings us to today. Over the last 6-8 years, I've made it a point to come to town. In the quietest times, I might be here only 3-4 times a year. In the last few, I've been spending more and more time with family and that puts me in SF much more often. While we usually spend a lot of time in other neighborhoods, the sheer amount of time in San Francisco means that I've come to spend more time in every 'hood, and the Marina is no different. \n\nHere's what I've noticed about the state of things today. First, it's a young and vibrant place. True, some might find that off-putting that you're dealing with a lot of twentysomethings running around. And it has its annoyances, as any time you get too many of a generation, their worst features become amplified. You're going to run into the bro-ey dudes. And you're going to be awash in yoga pants. I wish this was just a bad stereotype, but I went for a walk here one Saturday morning, and decided to count. I saw 52 females, and 49 of them were in yoga pants. Two others were tourists in jeans, and one girl *may* have been a tourist but was with a dude and they were a little more dressed up; she was in a skirt. But pants-tracking aside, if the worst problem you have is that people have a lot of male friends or they like to stay fit, your neighborhood is doing pretty well.\n\nIn fact, that's one thing that's really great. I fell pretty darn safe in this part of town. It's relatively clean. Parking isn't horrific (but it ain't great, especially near any kind of commerce). All those young folks mean that you do have some somewhat affordable and healthy food options. I love the shopping on Chestnut and Union, and even though it all gets a little too precious at times, I think there are great sins in a neighborhood than preciousness.\n\nThere are loads of outdoor spaces. The Marina Green, Crissy Field, Fort Mason, big bits of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area... I mean., this is world-class stuff! Surely you can put up with the scent of Axe body spray in order to get over to the green and see views of the bridge like that! And there's the Palace of Fine Arts, the walk down to the Wharf, and plenty of other well-known spots. I like the lesser known things. I once had a bunch of folks take me to the Black Horse (tiny tiny bar!), and there are some incredible wine bars, experimental restaurant concepts, quick salad stops, small pie and cobbler kitchens, photo displays, and succulent nurseries/shops that forever have my imagination.\n\nI haven't spent enough time here, but with so many other neighborhoods to explore it makes sense. But the Marina was the first neighborhood I really fell in love with in San Francisco, and it will always have a piece of my heart.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

The last I checked the Marina was actually part of the city so we are just as \"real\" as anywhere else. It's very hypocritical that the people making the accusations are actually the ones who can't think independently and who think they are the better people/area.

I've lived in the Marina for the past year and a half, and there is a ton to love about this area (and some things to dislike).\n\nPROS\n* The fog horn at night is worth the rent alone.\n* Sunny, flat, safe.  Name me one other neighborhood that can offer all three.  You can't.\n* Parking, while not abundant, is easier than most other neighborhoods in the NE section of SF.  Never looked for more than ten minutes, outside of Fleet Week.\n* Most people claim the restaurants and nightlife aren't as top tier as other neighborhoods, and thus this is a boring destination, but they are missing the point.  This is true.  However, this is the most effortlessly easy area to actually LIVE IN.  Within five minutes-walk from my apartment, and frequently far less than that, I can get to a local grocery, butcher, drugstore, hardware store, gym, florist, deli, Apple store (this is SF, after all), bank, morning coffee, liquor store, dry cleaners, and half a dozen easy breakfast places (R.I.P. Grove, but we still have Caf\u00e9 GoLo and Balboa).  I can't tell you how easy it is to come home and accomplish all your errands so quickly and easily.  The aforementioned shops range from \"good\" to \"exceptional\".\n* The outdoor access is phenomenal.  You can easily get to Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Mason, Crissy Field, Marina Green, the Presidio, and Moscone (if you're a rec sports type).  Whether you like nature or fitness or just day drinking, the options are unlimited.\n* Views, views, views.  Hell, from my apartment alone I can see Golden Gate and Palace of Fine Arts.  On top of that, whether from illegally breaking onto your roof or from Marina Green, you can see Alcatraz, Marin headlands, even portions of the taller FiDi buildings.\n* Buildings are universally attractive and well-kept.  Lots of great art deco, Mediterranean, Italianate influences.  The apartment I live in is easily my favorite apartment ever, a studio with bay windows (and aforementioned views), hardwood floors, a separate kitchen/dining area, enormous walk-in-closet, etc.  Most of the buildings were built at the same time, and landlords here tend to have money and fix things.\n* Access to other neighborhoods is a breeze, with the 30, 22, and 47 taking you everywhere you need to go.\n\nCONS\n* Nightlife is frustratingly annoying.  Day drinking crowd is borderline unforgivable.  Not to say there aren't some great wine bars and dives here, there are, but I get it.  Still prefer it to the frat party over on Polk, though.\n* You definitely get some of the snootiest attitudes here, and if the sight of strollers and Lululemon actually makes you nauseous (grow up, but OK), then yes, there is plenty of that.\n* There aren't too many \"destination\" restaurants here, from either the foodie sense or underground gems.  The food on that level is absolutely less than the Mission, NOPA, North Beach, even Russian Hill.  There are a lot of great \"easy\" dinners and date night spots though, which is primarily what I need for the neighborhood I live in.  Tacolicious, Gamine, and Delarosa may not be topping foodie lists, but they are fun little neighborhood spots that are cheap, easy, and quick.  For special occasion dinners, we head to other neighborhoods (which is part of the fun anyway).\n* Coffee is TOUGH.  You get the best coffee at Le Marais (Stumptown), which you can't really work in, and Rapha, which is a bit niche.\n\nMISCONCEPTIONS\n* As somebody who actually lives here, I think most seem to think the obnoxious/fratty crowds that hit up the \"B&T\" spots (Eastside West, Bar None) and the \"Marina\" spots (Stock in Trade, Tipsy Pig) actually live here.  And yes, some of them do, but of the people who have moved in and out of my 18-unit building since I lived here, only one falls into that stereotype and she is one of the nicest in the building.  My building has doctors, law students, a woman who played backup for Johnny Lee Hooker, a nice young family with an infant, and a retired restaurant owner who made me tiramisu unprompted when she heard I was having a dinner party.  Much older, quieter, and \"original SF\" than most assume.  The rowdy crowd tends to head over from Russian Hill/Fisherman's Wharf/Lower PacHeights, and the snobbier crowd tends to come from the owner occupied streets nearer to Marina Green (if you're renting, you'll see the distinctions pretty quick), as well as Pacific Heights.\n\nOverall, it is far from the most \"interesting\" neighborhood in SF.  I get that.  But for when you are exhausted from work, this is the easiest place to come home too, and has far more neighborhood charm than most are willing to admit.", "author": "James S."}

With all my twisted heart and worm-eaten soul, I despise getting in my car and putting my life in other peoples' hands for upwards of 3 hours a day.  At times, it makes me feel positively homicidal--especially when Lookie McTourister pulls a dumb stunt like coming to a dead stop smack in the middle of a lane of moving traffic while his passengers beat on him (Is this the custom in your hometown of Yokelville?) or Quimby Dorkenheimer decides rush hour is the perfect time to have a chat from his parked car in the commute lane with someone on the sidewalk. \n\nSure. Right. Stop anywhere @sswipes. I've got all day. Don't be surprised when someone slams into your rear end. I only hope it's not me but I can't make any guarantees. We're DRIVING here people. MOVE IT!\n\nAnyway, perhaps the only bright spot in my commute is driving the Marina. It's usually a scene. \n\nThere are joggers: big, small, old, young, jiggly, tight, lycra-ed, cottoned, sweating, stroller-pushing, dog running, high strutting, slow loping, ear-bud wearing, checkees, and checker outers.\n\nThere are dogs: big, small, old young, playing fetch, being walked, being run, jumping at bikers, jumping at runners, walking in groups (So far the record goes to the guy walking 7. What talent!), leaving their calling cards and schmoozing the puppy parade.\n\nOn occasion there are kites being flown, mounted police clopping by, urban campers wearing backpacks, tourists in those annoying three wheeler mobiles that  clog traffic (minus 1/2 a star), gaggles of gangstas, troops of teens, farmers' market fanatics, and families out for a frolic.\n\nHere and there you'll see Hare Krishnas, la crosse chuckers, sail boat suckers, soccer ballers, tots-a-squaller, frisbee flingers, and SF swingers. You might see pretzel peddlers, ice cream vendors or hot dog hustlers. I mean there's always something cooking on the strip.\n\nIt used the be that folks who owned homes on the waterfront had beautiful displays in their windows but that seems to be less of a thing these days. Come 'on guys. It's scenic. Don't you want to add to the spectacle? If it were me, I'd have some cool artwork or floral display or SOMETHING to add. But that's just me. (Minus another 1/2 star because it used to look so much ritzier back in the day.)\n\nAND there's the famous Marina Safeway, the original MEET market, where your next date might be found squeezing tomatoes in the produce section or getting the smoked turkey sliced thin at the deli counter.\n\nAt least for roughly 10 minutes a day, my commute contempt gets diverted. I love driving the Marina.", "author": "Novato A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-02", "description": "I must admit, the sheer volume of commentary both here and across the rest of the web dedicated to publicizing one's loathing for the Marina never ceases to amaze me. Truthfully, I find it hilariously entertaining. \n\nSee, I've lived in the Marina for a few years now and I'm perfectly happy here (as happy as one can be in a city with weather that begs you to move somewhere, anywhere else). Actually, there's no where else in this self-righteous, holier-than-thou city I'd rather live. Why? Those of us who choose to live in the Marina are comfortable with ourselves, have accepted who we are and make no apology for it - Louis Vuitton bags, oversize sunglasses, red-soled stilettos, Lululemon yoga pants, foreign SUVs, blonde highlights (gasp!) and all. Many of us choose this neighborhood for reasons similar, though not identical, to the same reasons I would imagine many choose a location to call home. Outside of financial and educational reasons, we often choose a neighborhood because we can relate to the population there, we feel a sense of belonging, as it is somewhere we can \"be ourselves,\" so to speak. Myself and many of my friends chose the Marina because we found people with similar values, lifestyles, goals and preferences here. We choose the Marina because we don't feel that way in other neighborhoods - be it the Mission, North Beach, Nob Hill, SOMA, Russian Hill, the Tenderloin, any of the Richmond, or even Pacific Heights. \n\nMore importantly, I respect those in the Marina because, unlike so many hailing from other areas in this collection of misfits we call home, you won't find Marina dwellers dedicating topics on Yelp, blog posts, SF Weekly & SF Gate articles, urban dictionary definitions and commentary on all of the above to an insatiable need to declare our opinions about those from other parts of San Francisco. \n\nWe tend to respect that everyone is entitled to his or her opinion and lifestyle and feel no need to to criticize the boys (men?) who choose to wear skinny jeans that make them look more like Justin Beiber than anti-establishment, nor those who lash out against Starbucks but drop everything to buy Uncle Steve's latest creation and pay the same horrid AT&T (or, Verizon) bills that those of us \"attached to our cell phones\" in the Marina do. I won't generalize, stereotype or rely on third party sources for information about my supposed mortal enemy - the Hipster - because I assume the widely available definition of a Hipster is as laughably inaccurate as that of the Marina Girl. I would be ignorant and close-minded not to allow others to speak for themselves before classifying them based on their wardrobe and address.\n\nFinally, as a so-called \"Marina Girl,\" I: \n- am as blonde as Paris Hilton\n- carry Louis Vuitton\n- wear Lululemon because they're flattering (I am a girl, after all)\n- house my 4+ inch stilettos on black bookcases because Blahnik, Louboutin, Prada, Atwood, Zanotti and Jimmy Choo's founder are artists as far as I'm concerned\n- am a sorority girl - Kappa Alpha Theta, actually\n- never leave my apartment without makeup - call it a habit I picked up while living in Texas\n- drive an SUV (with an appalling \"premium only\" fuel economy) because well, I have to tow my boat with something\n- went to private school (is it a crime to have generous, caring parents?)\n- chose Vera Wang for my wedding (yes, I'm happily married)\n- my husband can occasionally be found on Chestnut wearing Polo shorts, collared shirts and flip flops. So what?\n- own countless pairs of designer sunglasses\n- have never held a job as a receptionist, office manager or so-called \"booth babe,\" nor anything even remotely related \n- work in Product Management for an ad tech company downtown\n- graduated cum laude over a year early\n- cannot cook because I've never really wanted to learn\n- did not vote for McCain\n- find that most of SF reeks of wanna-be diversity\n- laugh at the over-reaction to Anonymous' hacking of various government sites - they hacked the site, people, not the CIA's internal database(s), think about it\n- refuse to buy real estate that doesn't include a garage, my own laundry room and a yard\n- have never and will never consider myself \"better\" than anyone else. period.\n\nI'm simply here to suggest that some of us take a look at ourselves before we're so quick to criticize others. In the mean time, I choose 4 stars instead of 5 because living here means fighting the urge to roll my eyes when I tell someone I live in the Marina and they react with contempt or scorn and suddenly stand up straight to look down on me. I feel no need to defend my neighborhood - why would I want to encourage those who ooze disdain for, well, me, to frequent my part of town? \n\nhttp://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png", "author": "Ashley T."}

So let's get a few things straight first:\n\nThe Marina is anything North of Lombard from the Presidio to Van Ness.  Many of the Yelpers confuse it with Union Street/Cow Hollow.  That is a different neighborhood with very different people.  These people often travel to the Marina, but they don't necessarily live there.  It is similar to the difference between the people who live at Haight/Ashbury and the ones who live in Ashbury Heights.  They aren't the same.\n\nThe yoga pants, stroller pushing, Starbucks drinking, North Face fleece wearing mom stereotype is real.  They do live in the Marina. Probably because it is a nice place to raise a kid.\n\nMany, if not MOST, of the people who are the major offenders of nightlife douchbaggery don't live in the neighborhood.  Grab a doughnut and a coffee one Saturday at 1:45am and watch them pour out of the bars and begin fighting over cabs and screaming in the street.  Why? Because they don't live within walking distance.  They live far away. Maybe in YOUR neighborhood, walking amongst you, in your more enlightened neighborhood during the day, and they do it virtually undetected. \n\nWhat the Marina does have is parks that aren't full of creepy people sitting in them with blank expressions on their face.  A great neighborhood library with a somewhat respectable DVD collection that you can borrow from for free.  A place where someone can park a car and it won't get broken into just to see if there is anything good in the glove compartment.  Some decent restaurants. Close proximity to the Presidio and water front.  Nice places to exercise and play sports. A beach that isn't fogged-in all year.   Does that make it the best neighborhood in the city?  If you are into those things, then maybe.  If not, live somewhere else.   I'm just shocked by all the people who hate on it so much after going there for drinks a couple of times.  \n\nIf you don't like the Marina because \"white people\" live there, well I think it is sad that you would give someplace a bad review based on the race of the population.  You just appear close-minded.\n\nAlso, please don't write a review saying how bad the Marina is because the people there are so self-important and egotistical, and then in the next sentence talk about how much smarter, more cultured, more diverse, or just plain above those lowly people you are. Your ego is showing, and it is just as ugly as the ones that you claim to hate.", "author": "Robert F."}

She is on the constant look out for the \"right man\" who can only be replaced by \"the better man.\" The \"better man\" means he makes more money than the \"right man\" and will provide a larger diamond on her ring finger...only to find out later that he is really gay (or screwing her best friend) and this life is nothing but a bunch of shenanigans.

I think it gets a bad rap...unfortunately it does kindof deserve it.\n\nLike every other 25 year old financial services white guy who moved to San Francisco in 1996 I went straight to the marina.  Now I'll give the MetroRent guy some credit.  He tried to talk me out of it:  \"Oh, honey, you don't want to live there.  It's so homogenized and yuppie.  It's not even like  being in San Francisco.\"  Unfortunately his wrists were so limp and his lisp so heavy that it pretty much convinced me that it was the only place where I wanted to live.  I'd lived in Chelsea in NYC and wanted to get back to MY people.\n\nNow the first 8 months I was there I had the time of my life.  I lived on Fillmore between Chestnut and Lombard and was surrounded by young, drunk girls generally less than a year out of the sorority house.  At the time that was really my \"sweet-spot\" in terms of dating.\n\nI also discovered that for all it's yuppie rap the Marina had one of the finest concentrations of dive bars in the city...and I'm a dive bar aficionado.  Delaney's, Marina Lounge, the Horseshoe, Windows, Pierce St. Manor...I tried them all.  But what I really loved was La Barca.  Every Thursday they had \"Surreal Neil\" playing live, and I was the ONLY guy who knew about it.  It was literally 50-60 drunken blondes belting out \"Sweet Caroline\" at the top of their lungs...and me.  And I lived 25 feet away.  It was almost too easy.\n\nUnfortunately, better looking guys started to figure out that as lame as Neil Diamond is, a Neil Diamond cover act is a great place to meet drunken women so the odds started shifting out of my favor.\n\nThen the Marina disillusionment started to set in.  I'd go out to grab a Sunday paper and realize that there were people wearing Greek Letters on their chests.  They should really make you burn all those \"Kappa Barn Dance\" t-shirts upon graduation...I got rid of mine, gave 'em to Goodwill...still imagine the look of horror on the faces of Delta Gamma alums when they see their beloved Anchor Splash t-shirts pushing a shopping cart along Market St....but I digress.\n\nAlso, I had to be up at 4:00 AM every day...and nothing worse than a bunch of drunken bimbo's standing outside your window yelling \"I'm SOOOO drunk! woohoo!\" or crying about what an asshole Todd or Brad or Steve had been to them.  \n\nCan you imagine waking up to 5 drunk girls trying to convince their crying, drunker friend that she IS pretty and she IS skinny and she IS NOT a slut...Brad/Todd/Steve was just saying that to be mean.  It was like something out of Dante.\n\nSo the neighborhood has changed a bit in the 8 years since I've lived there.  But not that much...now I pretty much just go there to pick up on young, drunk, stupid girls just out of the sorority, because, frankly, I have a talent for it.", "author": "Jay W."}

YUP, you guessed it, residing in the heart of the Marina.  Despite of what people say and what the stereotypes may be, people have to understand not ALL are like that.   \n\nIt's like the Irvine // 90210 bubble, where you are just too comfortable within your own surroundings that you don't seem to get out of  one's comfort zone...but i guess its true, you just dont seem to wanna get out and chk to see what sf has to offer, but being the newbie i am, i have, so dont hate!\n\nMebe because I've lived through so many assumptions and stereotypes all my life... but as long as I am able to block it out and be myself, I guess it's all gravy..\n\nIt is what it is... \n\nThe MAJOR perks of living in the Marina...\n\n-walking distance to Palace of Fine Arts, Exploratorium, Crissy Field, Pacific Hgts, Russian Hill, Fisherman's Wharf/North Beach, Presidio, Marina Safeway, and a view of the infamous Golden Gate, yes, I do in fact, get a fantastic, spectacular view... but I think after checking out the Bay Bridge one evening, I have to say, I love the Bay more.\n\n-TONS of festivities throughout...\n\n-Cute lil boutiques on Union Street.\n\n-Tons of foodies to explore on Chestnut...\n\n-LOTS of fun lil bars/lounges to hop in and out...BUT I, am not the typical MARINA beb when it comes to partying.. You can most likely find me in SOMA/South Beach.\n\n-Moscone Rec - great children's park w/tennis courts, basketball court, softball field, and volleyball.\n\nSeriously, it's a great place to window shop on a beautiful, gorgeous Saturday morning, and grub on a delightful brunch on a  lazy Sunday morning.\n\n-a FREE recreational center (Moscone Rec) that's within blocks from me, with NO ASSOCIATION FEE... \n\nWhat more?\n\nThe only downfalls are  that parking can get too crazy, but it's do-able... Trust me, I ONLY leave on the weekends, and park my car throughout the week, unless I have work that is... I guess you have to know when to come and when to leave... and another thing, unlike LA/OC, I can't just walk out to my car in my boxers because I swear, everyone is seriously SO made up, just even walking a block or two... what else? Well, since the marina is literally built on landfill, if ANOTHER earthquake was to hit, like the one this past week, then, I'm the first to go... Unbelievable!  Need I say more? \n\nDamn fools. I give minus 1 star for getting a ticket the other day, RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY APT, and another star because it cost me $75! Can you believe it?! they lose another star due to the lame ass party scene, but they do have decent wine places, so I'll let that one slide, so minus 2 stars due to the parking issue.\n\nI couldn't be happier. If I had another chance to pick a place and live, I SO would pick the Marina in a heartbeat, and if I made a leetle more $, I'd actually make it over to South Beach and settle in one of the Brannan Towers, check that review. There's a high chance I will be move next year, so long Marina, you have been too good to me.. =)\nAnd since you're here, why don't you click on my LIST section, I made one JUST for the MARINA (the secrets to a easier lifestyle) and just give me 3 more months, so I can compile a Marina version of the shit list...  kudos! \n\nIf you ever plan on moving to SF, this is for the ladies, this place is DEF a great starting point because it HAS EVERYTHING (bars/lounges, facials, boutiques, foodies, spas, EVERYYYYYYTHING!)", "author": "Jennifer S."}

I think the Marina is perfectly situated in a great part of the city, with a lot of great views and a panoramic Northern exposure that other San Franciscans secretly envy.\n\nThe Marina is not as bad as people make it out to be.  Like many of you, I don't like the \"scene\" there, and it's quite disturbing that Chestnut street has so many nail and beauty salons.\n\nWhat?  People spend all day shopping in overpriced boutique stores and getting their hair and nails done?\n\nWhy yes indeed.  Welcome to the Marina.\n\n+2 stars for limiting the number of high-rise buildings in the neighborhood.  Let's hope it doesn't go the way of SOMA with the ugly Rincon tower and the Transbay Terminal skyscraper on the way.\n\n+1 star for the Exploratorium, a great place for kids and school trips.\n\n+1 star for the Marina Green, a nice open space for even non-Marina people to hang out and watch the fireworks.\n\n+1 star for being conveniently located near Fort Mason, Fort Point and Chrissy Field.\n\n-1 star for being located on landfill that buckles whenever there's a major earthquake (which thankfully doesn't happen every day).\n\nOne final comment:  At least Marina people are upfront about who they are, which I can respect.\n\nThey accept, and are in fact proud of being stroller-pushing, fresh-juice-drinking, German-car-driving yuppie scum.\n\nThat's gotta count for something :)", "author": "Justin C."}

Chestnut St. (the part of the Marina most of you will visit) is home to some of SF's best people-watching.\n\nAs for the people, that's why I knock off a star. There's definitely a certain fresh-out-of-college yuppie-in-training demographic that flocks to the Marina, but I tend to prefer the setup in NYC, where that crowd tends to disperse throughout the city (probably out of necessity due to high rents). As a result, since they don't dominate any one neighborhood, they're forced to integrate better into city life. \n\nIt's the opposite of the Marina, where they seem to have assembled a critical mass that makes the neighborhood seem at times like an overgrown college town, especially at the bars at night or on weekend mornings when people actually venture out in pajama pants and/or fluffy slippers.\n\nSometimes, growing up and moving on isn't such a bad thing.", "author": "S R."}

Plus the Palace of Fine Art, the Exploratorium, the Golden Gate Bridge and Fort Mason are there. That is some solid neighborhood cred right there.\n\nAnd the Marina used to have some solid street cred itself, back in the 60's. There are some old school establishments here that my dad still loves to point out and tell me about the time my uncle got drunk and crashed into a telephone pole. So I posit that it isn't ALL LA trendy.\n\nUnfortunately, because it is so pretty and everyone wants to live here, (and if you haven't thought about it for even a second, I say you haven't seen the view on a sunny cloudless day. That or you have no soul) it is the people with money, and consequently attitude, that live here.

The bars... well there are a FEW hidden gems, but for the most part nothing worth mentioning.  \n\nTransportation is great. Since I like the drink I must travel outside of my zip code to enjoy it.

It was full of normal people, fairly diverse for the City, had a street car line and a 24 hour fitness.  It had truly started to turn back into a middle/working class neighborhood.  The bad is at times it could get a little rough, cars were frequently broken into, and there was always the probability of someone spinning donuts in the intersection or 5 squad cars out in front of the house at 3 am.  Still, it was home.\n\nWhen my lady wanted to move, I laughed.  There is nothing more I did not want then to move to a Sorority house of Buffy and Brads.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-04", "description": "Today the neighborhood remains as popular as ever with the post-college crowd, young East Coast professionals, and relocated natives of Southern California.\n\nThe neighborhood has its own breed of female, known as the Marina Girl, as satirized in the Cameron Diaz film The Sweetest Thing. The stereotypical Marina Girl parties hard, shops casual yet high end fashions including lululemon, Seven Jeans, Ugg Boots, and Banana Republic while never being employed in any tangible profession, other than office manager (aka \"receptionist) or booth babe (aka \"Product Marketing Manager\" or \"Inside Sales\"). Consequently, the single largest employers of Marina Girls is Salesforce.com (aka \"Sales Slut\").  \n\nA Marina Girl maintains her high quality of life through a series of arrangements with older gentlemen in neighboring Pacific Heights. On weekends, Marina Girls tend to gravitate around the area dubbed by Herb Caen as the \"Bermuda Triangle\": a collection of bars and restaurants on the corner of Fillmore and Greenwich streets. Recently,  this area has become known as \"Gavin Newsom Square\".   Mayor Newsom's Matrix-Fillmore, Plumpjack Wine, Balboa Cafe, and Plumpjack Cafe are all Marina staples that dominate the landscape. \n\nDuring the week, the Marina Girl wears velour jogging or lululemon yoga outfits and can be found looking for companionship at the popular Marina Safeway or near the beachfront at Chrissy Field  When a Marina Girl turns 30, she is no longer known as a Marina Girl, but as a \"Cougar\". Locations in the Marina with a high saturation of Cougars are eHarmony.com, Balboa Cafe, Circa, the sidewalk window seats at the California Wine Merchant, newly opened Bin 38, and the aforementioned Marina Safeway.\n\nThe Marina Male, as satirized in the Keanu Reeves film Sweet November, can often be found driving up and down Chestnut, Fillmore, and Union Streets in a silver-colored, leased, automatic-transmission (aka \"steptronic\") German automobile. Three particularly popular models are the Porsche Boxster, Audi A4 and BMW 3 Series.  Each are equipped with ski, snowboard, and bicycle racks as well as removable Tom-Tom or Garmin GPS systems for the rare trip outside of the 94123 ZIP code.\n\nStereotypical Marina Males are employed in the areas of Law, Finance, IT, or Sales and wear Bluetooth headsets and the fashions of  Banana Republic, Ben Sherman, The Gap, or Ralph Lauren. Collared, striped dress shirts usually worn tucked-into pants during the week are usually kept untucked on weekends (aka the \"Marina Party Shirt\"), in conjunction with a pair of casual Diesel, Seven, AG or True Religion jeans and square-toed Kenneth Cole shoes or Reef Fanning \"bottle opener\" flip-flops.  When not looking for companionship at the aforementioned Marina Girl hangouts, most Marina Males spend their time browsing the popular TechCrunch blog on IBM Lenovo T61 or Apple MacBook Pro laptop computers at The Grove, a trendy WiFi-friendly cafe found at the corner of Chestnut and Avila streets. Other places with a high concentration of Marina Males are AdultFriendFinder.com, The Matrix, Delaney's, U Street, Pizza Orgasmica, and the \"Casual Connections\" section of the Craigslist.org website.\n\nWhile the vast majority of Marina Girls and Marina Males lease vehicles, most prefer to use transportation provided by MUNI, the San Francisco Municipal Railway. The 41 Union and 30X Marina Express (\"Sex Xpress\")  buses are the most popular and serve to foster traditional mating rituals and repeated posts to the \"Missed Connections\" section of the Craigslist website. Mobile phones with QWERTY keyboards (Blackberry, Nokia E61, Palm TREO, et. al.) and the Apple iPhone are de rigeur possessions. The Rolex wristwatch is a means used by many Marina Males to differentiate themselves from others.  Marina Girls commonly utilize oversized Dior or Channel sunglasses during morning commutes to hide the after effects of the previous evening's alcohol abuse.", "author": "Dick H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-24", "description": "Okay, I feel I must comment. I live in the Marina, on an extended housesit and I absolutely love it. I am from London, going to school here in San Francisco. And yes, I've spent enough time in this country to understand the whole frat/sorority hate thing. I am NOTHING like a Marina Girl - I'm a British indie-child, a Burner, I wear vintage and thriftstore clothing, I don't work out and I am *gasp* not white!!! However, when I have interacted with 'Marina Girls and Guys' they have been just normal, sweet, chatty and friendly. So why hate?\n\nWhy do I like it here so much? A few things come to mind: the good clean air, the amazing light (something to do with being near the water?), the cute, pastel-hued houses, the 1930's aesthetic, the scent of  front garden flowers and clipped conifers on a hot day, the cleanliness, the silent peaceful nights, the 30 bus that runs like clockwork, the friendly welcome and punchy coffee at the Coffee Roastery, the retro motels on Lombard St, numerous great breakfast places, the hummingbirds on Crissy Field, the Warming Hut, the GGB, watching the ships go by, the glow of the PoFA at night, two movie theatres, 24hour Walgreens, the Apple Store, Peets, Kara's Cupcakes (OMG), Allstars 24 hour donut shop (run by some funny, friendly Asian ladies - really oddball scene in there at 2am), Sweet Dish candy shop (OMG), the endless fashion show of supercute dogs...\n\nDownsides: The Marina could use a really earthy neighbourhood bakery like Arizmendi. A branch of Crossroads or Buffalo Exchange would be great. And another good coffee shop that opens LATE for hanging out with my laptop and studying into the night. And a cheaper produce market: the Marina Super is nice, but pricey. I'll never understand why the Safeway is such a long way from the shopping hub on Chestnut. I don't bother with it. It's easier- and way more fun -  to jump on the bus and go to Trader Joe's on Bay.\n\nAnd, yes, the area needs a bit more artiness, more 'flavour'. I admit there are very few Marina bars I would hang out in. But who cares, when one of the joys of this city is to enjoy what the different neighbourhoods have to offer? I can be in North Beach in 20 mins on the 30 bus, or I can head to Hayes Valley, the Haight, Castro or the Mission on the 22 bus. Easy. The point is, when the party's over, it's always SO GOOD to come home to the peace of The Marina.\n\nWhat the Marina haters really should know is that when you spend day after day here, you start to notice that people are quite varied. There is a mixture of rich and poor older residents, young professionals of course, young families, and a lot of people you can't really classify, like me. \n\nUltimately, each SF neighbourhood has it's own flavour. Let the Marina be what it is, but also be aware that like everywhere else in the city, it can evolve. The Marina has a lot to offer and deserves to be enjoyed by all kinds of people. If a more diverse range of people chose to move here, the area will gradually become more diverse. If you think it's too homogenous - move here! If you stay away, or only come here to pick it apart, you're helping to keep the Marina the way it is. Create your own reality, folks!", "author": "Alison S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-16", "description": "Ok, I'll chime in and give my 2 cents.  I moved to this neighborhood about 7 or 8 years ago.  I was forced to move from Noe Valley where I had lived for about a year after going through an owner move in eviction - long story - people bought the house, wanted my unit so I had to move.  I hadn't lived in SF long enough to know what I was getting myself into when I moved here and if I had it to do over again, I probably would have ended up in North Beach but here I am.  It's not exactly my cup of tea but I have to say that generally this bad rap the Marina gets is pretty overrated.  Yes you have very wealthy or wealthy want to be males and females, young and older, all over the neighborhood.  Every day you will see plenty of women here that are young, very attractive, wearing $500 - $1,000 wardrobes to the drugstore.  The drunken debauchery of the 20 something frat and sorority girls is mostly generated by the people that come here from somewhere else to hang out in bars with people like themselves.  Thankfully, I live about a block or so away from the bars so I'm not in the middle of the madness, I'm just close enough to it to visit it any time I like and leave the scene any time a like.  I have to say that, despite the fact that I am not the Marina type, I have found most people who live here to be really great most of the time.  The marina also deserves a lot of stars for the obvious reasons:  close proximity to the GG bridge, Presidio, Chrissy field, the beach, the St Francis and Golden Gate Yacht Club, and I could go on and on and on.  Now I'll get to the one bad star and the reason the Marina gets it's bad rap.

While I'm up for a striped-shirt-guy joke just like the next person, I don't think it's a reason to hate on a whole neighborhood.\n\nI loved living in the Marina, I really did. It's a very pleasant neighborhood--the happy Union and Chestnut streets always make for good people watching, shopping and eating. \n\nBy \"people watching\" I mean the Marina stereotype everyone by now knows about--the girls in their designer jeans and heels and the guys in their striped shirts, a group of people who appear to have remained in their sorority/frat house days. With that said, what you often get are some guys and girls very into their appearances and very into hooking up. Annoying...shallow...maybe, but it can be a very fun environment for any young person that subscribes to the Sex-and-the-City lifestyle.\n\nBy \"shopping\" I mean a bunch of trendy boutiques. If you want thrift stores, go to the Haight. If you want something more casual and upscale, like Armani Exchange or Lucky Jeans, wander the Marina.\n\nBy \"eating\" I mean a bunch of trendy restaurants, bars and lounges. It seems like the Marina-dwellers treat going out for a burger, or even shopping at the infamous Marina Safeway, as an oppurtunity to meet a potential mate. Cougars, the aged version of the 'Marina girl,' have their haunts where they prey on the young, frat-boy type. Ah, it's a scene. A pretty hilarious scene, but if you can be lighthearted about the whole thing, this is a pretty fun neighborhood to party in.\n\nWith all that said, I am very glad I live in North Beach. Some of my closest friends still reside in the Marina, and I love visiting them.

And while many of us may miss the days of college fraternities, we're grown up with decent jobs and want to have fun. And even better, and the crown of the neighborhood, the girls. The beautiful blondes are the best. I've been out to New York and Boston many times, and while places there and in Germany and the Czech Republic have a lot of hotties, it is really hard to beat the Marina. \nSure, we care about our looks, are really fit. But that's why we're cool. GO MARINA!!!", "author": "Dom C."}
