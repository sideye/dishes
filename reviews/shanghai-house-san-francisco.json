We were trying to go someplace else, but so many businesses were closed that day. Waited 20 minutes to get seated and an additional 40 minutes to get food. Pan fried buns were amazing and fried chicken was very good (different flavor than San Tung, but just as crispy, if not more!). Shanghainese noodles were good, but a little too flavorful. Lion's head was not quite what I'm used to, and the one dish we had that I wouldn't reorder. \n\nOverall, this is a legit shanghainese place with one lady running the show (takes orders, serves food, cleans tables, sets up tables). The pan fried dumplings are amazingly good, but you have to wait forever. Next time in in the area, I'm ordering it for takeout.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

It seats about 26 people when full, so we came especially early at 5.30 pm and managed to get a table for 7 by joining two smaller tables. The lady who served us, seemed to be the only person taking orders and clearing the tables, so you have to be patient.  She looks like she could be the owner but not 100% sure.\n\nWe ordered the usual dishes such as drunken chicken, hot pepper tendons (too spicy for me) saute fish in egg whites (one my favorite dishes served with vinegar) roasted carp with green onions, fried vegetarian beancurd wrap, 8 precious rice pudding (not crispy enough) fried vegetarian beancurd and 2 orders of fried meat buns, which was excellent.  It was crispy on the bottom and the thickness of outside bread was thin and best eaten with dark vinegar. I was impressed that everything came piping hot and that's the way I like it.\n\nI wish the menus weren't covered in spills, sauces and strange marks. So I they would clean up the menus by wiping them down.  Overall the restaurant is clean and the food is decent and served really hot which is a huge plus for me.

My friends and I arrived, sat down, and then lady just came to our table and literally slap the menu on our table.

They were beef tripes in chili oil, pork and leek dumplings, and mushy pork.  Flavor was ok, but I could tell all the dishes were just low quality cooking.  Sorry but it's true.  The last thing we ordered was the dry fried chicken wings (I have a picture of this).  Omg, TERRIBLE.  The batter was waaaaaay too thick to the point I wasn't sure if I was eating the chicken or the batter.  And the sauce was...well, there was no sauce actually; instead, they're just soaked in chili oil!  Yes!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-02-23", "description": "No wait on a Sunday around noon, though there were a lot of people coming in and out and ordering items to go. First let's talk food.\n\nShanghai steamed baby dumplings ($8.50) - aka XLB, comes with 10. This was made very well - the skin was nice and thin but strong enough to be transferred onto my spoon without breaking and letting the soup escape. The meat was soft and moist and the soup was great. I found a hair in one of them (ew, but this happens often enough in Chinese restaurants that I'm not even that fazed anymore), and the waitress apologized and quickly brought us a new batch.\nShanghai pan fried dumplings ($11.95) - comes with 8. This came out looking delicious with nicely browned bottoms. The outside was slightly crispy and the meat inside was soft and juicy. Done really well and in a great size, too!\nSavory rice roll ($4.25) - perhaps the smallest rice roll I have ever been served at a restaurant. This meant that there wasn't so much filling, although the actual ratio of filling to rice was good. I personally would have preferred more pork floss inside, but it still tasted good. Only problem was the portion.\nCucumber & bean thread sheet ($9.95) - not bad but expensive for $10. I would have liked less peanut sauce. I took a bite of the leftovers the very next day, and it had a terrible mushy consistency, so definitely finish this the day of if you're going to order it.\nDry fried chicken wings (did not see item on menu) - definitely a disappointment. The basil on top was black and in a clump, which did not look appetizing. The outside was way too hard and crunchy with a thick layer of batter. The sauce itself was decent, but doesn't even hold a candle to San Tung.\n\nService was not good. When we were waiting to order, the lady was just standing behind the counter, where there is a big plant in the way. Not sure if she just couldn't see us or was taking a break, but I saw a customer from another table walk up to put in her order because she had been waiting for a while already. That same lady at the counter yelled into the kitchen so loudly once that a little girl sitting a few tables over said, \"It's so loud!\" hahaha. Two of our items came out separately with the servers not knowing which table they were for - there aren't that many tables in there! When they were confused and looking around, we had to tell them that the dishes were ours. When the waitress took away my soup spoon with the hair in the dumpling, she didn't give me a new spoon until I asked. And finally, we sat next to the door and it didn't close properly so the draft was blowing at us each time someone walked in or out. I am fully aware that some of these things are nitpicky, but when combined with hair in my dumpling, subpar service, and only okay food, this makes for an overall unsatisfactory meal that deserves a rating of \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"\n\nAlso, what's with using saucers as plates??", "author": "Nicole M."}

The first time around I remember I had to wait a bit to be seated, but this time my party and I got seated immediately. The same individual (I assume is the owner) took our orders. Both times, this individual did not show much emotions or expressions, she just took our orders, refilled our tea pot from time to time, and that was about it. Food was delivered directly by the chefs.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n- Xiaolongbao (soup dumplings)\n- Stir-Fried Shanghai Noodles\n- Dry Chicken Wings\n- Pan Fried Dumpling\n- Pan Fried Potstickers\n\nFood was delicious! The Xiaolongbao had a thin exterior that held the soup fairly well and had a juicy filling. The Pan Fried Dumplings and the Pan Fried Potstickers had a nice crispy, yet chewy exterior. Both of the fillings were tasty, as well. Out of the three, my favorite was the Pan Fried Dumplings. The Stir-Fried Shanghai Noodles were okay, nothing really made it stand out though. Lastly, the Dry Chicken Wings were excellent! Some say it's comparable to San Tung's wings, but honestly they're incomparable. It's not horrible, it's just different in looks and taste, so one cannot simply compare the two. The wings here have a nice crunch to them with a sweet caramelized sugar glazing. Not to mention, the size of the wings are generous.\n\nOverall, a great Shanghainese restaurant on Balboa.

Look no further than this no frills hole-in-the-wall in a bustling area of Balboa. There might be a few naysayers who swear by Shanghai Dumpling King a few blocks away, Kingdom of Dumpling over on Taraval, or even Yank Sing across town (bless their souls...). Think twice before you try to convince them that Shanghai House is better because it'll be a win-win situation for everyone -- they'll continue to believe what they want to believe and you'll keep your wait times at Shanghai House down because this place is tiny.\n\nI can only speak to the weekday lunch or weekend brunch at Shanghai House, the latter of which I would recommend if you've started to feel a bit jaded about San Francisco's pricey and occasionally over-the-top brunch scene. This is one of the few places in the city, if not the only, where you can enjoy an authentic Shanghainese breakfast. Start off with a bowl of savory doujiang (soy milk) and drink in the subtle flavors of the pickled radishes and floating youtiao. And speaking of youtiao, don't sleep on a side order of them. Who needs millionaire's bacon when you can have fried dough?! And in case you wanted more carbs (who doesn't?), order a savory rice roll, which is kind of like an uncut sushi roll without seaweed, filled with rousong (dried pork with a cotton candy texture) and more youtiao. Follow that up with an order of scallion pancakes, which are delicious without being too greasy.\n\nNow, onto the main dishes. You clearly came here for the xiao long bao and they certainly do not disappoint. The thickness of the dumpling skin can critically affect the tastiness of the xiao long bao: too thick and it'll absorb all of the soup. Shanghai House consistently hits the nail on the head with their soup dumplings. I'm also a big fan of their shengjian bao, which is like the xiao long bao's crispier cousin. And I hope you didn't plan on eating for the rest of the day, because you can't miss out on the chicken wings or the nian gao. I daresay that the chicken wings here are better than the ones at San Tung because I don't have to worry about the sticky honey glaze eating away at my enamel.", "author": "Amy C."}

I found out that the best time to dine here is right after 5pm, once they're open for the dinner hours. \n\nParking on Balboa St. is metered and can be difficult to find. The parking meters are operational from Monday-Saturday at 9am-6pm. There's a 2-hour parking limit and it's at $2.25/hr, as of January 2017.\n\nFYI.., their restroom is NOT user-friendly for the elderly or someone that has difficulty walking.  In order to use their unisex bathroom, you have to walk upstairs and through their kitchen. Their stairways are also very narrow too. \n\nIf you're a fan of boba milk tea, there is a \"Purple Kow\" right across the street from \"Shanghai House\", which is very convenient to go to right after a meal here. \n\nI personally like the overall food at \"Shanghai House\" more than \"Shanghai Dumpling King\", but just a little bit more. FYI, they do not accept credit cards, as they're CASH ONLY!", "author": "Johnny W."}

There was a grim and uninviting air to the place that was difficult to ignore.  The waitress was not rude but, instead, had a haggard, defeated demeanor that screamed \"life sucks and so do you.\"   She shuffled slowly from customer to customer, looking as if she would rather be anywhere than where she was and not seeming to care whether a customer was happy or sad, pleased or displeased.  I can't explain the service better than that but it did subconsciously dampen the pleasure of the experience. \n\nI helped myself to a menu and looked it over, confused as to why none of the items that other Yelpers raved about were not on the menu.  The waitress saw me looking back and forth in confusion between the Yelp review on my cellphone and the menu in my hand and simply said \"two menus\" as she handed me a different menu that I had not noticed before.  \n\nI ordered the dry fried chicken wings and the pork dumplings.   She shuffled to the kitchen with my order.  A gloomy, dark cloud loomed over her head, making Eeyore's look like rainbows and sunshine.   \n\nGetting the food took awhile but was definitely worth the wait.   The meal came out piping hot so I'm certain that the delay was just the cooking time and was no fault of the waitress.  \n\nThe dry fried chicken wings and pork dumplings (xiao long bao) were great.  The chicken was coated in a spicy honey glaze that crystallized the chicken skin into a heavenly, decadent candy shell that stayed crisp even when reheated and eaten the next day.  The dumplings were fresh, tasty and juicy.  The tender skin encapsulated a delicious broth that pleased the senses.  So delicious!Compliments to the chef! \n\nGiven how delicious the food was, I can NOT give this restaurant any lower than a 4 star rating despite the bad vibe.  I highly recommend trying the dumplings and the chicken TO GO so that you can truly enjoy the meal!   And please, be kind to the waitress.  I don't know what caused the doom and gloom but let's just pretend we're Care Bears here and spread the love to someone in need.", "author": "Linda H."}

But first things first: get there early! Because that place gets packed! Make sure to check in with the waiter! The food to try are pork dumplings  and the spicy fried chicken. it's a must if it is your first time there! \n The food is excellent, but the only bad part is the service. During a couple of visits, I noticed there's really just one waiter for the whole restaurant and a helper to deliver the food with minimal English. The waiter is a bit slow and sometimes have an attitude problem. And once and awhile, she would not be considerate of the customer. Last time I was there, I was not given a tea pot for my tea and to get her attention, I had to wave my hand in the air. Another downside is that you have to pay the bill in cash so bad luck if you have only a credit card. \nBut overall don't let the downside deter you, the food is awesome, a real SF gem, just get ready for the somewhat bad service.", "author": "Sebastian F."}

Five minutes later, the forewarned waitress arrives with menus and the \"esteemed\" resting b*tch face. The lack of organization in service reminded me of the movie Matilda with Miss Trunchbull - the kitchen chefs (or staff) were so sweet and helpful while the waitress disappeared into the kitchen. \n\nThe food was pretty delicious. We had the Dry Chicken Wings, Mushu Pork, and Pan Fried Dumplings. The coating on the chicken is like a hard caramel strengthened by corn starch and the sauce is heavily thickened with honey (do not get this on your clothes!). The mushu pork dish consisted mainly of onions and eaten together with the bread wrap and sauce was pretty tasty.  The pan fried dumplings were also good - the skin on the bottoms nicely browned and crisp. Not overly generous with the filling (I'd say about 40%) but the inside is moist and flavorful. All leftovers tasted great the next day even reheated. \n\nOn the fence about coming back because having to deal with attitude is kind of a pain when trying to enjoy good food but she kind of softened up by the end of service. Let's not forget that she did give us side-eye at the beginning but stopped after  because I was scrolling through the one-star reviews on the table to her face as we were ordering. Overall, what an experience. For Zagat to review this place so highly and comment so little on the service says a lot about how people view restaurant reviews, doesn't it?", "author": "Austin L."}

Nothing too special but definitely less packed than Shanghai Dumpling King which is a block away from here. The grandma loves their xiao long bao so we came here for a late lunch on Friday. \n\nWith only three other tables, service for us was efficient and prompt. Maybe cause we sat at the two seater table right next to the register and in front of the kitchen door so we literally ordered from the boss lady as she was doing stuff from the register. \n\nThe food came out in a timely manner. First was the two orders of pork xiao long bao. They were hot, juicy, and flavorful. Not bad. The grandma and I killed one order each. Next came the shanghai cho chow mien. I ALWAYS get this dish at every shanghainese restaurant because I love the thickness of the noodle and how great it taste. But to my disappointment, the cho chow mien here was VERY bland and tasteless. sigh...\n\nThroughout our meal, the grandma and I were interrupted occasionally by the noise coming from behind; the kitchen.

Good for a change of taste in SF! \n\nI am a Suzhou-native (a city close by Shanghai) and our food is very similar to Shanghai-nese food. Although the food here do resemble the mildly-spiced dishes from Jiangnan, the taste is still not quite as delicate as what I remember from back home. Everything tasted very similar, and some dishes were overly sweetened. \n\n[FOOD]\n- EIGHT TREASURER SOUP [4/5]: I've never had this dish back home. It's a little bit spicy and has a lot of goodies inside, as suggested by its name. The noodles on the bottom was very fulfilling with the peanuts, preserved tofu, and the other small bites. \n\n- PAN FRIED DUMPINGS [2/5]: This is one of my favorite breakfast food back home and was so looking forward to eating it. The skin was pretty good - a little thinner than I liked. But the filling was extremely gooey - we were wondering if it was even cooked or not. I think they mixed a bit too much flour with the meat. \n\n- RICE CAKE W/ SHREDDED PORK/ & VEGGIE [3/5]: This is one of my favorite dishes back home, but I was disappointed by how few rice cake there was. The flavor was also very similar to the Shanghai cu chow. \n\n- DRY FRIED FILLET [3/5]: Fillet coated with flour and fried. It is served very sweet sauce that almost resemble maple syrup. \n\n- SHANGHAI CU CHOW [3/5]: I liked the thick noodle. If you are looking for a dish that will fill up your stomach, this will be a good pick. \n\n[SERVICE/SETTING]\nThe place is owned by Shanghai-natives and it's not a big place - there are 5-6 tables inside. Street parking is available in the neighborhood. \n\nOverall it's not a bad place to grab some non-dim sum Chinese food. I have a high standard for Jiangnan food since I grew up eating them, so I wouldn't say this is authentic Shanghai food.", "author": "Wendy F."}

For the 3 of us, we ordered XLB (comes with 10), shanghai noodles, and the shredded pork + cabbage with rice cakes. The food was pretty damn good actually! I would return for the food itself. The XLB had good soup, the pork was tasty, the shanghai noodles were chewy and saucy and wonderful, and I loved the chewiness of the rice cakes too. All were great.

Got here around 12pm, and sat down immediately. Our plates weren't ready though, and neither was a menu handed to us when we sat down. Not only that, the owner was talking to someone outside for the longest time (at least 7 minutes). It looked like she was taking a to-go order, but it also looked like they were talking about a deep family issue. It was super frustrating, since the owner/waitress was the only waitress in the house. We didn't get a menu for about 10 minutes! The food did come out fairly quickly though, considering we ordered 3 plates and there were plenty of other tables in the restaurant. It took forever to get the bill though.

The ham hock was soggy with grease and tasted like the worst case of salted meat. The fried green used to garnish the ham (possibly seaweed) was over seasoned with MSG! I saw small globs and clumps of it. The Chinese donut was over fried (hard as brick throughout) and oozing dark smelly old oil. These two items are disgusting and way over priced.", "author": "Boune T."}

Enough Said. \n**CASH ONLY**\n\n***Food***\n*Dry fried chicken wings (5/5)\nMy boyfriend and I had quite a debate over this for years on whose chicken wing reigned supreme. He eventually won me over after the last time I went to San Tung the wings were a little overdone. SUPER SWEET and is amazing over rice. Pet peeve of mine is when wings have no meat on them. This place has HUGE wings and the crispy skin wins my heart every time. It is a bit tricky to eat but my boyfriend still loves me so long hair don't care. If you are ordering for a large table I suggest getting 2 orders.\n\n*Dry saut\u00e9ed green beans w/shrimp (5/5)\nWe usually just order it as-is w/o adding meat/shrimp but we felt fancy I guess that day. DELISH. Green beans were perfectly crunchy and snappy(?). Will be adding to our normal repertoire.\n\n*Pork and veggie dumplings (4/5)\nSimple dumplings with juicy filling. Pretty basic so good to mix with the vinegar and ask for hot sauce if you like heat.\n\n*Shanghai dumplings (3.5/5)\nTechnically prefer Dumpling Kitchen on Taraval better but I haven't had Shanghai dumpling king which is also on Balboa to compare. The skin is a bit thicker here than others but it's easy to eat and satisfies my craving. I appreciate the fact that the soup isn't boiling hot here too so you can eat it w/o scalding off all your tastebuds.\n\n***Service***\nSmall place, one amazing woman servicing everyone. Order can take awhile to get them wings extra crispy but it's worth it! Also come early since there's normally a wait. Not good for big groups since the place is so small. \n\n***Location***\nParking is a bit rough since it's near the movie theater, purple kow and a ton of hot pot places and more restaurants. Just drop off a friend to put your name down since there can be a wait.\n\nWhenever I'm craving wings we always go here.

We keep it simple and order the dry fried chicken wings and two orders of xiao long bao. That's it! \n\nKeep in mind, service is EXTREMELY slow. It seems like they pay more attention to take-out orders because they are always on the phone and working in the kitchen. They hardly ever come out to the dining room unless it is to bring an order to the table. So make sure you catch their attention when they are out in the dining room, because who knows when they will come back out from the kitchen. \n\nThey also don't know when a customer comes in through the doors. There was a time my boyfriend and I were standing by the door waiting to be seated and it took a couple minutes for someone to come out and seat us.

The lady quickly seated us and you can tell right away she's one of those grumpy old Chinese ladies. Nothing wrong with that though, but just saying. Also, this place is definitely quite small and I can imagine it being completely packed in here on perhaps a Friday night or weekend night.\n\n2) Wait Time\nMy party of 3 did not have to wait on a Monday night around 7PM.\n\n3) The Food\nWe decided to order the Potstickers, Shanghai Dumplings, Dry Fried Chicken Wings, and Green Onion Pancake. All four of these dishes pertain to the basic dim sum meal, so we thought it would be a good idea to order these items. \nThe potstickers weren't noticeably magnificent in taste, but they're still good!\nThe Shanghai Dumplings/Xiao Long Bao was great and definitely worth the order!\nThe chicken wings are probably close to San Tung quality and something worth checking out.\nThe green onion pancake was also pretty crisp and is a great staple to have with the meal.\n\n4) Service\nThe lady didn't smile a single time throughout the whole time we were there.\nIt seemed like she just wanted to get through the rest of the night and could care less about impeccable customer service. In addition, it took her about 20 minutes to give us our bill after we asked for it. However, this was OK because we were all having a nice conversation and wasn't in a rush to get out of the restaurant. To be honest, you shouldn't have high expectations on service if you're going to an authentic Chinese restaurant.\n\n5) Pricing\nThe items are definitely leaning towards the pricey end of around $7-$11 per dish.\nI don't know if the chicken wings are worth the ~$11 the menu advertises, but we were all full in the end and finished everything without any leftovers.\n\nKeep in Mind: \nParking may be harder to find, especially with Purple Kow across the street.\nSpeaking of Purple Kow, we went there right after dinner so it's a convenient location for some Dim Sum + Purple Kow combo.\n\n*Final Verdict*\nIf you're looking for a good Dim Sum place and don't care too much about incredible customer service, then this is the place for you.

Expect slow service and pay everything in CASH ONLY.\n\n- Dry fried chicken which is fine, large winglets with thick crispy batter but overall this didn't quite hit the home run experience I was searching for.  \n- XLB is quite excellent with delicately thin and chewy shell and nicely seasoned and toothsome pork stuffing housed within. \n- Hot and sour soup is high on the sour note and unbalanced so if one likes a sour and sour soup, this place has a bowl just for you. \n- Fried shanghai dumpling, which is basically the XLB but pan-friend to produce a crispy bottom. If you've ordered this and the XLB, consider yourself having XLB two-ways. It's a different texture with the shell being crispy on the bottom but still with nice taste pork filling in the middle. \n- Bean curd sheets with soybean, and pickled mustard greens-not great but does its job, the cook didn't bother to tease out the sheets so the whole thing clumped together making this less appetizing to look and irksome while trying to consume. \n- Shanghai noodle tastes more or less like your run of the mill shanghai stir-fried noodle with strips of pork and some soft and mushy noodle with napa cabbage and spinach.\nSo, the verdict is, if you're around this part of town and have an hankering craving for XLB, Shanghai House is the place for you.", "author": "Taffany H."}

You have to go through the kitchen and upstairs where you can only help but question the cleanliness.

Thought that going to the actual restaurant would be a fun and exciting experience. Wrong. \n\nMy partner and I were waited on right away and was given a seat without having to wait at all. Great. But service the moment we sat down, absolutely horrible. \n\nThe waitress, which only seemed to be one, was absolutely rude, unkind, unprofessional, and down right unhappy. First, as other reviews stated, her apron didn't seem to be clean whatsoever and neither did the menus given to us to order our food. If you do not like having white people there, please state that, as she did not treat us with respect and had a merry ok time with other mandarin groups. I'm not one to be racist at all, but that is not right.  \n\nThis was my first time here and wanted to order dumplings, which I did, but ordered the wrong kind (I ordered veggie and pork dumplings when I later found out, once my food arrived, that I should have ordered the Shanghai house dumplings.) The 'dumplings' I ordered looked more like potstickers than a dumpling. Disappointed with my meal, I asked the waitress if I could order the Shangahi house dumpling rather and have the incorrect dumplings taken back. She looked at me and said 'no no the cook already made the food, you can not have that taken back at all.' So I was caught off guard and pissed at this point. As soon as she walked behind me and at the kitchen, my partner saw her look at me with disgust and talked to her coworkers in mandarin. I don't like to judge or assume, but she was more than likely talking about me in a negative term. The waitress made our entire experience horrible. Even having to pay was a nightmare. \n\nBRING CASH ONLY! We were not aware of this restaurant being cash only. There was no sign out front, nothing labeled on the menu, and certainly not told by the waitress before hand. We finished our meal and wanted to pay by credit card. Left it on the table as we predicted it would be a hassle to ask for the check. As we waited we finally flagged her down as she was not giving us the time of day otherwise. She approached our table, saw the credit card, picked it up and actually threw it back down on the table stating 'we do not take credit cards, only cash.' With a total disgust on her face. As we did not have any cash on us, I was forced to go to the ATM a block away and get cash for the bill (which isn't a big deal but wish I had known beforehand.) We were so unpleased with this experience. \n\nOn a better note, and the reason I gave it a two star rather than a 1, is because the food was good considering everything else that happened. Nothing was wrong with our food, we ate everything we had ordered, and nothing was cold. That's all this place has to offer is the food, which is a given, but was really hoping it would have great service and a more welcoming environment.", "author": "Michael T."}

They are very similar to san tung's famous chicken wings, but I will swear they are better!  For one thing, the chicken they use here consist of wings and drumsticks! The chicken pieces are also big and they do not skimp!  Each dish consist of 8 pieces of chicken. The sweet and spicy flavors come together great with the sauce. I would say it taste a bit more on the spicy side compare to san tung. \n\nI honestly recommend you eat here if you've heard great things about these famous san tung chicken wings. come on, this place usually has minimum wait and I would choose this place over waiting at San tung for 1 hour+!!\n\nShanghai dumplings - always has the brothy soup inside each dumpling! Pretty delicious and a good amount of pork in each dumpling. They do not fail on the soup inside! The trick is to use your spoon and directly transport from chopstick to spoon ASAP! However, the skin on the dumplings are thick compared to shanghai dumpling king up the street. These are satisfying but definitely not my go to for dumplings. The better part is less wait than up the block and it will still satisfy your craving.\n\n\nShanghai style rice cake - great ingredients with a good amount of pork, cabbage and rice cake but really lacks flavor! It was not salty at all and I had to add soy sauce. I usually never do this at any restaurant cause the flavor from the meats with already added salt and soy sauce should do the trick.\n\nHand-cut shanghai noodles - same concept as the rice cake but with their hand cut noodles. Hand cut noodles had a good texture, but this noodle dish also lacked salt and flavor!  They can definitely improve on this.\n\nGreen onion pancake - delicious, crispy and a good amount of green onion! \n\npan fried baos - prob the best dish after the chicken wings and dumplings =)  highly recommend!!!!\n\nThe best part is that these dishes do not kill your pockets. If you're ballin on a budget and want some good eats, come here!\n\nwarning though: service is super slow, so pro-tip.... once you sit down, order right away!", "author": "Josie L."}

The one woman... She was extremely RUDE! ((It takes a lot to upset me.)) I received no acknowledgement upon entering the restaurant. Still, I walked up to her and kindly asked for a menu. I conveyed that I was ordering for \"HERE\". She seemed rushed. Anyhow I sat myself down after ordering three items. By the way, she did not offer water or tea to me - though I wasn't worried as I happened to have a full bottle of water with me. Though it was slightly bothersome to watch her bring food to people who had entered the restaurant much AFTER me. I waited... Waited... Also, it was so hard to flag her down to inquire re: the status of my order - as she made no eye contact with me and rushed to/from the back. \n\nAnyway, 45+ minutes later - she brought out my order via packed containers in a plastic bag... WHAT?! Again I reported I had ordered for \"HERE\" - and this time she replied with something along the lines of \"I thought you ordered to go\". She did NOT apologize for the misunderstanding. Note - when I'm hungry, I get irritated... Internally, I was so frustrated! Anyway, as I just wanted to get out of there (!!!), I paid (no tip as unbeknown to me, it ended up being to go), grabbed the food, and left (w/o getting soy sauce). \n\nI'm giving one star as the food was edible... The green onion pancakes, vegetarian steamed dumplings, and vegetarian chow mein. \n\nI wish I went elsewhere...

Went in and 4:15 or so. There was a couple people eating in and 1 person ahead that ordered to go right before us. There was 1 lady taking orders. She was not very friendly. No smile, very to the point. Ok, I'm used to that at Chinese restaurants....We didn't have cash so my husband drove all the way to wells at the beach and back still no food, it was 4:30. The person who ordered togo before us just got her food. Waited and waited, 4:55 hits she started packing some food up in a bag. Thought that was ours, ready to pay, lady says \"2 chicken wings?\" We said \"no\". She's said \"ok not ready yet\". WTF! At this point the restaurant was almost full. We see people who sat way after us get their food...\"hmm\" we thought. My husband (and I) were getting frustrated esp the lady not acknowledging us at all and how long we have waited. We said ok 5 more minutes if we don't get anything we are leaving. 5 mins later still nothing so I go to her and say \"how much longer? We've been here for almost an hour\" she says \"pan fried shang hai dumplings take a long time\". 1hr???? So she goes to the back and asks where it is, she comes out with it, basiclaly immediately, and starts taking a couple dishes out of the previously packed to go order and hands it to us. Hmmm so she packed our food mistakenly in another order?! She didn't apologize for the wait or anything (not sure why I even expected it). Already annoyed, while driving home, my husband thought how much we paid and thought it was overpriced. I checked the menu and recalculated and per my own calc after tax should have been $33 at most, we paid $36 and change! Add to our frustration. Got home and took the food out, the dumplings were packed in those compostable to go containers that when wet/moist, will warp. They put these dumplings right on top with no wax paper or anything so the bottom of the dumplings got stuck to the container. We basically had to rip off the bottom of each dumpling and if it did come off, we still needed to take the bottom off because there would be paper from the container stuck on the bottom. Smh! As for the noodles, the texture was too soft, all the ingredients kind of just mixed together like a pile of mush with tons of cabbage on top. The green onion pancake was not layered like what we r used to, it was doughy. As for the pan fried dumplings those were the best of the bunch but sadly still mediocre. Safe to say we will not be back. Usually if food is good, it can make up for horrible customer service (sometimes) but in this case, not even close, granted I know to-go can be vastly different vs when eaten fresh at the restaurant. In this case I just don't think eating there would have made a difference. Customer service: 0 stars. Food: 0 stars", "author": "Bevo T."}

The pan fried pork bun was steamed and fried perfectly. Though I was looking for more flavor of the meat, I found it in the fried bun instead. The red bean bun was a delicious desert. I've never been too big of a fan of red bean but this was not bad at all. Everything looked and tasted delicious! \nThe atmosphere is quiet and cozy.

The soup itself tasted like diluted sauce, not soup. After both of us had a couple bowls of soup, I decided to complain to the waiter (owner?) of the restaurant, because the soup wasn't cheap (in the $13-$16 range). I'd expect better.\n\nWhat offended me the most is their service/attitude. Initially, not to make it a big deal in front of other customers, I just calmly suggested to the waiter/owner that the pork tasted a bit funny,  He did not say much, either reluctant to admit it or not understanding what I said.

My first visit was for a late, 2pm lunch on a weekday- and the place was jam-packed even at this time.  I waited for maybe 5 minutes, and took a seat and decided on the general Tsao chicken lunch special and a plate of potstickers.  The portions were large and in charge and everything had great flavor.  Great value for the price.  Cash only.  I will return....", "author": "Andy S."}

The price was fair, too. So why am I not giving it 4 stars? First, the wait time. It is a popular place so I can understand a wait, but it is very disorganized; more like a line outside you have to stay in or lose your place. And standing on the curb in a line for 45 minutes is not fun; half star lost. At least set up some chairs for patrons to sit. Second, I did say the food is great but it is a tad oily, so if you are not used to that, your guts may complain later. If they reduced the grease factor 10% it would be perfect; half star because my guts have a vote.", "author": "Michael B."}

Lets start with the lines and work our way in.. \n\nFirst off, the food is good, overpriced, the service is poop, and the place is small with little walking space. This place is recommended for parties of 2-4, 5 max! If the restaurant is full, the first group will have to stand outside and wait in line. Though, there is no designated area to wait. If you're standing outside with your group, it looks like you're loitering. We came during dinner, just in time to beat the crowd. From what I witnessed by the windows, it was cold out. The second group of people that came in ended up coming into the restaurant to wait in the walkway and it seemed like they were also trying to cut the big group of people outside. \n\nMy party of 5 was seated next to the door. For our table that seats 4, my cousin had to sit on the side where the walkway of the door is. The customers at the restaurant would be rude and pull the door in, hitting him instead of pushing. The restaurant should have a push/pull sign so customers know what to do without hitting others who are dining. When we first came, there were 2 tables often. The one next to the doorway and the table next to that one. We wanted the one inside because we knew someone had to be seated in the walkway, but she put us by the doorway which was very inconvenient. There seemed to only be 1 waitress and she was rude. She would see us waving her down then disappear into the back for a few mins. Come back out and talk to other customers who came in. Took us 5-10 mins to wave her down for the check and we were close to dine and dashing because it took so long. Took her 5 mins to come take our orders as well. \n\n As for the food, it was delicious. My party and I did something similar to family-style, but it was little food for the 5 of us, I think. We ordered the Shanghai Dumplings, fried chicken wings, spicy noodles, and green onion pancakes from what I remember. All were great choices, delicious, but not enough for the party of 5 (but didn't want to order more because overpriced for it's portions). I ended up having to go next door to buy a sandwich. Surprisingly, located next to my favorite smoked salmon sandwich cafe (La Promenade). Popular for the Shanghai dumplings aka Xiao Long bao, I think the quality of it was average. Did not taste any different to other ones I've had. \n\nFor the portion size, I felt that the food was overpriced. Service was crap, but food was good. Not worth it, and wouldn't recommend coming back here unless there is no wait and you want to spend your money on small portion sized food but good. Haha.", "author": "Mandy G."}

She sat down without asking the servers and pretended nothing happened.

Texture of the skin is a bit, just a bit on the thicker side, don't like.\n\nOnion pancakes kinda burnt and dry.  Definitely not oily and yummy greasiness of other places.\n\nNo hot sauce or chili oil on the table.  Service on the sucky side.  Never refilled our tea, extra napkins, cared?\n\nSweet soy milk wasn't so sweet and had a bit of salt.  At the bottom was a bunch of regular sugar not dissolved.  Glass had some sugar all over it too.\n\nOk now for the good part...meaning bad.  The hand cut soup noodles (vegetable) included sauteed vegetables that were pretty greasy like wok fried.  The broth was brown and quite oily.  Didn't look healthy and wasn't tasty.  Sad.  Noodles were overdone, no chewy elastic texture, weak.  Dan Dan noodles had no flavor at all.  Just hints of the red chili peppers everywhere.  Seems like no love in these broths and noodles.  Seriously.  The cook came out and dropped off the noodles without saying anything.  I think he knew he didn't have the passion for putting love into his food.  Sad again.\n\nMaybe I should of ordered fried chicken wings like every M**thaF**ker was but hey that ain't Shanghai?\n\nMy favorite place on this block is Kim Son.

Time does unfortunate things with one's memories! That said, these were actually quite tasty, and on par, if not better than, what I remember of San Tung's and SO's.\n\nIn the end, at $28 for good amount of food, nothing really wowed me, making Shanghai House another one of the many okay Chinese restaurants I've been to in the Bay.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - For a Chinese restaurant, they're actually pretty small, with seating arranged in such a way that only the seats down the middle aisle are really accessible.

I came here with my girlfriends on a day where we were basically eating up all of San Francisco. Even after a day of packing ourselves with food, we still had an appetite for this place! \n\nXLB was great here, I do like the ones from Kingdom of Dumpling better but these were a good start to our meal. Now, potstickers are probably the last thing I would order at a Chinese restaurant for fear of frozen/not-good sides. However, the potstickers here were surprisingly delectable, with the right amount of crisp and a yummy inside. Hand Cut Noodles were VERY good here. I am a big fan of Mandarin/Taiwanese style noodles and these were a great filler to the whole meal. \n\nNow the big question might be in question of their chicken and if it beats the almighty San Tung. Not having tried San Tung myself I am not sure, however this chicken did make me a believer. I'm usually not a big fan of fried chicken wings however the spicy, sweet, crispy goodness definitely converted me. I'll just have to try San Tung and put it to the test! Caution to the wings is that these are SPICY so be ready fill up on your tea and ask for some water. \n\nMy group was actually lucky that we didn't have to wait.

There was no more wait which was what drove me away before. Got seated right away with my girlfriend and ordered 3 items we've ordered many times before.\n\nShanghai Dumpling, Saute String Beans, and Dry Fry Chicken\n\nThe shanghai dumplings were juicy, yes, but the meat was also not solid at all. For those of you who've had a good shanghai dumpling, you get a you get a nice flavorful somewhat firm meat and some soup. This one was basically all soup and very liquid like meat. Okay thats fine move onto the string beans.\nThe string beans were really salty. I usually dont even eat too much rice but i had to order 2 bowls to share with my girlfriend because it was just that salty. \nThe last and what made me the most disappointed was the dry fry chicken wings. This place used to have huge and amazing chicken wings to the point that i liked it better than san tung chicken wings but this time it didnt even come close. It tasted as if they used sugar twice instead of sugar and salt. It was a very sweet sauce almost inedible. Luckily i had the very salty string beans to counterbalance the sweet. If i was eating with my mother or my brother i know they would have complained and asked for another plate or a refund but i dont have enough courage to do that so my girlfriend and i just finished our meal in disappointment. \n\nWill likely be my last trip there after being one of my favorite places.

I even brought my parents here from the South Bay, and the XLB was judged to be so tasty that we added to our order.\n\nBut yesterday... I don't know what happened. First off, zero greeting whatsoever by the only lady holding it down solo. She just tossed the menus on our table. I know it's a Chinese place so had no expectations of superior service, but really? Not even a 'hi'? Dislike. Also, the place was not busy whatsoever. There were 3 tables occupied. Yet she preferred to take hiding behind a huge indoor plant that's been conveniently placed on the cash register counter, thus blocking her from overseeing the dining floor. It was difficult to get her attention when we wanted our check, and I could see behind the plant she was wolfing down a bowl of soup or something.\n\nMoving on..The XLB was the real disappointment, however. They were tiny and flat instead of round and plumpy. It was almost an art to peel off the baos without tearing the bottom off of the steamer that's only been lined with parchment paper. Plus the ones that did succeed in landing in my soup spoon in one piece had such little juice, it almost didn't matter how meticulously you removed the baos.\n\nThe Green Onion Pancakes and the Green Beans with Veggies and Tofu dishes were just average. It's not like they're easy to mess up anyways. Tofu Seafood Soup was just okay too. \n\nThis was really a 2-star experience. Added one star due to nostalgia of good past experiences.

Whenever I go, there are at least two staple items: chicken wings and xlb.\n\nXiao long bao: flavorful, a bit sweet, and the skin is just the right texture and thickness.\n\nDried fried chicken wings: very crunchy, not to be confused with crispy.  There's a physical feeling to it, not just a small wimpy sound.  The sauce (syrup really), unlike other restaurants, uses a lot of the chilis that are quite flavorful on their own.  The wings stay crunchy throughout the whole meal.  My favorite part is when the syrup cools and thickens up.  I slather it all over the wings and eat it last.\n\nAlso recommended...\nCucumber bean curd: I don't remember if this is the actual name, but it's cool and refreshing.\n\nHand-cut noodles: Any of the preparation styles are fine.

I've tried xlb at many places, and dare I say it, am a xlb snob. The xlb was OK, definitely not the greatest. The skin was a little on the thicker side and did not seem as flavorful as some others I've had. \n\nThe green onion pancake was very crispy, and not too dough-y, exactly how a green onion pancake should be. The bf loved it and gobbled it down quickly. There are 8 slices of this, pretty generous I will say. \n\nThe hand cut noodles are the star of the show. It comes steaming hot, and is just SOOO good. Thinking about it just makes my mouth water. Everything goes together so well in this dish. \n\nThe second time we also ordered the bean curd salad - guess that was OK as well, just your average dish.

I'm a believer that no Chinese restaurant is ever good if you just randomly order shit that you think \"looks good\" - you need to know what they make really well and order that.\n\nSo I'm also going to say something blasphemous here: their chicken wings are crispier, tastier, and have a more complex flavor than San Tung.  These are definitely my new crack wangz.  \n\nWhat you should get:\n- Handcut noodles (the fried kind, not the ones in soup): they're like chow fun, but better because the noodles are fresh and very tender.  Great vegetable to noodle ratio too, not too starchy\n\n- Dry fried chicken wings: the spicies just have more depth and the wings are cooked all the way through with care, while still maintaining tenderness.  The sauce isn't as sticky as San Tung, so be sure to scoop some of that sauce ALLLLL over your wangz\n\n- XLB: dude, so juicy.  not too much meat.  all about the soup inside.  I know I know Shanghai Dumpling King up the block is more famous, but I think this place makes it with so much more care even though you'll notice that there's a lot less meat in each XLB\n\nOther reviews mentioned that the service here is not very good, but have you EVER been to a Chinese restaurant where there was good service AND cheap AND authentic AND delicious?  No, I definitely have not experienced that in the United States... maybe only in Taipei.

We came to this place due to its convenient location in regards to Purple Kow (very popular boba store) to grab an accompanying lunch. My friend ordered what he thought was \"dimsum\" -- 10 dumplings and 4 small pork buns. By the time we brought it back to the house and sat down to eat, the dumplings were cold and sticking to the paper box. The buns also looked like those you can buy from the supermarket, defrost, and microwave to eat. Definitely nothing special. One positive note about this place is the reasonable price -- at least I was full from the lunch. I probably won't be ordering take out from here again, but maybe will try dine in to see if the experience is different!", "author": "Hurnan V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-24", "description": "Shanghai dumplings is my most recent discovery.  There is something magical about these nearly transparent skinned XLB (code for these dumplings I have picked up from reading fellow yelpers); when I wash up in the shower and gingerly soap the sacs, I sometimes picture twin XLB's hanging.   Eating these dumplings take years and years of experience and practice.  The science of it is it is delicately picking it up by its foreskin cleanly, as to not let any juices leak, plopping it into soy sauce, then laying it on your tongue and sliding it into your mouth.  I have had Shanghai Dumpling King nearby which was pretty good, however KDer told me that Shanghai House had dumplings that were renown and comparable if not better.  I could eat 3-4 treys of XLB's at Shanghai Dumpling King so I was hesitant if anything else could compare.  \n\nThis place is always crowded.  Unlike Shanghai Dumpling King which is a dump, this place is somewhat modern.  There is even a glass door.  However, beware of this aesthetic beauty.  It does not close completely, and any gust of wind will jar it open, letting in a cold draft of pneumonia.  Because there is so much ingoing and outgoing traffic, my teeth would have been chattering if not for the dry chicken wings.  As of all Chinese restaurants, waitresses do not engage you in banter.  They jot down your order, bring it to you and try to get you to leave as soon as possible.  There is not even the slightest hint of a smile.  We ordered:  \n\n1.  xiao long bao: 4/5  These shanghai dumplings were good, however, inferior to that of Shanghai Dumpling King.  First off, the outside dough was a little too thick as opposed to the nearly translucent skin of Dumpling King.  As a result, it was a little heavier to eat and fills you up faster.  A plus is that because of a thicker outer skin, they are less apt to break, spilling out succulent juices.  These dumplings are also very small, so while there are 10 mini bundles of joy, you can chow through them pretty fast.\n\n2.  pork dumplings: 3/5  These pork dumplings were shaped differently from the original baos.  These were decent.  Again, the dough exterior was thicker than I would have liked.  The pork was tasty inside, however, nothing was truly outstanding.  It was an average dish.\n\n3.  shanghai panfry noodles: 3/5  This was a KDer dish and she made sure to get it vegetarian, stripping the order of its meat.  Curse her.  The noodles were very greasy.  In addition, I am not a fan of those really thick noodles.  I prefer the thin chow mein type noodles.  We ordered too much so I really didn't eat eat much of this until the next day.  It was good as a instant lunch, however, I believe it was more a product of my hunger than to the testament of the noodles.  A pile of oil and grease rested on my plate after the noodles were gone.\n\n4.  dry chicken wings: 5/5  I've had the original dry chicken wings at San Tungs and I will say these are delicious and just a small notch below the original innovators.  These dry chicken wings were spicy.  In addition, they arrived piping hot, and because I was too hungry to wait for them to cool, I alternated between blowing the chicken, taking a bite, and blowing my fingers to alleviate the minor 3rd degree burns being afflicted upon them.  While an order of San Tung's wings are more in quantity, Shanghai House's wings are much bigger.  There is more meat on these wings.  The caramelized sauce is too money and this dish made the meal.  \n\nShanghai House is affordable like 99.9% of Chinese restaurants, however, they do jack their price an extra dollar or two due to all the media hoopla they have received.  They proudly paste their accolades on the glass window.  I am not the biggest fan of Chinese food.  As I have said countless times, I believe their food to be overly sauced and greasy.  In addition, service is non-existant but you cannot hold a Chinese restaurant to that standard.  If you are tired of waiting in line for San Tungs tho, come here.  To be honest, I can't say San Tung is a clear cut favorite.  These wings can hold San Tung wings' jock.", "author": "Brian V."}

The XLBs were sooo tiny & flat looking.  The very few of them that had hot juice in them we accidentally broke & the others didn't have any in it.

It's a very small place with only a few tables so I would NOT go in large groups of more than 4.  I went around 330pm on Friday and it's best to go at this time or earlier since there is NO waiting line.  In fact, there were only 2 other tables that were being served.  (Also, it's best to go when they open since they have lunch specials at cheaper prices available from 11am-3pm.)  I ordered:\n\n- Shanghai Soup Dumplings from their Appetizer menu\n- Combination Fried Rice \n- Dry Chicken Wings\n- 2 coke sodas\n\nand if you fill up your tummy real fast like me, that's ALL you should be ordering.  They give you a generous plate of each.  I have to back up what others say about the service -  you have to be aggressive about wanting to order from your menu, paying, wanting sodas or water, spoons/forks/extra napkins, etc. This is an asian place in a mainly asian neighborhood (as can be seen by the MANY asian restaurants and asian bank on balboa street) so service will naturally not be the best out there. If you want 5 star service, this would NOT be a place I would recommend.\n\nHowever, the food was pretty good.  I had never tried xlb, or Shanghai Soup Dumplings, but they were to die for!  They gave me about 10 dumplings in a bamboo steam pot tray.  I just totally ignored their hard-to-eat with chopsticks and used their soup spoon to bring the dumplings from the bamboo pot tray  to my mouth and I was pleasantly surprised to see the soup INSIDE the pork dumplings (even though mentally I had already read about this in the reviews).  They ARE hot so you have to be careful (I'm glad I had my ice-cold coke sodas handy nearby which I quickly gulped right after swallowing the dumplings), but they are SOOOOOO good and filling with their light medium dumpling skins.  I think I could have gotten another order or two of dumplings, been full  and called it a day!    \n\nBut I ordered the other dishes earlier and decided to finish those off too.  After all, I'm always in the area and could go back to dine here at one of those other times.  And I'll DEFINITELY remember to bring a lot of napkins/paper towels to handle those soup dumpling spills! :-)  I loved the large chicken wings which were sweet and VERY hot - there were about 8-10 large pieces.  The combination fried rice was a surprise - it had LETTUCE in it which I've never seen before in the usual chinese fried rice but they give you a lot of big large shrimp as well as  a few large other items in it.  What I noticed about the fried rice was there were clumps of white rice because the rice had not been mixed thoroughly with the meat, but it was still a tasty accompaniment to the wings.  I WAS able to use my credit card and my order was only about $30.  I was able to bring home leftovers of 4 wings.  I definitely liked the food and would definitely come back for more.", "author": "Frugal C."}

Mostly because I was craving hand cut noodles and didn't want to drive all the way to Fatima in Cupertino.\n\nWhat can I say, they've improved a lot since my last visit. The xiao long bao was REALLY soupy (and also really meaty), and the skin was nice and chewy, the way I like it.\n\nThe hand cut noodle soup was also good. The noodles are thinner than what I'm used to, but considerably chewy. The soup base is tasty.\n\nAnd they do rotations of different kinds of veggie plates which I like.

I quickly yelped Chicken Wings in that area and found this place. On the bus I called to order Dry Fried Chicken Wings togo. I got there within 15 minutes, order still not ready. Waited another 20 minutes to half an hour! What the! What was the point of calling in my order?? I don't think they started my order until I got to the restaurant. The Chicken wings had ALOT of hard crunchy batter on it, the batter is so thick, it seperates from the chicken and you can eat the batter on its own. The chicken wings and drums were huge! They aren't the small wings, they are the big ones! Overall the taste was good but if you don't like thick batter, forget about it. Also this is artery clogging for sure! The sauce is SO Thick it looked like tar, I wonder what's in that sauce, kinda creeped me out after I scarfed it down.", "author": "Karen T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-01", "description": "Along the quiet neighborhood of outer Richmond, a small packet of restaurants sits firmly on Balboa Street. Despite a cult following at Shanghai Dumpling King just a few blocks away, Shanghai House surprised customers with amazing food and clean d\u00e9cor. Formerly the chef at Wu Kong, chef/owner Kam Yuen Lu successfully translates a few banquet style dishes in his neighborhood restaurant.\n\nAmbiance. \nIn the twenty six seat restaurant, the ambiance is fit for a cozy dinner with friends. An all glass front allows customer a clear view of Richmond neighborhood. Clean white walls and bright ceiling lights create a minimalist d\u00e9cor allowing the food dishes play center stage. Dishes are served handsomely over a table filled with a scenic nature background.\n\nFood.\nShanghainess cooking showcases a tad sweet in taste compared to their regional counterparts. I start off the meal with a few orders of cold plate dishes. Neatly assembled, the vegetarian goose ($4.25) appetizer is a great starter. Tender cake make from many thin layers of tofu skin, with a pan fried crispy top, wraps in a meaty shitake mushroom filling. A slight drizzle of red vinegar provide a tang enhancer. Neatly fanned across the plate, the five spice beef ($4.95) was a disappointment.\n\nThe beef lacked flavor and was dry. Served in a bamboo steamer, the pork dumpling (minced pork filling wrapped in a soft house made wonton like skin) revived my taste buds with a burst of soup and tender filling. Braised fish with white wine sauce ($9.95) feature tender flounder. Giving the dish character, crunchy wood ear fungus compliments the soft fish. My least favorite dish was the rice cake - $5.95. Seemingly presented without care, chewy rice cakes are work-tossed with shredded pork and Napa cabbage.\n\nThe stew pork ($7.25) stole the show. Each thinly pork slice flaunts the dual textures of savory meat with a fatty cap. Hiding under the buttery pork, dried vegetables provide a slight savory note. The dark maple sauce brings the entire dish together. An order of fluffy white rich diffused the sweetness.\nHaving been here previously for brunch, the savory rice roll ($2.50) warms up the stomach. Resembling a sushi roll, sticky rice wraps around dried shredded pork and vegetables. The sweet soy bean milk ($1.25) makes a great breakfast drink. The savory soy bean milk is an acquired taste.\n\nDried vegetables, friend Chinese doughnut, along with a drizzle of chilli oil swim in the silky milk. Cut into triangular pizza slices and fried till golden brown, onion pancakes ($3.95) highlights the aroma of fried onion. Enriched in a dark sweet sauce, Shanghai style pan fried noodle (noodles stir fried with cabbage and shredded prok-$5.50) gives patrons a taste of chewy noodles that rounds out a dish.\n\nWhile chef/owner Kam Yuen Lu is busy in the kitchen, wife Teresa Hai serves patrons in the front of the house. Hai said, \"the most challenging part of owning a restaurant is finding local fresh ingredients.\" Another dish I have yet to try but recommend is the pig's knuckle which must be ordered one day in advance.", "author": "Rayfil W."}

Yes, they do and it's one of the best kinds of fried chicken I've had in a long time. Covered in a garlicy sweet spicy sauce, the chicken is extra crispy on the outside yet moist and flavorful on the inside. I love the extra kick you get from the spiciness as well. Even the bf, who has a high spicy tolerance, thought the wings had a nice spiciness to it. I think these wings are even better than the ones at san tung. \n\nWe also tried the hand made noodles which were okay, but kind of bland and didn't look all that pretty either. They were better after you mixed it with the sauce from the chicken wings however haha. \n\nMinus one star though for the lack of a bathroom (isn't that illegal for a restaurant?). You can go next door and use the cafe's restroom if you buy something though. Otherwise I would bring wipes or something cause you'll need them for your hands after the eating the wings.", "author": "Kim J."}

The food was delicious!  I loved everything we ordered.  The dumplings were very good w/o being greasy (unlike the Shanghai Dumpling King up the block).  I especially liked the Shanghai chow fun and the hand cut noodle.  The handcut noodle is actually shaved noodle. They take a block of pasta and they shaved it w/ a cheese cutter.  I've never seen anything like this in the City.\n\nMost dishes were about $5-$6 tops.  If you're on a budget, I suggest you get the noodle soup.  It came in a BIG bowl and could be shared by 2-3 people.\n\nThe onion pancake was good.  On par w/ Taiwan Restaurant's in Clement.\n\nWarning:  If you are in a rush, don't come here because the food came slowly (we suspect it's cuz everything is fresh).  Our lunch took about an 1 hour to finish.  Hopefully they will improve the service --they are new.\n\nThis place beats the horrible, dirty Shanghai Dumpling King (I don't get the hype) up the block.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-12-25", "description": "When I hear about a new place that purports to be Shanghainese, I've got to check it out as soon as the opportunity arises.  When my SIL wanted to meet me for lunch and asked me for suggestions, it gave me an early opportunity to check out the newly opened Shanghai House (Jia JIa Fu) restaurant on Balboa with a couple of representatives from my Shanghai contingent in tow.\n\nThere was no doubt about Shanghai House's truly Shanghainese identity, with the server, the other parties there at early lunchtime, and two-thirds of my own party speaking Shanghainese (and me with my usual Yangjingbang). The menu, too, was rock-ribbed Shanghainese cuisine in its offerings, even if some of the \"rice\" dishes turned out to be somewhat eccentric home-style renditions. Unfortunately, some of the Shanghai \"dim sum\" items are only offered on weekends (which isn't made clear in the menu).\n\nWe ordered xiaolong bao; one cold dish (salted duck); a couple of \"rice\" dishes, Shanghai classic \"meicai kourou\" (steamed pork belly with pickled vegetables) and a tofu and seafood clay pot; and one soup, also a Shanghai classic, fried tofu with bean thread noodles.\n\nI was able to approach the xiaolong bao with freshly calibrated taste receptors, having returned from Shanghai just two days before, and am happy to report that they were very good. Only an artlessness in the wrapping (they looked slightly misshapen) and a slight lack of flavor depth in the broth kept them from being the equal of Shanghai Dumpling King's and Oakland's Shanghai Xiao Chi's versions, but at $4.95 for 10 I'm willing to cut them a little slack. I made do with worse at several venues in Shanghai. They also made me vow to return on the weekend to try some of the other Shanghainese brunch items.\n\nThe other dishes were a mixed bag. The salty duck was tasty and lean, but had the appearance of being either too old or suffering from refrigerator burn, showing some discoloration and dryness. The pork belly/mei cai was marred by a too-sweet red sauce, but otherwise good. The tofu and seafood hot pot had fried tofu instead of the expected fresh tofu, and also suffered from a confusion of too many ingredients in it. It was almost as if all the ingredients one might toss into seafood hot-pot in the course of a leisurely hot pot dinner were crammed into a modest clay pot. This is not to say that there was anything leftover-ish about the contents; most of the ingredients appeared to be fresh and cooked just the right amount. If you are a seafood nut, this is the Chinese Cioppino for you.\n\nThe xifen/you doufu soup was the most peculiar of all. It came with an opaque brown broth, though neither I nor the two Shanghainese have ever seen this soup before with anything but a clear broth. It was savory enough, but a bit jarring visually.\n\nI went return ed the following Saturday for lunch, intending to try some of the Shanghainese brunchie stuff only available on weekends. Nonetheless, I couldn't resist another shot at the xiaolong bao. To accompany it I ordered a couple more of my favorites, savory soy milk (available only on weekends) and green onion pancakes (available daily).\n\nIf anything, the xiaolong bao tasted even better than on my initial visit, probably because I brought more of a hunger with me, and were prettier, wrapped more carefully.\n\nThe savory soy milk (yan doujiang) turne about to be as good as I've had in SF since the early days of Fountain Court, better than Shanghai Dumpling King's version (good in its own right). It was properly sassy, and properly constructed, down to the inclusion of brine shrimp, which are often omitted. (Do they think those teeny little eyes are going to scare anybody?)\n\nThe green onion pancakes (cong you bing) made it three for three. I alsway cross my fingers when ordering this, because there are so many approaches to making it and with many different results, but Shanghai House's version was much to my liking: thick, well-browned and crunchy on the outside and soft and well-seeded with spring onion tops inside.\n\nI talked to the server, who happened to be the daughter of the proprietor. Although she spoke English like an ABC, she had no problem understanding my little Shanghainese. She confirmed that it was a family operation, and said that it was dad who did all the cooking. The other server may have been the mom.\n\nI'll reserve judgement on the regular lunch and dinner fare; our limited sampling of cold apps and rice dishes on our first visit found them to be a hit and miss proposition. But thanks to today's \"hat trick\" (sorry for that, but the Hockey Haven bar is only three doors up the street from SH) I have a new go-to place for Shanghainese eye-openers. \n\n[Update 11/10/07] - I downgraded my rating from 5 stars to a still-generous 4 because I finally got there for dinner.  I had my \"Gang of Four\" (Shanghainese inlaws in tow) and we found the main dishes to be eccentric and overly sweet, even for Shanghainese cuisine.", "author": "GarySoup I."}

The owner and the Chef themselves are actually Shanghai-nese (I myself come from Shanghai, China) so that brought my expectations even higher. \n\nThe first thing I ordered was the Shanghai pork dumplings. You can't come to a Shanghai-nese restaurant without first trying the dumplings. The dumplings were Good. Juices were flowing inside the skin and the skin itself was not hard - which tells you that they are using the right kind of skin. The meatball inside was also cooked perfectly. So for the dumplings, it has my vote. ::thumbs up:: \n\nI then ordered the Sour and spicy soup - which to my surprise was kind of disappointing. Way too sour for my taste and not spicy at all. Unbalanced and very one-sided. The amount of veggies included in the soup was pretty good, but I couldnt taste any of it due to the overwhelming sour-ness. There was also a slight bitterness that I didn't like. Maybe they derived from the traditional way of making this soup in order to make it more original? I do not know. \n\nFollowing the soup I ordered Fried Tofu. Very nice. Was not deep fried like the other Fried Tofu's out there. The fried skin is very thin - covering the tofu just barely. The tofu was also soft - not firm which is the right way to make fried tofu. This I give my ::thumbs up:: \n\nThe Mongolian Beef and the Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good. The Kung Pao was definitely spicier than the Mongolian Beef however and the peanuts compliments it very very well. The Mongolian Beef was nice and tender, but I had preferred it to be just as spicy or spicier than the Kung Pao. \n\nOverall, the experience was a good one. The service was okay considering that there's only one waiter there. It would've been nice if they had accepted major credit cards, but I guess it is to keep costs low. A little inconvenient, but bearable. Bank of America is literally a block away on the corner. \n\n\nBottom Line: More or less authentic with some deviation from traditional depending what you get. Overall good experience. It was good, but not fantastic. I do support local businesses so I would go here again.", "author": "Killah K."}

The kids loved soy milk the most and $1.65 for a big glass of kids-approved was really worth for us. The spicy beef tendons were quite hot and the cucumber was a good side of the dish. One thing that I really like is the ginger in the vinegar dipping sauce was cut thin enough and was plentiful to come with the shanghai dumplings.\n\nTotal amount of $36 including tax was a good deal and we have finished all the food.\n\nThe food would worth a 4-4.5 stars but at least 1 star has been deducted because of the service. The waitress has major attitude problem. She did not give us the menu (I went to take it myself) and kept ignoring us even when we tried to get the bill. I would rather go to Shanghai Dumpling King for my girl's birthday again. At least, we got pretty good services there all the times. For a restaurant, food is important but service should not be ignored. My hubby's friend said that the waitress always acts like that.

Sadly, it is a little inconsistent - It's sometimes better (spicier and sweeter) and sometimes worse (saltier) than San Tung's dry fried chicken. (4/5)\n4. Hand-cut noodles - tasted like a chow mein type dish.  Noodles were thick and uneven.  I enjoyed it, but it was a little too greasy. (3/5)\n4. Chinese donut - don't do it!  Really, it's not because it's disgustingly unhealthy and deep fried, but because it looks and tastes like it.  It looks kind of like a churro, minus the cinnamon and sugar and amazingness.

Conveniently, I have a friend who actually avoids Valentine's day dates like the plague (he's messed up a little bit). In any case, this meant it was definitely the perfect night for a bromantic escapade to the Outer Richmond to eat Chinese food. Obviously.\n\nDinner at Shanghai House was about as perfect of a Chinese meal as I've ever had. Of course, we started with the shanghai soup dumplings (XLB for those in the know). I wouldn't say they were as amazing as the ones I had in NYC, but they were close. Really, really, great. We then got the Tan-Tan Noodles, which were super-garlicky, a little spicy, but still somehow light and refreshing. Then we ordered the killer dry-spice chicken wings. These are not to be messed with! HUGE fryolated wings in a spicy-sweet sauce that consists of so much sugar, it can only stay viscous for about 5 minutes before hardening. But it's an amazing 5 minutes. Finally, we had the \"tea-smoked duck\", which was tender, juicy, fatty, smokey, and all around awesome for $10. Seriously.\n\nThe two must-do tips here are: 1. Order off of the \"shanghai\" menu and stay clear of the \"normal\" menu. We saw some people eating the americanized dishes of that menu and I'm pretty pf changs would do it better. 2. No matter how full you are, get the sweet sesame seed dumplings in rice wine for dessert. It's on the dim sum menu but you MUST MUST try this. You get 4 simple dumplings swimming in rice wine (sake) stuffed with black ground sesame seed. The inside is so sweet, the dumpling so moist, and the rice wine so able to cut through the sweetness, that you leave almost forgetting you consumed enough to feed a family of five.\n\nAnd all of this, for two people, with generous service, tax, tip included, was $42. Unbelievable.", "author": "Tolga E."}

Parking may be somewhat of a pain as well. But there are some great dishes here comparable to Sang Tung if you are a fan of that restaraunt.\n\nThe dried fried chicken wings are very similar to San Tung but it is less sweet and spicier. The chicken is still crispy and saucy at the same time, however they do look a lot darker. And probably what makes it spicy is the fact that the chicken is coated in chili pepper seeds as well.\n\nI never had tea smoked duck before and thought it was pretty good here. There's a great smokiness to the dish you can smell and taste. Duck doesn't have a lot of meat to begin with so this isn't a huge meat dish but it's crispy, and the taste kind reminds me of ham. The duck also comes with some steamed buns and hoisin sauce to eat it like peiking duck during banquets if you wish.\n\nThe xiao long bao is not has soupy as I was expecting. There is no lettuce cooked with it as well. But given that, I think this was one of the better places I have had it in SF. Not too much wrap and the pork was cooked well.\n\nThe dried fried string beans are still firm and not over cooked till they're mushy. And there is a good wok flavor with it. The rice cake is also pretty good as well and worth a try.\n\nI would  recommend a try here. It is not perfect but they do many dishes right. Definitely earned a spot in my rotation of SF Chinese restaraunts.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Again, their Shanghai dumplings were so amazing. OK, now for the other stuff they make.\nHonestly, their noodle dishes could REALLY use a lot more veggies/meat/something OTHER than noodles! They give you a LOT of noodles.. I'm kind of disappointed about that, but then again, maybe that's the way they like it in Shanghai? Parents and I ordered the usual Shanghai style noodles, which of course was good, but had way too many noodles. I don't particularly like their noodle:meat/veggie ratio.. it sucks. We also got this tan tan noodle (\"dan dan mian\") which was quite good because it was a little spicy, but not TOO spicy. Again, it had a lot of noodles in it compared to the chicken and shrimp, but the sauce was good. At this point, I really think that the taste overpowers the ratio, in my opinion at least.\nWe also ordered the fried chicken which was really good too. The chicken probably would've tasted a little better if it were more moist though.\nLastly, we ordered this vegetarian dish--mushrooms wrapped in bean curd. It was SO GOOD. I kid you not, I think it's one of my favorites now.\nLast time, my mom, brother, and I ordered this rice cake thing which was really good too (my apologies for forgetting the name of it!).\nOverall, I'm still a huge fan.

No worry here. 3 out of 10 had no soup and the rest had just warm soup. Bean curd puff was frozen and microwaved. Funny thing is I actually prefer it room temp so I tried to mix them.

My biggest problem with soup dumplings is the temp of the soup inside. If the wrapper is too thin, then the soup is too hot and it burns my mouth.

After dodging streams of broth, please be sure to also use proper protocol when eating XLB to prevent burns to the roof of your mouth, they are as follow:\n\n1. Use both chopsticks AND soup spoon to transport from the steam basket.\n2. Slightly nibble and puncture the skin\n3. Slurp and suck the broth, like Edward on Bella.\n4. Drizzle the vinegar ginger sauce onto dumpling.\n5. Eat\n\nMy method of choice is to wait 5 minutes and place entire dumpling into the mouth broth and all.  \n\nWe also order the Dry Fried Spicy chicken wings (7.95).  They were delicious wings.  Each wing is encased in an extra crispy batter protecting the tender and succulent meat from the perfect blend of a sweet sticky sauce of garlic and peppers punctuated by fried basil.   A must order when visiting Shanghai House   \n\nConclusion- Shanghi house is small but clean Chinese restaurant in the outskirts of the Richmond.

I've let my friend who is familiar with real Shanghai and other Chinese cooking take me to the best Shanghai spots on Balboa, and I really liked this one.  \n\nWe just let her order whatever's good.  We had dumplings, spicy beef tendon, a rice cake dish, and a satay soupy/stewy clay pot.  \n\nWe had baby dumplings, which were yummy and came with the soy/vinegary sauce.  One dish of 10 dumplings was enough to split among the three of us.  These Shanghai dumplings were comparable to those from other Balboa Shanghai spots.  She always shows us the proper way of eating different dishes.  These dumplings are soupy inside.  You place it in your wonton spoon, pour some sauce over it, and use your chopstick to hold it down, while biting into it.  The broth might spill out into your spoon, and you continue eating.  Yummy!!!\n\nThey allowed us to choose the degree of spiciness of the spicy dishes, so that was good because two of us can't handle very spicy food.  The tendon was good, if you've never had it, it's good to try -- it comes cold and served in an oily sauce; it comes with beef and tendon pieces.  I LOVE rice cakes, so the rice cake dish was my favorite besides the dumplings.  It comes with noodles.  The satay clay pot was good...it had meat, mushrooms, and vermicelli.  \n\n\nThe restaurant didn't seem that small to me, and we didn't have to wait at all to get a table.  \nThe two reasons I didn't give it a 5 is because of the service and the ambiance.

And it's in a clean restaurant with a clean bathroom, which isn't always true in this part of town.\n\nBut first, something to remember before you get there: CASH ONLY.  Fortunately, there is a BoA about four doors down the street, but it's better not to have to run out at the end of the meal to get some cash.\n\nAnother thing to know is that there are TWO MENUS.  They may bring you both menus, but you have to look closely because they look almost the same.  If you only have the gringo menu (no jellyfish in the appetizer section is a sure indicator of the gringo menu), ask for the other menu.  And you can call it The Other Menu, this is well understood.\n\nNow why do you want The Other Menu unless you like jellyfish and pig's feet? (I like both, but that's not the point here.)  Maybe because you LIKE FISH.  There's no fish on The Gringo Menu, only on The Other Menu.  And the fried pompano with spicy sauce, is fish worth having.  If you're not used to cooked whole fish, it might be frustrating at first, but it's worth the effort.  My only complaint is that the fish is a bit small.  Afterwards, you have this beautiful fish skeleton with a head and tail, I wish I had brought my camera.\n\nThere are other fish dishes and a lot of other dishes on The Other Menu, but I forgot to bring all my relatives so we could try them.  I can only report that, in addition to the excellent pompano, the vegetarian goose tastes nothing like goose, and looks even less like goose, but is very tasty, the sesame chicken is one of the best sweet fried preparations of anything I've had, the spareribs are good in a sauce that might be a little bit too rich, and the house special eggplant is excellent.\n\nThe food is incredibly hot when it comes to the table, it's only about forty steps from the wok to the table and the kitchen doesn't have any real staging area (you see it when you go the bathroom), so let it sit before you burn your mouth.

They offer cold or hot for sweet soy milk!\n\nThis place can accomodate more than 6 people parties, but VERY hard.  So the perfect amount for this place is either 2-4 people.  The place also get get very packed so prepare to wait... but sometimes if you cannot wait there is a nice japanese restaurant called Miki right next door that is also just as awesome.\n\nParking is semi-tough... this place is right across one of the few independant theaters and boy do alot of people still go there.  Balboa theater probably is the main reason why all the parking is taken... #2 reason would be maybe Zephyr's Cafe.  I sometimes park a block up on Anza because of how packed it can get.\n\nThe only negative I can say about this place is the service.  As nice as the lady is to us now that we are here so often.. it still isn't the best service out there in a Chinese restaurant.  Suck it up and ignore the staff and enjoy one of San Francisco's best chinese spots!

Yu Zen and Shanghai House. \n\nWhat did I eat there that made me this excited? Well, the first thing I tried, I ate four or five times before I moved on to anything else and that was the Kung Pao chicken. I tried only that partly because I liked it so much, partly because I got it at least 4 times to go--you can't order from the \"Shanghai\" menu on take out orders--and partly because if you order two orders + rice for two you can feed 4 people (take out) for $20! And that's eating really stand-out Kung Pao--smoky peppers and smoked tofu, lots of veggies (mostly zucchini but it's good here) and tasty chicken. Just right. \n\nMy interest in Chinese Food in my neighborhood (exception of all exceptions: Ton Kiang for brunch) has seriously waned ~ it seemed every time I went for Chinese the last  few years I ate something that was too greasy, too sweet or just not memorable. \n\nTalk about memorable! the Shanghai style Vegetable Soup with hand cut noodles I had here last weekend has been stuck in my savory, sensory memory ever since and I just can't shake it. Out of all three dishes I ate that meal (my friend and I were hungry and determined to sample more of the menu) the said soup was actually the least \"exciting\" dish,  but for some reason it's the one that won out as top memorable sense that I can still \"taste\". I was actually most \"excited\" about the Bok Choy with Wheat Gluten Dumplings. This was amazingly good and yummy with a delicious sauce soaking the dumplings and the perfectly sized baby bok choy (you don't have to make a slippery slimy fool of yourself with these as you do with typically sized bok choy). Plus I am a sucker for really yummy \"meat alternatives\". \n\nAnd then to show that I am also a sucker for some meats, I also highly recommend the Tea Smoked Duck. It's so delicious! and for someone like me who doesn't eat meat other than poultry or fish, Duck prepared like this is as tasty and decadent as any pork dish might be (read: fatty and delicious and crispy).\n\nSo yes, you should try this place. But make sure you look at the Shanghai Menu. it's a mysterious practice they have of only giving it to you with the other menu (straight american chinese food?)--so some people may never even see it (esp. if you order take out)\n\nupdate: since this review I've tried a few other notable dishes: the Vegetarian Goose (with shitake mushrooms) is delicious as are the Vegetarian Steamed Dumplings. The Mu Shu Vegetables were just right, too. The Vegetable Soup with hand-cut noodles wasn't as exciting as the first time I had it, but that happens sometimes ; ) Obviously plenty for a vegetarian to eat, although I'm not vegetairian. \n\nupdate #2: Now that I eat all meat, I can rate the Shanghai pork dumplings too--more delicate and nicer than the (notorious) ones up the street. And the Golden Prawns are my new favorite dish! Yum Yum\n\nupdate #3: for some reason, after all of these years, I had never ordered the chicken wings until sometime the end of this last year. Oh my! Now it's the new 'must have' --hot, spicy, sweet, crunchy--it's a meal and dessert all at once.

It's been buzzin amongst the Asian community for the past few months and hyped as THE premiere Shanghai restaurant in the city. All I have to say is you're going to be severely disappointed.\n\nToday was my third visit to this place and as I sat there, I kept on wondering why I continue to come back. I think it's because I really do want to like this place, but they keep on coming up short. I'm a huge fan of Shanghai cuisine and have been looking  for a replacement for my fave Shanghai Restaurant, which closed down at Ranch 99 a few months ago.\n\nMy gripes. Someone needs to tell the chef to ease up on the flames.  All the noodle, rice cake, and chow fun orders I sampled were overcooked and mushy; all I tasted was dough. The portions are also  ridiculously small. Their potstickers are the equivalent size of Mcdonald's chicken nuggets. No joke. The bulk of their food is pretty bland, and I found myself dousing quite a bit of soy sauce for more flavor. Perhaps my biggest gripe has to be the owner/server there. It's an old woman with this look on her face that makes you think she's going to kill someone. Ok maybe a little harsh, but she seriously NEVER smiles. Not even the slightest grin. Ever. Go see for yourselves and tell me if I'm lying.\n\nI'd say the only thing this place got going on for them is their Shanghai steam dumplings, or xiao long bao. Although a little on the small side, they're probably one of the best I've ever tasted. Immaculate skin texture and cooked to perfection. These lil suckers are probably the only reason I'll ever go back there and why they're getting 3 stars instead of 2.", "author": "jeff c."}

The wonton soup was also bland with no flavor. I probably won't go back here unless it's the only thing open. They also forgot our rice, but I canceled it. \n\nThe only reason why I'm giving this place a 2 star is because the service was ok and the xiao long baos had a lot of soup in it, although they were small. \n\nPlease note to all the people who use the 7x7 list for reference on what to eat in the city...RESTAURANTS PAY TO BE ON THAT LIST...it's not because they are necessarily the best.\n\nNo credit cards here either.", "author": "Katherine F."}

You've got to physically be waiting in line - they also angered this man in front of me by serving takeout to the lady behind him before him. Hard to say because you have to serve takeout since she wasn't waiting for a table...but understand where he's coming from - they had a ton of miscommunication. She seated us (table of 2) in the inner most table over the table of 3 (angry man) which caused him to give me angry stares from outside the window. Then he was seated next to us. Awkward. Either way, you're supposed to reserve the pig knuckle one day ahead but since this was a spontaneous dinner, we weren't able to try that.

However, I found myself eating at Shanghai House only a few days after my episode, thanks to my addiction to xiao long bao.\n\nI think the dumplings here are similarly priced to Shanghai Dumpling King's, maybe slightly more expensive.  (Apparently the price difference is negligible since it wasn't enough to make an impression on me.)  They were delicious, as were the Chinese donuts that we ordered.  \n\nThe restaurant itself looked clean (much cleaner than Shanghai Dumpling King), and it was well-lit.  \n\nThe food was excellent and cheap, and I did not get food poisoning.

I've also had it in Hong Kong, and at various Chinese food establishments in Southern Cali (Monterey Park, Arcadia, Rowland Heights, etc).  Although I feel that the xiao lung baos that I've had in SF doesn't compare to any of the above-listed places, Shanghai House is pretty darn close.  Each dumpling was filled with juicy soup goodness and the pork mixture was very well seasoned.\n\nHowever, the dish that I was most impressed by was the steamed pork and vegetable buns.  The pork and veggie mixture was similar to that in the XLB, and the bun was so soft and fluffy.  I wanted to order extra to go, but my friend wanted to eat Philly cheesesteaks afterwards (see my review for Phat Philly and yes, I am a pig), so I restrained myself.\n\nI definitely would go back here for a XLB fix, but I also do wanna try Shanghai Dumpling King, which is just down the street.", "author": "Jolene W."}

The xiao lung bao (shanghai dumplings) haven't failed me, yet.  I've had my share of pretty bad xlb in San Francisco and was on the lookout for good ones.  These dumplings are served to you piping hot in the bamboo steamer.  The filling is very tender and full of soup.  The best thing to do is to order one basket of xlb, for 2 people.  I don't mind sharing, I just don't want to end up with ONLY 2 dumplings for my portion.  At least 1/2 an order is enough for me.\n\nThe other dish to try is the dry fried chicken wings.  If I recall, they're on the menu with the chow mein and such.  When they give you the menu, make sure you get both versions; the traditional and the Americanized one.  Some dishes appear on both menus, though.  The wings are pretty good-sized and very tasty.  They come out piled high on a plate, glistening and sticky, from the sweet and spicy sauce.  Fried super cripsy, so that it seals all the heat and moist chicken inside.  Be careful though, they're sweet and very hot (in temperature), so either wait a bit or make your first bite a tiny one.  These wings are really addictive.  How can you go wrong?  They're deep fried, super crunchy, sweet, and spicy.  Forget buffalo wings, these are the way to go!\n\nI've tried some of the other noodle dishes, but will have to go back several more times, to try other items, and add them to my review.\nIf you should decide to eat here, make sure you have plenty of time.

Nature just didn't call, thus I cannot report on the state of their facilities.  I can imagine them being clean, minimal and utilitarian.  Nothing special.  I absolutely need to return to SH for those excellent spareribs.\n\nAnywho, maybe you wanna know about the food...\n\nAs I said, went to SH this weekend with my friend, let's call her April.  We ordered four dishes, let me tell you in descending order of goodness:\n\nSweet and sour spareribs:  By far my favorite dish!  A cute pile of ribs atop a thick black pool (looked like crude oil) of the sweet and sour sauce.  All the nooks and crannnies of the ribs, in perfect little bite size pieces, allow tons of sauce to stick to them. Ragnarok!\n\nCucumber and bean thread salad:  This dish reminded me of a little bit of the dan dan noodles back at A&J (http://www.yelp.com/biz/a-and-j-restaurant-rockville#hrid:uRTGIS3KdUPKe2-YzvG2gg/query:A&J).  Mildly spicy and with a hint of sesame, nice cold pieces of cucumber, yummy noodles.  Soooo good.\n\nXLB: Pretty good, a good amount of soup and nice thin skins.\n\nFinally, knife cut stir-fried noodles with pork and vegetables:  The noodles in this dish had great texture, nothing beats home made noodles (they're better than being spanked with a wet noodle).  But all in all the dish was a little bland, needs something salty or spicy, but I don't think that any of it went back to the kitchen.\n\nI think I walked two miles in our wonderful freezing winds before a bus caught up to me and got to ride the next 35 blocks to SH, but I think if I walked all the way there, I would have been happy (as long as I could have rolled home).  The wait wasn't my favorite part of the dining experience, the dining room is tiny, and it didn't help that we wanted dinner at 8:00 PM on a Friday night, so all-in-all 30 min wasn't too shabby a wait, especially since it allowed us to examine other peoples dishes and decide what we wanted.  Thankfully, mt wallet was not conversely emptied as my stomach was filled at SH, the whole meal set me back less than a $20.  I'll be back.", "author": "Adrian L."}

Portions are huge so you'll want to eat more than one, which isn't a good idea since these are 90% pure fat. They may look big, but most of it is just fried batter. The batter is great and forms this thick crispy shell around the chicken. The sauce that comes with it is tasty too.

One was mainly waiting the tables, etc. The second, older waitress was just at the counter eating her soup and being lazy (aka pretending not to see us).

Both of us are very confused considering we had a nice little conversation with the waitress about knife cut noodles only moments before, and told her that's why we sent the dish back.

While neither of these places could beat the price - 10 for $5.25 - I wasn't too impressed by the small, doughy variety with much-less-than-expected amount of soup in those little packets.  \n\nThe other dishes were forgettable: flat stir-fried noodles with beef and vegetable, green onion pancakes, spicy braised tofu, and honey walnut prawns, while not the best in their respective classes, were actually good value relative to the prices.", "author": "Ange L."}

Service took forever.  Maybe it was because it was a Monday night.  But it seemed like the kitchen did not have its act together, which you can read below and see why.\n\nI ordered 3 dishes, in the order received:\n1. Salted duck\n2. XLB\n3. Hand-cut beef noodles\n\nFirst, the salted duck.  Normally this is prepared ahead of time, so usually you would receive this within 10 minutes of putting in your order, but I sat around for at least 15-20 minutes seeing other people getting their orders.  It was an indication that the kitchen did not have it together.  Once it arrived, it was not salted, but it did have a strong gamy flavor.  The meat was dark which made it look like the duck had suffered some sort of abuse before being killed and then salted.   I've had better.  \n\nAbout another 10 minutes later, the XLB was brought over, the 7x7 touted 100 things to experience before you die.  It was decent, but I've had better XLB.  The flavor was good, but they were not bursting in soup.  Plus, the vinegar and ginger sauce that they serve with the XLB, over powered any wonderful savory XLB-ness offers.  Good thing I only made the mistake of dipping one of my XLB in that concoction.\n\nFinally, after waiting what felt like another 15 minutes after inhaling the XLB and the salted duck, the hand-cut beef noodles finally arrive.  Now, if you ask anyone who has made fresh noodles, they will tell you that noodles cook faster fresh than from the box.  While this usually true, that means that the noodle dish will arrive before the XLB, since the XLB takes at least 25 minutes to steam through.  For some strange reason, the hand-cut noodle dish comes out last.  Now, the person working the front of the house was following up with the kitchen asking when the noodles were going to come out, well, that just says to me, that the kitchen was asleep at the trigger.  On top of that, the hand-cut noodles were like slugs floating around which was not appealing at all, not the nice thin sliced noodles that you would expect in a noodle soup.  I decided to not judge immediate and to taste it, the broth was good, the noodles were not so great, they tasted like they were overcooked.  There was only 2 decent sized pieces of beef.  If I wasn't such a soup person, I would probably have rated this dish a failure.\n\nNeedless to say, I've checked off an item from the 7x7 list, but I won't be going back anytime soon.", "author": "Mei C."}

The only reason we decided to have lunch there was because Dumpling King was closed for vacation.  The xiao long bao was not juicy and whatever juice that was there was lost since the skin was so fragile and ripped as we tried to pick them up.  We tried the chicken wings since everyone else there was having them too.  The skin was yummy but the meat itself had no taste.  The green onion pancakes were dry and doughie - really subpar.\n\nNow for the irritating part... We patiently waited for a table for about 30 minutes.  Once we sat down, we thought, great, food is coming up!!  Well, it took 15 more minutes for us to get some tea!!!!  Another 15 min for the 1st dish to come out, another 15 minutes for the 2nd and so on... we were there for 2 HOURS!!   I had the urge to leave the restaurant 3 different times.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-16", "description": "update:  7/16/07\n---\nhad the classic shanghai \"yan du xian\" in a stone pot today, and it was awesome.  The broth was white and rich (way better than a tonkotsu broth because of the smokey ham flavor), chinese style ham/cured pork, tofu skin rolled and tied in knots to soak up the broth, and freshly boiled bamboo shoots (definitely not canned), made for a perfect classic soup.  Could have used a vegetable like qing gang cai though, but ah well.\n\nThe vegetarian goose was AWESOME.  It's basically a roll of tofu skin (read:  many layers), with chinese mushrooms inside (shiitake I believe), fried, and then cut up so it kinda looks like goose breast meat.  flavor and texture were awesome (except I hate mushrooms, so I picked those out).\n\nThe loufa melon with gluten puffs was good--would have been better if they peeled all the skin off the melon to remove the bitterness, but overall it was stir-fried right.  \n\nxiaolongbao has dropped to B-/C+ grade.  They were stuck to the basket, and all of them were popped.  No soup.  Skin was thick, and overall they seemed overcooked.\n\noriginal review:  4/16/07\n---\nFINALLY a passable shanghai restaurant in the city.  FINALLY.\nShanghai dumpling king:  mediocre, heavy handed crap.\nOld shanghai:  decent food, but not shanghai food.\nshanghai noodle house:  decent, but not made with the craftsmanship I'm looking for.\n\nThe xiao long bao were mediocre--B grade.  Some soup, and the skin thickness varied from passably thin to way too thick.  Also, the lack of napa cabbage under the dumplings let the dumplings pop because they stuck to the basket.\n\nBut the stir fried food themselves... were actually decent.  Only had 3 dishes so far, but they were:\n-spinach with tofu \"bai ye\", like tofu skin but a little thicker with a slightly rougher texture.  THis was stir fried beautifully, and the spinach was nice and clean--no sand.  The chicken broth added just enough flavor, soaked up by the bai ye.\n\n-sweet and sour ribs.  ALMOST perfect.  These were black like they should have been, but weren't sour enough to match the sweetness.  Also the ribs were not fried quiet enough--the ribs weren't falling off the bone, and the bones were not edible.  BUT, they were still tasty, using the right black (zhen jiang) vinegar.  We asked for more vinegar and poured it on top, and then it was sour enough.\n\n-wine sauce fish.  ALMOST perfect.  A little too salty, and needed to be a little bit sweeter.  But otherwise, it was stir fried perfectly, and the black wood ear fungus was very tender and just right.\n-salted mustard green (aka snow cabbage, xue cai), edamame (mao dou), pork strand (rou si)  knife-shaved soup noodles (dao xiao tang mian).  On Ed's recommendation, we had to get these knife shaved noodles.  The noodles themselves were the perfect texture and consistency--nice and chewy--though the length and thickness of the noodle could have been better (it's tough to control, and takes a lot of skill to make right, because you shave the noodles directly off of a lump of dough, into the boiling water).  The soup however... had soy sauce in it?!  and was too salty with not enough flavor.  not the tasty, clean, chicken-pork white broth I'm used to for salted mustard green soup noodles.  Still, it was good.  These are all shanghai classic dishes by the way, as we were deliberately testing the chef.\n\nFor dessert, they had fermented rice with mochi rice soup balls (filled with sesame paste).  This is a shanghai classic dessert.  The chef added osmanthus flower, as he's supposed to, and just the right amount.  It totally hit the spot.  They also have an \"eight treasure rice\" (ba bao fan), which is sticky rice (aka sweet rice, mochi rice, or glutinous rice) steamed with 8 \"treasures\" including lotus seeds, red beans, etc, and honey on top.  But we'll have to order it next time.\n\nwith the bill, they brought us half an orange, cut up--as they do in many true chinese restaurants.  no lame-ass fortune cookies here.\n\nI loved it!  I've been forced to lower my shanghai food standards ever since I've come to the city, and this place finally hit the spot.  It's nowhere near best in the bay, but finally, there's a passable shanghai place in the city!\n\n(the large bowl of knife-shaved noodles.. were only 5.75 ea before tax and tip.... my people rule)", "author": "Fong L."}

I'm pretty sure I'm missing something since I counted 7 things on the check but for the life of me can't remember. Everything we had was delicious - my favorites being the lion's head meat ball, hand cut noodle soup (mostly because of the noodles - I think I've had the beef noodle soup and I think I liked it more), and the dry fried chicken wings. Note: Everything else was good, just picking my favorites. The chicken wings actually have a leg up on Santung and are spicier/crispier. The only thing with the wings is that they are sweet, but I have a feeling if you like Santung you won't mind this one too.

The xiao long baos were soupy and normal size.  Unfortunately, the quality has since headed for a down turn.  I'm not sure if it was because we went a little later at around 8:30PM and possibly they were running low on the meat filling.  The dumplings I had yesterday were tiny and since there was little meat it reminded me of the cheap wontons that you get at the crappy Americanized Chinese restaurants were it is mainly the dough wrapper.  Also, due to the small amount of meat in the dumpling there was little soup since it probably got absorbed into the wrapper.   In addition, to the dumplings we also ordered string beans, a pickled vegetable casserole with fish and the Shanghainese vegetable rice.  The rice was very bland, so I decided to bring it home to add some dried scallop or bacon flavor into it.   The casserole was ok, but I've had better down in south bay.  Overall, I'll probably end up coming  back with friends, but I'll insist that we come earlier in the day.  (Hopefully, there'll be more meat filling then.)", "author": "Sharon W."}
