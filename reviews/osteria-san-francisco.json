What a great experience. \n\nThree of us for dinner, two of us wanted to share a primi and a secondi. They split the plates and delivered them in a perfectly sequenced way. \n\nThe food was spectacular. We tried the tortellini that everyone raves about - the hay and straw - so good. The Veal with mushrooms. DELISH and the chicken milanese - so good. The carpaccio and a few salads rounded out the meal... but dessert! \n\nThe tiramisu was big enough for the table of three. HUGE slide and it was wonderfully decadent. \n\nAnd a side note. Lots of people from the neighborhood were there. You could tell because it was like Cheers - where everyone knows their names. The staff dotted on some of the older ladies who were in attendance that night. Helped them to their seats and helped them as they left. It was so comforting to see the staff treat everyone who entered like they were a special guest. \n\nNext time in SF - I will search this lovely haven out and drag some friends along with me.", "author": "Marilyn D."}

Nicely executed appetizers, pastas, meats, and desserts.\n\nServices is warm and efficient. Prices are what you would expect for San Francisco and classic Italian fare.\n\nFood is good not great but it is always consistent.\n\nThe three of us had:\nBruschetta : crostini served with mozzarella, marinated chopped tomatoes, minced garlic and fennel ( It is good but not something amazing and at $13 somewhat overpriced)\n\nThe three salads were all okay: The Cesar was very pedestrian, as was the house salad. \n\nThe only unique salad was my friend's brother's salad : the spinach salad which was really good ( spinach, feta, roasted almonds, peanuts and mushrooms with balsamic vinaigrette:  A very unique blend of items and tastes).\n\nMy friend Michele and I both had the tagliarini contadina (spinach pasta with chicken, tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms). It is well executed but pretty pedestrian.\n\nThe Salmon (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=juEiq2XuppveJouPqwOesw&userid=kroQYWSj-BhIEXT4VwLRHA) looked fine but was very pedestrian as well.\n\nOverall Osteria is a fine place to get a classic, consistent, yet uninspired Italian meal.", "author": "David G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-07", "description": "Last night I had one of the worst nights of my life after dining in this restaurant. It was 5:45 and I was headed in for an early dinner. When I walked in just before 6 the restaurant had one other couple sitting in it. A woman with long black hair asked if I had a reservation and I said no. She told us that the empty restaurant was fully booked for the night. My friend then let her know he had put in an open table reservation. Btw, open table had availability every half hour thru 9:30. They were not even close to fully booked. As the night went on we ordered food and had a lovely experience with our amazing waiter, Juan. We brought in two very nice bottles of wine and had them opened for us. In the middle of eating and just after opening our wine the same lady came over to our table gave us the bill and told us we had to leave bc a new reservation needed our table. I told her we too had a reservation so we were going to finish our meal, drink the wine, and then go. She told us we had to at least move to a different table bc even though we had a reservation it was booked by opentable and there is a time limit on how long you can stay with opentable reservations. That is not true. You can call opentable, we already did. We moved to the other table per her demand so we could at least eat our dinner and have our wine. As we moved seats we told her that in all of the years of living here we had never been treated so poorly in a restaurant. She then told us we could leave if we wanted to. I started to finish my food as quickly as possible as I just wanted to leave. She then returned to our new table to tell us how rude we were and that she'd comp our bill and to get out. I asked her to please leave our table as we finish up as quickly as possible. This is where the most horrific part comes in. As I'm eating my food, I see the restaurant being surrounding by 5 police cars. They rush into the restaurant and remove us. I have never gotten in any trouble in my life and we had done absolutely nothing wrong so needless to say I was scared and humiliated. I was immediately in tears so once the police took us outside they told us not to worry. They said they could tell we were good people but she demanded that we leave. They said  to just look at it as a free meal and to go enjoy the rest of the night. They were so kind to me and apologetic that helped with the initial trauma and fear of being bombarded by a barrage of police officers. \n\nIt's fair to say that it was one of the scariest nights of my life. I cannot understand why the woman did not want us there since we walked in or why were treated so abusively. I hope that this review is helpful and that this never happens to anyone else. :(", "author": "Lauren P."}

Over the past couple of years it has been at least once a month.\n\nMany other restaurants we've enjoyed over the years have closed and/or their food and service\ndeteriorated to the point where we stopped going.  Also, a number of restaurants have raised\ntheir prices to the point where we will go only for special occasions.\n\nOsteria has actually improved over time.  They have a diverse Italian menu, ingredients are always fresh, food is very well prepared, service is excellent, and their portions are very generous.  On many occasions we will order one or two starters and split the main course\nand walk out comfortably full.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food,  the portions, and the excellent service.\n\nI like to order a glass of wine with my meal.  Their wines go well with the food and the pours are\nvery generous.\n\nWe went there for dinner on New Year's Eve with two other couples who were not familiar with\nthe restaurant.  Everyone was very happy with the meal and the service was excellent.  They\nwere very busy that evening but we were seated right on time and servers did not miss a beat.\n\nThey had a special menu for New Year's and the price was appropriate for the occasion.  We\nactually wound up paying a little more than we would pay on a regular evening at most of the\nrestaurants where we dine.  Our friends were very pleased and Osteria will probably be where\nwe dine December 31, 2016.\n\nP.S.  Yelp sometimes takes posts out because they think they come from people connected to\na place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-16", "description": "We wanted very much to like Osteria, as its location is so convenient for us.  The reviews were quite mixed, but we decided to take a slot on OpenTable and give it a try on a recent Friday evening.\n\nWhen we arrived a few minutes before our reservation, the person who greeted us seemed surprised that we had a reservation, and told us we would have to wait. She blamed OpenTable for making a reservation they weren't ready to accept.  All restaurants can run behind, and waiting for a table on a busy evening is fine. What bothered us was the overall sense of annoyance that the staff displayed towards us and our reservation, far from the welcoming attitude we have come to expect in neighborhood restaurants.\n\nWhen we were finally seated, we were given a single menu for our party of 3, and were told they were dealing with a menu shortage. Fine, except that the larger party seated a few minutes after us had menus given to each guest, including several children. Despite the fact that we waited about 12 minutes for someone to take our order, we were not given another menu.\n\nThe food was fine but inconsistent.  The brussels sprouts appetizer was very well-done and tasty, with pleasing flavors and just the right done-ness.  My Chicken Marsala, one of the specials that night, was overdone and quite dry.  The sauce and accompanying vegetables were quite good.\n\nThe service could most generously be described as benign neglect.  No check-ins once we had ordered, no sign that our server was aware of how very long we were waiting for our meal.  Once our dishes were delivered, it was difficult to even get our water glasses filled.  By the time we were done, we just wanted to get the check and leave, but it took some time to even catch someone's eye to accomplish that.  Is it possible that this place was simply overtaxed on a busy Friday evening, and that we would have a better experience at another time?  I suppose so, but I do not plan to return to find out.", "author": "Jeffrey Z."}

I had a gone a few years ago and had a great experience, but unfortunately that was not the case on Friday. We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated immediately, which was great, but the experience went downhill from there.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine while we were perusing the menu (the Zin, which was a decent bottle for under $50) and while the waitress was pouring the wine I ordered an appetizer, the antipasto for two, and asked her a few questions on the menu. By the time she was done pouring, we were ready to order and did so. I went with the angel hair pasta with fresh tomato sauce, garlic and basil, and added prawns and my boyfriend got the spinach pasta with chicken, tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms. (Both were good, mine was better.)\n\nLess than a half of glass of wine later (so, I'd say less that 5 minutes), our pasta comes out to the table. No sign of an appetizer in sight. My boyfriend asked the waitress and she said oh, I am sorry, do you want me to put your food under a heat lamp and get you your appetizer? Of course we didn't want our pasta sitting around, so we declined, but were very disappointed. And while she did offer us free dessert about 5 minutes later, she didn't seem to really care that she had made a mistake. (We all make mistakes, but own up to it, right?) Also, the pasta came out so fast that we had no time to just enjoy the wine - the whole experience felt rushed. After we started eating I saw that other tables were being offered fresh Parmesan to go on their dishes - so I asked her to bring some over, and when we received the dessert we ordered, it was not presented as nicely as the other items we saw come out. I know, some little things, but if you mess up, which is human, at least try to make up for it!\n\nSo to recap, the food and wine, pretty good, the service? Needs improvement.", "author": "Jane F."}

Easy. My mom and I got there, and were the only people there. It took two minutes to get acknowledged. Despite every table being open and having a reservation, the waiter told us to come back. We shopped for a minute and came back, and were reluctantly seated. We considered just walking out, but decided to give it a try anyway.\n\nStill, we were literally the only two people in the restaurant. It nevertheless took minutes, the two employees were much too busy arranging seats for other parties who were not yet there. We made our order, and after the food arrived, we were not paid attention to at all for the rest of the meal. Other parties were arriving, along with a band. The waiter, a 40-something hipster who still went by Andy, had the same snooty attitude with all the other customers as well.\n\nThe terribly poor service, along with the generic, soulless atmosphere, made for an experience I'd not want to repeat. It made for an excellent opportunity to tell my mom all about the huge amount of entitlement amongst a huge percentage of San Franciscans, and how this type of BS is just so common these days.

We had never been there before.  The first problem was the set up - this place should never book entertainment.  Only the front two tables out of the 10 or 12 in the restaurant can actually see and hear the entertainment, a disservice to the artists and the diners. \n\nService was very slow due to understaffing.  There was one waiter and one busboy for the entire place.  The waiter had essentially given up trying to keep up; you would just have to wait.  It took 30 minutes from seating to ordering and another 25 minutes to get our appetizer and drinks and another 30 min. to get dinner, so I assume the kitchen was backed up too.\n\nThe food was adequate; of the four dishes we ordered, one was meh, two were ok and one was very good. The appetizers were ok...nothing special, but ok.  \n\nMay we hit a bad night.  The fact that one dish was very good indicates tht the kitchen can turn our outstandning food, but if they are rushed and backed up, don't expect it.

I've always wanted to try it but somehow never made it over there. That all changed last weekend. My boyfriend and I were on a loooong walk through the Presidio, to the Marina and back and decided to finally venture in when the warm glow from the bustling restaurant lured us out of the rain. We didn't have a res (obviously) but Gina greeted us warmly and told us we could wait for a table. She anticipated 45 mins. We decided to head over to Swank for a cocktail to \"kill the time\". That was fun! (See separate review for Swank). Then we headed back over to Osteria and Gina had our table ready for us! \n\nWe were immediately given some lovely bread and offered still or sparkling water. The menu looked awesome. We were hard pressed to pick just one starter and one entree but we managed. I started with the insalata della casa - a butter lettuce salad with delicious green goddess dressing. Dave opted for the Caesar - I stole a crouton and it was gooood. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine that Gina recommended to us and it paired perfectly with everything we ordered. I'm completely forgetting what it was - but for $42 it was a steal. Gina orders all of the wine for the restaurant so she is well acquainted with the wine list and can help you with any questions you may have.\n\nFor our entrees I ordered the linguine with clams in a light white wine sauce (amazing) and my bf ordered the tortellini with peas in a cream sauce. Both dishes were cooked to perfection. We seriously ate every last bite and almost licked our plates. Luckily decorum won out over gluttony. Phew.\n\nGina introduced us to their fantastic-looking dessert menu and while the cheesecake sounded out of this world, we just didn't think we'd have room after gorging on everything else. Gina comped one for us since it was our first visit and told us to enjoy ourselves. We did!!!\n\nFood: totally authentic, cooked perfectly and downright delish.\nService: awesome!

We were starving and hadn't eaten since before noon, and it was after 8p by now. We were going to make something at home but decided it was too late and we were too hungry to put in the effort, so I called Osteria. I ordered the grilled chicken (petto di pollo paillard alla griglia, as it's listed on the menu), and my girlfriend ordered the gnocchi. \n\nWhen I got home, the two meals were packaged nicely and were still hot. As we started eating, I noticed that the portions were good sized, the chicken was filleted completely and looked very big. The food seemed to be prepared well. I was pretty happy until my 5th or 6th bite, when I bit into a combination of chicken and vegetables and felt and heard something unusual as I pulled the bite from my fork. As I started to chew I realized there was a long hair that was intertwined in my chicken. To make it worse, the unusual sound I heard was the hair breaking numerous times. I removed the food from my mouth and began to inspect the chicken. I found 3 long hairs that had found their way into the fillet of the chicken. \n\nThis isn't the first time I found a hair in my food. Hair is natural and not unheard of in food preparation. I have even finished a couple of meals that had hair on the edge of a plate or even found laying on a portion of food. \n\nBut this time was different for me. In the context that Osteria is a \"nicer\" restaurant, and the price of the food was not that of a diner, I expect more. In addition the hair was intertwined in the chicken prior to cooking and was not simply on the edge or even on top of food. Unfortunately, I lost my appetite, and so did my girlfriend, and chose to not finish the meals. \n\nI understand that this was most likely an isolated incident, but I will not return to Osteria.", "author": "Jeremie B."}

The restaurant bathes in beautiful rays of afternoon sun giving it a sort of  golden glow; it's actually quite gorgeous! The atmosphere itself is very calm and serene but is sadly ruined by waitstaff running around like headless chickens. I mean honestly, there wasn't that much business when I was seated but the waiters and waitresses were coming in and out, back and forth, and it didn't look like they were doing much.\n\nWhen I was ready to order, I decided on the house gnocchi as the dough was made fresh in the kitchen and munched on my house bread. Not much to say on the bread; the olive oil was olive-y; maybe they could have added some additional spices like red pepper or parmesan cheese? Either way I was not impressed.\n\nWhen my Gnocchi arrived I was disappointed first in the portion size. When spending $20+ a plate I expect a little bit bigger of a portion rather than just a kids size meal. I finished my gnocchi in about 2 minutes with the intention of making the meal last longer. In a traditional sense, I suppose I should have ordered a main course along with my pasta but even still, the gnocchi was just alright. \n\nMy red wine was great and paired well with the pasta however the gnocchi was quite bland. I ordered tiramisu for dessert and found that tasty and authentic.

I finally have to get up and interrupt the hostess' conversation so we can order. Waiter is training someone but doesn't sound thrilled about the specials. That's the last we see if him. Someone else brings food. Luckily, the food is good (the only good thing).

They were also very accommodating with switching the sauces, which allowed me to pair the pancetta, cream and peas with my pleasurable pillows : )  Everyone else agreed the dish was great, as was the special of the evening- porcinis, tomato-cream sauce & sun-dried tomatoes (which they also gladly substituted gnocchi).\n\nAfter all that indulgence, the bill only came out to $82.

Just went to Osteria last night. I had done my research in advance and wasn't impressed by the wine list so I opted to bring my own bottle of '97 Barolo. At $15, the corkage fee is well below the outrageous price that other SF restaurants charge.\n\nWe started with the prosciutto dish and shared the radicchio salad---the dressing on the salad was perfect. Oh, and the bread and olive oil were both fresh and aromatic.\n\nWe then moved on to our entrees. She had the gnocchi was some of the best either of us have had in the city. I opted for the spinach pasta (Tagliarini Contadina) with chicken and shitake mushrooms in a tomato sauce. This dish was incredible. The pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection and the sauce was not overbearing, but instead highlighted the fresh pasta and the other ingredients. Both our appetizers and entrees were recommended by our waiter and he was spot on.\n\nThe service at the restaurant was excellent. We had a two hour meal and were allowed to enjoy our wine without being rushed through the courses. We ended with the tiramisu, which I wouldn't consider the best I've ever had---but it was decent. \n\nOverall, this was a great dining experience and you just can't beat the prices for such high quality food. I will definitely be returning to Osteria to try the other enticing dishes on the menu. \n\nPlease keep in mind, this is NOT a wine bar. . .it's a full service restaurant. So, for those of you who want to sip wine and don't want to eat---well, there are many other options not too far from the Vogue theater (Nektar, Terzo etc.).  \n\nSo be open minded, give this place a try and don't be so bothered by the \"older\" crowd.

In fact, I felt I was treated extremely well.\n\nMy friend had the eggplant parmagian, and I had meat-filled tortellini in meat sauce. (Tho if I were more decadent I'd go for the cream sauce). Fresh sourdough bread came with fresh butter (mmm, bread is only an excuse for butter), and then our server/manager gave us an extra special dipping bowl of love... a blended combination of fresh raw garlic, basil, oil, and balsamic vinegar, this sauce contributed to our eating about an extra half loaf of bread each!\n\nExcellent value for the dishes - only a few dollars more, in some cases, than an entree from the Pasta Pomodoro chain...if you can get this homemade stuff, why ever go back to PP?\n\nMy only regret, since my belly is so insatiable, is that the portions were too normal. ;) That is, with just an entree and a few slices of bread, I was still hungry.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2006-10-27", "description": "I've dined at Osteria twice in the past month for business dinners. Overall, the food is pretty good, the gnocchi is  *amazing*, and the desserts are sublime. \n\nThe space itself is trattoria like, and yes the clientele tends to be older....which makes sense given its proximity to the retirement center and its location on Sacramento street near the part of Pac Heights with all of the stately mansions.   In response to Alan E.'s review about aging and us \"younger folk\", I would like to say that the staff at this restaurant do not seem to treat customers of diverse ages equally, and this was evident to me in both visits.  Yes, we all age, some more gracefully than others, but at this restaurant there is a clear bias of catering to the older crowd. \n\n When I entered the restaurant I stood at the front waiting for someone to come greet me - somebody (the Maitre D? perhaps) came to greet me with a blank look....no hello, or even a good evening. I had to speak first, and then I was seated and the bus boy brought me some bread and water. No hello even from the assigned waiter (perhaps I would like a glass of wine while I wait for my companions?) Contrast that to the elderly party of three that came in right after me: that were greeted immediately, and kindly escorted to their table. The waiter was over in a flash with the specials of the day, with not a glance in my direction (I was seated at the next table!)\n\nI also agree with Karen F.'s review about being too loud, such that the other customers complain. I won't get into too much detail here, but one of our party was wearing a *medical device* that evidently some other customers were complaining about. We explained the need for it. Did we receive any empathy from the Maitre D' or owner? No, none. Instead, we were asked to rectify the situation so as to appease the other diners.  Sadly, our comfort , or shall I say discomfort, was of little regard to the restaurant.\n\nOverall, the food is good here, but the service is not. If you want to experience a fantastic neighborhood, locals only Italian street with a diverse clientele, delicious food and gracious service, go across the street to Garibaldi. You'll find it all there and more. \n\nAs for Osteria, three stars for the food, but minus two for the service.", "author": "Suepattra M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-21", "description": "Osteria is a great NEIGHBORHOOD restaurant.  I'm stressing *neighborhood* because there are plenty of regulars who frequent this restaurant weekly and are, thus, treated warmly and attentively by the owner and staff.  If you come more than once or twice, chances are you will be remembered and treated just as familiarly as the regulars.  If you come only once, you'll still be treated well.\n\nBefore you assume that the older clientele are treated better merely due to their age, consider the fact that you are visiting a restaurant in a neighborhood where locals actually live, shop and eat.  Many of these patrons ARE older folks, but most of them have lived in the neighborhood a long time and are fixtures at Osteria.\n\nCome here with blinders on if you need to, but come you must!\n\nThe owner told me that the spinach pasta is the only pasta that is actually \"fresh\", so I order that most of the time as my main dish.  If you ask, they'll use whatever sauce you want on whatever noodles you want ... even if the sauce is not on the menu.  \n\nOnce, I asked the owner if he would ever bring back the olive, caper, anchovy, pepper and lemon sauce, and he offered to go back into the kitchen and make it for me himself.  How many restaurant owners would do that?\n\nAs you've heard from others, the gnocci really IS spectacular.  Get it with the gorgonzola, cream and pine nuts and save some bread to wipe up your place.\n\nThe linguini with fresh tomatos and clams is indescribably perfect.  It's not at all too briny as one might expect of a clam dish, the tomatoes are so sweet and ripe and the pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente and heaped seductively on your plate with clams, tomatoes and garlic hidden in every forkful.  I'm drooling now.\n\nThe artichoke bottoms with shrimp and the caprese are my favorite appetizers.  The basil sauce that is served atop the artichoke shrimp dish could stand to be lightened up a bit ... perhaps with a squeeze from a lemon wedge? ... nevertheless, it's a great starter.\n\nIf you need a sweet finish to your meal, the crema caramella (grand marnier custard with caramel sauce) is a good choice.  There are several others to choose from if custard's not your thing.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:  Call ahead and make a reservation to be safe.  It's hard to say what nights you may end up waiting.  As I said before, it's a neighborhood place so there are plenty of nights when couples show up with their entire brood and you have to wait for a table to free up.  Other times, there's no wait at all if you just show up.", "author": "Jenny K."}

Then my tastes matured and I became a fan of Indian, Thai, Mexican, Chinese, Ethiopian, Senegalese, Cambodian, etc. and had no room in my life for Italian.\n\nThe other night I stopped in here with a friend while waiting for our movie to start across the street, and I was pretty impressed. There was a wide enough range of prices -- if I remember correctly, I could have ordered something for as little as $9, or for $18 or more. I settled on the linguine and clams for $13. I got a reasonably filling portion and really enjoyed it, while my friend had the tortellini in cream sauce with prosciutto, which I, of course, loved because it tasted like bacon.\n\nAs I was tearing my bread, I knocked over my glass and spilled water all over the floor -- before I got a chance to even react, three waiters were on the job. They were really polite about my mistake.\n\nAfter our main course, I had the hazelnut custard, which I loved, and an accompanying muscat wine that was probably the best I had ever tasted.\n\nBasically, this restaurant provides high-class service and flavor for a middle-class price.", "author": "Amy Z."}

Made Reservations for 3 @ 7PM and we were seated in a nice cozy private little section to enjoy what was about to happen. This is a very small local neighborhood bistro. Loved the menu selections starting with the Antipasti through the Zuppa and Ensalada and Pasta Courses.  Entrees' of course are superb. This kind of dining you will enjoy slowly and one course at a time. The food is to be savored and enjoyed. Don't expect huge portions this is not that kind of restaurant.  Perfect selections and portions sizes to enjoy while conversing with your company. Dolci of the homemade variety rounded out our evening. Wonderful neighborhood feel.

My husband is a big fan of the steak carpaccio  The tortellini is also delicious.  If they have a chicken special, get it.  It's always good.  The only thing I did not love there is the pasta with cream and peas.  Everything else I've tried has been great.  Meals are portioned right which allows them to keep the prices reasonable.

Didn't the cook taste it before allowing it to leave the kitchen?  Why ruin a dish like that?  Their house white California wine was downright disgusting.  Yes, we should have ordered an Italian wine, but we had a friend in from out of town, so thought California might be better.  What a bad idea. I would give it only one star, but the atmosphere is admittedly lovely.  The decor is pretty and the Italian arias and songs, playing not too loudly in the background, were nice.

I went to Osteria in hopes of a lovely evening with my work colleagues and we three were s00000 disappointed because: 1. the service was terrible; I had water splashed on me by a waiter at the table next to ours; we waited and waited and waited for EVERYTHING (dare I suggest it was because we were three women??); the waitress stood at the back of the restaurant staring offf into space and taking her sweet time and there were perhaps three other tables of diners,i.e. it was not busy; and our water glasses were never refilled; and we had to remind the waitress that we had ordered wine 3 time. ...2. The food was terrible: my salmon tasted like chicken that had been soaked in salt water and it had an unpleasant-tasting and unidentifiable sauce; my colleague's soup was \"terrible\" and my salad had a hideous dressing on it.When the waitress picked up my plate at the end of the meal, she looked at my salmon (much more than half remained) and asked me what was wrong. When I told her it was terrible, she said \"we'll get that taken off your bill.\" However, she came back later and said \"He (the manager) can't do it.

We did not have reservations and the host asked us to wait while he prepared one for us.

After about ten minutes, we were ushered to the table everyone dreads being sat at -- you know, the one in the far reaches of a restaurant, next to the restroom.  We kindly declined the table and requested one near the door that was available and were told that it was a three-person table.  (A three-person table?)  The host then told us he would see what he could do and we waited at the door and after a few minutes of not being tended to we left.  The host had a very faux-accommodating manner about him -- the one with the fake, put-on smile.  We were very nicely dressed but appeared at least twenty years younger than the rest of the customers who belonged to the mid-fifties, monied-seeming demographic.

This place does have the best gnocchi in San Francisco.  It isn't worth even ordering gnocchi in other restaurants.  You can have it with a fresh tomato basil or with gorgonzola sauce (both are exceptional). The only other place in the area that rivals is Della Santina in Sonoma.  In addition to the gnocchi, Osteria's  fresh spinach pasta with chicken that is excellent.   Another stunner is their chicken parmegiana which is made with a flatened chicken breast-- it melts in your mouth.
