This is a business, so save the attitude for after work and your foul mouth for the fair. \n\nAt the end of the argument they reeeeeally needed to make the point to me and themselves several times that they were voted \"BEST coffee in the Bay Area,\" right before they politely told us to \"just get out.\" (Queue slow clap.)

I always order a latte, so I can't speak to the quality of the pour-overs, chais and such. The lattes are excellent. If I have any quibbles, it's that they serve them a little less hot than I like them, but this is a trend I've noticed in all the better coffee houses. As a rule, it seems, the better the coffee, the more lukewarm the milk. \n\nThe interior, as others have noted, is that exposed brick style that feels both comfortable and too hip for its own good. Reading the other reviews, you'll notice that the music and its volume can vary wildly. I've been in there when there's no music playing (nice), and when there's hip hop playing at ear-splitting volume (not nice). Usually it's not too bad though. \n\nFor the laptop warriors, the WiFi is pretty good. It's better in the back of the space than in the front. As others have noted, there are not many outlets, so if your laptop won't hold a charge--first, shame on you for always using it plugged in, which probably caused the problem in the first place--you might want to go around the corner to DNA Pizza, which also has WiFi and plenty of outlets. \n\nThey have a good assortment of pastries, although these change from time to time. As of this writing, the scones are ginger, which are decidedly inferior to the previous fruit scones, but that could change tomorrow, so don't base your visit on the pastries you read about here. \n\nHaving talk to the various baristas, I can tell that Sextant really cares about the coffees they serve, and make sure the baristas are well-versed in the products. I have to assume the reviewers whining that their coffee was \"too weak\" either received an anomaly, or are so Starbucks damaged they wouldn't know good coffee if it bit them.

The coffee is fine, nothing special, and some of the staff are pleasant. \n\nThe main issues with this place have to do with the fact that it seems to be owned and/or managed by someone who really doesn't care. It's almost an interesting interior but they either ran out of money for a the renovation or really think that the gas station rest stop ambiance of the bathroom and the unfinished look of the roasting area and office add \"charm\".\n\nOther than that, they don't seem to understand upselling. Coffee places make a lot of money from selling additional food. There's never more than maybe a dozen total items (not a dozen different types of items) in their case, and they're usually sold out of them. Another business would take the constant selling out of items as an indicator that they should have more. And it's only a minority of times that they have non-sugar sweeteners available. If you're diabetic, you'd better not want anything in your coffee other than milk. And hey, refills of their very small cups of coffee are full price, $3.00. That's right. What looks to be about a 12 ounce mug of coffee is $3 and the refills cost the same as the first cup. Seriously, the owner is a really bad businessman, intent on squeezing nickels out of customers without providing a pleasant atmosphere. \n\nAgain, I go here sometimes because this is the only coffee place I've been to in the city that is regularly pretty empty on the weekends. At most coffee places, I have to get lucky to get a seat. Again, another business would take that as an indication to change something. Not this one.", "author": "K S."}

At the time they told me they had run out of the bigger cups, the following week when I asked they said it was the same amount of coffee as the old cups because they use less ice (it's not) and that it was the owners choice to use the smaller cups. I asked if it was now $3 instead of the usual $4 and the answer was no, still 4 bucks. In short, today I go to the new coffee spot at Mission and 9th (Coffee Cultures) because they too have good coffee, they give me more of it (16 oz cup), and it is cheaper at $3.50. \n\nThis may sound petty, but when I am offering repeat business in one of the most competitive business markets in the country, the little things count.

It's also great to see another roaster pop up.  \n\nHowever, when I inquired about how often they roast, decaffeinated specifically, they said once a month. Now, anyone who is really into coffee and who has roasted their own, or even done so much as study coffee roasting, knows that even properly refrigerated and stored roasted coffee is past its prime in a week, due to off-gassing. Hey Sextant.. roast less at a time, just more often. \n\nNevertheless, my market-rate pour over was tasty, a brightly flavored city+ roast.  Polite barista.  Cool enough space. The walls need a bit of artwork. \n\n(Keep your attitudes in check, lots of dinner guests prefer decaffeinated after a meal.)", "author": "Christopher M."}

Also, Sextant only has 2-person tables arranged (although I suppose you could rearrange them, they are all aligned against the wall).  The environment was pleasant - the roaster? was a bit loud at times, but what do you expect from an industrial-themed establishment? \n\nPastries looked great, and for $4 they better be phenomenal.

If I didn't know any better, I'd say that Sextant and Sightglass were modeled very closely after each other.  Both are based on (random) instruments, and both have beautiful modern looking spaces that allow in a fair amount of natural light.  Sextant has what appears to be a roaster all the way in the back part of the cafe, in addition to some beautiful exposed brick walls that are minimally decorated.  Both of us had pour overs with Africa beans and thought that our coffees were delicious.  The pastry selection seemed somewhat limited to cookies, but that could have been because we caught them in the early part of the morning before things had come in.  The barista wasn't the warmest person I had ever met, but she did help me figure out which coffee to get based on my preferences.  Overall, this sleepy and quiet place off Folsom was a great find and a great alternative to standing in line for some delicious coffee.", "author": "Lisa I."}

I guess sightglass is probably the big player for fancy coffee in this neighborhood. Sextant does somewhat darker roasts, and also blends a bit, so if super-light-roast single-origin isn't your thing please give these guys a try!", "author": "Wangston P."}

The baked goods were commercial. If they do roast their own coffee it's pretty tasty. Definitely better than some other big spots. The reason I am even writing about this spot is I think it might be the first fo-cobbler/hipster spot I've found. Wood paneling made of pallets-check. Old school sound system-check. All the fancy brewing machines-yup. Still feels like a front in there. Maybe that makes it more interesting.", "author": "Darius L."}

There was no artificial sweetener available. I told the counter staff I am diabetic and they suggested I use the sugar water that was there, which is just plain stupid.", "author": "Don T."}
