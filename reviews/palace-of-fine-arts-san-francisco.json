With its beautiful architecture, you'll be mesmerized in admiring each column, pillars, domes, arches, etc. \n\nA popular backdrop for social media, engagements or weddings for obvious reasons. The Palace was originally built in 1915 using Roman and Greek architecture, it sits around a gorgeous lawn to picnic on. An equally beautiful lagoon with fish, turtles and birds is also a sight to behold. Lots of greenery that provide shades and more characters all around this park. \n\nLots of locals and tourists walking around. You can't help marveling at the sight of this breathtaking landmark. I've seen it numerous times during daytime but I've seen photos during nighttime and they were equally stunning. I've added another item in my ever increasing bucket list, to see the Palace at nighttime.", "author": "Cris I."}

I guess I must have been living under a rock...hahaha!\n\nWe were in the neighborhood and decided to check it out. Its minutes from the Golden Gate Bridge and half mile from the Fisherman's Warf, right off the Marina District.\n\nFirst of all, anything that offers free parking and free admission is awesome, automatic double star right of the bat. We parked behind the palace and we were within easy walking distance to park grounds. The garden, lagoon and Greek-Roman architecture was breathtaking. I was blown away by enormous size of colonnades and soaring central rotunda, truly spectacular and unique. Definitely offers lots of photo ops. While we were walking around, we noticed lots of photography sessions happening, such as weddings and quinceanera. Of course, there were plenty of tourists too. We walked around park at a leisurely pace and enjoyed the beauty it offered. It was quite relaxing and peaceful. The huge pond even had ducks, swans and turtles.\n\nDefinitely a must when you visit SF.", "author": "Leo C."}

The city partially demolished the rotunda in 1964 to rebuilt it with concrete and the structure also underwent an earthquake retrofit in early 2009. The Exploratorium used to locate here since 1969, but it was moved to Embarcadero Pier 15 on April 2013.\n\nI really enjoyed walking around the lagoon because I got a sense of tranquility and saw a lot of wild life.

I think we were simply blessed to find street parking at our starting point. Many others had the same idea even though the day started off foggy. Some of it had burned off by the time we arrived so it was a cloudy day.\n\nThis Palace located in the Marina district of San Francisco was erected back over 100 years ago in 1915. It's pretty iconic this landmark as a wedding couple was there simultaneously getting photographed for wedding pictures. Obviously this probably is the most popular for wedding couples & is the most instagrammed. You would understand why once you visit this surreal place.\n\nAs we started to walk around the lagoon there was a woman there on her own bench feeding the pigeons. She needed the entire bench as there were huge bags of bread. In fact we had to carefully watch where we walked so we would not gingerly step on them. These pigeons were hungry & had a serious agenda! Get out of their way which we did!\n\nAs we walked passed the Australian eucalyptus trees I observed geese, ducks & a couple of swans. I thought the swans did a gorgeous job of being picturesque.\n\nIf ever you have a chance to come here it is free to walk around & observe the fabulous Roman & ancient Greek architecture. I read in one of the reviews there's a tiny parking lot but don't count on that. There is street parking all around. Come & enjoy. Don't take it for granted as it's pretty amazing.\n\nI've been to San Francisco so much in my lifetime that I was happy to finally get the opportunity to check this out. What have I've been missing? You will see once you arrive. It's so unreal. And. Don't. Forget. Your. Cameras. It's. Totally. Epic. Even. At. Night.", "author": "Karen K."}

I'm currently finished with my work contract and in between moving and looking for a new position so my days have slightly opened up to exploring. I like to work and send out resumes and do interviews the rest of the week but Monday's are MAYA days and that means exploration without robe crowds or traffic. I decided to research great places to visit in the bay area and through Google I was able to find this particular place. I had research this place about forfive months ago but between working and everything else in life I never had the opportunity. Like I said my schedule recently opened and I found myself wanting to finally visit this beautiful place.\n\nA little history I have always been obsessed with Greek mythology. Being part Greek I always enjoyed old architecture with the Greek columns in Roman architecture as well. I definitely wanted to see this place because it seem to embody such beautiful architecture. Arrive there on Monday and what's amazing about that is that the museum is closed so the parking right in front is open. Other than people sitting in the park area or benches just to have lunch it was pretty quiet and I loved it. I have read other reviews and seen so many pictures on different social media sites that show how busy it can get during the rest the week so the first thing that I really liked about this particular adventure was that I picked up Monday and everything was super convenient. (of course if you're not from San Francisco go earlier the better I left around nine and got there at 10 with barely any traffic.)\n\nAs you first enter you were totally mesmerized it's as if you stepped into another place and time. The architecture just speaks volumes it's so breathtaking and so amazing that this place is right in the middle of a neighborhood. There's a little Lake area adjacent to it that just makes it so much more beautiful and calm. As soon as I saw the architecture and the ancient style I was taken back and it reminded me of my trip to Greece. I would definitely recommend this place for photographers, people looking for adventures, architecture lovers, and a place to go and relax and have a beautiful view. I took a lot of pictures but I hope that you all will enjoy but the next time you're looking to find a venture go back in time and visit this beautiful gem located in San Francisco!!", "author": "Maya A."}

Just gaze at the pond, the rotunda, the infinite sky... it reminds me of Athens during the dawn of civilization or simply a Bridge to Terabithia. Yet, with all the fantasy & Fabio romance novels running through my brain it's really all about doing absolutely nothing in a city of doing everything. \n\nSome enjoy the Palace for the art shows and wedding shoots. For me, I simply enjoy a picnic near the pond with the swans, geese and ducks strutting around. Walking around and enjoying \"the ruins\". Exploring the grounds and admiring the rotunda close and from afar. Allowing your imagination to run free. It's okay to do nothing. It's the type of place to slow down and appreciate the now. \n\nThe Palace was built for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, a world's fair held in San Francisco, in 1915. It was to celebrate the completion of the Panama Canal, but it was widely seen in the city as an opportunity to showcase its recovery from the 1906 great earthquake. The fair was constructed on a 635 acre site in San Francisco, along the northern shore, between the Presidio and Fort Mason, known as the Marina District.\n\nMost of the surviving Palace and surrounding area is absolutely free, but besides the grounds there's also an arts theater (paid) that features a variety of cultural fare including live theatre, concerts, art exhibitions, and lectures. Wedding events can be held on grounds too, but you must reserve and pay the parks for such an experience. The Palace of Fine Arts is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a San Francisco designated landmark. A place to belch Andrea Bocelli! \n\nAhh the Palace of Fine Arts. A photographers dream and a dream for any fairytale. The giant columns, tranquil pond with elegant swans, and of course the greek inspired rotunda make it a place I always look forward to visit.

It was one of those- Been there, done that.  But not anymore.  \n\nAnyhow, I had no idea that there was a theater housed here.  I won tickets to see the Fab Four (a Beatles tribute band).

This romantic locale is a popular choice for both engagements and weddings alike, as well as a mecca for professional photographers and amateurs with smartphones. \n\nI was in a wedding here over the weekend, and though the rotunda was a wind tunnel, it was an absolutely lovely affair. Another thing to keep in mind if you choose this as an outdoor wedding venue is that it is a public park, and free for anyone to enter. Set up and packing up needs to go swiftly, and yes you WILL have an army of tourists providing their free, creepy videography services, and perhaps an elderly couple shouting at each other over part of the vows. It'll be windy, and it'll be cold. It's San Francisco, and the Presidio for that matter, which is first to be buffeted with incoming wind and fog from the sea. \n\nWho cares though! You got married at the Palace of Fine Arts! Vertigo. A View to Kill. The Rock. Filmmakers know as well as hopeless romantics; this place is perfect. For me, it invokes a sort of inner peace, though. During the waiting period before we did the rehearsal Friday night, I couldn't help but stand in speechless reverence at the pond. It's what I've done each visit since I was a child. A simply breathtaking place. \n\nParking: You wish. It's street parking wherever you can find the space, and walking for you, buddy.", "author": "Jenny P."}

I've seen many lovely, illuminating pictures of this place in the evening, but would love to experience the majestic lights and sights myself after sunset. \n\nFirst time I walked here was in Fall of 2015.

So, I happily said yes to that family, and they were very thankful.\u00a0 \n\nOn another instance, a lady saw me walking alone beside the map and taking pictures of the glory all around me, then she asked me can she touch my hair and some complimenting words! Ai ya. I hesitantly said yes so I could go about my way and continue my exploration. She was another random admirer of my long luscious locks of strands of hair. \n\nIn the beginning, I asked a nice woman to take my picture with the lagoon and dome shaped structure behind me. Then, I walked towards my right along a pathway and lured by the cute birds. I saw swans and ducks. Seeing swans I walked quickly towards them since they swam away towards the other end of the lake and I was thinking oooooooo swans! Must get a picture. Luckily they were nearby enough and I was able to record a video too. ^_^ I rarely see swans in my city.\n\nContinuing my walk around the lake path further to the tall pillars, I saw more pretty landscape too including plants and beautiful flowers. Finally reaching the dome, I was in awe when I was able to be amongst the wide, vast Roman & Greek architectural structures. Underneath the dome was beautiful! Wow, just simply amazing! Such beautiful designs and cool color. I liked seeing the angels. Perhaps they are guardians...those sculptures with wings. \n\nI tremendously admire the Beaux-Arts architecture.

I let her run around the Palace of Fine Arts.\n\nWell the day that we went, I took my brother and his wife, my sister and her husband, who is a history buff, historical with\u00a0information and told us a lot of stuff about San Francisco. \n\nIt was raining. It was cold. I was in my shorts, but I still went out walked around, took lots of video & pictures, saw the lake. There was actually someone in a wedding dress taking photos.

Hear me out!\n\nFor all my years in NorCal, I have never ventured to PoFA.  Even though it's free, I tend to avoid tourist spots like Joan Rivers's face avoids movement.  Too many photoshoots, crowded, no parking.. what a nightmare, right?  But, I found a parking lot out by the Presidio Arts Center that's worth the walk, since the Arts Center has a nice view itself and you can see the Golden Gate bridge beyond the freeway.\n\nThe Palace is so simple, yet so majestic.  I couldn't help but laugh at how I went to Europe in search for architecture like this, when there's one right in our backyard!  And imo, ours is even better, because PoFA has WATER.  You can see so many different species at this bird refuge.  Swans swimming alongside with last night's dinner (ducks) and other fowl that look just as tasty.  My eyes sure had a feast.\n\nSkip the Exploratorium.. it's pretty small and spacious.  I felt bad since it was funded by donations only, but with a great view outdoors, who wants to go indoors?!  Except of course, for their popcorn, which you can purchase inside.\n\nThis place has it all.. architecture, history, nature, wildlife, and popcorn!  Being here makes you forget all about the concrete-jungle surroundings.  Speaking of concrete, you lazy mofo's need to walk around on the concrete and not cross through the lawns!  This tramples the grass and degrades the scenic view.  Thank you.  My Greenpeace duty has been done.", "author": "Regina N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-17", "description": "Bottom Line:  A lovely park with a historic structure as the crowning jewel.\n\nThe Palace of Fine Arts doesn't resemble what one may traditionally think of as a palace.  Rather, the Palace of Fine Arts is an urban park with a Roman/Greek inspired structure at its center consisting of an impressive rotunda and colonnade.  The brief history on the Palace of Fine Arts is that it was one of many buildings built for the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition.  The Panama-Pacific Exposition was a world's fair that celebrated the completion of the Panama Canal.  But like most, or all, world's fair buildings, the building were meant to be temporary.   In the case of the Panama-Pacific Expo, the fair was only scheduled to run nine months.  Nevertheless, the Palace of Fine Arts survived many decades before it had to be torn down and rebuilt.  Although the structure was completely rebuilt in the 1960s it was built using the original design and the original foundation.  Even better, in this century the historic landmark was once again altered to withstand future seismic activity. \n\nUntil fairly recently the Exploratorium, a family friend science and art museum, used to be in an old exhibit hall immediately adjacent to the Palace building.  The Exploratorium has since relocated to Embarcadero Pier 15 so the real attraction at the Palace of Fine Arts is the historic structure, serene lagoon, migrating waterfowl, sunbathing turtles, flora and fauna.  The Palace of Fine Arts is surrounded by a level paved walking path that is friendly for brides on a photo shoot, families with little ones in strollers and the elderly that need a little stability from a handy dandy walker.  Those wanting to admire the beauty of this park for a little longer can bring a picnic lunch and sit on the nearby grass.  \n\nUntil recently I had only seen the Palace of Fine arts as a curiosity on the horizon.  I am glad I finally got to the Marina District to check out this fascinating piece of California history.  Props to all of those individuals and organizations who have fought tirelessly to save and restore this unique landmark.", "author": "Courtney K."}

We saw wedding photos being taken and a Quincenera girl with a stunning gown (whose colour scheme was much like the palaces) posing for her photos. \n\nEven though it was busy and active overall the palace grounds were incredibly tranquil.

As disclaimers to this as an event venue: 1) It's outdoors, subject to the elements of mother nature's weather; 2) No restrooms, other than if the neighboring indoor museum is open; 3) No electricity, and in fact you can only use battery powered amplification anyway; 4) You'll need additional permits for a reception (serving food/drink) as well as for any performances.  There's a whole set of \"do's and don'ts\" regulation, rules n' guidelines they both provide and can answer questions about.\n\nYou can just drop by and take photos for free, we've seen many wedding parties stop by with their photographers.  It's if/when you have an organized gathering that you need a permit for holding a service or formal get together.  Also, since it is a public venue, having a permit and reservations does not provide nor entitle you to exclusivity, and people can enter and potentially interfere, but most of those who visit are courteous.  What the permit provides you with is the rights to assemble, and if the Park Ranger comes by you'll need to have a permit.\n\nThe rotunda is nice, it gets a bit windy, but it is San Francisco, so it's to be expected to be unpredictable to plan too far ahead of time in advance for how the weather's going to be here.\n\nIt's open to the public and is a beautiful place to vist.\n\nParking is amazingly rather easy at the POFA too.", "author": "Rick S."}

The grand Rotunda is the central lure. The surrounding garden and nearby lagoon lined with Eucalyptus trees make for an elegant landscape for photography and videos. Plenty of swans, ducks, geese, turtles, and other wildlife add to the mystique of the Palace of Fine Arts.", "author": "Michael S."}

When we finally decided to visit this place I was lucky enough to find parking on Bay Street in front of a residence.  The signs said 2 hour max which was plenty of time to walk around the park for some nice photo opportunities.  \n\nThis park and the structures and ponds that make up the area are just beautiful to walk around and see.  There are plenty of waterfowl in the pond including white swans.\n\nParks like this one is what contributes to making San Francisco a very aesthetically pleasing city.", "author": "Lambert P."}

From what I understand, in the early 1900's the civic leaders of San Francisco envisioned a bold plan to bring the world together to encourage trade and to show the future of the world as it could be, and to demonstrate that a rebuilt San Francisco would be truly an international city.\n\nIt makes me feel some type of way when history itself is formed in the definition of the structure and is still standing strong.

Unless you're planning a picnic, photoshoot, or romantic stroll, this will probably be a short stop.\n\nIf you can only go once, it's best to go during the daytime.  Not only is the structure more visually awe-inspiring during the day, but the pond serves as a reflective pool, which makes for terrific photos.

I thought it might be less enchanting than exhibits of his later work but this is not true. He was a boy genius so the evolution of his early pieces and the story of his difficult young years is fascinating. One very much older adult found a museum aide and asked if there were water lilies anywhere (the exhibit ends before he created the iconic garden bridges and flora). Yes, they have Monet water lilies elsewhere. In conclusion, Monet's contributions were wonderful and the exhibit was very well curated.\n\nWe concluded with lunch in the museum. Every item on the menu was quite pricey but both our lunches were excellent so, oh well. I can not wrap my mind around some of the modern touches in the Palace such as a comic book style piece in place of \"The Money Lenders.\" But I have never learned to appreciate the sensibility of any art after mid-Picasso (forget where Chagall falls in this chronology--love him). I also didn't much enjoy the crude representations of human existence (they look like mud but are actually bronze) in the courtyard that used to be dedicated to Rodin. So, I am not sophisticated enough for 2017 and should stick to the tried and true. Or I'll have an epiphany someday at the MOMA.", "author": "Diana M."}

Also, there's lots of leg room, so if you have to sneak by people in your row, there's plenty of space to get by. It can get a little humid in the theater, so just be prepared.\n\nThe lobby area is spacious, and after the show they open up the side wall (yes, pretty much a wall) for easy exit.

On our way to get a picture at the Golden Gate Bridge we saw it from the road and did a quick U-turn to get to it.  We found a parking spot on the street close to the entrance.  It was a short walk to the area with all the architecture.  We walked around an checked everything out.  I'm not a big architecture person, but it was very cool to see this stuff in the middle of SF.\n\nMake sure to take a picture either in or with the rotunda in the background.  We didn't even realize there was a grassy \"picnic\" area across from the architecture site.  If we didn't have a previous engagement and were getting pressed for time we would have probably had lunch there.

In my opinion, it's worse than Disneyland and I hate Disneyland with the fury of a million modern day, bitter feminists who want to blacklist all who oppose their unilateral agenda while they worship their fair-trade, wooden dildos and comb the fleas out of each other's armpit hair. \n\nThere's nothing exciting about this place, except for maybe some duck or swan droppings you see hanging around the lake.  Normally I am inclined to sugar-coat and wrap my words in frosting in how I vocalize my opinions but our tour would have been far more interesting if I had planted my face into a mound of duck fecal matter instead of continuing the walk.  This is a free tourist attraction, meaning you can waltz in whenever you want at any time of the day.  For no charge.  They don't close it down for events that ought to be private, either. \n\nSo what I do have an issue with is when a couple of assholes decide to hold their wedding, in the main architectural structure, in the middle of the day like it's some circus at which others can gawk and stare.  I don't care who you are but if the voids in your lives are so big that you need to fill it with a wedding on public display, airing your vows through microphones throughout the park, and looking around to see if others are intently watching, you're a fucking tool.  And a cheap one at that. \n\nSome of the things that occurred on top of the wedding ceremony that no one wanted to see were: children climbing on the buildings thinking they're something more than a turd dressed in a human's costume, a woman posing with her newborn baby looking all sultry as the real reasons behind the photos are most likely for exploitative purposes, and too many families.  You will be hard-pressed to get a clear photo of anything. \n\nI wouldn't waste your time here.  This attraction is wretched beyond unimaginable proportions and would not even come close to putting this place on a pedestal.  It's trying to be everything that it's not.", "author": "Whitney B."}

Jimmy Stewart was psycho-obsessed with Kim Novak, so much so that he stalks her when she \"dies\" as frigid wife Madeleine and comes back to life as insecure shopgirl Judy. On their first date, they stroll wordlessly on Baker Street in front of a gauzy tableau image of the Palace of Fine Arts. I recall thinking what an elaborate set for Hitch to build for such a brief transitional scene. \n\nJamie W. and I came back to the Palace this past Saturday because it was a beautiful day, as we haven't visited since all the renovations were completed around the walkways and the lagoon. Bernard Maybeck's Greco-Roman design is ornately classical but softened by the hint of ocher in its finish. While the rotunda dominates the cityscape in this part of the city, the overall effect within this upscale Marina neighborhood is actually quite soothing with the colonnades standing guard over the lagoon festooned with gigantic white swans. The scene is quite lovely, a feeling shared by the dozens of pre-matrimonial couples who pose here for photos every weekend. See my 21-photo tribute for evidence.\n\nThe crescent-shaped former exhibit hall complements the curvature of the colonnades and houses the expansive Exploratorium on one side. The kid-friendly museum is moving to the Embarcadero soon, but the 1,000-seat theater remains. A great venue. I've seen a Crowded House reunion concert there as well as the annual Help Is on the Way AIDS benefit performance. Seats are spacious, always a treat when dealing with the inevitability of middle-age spread.

One of only a few surviving structures from the Exposition, it is the only one still situated on its original site. It was rebuilt in 1965, and renovation of the lagoon, walkways, and a seismic retrofit were completed in early 2009.\n\nBut my first thought when I saw it was \"Hey, that is where Nicholas Cage catches Sean Connery in the movie The Rock\", it is pretty unmistakable and recognizable, I am sure you can pick out a few more movies that feature this magnificent structure.\n\nIt may not be original original materials, but it certainly is historic and beautiful and a must see for any tourist.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-10-15", "description": "The Palace of Fine Arts Theater is probably the worst venue I've ever been to, and I might be including the dive bars. Here are all the things that went wrong at the Palace:\n\n*No obvious signs directing us to the theater. This led to a wrong turn and a detour around the entire building before we found the entrance.\n\n*Will Call line moved slowly. The woman had trouble finding people's tickets. When she got to us, she mis-remembered the name we'd given and spelled out for her. Meanwhile, someone else finally joined her and distributed two sets of tickets while we were getting ours. This problem is fixable--this probably wasn't her usual job and she couldn't adapt to change.\n\n*The ticket-takers were also mysteriously slow. In our line, it looked like the scanner didn't properly register the tickets. So the woman closed down our line and everyone had to merge with the other one. We simply walked through the door during the ensuing confusion. This problem also is fixable.\n\nThere are several reasons why you wouldn't want to sit in a theater that lacks a center aisle. I don't think these problems are fixable.\n\n*To reach the middle, you get to walk over 25 other patrons. We could have seated ourselves first if we'd been able to 1) find the theater entrance and 2) get our tickets and enter the theater, all within a reasonable amount of time. Instead, we got to walk over all 25 patrons (maybe there were a few empty seats). For my elderly parents, this seating arrangement is not relevant to their interests.\n\n*At intermission, the ones in the middle are the last to make it to the restroom line. Which makes you more likely to be the last person to return to your seat, after all 25 other patrons have returned as well. I try not to need a restroom at shows, but sometimes it happens.\n\n*(Speaking of which, the restroom accommodations are insufficient. There are a number of stalls, but the line was still super long. This might be a problem for theaters generally, so let's move on.)\n\n*My date didn't make it through the restroom line until after the second half of the performance had begun. It's good that he (and everyone else) could return to his seat (albeit in the dark) during the performance, but obviously it was a disruption for everyone around him. I was worried that I wouldn't get to enjoy the performance with him. It turns out that dancing with the one who brought me accounts for a large portion of my enjoyment.\n\n*If the theater happens to be overheated (which two out of the four Tenors who were performing that night mentioned while on stage, one while he was removing his tie to unbutton his shirt), then you'll love having all those extra bodies in the non-existent center aisle.\n\nI'm going to guess that they filled the center aisle with seats for extra revenue. I predict that they will not use this revenue to install signs directing theater-goers to the entrance.\n\nI couldn't appreciate the intimacy of this setting because it took an unnecessarily long time to get in, I felt trapped by people on all sides, needed to use the restroom at intermission, and couldn't tolerate the heat. Other reviewers liked the sound system, so maybe the sound people for The Tenors didn't use it properly.\n\nI cannot recommend that anyone attend a performance here, even if it's only to say that they've been to the Palace of Fine Arts. I'm sure the staff are all lovely people. But someone designed this place to be patron-unfriendly. You can't really undo that after the fact.", "author": "Doombunny D."}

So in order to reclaim its title of being the \"Paris of the West\" and a major metropolis, San Francisco put in its bid in 1910 to be the first of the century to host the 1915 World's Fair in honor of the opening of the Panama Canal.  \n\nAnd boy did S.F. do an amazing job in proclaiming to the world just how strong we were in our ability to rise up out of the rubble from the 1906 Earthquake.\n\nThroughout the World's Fair, the various other exhibits were housed in other European and \"Dome\" like structures throughout the Marina District toward Van Ness Ave.  But it was the Palace of Fine Arts that stood the test of time because of its beauty.  \n\nI minus One Star off of this review because of the fact that I dislike the fact that there are no information placards dispersed around the Palace of Fine Arts to educate the public of the significance of why this structure was built.

There were also two white swans floating in the lake. It was beautiful! We were still able to see some stars at night and a full moon. This is a great place during the day time too. You can pack a lunch and just sit on the grass (park area) to enjoy the view. Once again, if you don't like crowds you can avoid this place. This place can get pretty busy during the day. It's really romantic here at night. You can take a stroll with your beau/belle and enjoy the scenary. The parking here is much better in the evenings. \n\nI've been to the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre once to watch a circus show. I thought the show was pretty entertaining.\n\nIn the span of 10 years, I've been to the Exploratorium around 10 times (all for field trips with my class).

There isn't a center aisle in the theater, so you have to step over a lot of people to get to your seat.  Luckily, the theater is set up as stadium seating so you don't have to worry about an extremely tall person sitting in front of you and blocking your view.  And the rows are far enough apart that you don't have to step on anyone's toes when going in and out of the rows.  \n\nWe sat in Row N Seats 43, 45, 47, which were almost dead center.  The view was great.  I think this is another one of those theaters where the view is great wherever you sit.\n\nThey do have a parking lot, which they share with the Exploratorium.

This parking lot was on the left of the Bay street when you get off from Richardson Avenue. On the scene, there were multiple car burglaries that presumably happened at around the same time. \n\nThere was a constant people flow at the parking lot to and from the palace of fine arts. So it was hard to imagine those criminals would flagrantly break in visitors' cars.\n\nIn fact, when I parked my car in the afternoon of that day, I saw broken glasses in the parking lot. I was stupid enough not to be alarmed by that. This suggests that the criminals have committed car burglaries repeatedly at the same location on the same day. \n\nResearching such cases online, I found that the northern station of the SFPD has reported an increase of car burglaries in and around the palace of fine arts. They managed to make some arrests but obviously they have much more to arrest.\n\nGiven that such burglaries have repeatedly happened in and around the palace of fine arts, I also believe that the palace of fine arts management is responsible by not alarming visitors about such ongoing crimes. \n\nIn the end, I just want to alert all visitors who come by car about the ongoing crimes, be sure that you don't leave any valuables in your car under any circumstances, and avoid traveling to the palace by car if possible.", "author": "H C."}

Last night I came close to wetting myself on more than a few occasions during this almost 6 hour comedy performance.\n\nHost Lineup:\nBob Sarlatte, the voice of the 49'ers, an awesome host and funnier than sh*t. Proof positive that a hometown boy can do better than good.\n\nBobby Slayton, crazy and messed up in ways that any shrink would see a lifetime payday with issues upon issues. I loved Bobby and his brand of humor.\n\nPaula Poundstone, starting off by talking about the possible drinking problem she had in the past. I have to say that I was most impressed with her as the host and IMHP, she was the best host, sorry guys, but sometimes the best man for the job is a woman. Paula is so freaking talented and can do improv better than any other on stage this night. She went into a dialog with someone from the audience that quickly had everyone in stitches and continues to use and abuse the technical writer who was (un)lucky enough to be chosen. I'm sure that his entire career will be based on this evening. It's all about standards, some were set this evening.\n\nHighlights:\nDana Carvey telling stories about his kids and what it's like trying to reason with teenagers. Considering that his wife of 23 years recently died of breast cancer and he's up doing his act, its was just a poignant moment of truths and irony. Hats off to you Dana!\n\nSome Black Woman, sorry don't remember your name, but I do remember how you mastered a poem, off the cuff, entirely relevant and thought provoking on the subject of France. You were so incredible, smart, quick and full of wit. I wish you were my neighbor. I would bring your freshly baked cookies every sunday afternoon.\n\nKevin Pollack with his impression of Christopher Walken. Hilarious.\n\nBobcat Goldwaith, you were my favorite of the night with your poo and the funniest thing in your life. I wont be able to hear a siren without thinking of you and if I ever have the same true life adventure I'll hope for the same special passengers as you. Your ability to set up a story, lead us down the path, take a quick turn, come back, take three steps, make a u-turn and deliver a satisfied ending. \n\nMy ribs are still sore and I'm jonesing for more.\n\nGreat performance from everyone! Thanks for being who you are.\n\nPaula, I'll see you when you're back in town.", "author": "Steve S."}

Don't worry though; there's plenty to see and enjoy no matter how much you hate our collective past.\n\nIt is pretty easy to get here although you might have trouble finding parking in the Marina area.  I've always parked within Presidio and walked or taken the free shuttle the makes loops around the whole park.  Easy peasy, livin' greasy.\n\nIt's a great place to hang out, read, shoot photos or role-play Spartacus. Unsurprisingly there tends to be lots of wedding groups at prime times, and there are a lot of ducks. Oh, and two swans. One swan didn't seem to like the ice cream a bride-to-be was trying to feed it.

It's rare to slow down and enjoy the landmarks of the city, but we did just that this weekend.  A lovely walk around the 'lake' area, buying ice cream from the cart, and sitting watching the world go by... all with this beautiful towering art before us.  The structure truly is amazingly beautiful.  I've been to a wedding here before, under the dome.  While beautiful, it was hard to hear everything, and the wind blew right through - so personally, I prefer a different venue.  But imagine the pictures you'd have with this place as the background?  You can't beat that.  \n\nSadly, some areas of the structure are fenced off for renovation.  I guess that's better than the talk of wanting to tear it down a few years ago.

One of the first things (and one of the most impressive) that your eyes will gravitate towards is the golden round top of the Palace of Fine Arts.\n\nSomehow the place has managed to slip through the common \"squeeze\" of crowded space in the city (the kind that makes you want to pull your arms in very close towards your body, then outward to shove that feeling of claustrophobia away) and sits seemingly all alone in its claimed space in the \"Marina\" District (what I consider part of the Marina anyway).  The property is gorgeous --- beautiful enough even for Sean Connery in the film, \"The Rock\" haha!\n\nAt the theatre I once watched Henry Rollins perform.  I remember he was talking about being in LA where his home is, and how he has this squirrel out back that is one of the most intriguing creatures he's ever seen.  He goes on to describe how this grey squirrel will come right up close to the house and lie on a wood pile on his back and bask in the sun.  Rollins says, \"he looks like he's at the beach with his arms behind his head and a leg crossed --- like he needs sunglasses on\" and he's so impressed with this animal that he'll sneak through his own house (crawling on the floor over to the window where just the tops of his eyes peak over the ledge and outside) trying to observe this creature, but not disturb him...  The whole crowd was cracking up trying to picture this and at that moment it occurred to me just how solid the sound quality is here.  \n\nIt is a perfect spot for a performance (I can only imagine seeing a play that requires less involvement from the audience) --- easy to see the stage from anywhere, sound carries famously throughout the place, etc.\n\nTwo thumbs up!", "author": "Benjamin G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-22", "description": "The Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco is sadly not the actual house of horror I thought it was when I first heard the name. One of my favorite books is The Devil in The White City by Erik Larsen which tells the story of the serial killer Dr. H. H. Holmes and the 1893 Chicago's World's Fair nicknamed the \"White City\". At the time of the fair, Dr. Holmes lured an unknown number of helpless women to their death in the World Fair's Hotel and struck fear into the residents and visitors of Chicago (similar to SF's very own Zodiac killer). When I first saw the Palace of Fine Arts in the Marina, I thought \"how cool\", but my friend pointed out this was built 1915, not 1893 and this is San Francisco's Palace, not Chicago's and I was in the wrong place. \n \nAlthough it's not a house of horror, it's still one of my favorite spots in the city. San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts was built for the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition to house works of art presented there. Due to its unsiesmically sound structure, the original Palace was demolished in 1964 and a replica rebuilt in its place. The new Palace is almost exactly the same as the old except for the absence of the murals in the dome and a few lesser details. Today, the Palace is also home to the Exploratorium and 1,000 person theater.\n\n The Palace is popular among locals and visitors. The lagoon and its white geese as well as the manicured green lawns make it a picture perfect picnic spot. On a sunny day in the city, the lawn surrounding the lagoon is teeming with families, couples and friends enjoying a bite to eat, relaxing in the sun, or flying a kite. The Palace is also popular for engagement and wedding party pictures. It's a beautiful old world backdrop in the middle of a modern city. I always make a point to bring out-of-town visitors here to show them the beauty, diversity and history of San Francisco. The spot is so iconic that Disney made a replica of it in Disney's California Adventure Park. Even Disney thinks it's important!", "author": "Alice S."}

I took a few pictures there and they came out so well it would give the illusion that I am a professional photographer.  I love anyplace that makes me look better.  \n\nSo if you are in the marina area.  You have a friend or someone whose company you just can't get enough of...take a walk to the palace of fine arts.  And enjoy yourself, the day and one of the things that makes SF so special.", "author": "Kierstan G."}

The venue is beautiful, with a smoothly running box office area and a large lobby with snacks and festive decor.

It needed some background photos, etc. It had been a while since I had been there. I was surprised to see a chain link fence around the place. Kind of takes away its splendor. \n\nSad that so many places that used to be open and free have to be locked up or placed under extra security. I guess that is the way it is now. \n\nUsed to go to the Exploratorium as a kid. That was a fun place. I doubt that people today would find the homespun science exhibits interesting since everything today is video games and digital. Not easy to get people these days to pay attention to much of anything away from their i-Pod or cell phone. \n\nI see that there was an international dance festival at the Palace's performing arts theater. Perfect place for it, so good to see cultural events there. \n\nYet, fence or not, the Palace still is grand and definitely a landmark. I get chills when I walk under the dome and see the angels in the architecture. I call them Maybeck's angels because Bernard Maybeck was the architect. \n\nSee web link: \nhttp://www.oregoncoast.net/maybeckpalace.html \n\n\nHard to believe that this palace was just one of many elaborate buildings for the Pan-Pacific Exposition of 1915. See web link: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama-Pacific_International_Exposition_(1915) \n\nThey were only temporary buildings. \n\nAnd that like the Mid-Winter Exposition of 1894 that gave birth to the Golden Gate Park, these events were celebrations lasting months to encourage people to visit the city. Yet they were built only for that event and to be taken down. Amazing! \n\nI know that there was a major effort to make the structure of the Palace more permanent. Just recently the large dome was renovated. It was painted a bright orange for a while. Made the dome really stick out. \n\nIt reminded me of as if someone had a big orange in the mouth. Or as it was a giant ball. And, that the ball would start bouncing out like a big balloon at any second moving skyward. \n\nOne of my favorite photos of the Palace of Fine Arts is the one with singer Janis Joplin and her car parked on the lawn. Classic picture moment! And she was so happy in that photo. \n\nSee web link for photo display: \nhttp://www.wolfgangsvault.com/dt/janis-joplin-fine-art-print/JMP0042-FP.html \n\nWould not be able to snap a photo like that today with the chain link fence.

Honestly, I think it's not as well known as a theater because the entrance is somewhat hidden. You have to drive around the place to see the entrance. It's not a grand entrance either, so you might mistake it as a loading area.\n\nHowever, once you do go inside, it's quite amazing actually. There's a panoramic canvas picture in the lobby area showcasing the area around the Palace of Fine Arts in the early 1900s. It's a real picture! Pass the lobbying area, you enter a huge room with seating, restrooms and food service. \n\nThere's two entrances into the theater. Inside the theater it was vastly decorated in red. I don't know if it is normally like this, but red curtains, red seats, red ceiling. It was a bit overwhelming. The theater seats about 1000 people. The seats are old but still comfortable. There was lots of dust bits on the seats and stains. I think it's time to redo the seat covers!\n\nI attended the inaugural Go!Style concert here last Friday. The theater has an amazing sound system.

Within just a few blocks of trendy Chestnut street and its lovely hip restaurants, and literally smack next to the Exploratorium, the Palace of Fine Arts certainly doesn't have problems with foot traffic.

Built for the Panama-Pacific Exposition in 1919, this Roman Beaux-Arts collonade and fronting water lagoon and fountain along with its hillside park is one of the reasons why San Francisco is so picturesque and worth the trip.  Why it's great:\n\n1.  It's free!:  while the renovations seem to stretch into eternity and I never have seen anyone work on it in the interim, the Rotunda and the colonnade have been a favorite of many SF natives and prefer to take pictures on the green in front of it.  I envy the Marina residents who have such a beautiful \"front yard\" that they don't have to pay for (although may be it through taxes).  It really is a living room that is outdoor, and accessible to all, although the parking gets a little stifling in the neighborhood.  \n\n2.  One of the key landmark features of San Francisco that is in movies:  it's interesting to know that the Palace of Fine Arts has been the preferred scene of location on choice for filming \"The Rock\" (with Nicholas Cage), Nash Bridges and Monk.  It's always cool to walk around on a place where they've filmed and see it for free.\n\n3.  Iconic architecture to appreciate in your own backyard:  with the Golden Gate Bridge a minute or so away,  Presidio and the Marina Green, no wonder this gem of architecture instantly is recognized as a SF landmark.  With a picnic lunch and shooing the nasty pigeons away from your feet, the appreciation of the Palace's beauty is really a must-to do list on your SF list of things to do in 24 hours.\n\nFive Yelp Stars for the Palace of Fine Arts!", "author": "JC K."}

Better late than never, because this place should go on any tourist's \"must-see\" list! A symbol of the never-yielding hope of a city when its people come together, the Palace was originally built for the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition, less than a decade after the destruction of the city by the 1906 earthquake and subsequent fires. Originally made of wood and plaster, the structure was completely re-done in the 1960s with steel and cement and has since had numerous structural reinforcements. But beyond that it is such a serene, beautiful place to visit. Nestled in a residential block and fronted by a duck-filled pond, the Palace is a great example of what I admire most about San Francisco: the respect for history and great architecture. If you happen to be staying in the Marina/Cow Hollow District (like we are), it is an easy walk. Go in the morning to avoid crowds and get a full sense of the serenity this place has to offer.

At first they put up a fence between the sidewalk and the crumbling water's edge. Ok, no more falling in. But it was chain link and really ugly. That was up for maybe 5-6 years (?), then a year and a half ago, they fenced it all off for repairs. \n\nThe Palace of Fine Arts is finally repaired!!! The newly weds are back for their photos, the people feeding the birds, the kids, the tourists. It's wonderful. The new benches are very nice, the walkway is great, heck, the trashcans are even nice.

You wanna savor it, like a small piece of dark chocolate on your tongue that you just let melt and hang out a while. Only you are the chocolate not the tongue. It's not cheap. There are certain days that are free or reduced price. I don't care because it's supporting art and culture, somthing we lack in modern life. But is money is an issue for you, pick a day that will make it easier on your wallet. The special exhibits are usually not considered part of the experience of the regular entry which only gets you a view of the permanent collection and a few other areas.

I'd never been to the Palace of Fine Arts before, and I'm so glad I chose today to check it out.

See when I was about 5 I had a bad duck feeding experience. Basically I got surrounded by a bunch of really aggressive geese (damn those birds are crazy!) which caused me to freak out and start running towards the parking lot with the bread still in my hand. Naturally, the crazy, aggressive geese began chasing me through the park while my aunt stood there screaming \"Drop the bread!!!! Drop the bread!!!! Aaaaaggghhh!!

She can now take me out to dinner and clubbing every night.  I don't know how they let her graduate cuz if they would just read the manateeisms they would know she needs remediation.  The venue was nice.  Small for a formal graduation.  Masonic center is under construction this year so alot of grad schools are finding new venues.  My grad school is graduating at the Hilton this year.  Suckers.  I would be offended.  The entire time during the commencement I felt like I was being interviewed for admission into UCSF.  They would selectively bring a couple of students and read off their old applications and achievements.  It was weird. These people are obviously nerds so we don't need to know how times per day they take a shit.  It was crazy.  The commencement focused mainly of the top students in the class and not the entire graduating class as a whole.  It was weird.  Obviously the manatee isn't the brightest but she is the best at keg stands.", "author": "Fatty A."}

Especially on a sunny day when you can see the light poking between the columns.  It's a throwback to ancient Rome and Greece and all things grand.  Swans and ducks sitting on top of a pond.  Makes me want to get in a small rowboat and lay in it on the middle of the pond.  One day I'll go here and take a ton of pictures and put them on my walls.", "author": "Mary H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-07-22", "description": "Seeing Beck here a couple of years ago was sort of surreal--it felt like we were in the best theatre venue in Midland, Michigan.  Beck's show didn't help.  This was the oddly self-reverential (word chosen carefully) acoustic-ish show where he at one point had dinner delivered to him on stage and proceeded to eat it while his companion played.  He was so into himself through the whole set that this show killed the whole Beck thing for me.  Where the Palace of Fine Arts Dome is a wonderful semi-archaeological oddity here along the bayfront, this theatre is more of a semi-theatrical oddity.  It feels like an odd size, largish but not huge, smallish but not intimate.   The seats are one long unbroken row so it's a pain to get into them if you come too late.   However, it's a shallow space from the stage to the back wall, so all the seats are relatively close.   http://www.palaceoffinearts.org/", "author": "Kevin S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-09-17", "description": "So I came to the Palace of Fine Arts expecting this big grandiose sort of...palace.  I figured if you name it the Palace of Fine Arts you expect it to be a palace.  Palaces are supposed to be grandiose.  But anyways, it's not quite like a palace, it's more like a theater which it is.  I came to the PFA as I'd like to call it, last weekend for the Axis of Evil comedy show (which is a group of comedians who are all Arab Americans), by the way, is absolutely hysterical.  Now when you come to a theater of any kind, the seat plays an important role on if you enjoy the show or not.  You never want a creaky or loose chairs but the PFA surprisingly had decently sized chairs that were actually somewhat comfortable.  It was also fairly easy to get out of the theater as well.  I take 1 star away for it not being more palace-like and another star away for the front box office area, too small and gets confusing when you have a line that snakes around the room and you don't know where it starts or ends.  But overall, the experience was good.", "author": "David C."}
