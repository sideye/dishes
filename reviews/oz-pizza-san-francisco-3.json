There are three little tables out front and theres a sign on either side kinda shielding you from the pedestrians. \n\nI like the combinations offered here (ie; basil, sausage and ricotta) but they definitely looked better than they tasted. I also had a regular ole pepp slice. They were both piping hot and the crust was okay. The cheese was the cheaper kind though so it was lacking some flavor and neither slice had enough meat. \n\nOverall it was just ok. I'll try the pizza place on the end of Castro close to Market Street next time. I was just too close to my car to head back that way this time.", "author": "Marilyn M."}

The crust was so thin and soggy I couldn't get it off the plate and had to scrape it off with a fork to eat it.  \nStill hungry I got a second mushroom slice and the crust was so thin it didn't even make it into the oven in one piece.  The guy at the counter looked extremely embarrassed and said he'd put a different one in for me which I declined because I could tell it wouldn't matter as all the other slices looked as pathetic as that first.  \n\nNote to the cook - Leave more dough in the center of the pizza so it doesn't get so soggy and will become more crispy.  \n\nThis seems like something that should be very easy to fix.  I can't even imagine what the slices with more than one topping turn out like.  \n\nWho's is in charge? A line of five or six people built up at the counter when the phone rang.  The server finished up taking a couple orders, put the person on the phone on hold, helped a couple other people then went back to take the phone order.  It took a while on the phone so a bigger line built up at the counter.  The entire time the cook was literally lying down on the freezer chest in the back.  If I'm standing in line waiting on food I don't ever want to see an employee lying down.  That's just ridiculous.", "author": "Karyna F."}

Feeling lazy and ordered for delivery for the first time since the ownership change. The pizza you pick up as a slice has a medium-thick crust. It's not the greatest pizza in the world, but it's pretty good in a pinch. \nPizza that arrived by delivery is cracker thin and was overcooked to a sad, slightly burnt crunch. It's pretty clear that they have a completely different recipe for their delivery pizzas and don't take a lot of care with the preparation. Simultaneously complaining that something is not that good and that there isn't enough of it is silly, but we were surprised that our large pizza order was so tiny. For the quantity and quality, I found it to be way overpriced. Stopping in for a slice is your best bet. For delivery, skip it.", "author": "LISA K."}

They have some interesting pizzas with unique toppings like alligator meat and kangaroo meat (both of which are pricey for pizza), but we stuck with mostly classic pizzas. The crust was thin enough for the pizza to be somewhat floppy, which I liked, but still thick enough to hold together, and despite being pretty bland and flavorless, it was pretty fluffy and doughy, which I also liked. The pizzas were a little greasy, but that's pretty typical for pizza. I would've liked a lot more tomato sauce though and a little less cheese.\n\n-CARNIVORE'S DELIGHT - 3/5\n[pepperoni, sausage, salami and canadian bacon]\nPretty standard/average meat lover's pizza. Nothing super special, but there's a good amount of meat.\n\n-POTATO PESTO - 3/5\n[roasted golden yukon potatoes, garlic and pesto sauce]\nMeh. I was expecting more from this pizza, but I found it underwhelming. Oddly, I really liked the garlic. Lots of whole roasted garlic cloves but surprisingly didn't taste too garlicky.\n\n-MOZZARELLA WITH ARUGULA (custom) - 1/5\nSuper disappointing. I was expecting the pizza to be topped with arugula, but they cooked the arugula into the pizza, under the layer of cheese. There was barely any of it and since there was also barely any tomato sauce, it was just too much dough and cheese.", "author": "Jessie L."}

Had the combo and it was 4.75 whereas a combo up the street was 4.20 and the combo included unique combinations!! Also, the crust of this pizza was very think and full of flour. If it had flavor, would have been so much easier to finish up the slice. However, crust was extremely flavorless. A plus is the pizza had plentiful toppings and cheese(which made pizza very oily, so I suggest soaking the pizza with napkins first)! \n\nAdditionally, I was very disappointed that they didn't toast my pizza slice just like any ordinary pizzeria would have. I mean, the pizza was warm and all but it would have tasted more fresh and crunchy if toasted before given to me. All in all, my first experience here was not all that great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-17", "description": "This review is based on delivery only. \n\nI have ordered twice now from Oz via the Order Ahead app, and Oz has not disappointed. I love that they will deliver to Twin Peaks, as sometimes it's hard to get businesses to deliver up in my hood. Paxti's Noe Valley won't deliver to our place, for example. And I need more options besides Twin Peaks Pizza. \n\nThe first time, I ordered chicken wings with blue cheese, and made my own medium pizza with pesto, garlic, ricotta, mozzarella and meatballs. This pizza was ON POINT, and I impressed my boyfriend with my ordering prowess. The second time I thought I'd mix it up, so I ordered the chicken wings, and an XL (mistake unless you need to feed a small village--we had pizza coming out of our ears, and the box wouldn't fit in the fridge) with pesto, meatballs, garlic, artichoke, feta and mozzarella. There wasn't enough feta, and the artichokes did not work with this combo. \n\nTIP: You will get a much fresher tasting pizza if you custom order. I see a lot of the low star reviews say that the pizza tasted old, like it had been sitting around. Order a pizza they have to make from scratch so this doesn't happen. Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands. \n\nThe only thing I don't like about Oz's pizza is the crust, I think it needs salt big time. But it's not bad enough to deter me from ordering again. Otherwise, we really enjoyed it. And we LOVED the chicken wings. You are going to want those-just make sure to wear pants with an elastic waistband. Those wings are great for game day, or any day, really. My boyfriend is crazy about the wings, and he is pretty discerning when it comes to chicken wings. We like that Oz knows to have a blue cheese option. \n\nThe delivery is fast, the wings are good, and the pizza is not bad. Overall, you could do a lot worse.", "author": "Sunny S."}

The guy working was really friendly and chatted with me for a bit before taking my order. As much as I wanted to try the Wild Alligator pizza I just couldn't stomach it! Still think it's pretty cool that they carry it though, very unique and gourmet of a hole in the wall pizza place. I went for a plain pepperoni and my friend went with a meat and veggie slice instead. Pizza quality was really good, you don't really get this quality of pizza from hole in the wall pizza joints in LA no matter how popular it may be.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-01", "description": "I've ordered delivery from Oz pizza through Eat24 twice and stopped in the store once for a slice to go. \n\nIt's decent pizza but not extraordinary. (I am well-known for my love of pizza, so I'm confident in my ability to identify truly tasty pies.) Their toppings are tasty and pretty creative. The toppings themselves always taste perfectly fresh, but the crust is mediocre. Normally I love eating pizza crust but theirs just isn't worth the calories. Seriously, it's rubber, floury junk. However, if they improved their crust, they would be among the top contenders for best non-artisan pizza in the city. \n\nTonight I ordered the Caprese pizza. It's a lot like a Caprese salad. I added ricotta to mine and it was magnificent. These guys really know how to make their ingredients shine. But alas, gnawing on the cartilaginous crust exhausted my weak jaw. Le sigh. \n\nOne thing really bothered me about my order though. Based on the options on the menu, I ordered a Diet Coke and a Sprite. When my food was delivered, I received a Diet Pepsi and a 7-Up. Uh, that's not what I ordered... I know it makes me look like a first world jerk to distinguish this, but I hate both 7-Up and Diet Pepsi. If they had advertised their sodas properly, I wouldn't have wasted my money. I'm not trying to be a jerkwad about it, but it kind of reminded me of the lawyer in Boston who threatened legal action against the Chinese restaurant that misrepresented their prices. So that kinda ticked me off...\n\nAlso, I was rather offended by the guy who delivered my pizza. He delivered it on time, but he was unacceptably rude. He called me and immediately commanded me to come outside because he had been waiting for 10 minutes. He said, \"I know you're home because your dog is barking.\" (Which doesn't even make sense, I'd like to point out.) I live in a studio apartment below my landlord's apartment, and I could hear her dog barking. I told the guy that he was at the wrong apartment and that he should have gone left at the top of the stairs not right, but to just wait there and I would come outside. I have the directions clearly written out and linked to my Eat24 account. Probably 80% of the delivery people understand the directions fine, but I don't get mad when there's miscommunication. Except tonight, the guy starts arguing with me. \"I did go left,\" he insisted. \"You don't know left from right!\" Um, excuse me? I paid a 15% tip in advance and usually I'll tip the driver another $3-5 if they arrive at a reasonable time. For that, I expect to at least be treated politely. I felt like he was picking a fight with me just because he didn't properly read the instructions. Totally inappropriate. I didn't catch his name, but I think he was driving a yellow car. Between the false advertising about the soda and the antagonistic delivery driver, Oz's Pizza lost a full star for my rating.\n\nOn a side note, I wish they had more side-dishes.

The pizza is good, served by the slice as always and it's got a thinner than the normal pizza crust, it's toasted to perfection on the bottom, which gives the pizza a little crunch, but not like toast left in the toaster at setting 6, everyone knows that that is the worst. There is a variety of vegetarian options potato pesto; veggie combo with olives, white onions, and green pepper; mushroom; and cheese; and tomato, basil, and pesto. If you like things spicy, try the BBQ chicken with jalape\u00f1o or the Pepperoni with jalape\u00f1o. OH THEY HAVE 6 BEERS ON TAP AND SERVE WINE! Nothing like a slice with a cold one.

This was when I began paying attention to the food. I had the bacon jalapeno and combo slices. The jalapeno is quite spicy, which I am fine with. All I could think about was the pizza bread however. The crunchiness of the bread was PERFECT! Not too hard, not too soft. Dining area is clean and spacious. I finger checked the dining table, neither sticky nor dusyt. The fact that the owner came up to the customers and acknowledge everyone shows me he really cared about the food that he makes. When I gave him my feedback about perfect crunchiness of the bread and he responded that it does cost more to make the break. This showed me that quality ingredients and not skimming matters to him.
