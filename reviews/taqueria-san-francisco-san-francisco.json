(Still doesn't come anywhere close to San Diego's Mexican food, but it's good for SF!)\n\nI've tried the fish tacos, al pastor tacos, and al pastor regular burrito - all were decently flavorful and in good portion sizes. If you eat there, you can scoop on as much of their salsa as you want from the little containers. I wish the fish wasn't chopped into small pieces, as I prefer fish tacos with whole pieces of fish, but they were nicely grilled and quite aromatic.\n\nThe chips that come with the tacos/burritos are possibly my favorite thing here yet! So fresh and oh so crunchy. I couldn't stop eating them even though I was pretty full already. If you get take out, you'll get a small container of guac and another of salsa to go with the chips as well.\n\nThe people here are also pretty nice. It's super close to the SF General Hospital, so I saw quite a few people dressed in their hospital uniforms drop by to grab some food, and several of them were greeted by name or at least with an extremely friendly hello.\n\nRestroom is quite clean; open to customers only.\n\nLooking forward to coming back and trying more of their food!", "author": "Ivonnie S."}

How it stretched from one side of the bitten burrito to the other waiting to be consumed again from the second bite. Putting your mouth on something to digest is very intimate in so many ways.

While victory parades and marching bands might only scratch the lower levels of respect a true burrito connoisseur deserves, Taqueria San Francisco's al Pastor burrito supreme is so far above that basic level of respect where we're going to invent a new level of respect for this burrito. \n\nTHE BURRITO- The second your mouth touches the tortilla, your lips will learn what a real 'first kiss,' feels like. It's not some weak kiss you might get after a middle school dance, this tortilla asks you how you like it and realizing that you have no idea how you like it, will come on all flaky, soft, strong, yet vulnerable- everything you and your burrito both need. \n\nTHE MEATS- oh the meats! The al pastor meat at Taqueria San Francisco is hands down the best al pastor meat in the Mission- THERE- I SAID IT! the secret is out. At this point, you're probably going to assume that with the best al Pastor meat available, the burrito just must skimp on the quantity of meat and put in more rice, but that's where I'll call you a tulip eating, tire licking good for nothing person that's terrible at assumptions. The TRUTH is that these burritos receive a super serving of meats to make sure everyone from little babies to big macho body builders receive all the important protein they need for their growing bodies. \n\nSALSAS- you can never go wrong with a salsa that dances on your tongue while wearing miniature salsa sized shoes to make sure all of the flavors are delivered to your palette. Try all the salsas if you dare. ;)\n\nTHE BURRITO ROLL- Anyone can put items on top of a tortilla and try to roll it- thankfully laws have been passed to prevent those inexperienced people from ever attempting that again. At Taqueria San Francisco, the guys making these burritos must have been born on a separate planet, like Superman and Krypton. This is the only explanation for how they managed to get so many incredible individual aspects of the best burrito ever, into one tortilla. Once you start eating your burrito, you wont need to worry about the last few bites embarrassingly falling apart all over you because this is a Taqueria San Francisco burrito- it'll stay together until It's ALL GONE!!!!\n\nOther burrito places rely on hype and newspapers which can be...influenced to select the best burritos in the city. Taqueria San Francisco doesn't make burritos for Millionaires and Billionaires- they make burritos for everyday good honest people who just want to eat the best goddamn burrito of their life. \n\nIf you've gotten to this part of the review, you're in luck there's one more piece of advice........stop reading reviews and eat that goddamn burrito!!\n\nFinally- the appropriate level of respect for a Taqueria San Francisco al Pastor burrito can only be realized with the awarding of a Taqueria San Francisco al Pastor burrito!", "author": "Mike M."}

Mexi food has been a staple in my diet since I discovered that my young and very picky pallet enjoyed very spicy food and the option of only refried beans from my hometown favorite burrito place, Guerrero's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/guerreros-taqueria-pacifica?q=crystal). \n\nAs I grew and matured, I discovered that tortilla chips with cheese, meat, guac, and pickled jalape\u00f1os was also delicious. Then I started to crave sour cream. Then I wanted Pico de Gallo. Then carne asada. You get the idea. Who knows when these changes occur. Likely a combination of wanting to taste certain flavors and also mooching off all my friend's food and then wanting what they got.\n\nTaqueria San Francisco was recommended to me by several people but I could never find it. In my greener days I didn't realize how many awesome restaurants existed on the Potrero-heading direction of 24th St (St. Francis, Sushi Bistro, etc). So one fine SF afternoon I was picking up my newly repaired bike from Valencia Cyclery and giving it a test drive around the Mission all while cruising for some new-to-me Mexican food. \n\nEureka! There was SF Taq! So I parked my bike in front, wandered in, and ordered up a Super Carne Asada Burrito and chips and salsa and guac and ate it in the shop, which was a good choice given my tummy rumblings. Everything is prepared in front of you and with the perfect amounts of each ingredient in the burrito, also very reasonably priced and NO UP CHARGES FOR BEANS *cough La Taqueria cough*!\n\nI've been back a couple times since, getting the Super Nachos which are just okay, nothing special and they use the nacho sauce from a can (why you do dis?). \n\nMoral of this story is, just stick to the burrito.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-11", "description": "One word: Guacamole.\n\nThis avocado-based salsa just doesn't get much recognition these days. Well Taqueria San Francisco seems to have perfected the recipe. \n\nOne way to describe it is that the avocados must be harvested from the high altitudes of the Sierra Madre mountains by one-armed monks, blessed by the ancient shamans and fed to the Aztec goddess Xilonen who then regurgitates it and sends loads of it to TSF through some divine channel. It's THAT good.\n\nThat probably explains why they give you so little of it in a tiny container when you order a burrito and chips. They are imparting heaven's secret to the world one tiny container at a time. Ask for an extra serving but expect to pay 25 cents for it. I don't mind. I would pay top dollar for jars of that divine sauce.\n\nAs for the burrito, it's all about ratio. The meat flavor has plenty to do with it, but the ratio is also an important factor in judging a good burrito. In that regard, TSF has once again exceeded expectations. Many taquerias will either fill your burrito with too much rice, or too much meat or too much in between. TSF has figured out the perfect balance. And it's not as hefty as, say, El Farolito's burrito (which is a great burrito) but it will still fill you up. It's actually just right. My Asian tummy can only take so much rice and beans.\n\nThe staff is always good to me.  I'm always greeted with smiles when I come to pick up my to-go order. It doesn't get very packed too so you get your order pretty quickly. \n\nThe guacamole really put this place on the map for me but everything else about TSF is a step above the other neighboring taquerias IMHO. Living in the mission has somewhat turned me into a taqueria snob so trust me, I know what I'm talking about. :P\n\n4.6 stars", "author": "Angelo B."}

Sure, there are a handful of go-to places in my own neighborhood, but I'm starting to tire of them. Also, I have to wonder, is there a better burrito out there? First up Taqueria San Francisco.\n\nOverall, this place is legit. Their burrito is very solid. I was particularly impressed with the construction of the burrito and perfectly toasted tortilla. I had a super carne asada burrito. Great meat, very satisfying. Definitely big and filling, and at $8 its a good value, inline with other burritos out there. \n\nSo, the down sides are this: no black beans (my preference) and they put avocado instead of guacamole. This later part is a real shame a I ordered some guac and chips on the side and their house guac is REALLY good. Spicy in a good way. Other missing items are no free chips and salsa bar, which is a shame. \n\nThis place is in the deep mission, but it's definitely worth the trek. Solid all around.", "author": "Jeff C."}

I'm sorry to say, but this establishment is still a diamond in the rough.\n\nComing in at 2PM for their daily special, a super burrito with a free aqua fresca, I ordered their carne asada and an horchata. Super carne asada burritos have become the gold standard for judging Mission burritos as of late so i hoped it would be a good choice. I almost immediately regret that decision when I saw a pre-made, packaged tortilla fly from the bag to the grill. This was starting off poorly. It got a bit worse when I handled the burrito and it felt half grilled and half hardened, like it was in that bag for a bit too long and was only redeemed by the lackluster grilling. Luckily for me, this experience took a quick turnaround at the first bite. Everything in there tasted fresh; there were slices of avocado, finely minced onions, bits of tomato and jalapeno, and juicy bites of carne asada. Even better, everything was consistent. Every bite was the same as the last. Well, this was interesting. On the one hand, everything felt so wrong with the tortilla, but everything was so right with the rest of the burrito. The tipping point really came when I rewrapped my burrito half way through the meal to make up for the numerous empty folds and flops of tortilla. In my mind, a burrito should not have wasted space. It's really a dealbreaker when I get a mouthful of nothing but tortilla. So after rewrapping and ripping off excess tortilla, I was left with a regular sized burrito and enough leftovers to make a taco or two. Yikes.\n\nAs much as I loved everything in Taqueria SF's burrito, the tortilla issues and overall quality of the burrito turned me off too much. Maybe they'll solve this problem one day and, on that day, you'll be sure that I'll be first in line to try them again.", "author": "Frank Y."}

The super burrito was smaller than other taquerias, but very tasty, with the meat grilled perfectly. But that lone-Super-burrito did not satisfy Matt, so Matt ordered a SECOND Super-burrito, which was the Broiled Chicken with everything. The Chicken was very good as well, but the second super-burrito seems bigger than the first one. Both of the burritos were small , but very tasty. Matt ate both burritos with just a can of Diet-Coke.\n\nWhile in between customers, the cook made fresh Salsa and Guacamole in front of Matt. But the terrified patrons' attention was at Matt devouring 2 tasty Super-Burritos. Matt yelled, \"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? YOU'VE NEVER SEEN AN ASIAN-MAN EATING 2 SUPER-BURRITOS?\"", "author": "Matt G."}

I'm disappointed to report that this was a long ride to another world for a less than mediocre taco experience.  I tried both the carnitas and pollo tacos.  The carnitas was quite fatty and greezy and the pollo, although white meat, was tasteless.  This joint is really just another ordinary neighborhood taco shop.\r\n\r\nAs far as trying a burrito v. tacos? If a place calls itself a *taqueria*, its tacos had better damn well be at least as good - if not better - than its burritos, right? I mean, otherwise, they would call it a burriteria.  Simply, the meat was just greasy and fatty.  The same greasy-fatty meat would have been stuffed into a burrito.  I was totally unimpressed with the whole experience.", "author": "Rick H."}

She warned me it was freakishly large and overflowing with \"extras\" not normally found in a quesadilla. So obviously, I was sold.\n\nI ordered the pollo asado super quesadilla suisa. It was roughly the size of my head. And with one bite, cheese, sour cream and guacamole oozed everywhere. In fact, I ended up using my chips to scoop up my spillover quesadilla fillings, which was kinda like eating nachos - bonus! \n\nI preferred turning my chips into makeshift nachos instead of dipping into the pico de gallo they had sitting in little jars on each table. I couldn't bare to dip my chips into it because much like Ben Stiller in \"Along Came Polly\", I imagined the scores of people who must have double-dipped in there. I prefer salsa bars, thanks. They're slightly more hygenic. But it's a nice thought.\n\nAn added bonus is that it's down the street from Humphrey's, so if this place fails to induce a food coma (which is unlikely), their ice cream should do the trick.\n\nAmbiance? Well, I guess if rickety benches and the sound of Univision blaring on a 15-inch tube TV counts as ambiance, this place has got it. But let's face it, who goes to taquerias for ambiance? I go to get my fullz on. Period. And this place delivered. I haven't tried their super burrito yet, but judging by the quesadilla I'm sure it would be equally filing and ridiculously full of gooey goodness.\n\nTraditionalists might say that adding so many fillings to a quesadilla makes it no longer a quesadilla, but more like a flat burrito, so it really shouldn't be called a quesadilla. To them I say....\"What, I can't understand you?! My mouth is full of this delicious quesadilla! Nom, nom, nom...\"", "author": "Mariela D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-12", "description": "I'll tell you something you already freakin know.  In the Mission you can't find a bad burrito so don't let some bad Yelp reviews make you think twice about this taqueria. \n\nBest burrito?  That debate is so ridiculous. Especially some people's comments that one has to headdesk at given all the useless info contained within them.  \n\nLet's get down to it.  If you go to a taqueria for it's decor and ambiance you probably will quiver with fright at Taqueria SF. But then again, people who rate taquerias on their ambiance probably don't care that much about what their burrito tastes like.  Amirite? :p\n\nOrder a super ____.  Whatever pleases you, order the super.  Don't skimp.  Order it SUPER.  Take home what you don't eat. I like pollo asado myself.\n\nTheir burritos surpass many others in a few details.  For starters, they give you alot more meat.  Second, no annoyingly dry all-rice bites because the balance and distribution of rice to beans to meat is unusually pleasing.  By which I mean, it makes the burrito that good.  And third, it's likely the juiciest burrito you can find that doesn't drip all over your forearms.  There will be queso in every bite and you will enjoy many bites IF you did not fill up on the huge basket of tortilla chips they give you (at no extra charge).  \n\nThis is not the spiciest burrito in the Mission by a long-shot but guess what?  They have spicy salsa in jars on every single table.  They also have pico de gallo on every table and if like me, you really dig spicy salsa, onions, cilantro and tomatoes beyond what is included in the typical burrito log, then I recommend you use both liberally.  It's like this:  Bite.  Spoon salsa and pico.  Repeat.  \n\nIs it really necessary to make the trip all the way to York just to get a great burrito in the Mission?  Hell no.  But, if you love burritos and haven't tried this taqueria yet I think you should make the journey.  Nevermind \"best burrito\" claims or what burritoeater.com thinks, just go cause it's good.\n\nOh, and one more thing.  Don't take it to go, eat it there.  I was the only person sitting in the place, so what?  Enjoy the free condiments and enjoy your burrito piping hot before the cheese and other ingredients congeal and you feel a need to blubber about how it didn't measure up to the reviews.", "author": "Ben S."}

I prefer the grilled anyway, but this preparation had some kind of slightly sweet sauce with it, so I only had about two bites of the whole thing. The al pastor today was ok but nothing special - maybe a bit dried out. The carnitas also weren't as good - the flavor was all right, but no nice crispy bits on the edges. We also decided to try a pork tamale - fine, but the masa was a bit creamy for my taste, and not heftily corny enough (yeah I know I have to work on my masa vocab). The pork didn't really stand out, and altogether it was a bit greasy.

Bluntly put, the place itself is nothing special.  Simulated wood tables dot the dining area, while a drop ceiling and fluorescent lights illuminate from overhead.  At least one set of lights is always sporadically fluttering, it's bulbs or ballasts going into a slow dance of death.  Excited, animated Spanish voices radiate from the TV when a Mexican soccer game is being televised... Mariachi tunes blare from the jukebox if one isn't.\n\nLocated about two blocks from Potrero Ave., this place is far enough from the nauseatingly trendy Valencia St. corridor to be devoid of any influence from the wrong things, but deep enough inside the Mission to be influenced by the right things.\n\nI always get a Chicken burrito here, and the Chicken is ALMOST on par with that of the uber-spendy La Taqueria (see my other review on this) on Mission Street.  Chips are free, and each table has a full jar of salsa on it.  I regularly kill an entire jar... and nobody ever says anything when I snarf a fresh one off an adjoining table.  Seating and lines are NEVER a problem, even at high noon on the weekdays.  Bicycle riders rejoice....I've brought my steed inside many times, and the staff has never so much as batted an eye.\n\nCheck it out, but don't bring too many friends...especially if they aren't from the Mission.  This place is one of my last remaining neighborhood secrets....and I'd be devastated if the Valencia street mod-squad sniffed it out and made it hip....\n\nUpdate: 4-02-06 burritoeater.com got written up in the Chron, ( http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/04/02/CMGU9GJ0Q51.DTL&hw=burrito&sn=001&sc=1000 ) And so did this place along with it.

They sometimes chop the meat a little too finely, but that's about the worst I can say about it.  It's got flavor.\n\n3) Pico - they only have one kind in a jar on each table, but it's a one-hit wonder.  I rarely eat more than a few of the factory-made chips at any taqueria, but the pico here is simple, well balanced, and vinegary enough to cut through some grease without being overpowering.\n\n4) The burrito mojado is a sight to behold.  Nice presentation, good ingredient mix, lots of meat, and overflowing with cheese, guac, and sauce (no sour cream for me).  The only thing that would make it better would be extra cheese placed inside the burrito (in addition to the abundant cheese on it) to hold the ingredients together a little more.\n\nNo misses.

I try not to eat burritos more than once a week, but this place is one of the best. The carne asada isn't as fresh as Papalote or cubed as Cancun on 18th, but it is super flavorful and juicy without being watery. I like how they grill the tortillas before they are served. The super nachos and quesadillas are also pretty awesome. Another plus is the location that is off the crowded part of Mission so it's easy to go there for a quick dinner when parking is tough where the other taquerias are.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-04", "description": "Wow. Quite frankly I'm amazed at how divisive Taqueria San Francisco is amongst the yelping community. Initially I didn't even think to review this place because I figured the praise would be nearly uniform, but I suppose there is a debate to weigh in on, so here's my two cents.\n\nIt appears that negative reviewers of Taqueria San Francisco can be grouped in to two categories: those who are mistakenly eating non-burrito items off the menu, and those who are totally clueless as to what one should expect from a burrito. Those in the former group can easily rectify the situation, and if they are not a subset of the latter group, problem solved. Those in the latter group who are putting inferior meats like chicken in the burrito or complaining that the salsa is too hot, I can try and present my argument for why the Taqueria San Francisco burrito is the only burrito that I will probably ever give a five star rating on this site.\n\nThe essence of TSF's burritos are the construction, which several people before my have eluded to. The tortilla is grilled, which is obviously superior to steaming, but the manner in which TSF grills creates a flakiness that I have never found in other burritos. It's almost as if you're eating a quesadilla tortilla, and really the only reason to eat a quesadilla and not a burrito is for that tortilla texture. The wrapping technique is always tight, and the contents are uniformly distributed within. \n\nYes, there is a lot of avocado, and the avocado are wedges, and not guacamole, which I think is a sign of the freshness of the ingredients. I've never thought that to be a negative thing, but it's a fair complaint. The meat selection is typical for a good burrito place; aside from the normal asada-pastor-carnitas trifecta, they serve meats that you don't get at the place that serves the \"best nachos in the city\" (lengua, cabeza, chorizo). It's tender, juicy and each one has a unique taste. Beans and rice are as good as beans and rice get. They are there to play a minor flavor role, and mostly are a way to get more meat juice into your mouth and not at the bottom of your tortilla. The salsa is contentious, I will admit. It isn't very spicy, but it is unique in that there is an interesting pickled jalapeno flavor in the pico. For those who want more heat, adding the whole jalapenos that are also available on the table should allow one to adjust the spiciness to their desired level, which I think is preferable to making every burrito really spicy.\n\nSo that's my take on the restaurant that has given me the most complete and satisfying burrito experience time and again. I hope this helps clarify some of the debate, and if not, I know of a great Mexican place with a seven layer burrito to die for that we can all go to and discuss this further.", "author": "Brian H."}

But I then thought that I may have stumbled upon a holy taco paradise. So I thought.\n\nI entered. I looked to the left--standard taqueria billboard-menu . Two classes of tacos--regular and super. I asked what was in the \"taco regular\" (which was $2.25). \"Onion, cilantro, hot sauce.\" \"Salsa Roja?\" I ask. \"Yes.\" \"Two please.\"\n\nFirstly, there was a puddle of aqua roja in between the tacos. It should not be this consistency. Now, I would be more forgiving if somehow this liquid was tasty, but it really just wasn't.\n\nEven more of a crime than the salsa roja was the carne asada. Simply bland. The carne asada is the integral part of a taco, and they flavored it with a dash too much of nothing. Even salt and lime couldn't save this taco because salt and lime is used to enhance the flavor of the carne asada, but there was no flavor to enhance.\n\nThe only decent thing about the tacos were the corn tortillas. It's not even that they were extraordinarily flavorful; they were just well-warmed and had a good consistency. Though this may seem trivial, barely warm, soggy tortillas kind of blow. It's always nice when the tortillas are done right.\n\nI give this a 2-star solely based on the tacos. It's NO BUENO--I would not come here again for the tacos.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not girlie about my food, especially not my burritos, but I feel the narrow shape is superior. For one thing, you don't have to stress out about all your fillings spilling out of the tortilla, which makes for a more enjoyable eating experience. There is still a very substantial amount of food, too. I finished mine, but that was based strictly on what my taste buds were telling me to do, it had nothing to do with how much food was in my stomach.", "author": "Megan M."}

Not steam it, but they literally put the beans and rice on your burrito while its still on the grill. Then they slice fresh avacado ontop. mmm. Their salsas are all very good especially the verde that they give you with chips.", "author": "jeremy r."}
