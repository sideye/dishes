Across the board. And all 6 of us agreed. Even worse, it was tremendously overpriced. An average of $85/couple for an ok amount of food and a couple of drinks? Awful. Diabla Shrimp was meh. Carne Asada tacos were barely ok -- the same as the typical $2 tacos you get at any decent taqueria -- literally a bunch of carne asada, onions and cilantro on a street taco size tortilla. Chips were blah. Salsa was awful (never had a more flavorless salsa). Guac was good though.

It had plenty of natural light and a great view of the street to people watch during my meal.\n\nI ordered an Agave Margarita after Luis explained they didn't have a full liquor license, which meant it was made with wine.

It had real chunks of avocado and was seasoned well. It was pretty filling.\n\nPer Luis' recommendation, I got the house specialty- a 19oz Coleman Ranch Pork Chop. It was ON FLEEK! First of all, it was big enough to feed two people. It was cooked to perfection- just a little charred flavor on the outside, then super juicy and tender from the orange chile marinade. \nIt was served over a bed of crunchy, spicy cucumber salad- which made it \"lighter\". Traditionally, I would have liked buttery, garlic mashed potatoes as my side... but then I wouldn't have been able to stand up or walk out of that place on my own. \n\nI didn't finish my pork chop or my guac so I asked Luis for a box to go. \nThen he not only boxed up my food in individual packages and an easy to carry bag, but he also thought to include a fresh bag of chips.

First and foremost, I have to mention the amazingly fresh and crispy, homemade tortilla chips. I think they were the highlight of the visit for me. I feel like a lot of places skimp out on their chips, but it is very clear that these are house made (I could see them being fried in the kitchen) and to top things off, the service was amazing and they were generous with refilling our bowl of chips. The salsa served with the chips also seemed fresh and was slightly spicy. \n\nIt seemed as though tacos were one of the most popular items to order, so my friend and I decided to share pescado and carne asada tacos. This worked out perfectly because the tacos come in orders of two. The fish was slightly underwhelming to me because I felt as though the batter had gotten soggy, but I could still tell the ingredients were high quality. The carne asada meat was tender and well seasoned. I would recommend the place to friends in the area! And probably order some guac to pair with their great chips next time.", "author": "Tara N."}

The buttery oil from the sauteed shrimp made a nice glaze on the grilled tortilla and and the crema on top was the literal icing on the cake.

Everyone in my group liked this dish the best.  5/5\n\nFish tacos:  A typical fish taco - I had a bite of my friend's dish and it was good, just not super inspired and a smaller serving/less flavorful than the taco sonora - so I would go with that if you are torn. 3.5/5\n\nGuacamole:  Decent guacamole, a medium sized portion for the price and the avocado quality was excellent.  The complimentary chips and salsa were really good too - I just adore a good fresh salsa!  5/5\n\nBloody Mary:  Made with mezcal which is my FAVORITE.

My first visit was for dinner and second for brunch. \n\nEverything at Don Pistos is fresh. . . nothing ever frozen. There are two kitchens, one small one upstairs that is clearly visible from the bar and dining room. And one hidden downstairs where the prep work is done. Salsas and all sauces are made from scratch. Tortillas made in house. And the best local meat and fish. . . YOU CAN TASTE IT.\n\nDINNER:\n\nGuacamole ($8) As fresh as it gets\n\nTortilla Soup for 2 ($14) This was a meal in itself, delicious, hearty and had HUGE pieces of avocado. Will definitely revisit. \n\nCarne Asada Tacos ($12) The angus steak and arbol salsa was perfectly balanced and huge portion of meat. \n\nPescado Tacos ($13) Market fish baja style with cabbage and white sauce (too much sour cream). \n\nEnchiladas ($16 + $4 for meat) Beans, wild mushrooms, cheese, and added chicken SO MUCH FOOD. . . why did I order this?!?!  The complimentary chips and salsa, soup and tacos are more than enough. \n\nBRUNCH:\n\nFresh Young Coconut ($6) Our bartender struggled to poke a hole into the coconut for the straw. . . it was quite entertaining and delicious. WAAAAAY better than the prepackaged carton coconut water. \n\nPineapple Agua Fresca ($4) Fancy juice, not too sweet or acidic at all, I noticed the staff using this juice for the mimosas. \n\nHuevos Rancheros ($13) Crispy tortillas, beans, eggs (I requested poached instead of sunny side up), pico de gallo, pappas (potatoes), queso fresco.  The dish was perfect when I slathered the dish with the green table salsa. . . spicy and acidic. I ordered this because I saw it plated and it was beautiful . . + potatoes! \n\nMy mom ordered Camarones Tacos ($13) Two sauteed shrimp tacos with garlic, red onion, and avocado salsa. . . I was so satisfied with my dish, I didnt even bother trying hers (and she didnt offer). \n\nWe decided to pass on the $21 BOTTOMLESS BRUNCH BEVERAGE option. Heres how it works. . .\n\n* You are required to order food with this option\n* You can mix and match between sangria, margaritas, and mimosas.\n* Your table and bottomless drinks are yours for 90 minutes (and service ends at 3 pm)\n\nIn my opinion, sitting at the bar would be your best bet for getting the best service. . . At brunch we sat at the bar and our bartender was super attentive. During my last visit when I sat in the regular dining room, I was flagging down the staff for waters, chips, etc. . . Don't be in a rush and come here. \n\nTwo dudes sat next to us at the bar. . . one ordered the breakfast burrito (HUGE) and the other the open faced taco sonora with steak (TONS OF MEAT). . . they inhaled their food. Both dishes looked amazing. Im definitely going back for brunch. \n\nThe restaurant is unmarked, is two levels and is on the smaller side.

It has delicious food and a fun atmosphere. They offer bottomless mimosas/margaritas/sangria for $21 which is a steal! Your time limit is 1.5 hours for bottomless, and they end at 3, so I would definitely recommend getting started on that right away. The margaritas tend to be inconsistent in strength- I have had some that tasted like water and some that tasted like a glass of tequila! I would definitely recommend the mimosas and sangria over the margaritas. \n\nThe food is also good. My personal favorite is the ceviche- it's super flavorful and also very fresh. The huevos rancheros are pretty standard, but a good option. The guacamole is good to snack on. If you have dietary restrictions, I have found them to be very accommodating and they can make something that you can have. One downside is that the food often takes a while to come out- once I got my food but my friend who had ordered at the same time had to wait another 30 minutes! Also, it can be a long long wait on weekend mornings. \n\nThe atmosphere at Don Pisto's is definitely the best part. They blast music and it feels lively.

The food was awesome.

We got there and waited by the door, and at probably 2:20 they finally seated us at a table upstairs. They took drink orders, and then told us they were going to move us all downstairs for some reason, even though we were already seated at a fine table, and that they couldn't bring us chips or take our food orders until we were downstairs. So at 2:35, we still dont have drinks chips or orders in, and we all move downstairs, and they finally take our orders. 15 minutes later the waiter comes back and apologizes and tells us that he made a mistake and didn't get the orders in to the kitchen fast enough, so all the people who ordered off the brunch menu will have to re-order, and that he'll be right back with menus. 15 minutes later, half of our food comes out, but the waiter had disappeared and never brought menus for the other half of our table to re-order. So we start to eat, and try to flag someone down. Finally, we flag someone down and ask for menus so that the rest of our party can order. So at this point we've been here an hour and a half, half of us are done eating and the other half haven't even ordered. We also couldn't get anyone to bring us chips or more drinks, even though we were paying for bottomless. Eventually the manager came out and apologized and brought us free guacamole and two pitchers of mimosas for bottomless, which was very nice of him. The food was good. The margaritas were fine, but quite weak. \n\nBy the end everyone was just frustrated and wanted to leave.

I wanted an outstanding and unique meal that I couldn't get in Austin, but I also wanted to go to a place laid-back enough not to side-eye the casual attire I was wearing that day.\n\nDon Pisto's delivered on all counts. When we walked in on a Sunday afternoon, we were seated immediately and had prompt and pleasant service. To start, we had the ceviche and guacamole, which was very satisfying-- they make the heartier, fresh tortilla chips that I love. We split lobster dinner. The lobster, slow cooked in pork-fat, served with warm tortillas, rice, beans, mole sauce and a garlic-butter-cilantro concoction, was an outstanding way to cap off our day trip. The vibe there was really cool too, industrial without trying too hard, playing some 00's hip hop in the background.", "author": "Lin Z."}

Especially was interested in trying their pork chop which had many great comments and delicious photos.\n\nCool space and when we arrived, was kind of strange that the host was wearing t shirt, shorts and soccer sandals. But hey this is SF right? Host was very friendly though and offered us free drinks for waiting, which was great.\n\nUnfortunately everything went downhill from there very fast. We immediately ordered the pork chops and a couple of sides. At first our female server seemed a little harried and rushed, but was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt considering how busy the restaurant was.\n\nWe placed our order for two pork chops which she detailed about how they are prepped, marinated all day, delicious, etc plus a couple of sides. A few minutes she comes back to tell us they are out of the pork chop.  She recommends a couple of other dishes and we settle on their rib eye. Strike one.\n\nTheir rib eye comes with creamed corn as a side and one of the original sides we ordered was corn on the cob (the pork chops come with a cucumber salad). Not wanting a meal with nothing with corn as both sides we cancel the cob order and she seems visibly irritated and makes a rude comment \"well they are prepared differently\" which was totally unnecessary. \n\nWhy make any comment when you already messed up with the pork chop order, lady? Do I really want a dinner with two sides of corn and nothing else? Strike two.\n\nThen they bring out one rib eye and forget to bring 2nd rib eye for my dining companion. Very awkward to eat steak in front of my starving guest. We finally receive 2nd steak but by then I'm finished. Strike three.\n\nAt this point our horrible server finally starts to realize she has seriously messed up our evening and offers to remove an appetizer from the bill. Too little, too late.\n\nThis woman needs to get a better attitude, more training and learn how to be more gracious if they want return business, because I won't be back. You don't snap at customers about sending stuff back due to your own incompetence. Ever.\n\nAs for the food, it was just OK Mexican and definitely overhyped. Chips were decent but their salsa verde had a strong off-taste of unripe and undercooked chile. \n\nThe rib eye was cooked well but average steak quality, mussels were tiny and shriveled with three sad pieces of disgusting soggy bread, and the creamed corn was very Campbell's-like. \n\nHard pass.", "author": "D C."}

The menu looked appetizing and there seemed to be a strong buzz. After making a reservation early in the week as well as calling to confirm two hours prior, I showed up to hear \"We don't have a reservation under that name\". I pointed out my name on the reservation sheet with no contact information and a line through it. After indignantly explaining to the slouched, jean wearing host that I had called two hours ago, I asked to speak to the manager. Amazingly, I learned this kid was the manager!\n\nAfter being told there was an extended wait, I asked them to call me when a table was ready and left. By the time they called, the brunch menu was nearly closed. I asked if he was willing to extend the menu on account of the wait, to which he said no.\n\nMy final verdict: If the rest of San Francisco somehow ceases to exist, Don Pistos may be a suitable alternative to starvation.

Ok so we did just that, went around the corner and grabbed some beers at a bar.  I got a call in about 35 minutes and I was promptly seated.\n\nThe food was hit and miss as far as the price point goes..\n\nOk, so I don't know how the Bay Area is when it comes to Mexican food but i'm from SoCal.. I live like 15 minutes away from LA and 15 minutes away from Santa Ana. and as a Mexican food lover I have had some of the best when it comes to the cuisine. So let me give you my 2 cents on the food..\n\nTuna Tacos.. $14.00 - Literally 2 small tacos, a little bit smaller than the ones you get at Del Taco or Taco Bell. $7.00 a piece I just couldn't and wouldn't ever order this again. Yeah it tasted fresh, it was filled with sashimi tuna, but really? There wasn't enough flavor here, it tasted like regular tuna sashimi you would get at a poke bowl place inside a taco.. No way ever I would ever pay $14.00 for two taco's especially these ones.\n\n19oz Pork Chop - $35-$40? - Amazing. The flavors were complex, the chop was juicy, the meat was tender.. so good. It comes on a bed of cabbage that's also seasoned. Squeeze the lime all over the chop and lettuce and man you got something special here. This was a standout dish for me.\n\nOverall this place is super pricey and I cannot see myself being a regular here, a once in a blue moon type of place? Sure. Its overpriced mexican cuisine and the tacos aren't that special to be $7.00 each. NO TACO IS, EVER. Yelpers disappointed me and let me down on this one.", "author": "Andrew J."}

Their catering manager Michelle is a dream to work with and she goes above and beyond to make sure her customers are satisfied and well prepared with their orders.\n\nI'm looking forward to checking out Don Pistos for brunch or dinner in the future - but until then - I'll be chowing down on take-our orders of their unbelievable guacamole. \n\nLike last night.

We were greeted by the Host/Waitress Bailey and she immediately got us a beautiful table for two right by the Window. (It was such a beautiful warm night so this was an extra treat!). We asked Bailey what her favorite items on the menu  and what she would recommend.  She informed us the Mexican Sashimi(Salmon) was outstanding, we ordered it and it was Melt in your mouth incredible.  We also ordered the Spicy Tuna Tacos (incredible), Calamari (yummy) & the Carnitas.  The food was exceptional.  I want to mention the Teamwork at this restaurant, if any restaurant wants to watch this teamwork they would be so surprised on how each person within the restaurant continuously helps one another, every guest in the restaurant was never left without water, food,chips, cleaning of the plates etc. etc. I highly recommend Don Pistos!

The food was good. The salsa was unique and fresh. The chips were o.k. we were given mostly slivers. The enchiladas were gorgeous but the flavor didn't own up to their presentation. But they were good. The prices are a bit high. And apparently when you order the tuna tacos you never know what spice level you will get. My friend who comes here a lot always asks about the spice level and the response is it varies. Aka hotter then hell or relatively spicey. There should be no excuse, I get that peppers vary on their heat but it is the chef's duty to try the pepper and determine how much to add. The service was acceptional, even gave us a complimentary shot. But the dish I ordered simply did not blow me away. I would come back to delve more into the menu.

This guy was rude from the get go. He acted like seating my party without everyone being there was a huge favor to us, but it turned out to be helpful for him since he had another party right behind us (he told us that). It's like, bro, you're not pulling any strings you're just doing your job. \n\nOur waitress was great, very sweet and accommodating. We actually offered to move since some of our friends bailed last minute, but she said we were fine where we were, so we enjoyed our food and drinks, wished our girl a happy birthday, everyone was in high spirits. \n\nCut to the end of the meal where our BFF Herman comes back CONTINUOUSLY telling us we had to move. We were a little taken aback since it had only been an hour m, but we asked to just pay our bill and finish our drinks. Herman got super sassy, told us he was the manager and, to my surprise, became even more rude. He came back a third time to really lay down the law and tell us we had to leave to make room for another party. \n\nSorry DP, I will not be back anytime soon. People like your host should not be in a customer facing position. He was rude and pissy anytime he came around and I really don't appreciate that.", "author": "Crystal C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-29", "description": "First time visiting Don Pisto's.\n\n4 stars overall for the food. It was tasty and well-prepared, albeit a bit over-priced. The complimentary house-made chips and salsa are delicious (5/5). I ordered the shrimp tacos which were excellent but $13 for two small tacos is a bit too much even if they were quite filling (though I do have a dainty appetite). My partner ordered a chicken dish that was delicious but also over-priced at $18. \n\nFWIW, I always favor quality over quantity, but I felt that the value wasn't quite there at Don Pisto's. The portion sizes were fine. I didn't want more food for the price but rather the same amounts of food at slightly lower price points.  \n\n1 star because it was overwhelmingly noisy. I had to all but shout to be heard by my partner. Not a good place for an intimate conversation, that's for sure. \n\n3.5 stars for the service. It was friendly enough but it took a long time before we were able to place our orders even though we were ready to order as soon as we sat down and it also took a long time before we received them (our table could've been turned over much more quickly if our orders were taken when we were ready). \n\nAlso, my order was served long after my partner's (about 10 minutes later based on photographic date-stamping). In fairness, there was a very large group present when we were there (~15 people or so) and perhaps they were slammed. Since this was our first visit, I don't know if the delays were typical or not.\n\n5 stars because our waitress proactively offered me a margarita \"on her\" as an apology for the delay in bringing out my order even though I hadn't complained about it. That was a very nice gesture on her part and much appreciated :D. \n\n2.5 stars for the drinks. I had a sangria and a \"margarita\" (in quotation marks because it was made with agave wine and not tequila and so not what I'd call a true margarita). They were just a-okay. The sangria at Limon Rotisserie is my sangria benchmark; it's $2 less and much tastier (more nuanced in terms of spicing and -- I'll admit it -- a boozier bang for the buck). \n\nWould we go back to Don Pisto's again? Honestly, probably not. I live in the Mission, my partner lives in North Beach and we each spend quite a bit of time in our respective 'hoods. We were in North Beach today and I wanted to try something new as we'd been to our favorite spot in that area (Fior d'Italia) just last Friday and I'd had Don Pisto's bookmarked for awhile. \n\nI'm a taco fan so Don Pisto's was a decent choice for me, but my partner is a burrito nut so the Mission is naturally going to have a lot more places that will please both of us when one of us is craving Mexican food. \n\nNo regrets -- the food really was very good and I'm glad I finally tried Don Pisto's. I would recommend it if you happen to be in that part of the city and are willing to pay just a bit too much for for very tasty food, but I wouldn't go out of the way to go there. I liked the food a lot but I can't honestly say that it's craveable enough to be worthy of a repeat visit.", "author": "Maya B."}

You do have to have at least 6 guests or more though. My girls and I sadly didn't reach the minimum number to make resis, so we did end up having to wait about an hour for a table on a Sunday around noon. The plus side of it was we were able to get a head start on the $19 bottomless drinks while waiting at the bar. Their bottomless allows you to switch between their housemade sangria, margaritas and/or aqua fresco mimosas...talk about Sunday funday!\n\nThe bar area was small and seats were already taken, so two of my friends and I stood at the end with our drinks. I felt like we were in the way with the servers and other workers, but they were polite about getting by and didn't seem bothered. The bartender kept an eye on our drinks and would refill our glasses even before we were half empty lol it was truly bottomless and I probably lost count of how many I had, so it is really worth the $19.\n\nOnce we were finally seated, we decided to order a bunch of plates to share among the 4 of us. We went with the chorizo and baked eggs, diabla wings, fish, shrimp and carne asada tacos (two per order). Our server also gave us a side of chips and a green salsa that was pretty spicy, but too good to not eat! The serving portions were on the smaller side, so even if we got to try each of the dishes we didn't necessarily get stuffed but full enough to hold our bottomless drinks down lol. \n\nThe food was good, but not the best. You can obviously find better tacos in SF at even cheaper prices. The diabla wings could've been passed on cus they were super tiny. The spiciness sure was there but each wing barely had meat on it and was probably the size of my pinky.\n\nThe service was pretty fast and attentive esp since it started to slow down after the brunch rush was over. I applaud them for never letting our mimosas and sangrias get empty haha. The food isn't really memorable, but that $19 bottomless deal can't be beat!", "author": "Georgina G."}

The patty was deliciously marinated and the guacamole was solid but there didn't seem to be any real effort trying to marry those flavors together.

Don't expect to ser a sign with the name of the restaurant like the other 1,000 restaurants in the area. It's weird, but they only have the building number, so use a GPS to find this place. Although the wait was a bit longer than I thought, the generally positive reviews granted a visit. I was initially told that a spot by the bar will be opened in 15 minutes, however I was given a table after a 35-minute wait.\n\nI ordered a Corona, which was served very cold in a super large bottle. They serve complementary chips and salsa, however I also ordered the steak tacos (2 per order) and two sides; Mexican rice and beans. \n\nThe Good:\nThe beer was simply great, extremely cold. A bit pricey at $11 per bottle, but it was cold and fresh, so I didn't mind the price. Phenomenal chips and salsa. The green salsa is beyond good, it is heaven on earth. The steak tacos were tasty, juicy and the meet fresh and very tender. The tacos ($12) were really small, however they were super tasty. About my two sides; the beans were the best I have ever tried!! The Mexican rice; oh Lord, read the bad section for details. The service was outstanding. The hostess was friendly to all waiting customers and those calling on the phone. She had a smile and seemed genuine happy. My waitress (Gabriela) was also happy, very informative, stopping by regularly without becoming a distraction. I sensed just a bit of a rush to order initially, but the restaurant is really busy. The minute a table is empty, other staff members jump on it to get it ready for the next customer. The cohesiveness among staff members was noticeable; teamwork was second to none with one goal in mind, provide an outstanding customer service experience. Nice job Gabriela and teammates!!\n\nThe Bad:\nThe Mexican rice was the most horrible thing I have ever tried in my life. Kind of odd, but my two sides were served right after the beer & before the tacos. I immediately noticed an odd odor coming from the Mexican rice, but decided to give it a shot. I honestly thought it was rotten...it was something beyond description. Just to make sure I wasn't confused, I scooped another sample from the bottom of the cup, again, horrible smell and even worse taste. So I put it aside and asked my waitress Gabriela. She smiled at first and explained they use Yukatan rice, which is prepare by backing it first...definitely not your normal or standard Mexican \"yellow\" rice. Why they choose to serve a rice that requires an acquired taste, is beyond me. Bottom line; don't order it if you don't want to ruin your dinning experience. I had to drink lots of corona to get that awful taste out of my mouth. Ok enough of that; the last area for improvement will be the music, great music though, but too loud. The place is extremely loud, in fact, you'll have a very hard time having a normal conversation without having to yell at each other.\n\nOverall:\nGreat dining experience, could have been outstanding had it not been for the Mexican (Yukatan) rice they serve.

There are certainly some good things about this restaurant. First, the quality of the food is fine, for instance, the calamari appetizer and the meat are all well cooked.

Second, the decoration is nice, the minimalistic design helps you to focus on the meal and whoever you are eating with. There is no unnecessary distraction at all. However, if you come in the evening, beware that the light is very dim, which can make it a little hard to read the menu... but don't be hesitated to ask for help as the servers are all highly attentive and are always ready to describe the menu. \n\nHaving said that, I just feel the menu is quite overpriced. I mean, by downtown SF standard, maybe it is norm, but consider the quality and portion of the food, it just makes you feel that you are not spending your money wisely.

This was a really disappointing experience, which is a real shame because the food was actually pretty good.\n\nSo they don't take reservations, that's fine, I can deal with that. We checked in with our party of five and were quoted 45 minutes - 1 hour so we decided to go to a bar and grab a drink, since the host will call you when your table is ready.\n\nAt the 30 minute mark, we had just ordered our drinks and the phone rang to let us know our table was almost ready. So we chugged our drinks as rushed back only to be told our table had been given to somebody else, yep, she actually told us we took too long and gave our table away. We were also told that a table was paying and we would be seated there shortly. At this point we were at the 45 minute mark, so we had gone from having a table early, to no table at all to now at the quote we were given.\n\n20 minutes later, we were still standing outside in the cold, waiting for our table. The host, kindly offered to buy a round of drinks for our party which was great. We were able to step inside and take a seat at the bar... Until, a server asked my friends if we were waiting for a table and if we were could we move so people could sit at the bar to eat. WHAT?! So we are now over our quote, invited into the place to enjoy a drink at the bar but we then get told to move!?!!\n\nThen, the part that really got my blood boiling. We were (sitting until we got told to move) standing by the bar, having finished our drinks, yep getting close to and hour and a half of waiting, we were shown to our table, a table for four, with a place setting on the corner to accommodate the fifth person. While right next to us and table for six sits empty. I asked the host, if we could sit there instead. Her response was, \"No...\" followed by something along the lines of: we can use that for a two-top and a three-top, so it makes sense for us to seat you here and use that for two parties. HANG ON A MINUTE, there are two empty tables of four there, one you are trying to squeeze five people at and the one next to it that sat empty the ENTIRE TIME we ate dinner.\n\nSo, when I questioned the reason she gave for not seating us at the bigger table, she kept saying no and that it was the table for four or nothing. Whatever, at this point we probably should have just left but I shut up and sat down. The server went over the menu, oysters of the day, ceviche of the day, family/tapas style dining, we ordered our next drinks, and appetizers. After our food comes to the table and we are eating. The host offers us the chance to move to a different table, a table for 8/10 (not sure) that had a party seated at the other end. By this point over 50% of the restaurants tables were empty, what it is with this place and seating small groups at \"communal\" tables when there are other tables open? We had food and were in the middle of eating so chose to stay where we were.\n\nI have 10 years of hospitality experience and so many things were terrible here. Being made to move from the bar, being sat at a table too small for our party, being table our table had been given away, being told they need a bigger table to seat two parties when we have waiting 90 minutes, and no sign of a manager to stop by and apologize. There was some blonde haired lady walking around and socializing with various employees but not once did you talk to our party.\n\nI will NEVER come back here, which is a shame because I liked the ambience and the food was pretty good but this service was painful!", "author": "Sarah S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-25", "description": "We found this restaurant on Yelp and went there for my nephew's birthday. We tried to make reservations but they do not take reservations for parties that are less than six people. It was ok as it all worked out.\n\nI thought the waitstaff was really friendly and helpful. They recommended we order family style as their kitchen is small which means all of the dishes will not come out together. They show up as they are ready. That didn't bother us though.\n\nThe inside is nice; brick walls with pictures hanging and dimly illuminated by small picture lights. The whole restaurant is dimly lit but I liked it. The tables are wood and rustic looking. They have two and four tops and communal tables. However, the tables are tiny! They serve the food on these huge plates but the tables are so small you are constantly having to jostle your plates and drinks around to fit everything. Also, the music was really way too loud. Yes, they play good tunes but it is so loud it makes having a nice conversation difficult.\n\nMy least favorite thing about this place was the choices for alcoholic beverages. They have a very tiny wine and beer list, one type of shot, and margaritas, and sangrias. I didn't like the Sangria. It was tart, bland, and hardly had any fruit in it. The shot was meh. I wouldn't try either again.\n\nThe food was pretty yummy but it isn't authentic Mexican food. I grew up with a Hispanic step family who cooked authentic, made from scratch Mexican food and this stuff is nowhere near what I grew up on. Despite that it is pretty tasty. I thought everything was very fresh. The salsa is really yummy and has a good kick to it. I liked the chips but they were a bit overly hard. \n\nWe had the calamari appetizer and that was excellent. The calamari was grilled on metal skewers and served on top of some sort of coleslaw like dish and a really light sauce. The sauce was very flavorful and had a good kick to it. The calamari was super fresh and tender and had that perfect grilled flavor.\n\nMy nephew had the cheese enchiladas which I didn't try but he said he really liked them. \n\nMy mom had the pork chop which is $37.00. However, the serving is HUGE! Typically I hate pork chops but this one was really tasty, tender, and moist. This is worth trying.\n\nMy sister and I tried each other's meals. She had the (2) tacos al Pastor for $12.00. These were by far my favorite. The corn tortillas were soft and tasty and they had them overly stuff with meat and salsa.The pork was perfectly tender and flavorful and the salsa was amazing. I did the special of the pork ribs for $19.00. I couldn't hear what they called it or what they called the sauce. Although the ribs were fall off the bone tender the sauce was really bland. They served it with the yummy corn tortillas but that was it. Just slap some saucy meat on a tortilla and your done. It would have been better if they gave you cilantro or pico or something. It was a huge serving though. \n\nThe other thing I didn't like is that EVERY dish had a hint of sweetness to it. I like sweet and savory from time to time but I feel like it is being over done these days. What is wrong with just savory or just sweet??\n\nAll in all, I did enjoy the experience. I would go back for some tacos or calamari or I would go back to try the lobster (that sounds really yummy). Plus the people\nwere friendly. And I didn't feel like it drew in an overly pretentious crowd.", "author": "Nat S."}

Our small table was in the dark, the light in the ceiling for the table was burned out and no one replaced it, so ate with flashlights. Service was pleasant and attentive though very informal.  The sound system had \"music\" going but it was a heavily based piece on so loud you could not carry on a conversation, and it was the same beat the whole time we were there. It was not Mexican music, kind of a heavy metal and loud, loud, loud.  Maybe the chefs liked it because it overwhelmed everything. The kitchen is small, small, no more than 10 by 14 feet, and they do a great job considering no plant to work with.  Otherwise the meal was fine. The ingredients were outstanding, but for instance my two tomales, were laid flat on a plate with nothing accompanying, and they were pretty one dimensional, with the obligatory sour cream design on top from a squeeze bottle.

We had the Tuna and Shrimp tacos. For $14.00 you get tuna tacos that are maybe 2 inches long, and when filled maybe 1/2 inch wide. They serve 2 of these little things. They were good, just very small. The shrimp tacos also were at $14.00 served on 2 taco truck sized tortillas. These are like appetizers. \n\nThe waitress mentioned these are all to share. Oh ok. It's certainly not an entree. \nWe ordered rice and beans to share. It was $6.00. The Yucatan rice was dry and flavorless. Nothing to write home about. The beans are similar to the whole beans I make.  If you are starving this is not the place. If you want a good honest meal for your money...also not the place.

I've only ordered to-go so I don't know how the dining experience is, but the fish tacos are clearly a fan favorite. I'll have to try some other items soon. My only gripe and the reason this isn't a 5 star review is that of course the pricing is too expensive. $13 for 2 street-taco-sized tacos??? So basically you're easily dropping over $50 for 2 people here. SF really ain't all THAT fancy, and neither is this place to have such expensive tacos. Don Pisto himself be lucky they are so good.  I also got the guacamole, which apparently only comes in one size (medium-ish tub-sized) so at least that was worth the $8 lol. The guac is flavorful and has some spiciness so be prepared to make your tastebuds jump for joy. Dare I say this guac is ALMOST as good as Chipotle's guacamole(I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS, CHIPOTLE STILL HAS THE BEST GUACAMOLE. FIGHT ME ON IT, I DARE YOU. lol.)??? The chips aren't all that great so I paired the guac with some doritos instead LOL. \n\nThe Yelp menu pricing and the actual restaurant website pricing doesn't seem to match BTW so only order from their website if you're checking out the menu.

Don Pisto's not only satisfied my cravings, they exceeded many expectations. Such a wonderful--cool vibe--restaurant that offers a mouth watering menu! I had the carne asada tacos and my girlfriend had the fresh ceviche. The tacos were very tasty; right amount of lime and meat that was grilled to perfection.

In a city with thousands of Mexican grandmothers, it is a CRIME to have taco soup like this. Tuna tacos had lots of guac (good) but were bland (bad).\n\nI just couldn't relax in this place. Food coming out constantly as it was ready- ok. But then like give me a minute to eat before you ask if you can clear my plate... please!

The ambiance there was a feel of being part of the \"in crowd\" as the place with popping with people and great music.  It felt as if you were at a club but instead of dancing you were sitting down and eating.\n\nThe menu was really short, half small plates (tapas) and the other half entrees.  All in all, about 10 dishes.  The menu is a bit tricky as some of the entrees are really small and some of the tapas are quite large.  So, portion sizes doesn't match what you generally think.  It would be helpful to have pictures.\n\nWe ordered the salmon tacos, pork chops, yellowtail, and others.  These three dishes were phenomenal and I would highly recommend getting them.  The other dishes we got were only okay.  The pork was tender and cooked to perfection.  The yellowtail was fresh!\n\nVerdict:\nI would go back again!

Yeah, I think the food here is good.  I've also had better Mexican food in at least 10 places in San Diego.  Bottom line is this: if you're coming to Don Pisto's, you're paying for the atmosphere as much as you are for the food.\n\nI can't complain about the food itself because it's pretty fresh with good ingredients.  The chips are pretty good, although a tad bit salty in my opinion.  I appreciate that when you order chips, it's an endless supply.  Kinda wish guacamole was like that too though, not $6 a pop.  Diablo prawns were as expected - really spicy.  Not that I can't handle it.  Al pastor tacos and pescado tacos (choice fish of day was rock cod) were well-made and had high quality ingredients.  I just can't justify paying $9 and $10 for two tacos when I've had better and bigger tacos for half that price.\n\nAgain, when you come here, you're paying for the atmosphere.  It's a fairly intimate atmosphere with plenty of ambiance.  It does get fairly loud in here because the brick walls just allow sound to bounce off the walls and reflect back into the room.  If you're young and got money to burn, this is your spot!\n\nFor me?  A bit overrated and definitely overpriced.", "author": "Alexander Y."}

We also opted for:\n\nThe fish tacos which consisted of market fresh fish, baja style, white sauce, onion, and cilantro (really good); ceviche with avocado, orange, pico de gallo, chile (really really good), charcoal grilled calamari with a citrus dressing and radish salad (no words, this was my favorite) and rice and beans.  Their sangria is also light and refreshing.  \n\nAside from the food, I was impressed with the austere terse simplicity of the wooden tables, concrete floors, brick walls and small kitchen-- reminiscent of a neighborhood tapas bar somewhere in Europe (maybe Seville or Barcelona). The crowd varies, the staff and service are exceptional and honest-- giving you a familiar comfort that you only feel when you're with friends or family.

A story of mouth-watering Mexican food...\n\nIt all started in the shadow of a great Coit Tower where some dudes (maybe dudettes too?) decided to get together and make some of the cleanest and most flavorful dishes to ever pass through my experienced lips. They have a lot of seafood at DP's, I especially enjoy the spicy tuna tacos and ceviche. They make some legit house salsa to go with your perfectly crisp chips as well. Heat builds off the spicier dishes and salsa quickly so get yourself a margarita, STAT!\n\nEven going to the bathroom is fun at Mr. Pisto's. It's like a spelunking trip past the kitchen, down the dark stairs, by the party room (that never has a party in it...) and around the corner to guess which door is a bathroom. Fret not, it's not that scary and the bathrooms are usually pretty clean.\n\nOnce you've filled your belly to capacity and beyond you'll find a nice surprise.

We got there right as the doors opened and there were a handful of groups waiting to be seated.  Again, we are seated downstairs and away from the service. We are 7 people with 1 bowl of tortilla chips to share among us. When we asked for a second bowl we were given a refill on our first bowl. The food also came out at all different times and the waitress brought two mimosas down for us and left 5 of us empty handed.  Our friend who ordered the beer (the easiest to grab) got his drink last and after two reminders. \n\nThe food is really good though, the tacos, the egg breakfasts all good with fresh ingredients.

While I understand restaurants can refuse service and should at times this was unwarranted. \n\nUpon asking the manager and waitress why, we were told it was because we didn't want to listen to the specials so she thought we were being rude.

I would say the food is a solid 4.5-5 stars, but I'm taking away a star for ambiance. This restaurant is wayyyy too loud.

What do I do in this situation? I go straight to my trusted Yelp app and look at what is near by.\n\nAfter looking through several pages I came across Don Pisto's. Yelper's seemed to love it here so I knew I had to check it out.\n\nThe restaurant does not have signage. There is a menu in the window. There are two ways to find it. The first way is pay attention to the numbers of the buildings lol. The second way is to look for a large crowd and music playing. I found it using the latter method cause I'm cool like that on rare occasions lol.\n\nIt was a total zoo which is usually a great sign. After a few minutes I was able to make it to the host stand. I was quoted a wait time of an hour but told that it would probably be sooner. I put my name down on the list and went to get a drink at another bar with my father.\n\nWe returned about an hour later and were told that it was going to be a slightly longer wait. To make a long story short chaos ensued at the host stand. The owner Pete had to come over as the host couldn't handle the crowd lmfao. Pete offered free drinks to everyone that was waiting. Thanks Pete that was awesome of you!!!\n\nWe were seated after about two hours. Normally I'd go somewhere else but we were digging the scene and the food looked amazing. The restaurant is also on the small side.\n\nChips and green salsa were immediately brought to the table. Oh my god the salsa was one of the best that I've ever had. It was spicy which I loved. The chips were crisp and salted just right.\n\nMy father ordered the pork chop. I went with al pastor tacos and carne asada tacos as well.\n\nThe server checked back in to make sure we were good with drinks while waiting for the food.\n\nWhen I saw the pork chop placed down on the table I had severe ordering remorse. This happens so rarely to me that I should've bought a powerball ticket in hindsight!!!! Thankfully I was offered a piece of the pork chop to try. Wow it was fucking amazing. My father went quite nuts over it.\n\nI enjoyed the carne asada tacos. They were extremely generous with the meat portion which always sits well with me. The steak was juicy and well seasoned. The tortillas were soft and warm. The al pastor tacos were just OK. The pork was too dry in my opinion and was somewhat bland.\n\nNow fast forward two days later. The President of my company wanted to take company executives, some colleagues and myself out to dinner. His wife was in the mood for Mexican and he heard me talking about Don Pisto's to everyone so he decided to make a reservation here.\n\nWe were seated at the lower level in the restaurant this time which I didn't know existed. We were at a long table with a bench on each side. It ended up becoming an intimate dinner and not in a good way. It was also quite hot down there as well. I was sweating as were others. \n\nI ordered the pork chop this time!!! Sigh unfortunately this time when I get the whole damn thing just for me it was just OK. It was too dry for me personally.\n\nEveryone loved their meal and I looked like a hero to the President, his wife and a few of my colleagues. Thank you Yelpers and Yelp this wouldn't have been possible without you!!!! \n\nI deducted a star due to the pork chop on my second visit as well as for having dinner that was \"Too close for comfort.\"\n\nNext time I'm in San Francisco I'll definitely make it a point to stop by here.", "author": "Will G."}

So, unfortunately, this bad review is primarily directed at the wait staff (although, not the bus boys who were very kind). \n\nFirst off - I arrived at 10:55 AM (5 minutes before they open, although I wasn't aware of this) and walked in to let them know which party I was with. The manager told me they don't open until 11 AM and that I should wait outside. I asked her whether I could wait right inside and she said \"no, we aren't ready for you yet...\" I then proceeded to ask whether she was aware that it was pouring rain out and she simply said \"yes.\" So, great start, waited outside in the rain...\n\nOnce our party was seated, the waitress was rude and impatient with our group (yes, we were a group of 12 but there were many large groups in the restaurant so they should be used to this). She impatiently took our order, rolled her eyes when people weren't ready, and wasn't very helpful with questions about the menu. \n\nOur food orders all arrived at very different times so most of the food was cold by the time we started - also, we found a couple hairs in their tacos (which they said couldn't possible be their fault since they don't have any chefs with long hair; note: they have wait staff with long hair). The food was otherwise delicious though - so props to the chef.\n\nAs for the drinks - apparently the \"90 minute bottomless mimosas\" start at the time of your reservation - so if you order 20 minutes later, make sure you are aware of that. Other thing to note - the margaritas aren't the best and are pretty watered down. Go with the mimosas instead if you are choosing to do bottomless (did not try the sangria).\n\nAs we were a large party, tip was included. If I had had the option, I would have chosen to give them far less for service... Wouldn't come here again - there are WAY better brunch places in town with far friendlier service. Check out Zazie or MyMy next time, long wait times but they both have amazing food and very kind wait staff.", "author": "Saba M."}

An hour and a half wait is nothing compared to the lifetime I've wasted not eating Don Pisto's Chorizo and Baked Eggs though. I'd like to have all the time I've lost eating other crap and give it back to the world in the form of waiting in line for this brunch. That actually seems fair.\n\nThey have also changed the bottomless mimosa game to be a fun, drunken challenge. You've got 90 minutes to significantly alter the rest of your day with the freedom to switch between three different kinds of mimosas. It's like a timed drinking contest interrupted only by slap-ya-mama deliciousness, and everyone wins!", "author": "Alexis H."}

The restaurant is situated on an uphill street in north beach, and can go un-noticed since they do not have a big sign. So you have to be attentive while looking for it, Once you enter, the space is not too big - which doesn't mean it is small or cramped up. On the interiors it is a little dimly lit, with popolar music playing. They have spacious restrooms too. Over the weekend, I'd recommend getting reservations because they do get quite busy. Both the drinks that I tried were great - margharita and michilada. We tried a lot of things on their menu, by favs were the bean enchiladas - soft and delicious loaded with gooey cheese, the vegetarian tacos served with very flavorful rice. They have different varieties of salsa that they serve with chips- all delish. Not to mention the guac was perfect - well, what good is a mexican restaurant that has okayish guac, right? I would love to go back here :D", "author": "Reema B."}

Our group of 14 (all of whom definitely past the twentysomething stage) was bribed with free shots of tequila so we could mosey on outside of the restaurant after we had finished our meal and our pitchers of margaritas.  There was quite a crowd outside waiting for tables. I  didn't realize just how popular this place is!\n\nIf you're gonna eat here and want to be able to talk to your friends next to you or across from you, either bring a bullhorn or have a fully charged phone so you can communicate with them via text. It is way too too loud inside (thanks to the music and din of the crowd) for any kind of meaningful conversation. I can see my friends' mouths move as they shout something at me, but understanding what they're saying is another matter!  My throat got really hoarse after a couple hours of shouting across the table. \n\nThe tacos were great. I tried the beef, shrimp and al pastor tacos and they were all tasty.  The shrimp dish was also good. I didn't get to try the meatballs dish, but my friend said it was just okay. I would definitely stick with tacos. The chips and green salsa are both really good. The salsa had a little heat to it. The guacamole could use more lime and cilantro though! I ate lots of chips at the beginning as we were waiting for the rest of our party that I got full real fast. Hard to resist those chips! \n\nThe margarita was good. One side of our table was enjoying it a little too much. Haha But that's cool! The birthday boy must enjoy his and his wife's night out without the kids! \n\nService was good.  Our server made sure everyone had a drink and everyone had food!  The free shots of tequila was a brilliant tactic to get us out of there after paying for our bill.

I'm sorry but we didn't just wait 1.5 hours to \"eat a f*cking omelette\" as my friend put it. \n\n(2) Out of Salsa? What the heezy? Have you ever heard of McDonald's running out of ketchup?\n\n(3) Out of Lobster, Ceviche, and Carne Asada (limited dinner menu with just 3 entrees). They must have ran out of salt too because everything we ate was ridiculously bland. \n\n(4) Flavorless Guacamole ($6) that makes Chipotle's seem authentic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE8DTKsTFi1Vzm_zzd0Q?select=rz8P6fmmReZyJkObNhdLag#lmRX6fjCWarKG3FSkNiGhQ\n\n(5) Bland and watery Chicken Tortilla Soup ($12). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE8DTKsTFi1Vzm_zzd0Q?select=rz8P6fmmReZyJkObNhdLag#9p5VdUBHtzZ5fwnkUJPBCQ\n\n(6) 7x7's Hamburguesa ($11) that was well-done and tasted like a meatloaf.

After waiting for 1.5 hours, we wanted to enjoy our dinner. Instead, we were rushed in and out the door in 31 minutes (yes, I timed it). As we sat down, our waiter hurriedly said, \"you guys are my last table....are you ready to order?\" Slow your roll, Mr. Testaverde, we didn't even get a chance to breathe much less look at the menu. \n\n$38 later, I wished we went to The Mission for AUTHENTIC Mexican food instead. \n\nW-H-A-C-K-E-D.\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*To my dear Yelpy friends who gave Don Pisto's 4-5 Stars, please don't hate me. \n*I'm a fan of their sister restaurant, Chubby Noodle (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/chubby-noodle-san-francisco-2#hrid:xM00NZ1lOYfL-Zqpu0093w).\n*Reservations only taken for party of 6 or more.\n*Expect 1-1.5 hour wait on weekends.\n*Small bar area with 5 seats.

After a long while and countless times of trying to hit up DP's, my boyfriend, Abby. A, and MIL (mother in law) enjoyed a nice dinner out. We came right when they opened on a weekday, and good thing because they filled up fairly quickly after opening. \n\nThe vibe of the restaurant is pretty cool - I could tell they were trying to reel in folks in their 20's-30's from the music to the overall vibe. \nWe went ahead and ordered the guacamole and chips ($7) - this was okay. It was definitely fresh, but way too simple. The chips were fresh and crunchy though-  I just think I make a better guacamole ;) (thanks Food Network!). \n\nWe also ordered the shrimp and scallop ceviche ($13) - I would pass on this next time, unless its made with a different protein, because the scallop tasted a little too gamey and there wasn't enough citrus to cook the scallops through, it's also a little sweet because of the mandarin.\n\nFor the main courses we ordered two orders of Camarones [shrimp tacos ($11)]  - these were delicious! The shrimp were plump and juicy, and the bell peppers and onions were sauteed really well to pair the shrimp. The sauce was also delicious and made for a good extra to sop up with your extra tortilla. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the hamburgesa ($13) - this was pretty good. It looked really simple, literally just a bun, with a pretty thick patty and guacamole on top - but it was seasoned REALLY well and very soft and tender. \n\nOnce we scarfed down the tacos and burgers, we felt we needed an extra something, so we went ahead and ordered the enchiladas ($15) - although meatless, the sauce, beans and cheese definitely made up for it.\n\nThe winner of the night in my opinion, other than a close call with the enchiladas was the Coleman ranch pork chops, just as my coworker had mentioned. It was the most tender, juicy, delicious, flavorful pork chop that had ever graced my taste buds. The cucumber salad was PERFECT to go with it - very refreshing and had a nice crunch!\n\nTo wash it all down, we ordered a pitcher of sangria ($32). My only gripe about the sangria was that there was only limes inside, I would've like to see oranges and apples or more fruit than just lime!\n\nTips: \n-If you have a party of 6 or more, I would definitely call and make a reservation. Smaller parties unfortunately have to do walk-ins.\n-Take an UBER there, because parking is a pain in the A$$\n-Get the pork chop, you'll thank me later.", "author": "Kathleene E."}

Fresh ingredients and just the right portion for 2 to share. \n\nI had the chorizo & mussels, once again,  extremely good! They give you a good amount of mussels and chorizo bits. Sauce was really good with just the perfect kick of spicy. Not sure if I can call this an entree as I don't really see anyone getting full off of only this plate. \n\nFriend had the pork chops which was good, super moist, and huge portion. \n\nI tried the sangria and it was meh, I've had better. \n\nSuper friendly employees and I love the music but I think they can turn it down a notch as its so hard to have a conversation here. \n\nWith just a few changes, this place can easily turn a 5 star from me!", "author": "Molly M."}

That being said, the food is delicious.\n\nWe walked in on a gorgeous Sunday morning with no reservations and we were sat right away (party of 6). Considering it was prime brunch hour we expected some kind of wait, but there was none. The free salsa verde that comes with the table chips is absolutely delicious; it really is. I wish it was spicier, but that's nothing some Tapatio can't fix. We also ordered some guac. At $8 it seemed pretty pricey, but it was pretty sizable and came in a stone mortar; we were happy. Tip: Mix some of the salsa into the guac to give it a more citrus-y flavor.\n\nI had the breakfast burrito. In keeping with the disclaimer that began this review, do not expect a soft flour tortilla enveloping a massive load of everything a burrito should be and then wrapped in foil. This was a more elegant take on a breakfast burrito. Despite it not seeming huge, it was still quite filling. The burrito itself was pressed on the griddle giving the tortilla a toasted texture. Think of the grilled burritos from Taco Bell (but way better, of course) and you got the idea. We had a side of the potatoes and I have to say they are doing the burrito a great disservice my not putting the potatoes inside. The potatoes have a great garlic flavor to them and would have gone perfectly inside the burrito. \n\nThe service was good; no complaints there. The one thing stood out was that they do not serve coffee. Instead we were told to go next door to a local coffee shop and bring it back. A little strange for a place that serves breakfast, but it wasn't a huge deal.\n\nI wouldn't travel far to come here, but if it's easily accessible I would give it a shot.", "author": "Luciano C."}

I was told they don't take reservations so we arrived early and had no problem getting a table. The service was prompt and friendly, and we were given a lot of suggestions since it was my first time.\n\nI really love ceviche so that was one of my choices. It was extremely fresh with good chunks of seafood (delicious scallop!) and avocado. The street tacos were huge and very flavourful. For these type of street tacos, I prefer Por Que No in Portland, but these still hit the spot for me.  As a main, we shared the chorizo and mussels. The portion was generous and there was a good heat in the flavour of the dish, but I wasn't a fan of the little bits of chorizo sprinkled throughout the dish. \n\nI saved room for dessert so I was pretty disappointed and surprised to learn they don't serve any!  Oh well, North Beach has plentiful places for dessert so we went elsewhere. All in all, great experience and worth a repeat if only for the ceviche alone.", "author": "Colene C."}

Postmates, not so much, but that's another topic! \n\nOnto the food... prices listed are to-go prices as listed on Don Pisto's receipt: \n\nGuacamole and chips - $8 ($7 on Don website) - AWESOME. Big serving, about 1.5 cups, with 2 paper bags of chips. Guac had plenty of fresh flavor, topped with crisp chopped white onions, accented with lime juice and cilantro. Chips were fresh, crunchy and salty deliciousness. \n\nHam & Poblano Scramble - $11 ($10 on Don website) - Duroc ham, poblano, cheddar cheese, green onion. Monster serving and very good! Seriously looked like 6 eggs scrambled up with solid chunks of ham. Comes with side of really tasty potatoes too, or maybe those came with the Huevos Rancheros, but I think the scramble. \n\nHuevos Rancheros - $11 ($9 on Don website) - crispy tortillas, refritos, eggs sunny side up and pico de gallo. More normal serving size, still healthy portion, perfect eggs, super-fresh everything. Pico de gallo fantastic!\n\nPinto Beans - $3 (same on Don website) - Again, big 1.5 cup serving, packing good heat, pulled out a couple long red peppers from mix. Very good value!\n\nConclusion: Excellent food, big portions, GREAT flavor. Get it! :)\n\nFor my opinion on Postmates, see my other post here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/postmates-san-francisco?hrid=y10cfVaKCQxWrz65T4urcw", "author": "Sarah J."}

Not knowing where to go, we decided to wander around downtown and found ourselves in North Beach.  My buddy had heard of a swanky spot for some hip Mexican food, which seemed out of place for North Beach, but after checking it out online and seeing it's amazing reviews, absolutely had to check it out.  It was really tricky to find since there's no signs and located on an otherwise quiet street but we eventually found it after walking by several times.\n\nThey started us off with house chips and salsa, which had really fresh and had a nice bite to it.  We ordered some oysters on the half shell, which were fresh and delicious, and bargain at $2 each.  I decided to get their special burger, which is marinated in bacon and onions, and cooked to a beautiful medium rare and topped with guacamole.  WOW!  It may look like a simple burger but it was full of flavor.  My girlfriend's ordered the tortilla soup, which was exactly what one would want on a cold night and cleared the sinuses right up.  Everything was executed flawlessly and was awesome.\n\nService is flawless, perhaps one of the best experiences I've had in SF.  The restaurant itself has a speakeasyish kind of vibe and it's really hard to find if you don't know it's there and had exposed brick walls inside.

I decided to get the Shrimp Taco Sonora (handmade flour tortilla, queso oaxaca, pica de gallo), w/ no beans&crema but a side of over easy egg for me to put on top of the sonora. I ate it like a pizza cutting the tortilla in small triangles. I would get a slice of the soft crunchy tortilla & then scoop up some shrimp,queso,pico & yolk which was delicious! The yolk from the egg added that nice touch, which I'm really happy to have gotten based on my bf's suggestion. \n\nOverall, pretty good first experience, but the food didn't amaze me enough to give them a 4star.

They were super crowded, but one of the girls in our group worked her charm and managed to get our party of 5 on the list. We waited at a cafe down the street and the nice gentleman called us within 15 minutes when our table was ready. The first thing I saw on the menu was Puerto Nuevo lobster! NO! Really? Because I plan on going to Puerto Nuevo to try the lobster, but I need to hire security to combat the drug cartels. Or maybe I'll just wing it one day when I'm feeling dangerous! I really would do anything for a great meal! Anyway, when I saw the Puerto Nuevo lobster on the menu, I was like diga me! Is this for real!? And it was :) This other random girl vouched for its authenticity! \n\nSo we ordered the lobster, the pork chop, the tortilla soup, and the micheladas. \n\nLobster: So delicious! Luckily, I've been to my fair share of lobster fests so I know what to do with a pair of those lobster cracker things [insert actual title of tool here]. I dipped the lobster in the luscious garlic and butter sauce and just let it sit there for a little bit. I then made my \"Leena-Style Tacos\" ohhh...the tacos! The corn tortillas were warm, fresh, and I think they were made directly from my Mexican grandmother (if I were to have a Mexican grandmother). They were lightly oiled and cooked just enough to melt in your mouth. I added the beans and rice, the spicy salsa, and of course, the lobster. Damn...that was a great taco. \n\nTortilla Soup: Because of this soup, my people will now have to travel all the way to Don Pisto's to get me this tortilla soup when I'm sick. If they try to hand me Campbell's or Progresso, that's just not gonna fly...the tortilla soup here is SO DELICIOUS! The flavors mesh so well together. \n\nPork chop: I was expecting it to be a little more tender, but the flavoring was delicious. It was a bit tough to cut but once you got that savory little piece of meat on a fork, MmMmM! Delicious! \n\naaaaand the micheladas were awesome and spicy!

I've been wanting to try it since, but the wife is vegetarian and there doesn't seem to be anything for her on their limited menu and other places nearby like Tony's and Park Tavern usually win out in any decisions on where to dine in North Beach.\nI tried DP last night with a friend. We both love going to the Mission and getting the real deal in taquerias so we were both stoked to try this place.\nWe got seated at the tiny bar quickly which was a plus, otherwise we'd be looking at a 45 min. wait. The bar seats only 3 or 4 people. I ordered a margarita and wasn't impressed. After reading some reviews today I can see they may not have a liquor license to use tequila so they use wine. It tasted pretty odd to me and did pass as a margarita, but it was pretty dull and now I know why. Downgrade one star.\nWe had carne asada and carnitas tacos, tamales and an enchilada. The food was good to excellent, I won't lie, but it wasn't mind blowing and it seemed to lack a touch of something that you only get in taquerias. \nAs others have also noted, the place is LOUD as hell. Also, prices are pretty through the roof. 2 simple street style tacos with nothing else should not go for $12, but they do here. \nAll in all, I would probably give this place another try if the timing was right (meaning I could actually get a table and there weren't too many people making it so loud) although I won't be rushing back anytime soon.", "author": "Matt H."}

We asked our pleasant waitress what the \"must try\" items on menu were--she recommended the following \n\n- Wild Monterey Calamari - charcoal grilled, orange, lime, radish salad\n- Diablo Prawns - wild mexican prawns, spicy diabla sauce\n- Puerto Nuevo Lobster - whole maine lobster, homemade flour tortillas, rice, beans, arbol salsa, cilantro butter\n- House-made Chorizo Mussels - mexican country sausage, white wine, and cilantro\n- Poc Chuc - grilled pork rib chop, orange chili marinade, spicy cucumber salad\n\nWe ordered the calamari, prawns, and poc chuc, but replaced the lobster and mussels with this item, which would later haunt us:\n\n- Pescado Tacos - market fresh fish, arbol & avocado salsa, cabbage & onion slaw\n\nMy take on the Calamari:\n\nMaybe the best calamari I've ever had. It wasn't really rubbery at all--more meaty. Served on skewers. Wonderful grilled flavor. And the fresh citrus provided a refreshing accompaniment.\n\nMy take on the Diablo Prawns:\n\nBig and fresh. As with the calamari, absolutely no fishy flavor. The diabla sauce was essentially chipotle sauce--strong smoked chili flavor. Not bad at all.\n\nMy take on the Pescado Tacos:\n\nWhat was the \"market fresh fish\"? Who knows--they didn't tell us. It wasn't fishy I guess. The description had me at \"avocado salsa\", but I was distraught that there was barely any avocado flavor at all. The cabbage & onion slaw was boring. And the corn tortilla wasn't hard, and it wasn't soft, which means that...it wasn't good.\n\nMy take on the Poc Chuc:\n\nThis was executed quite marvelously--the meat was extremely juicy, and the orange chili marinade provided a brilliant overtone. The meat surrounding the bone was superiorly marbled. I was indifferent about the cucumber salad.\n\nAll in all:\n\nIt was a lovely meal, not holy enough for 5 stars, but fancy enough to kick it above a standard 4 star.", "author": "Elliott D."}

Before reviewing, I will preface with this:\n\n1) I don't typically like paying more than $10 for Mexican food\n2) I had high expectations for this place because everyone else had hyped it up\n3) I was drunk when I ate here (but I'm awfully truthful when I'm inebriated, so THE FEELINGS I FELT WHILE EATING HERE WERE REAL I PROMISE)\n\nI ate here with 2 guy friends, which ultimately made the whole experience wonderful.  I didn't have to sit around with my girls listening to them figure out how they could split 2 tacos between 5 people because they're sooo full from half the salad they had for lunch.  \n\nAnyway, we ordered the fish tacos and carnitas, both of which were yumz.  (If you're wondering how you can split the 2 tacos per order between 4 people however, the tacos come with two layers of corn tortilla, so... you can just make 2 more tacos with less meat.)\n\nWe also split the wild Monterey calamari, which was my favourite because it was grilled rather than fried.  If you have an issue with weird textures, I wouldn't order this, though.\n\nThe boys' favourite was the poc chuc, which was a huge grilled pork rib.  I don't usually eat pork, but this was worth trying.  The meat was tender, juicy, and probably not all that healthy for you... but I'm not sure what you're doing at a place like this if you're trying to be healthy.\n\nAnyway, we topped it off by splitting a 32oz corona, and it came out to $73 in total for 3 people or $24 a person.  Pretty awesome.\n\nWord on the street is that they also don't like groups bigger than 4.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

The last time we were here, it was crowded, loud, and dimly lit.  Well, that much of it hasn't changed either.  We thankfully didn't wait long for a table, and were quick to pull the trigger on ordering when we sat down.  We opted for the following tacos: Carne Asada, Carnitas, and Al Pastor.  I shamelessly asked for the $6 guacamole, and had a very large glass of sangria to go with the unlimited helping of tortilla chips.\n\nAll in all, the tacos were solid and the guac was fresh.  Needless to say, we made it easy on the dishwasher when we were done.  It's definitely a little pricey considering you only get two tacos per order, but they are most definitely delicious.  I get why people don't like here, but whether you end up at Don Pisto's or the new Tacolicious joint down the street, you'll be paying a pretty penny anyway.

My boyfriend and I came here yesterday for a late brunch on a beautiful day. We got there around 1:20 and put our name on the list after being told there was an hour wait. We walked around the area for about 25 minutes before deciding to check back in. We were seated when we came back. \n\nEnvironment: The restaurant itself is really cute. It's a small, trendy building with a small bar and even smaller kitchen. Regardless, the place was packed. We saw this as a good sign as we sat. Over the course of our visit it seemed like the music and the noise level in general increased rapidly. At one point we literally felt like we had to yell to talk to each other. It was just uncomfortable and irritating at some times.\n\nDrinks: We each ordered the $6 micheladas which we have had at numerous places although have never had one that is served with bud light as the beer. The drinks took a good amount of time to make it to our table...Nevertheless, we drank that one drink and stuck to water afterwards. \n\nFood: We started with the guacamole which was really good and thank god we decided to order a small appetizer to hold us over for the hour that we then had to wait for our 2 breakfast burritos to arrive. We asked our waitress several times how much longer they would take and she just kept apologizing for the wait and saying they were busy. I get that but it's a freaking burrito for crying out loud. So an hour later we got our burritos expecting it to be the best thing we've ever eaten at a brunch. It was good, but nothing special at all. We scarfed them down (because we were starving by this time) and immediately paid and left.\n\nWe spend over $40 on a mediocre meal, the worst (and slowest) service we have ever had at a restaurant, and some weak drinks. Overall an unsatisfactory visit to this hip spot. I can see how it can be fun for a young, inexperienced dining crowd but as an adult with plenty of satisfying and well-trained dining experiences, this place just doesn't cut it.\n\nNeedless to say we won't be back.", "author": "Kim C."}

If you're a single chick reading this, I think it's important to mention that the place was packed with hot dudes. Straight hot dudes. Not sure what was going on (hot guys of America meeting?) but I was pretty into it. I'm sure there were hot girls there too, (hello? We were there) but I don't swing that way so I wasn't paying attention. \n\nThe layout of the place is cool. It's pretty spacious. There's an entire back room where more hot guys could be hiding. \n\nWe were seated quickly and the staff was awesome. We loved our server, Nick. Apart from being very accommodating- we had great chemistry. \n\nI'm assuming Nick probably would have proposed, but I had to keep the flirting light because it was a \"girls night.\" Nick, if you're reading this, keep an eye out for my missed connections post. \n\n\nThe food was to die for. I am normally not a fan of sharing because I have only child syndrome- but I couldn't help trying EVERYTHING on everyone's plate around me. It was all really good. \n\nAt one point I even saw a puppy. Like, during my meal. I just don't know if there could be a more perfect situation. \n\nThe only thing that could possibly be counted as a snafu was when Nick (our waiter) accidentally brought my friend the wrong (but similar to what she had ordered) dish. He let us keep the wrong dish (I ate it, obviously) and brought us the correct dish at no charge. So the snafu actually turned out to be awesome. \n\nIf after reading this entire review you don't feel the need to try Don Pisto's, I will just have to assume that you've been pretending your whole life and you can't really read at all.

She came across as overly confident, a bit aggressive,  (to the point of coming across as a know-it-all rather than a helpful server) and kept calling us all 'hun' (sorry but females should know that no other female appreciates being called hun by women their own age).

When I asked our waitress why, she said because it wasn't in season -- the items I had specifically asked about were the sliders and the corn. How is beef not in season? \n\nThe girls at the table (my sisters and I) also noted that our waitress wore a low cut tank to flash around her cleavage (Sorry but this isn't pleasant for female patrons).\n\nWhen the bill came, I insisted that we not give a good tip as it would be the most appropriate way to let her know that the service was not good, and the entire dining experience very annoying ... but everyone ended up tipping 20% despite my protests.\n\nOverall, it was a HORRIBLE experience and I would never come back.

After looking at the fairly concise menu we went with:\n\n-Grilled Monterey calamari\n-Carne asada tacos\n-House made chorizo and mussels\n-Poc chuc\n\nId say the tacos were somewhat average and for the price many taquerias and trucks will do you morejustice however the other dishes were very well executed. Seafood perfectly cooked and the pork for the Poc Chuc had a great crust and still juicy internally. Te application of citrus and chili was also well done. \n\nThe patrons seemed to be twenty somethings in large groups for this night. Service is solid and obviously the line can produce great food. 4.3 stars", "author": "Kim N."}

I actually wanted the carnitas tacos but I have a dairy allergy and these guys marinate their carnitas in milk--who does that?! It's pork, it doesn't need to get softer!\n\nAnyhow, everyone else ordered at least 2 dishes and 20 minutes later everyone had their food... Except for me. I waited another 10 minutes and asked the waitress about it and she told me they were still working on it and it'd take another 15 minutes. Ummm... I literally ordered 2 beef tacos, how long does it take to make tacos? At this point it was pretty clear that they forgot about my order and tried to cover their asses. \n\nWhen I finally got my tacos, they were so spicy I could only eat one. Mind you, I have a really high tolerance for spicy food, but this was so spicy that it made me choke. I even had my friends try it and they were tearing up and desperately reaching for water. I've had more than a fair share of tacos and NEVER have I encountered something this spicy. If you're going to make something painfully spicy, at least put a note for it in the menu.\n\nNeedless to say my meal was ruined at this point.\n\nThere were also a couple of other issues, including a weird policy about not being able to split the check in 6 (max 5).\n\nOverall this place sucked. Never coming here again--for brunch, lunch, dinner or anything else they might offer. Avoid at all costs.", "author": "Rafaella S."}

That's why when go to Don Pisto's, I always get the hamburguesa. I'm not sure what that word means exactly, but it sounds Mexican, and it is without a doubt a pile of deliciously juicy meat marinated in onions and bacon. \n\nIt's so tasty that my companions should count themselves lucky that I was able to curb my violent urges when they so selfishly and presumptuously assumed we were sharing. I suppose we DID agree to share when we placed our order, but once it was clear how amazing this hamburguesa actually is, I feel as though they should have known better.\n\nHaving eaten quite literally everything on the menu, I can also report that Don Pisto's \nexcellence extends to their service, their al pastor tacos, the chorizo mussels and especially the poc choc. The latter dish is a fantastically flavorful pork chop (orange chili marinade!) that I'm quite certain was named after the sound you make when someone asks you what was so delicious that you so rudely crammed the entire thing into your mouth, and you try and say \"pork chop.\"\n\nDon Pisto's is currently near the top of my favorite SF eateries, and I don't see that changing any time soon.

Don Pisto's fish taco would have been really good if it weren't for the fact that it doesn't have much texture, which is really half the fun of a fish taco. the fish tacos here are BURSTING with ingredients, which unfortunately means that your taco shell absorbs all the liquid and gets too mushy. the fish and veggies in my taco were falling / sliding out each time i took a bite. despite that, the taco did have flavor, so i can't knock it too much. i also liked that Don Pisto's gives you complimentary guac, along with the complimentary salsa + tortilla chips that most places give. and, their homemade hot sauce is pretty great (definitely more of a nose burn spicey). the ambiance is perfect for dinner, a mostly wood interior lit up with yellow lights, so i will be back, despite the fact that the Little Italy neighborhood is a bit removed from the rest of SF.", "author": "Meryam B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-11-19", "description": "Nestled along the quiet corner of Union and Grant, Don Pisto's is the unsung hero of contemporary Mexican cuisine of North Beach. The interior from two dining rooms front and back are fairly small in all its brick lined glory, solidifying a guaranteed intimate experience just perfect for dates and small groups. I've partaken in the Don Pisto's journey before in small doses and encounters, but never to organizing a large dinner for coworkers and friends for what was an incredible experience from start to finish.\n\nI owe it all to their incredible host Christine. She was the glue, kept the gears moving and was so professional and efficient throughout the process. After an initial call to setup, along with a barrage of back and forth emails customizing a menu with our logo and inserting various items with respect to dietary habits; everything was done within an hour. Upon learning that this was no ordinary group dining event (going away party as well), she took it upon herself to also pick up and store a cake that we had waiting in the wings. If that's not top notch service, I don't know what it is. Above all, she made me look damn good to the group and all I did was make a quick phone call.\n\nWhen we had arrived, it was clear which table was ours - we were dead center and 16 seats deep in almost communal fashion. The main dining area was already small to begin with, considerably scaled back with our large group absorbing much of the scene. We weren't the classiest bunch of individuals, just the ones everyone wanted to sit with. And in the corner, smiling from afar, was Christina - plotting every little bit of our meal and getting us everything that we needed without even having to ask. It was a symphony of service and she was the leader of the orchestra.\n\nMeanwhile our table was an endless river of sangria and giggles. The company was good it almost seemed as nothing else mattered. Our meal table was full of hits too numerous to mention, highlights include:\n\n* Delectable shrimp taco, cooked perfectly and wonderfully juicy on a soft corn tortilla.\n* Mexican sashimi, with a twist of lime and cilantro and we're off to the races\n* Oysters, as fresh as they get from the bay.\n* Lobster is succulent and tasty, but very different to share.\n* Al Pastor was as good as advertised. Tender bits of rib chop, with the zest of pineapple.\n\nThe evening was a success. We ordered extra pitchers of sangria as the night went on, and before we knew it, it had been over 3 hours. Throughout the time we never rushed and service was stellar to the very end. Christine thanked us on the way out and even sent a follow up email the next day to offer her token of appreciation. After some cake, more sangria, a group photo, more sangria, and feeling stuffed beyond galore, we still managed to rock the rest of the night.\n\nDon Pisto's gets nothing less than 5 stars for service alone. Throw everything else in the mix (ambiance, food, price,etc.) and you've got yourself a spectacular spot for just about anything.", "author": "Jando S."}

Bottomless with your choice of sangria, mimosas, or margaritas. Amazing! It gets loud downstairs, but if you're upstairs it's not too bad. \n\nNormally, I rave about Don Pistos. This past brunch I went to was a little more frustrating. We sat down to a fixed menu. After asking the waiter why we were only given a fixed menu he told us that they had gotten our reservation mixed up and we weren't the other party so then we could have regular menus. He warned us some food would come out after others so that we were aware before ordering (annoying that it has to happen anyways, but at least he told us). Our french toast came out about 10 minutes after everyone else order.\n\nAfter we finished, he told us we had to go upstairs because they needed that table for their next party. We were under the assumption it was because they needed the table for a larger party and that we had a smaller table upstairs. Not the case. We walk upstairs and turns out they just wanted us to leave so they could use the larger table since we were sat at the wrong table initially. So then we were upstairs with no table with drinks still in our hands (water glasses and all).

It was also more than enough food despite its presence on the small plates part of the menu. To round out our 4 person table, we also ordered a delicious and spicy grilled Wild Monterey Calamari and a couple of fish tacos. Water was plentiful for the spice, while a some Lagunitas IPAs and a couple glasses of Rose kept the meal and the conversation flowing. \n\nThis place is popular and luckily we had the flexibility to wait over an hour for our Table. That was made easier by the professional touch of the greeter and his willingness to call Gayle's cell when our table was ready. The other thing is that this place is loud and hard to carry on a conversation. Perhaps this is the new generational normal, but I would have preferred something a little bit more casually intimate to match the cool rustic dining room that was nicely accented by the brick walls and heavy wooden furniture.  There's also a downstairs that could double as a room for larger groups. \n\nDon Pisto's was a great choice and I thank Gayle's hip young professional Nephew for suggesting it.

Except my friend built up the hype and told me this sucker was 1/2 a pound of meat...which, I don't think it was. But it was a pretty decent burger.  They can split it in half or quarters for sharing. Between our 3 people...it was harder. ha.\n\nBurger - quite delicious. I'd like it a little more medium (or at least have SOME pink). I'd guess its not possible, since they have bacon inside it, and that needs to be well cooked. The burger has a huge layer of guac on it, and it just adds to the fatty drool-worthy ness of the dish.\n\nThe mussels in chorizo broth was so delicious. It comes with some buttered and grilled bread, which they can refill for you. It's so delicious. The shellfish is cooked perfectly, and the sauce is a little spicy, but to a level that just makes you keep going for more. We kept trying to sop up more sauce while also digging around the bottom to find chunks of chorizo. I wish I had a spoon.\n\nThe salmon sashimi....was amazing. Like, amazing. They had the freshest slices of salmon, sitting on a bed of sauce (white wine vinegar and soy sauce), with thin slices of jalapenos, cilantro, and I'm sure something else. It was just...delicious. I'd say its a must-order.\n\nWe also had a pitcher of their margaritas, which was good...but not for that price. There was a little too much ice put in there, and unless you're drinking it all in 10 minutes, it gets diluted pretty quickly.\n\nService was very good - our waitress was great about being attentive without being too pushy. Environment is a little intimate, but it seems good for larger parties as well. The bathroom...is in an awkward location around the corner from the kitchen, down some stairs. But is fine.

Absolutely adore the young, casual hip ambiance here! They had a bouncer outside checking ids and it was really loud inside.

Great flavor and perfectly cooked eggs.\n\nMy friend's Chorizo and Poached Eggs ($10) was pretty good. Great flavor and I'm usually not a fan of chorizo.\n\nMy Mushroom Omlette ($10) was really nothing special.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-10", "description": "Hurried steps. A petite woman rushing through the door in a leopard skin string dress wearing white sunglasses. A man sitting by the bar, nursing an IPA, stood up to greet her. \"I'm so sorry I'm running late.\" She said. He stood up as she took her coat off, and as she hopped onto the barstool. It was a very crowded bar. \n\n\"This was a very popular restaurant with no signage on the door. Like the French Laundry.\" She commented. The restaurant had two parts. One part was the communal table and bar area, the other part was a sit down dining area in a sunken  part of the space.\n\n\"This reminds me of Ratskeller in Munich, by Marienplatz. The restaurant was built directly under the city hall, all sunken in.\" She continued.\n\nDon Pisto was of course not a German nor Italian restaurant, it's Mexican street food located in the heart of North Beach. \"Does it look like where you just returned from?\" She asked. He was in Mexico vacationing with his son. \"No, but it felt like it should have been a very guy oriented restaurant. But there were quite a lot of women here.\" He responded. The decor was very masculine, no doubt, with open exposed bricks and fireplace for cooking. Surrounded by Italian restaurants in the heart of North Beach, this place felt like a welcoming home in Mexico, occupied by working class people, and you had just crashed their Saturday night supper party.\n\n\"The restaurant did not take reservations.\" He said. He'd been here before once.  He struck her as someone who dined out a lot, alone or otherwise. Just then the host interrupted them and informed them that the communal table was ready.  The man asked to see if they could sit next to each other, rather than across from each other. Why wouldn't more restaurants insist on that? How could two people have a conversation over dinner if you were sitting across from each other at a noisy place where the only way to talk was to shout out from the top of your lungs? She thought to herself. The host immediately agreed and two new table settings were made for the two of them.\n\n\"What's good here?\" She asked.  He studied menu and ordered her a glass of Sangria as if he could read her mind. It was very plum red, and very sweet. He took care of her as if he was the protagonist straight out of a Jane Austin novel, very old school. Even though they had only been friends for nearly two decades, even though she never needed anyone to take care of her, even though, she suspected, this was how he was with all of his female friends. The wait staff was very attentive and caught the dynamic very early on, so she directed her questions to this man. \"What would you guys like to eat?\" She asked. He said, \"Well, I suppose we should get the ceviche and the spicy tuna tacos. And pollo and posole.\" He decided for her. The restaurant served street food, therefore portion was well adjusted for that, a perfect way to share a meal with people without getting too stuffed and feeling guilty after.\n\nWhen the posole was served, two bowls appeared with a separate plate for the herbs and spices. It was a stew dish, delightful and hearty, unpretentious and delicious. He used the ladle to scoop soup into her bowl first. She added spice and cilantro. Over that dish she learned that he was still in love with the woman he's been with for nearly three years. \"I am into her. I love her. I like her. She's perfect for me.\" \"No one's ever met 'her\", you know.\" She said. \"They know about her. The general stuff.\" He protested. This man who had never been married, was now in love and had been for sometime. Perhaps there was hope after all. But for whom she was not sure.\n\nTurned out that all four things on the menu were exceptional.  The waitstaff brought the bill to the man. He opened his wallet to pay and she saw an older driver license picture of him. In the picture he had a broad smile, strikingly blond hair sans glasses. He had a carefree look about him, like a child. Not this man who's now sitting next to her, more reserved and a lot more serious.\n\nA meal was ending. Simplistic street food in surprisingly non Hispanic neighborhood but completely out of this world delicious. Full bar menu, filled with Mexican and Californian beer to boot.  It was one of the best meals she's had recently.\n\n\"Friday, I'm on Lufthansa to Frankfurt then Munich.\" She said.\n\"I'm on KLM to Amsterdam.\" He said.\n\"Perhaps we'd meet at the airport then.\" She said absent-mindedly.\n\"That would be neat.\" He replied.\n\nThey got up to leave, a half glass of sweet sangria left sitting unfinished on the table. It was a typical summer evening in San Francisco: fog was setting in, wind had picked up, and young people were out and about. At an atypical Mexican restaurant in North Beach: food, surprisingly authentic; goodbyes, reluctantly said; and a new journey, to be commenced.", "author": "Victoria E."}

My group of 4 basically tried everything on the menu.  To start I am a huge Sangria (touch of ginger) fan and theirs was by far one of the best I have had.  For appetizers we had the mexican corn, guacamole and green salsa as dips (all tasty and guac was chunky with pieces of avocado).  Then the mexican sashimi (salmon) and raw oysters.  For the main courses the al pastor alambre was the table's favorite.  Chicken tostada held its shape as we all had a bite, camarone taco and carnitas taco were both all shrimp or pork no fillers, carnitas was more flavorable. Street stand burger was very good if you are looking for a burger but the mexican fare was better, even the mexican baked potato which was fun and unexpected, Beef tamale was small.  Marinated fruit for dessert (spicy - chili) but oh so good.\nOverall the food presentation was excellent, I held off on the one star as it is pretty noisy (even at our table of 4 - hard to talk) and hear the server.

It's truly outstanding and this would be a five-star review based on the food alone. However, the service and atmosphere were so unfavorable, they far outweigh the quality of the food itself.\n\nThe restaurant's first floor is very appealing. However, we were seated in an expansion space in the basement. It is a dark, cramped, characterless cement box that has none of the character of the space upstairs. And, it is LOUD. SO loud that conversation was limited to the people immediately beside us (we had a party of 7), and even then it was extremely difficult. I cannot overstate how loud it was. The server was literally shouting to convey the specials, etc., and we still had a hard time hearing him. \n\nBeyond the space, the service itself was unacceptable. I'm sure this had everything to do with our server specifically. He lacked basic skills in meeting the needs of our party. Five of us received our food; it took more than 10 minutes for the sixth member of the party to receive his plate, and the seventh member of our party never did receive his meal. We were able to get one order of drinks and had to practically wring a second order out of the server at the very end of the meal. He didn't check in on us to see how things were, to ensure our drinks were full, etc.  Just bad.\n\nDon Pisto's needs to more effectively screen its servers -- and it needs to shut down that basement until they figure out how to mitigate the sound and approximate the environment upstairs.\n\nUntil then, why not serve the food out of a food truck? It's so delicious! We had hoped this would be a regular neighborhood spot for us.", "author": "Marc F."}

I also liked the fact that you can see the (very very very) tiny kitchen and see the chefs working hard. \n\nWe were seated at a small table for two and immediately ordered a pitcher of margaritas. I was super pleased with the price but not so pleased with the quality. I thought I was going to be blown away because I asked for \"salt on my rim and sugar on his\" and was told by our waiter that the bartender wouldn't do a sugar rim because it undermined the integrity of the drink. WHOA, I figured I was about to be served the best margarita of my life. Unfortunately, it was completely non-remarkable. I have had a better drink from Chili's. \n\nThe guacamole was on par with the margs. It was in some serious need of flavor...lime, salt, cilantro...anything??\n\nEntrees were fine.

I've done it, and you've probably have yourself, and sometimes, it ends up in disappointment. However, the Carne Asada tacos at Don Pisto's is well worth it! \n\nA warm tortilla topped with nicely seasoned beef, chili verde salsa, and pico de gio. Simplicity at it's finest (and deliciousness!) Grilled jalapenos do come with the tacos, and more can be requested upon, but one set back is that the peppers have already been de-seeded.. bummer.\n\nLobster M/P ($36 at the time) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE8DTKsTFi1Vzm_zzd0Q?select=nF2xM7qc0C0tOiKLYRdNPQ\nLobster after midnight? That's how I cure my midnight munchies! \n\nA whole 2-pound Maine Lobster (see picture!), bathed and poached in pig lard, with homemade tortillas, beans, rice, arbol salsa, and delicious cilantro butter. My only regret is that I ate dinner already so I couldn't gorge on ALL THIS FOOD! (This serves 2 btw!) The homemade tortillas were amazing; very light and fluffy, you could really taste the time and effort put in them. The Lobster dipped in the arbol salsa and the cilantro butter was the true meaning of calorie careless glutton!\n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa were also bomb! The chili verde salsa was incredibly addicting. Best of all, it's made fresh! That's what I like to see from other restaurants. Keep in mind that it was almost 1AM and the Don still delivered!\n\nWith so much win, do I even need to write about the service? Hell ya! Our server, Daniel, was the man! Hospitality skills off the roof. Our chips and salsa were replenished 3x without having to ask (that's how good the salsa was!), our drinks were never half empty, and was simply just a great friendly host that wasn't trying to rush our meal. Much kudos to him!\n\nIt's tough finding a good eatery pass midnight that doesn't invoke more alcohol consumption (even though the Don Pisto's does is also a small bar), but also serves damn good food. The menu is small but wild with many interesting and mouthwatering Latino fusions, like their signature Guacamole Hamburger, Raw Oysters, or even Mexican Sashimi (you heard right). \n\nThe hype is TRUE, and hands down, my new favorite Mexican joint. They also serve Brunch too!", "author": "Albert L."}

You did us right. \n\nFor a group dining experience in San Francisco, I've had none finer. This is the honest to God fearing truth, my friends. I've dined with many large groups in SF as it turns out, so though I am not an expert in all things Bay Area, I've probably taken out more ravenous people in large quantities than the average Joe. \n\nBut we aren't talking about Joe. We're talking about Don. Stay focused, Colleen!\n\nMy illustrious colleague booked our group of 14 for the large communal table running down the middle and it was comfortable. Elbow room. Not crammed. Perfect. The restaurant is lively and tables turned over quickly, but our wonderful server didn't seem to care that we all wanted to sit and chat for a bit over multiple pitchers of MORE sangria. \n\nOh, the service. Please, let me tell you. By far some of the best I've had this year, maybe covering back to 2011. Sweet, sane, accommodating. Awesome. I wish I remembered her name! She was so great. Petite brunette with glasses. Also the hosts, owners, bussers, food runners...everyone we met was just so kind, really what you want to feel when you're dining and having a good time. I can' say enough things about it, but I think you get my point. \n\nTHE FOOD! Great down home Mexican with a bit of an upscale twist, but no so far so that you feel like \"WTF, I came to eat Mexican!\" This is Mexican. Tons of taco options (I really enjoyed the fish tacos the best), up to a Mexican-inspired burger (which was excellent), seafood, lobster, I saw a pork chop arrive, a burrito bowl option. I mean really...something for everyone, including our two veggie diners who were quite satisfied with the options as well. \n\nSANGRIA. enough said. I liked it. \n\nAnd the icing on the cake? They let my sweller then hell team bring a cake for my last dinner with them. How sweet is this!? How many puns can I cram into this paragraph? Through the grapevine I also heard that not only did they accommodate said cake (they do NOT currently offer dessert), but they arranged to pick up the cake for my co-workers, light the candles, bring it out at exactly the right time, take it back to cut it all up and serve everyone slices. I mean really? This is above and beyond, even for a place that doesn't serve dessert. Magical. It really was so nice. \n\nSo, cheers to Don Pisto's...I'd add you to my team any day sir, any day. Bring me another burger someone! \n\n*def make a reservation, this place was swingin' on a Wednesday night!", "author": "Colleen C."}

Fish was perfectly flaky and not bland at all.\n\nTorta: The bun was crispy enough so that it had a nice crunch, but just soft enough so it doesn't scrape the roof of your mouth. The meat inside wasn't rubbery like it usually is in tortas (not that I'm complaining).

Sadly we were greeted by no no sign on the door and a 2 hour wait and no space to drink at the bar, sigh. We had a flight to catch so the possibility of getting my gals something other than Mission burritos on the way to the airport was looking pretty dismal. \n\nI went and explained my predicament to our hostess and ten minutes later we were summoned to our table. It was perfect. We headed to the basement/banquet style room that had more than enough seating. Yay!\n\nWe were greeted by our darling server Kate and amazing tortilla chips and salsa that tasted just like my Mom's. They were even served in the wooden bowls, just like at Mom's! Then we heard \"bottomless margaritas and sangrias\" and we were all in.\n\nWe ordered an assortment of tacos: carne asada, fish of the day, carnitas, and al pastor. The highlight was definitely the carne asada, it was a little dry but somehow managed to make me order a second round. I liked that the tacos were served street style: 2 small tortillas, onions, cilantro, pickled jalapenos and carrots, radishes, and limes. \n\nThe bottomless pitchers were flowing. At one point Pete the owner of the joint, came and professed his love to the ladies at the table and proceeded to give the men shoulder rubs. You get the picture, it was a great meal!\n\nI'm not gonna lie to you folks, some places on mission have better tacos but this place is all about the entire package, the vibe. Good service, great ambiance, fabulous music, stiff booze, and yummy food. \n\nSide Bar-I love the name, anyone who has been to Mexico should get a giggle out of picturing the real Don Pisto.", "author": "Caro S."}

The pork chop ($25) was just so juicy and tender that it kicked ass over the place I just ate at down the block (Original Joe's).  I will be reviewing OJ when I have time.  \n\nBut again, the pork was excellent and the tostada was great tasting. Chips/salsa was salty, just the way I like them (had three \"yelpings\")  Normally at Don Pisto, they push their lime afficionado mentality but I think with lime at $100 a case vs $20 last year, they've toned it done. (hah) ....  \n\nAlso noticed that there was three families there... so I guess if you have crying or loud kids; in this noisy place, no one will notice. There were four obnoxious twenty odd old guys louder than heck while we were there.  Did I say that the pork chop was greatttt??\n\nTime I arrived was on a Friday at 5:30pm .. found a parking space, was immediately seated and had a great blonde cute server who went extra mile.  (btw, I am a girl making a statement and my guy was not THAT cute to warrant the extra service, so I think it was either me or she's just good at her job : ).

We had the Pork Tacos and Tuna Tacos, we weren't extremely hungry and had a red-eye out of SF so wanted to have just enough to put us to sleep.

What I really liked about it was the ambiance (young and hip), rustic decoration, and its fun environment (good music always ads to the pleasure of dinning). \n\nHowever, I was quite disappointed with the quality of food. I went here with my fianc\u00e9 mid week. We didn't have a reservation and walked in. Luckily, they had an empty table for two (pretty much most other tables were taken though, so definitely this place is in high demand, and I would recommend that you make a reservation before you go). \n\nI should say their margaritas was quite delicious! We ordered chips and salsa with guacamole, carne asada, and diablo prawns, and pollo asado. They first brought us chips and salsa with guacamole. It took them good 20 minutes to take us the next dish. By then, we were already quite full digging into the chips and salsa. Then they brought the diablo prawns. My eyes sparked (I love prawns), but shortly after, I had tears dropping from my eyes and nose for the rest of the dinner! Damn! Speaking of HOT?! The sauce on top of the prawns was super \"hot & spicy\" and made me burn throughout the dinner! The food was actually delicious, but they poured way too much of that burning sauce on top, so it was even hard to see the prawns anymore. \n\nNot until we finished the last piece of the initial dish that they cared to bring us other dishes. So the tacos finally came after I swallowed all the hot and spicy diablo prawns and dropped tears as I ate (I'm sure my fianc\u00e9 had a good laughter though because he doesn't like prawns and just watched me finishing that dish alone)! ;)  \n\nThe tacos were average (but also quite spicy)! Nothing too fancy about them though...The chicken however frustrated us....It was greasy and didn't taste great. So overall we were not too impressed with the food here, but the ambiance and vibe inside the restaurant get high scores.   \n\nI would suggest that you go to this place if you want to have a great ambiance and care less about the quality of the food, or if is one of those days that you are feeling hot and spicy! ;)\n\nWas this review...?", "author": "Yasi B."}

We ordered a bunch of different dishes to share:\n\n-Tacos (2/Order, Topped w/Onions & Cilantro). My favorite was the Al Pastor (Grilled Pork Rib Chop, Charred Pineapple, Avocado Salsa, $9), then the Carnitas (Slow Braised Pork, Arbol Salsa, $9), Camarones (Sauteed Shrimp, Garlic, Red Onion, $10), Pescado (Market Fresh Fish, Arbol/Avocado Salsa, Cabbage, Onion slaw, $10), then the Carne Asada (Mesquite Grilled Steak, Arbol Salsa, $9).\n-Mexican Sashimi (Lime, Cilantro, Chile): This was awesome since the hamachi was really fresh and flavorful. Highly recommended!\n-Wild Monterey Calamari (Charcoal Grilled, Orange, Lime, Radish Salad, $15): Just ok. The calamari tasted fresh, but it was a little bland- Skip.\n-Ceviche: Pretty good, and I normally don't like ceviche. The fish was really fresh, and the flavors worked really well together. Recommended.\n-Chips & Salsa ($3) & Guacamole ($6): The salsa had a good level of spicyness, and the guacamole was also good, but needed a little more salt. However, the chips were really good, and salted perfectly.\n-Hamburguesa (Marinated in Bacon, Onions, Served w/Guacamole, $11): I've had the hamburguesa before and really enjoyed it, but thought it was just ok this time around. The patty was a bit overcooked/on the dry side. \n\nOur server was really good, and was able to make some recommendations to help us with our order. I thought the food was good, but not amazing. However, prices are reasonable and all their ingredients seem really fresh. It would be nice if they had at least 1-2 desserts available on the menu, since I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't at least have fruit or cookies or something. Overall, I would recommend checking out Don Pisto's once if you haven't been, but there are other really good restaurants in this area to dine at also.

Ceviche had a sweet twist which I liked but it didn't have much fish in it, the fish in the spicy fish tacos didn't taste very fresh.

Their burger (which I heard they only serve on Wednesdays) was also incredible, and absolutely worth coming here for. The bun in particular was bready yet light -- a great complement to the tender meat patty smeared with avocado and cheese.\n\nUnfortunately, the one taco I tried (with pineapple and pork) was very mediocre, especially for the price. \n\nThe restaurant is charming, but not anything special.

The chips were those fatty kinds that have a double layer with air in between. They were also extremely accommodating and kept refilling our chips and salsa whenever we asked, and also provided multiple plates for our large table. Waitress was really friendly and joked around with us.\n\nI got the Hamburguesa, as well as the Sangria. I like white Sangria better, so this one was kind of strong flavored for me. I liked the flavors of the Hamburguesa, but couldn't really get over how...soft the patty was. I've never had a hamburger where there wasn't some part that was hard. The Hamburguesa is like biting into a mushy meat and guac cloud. My friend said that that was how you could tell the patty was freshly made and homemade, since it was soft (he also mentioned that it's cooked in bacon grease), but I'm still not into the texture.\n\nI was surprised that a restaurant with so many patrons and so well known for their bottomless drinks only has 1 bathroom per gender.", "author": "Melody L."}

I was a bit skeptical at first so I Yelp'd Don Pisto's when I found out my fianc\u00e9 and I would be dining here.  I was so excited after reading everyone's reviews.  We were a group of 12 and luckily someone knew the owner so a large table was waiting for us upon arrival.  The bar area is very tight and gets packed quickly.  I noticed other patrons who arrived around the same time as we did and they waited over 30 mins to be seated.  Our party gathered at the bar to drink and waited for more people before we took our seat.  \n\nI started with their Acai Berry Sangria and it was quite refreshing.  It did not include any fruits so it was a nice full glass of alcohol.  I moved to their Margarita halfway through dinner.  I wouldn't say their alcohol is strong since I had several glasses and only had a slight buzz when we left.  We had 2 pitchers of Sangria, 4 or 5 pitchers of Margaritas, and several buckets of beer.  \n\nWe ordered family style and shared everything. My faves were Al Pastor tacos, Carne Asada tacos, Shrimp tacos, and Fatty Lamb Ribs.  The Hamburguesa was huge in size and had a nice twist to the typical hamburger but I probably won't order again because there are better options.  The sashimi was fresh but the portion was a bit small.  Guac was tasty though I enjoyed the free green salsa much more. \n\nDo not sleep on Don Pisto's.

We switched over to a margarita and that my friends, was well worth it.\n\nWe shared the Chirizo and Mussels, what a brilliant combination! I'm a huge huge fan of mussels these were wonderful, the meat adds a good spicy to the mussel without overpowering it which impressed me, I thought for sure I wouldn't be able to taste the delicate sweetness through the intense heavy flavor but boy was I wrong.. thank goodness!\n\nJ and I also shared the pork chop and when they say pork chop, I think they mean a whole side of pork.. it was HUGE, I had never seen a pork chop that large before.. It was easily enough for two of us and then for a decent meal taken home with us as leftovers. The chop was served with a very light lime/cucumber/chili salad and in my opinion that was the best compliment to the meal as a whole. it added this soft refreshing bit that cleansed the palate. \n\nThe menu is small, so be aware of that.\n\nMusic was strange, we walked in enjoying salsa music and it switched to pop/rap and all sorts of other things, an eclectic mix that is for sure\n\nMinus two starts for the seating/ smoke/cold and sangria.", "author": "Meghan L."}

The ambiance is really cool inside- low lights, early 2000s hip hop blasting, and fairly crowded for Sunday night. The al pastor tacos were definitely a hit, but we also had the Mexican ceviche, oysters, and fish tacos which were all delicious. A few other commenters have complained about the margaritas being made with wine, but it's actually agave wine. A little Wikipedia research showed that it's pretty similar to tequila and a more authentic way to make margaritas.

In terms of the tacos, my favorite was the shrimp and (surprisingly) the carnitas, I liked the least. I thought overall, the tacos were nothing special nor innovating.

I liked the rustic decor and open kitchen, but the food was very average, at least in my humble opinion. I don't quite understand what all the fuss was all about.

The restaurant had low lighting but it really set the tone of laid-back atmosphere of the place.  \n\nI had to try the hamburguesa and of course, the bottomless mimosas. They were serving pineapple mimosas that day which were balanced perfectly with fresh bits of pineapple. The hamburguesa was actually not that appealing upon its arrival to the table as it was just topped with guacamole. However, I bit into it and the patty was moist, juicy and had pure bacon flavor goodness. My friend ordered the huevos rancheros and although I didn't get to try her dish, it looked really fresh and tasty.\n\nOur waitress was really sweet and stopped by our table to re-fill our glasses every time she saw our mimosas running low.

Really great quality Mexican food, but I thought it was overpriced for the portion size. I ordered the Pork Tamale and Egg for $11. It was tiny (a little smaller than my hand) but tasty and their chips and salsa were yummy too! I also ordered a Michelada but it was so salty that I only managed to drink 1/4 of it.

The ceviche ended up coming out last which my friend said was really spicy. \n\nThe fish was cooked perfectly and it might just be because I wasn't hungry but I thought the tacos were just okay. The portions look small but the tacos are extremely filling. They all came with radishes and a pepper on the side. Neither of which I tried. \n\nService was fantastic. We had a great waitress.

On a more lavish night you can share entrees, or if you're feeling like a cheaper bite you can easily fill up on tacos (and chips & salsa!).\n\nThe wait can be a bit long - typically around dinner the waits are 45+ minutes, but they'll take down your phone # so you can take a leisurely stroll in Washington Square park or go get a drink at one of the dozens of nearby bars.\n\nLastly, the seating is optimized for larger groups with a few big family-style tables and mostly four-tops.

Came to this place 2 hours ago and I am so angry that I had to go on Yelp right away. Put my name down and the host told me it would be 30mns until we are seated. This is a Wednesday night and the place is not even busy. After over an hour, we see people who put their names down after us being seated. I don't say anything. My boyfriend ( who was really eager to try this place) walks up to the host and asks him how long until we are seated, he says we are next. A table clears and we wait, and wait. Then I walk up to him and ask him if we could have that table since it is empty and he says \" im sorry it's for a bigger group\". The table is for 4 and I've seen them make 2 groups share a table like that before. So we decided to walk out. I am never coming back to this place again.

EVERYTHING WE ORDERED WAS AMAZING!! The mussels were huge and a meal all their own even though we ordered it as an appetizer. The special was a Chicken Alamadar which was delicious!

Our tab was the following:\n\n1 sangria\n1 michelada\n1 guacamole and chips\n1 order of two tacos al pastor\n1 pork chop\n\nTotal: $53.29.\n\nSangria was weak, full of ice, and lacked any fruit.  Michelada lacked spices and peppers to give it a rounded flavor.   Chips were good though guacamole needed salt, some pepper, and a kick (throw some diced jalapenos in there).  Yes, the two al pastor tacos were on the smaller side but they were the best items we ordered that night.  The al pastor is also good when compared to traditional Mexican restaurants of high quality.  Pork chop was unevenly cooked, a little too much of the glaze on the side that was undercooked but it was a huge piece of meat.

Came here a few weeks back when my cousin was in town and stopped by Don Pisto's at 11:30pm to get some dinner. He had a late work event and I was actually at an awesome Yelp event until pretty late. \n\nThe place was relatively empty except for a few people at the bar and a couple tables so the service was friendly and fast. Unfortunately, they had ran out of a few of the dishes since we came so late which was a bummer, but still had enough options for us to order.\n\nPersonally, I had the fish tacos which were REALLY good. The fish was not fried (which is key!) and the slaw provided the perfect tartness. Even after a 5 course meal, I happily ate both of these. :) We also had the guacamole appetizer and may I say, the guac is solid.

The best sounds always come out from the doors -- the kinds of sounds that lead one to believe that everyone's having a good time!  So, one day, I bit.\n\nAnd I've continued to bite for months, through most of the menu.  My new favorite is the chorizo and mussels -- very delectable and satisfying!  The tortilla soup is crazy good (especially with the large chunks of avocado).  When I'm feeling like tacos, I go straight for the al pastor (and all that roasted pineapple!).  When I'm lucky enough to make it for brunch, I always order the tacos sonora -- hey Pete, are you going to offer this on the normal menu anytime soon?  I'd order it!

First of all, the main dining room isn't that large. For the people who just dropped in and expect to be seated in a reasonable amount of time... on the weekend... in San Francisco... just... no. Think, people. Think. It's not going to happen to and to fault the restaurant when reservations are possible... well, that just doesn't make a lot of sense. Chastising out of the way...\n\nWhat impressed me the most about DP's (heh) wasn't the food, although it ranged from decent to pretty good (I didn't partake in the lobster taco extravaganza; I was trying to be cost-conscious). What left such a positive impression on me was the service. You know that study that says that service is the crucial element in a dining experience and that people will come back and recommend a resto with okay food and excellent service over one with stellar food and crappy service? It's true. It's 100% true. I came here with an unwieldy group of loud eaters and drinkers. Not only did our waitress handle us with a smile, she was on top of orders, drinks, plates, and silverware the entire time. I was impressed. Whereas I, likely, would have been chain-smoking out back if faced with our motley crew, she smiled, joked and navigated our table with the ease of a consummate professional. For her alone, I would come back and recommend (with reservations for a definite seating) it to others. However, since man can't live on service alone (heh), I've gotta tell you to try the shrimp tacos and al pastor tacos. The pollo asado is pretty tasty, as well -- even for those folks who recoil at the thought of ordering a chicken dish when going out to/for dinner. But, truthfully, everything tastes better with a belly full of sangria AND margarita, so be sure not to skimp on the libations.

High ratings on Yelp (I should've known better to be more skeptical) , it was packed , long wait time (should've eaten elsewhere) and when we finally get up close and personal inside, it's just a disappointing mess. \n\nAfter a 1 1/2 hour wait (we only had a party of 5 so they wouldn't take a reservation) we were finally seated in a strange, stuffy downstairs area of the restaurant that smelled like dirty dishes and restroom. Why did it smell like that? Oh , because it's next to both those areas. \nBy the way, Don Pisto's used to be an Argentinian steakhouse (which wasn't so great either) and the inside is almost completely the same. \n\nThe menu is not that big so if you come here and it's busy, don't expect to actually be able to get what you want. They will probably be sold out of many things. \nOur server informed us that they were out of the following things:\n\nNo more salsa\nNo more ceviche \nNo more steak \nNo more lobster \n\nHold the fuq up. I said HOLD DA FUQ UP! Mexican restaurant without salsa?!? What kind of blasphemy is this?! It's like a Chinese restaurant with no soy sauce - UNHEARD OF. \n\nSorely disappointed because 1) my friend and i had our hearts set on the lobster and 2) this left our group with just brunch items and a couple of tacos to choose from. I didn't wait 1 1/2 hours for some damn huevos ranchero as my dinner so I had al pastor tacos. Not impressed. Oily and all, but no heat  no spice. Man these are not al pastor tacos ok.  Estas son chingaderas!!! \nOh. We also had a pitcher of sangria. It wasn't very good. As a matter of fact it was pretty weak, there no were chopped up fruits (was it strained out?) and only a lime in it. \nI don't get why Yelpers rave about the $6 guacamole and chips. Really people? It wasn't worth the $6 nor was it that tasty. It reminded me of Chevy's guacamole!! Just for the record, I never eat at Chevy's by choice. Had to put that out there. I was just soooo hungry that I kept noshing on the chips before my tacos arrived. Starting to suspect that those who love Don Pisto's are also Chipotle fans *gag*\n\nMany of us felt that the food fell short and really needed that salsa. How sad. I love al pastor too so I really wanted this to work. \nTasted the chicken tortilla soup. It was pretty bland. \n\nHonestly, Don Pisto's is for people who are in the area, want to eat somewhere hip/trendy and don't know any better that they should probably visit a taqueria in the Mission. \n\nLet it be known that this was the 2nd longest I have ever waited for a meal (the first was for overrated hipster Outerlands) and it was totally not worth it. The food just fell so short for me that I don't care to find out of their salsa, ceviche, steak or lobster is any good. I mean come on, it's like finding a hot guy with a tiny lil one.

I preferred the steak, but it may have been a bit too spicy for me (and I like spicy). \n\nGreat atmosphere, trendy crowd, and great vibes all around though!

Three components that make it so: cilantro butter, bacon black beans and lobster. \nThe Poc Chuc is juicy and delicious. Can be shared between two (split some tacos too)\nThe Hamburguesa is a great choice if you want a mexican burger.\nThe Civiche is so refreshing. Never ever tastes fishy- and is always chilled.\nAlso- Chorizo Mussels are neck and neck with the Lobster tacos. They are perfectly cooked and merry so well with the Chorizo. The toasted bread is like a godsend to the remaining sauce and bits of Chorizo. Orgasmic. \n\nSo that's a portion of the menu for you. Ambiance is young, hip and loud.

Just sit at the bar and enjoy a drink)\n- Small portions, so either pre-eat, or understand that 1/3 of your meal will most likely be chips\n- Kinda expensive.

Guacamole - Amazing! Fresh avocado, a lot of it, with much less emphasis on the salsa on top. I always hate when most guacamoles are 3 parts salsa, one part avocado. This was the opposite. \n2. Hamburguesa - I never would have ordered this at a Mexican food restaurant had it not been the server's recommendation. The meat is marinated in bacon and onions, so you get this amazingly flavored patty without the actual ingredients overpowering the meat itself. And instead of cheese on top, they put guacamole (see item 1) on it, which is a great addition. So good!\n3. Carne Asada Tacos - melted in our mouths, the table loved 'em. \n4.  Michelada - For those that like their drinks spicy but not tomatoey (like a blood mary), this is very good.  Perfect amount of zing, tastes great, and one will last you the meal!\n\nThe OK: \n1.  Puerto Nuevo Lobster - this was actually very good lobster and the \"fixins\" (rice, beans, cilantro) were great! But for $39, we figured the money was better spent on other items that were equally good for a third the price.  \n\nThe BAD:\n1.  Everything was pretty darn good!  I guess we could have done without the wait...\n\nThe Bottom Line - wonderful food, good cocktails (michelada!) and great service, with a nice yet casual vibe, this is a perfect weeknight dinner spot if you're willing to wait 30 minutes.

I would definitely do this again.  The chips were warm and nicely salted; the guac was full of flavor and noticeably fresh (though lacking a kick).

The tacos are small, but pretty tasty (the fish was my favorite, though the carnitas came in as a close second).  \n\nAs for the space, the place is loud and the lighting dim (I would say a little too dark unless you are seated near the window).

Something about the acoustics of the place makes it really hard to hear your friends. Also I was distracted by the copious amounts of smoke billowing in the open kitchen. It seemed to be ventilated well but I found myself looking in that direction all night and worrying that we were breathing in all that smoke.\n\nFood - I always find \"fancy Mexican food\" to be something of an oxymoron and this place was no exception. \n\nIn terms of deliciousness and flavor their tacos really can't come close to the way tacos should be consumed: standing huddled next to a softly purring truck, squeezing limes with one hand while clutching greasy paper plates with the other. For that kind of experience try Las Peraltas in San Mateo or La Tonayense in the Mission/SOMA.  The carnitas tacos here at Don Pisto's tasted rather flat and fatty and the pescado tacos were too much on the other end of the spectrum, painfully spicy and absurdly salty.\n\nThe tortilla soup, while enormously generous in portion and well balanced in spicy flavors, was frightfully brothy. My gold standard for tortilla soup is the lusciously thick and filling soup served up at the Farmer's Market on Fairfax and 3rd in Los Angeles. Again this one was sure to disappoint when you go in comparing it to a decidedly superior experience.\n\nAdd to that that the tacos average about $4-5 APIECE and you begin to feel like it's a completely overrated/overpriced experience.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Exceptional. Like, whoa. It's not the greasy Mexican food that you're probably used to having; it's fresh, clean and puts a whole new twist on Mexican fare. \n\nThe set up of the menu makes it super conducive to sharing, so plan for that! All three times I've been in, I've had the sashimi, which has been exceptional. Most recently, we also tried the grilled calamari which was ahh-mazing! So, so good; very fresh and super healthy. The tacos that I've tried (the grilled fish and the shrimp varieties) have also been great. The tacos are on the smaller side, so make sure you're ordering enough for the group! \n\nThey don't have a full bar, so don't be shocked when you have limited drink options.

The restaurant was had a couple tables filled so pretty open in terms of seating. We had 5 people in our group so they put us at a 4 top. Seriously? We kinda sat for a bit making fun of the situation but in the end we did ask for a bigger table. Our server had to get the manager as its \"not my decision\" and the manager said they had a big party of 11 coming in at 815pm so they couldn't move us. Really? We had already sat down and ordered -- so we explained we will def be out before the large party so the manager agreed and moved two tables together for us so we could be seated comfortably. But how long do they expect people to sit at tables for -- our table would def be turned in about 1.5 hours. Anyways, for the food we wanted to try the tamales and the hamburger - but they weren't making them that night so  I ordered fish tacos. To my surprise when they came they were tiny (i guess some would call it street style tacos) but for $11, they should make them bigger or add a 3rd taco.

The salsa was super spicy; my mouth was on fire but it was good. The breakfast burritos were really good as well with eggs chorizo and cheese as the filling. This was also very spicy. The guac thankfully gave us a break from the fire in our mouths. The prices here are very reasonable. The breakfast burritos were each $11 and the guac was ~$6. We also ordered lemonade and multiple refills of tortilla chips. In the end, the bill came to $40 which is standard for SF. The only negative i saw (a very small negative) was the restaurant was really loud so I could barely hear my friend.", "author": "Rebecca D."}

Tasty tasty. \n\nMains, tacos with carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor (grilled pork chop)\nThe carnitas ones were the best I think. They had a little crunch to them as well as a juiciness inside. \n\nWe finished off with a bowl of mussels.

The thought of it makes me salivate. \n\nA failed attempt for dinner at Limon brought us all the way from Mission to North Beach, where we luckily scored a parking space on a Saturday night. Don Pistos was bustling with pretty people, making us feel short and inadequate. We were not dressed in our best Saturday night attire as we had just come back from the suburbs of Sacramento. This place is perfect for pre-clubbing eats or group dinners (they have a separate area for groups). The guy who helped us, who I assume was the manager, was point on with his service. We ordered the sangria with our food and when he noticed the food came out before our drinks, he comped us for the drinks. Unexpected but really nice!\n\nThe meal came with complementary freshly made chips and salsa. We opted to add guacamole ($5), which added to the experience. LOTS of guac = happy Tina. The sangria was good, though a bit too much for my sensitive EtOH tolerance. The mango ceviche http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voFE8DTKsTFi1Vzm_zzd0Q?select=fMFrwqnVqwdPYby8Ijqmpg: AMAZING. Must get for sure. Sweet pieces of juicy mango with tuna drizzled with the perfect amount of lime juice. I would come back again for this.\n\nOur group also had the tacos (carne asada, camarones). Greasier than we would have liked but still good. The Hamburgesa (burger marinated with bacon, onions, guac) was also good.\n\nOverall, very hip Mexican street food joint. Definitely more expensive than your typical taco joint but it's all about the experience. Plus, their ceviche is delish!", "author": "Tina T."}

It is small, loud, and if you sit too close to the kitchen you are blasted with a wave of smoke which comes off the grill. Apparently the fan needs an upgrade. The tables are packed in and the ceiling is low, hence the noise. \n\nThe menu is very small and limited for those whom have never been, you have been warned. This is not a place to get a traditional plate. It is \"Chic\" Mexican. So Chic in fact they do not even have a sign, just a street number on front. You park hoping it is the spot, walk up and say, \"OoooooooK, I guess this is the place?\" A little presumptuous if you ask me but so be it. Maybe the sign is on order??\n\n1 J.

I have had better from trucks that were larger, as well I prob would get 4 at this price. The difference is what you pay is definitely not evident in the taste.\n* Guac boring, weak.\n* $45 in Mexican? You shud not walk away hungry. Servings small.\n\nHeard as walking away: Don't believe the hype. This place is not worth the salt of 4.5 stars, unless you are looking for bottomless alcohol.

First we were told there would be an hour wait, put our name in and made our way to the bar.  Nic, the bar tender is a joy to watch and interact with.  The bar may be small but it is very very busy and you get a great view of the cooking line.  We had so much fun that when two seats opened at the bar we took them to have dinner.  \n\nThe guacamole, is divine, it is very simple with a little seasoning, a great texture, and perfectly salted that it tastes like guacamole should taste.  The ceviche was life changing it was so good, the Al Pastor tacos not only changed my life, I believe wars have been started over who gets the last one.  The Pollo Asado was pretty good too, but I was still dreaming of my friend's Al Pastor tacos, and kept wishing he would need to step out so I could help myself to the rest of his dish.\n\nThe staff is fun, happy, and shoot, just makes you glad you came.

Best guac ever, even my Mexican boyfriend agrees.\n\nTacos are pretty expensive, to be honest ($9!!). I got the fish taco of the day and my boyfriend got the carnitas. They actually use the same sauce for both meats, and it didn't amaze us whatsoever. Granted, it's not an authentic Mexican restaurant so we will eat our tacos at Super Taq instead.\n\nService was great, our server was very attentive and kept checking up on us. I was being very reluctant to try the michelada here because I'm VERY picky about it and he actually brought me one on the house when we were about to leave.

I then became a big fan of the poc chuc, that wonderful slab of meat. I am currently obsessed with the Chorizo Mussels, a gorgeous spicy dish that really showcases how the chef is a magician with sauces and spices. I always make a point of asking for some extra toasted bread upfront (dish comes with three slices that you can let soak in the sauce and spread chorizo on...). I typically also have the pitcher of margarita -- not the best margarita I've had, but definitely makes me happy and works well with the dishes here.\n\nOnly downside: Yet another great place that's overwhelmed by its own success. These days wait time for a table is one hour even at 8pm on a Wednesday night. I've been here probably around 40-50 times, including one time when I brought in a group of 15, and the staff at the door still look like they don't ever remember me -- I typically get a \"nice to see you again\" at every establishment that I patronize so frequently. Upside though: kitchen doesn't close until half past midnight, so I usually roll in kind of late (or put my name on the list and go to 15 Romolo for a drink and come back for my table).\n\nIf you like this place, definitely also try Chubby noodle inside Amante bar by the same team.

I'm not sure what other people are talking about, but the food is mediocre at best.  We have lunch catered from them about once a month and the tortillas are always too greasy, the meat (beef, pork and chicken ) all bland tasting, the chips over salted, and the beans under cooked--overall unpalatable.  Not to mention the last time we catered, a number of us felt sick the next day.  Stomach issues everywhere!...scary, no?!  We will certainly not be ordering from this or any other of this guy's restaurants again (i.e. Pisto's Tacos, Chubby Noodle, etc.).  Who likes spending a weekend hovering over a toilet?\n\nMy guess is that they don't care about the quality of their food any more and that they are only trying to cater to the people who come to drink at their establishment.  Don Pisto's has morphed into a nightclub that has no regard for their neighbors  rather than a restaurant that takes pride in the food that they're serving.

Their burger is fantastic, probably the most delicious burger I have ever had in my life. Not anymore. \n\nLast night, I attempted to have dinner there and order my favorite burger. I'm anaphylactically allergic to avocados (meaning when I eat them my entire face swells up and I can't breathe). Usually, I just tell the wait staff to not put the guacamole on my burger, they do that, and I'm able to eat the delicious burger and live to tell about it. Worked out for everyone. \n\nHOWEVER, last night I was made aware of a new policy: They no longer will take guacamole off of food - as it would change the \"vision of the burger.\" Even in cases of food allergy. Chef's orders. Seriously.\n\nThank you, Don Pisto's, for discriminating against a person with food allergies. You've just lost a customer for life.", "author": "Meg K."}

Providing a contemporary take on traditional Mexican street food, Don Pisto's uses quality local ingredients to come up with tasty delights like: mexican sashimi, grilled pork chop, tortilla soup and wild Monterey calamari. There wasn't one disappointing dish amongst the bunch and everything tasted fresh, authentic and stupidly good.\n\nThe wine selection is fantastic (with several Californian options), the place is laid back and the chilled ambiance makes your 30 - 60 minute wait worth your while (this place is packed so I'm afraid you will have to settle in at the bar unless you're extremely lucky). The price/quality is also worth the trip as four of us ate (including a bottle of wine) for under $120 USD.

I'm holding this one against my friends in North Beach because this was a truly amazing food experience that I can't wait to share with other city dwellers...onto the review...\n\nFriday nights always end in two ways for me:\n\n1) I go to a great happy hour with my co-workers and get unintentionally sh*t-faced, then party the night away.\n\nor 2) I go home and lay on the couch with my roommate and down 2 bottles of red.\n\nHow did this past Friday night go? Door number 2. My parents gave me these wine glasses that hold an ENTIRE BOTTLE OF WINE. Yes, an entire bottle. How could we not test this one out? Since it was a science experiment of sorts, it didn't feel so shameful. Anyways...\n\nI woke up Saturday morning with a real headache. You know the one...Too much wine, not enough water, and there's never food around, so what can you do? GET BRUNCH! Weeeeee.\n\nThe roomie suggested Don Pistos and I needed a longer walk than usual (to air out my purple stained teeth ha!), so off we go. \n\nWhat. A. Great. Brunch.\n\nWe were seated rather quickly by an adorable hostess who was not only friendly, but super accommodating. She found us a great spot, immediately brought out water, as well as Don Pistos's famous chips and salsa. This stuff was the real deal. It was a great green salsa with a spicy twist. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know I love the spice, so this was a great surprise for me.\n\nOnto the real upside of this place: bottomless mimosas, sangria, or margarita's. And they're interchangeable. Umm, what? That's amazing. I'll have it all! The mimosas are not mixed with your run-of-the-mill OJ either, but this amazing pineapple-OJ juice. So bomb. \n\nFor my main dish, I had their famous burger. This was probably the most juicy, delicious burger I have had in a longggg time. It was topped with guacamole and had a side of radishes, that really made this burger pop. I would definitely recommend this dish, hands down.\n\nWill I be back to Don Pistos? Absolutely.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Sean R."}

Luckily there are several places nearby to enjoy a beer while waiting.\n\nTried several dishes including the tamales, rib-eye, and tacos.  All were average.  The tamales were great but could have used more flavor (like a red sauce, for example).  Tacos were fine but not as good as Tacolicious and other places nearby.  Standard selection of Mexican beers, although they don't have a liquor license so tequila shots are out (apparently the margaritas are made with an agave-based wine rather than with tequila).\n\nThe upstairs has a cool space, although we were seated downstairs (which has bigger tables and is probably better for groups).  It was very loud and somewhat warm, although it was an unseasonably warm day in SF so I can forgive that.  Service was average, although they were very attentive at constantly refilling the chips (maybe to draw our attention away from the small-ish portions).\n\nAll in all it was fine but I've had much better Mexican food in SF.  Like so many places in SF this seems to be overhyped and overrated.  Next time I'll go to Tacolicious, Mamacita, or Tropisueno instead.

Chips were homemade and not too salty. \n\nNext we shared the Tortilla soup (sold as 2 bowls); lots of chicken and flavour in the dish. You could tell it was homemade too.\n\nEach of us finished with a different taco. Small, and served with piping hot mini corn tortillas I had the Carne Asada (very spicy) and my wife had the Barbacoa. Hers were not was spicy as mine, but both had a different sauce. Sharing and trading was encouraged!\n\nIn the end we had a great meal, ate just enough food not to feel like we rolled out of the place. Our server was pleasant, food came up fast without feeling rushed between courses. If in SF again we would definitely return!", "author": "Paul M."}

My close friends and I came here for New Year's Eve for dinner before we went to a club to dance the rest of 2011 away. My first experience with Don Pisto's was amazing, but I didn't think they could completely blow me away the second time. Yeah, I was wrong.\n\nWe all ordered different dishes, and we each tried a little bit of everyone's food. I had been wanting to try their tortilla soup ever since I saw it on the menu, but the order is big enough to feed TWO people as a full MEAL. Soooo, I talked my 3 dining companions into ordering it as an appetizer for the 4 of us (yenno, along with the chips, salsa, & guacamole we already had on the table...). We did it, and we were all SO glad we did. The tortilla soup is absolutely delectable. Everything about it was cooked perfectly, and the flavor was amazing. The spice sneaks up on you, too. I LOVED it.\n\nI ordered the carnitas tacos, one of my friends ordered the carne asada tacos, and another ordered the camarones tacos. All exceptional, as expected. \n\nOur 4th dining companion ordered one of the specials for the night, the machaca. It's basically marinated, slow cooked beef in a chile sauce, topped with a sunny side up egg. Eaten with tortillas (and rice and beans, if you like), of course. It was fucking PHENOMENAL. If I had known it was going to be that good, I would've ordered that instead of the carnitas. If that's on the menu when you eat at Don Pisto's, you should definitely order it. Trust me, it's worth it.", "author": "Jennifer V."}

When the bill came we were shocked to learn that we were charged full price for the one girl that did not show and they also charged over 20% gratuity to include the one person that did not show.  When we questioned the manager he was rude and said that my friend was made to sign a contract and she should have known that they would charge for the no show?

I had the snapper fish tacos and tortilla soup and the margaritas are wonderful.  I don't like frozen margaritas and they only  make them on the rocks.  Get the guacamole with your chips and skip their house dip. \n\nMy only issue is we had to wait 1.5 hours and since they don't take reservations for parties less than six it was a long wait for four of us.  Get their before seven if you can and it might not be as bad.  My wife and girls thought it was a little too spices so beware if you don't like spicy food.  Maybe order mild if you can't take spicy!   I couldn't eat desert but I don't think they serve it either so not sure what that was about.", "author": "Mickey B."}

I'm not a fan of stupid-big portions and am a hardcore foodie that will drop $500 for 12 courses of great culinary art. The portions are small for what you pay. The aggravating part was that they grossly underestimate your wait (big pet peeve of mine) - we waited twice the estimate. And then we waited a painfully long and unacceptable time before anyone showed up to wait on us. \nThis place has bottomless mimosas on Sunday and that's why the place underachieves. If the food is good and the service is good, you don't need to lure people in with bottomless anything. In fact, bottomless mimosas, margaritas etc yield squatters determined to spend the day getting hammered on the restaurant's dime. This results in the front of the house having no clue how long people will squat and that means people will wait an hour instead of a quoted 30 minutes for a table, which = aggravated customers. It means you don't get tables turning which results in the restaurant AND their wait staff making less money. It's not a formula for sustainable success. Sad but true. The portions need to be a bit more adequate and the service needs to be more attentive...and for heaven's sake sell the mimosas and margaritas, don't give them away.", "author": "Don R."}

When our American counterparts mock our take on Mexican cuisine, *this* is why. They've not just been unnecessarily harsh. For we have not been eating Mexican food all these years. Nope, we have been eating an attempt at Tex Mex instead.\n\nReal Mexican food doesn't come cosily under a duvet of melted cheese, like it's shy and hiding from the world. Nope, it comes fresh, light and spicy. Tacos aren't crunchy shells, they're miniature pancake-like wraps. Chips and salsa ain't from a bag and a jar, they're freshly fried and that sauce ain't bright red nor could it double up as a base for pasta bolognese. Salsa verde's where it's at, and it comes while you're ordering drinks. Margaritas, to be precise.\n\nWhat genuises (geniii?) Laura N and Kevin L are. These two London-based Americans took us out for our regional UK and Ireland Yelp dinner and decided to show us exactly the cuisine we'd been missing out on. Fish tacos, shrimp tacos, pork tacos (all with zingy fresh salad, lemon juice and marinated meats), steak and eggs, spicy tuna sashimi... my oh my. Not a spot of grated cheese in sight, nor a dollop of yoghurty sour cream. Don't make us eat this then send us back to our respective cities across the Altantic where we cannot actually get this type of food, pretty please.\n\nSo I know they do a pretty mean burrito in Pancho's in Manchester, I have it on good American authority (thanks Anyonita G), but this? This is something new altogether. It's not about the refried beans, the cheese, or any of that. Oh how this carrot was dangled and cruelly taken away. Plus, it's one of those uber cool restaurants that doesn't even have a sign or anything, everyone who's worthy of its treats knows where it is just from being eternally hip. Well Don Pisto, I'll miss you greatly. And I'd happily take that 21 hour trek just to reacquaint myself with those tasty fish tacos. Onwards!", "author": "Emma Louise M."}

It is a half a block from my house and the prices are totally reasonable, not to mention the food is always amazing!\n\nI think I've tried almost everything on the menu but favorites are the hamburguesa of course, the chorizo mussels, french toast, chorizo + poached eggs, pork chop... the tacos are good when you're not too hungry, always love oysters and sashimi, and I just tried the carnitas torta yesterday (bomb). They have hands down the best bottomless deal in the area (mmm, sangria), even their (free!) chips and verde salsa are delicious.\n\nYesterday it was my birthday, and the owner Pete was able to fit me and my party of 15 in super last minute, upstairs no less! The service was excellent as usual - I wish I were able to tip our server on top of the 18% auto-gratuity, but alas, getting money from 15 drunk santa clauses is never easy. \n\nWe came here one time and a couple of us ordered the chorizo + poached eggs but our eggs were overdone and cooked through completely. We asked for a few new eggs just to toss on top of the dish, and Pete came by to those of us that got it and comped our plates anyway. Completely unnecessary, and we were not irate by any means, but it does mean a lot for the owner to be attentive and take pride in the food and service - I think it's one of the things that distinguishes a good restaurant from a great one.\n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone!

Knowing they had bottomless mimosas for only $15 per person. It was 2:30 pm when we came in and we knew we only had an hour on the clock to essentially get the party started.\n\nWe sat down and we each ordered mimosas (with pineapple juice instead of orange juice) and both had our eye on the Chorizo & Poached Eggs (housemade country sausage, crema, and potatoes). \n\nWe started on our drinks while munching on the complimentary chips and salsa on the table. Honestly, before the food even came to the table, I think we knocked back two or three yummy mimosas on empty stomachs. When we did get food, I was ready to scarf it down. The potatoes tasted great with a little hot sauce and I loved how the chorizo was crispy. Once the poached egg was broken and running down everything else, I was in heaven. For only 10 bucks for the plate, I was more than pleased!\n\nAt the end of the meal, we had four mimosas under our belt. We were the last people to leave as we finished our meal. Our waitress came by and gave us our last refill, finishing off what was left of the pitcher. I felt like a lush as I stared at the drink filled to the rim. A fellow employee decided to urge me to finish up and I felt like I was at a frat party.

It's served on a large, homemade flour tortilla, topped with beans, pico de gallo and crema.

The carnitas also pulled their weight (\"pulled\"...get it???), being obscenely juicy and crisped a bit for extra flavor.

Before I was even conceived.  Etc.  Forever.\n\nFinally went with a group of friends.  Here is what was put in front of us at one time or another at the throughout dinner.\n\n* Corona Light\n* \"The Don\" Margarita\n* Chips and Green Salsa\n* Mexican sashimi\n* Grilled calamari\n* House-made Chorizo Mussels\n* Al Pastor Tacos\n* Hamburguesa\n\nI wanted to love Don Pistos way more than I did.  I wish Yelp would let me give a 3.39 star review or something.  This isn't a three star rating restaurant, but nor is it a four star rating restaurant, in my opinion.\n\nIt just feels like something is missing.  True, they don't have a liquor license and so technically the liquor is missing.  And yes, the kitchen is extremely small and they don't have dessert options.  And maybe there isn't a sign on the outside of the building so you could say that is missing, but I prefer it that way.  But, I don't really hold any of those things against them.  It's something else. \n\nMaybe it's just that I wasn't blown away by anything that I had to eat here.  Not to say things weren't delicious though.  They were.  Just not all that memorable for me, which I had hoped for.\n\nBut let me make myself clear.  I do not dislike this place.  The staff is very friendly and inviting.  I like the simplistic atmosphere.  It's a comfortable place to have a good dinner at.  And I didn't even touch on the Hamburguesa which is outstanding.  It is delicious.  \n\nSo...at the end of the day though, I do recommend Don Pistos.  Make your own call.  I trust you will have a good experience.  And honestly, might have a different of opinion and be completely blown away by their food.  It's worth a visit in my book.

I'm giving it four stars because although the tacos were excellent, I couldn't hear jack shit while I was there. It was so loud that I couldn't hear a word my boyfriend was saying. I was literally yelling throughout my whole conversation. This place is really meant for groups of 3+ because the ambiance is definitely not intimate and crowded. I think if I was with a group I'd have a better experience but it was hard getting a word in while I was there.\n\nDespite, the noise level the tacos we had were very delicious. We had the Al Pastor and the Carne Asada which was very good.

Carnitas Tacos--Didn't try it, we had so much food, I physically couldn't fit the in my belly. Sad face\n\n3. Pescado Tacos--Again, Didn't try it, we had so much food. I was so full!\n\n4. Camarones Tacos-The shrimp was SO juicy, flavorful, and had a great kick of spice. Very good! \n\n5. Al Pastor Tacos--Very spicy (in a good way), with that hint of citrus from the pineapple= perfection. My favorite tacos of the 5 that we ordered. \n\n6. Mexican Sashimi--this was just ok. Of course, I'm comparing it to the one I had at Nobu. I would skip this entirely. They had a mini jalapeno on top, so I understand the concept, but it doesn't really deliver. \n\n7. Tortilla Soup--this might be the best soup I have ever had! It definitely serves more than 2. We had a table of 6, and we all had a bowl, and some even had seconds! There was avocado in the hot soup--I don't think I've ever had it, but it was delicious. The perfect amount of salt (tortilla soups tend to be overly salty), and it wasn't creamy. There were huge chunks of chicken in it as well. \n\n8. Hamburguesa--I can't describe it. Everyone thinks, \"what the heck is a hambuger doing on the menu?\" Well, TRY IT. There is something about it that is just so good--it has a smoky flavor, kind of like it's been on the bbq just a little longer, but definitely made with love. \n\n9. Pork Chop--cooked and seasoned perfectly! It was juicy and not dry whatsoever, and the mini cucumber salad on the side was something I wanted to learn how to make. \n\n10. Chile Verde Chicken Tostadas--this was good, for sure, just after all those tacos, this is the least memorable dish. you can skip this if you are ordering all those tacos. It's basically a crunchy version of those tacos. \n\n11. 2 servings of rice--it wasn't just plain old rice. It was damn good. They did some seasoning to it, and I'm not usually a rice person, but needless to say, I ate that up like it was my last supper\n\n12. 2 servings of beans--you can definitely tell it wasn't out of a can--or if it was, they really disguised that well!

We were staying down  by Fisherman's wharf and walked up Columbus to find it.  I followed my GPS and stood in front of the Don Pisto's for a couple of minutes until I realized we were there.  There was no signage except the small menus in the window with the name on them.  Since it was dark they were hard to see.  You can find it by the address but you really know you are there because of joy and friendliness of the staff and patrons.  My companion and I are around 50 and we were clearly the oldest (by far) of the people in the restaurant.  It was crowded, but they took our name and told us it would be about 30 minutes.  At 7:30 that was a bit longer than we had wanted to wait but he offered to buy us a drink if we would hang out and wait.  We felt instantly welcome and decided to stay.\n\nI am sure glad we did!!!  The food was amazing.  We eventually were seated at a table in the corner and ordered the guacamole.  Now I am an avocado farmer that has become very adept at making great guacamole, but theirs rivaled anything that I have made.  They also brought out a Tomatillo salsa that was outstanding!!!  \n\nWe first ordered the Tortilla Soup which was very good with generous portions of chicken and vegetables.  It was well flavored but not real spicy.  An excellent way to get the meal started.\n\nWe then ordered the carne asada tacos and the pescado tacos.  The portions are \"small plates\" and the tacos came out very timely.  The carne asada tacos were outstanding with the meat well marinated in a rich sauce.  My companion and I both loved them.  Then she informed me that the I could have the fish tacos because they were too spicy for her.  OMG - the fish taco's were the best I have EVER had.  The sauce that they were marinated fried and served with was incredible.  While a little spicy, the flavor was amazing.  Now I have had all kinds of fish tacos over the years.  I have never had anything close to these.  \n\nAll through the dinner, the staff was enthusiastic, attentive, and incredibly welcoming.  It is definitely a young crowd but the prices are reasonable, the food is outstanding,  The vibe and atmosphere is lively, welcoming, and the kind of place you just want to hang out.  I can't wait till I can come back here again.  Overall a fabulous dining experience!!", "author": "Rick R."}

Once I tucked into the food, I was too full to enjoy any more guac and most of it went to waste.\n- The tortilla soup I ordered on my first visit was less than satisfying - thin and flavorless - really not up to par with their other food.\n- The hamburguesa was a tad too salty on my second visit.\n\nBut, overall, really, really great.

The fish itself wasn't anything to rave about, just basic big, somewhat soft white and red tuna slices, but it was assembled and flavored so well, swimming in a special-purpose salsa-like dressing that could be a dish in itself.\n\nThe sangria was for sure in the top of the class, robust with a good dose of alcohol, with good bottom notes, not too dry but not especially sweet, and a little fizz.  You could drink four of those at a sitting, especially on Sundays when they're $3 all night.\n\nThe chips tonight were a little too thick and chewy for my taste, oil probably wasn't hot enough, but they were homemade and the green salsa was good.\n\nFour stars on the food for tastiness, and an extra star given the price, decor, and total lack of any trouble or fuss.", "author": "Gil S."}

They brought out a 1.5 lb lobster, fluffy thick tortillas, rice, beans, melted butter with cilantro and some cream sauce, and amazing salsa to allow you to make your own burritos. SO GOOD. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and we were both so happy and full after this meal. They also have amazing margaritas and sangria. We also had oysters as well, which were really great too. \n\nI've also been here for brunch a few times, and their brunch is out of this world as well. I only got the breakfast burrito, but I think they took it off the brunch menu (sad face, but I'm ready to try more items!). I also think this is the only place that i've found to have bottomless mimosas, sangria, AND margaritas during brunch. If you come with a big group that orders a variety of the three bottomless options, they will just start bringing out pitchers of everything. \n\nYes, there may be a wait, but it is very, very worth it. They also allow you to give them your number, and you can leave to go to a bar somewhere else until they call to tell you your talbe is ready.

The ambiance was simple; a dark space with mood lighting, lots of chit chatting, and the smell of food and smoke wafting from the open kitchen.\n\nWe ordered the \"Hamburgesa\" and \"Poc Chuc\". \n\nThe \"Hamburgesa\" was different, definitely not the typical version we are used to. It has a slightly smokey flavor to the meat. While it is tasty, I don't think it'd be something I'd particularly crave for. It was lacking something, maybe needed more guacamole, to balance the savoriness of the beef. \n\nThe \"Poc Chuc\" was much better. It had a bold flavor and cooked perfectly. For $17 (versus $25+ that I've seen at other places), I thought the pork chop was a good value as the chop was quite large. \n\nOverall I enjoyed my dining experience here at Don Pisto's.

Oddly enough aside being tucked away into a side street away from the real hustle and bustle of North Beach the decor lends Don P to really actually feel like a hidden gem. Dark wooden tables accented by the brick walls with some abstract paintings gives this place a very seductive feel. \n\nChips: Right away when you sit down a FRESH plate of chips is placed in front of you with salsa. I think we went through 3 plates, it was impossible to stop. I worked hard to restrain myself.\n\nOrdered family style:\nTaco #1 (Carne Asada: mesquite grilled steak, arbol salsa, onions, cilantro)- Delectable!\nTaco #2 (Camarones: Sauteed shrimp, garlic, red onion, avocado salsa) - my fav of the three. Perfectly blended and I love myself some advocado salsa.\nTaco #3 (Al Pastor: grilled rip chop, charred pineapple)- Just my own preference, but not a big fan of pineapple so it was just satisfactory to me. Friends agreed. \n\nHamburguesa (marinated in bacon and onions, guacamole)- Coming in my friend provided a lot of hype about the burger. I came here specifically for the burger and it lived up to the billing. It's a very simple burger, there aren't a million toppings inside and you can actually fit it in your mouth. What it may lack in toppings for some people it makes up in flavor. The meat is very juice and marinading it in bacon and onions is a genius move. I had a great appreciation for the flavor. The guacamole was icing on the cake. Simple and impactful... let the meat shine. My kind of burger!\n\nThe service was excellent altho the waitress found it bizarre when my friend asked for a different kind of salsa for the chips and tacos.

There was also confusion on the bill - the menu states gratuity is automatically added to parties of 6+ so we assumed that it was in there when we got the check. However, the waitress had to tell us after we'd calculated it out that the gratuity was not included. I don't care which way it's done, but please pick one and be consistent on this. Given all this, I'd probably only go back with a small group.\n\nOk, last thing that just tipped me to give the 3 stars instead of the 4: the restaurant was almost suffocatingly smoky for the last part of our meal and as we were leaving, to the point it felt unpleasant in your throat.

I never would've even known about this place if it weren't for 7x7's delicious list of things to eat in San Francisco for 2011. And who would've expected a delicious Mexican restaurant in North Beach?!\n\nMy party of 4 arrived here sometime before 7pm, which was PERFECT because the restaurant started to really fill up between 7 and 7:30. We didn't know what to expect when we read that it was a restaurant mainly specializing in Mexican food. I didn't know to expect if it would be one of those delicious but filthy looking places in the Mission, or something generic like Chevy's.\n\nDon Pistos definitely stands out as its own kind of Mexican restaurant, with a slightly dim classy feel that reminded me of a tavern, but festive enough that it was like other Mexican restaurants.\n\nThe servers were very attentive and good about checking up on us through the evening to make sure that we didn't need anything.\n\nThey start you off by serving you some chips and salsa. It's not just any kind of salsa though. It's the green chile salsa with a slight bit of spice and bursting with flavor. I know I ate almost all of it and hogged it from my friends. For our meals, we ordered the carnitas tacos (small but delicious) and the hamburguesa, which was the dish listed on the 7x7 food list.\n\nThe hamburguesa was AMAZING! It's a meat patty that has been marinated in bacon and onions, topped with house-made guacamole, served on (what I think is) a brioche bun.

Our wait was 2 hours so we must have been at least 5 pitchers of margaritas + sangrias deep by the time we were seated for dinner. We were in the downstairs dining room. Group favorites were the hamburguesa, the carne asada tacos, tortilla soup, ceviche, and mine - the mussels and chorizo. So amazing, and the broth that it was seasoned with... such a sensational experience! I greatly enjoyed dipping my bread in that. Glad I met the Chef/Owner Pete prior to ordering... that was his favorite dish on the menu, and it's now mine.\n\nI do suggest making resos, and getting there early if you want to covet a prime dinner spot during mealtime!

However, considering I paid $10 for two very small tacos, I probably would give it 5/10, but hey, I was in the nice party of North Beach. The closest place I could get $2 tacos with that flavor would be in San Jose/Mission. The dinner menu looks better and would love to try the soup everyone raves about. \n \n-Drinks: 4/10 - cheap for bottomless, $15 for bottomless mimosas/sangrias, and after we finish our glass, we could continue to get mimosas or switch to sangrias. However, the mimosas were different, they didn't have orange juice but something orange flavor. It tasted a bit water down so if you want to feel something, you may need to have 5+ glasses. Same story for the sangria. I personally didn't finish either of my drinks...should have just got one glass for $8. \n\n-Service: 10/10 - very friendly and attentive staff.

They make these with a different fresh fruit juice (was watermelon for a few weeks, then pineapple... my fave!) that puts a nice refreshing spin on the mimosa... or orange juice if you specify.  I also love the Sonora tacos.  I wish they would serve the Machaca beef and eggs on their brunch menu!  Pretty pleeeeaassseeee?\n\nDinner:\nWhat don't I love on the menu?

Even with free flowing drinks and a group, I rare spend more than $40/person. \n\n- Chorizo mussels ($14) : perfect for when I have eaten too many chips and salsa.

Order some sides of guac, pitchers of margaritas/sangria, and you're on your way to a delicious meal.\n\nOne thing to note is that though they offer margaritas, since they have a beer/wine license only, the 'tequila' in them isn't standard tequila... it's some kind of wine. It's really good, but probably not going to get you as drunk as quickly.

Pretty discrete location on Union in North Beach, but that adds to the appeal. The decor is nothing crazy, exposed brick walls & great lighting -- it just works.\n\nThe menu is small, so go with a group and order everything on the menu & it may just be one of the best meals in San Francisco. Well, I take that back... but it's pretty damn good. You have to go with a big group, order tons of food & the fab drinks and it's unbeatable for that type of night. \n\nLet's start with the Chips & Salsa - hands down do not compare to any I have ever eaten. I honestly do not know what it is that makes them stand out but they're like crack... so addicting.\n\nStandout menu item #1: Carne Asado Tacos. Steak was marinated and cooked to perfection. Melt in your mouth good. Def get more than one order.\n\nStandout menu item #2: Tortilla Soup. Esssuper spicy but incredible. It was too hot to handle for some of the people in my group, but I live for this delicious-ness. I wonder if they do take out, because I could easily eat this 3 times a week. \n\n& the drinks.... I am a margarita connoisseur. And the margaritas at Don Pisto's are excellent. Except they're missing one important ingredient: Tequila. That's right - all the cocktails are made with beer & wine. Including the margarita which is made with a 48 proof Chardonnay. The sangria is delish too. Get pitchers & I guarantee you will have no idea you're not drinking liquor. \n\nEver been to La Esquina in NYC? It ALMOST reminds me of that.

I love menudo on Sunday mornings and homemade enchiladas, made by mom, of course. So sizzling platters of stringy, over cooked shrimp and tasteless strips of flavorless beef served with mashed beans and orange rice is definitely NOT my bag baby. I dig really good Mexican food and my bar of measure isn't a super burrito down in the Mission at 2am. \n\nLocated in North Beach, typically known for Italian cuisine, Don Pisto's is one of those perfect \"stand out's\" in a touristy neighborhood geared for out-of-towners. Just a block away from Washington Square on Union Street, parking might be a chore but in that neighborhood the walk is picturesque to say the least, but pay attention! Don Pisto's sports no signage of any kind so aside from a group of folks waiting for seating in front of a mostly plain storefront, it's fairly easy to miss. \n\nThey do not take reservations for parties under 6 so it's not unheard of to wait for up to an hour for a table on the weekends and around 15-25min on average during the week but that's cool, sit down and relax with Pete. The owner/operator and will make with a story or two over a drink. The acai sangria is great but as they have no liquor license the Margarita is wine. \n\nThe feel of the dinning room is rustic and simple-elegant. Brick and mortar walls, heavy, stressed wood beams, cast iron fittings, splashes of red and black make for a warm and comforting experience while dining. Heavy, high backed, wooden chairs accompany candle-lit white clothed table tops with roll-up's.\n\nYou are initially greeted with the requisite chip and salsa combo but unlike your typical taquria, the salsa is a tangy green tomotillo sauce that is acidic, mildly spicy and slightly sweet. The tortilla chips are nice and warm, light and crispy and are seemingly made for the singular purpose of scooping. The best usage of this purpose is scooping gobs of guacamole in your mouth. Bright green, creamy and chunky, the guac is a perfect match for the slightly salty, crispy goodness of the chips as you peruse the menu. \n\nSimple. Thats the best part of this menu. Simple. No confusing combo platters. A Burger cooked in Bacon grease. A steamed lobster dinner. A carnitas plate. Taco's! Taco's, I'm not going to lie. I rarely get past the taco's. The fish taco's are downright vindictive in their tender simplicity. The fish changes frequently but on this trip they were offering Lingcod, pan seared to perfection and lightly dusted in secret spices it's finished off with a light slaw. The al pastor, made with center cut loin, is tangy sweet with a spicy smokiness and delicately tender. I have a hard time ordering anything else.\n\nTo be honest, I'm all about brunch. The Mimosas are made with agua fresca, basically just a shot of watermelon juice instead of OJ in champagne. Let me tell you, so much better than the OJ.  They hand make flower tortillas that are as light and flaky as pie crust, perfect with the chorizo and poached eggs. \n\nDon Pistos is a locals hot spot in a tourists driven Italian neighborhood. They serve excellent food from south of the border with fresh local ingredients, bold flavors in an elegant style, distinguishing themselves from sizzling platter chains and burrito shops. Don Pistos is fun and inviting with excellent service and welcoming ownership. It's a great place for authentic cuisine and a local feel. Be sure to hit brunch on the weekends, try the al pastor -its the best in The City, and ask Pete to do \"Thai Mike\" it's hysterical.", "author": "Matthew A."}

I was killing some time on a Saturday morning in North Beach and wanted to try this place since hearing a great recommendation from a friend.  \n\nThe brunch menu is solid and full of tantalizing choices.  I went for the hamburguesa, and asked for it with a sunny side up egg to boot, because that seemed like a brunch thing to do.  My dish and egg arrived and I slid the egg onto the hamburguesa, and cut the whole thing in half, sending dripping yolk cascading down the sandwich.  Making a production of it all without intent drew some casual onlookers who nodded with approval at what I was doing.  The flavor was solid and I couldn't have been more satisfied.  \n\nService was really good as well.  On my way to the restroom I ran into the owner in the basement prep room, and had a good chat with him.  Apparently he's been working in the restaurant biz since he was 13 and knows what he's doing.  He was very pleasant and offered me a parking card with some leftover credit on it to feed the meter as well!  You can't beat that.\n\nHe told me I really ought to get in there and try dinner as well.  I definitely will do that.", "author": "Kevin M."}

The food is great, atmosphere is cool, friendly service, and the bartender is funny and he remembered us! \n\nI also heard breakfast is good too, so I think I have to try that.

I have heard wonderful things about their dinner, but their brunch was PHENOMENAL! \n\nThe setting is great with a lovely bar as you walk in and open room with an assortment of tables and chairs to the left. We had a large table in the center of the room but never felt squished or that we were in anyone's way. With $15 of bottomless sangria we definitely got our moneys worth! The chips were great and the green salsa they serve is soo tangy and delicious. \n\nOur server was great, always kept our glasses filled, asked if we needed anything and checked in on us regularly (Thanks Cory!). We were there for about 3 hours and never felt rushed. They also play great music, old school hip hop which we all loved and added to the great vibe of the place!\n\nOnto the food...everyone's food looked amazing and  tasted great. I ordered Huevos Rancheros which were excellent. Two come on a plate with a crispy tortilla, eggs, beans, chesse, pico etc. and by the end I was pleasantly filled without being over stuffed. \n\nMy friends got Breakfast Burritos, the Hamburguesa, and two types of Tacos.

So double salt with the chips and guac was just a bit too much.   I ordered the pork chop but the waitress told me that they don't start serving that until 7 or 7:30, which really made me upset.

Now I will go more in depth.\n\nThe hamburgeusa was one of the best hamburger patties I've ever tasted. It actually had more of a \"smoky\" taste than a bacon taste. It was so juicy and the bun was amazing too. Toasted on both sides and just delicious. I only meant to have a couple bites and practically ate half of it. I will admit that the hamburger purist in me was missing the tomato and lettuce. It's already so rich that I don't think it needs cheese and extra sauce. It comes close to one of the best burgers I've ever had except for the fact that I missed my usual garnishes.\n\nWe ordered the Al Pastor tacos (grilled rib chop, charred pineapple ), but truthfully I'm not sure if we got those. I didn't see any pineapple in the taco... maybe it was the Al Pastor... maybe it wasn't. It was still delicious and the corn tortillas are amazing. I'm not normally the biggest fan of corn tortillas (I prefer flour) but these were really delicious with a nice consistency. I hate it when the tortilla is slightly dry and starts to break while I try and eat my taco. Not really an issue here. Nice filling to tortilla ratio and they get a little messy while you eat them.\n\nWe also ordered the shredded kobe beef with 2 fried eggs on top served with corn tortillas. Think of it as a mixture of carnitas (except beef) and huevos rancheros (except no beans). The eggs are served sunny side up and they recommend you to break the yolks and mix it all together. While not extremely bad, this was my least favorite dish. It was a little too salty for me but the tortillas helped with that balance. I liked the hamburger more.\n\nSangria and margaritas are both solid and served in cute glasses. Apparently, Don Pistos does not take reservations for less than 6 people. We got there are 6:45pm on Wednesday and got the last 2-seater table. \n\nI would definitely go back and get the hamburger and try different things on the menu.

The drinks, the service, the food and the ambiance-- Everything worked together to create a wonderful, warm and memorable evening. Everyone wowed at the food together, clinked their delicious drinks together and enjoyed the wonderful atmosphere here.\n\nThe downstairs impressed me for one big reason... There was one table near us, and we were in a big picnic table style set up since we were a large party. And that was it. They could have easily fit in one, maybe two more tables down there. By keeping it emptier, they made it less cramped, more spacious and it seemed less like a busy restaurant and more like a friends house. \n\nWe ate tacos, and lobster was brought down which I was unable to get my hands on... but everyone loved it. The tacos were delicious! We all shared their Margaritas and Sangria which were also great!\n\nThat was my first time there, and I will most definitely be coming back!

They told us that they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. When we asked how early we should get there and if they would be busy at 6:30 they said we should have no problem getting a table. When we arrived at 6:00 just to be safe, they told us it was a 45 minute wait. When they finally did seat our party of FIVE they sat us at a 4 top which meant I had to sit on the corner where there was barley enough room for my plate (while there was an open 6 top right next to us that they wouldn't sit us at). I mean, I have worked in the restaurant business before and when there is a party of 5 you sit them at the 6 top and suck it up! But that is not even the worst of it. One of the people in our party ordered (off of their TINY menu) the mussels and about ten minutes after ordering our waitress came up to us and said they were out of the mussels because they had a bigger party coming in later that they had to save some for in case they ordered them. We were there ordering them NOW and they were saving them for a party larger than 5?? It made no sense! He changed his order to the steak. He asked what came with the steak and the waitress said \"nothing, but I can add a side of rice and beans for you if you want.\" He took that as a consolation prize for not having the mussels and said yes, but when the bill came we were charged for them. Another person in our party ordered the \"fried calamari\" not realizing that the menu said that they were grilled. The waitress put the order in for calamari and when it came back they were grilled. She could have at least told us that they weren't fried! We would have changed the order!

Mexican is my favorite and this place does not disappoint. Starting with the chips and guacamole and salse verde -- yum!! Great thick and crunchy chips without seeming too greasy and the salsa verde is so refreshing with a bit of heat (actually, everything has a nice little kick to it, so be careful if you're not a fan of spice!) \n\nThe menu is small but I have not had anything I did not like, and the company I have been with both times I've been here also loved their dishes.

If you are here, try the bone-in pork chop; it's delicious. Plus, it's large enough to feed two people easily.  The chips, too, were superb; some of the best I've ever eaten.  The menu is small but nevertheless has a good variety. \n\nBe cautious, though, that the upstairs dining room is small, and it is a popular spot with locals.  Reservations are recommended.  I think we'd not have gotten a table if we had not made reservations, even on a week night.\n\nBe aware, too, that the atmosphere is incredibly noisy.

The soup had a rich, deep chicken taste, with tantalizing spices, avocado, and succulent small pieces of chicken.  The server mentioned that the kitchen made Elote (grilled corn on the cob, slathered with a spicy mayonnaise and cotijo cheese) - irresistible and living up to its decadent promise!  The fish tacos (with red snapper) were well done (although I always regret not having ordered carnitas - nothing can compete with the divine pig), the same goes for the carne asada version.\n\nThe service, while friendly and efficient, had some drawbacks, not necessarily its fault, though.  All the food came almost at once!  This is not good when you are enjoying a still-full bowl of piping hot soup.  I could not give up eating the delicious soup, so the tacos and elote got cold, a real shame.\n\nThe long line of patrons waiting for tables made me rush a bit and also contemplate a reservation policy that makes no sense to me:  there were several very big tables empty (the restaurants takes reservations for \"parties of six or more\") while all the while lots of folks were waiting for small tables.

We also know that there never really is a good time to go, and that your chances of finding good parking your first time around the block is about as high as winning the million dollar lottery. That being said, Don Pisto's is worth the agonizing ordeal of finding parking. \nThe flavors and textures of all the dishes we got were spot on. \n- The calamari is a must! It comes out grilled perfectly, and full of flavor. Plus, the presentation is gorgeous, and the colors on the plate really pop. \n- Mexican sashimi with salmon. I was apprehensive about ordering this dish, but my love for sashimi would not let me pass this one up, and I'm glad I didn't. The fish was fatty and fresh and had a bit of zest to it, which was nice because then it didn't end up being overly oily on the mouth. This dish was good, not the best sashimi, but the name tells you what to expect and it's definitely a must try for the curious sashimi-lover. \n-Al pastor tacos. The pork was seasoned very well. Not over-salted like at a lot of places, and the chunks of pineapple really bring out the natural sweetness and flavor of the pork. Yum! Not your usual al pastor meat if you're used to the shredded kind, but this one gives you great texture and a mouthful of deliciousness in every bite.\nI really enjoyed my meal here, and I definitely will be coming back...I just pray that we can find good parking again the next time around.", "author": "Grace C."}

Very minimalistic, very small.\n\nIncidentally, so are their portions. Tiny tacos all around. If you're hungry, be prepared to order seconds.\n\nBut the other reason not to come here hungry, is because you'll be totally willing to order half the menu. Everything on it sounds awesome, and that's generally because they ARE awesome.\n\nIt's also one of the only places I've dined in where they carry Mexican Coke, you know, the kind made with real sugar and in the old fashioned glass bottles? They'll bring it to you with a wedge of lemon, and it's outstanding. Mas refresco, amigos.\n\nThe service is good, it's about as quick as you'd want it to be, but not overattentive either.

I had been to El Raigon once, the Argentinian restaurant that used to be located at the same spot. I'm SO happy with the substitution, and now know that I will come back many many times!\n\nMy friend and I got there at around 8:30, and there were only a few people waiting for a table. We were able to sit at the bar right away, and met the owner, Pete, who is simply one of the most gracious man I have ever met. He was so patient and nice to my friend - who had had a little too much to drink before we got there - I couldn't be more grateful! I was sold right there!\n\nWe started our drinks at the bar, but were soon seated at a table by the window. I have always been a big fan of the ambiance - brick walls, wood straight line tables and chairs, wood counter, dim light. Now they added fun Latin music, which only makes the whole experience more endearing!\n\nWe started with the homemade chips, with tomatillo lime salsa and guacamole. We also ordered the ahi-tuna ceviche and the carne asada tacos. Everything was really simple, but super fresh and full of flavors! I think that's where the charm of the place resides! The ceviche was sort of tropical, with fresh diced mangoes and cilantro. The salsa and guacamole came in large bowls, for my pleasant surprise (LOOOVE big portions!!!). The carne asada tacos had some spice to them, but just enough to give it a nice kick. Everything was nicely complemented by their great - and somewhat spicy - sangria!\n\nI really enjoyed the classy design of the menu, the cozy and elegant ambiance, the beautiful food presentation, the freshness and quality of the ingredients, the flavorful dishes plus the attentive and warm service. I want to come back to try their 'tortas', which are their 'Mexican sandwiches', and also for their brunch, my favorite meal.

Since Don Pisto's doesn't have a liquor license, they make their margaritas with a chardonnay liqueur instead of tequila, which is fine with me.  My boyfriend thought it was too sweet and preferred the less-sweet sangria.  \n\nOur first appetizer was the Mexican Sashimi, a lineup of seven tuna slices covered in cilantro, lime, red pepper, and very thin jalapenos slivers--a tasty combination that suited the freshness of the tuna.  Next, we ordered six oysters on the half shell drizzled in lime juice because we love our oysters and knew they would taste good.  \n\nFor my entree, I had the Hamburguesa, basically a hamburger made with a fluffy, smokey patty with bacon and onion undertones, all covered in guacamole.  I enjoyed it but not to the extent that the boyfriend did.  For his entree, the boyfriend ordered the Manchaca Beef (braised kobe beef) With Eggs, and let me tell you, it was amazing.  I don't know how to describe it other than in pseudo-sexual language.  You know how, once in a long while, you eat something so delicious that it hits that happy spot in the pit of your stomach that releases ungodly amounts of dopamine and puts you on cloud nine for the rest of the night, and when you wake up the next day, all you want is more of it because you want to hit that spot again?

The other two I was eating with thought the same. And the chips, which the waiter had warned as he put them on the table were HOT, having just come out of the fryer, were so yummy, just the right thickness, super crunchy and salty. YUM! We had the fish tacos, so delicious, and the Niman Ranch pork chop, which was recommend by our server. We probably would not have ordered this without the enthusiastic tip but we were all sure glad that we did. I've never seen a pork chop this large, easily big enough for the three of us to share and it was as good as he said it would be, so tender and had great flavor. It fell right off the bone.

Far from the mundane, the chips and salsa (and guac) were right out of guanajuato.  The mussels and chorizo were an amalgamation of traditional andalucian cooking and baja californian inspiration.  The tortilla soup tasted as if the non-existant mexican grandmother of my dreams had made it.  And last, but certainly not least, the tacos des carnitas were better than guadlajara's best.\n\n(to translate, Sabrina says that the tortilla soup was really good and spicy, the carnitas tacos were THE BEST IVE EVER EATEN, and the mussels and chorizo were novel and to die for.  Some of us aren't as smart as Garrett)\n\nAlso, as a perk we got to sit next to Tony Bennett!!  Totally awesome to see him here.

Who does that?  This probably would have been completely fine had there not already been a birthday party in the downstairs room for 40, which seemed to tie up the kitchen staff.\n\nThat being said, it was a very, very long wait for a table (an hour and a half-ish).  To their credit the bartender was friendly as was the rest of the staff, even though our crowd was cramping their walkway to the register.  Luckily the bartender got everyone started on the mimosas and set out some chips for us so we were good to go.  And they had Mexican coke, which is a huge plus in my book.  I have a deep, deep love of chips and salsa, and this place beats all others in recent memory.  Their guacamole is also perfect.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly and personable and put up with our inevitably drunk group, and was even kind enough to just leave pitchers of mimosas on the table.  She was fairly prompt at putting in our order, but the table of 40 was ahead of us so we ended up waiting roughly an hour for food.  All in all it made brunch into an almost four hour ordeal, which I probably would have found unexcusable had I not been in good company, food and staff.  \n\nI will have to try again when I'm ready to party down at brunch with those mimosas and have fewer people.\n\nBut for this round I had the Taco Sonora carne asada, which was really good, just not a huge portion of food (luckily I had already filled up on chips during the long wait).

In a sea of mediocre Italian restaurants, a solid Mexican spot is just what the neighborhood needed. And that's exactly what it is, nothing groundbreaking but a solid neighborhood joint.\n\nThe menu is small but everything on it sounded enticing. We ordered with our eyes instead of our heads (aka ordered way too  much food) and tried:\n\n-ceviche of the day: shrimp with chunks of avocado\n-carne asada tacos (we wanted carnitas but they ran out)\n-pollo asado tacos\n-hamburguesa: they had me at marinated in bacon and onions!\n\nThe tacos came two to an order with a side of pickled chilies/carrots and were surprisingly large. The chicken was a clear winner over the steak, probably the first time I've ever uttered that phrase.\n\nThe ceviche was also a nice portion and had a great, acidic bite. It was served with homemade chips which were really tasty but served cold...I would have preferred the chips warm. We were also offered some chips and salsa as we sat at the bar waiting for our table. Nice touch.\n\nNow, the hamburguesa. I don't know what got in to me to order a burger at a Mexican restaurant but it was definitely the right decision! Slathered in guacamole and served on a soft bun, this is a must order for the burger lover.\n\nService was over the top friendly, though we asked for our food to be paced it did come pretty much all at once. I'll chalk that up to opening month issues. Also, the menu doesn't offer your typical Mexican restaurant options - no enchiladas, no tamales, no three combo platters. Don Pistos is sticking to the upscale street food theme and with food this good, I think they are really on to something. \n\nBonus points for being open late (12:30am during the week, 1am on the weekends) and have a large selection of Mexican beer!

This same notion is also applied when judging restaurants by their appearances. I've never been a \"hole in the wall\" type of lady, so exterior and interior design could be the final reigning factor when trying to figure out where to dine at. With Don Pisto's, I was sold the moment we drove by. \n\nDon Pisto's is discretely located in the North Beach neighborhood on Union street adjacent to a sweet little alley way. The missing restaurant signage and all cream brick facade made Don Pisto's even more mysterious and intriguing. I was unsure of what promises a signless restaurant could hold, but was convinced that the crowd of people that congregated at the front meant the place was popular. Once inside, we were encompassed by dim lighting, red brick walls and a noisy atmosphere. Somehow the chill vibe with a side of chips and salsa accompanied by a strong marg seemed perf for that night's dinner. Although the estimated wait time was about an hour ten, we decided to list our names and grab a couple of drinks at nearby bars since there were several that were walking distance from the restaurant. \n\nFour beers and an hour later, we finally received a call letting us know Don Pisto was ready for us. We settled for the Wild Monterey Calamari, House-made Chorizo Mussels and Carne Asada tacos all washed down with some margs and cerveza and devoured with a side of chips and spicy chile verde salsa. I was impressed with the calamari. I automatically assumed the calamari would be the typical deep fried battered rings of goodness, however much to my surprise (and my inability to read menu descriptions) the calamari was grilled and served on metal skewers. Although I am obsessed with the usual deep fried calamari rings, I absolutely loved Don's take on grilled calamari. Also, I am not the biggest fan of radish, however the radish salad that accompanied the calamari was quite delectable. \n\nSo why three stars? Unfortunately the carne asada taco just couldn't win me over. The taco was drenched with the essence of arbol chile salsa. Now me and spice we have a civil relationship. There's a limit to how much spice I can take, perhaps one can still label me as a novice. Jalapenos, good. Arbol chiles, bad. Very bad. The first bite I took seemed promising until those small hints of heat escalated into a raging fire in my mouth. I wanted to cry, I wanted to die, I wanted to drench my tongue with loads of milk and forget that arbol chile salsa ever entered my mouth. Two bites into my taco and I threw in the towel. I could not manage the spicy no matter how hard I tried. Fortunately our server was very kind and understanding about my lack of tolerance towards absurd heat. She quickly brought out another serving of tacos with less spice, however by the time that was brought out my appetite was already lost. I tried to abate any remnants of heat by devouring everything else in front of me -- mussels, chips, chips and more chips, which ultimately resulted in me being too full to manage even one bite of the second serving of tacos. \n\nDespite the end of my dinner ending with such unfortunate events I was really impressed with the service at Don Pisto's. I truly appreciated how our server tended to that heat mishap and continued to provide such benevolent service.", "author": "Ally C."}

It's nit picky, but whoever built the bar, built it a bit too high for most patrons to sit comfortably and eat. I am 6'1, and it was still high. Get higher chairs guys. \n\nOn to the food. The chips and salsa was a purchase at $3. Kind of expected to be free at most Mexican restaurants. They give you green salsa, which is good tasting, but I generally prefer a tomato salsa. I had the Tortilla soup to start, and it was very good. It was a good size portion perfect for sharing (as it mentions on the menu). My main was the Pollo Asado. The chicken was fresh and organic, but had no real flavor other than the chicken flavor. Not much \"asado\". The dish comes with a proper red salsa, which is what should have come with the chips in the first place. Also comes with green onions. No rice or beans. For $18, a little more garnish on the plate would be appreciated\n\nProps to the bartender Nick who was welcoming and engaging. Gave great service and was busy, but found a great balance to engage the bar eaters as well as service the rest of the restaurant. It should be noted that they only serve beer, sangria, and agave, which tastes different than tequila and is not as strong. I stuck with the beer since I personally drink tequila and do not like the taste of agave.\n\nI am cool with trendy spots, but for the discerning Mexican food connoisseur, a little bit more would go a long way", "author": "Justin H."}

In an \"effort\" to drive more traffic their new sister restaurant, Pisto's (which is less than a stone's throw away), they removed the treasured al pastor, carne asada, and carnitas from the menu.  This now leaves camarones, pescado, and suadero, the bland \"replacement\" for the missing beef and pork, as the only taco and sonora options.  I simply can't stomach how a Mexican restaurant would remove the arguably three best options from the menu.  Furthermore, how can one not offer the Mexican flag ships, carne asada and carnitas?  Not only have you now cut the sonora and taco choices in half, you simultaneously scratched off half of the already limited menus.  I suppose this happened earlier with the street corn and the now limited hamburguesa (Wednesdays only).  Did I mention these options are available daily at Pisto's?  \n\nDespite Don Pisto's being dead to me, there is actually a huge positive side.  Pisto's gains every amazing dish that DP's once served.  These dishes are what made DP's the top Mexican restaurant in the city.  Pisto's has essentially become what Don Pisto's was three years ago.  This is not only true for the food, but also the price point.\n\nIf you are new to Don Pisto's, skip it and pay a visit to Pisto's down the block.\n\nKate and Summer, I applaud you for leaving Don Pisto's and bringing all the perks, as well as the head line-cook with you.\n\n-An old regular.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Don Pistos has added a bit of Mexican flare to North Beach!\n\nIt was Sunday night and the leftover ham from the holidays was looking as good as it ever was for the tenth and may I add, fricken, time. If there was an excuse to ditch the fridge and try out the new Mexican place in my neighborhood, this was a good reason!\n\nIt seems that Sunday evenings for going out in North Beach are a good time for dining deals. As soon as we walked in and gave our name they told us that all their beers were $2 (usually $4) and Sangria (usually $5) was $3. I don't need much more encouragement than that to say yes to a good beer, although I noticed most people seemed to be joyfully sipping on their Sangria special.\n\nI didn't get the chance to go there when it was El Raigon, but the warmth of the brick walls, upbeat Mexican music, and friendly waiters make it a casually fun place to kick back and relax. Their menu is relatively limited in selection, but what it lacks in variety, they make up for in quality. (Coming from leftover ham heaven I had to say no thank you to the Carnitas.) Everything we tried was delicious and came out super fast. And surprise, surprise -- affordable! All dishes were 6 to 9 bucks. Sides of rice or beans, a mere 2 bones. \n\nThis place must go through a crate of limes a day.

The Tortilla Soup, made just like mom would have with huge chunks of shredded chicken and fresh vegetables, was enough for two or three people to share.

The salsa is pure cilantro and the carne asada is made with it as well.  \n\nThat said, the mussels with chorizo are delicious and the tacos pastor and carnitas have amazing flavor.  The prices are very reasonable and they have deals on alcohol on Sunday nights.  \n\nThe owner is always there and is either working behind the bar or visiting the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying their food.  I will definitely continue to eat here.", "author": "stacy b."}

First time there was date night, suggested to us by someone who knew the owner. \nI was a little skeptical because I feel like many places in the same neighborhood are overpriced and overpraised, but i cannot praise those tacos enough!\n\nWe ordered the tortilla soup (one order serves two) for a starter and then both ordered the carnitas tacos. Everything was so good that i asked for a dessert menu but was super sad when they said they don't serve dessert. \n\nWent there a second time for a group holiday party and ate delicious ceviche while i waited for more carnitas. Sadly they never came (apparently they ran out earlier in the night) so I hope the deliciousness was not just a one time thing. Planning another trip so I can make that determination. \n\noh! and the salsa and chips are handmade and worth the trip all by themselves!", "author": "Angelica S."}

I've noticed the service has deteriorated significantly the past three times I've been in.  This weekend tops it ... We were there on Friday night.  Service took forever (literally 20 mins before the server stopped by for water or drink orders) and then the manager comes by to tell us that their credit machine is down when we're ready to pay the bill.  I completely understand that things happen from time-to-time, but the bummer was that they had taken our credit cards initially and charged each of our cards AFTER we'd ended up paying cash.

Over the holidays I became really sick in an out of the hospital and on bed rest, so last Saturday I told my hubby that I needed to get out of town, I wanted to go to my favorite city San Francisco to go eat at one of my favorite little restaurant, Don Pistos, because of traffic my little family of four (our two kids 8&6) didn't get to the restaurant until 8:30. The line was out the door and people were standing outside. We put our name on the list and it was a 2 hour wait. My hubby knew how much it meant for me to eat there so we waited, the kids were tired, hungry and grumpy, he took them to have some gelato next door to keep them up but they hostess' at Don Pistos must of felt bad for us that we were able to get in within 40 minutes. We let the kids order bottled coke to keep them from falling asleep. I seen that they had this amazing lobster on the menu, but the server told us that they were sold out :( Bummer but now I will have an excuse to go again! I told my husband that I'd like to come again the next morning for brunch so I can get my 2nd fix of Don Pisto's. Everyone in my little family enjoyed their meals when the server came with our check she let us know that our drinks were being comped. How nice!! I love this place. We came back the next morning for brunch and I enjoyed bottomless pineapple mimosa's my hubby and I got the sonora taco my daughter got the torta and my son ate off of us. We ask for the bill and I don't know if it was the manager but a really nice young lady came over and told us that the Restaurant was treating us to our brunch. WOW!! how nice! it was such a nice gesture from Don Pistos! We all could not believe how kind they were to us. She said they appreciated our business and that we drove all the way from Fresno and they'd like to see us there again! YES of course we will be back!  We left feeling so blessed and This is my go to restaurant in SF. Hand's down my favorite place to visit.

Now, after trying some of the best foods the Bay has to offer, I wish I had been a bit more frugal with my yelp stars. Don Pisto's is the kind of place I wish I could give 10 stars. 5 stars just doesn't seem to cut it here. \n\nMy experience with Mexican food has always been pretty limited (which is bazaar..being that I am from L.A.). I have always been quite satisfied with pretty mediocre Mexican fare. That is until I found the Intriguing red lights that lured my boyfriend and I into the modest but classy restaurant known as Don Pisto's. Being that it barely opened (and was late), we seemed to be the only ones there. But the staff made us feel like we were having a late dinner at a relatives house. A glance at the simple menu, and I knew good things were in store. \n\nAll we were looking for that night was a late night taco place. That's it. Just a place to satisfy our hungry bellies after 11pm. We had no idea we were going to find such a gem in this side of town. The fish tacos were so above my expectations of what a fish taco could look and taste like. The Carne Asada? Phenominal. Everything on their menu is prepared with such attention to detail; it just simply blows me away. Don Pisto's has set a new gold standard for what I consider good Mexican food.\n\nEveryone, including the owner, was friendly, gracious, helpful, and charming.

The drinks and chips were always refilled promptly, and we were able to split tortilla soup between four people. It was a stretch to split it that far, but i'd say 3 people could easily share the tortilla soup as an appetizer.\n\nIn fact, I'd say the only thing I take issue with is how the tacos are priced and portioned. For about $9, you get two tacos. And these are SMALL tacos. You can see in the pictures that they're not going to fill you up. In order to have a full meal there, you need to have an appetizer or two. But for $9, I find the tacos overpriced. I would have rather seen 3 tacos for $12.

Don't be fooled by the limited menu - everything I've ordered so far has been a winner! I loved the tortilla soup (which they will split into separate bowls if you let them know you are sharing it with someone - it's a huge bowl, so if you are planning to order a selection of dishes I'd recommend splitting with someone), and have tried pretty much all of the tacos. Yum. Plus, they have a great sangria with acai in it to wash it all down. The only problem is that it's been VERY loud every time I've gone there, so even though the wonderful food may be calling to your taste buds, you may want to go somewhere else with parents or grandparents that might have trouble hearing over the noise.", "author": "Caroline T."}

Expect a bit of a wait, but the owner is nice and very accommodating.\n\nFood: Very tasty, fresh, and unique Mexican. The al pastor tacos are delicious! Think carne asada mixed with pineapple and chiles.  I would also get any raw fish or ceviche type dish they have because I am always amazed at the flavor he brings to these dishes.

I can't hear 'ya!!!\"\n\nYeah, that's pretty much my dinner tonight at Don Pistos with hubby.  I resorted to texting him on my cell phone to communicate with him to spare my throat from having to SHOUT!!!  LOL!!!  (Yes, this place is LOUD, though thankfully not as deafening loud as Lime SF, where as soon as I walked in the front lobby of Lime, I *had* to walk out b/c it was giving me a SPLITTING HEADACHE!!!)  But I did find myself thinking \"This place would be a GREAT date place if it wasn't so loud where you couldn't hear yourself think, much less your date talking.\"  I got the sense it was attracting more the clubbin' crowd, since there's were a lot of young 20's ladies in their min skirts and looking like they're about to go out for a night of clubbin'.  (I could just see this last line I wrote causing a rash of  MALE customers coming in here to scope out the girls, thinking about it...)\n\nHubby and I had high hopes when we got this BIG bowl of gauc with our chips and the gauc was tasty... :-P~~\n\nHere's where things are weird and disappointing... at least for hubby (and I had a taste of HIS food so I know it's not just him...)  His carnitas torta was more beans than carnitas.  (That explains the mushy texture.)  Too bad, since the carnitas flavor was decent.  But the REAL disappointment was the carne asada taco.  The arbol salsa that came with the taco was unpleasantly sour.  Unfortunately, it needed the salsa b/c the beef itself was flavorless.  For about $8-9 buck for two small tacos or a small torta, it better kick my socks off... and sadly it was disappointing.(He keeps thinking of Taqueria La Bamba in Mountain View.  That's his standard for all other taco/burrito places to follow...) \n\nThe weird part is that this time around, I liked MY food better than hubby's food.  (Usually it's the other way around!)  My seafood stew was a HIT!!!  (Not too spicy... just enough heat to light up the mouth but sparing the sinus and throat!!!  :)  )   The calamari, shrimp and salmon (tonight's seafood) was tasty.  I liked their Mexican corn.  (The arbol salsa also makes an appearance on the corn, but I was able to scoop most of it off and just have that nice sweet flavor of corn with cilantro and lime flavoring.  :)\n\nPrice is reasonable and our waiter (Corey?) was very nice and knowledgeable!!!  :)\n\nI might come back on my own.  Sadly, hubby won't be back and I totally understand why, which is why the 3 stars review.  He thinks if they change their arbul salsa recently, THEN he might come back to try again.", "author": "Joanna R."}

Now, to your average chip and salsa guy one salsa is pretty good but my girlfriend is in the know and she asks the knees for that red salsa salsa row ha ha!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-02", "description": "This North Beach destination was recommended by a co-worker. Housed in a former Argentinian steakhouse, this resto boasts top-notch flame grilled eats at very reasonable prices. \n\nThe menu looks simple but each dish has its own Don Pisto flavor. We enjoyed the Al Pastor tacos (my mouth is watering just thinking of them), the Carne Asada tacos, the Hamburger. [Aside: We've enjoyed a growing number of SF burgers and must say that Don Pisto's burger is definitely a top 5 (maybe even top 3!) burger. This hunk of meat is marinated in onions and bacon fat before being tossed on the grill and it goes without saying that bacon fat makes everything better. The burger's presentation is simple with a bun and a smear of housemade guac, but each bite is flavorful and delicious.] With two drinks, we spent twenty bucks each and were both filled to the brim. \n\nI must admit that we did miss a few creature comforts (namely fries with the burger and DESSERT for crying out loud!), but our waiter smoothly explained that the size of the restaurant limits the size of the menu. That's fine though, because the things they do, they do very well. (4.5 stars, rounded up)", "author": "AdamLowell C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-22", "description": "We see see occasions of food genius via signature dishes that quickly become a \"must-eat\" fan favorite.  It's    far less frequent that someone shows their mastery of the craft by rocking your face off with a well-known standard.  Like many others, my addiction to Don Pisto's started with the Hamburguesa.  I still remember being served my 1st one and asking the waiter (Corey) what happened to the tomato and the lettuce. He had a kind of confident half-smile on his face when he said \"You try that and if you think it needs something let me know\".  I took my 1st bite and the next thing I remembered was this feeling that I'd somehow lost 2-3 minutes.  I looked down and my burger was gone with the exception of a few crumbs and I think I might have  lost a couple of fingernails.  I'd experienced my 1st (of many to come) Don Pisto's Food Comas.   \n\nHowever, I'm not here to join the bandwagon exclaiming the glory of the Hamburguesa.  That's an older review that's mysteriously disappeared (twice).  I only bring it up to make the point that you'd never think someone who could create such a gateway signature dish would also be able to blow your mind with a well-known standard like \"French Toast\".  Several months later, well into my addiction to Don Pisto's, I'd managed to 'regain consciousness' (after a long  night of 'community work') early enough to catch their Saturday/Sunday brunch. I took a seat at the Bar and explained my dilemma to Nick the bartender who generously offered to assist by selecting a recommendation off of the menu.  I hesitated briefly because I'm not a big fan of French Toast but, in the end, my trust for Nick's judgment and my desire to  recover from my Hamburguesa addiction won.  To make a long story short (probably too late now) it was the best damn French Toast I've ever eaten...with NO exceptions. The food was delivered in no time at all. There were 2 thick slabs of toast accompanied by 3 fat slabs of bacon (and I don't mean that crispy crap that breaks up and crumbles if you look at it hard)...the bottomless Mimosas didn't hurt either.  Every single bite of this meal was a delight and my only concern with the entire experience was whether I was going to continue down the hill to Tony Nik's or head back up the hill and take a nap. To put it simply, this dish is absolutely incredible and if you try it and sincerely don't like it, I'll pay for it since it's unbelievably economically priced at $11.00.  Although Nick has graciously assisted with my 'recovery' by suggesting different items off of the breakfast menu, I seem to have developed an addiction for their omelette...but that's something to share in another review.\n\n*I only review meals that I've eaten at restaurants where I've actually been.  I'll always include a photo of the food I was served if allowed.*", "author": "Cordane C."}

I had made reservations a month before the actual day to ensure everything would perfect. Everything seemed to be all set up and ready to-go until the moment we set foot in the restaurant. I had 20 people on the reservation list (which is why i made them so early) and they first had the reservation time wrong as well as the number of people wrong. The female manager who was working was extremely rude. She seemed to be put out that she had to change things around on her end and insisted I had the time wrong and didnt show up when I originally said I would. I offered to show her my email chain that I had been having for the past month but she declined. \n\nThe preset menu they originally had insisted we use was not put out causing even more confusion. I then had to tell her it was not the correct menu, take my own parties order (good thing I worked at a restaurant before!) and tell them we all wanted. She once again acted extremely rude. They then didnt put out the correct appetizers and we had to again ask for the correct food order. \n\nTowards the middle to end of our dinner they seemed to pull things together and one of the workers helped to make sure we had everything we needed. He was a huge help because we were about to walk out and go to the pizza place down the street. \n\nWe spent almost $1,000 dollars there and it would seem to me that a Manager of all people should go above and beyond to satisfy a party that large.

It took finally looking the address up online to find the name.  After finally going there last week, I'd say the hype is warranted.\n\nThis place has a very unique menu (especially for the location), a trendy chill environment, and some really good food.  They start by giving you chips and green salsa - excellent.  The margarita and sangria were both quite good.  We ordered the carnitas tacos and fish tacos to start.  The ingredients were fresh with unique flavors, but still a little bland - maybe needed seasoning?  I'm not sure if the shells are supposed to be \"authentic\" style but would have liked some variety to match the ingredients inside.  Crunchy shells would have been awesome.  The soft bland taco shells took away from the overall taste quite a bit.  At this point, I had mixed feelings about the place...then our pork chop dish came.  It was marinated in a spicy orange sauce with cucumber salad on the side.  Absolutely the BEST pork dish I've ever eaten.  Very tender, perfectly grilled, great flavor, and paired perfectly with the cucumber salad.\n\nThe place is mostly young people; didn't see anyone over 35 maybe.  It was very crowded and we waited for 30 minutes.  They do not take reservations unless you have 6 or more in your party (maybe worth rounding up more people to go).

We have been back several times since our first visit and are huge fans. Last time we went we tried their Hamburguesa, a hamburger marinated in bacon and onions and then ground up, grilled and topped with guacamole. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! We also tried their Michelada, Sol beer, lime, and tapatio over ice. This is a spicy and yet refreshing beverage!

Because what better way to celebrate St. Patty's day than with a little south of the border flair (yeah, not so festive for this holiday, but we won't hold that against this place).  \n\nWe were initially impressed by their green salsa (ooh a little st. patty's day spice perhaps?) as evidence by our quickly empty chip bowl, and then more so impressed by their guac.  I opted for the tortilla soup and my friend got tacos.  She loved her dinner, and I loved mine but I was unfortunately too full from all the chips (and maybe the fact that i'd had a huge slice of cheesecake about an hour earlier).  All in all, fresh tasting mexican fare that left us happy/in a little bit of pain (the good kind of course).  \n\nWe dug the vibe, appreciated the water pitchers on the table, and enjoyed the acai sangria and the background music.  However, it was really crowded when we got there and the waitstaff was clearly hurried and stressed out by all the people, so it took awhile for us to get seated, even after a huge wave of patrons left.

We were greeted by friendly staff and ended up waiting like 5 or 10 mehnutes for a table.  Once a table opened up, the bus boy (without asking) put three mehmosas on the table and bounced.  One of us didn't even want to drink.  Not sure what to mehke of it; want to rack up the bill or something?  The waiter kindly took a mehmosa off our bill after we told him what the dealio was.  It took about 10 mehnutes of mehmosa chuggin' to get our food ordered; two hambur'grease'as and a huevos rancheros plate.  Now the real waiting game begins.  Drink more, lol around, yell over the screaming bros just so the person next to you can hear what you're saying, drink more, get a free fish taco plate because of a typo from our order, wait, drink mo, mo, mo, wait, get the two boiygas at the same time, drink mo, and wait for days long (~25 minutes) for the third dish, huevos rancheros, to come come out.  The kitchen was pretty slammed, but it was kind of off-putting finishing our burgers before the eggs came out.  Mofos apologized.\n\nNon-shitty-storytelling part of the review:\n\nHamburg'meh'sas ($9) - Good, toasty bun.  The meat has bacon marinated into the beef, so that's an obvious \"fuck yeah,\" right?  Na gurl, shit was like meatloaf-consistency except greasier and not as tasty as you'd hope for.  What would be good is if they cooked the bacon crispy and then threw it into the ground beef for some texture and stuff.  The only condiment that comes on the burger is some pretty standard guacamole.  Not worth it.\n\nBottomless Meh'mosas ($13) - not that meh, pretty good.\n\nFish Tacos (Free, bitches) - Cooked well, nice crust, no/not enough salt added.  Basically, a tasteless dish.  They have a ramekin of salt on the table, so maybe they want you to salt your own food?  \n\nChips and Salsa (Complimentary) - Chips were good.  Add your own salt, again.  Salsa was like other people described it; gotta lotta lime.\n\nI'd probably come back just to get sloppy off their mimosas and shit all over their bathroom (in a good way).  The food kinda blows fat dick-sack, but the staff are pretty chill.  Plan for possible, future trips to this place: go to the bakery up the street and get some 'donk good bread then come here to get your drank on.", "author": "Gar Y."}

I was quite impressed. The menu is small, which I generally find to be a good sign. There is no prominent sign, which I generally find to be a good sign. They were very willing to create something good for the vegetarians in our group - they were quite happy. The chef/owner graciously came to discuss a custom veggie dish.\n\nIf I were going to find fault, it would be that things weren't really all that spicy - flavorful for sure, but not very spicy. I think this reflects the fact that real Mexican food is not necessarily burn-your-mouth spicy, but very flavorful and savory. The guac has much more spice than the salsa, but both are good. The presentations are great, and the prices are very reasonable.\n\nThis a great choice in the area, and certainly a step up in ambience from the grimy (albeit super tasty) taquerias in the Mission.", "author": "Ben K."}

The fact that he not only already read my review, but responded to it right away gave me a ton of respect for this place. He even offered a dinner on the house for my friend and me, and gave me his cellphone number to set it up. That's above and beyond what is necessary, but obviously, this guy cares about customer experience.\n\nAnd for that, plus their delicious tortilla soup and fresh-out-of-the-fryer tortilla chips, I give you 4 stars, Pete. Thanks for responding to my review so quickly. Thanks for offering the free meal (full disclosure: I declined the offer). Cheers.\n\n--\nLet me start by saying that their tortilla soup was fantastic. The entrees, the chips and salsa, and even the drinks are all reasons I'd consider going back here, and at the end of the day, those are the best reasons to dine out anyway, right?\n\nMy only problem was with the service. Our waiter was friendly, sure, but it took awhile just to put in our drink orders, at least another 10 minutes to get 2 sangrias, and then at least another 15 after that to place an order (our waiter wasn't the person who delivered our drinks, unfortunately). I didn't want to be rude, but after awhile, both my friend and I were trying to catch his attention every time he walked by. I'm not super picky about service, but having to ask the waiter if you can place an order is just not acceptable.\n\nIt's a new restaurant, so my guess is that maybe they're still working out the kinks, and I'd probably venture back the next time I have a craving for tortilla soup. In the meantime, I'd recommend going here when you don't have some place to be afterward.", "author": "Kat E."}

Once we were seated I found the wait staff to be friendly but necessarily attentive.  \n\nThe food had good flavor but was overly salty.  The portion sizes are fine for one person (or to share several dishes with 2 people).  The wait staff recommends sharing but if you go that route with a big group you may want to order several of the same dish to make sure that everyone gets more than one bite.

Great tacos and tortas.\n- complimentary fresh, thick, warm and salty tortilla chips with tomatilla salsa\n- guacamole: fresh and tasty\n- Pescadore Taco: Halibut was the fish of the day, this was my favorite thing by far\n- Carne Asadas Taco: Good, very flavorful, could have used some cabbage for some texture\n- Carnitas Torta: Also very tasty, shredded juicy carnitas, queso fresco and some green sauce (maybe tomatillo salsa), mmmm, the roll was especially good\nI won't be surprised if I come back a few times in the coming weeks before I leave my beloved North Beach. I highly recommend this place.", "author": "Rose K."}

I have been working in the neighborhood for 2 years and have become completely spoiled by our fantastic food options. That said, Don Pistos is solidly in the running for my favorite in the entire hood. The attention to detail and innovation shines through and makes this much more than quick to-go taqueria . This is 100% the kind of place you want to go in sit down and savor every bit of your FRESH amazing food! If you go in and sit at the counter, you've got a fair chance of enjoying a beer with the owner while you wait, who is clearly a man who takes pride in his food and his restaurant. \n\nHands down the beset mexican food for miles around and possibly the best new (ish) restaurant in North Beach over all. \n\n*tip*  Best guac in the entire city!!!!!

The restaurant looked like its part of a building complex. \n\nI read so many great reviews about don pisto's and was looking forward to eat the tacos and take advantage of the bottomless margaritas, mimosas and sangria.  I was completely unimpressed with all the drinks and most of the tacos. We had a big group and was seated in the private area with a pre-ordered set menu for $30/person.  Long story short, we had some issues about how many tacos a person should get since the menu was set. Margaritas tasted inconsistent and watered down, sangria tasted like medicine and mimosas were not cold enough. We had beef, fish, shrimp and al pastor tacos and most of them were ok. The ones that really stood out to me were the shrimp and beef tacos.  Shrimp was full of flavor and the beef was very juicy and was cooked medium so it was a little red, which I like.  I don't think I would ever want to come back here again for brunch or to pay $9 for two small tacos for a la carte. I would rather go to the mission and pay $4 for two tacos that are authentic and full of meat and flavor.", "author": "Irene L."}

Looking around, the drinks are flowing, everyone is having a great morning, the kitchen is busy, and the food smells amazing! Less than 10 minutes later we are seated and told about the bottomless mimosas, margaritas, sangria (and you can have all 3 if ya want) for $17. Ordered guac, steak tacos and a pork \"burrito\". The food came out pretty quick and I have to tell you, this was some of the best mexican food I have ever had. The pork was so juicy and flavorful, the steak tacos were delicious. The homemade chips were the right amount of salt and crunch and the salsa and guacamole were addicting.  Pair that with our everflowing drinks, I died and went to food heaven.

Both fresh and homemade. \n\nTheir salsa is a salsa verde, so if you're craving something tomatoey you're going to have to accept the tomatillo! The guacamole is good and has a tiny bit of a bite to it, unlike many places that forget that it can be good that way. \n\nWe started with the carnitas tacos. I normally don't get carnitas tacos, but these are melt in your mouth good! I fancy myself a carne asada connoisseur but honestly I think I'll be ordering the carnitas tacos before the carne ones. \n\nOnly really down side to my meal was that the pacing was too fast. They kept bringing more plates and we had no place to put them on the table, so keep that in mind when ordering. Also, note that the tacos are small, but they do come two to a plate so they are great to share if you want to experience a couple of different kinds.\n\nThey lack margaritas on their menu, which is kind of a bummer for a mexican restaurant, so go with a cerveza in mind. \n\nI can't wait to go back!!

We arrived late after walking from HH at the warf on a Thursday night and the place was packed.  Immediately the wave of intense flavor/smell hit me and I knew it was worth the wait.  Yes the kitchen is located directly in the center of the restaurant but its cool to see the chef Giermo do his thing.\n\nWe ordered margarittas and because they do not have a liquor liceanse they were made from agave wine. Not bad, a little sweet.  You can always tell a good mexican restaurant by their chips and salsa.  Don Pistos has amazing chips and salsa (three kinds, two of which were very fresh and good).\n\nOkay, the good stuff.  So, you have to try the hamburguesa...I mean its marinated in bacon and onions, guacamole...who dosent think anything marinated in bacon dosent taste good?  Honestly the best tasting most flavorful hamburger I've ever tasted.  Dont you dare ask for ketchup.  I have been dreaming of one since we left.  We also split a Poc Chuc  (grilled pork rib chop, orange chili marinade, spicy cucumber salad) and it was also amazingly tasty and very large.\n\nAll in all we had a great experience and found it very reasonable for cost considering the quality of the food we ate.  \n\nGo check it out, you wont be disappointed!", "author": "Jon B."}

There was so much juicy, well seasoned beef in every bite, and it came with a roasted jalapeno on the side so you could add as much spice as you like.  For some reason, the beers were only $2 (we were there at 6:45 on Sunday; Happy Hour maybe?) and the chips and salsa were delicious as well.  We also got the tacos al pastor.  They were good, but I wish I would have tried those first because after the carne asada, I was dissappointed.", "author": "Scott G."}

Located in a beautiful brick builiding, Don Pisto's has friendly servers, and great quality food and drinks. Their chips and salsa verde is the best, and they refill it generously. I have been to Don Pisto's about 6 times and it is always a treat. The Machaca, which is a tender beef stew with a sunny side up egg on top is to die for! The tacos are better than any in the Mission, because the flavors are inventive and the meats are of the highest quality. Also super tasty are the chicken tostadas, tortilla soup, their hamburguesa (burger), the guacamole and the margaritas. I have recommended this restaurant to several people and everyone who has tried it raves about it along with me! I wish I could eat their food every day, I would do so happily!", "author": "Fabiola M."}

We walk in and it's superloud, the crowd was very Marina, and then we look at the menu, and it's a little more expensive than I was expecting for a taco place. But, my friends, this is no taco place. \nFor appetizers, we ordered mussels and chorizo. With my first bite, my mind was immediately changed. I'd pay whatever you wanted me to for those mussels and chorizo! \nFor dinner, my husband ordered the carne guisada and I ordered the shrimp tacos. Again, delicious!\nThe carne guisada was some of the best meat I'd ever tasted. I mean, it just melted in your mouth! The shrimp was also great. And the portions were surprisingly pretty filling.\nI'm so glad our friends recommended this place, and I really can't wait to try it again.\nOnly complaint, is that the place is extremely loud, something about the brick walls. So it's not good for low talkers or first dates.  Otherwise, it's A-OK in my books!", "author": "Lizette R."}

We explained that we did not expect service until opening, just wanted to wait inside. The host acted like we were the most uncouth people who have ever walked into his restaurant and made it clear he was doing us a big favor by letting us stay. Needless to say we promptly left. Nobody should be treated like that. Sadly, we will not be supporting Don Pisto's and will encourage our neighbors to do the same.", "author": "Heather S."}

It turned out to be a long trek but well worth it. I sat at the bar, where the full menu is offered, had a glass of wine and some food. The calamari app is a revelation (took that from \"I Love You, Man\") and is a must have. The bartender was very friendly and funny. It's a very small bar and he does a great job of getting everyone sitting there involved with one another. The two girls next to me did some app trading and socializing thanks to him breaking the ice. Everyone at the bar was even given a delicious house made shot on the house at one point. The Mexican Sashimi was the other app I tried; also amazing. My entree was the pollo asado which came with mini tortillas, guac, and a very flavorful salsa verde (ask for their hotter salsa to spice it up, also very tasty. The pollo had a glaze over it and fell apart very easily into pieces, which made my taco building that much easier. Very small menu, but smart because everything is made to perfection.

Dining solo that night, I figured it wouldn't be too hard to just sneak into the bar, grab some food and head out.  Well, I came in and found this place was packed!  The bar is relatively small and was quite occupied to say the least.  Nevertheless, I remained persistent and waited...and waited, and waited...for over 45 minutes before a seat cleared.  Now this was completely volitional and I was not expecting any special treatment because of my decisions.  Nevertheless, the staff was so incredibly friendly!  The manager thanked me for waiting!  The bartender (Katie), came out and bought me 2 Dos XX on the house, while I waited!  When I finally sat down, she promptly handed me a menu when I noticed a lack of vegetarian options.  No sweat, she came up with a veggie taco option for me and within 15 minutes I had incredibly tasty veggie tacos, a load of guacamole and some salsa to snack on.  This entire meal was billed at $7.47, which was absolutely fantastic.  The bartender introduced herself to me, was super personable and made me feel welcome.

While I could get an equally good taco for much less at my local taco truck in Oakland, this is a great option for those who want a nicer sit down meal with authentic Mexican flavors. The atmosphere is great and has a rustic feel with brick walls and wood tables, so it made the overall experience a very nice one. \nAs for service, our waitress was a little overly eager to take our plates and move the meal along.

It's a small little Mexican place tucked away in North Beach. Even though they don't take reservations, the owner was very nice to set aside a big table for our group. Unfortunately they had a problem with the furnace downstairs that night so we couldn't sit there as planned, but they'd nicely called ahead and told us the news and still had a large table at the noisier upstairs for us.\n\nThey have a very limited menu that sells upscale Mexican street food which roughly translates as \"tiny portions of fancier Mexican for not so tiny prices.\" Still, it was a nice change of pace from the usual burritos y tacos.  I tried to order a diet coke (no luck, only Mexican coke here), so Corona o sangria is a better beverage bet. There's very little on the menu if you're vegetarian, though I guess you can enjoy the bowls of chips and guacomole.\n\nI ordered from the seafood part of the menu and I have to say I was worried when I saw my tablemate's ceviche arrive. It was beautiful and yummy looking. It was also small. Seriously, I was going to need to order at least three, plus some sides, for that amount of food to cut it for me. Just then the waiter arrived with a huge steaming claypot that he started to put in front of me. I said, \"nope, not mine.\" The waiter said, \"are you sure?\" I replied that I was certain. Then he pointed out that I had indeed ordered a seafood dish that came in a clay pot. I'd neglected to RTFM to note the word \"stew\" in the title of my entree. The waiter looked worried and was super nice to me and offered to bring me something else. But my ignorance was bliss! Here I got a huge tasty stew of mixed seafood in a spicy tomato broth flecked with corn and onions. Totally different than what I expected and totally a better choice than the thimble-sized tacos. My husband who helped me finish the stew agreed that my menu selection was right on, however clueless I was when it arrived. I shot a big thumbs-up to the waiter when he came around again.

Even though they are getting more and more busy, I never have to wait that long for a table and am happy to chill at the bar for a drink while I wait. At this point I have ordered almost everything on the menu and I have loved every bite. The carne asada tacos are my favorite and the fish tacos are always perfection. The tortilla soup is the best cure for a hangover or cold, and the fresh tomatillo salsa compliments everything on the menu. I obviously highly recommend this place if you are looking for fresh and delicious Mexican food in the North Beach area.", "author": "Noel M."}

We chose to go here after seeing how many reviews it got and the number of stars it received. We walked in and the place was extremely packed and bursting with life. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table for 2, so I suggest if you want to check it out, you make a reservation. We waited at the front bar and decided to try a Michelada. It's basically beer with tapatio and lime juice and a salt rim. It was super refreshing and delicious, plus it gets your palate ready for the meal. We sat down and had a super friendly waitress who was more than willing to make suggestions. We ordered the calamari, diabla shrimp, tortilla soup, and fish tacos. The calamari was spectacular. It is charcoal grilled on skewers with onions and marinaded in an orange citrus sauce and served with radish salad (which kind of tastes like a ceviche). It was delicious! I definitely suggest trying it out, because it's not like the usual fried calamari and you don't feel like a cheater when eating it :) The diabla shrimp was nice and spicy. There are 5 shrimp and they're cooked in a diabla sauce. The sauce is really tasty and I suggest trying this as well. The tortilla soup was pretty watery and bland, although after we added some salt and hot sauce it was pretty good, I don't like going to restaurants and having to change the taste of the meal. Finally the fish tacos, each taco plate comes with two tacos. The fish tacos were grilled fish topped with avocado salsa and some cabbage slaw. The fish was really good, but my only complaint was there was too much cabbage and too little flavor. I would definitely come back here to try out the other things on the menu. The atmosphere is really fun, portions are big, and the servers are friendly. The only problem is that parking is a b*tch :)", "author": "Neha H."}

Some of the guys we were with had the carnitas and hamburguesas tortas and said they were good good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-29", "description": "RESTAURANT REVIEW\nNEW STREET FOOD EATERY HAS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF THE ECONOMY\nBy Carol Peterson\nDON PISTO'S, 510 Union St., San Francisco 94133\n415.395.0939 ***  1/2\n After spending many years in and out of Baja California, Pete Mrabe knew what he particularly liked about the food he enjoyed on the on the streets of Baja. It was fresh and made with simple ingredients. Pete, who had worked in the restaurant business for a number of years and had always had plans to open his own place, now knew what he wanted to do: Bring the street food of Mexico to North Beach. His primary thought was to have a takeout place, a sort of fast food takeout location, but when he found the empty El Ragon space on Union Street he reconsidered. The rustic brick interior, welcoming bar, and open kitchen provided the perfect mix for the restaurant Pete calls Don Pisto's.\n\nSoon after the restaurant opened, I stopped in to take a look at the menu and was rather surprised by the relatively few items offered. There are only five groupings to choose from: Tacos, Tortas, Ceviche, Pisto's (specialties of the house) and Sides-- only 16 food choices in all at about $8 to $11 per item. There are also 9 beers, 7 wines, Sangria, and non alcoholic drinks, all quite reasonably priced. I realized that Pete had a brilliant idea here. The short menu keeps the inventory down and the food fresh. Pete told me, \"I wanted to duplicate the street food that I loved in Baja. The vendors buy only the simple ingredients they will use for that day; when they are gone, they close shop and go home. This is the formula I am using in the restaurant.\" At Don Pisto's, Pete is the chef and when he opens in the evening, his 3 assistants put together the dishes that he has spent most of the morning creating.\n\nLike other conscientious local restaurant folk, Pete goes to high end farms for his purchases. But what makes him different from an expensive steak house, for example, is that he buys the undesirable cuts of meat no one else wants, then cooks them for 3-4 hours, which renders them tender and tasty. And everything about Don Pisto spells \"fresh.\" The tortilla chips are made every twenty minutes and served with an addictive cilantro, green chili and garlic sauce. The guacamole is also made every twenty minutes to guarantee its freshness.\n\nThe second time I ate at Don Pisto's, the menu had changed almost completely. This time I fell in love with the astounding Carne Asada Taco, which is mesquite grilled steak, onions, cilantro and arbol salsa, which is tomatillo, smoked chili puree, garlic and salt. The Al Pastor Taco is also a winner. It's a grilled rib chop with charred pineapple. The pineapple gives this taco a unique flavor that just keeps coming. One other taco I tried was the Camarones. As a lover of shrimp, I found this combination of saut\u00e9ed shrimp, garlic, red onion, and avocado salsa the perfect combination.\nWhen I saw the Hamburguesa brought to table after table, I thought I should taste it. This popular dish is continually on the menu. It looks like a standard hamburger but the crumbled meat has been marinated in bacon and onions, and it's garnished with a spread of guacamole on the top. The bun--as would be expected at Don Pisto's--is fresh and hot. You will never again look at a hamburger in the same way after eating this delicious variation. \n\nIf you are a lover of Ceviche, you must try any Pete has on the menu. The Ahi Tuna Con Mango is outstanding, with a crunchy tortilla supporting tender tuna slices with Serrano chilies, mango, red onion and lime juice. \n\nYou may have noted I have mentioned more than my usual number of food choices in this review. As the Semaphore has no budget to support food critics, I am on my own when the check comes. And the amazing thing about this new restaurant is that you can try many delicious dishes, a sangria or Mexican beer and have a very inexpensive dinner. \n\nI have saved until last the first question most every new arrival at Don Pisto's, including me, asks Pete, \"Why don't you have a sign in front of your restaurant?\"  Answering, he laughed and said, \"At first, I was just too busy to order one and then people kept telling me it is cool I don't have a sign. I've been thinking of a neon TACO sign in the window but haven't made up my mind.\" So the contest is on. When you go into Don Pisto's, weigh in on the sign controversy. But don't worry, sign or no sign, you won't be able to miss the restaurant. Just follow the alluring aromas wafting up and down Union Street.", "author": "Carol P."}

That being said, it was around 10:30 and this place stays open until 12:30 (which automatically gives it extra points since so few good places stay open that late for food).  We walked in and were seated (yes, this is a sit down restaurant) by a very friendly server (and all the staff were extremely friendly) and had a look at the menu.  It's pretty limited in choices but sometimes that's better and when everything is good, it doesn't really matter!  I was tempted to order the ceviche since it's a favorite dish of mine and I had read a few reviews saying how good it was, but I wanted something a bit more hearty so I got the chicken tacos while Andrei Z ordered the pork tacos.  While we waited we were served chips and salsa. I have to say, this salsa here was pretty amazing.  It's a green salsa and pretty spicy but so full of flavor.  I wanted to bottle it up and take it home with me!  The tacos were brought out & they hit the spot.  Chunks of stewed chicken with tomatoes, onions and cilantro on two corn tortillas and with strips of jalapenos on the side....so good!  I must have drank about 30-40 ounces of water because of the spicy but it really was amazing.\n\nOther things I was tempted by:\nTortilla Soup\nChurros\n\nI'll definitely be going back to Don Pistos to check these (and other menu items) out.", "author": "Melanie N."}

Well considering its Saturday no big deal. Come back an hour later and me and my buddy are seated at what turns out to be a communal table. Not horrible given that the restaurant was so loud that it was impossible to hear what the people next to us were talking about. On to the food, Diablo shrimp arrived, and while extremely well grilled the \"Diablo sauce\" totally missed the mark, unremarkable and just not good. Next came carne asada tacos, not bad, but certainly not special, have had much better at no name places in the Mission. Next came the hamburguesa. Now this was really good. Worth the wait, excellent entree that was well executed. Finally, the pollo asado arrived, good but not spectacular. So of four dishes only one was really special. Added to that the restaurant is tiny and loud, I mean really loud. Basically you are dealing with a 20 to 30 something crowd that does not seem to mind the noise and sitting on top of one another. If you are looking for a quite evening out this is not the place. Not sure I would come back, especially on a weekend night.

It took about 30 minutes for us to get one, but once seated the food was a treat.\n For appetizers we had the special of the day: Ceviche, it was delicious, it was a mix of shrimp, calamari and octopus. I added a little bit of hot sauce to make it spicy, it tasted awesome. \nFor the main event we had a Hamburguesa, Yes! it is awesome, it is like a mind trick it smells like bacon, but tastes like beef....The only suggestion here would be to add some more condiments(besides palta), maybe mayonesa?\nWe also had Al pastor tacos, this is the one of the best tacos I have had here in SF. Pork was Yumm...\nService was also really good...our waitress was very attentive. When we asked her for the bill, she goes \" Oh! did you guys have enough food\" , ahhh, Yes we did!  \nOverall, an awesome experience.

Yes, this place is legit, my Mexican and Texan roots wholeheartedly approve.  We are Sunday regulars, taking advantage of $2 beers and $3 sangrias specials and ordering the steak torta, a slight off menu item that rocks. Whats not to love about refried beans and guacamole smoothered on a roasted bun with shredded steak topped with queso fresco. This is my fave sandwich of the moment. The chicken tostadas are also exemplary as was the mussels &chorizo. We enjoy sitting at the bar hanging out with nick, the bartender, cool cat who mix a good sangria and who also has an uncanny resemblance to Adam the man vs. food guy.

He told me last week he wanted to take me to this amazing Mexican restaurant in North Beach. I was thinking North Beach was mostly Italian so I was excited to try this new place! I was so happy we came here. The restaurant has amazing food and the owner is such a nice person. At first, I walked right past the restaurant because there was no outdoor sign for the restaurant name. The only way you can recognize the place is for the four or five bright red bulbs that hang under the outdoor awning. Inside, the place was packed for 9pm! Thankfully there was a small table in the back. The restaurant is not very big so it was crowded inside but warm and inviting as well. Our server was very nice and very fast service. We started off with warm tortilla chips and an amazing green verde salsa. I couldn't stop eating the chips and dip it was that good! For meal, my friend and I decided upon the red snapper fish tacos and homemade tortilla soup. Yummmmm! The food was delicious! It was my first time eating snapper and it did not disappoint. The soup had a little kick to it that cleared my sinuses and it was a huge bowl. (see picture). For drinks, I had to try their margarita. It is made differently than normal margaritas because instead of tequilla they use a triple distilled wine that is more potent then tequilla but tastes just like jose cuervo. It was so good but so deadly! Overall the prices were decent, the service was fast, and the owner is such a nice and friendly guy. On our way out the door, the owner gave us complimentary hot cinnamon doughnut holes to take home. They were delicious!!!! Thanks for the experience I will return again!", "author": "Lauren S."}

I would certainly not wait the 1-2 hours that they've quoted me at peak times, especially when people are taking their time with the bottomless mimosas on weekends. That being said, the food is very good. Ingredients are high quality, and portion size is perfect (you will not get a burrito the size of your head here). The salsa verde and homemade tortilla chips are excellent, and I could easily fill up on just those. I recommend the standard tacos over the tacos sonora--the cheesa and crema masked the deliciousness of the meats in these, and were much more filling. Carnitas gets my vote (and everyone I've dined with) for best meat. Guacamole is also outstanding. The margaritas are good, but not great, due to the agave wine substitution for tequila (they don't have a full liquor license).

Undeterred, we took the four top. I'm not sure why they didn't offer to join the unoccupied two top with us, but we took it nonetheless. We ordered our drinks, margaritas and sangria. The margaritas were citrusy and lacking any sweetness and the sangria was devoid of fruit. Luckily, we had an apple and orange in our bags to save the day from mediocre at best drinks.

Put our name on the list and Surprise! got a call from them only 30 minutes later ! this was a major plus.  We rushed over to dinner and the place had emptied out!.. mind it was close to 8 pm.. after we sat down, the place started to fill up again.  I guess they go through a couple sittings per night.  We were really happy we didn't have to wait another hour =)  the chips/salsa they gave were pretty good.  i like that the chips were hot and freshly fried. the salsa was a tad too spicy for me.  the guac was also spicy but tasted really fresh. we shared a bunch of stuff and i could only comment on what i tried.  the fish taco was pretty large piece of fish... but lacked flavor (i added some guac and it did improve the taste a bit! ) also for two tacos, it was quite expensive.  the pork chop was pretty good !  it had great taste and was very juicy and the portion size was good for sharing.  i opted for the lobster dinner because i thought it wasn't a bad deal .. for $36 you get a whole lobster, flour tortillas, beans and rice.  the lobster must have been poached in butter because it came out kind of oily and crispy, basically had the tail and two claws.. overall 4 big pieces of lobster meat! the flour tortillas were not soft but fried already.. kind of reminded me of chinese green onion pancake.  the rice and beans were standard.. for the price, i thought it was a good deal considering it IS lobster !  overall, the restaurant atmosphere is kind of loud/bar-like atmosphere a lot of shouting going on.  service is pretty good, they refilled our waters multiple times. =) their menu is kind of limited though only 4-5 choice of tacos, a few small plates and a few entrees   the price and limited selection 3 stars but taste of food i say is 3.5 stars.", "author": "Margie C."}

It was juicy, tender, well seasoned and melts in your mouth.  If I wasn't so full, I could have at least 2 more of those fish tacos.   I'll definitely be back for the super fresh ingredients and friendly service.", "author": "s l."}

The chips by itself were tasty but of course paired with the salsa was pure awesomeness. I may have eaten a whole huge bowl of chips and salsa by myself. I ordered the shrimp tacos which were delicious as well.  However, 2 of our friends who ordered bacon cheeseburgers were waiting for a long time. It was disappointing because a lot of us were nearly half way through our meal and they were still waiting. BUT the owner (I'm assuming) came out to let us know that the first batch of burgers were over-cooked and was working on a second batch for them, on the house. Very nice of him.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-21", "description": "I've been searching farther and wider for highly rated burgers and one of the hurdles is that so many of the highly rated burgers come from restaurants that are open only for dinner, damn that's such a pity.  But we work with what we got rather than 'fight City Hall' or climb the unclimbable hill.  So I just got in under the wire because lunch ends at 3:00 which is liberal by so many rigorously enforced rules of the 'in spots' which mostly don't stay 'in' for long because of attitudes like that.  Don Pisto's is on Union apt at Grant so depending on how you get here it's a hike up a hill.  So it's very much like a South of the border Cafe wit decor based on the bones of an old brick building with great use of color and simple furniture, lighting and a tiny kitchen.  I ordered the 'hamburgeisa' and shortly out came a white oval china platter with an open face burger on a beautiful grilled or toasted sour dough roll.  The meat was swathed in a delicious house made guacamole, and the platter was co-inhabited by a lime wedge, a couple pieces of radish and a fire roasted chile pepper.  My first bite was spiritual with the crunch of the roll, the shooting juices of perfectly cooked meat and the flavor of unseen bacon.  The meat was excellent quality and cooked to perfection, and that toasted bun may be the best I've ever tasted.  They don't serve fries, rings or other standard accompaniments, but they did offer some tasty chips and housemade Salsa.  After finishing I visited the rest room downstairs and ran across a large room with several huge 'family' tables and a prep kitchen with about half a dozen cooks furiously getting ready for the crush to come that evening.  This is a very cool place for a most unusual and extremely good burger.", "author": "Stu S."}

We got the Huevos Rancheros and the Mushroom & Serrano Chile Omelette, and neither of us could decide which we liked more.

Glad we got there early at 545 and missed the Friday evening rush.  When you order tacos, you get 2 and a radish.  If you have a big appetite, eat lots of chips, order the amazing tortilla soup, and possibly plan to get more than one round of tacos-- hopefully trading with other people at the table to try different kinds.  Shrimp tacos were also great.", "author": "Unoti L."}

We didn't have to wait too long for a table and the service was great. The guacamole is almost to die for. I'm normally not a big guacamole fan, but it was absolutely delicious. I ordered the carne asada tacos and though the servings are small, still worth every penny. The carne asada was perfect, it wasn't too dry and cooked medium rare (which is how I normally like it cooked).", "author": "Sabrina L."}

Ceviche of tombo tuna was about five man-sized bites, just not enough fish for $15 or so......most of the plate was taken up by the chips.  Tacos de carne asada equally tasty, not outrageous to die for or anything, enjoyable but overpriced.  This place is kind of good for the upscale-esque young gringo or gringa with disposable $$$ to spend, who really don't know Mexican food very well or care enough to find out.......  I mean it was a good meal and all, just not that complex or interesting enough to merit the price.  Kind of a Marina-like scene on a Saturday night, ie hardly any non-Anglos inside, mostly kind of a bland post-college crowd but cool enough decor, vibe etc.....  I hate to sound like a know-it-all, but I have spent enough time all over Mexico eating better or equally as  well for about a third of the price to rave about Don Pisto........good addition to the neighborhood though, and if the owner has found a low-cost way to make oodles of money serving good not great comida mexicana, more power to him!", "author": "Michael G."}

We came in a large party for bruch and probably ordered one of everything on the menu. EVERYTHING and EVERYONE was totally pleased.  Authentic mexican food done with class. The only problem was that one of our party ordered the chorizo & poached eggs and it took so long that our entire party was finished by the time he got his food. We asked a few times for the dish but was told that the chorizo needed to be seared twice or cooked longer, not sure what was going on but figured they forgot. Even after asking, it took way too long.  So if the chef is reading this, please start this dish early in the line or have the waiters warn the guest that the dish takes longer than normal. It was still worth 5 stars!", "author": "P G."}

I don't consider Taqueria San Jose #3 or another one on Columbus whose name escapes me right now as \"quality\" -oversalted meat, bad salsa, and so on. So when a Thrillist newsletter dropped into my inbox and announced that Dos Pistos was open for business, I was very, very curious. Last night I had a hankering for some Mexican deliciousness after a couple of beers at Church Key, and remembered that Dos Pistos was a block away _and_ open until 12:30 am - perfect. Melanie N. and I walked over and were promptly seated. Oh, did I mention that it's a sit-down type of Mexican place? And with a very nice ambiance too? The waiter offered us menus that featured tacos, tortas, ceviches, and a couple of bigger items. While we deliberated over which taco to get, they brought us chips with tomatillo salsa, and the salsa was phenomenal -spicy, yet flavorful, with perfect consistency. I honestly can't think of a place with a better green salsa. I chose carnitas tacos and Melanie got chicken ones. The order arrived pretty quickly, and after the first bite I decided that this place deserved 5 stars, because everything was great, and nothing was wrong (including the price). That's pretty much the end of the story. I'm happy to have Dos Pistos in the neighborhood and I wish them well.", "author": "Andrei Z."}

The only place to wait is a crowded area near the bar. After almost an hour, a couple of the very drunk bar customers left, and I attempted to sit in one of the vacated seats at the bar. The bartender asked me to leave because he claimed that the seats at the bar were for customers who planned to eat. Then he seated two young women who seemed to have come out of no where. These women certainly weren't in the crowded entryway full of those of us on the wait list for a table. The option of sitting at the bar to eat was never offered to us. We finally got a table, but at that point, when no server showed up, we decided to leave. The hostess asked us if there was a problem. I told her we were offended by the bartender turning us away and their \"system\" for seating, and her comment was, \"Well I got you a table didn't I?\" as if she had done us a grand favor rather than her job. It appears that this place is only for those who know the bartender or are willing to forgo hospitality.", "author": "Patricia H."}

The restaurant is so warm and friendly looking and sooooooooo San Francisco.  We love the North Beach area and this restaurant is in a perfect location (not right in the hub bub, but close enough to walk off a meal afterwards).  We immediately thought of a celebration we want to have there with good friends, who like us, just love Mexican food.  We were told the restaurant would not actually be opened until about mid-December, '09 as he wants to make it just what we're all looking for in a Mexican restaurant (like the idea that it adds variety to No. Beach as there aren't many Mexican restaurants in the area).
