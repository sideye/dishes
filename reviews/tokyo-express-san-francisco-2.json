I think the servers are Koreans at this Japanese fast food restaurant, they play Korean music in the background and they speak to each other in Korean. Happy hour prices makes me happy when I am hungry before class . The happy hour menu ranges from $3-$6ish, which is really cheap for what you get. Although it may not be the best sushi you ate, it's still pretty good for its price. There are so many choices to choose from, but I usually get the lemon basil chicken, Alaskan roll, and tempura veggie roll to balance out the portion of meat and veggie. \n\nService is extremely quick , it only takes like a couple of minutes once you settle down for a table. They also have a self serve variety of drinks -water, cold tea, and hot tea. You don't need to always ask the waiter/waitress for water , when you can get up to get it yourself ! \n\nIt's my favorite go to spot in the center of downtown whenever I want fast, affordable, and convenient Japanese food!", "author": "Judy M."}

It looks small from the outside, but the inside is spacious with about 20 tables.  Of course, most of the tables are small but about 3 to 5 are medium to large. \n\nIt's like everybody says, fast casual japanese.  You go all the way inside to the front of the counter past all the tables to the right & left of you, and you wait in line, place your order from the menu descriptions/pics near the counter.  CC is ok. There's usually a  weekday special for under $10 which includes a mini salad, mini soup, and the specified entree with steamed rice.  Or they also have a sushi daily lunch special for under $10 with mini salad & mini soup.  The cool water flavored with lemon or lime slices is free on the left hand side for you to get with one of the metal cups nearby.   There's also heated tea.  Once they give you a card with a number, you go to an empty table, put the card in the metal card holder so that the waitperson can spot you and give you your food.    Everything is carefully organized on every table as far as condiments and napkins are concerned.  You may want to go up to the left hand counter in front for a fork if you don't want to use chop sticks.  \n\nI had a pork tonkatsu wednesday special which was ok cooked and I also ordered a separate NY sushi roll  for $6.50 which was also well prepared.  The NY roll had the cooked shrimp tempura which made it crunchy but creamy with the avocado, cool with the cucumber, and tasty with the tobiko.  The only problem was they served me my salad & soup AFTER they served me the sushi & tonkatsu.  Like I said, it's not a really formal sit down restaurant.  It's a large mixture of express, casual, fast, and only a slightly formal format with a waitperson delivering your food.\n\nI have to say, be careful of coming during weekday lunch times!!  They're spacious but they're also very popular.  Either come early for lunch or late for lunch so that you (and your friends) will have an easier time to get an empty table and avoid long lines.\n\nI thought the portion size of food was on the light side, but at least the variety and affordability are present.  TExpress would not be the first place I'd go to next time if I'm nearby and want lunch, but it's certainly an option if you're stuck in the area and don't mind eating light.", "author": "Frugal C."}

Place looks like it could be on the edge of a health code violation, but it's so affordable! \n\nDuring Happy Hour, I got 5 rolls: 4 of the basic ones like spicy tuna, california,etc. And we got 1 \"fancy\" roll, I think the dragon? And our total was under $30. The rolls were good for the price - I was expecting it to taste all dry like the Trader Joe's to-go sushi, but it was muuuuuch better. \n\nIt's a good place to go if you have time to kill before a movie at the Metreon.

I've been eating at this location for 7 years off and on; I used to love ordering from here, and I hadn't ordered from them in a while, so I decided I'd order a seafood sobe soup for takeout. Whereas the soup I would previously get had at least one large, juicy shrimp, and a fair amount of veggies and radish, what I received today was nothing like I'd ordered from them before, and nothing like what I usually love about SF Tokyo Express. This soup was so sad, with 3 tiny, sad shrimp, and just a small smidgen of fish, and no veggies at all; just a few leaves of seaweed swimming forlornly in a sad little soup. Really disappointed.

My girl and I have been coming here for as long as we've known each other, just about 4 years, and every time we are always guessing which roll we like the best. After all those times, we have finally found the one roll that we now know is our go-to, the Asten Roll. Which is a basic veggie tempura roll in your traditional maki-style. But if you're not reading in between the lines, we have tried MANY of the rolls while on this journey to find the Asten Roll, and non of them seem to have a great flavor combo. Just like many \"roll\" sushi spots in the world, this place only comes thru with average quality. That's why the Asten roll is so good. It's not hard to mess up an easy veggie tempura roll. You must get the spicy mayo on the side as the most perfect dipping sauce for many of their dishes besides the rolls. \nBut the downside of this place is the quality of service they provide. To start you off, the order takers/cashiers are always so moody and feel as if you are not spending enough to feel like you deserve a happy-positive customer experience. Also, if you're going to have a sit down restaurant after ordering, make sure you do your job at clearing tables and keeping your eating area nice and clean. At least to the standards of a good enough clean where there isn't food and crap stuck on the tables and the plates are all fully cleared. Multiple times have we had to wave down the runners to clear our table after being at that table for a while, and it was as if no one had been sitting there for hours yet they still failed to clear and clean the table. The only thing that will let that slide in my book is if they are busy. But there has not been one day or night IN THE YEARS we have been coming here  where there's a line out the door and every table is filled. NEVER! \nBut hey, come here if you're wanting a basic sushi/Japanese food fix with complimentary kimchi, takuwan(Japanese pickled Daikon), cold tea and water, and hot tea.", "author": "Nick A."}

The menu over the till and on the wall was just as overwhelming.\n\nOnce I was able to get my bearings with the menu, I went with my litmus test of pork tonkatsu, tamago, and avocado roll. After placing the order, the cashier hands me a number, and I can get complimentary green tea and water before I go find a table for one. I sit at a table not too far from the till with other table that can seat one to two people comfortably. Over this group of tables is a large flat screen telly aka television showing K-Pop with the volume turned down.\n\nFood is cooked and prepared to order at Tokyo Express. My pork tonkatsu was brought to me first by a server, and I was surprised that my sushi order was not with it. About five or so minutes later, I see my sushi order yet the server took my number away prematurely. I had to flag him down and inform him that the sushi order on the tray was mine. (And I had my receipt to prove the sushi there was mine.)\n\nI am glad I finally got to try this branch of Tokyo Express. It is just as good as the other aforementioned locations I mentioned earlier. I will be back if I am not In the mood with the food places nearby. \n\nKampai! SYOY!", "author": "Chiara A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-07", "description": "Looking for a decent Japanese place for a quick lunch/dinner? This is the place.\n\n1) First Impression\nIt was Saturday, close to 8:30 PM after the Super Bowl City / NFL Experience.\nIt didn't seem dirty and had some nice decoration.\nThere was only 1 person in front of us in line and a lot of seats were open.\nThe menu was quite overwhelming at first because everything seemed $15+, but then I saw the Chicken Teriyaki for $9 and ordered that.\n\n\n2) Wait time\nReceiving our food for a party of 5 was quite fast and arrived within 10-15 minutes.\nThey give you a number and you are supposed to sit at a table and they will serve the food to you. However, you have to order up front at the counter first, so it's kinda like a fast-food restaurant styled place. The time went by faster because you can get your own water / tea near the counter and bring it to any table by yourself.\n\n3) The Food\nI actually did not have high expectations coming into this restaurant, but the food quality was actually better than I expected. Compared to every other restaurant, this place actually had the largest portion of Chicken Teriyaki I have encountered in a single order. However, keep in mind, this could be due to the fact that it's not really bento-styled and did not come with any rolls and tempura, but just Miso Soup, Salad, and 2 Slices of Oranges.\n\nThe Salad, in particular, I believe had a peanut sauce/dressing and was quite unique, but very good. There did not seem to be too much rice in comparison to the Teriyaki Chicken.\n\nKeep in Mind: \n*It may be due to the time, but this neighborhood is definitely not the best and I did not feel completely safe here.\n*The waitress/cashiers didn't seem to the friendliest but did come by a couple times to collect our dishes and such. While leaving, she was at the door and did not greet me until I thanked her and left.\n\n\n*Final Verdict*\nIf you're in the area and you're looking for some quick Japanese food, then this is where you should go. It wont amaze you, but it definitely will satisfy your craving for Japanese food. Even though I did not try the sushi, the Chicken Teriyaki was quite delicious.", "author": "Jeffy Y."}

There are many empty tables at this time of day. This restaurant can definitely accommodate a lot of people based on its size. As you walk past the tables that take on the arrangement of a \"food court\" vibe, you reach a counter where you can order your entree.\n\nThe woman, who I assume is also the manager, was actually not friendly at all. She lacked a smile and definitely looked like she did not want to be there. I ordered a Chicken Katsu with Curry, but she misheard me and charged me for a Chicken Katsu. When I corrected her, she wasn't apologetic about the mistake, but just waited for me to pay the extra fee for curry. She also threw the table number card at me in a very unprofessional, uncaring way and she pretty much set the low standards of customer service at Tokyo Express.\n\nHowever, what changed my mind from rating this restaurant a 2-star to a 4-star was the kind gentleman serving our entrees. He was very kind and hard-working. Props to him for smiling throughout his shift and not looking like he hated working there like his boss!\n\nAs for the quality of the food, I really enjoyed my Chicken Katsu to be honest. It was much better than your average Chicken Katsu for two reasons - tender chicken meat and fried to a perfect degree. The katsu was not dry or dough-y like other katsu entrees I've tried. $3.00 for a bowl of curry is a bit steep of a price in my opinion and I kind of wish I didn't order the curry - there was nothing special about it. They have plenty of sauces on the sides of each table to use, ranging from Tonkatsu sauce to Sririacha to Soy Sauce and more. As for my friend's entree, I tried his Chicken Teriyaki dish and wasn't impressed at all. In fact, I was a bit disappointed. The chicken was much tougher and drier than the chicken in my dish and left an unsatisfying feeling in my stomach.\n\nIf you're looking for quickly served food, this is definitely your pitstop.

Did I mention that I usually spend less than $9 for more food than I can eat in one meal? :) A few of my favorites are:\n\n- Vegetable udon soup (substitute soba noodles) meal which comes with a salad\n- Salmon teriyaki meal, comes with rice, salad, and miso soup\n- Tempura udon soup (substitute soba noodles), the tempura dipping sauce is SO good and the tempura is served in a separate container so it doesn't get soggy\n\nThey also have happy hour from 3:30 to 5:30 pm that includes edamame for about $2, seaweed salad for around $3, cheap hand rolls, and more!\n\nI think I might be Tokyo Express's most frequent customer but I'm okay with that! I'm proud to say that I've gotten a lot of my colleagues hooked too and most of the employees now know my name!", "author": "Meghan P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-08", "description": "This is sort of like MdDonald's meets Safeway Sushi. \n\nTokyo Express benefits from a good location, on busy Mission between 4th and 5th, across from the large SF City lot at 5th and Mission, near the Moscone Convention center, near the Marriott, a block form the Westfield Mall, etc. There are tons of other choices for food within 2 blocks of here, but not much in Japanese choices, unless you include the Vietnamese Pho place across the street (Green Papaya) that pushes sushi too, with a corner sidewalk sign and LED lights flashing \"Sushi\". \n\nThere is no sushi bar, sushi chef, or real sushi here. So don't come here expecting , well, er... Sushi!  If you like Yada Yada Whateva Rolls, which is anything slightly familiar to a Californian, be it avocado, Mexican spices, Jack-in-the-box secret sauce, Thousand Island dressing, mayonnaise, all with a little rice ball, etc. you might be ok. \n\nWhich reminds me of my parents. My Dad was Swedish descent, and liked butter and soy sauce combined in his rice bowl, for flavor, to make it edible. He was ahead of his time in the Yada Yada Whateva roll design contest! My mother, being Japanese, raised in a sushi restaurant business, would abhor the sight of this abomination of a Japanese staple. It would be like putting Wasabi and Ginger in your home made Mash potatoes. Wait! I think we have something here!  The makings of a new Yada Yada Whateva roll! The Idaho Roll! A double Carb delight! \nPut some butter AND soy sauce on that puppy! \n\nWhich brings me back here. Like I said, this is like Burger King meets Japanese diner. Except all the people working here are any Asian ethnicity except Japanese: perhaps Malay, Indonesian, Chinese, not sure what. And in the kitchen, like in 50% of all restaurant kitchens, the cook staff could do Mariachi gigs on the weekends. \n\nNothing against this ethnic variety, in fact I like ethnic variety, but not so much with a particular ethnic food that none of these ethnicities were raised on. it just is what it is. \n\nI think someone should open a Mexican Fusion restaurant, instead of an Asian fusion restaurant with Mexican flavors, don't you? How about Mexican Fusion with French, instead of Asian Fusion with French? I mean that has been done a thousand times. How come only the Off the Grid food trucks combine other cuisines into tacos and burritos? Time to upscale Mexican food in creative ways. Start with Mole sauce. \n\nThey actually have a pretty broad menu of Japanese diner like foods, such as Donburi, Udon noodles, etc. You order from the menu on the wall above the counter, pay, and get a number tag to put on your table for someone to bring out to you your order. Or you just order to go, which adds a lot of volume at lunch time I am sure. \n\nMost of the people who actually sit down and eat in here are foreign tourists, Aussies, Brits, a host of other countries, and the American out of towner. They are staying at a nearby hotel and want something cheaper, after paying $30 for breakfast in their hotel. So they come here, because they don't know about Yelp yet, or don't have enough Cab Fare. (Actually, there is a dearth of good Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, sad face.)\n\nIf you are a local, you come here out of convenience, to get a representative sampling of Japanese flavors, prepared by Latinos, and served by Southeast Asians. \n\nWell they're Asians working here, right?

The sushi had a crispy outside which was kind of nice  but the fish they used was not quite fresh. Despite that shortcoming, the roll still tasted decent. They also give you small dishes of kimchee for free. I didn't try it because I don't eat kimchee. \n\nMy friend liked her soft shell crab hand roll and she said her maguro sashimi tasted fresh.

The location of the restaurant was good, a relatively short walk from Powell Station/Union Square. The atmosphere was casual, but nicer than fast food. I ordered the soft shell crab appetizer and the chirashi, both were quite good. The quality of the food wasn't amazing or anything, but nice for the price! I thought the soft shell crab had a bit too much breading, but the crab tasted fresh and flavorful so I didn't mind. The chirashi came with a good variety of fish, massago, seaweed salad, miso soup, and a light side salad. It had everything and just what I wanted. The restaurant even offers free water, iced/hot tea, and kimchi. What a great deal!  I enjoyed my meal here.

My recent visit here has made me realize that you unfortunately have fallen into the depths of mediocrity.\n\nFirst off, the primary draw of this place was its inexpensive pricing with decent food. Especially around the touristy area that is Union Square, cheap and yummy food is hard to come by. As a result, I was sad to see that the prices have increased and the portions seem to have also shrunk. It's hard for me to justify paying $10+ for what can be considered a quick snack at best. There weren't any issues with the quality of the sushi, but the overall portion size was far too small. \n\nI'm not sure if I never noticed this before or if the situation has declined, but I recently found the interior to be very dingy. The lights are very dim which makes the restaurant seem a lot dirtier than it probably is. While there, I kept feeling like the restaurant wasn't very well kept. As a huge germaphobe, the especially dim atmosphere made me want to get out of there asap.\n\nI miss the old Tokyo Express that provided great value for their food and an enjoyable dining experience.

Tokyo Express is a great option for a quick meal and some good food. So, since I found this place my perception of fast food completely changed (for good). \n\nFor the price, you wouldn't think you would be eating anything of quality, but I haven't been disappointed yet. Food is good, seafood is fresh.They menu offers a wide variety of sushi and Japanese dishes. Since you have to order at the cash register and you don't exactly interact with servers, it is hard to rate their service, however, so far so good. food comes out super quick.\n\nTheir happy hour is great, you can get a roll for as low as $3.00. I often eat from their daily combos (two rolls or sachimi and a roll). All combos come with miso soup and salad.", "author": "Elizabeth D."}

This certification goes beyond basic Food & Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, which exhibits Tokyo Express's commitment to safety, wholesomeness, economic integrity, and quality in the foods they serve.\n\nThe USDC Grade-A fish served at Tokyo Express are caught by individual handline and are killed using the \"Ike Jime\" method, which causes blood contained in the fish flesh to retract to the gut cavity and produces a better colored and flavored fillet. It is also a faster and more humane method of killing fish.", "author": "Johnny C."}

There is a menu right when you walk in but as you go deeper into the restaurant where the cashier and waiters are there is a better menu that consists of pictures. What you do is order your food either for to go or for there, when it's to go you have chairs to sit on as you wait for your food whereas when you eat for there you have a number to place at your table and the waiters will give you your food. However, the service here is quick and all the sauces you need is right next to you on the table. \n\nThe first roll me and my bf ordered was the devil's roll which has spicy salmon and avocado topped with mango. This was delicious because it was sweet and spicy at the same time and when you dip it with soy sauce it gives a kick of salty flavor along with it. Another roll that we ordered was flying kamikaze which has spicy tuna, tempura asparagus, and albacore tuna. I found this roll to be average but the least one we liked from the other roll because we felt like the tuna wasn't fresh and that it was out for awhile because it tasted pretty warm and sashimi warm isn't good, I will tell you that. \n\nI would only recommend this place cause its cheap and has fast service, so if you're around this area and crave for sushi you should stop by here and experience it.", "author": "Victoria G."}

As I had hoped it wasn't very busy.  I came in and ordered the Salmon Teriyaki (to go) which came with a small salad and miso soup (a very pleasant surprise; It was probably written somewhere and like a moron I didnt read it).\n\nI got to where I was going, situated myself, and started with the miso soup.  It was great, and with my travels it was the perfect temperature.\n\nNext I ate the salad.  The salad was very good, my only complaint was that they could have used a lot less dressing.  After I finished there was still a good 3/4 - 1 ounce of dressing leftover.  That said, it was still very delicious.\n\nFinally, the Salmon Teriyaki.  There was about 8oz's worth of salmon in 4 pieces laid on a small bed of cabbage and a generous amount of teriyaki sauce.  Of the 4 pieces, 3 were overcooked and a little leathery but otherwise tasted great (I still ate the salmon.  I'm not a fussy eater, this is just an observation).  \n\nThe rice was normal.  I was hungry so would have liked more, but not a problem.\n\nBefore I forget, they gave two orange slices with the meal.  I know this sounds weird but those were really really good orange slices.  I'd like to know where they get their oranges from.\n\nOverall a decent experience, I probably wouldn't come back for the food again (Nothing amazing about it), but it was definitely worth what I paid and experiences.  I will have to come back and try out their sushi though.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Vasken O."}

I was quite impressed with the interior... anyways... we ordered food right away and it was a good price! I got a huge portion of chicken teriyaki chicken don over rice ($7.17 including tax, salad, and miso soup) and my friend ordered tempura udon ($7.17 with tax). My sister got two rolls for $13! It was a REALLY good deal for two rolls and she was quite impressed. However another friend's portion (salmon roll) seemed very small. It was quick order and the orders came out within 3-5 minutes we ordered! PRAISE THE LORD.\n\nI would rate the teriyaki chicken a 3.5/5 -- the serving size was huge and the rice was perfectly cooked, but the sauce was a little watery and not as thick as I had wished it would be. The complementary greens were perfect and fresh! However the salad's sauce (complementary) was too empowering and gave off a bit bitter taste.\nI also had part of the udon bowl and I would rate it 3/5. The udon was cooked perfectly, however the tempura was REALLY oily and greasy and after having one broccoli I had to stop.\n\nOverall: If you want a quick order but really good place with portions and pretty decent quality food, this is the place to go. But if you want really really quality food and you're picky with the freshness and the sauces, this would still be a pretty decent place to go to.", "author": "Sonia L."}

If you are in dire need of Japanese food, and don't want to head over to the Ferry Building, I guess you can stop here. \n\nFood: The food is sub-par.  All of the \"teriyaki\" foods are too sweet and artificial.  YUCK! I had the salmon terikayi here one time, HUGE mistake.  It was dry, over sweet, and tasted like plastic.  The seaweed salad is also very artificial tasting, which left a bad taste in my mouth.  I've eaten here twice (when I first started working in SF), but have not been back since (finding my fave spot Delica, in the Ferry Building).  \n\nAmbiance/Service: The place is rather small, serve your own tea, and grab your own table.  You order and pay at the cash register, and then they bring you your food.  The service is relatively quick (I guess..), but if you need something while you're eating, no one is around to help you.. you have to walk back up to the register to ask.  Kind of frustrating.  \n\nOverall, I would skip it and head over to Delica.  Better selection and definitely better quality! Plus! Its close by :)", "author": "Ashley M."}

It looked legit.\n\nI ordered the Teriyaki Salmon bento for $8. Comes with miso soup and salad. Water and hot tea is complementary. You can add a side of tempura to your meal for an extra $1.15. I passed on it cause I was strapped for cash. The food was alright and tasted pretty legit, not American style Japanese food. But it wasn't the best Japanese food I've had.\n\nThe place wasn't too busy which was fine for me. The staff was very friendly. Anime music is blasting in this establishment.

The service from the girl that works here was absolutely terrible!!\n\nThe guy behind the register was super nice but like I said, the chic working behind the counter was just plain RUDE.  I came here on my lunch break with a coworker and we decided to dine in.  When my order came, the chic sloppily set my plate in front of me.  I don't know what was up with her nasty attitude but she needs to leave it at home. Maybe she was having a bad day but I brushed it off not thinking much about it.  As I picked up a sushi off from my plate there was a piece of HAIR under that piece of sushi. Yes, a piece of hair.  It was sitting under two pieces of sushi.  Mind you, these things don't bother me too much but it was due to their SERVICE that really made me sick to my stomach.  I hate making a big fuss over these things so my coworker decided to bring it to them and show them the hair.  Literally less than a MINUTE passed by and they hand me back my plate, the hair was GONE, and they added two extra drops of wasabi in the area the hair was on. REALLY? that is disgusting..I was so shocked that I just stared at my plate for 5 minutes before we flagged down the worker and asked if all they did was remove the hair and out more wasabi.  So the second time I was watching from my table as the chic REARRANGES  the position of the sushi pieces and gives it back to the waiter guy to give back to me.\n\nThis is absolutely unacceptable. Yea you've probably figured out which customers we are, but you know what? If you could have been at least apologetic about the situation and just provided better service then I wouldnt be writing this review.  Do you really think your customers want to eat food with hair in their dishes? Im just so shocked by the service..ESP from that angry asian chic working there on Saturday, FEB 25. between 5-6pm. yea now u can narrow it down to which worker it was cus she was disgusting", "author": "Elizabeth K."}

The California rolls didn't have a lot of filling. The nigiri was fine.\n\nHeaven Roll (Salmon with Scallion, Spicy Tuna on Top) & Crunch Cal Roll\n$8.99\nThe spicy tuna was pretty spicy for someone who doesn't eat much spicy food. It over powered the salmon sadly. The whole look of the roll could have used more work - spicy tuna on top just makes the roll look like a mini massacre. The crunch California roll lacked enough crunch. The tempura coating was spotty, so it felt more like eating pieces of California roll that accidentally fell into the leftover crumbles of a tempura side dish.\n\nThe order also came with miso soup and salad, which made the meal well rounded. I could have used less dressing on my salad.\n\nAMBIANCE: The place looks like a modern fast food joint in Hong Kong or any other Asian metropolis. It's conveniently located near the Metreon and Westfield Mall.\n\nSERVICE: Service was good. They are very fast at getting take-out ready. They took about 10 minutes to finish up someone else's big take-out order and mine.

For a fast food place located right by Moscone Center, I would have expected either higher prices, smaller portions, or lower food quality.  I don't know how they manage to serve their customers double-sized portions at such reasonable prices.  This has become my go-to lunch spot whenever I attend events at Moscone.\n\nIf you don't want rice, just say so and they will ask if you want a second bowl of soup or salad in its place.  Then the chicken/fish/etc. is enough for two people, so all together, you end up with an inexpensive meal for two people.  On top of that, each day they offer specials on select menu items.  You could actually get a fast, good Japanese lunch for two people for less than you'd pay at McD's/BK/etc.  Amazing.\n\nI have never tried the sushi, sashimi, or udon, but have gotten the Lemon Basil Chicken, Salmon Teriyaki, Calamari Tempura, Chicken Donburi, Tonkatsu, Chicken Katsu, usually with the Tempura add-on.  I think the best of those entrees is the salmon.  Note that they pour a lot of sauce on the Lemon Basil Chicken and Salmon Teriyaki, so I keep meaning to (but forgetting to) ask for it to be served on the side.  Their tempura is the real thing, not the corn-dog-shaped plaster-battered whatnot that the Sakura fast food joints try to pass off as tempura.\n\nAdded later:  They now have a happy hour menu every single day of the week from 3pm to 6pm.  This is a great chance to try small, appetizer-sized plates:  Lemon Basil Chicken $3, Calamari Rings $3, Seaweed Salad $2.50, Shishamo $3 (three small smelt fish, grilled), Hamachi Kama $5.50 (grilled hamachi collar?) and many more.

What a deal!", "author": "Brian M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-21", "description": "Tokyo Express - You get the Express but there's nothing Tokyo about it.\n\nIt's a clean establishment with efficient and friendly service, but if you're looking for good Japanese food go elsewhere. \n\nThe sushi rolls are super-Americanized (think sauce and fried) and the dishes are far from what you'd expect in Tokyo. For example, I ordered the katsudon. While yes, technically this was a katsu-don (tonkatsu donburi) with slices of tonkatsu on rice, that's not what the katsudon dish should be. What I got: bowl of rice with steamed vegetables, fried egg, and fried breaded pork cutlet. What I expected: well, just Google it.\n\nI almost always order tempura at a Japanese restaurant. It's a dish that's fairly simple in concept but that I believe is difficult to execute well. The Tokyo Express version was heavy on the batter (volume and texture), and lacked the light tempura fry that I prefer. I know some people prefer it that way, but that's just not my preference.\n\nAnyway, 2 stars for serving OK food in a clean and friendly environment. But again, don't go for the Tokyo, go for the Express.", "author": "T N."}

The potato had an odd consistency.  Overall fine, but not inspiring.\n\nUdon: Iffy at best - the noodles are fine but the broth turns me completely off.\n\nChicken tonkatsu:  Whenever I order this about half of it is delicious and on the other half the meat is a little strange.\n\nEdemame: Delicious and salty.  They must cook this in salt water, because it has the perfect salty taste without any salt on the outside of the beans.  (Unfortunately, some of their beans look a little old on occasion...)\n\nService: Alright, but don't bother making special orders because they don't appear to pay attention to them.", "author": "Emily L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-20", "description": "I think Tokyo Express works out to something like 3.6 stars. Here's be breakdown.\n\nService: It's nice, but there's not much to begin with. Walk up to the counter to order, pour your own tea. Waiter brings you your order (using the number flags) and additional plates, that sort of stuff. Nothing too fancy or terrible here.\n\nAmbiance: Very modern, but it feels very unauthentic. Really, it just looks modern; like a restaurant in a MOMA or something.\n\nFood: Here we go, the important part. I'm pretty darn sure this place is a Korean-operated restaurant (well, the sushi chefs were speaking Korean), and the sushi reflects that. More sauce than usual, sweeter tastes. Not a bad thing if you like that stuff (which I do), but if you're a sushi purist, this might not be the place for you (I'm speaking of the makis, btw). All the rolls were decent, fish wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either. Portions were average-sized. The prices are very reasonable if you know what to order - fairly fancy rolls like the NY, Tokyo Tower, or Rock N' Roll for around $5-6. If you're looking for stuff like Dragon, the price ups to about $10. Barley tea. No free miso soup if you're getting makis (darn).\n\nTheir unagi don was $9, which is fairly reasonable, though I didn't try that. Chriashi ran for ~$15.\n\nA good place to swing by if you're in the mood for some sushi (with a sweeter, more teriyaki-er tone). I'd swing by if I was in the area, and felt up for some sushi.\n\nTheir website has the menu, and prices. Nice touch.\n\nYeah, 3.6 is about right.", "author": "Jeffrey L."}

So much so that I'm actually spending time to write a review about it.\n\nThe sushi is really good and the fish is fresh. They were accomodating with my special requests, they were SUPER fast (in and out in 10 minutes) and the price honestly can't be beat- the perfect trifecta when it comes to take out!\n\nHUGE selection of regular rolls (including lots of veggie options), and they also have sashimi, sushi and handrolls. Try the double salmon, SO good. They also have bento boxes (lemon basil chicken was delicious) as well as donburi and udon. The menu is almost overwhelming at times because of all the options, even when I'm getting sushi. \n\nMy only complaint is that the restaurant's decor reminds me of a food court at a crappy mall - bland, not stylish, with a few generic bamboo plants for the \"asian\" vibe - ugh.

It was pretty empty, but the location is downtown and it was right when people are getting off of work. I saw these samples out on the counter (in the heat) and got a bit worried. But my order was made when I placed my order and the ingredients were really fresh. I appreciated that they didn't use \"american\" ingredients in their futomaki.
