For some reason, the door in the front facing the main mission street is locked, with no signs--it looks more like a backdoor. You have to enter through the door in the side-alley way in the back, which, also has no sign. You would only know if you were looking for bouncers there at night.\n\nInside, there are lots of weird lights, paintings on the walls, and artifacts laying around. Especially the restroom doors which had floor-to-ceiling paintings on the doors. The drinks menu also has pretty cool names for drinks.\n\nThe staff is friendly, and helpful in explaining drink options. There are plenty of tables inside, so it's not hard to find a table. The drinks are reasonably priced.\n\nOverall, a good place to hang out and grab a beer, or a weird drink.", "author": "Henry L."}

We came around 10:20pm and there was no line. it wasn't really crowded inside either. he told me there are two parts to this bar. the right side is the bigger side with tables/booths and the main bar. the left side is the cooler side where you tell the bartender what type of drinking you want and he'll make it for you. i.e. you tell the bartender you want bacon and he'll make a drink as close to bacon as possible. if you look at the bar, you'll notice spices and other food seasoning you add to food LOL.\n\nso of course, we went to the left side. it's cash only and we didn't bring a lot of cash so we only ordered one drink each. my friend told the bartender he wanted something light and refreshing. the bartender added a bunch of drinks into his drink. we both tried his drink and it was indeed light and refreshing. i told the bartender i wanted something berry flavored and he made me something berry flavored. the bartender said that these drinks are never duplicated and just made on the spot.\n\noverall, i had a good experience. it wasn't too loud or crowded in this bar. the interior decor is really interesting. you can take photos with their photo booth and post your photos on their FB and IG, i think. the restrooms are interesting. one stall is a full restroom while the other stall is a half restroom. they have sinks outside the restrooms too. but there are no mirrors inside the stalls. it's a nice spot to come with a few friends. i'll be more daring and order something out of the ordinary the next time i come here!", "author": "Sylvia H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-30", "description": "Oddjob has two parts to it - when you walk in, there's the main bar area to your right, as well as an intimate nook called SRO to your left. As for the main bar area, it's decent enough, with a decent menu of cocktails that are just a tad on the spendy side. An average 3-star review if there was one.\n\nThe SRO area, however, is quite the gem. The bartenders there craft customized drinks based on your mood or your specific instructions, and they can be quite elaborate drinks at that. No two drinks (at least during one visit) are the same. I observed the bartender craft an especially elaborate drink that first looked like it involved a bong, only to involve a second firey stage that had quite smokey results as far as the drink was concerned. In my case, I'm all for sweet, desserty, chi-chi cocktails, and I was pleasantly satisfied with my Thai-inspired drink, with an ever-so-slight spicy kick to it.\n\nEspecially given that the drinks on the SRO side aren't that much more expensive than at the main bar, it's to your advantage to get drinks at SRO, which is standing-room only, and then take them over to the main room where there is more seating. 3 stars for the main bar and 5 stars for SRO means a 4 star average in my book.", "author": "Vincent L."}

I've procrastinated for two years to come here, and I finally had a chance one early evening while waiting for my boyfriend to finish his workout. My first mistake was turning right when entering Oddjob, instead of left. I was intimidated that no one was in the SRO room, which later I realized from their website that this is where I wanted to go all these years.\n\nI had a seat at the main bar and admired the peculiar (odd) decor. I noted that this would be great for private events. The dim lighting took awhile to adjust to, and it was a little off-putting. I met up with a friend, and we ordered off their constantly rotating cocktail menu. I got a whisky based one, and it was excellent! Perfectly strong and flavorful. This whole time, I didn't know how to ask the bartender about crafting a drink to my mood. (Again, I should have sat down in the OTHER room.)\n\nI also realized that MOST bartenders (some are terrible at this) will make you any cocktail you're in the mood for. Not quite sure what makes Oddjob special in this regard, but maybe I'm just coming up with excuses to cover up for my mistakes. I'm sure Joey is talented!

Skip the formalities of a wedding/typical sit down dinner and get the party started right away. Having strong, delicious, and well crafted cocktails was important to me while music and dancing was her priority. Oddjob was the perfect venue for this. \n\nVenue: \nThe space itself was intimate, but big enough to host up to 125 people comfortably. Everyone had enough elbow room to drink, dance, and be married (get it?). The design and layout of Oddjob was quirky and beautiful enough such that we did not have to do anything to decorate the place besides a few personal touches which went along the theme of our celebration.\n\nDrinks: \nThe bar was fully stocked with top quality spirits, liqueur, beer, wine, and whatever you need to get your fix. They even make their own bitters and other concoctions used to make you a drink. My wife's go-to was a purple cocktail (I believe it was called Neptune?) while Joey whipped up an amazing Negroni (w/ barrel aged gin) for me all night. When I wanted to switch things up, I ordered from his amazing selection of beer and spirits! Joey was even kind enough to pour a couple fingers of a 22 year old scotch for me to celebrate my big day. It goes without saying that all of my guests enjoyed the open bar. \n\nStanding Room Only: \nNot only does this place serve great cocktails off their menu, they also have a small standing room only section that only fits 10-12 people where the mixologist (not bartender) will cook up the most delicious drink. Tell him/her what you like, perhaps an idea, or tell them about a dream you had and the mixologist will make you a bespoke cocktail that will make you want to celebrate your wedding there as well! \n\nStaff: \nFrom start to finish, Joey was a consummate professional. Not only is he a skilled bartender/mixologist, but he is also a wonderful bar manager and person. He and his staff went above and beyond to make sure that everything went smoothly. The only thing I had to worry about when I got there was how much fun I was going to have. \n\nI plan on coming back as many times as I can.

Speaking solely on the bartenders at the larger bar (I've never been to the more intimate bar located to the left of the entrance): they have a \"too cool for school\" attitude, it always takes about 5-10 minutes to even be acknowledged by a bartender at a relatively empty bar. The women behind the bar look at me, walk away, and continue to huddle in the corner and speak to each other rather than the costumers - this has happened to me multiple times.\n\nThere are so many other bars in SF with tasty cocktails that are created by bartenders who are happy to serve you.

I have lived here long enough to experience several painful and fruitful evolutions of this city. I have witnessed the steady river of people (by which I arrived, too), money tides that ebb and flow, the destruction and resurrection of districts. Hopeful youths saunter in and are spit out grisly shadows. I have lived here long enough to hate every neighborhood, and fallen in love again, to have tired of my old queer haunts only to mourn the closing of their doors. I am guilty of being the hypocritical, quintessential hipster-denier that feeds off newness but despises anyone encroaching on my \"discovery\". I thought I was jaded beyond repair, consumed by keeping both hands in the past that I may have failed to be fully in the present. All while keeping a bloodshot eye on the speckled horizon I mistook for the future. \n\nYou: Seriously, when is she going to talk about Oddjob? Enough of this rambling, clearly she's lost it.\n\nMe: Ok, ok. Oddjob is a place that soothes my spastic soul. It offers an intimate refuge tucked away in plain sight. The first time my husband (we're newly weds and we're queer, so read that with a little bit of a \"succumbed to the heteronormative patriarchy woe is me\" tone) and I went to Oddjob, it made me so happy. Cautiously happy, but happy. Dark, but not too dark. Varied music. Enthusiastic, but tempered menu. The first drink I ordered was The Whim - the bartender asked me what I liked, I said I couldn't decide between rum or tequila, he said \"let's do both\". I raised an eyebrow, well, both because I'm not so good at the cockeyed one eyebrow lift. It was something like a dark rum, a tequila, possibly blanco, chamomile something, tobacco something, lemon lemon, and garnished with something. It was amazing. Never had anything like it. Best cocktail of my life, for one night only. \n\nCome here for a casual drink, a creative drink, solo, in a group, as a couple. Come here for a post-work, I need bourbon on the rocks now. Come here to celebrate, to brood, to unwind. The bartenders are always kind, the menu is always interesting, and the crowd is never the same. I have come here dressed up, dressed down and never felt out of place. Oddjob is accepting without trying to convince you that it is ok to be yourself. \n\nMost recently, my husband and I had our post-wedding party here. I guess that is called a reception. Heather was our point person and she nailed it. The whole team was incredible, we got great DJs that we had heard there before, the bartenders were attentive and friendly, and we had so much fun. If you need catering or some light snacks, you can order through their sister restaurant. We had such a good time here with all our friends, I would throw another party just for fun. SF and its inhabitants never cease to surprise me. Thanks, Oddjob for existing and excelling.", "author": "Rikki W."}

They also have a small yet wonderful beer selection. We mentioned a fernet cocktail that we had in Portland to our bartender and he put one together that blew my mind. Oddjob reminds me of a bourbon and branch, minus the pretentiousness and hype. A wonderful IPA will set you back about $6 and a cocktail $14.

I don't think I saw a single glass repeated in my group that night, and between us we got maybe 9 or 10 drinks.\n\nBe patient though - it's a pretty long wait to get your drink: there's one bartender serving a room full of eager customers. But it's only because he puts so much perfection into each drink. He's also really good at keeping track of who's been waiting the longest, so no need to jostle your way to the bar.\n\nThe bartender seemed to be friends with several customers, too. That, or he is just extra good with making friends! We caught him doing fun dance moves several times, and we made friends at the bar as well - everyone's just chill and in a good mood here.\n\nAt 8:15pm, the front room was very crowded. The back room (much smaller) had 10 or so people around the bar, and the small tables against the wall were empty so my group claimed them. We stayed until about 10:30pm - by then the front room was completely empty and the crowd had swelled and died to about 6-8 people in the back room.\n\nKeep in mind the drinks are costly! $16 a pop, and cash only.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

One of my drinks had a chantrelle mushroom-infused rye whiskey (along with a whole list of other ingredients that I can't remember now); another friend of ours had some tea-infused vodka, and so on.\n\n$16 a drink is a bit pricey, but this place feels more like an \"experience\" and it's definitely worth the trip. Joey is quite an entertainer, as well... how often do you go to a bar and here lots of random chantings of people's names?

In one week, I visited twice, and I had a similar experience both times. In summary? Great drinks, great ambience, great customers, strange staff.\n\nMy first stop was with coworkers after a very long Wednesday. We stopped in around 10:30 and ordered a round. The bartender was very talkative and took his time with the drinks. At last call (which was given at 11:30), three of us decided to stick around. The bartender cashed several customers out before making our drinks, so it was about 20min before we had beverages in hand. Around midnight, he came over and gave us free \"shots\" (which were generous 2oz+ concoctions of rye, ginger beer, and perhaps other things). Sadly, at 12:09, all of the lights came on and the bouncer started yelling for everyone to go home. I let him know we had just been given shots from the bartender, and I was told, \"Well, talk to him, then.\" I had to finish both my drinks in ten minutes (my friends did not, leaving their free shot behind).\n\nDespite the fact that my friend had a similar experience the following Friday (being shoved out at closing time), we decided to spend our Halloween here, making sure to leave well before closing. Most of the night was spectacular - every other guest was interesting, fun, and well-behaved. The decor was fabulous. The drinks were just as tasty. But upon ordering my second drink (read: sober), I told the bartender I had a tab open and he said, \"Good for you.\" As a previous bartender, I responded, \"Just tryin' to help, man.\" \"What can I get for you?\" I ordered a $10 vodka soda and got charged for a $15 on my final tab.\n\nSo, overall - this place just needs a few staff meetings and it might be perfect. Or maybe the snark is a San Francisco thing that this Chicagoan just doesn't understand.", "author": "Cassidy S."}

I spent my whole time at the \"Plus Plus\" bar side and had a couple of the best cocktails I've ever tried. I loved Big before it closed and these are the same owners so no wonder the drinks and bartending are so perfect. \n\nThe bartender for Plus Plus, Joey, is so personable and remembered my name for the whole night (I'll be impressed if he still know it when I come back to visit). My first drink had mint and ginger per my preferences and my second drink was a bit crazier with lot of rosemary and egg whites (both had gin). The drinks were $12 each (less than Big's pricing I think) and so worth it. \n\nEven the bathrooms are cool - 4 single toilet rooms for anyone to use and a beautiful communal sink.

They really do a good job with novelty - I don't think there was a single cocktail that didn't have at least one ingredient I'd never heard of. The flavors of these cocktails were all good, although I didn't find any that I loved. I hear the menu also rotates occasionally, so I don't expect to run out of things to try anytime soon.\n\nThings get really interesting, though, at the second bar. It's in a back room, has just a single bartender, and the wait for a drink here can get a bit ridiculous. I walked up to the bar just as the bartender had started serving a group of people. He noticed me waiting, and told me to just come back in 15 minutes. True to form, I went back to sit with my friends, then returned 15 minutes later. He recognized me and bumped me right to the front of the line. Great service!\n\nSo what's special about this second bar? To start, it's cash only and all drinks are $16 - expensive! But the guy working there is a cocktail savant. They've provided him with every liquor, mixer, and spice imaginable, and he'll make you anything you can dream up.\n\nHere are three examples:\n(1) I asked for something combining \"whiskey and citrus\". He gave me a drink with those two flavors, as well as an earthy flavor. It was quite good, and next time I'd like to try getting more specific and ask for whiskey, citrus, and floral\n(2) My partner asked for \"whiskey and very spicy\". He made her a drink that tasted like whiskey and pineapple, with a brutal burn at the end from chili powder. She loved it!\n(3) My friend, deciding to see how far he could push the envelope, asked for \"blue Kool-Aid\". He got it! The bartender mixed blueberry vodka, essence of lavender, and some other stuff, and boom, we had an alcoholic blue Kool-Aid. It was like magic.\n\nThis bar is pricey, but it's an ideal place to experiment and introduce your tastebuds to something new. As a bonus, on a Friday night, the main bar wasn't crowded at all! (the second bar, with only 1 bartender, still had a long wait though.) If you're in SF and want to go on a cocktail adventure, this is the place to be!", "author": "Dan D."}

My friend wanted protein and smokiness; the result was a smoky egg-white concoction that was absolutely delicious. My sister had a super light, refreshing, and citrus-y cocktail.

Apparently, I was mistaken.  \n\nWhen 20+ of my friends and I showed up for our evening of fun, they informed us that they had been booked for private event (on a Friday night) in an hour.  Despite the fact that we had 20 people ready to buy drinks NOW, they corralled  us into a back room to their front room (and larger bar) could be available for the 4-5 people who showed up for the corporate event that was booked. On top of that, their door staff and security were so rude to the rest of our guests who arrived that we chose to move the party to a different location.\n\nAside from the rudeness of the staff, I was frustrated by the inaccessibility of the managerial staff and the lack of any email, phone, or website with which to arrange and accommodate events.  Their odd hours also made it impossible to visit in person to check the schedule.  The manager, in a half-hearted effort to keep our business, gave us mixed messages about whether or not they could accommodate us before we eventually gave up and found somewhere else.\n\nWhile their drinks are delicious and the aesthetic of the joint is quite cool, the ineptitude of the staff and the poor business model of mistreating paying customers in favor of corporate customers who have yet to appear leads me to STRONGLY DISCOURAGE PATRONAGE AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT.\n\nIn short: OddJob ruined my birthday.", "author": "Matt Z."}

Last Friday I finally got a chance to swing by, and the place has promise.\n\nThe space is actually divided into *two* bar areas: to the right, a pretty large one with several bartenders, a cocktail menu, and lots of little tables & seating in the form of cushioned benches and also smaller chairs that can easily be moved around; and to the left, a much smaller bar with only one bartender & a bunch of bar stools. This smaller area is supposed to be like Big was--ie, no menu; you just tell the bartender what kind of thing you want, and s/he creates it for you on the fly. (BTW, be prepared to wait at the smaller off-menu bar if it's even a little crowded; it's one guy/girl making individualized, custom drinks for like 20 people, so it's not really fair to complain about how long the drinks take. If you're in a rush, order off the menu at the larger bar.)\n\nThe Pros:\n* Easily walkable from BART\n* Spacious\n* Plenty of seating\n* Lots of bar space at the big bar\n* Interesting, well-made drinks\n* Options (nice, safe menu drinks or choose your own adventure)\n* Friendly bartenders who really, really want to make you something you'll enjoy\n\nThe Cons:\n* LOUD. Even sitting right next to my friends, we had to shout to hear each other. Maybe get some sound baffling going? It didn't seem like there was any, so that might help.\n* Cash only. Not a huge deal as there is an ATM, but just FYI.\n* All the drinks I tasted (four custom, two from the menu) were *ever* so slightly too sweet. This is a solvable problem at the off-menu bar; next time I'll just have to remember to emphasize that I like a dry, spirit-forward cocktail & by & large disdain the sweet ones.\n\nOverall I was pleased & enjoyed things, so I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Angela B."}

The decor is gorgeous, drapery and an old-school chandelier; decent air-conditioning and plenty of room to perch around the bar.\n\nThey make decent cocktails. The drinks are somewhat -gimmicky foams with lots of arbitrary ingredients and pairings. (\"Have you *ever* had mint tea in Morocco? What about 'lapsang souchong' in Hong Kong? Well *I have* and it tastes like this...\" etc.) Under the veneer, the drinks were crowd-pleasing with a lot of forward sweetness and misbalance on those bitters he bought at Cask.\n\nThe drinks are four stars, but the service is generally poor. Joey is absolutely desperate to be at the center of attention, every moment you spend at SRO. He even interrupted our host's toast. Keep it classy, SRO.\n\nJoey also intentionally \"challenges\" drinkers by pouring them precisely what they did not order. I would be more accommodating if we were in Topeka or The Marina, or even The Mission now-a-days... However this was a group of cocktail-knowers, which makes the pretense not just rude but a little pathetic. When my friend in the hospitality industry says \"no brown liquor,\" it is not because she lacks understanding. She has a plethora of reasons to prefer a clean, timely gin or white Irish whisky.\n\nIt's all a bit much, and there are a zillion places in town that do better cocktails without the pretense.

It is completely without a menu, which makes it kind of high maintenance--you have to actually think about what you might want instead of letting limited options determine it for you, and UGH who wants to THINK, am I right?! However, once thought has happened, the drinks are guaranteed to be brilliant. I have never had a drink there that I do not love, and the more I go there, the better they get, as the bartender figures me out. The ingredients are ridiculous, and I love everything about that.

Throughout the evening, they were rude and unaccommodating. When I went to order a shot of frenet for my friend whose drink didn't contain any, they told me that I should leave. I have literally never been asked to leave any bar (or restaurant), and to hear this from a bar that had provided such terrible service and quality was very surprising.

This becomes evident when you hear the remarks of the crowd and how people express their undying love for the place. Any other time this would be considered weird, but after taking in vibe and having a sip of your drink it all makes sense. \n\nWhile the place is cash only with an entrance in a sketchy alley, I'd easily go every day of the week and spend any random ATM fee for a one of a kind speciality cocktail to enjoy with great people.

The night started out great with Joey Picchi as the bartender (the bar to the left, called PlusPlus, SRO, Standing Room Only. Pick a name you guys! But it's a bar within a bar). I've never met a bartender as vain as Joey which is fine since his drinks are good, but lets lower the ego please. He kept asking me how his drinks were every few seconds, needing his ego to be fed. Kept on bragging how he never tries his drinks because he knows it's perfect (yeah right...saw him testing a few drinks..what a hypocrite). Anyway, I wouldn't have been so upset with all his annoying narcissistic self if he wasn't such a SNEAKY LITTLE RAT! \n\nWe were getting ready to go but we decided to have one more drink to share. Joey tried to convince us to drink more but we told him we had an early day tomorrow. Right before we were about to finish our drink Joey gives us another one and told us to try it. Once again we told him it was good since his ego was starving for attention. Once we finished we asked for the bill and the bill came out to be $64 for four drinks. I was in shock because I didn't expect to pay for four drinks when I ONLY ordered three. Also didn't expect his drinks to be $16 each since he just used Bulleit, which is an average whiskey and nothing special. On yelp everyone was saying the drinks were $12 (was there an inflation within a week time frame?!?!) Drinks were good but not $16 good. Drinks weren't as customized as he said. Joey made the exact duplicate for the person who came right after I finished my first drink and the same drink AGAIN for the next group that came in. He says it's a menu-less bar because he customizes everyone's drinks but everyone ends up with the SAME drink. \n\nThe price wasn't the kicker for me even though I thought it was ridiculously over priced. The thing that I was pissed off about was that Joey Picchi snuck a drink on us. We never ordered the extra drink and if your going to give us a drink we didn't ask for I am going to expect it's complimentary.  I didn't like his tactics and schemes. The main reason I came here was because I'm a fan of Big. I heard Big and Jones Bar teamed up to form Oddjob. Later I learned that Big isn't associated with this place. I wonder why...could be because of  dishonest people like Joey Picchi. I wouldn't want to work with shady people either.\n\nMinus Joey Picchi  would have made this a great place. \n\nFYI: this place is CASH ONLY and drinks are $16 each.", "author": "Victoria C."}

We went to the other bar and spoke to a bartender who said \"she's really sick\". Gross!  Extremely drunk manager (it was his birthday) offered to buy us drinks but by that point we were over it.  Based on how great the owners and previous bartenders were we hope to try it again and actually get a drink. Hopefully I can revise and give them 5 stars.", "author": "M K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-10-26", "description": "We arrived last night at 12:30, took a cab special trip with four guests. We ordered four drinks from the female.bartender who was working the specialty custom drink bar. It was not busy only 6 people at the specialty bar besides us and open tables and two bartenders at the other regular bar and about 12 people there. We waited 35 minutes and she still hasn't prepared our drinks so we thought she forgot, reminded her and she said we were next as she said she had only two drinks to make. At 1:30am, 60 minutes after placing our drink order, the bartender said,\"it's last call and i won't have time to make your drinks\". We were at the bar observing her and she was super lazy and inefficient. We then presented this to the manager a male with bleached blonde hair who was intoxicated/high and he did not help us. The manager sad it's his birthday and was more interested in partying. He said the bartender was sick so perhaps we are lucky she didn't prepare our drinks as we all may have been sick too as we watched her prepare drinks and touch fruit and fresh ingredients with her hands. We used to go to this bar when it was at a different location called Big. The bartender and manager this night were apathetic and have a poor impression. I hope the owner reads this as its a great concept just poorly managed!!", "author": "Jim S."}
