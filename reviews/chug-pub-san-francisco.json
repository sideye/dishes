I was here this past Thursday and it was the best timing and day to be there. It was not crowded at all and my group had plenty of space to roam around without bumping into other patrons.\n\nThe beers on tap were only $3 as well which was awesome. I believe there were only 2 bartenders working at the time or maybe they had just switched shifts, not sure. \n\nThe pool table was open and available as well which was nice.

Decided to stay regardless and had a few drinks and some tacos (their menu has a small number of mostly Mexican options plus some random stuff like bruschetta and cheese bread). They were also out of a few menu items so the already small menu got even smaller. \n\nDrinks are fine- decent pours and they had a pretty good beer selection. The food was okay, nothing too special.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-14", "description": "\"I'm getting ultimate fires at Chug Pub\" is just about the sketchiest-sounding statement you could make about plans in the Sunset.\n\nIt doesn't help that Chug Pub looks dark and stormy, there is a smoking room, the crowd is not the hip twentysomethings of SoMA, and overall ambiance reminds me of Moe's from the Simpsons.\n\nBut once you get over the apparent sketchiness and appreciate it instead as divey, Chug Pub is a neat place:\n\n(+) Decent selection of beer on tap, and happy hour is $3 select pints until 6pm. We actually got there a little after 6 and the bartender didn't notice, but she still gave us HH on our first drinks. Cocktails are hit-or-miss and somewhat inconsistent in terms of strength.\n\n(+) Pool table and Pacman arcade games. Fee-for-service, but these games are entertaining in themselves and ridiculously amusing after a few dranks.\n\n(+) Many TV's. The extent to which I follow sports is mostly limited to what I passively absorb on my Facebook newsfeed, but for all normal people out there who watch sports, I like how there are plenty of TV's so you don't have to turn around and sit at weird angles.\n\n(+) The food is pretty amazing. Unlike overpriced generic burgers and fries you find at most bars (or worse, no food), Chug Pub gets creative and has used psychoanalytic optimization to concoct the best drunchies food of your imagination. \n\nWe stopped by for drinks one night and saw some people eating what essentially looked like In-N-Out animal fries on steroids, so we made it a point to go back. The ultimate fries are indeed the ultimatum of bar food: a basket of waffle fries bigger than your face, generously slathered with cole slaw (yes, veggies!), pulled pork, bacon, BBQ sauce, jalapenos, and topped with a RUNNY fried egg and DINO CHICKEN NUGGETS. I know the exaggeration looks funny in a review, but it exactly illustrates my excitement :D Although the ingredients were mostly canned/frozen/bottled, everything together was delicious. Also, the portion was large enough to feed two hungry people for dinner (and probably more for post-prandial late-night drunchies).\n\n(?) Parking?

There's a pool table squeezed in between the bathroom and some tables making it a little difficult to play, but still fun. \n\nBeers are fairly cheap and I hear they have a chug tower complete with its own tap for a table of friends during the big game. It's also been said that the chug tower comes with a free basket of fries. \n\nThe most interesting thing about this bar is the pop-up restaurant that has taken residence in the kitchen. I'm pretty sure the kitchen is ran by a father-son team trying their hand at the whole restaurant thing. The food is Uyghurm which is the food of Chinese Muslims. You won't be able to find it anywhere else in the city. \n\nIf you're planning on eating at Chub Pub don't expect something close to Chinese food. Uyghurm food reminds me of Indian food; playing up potatoes and plenty of spice. Three of us shared the spicy chicken, which was good. There were large slices of garlic in the dish and I kept eating them thinking they were sliced water chestnuts, so I was left with a funny aftertaste. If I wasn't drinking beer for 8 hours straight I would have enjoyed the food more. For me, I don't think Uyghurm food is te way to go on a belly full of beer.", "author": "Emily E."}

They have these beer tower things that look really cool. NOt sure how much they are, but seems more fun than getting a pitcher.  The only problem is you gotta find a table top to enjoy it at.  \n\nWith any place in the area, parking is horrendous and it can get crowded.  It was especially crowded because the Hardly Strictly Blue Grass festival let out during the game.  In some ways this lowered my star rating because a bunch of drunk, funny smelling people came in not so much to watch the game, but to continue their debauchery...annoying.

After inquiring about it they tried to to say that 'I had one too many' and had no idea what was going on. Now, maybe it was the bar tender that night who was new, but either way I had to fight to get my money back, and that is not an accusation you should be making of your customers when you run a bar.

From what my friends and I have seen, it seems like the crowd is a bit older, but if you're looking for a place to get some drinks and watch a game, this place will do just fine. In terms of transportation, the bar is only a block from the 28 and 29 bus lines and there's street parking along Irving or on 20th - might be tricky but you'll probably just have to park on Irving if it's past 8 PM or so.\n\nAs for the drinks, the Beer Tower is pretty ridiculous I gotta say, but is definitely a fun way to share a couple of drinks with friends.

I came here on a Thursday night after going to another event, showed up around 10:15PM and it was pretty busy with a lot of people just sitting hanging out or playing pool. It's a small little place but it does have a homey vibe to it.\n\nThe drink prices here weren't too unreasonable. We had two shots of Patron, Cranberry&Vodka, and 2 Coors Lights for $27.50. That's definitely a lot more reasonable than many other bars I've been to around the city and even other bars in Downtown San Jose so I couldn't complain. The bartender I encountered was really friendly. She made a decent drink, she smiled at us, helped us right away, made the drinks quickly, etc. We didn't have any problems with the service. In fact, when we went to close our tab i felt bad for her because she was the only bartender and was busting her butt helping everyone super efficiently and you could tell she felt bad once she had noticed us and couldn't help us right away.\n\nI can't comment on the food here because I didn't try it, but I did notice a lot of people eating and the food did look good. However, the only thing I did notice was there wasn't a large.....racial diversity. My friend & I were the only ethnically different ones at this particular pub (at least the entire night when we were there!) and normally that wouldn't be a problem but I definitely felt a little out of place at the end of the night as I felt like we got a few looks as though people felt we didn't \"belong.\"\n\nIf I was in the area I would definitely come back here and get the Beer Tower if I was with a group of people or just grab a quick drink otherwise.", "author": "Gianna D."}

I was sitting at the bar shoulder to shoulder in black and orange watching as the Giants won it all. People started chanting, drinks were spilling and the bartenders took out champagne bottles to spray on all the patrons. The party continued all night with the celebration spilling out into the street . \n\nThey specialize in the giant tower which is probably good for 3 or 4 people and comes with an appetizer to munch on. Don't even bother with anything other than the garlic fries. \n\nPretty much all locals on the weekends and they all seem to know each other.

After a nice dinner in the city, we decided to hit up Chug Pub.  It was our first time and we found this place through Yelp ( for the 100th time).   Honestly, I didn't even know a bar existed on Lincoln Way, BUT, when we mentioned Chug Pub to our friends later on, many have seemed to have heard about it.   We were able to find street parking a block away.  We walked over and find this place dead :( Well, we expected.  \n\nThere were only a large party of 5 -6, 2 parties of 2, and there was us, a party of 3.  Nevertheless, the atmosphere was very chill.  Loud oldies were playing throughout the bar.  Flat screen TVs were on some sports channel.  There were also a pool table available.  Being on a Sunday night, there was only one young lady at the bar counter serving the rest.  \n\nWe ordered a pitcher of Blue Moon (almost always) for like $14? Sat and sip on our beer as we enjoy little chats.  The other parties were also doing the same, no one was really trying to get hammered on a Sunday night. haha. My boyfriend and our friend decided to order a Ghost rider for the first time.  The bartender was really nice and friendly and explained what it was made up of and how they should take it.  If you don't know what a Ghost Rider is, it's basically a drink mixed with 5-7 different kinds of hard alcohol in a whiskey glass, lighted on fire, and you chug it through a straw.  According to my boyfriend, it gets quite hot as you get to the bottom of finishing the shot.  \n\nWe want to try their beer tower next time we go.  It's suppose to come with fries!  Happy hour is from 3-8pm with $3 well drinks! I am hoping to move Chug Pub to 4 stars :)", "author": "Stephy L."}

I related a lot to Brian L's review because to a much lesser degree, I also had a bad experience with the bartenders playing favoritism and ignoring me for some reason I can't explain.\n\nThe last time I was here, I felt like I was disrespected. There were two bartenders that were WAY more concerned about flirting with some ugly drunk boys than they were about taking my order for drinks for my friends. What made matters worse was the person I presumed to be the manager at the time had to signal TWO times for one of the girls to come over to me. The first time, the one bartender who was not busy didn't look over at me, but instead rolled her eyes and told the guys she was only wanted to help them. Then on the second attempt the manager literally tapped her on the shoulder and pointed his finger at me, and the she walked over with a pouted look on her face. Sorry chica, but your taste in boys suck, and I wanted my pre-birthday celebration drink.\n\nThen she took her time (about 10 minutes or so) to make the worst margaritas and whiskey sours I have ever had in my life. Not all Whiskey Sours are perfect, but how does one screw up a Margarita?\n\nThis place is good for groups, so most likely if I ever had friends that wanted to come here, I would still tag along because I like my friends, not because I like this place. I would just have to strategically plan out which one of us in the group has the best chances of winning the affections of the bartenders so we all don't end up with crappy drinks that take forever to make.", "author": "Megan D."}

Not a hole in the wall nor a fancy schmancy kind of bar, Chug Pub is a good balance of both. The kind of bar you want to meet up with friends after a long day of work and just hang out (kind of like MacLaren's Bar in How I Met Your Mother). \n\nFor you fellow beer lovers, you'll love this place simply for their beer towers. When I walked in, I saw this ginormous tower sitting between two of my guy friends. If I remember correctly, I believe he said for $30, you get the tower and two appetizers (don't mark my words though). Score!  If that's just too much beer for you, then go during happy hour - $3 beers!  Plus, if you walk further back into the bar, there are some typical bar games (billiards, pool, arcade games, etc.) \n\nThe service there is pretty good too.  While I was ordering a round of Irish car bombs for my friends, one of my gfs said that she doesn't like Irish car bombs.  So, I asked the bartender if there were any other bombs she'd recommend.  She suggested a Cherry bomb ( I don't remember what's in it, sorry).

Everyone here is a Giants fan! From the customers, the bouncers, the awesome bartender girls and even the cooks! The moment you walk in, you know you're in the home of Giants fans. At first glance in each direction there's flat screens everywhere for you to enjoy the game at any location in the bar. \n\nThe thing to order is the infamous Beer Towers! 2.5 liters of whatever they have on tap. My friends and I ordered Stella;  and each tower is just $30 and each comes with your choice of fries or nachos! We ordered 2 towers, so we got  to try the fries and nachos. Personally I felt the fries had an interesting taste; not sure what it was, but they went really well with our beer! As for the nachos we ordered them with cheese on the side to avoid soggy chips, but didn't realize they came with salsa, so inevitably they became soggy; however, those salsa chips dipped in cheese were really good!\n\nThe only downside to Chug pub is that it can get really busy so you have to get there early to get a seated or standing table; however, Chug pub knows how to keep their giants fans happy so when it does get full they're willing to check your IDs and let you watch the game from outside where you can perch your drinks on the window sill and still get a good view of the game! Overall, great place to watch the game and hang out with your friends and fellow Giants fans!\n\nTip: once you get your Beer tower, you get to keep it as long as you keep ordering more, but be careful if you go during a busy time you may not get one because they only have six, so first come first serve; sucks when people order them and leave them at the .25 liter mark just to keep the tower though.", "author": "Jon K."}

When you go to the Chug Pub, most def, you get a tower. If you don't know what a tower is, it's a tall cylinder filled with beer (of your choice) poured out from a spout. It cost $30 but if you get it, you can get free fries or nachos (get the garlic fries because they're that good). When I'm not drinking beer, I'll go for something fruity like a \"sex on the beach\". They fruity drinks are good. My mouth isn't being attacked with alcohol (haha). The drinks are fairly priced and the bartenders are friendly. \n\nThey have flat screen tvs if you need something to look at, a pool table, and a video game machine.

It's prominent exterior doesn't really quite match its quaint and modest interior. However, the inside is pretty classy (and dive-y at the same time) and I really appreciate the dark wood interior and numerous flat screen televisions adorning the walls. Not enough credit goes to places that make sure their tables aren't wobbly. I have to say the tables are stable! The staff is friendly and inviting, the beer selection is decent, and the cocktails are pretty good.\n\nHowever, I can't really recommend the food here. While it's adequate, I didn't appreciate paying $9.00 for a cheeseburger (albeit being nicely constructed and with seemingly fresh produce in it) that's obviously made with a frozen patty. Tried the fried calamari as well and am pretty sure those were of the frozen variety as well (When they're uniformly shaped and look like onion rings, I'm pretty sure I'm right).

My fiance turned 30 and I forced him to pick a bar so we can all get drunk on his behalf. He's been to Chug and liked it each time, so we told all our friend to go there this past Friday night. \n\nI called and see if it was okay for me to drop off 2 cakes prior to the event. No problem. The bartender was really nice and helped me put the cake away in their fridge. I came back at 8p with the posse and we all had a grand ol' time shooting pool and drinking. Spending major $$ since we had about 40 people there. That was about 2/3 of the bar basically. \n\nCake time came and I went into their kitchen to set up the candles and whatnot. The Asian guy in the BLACK shirt was VERY nice. He was very accomodating while we waited for all our friends to gather at the bar so I can bring out the cake. I asked \"Is it ok for us to be behind the bar to take some pics of him blowing out the candles?\". He said \"Sure, that's fine\". Great! \n\nSo, there was me, and two other girls behind the bar. Yes, we were behind the bar a little, but just towards the end since the bar was packed with all our friends. THEN, Terrance comes out all in a huff and startes yelling \"CLEAR THIS AREA! YOU CANT BE HERE\"! He was trying to get out from behind the bar, so we were trying to let him out, but he was an ASS. TOTALLY yelling at us 3 girls who were behind the bar for a reason, not to just block his way! AND, how long will it take for us to sing Happy Birthday. The crowd will disperse right after.\n\nSo, he keeps shouting at us to move and we finally managed to let him get by. Then he goes \"Who are these kids anyway?!\" UM, first of all, these \"kids\" are ensuring that you get your next paycheck. Second, these \"kids\" are the same age as you! Just because we look younger! Last, there's no reason to be rude to your customers. There are other ways to handle a situation like that, especially if you're a \"manager\". \n\nTerrance totally ruined our experience there with his bad attitude. Thank goodness my fiance was too drunk to let it ruin his birthday celebration. Funny thing is, our friends there are actually his friends too! I spoke to a few of them since I know they go there enough to tell me who the guy was in the pink shirt. They're like \"That's Terrance. He's my age\". Which means MY age too, DUH! Kids my ass. What kind of manager would say that about his customers in front of all their faces. \n\nI think I may just end up here again since my friends frequent here.

My party had a total blast at this bar! The locals are so friendly and vibrant...totally different from the LA bar scene.\n\nIt was fun jawing back and forth with the locals (why are you guys so anti-LA???)

I'm definitely lagging. \nI usually go to chug pub on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and sometimes Mondays or Tuesdays. So.... I have been there every day of the week. Interesting.

Three Kettle One Tonics for under $20?! Definitely Chug Pub. The bartenders are extremely friendly and are hands down some of the nicest ones that greet you with a great smile.  \n\nOn Mondays... 50 cent wings! Get them they're delicious and well worth it.

Went for a friends birthday with 7 others and those who have been there before instinctively went for the Chug Tower aka huge tower of beer! It's amazing--Hefeweizen for 8.5 for only $30, and it comes with nachos or fries!   We opted for garlic fries x 2 and the nachos. I don't know if it was because I was 1) hungry and 2) feeling my alcohol from my pre-game shots, but both were DELISH--garlic fries were well salted and not overly garlicky and nachos were with very processed nacho cheese, salsa and jalapenos.  Generous portions and hit the spot. \n\nThe venue is reasonably clean, fair amount of seating in the front near the bar as well as in the back near the pool table, and bartenders are nice. Right before closing, they gave us a countdown on how many minutes we had left to drink up. And then as we're almost out the door, he hears it's our friends birthday, and offers him a birthday shot. (Too bad my friend was too gone to partake.) \n\nWasn't so busy on a Saturday night, but made it perfect for our larger group as we dominated the entire back area. I'm certain I'll make it out there again. Not too many places that have towers of beer in the city, let alone minutes away from where I and most of my friends dwell.", "author": "Marie B."}

There was only one bartender the whole night and she was very nice. A lot of foam fills up the top of the tower so she gave us some more in a pitcher. The beer tower comes with a free order of fries or nachos ($30)  I love fries! especially FREE FRIES! Being a Wednesday night with work the next day, we were only going to just get one beer tower and chill. That did not happen... \n\nWe started with just one beer tower and grab couple seats in the back, filled up each cup (the tower is about 7-8 cups of beer) and started playing drinking games with cards.  Started as a nice drinking game but slowly it got more intense and it became 3 girls vs 3 boys in the end. One tower became two, two became three! With the other towers we also got nachos and then curly fries.  The nachos were loaded! Lots of cheese and jalapeno.  I liked the regular garlicy fries better than the curly ones.\n\nIt's a decent size for a pub.  Full bar in the front of the pub with a couple high tops and regular tables and chairs in the back.  There a lot of TVs around the place, a pool table, and an old school street fighter machine with a change machine as well.  The bathrooms are also pretty clean.  Despite how much I'm hating being here at work right now, I had A LOT of fun last night.  I'll definitely come back to Chug Pub!", "author": "Katherine C."}

Though the place can get pretty rowdy, it's to be expected when a fight or a game is on.\n\nThe garlic fries were awesome, as were the nachos.  What I love about the nachos here is that it's what you would get at any baseball game, except it's littered with jalapenos.  There were literally enough jalapenos to put at least one on each chip, which, to me, is brilliant.  I can't count the number of times I've had to ask for extra jalapenos only one-fifth of the way through a plate of nachos.\n\nThe beer selection here is the same lineup of drafts you would see at any other rowdy bar in the city.  The Stella Artois on draft was, however, unexpected.\n\nThe music could be a little bit more consistent, but I guess that's what happens when you let the public take control of the jukebox.\n\nAll in all, Chug Pub is a great place to get your game on.\n\nGET:  Beer, Nachos", "author": "Michael K."}

The cool thing is out here, there is a small window to order drinks from the bartender, and you can hear the music that you just paid $1 at the jukebox to hear!  We bought two songs, but it is impossible to even hear the tune inside the bar.\n\nTip 'o the day:  Parking at night is not so hard in this area.  If you don't find street parking, park in the public lot behind the KFC/Taco Bell on 20th (more towards Irving than Lincoln), and after 6 pm, you don't have to feed the meters!", "author": "Daniel M."}

Attracts different sorts of people, including opposing fans, so it makes for a lively crowd when the games are on.\n\nFood there is surprisingly good.  Try the tuna melt.  Or the hamburger.  Free snacks like pretzels and popcorn.  If bar grub is not your favor, there are plenty of restaurants around the area.\n\nReasonably priced drinks.  They also have specials (chug tower w/ free nachos) and also specialty drinks.\n\nParking is not that bad.  Plenty of parking on Lincoln or Irving.

After I saw a table with one of the towers I had to get one too.  \n\nThe other drinks are really good too so don't be afraid to order other drinks!

I started coming here back when it was the Dubliner, to later find it renamed to the Lincoln Tavern, and then again to The Chug Pub. Identity crisis, perhaps? No. New owners. But just because the owners and name changed, doesn't mean that anything else has. This bar still has nice, friendly bartenders, moderately priced drinks and it's NEVER crowded, which I'm sure has to do with the location of it (then again, I usually never come here on a weekend). It is pretty detached from the \"hoppin\" part of the Sunset district (ie. Irving St between 7th and 10th St.). I know some people may view the lessened amount of foot traffic through here equal to that of \"lame\", but to me, it is heaven. I don't believe that you should have to wait more than 5 minutes to get a drink. And I also don't believe you should have to \"play for the table\" (in regards to pool). Why can't we all just switch off? I go - you go - I go - you go. Here, I never have to worry about that. There is never a battle here for the table and I enjoy the people I have encountered here that are always more than willing to share. You don't find that in too many bars here in the city. The other pretty sweet thing about this place is the outdoor patio that faces Lincoln. You can step out to get a breath of fresh air and still have your beer in hand...or cigarette, whatever you prefer. If you run out of beer, there is a window you can order from, so it is unnecessary to leave the comfort of your outdoor seating arrangement. Kiosk games and a digital jukebox - bonus for me! This place is just the best and it is the one thing I miss the most about living in the Sunset. I do drop in from time to time when I can though. And the biggest bonus besides all I've just mentioned: they take credit card!! As you know, not many places in the city do, so kudos to them!! I love this place and thanks!", "author": "Amber Y."}

Trust me, not good if you have ADD. Anwhoser, she raced around, fixing all the TVs so we had pure surround sound of the election coverage.\n\nShe also let us sample the beer before we ordered it and recommended the best grub to order. I got a hot link and my friend got the nachos with the \"good fake cheese\" as the bartender described it (obviously). \n\nFor a neighborhood bar, in once again what I like to call the arctic tundra of SF metro (The Richmond District) Chug Pub saves the day for me.

We walk in and there is a large bar with jager taps and all the drinks you could possibly think of. Then there is a room with a pool table and some areas to sit around and drink and what not. So we walk in and I get my boy a Stoplight since it's his birthday and it only came out to be $7. Super cheap, I was immediately happy about that. Good drink prices here. Next we get one of those huge dispensers of beer which holds like 3-4 liters of beer, blue moon too. We finish that pretty easy since it's a big group of people and then we get another one with fat tire and it's fairly cheap for all that beer and if you split it evenly it's a pretty good deal. So we sit and drink at the bar then we get the beer towers and walk over to the table areas and wait for the pool table to open up. The atmosphere is pretty chill with TVs everywhere playing different sport programs and some TVs with specials and menu items showcased on them. There isn't really a good mix of people at the bar, mostly dudes but it was still fun just to go out and chill. So if you want some cheap drinks, play some pool and hang out with some interesting people this is the place to be.

However, I really didn't like the crowd at this place. There were a lot of ghetto AzNs that weren't too friendly. I went here with my bloods one time and we were having a hard time deciding what to drink. So I asked a girl who was sitting by herself with a drink what would she recommend. She said that she didn't drink and to ask \"that\" guy near the bar. Now it's quite obvious she did drink because she had one in her hand! Also \"that\" guy must've been her bf because when he came over he was hella glaring at me. I asked him the same question and he said \"remi\" and continued to glare. I swear he was going to beat me up. \n\nDrinks were alright here but I wouldn't come here JUST for the drinks. I really wouldn't recommend going to this place unless you hang out with ghetto AzNs.

The prices on the Whisky they offer are very fare and the prices on the beers are good as well. \n\nThey have a pool table but so many people waiting to get on and play it isn't worth putting your name on the list if you are only going to be there for an hour or two. \n\nThey have a heated smoking room that my friends and I tend to hang out in since we all smoke and the great thing about this is they have a window linked to the bar so you don't have to go back in to order. \n\nOver all this is a cool place and it is nice to see a younger generation taking over the older bars and bringing new life to them. I have not yet tried the food but it seems they have a good menu of bar food so I will get there one night early to try and claim a space at the bar or one of the few tables inside to try it out.", "author": "don h."}

I live in the outer Sunset, pretty much 20 blocks down, and this is one of the best bars in the area. Beer prices are normal, with $2 dollar Tuesdays with Red Ale (pretty decent ale, maybe a 6% ABV?). I like to drink...and drink a lot...and chug pub gets my fuel tank filled. \nOutdoor smoking spot is really awesome. Its heated and has music. Its fun when you are hammered and spit out on the sidewalk or flick a smoke through the opened area and almost nail some passerby. I don't care, its all good in my book.\nGreat for a group of people or with a pal during happy hour. Bank of America and other banks are only a block away on Irving-so if you don't want to drop extra drinking cash on the ATM, you know where to go.\nSo yea, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die!\nedit:  the bartenders are babes.", "author": "Zach L."}

She didn't even look at my age and gave my ID back. Then I put it back in my wallet and then she tells me she forgot to look at my age.

The drinks were strong as the river Styx and the bartender was so fun. Seriously she was a doll. I want to invite that bitch on my next girls night out I love her to death. Even after sitting there a few hours and just chilling she made us up shots at the end of the night, just cuz. Too adorable. Great vib, great bartenders, and even with a jukebox that eats your money (they gave it back to us) this place is a 10!", "author": "Marissa S."}

Thanks, Tim, Terrance, and Janet.  The people are good, the drinks are good, the food is doable, and the beer towers keep everyone happy.  Don't forget to pick up your Chug Pub T-shirt from behind the bar.  It's an American Apparel tee and is actually extremely cute!", "author": "Kendra R."}

Nice selection of beers and can't beat the nachos or fries with each tower! The chicken tenders were also good. It wasnt that crowded when we went, so it was a great place to hang out with a group and drink.", "author": "Lauren K."}
