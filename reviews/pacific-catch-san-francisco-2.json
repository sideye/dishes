However the last two times I went left me with a bad taste in my mouth (literally) and the service was less than par.\n\nMy friend and I went in recently over the weekend right before the dinner time rush. The restaurant was busy but not packed. We were seated pretty quickly at a table of our choice. After 15 minutes we still never had a waiter come by or anyone bring us waters. I went up to the hostess, who was very pleasant, and asked her kindly if we could have a waiter sent to our table as we were ready to order. Our waiter came by to take our orders and that was the last time we saw him. A little later someone brought out our food, which the fish tasted particularly not fresh that day. My friend wasn't happy with her meal either, we both left without finishing our meals. Our waiter never came by to check on our food or ask us if we were ready for the bill. We had to flag down another waiter to grab the bill and alas thats when we saw our waiter next. Needless to say I will not return again.", "author": "Joanna M."}

Would come here at least once a month, and we had a few waitstaff who would recognize us. Food was a little pricey, but it was good and the service was fine. It was a fun little family indulgence. \n\nOur first time back in about a year. We should have known something was up when we saw empty tables on a Sunday night. We were sat right away, but had to wait for 8 minutes for someone to come by our table. Looks like it was the manager. He took our drink order, as well as our appetizers and dinner order. Apps were out quick, but we didn't see our mains for a God's 20 minutes after. \n\nFood was ok. My sweet potato fries were cold. Wife and son were not impressed with their meals.

We went last night for our usual order of the Japanese wasabi bowl and the Hawaiian teriyaki bowl and noticed that the menu looked updated (thank god!). We also noticed that our bowl ingredients were different but figured it might have been an improvement. \n\nMy boyfriend's bowl was an entirely different meal. We counted under 10 tiny sliced mushrooms and 2 slivers of avocado and smushed down sticky rice, giving the illusion that there was more food on the plate. The protein was dry and flavorless. This was one of the most cheaply made meals we have had in San Francisco and embarrassing for a restaurant to charge for this. It is not an adequate replacement for their previous menu and unfortunately it was now $18 instead of $16.50. Smashing food around in a plate is a great tactic for making kids and animals believe they are eating more. It also looked designed by a child and putting it on a fancy plate does not transform the meal into something worth charging the price we paid.\n\nMy Japanese wasabi bowl had so much dressing that it felt like consuming soup with a fork. What happened to the avocado and nori that made my bowl texturally appealing as well as yummy? There was way too much rice in my small sized bowl (the word bowl is generous - it was literally a shallow platter) and the ingredients felt so separate that I was unable to combine them. The proportions and qualities were way off unfortunately and I wish I knew it was more appropriate to ask for a spoon for the amount of dressing. \n\nWe will not be back unless the menu changes back and will look elsewhere for great rice bowls.", "author": "ashley d."}

Whether it's because they've been around for so long or because I've b een here so many times, it's gotten to the point now where they just kind of fade into the background for me.  Which might explain why, despite all of those trips here, I've still never written a review for these guys!  Although, I could've sworn I wrote something about them at some point over the years...\n\nWhile the place is starting to show a bit of its age (though they did convert part of their entry way into an outdoor seating area with a fire pit), Pacific Catch hasn't let its menu get outdated.  Along with expanding the choices for their long time staples (rice bowls, fried seafood, fish-centric entrees, sushi rolls, etc.), they also keep a rotation of daily chalkboard specials and added a \"raw bar\" menu, which features varieties of ceviche, poke, taktaki, platters/towers, and more.\n\nGiven how many times I've been here, I've been able to try a number of things on their menu, so I'd like to think I have a pretty good sense of them overall.  From their appetizers and fish tacos to their fish & chips and daily chalkboard specials, the food at Pacific Catch is generally pretty fresh...except for all of their fried stuff, like their Mixed Catch plate that my buddy likes).  However, whether it's been when I've dined in or when I used to get takeout, I usually end up getting the same thing every time - their JAPANESE WASABI BOWL with Poke ($16.50).\n\nFilled with Seaweed Salad, Avocado, Daikon Salad, Ginger, Sesame Seeds, Shredded Nori, and Soy-Wasabi Sauce, this isn't bad, but lacking compared to what you can get from poke joints.  While their poke (tuna) is generally pretty fresh, everything else is hit or miss.  The seaweed salad and avocado are good, but I'm not a fan of their daikon salad and the sauce is just okay (I personally prefer ponzu-based ones).  What's more, the rice can be a little inconsistent (can be overcooked).\n\nDespite how their food may not strike me like how it used to, I certainly appreciate how steady and consistent Pacific Catch has been.  From my first trip here, to the time we sat at their bar and watched the Giants clinch the 2014 World Series, to this most recent trip, the food hasn't changed much, for better or worse.  Still, it's nice that whenever I do come back, they're (probably) going to be as reliable as ever!", "author": "Mike L."}

It was bustling on a game night, mostly in the bar area, but we didn't have any issues getting a large table for a party of two. \n\nWe ordered two rice bowls and a two taco platter - way too much food in hindsight, but we enjoyed having all of the options. I found my Japanese wasabi bowl with salmon (grilled, btw) and 1/2 brown rice 1/2 greens to be very filling and I liked all of the toppings it included. The ingredients were fresh and they don't skimp on anything! The name is a bit of a misnomer though, as there was no wasabi that I could taste or see in my bowl. My mom's WestCoast grilled salmon bowl looked equally delicious but with an assortment of other toppings. \n\nThe tacos were quite hefty in serving size as well.

All the options here are super fresh - there is a wide variety of poke, fried seafood, soups, etc. On weekends and also Fridays in the evenings this place is usually pretty full, so don't be surprised if you have to wait a bit! My girlfriend and I ate here on a Saturday night at 7:30pm and we could only get outside seating.\n\nFor our food we ordered 3 different items! There were all pretty good, definitely really fresh and well prepared. The service was alright since it was super busy, but all in all the meal was nice!\n\nCoconut Shrimp: A bit pricey for what you get. They give you 8 really delicious fried pieces of shrimp for ~$10. Even for SF standards, this is pretty steep. The playing wasn't too great either - it looked like the shrimp were just thrown on there. However, the taste was really good.\n\nSalmon Chowder: Definitely a must-get! The chowder is rich and hearty, and has tons of seafood flavor packed into it! Not too thick or runny, and contained lots of potatoes and vegetables. They were a bit skimpy on the salmon however, only placing 4-5 pieces on top of the chowder.\n\nCombination Poke: Honestly, compared to getting poke at a restaurant that specializes in poke, this fell short. The pieces of fish were cut very weirdly, too small and not enough to get a good bite. The flavor of the salmon was masqueraded with overly rich sauce that they provided.", "author": "Gregory T."}

Here's why:\n\nFirst of all, there's a parking lot which is unheard of in the Sunset area unless you're a super market or a drug store. We found a spot as soon as we pulled in. Next, the restaurant was so lively and bustling. I just loved the atmosphere from the get go. It was busy on a Friday night and the wait was long but they told us there was space at the bar so the two of us took a seat and skipped the entire line. We didn't order any alcohol but the bartender was definitely entertaining to watch. Free show/entertainment with dinner and no line?! Already a good start to the meal.\n\nWe ordered tacos (traditional Baja, Mahi Mahi, and cabo shrimp), the Hawaiian poke appetizer, and the Korean bbq rice bowl. The poke was a great wonderful mix of flavor although a tad on the saltier side. The fish was fresh and a nice texture that was not too mushy or chewy. Of the tacos, my favorite was the cabo shrimp as that one was moist and juicy while the other two tacos were a bit on the drier side which makes sense given that it was fish. The Kbbq bowl was huge and had a lot of rice. The meat on the bowl was delicious although I did find the sweet egg quite odd.\n\nThe meal took a while to come out due to some unknown reason but the manager noticed and comped our appetizer so great customer service there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-04", "description": "Apologies in advance to anyone from San Diego, but Pacific Catch is my baseline for good fish tacos. I know it's technically a Bay Area chain restaurant, but there's no denying that Pacific Catch manages to keep locals coming back whenever they're craving some unpretentious seafood: abundant seating (with the chance to choose between a livelier, younger happy hour crowd on the left side of the restaurant and a more family-oriented booth seating on the right), complimentary pretzel Goldfish and edamame at the beginning of your meal, and a plethora of menu options.\n\nSure, you can order a rice bowl, sandwich, or maybe even a slightly overpriced poke bowl here, but I truly think the fish tacos are where Pacific Catch shines. Having driven past Pacific Catch all the time when I was younger, I didn't think to finally check it out until a few years ago when two of my friends shared that this was where they got their fish taco fix. \n\nWhatever you do, do not turn down the opportunity to pay an extra $1 for sweet potato fries. They are beyond flavorful and help you forget that you're eating at a chain restaurant. I also like the quaint Honolulu Tribune newspaper wax/butcher paper that the fish tacos come on because it feels like how a mom-and-pop fish stand would serve 'em. I like to get the three taco platter ($17.50 with the sweet potato fries) with traditional baja and cabo shrimp. With the cod and avocado-tomatillo salsa, the traditional baja is my personal favorite because it seems juicier and fresher, but I'm also a sucker for the cabo shrimp because of the generous amount of avocado it comes with. $17.50 certainly seems like a lot to pay for three fish tacos, but I've never been disappointed with the quality of the fish or found myself hungry again a few hours later.\n\nSpeaking of prices, the Mai Tai here sure is tasty and will fulfill all your rum-related dreams, but at $11, I have a hard time justifying it because it's not exactly of cocktail bar caliber.

I enjoy sitting in the bar area, even outside happy hour, because in my experience that is where you get the best service;) The restaurant is larger than most in the area and the menu can accommodate a range of tastes, which is great for family visiting or dining with a group of friends. I gave them 4 stars for inattentive servers, the place is priced high enough that you should expect them to keep your glass of water full and deliver the check/take your order in a more timely fashion. More often than not we wait more than 15 minutes for our check. The bartenders are all GREAT, and really brought up the team average. Secondly, the price points are slightly high for the quantity of food you get.

I am not a fan of chains.  But what chains lack in charm they usually make up for (if they are good) in consistency of experience.  From that standpoint, Pacific Catch is on the higher end of the curve for what a chain restaurant experience can be.\n\nThis location in the Sunset is always crowded and has systems in place (a buzzer) to notify waiting guests when a table is ready. I actually hate to dine with a buzzer, but I have to admit that I do like an efficient process and getting seated, so there are trade offs certainly.\n\nOn the plus side, we were seated quickly, ordered quickly and the fresh seafood was solid. Some things were, in fact, an excellent value (the fresh Crab Melt for example) while other things arrived and we found them disappointingly small.  Their ceviche was fresh and well seasoned, but uncommonly small down what can only be described as a minuscule handful of chips.\n\nAs a local chain, Pacific Catch certainly has more upside than down.  Despite an original restaurant with a point of view being our preferred dining experience, we can give credit to a chain restaurant and even seek it out, if it's a good one.", "author": "Rachel H."}

This restaurant has gone to a central system for ordering food and it has not helped. Since the people you talk with are not on site, they don't know how busy it is or if they are out of something. So my last two times I have ordered food it was really frustrating and on top of it, people at the restaurant don't seem to care about the frustration. While I really like the food, I don't plan to order food from here anymore. \n\nIn general I really like the food, but it is really inconsistent- sometimes sublime other times just ok.

Just down the street is Pacific Catch, and even though only street parking is available, we lucked out by finding an open spot on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. It's just a hop and a skip away from the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has a very cool vibe going on. They have beautiful paintings of aquatic life on the wall, and the whole place feels like it should be located on the water. Our server was Jesse, and he was great. He was friendly, funny, and he made sure we were taken care of before taking off. \n\nWe started our meal with a small dish of shelled edamame and goldfish pretzels. An interesting and unusual combo, I know. But the two together actually made one tasty treat. From there we went to ceviche, and it was so good it took all our strength not to lick the bowl. The ceviche was fairly simple yet tasty, and the amount of shrimp they offer you is incredible. It comes with a side of chips, but I preferred to eat it alone.  I ordered the salmon and avocado poke for dinner. I've never had poke before, but I must say I am now a fan. For someone trying to watch what they eat, it was the perfect option. Plus, Jesse offered to bring me a side of brown rice that went perfect with it. I turned it into a little salad bowl. If you love sushi, but you want to lay off the rice-heavy rolls, this is an excellent substitute. The dish came with won tons, which I saved for snacking later. \n\nThe meal came to an end with a beautiful dessert. Jesse recommended one dessert, but we decided we must try the Dulce de Leche Spring Roll, because how often do you come across something so unique? It was beautiful both visually and gustatory. It's a puff pastry, filled with caramel cheesecake, wrapped up and deep fried, and then topped with a generous portion of the most amazing ice cream ever. The ice cream was incredibly smooth, and if it's not homemade, it's the closest thing to it.  The whole meal was spectacular, but that dessert is mind blowing. \n\nPacific Catch offers what every restaurant goer wants: Great food, at great prices, with great customer service.", "author": "Jonathan R."}

I had same feeling like step on dogs poop accidentally at wrong time and wrong place. \n\nAs a consultant, I have a few assumptions,\n1. They don't like Asian. Or previously they had bad experience with Asian customers so their waitresses felt it's legitimate not to serve Asian customers. \n\n2. It's just another bad restaurant we see from Yelp from time to time. They are in the service industry but don't offer good service. The management has no idea what's going on. Their waitresses just came by, punched the clock and called it a day.\n\n3. I assume their food is still ok. It's quite a large restaurant with good decoration. It must be a reason it could last so long. If service is bad, what else could support it? Having said that, a good restaurant with bad service and good food, does it make sense to anyone?\n\nI still felt perplexed to that waitress. I met a lot offensive people in my life but not like her, an waitress working in a restaurant which seems to have a fairly good ranking in San Francisco.

This franchise lays in the heart of San Francisco's Inner Sunset neighborhood right off the of the 9th Avenue Entrance to Golden Gate Park. Pacific Catch is a fine franchise and it's been in this location for over ten years, so despite the competition of the surrounding neighborhood this place is doing just fine. But the question is, is it worth it?\n\nI went for a pre-planned birthday party, so we were able to make reservations for our party of seven at 7pm on a Wednesday evening in July. Although I've been this restaurant before, I haven't been in a while and I like some of the newer things they've brought to the interior, like a nice outdoor fireplace in front of the vestibule area and all of the funky artwork on the walls and hanging from the ceilings. Upon opening the menu, I did notice that the prices are high at Pacific Catch. Be prepared to get sticker shock as this place does not represent the most affordable meals for families in or from out of town. The average price is sixteen dollars per main course, but the food was dependable and an interesting blend on the traditional seafood fusion dish. \n\nSince there were seven of us in our party we had to get appetizers and the Cabo Calamari, as always, is an easy choice with crispy calamari, lemon slices, fresno chilies and chipotle aioli were decent if somewhat lackluster. The Original Hawaiian Poke Trio was a nice surprise because it came in three ranges of flavors with ahi tuna and sesame-soy marinade spicy seasoning, but at 19 dollars isn't the most affordable starter meal on the menu. I do give credit to Pacific Catch as everything on the menu does sound unbelievably tasty, even their fish and chips dish is described with a mouth-watering sensibility.  \n\nAfter thinking and thinking (and thinking) about what I wanted to get that would be a good representation of what Pacific Catch has to offer, I decided to go with the Island Tacos Trio mainly because at 16 dollars you can mix and match three any tacos on their menu. Although they all sounded decent, the three tacos I went with were the Traditional Baja Taco with its Crispy Alaskan Cod, cabbage jalapeno tartar, and avocado tomatillo salsa, the Spiced Chicken Taco with grilled Mary's Chicken, cabbage avocado, chipotle aioli and pico de gallo, and the Pacific Steak Taco with marinated skirt steak, crispy onions, cilantro cabbage, sriracha aioli and lime cream. All three were solid pics with a little spice, a little crunch, and a decent amount of flavor. \n\nPacific Catch is a decent place with a thought-provoking menu that combines Asian Fusion, Tex-Mex and fresh seafood entrees. The service, ambiance, and overall quality and presentation of the dishes were basically all on point. I asked at the top is it worth it, and I have to admit at that rate the answer remains no because of the overall type of food being offered doesn't match up with the prices. I simply wish the price points were a little more friendlier to the average tourist that tends to frequent this neighborhood. I would consider going again, maybe for Happy Hour or a late night bite. But there are other more unique and mom and pop style options out there in the Inner Sunset area that are dying to be supported by the community and newcomers alike.", "author": "Jason F."}

The menu features mainly California seafood dishes with some Asian fusion touches here and there. This corner venue is large and spacious with very high ceilings, but they keep the place pretty cold. There is also some cozy outdoor seating under some heaters, but keep in mind, it is right next to the bus stop. \n\nThey start you off with some complimentary shelled edamame and pretzel goldfish, which is a cute nod to the seafood menu, but I'd still prefer bread. I also think edamame is more enjoyable with the shell on.\n\n$16.50 Japanese Wasabi rice bowl w/ Hawaiian poke - seaweed salad, avocado, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, shredded nori, soy-wasabi sauce:\nThe bowl has a decent portion of bite-size chunks of sweet, juicy tuna. The soy-wasabi sauce is mild and not too strong on the wasabi. It is also seasoned with green onions, chives, and sesame seeds. Everything tastes fresh including the pale slivers of creamy avocado and crunchy, crisp seaweed salad. Be sure to get a little bit of everything in each bite, otherwise you're left with a lots of rice at the bottom of the bowl. \n\n$15.50 Ahi Tuna Salad w/ seared ahi, greens & romaine, avocado, cucumber, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, soy-wasabi vinaigrette:\nWhen I want something lighter, I'll go for the salad. The ingredients are pretty much the same, but with lettuce instead of rice. But with a salad, I go for the seared tuna instead of poke, because it creates the illusion of a meatier salad. Again, try to eat a little of everything together, otherwise you're left with a ton of greens, or as my friend calls it, 'rabbit food.'\n\nA lot of people like the sweet potato fries. They're alright, but sweet potato fries are becoming a ubiquitous offering across the board.\n\nHappy hour deals are pretty good if you are in the area in the afternoons. Poke is about $8.\n\n$9 Baja Shrimp Ceviche - lime, serrano chili, avocado, cilantro, tortilla chips:\nThese bite-size shrimp are springy, meaty and seasoned well. The verde sauce is on the runny side and is quite spicy. I could eat this on its own without tortilla chips too, but the thin, crunchy chips make a nice vehicle.\n\n$12.50 Hawaiian Poke with wonton chips - original ahi tuna, sesame-soy marinade, spicy seasonings:\nA small bowl of juicy ahi cubes covered in sesame seeds and micro greens are accompanied with some fried wontons.\n\n$7 Mochi Fondue - vanilla, chocolate, coffee mochi balls & chocolate dipping sauce:\nI've tried this out of curiosity, but if you've ever had store-bought mochi ice cream balls, I'd say skip it. The taste is pretty similar with the addition of a little bowl of chocolate sauce on the side for dipping.\n\nThe tasty rice bowls are still my go-to items to order here. If I were in the area, I'd come back to try some of the other menu items too.", "author": "Joy W."}

We had a couple of friends in town so we brought them there. We had never been, so we thought it would be fun. The server warned us the kitchen was slow, so we had some expectations of a longer wait. It was strange, though, since the restaurant never filled up and there were plenty of empty tables the entire time we were there. After waiting, however, the food arrived and all four entrees were stone cold. The server wasn't happy and he got the manager involved. Unfortunately, even with multiple attempts to fix the food, nothing really happened. We got new pieces of fish, but the side dishes were still cold. When we complained, they brought different side dishes. One entree had to have the fish brought out three times in total. The final time it wasn't actually cooked through all the way. The server was very apologetic and the manager gave us four complimentary entree coupons. They didn't charge us for most of the meal--though they did charge us for the appetizer and glass of wine. Honestly, for what we went through--not actually having an edible meal after waiting for more than an hour--we shouldn't have had to pay for anything. We left the complimentary coupons on the table.

We got here much earlier than them and the hostess allowed us to be seated, as my Aunt made reservations.\n\nWhen seated, our server (I forgot her name but she is awesome!) promptly asked us what we would like to drink. My boyfriend and I ordered our drinks and we sat there for another 30 minutes waiting for my family. Our server checked in on us regularly, but nothing to the extent of pressuring us to order food. She refilled my boyfriend's lemonade regularly even before we ordered our food. Then after 30 minutes, my family FINALLY came!! I am ready for \"California\" poke!\n\nWhat caught my eye was the Asian bowls. My boyfriend and I both got the Japanese Wasabi. I got the Serrano along with my bowl, while my boyfriend got the Serrano and Grilled Salmon. You get a choice of getting it with all rice (White or brown) or half rice and half salad. We both chose half,half. \n\nAt first, I was really surprised how expensive the bowls were, being that it was at $16.50, but when it came out, oh my lordy! They are HUGE. Since my boyfriend got two choices, it was $5 more, which is pricey. The bowl came out and it was a mixture of greens, ocean salad, avocado, and your fish choice and our rice on the bottom. I couldn't finish it! My boyfriend barely finished it. \n\nThe fish quality surprised me! It was just like home. The only thing I did not particularly like were the jalape\u00f1os in the poke.

We were early for happy hour by a 1/2 hour, but I was starving so we ordered anyways. 3 mahi mahi tacos ($16)  and a sushi roll ($13), I already forgot the name of. \n\nThe sushi roll was good, and huge. The shrimp was a nice, actually huge tempera'd shrimp (though the crunch was lost) and not those tiny ones I normally see. Lots of avocado and julienned cucumber with a sliver of ginger, topped with a nice slice of ahi tuna. I like ginger and really liked this roll, although, just wish the shrimp had retained a bit of crunch. \n\nI didn't try the fish tacos, but Cory seemed happy. Big pieces of fish in here and he ate them all. The fries were, fries, a little too mushy for my preference. Cory had a few beers and I had water as we sat on the patio area with a view of the corner so prime people watching area. We were told by another frequent customer they had recently renovated everything, including enclosing the patio area. More glass would be nice, but you would lose seating I guess. The patio stayed nice and warm with the various glass gas rock fireplace and overhead heating elements. \n\nBarely there service, so I would have preferred to be checked in on a bit more. We never were asked about food during eating. Well enough they watched Cory's beers though. \n\nWe will probably be back on my overnight trips as this wasn't too terrible.

For entree I got the Ahi Tuna salad. It had a good mix of greens, avocado, sauteed cabbages, and 4 big piece of Ahi Tuna. Everything tasted great when mixed all together, with the soy-wasabi vinaigrette. My friend tried the Pacific Crab Salad (with real crab meat) and it was great too!\n\nSERVICE: We came here on a Tuesday evening and was seated immediately. Very friendly waiter and food came by within reasonable time.\n\nSETTING: I really like how spacious it is on the inside and also its ambient lighting. They have nice interior decors and there is also an outdoor patio where you can sit and dine (heat lamp provided during the freezing SF nights). Parking is probably impossible so just take Lyft or the muni. \n\nOVERALL IMPRESSION: I like it! I always run past this place but never really knew how tasty the food is. Will come back again for sure!", "author": "Wendy F."}

I wanted to come in, sit down order lunch, dessert and an alcohol drunk from east coast menu. I tried to find parking in their lot or anywhere on the block for 15min. That's fine, I live in the city. I decide to make a togo order instead since no parking.They have 10m pick up only spots though, that didn't move for 45min. Because yes, it took me 45min from arriving on site to leaving with a take out order. \n\nI placed order by phone while sitting in car in middle of parking lot travel lane hoping someone would leave soon. I  make sure to notate I wanted the entree lobster roll from the limited time east coast menu. I am quoted 15min. I go inside to pick it up after 20min. No one at check out stand for 5min. When someone arrives, says order isn't ready(this is now 10min after quotedpick up time). The bartender managing the togo orders makes excuses to pass blame around, instead of apologizing. The order arrives, it's the wrong freaking thing. It's a lobster sushi roll. I kinda understand the mix up, but purposefully tried to avoid that confusion when I ordered it. Bartender again, does not apologize, only makes excuses. I normally am the kind of person who doesn't mind ordering a drink and patiently waiting for togo food, but this wasn't an option because no parking. And also rude customer service: How am I supposed to want to spend even more money and tip a bartender who is being rude and dismissive of patrons. I did leave him a 13% tip on this atrocious togo order experience, despite the terrible service.\n\n I hope a manager sees and responds to this issue. I have worked in several restaurants and my partner is an executive chef, so this is not some high and mighty post. It's coming from KNOWING much better can be done.", "author": "Jessica R."}

Very disappointing meal.\n\nMy husband and I spent the afternoon at the DeYoung Museum so thought we'd grab dinner to avoid traffic heading home to Oakland. I remembered this place was close by and the food was always good so I suggested we eat here. Boy was I wrong! \n\nWe started with the scallop poke which was the seasonal menu appetizer. This sad dish looked like it had been sitting out all day--scallops looked dried out and definitely not fresh. There were little pieces of mango in the dish but there just wasn't much natural sweetness to the scallops so it isn't something I'd order again. I ordered the Chirashi which was literally $23 of old poke served on a platter of very little sushi rice. The ahi was gristly as all hell--I ended up spitting out 1/4 of it because I simply could not chew it down enough to swallow. Both the ahi and salmon looked days old and was very low quality raw fish. For being in San Francisco, I wouldn't even give this a rating of mediocre because it was far below that. My husband got the seared ahi salad. Again, ahi was subpar and too gristly to be enjoyable. The veggies in the salad, however, were extremely fresh and delicious. But come on, this isn't Pacific Veggies or a vegetarian restaurant. If I'm paying over $20 per entree for seafood I expect some quality grub! \n\nOverall vibe and ambiance of the restaurant was good. They've always been family friendly. We had our 2 month old baby so they gave us a big booth so I could have him sit next to me in his car seat. They offered us a high chair and brought the kids menu which had a decent selection of yummy items for the kiddos. Too bad my little one is still too small for solid food. Outside patio had lots of heaters and a fireplace so was toasty and warm. Service as expected was impeccable as always. We had someone clearing our plates as soon as we finished and the server was pleasant and helpful.

Now, I've been fasting for 2.5 days, (my eating disorder is a whole other story), so after 60 hours of not eating, I decided I should put some food in my belly before I pass out! \n\n11:03AM I arrive and the doors are locked. \n11:05AM a UPS man comes by to deliver some packages. Doors unlocked.\n11:09AM somebody props the door open and brings the signs out. I ask if they're open and they say yes, is it 11AM yet?\n\nI enter, and takes about 1 minute for somebody to tend to me, despite being the first customer there. I'm seated and provided menus.\n\nShortly after, a waitress came to see what I wanted to drink, but I have not looked at the menu yet, so I said water is fine and she left. She came back with water and complementary Edamame and Goldfish Pretzels. She leaves again to give me some time to decide on what I want.\n\nMy waitress comes back shortly. When I order, she decides to memorize it rather than write it down. I ordered the following:\n\nFOOD 3.75/5*\n++  Japanese Wasabi Pan-Asian Rice Bowl with Hawaiian Poke - $15 - 4/5 - wakame salad, avocado, daikon, sprouts, cucumber, ginger, sesame seeds, shredded nori and soy-wasabi sauce.\n=    This bowl was fairly good. Per other yelper's reviews, I asked for the soy wasabi sauce on the side, but I guess she forgot. The avocados were flavourless and not ripe, I guess they're not in season? Everything else was very delicious, the rice was a little bit on the tougher side. The Hawaiian Poke was quite fresh and delicious. \n\n++    2 Piece Fish and Chips with Sweet Potato Fries - $10 - 3/5 - When ordering this, there is a choice of regular, spicy, or sweet potato fries or a salad. Yelp says get the sweet potato fries! After ordering, the waitress returned and had to ask which fries I asked for. The presentation of this dish is quite cute. It comes on a newspaper themed wax/butcher paper. The fish wasn't very crispy. They were large slabs of fish, but after sitting there for under 5 minutes, the whole bottom side was soggy. No bueno. \n= The sweet potato fries were very very good when they came out hot. If you don't order the appetizer, it doesn't come with the ginger wasabi aioli, but it does come with the Thai chile sauce. Pairs really well with the Thai Chile sauce.\n\n++    Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale - $5.50 - 5/5 - YUM. Upon my first sip, I thought I was drinking an IPA, but then I looked down and saw it was a warm amber colour. Amber Pale Ale? The flavours were great, complex body, and hops off the end. Great beer, decently priced. \n\n**It's a weighted average.\n\nPRICE 3.5/5\nThe pricing is fairly average, but just a little bit on the pricier side. Nothing spectacular, but also pretty affordable for SF.\n\nSERVICE 4/5\nThe service was very very nice. My waitress smiled a lot, was very attentive. I saw in my peripheral that she would talk to the other waiters/waitresses but occasionally glance over to see I was still doing okay. She came over to see how everything wa around my half way point. Only thing is that she should have just written down my order so nothing was missed. (sauce on the side, sweet potato fries)\n\nROOM AND DECOR 5/5\nThere is plenty of seating, good for both intimate conversations and large groups. The decor is primarily fish paintings and sculptures. Very fitting.\n\nTIPS / NOTES:\n+ UCSF (students?) employees get 10% off\n+ They are currently running a $10 off if you pay with Paypal Mobile (the receipt will generate a code, you enter the code into your phone, and it'll pay them automatically. The app will first show the full amount, then after you submit it, it will send you a confirmation email or with the amount you paid as $10 less.)\n+ Happy hour: M-F 4-6 and M-Su 10pm-close.\n\n+Rice bowl recommended\n-Fish and Chips NOT recommended\n+Sweet potato fries recommended\n+Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale recommended\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food.

Perfectly marinated and placed on top of moist, sweet sushi rice and accompanied by Avocado, sprouts,  and ginger. You can even customize your bowls and choose which poke you want on top, as well as if you want everything on a bed of white or brown rice or salad. \n\nWhich poke is the best? Well, I have to say either the salmon or macadamia nut poke... Per the waitress,  the macadamia nut poke isn't marinated in the sauce,  but the sauce (sweetened ponzu + onions) is poured on top prior to serving.  Therefore, you get the taste of the fish without the overwhelming saltiness of the marinade. I knocked off a star because the salad I ordered was over dressed and was salty. \n\nService was great, even though the kitchen didn't tell her they were out of salmon poke until after they had already delivered our dinner plates. However, she apologized and I can tell she really did seek to find out what was going on with that whole situation even though it was the end of the night. \n\nDon't even ask me how the other food is...  Because I'm one of those types that can't get enough of a good thing and haven't ventured far enough to try anything else! \n\nOh - and get the Coconut Porter by Hawaii Brewing Company if you haven't had it yet and are a fan of porters...

The poke trio also comes with wonton chips, a small salad, and a delicious seaweed salad. \n\nFor entrees we've had the poke salad (amazing), the Thai curry bowl with salmon (also amazing it was one of the best salmons I've ever had), and the teriyaki bowl with steak.

It sucks when such an awesome establishment begins to forget about customer service and genuinely appreciating their customers. It was awful being met with such rude states and bad service.", "author": "Vincent H."}

I had not heard of this restaurant but another SF friend of theirs suggested it as a good place to grab dinner.\n\nFREQUENCY: This was my first time dining at this establishment.\n\nFOOD: I ordered a poki bowl as my entree which was good. It took our food a little long to come out but the waitress gave us a free order of calamari to make up for that. The calamari was also tasty. My friends that ordered dishes other than poke bowls also seemed to enjoy their food. One of the girls ordered a desert which we all had a few spoonfuls of and again that was good. Overall the food was satisfactory. It's not the best poki bowl or calamari I'd ever had but it also wasn't bad. If you aren't looking to be blown away by the food you're eating then this place is just fine.\n\nDRINK: Pacific Catch had a nice selection of alcoholic and fountain drinks. Most of us ordered beer or wine. I always appreciate a restaurant that has several beer styles and brands from different parts of the country. I think the offering was pretty standard for what you'd expect at a restaurant. I'm sure they offer happy hour specials but I'm not sure what they are since I wasn't dining at that time. They also have a bar where you can sit to order drinks.\n\nATMOSPHERE: I wouldn't say anything really stood out about the atmosphere. I was dining at 7 PM on a Sunday so there was a pretty good crowd. Just kind of your standard restaurant decoration and layout.\n\nSTAFF: The waitress was very friendly. As I mentioned, she offered us a free appetizer since our food was taking a while and we never complained about the wait. She came by regularly to make sure we were fine but didn't overly bother us. There was plenty of other staff but I didn't interact with many besides the waitress.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nThis was a nice spot to catch up with some friends over dinner. The food wasn't anything out of the ordinary but it was good. I don't think I would go out of my way to go here again or add it to my list of place I have to bring visitors. But I wouldn't be upset if I stopped in because I was in the area or someone else suggested it.", "author": "Christopher D."}

An otherwise healthy balanced dish with a good variety of veggies, protein, and carbs was drenched in too much sauce. The portion is very generous and it'd be a perfect, perfect dish if they laid off on the sauce a bit. \n\nI will definitely come back here again and maybe ask for sauce on the side or light sauce for the bowls and try the other poke.

Even if I got bad experience usually I share it with my friends only. Nothing would be different with the Pacific Catch restaurant... but today morning they just removed my comment on FB. It was negative but honest... I personally think that business should talk with the customer who is by the way always right. That's why I decided to share this with people on Yelp. It was more than a year ago but still really fresh for my family.\nLet me try to make stressful and ugly long story shorter but still horrible. First of all I should say we, my wife and I, are huge seafood fans. A few years ago on Hawaii we were introduced to Poke. It quickly became our food crush... Once we got back to San Francisco we immediately started to look for Poke here. Our friends brought us to the Pacific Catch restaurant on 9th Ave in San Francisco. To be honest we fallen in love... Beautiful place, great location and POKE!!!!! We were absolutely happy! Then it became a nightmare. A few weeks later we were going to celebrate something with my wife. I proposed to buy a Poke. The children went to sleep. My wife lighted the candles. I brought a Poke. What else you can dream about? I thought nothing could ruin such a beautiful evening... I was wrong... Fish parasites were on our salmon poke. Alive Worms!!! I immediately returned the meal. I tried to talk with the restaurant about the compensation but no avail.

I've gone to the PC in San Mateo frequently, and decided to take my family here on a Sunday early evening. None of them had been before so thought they should give it a try. Our waiter Jesse was great! Very personable, and somehow convinced the table to try about half the dessert menu (all of which are amazing btw; highly recommend the spring roll and the mochi). Also, my dad loved it. He never tries new places, and rarely gives a positive review. That's an accomplishment within itself! While he was a little disappointed about them running out of french fries, he said the fish and chips and the salad were excellent. Thanks for a great meal and great service!", "author": "Jessi S."}

After the first disaster at the 9th ave location let me recap my first visit with a short version. Here goes: We were seated way in the back of the main dining room where no other customers were. Everyone seemed to be in the bar area. We were forgotten. after a 25 minute wait the waitress finally came by to take our order. 30 more minutes and our ( cold ) order came and they messed it up. by this time we were over it and wanted to leave . Told the waitress we are leaving. the manager came over and half heartedly said he was sorry and gave me a fee dinner card. He said ask for him and he will personally  seat us and take our order. So we went back a few weeks later. Asked for the manager and told the greeter what he had said to us about him taking care of us. She found him and talked to him and he looked over at us and told her he was too busy. We just walked out and I vowed not to go back. \n\n Fast forward to tonight 10/23/16 and a friend really wanted to eat there. so i said fine but I had already eaten. So we get seated. I wanted a appetizer and she got fish tacos. The waitress comes back and says the kitchen is out of rice for sushi. No biggie I wasn't that hungry anyway. I had told her my horror story of this place but she said she had a good experience here. Well her tacos come. the Mahi was not cooked and was raw and cold in the center.  The french fries were half cooked and cold and limp. When the waitress came back to check on us my friend let her know the tacos were not cooked nor the fries. She says : Yeah the fries did not look good when I brought them out . I was like: well why did you bring out food you knew was not cooked ? She was honest in her apology and nice. But still who serves food they know is under cooked ? She said they were slammed and the cooks were rushing. The New manager came over and was apologetic too and nice. I never had a good meal here ever. My friend says she will not come back and said now believes me about my old story. Advice. Go to the Marina location on Chestnut.", "author": "Jerry A."}

His wife can be kinda picky about food and was craving some fancy fish, so we headed to Pacific Catch.\n\nWe shared an order of their fried oyster appetizer, which I thought were quite delicious.  They were a tad oily, but crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  I got their poke rice bowl with brown rice, and it turned out to be a huge meal.  There was a good amount of poke and avo, as well as nori and ginger, as well as a ton of rice.  The ratio of rice to everything else was a little high, and I wish that there was a little sauce included because the dish ate kind of dry.

It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and the nearest place where there are notably tons of great eclectic spots to eat, was in the inner sunset district along Irving and 9th. Right on the corner of 9th and Lincoln is Pacific Catch, you cannot miss it. Parking can be a little difficult to find especially on weekends, but it was just our luck that we found a spot right in front. They say the law of attraction can make things happen & that's exactly what happened as my hubby and I were claiming a close spot beforehand. And on top of that, the meters said free parking, which is normally in service on Sundays. Made us feel like we won the lottery!!\n\nAnyways, we were seated right away since it was mid-afternoon and not so crowded. The boys had kids meals: fish and chips and fish tacos. The mister and I shared the white tuna Poke, served with fried wontons. Then we both ordered mix & match tacos. I chose mahi mahi, shrimp, and steak. Hubby chose baja (fried cod), mahi mahi, and steak as well. We each ordered them with a side of fries--spicy and sweet potato. Everything was pretty much devoured really quickly, even my boys cleaned up their plates which is really rare. Either they were just hungry or they loved it, turns out to both.The only flip-side to it was that there was some damage done to our wallets. Total cost for a family of four came out to almost $80 including tax. We always try to eat where we can afford within our means, but today, I guess you can say it was a special treat:) Otherwise, be prepared to dish out some money for good seafood or save this place for special occasions.", "author": "Dahlia C."}

The service was fast, but servers turn away fast and not much enthusiasm serving. The whole restaurant was big and open. I ordered an original Poke and grill salmon teriyaki rice bowl. The poke was not so fresh, darker than the ones I ate at the Marina Store, and not as chewy. The Salmon was alright, but the rice was too sticky and the sauce was too sour. I ended up packing up almost the whole rice bowl and brought it home to cook it over. \n\nMaybe this is just individual case, but I feel like although Marina store is much smaller than here, but I'd say Marina is serving in better quality.", "author": "Yuyang Z."}

You can see  all ages and all kind of groups of people, from families with babies to ones with  older parents and everyone in between.  Groups of friends, ages from  20 something to seniors.\n\nWe really loved the sweet potato fries for an appetizer.

They came with avocado and lettuce, a small bowl of beans on the side, and you could have an option of fries or salad with it.  There were 2 tacos on a plate.  I don't like huge portions, so this was plenty.\n\n My husband had a bowl of grilled mahi mahi with brown rice, roasted pineapple, caramelized onions and shaved coconut.

Pretty cool, although I've seen it before (at an Italian Seafood place, on Irving and 9th, not far from this one.)\n\nCons:  The California roll that my daughter ordered was a bit dry. It also was overpriced at $9.  The wine was overpriced too, at $9 a glass, and it wasn't that much wine in the glass.  Also, they were out of one of Hawaiian Poke tonight - spiced tofu.\n\nNevertheless, we enjoyed our dinner and definitely will be back.", "author": "Michelle R."}

We sat near the bar/lounge area; this is a great spot for a good picture if you're a crazy insta-food-ographer like myself #guilty\n\nWe ordered the California Style Poke, Marinated Skirt Steak Rice Bowl, Hawaiian Poke Rice Bowl, and Firecracker Salmon Roll. We finished majority of it all, yes we did (no shame, I'm tellin' you.) But anyway, I really enjoy their poke, the wonton chips that comes with it was soooo crunchy and thinly cut, it melted in my mouth (a little exaggeration there, but nevertheless, I loved it). PERFECT!\n\nThe rice bowl, however, was not as impressive especially for the price of it. I thought my rice bowl was way too overflowing with sauce, which made it so much saltier than it should taste and let me tell you, I am not a big fan of salty food. Not only that, the stuff that comes in it was nothing out of the ordinary. My friend said the same thing regarding the Hawaiian Poke Rice Bowl =/ \n\nWe've also ordered drinks as well and I believe we got the Agave Margarita and Pacific Catch Mai Tai. Not too sure if these were the drinks but it balances out the food we ate and helped extract the saltiness in the rice bowl, which is a good thing I guess? \n\nOther than that, I will come back and try other poke because I am a huge fan of poke!", "author": "Anna L."}

If you are a trendy seafood restaurant named \"Pacific Catch Fresh Fish Grill\" in the SF Marina, wouldn't you want to show off the freshness of your fish instead of drenching your dishes in seasoning that masks all flavor?\n\nWith that being said, I think they still make enough money to stay open because they only give you ~1/4 cup of who-knows-how-high-qualify fish for like $12. The rest is all fried wonton crisps (even fried nori chips would make the meal feel slightly more worth it). And that's for the poke, one of the cheaper and more popular options the restaurant pushes. My brain hurt from trying to rationalize why I essentially paid $16 for mayo and chips. \n\nNobody in my group of 5 (who each got poke) was able to finish their very meager serving of food...

The food was delicious, and probably deserves an extra star because it's a chain.  We had two salmon specials, fish / chips, and a rice bowl.  The fish entrees were delicious.  The rice bowl was a little heavy in the sauce (sort of common in restaurants).  The \"sticky\" ribs were tasty but a little tough in the eating.  Service was meh, our waiter was sort of mia.  There was a bit of a wait, but it was worthwhile.", "author": "L S."}

Went late in the afternoon and there wasn't any wait to be seated. I ordered the shrimp ceviche and the spicy tuna roll. Even though they gave us complimentary edamame and crackers while we waited for our food, the wait was excruciatingly long. It took about 20 minutes to get our food. When the food arrived I concluded that the waitress must've heard my order wrong because she gave sweet potato fries instead of the spicy tuna roll. When I told her that they got my order wrong, she generously gave me the sweet potato fries on the house. \n\nThe shrimp ceviche with avocado was delicious! It had a lot of flavor to it and the portion was generous as well. The spicy tuna roll was delicious too except for the fact that they put watercress in it (yuck). The sweet potatoes were my favorite! It was lightly salted and it came with a cream wasabi and sweet&sour sauce. \n\nFour stars because I think the service is great but prices are a little too steep. I understand that it's seafood and that's always gonna be expensive but the ceviche and sushi roll cost me 9 dollars each! \n\nOverall, this place is worth coming to. The quality of the food and the service is great.", "author": "Lisa H."}

YUM!! At most restaurants, they don't put enough dressing. At Pacific Catch, my salad was overly drenched in dressing... but that's okay. The salad itself was HUGE. So filling.

The atmosphere is pleasant and not too loud even when full.\n\nI ordered a Thai coconut shrimp soup and the fish of the day served with a baked artichoke.  Both dishes had excellent flavor with some unique notes that I hadn't expected, but everything was incredibly salty.  I normally like a lot of salt in my meals, but between the salty soup, salty fish, and salt-crusted artichoke, it was just too much.  Maybe it would have been tolerable if only one of the dishes was salty, but even still I think it would have been unpleasant.  This was unfortunate because the other flavors of the meal were great and the service was wonderful too.  I would definitely give them another shot (maybe the chef's taste buds were a bit off that day?) but I can't recommend it as a sure bet.", "author": "Robert F."}

I can't emphasize enough how tender it is because so many other places I've been the calamari is chewy bleh! I also love the chipotle chili aioli they serve as a dipping sauce (has a very slight kick) that compliments the calamari really well. Would order again and recommend you try it.\n\nI'll call it the \"Fried Variety Basket\" because I forgot what it's called on the menu: comes with two pieces of lightly breaded and deep fried cod, 3 coconut shrimps, 3 fried oysters, and your choice of fries, seasoned fries, sweet potatoe fries, or a side salad. Sweet potatoe fries are on point! And the fried oysters were the star of this entree. I would come back and just order the basket of fried oysters!! Shrimp was also good, but the cod was bland. Also the little cole slaw side they have I could live without (too much  onion for my liking) but onto the next..\n\nWasabi Ahi Bowl: this dish alone would be enough to bring me back. It's honestly like a deconstructed sushirrito in a big ass bowl. I know it can seem daunting that it's $15 but it's worth it especially because it's enough for two people to share. Fish is very fresh and it was just great.\n\nTried to do the \"pay with Paypal and get $10 off your meal deal\" but it was conveniently not working for us.. Hmmm. \n\nBut still..

The sandwiches now come with a small coleslaw and a choice of fries (it used to be only coleslaw). And now they have four Pan-Asian rice bowls to choose from: Japanese, Korean, Hawaiian, and Thai (it used to be only Japanese and Hawaiian). I've dined here plenty of times that I can safely say that you can't go wrong with their Japanese wasabi bowl with either poke or ahi tuna! Of the four to choose from, the Japanese one is definitely my favorite because of the seaweed salad and fresh avocado. There's hints of wasabi flavor fused in, yet it's not too strong that I find it unbearable. Also, you can substitute the white rice for brown rice and/or greens for a healthier option.\n\nOverall, the restaurant is quite large and spacious. The chairs are very comfy as well. I find the tables are a bit taller at the bar seating area as I have to stretch my torso in order to eat my meal. Service is still hit or miss, depending whether it's peak hours or not.

It wasn't even until the third time did I realize they had a parking lot next to the restaurant! How handy! Such a rare find in San Francisco. \n\nFish & Chips: Everyone loves these but I don't think its their best thing there. You should definitely get 4 pieces though since its $14 and 2 pieces is already $10. The pieces of fish aren't that big. I love the sauces it comes with but the Jalapeno Tartar sauce was never spicy to me. I think the coleslaw side is far too small as well but I love their sweet potato fries (the only reason I wanted to come in the first place haha)\n\nCalifornia Roll Salad: I love this salad! Although I had it at every meal and I got kind of sick of it at the end. The salad is huge and you'll probably have a hard time finishing it. It comes with a ton of avocado and a even bigger mound of real crab. It really does taste like a california roll! I think its around $13. \n\nHawaiian Poke Brown Rice Bowl: I never would've thought of ordering this if it wasn't for Yelp! I'm eating it right now as I type. I had a ton leftover because it wasn't the best thing to eat yesterday morning hungover! By far my favorite thing from Pacific Catch. You can also get it with white rice or 1/2 rice & 1/2 greens. \n\nMochi Fondue: Nothing special. Just 3 mochi balls cut in half and a little bowl of tasty melty chocolate to dip it in. There was way too much chocolate in the bowl though and I felt bad for wasting it. I don't think its worth the money since it isn't very creative and you could just make the same thing yourself for far less. \n\nThere is never a wait when I go. My friend and I were about to get dinner at the Presidio location until we drove by it noticed how tiny and packed it was. We just drove all the way to the 9th street location. This location is huge.

The food was mediocre at the very best and forgettable.\n\nOn Friday, 5.27.11, I came to Pacific Catch for my friend's Birthday Dinner. We had reservations for a party of 14 at 7 pm. Upon arrival, it took about 5-7 minutes for them to set up our table and be seated.\n\nF O O D:\nThis time I did my due diligence and made sure I looked at the other Yelper's reviews to see what to order. The Poke and Sweet Potato Fries were overwhelming mentioned in many reviews, so I decided to entrust in my fellow Yelpers and I was not disappointed. Thank you, Yelpers!\n\n*HAWAIIAN POKE WASABI BOWL w/ Tobiko & Brown Rice ($14.95 +$2 for Tobiko):  YUMMY!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3bxO8T8U96uKu2numljjsw?select=GXy8_YmqbfOJ6fPhUrOi7w\n\nThe poke was hands down the BEST I've ever had! The thick chunks of tuna were uber fresh, tender and succulent. The soy wasabi sauce, albeit a bit salty, gave the tuna a nice savory sweet flavor with a hint of spice while the sesame seeds and roasted nori gave it a touch of nuttiness. The accoutrements of wakame salad, daikon sprouts, cucumber, and ginger were all very fresh and crisp. The brown rice, however, was undercooked and hard.\n\n*SWEET POTATO FRIES ($3.50 for a Side Order): DANGEROUSLY ADDICTING!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3bxO8T8U96uKu2numljjsw?select=neBvXM0nJIZivB8_tiEe7g\n\nThe fresh-out-of the fryer sweet potato fries were crispy throughout with a soft, fluffy center. The light sprinkle of salt brought out the natural sweetness of the potatoes. There were two accompanying sauces: Thai Sweet Chili and Wasabi Aioli. I preferred the Wasabi Aioli as it added a layer of creaminess with a slight nose tingle from the wasabi.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nVery friendly but slow which is understandable because we were in a large party and the restaurant was packed. Nevertheless, the staff did a good job making sure everyone got their entrees at the same time although the last three took 5 minutes longer than the others. I did have to ask several times for my water glass to be refilled so perhaps leaving a water pitcher for larger parties may be a good idea.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nContemporary and fun; Pacific Catch is good for casual lunch and dinners. Since it's a large restaurant, it's also good for large parties. The noise level is very, very loud though so it's very likely you'll have to scream across the table if you want to be heard.\n\nP A R K I N G:\nAlthough Pacific Catch has a small lot with a 10-car capacity, getting a parking space in that lot is like hitting the jackpot. Street parking is no easy task either so make sure to allot an extra 15 minutes to find parking. Your best bet is looking for parking at Golden Gate Park which is just across the street. \n\nThe is one of the few times that Yelpers didn't lead me astray, so if you're coming to Pacific Catch, definitely order the Poke and Sweet Potato Fries.

My son ordered a seafood chowder and I ordered the crab sandwich.  My sandwich was basically a tuna sandwich, but made with crab instead.  It was so good.

Then, we proceeded to sit at our table for another 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we were sitting there, even though multiple servers had passed our table a few times. \nWhen our waitress finally realized we were sitting in her section, she basically told us that she didn't know we were there and that she didn't know that we were seated in her section, when in reality she had passed our table at least 5 times previously. So, we placed our orders, which did come out in a reasonable amount of time. Our waitress, on the other hand, hardly ever checked on us for refills, and my friend had to get up and find the pitchers to refill our drinks. She didn't even bring condiments for our food so we had to get that as well. \n\nAt least the food is good. The poke is really tasty, and the tacos are really good.

I don't have really any complaints about this place, but truthfully, I don't have a ton of praise either. It gives you pretty decent food at an okay price, but I probably wouldn't advocate coming here if the choice was up to me. There's a lot of really great stuff out there. But the great thing about Pacific Catch is that everyone can probably find something on the menu they'll be OK with, even if they're not big on seafood. So I guess Pacific Catch is the best way to compromise when you have a group of people who can't ever agree on what to eat.\n\nSee, Pacific Catch is sort of an \"Anywhere-near-water fusion\" style restaurant, so you can get a little bit of Hawaiian food, a little bit of Japanese food, a little bit of Thai food, and not all of it involving seafood, either. I always get the green curry with chicken here and it's good. I could get resoundingly better green curry at an actual Thai place, but then my buddy couldn't get his poke while sitting right next to me, while my other friend gets calamari. It's an ironically good place for people to come if they like seafood but their friends don't. \n\nSo stop by! Or don't.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-23", "description": "Very mixed feelings about this place. The good: fish tacos, sweet potato fries and their Happy Hour.\n\nThe bad: I was served a taco containing a 1/4\" chunk of hard plastic (nearly as hard as metal, not soft plastic). I discovered this on my first bite, and it hurt the hell out of my crown and upper tooth for many days.\n\nThe worse: when the \"manager\" came over to deal with it, she looked at the remains of what I had to spit out and said \"oh, that shouldn't be in there, we'll make you a new one,\" and that was it. No \"wow, are you hurt?\" or anything even feigning empathy.\n\nTo their credit, I did get a replacement taco that DIDN'T have a dangerous foreign object inside, that was awesome. Even more awesome after being ignored for the next half hour after food delivery was they took an entire twelve dollars off the bill for nearly requiring me to do an emergency visit to the dentist (or possibly the hospital had I swallowed). \n\nTheir response was appropriate for an instance where they served the wrong drink, not where they served contaminated and dangerous food that caused injury. We were stunned and almost amused at the level of their tone-deafness.\n\nThe \"real\" manager came by after we had paid and briefly discussed it then tried to take my money again. Then the kitchen chef came by and actually apologized and showed some empathy for what had happened, but at that point it was too little and far too late. But he was the one guy who seemed to give a damn about what their mistake did.\n\nI have given it a couple weeks before writing this. Wrote a note to to their corporate headquarters while still at the table and later received back some mumbo-jumbo that didn't really indicate they gave a sh_t. They also promised to get back to me but they didn't. \n\n-------\nUPDATE: Within a day of posting this review, I finally heard back from them (thanks, power of social media...). I'll bump it up a star just because I got the sense that management is aware of ongoing issues at this location and the guy was real with me. The food is decent, location good and prices reasonable, I would really like this place to succeed and never put anyone else through this (or worse). Not sure if I will return, but I hope for everyone's sake this is a turning point where they wake up and fix the service issues that I and others have been yelping about.", "author": "T J."}

I was a bit concerned about the experience based off the photos on Yelp and their website, as it was very swanky, and worried for all fluff no stuff. I am glad that we gave this place a try after a wonderful day at the CA Academy of Sciences.  I had the Hawaiian punch and poke rice bowl. I strongly suggest the punch if you are a lightweight drinker like me, as it tastes great and not overpowering with alcohol, but I got a fun buzz.  We shared the spicy salmon roll for an appetizer and Chef was nice enough to serve it raw instead of frying it (so we could avoid my shrimp allergy). I originally laughed at the idea of ordering a rice bowl with only half rice and half salad, but after eating the bowl, I see why. I am a huge rice eater and still had most of the rice at the end of the meal. Tip: If you order a rice bowl, order half rice half salad, and ask for extra hot sauce if you prefer more heat.\n\nI will definitely swing by for lunch the next time I am in the area.

We always get together with our Niece that lives in San Francisco for a meal. I had heard about this place from her, she has been to one of their restaurants with her dad.  This one is off Lincoln on 9th av.  I checked it out online and it looked good, so we made a date.  They also had a nice selection of specials not on the website.  The restaurant is very nice and roomy inside.  Not too noisy.  The staff was great.  Our waiter was very attentive.  Our water was never empty and he kept checking on us every few minutes.  The food... Knocked it out of the park.  It is a seafood place but they do offer chicken, ribs, and steak dishes.   As it is called \"Pacific Catch\" the food reflects different flavors of the Pacific Rim.  I like flavorful and spice in my food, but I do not like HEAT.  The waiter assured me it would not be too much heat. I love deep fried fish and chips.  I try them everywhere I go.  I went for the \"mixed catch basket\".  Deep fried alaskan cod, deep fried coconut shrimp and deep fried oysters. I really am not a fan of fried oysters.... but I was so surprised ... these were wonderful.  And it came with two dipping sauces,  jalape\u00f1o tartar and  thai sweet chili.  As well with fries and coleslaw.  This was one of the best deep fried fish I had ever had.  It was obviously FRESH EVERY THING.  On the daily special menu they had Tom Yam soup.  Tom yam is a coconut milk base Thai soup, and a favorite of mine.  A rich broth with shrimp, tomatoes, mushrooms, and traditional Thai seasonings.  I could have eaten 6 bowls.  Everyone at the table tasted it, everyone loved it.  We all shared a chocolate cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert.  $127.00 for four people with drinks and apps and the dessert.  Very reasonable for the quality and amount of food.

The romaine lettuce and carrots provided a great crunchy texture, while the avocado provided a rich and creamy element to the salad. The salad was not overdressed, which is a definite plus. The Ahi tuna poke, although well marinated, would have benefitted from an additional splash of rice vinegar; as the soy and sesame marinade resulted in a one-dimensional tasting poke.\n\nOverall, the food is good.

The outside and inside ambiance was quite inviting, unlike the host that did not even acknowledge us as we walked in. After she seated the party that arrived AFTER us, we were seated and greeted by our waiter with a bowl of semi frozen edamame and pretzel goldfish. We ordered the clam chowder, and side salad. The clam chowder was lukewarm, and when we requested some bread (which should be expected with chowder in San Fran) they brought us untoasted ciabatta. It took almost 10 minutes to come and by that time the soup was cold, it was just sad. The salad was underdressed and tasted unwashed to be totally honest. Also tried the poke, which was decent with a side of partially stale wontons. Seems like they don't put much effort or care into the food and service quality because most of their customers are tourists, and won't be returning anyways. 10/10 would not recommend - better restaurants a block away.", "author": "Natalia D."}

Extremely friendly and fast service immediately upon arrival.

I ordered the Mixed Catch Basket, which came with fried oysters, cod, and coconut shrimp.  I loved the oysters.  I don't care where you order cod, it's the blandest fish of all whitefish.  So, its lackluster showing was totally expected.  The coconut shrimp was tasty.  The spicy fries are bomb-diggity!  Especially when dipped in the basket's accompanying jalapeno aioli.

I've heard mixed reviews from people I knew. but, my boyfriend said he's been here many times and said it was good. \nwe came around 11, right when they open and it was getting relatively busy! so I'm taking that as a good thing. as we browsed through the menu, he mentioned that the sweet potato fries were a must. I love sweet potato fries, so.... why not! they were delicious with two choices of sauces. a sweet and tangy sauce(usually eaten with egg rolls) and a wasabi ginger kind. I wasn't a big fan of wasabi or ginger haha. but the fries were yummy! then we ordered salmon poke. the salmon was nicely seasoned with small cuts of avocado too. it was with a side of crispy wonton chips to compliment the appetizer even more. it had a nice refreshing flavor. then...... onto the main course! I ordered the Hawaiian teriyaki pan Asian bowl with grilled chicken. they had the option to change the white rice to 1/2 brown rice and 1/2 salad. so that's what I did. I didn't know the bowl was going to be so huge.... omg. it came with crispy onions, mushrooms, grilled pineapple, carrots. it wasn't too overly sauced, but the chicken tasted very chewy. I don't know, it was weird. haha. but everything else in the bowl was good. my boyfriend ordered the Korean bbq bowl with white rice and sticky ribs. let me tell you.... the ribs were PRETTY sticky, hahah. we both barely even touched our bowls because we were so filled up on the two appetizers.. but we took them to go. and for two appetizers and two main courses, the total only came out to be $50! so I thought that was a good deal. the presentation of each dish was really presentable and nicely put together. the interior of the place was huge and you could opt for outdoor seating too.

Dinner took a while, maybe 35 minutes, but not surpising given how full the place was.\n\nThen the maitre'd came out, and apologized: they had run out of salmon.  Could I order something else?  Sure, why not; I ordered what I'd been planning to order before I saw the salmon specials: the mahi-mahi sandwich.  So yeah, it came out a bit late, but  whatever.\n\nSo given how apologetic they were, I was expecting that they'd comp us the sandwich or maybe a beer, and I would have been happy with that.

First of all, the spicy tuna was a pale pink. I ate a piece and it literally tasted like glue or more like flour stirred in with water to make some sort of paste. It was difficult to swallow let alone even more difficult to digest. I'm feeling sick just thinking about it. Then the fish and chips..how the heck do you mess it up? Seriously, it's all fried! Nope, everything was cold and soggy. You could still see the puddles of oil disintegrated into the fish and fries. The slaw on the side was warm and looked like it was sitting out all day.

The fav on the first visit.\n- California style: creamy and really good, with avocado (winner!  And when I went back with another group, it was the unanimous winner among those who tried it on the second visit.)\n- Creamy Spicy: skip it.

I love food that  reminds me of fresh fish and seafood and Hawaii so I can pretend that I'm in Hawaii. My absolute fave is the Ecstasy roll. I am not a raw fish or food person but this is so delicious I believe it's tuna and salmon with avocado wrapped in seaweed and just a couple of tempura flakes and like a one second flash fry which crisps up the seaweed skin while keeping the fish raw. It's sitting in a yummy sauce but best of all (drum roll....) NO RICE. Delicious choice for the folks low carb in it.....the shrimp ceviche is also an excellent choice very Limey. They do not cook the shrimp but it cooks itself up in the lime juice. Must be a chemical reaction how marvelous. I never knew that, how cool. I've actually never ordered anything else besides these 2 things. The Mai tais are great!!! And strong!!! I love drinking here in the sunset and eating sushi. Nice cocktails.

I used to live in the Marina and either eat at that Pacific Catch or get take out from there a couple times a month. Hawaiian teriyaki was my sunshine on a bad day. I was loyal.\n\nSo after almost a year of PC deprivation, I was a little tipsy and extremely excited for my culinary journey. We got some spicy fries and the california poke to start, and they were delicious. Our very friendly waitress brought us out some extra aioli for our fries since we ran through the first one quickly, due to deliciousness. Love the crab in the california poke, and the wonton chips were good ones. Ordered our mains, and when they came out to us, I was freaked out. Where was my pineapple, my crispy onions, my mushrooms and edamame? Oh shit. Had I ordered the wrong thing? Had she maybe made a mistake? She came back to check on us and I said that I had meant to get the hawaiian teriyaki bowl, not the korean barbeque. She apologized for her mistake and snatched up the bowl to bring back. After she left, I became more and more sure that I had said Korean BBQ instead of Hawaiian teriyaki. Yep, yep, yep, I definitely just did that. Would I have done that again? Probably. I really wanted that freaking bowl, I had thought about it for a while, and I couldn't have possibly eaten anything else. Our waitress was SO INCREDIBLY NICE about it, and kept putting it on herself, until I finally admitted my mistake when she brought out the Hawaiian Teriyaki bowl. She laughed it off and said NBD. I didn't catch her name but she had medium length straight brown hair in a ponytail, average height, and waited on us at the table right near the hostess station... A very unhelpful description but I hope the restaurant knows how great of a meal facilitator she is!\n\nAs I sit here, writing this review and eating my leftover Hawaiian Teriyaki bowl, I am glad there are people out there like our waitress.

I can't believe I only tried this place now. \n\nFirst of all, I love that they have a variety of \"Pacific Rim\" cuisine.  Everything from Hawaiian to Japanese to Korean, we actually tried a bit of all three.  We came on a Wednesday evening (just missed the Happy Hour). We started with the Korean Sticky Ribs. That was tasty but a bit messy (it's nice they have napkins and wet naps to clean off your hands).  We then ordered the Sunset Sushi Roll (which comes in 8 pieces) and Poke Fest Trio (we tried the original, California, and the Macadamia Nut).  I personally liked the Macadamia Nut and Original Poke. I think the California Poke was too citrusy (is that a word).  \n\nI definitely want to try their happy hour (see what deals I can get). They have happy hour both from 4-6 M-F and 10-close! Great for those late night eats. Also, I have to try their rice bowl. From what I saw, they are HUGE! \n\nOur server (forgot her name) was real nice and pretty attentive.

This place was ideal since it was walking distance to GG park, which we were headed to after lunch.\n\nWe picked out a couple of items and decided to share.  \n\nThe sweet potato fries were recommended by Eileen H.

(a side order is enough for two people)\n\nThe California roll was made with real crab but surprisingly lacking in flavor.  I've never been so thankful for soy sauce to dip it in.\n\nOn to the poke dish -- huge chunks of ahi tuna perfectly marinated in a soy sesame dressing.  It'll be easier to chew on it if the cut was smaller, but I shouldn't complain because I got my money's worth on that dish. \n\nSave your $4.95 on the grilled yellowtail taco. (it was a special for that day) The taco was small and the fish was overwhelmed with all the other trimmings in there. \n\nMy mom loved her grilled mahi mahi with pineapple salsa. Served with a side of bok choy, onion strings and a big scoop of rice.  She couldn't finish this dish, not because it wasn't delicious, but the portions were so huge!\n\nService is very good, both from our waitress and the bussers, constantly refilling water and taking away used dishes. \n\nI'm curious about their happy hour, so I may come back for that!", "author": "Janice C."}

I guess runners wanted deep fried goodness after their runs (who can blame them?).\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared the grilled ahi tuna rice bowl with extra fish and brown rice. They even split the bowl for us into two servings! We also shared the Peruvian ceviche. I have to say the ceviche wasn't their finest hour. The fish wasn't raw and the sauce was oily.

They were mushy and came with a bad-Chinese-restaurant-style dipping sauce.  We then had the Japanese rice bowl with poke and seared ahi as well as the miso salmon (also from the specials menu). The rice bowl had great flavors- daikon, cucumber, sesame seeds and wasabi. The poke was definitely the better protein. (I've previously had the thai-flavored rice bowl and have to say the Japanese one has a much better flavor profile). The miso salmon was just average, not that interesting, cooked fine, but overall not much to write about.\n\nThe agave lemonade and the mint and lime \"nojito\" were also just forgettable drinks. They tasted like average watery lemonade and flavored soda water, respectively.\n\nOverall, the meal was fairly bleh to average (which we count as two stars) but pricey for just average mains ($18-$20).

But this one in particular, I was so excited to go that would eat the whole freakin menu. I even fought my boyfriend to come to this one. I really had high expectations! I wouldn't even give a star if I had an option to do so. Anyways, to make this clear.\nAs soon as I walked in I wasn't even greeted. I had to ask a table for two and a young girl (host)looked at me with disgust. I guess I was a little \"beach dirty\" but anyways. So my first though was like whatever this might not be the hosts day. She then walked me to this awkward part of the restaurant and sat me on the smallest table every. It's not even busy to begin with! Anyways I politely asked if we can have a booth. She looked at me with annoyance as if I'm asking to much. Then she turned her head to look at the booths and she then turn to me and said sorry that for bigger parties for later in a way where she didn't not wanna deal with us at all.  \nI didn't think about till now... But I should've asked when they will be coming. \nSo now I got the menu. I went to the bathroom. Got back I see two glasses of water with out ice. It's a hot day and I looked around and every table has ICE water. I been server and I never served water without ice unless it's requested. \nFrom there I was just confused of what and why this is happening that I didn't even wanna look at the menu. The sever seemed like she didn't even wanna deal with use either. I've never had service like in my life.\nTo add on. I was making a review while I was in there....

We came on a Sunday around 6:30PM and sat at the bar because we wanted to watch NBA finals. It was pretty busy but we got lucky because there was one table open. I can't speak for the normal seating area but the bar area is really nice! They had seasonal and fresh drinks that looked really good too.  I had the Japanese Wasabi rice bowl with Hawaiian poke. SO GOOD. Everything about it was perfect, I highly recommend it. It had the perfect amount of wasabi, soy sauce and the poke was really fresh. Service was bit slow but it was really busy and we were pretty distracted by the game so it didn't ruin our experience at all!\n\nP.S.

Was in the area with good friends to try it out.\n\nFood:\n\n-Cabo Calamari:  this was some tasty calimari! could have been crispier though.  the chipotle aioli was quite unique and had just the right amount of heat in it.  \n\n-Mixed Catch Basket: a variety of fried fish, coconut shrimp, and fried oyster with fries.  some people wanted sweet potato fries and others wanted regular fries, the waitress was very nice in letting us get 1/2 portion of each so that everyone could be happy =]  the coconut shrimps were especially tasty and crispy on the outside, with the right balance of sweet and saltyness.  the other fried items were average.\n\n-Japanese Wasabi Rice Bowl [Hawaiian Ahi Poke]: there was a good amount of food on this dish, with a great mix of seaweed salad, shreded nori, sprouts, etc.  the ahi was fresh tasting and flavorful, however they could have done with less salt/soy sauce.  it made me very thristy, and the waitress did not come by to refill water.   although i did not taste the wasabi, the dish tasted savory/meaty.   I dont know if this was intentional, but the rice was cold, and a little hard..\n\n- Special of the Day: Escolar with mashed potatoes and spinach:  this was the best dish of the bunch.   The fish was cooked to perfection, did not taste \"fishy\" and was nicely complemented by a mango-salsa type topping.  The mashed potatoes tasted buttery and fresh.  The spinach was garlicy, which is nice, and not grainy.  The amount of food you get for the price however is not worth it.\n\n\nService:\n\n- the waitress was very friendly and made good suggestions on the type of food, splitting the fries, etc.  however we did not recieve any service after we got our food.  the water was not refilled until half an hour after it was empty, we were waiting a good 10 minutes before we could even get the bill.  \n\n\n3 Stars:\nOverall, I would maaaybe come back here if someone invited me (because of the above average food), but otherwise the price for the amount of food is not worth it, and the service is sub-par given that it was a pretty empty restaurant when we got there.", "author": "Tina A."}

You're not only miscommunicating to us, but we also felt like you were treating us unfairly.

What really caught my eye on the menu was the variety of Poke options, and I love me some poke.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty cute; it has a casual, beachy feel while still seeming nice enough for dinner after work. I chose the Original Hawaiian Poke, the special of Pulled Pork sliders with pineapple slaw, and a blood orange margarita.\n\nOverall, the food was decent. I wasn't too thrilled about it though. I've had some pretty good poke, so my expectations are pretty high. While it was nice, both the poke itself and the wonton chips served with it had way too much salt for me. I finished most of it, but couldn't get through the last little bit just because the taste of salt became so overwhelming. \n\nThe pulled pork sliders were really delicious, with the pork being so nicely seasoned and cooked, and the sweetness of the pineapple slaw plus the Hawaiian rolls were a nice blend. My only gripe about these little sliders is that I wanted there to be more of the pork to balance out the thick fluffiness of the roll. \n\nThe margarita was pretty good; Blood orange flavoring seems to be getting popular right now, and I'm all for that.\n\nMy mom seemed to be a little annoyed at how little our server was attending to us. She was very nice and polite when she was, but we had to keep scanning for her and didn't see her very often. \n\nIt was a nice dinner.

Do you recall what manager you spoke with when you called and may I also ask what you were expecting the manager to do upon receiving your call?\n\nWe do pride ourselves on serving fresh, well-prepared food at Pacific Catch.  We also take a great amount of pride in the cleanliness of our establishment.

Your response does make me feel a little better and much more willing to come back again.  Because management was responsive, I will consider rating Pac Catch 2 stars, but will withhold it until my next visit.\n\nYours faithfully,\nMatthew\n\n======\nIt was nice to hear back from management, and it is good that they were responsive despite the initial attitude and lack of good customer service I experienced on the telephone back a few months. Yelp truly is an excellent medium to communicate with restaurants--especially to get issues like this addressed.  However, I still rate Pac Catch a *1 star* as I await a response from the manager.  I'm STILL a bit wary and hesitant.", "author": "Matthew L."}

The restaurant wasnt that busy but I think it was the way the server's stations are spread out so not everyone gets equal attention. \n\nThe food was hit and miss. We had the calamari as the appetizer. These were the smallest calamari I've had and they also mixed it with red bell pepper and lemon. It was satisfying, nice breading but not usual. \n\nFor dinnner, my friend got two tacos... Shrimp and halibut. They came with black beans and a salad which was so so. The fish itself was good but the combination was lacking flavor overall. He wound up eating just the fish. \n\nI had the California sandwich with salmon.

Minus one star for the ridiculous service, which is really a hit or miss. Never accept a table in the bar side of the restaurant, unless you are okay with being completely and utterly ignored. \n\nWe came here for just a simple lunch, and they seated us in the room with the bar. They handed us menus and disappeared for the next half hour. When we finally flagged someone down and got our order taken and received our food, they never returned. We asked several waiters nearby for some attention, and they all said \"Oh I'll check to see on that\" and that was that. It seemed no one really knew who was helping us, so we got no service at all. We waited for the check for the longest time, after again asking several workers, and nothing. Finally we asked the bartender, and he came out from behind the bar to help us. I'm pretty sure that wasn't his responsibility. \n\nA simple quick meal ended up taking up an hour and 45 minutes of our afternoon. The only reason I'm keeping the review at 3 stars, is that service was fine in the actual dining area of the restaurant.\n\nAlso, its great that there is a parking lot behind the restaurant, but just be aware that by the time you leave, there will likely be a car parked illegally behind you, requiring you to wait till they return, or try and attempt a 20 point turn. \n\nThere went another 10 minutes of our time.", "author": "Elyse N."}

The salmon was slightly dry, the bread was a bit chewier than I'd like, and the spicy fries that arrived with the sandwich were soggy. Meh. Meanwhile on the other side of the table, my friend had the mixed seafood platter and had no complaints, and I also got to sample some of the sweet potato fries for the first time - those are BOMB. We also ordered the Let's Get Saucy sushi roll, which was just dandy (although its pretty hard to screw up sushi).\n\nThe service here was decent. Our server was very friendly and had a good sense of humor, but didn't stop by the table very often. Whenever we needed something, we'd spend several minutes trying to flag him down cause he was consistently MIA for long periods of time.\n\nOverall I had higher hopes for this Pacific Catch, especially considering this is San Francisco.

We arrived and sat at table hoping that they would clean it once we sat down. Nope. The waiter ignored us for about 10 minutes. Once he came, he just gave us menus and didn't bother to clean the table. If it weren't for his co-worker, our table would have never been cleaned.

The location is definitely in a very busy area off GGP. Luckily, our friends were already sitting. Service is quick-quick-quick. I love that, especially at a busy eatery. \n\nMy boyfriend and I shared their Baja style fish tacos with sweet potato fries (ick). To eat we shared the Vietnamese Steak sandwich. Their fish tacos are incredible! The batter looked crunchy, but oh no, it was delicate and the fish was not at all fishy. Even with mountain of guacamole on it, you could still catch all of the flavors off the dish. I was completely blown away that I actually tasted an amazing fish taco.\n\nSince my boyfriend and I shared the sandwich, the staff was nice enough to split it in half, as well as split up the regular french fries. Again, I was completely enthralled by their great combination of flavor of siracha aioli (!) and thee most tender steak I have ever bit into. Moreover, their cole slaw, which I normally don't care for, was crispy and not at all drenched in mayo. \n\nTheir prices are a little higher than what I would pay for, but it was so worth it.

Our server was very nice and friendly but was lacking service toward the end of the meal,  I guess he was too busy with the other big party (15 people).  He was pretty slow and did not refill our water.\n\nThe menu was extensive.  There were a lot of varieties that you could choose from.  You can choose from Salad, Rice Bowls, Tacos, Sandwiches, etc...\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nPacific Ceviche Trio ($17) - a sampling of shrimp ceviche, Hawaiian poke & Peruvian ceviche with chips.  It was great.  The portion was good for share.  I really like the purple potato chips.  It was perfect to eat with the poke.  Poke was so fresh and flavorful.  \n\nSweet Potato Fries ($6) - Portion was big.  The fries was so good.  Thick, crispy outside and soft inside.  It came with ginger wasabi aioli and sweet Thai chili sauces.  I think the wasabi aioli was better with the fries.  \n\nSpicy Tuna Sushi Roll ($8.50) - The sushi roll was huge.  very filling......everything was so fresh.\n\nCalifornia Roll ($9.00) - Again, the roll was big.  The crab meat was real crab salad.  Tasty.......\n\nI got the Hawaiian Poke Rice Bowl ($15).  It had tuna, wakame salad, avocado, daikon sprouts, cucumber, ginger, sesame seeds, shredded nori and soy-wasabi sauce.  I agree with other Yelpers.  The portion was huge and had a lot of rice but not much fish.  $15 was a little bit over price.  But the taste was pretty good.   The fish was fresh and flavorful.  I got half brown rice and half salad.  All ingredients were very fresh and tasty.  The only thing is the soy-wasabi sauce was little bit too much.  Kinda of salty to me.\n\nMy sister got the Ahi Rice Bowl ($15).  The ingredients were the same as the other rice bowls except the fish.  Ahi was very fresh.  I did not read the menu carefully.  If I knew the Ceviche Trio had poke, I would order Ahi rice bowl instead.\n\nI really wanted to try their mochi for the dessert but I was too full.....Ok, next time!", "author": "Liza T."}

I'm a Lacto-Vegetarian, and he includes fish and eggs. We have many perfect places for either, but not both. This particular day we were parked near 9th in the Sunset, and looking for a place close by because I was on crutches. We headed towards Lincoln, both starving and passing long wait lines outside of every restaurant. We hit the end of the block in front of Pacific Catch and there didn't appear to be a wait so we said why not. Because it wasn't packed we were a bit skeptical. \n\nWhen I looked at the menu, my stomach growled! When our meals arrived, mine with grilled tofu and his with fish, both were beautifully presented and tasted great too. I think the biggest surprise was the side salad. It is not at all the norm that you would ususally be served, but large and prepared with sprouts, shitake mushrroms, edaname, cukes, and a delicious miso dressing. \n\nIt's casual, and although some areas are louder than others, you can still carry a conversation. Having returned several more times now, we have our favorite spot that if necessary, is worth waiting for. The service is prompt, helpful and friendly.

No biggie for us, I don't mind where I sit.\n\nWhat I ordered:\n\nFruit punch (alcoholic cocktail) $9.50: Vodka with various types of fruit juices. This drink was STRONG! My face was red and I was pretty buzzed. I guess if I can feel the alcohol from one drink, it is worth the $9.50 you pay for it because you actually get alcohol in it, none of that watered down drinks at other places.\n\nThai Coconut Shrimp $13:  7 pieces of jumbo shrimp with coconut shaving batter, deep fried and with the sweet chili sauce.... mMMmm nom nom nom. My friend ordered this appetizer and I was a little hesitant. A lot of restaurants end up giving you small shrimp with crappy battered textured. This was pretty good, you can taste the actual coconut shavings, the batter was light and crispy and the shrimp was bigger than I thought it would be. I was happy with this dish.\n\nCalifornia Salmon $12:  This is where I wasn't too happy. This dish came with a side of coleslaw (that wasn't really good) and a side of fries ( I picked the sweet potato fries). The sweet potato fries was good until it got cold and soggy, I recommend you eating it as soon as you get them! As for the sandwich, I was disappointed with it. You get a slice of salmon that you can't even see at all, but can taste it. I swear the slice of the salmon was the thickness of 10 sheets of paper... not the filet that you would expect from a salmon sandwich. The bread was not toasted and so it was cold and not warm and crispy. I think texture is key when making a sandwich, you get the lettuce, tomato, avocado and salmon (all of which have a moist texture -- except the lettuce) and you want the bread to add a different texture... this is just me, I like my bread warm and crispy. As for flavor, it had enough flavor and it was actually tasty, just sad that the main attraction in this sandwich was nowhere to be seen.\n\nService was great!

Since I am on a strict clean eating diet to determine some food allergies, I thought this would be a good place to go.\n\nI ordered the Grilled Salmon salad which said it had these ingredients - salmon, green beans, shiitake mushrooms, tomatoes, crispy salmon skin \"croutons\", citrus-miso dressing. I had the dressing on the side and removed the fried salmon skins (there was way too much...) so it would just be veggies and salmon.  However, after I started eating it, something felt off.  The mushrooms and green beans tasted as if they have been coated in some slick oil.  Somehow there was salad dressing in my salad even though I asked for it to be on the side. The salmon was grilled with the same slick oil that made my digestive system act up for the remainder of the night.  \n\nMy husband also had the grilled salmon special. And guess what. He also had his tummy act up for the night as well.\n\nAnyway, it was not a pleasant experience and wished we had gone to the other tons of restaurants in the Inner Sunset. I guess the lesson learned here is to explicitly ask if the ingredients in a salad are raw or coated in something... (Usually when I get a salad the ingredients are raw veggies unless they specifically say its not!)\n\nPros - \n- Service was great with a very attentive server \n- The restaurant is spacious and good for groups\n- There was no wait to be seated even though the place was getting crowded\n\nCons -\n- Parking is tough on the weekends around this area.  We parked a few blocks away\n- Food is not super high quality for seafood", "author": "Lucy C."}

We got, as expected, the Hawaiian poke as an appetizer and somehow we all ended up ordering more tuna for our main course: the Ahi 3-Way for me, an Ahi Wasabi Bowl, an Ahi Salad... etc. (Which really took the waiter aback. I don't blame him.)\n\nWhy did we do this? We were basically looking for more raw fish, more innovations in the same ballpark as the Poke. Not finding it we all settled on seared Ahi or the Poke, which was as raw as it gets. And it turns out, it's kind of a one trick pony. I found my Ahi 3-Way to be pretty disappointing. It was a wad of rice, a wad of poke, a wad of seaweed salad, a wad of seared ahi in one style and another wad in another style. I found it pretty uninspired and pretty uncohesive.\n\nIt was also pretty expensive: $17.95 for what did not amount to $17.95 worth of fish (and as you know, rice is basically free for restaurants.)\n\nSo, maybe next time I should just leave it at Hawaiian Poke for the appetizer and try their catch of the day or seasonal special.

The ceviche came with fresh potato chips and it was spicy and cold and perfectly balanced. The miso salmon was sweet and the texture was very tender, melt your mouth type. The sushi roll was very good also, all sushi kind of blends together for me but there was definitely nothing bad about it. The service was great and the restaurant is large for San Francisco.

If you dine-in, they give you a tray of pretzel goldfish and edamame.  Some of the many appetizers I've tried include:\n\nCabo Calamari ($9): fried calamari (both rings and tentacles, lemon slices and chilies); taste is pretty standard and it's served with a \"spicy\" chipotle aioli.  During my last visit, this was free via a Foursquare check-in offer.\n\nSweet Potato Fries ($6):  always delicious and served with interesting dipping sauces: ginger wasabi aioli and sweet Thai chili.  I prefer ketchup.  \n\nBaja Shrimp Ceviche ($8.50):  a fair amount of shrimp, lime, cilantro and chilies, served in a martini glass and surrounded by tortilla chips.  This was pretty tasty, but not that stand-out is.  \n\nHawaiian Poke ($9.50): this is probably the only appetizer that actually shines.  The tuna is marinated in a sesame-soy marinade and served with crispy wonton chips.  It can be a bit salty, but just make sure you have a nice cocktail also.\n\nHappy hour is 4-6 p.m. Monday through Friday and also 10 p.m. to close each night.  They have a fair selection of beer for $3-4, wells for $4.50 and a selection of appetizers as well.  The service is generally pretty helpful and I think overall, it's a pretty fun place to get snacks/drinks.", "author": "Samantha L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-31", "description": "Let me preface this by saying that I am not a fish person. At least, not cooked fish. Far too often, fish at restaurants is not fresh and further ruined by being cooked until it's completely dried out. For this reason, I've never paid much attention to Pacific Catch despite passing by its admittedly attractive looking building thousands of times. As far as I was concerned, it would just be another disappointing seafood restaurant. I probably would've continue to ignore this place had my fellow food enthusiast, Andrew W., not urged me to try their fish tacos, which he swore were some of the best he's ever had. We have similar taste in food, so finally, I decided to give it a shot. \n\nOur table of 3 shared a meal-sized salad with hawaiian poke, a three taco platter prepared Traditional Baja style, a Japanese wasabi rice bowl with seared ahi tuna, a grilled yellowtail platter, and fried dolce de leche \"spring rolls\". Unfortunately, the yellowtail special was not that special. The sauce didn't really make sense with the fish. The hawaiian poke, on the other hand, was wonderfully seasoned and a delight with the mixed greens. The Japanese wasabi rice bowl came with a perfectly spicy wasabi sauce. The seared tuna, unfortunately, fell a bit short. The ahi tuna did not come with a sharp, crisp sear, instead appearing as a small gradient from the cooked exterior and the raw interior. The tuna was also not as fresh as Mikuni's in Sacramento, which remains to be my top choice for seared tuna. Now that I've talked about the other dishes, I can finally talk about the fish tacos. Let me tell you, the fish tacos are heavenly! If you choose to have your tacos prepared Traditional Baja style, the fis will vary with the catch of the day. The two times I went, the FOTD was True Cod. The cod was as fresh as if it had been caught that morning. The batter came out crisp but not overly thick as to drown out the subtle flavors of the fish. The guacamole was creamy deliciousness. Squeeze a bit of lemon on it and you've got the perfect fish taco. After a very satisfying meal, we decided to order the fried dolce de leche \"spring rolls.\" Definitely unique and tasty. One person at my table found the dolce de leche to be a bit too sweet, but I liked it just fine. \n\nJust writing about Pacific Catch makes me crave it.

I love how this location serves sushi, and has a larger menu than the one on Chestnut.  It's so big, and has a great bar as well.  You're not stuffed in like sardines, and I can actually have a conversation without someone next to me eavesdropping, pretty nice.  I also really like how they bring out house appetizers, it's just a little odd that it consists of goldfish pretzels and edemame. \n\nThe California roll has ACTUAL crab, so that's a plus.  And their Island chicken tacos are soooo good.\n\nYou should definitely give it a try.", "author": "Michelle R."}

So we decided to get take out and just eat at the beach. We met a very friendly worker named Andrea? Audrea? working in the bar area who took our order, gave us tips, even felt bad for us having to do take out and gave us free sodas for our wait. We got the korean bbq ribs, serrano poke, and the original, mahi mahi and steak tacos with spicy fries. The best thing for both of us by far was the poke. I'm not a big or experienced poke fan (insert joke here) but it was very tasty with enough heat but not too much. The thing I liked second, my friend not so much, was the ribs. I loved the sauce they used and enough meat to not think you got cheated. \n\nOn the other side we found the spicy fries cold and soggy but we drove 5 minutes away so HOPEFULLY that was just our fault and I will put that on us BUT kind of skimpy on them (i think my friend counted 10 thin fries) and it didn't have any \"kick\" to be called spicy in my opinion. The original and mahi mahi tacos lacked really any flavor and were disappointments with the steak taco being the one taco we both agreed we wish we got instead. This is also the first time I got black beans with no flavor. I thought my friend was joking but it actually had no flavor. Just a suggestion I think they should put more cheese in with the beans since it added more flavor than without the cheese bites. Also parking here is TOUGH! Best parking is either at the park across the street or a couple blocks down on one of the streets. The meters were 30 min max and the parking enforcement marked tires I think so knew if you put in more money and still ticket you.\n\nOverall, I give this place 2 stars for the food we liked and had to give 1 star to Andrea or Audrea (sorry I butchered your name) since she rocks! She gave EXCELLENT customer service, was helpful, very friendly and considerate to give free sodas once she realized the customers had to go with Plan B. THAT is what customer service is all about! Other than that while there are a couple of good things to eat and we may be back we both felt it's not a MUST GO place for us.", "author": "Mike D."}

My boyfriend and I went here for our first time last week and it is definitely our new favorite spot. The food was great and I love the fact that I do not feel guilty eating their food since their portions are pretty big! Our server (I believe her name was Adriana) was really nice! She asked if we ate there before and of course we said no so she suggested to us what we should try. She was definitely helpful and made our experience there for our first time even better. It is always a love/hate feeling when we get a good server LOL we know we have a good server when we're thinking \"dammnit now we really have to tip\" lmao. Thanks Adriana!! We ordered the California Style Hawaiian Poke, which she recommended... and it was hella good, lawwd have mercy. For our entree, I ordered the Hawaiian Teriyaki rice bowl with grilled salmon and it was amazeballs. I will definitely be coming back for the rice bowl, the poke, and the service! \n\nOnly downside is that we got pulled over before we got to the restaurant lol apparently we can't drive through a intersection until a pedestrian has gotten onto the sidewalk completely  -___- the pedestrian had barely started walking, but luckily we got off with a warning.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-10", "description": "The boyfriend and I ambled in here on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon, and had no trouble grabbing a table near the bar. Things started out well: We got menus quickly, and were brought a great little snack tray with pretzel goldfish and edamame. Their menu has a lot to offer, and both of the cocktails we ordered were fantastic (a Dark & Stormy for him, a Guava Mint Cooler for me). I really liked sitting in the bar area. We got a table right next to the window with a beautiful view of the park in all it's green, sunshine-y glory. \n\nFor starters, he got the Crab & Corn chowder, which I think was a seasonal special but was SO tasty and crab-a-licious. I ordered the Peruvian Ceviche. Ceviche appetizers are usually so small (even though they're expensive), but Pacific Catch does NOT mess around. The ceviche dish was HUGE! I was begging my boyfriend to have some so I'd have room for our main dish. They really packed in the fish and all of it was so fresh and delicious, I thought about licking the bowl (boyfriend vetoed, but only because I told him he couldn't lick his soup bowl clean, either).\n\nWe split the Sushi Grade Ahi salad, and they were nice enough to bring it to us in separate bowls. I really loved the wasabi dressing (a nice kick at the bottom of the bowl), but I thought the actual Ahi itself was only alright. We also got the sweet potato fries and they tasted a bit unseasoned. \n\nWhile the service at the beginning had been fantastic, it took a really long time to get anyone's attention and after we got the check, nobody came by to pick it up again. The bar isn't that large, wasn't full, they had more people working than when we'd walked in, and it still seemed impossible to get anyone's attention for the bill. It wasn't until a bus boy stopped by to clear our salad bowls that the bill got paid. \n\nOverall, I really really liked the food here. Not a cheap lunch but well worth it. They would have gotten 5 stars if the service had been more consistent!", "author": "Rachel A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-01", "description": "So I'm kind of ashamed.  I avoided going to Pacific Catch for ages because it seemed like the sort of corporate, kitschy place that I got to ignore now that I had a neighborhood full of wonderful local cuisine.  Something about it made me say to myself, \"They can't possibly have fresh fish, and if they do I bet it's covered in weird, thick, salty sauces.  What kind of real SF restaurant has a parking lot, anyway?\"\n\nI am an idiot.\n\nIf you get beyond the plastery exterior and enter the restaurant, it's pretty posh.  It's open, and with wooden booths in the main area and nice wicker tables and chairs in the bar area and patio, it has a bit more personality than your average chain restaurant.  While it gets crowded early, it's a pretty swell place to kick back and enjoy a Dusty Road (rye whiskey and ginger beer - like a Dark and Stormy, only better!).\n\nWhat impressed me most, however, was the menu.  While it mostly consists of variations on a few themes, they're good themes.  And the variations include ways for making things healthier!  I think few people are as picky as I am about that sort of thing, so I can say with confidence: If you're looking to go out to eat somewhere but want fresh ingredients and the option to eat right, Pacific Catch has got you covered.  Want a rice bowl?  Get it with brown rice!  Worried about how caloric rice is?  Get it with half brown rice, half greens!  Going gluten free?  No problem!  They have a section in your menu just for you.  Want to substitute one type of protein for another?  That's fine, too.\n\nI have a friend who's a big fan of poke bowls, she knows good poke.  And when I asked her where I could get a good one in the city, she recommended Pacific Catch.  This was at the time when I was still being an idiot, so I thought \"Hmm...really?\"  I had to try it.  The moral of the story here is that I should trust my friends' palates over my ignorant pre-conceived notions (imagine that!).  The wasabi rice bowl with poke is so very good.  Soverygood.  And fresh!  The fish is fresh, the veggies are fresh, the rice is cooked to my favorite chewy consistency - even the brown rice!  And yes, very healthy.  The fish and veggies are dressed very lightly, which not only keeps things healthier, but also preserves all of their individual textures.  The fish is soft and smooth, the veggies are crunchy to the last bite!  Good, clean fun.  \n\nWill I ever judge a book by its cover again?  Truthfully speaking, more than likely.  Will I eat at Pacific Catch a lot more often, though?  Why, yes.  Yes I will.", "author": "Becca S."}

Don't let the name fool you though, there's plenty of turf to go along with the surf.

Both were excellently prepared and delicious. For dessert we got the fondu mochi balls which were fun and great tasting. \n\nThe Service was good. No complaints here. \n\nThe Restaurant is pretty large. This place would be perfect for large parties and is in high traffic area of the city so I could definitely see myself holding a party here. I'd definitley say this place has a casual, chainy type vibe to it. It's very nice inside but something about it gives off a cookie cutter feel where you can tell they followed a blue print on how to build restaurants so I don't think you're going to find any SF charm here. \n\nOverall, great dinner experience.

I was also disappointed with the servings.  Three, rather small, pieces of fried fish, which ran about $12.  It came with \"spicy\" fries, which though delicious and well-seasoned, had absolutely no spice or kick to speak of.  I liked their special tartar sauce.. that coming from a person who never touches tartar sauce.  \n\nMy friend ordered the Escobar (sp?) special of the night and I found it to be oily but quite delectable.  It came with fried bananas, beans & rice, and sliced avocado.  Definitely a type of fish I would order the next time I was invited out to dinner.\n\nOverall the food was A-Okay but nothing to really write home about.  I wish their fish & chips had more of a fresh veggie variety instead of a tiny coleslaw, so as to offset the greasy flavour.\n\nProps to our waitress who definitely knew her fish!

So I thought to myself, I have got to try this place. So I gathered up one of my friends and we drove to this location where we had a reservation at 6:30 pm. So I am someone who absolutely hates driving in the city due to the fact that it is so crowded and there are all these one way streets and the worst of all: there is NEVER any parking! This time was no different. We found the restaurant within ten minutes, but the next twenty minutes consisted of us circling the neighboring streets to no avail. The restaurant has its own private parking lot but there is only room for about ten cars, and for a restaurant that busy, it's like \"are you serious?\" We kept calling the restaurant to push our reservation back, and Elena, one of the hostesses, was very nice to us and told us that she would take care of the reservation and even gave us her own tips on where to find parking. My friend and I are starving at this point and getting cranky and I was on the verge of giving up and going somewhere else when a spot in a public parking lot opens up! So I pay $8 to park, but at this point I am desperate. The lot we found was one block away from the restaurant so we made the walk there and arrive about 45 minutes late for our reservation, but they had saved a table for us and were super fast and efficient at taking our order. \n\nLet's just say that we were so hungry that we dug in a little too eagerly into our menu and ordered a bunch of food. I would definitely recommend the poke bowl as a starter and the dulche de lech \"spring rolls\" as a dessert. The fries have the best seasoning and all their food is so fresh. When we left, we both felt like we were drunk, we were so full. The food is a little on the pricier side but definitely worth it.  \n\nThe restaurant was big and busy with almost all the tables being used, but we never felt neglected.

They tasted and looked great (purple potato chips? awesome) but they just couldn't hold up in the end and we weren't offered any more when we ran out. \n\nI think in terms of decor, it looked a bit like the Olive Garden - kind of that non-descript interior decorating that doesn't strike you as particularly fancy. But maybe b/c I'm from Chicago where seafood places (if they're not fast food joints) look pretty fancy. (We're a landlocked state.

I tried a sample of something (ceviche perhaps?) and the taste stuck with me. Good thing too- I put two and two together when exiting Botanical Gardens and Pacific Catch was towering in front of me like a beacon of light for my hungry bits. \n\nWe went in there on New Years Day and what better way to celebrate the new decade but with a basket of fish and chips? There is no better way, that's what. I also had a wakame (seaweed) salad which was absolutely peachy- especially considering the fact that they didnt scrimp on the green goodness, and there was a dressing soaked bed of cucumber waiting for me at the end once I finished. \n\nI stepped up the standard fish and chips to a sampler which included fried oysters, shrimp and fish, I chose standard fries since other people at the table got spicy cajun fries and sweet potato fries. Pacific catch has the fries down- absolutely. I loved the combo basket and was simultaneously salivating over everyone elses meal at the table. The Ahi sandwhich looks ridiculously good. Had I not been so full after the combo I had, I would have stolen the bits that left unfinished on my friend's plate. I also had a taste of the soup of the day-a chayote chowder, which had one of the best tastes I've had in a chowder. I didn't know what chayote was when I walked in, but when I walked out I was a fanatic.\n\nA bit on the expensive side of affordable, but for good food (fresh fish) and a good experience, I say it is worth it. \n\nAlso, the place is full of amazing things to daydream at. The chandeliers made out of blue bottles are great taste, event the bathroom has tiny strands of bamboo hidden behind the stall walls.

The avocado-tomatillo sauce was good and they didn't skimp on the portion of it.  The fish had a light and crunchy batter.\n\nThe things we found annoying were every time we ordered something, the waitress said \"Oh, that's the best choice!\"  Since one of us ordered sweet potato fries and one ordered spicy fries and they were both declared to be the best, I wondered which really was the best.\n\nThen my friend's order of spicy fries didn't come with the rest of the food.  When we asked about it she apologized and said it was coming, which it did when my friend had already finished his entree.

So I ordered a bunch of rolls for pick up last night. \n\nOnce again service rocks and the rolls were great. There are 8 large rolls per order, you have the option to substitute for brown rice which was a nice thing to see. Hopefully more sushi places will follow in P Catchs' footsteps and be offering this healthy option more.   \n\nOG Review:\n\nPacific Catch really saved the day on Saturday night. I called in for a 15 head party the morning of and Rob, the general manger, really came through for me. He had a large party already booked but recommended I book 2 reservations and he would try to seat the parties close to each other. \n\nWe all adjourned in the bar area for drinks. The bartender was awesome, great customer service! We were then seated and Rob reserved  2 booths next to each other. It worked out perfect because we used 1 booth as the kids table and the other for the 8 adults. \n\nThere are peeled soy beans and pretzel gold fish on the tables to start munching. The menu rocks!  You can order sushi rolls, and sashimi for the sushi lover but for the not so seasoned raw fish eater there are teriyaki bowls and great specials available as well. I started with the seaweed salad and clam miso, so good. The table ordered the fried calamari which was liked by everybody. Watch out!  It comes with a spicy creamy dipping sauce which was received well, but it is hot! \n\nThe tacos were a favorite of the group. Each taco has a different fish, mahi mahi, cod and salmon. They come with sweet potato fries, yum! I had the Surf and Turf, for 19.95, amazing!  The surf was shrimp with 2 skewers loaded, about 6 shrimp to a skewer. The meat was seasoned and juicy, very good. The entree also came with fried shoestring onions and pineapple fried rice, you have the option to substitute for plain brown rice. Large portion and great price! \n\nThe staff brought out a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl. I didn't try any but I have a pic I'll attach. It looked fantastic and finished the night off perfectly. \n\nWe had a great time and the staff was just great to us. Very accommodating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-27", "description": "While I desperately miss the Canvas Gallery, this place is a lovely new addition to one of my favorite neighborhoods, the Inner Sunset.  The food is good while offering many healthy options, the prices mostly reasonable, the feel is spacious, clean and stylish, and there's even a small parking lot by the side of the building with free parking for patrons...it's hard not to love this place!\n\nThis place doesn't add anything special to the neighborhood from a culinary standpoint, since it's another Asian Fusion place on the same block with three (yes, THREE!!!) other Japanese restaurants and within a block or two of several more sushi bars and fish restaurants...and arguably there's something formulaic and trite about the intentional hipness of the decor...\n\nBut there's also something to be said for dining in comfort, which is exactly what whoever designed and decorated this restaurant seemed to have in mind:  the lighting is mild and pleasant, the ceiling vaulted, giving the overall feeling of weightlessness, and the chairs and booths are mostly comfortable...although the booths will feel slightly cramped if you are very tall or have a big butt or tummy, since the tables are low and there's a non-removeable 1/2-height cushion behind your back that takes up about 5-6\" of your rump room.  If you are under 6' tall and on the slender side, you'll be just fine.\n\nThe servers are very friendly and attentive, which is a pleasant departure from many restaurants in San Francisco, where courteous service sometimes seems to have been otherwise forgotten in the shuffle.  Pacific Catch seems to operate the way many serious, highly rated professional restaurant environments do, with a highly trained staff, attention to detail overall, and a menu that reflects modern trends.  For example, this menu offers not only foodie versions of Miso soup, but also a brown rice substitution option for those of us watching our waistlines or simply attempting to eat a more healthy diet.  \n\nI recommend the coconut skewered shrimp and ordering anything that will get you some of their delicious sweet potato fries (healthier than regular fries, at least!)!  Be warned that you won't be able to eat just one...\n\nI also thoroughly enjoyed their salmon teriyaki bowl which came with shitake mushrooms, asparagus cut into the perfect size bites, and bok choy which was cooked to perfection, served over brown rice that's been dosed with some more of their flavorful teriyaki sauce (normally it's served with pineapple fried rice, but I opted for their complimentary brown rice substitution instead).\n\nTheir traditional miso soup is average at best, and at twice the price that other Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood will charge for the same size bowl, it's nothing special and you get the feeling it's pricier because everything on the menu is priced a little higher, not because of an increase in quality.  Still, the presentation of the bowl, which arrived covered and was quickly de-topped by the server at the table, gives at least some clue as to what your money buys here:  a higher end experience, even if it's at a chain restaurant, even if the menu looks like a mash-up of Sushi-Bar-Meets-Fish'n'Chips-Joint, even if it's a Monday night in the Inner Sunset.  \n\nThere's something to be said for a restaurant that does what it does well.", "author": "Amy L."}

We were extremely hungry and read to chow down. So we finished it and after we ordered our food the server refilled it again.

The salad was a bit interesting with mixed greens and Romanians top off with some Japanese style shredded green seaweed with the soy-wasabi sauce too.  I am a fan of brown rice and there brown rice is made perfect, not to soft or hard.  If you are not a fan of wasabi, I would not recommended because it is a little bit mild spicy.

My friend and i walked into Pacific Catch without reservations and were seated promptly. I LOVE the decor, you wouldn't even think the place was previously the Canvas Gallery. I love the red walls, there are plenty of seating, full bar & most importantly an open kitchen. I love restaurants with an open kitchen which means the place is clean.\n\nIt was my first time dining at Pacific Catch and i thought the menu was overwhelming but at the end i finally ordered the 3 tacos platter (Grilled Salmon taco -- which was very good!, Spicy Chicken Taco -- very disappointing because it wasn't spicy at all!, & Shrimp Taco -- my favorite because it comes with a mango salsa). The taco platter also includs sweet potato fries (YUM!!) & black beans. The platter cost about $14.95. My friend ordered the Eel Wasabi Bowl but she requested no wasabi but instead terayaki sauce which was really good! i wished i ordered the Eel bowl instead ($14.95). In addition to the menu, each meal includes  fish shaped pretzels & endame beans.  Our whole meal cost about $30 with drinks. \n\nOverall, i really enjoyed my meal and i cant wait to come back and try the other items in the menu. I thought the service was really good, our waitress was very sweet and attentive. I am not sure why there are some bad reviews about the service. The waitress even came back to refill my diet coke without me requesting for one! \n\nthanks Pacific Catch for a memorable dinner! :) \n\nPS. parking can be alittle tough!", "author": "Carol Y."}

They do a few things that basically nobody else manages to pull off, and it always impresses me. It's a solid four-star dining experience, but the fact that they can go the extra mile earns them the 5th star.\n\nFirst, don't get put off by the look. The decor is sort of corporate/franchise-y, but it's definitely not a dressed up TGI Friday's or BJ's or anything of that nature. The ingredients are fresh and high quality, and the food is prepared by people who care and know what they're doing.\n\nAlmost everything on the menu is seafood, but they manage to do fusion food better than anywhere else I can think of. Usually most places have a few good dishes in a particular style and if they stray too far, it comes out mediocre.\n\nHere, they do American, Mexican, Japanese, and Korean fusion dishes at about an equally high level. None of the dishes is \"like mom used to make\", they've all got a unique twist that makes them Pacific Catch dishes. But these twists are all good choices, it's not like a lot of restaurants where they put their version on a classic and end up butchering it in the process.\n\nSo basically, the careful attention to the quality of ingredients, the obvious skill in developing the menu, and the ability to do so many diverse things well keeps me coming back.", "author": "Aaron G."}

We loved it so much the first time that we made sure to make it a part of our vacation itinerary.\n\nThe food here is amazing!  Both times, I have tried things off of their seasonal menu.  The first time we went there, I tried items on their chalkboard menu that was Peruvian themed, and my husband ordered Korean barbeque.  On this last trip, we shared the shrimp coctel that was served with a mini shot of tequila.  For my entree, I had the mahi mahi, which was served with amazing sweet potato fries, a delicious tomatillo sauce, and fresh grilled vegetables. So delicious!  My husband got the salmon that came with rice and vegetables.  \n\nThe real star of the meal is the dessert!  Both times, we have had the fried dulce de leche.  It is literally the most incredible dessert ever.  It's rich, creamy, cheesecakey, gooey, and it's served with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.\n\nI will definitely go back to this restaurant again!", "author": "Noelle T."}

We kept our car parked at the park (lol) and walked less than a block to the restaurant. \n\nFirst impressions work always- the place was clean, nice decor and the wait staff was friendly.\n\nEarly dinner equals Happy Hour... unfortunately they only serve the happy hour menu at the bar and it just didn't seem right to sit there with younger ones in tow. Womp womp :(\nThat didn't stop me from trying their lemongrass mojito though- delicious! Tart and sweet and minty with the right amount of rum... yum!\n\nThe trio ceviche was enjoyed by all- even the ones that weren't fans of fish (really?). The baja shrimp ceviche was tasty and tangy, the Hawaiian poke tuna was perfectly marinated, and the Peruvian ceviche was close to being great! I come from an area where Peruvian restaurants sort of rule, so I'm used to the ceviche being more authentic- with the white cornuts and the yucca- but this was still tasty and satisfying. \n\nOur dinner was an assortment of their rice bowls, fish tacos, fish and chips (made with the catch of the day... cod) and chicken tenders for the little one. All the dishes were very good. The taco and fish plates came with fries. Regular and sweet potato thumbs up- nothing spectacular about the \"spicy\" fries though. And nothing really \"spicy\" about them. dipping sauces were a plus, epecially the jalapeno tartar for the fish and chips and the wasabi (guessing) ranch for the sweet potato fries.\n\nOur server was friendly and attentive and when asked a few questions about the menu she was knowledgeable and in one instance when she didn't know, she returned later with information and actually followed up. That was nice!\n\nLastly, my surprise birthday dessert (surprise!) was a near perfect brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. The brownie was dense but moist with walnuts and the vanilla bean ice cream... the icing on the cake!\n\nPrice was very reasonable for a party of 5.5.... $120 or so. Gratuity not included.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable experience and a memorable birthday! \n\nThanks Pacific Catch!", "author": "Yahra V."}

There was no wait at all for small groups; in fact, there were quite a few tables open.  The thing is this Pacific Catch is on the corner of 9th and Lincoln, so it's really hard to find parking.  PC does have a parking lot, but it's fairly small so it's hard to find a space in there.  \n\nDecor: The place is really nice looking for a restaurant that's not super fancy.  Nice hardwood floors.  There are booths and tables; indoor and outdoor seating.  Wine bottle light fixtures here are a cool touch.  There's an open kitchen and a bar you can hang out at if you don't want to sit down and eat.\n\nFood:  I ordered the California Salmon sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries.  The sandwich was really good.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, cooked all the way through, but it was still tender.  The bread was surprisingly good.  It was a Ciabatta, but the outside was crisp and the inside was soft and warm.  It also came with avocado, and a citrus aoli.  I have to talk about the avocado because the avocado here is extremely good.  Usually, the avocado I get at restaurants are not ripe and bland, but at PC it was soft and very flavorful.  The aoli was good too.  Not sure how it's supposed to taste like, but I liked it.  The sweet potato fries were decent, this last time I had them.  When I had them this time, they were a little soggy and cold.  \nI was disappointed because I had them once before and they were on point.\n\nService: Here's where PC loses some stars. Minus one star for being slow.  The waitress actually took our orders and brought our food out very quickly, but after that the service fell off.  Took awhile to get a refill on my drink, and to get the check after the meal was over.\n\nThis might be mean, but minus one star for the hostess.

It did lack the seaweed flavor but the crispy wontons they serve with it was the perfect combination of textures.\n\nVietnamese Steak Sandwich - Yummy!  It's not your average Bun Mi.  First of all, it's square shaped.  And the bread is soft!!! It still has the same marinated steak, seasoned veggies and heat flavor.

Pacific Catch has their own lot but it was full.. thankfully tonight we found parking a few blocks away. The space still reminded me of the Canvas, but it was nicely decorated and I liked the fact that they had a small space for outdoor seating. It was cute but too cold tonight to sit out there. Any who me and my two girls took a while to decide on what we wanted to eat since there were so many good sounding entrees. We finally decided on the Hawaiian surf and turf, 3 tacos and the fried basket. We were all very satisfied and pretty full. The portions could of been a little bigger though.. For dessert we had the dulce de leche spring rolls which were absolutely delicious! I'd definitely come back here again soon.", "author": "Tiff C."}

Big chunks of fish, lots of tomatillo sauce and aoili (I had to scrape some off). I opted for the shrimp, mahi mahi and the catch of the day which was rock cod, and the rock cod was probably my favorite. The tacos held their form pretty well, but I still had to eat a little with my fork. No complaints, it was equally delicious. Awesome sweet potato fries with kosher salt, a nice mildly sweet twist from the fish tacos with salsa and plenty of lime. The lemongrass mojito was sharp, and they have some pretty good beer on tap. Bomb.\n\nAnnnnnd if you snagged a goody bag at the Yelp Holiday Party this year there's a coupon for a free Hawaiian poke or shirmp ceviche appetizer with a  purchase of entree priced at $12.95 or above. The poke they had at the party had bit too much soy, but my guess is because it was made and then brought to the party (poke chunks probably dripped along the way and gathered a pool), not made to order like at the restaurant. The poke we ordered was plump and by no means soggy. Served with plenty of fried won tons. MMMM.\n\nI wouldn't come here for sushi, but they do seafood well and the staff (including the chefs they had at PLEY!) were very friendly. Not the decor, but the menu seemed a little touristy and like a chain (a la Elephant Bar and such), but the food was good.

It included a fixed menu for dinner for 6 and two free beers.  So free crab...hells yeah.  Free DELICIOUS crab....f*ck yeah.\n\nThe first course was their Crab Corn Chowder.  This is the recipe that the exec chef won a contest with.  So we all had pretty high expectations...and they were met and exceeded.  It was perfectly spicy and had a nice pesto sauce drizzled over the top.  Tied with the crab as the best part of the meal.\n\nSecond we had a crab-ragoon like dumpling for an appetizer.  It definitely was good no complaints, but if it wasn't included it wouldn't have been missed.\n\nThird was the main meal.  We had a choice between crab or their special which was two different types of fish.  I didn't really pay attention because I won a contest for free crab during their Crabfest Festival...so of course I choose the crab.  I normally don't like eating crab due to all the hard work and dedication needed to enjoy it, but this time I made an exception.  And I am glad I did.  The crab was seasoned and cook nicely that I didn't even need the extra butter to dip it on, though of course I still used it.  It was served on a bed of arugula and garlic noodles that was also delish.\n\nFinally we had dessert.  There were three different dishes.  Mochi ice cream (chocolate, vanilla, and coffee), Brownies, and this apple turnover pastry served with Dulce De Leche ice cream on it.  The pastry with the ice cream was the stand out winner.  The mochi ice cream was the same you buy in stores but still so good.  The brownie was the low point....it was dry, but with all this other free goodness it didnt stop us.\n\nThe value of the meal was $300 and all we had to pay was tax and tip.  4 course dinner, 2 free beers all for under $30.  score!\n\nThe servers and hostess were extremely helpful and nice.  I don't know if it was because I was the contest winner and they were treating me like royalty, but good for them.  The GM, COO, AND the Executive Chef came out during our meal to introduce themselves, congratulate me, and talk a little.  Our party felt like rock stars.", "author": "Kelson P."}

If I were writing this review after our first visit I might've given them 3-stars, but since our first coupla times, the service as well as food have taken a notable decline.

Because we drove down 9th, we went straight into the park and worked up an appetite walking to the restaurant. No biggie because who doesn't love a stroll through the park? But for the anxious-parker, rejoice at the private parking lot!\n\nI love the dining area. The high ceilings are almost unheard of in affordable city dining and it creates a really spacious atmosphere. It is also bright and tables have a good amount of space in between them. \n\nPacific Catch has the most adorable nibble-food I've ever seen. Maybe I'm just a sucker for goldfish. Every table gets a tray of edamame and pretzel-flavored goldfish crackers! So cute. The two don't really go that well together but it makes for a very aesthetically pleasing start to the meal.\n\nThe menu is a little big and overwhelming. I just picked stuff off of the June specials menu because they were promoting some succulent shrimp specials that sounded enticing. I was tempted to go for the ahi wasabi bowls that I had read about but decided I didn't want to pay $14 for a rice bowl. Maybe next time.\n\nInstead I went with the $13 shrimp banh mi. I expected it to be delicious because this is 26 times more expensive than a banh mi from Saigon and 3 times more expensive than a typical banh mi from Vietnamese sandwich shops. Of course it didn't need to be \"authentic\", just tasty. It sounded very good in theory but I think the presentation fell short. The bread was much too heavy to enjoy completely; it was more like a cross between a baguette and a roll. Ergh..overall the sandwich tasted like an Asian fusion po'boy. \n\nI liked that it came with a cool Asian looking salad, but did not like the coleslaw. Too many salads, make up your mind! \n\nAs others have noted, the sweet potato fries are bomb and come with many of the dishes, so before you order yourself a whole side of sweet potato fries, check if your meal already comes with it!\n\nThe tacos looked good but overpriced. The fish looked tasty and reasonable for what you pay. The shrimp papaya salad was not good and the little shrimp was just weird to eat with the crunchy papaya! \n\nThey charge you for brewed green tea. Our server was not particularly friendly to us and seemed completely uninterested in anything, but didn't really do much to affect our dining experience here. \n\nA solid semi-chain restaurant.", "author": "Lydia W."}

We sat at one of the tables with the tall bar stools, which was quite uncomfortable as the bottom of the table was not hollow for our legs to fit into.  My knees kept hitting the sides of the table. \n\nNow for the food.  I was tempted to order everything on their Bar Bites menu but opted to have just the first 5 items (minus the edamame beans and sweet potato fries) and 2 refreshing cosmos - YUM YUM.  I have been here before but for some reason the food was not as good as I remembered.  I had the following in the order of favorite to least favorite:\n\nAsparagus & Shiitake Roll: It was an interesting vegetarian take on a sushi roll and I found the asparagus tempura and the tiny strings of mushroom and carrot to be quite lovely.\n\nThai Coconut Shrimp: It's funny because when I had my first bite, I was like \"OMG...it feels like a Thai restaurant in my mouth.\"  Now looking at the menu as I write this entry, the dish's name is quite befitting. The coconut flavors are so quintessentially Thai.  I loved the crunch of the crispy coconut flakes and the juicy shrimp.  Frankly, I ended up just eating the coconut flake outer layer instead of the shrimp because it was so good.  The sweet and sour dipping sauce (that you can buy at any Asian market) was a nice complement. \n\nSpicy Tuna Roll: This roll was actually spicy, which I appreciated.  It was yummy with the bitterness of the daikon sprouts.  \n\nHawaiian Poke:  This was a disappointment as everyone had been raving about it.  Mainly because the poke tasted so gummy.  It did not simply melt in my mouth and the chopped green onions were a bit too overpowering.  I do like my poke to be marinated for a few hours so that the fish really soaks up the flavors but I just felt it had been marinated too long.  And the crispy chips started to give me a headache...which I get when I eat too much fried food.  Disappointing.\n\nSpicy Cabo Calamari:  Pretty good but nothing too spectacular.  It was interesting that they also deep-fried slices of lemon and peppers.  The peppers were really yummy and SPICY...hehe...I attempted to eat the lemons too, but I suggest you not do that.      \n\nThe food is pretty good and very well priced. They also played good music...love Bob Marley. :) I think I hyped myself up for this dining experience as I hadn't been here in a long time.  I probably won't go for a few months.  I'm sure I will start missing the Coconut Shrimp by then.", "author": "Rose J."}

It was mochi balls filled with ice cream (you can buy these at Safeway nowadays), cut into quarters and served with a ramekin of hot chocolate dipping sauce.  It was OK, $5.95.

Bonus! I can eat the whole thing and not be the complete pig I want to be. And let me tell you, I'm not a brown rice fan, but this stuff was delicious. Anyway, the bad news was the fish. When getting the seared ahi on top, I'm used to maybe part of a piece or two being a little too fibrousy-chewy. Unfortunately, this time, Only a piece or two was NOT too yucky to eat.

I could barely eat one. \nOur waitress walked by and saw that we weren't eating our food but didn't ask us anything. Finally we just asked for the check. She asked us if we wanted boxes and we said no. At this point we were so annoyed complaining wasn't even worth it. But she got her manager and our food was comped.

The first two times were last summer, 2010, with the most recent being yesterday.  The first two times, I became infatuated with their Japanese Wasabi 'Asian Bowl' with Hawaiian Poke.  Ordered sushi rice both times over brown rice and loved the combination of flavors with the added zing of the wasabi.  The bowl seems a little on the pricey side until you get it and it's huge and filling.  Forgot to mention to start out with the sweet potato fries, which are probably the best I've ever had.   \n\nMy only gripe about this place came yesterday, when my party was among the handful of tables here but had to wait to be seated, wait to make our orders, and on top of that, the waiter messed up on everything.  I think he was trying to be cool and memorize our order (not too hard because we only ordered three things), but my bowl came out with brown rice instead of sushi rice, and halfway through the meal we figured out we wouldn't be getting our sweet potato fries.  I'm guessing the manager came out and took over our table because of the multiple errors and comped our fries.\n\nAll in all, whether it was the poor service or just my overdue, over-hyped expectation, my bowl was not as great as last year.  Sad to say, this experience ruined this place a little for me which is too bad because the place is a nice place to eat.

I took my kid brother to Fireside for his first (legal) beer, tasted Indian food for the first time at Naan-n-Curry when I was but a wee sophomore at SF State, and fell in love with BJ's on the Bayou (and subsequently had my still beating heart ripped from my chest when it closed down).\n\nIn my opinion this is the highest concentration of great and diverse food anywhere in the city (yeah, I know the Mission gives it a run for its money, but I don't like stepping in dog and hobo shit on my way to dinner, so quit being a smartass).  The only problem with the area (ya know, besides parking) is that once I get down here I'm like a kid in a candy shop with only a buck; I have so many great things to choose from and it's hard to decide which is going to win.  \n\nWell, by way of finally getting to a review, my first trip to Pacific Catch just made my decision of where to go when I'm in the area that much harder.  \n\nI came by for their happy hour at the bar.  The drink deals were solid (like 3.50 for draft) and the bar food (in this case, delicious, delicious coconut shrimp) were discounted, as well.  I'll admit that I wasn't terribly in love with the beer selection (I'm not much for IPA's and this bar favors them, so bully for you if you're into hoppy beer), but their whiskey and scotch selection was very impressive (great range of tastes, flavors, and countries from what I could see) and they weren't slouches in the gin department (ya know, if you're like me and you sometimes want to drink something that tastes vaguely antiseptic).\n\nI was also really liking the decoration and flow of the place: clean and sleek.  The service was solid, I experienced two bartenders and both left positive impressions.\n\nThe pricing was consistent with what I'd expect from it (it doesn't look or act like a greasy spoon, so it wasn't cheap like a greasy spoon).\n\nAll in all, I expect to find myself back here soon.

Everyone else in the party seemed to enjoy their fish entrees. \n\nThe problem is, living down in SoCal, there's a restaurant called California Fish Grill that's very similar to this place. Decent quality food, a plethora of choices, and a wide variety. Not quite the \"Asian-fusion\" vibe or waiter service, but comparable. The major difference is that Cali Fish Grill is very inexpensive compared to Pacific Catch. \n\nOur bill at Pacific Catch including tip was over $80, which I thought was very overpriced.

It seemed this place was understaffed as only 2 waiters and a busboy was serving the entire restaurant and took them at least 10 mins to get our tables cleaned and ready from the previous customers. When we were finally seated, we ordered sweet potato fries, calamari, lets get saucy sushi roll, and coconut shrimp. \n\nThe calamari was decent and came with a wasabi/horseradish sauce and a sweet, sour, and spicy sauce. This was probably the best appetizer dish on the happy hour menu. The sweet potatoe fries were nothing special but a little soggy and less crispy then I expected. The lets get saucy roll was very tasty and I would recommend it.  The coconut shrimp was nothing special but if you like shrimp its decent enough to warrant a order. I also got the Kona Longboard Lager which  was light and slightly more flavorful then bud or coors.\n\nOverall its a decent place for happy hour, especially after nightlife since its a 5 min walk; although the service was subpar due to understaffing.

Sat at the bar and got promptly waited on. We ordered a steak taco, spicy tuna roll, and salmon pok\u00e9. Our waitor recommended this seared ahi tuna taco that was sooooo good. He also recommended my friend this spicy margarita drink that had vodka, passionfruit juice & jalape\u00f1os in it. It was good but WAY too spicy for us lol. No harm though for happy hour since it was only like $4. I paired my food with the mai thai. *caution* it is very strong so be prepared lol.

The other, I brought upon myself.\n\nBeing Asian (Chinese) and a Student.  Not just a fresh-faced co-ed.  Graduate school.  Professional.  Which means my metabolism can't run on ketchup packets and instant ramen anymore.  Neither can I pull all-nighters and still be coherent enough to be in public the next day.  \n\nThe Asian in me loves a good deal.  That's not so bad.  Until you find yourself at home, after a \"great\" shopping spree with 5 mismatched shoes, none of which are your size.  Just because it was on sale.  And SOMEONE you know must have that size feet.  Then, I look around to make sure that no one is looking.\n\nThe Student in me, hates it more and more each day.  Just last week, one of my classmates looked at her loan debt.  HOLY CRAP-O-LA, the amount we have to pay back is like a mortgage!  It's more than a mortgage!  This affirms my current trend of not going on the interwebs for anything productive.\n\nAnd all this verbal garbage finally brings us to Pacific Catch.  They have a happy hour, which pleases me greatly.  They have food on their happy hour which pleases me even more.  The food includes hawaiian poke (yay raw raw raw fish!), california rolls (real crab, fake sushi), and fried calamari (i just can't get enough of this squiggly stuff).\n\nHowever, the alcohols are still expensive.  I'm expecting something in the $5 a glass range.  But I think they are more along the $7/glass.  Maybe the rouge rough uncouth uncultured student in me has no idea that what they are really serving is the most delectable wine known to the inner sunset.  And if I can't tell, neither can my wallet.  Or my loan debts.  Oh god.  \n\nTo summarize, I would come here for the happy hour, and focus more on the food.  The portions are very generous, there is nothing dainty about it.  Because if you think about it, a roll still uses about 1/2 a cup of rice, which is as much rice as you should be eating in one sitting, you fatty globby sweaty smelly library-hugger.  I like to keep it high in protein with the hawaiian poke.  \n\nMaybe I'll finally learn my lesson and just be content with 2 bar bites.  Do not let the judgmental eye of the waitress guilt you into ordering alcohol.  No, no, no!  You must pass your classes.  \n\nNow, go.  And eat something.", "author": "Christina C."}

In this particular review, however, I am going to focus on our New Years Eve dinner.\n\nMy husband and I opted not to make a big production for dinner the New Years.  Generally, we go downtown somewhere for a fancy-dress pricey prix fixe meal.  This year, that just wasn't our speed.  We wanted something nice but a little more low key and less expensive.\n\nBecause we always enjoy our meals there, we checked out Pacific Catch.  They too had a prix fixe choice but it was only $49 a couple.  I was certain I'd misread that but it really was $49 for two people.  We examined the options and decided to make a reservation.\n\nWhen I told my friend about our plans, she and her beaux wanted to come along too.  So I called on Dec 28th praying I could make the change.  No Problem!  In fact, later that afternoon, I called and added another two to our party.  I was stunned.  No hassle.  No problem with two last minute changes. No \"well, we can only fit you in at either 4:15 or 11:45pm\" kind of b.s.  No B.S. at all.  \n\nBetween the price and the ease of changing reservations, I felt like it must be too good to be true.  What horrors could we expect?  I figured I'd hope for the best and see.\n\nAnd so, the six of us arrived for our reservation, dressed only slightly better than casual.  We ordered a ton of food, cocktails and wine.  Everything was absolutely delightful from the easy parking, to the outstanding service, to the copious amounts of fresh seafood served with round after round of cocktails.  We had an absolutely great time.  \n\nAnd then, then the time of reckoning came in the form of the check.  The six of us had ordered far more than allotted by our prix fixe menus.  I slowly opened the cover, afraid of the damage I thought we'd incurred. I was shocked!  It was under $300.  You could have knocked me over with a feather.\n\nPacific Catch, I am impressed!  A bunch of food snob-hipsters all thoroughly enjoyed our New Years dinner.  Your food and level of service was incredibly competitive and even better than many options that I've had downtown for much more money.  GREAT EXPERIENCE!", "author": "Amy A."}

It does look like a big ol' chain-style seafood place from the outside and i still miss Canvas, the cafe that used to be in this location but took a deep dive in the dot com bust. The inside is nicely decorated and the layout is good considering how odd the floor plan is. (Canvas always seemed a little... lopsided.)\n\nThe bf and i wound up here because we wanted a restaurant that had both decent tequilla and small tapas-like plates. This was the only place that fit our specs and fancy that night in the Inner Sunset. I thought the food was good. Not spectacular but definitely yummy. I like that many cuisines styles are available: noodles, sushi rolls, seafood, Hawaiian, Americana. The sauces are a little heavy but i'd eat there again w/o hesitation. Pricing was reasonable. Probably better if you hit a happy hour.  \n\nI'm giving this review 4 Stars instead of 3 Stars because I liked that the place looked very family friendly; a lot of the groups waiting to be seated had three generations. Also the dining area was roomy enough to space tables appropriately for families with young (= loud) kids. I don't have kids and we sat in the bar area but it's nice to see restaurants in SF that can accommodate families with kids.

The Tuna was not fresh, and one time the waitress said that \"its just a different kind of tuna\". I eat a lot of Poke, and  I just got back from Maui a few days ago so I know exactly how fresh tuna looks. Not sure if the chef changed, but the quality of this poke has definitely gone down. Maybe its the days I go when the tuna is not fresh?

They should come up with something else as I can get an agave margarita in 100 other places.\n\nOn two separate occasions I tried two types of HH Rolls ($6 for all types) and they were quite tasty, especially for the price.  A very hearty portion, good flavors and creative.  The California Roll was a little mushy, but they are quite honest to bill it as \"fresh crab SALAD\" instead of just the meat, but again, for the amount and the price, you can't beat it.  The other roll I tried was the Shiso Fine, and that little hit of Shiso leaf added a great dimension to an already good roll.

Since we did that, I had to get brown rice too cause the boyfriend wanted it, but I would have much preferred white rice. Maybe that's why I didn't like the bowl so much but he at least he did. Could have used a little more spiciness to it though. Parking sucks in the area but usually if you drive down into the park area, there's plenty of parking on the sidewalk along the park and its a short walk to the restaurant.", "author": "Thao V."}

I had heard of this place from one of my pharmacists at work, and she had mentioned that this place has Poki Tuna, which I will forever have a place in my heart for.\n\nGetting there wasn't hard. It was very close to where I work (and usually try to stay from the neighborhood on my non-work nights). My wife had known beforehand that I would get a UCSF discount of 15%, so she asked me to bring my work badge. Parking could've been a disaster if it wasn't for a tiny space in the tiny parking lot located on the Lincoln Ave. side of the restaurant. And when I say tiny, I MEAN TINY! When we went inside, the seater at the front asked us if we had a reservation or if we wanted to wait for our seats. My wife had already taken care of this, and she reserved us a table for two. Upon showing it to the lady at the front, she acknowledged it.\n\nOur server was very friendly (and a bit too peppy if you ask me, which isn't always bad) and took our orders for our drinks and appetizers. Anyway, we ordered some appetizers (sushi using brown rice and POKI TUNA!!!), which were uncommonly good.\n\nOur main courses were BOMB! My wife got a surf-and-turf combo, and I got a Korean BBQ combo plate. I am going out on a limb and saying that the Poki was definitely on par with Roy's! The meat was very tender (my Korean BBQ) and wasn't hard to swallow at all.\n\nIf there was a gripe I had, it would have to be our seating placement. We were right next to the backdoor, which felt kinda awkward when people were leaving or coming on that way. Otherwise, I had no qualms with our choice of restaurant on our anniversary dinner.\n\nP.S. The best part of the experience (food-wise) was the chocolate lava cake we got ON THE HOUSE! It was very chocolatey and gooey, which was a good contrast to the seafood we were having. A+!", "author": "Geric O."}

I seriously thought parking would be cake, since the park is across the street and by evening time all cars would be gone leaving plenty of street parking. WRONG! NO PARKING during evening hours stated clearly on the signs, but many cars were parked. A cop car drove in and I decided not to risk it. They do have a small parking lot next to the restaurant, but it fills up quickly. I suggest biking or walking. What better way to burn off those after dinner calories than riding/taking a stroll in GG park (warning: it gets really dark in there at night)?!\n\n- Salmon Teriyaki Bowl ($14.95): Asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, grilled bok choy, sesame seeds with teriyaki sauce, served over pineapple fried rice (I substituted with brown rice). The brown rice was a little too hard for my liking. Other than that, I really liked the abundance of vegetables and the sweet/flavorful mix of pineapple in the rice was delicious. \n\n- Sushi Grade Ahi Salad ($12.95): Subsituted with Hawaiian Poke. Avocado, daikon sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds with soy-wasabi vinaigrette. The portion size of this salad is quite generous, great for a meal or for sharing with another dish. The poke accompanied the vegetables well giving me a healthy yet satisfying feeling of fullness. \n\n- Pineapple-Orange-Guava juice ($2.95): Tasted just how it sounds like; a mixture of all 3 with the guava juice standing out the most. Came in a pretty small glass, so I didn't feel like I got my money's worth. \n\nNo reservations were made and there were plenty of empty tables in the main dining area, but the hostess escorted us and said the only table available was in the bar area. I did not even see the empty tables in the dining area fill up throughout my meal. I don't like the tables at the bar, not much leg room. Other than that, service was quick and efficient. The poke salad and rice bowls are definitely worth coming back for! \n\nP.S. Opened late until 11PM on Sun-Thurs and 12AM on Fri & Sat, score!", "author": "Tracy T."}

There were bell peppers diced into my soup with celery and what looked like green salsa/hot sauce atop of it. The crab was fresh but the overall taste of everything together tasted like they threw it all together to become a soup. To top it all of too, my plate was warmer than my soup. I saw the soup sitting there for awhile, unaware that it could be mine.\n\nMy friends and I came at 2:30PM with minimal amounts of people, however that also translated to minimal amounts of service.

Like, one for breakfast and one for lunch... because this place would get five stars for the bar and four on dinner. But failing that, I'm breaking out the elusive fifth star on the bar alone.\n\nFirst up, this place serves Flor de Cana as its house rum. If you've never had Flor de Cana then you are missing out. Made in Nicaragua, I have yet to see it for sale direct to consumers outside of its native country. But in Nicaragua, you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a bottle. States side, it's a rare treat... except not anymore, because I can get it any day I want, especially between the hours of 4-6 M-F and after 10 every day, when well drinks are just four dollars.\n\nBut no review is complete without a mention of their poke. In my mind Pacific Catch serves the archetypical poke. Healthy chunks of well marinated tuna with crispy won-ton-eqsue things. Seriously, I could eat it every day. And during happy hour, it's only like $5+ (usually $8-9). Paired with a rum and coke, I can't imagine a better way to relax after work.\n\nTruth is, as much as I love the food and drink, I think what really makes the Pacific Catch bar great is ambiance. From the little group tables, to the high table for two, the whole place is just built for relaxation. Most bars I find to be on either too grungy or too snooty. For me, Pacific Catch is just perfect, and I'm looking forwards to getting to know the bartenders as I develop \"regular\" status.", "author": "Sean K."}

It just looked like some big chain fish place. How dare they!\n\nSo given that, I really have been surprised at how much I've liked the food here and have been back several times with the g/f. We've liked the salads but better are the fish tacos and most of their fish entrees. I love the sweet potato fries and the free edamame and pretzels to snack on while waiting. And the wait usually isn't that long.  We haven't been here in about 2 months so maybe it's gone downhill (judging by a few reviews below) but for us the food has always been tasty and the experience has always been good. \n\nI will say I recommend the fish tacos at Underdog's taco shop down the street even more, but if you're here, they're solid. And I also had a very good fish sandwich.  I would stay away from the Sushi here just because there are some great Sushi specialty places right nearby that do it better, not because it was terrible per se.  But the sandwiches, fish entrees, tacos, all that is good. And we also dig the artichoke appetizer. \n\nAll in all, I still miss the cafe but no longer think this place is evil for existing.", "author": "Craigary P."}

I arrived thinking I wanted the seared ahi salad, but that quickly changed as we browsed the menu.  Instead, we opted for a few appetizers and two sushi rolls to share.  The sweet potato fries were irresistible- not too greasy; I kept chomping on them! The Hawaiian Poke and the Shrimp Ceviche starter plates both came with plenty of poke and shrimp pieces. I loved the lime-cilantro-avocado sauce the shrimps were covered in.\n\nThough the starter plates were great, I think the sushi rolls were only ok.  We asked for brown rice for the rising sun and the firecracker salmon rolls.  I was not impressed by the rolls because the brown rice didn't stick too well and the rice fell apart.

I came here around 11pm last night for some late night happy hour eats after having gone to a private event at the CA Academy of Sciences across the street in Golden Gate Park. \n\nPrices were very reasonable ranging from $4.95 to $5.95. We ordered the following:\n\nCalamari\nCoconut Shrimp\nAsparagus and Shitake Mushroom sushi\nA mix of seasoned and unseasoned sweet potato fries and seasoned fries\n\nThe place is very spacious and has high ceilings. The service is good, but as much as I want to give this place more stars I just can't. Here's why:\n\nThe calamari had slices of lemon battered and fried along with the calamari. That would have been fine if the calamari didn't taste soggy.\n\nThe coconut covering around the shrimp kept falling off. It was hard to take a bite out of the shrimp without having the the batter completely fall apart off the shrimp. On the bright side the coconut  batter was nice and crunchy, but that could have been because it was overly fried. \n\nJust a tip, if you see that fried items are not a golden brown, but a dark brown, it could be because the items have been either re-fried or fried for too long.\n\nThe seasoned sweet potato fries were so peppery you couldn't taste the sweet potato at all. It comes with two dipping sauces, one is a sweet sauce, the same one you get with the coconut shrimp, and the other is supposed to be a tangy sauce, but tasted too vinegary. \n\nThe unseasoned sweet potato fries tasted a little better, but felt too soggy and soft to me. They are thinly sliced, and I think I would have preferred if it they were more crunchy. \n\nThe only bright spot was the asparagus and shitake mushroom sushi, which was delicious. It would have been nice if it came with a little saucer of soy sauce or something so you could mix the wasabi in it for dipping.\n\nThis place might be great for dinner, but for their happy hour eats I didn't think they were that great.", "author": "Lyn L."}

I went with the grilled salmon salad. Before the food arrives you will get an appetizer, fresh cold lemon green beans and  very cute  fish shaped crackers. I never had these kinds of beans before, very cool. The salad was served quickly after, and was nothing short of amazing (see picture.) The salmon was grilled crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside. The salad consisted of bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms, and various salads, mostly baby leafs making it very crunchy. It also came with what I understand was a yoghurt/lemon/soy sauce dressing. It was blissful, never had anything like it before. Another cool thing: the salmon skin is deep fried and served as a replacement for croutons to make everything a little crunchier, very cool idea.

Normally for me that means dude, don't order it - but I did. It was spicy - but tolerable, as in I didn't need to drink 4 ounces of water and wait 2 minutes after swallowing before the next bite. And the rest of it was really good - fresh, hot, a good mix of veggies with everything else.\n\nWe didn't order dessert - probably because dad was pretty ticked off.\n\nI give it a 4 for this visit, this is ignoring the negatives about the server - he's human and it seemed like he had the potential to be just as nice as all of the other servers. But he should've not been wearing jeans that sagged (other staff weren't).\n\nI give everyone else in my party a 2. For not trying other things on the menu. For getting angrier than they should've at the server and making it even more of an unpleasant time for all of us. For all of them saying i was weird for not ordering fish tacos then asking me to help them finish theirs even before i finished my fantastic rice bowl.", "author": "Emmet M."}

Ideally located on a corner spot, near Golden Gate Park, Pacific Catch has an expansive and airy feel.  Add to that the double happy hour times (4-6pm & 10-closing), and you have yourselves a very pleasant atmosphere in which to relax and chat over some mighty fine beverages.  (Don't forget to add sweet potato fries!)\n\nDinners are quite tasty as well, though all dishes are not created equally.  By far the best bang for the buck is the Wasabi bowl (around $16) with your choice of protein (I'm a fiend for the Hawaiian poke).  You get a huge bowl of rice, seaweed salad, sprouts, wasabi, and all sorts of other tasty additions, plus of course, the poke.  This is the dish that, when ordered, everyone at the table sort of eyes ruefully, perhaps wishing they'd ordered it themselves.  Combine this with the spicy martini (vodka, chili peppers, passion fruit juice), and there I am: leaning back, rubbing my belly, convinced I'm on a tropical vacation, with nothing to do except melt into a silky little puddle of happy place.  \n\nPacific Catch strikes me as more of a chill with friends or colleagues place, rather than a hot date place.  It is good for groups (definitely make reservations).  I've been told that groups have a 2 hour time limit (even on weekdays), though in my experience that has yet to be enforced.\n\nSo to recap:\nGo spend a sunny day in the park, get here in time for happy hour, eat, rub your belly.

I have always heard such good things and could not accept that lame appetizer as the true essence of Pacific Catch. After many hours at the Academy of Science, I wanted Seafood, and Pacific Catch was right there on the corner to full fill my needs! It just so happened to be happy hour too. We were welcomed into a spacious and rather 'safely' designed ambiance - nothing special but still comfortable and nice. \n\nAnyway, onto the food! Unfortunately I have to do that thing where you can only technically review the happy hour but everything I saw come out of the kitchen looked amazing! We got: plenty of beer, sweet potato fries, calamari, spicy tuna roll and a few sides of rice. I know, nothing totally unique but regardless we had a great experience.

We dropped by my folks place after lunch, and since they haven't seen the kids in a while, they wanted to spend some time with them. They offered to watch the girls and feed them dinner, so the wife and I can go out for dinner. \n\nWhat a nice surprise! An unexpected date night with my wife. Yeah, we were still full from lunch, but we took my folk's offer and headed out. Problem was that it was 7PM on a Saturday night, we had no reservations, and most places were pretty crowded already. We struck out on a couple of places either because parking sucked (No Nopa this time), business closed (bye PJ's), or I was wearing the wrong clothes (I had a sweater, and Naan and Curry was steaming inside, unless I wanted a permanent tandoori smell).\n\nWe walked into Pacific Catch, and got a table in the bar area. Pretty lively inside the bar area, with the Cal vs. UCLA hoops game going on (too bad Cal). A lot of people in the bar section were dining in, so the waitresses were doing double duty serving drinks and serving food. \n\nWe ordered: \n\n-House Cured Sake Salmon. This came with 2 crispy nori rice cakes, wasabi creme fraiche, onions, and black tobiko caviar. Salmon had a mildly cured taste, the wasabi creme fraiche had a little, but not overpowering kick. Rice cakes were nice and crispy. OK starter. \n\n-2 Chipotle BBQ Salmon Tacos. This was a mistake. My wife wanted 1 salmon taco, and one Cabo shrimp taco, but they gave her 2 salmon tacos, but she didn't complain. These taco were topped with cabbage, corn salsa, and lime crema. Nice big chunk of salmon in each taco, and very tasty. \n\n-5 piece Fish and chips. Fish of the day was rock cod. This came with cole slaw and sweet potato fries. Lightly battered so not to overwhelm the fresh rock cod. Very juicy and moist on the inside, slight crispiness on the outside. Came with a jalapeno tartar sauce and and a Thai sweet chili sauce. I added some more sriracha sauce for more kick. Purple-cabbage cole slaw had a nice light vinaigrette for refreshing taste, instead of a creamy sauce. Sweet potato fries were great. Not overly fried, but crispy enough so I could still taste the sweet potatoes. \n\nToo full for dessert : ( \n\nFood came out pretty quickly, and the servers remembered and follow on requests in spite of the bar being elbow to elbow. \n\nI driven by this place for years while driving along Lincoln Blvd, and glad we finally tried it.

Inexpensive American/Hawaiian/Australian/Peruvian/pan-Asian seafood with full bar, great cocktails, inventive recipes, sushi rolls, sandwiches, fried dishes.  It's like Roy's, but half the price and twice the fun.  \n\nThe space is stunning, comfortable, elegant, casual, and grand, all at the same time.   25 foot ceiling throughout, outdoor heated porch, booths, cushions, bar seats, kitchen counter seats, all spaced far enough that you have a little space because it's a huge building and they have room to burn.  It's new, clean, and well-maintained.\n\nOne look at the menu, you're salivating, and you think wow, this could be my favorite place, it's gonna put Park Chow down the street out of business: donburi bowls, fish sandwiches, sushi rolls, poke, ceviche, full fish dinners, fried shrimp...\n\nAnother look at the menu, a third look at the menu.  I got a lot of looks at the menu because nobody came and the kitchen was closing :(  It was overstaffed and they all seemed so busy...talking on the phone, socializing with customers, wandering around lost.  They work on the group waiter situation, so you can get ignored by ten people instead of just one person.  I flagged three people down and still no waiter for fifteen minutes so I finally ordered from the bartender.\n\nWhen the food came it was kind of blah.  Overcooked for the most part, not balanced out very well, definitely nothing exciting.  Coconut rice was mushy and had no spark to it.  Even though they use very ingredients.  I don't think they know what they're doing food-wise, and they seem to be cooking by numbers.  Maybe I shouldn't have ordered the specials - one secret of dining out is don't order the specials at a heavily themed restaurant: they've perfected their staples but don't have the kitchen leadership to invent on the spot.\n\nThe cocktail list was equally appetizing and they delivered on that.  The \"spicy martini\" was worth it, fresh lime, mango puree, vodka, a little syrup, and a fresh hot pepper they must have rimmed the glass with.  Just a really tasty thing to be drinking.\n\nI guess I'll withhold judgment and try it a couple more times before I write it off.  It wasn't the staff, they seemed competent and friendly, just adrift.  I so want to like this place, and if they can get the execution to match the concept this could be big, as in food network tourist towns around the world big.\n\nA tip here: prices are already very inexpensive for what it is, and for happy hour (4-6 and 10 to closing) they have $3 beers and the appetizer menu is discounted even more.  You could stuff your gourd silly on calamari and beer for about twelve dollars a person.", "author": "Gil S."}

A real treat and well made. My only criticism is the steak taco. The meat was good but I think the chef needs to slice the steak into strips rather than just one long piece. Not that easy to swallow. \n\nYet the sweet potato fries were great as well the thinly sliced onion rings on top that had just a faint amount of batter on them. So they had a bit of crunch but were not smothered in a heavy greasy batter as typical onion rings are. \n\nThe Ahi was just right and delicious. The sauces were hot but flavorful. Oh and the homemade Miso soup is satisfying. Also try the Lemongrass Ice Tea, very good when eating those really spicy dishes. So refreshing. \n\nService is good, even when busy and on a weekend, like Friday or Saturday the place gets busy and fills up fast. \n\nWhen I go back I want to try the dessert menu. macadamia nut brownies, sound outstanding as I am a fan of macadamia nut anything.\n\nOne of my coworkers Robert Callan praises Pacific Catch and he too enjoys the fish tacos.

I've tried everything on their happy hour menu and among my favorites are the hawaiin poke, spicy fries, calamari, and lemon drop martini. \nWhy I haven't been in awhile: On 3/17, the waiter handed us a not so fresh order of Hawaiian poke. Its color was brown with a hint of red. My boyfriend and I did not mention anything because we thought they had a bad batch of fish that day. As we were about to leave, we saw a fresh, bright red batch of Hawaiian poke served to the table behind us. \n\nYes, asians don't tend to send their orders back but make sure it does not happen again please. \n\nAnd employee discounts should be allowed even for happy hour then I will think about coming back :).", "author": "Goldie L."}

I had a glass of wine while my friend had some guava drink with mint. She won on the drinks, it was really tasty. We had brown rice sushi as a starter which was good but the rice didn't stick well. For the entree I ordered the Poki Japanese Wasabi Bowl with Brown Rice. First off, they scored major points with me for the brown rice option but secondly, we just came back from Hawaii about two weeks ago and I had a brown rice ahi bowl in Hawaii that this one was 5x's better!

Crispy oysters crispy oysters crispy oysters CRISPYOYSTERS YAY!\n\nI've meant to come here for ages, on the recommendation of one of my foodie friends.  I'm glad I finally did.  I understand this is a local chain, but don't let that deter you: it might be a little sanitized and carefully-put-together, but the food is awesome.\n\nI had the \"mixed catch basket\" ($13.95) and my friend had a mahi-mahi sandwich ($8-$10, not on the menu - mahi mahi, sprouts, avocado, and other apparently delicious accoutrement).  The mixed catch basket has 3-4 crispy oysters (did I mention how much I loved those?), three big pieces of the catch of the day, a skewer of coconut shrimp, and your choice of fries (sweet potato!).  There were also two sauces - one was a ginger-wasabi cream sauce, and the other was a sweet and spicy sauce.\n\nI don't eat much normally, but I scarfed that basket of goodness down like a thirteen-year-old-boy-undergoing-a-growth-spurt.   It was worth every penny.  \n\nAt 5pm on a Thursday it was practically empty, and there seemed to be acres of seating.  The decor is really pretty (I want the graduated hanging-blue-bottle light fixtures, over the bar, for my apartment, please), the service was pleasant, and our food came out quite fast.  \n\nI balk a little at a $6 glass of wine, but I was headed to the Academy of Sciences Nightlife, where wine is $8/glass... so it's all relative, I suppose.\n\nAnd did I mention the crispy oysters?  I think my only complaint was that there weren't more.  To eat on the epic journey to CAS, and to eat on the way back, and to eat for breakfast, and oh for heaven's sake...why don't I have a personal chef?\n\nEDIT - 03/30/09 --\nI took my dad, uncle, and assorted other people here on a Saturday night.  They were pretty good about serving a party of 8, and everyone seemed to enjoy the food.\n\nTwo things I wanted to update about: \n1. The spicy pacific martini.  Holy CRAP, that is good.  Mango puree, vodka, and serrano chili - the perfect fruit drink, with a spicy kick.  Goes so well with seafood, and worth the $8 (I don't say that lightly, either).\n\n2. Food mixup.  When I pointed out to the server that my mixed catch basket lacked crispy oysters (ack!) she was going to bring me a side of them, but ended up bringing me another entire entree!  I was really pleased, and it never hurts to bring home leftovers.", "author": "Jennie K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-13", "description": "Out of the three Pacific Catch locations, I would say this is my overall favorite. Chestnut St. is just way too tiny and crowded, though that might result in the food tasting better because you had to fight so hard to park/get a table. Corte Madera's location is too embedded in the outdoor mall scene and has way too many kiddies running around. But this 9th Ave. location is pretty much perfect with plenty of seating for the bar and regular dining area. It also has its own parking lot so you don't have to compete for the street meters. \n\nFood is pretty consistent at all locations. You can count on the fact that mostly everything you order from the regular menu will be very good. Some of my favorites are the wasabi bowls (with brown or sushi rice) and any of the fried seafood baskets. I love the Mixed Catch Basket with fish, coconut shrimp and crispy oysters with jalape\u00f1o tartar. SO GOOD. Everything comes freshly fried with those awesome sweet potato fries. But eat everything while they are fresh! I don't recommend taking leftover fries home. They really those their flavor after they've cooled down. \n\nThough their sushi roll selection lacks raw fish, I think they are still made very well with the mostly cooked ingredients. One of my favorites and one that DOES have raw fish is the Rising Sun roll. It has tempura shrimp and avocado wrapped in ahi tuna with a citrus sauce. I don't like that they stuff pickled ginger into the roll but if you're like me, just request that they leave it out. Otherwise it's a very tasty roll. The ahi tuna is always fresh and flavorful.  I love that they give you big pieces of it too. (We got that roll totally F-R-E-E! with the coupon in the Green Zebra book!) I could dine happily on their sushi rolls alone. \n\nJust recently I ventured off from my regulars and tried one of the their specials: Trout bbq'd baja style so it was spice rubbed and grilled, served with tomatilla avocado sauce, some thin slices of veggies, and fresh grilled corn over sweet potato fries. I could tell the fish was very fresh but for me, it was TOO seasoned and got a little salty since the fish wasn't very thick. And though I had originally wanted the fries, I would now have preferred and wished that the fish was served over rice. I think I'll stick to my regulars next time. \n\nBig pluses:\n-I've talked to the workers and seen for myself that Pacific Catch is environmentally conscious. They use biodegradable materials, from the takeout containers to the straw in your drink. Pacific Catch also practices composting from their kitchen to the leftover food scraps. Smiles all around. =D\n-I don't know anywhere else that you can get UNLIMITED refills on Thai iced tea. I could drink three glasses easy. LOVE IT!", "author": "Julia T."}

Casual and easygoing environment with decent prices, good food, and fruity cocktails.\n\nI've been here a few times before and I've always had a good time.  Several times I've ordered the fish tacos, poke, and fantastic speciality cocktails who's names I cannot recall.  I've had the coconut shrimp--which were only OK, but since they came with sweet potato fries, I was a happy camper and forgave the overly friend shrimps.  The desserts were HEAVEN.  The Macadamia Nut chocolate cake was to die for.  Very rich, so share with at least one other person.\n\nI recent went there with a few friends for Happy Hour (4-6 weekdays).  I have to say I had a great time.  We sat near the bar on a few couches and ordered a truck-load of food: Poke for half price (instead of $11.95 its only $5.95, and seriously its the regular portion!), Spicy Tuna Rolls, calamari, and sweet potato fries for only $3.  The spicy tuna roll was OK, but everything else was heaven.  It also helps that there's $3 pints and $4 well drinks.  NICE.  \n\nThe service is attentive and friendly.  Our waiter got extra points for checking in with us before Happy Hour was over (\"Do you want to order anything else before HH ends?\"---loved it!).\n\nPC is also a place I want to bring friends who visit from out of town. Its a nice place to grab some fusion Pacific-region food and fancy cocktails that you can't find anywhere else.\n\nParking off of Irving is always tough, but during happy hour it was easy to find parking on surrounding streets.

I am very familiar with this particular conundrum, which for some reason seems to affect fish restaurants more than, say, steakhouses, which is odd because you would think people who went to steak restaurants would be less picky about their diets than those who went to fish places.\n\nIn any case, Pacific Catch breaks the mold, at least a little bit, because there's a specifically non-fish, vegetarian salad on the menu.  It comes with seared tofu that looks slightly like fish but that is kinda a little bit tasteless.  It's all right, though, and the rest of the salad is pretty delicious.\n\nI wasn't expecting much from this place when I came here, and I pretty much hated Canvas Gallery (this location's former business), so I was pleasantly surprised.  Not four-star-rating surprised, but surprised nonetheless.\n\nIt was annoying having to wait even though there were plenty of empty tables.  I got the distinct impression that they didn't have enough servers working, so filling up those tables with that staffing would have been disaster, but it is strange to see so many clean, empty tables when you're waiting outside in the cold for one.\n\nThe service is all right, although the lack of servers shows.", "author": "John S."}

I was already half full at this point so I didn't enjoy my entree as much as I could have had I been famished.  Overall pretty tasty still. The rice is sushi rice (slighty sour), kinda neat.  All 3 ways of the ahi were raw. I had a bite and liked it. But I don't know about eating a whole entree of raw fish and sushi rice. Korean bbq beef was sweet and fatty and juicy and all that good stuff.\n\nDinner for three=$87 plus tips.\n\nWould come back again, but this time will be mentally prepared to dish out some cash.", "author": "Xiaoyin W."}

Ok so when you offer good fries, I'm pretty easy to please.  It's great that they allow you to mix up the different kinds of fries too.  I also really liked their veggie roll (it's worth the price during HH) and actually I'm not sure why peeps are complaining about their mojitos because I really liked mine.  My favorite drink is the Spicy Pacific... some concotion of passionfruit nectar and jalapenos.  I know it sounds weird and gross, but it's SO GOOD... try it!!!  Oh, and though I don't eat fish, my friend craves the poke specifically from here at least twice a month.\n\nAMBIENCE:  This is actually much nicer and much more spacious than the PC in the Marina district.  A good place for a date.  High ceilings keep the restaurant from getting too stuffy. Lighting is slightly subdued and gives a vaguely sexy feel to everything. The best part?  TWO Happy Hours on weekdays - 4-6 pm, then again from 10 pm to closing.  Boo-yah!\n\nPRICES: Fairly reasonable, especially during HH.  One can easily have good food and two drinks for under $20 and not have to eat dinner afterwards.  And the portions are fairly generous so you definitely get your money's worth.\n\nPARKING: There's actually a lot behind the restaurant, but it fills up rather quickly.  As with most things in SF, it's always better not to drive, but if you must take your car then know that there's usually more parking along the avenues east of the restaurant (try scoping 5th-8th avenues).\n\nSee you here for Happy Hour!", "author": "Catherine C."}

When I found out that Pacific Catch was replacing it, I was a little worried about how it would work in the neighborhood. I'm a fan of the Chestnut Street location but that space is much smaller and seems to fit right into its Marina trappings.\n\nSo this past Sunday, we went to this new location around 6pm for an early dinner. The place was pretty busy already and we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table (in the sizable bar area). Maybe it was the time of day, but everywhere we turned was some sort of family, be it a clan of six or new parents with their stroller and youngin' in tow, like us.\n\nOur hostess and waitress were both really friendly and attentive. The menu is a mix of Asian and Seafood, so you'll find sushi mixed in with fish tacos and other seafood dishes, with an emphasis on tuna. I went big and tried the Ahi Three Ways - each variation was fresh with enough character to make the meal a culinary adventure. At $18.95, this might have been the most expensive dish on the menu, but it came with rice, seaweed salad and cucumber salad, so full worth it.\n\nDesserts were intriguing enough that we had to try at least one. This time around, it was the passion fruit cheese cake, and next time I'm sure the mochi fondue will be how we finish. \n\nBeing a new Dad, Pacific Catch is a great restaurant to have around. This location is spacious enough to bring little people, and as mentioned above the staff are more than accommodating (although no diaper changing station in the bathroom). \n\nThey have a full bar, too, so might be a curious place to have a happy hour or something. \n\nParking tip: they still have the adjacent lot for customer parking, so if you're lucky and/or early you can snag one of the seven spaces.", "author": "Nish N."}

It's not ridiculously expensive, but it's not super cheap either...i had a teriyaki chicken rice bowl, which came to about 14 bucks...but it's HUGE.  I couldn't finish more than 1/2...heir coconut shrimp are reallly good too.  My friends like the fish tacos, and they tell me the Poke is the bomb (i don't like sushi, so i will take her word for it =).\n\nThe only problem i have with this place is that they stopped making the teriyaki bowls with the pineapple fried rice....that was my favorite part!  the pineapple chunks were huge and added a lot to the flavor.  they still put \"pineapple salsa\" in there, but it's not the same...i don't know why they stopped serving it, but i was pretty bummed when i found out....however, i will continue to go back there.

Maybe because the last seafood restaurant (pappaboux) I went to was simply amazing, but Pacific Catch made me yearning for more. Like Ellis L. said, the sweet potato fries were good but nothing crazy, the Calamari was good but nothing you cant find at some place like cheese cake factory. And I also tried my friend's poke over rice and it was a little too salty for my taste. \n\nI personally had the swordfish special which was paired with coconut rices blocks which were lightly fried on the outside as well as baby eggplant with a curry seasoning, and a mango salad. The rice was pretty good and had an interesting presentation, the mango salad brought a little acidity to the table which was needed and worked well with the fish. And now to the fish; the swordfish was lightly grilled and had little seasoning. Taste wise, it definitely needed help from the mango salad to bring some zing into the equation. Overall the dish  was so so. I think serving the fish over steamed rice with a mango salsa on top would have worked better.\n\nPacific Catch is definitely a cool place to be.

This place could be a hit, only if it were as good as the original.\n\nMUST HAVE: A map to get to the original (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pacific-catch-san-francisco#hrid:dhLLlLumE3qmnO6xnScwYw).", "author": "Al L."}

We walked into Pacific Catch on a beautiful day.\n\nFor starters we each got the Signature Miso and Shiitake Miso.  I thought the miso could have had a little bit more flavor in the broth, but it was still good.  The shiitake miso had veggies (mushrooms & asparagus) which made it also good.\n\nOur entrees were the Sesame Crusted Ahi and the Crispy Catch of the Day.  I chose the Ahi as a healthy alternative and it was seared perfectly.  The catch was fresh rock cod served with sweet potato fries.  Although the rock cod was battered, it didn't taste to overly deep fried like what you would expect.  Also we ordered 2 a la carte tacos, the BBQ Salmon and the Tropical Shrimp which were very good.\n\nWe noticed there was loud music playing overhead (why?).  We also noticed that Pacific Catch is kid friendly.  This is a plus for parents who are looking for a healthier choice than a diner or greasy spoon.

I walked in and couldn't believe this was my beloved Canvas Cafe once... I miss you Canvas!  They changed everything inside... it is decorated in warm colors and the light are really nice... they look like blue bottles... hmm... they could be bottles. They have lots of booths with comfortable cushions.  We were served by Misa who was really nice and very helpful. She made sure we had our fill of tea and was very attentive.  \n\nHere is what we ordered:\n- Spicy Cabo Calamari | fried with fresh chilis and crispy lemon, served with a chipotle dipping sauce $8.95. This was delicious. The sauce might be too spicy for some. The calamari rings were cooked to perfection (nothing worse than over cooked ring!)\n\n\n- Mixed Catch Basket | 2 pieces of fresh fish, 4 coconut shrimp & 3 oysters with traditional fries $13.95. I would probably just order the Shrimp.  I liked the oysters, but it is not all that... I rather not eat my oysters fried.  The tartar sauce was great. I ordered the seasoned fries with this one.  They were very tasty. Next time I will try the sweet potatoes.  \n\n- Teriyaki Bowl - Topped with asparagus, glazed shiitake mushrooms, grilled bok choy, sesame seeds & house-made teriyaki sauce served over pineapple fried rice with Fresh Salmon $13.95. This was ordered by my friends. I had some of the rice with the sauce and it tasted YUMMMY. \n\n- Mochi Fondu | vanilla, chocolate & coffee mochi ice cream with warm chocolate dipping sauce $5.50 When you get this dessert... eat fast... the hot chocolate makes it a bit difficult to get the mochi out of there before it melts down.  (Suggestion for restaurant owners/chefs - Perhaps if you use spoons or little ladle like utensils it would help save the bites from getting lost in the fondue. The wooden pick slips right off when dipped in the warm chocolate fondue after a few minutes.) I really loved this dessert... YUM! \n\nTotal bill for two was a bit over $50. \n\nI would go back to try some other dishes.  It turned out to be a nice place to go. It does feel a bit chain like, but either way, I still enjoyed it.  I just don't feel like it fits in with the neighborhood.  I am used to the more wall in the hole feel.

The manager working that night was very apologetic about out previous visit and went to great pains to make sure we were taken care of.\n\nThis time, I'm pleased to report that PC lived up to the expectations we'd initially gone in with.  No shards of glass this time. Of course, that's sort of to be expected, but I think our second visit was probably more representative of the typical PC experience and the 4 stars were definitely well-deserved. It was even close to 5 star territory, but again I was hit with a little bout of post-meal queasiness. Not as bad as the first time around but enough that I couldn't in fairness give 5 stars. Still, our meal on this evening was very, very good.\n\nWe started with the house cured sake salmon with nori rice cakes, wasabi creme fraiche, and black tobiko ($9.95), which was out-of-this-world delicious. The craime fraiche could have used a bit more of a wasabi kick, but that's a very quibbling critique of what was a very well executed and beautifully presented dish.\n\nFor my entree I had the Tokyo salmon fish and chips with ginger-wasabi aioli and lemon ponzu ($13.95). Again my only criticism here was the sauces. The ponzu wasn't as tart as I would have liked and the aioli definitely could have been punched up a couple of notches. The most important part of the dish- the fish- was spot on. Crispy on the inside and moist on the inside, just the way it should be. The sweet potato fries were also very tasty.\n\nKatie had one of the specials- hawaiian opah with pineapple fried rice and bok choy ($20ish?). Aside from the bok choy which was very al dente and very difficult to eat (it should have been pre-cut or served with a steak knife- it was very hard to cut with a butter knife and too large and stringy to just take a bite), her meal was excellent. The fish and rice went together beautifully and he bok choy would have been a nice complement if it had been less cumbersome to eat. Katie also had a couple of pomegranate cocktails of some sort which were yummy.\n\nAll in all, an excellent meal and a nice gesture on the part of PC's management to redeem itself and earn back some good will.\n\nWe will definitely be back for more!", "author": "Brian H."}

I was really excited to try this place because the reviews are pretty decent so far.  So we went for the Valentine's Day special for $65.  Everything on there I believe you can order through the chalkboard special menu or regular dinner menu.  \n\nDecor was nice and the place looks a lot bigger than it does from the outside.  I guess I never noticed Canvas was that big inside.  The beech wood on the ceiling brightens up the place while still looking a little romantic, and even the bathroom walls/doors have the little bamboo inside plexiglass look which is nice to look at when you have to pee.\n\nStarter:\nFirecracker roll - a spicy tempura salmon roll\nEntrees:\n1. Ahi Tuna 3 way - poke, sesame seared and another kind of seared with rice, seaweed salad, some terryaki mushroom edamame mix and another mixed salad that could've been one of those japanese mixes with turnip.\n2. Grilled Salmon with artichoke and a layer of tomatos\nDessert:\nMochi ice cream fondue with vanilla, coffee and chocolate flavored ice cream\nDrinks: Sparkling white wine\n\nThe portions were pretty good sized for $65 for 2 people.  The firecracker roll was rather large, but if you look closely, it's a lot of rice wrapped in them.  It still tasted good though and didn't come out looking all sloppy like some restaurants make their sushi.  I really liked the ahi 3-way.  The seared kinds were better and more buttery than the poke, which to me was kind of chewy.  Not exactly the way I pictured poke.  But every other piece was fine.  My husband had the salmon and said he wished he picked something else.  Salmon is salmon - nothing special, but cooked really nicely - not overcooked, just right.  \nDessert was really good.  I love chocolate and I like mochi ice cream on a stick.  This was just right.  \nThe wine was definitely not the best.  I think with our chosen food, the wine just ended up tasting sour.  But I love sweet white wines and that's just my preference.\n\nThe service was really good for such a crowded night.  We had a really upbeat and polite waitress and they served us our food quickly enough.  A nice place to eat overall with a lot more to try.

We worked up quite the appetite and were ready to chow. \n\nI tend to get the same thing every time...Catch of the Day. Sometimes I get the Hawaiian Poki Bowl, which is also awesome and super tasty. But I like to change it up with the drink. Today our server, who was awesome as well, suggested I try this spicy yet sweet cocktail. I cannot remember its name, but it was on the second page of the drink menu on the top of the page. Trust me, I will order this again...and again...and again! It was a nice sweetness from passion fruit juice, but had a nice hit of spice and heat with serrano peppers. Amazing! I know, it sounds like a crazy mix, but it was amazing and very different.\n\nMy friend got salmon fish tacos (she's such a SoCal girl) and Fat Tire's Mothership.

And EVERYONE we knew that has been there told us to get the sweet potato fries. \n\nThe first thing that I noticed was that out of all the booths, the hostess sat us at one where I was literally blinded by the sunlight. I ended up sitting next to my boyfriend, which is nice, but I like sitting across from him so we can talk easier. Our waiter (his name totally slipped my mind, sorry!) was nice and attentive. Took our orders and our appetizers came out in like 10 minutes! Kind of threw me off on how fast it came out. \n\nwe ordered: \n\n- Sweet Potato Fries: My boyfriend is a fries fiend so he totally enjoyed this. I'm not that big on fries, but I must admit that it was pretty delish. \n\n- Hawaiian Poke: My absolute fave of the night. I always have to try poke if a restaurant has it on their menu and this one totally hit the spot. Not as good as homemade, but close enough! Could do without the won ton chips. Would have been great with a seaweed salad. \n\n- Cabo Calamari: This is another dish we usually always try if it's on the menu. We were quite disappointed. Usually when you eat a piece of calamari without the sauce, it should still have some flavor from the breading its coated in, but this was just so...BLAND. Then when we dipped it in the sauce, it completely broke apart. No good. \n\n- Miso Glazed Salmon: Loved the crispy outside and buttery inside. Sauce, mushroom & edamame side, was delicious. The salad on the side was not to my liking. I don't know what it was, but the flavor was horrible and the texture was really tough. \n\n- Korean BBQ Steak: First of all, the waiter hadn't asked my boyfriend how he wanted it cooked. It came out medium rare which was fine though. Tim loved the flavor, but the meat was TOUGH. Don't think it was the way it was cooked, just that that particular cut of meat was tough. He also didn't like the salad. \n\n- Lemongrass Mojito: Pretty good. Bartender made it strong, just the way I like it. \n\nOverall, it was alright.

Apparently, the restaurant was closed for Friends & Family before the grand opening, but they sat us anyway! \n\nFull, tasty menu, same great taste as the Chestnut location.  We were more than pleasantly surprised when they told us our meal was free so that the wait staff could practice on us.  (Our waiter seemed to be able to read out minds when he brought us a glass of water perfectly on time.)\n\nWe had the fried calamari, which was really good, but also really greasy.  I ate 1/3 of the plate and ended up feeling extremely nauseas afterwards.  Probably my own fault for eating so much of it!!!! :)  That being said though, the calamari was extremely soft.  There was no hard calamari texture that you sometimes get.  hurrah!\n\nOur main course came:  Wasabi Ahi Poke bowl with brown rice.  Always an awesome option on the menu.  Wasabi bowl anything is usually reaaaaaallly good.  We also had the Crispy Catch of the Day which came with the sweet potato fries and 2 dipping sauces.  The Talapia was SO good and the sweet potato fries are always delicious.  It was just hard to eat after feeling too woozy from the calamari.\n\nAnyway--loved it!!!! it's going to be hugely successful.

The bf suggested Pacific Catch for the comparable taste.  \nParking was a (%&# as usual around 9th/Irving on a beautiful Sunday afternoon right next to GG park.  All good...beauiful day in the sunset...cant beat those!!  Walked past the cute little tables in their patio and was seated right away and attended to.  The entire menu looked super yum!  I seriously had to narrow it down from sweet potato fries, crispy oysters, teriyaki bowls, macademia crusted seabass, catfish sandwich, sushi....it was rather extensive!!  We finally narrowed it down to....\n\nSpicy Fries:  Normal fries just tossed with a cajun seasoning I think.  I LOVE fries so it was a great version...especially since they were \"skinny\" fries that were super crispy.  The dipping sauces were a nice touch: sweet chili sauce (the one for lumpia!!...I blended that combo LONG before I came here!!  I like their thinking here) and a creamy miso dip!!  yum!!  Mix them together...its perfect!\n\nSalmon Wasabi Bowl:  I thought it was going to be raw salmon but it turned out to be grilled. Apparently the raw stuff is the Hawaiian Poke?  How the hell was I suppose to know that??!!  I wish there was a description on the menu.  Boooo!!  Even though I was in the mood for raw fish the salmon was a great compliment to the brown rice covered with a wasabi miso sauce, radish sprouts, seaweed salad, cucumber salad, pickled ginger and avocado.  It was all the ingredients to a honkin sushi roll but in a bowl.  For about $15, the portions were huge, fresh, and tastey.  I probably ate a little less than half and was STUFFED!  \n\nTuna Wasabi Bowl: Same condiments in the bowl just with lighly seared tuna.\n\nI think I was a little disappointed that the salmon was cooked, obviously my fault, but I still enjoyed my meal.  Looking around at the other tables and their selections, the wasabi bowl was probably the best priced dish.  The menu will definitely bring me back to finalize their rating.

Pacific Catch on 9th lived up to and exceeded our expectations based on our experiences at the Corte Madera and Marina locations.\n\nWe like our poke bowls and didn't stray from our typical ordering.  The poke bowls arrived and were perfectly made.  The poke was fresh, abundant, and authentic (confirmed by the Hawaiian at our table).  It went well with the accompanying seaweed salad, avocado, daikon sprouts, shredded cucumber, and pickled ginger.  The sweet potato fries also hit the spot.  We had some wine and beer but it was too early to have a hard drink from the full bar.  I do look forward to trying their cocktail menu though.\n\nIt seems to be a huge staff.  The waiters seemed a tad nervous but the hostesses, general manager, and head chef were pros.  Overall, service was nice, happy, friendly and attentive.  But granted, it's an opening and to be expected.  We hope they can maintain it.\n\nIt was nice to see that they made good use of the enormous Canvas Gallery space.  There are plenty of comfy booths and tables all around and many counter seats are also available by the kitchen.  The bar is set off and mostly faces Lincoln and the park, which will help to siphon off the expected noise and buzz.  There is also a section by the 9th Street side, which can probably be closed off and booked for private parties.\n\nThe design is warm and inviting, similar to the Corte Madera location.  We liked all the bamboo too.  Good feng shui.\n\nWelcome to the neighborhood, Pacific Catch.\n\nP.S. And to everyone that got annoyed I reviewed this location before it opened, well, hey, tough.  Chalk it up to my rational exuberance.  And c'mon, there are more things in life to have snits about.\n\n6/20/2007\nHow funny.  I had gone to the Pacific Catch in the Marina earlier this month and whined on Yelp about how they should open one in Inner Sunset  (see review on 6/3/2007).  Lo and behold, tonight I walked past where the Canvas Gallery used to be and there are signs plastered advertising that Pacific Catch will soon be opening it's third outpost here on 9th and Lincoln.  Although the owner planned this months before my Yelp whine, score for me!\n\nAnd yes, although I haven't tried the food yet since it hasn't opened (expect late summer), I already give it one more star than the review I gave the Marina Pacific Catch because it will be in my beloved hood and it will have a full bar.\n\nYou can read more here: \nhttp://www.pacificcatch.com/press_sunsetbeacon.html", "author": "Pelle Y."}

They may even have been better than the  ones I had over at Solstice (which is hard to beat) for no other reason than they served them with this amazing creamy dip.

They serve an assortment of seafood in a variety of styles in a very modern setting. \n\nI had an order of the California Rolls, crab salad and Shrimp Teriyaki bowl. All were over sized portions and delicious. This was way too much food to order. The service was beyond my expectation. A full bar added to overall experience. \n\nNo buts, I recommend going there. Good prompt service, tasty food and great drink options make Pacific Catch the darling of the inter Sunset.", "author": "J A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-03-24", "description": "Although like many others, I was sad to see Canvas go, I was also super curious to see what Pacific Catch did with the space.  Since I had a $20 Opentable cheque to use and some friends actually said good things about the new restaurant, I decided to finally give it a try.  Oh and also, nothing seems to be open on Easter Sunday for dinner and we desperately needed to take a friend out for his birthday. \n\nWe had a reservation for 6:30 and one of us was very late, but the hostess and waitress gave us no grief and didn't make us feel guilty at all.  That's a giant plus for me.  It didn't seem like a lot of people made reservations, as our table was the only visible one with the sign \"reservation\" on it.  \n\nThe decor, well, I get it, it's Hawaiian themed.  The color is a bit loud for me and made the space look much smaller than its actual size.  I am glad they retained the high ceiling that I loved when it was Canvas, and we were all in awe that we were sitting where the middle bar used to be.  One thing I really didn't like was the carpet.  It was just ugly.  I don't see why they couldn't do some sort of chic hardwood floor.  And the noise level---it sounded like Happy Hour with a hundred suits packed in some Financial District bar at 5.  \n\nOur waitress was prompt and friendly and efficient.  Our dishes arrived timely.  Among the three of us, we had a basket of sweet potato fries, which was enormous (I mean, it doesn't look like much but sweet potatoes can be dense!)  I don't think anyone can mess up on sweet potato fries, so I was happy.  The sauces were pretty good, but I prefer to eat them without anything.  \n\nI had an unsweetened iced tea, which reminded me of the iced tea from the Grove.  Meaning, it's good---fruity aroma but not actually really sweet.  My boyfriend had a glass of sake.   Our friend had a mojito, which looked really good. \n\nWe wanted to get some grilled corn but apparently they ran out, cuz it was a nice day and therefore everyone ordered corn (our waitress' explanation).  But she came back and told us the kitchen managed to find a piece so they will throw that in our dish.  Free corn?  I was thrilled.  But it was just okay.  I imagined it to be that famous Mexican grilled corn from Cafe Habana in New York, but nope, just your ordinary slightly charred, buttery, hard corn.  Kinda disappointing.\n\nFor entree, I had the ahi poke wasabi bowl.  I am not a huge wasabi fan, but I do enjoy wasabi noodles from the House and thought it might be a subtle flavor like that.  It basically came as a giant bowl with every ingredient you can find in a tuna roll, but deconstructed, and enlarged.  I didn't think the rice was flavored enough to be called \"sushi rice.\"  But the ahi poke was delicious and the soy-wasabi sauce was pungent and flavorful.  Did I mention it's giant?  After my indulgence on sweet potato fries and a piece of corn, I could only finish a quarter of my rice bowl.  I think it'll be good as left over. \n\nThe other two had the specials, sturgeon and some other fish---I can't remember!  Both fish dishes looked just alright to me that I didn't even feel tempted to try them, but they both claimed that the dishes were good.  So I will take their word for it.  \n\nWe also shared a macadamia nut brownie with ice cream.  It was nice and sweet, and comes in a good portion for sharing.  \n\nThe restaurant was packed around 6:30 but by the time we left at 9, it was practically empty.  Sorta surprising to me that people ate so early.  I was glad that no one pressured us to leave long after we ate everything and paid and sat around.  But then again, it wasn't like they needed the table or anything. \n\nI would go back for the fries.  And possibly go for their Happy Hour special which seems to be a good deal.  $3 beers and little munchies to go along.", "author": "Candice B."}

My biannual dinner with Dad day came around and we decided to check this place out. \n\nParking, always a bitch in this part of the Sunset wasn't too bad. By that I mean that we got lucky and actually found a spot on 9th. We walked in and were greeted by the hostess and advised that we would have to wait for a table unless we didn't mind eating in the bar. Cool. I don't really care. The hostess lead us to the bar where we were seated at the most awkward table that I have ever sat at. The table doesn't give you room for your legs causing you to sit back and lean forward in an awkward position when eating. It appears that the owner never sat at these tables prior to buying them. \n\nIt then came time to order drinks and I was pleasantly surprised with their beer selection. I had a Tahitian beer that I really enjoyed. \n\nI can't remember exactly what we ordered bu know that the Ahi Poki was the most memorable. This place is fresh, fresh fresh!

The selection of fish was severely limited, the beer list was nothing special, and the atmosphere is loud and uncomfortable.  I couldn't hear a damned thing over the classic rock blasting throughout.  This place feels corporate.  Kind of like The Olive Garden or something.  \n\nI ordered fish tacos.  They were soggy and small and totally overpriced.  The tomatillo sauce on said tacos was tasty but overpowering and overabundant.  The Thai Iced Tea was too milky and its flavors were unbalanced.  The sweet potato fries, however, were fantastic.  Salty and sweet and fried up right.  So good in fact that I'm gonna give this place another star.\n\nThe service was friendly and quick for the most part.  I was seated immediately and brought edamame and pretzels promptly.  I ordered a beer and had to wait awhile before it came.  My server forgot that I ordered it.  I could tell because I saw him walk by my table and look at me, and when he did that this look came over his face like \"oh shit!\" and he walked quickly to the kitchen.  A minute later I had my Oatmeal Stout.  I didn't really hold that against him though because he was otherwise attentive and nice, and I didn't really have to wait THAT long.  Everybody forgets shit from time to time.  \n\nAnother thing that was great:  They brought us the check like a few seconds after we asked for it.  I HATE it when I have to wait forever for the check.  As if it were some kind of pleasure to linger for 15 minutes in a restaurant after the food has been eaten and drinks have been drunk.  Nicely done.  \n\nSo...quick and polite service, but lame overpriced food and chain restaurant ambiance.  Bleh...I'm not coming back.", "author": "Michael H."}

As I expected, it is really crowded for dinner, but I didn't mind.  We waited about 20 min. for a table, so Garren and I ordered a beer and a mai tai.  The mai tai was small but very strong.  I was buzzed after drinking a third of it.  When we finally got a table, we ordered the salmon tempura roll, the salmon sandwich, and the catch of the day basket.  All of the food was delicious, but I figured out that I don't really like fried musssles (I don't blame the food, just my taste buds).  I also ordered the lime in the coconut drink, but it just kind of tasted like water.  I don't think I'd order it again.  \n\nAfter we were done eating the waitress told us that that I get a free birthday dessert.  We told her that we were so full, and couldn't eat anymore.  Then she said, \"Oh, not even a scoop of ice cream?\"  Soooo, we said, \"Alright then, thank you.\"  When we got the bill, she ended up charging us for the \"free birthday dessert.\"  I don't even think that a scoop of ice cream was supposed to be the \"free birthday dessert.\"  There were many other people getting these fancy-looking desserts, with candles, and they were not on the dessert menu.  I am assuming that those were supposed to be the free birthday dessert.  I don't know.  \n\nI like the food from here, but I did not like how we got charged for a \"free\" not even birthday dessert.

Having a little snack while I'm waiting for my food is exactly what I need to put me in a good mood again. \n\nI'm in love with their Ahi Tuna bowl with brown rice.  The tuna is always PERFECTLY seared... except for the one time I ordered it to go.  By the time I got back to the office, it had cooked itself in the box, unfortunately.  \nBut at the restaurant, it's always cooked on the outside, and still pink and juicy in the middle.  You also get little bits of seaweed salad, sprouts, and pickled vegetables.  Tasty!\n\nThey also have fun, sugary martini drinks, which I always enjoy (after work, of course).  I wish they'd have a happy hour discount on them, though, because it's a little cost prohibitive to have more than one.  \n\nSpeaking of cost-prohibitive, I would come here more often if their entrees were also a little less expensive.

His Yelp is as valid as mine since we are in this together.  \n\nSo, we had a nice delicious date night at Pacific Catch on 9th Street. Initially I planned on taking a nice walk at the Botanical Garden at Golden Gate Park to induce some nature in sweetie's system but it closes at 5 pm which meant it will be too early for dinner at Pacific Catch. So, we slept in anyway on that day and didn't make it to the City until almost 7 PM.  \n\nFound parking at GG Park as soon as we entered the park. Crossed Lincoln holding hands and informed the hostess that we had a 7:30 reservation at 6:50 PM. Got seated right away.  I felt sad!!!! This used to be Canvas Cafe where my very, very dear friend Russell used to perform.  I remembered the good old days when he used to bring down the house!!!!! \n\nAnyway, sweetie and I got a welcome appetizer of Asian pretzel and edamame. We barely had time to eat it when our appetizer of fried oysters arrived. It was actually very good!!! The oysters were fresh and light.  (Our waiter was very prompt and attentive.)  I really wanted to order the famous rice bowls but I opted for ahi tuna 3 ways!!!! And 3 ways I was pleased.  Sweetie got the beef with prawns.  I don't know what it was called because I was busy concentrating on my tuna.  He said his was delicious except it was not enough. (Disclaimer:  my sweetie is a hefty eater. Pacific Catch's portions are adequate for normal human eaters like me who is Asian, petite but can pack  it in once in a while if the food is yummy!)  \n\nThen we shared the mochi fondue which was nice contrast between the hot and the cold. Cold ice cream wrapped in the soft skin of rice flour dipped in hot smooth chocolate. The flavor just burst in my mouth.   \n\nOverall, the experience was great.  I still could not give it 5 stars, though, even though the venue was hip and welcoming.

I really thought the food was superb.  I had the Ahi menage trois aka, ahi 3 ways.  I have to start with the Poke, which unlike most places make it really small.

He asked us if we wanted anything to eat as we waited, filled our water cups, and gave us our complentary plate of edamame and pretzel gold fishes. \n\nTo start we ordered Rock & Roll and also sweet potatoe fries. The sweet potatoe fries were really good and the sauce was delicious. Rock & Roll, not so much - it's not that it was bad, rolls are just not a good choice for this restaurant. Anywho, my friend and I ordered the wasabi bowl with ahi tuna and crab salad to share. The bowl was really good and had huge portions. The salad had a lot of crab, but not much flavor. The Thai salad on the other hand I liked. My other friend ordered the salmon sashimi. It wasn't good and unlike the heaping portions of salad and wasabi bowl - it was lacking. She ended up eating from our plates. The meal came out to $80 with tax and tips. A little pricey, but considering what we ate and the occasion, it was pretty good.

Instead of serving you bread, they give you a small plate of fish pretzels and edamame beans.  \n\nThey have a large variety of dishes to try.  I like their wasabi bowls.  It comes with seaweed, fish (depending on what kind, I get the Ahi Tuna or Poke Tuna), guacamole, and some other ingredients I don't remember.  The bowl itself is pretty big, and will definitely fill you up!  It costs about $15 for this bowl.  Their sweet potato fries are also very delicious, served with sweet and sour sauce.  Their sushi rolls are average, and nothing spectacular...\n\nI tried their soup special one day... I forget the actual name of it, but it was similar to a ciopinno.  It was a tomato based soup with seafood.  The broth was very flavorful!  There was plenty of content in the soup too.  I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it!!  The soup cost about $12 though.  But very delicious.  It's something not always on their menu.\n\nTheir fish and chips were very good, comes with about 3-4 pieces depending on what combo you get...  The fish was fresh.  I also got a fish special of the day.  The fish was cooked nicely, and not overcooked.  I don't remember what was in it, but it was reallygood over all.\n\nOverall, if you go here, get their fish dishes.  It's not as cheap as the other restaurants on Irving, but it's worth it for what they give you.

Several of the appetizers are also discounted between $5-$8 and they're really nice quality and a handsome portion.  \n\nWe've been sticking to the Hawaiian Poke because it's a great bang for your buck, but we've also tried 2 different sushi rolls which were great and well worth the cost.

They had a variety (fish tacos, ahi poke, fish & chips etc...Hawaiian Fusion).  My sister thought this place would cost us an arm and a leg due to the ambiance but it just cost us part of an arm which wasn't bad for seafood. Hey...

After years of my boyfriend trying to get me to go, I finally decided to give them a shot. I started off small, I got their 3 tacos; two chicken and one mahi mahi. All I have to say is that the mahi mahi is far better than the chicken! But what made me an immediate fan was their fried dulce de leche spring rolls. I drool at the thought of them, they are that delicious. The springrolls are crunchy on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside and here's the kicker, a really yummy scoop of ice cream with a caramel drizzle. This thing is a heart attack on a plate, but a heart attack that I'm willing to suffer. \n\nMy second visit I decided that since I had a great experience with their seafood the first time, that I would try experimenting something new. I ordered the seared ahi macadamia, the best ahi I've ever had. For those of you who don't like ahi because of it's aftertaste or \"fishy\" taste, this dish does not have anything like that. The ahi has a yummy mango thai citrus salad that really compliments the ahi and is delicious!\n\nThe bar scene can be really fun, it's nice to stop by, have an appetizer and beer and watch the local games. \n\nAs far of prices, for a party of 2 with 2-3 drinks total, one appetizer, 2 entrees, dessert and coffee with run you close to $80, so for a full course meal it's not that pricey!", "author": "Hedieh G."}

I'd order this again.  OK.. all good on the dessert.\n\nThe three tacos I ordered up as the main dish were decent.  I ordered one each of (1) a Grilled Mahi-Mahi taco,  (2) a traditional Baja-style fried fish taco, and (3) one shrimp taco.  As for Taco #2, I think I've had better at Rubios.. Um. wait.. I have..  The others were okay. The best was probably the shrimp taco.  \n\nGrilled Corn - this little side dish was complemented beautifully with a flavorful chili-lime butter - AWESOME butter. but hey.. they didn't grill the corn the whole way - either that, or it was just sitting around too long after leaving the grill.  Parts of the kernels were clearly COLD upon biting em.. \n\nThe Mahi-Mahi Teriyaki Bowl my significant other had was overseasoned and covered in a heavy sweet sauce that completely drowned out any other flavors or texture that once were part of the pineapple fried rice which became almost mush.   The Mahi itself was perfectly prepared.  What a bummer.  Maybe the better way to go here is to go instead with the brown rice they also offer as an option.\n\nService: So-so.  Our greeter and waitress were very friendly and greeted us with HUGE smiles and a wonderful attitude, but once we ordered up our food, our server was very hard to find, even though we were seated near the front of the restaurant where all of the OTHER servers congregated.  It seemed as if I was invisible there tonight, as I was pretty thirsty, but well,  we only got refills twice over the hour we were there.    Our waitress did a great job and was probably swamped. It's just that the other help that we tried to flag down seemed as if we didn't exist.\n\n I'll probably give them another try, but there's plenty of competition from other cuisines all over this neighborhood.  \n\nI was expecting much better, and to place this restaurant into our normal \"rotation\" of places to eat.

By way of background, Pacific Catch used to be somewhere that we enjoyed going from time to time -- twice a month or so. Suffice it to say that none of my friends will ever be back.  I don't really want to go into detail about the experience, because it was really weird, and I'm still kind of angry about it, but the hostesses -- especially a girl named Anastasia -- were bizarrely rude.  We waited at the bar for 15 minutes past the time of our reservation, and when we went up to inquire whether we would be seated within the next 15 minutes or so, this girl Anastasia literally stormed off like a five-year-old. I then had to reassure the other hostess that we really weren't mad at them, we just really needed to know, so that we could make plans.   I don't really know what possibly could have triggered the kind of genuinely odd behavior we encountered, but it was enough to make me feel like something really bad is going on there.  It was like dealing with a bunch of angry teenagers.  And then they kept asking us to move at the bar, after we bought drinks.  It was a huge mistake to go here -- I don't need to pay that kind of money to reassure people who are doing a terrible job that I'm not mad that they are.  \n\nChurlish people, mediocre food. Avoid.

The main dining area seems to have like 3 areas. The center of the floor is split between tables and booths. I generally don't like booths, or is the designer term banquette? Whatever it is I don't care much for them as you have to scoot in and out of it and that's not a feat that can be accomplished by many with much grace. There is an area that is off to the side, on 9th Avenue that is just tables, I believe. There is also a bar area that looks nice and you can be seated there too. And there is also seating right in front of the open kitchen but I would advise against that unless you're that desparate because it's also where the pick up area is. So the wait staff is constantly marching back and forth or just waiting right there.\n\nHave been in for lunch and for dinner. The lunch service was good, it wasn't too crowded or anything. Had a fantastic ahi sandwich that came with sweet potato fries.\n\nThe dinner service was not great. Place was packed. Very glad I had a reservation. I'll give them a little leeway because any place that has been open for under a couple months (heck even 6 months) is going to need to work out it's pacing/service issues. We ordered dessert and it took them 20 minutes to bring out mochi ice cream that was pretty much coming out of a freezer. And that was after the waiter asked if we had gotten it yet. I'll still go here but more so for lunch than dinner.\n\n**4.29.08 came back for dinner and the service is much, much better. Had the escolar (fish) and that was yummy. What was also on the plate was pineapple fried rice and grilled baby bok choy. Eh. The baby bok choy needed seasoning stat. Salt, pepper, something. I can see how the pineapple fried rice can appeal to some people. I am not one of those people. Maybe if the pineapple chunks were not so huge.

Then me and my friend realized Pacific Catch was a Japanese-Mexican fusion restaurant, but we decided to give it a try anyways since we were drooling over the food on the table next to us. \n\nWe started off with the Spicy Cabo Calamari, which was really soft in texture, definitely not crispy because the breaded exterior would fall off whenever we tried to pick at one; not spicy at all, it lacked much taste until i doused the heck out of it with the dipping sauce. Then we also figured out they also added a few other concocsions that should have just been left outta the fryer.....like the fried lemon I accidently ate.....twice. \n\nMy friend ordered the Mixed Catch Basket. There wasn't anything special about this, except the fact that her side of Sweet Potato Fries were YUMMY!!\n\nI ordered the Ahi Tuna Wasabi Bowl, topped with (of course) ahi tuna, wakame salad, avocado, ginger and cucumber. The sushi rice was flavored with a wasabi sauce, which was somewhat mild, but SO GOOD!! It's basically like sushi, but bigger and broken down into all its components. \n\nWe also ordered two drinks, a Mai Tai & forgot the name of the other one, but both were pretty strong!! I like!

Considering it was a Friday, there was a 30 min. wait for the tables inside, so we decided to dine outside, which turned out really nice...although it was butt-freezing cold at first. Thank god they had the protective sheet to block off most of the wind. \n\nTried the Ahi Poke Wasabi bowl this time and it was delicious! Although I did like my Ahi Tuna from my last dining here, I would recommend the Ahi Poke over that. My Lemon Grass Mojito was refreshing as well.

Both the tuna & the crab were incredibly salty. I also ordered a lemongrass mojito, it was not an easy drink so I switched to my friend's papaya cooler. Not great but okay. Service was okay. The mochi fondue was a little bit different than we envisioned. We thought there will actually be a \"fondue\" instead of just a container of hot fudge that we dip the mochi in. I guess it's a more economical version of fondue... The hot fudge was warm by the time it got to our table, it was a little bit hard to dip.\n\nI am surprised to see so many great reviews on yelp, we must've gotten the b team that day.

For me, it was delicious, but really heavy like all other fried food (don't ask me why I was expecting fried food to be light). The sweet potato fries were awesome. I threw some hot sauce on the oysters as well to give it a kick.\n\nThe group also had various appetizers ordered in the beginning that included edamame, poke, and the basket of fries. All tasty.\n\nThe executive chef came out and visited with us for a moment to check on our experience, as well as how we liked the food.

Heck, my wife and kids even eat there enthusiastically.\n\nWe have been long time customers at Chestnut location and were thrilled when 9th avenue opened.  Why?  Bigger menu (try the crab salad with yellowtail appetizer, yum to the vietnamese beef sandwich, crispy calamari, grrr!), nice, warm space and drink-worthy bar (tasty strong drinks).\n\nHighly recommended.

The atmosphere wasn't too bad. There were people of all ages there and even a few crying babies.\n\nWe started with the crispy oysters and they were great. I'm not a fan of them but I enjoyed. You also can't go wrong with deep frying stuff.\n\nAfter the oysters we had the shrimp teriyaki bowl and the 3 pieces of the fresh catch of the day with the sweet potato fries.\n\nThe teriyaki bowl was horrible. Who drenches sauce all over the rice? It was so SWEET!  The Pineapple fried rice was not even fried like it said on the menu. The sweet sauce ruined it. The veggies were okay though. The bok choy and mushrooms were nice. This was basically wet rice with sauce and a bunch of veggies and grilled shrimp. I could have made a better bowl at home.\n\nThe fish and chips were fine because you cannot seriously mess up on fried foods.  The pieces of fish were decent sized, but for around $15 I expected more. The sweet potato fries were the highlight.\n\nOh wait, let me talk about service. It was non-existant. Johanna our server was nowhere to be seen. We had to tell the hostess that we were ready to order. After ordering our food, she did not acknowledge us at all until we asked for the check. She didn't even bring out the food. What was she doing???? No refills on water, no how are you guys doing, and no eye contact. Worst server ever.\n\nThis place is a nice date place, but you can get better food elsewhere. It seems to me that something is wrong with the fusion. The food tasted like it was made by someone who thinks they know Asian food but really doesnt. I guess thats where the \"fusion\" comes in. I won't get over how they drench teriyaki sauce all over rice. Eww.", "author": "SF N."}

The teriyaki bowl had a little too much teriyaki sauce mixed into the bowl. However, the steak that I got with it was very good - the rest of the bowl was just too much; too much sweet-taste. The poke wasabi bowl was very tasty. The fish was done just right. But, it was just too much of the same thing with the same flavor. It was slightly on the salty side (wasabi + soy sauce was mixed into the rice). The fried yam fries were cooked well and reminded me of my southern roots. \n\nOverall, not bad, (~mid $30ish for 2 people) with reasonable portions. However, the food is flavorful and good for the first 1/3 of the meal and then it's simply too much of the (very) sweet or salty flavor.

I've had fun happy hour times with some friends and even quick one drink hang outs. I had not eaten here in over a year and was excited when the opportunity came to indulge in a yummy lunch. After Bay to Breakers, my friends went to Gordos (YUM) and I chose to order take out from Pacific Catch. I requested the seared ahi rice bowl.  Excited to chow down, I ran to Gordos and proceeded to stuff my face. However, one thing felt wrong. The fish did not taste the same. Again, here is another place that overloads on the sodium to masque the taste of their food. Not only was the fish too salty, but there was something fishy about the fish. After a while, I decided to cease my \"chow down\" and wrapped the food back into the bag. There is a huge problem if I order food and do not devour the entire thing. This means I either am not hungry or the food does not taste good. Thinking that I must not have been hungry, I decided to eat the bowl later that day. From the moment I went to my bfs house to later that afternoon, my stomach was hurting. I assumed it was due to the hangover from B2B, but it did not make sense. I went to go finish the bowl and figured out my stomach was hurting from the food. Pretty sad. The bowls used to be enjoyable.\n\nWhat I have eaten here: \nBaja Shrimp Ceviche\nSweet Potato Fries (Get them!)\nCabo Calamari\nSeared Ahi Bowl\nHawaiian Poke Bowl\n\nI'll keep the rating 3/5 because this could have been the one bad experience.

I actually really like this restaurant. The place is pretty casual, but fun. A good spot to get together with a small group of friends for a reasonably priced dinner. The food was delicious, but the service was mediocre. I think our server was new to the job so I felt bad for him. . We ordered the hawaiian poke to start off but didn't end up actually getting it till a little bit after our server came out with our entrees. But better late than never because it was ooh so good. Very fresh and flavorful. After contemplating about the many enticing choices on the menu, I opted for the island tacos for my main entree. One grilled mahi mahi and one cabo shrimp with a side of sweet potato fries. Definite thumbs up! \n\nI do need to mention a strange but funny incident we had while dining here. As we were all finishing up our food, one of my friends was drinking waster out of his glass...when all of a sudden I see a big splash. At first I thought he dropped his glass of water but it turned out that the bottom of his glass broke and all the ice and water spilled out! And let me just tell you...it broke just on the bottom of the glass in almost a perfect, complete circle! How weird is that!?! Luckily he already finished his meal. We, of course, complained to our server and he was able to get his meal for free. He mentioned that it probably happened because the glass was hot when they poured in cold water.\n\nNow for dessert...always my favorite part! The four of us shared 2 different plates....the mochi fondue and the fried dulce de leche spring rolls. Both were scrumptious!

And realized the value of their outdoor puppy-friendly space, well protected by plastic on the colder days, and well-served by heat lamps.\n\nThe food is fine -- I enjoyed their crab salad over garden greens -- you're provided with a very generous portion of pure crabmeat, serverd over very lightly-dressed salad greens, served with slices of avocado and pickled ginger.  The sushi rolls are also good -- the Sake Sake and Rising Sun are as fresh well-executed as one might find at Moki's or Blowfish.  On another night we sampled their Tuna Poke again -- and overall it's a good appetizer -- the large chunks of fresh tuna are admirable, but they might benefit from a slightly smaller cut and just a tad more dressing. The fried wonton chips are plentiful and the perfect accompaniment.  Take caution when ordering their grill items -- the fish I ordered turned out to be overcooked and a smidge dry...\n\nOverall, PacCatch is a good alternative when the lines at Park Chow seem to be interminable, and you're looking for a nice outdoor space to sit with your puppy.", "author": "Claudine C."}

Well, I got my chance when I wanted Fish and Chips and this was the place my girlfriend and I decided to go to!\n\nFirst thing's first, it was awesome how they could call you when your seat is ready. It was a twenty minute wait for us, so we opt for them to call us and took a stroll along Irving for the duration of the time. \n\nAfter being seating, I was taken away from the comfortable booth seats! I could lean back a little for a more relax sitting position, but note that it works for someone my height (at about 5'10''). Either way, it's very comfortable. \n\nWe ordered a set of Mahi Mahi tacos containing two tacos with sweet potato fries, a four piece Fish and Chip set with regular fries and the Hawaiian Poke as an appetizer. \n\nThe Hawaiian Poke was a first for me. It's essentially tuna sashimi that is drowned in soy sauce and sesame seed oil. It comes with this wonton strip-like crackers that are light and crunchy, which you eat with the tuna just like chips to salsa. At first try, it's very flavorful with the soft, creamy texture of the tuna mixed with the crunchy...chip? The soy sauce and sesame seed oil work well together, but only on the top most portion of the tuna. Most of the sauce stayed at the bottom, which made the tuna at the bottom too salty. It would be better if the tuna were equally marinated instead of having a special few that literally drowned in its own sauce. Recommended dish, but eat in moderate for its sodium content.\n\nThe entrees were both great and it was pleasant of the waiting staff to separate the taco and fish for the both of us since we wanted to share. So each of us had a basket with one Mahi Mahi Taco and a basket with Fish and Chips. \n\nI love the sweet potato fries! Sweet and soft goodness in a crispy outer crust! It's definitely a good alternative to the regular potato fries, but good thing it's an option. I still prefer the ol' fashioned potato fries. Still sweet potato fries...good alternative.\n\nThe Mahi Mahi Tacos were good. The Mahi Mahi was grilled, of course, instead of the usual beer battered filet. Everything on the taco was well-balanced and the fish was light. There's a picture with a couple of tacos dressed with a generous portion of guacamole. Looks just like that, but with grilled white fish filet instead. \n\nFish and Chips are like any other Fish and Chips. The only problem I had with it was the thickness of the batter. A little too thin for me. I drizzled some lemon over the fish and the batter couldn't hold the fish together, so it became a messy basket of fish meat and batter. The good part about it: the freshness of the fish, which was Tilapia that night (I think). \n\nOverall, I thought it was a delightful experience eating at Pacific Catch. There are sushi and rolls on the menu, but I learn to have sushi elsewhere for now. The tacos and fish and chips are something to try out and there are many other options to choose from. The price is reasonable with the more expensive choice under the special catch of the day. I would come back again for another try.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

I'm talking $4 or $5 more for a given entree. I'm sure this has to do with the fact that they are in a prime spot, especially given that the Academy of Sciences is now open, and they have lots of space, but $5 more?!?! Really?!?

I'm just not crazy about the way they do business.\n\n*edit: I received a prompt response from Chamin, the marketing manager at Pacific Catch, who assured me that the price different for the dish I ordered was $2. That's probably correct, and my perceived price difference was greater than the actual difference because the Chestnut st. prices were high to begin with.

The Canvas Cafe was awesome!  It was the hip place to go to for a drink, to listen to live music and to check out artwork.  Also, there were tons of people playing chess, checkers and other card games I have never seen before.  The Canvas Cafe was a great place for all types of people with different interests to hang out and enjoy a nice evening.  Unfortunately, the Canvas Cafe has shut its doors and Pacific Catch has taken over.  Arg!\n\nHere's my review for Pacific Catch.  Pacific Catch is a trendy place to eat with an Asian Fusion menu.  The prices are reasonable, actually very reasonable.  They have a bar on the left and the main dining room is on the right.  The bathrooms are clean and the service is great.  I had their rice bowls, which was highly recommended by each waiter/waitress I had.  They were very sweet tasting and very Americanized.  I'm not sure what type of \"fusion\" they are going for.  I'm assuming American?  The food is ok, the seafood was definitely fresh and the service was good.  \n\nIn conclusion, I guess I would go here again, but I am still bitter about our loss of the Canvas Cafe.

We weren't sure what to expect because it was new, but the online menu sure looked great.\n\nThe decor is modern and clean, providing a rather trendy atmosphere.  The place wasn't crowded when we came so we didn't have to wait for a table, which is always nice.  We saw one table had ordered the Baja Shrimp Ceviche so we decided to start with that.   The presentation was really cool.  The ceviche, stuffed full of shrimp and avocado, was served in a tall martini glass with a pile of tortilla chips sprawled around the base.  The best thing about this dish was how much shrimp they gave us!  It's always annoying when you pay a premium for a shrimp entre and get 3 shrimp.  We counted each shrimp as we were going through the ceviche, they were good sized shrimp mind you, and ended up with almost 20! The chef was overly generous with the shrimp for the price we payed.\n\nFor my entre, I went with 3 tacos; 1 BBQ salmon with corn salsa and lime crema, 1 tropical grilled shrimp with mango salsa, and 1 spice-rubbed grilled mahi mahi with avocado tomatilla salsa.  Now let me first say that I am a little biased when it comes to fish tacos.  I've been a long time advocate for Wahoo's fish tacos and nothing has ever compared to their tacos.  Pacific catch however served me some really tasty fish tacos, which can definitely compete with Wahoo's.  I really appreciated the nice quality of salsas and toppings that went into the tacos.  They worked well and tasted great with the various fish and shrimp pairings.  I took down these bad boys so fast and had to restrain myself from ordering more!\n\nWe also ordered sweet potato fries which were good.  I tend to find any type of french fry that offers a spin off the traditional French fry (different potatoes, etc) very satisfying.\n\nPacific Catch is definitely a decent restaurant and we will for sure go there again.  They had other dishes, such as sushi and fancy deserts that I would also like to try.  I also noticed they had a pretty nice full bar with comfy seats and a decent happy hour.

The pictures here didn't look to good, decor wise. But to be honest, the decor was really nice. Very modern and the place was pretty spacious. \n\nThe food is moderately priced, but I somehow wound up spending $40. The group ordered two rolls of sushi and I wasn't paying attention at the time, so I didn't know what either was called. One of them was very tasty, while the other was completely bland. \n\nPersonally I ordered the Thai Coconut Shrimp. There was nothing Thai about it, and there was too much coconut. I really like coconut shrimp, if balanced correctly. It was not. It was overwhelming and I was barely able to finish it. The sweet potato fries were nothing special. They were sweet potato fries that could be made at home with no extra seasoning and taste the same. \n\nThe service was good. Our waitress was on top of everything and the food came out pretty fast considering how crowded it was. And if you plan on celebrating a birthday here, it's a $10 fee if you bring a cake and have them bring it out and sing happy birthday. (To me, for them to sing happy birthday was nice, but makes the restaurant all the more generic). \n\nThis place gets the 3 stars because of the good service, the decor, price and just below average food. My expectations weren't huge of this place, and the food matched what I thought it'd be. \nWould i come back?

Yes it was fresh, but the rice had a bit too much sauce on it for my taste. I'm not sure if this was the reason, but I was extremely thirsty after having a few bites of my entree. Even when I got home I was thirsty. My friend had the grilled mahi mahi which I tasted and thought it was good. We got the sweet potato fries as an appetizer. While they were good I've had them elsewhere so it wasn't that exciting. The sweet potato fries don't hold their temperature long so you need to enjoy them fast.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant is eco-friendly and asian themed. They used quite a bit of bamboo throughout the restaurant and use environmentally friendly products per the insert in the menu. Overall I liked the decor and the openess of the restaurant which is a result of the high ceilings. Regardless it's nice to be able to have room when you're dining. \n\nService was decent but nothing really spectacular.

It sure is gaudy and lures you with the baubles and trinkets however, fails to live up to the expectations.  It is like a beautiful yet underwhelming performer of a car.  Walking in, it is very ample in size.  The ambiance is very cozy and there is a nautical theme.  Our hostess led us to our table and accommodated us when we wanted to sit in the booth.  The back support of soft cushions beats those of hard wooden backings any day.  Our waiter was a very nice chap, a water sprite of some sort...calm and collected on the surface but a giggler I am sure underneath.  \n\nWe were given goldfish/unsalted beans to start of the night.  Never was served goldfish as a starter but I can't complain.  I love goldfish.  Alas, it was the nasty pretzel flavored ones.  I ordered the Hawaiian poke bowl while my female counterpart ordered the miso salmon.  We also ordered sweet potato fries.  This was the first time I have ever tried sweet potato fries and I became a believer.  I always thought it was for females for some reason....excuse my ignorant rationale.  It was so good that I hogged the whole basket.  The only thing I was not fond of was the wasabi sauce.  They give you this asian dipping sauce also which is the secret to King of Thai #31...wadDUUUP.  I eat my fries with 2 things...ranch or ketchup.  I grabbed the ketchup bottle, squirted a gob and was good.  While sweet potatoe fries were good, regular french fries still capture the majority of my thump thump.  My poke bowl came out and it looked very good.  They were not scrouges on the poke.  Everything was neatly proportioned...a couple slivers of avacado, wakame salad, radish, a lotta poke, etc.  When I took my first bite, I nearly grimaced.  I forgot to request no wasabe sauce.  While the taste wasn't overly strong, it was still lingering enough to make me quite sad.  My girlfriend's miso salmon was good however, nothing of the taste made it stand out as a Pacific Catch dish.  It tasted like something I could get at any Jap restaurant.  \n\nPacific Catch is very generous in portions and the price is not too bad.

That, and a ridiculous amount of food. I have been so well fed this week it's not even funny. One of my best friends took me here for dinner last night. PC was fairly busy in spite of the rain. She said I could order anything I want. (No, you didn't just say that!) I wasn't planning on stuffing my face, but surely I was in the mood for some tacos. I chose the double platter with one traditional baja and one cabo shrimp taco. Before our orders were up, we had their crispy oysters and spicy tuna roll. The oysters weren't greasy and the roll had a good kick. As for the tacos, I liked the shrimp one better than the baja. Cod (which was the daily catch featured in the baja taco) is a pretty bland fish unless you pair it with a flavorful partner. In this case, it was the tomatillo salsa. Good thing I ate that one first before the shrimp or else I probably would have been a bit disappointed. The shrimp taco was much better. Even more so with the avocado and pico de gallo. My friend and I could have ended our mission right there, but I managed to set aside some room for dessert. Normally I would skip it, but I heard some good things about the dulce de leche spring rolls. The concoction came drizzled with a generous amount of caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum! I think the filling inside of the roll was cheesecake, not sure. It tends to get pretty rich after a while. Once again, I'm stuffed.

All of the other hostesses who have taken my call are very friendly and sound more than happy to help, however, on a FEW occasions I have been greeted by one who sounds thoroughly irritated that she has to help someone. It's no better when I arrive to pick up the food as she greets me and the other diners I see arrive with NO smile as she looks pained to be there. On one occasion I found myself hanging up when she answered and mentioned her name. The waiters and bartenders are always very nice and helpful when I sit to eat.

We ordered three wasabi rice bowls (2 ahi and 1 poke) in addition to one fish+chips for sharing, and 2 bottles of Cooper's Beer from Aussie. OMG, it was a real feast! Overall experience was great. We were even impressed by the decor in the bathroom. \n\nEnuff abt the poz side. The fish on the fish+chips were fresh, but the batter was kind of soggy.

My husband and I prior to having a baby, would love to dine out and enjoyed a great meal in the neighborhood restaurants.  Now with a 16 month old toddler in tow, we still love to dine out, but have to be careful which restaurants we go to.  \n\nMost SF restaurants are too small/cramped or do not have enough healthy variety for the kids menu.  Besides a great variety of delicious and healthy seafood items for adults, I was really happy with the Kid's menu selections.  Our son has a severe dairy and egg allergy, so most restaurants only have mac and cheese or things he can't eat.  I was thrilled to see a terriyaki rice bowl with chicken and steamed brocolli for him.  I know it doesn't sound exciting, but try being a parent with a poor child with allergies and you'd be excited too!\n\nOther pluses is the size of the restaurant which translates into dining tables that are actually not smooshed so close together that you hit the other diner in the head with your butt.  Very friendly staff to parents.  Some places you feel out of place coming to with a toddler, here they help you open the front door for us with our stroller and the wait staff knew to bring out the kid's meal during appetizers so he could eat first.\n\nLoved it!

Quite good, extremely fresh fish (would be scared if it wasn't!). The dipping sauces added something special to the fish, which was fresh but not overwhelmingly tasty on its own, so I do recommend giving them a try (the Thai one especially). Sweet potato fries were fantastic, definitely the standout original of my meal. Probably the one thing that would get me coming back to Pacific Catch again!\n\nI also tried a bit of the sushi, just California Roll and Spicy Tuna. Nothing special, so I can't speak for the quality of the specialty pieces, but if I was looking for quality basics or specialties... I'd just go out for some sushi! So decent sushi but not worth the price when there are much better options within walking distance. Also had a good beer from the rotating selection but it was almost $6!\n\nSo all in all, good food. Very good choice if you want a broad selection of choices on the menu, all with very fresh fish. The place seemed pretty popular on a Friday night, very trendy and nice setting. Service wasn't fantastic: very friendly, but took a while just to get water. Busy night though.

When it comes to drinks, the Dark and Stormy is delicious and has quite a kick!   They have happy hour after 10pm with good deals off the bar menu.  Parking in the area is sometimes difficult but I'd definitely consider it worth it.", "author": "Dominique K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-12", "description": "The perfect meal for me when coming to Pacific Catch is as follows. A starter of Calamari, which is my favorite starter anywhere, meaning I get  picky and Pacific Catch makes them well. If I am with company I will usually add the Hawaiian Poke; both to share of course. Now for the main course I will almost always go for the Crispy Oysters. I can say honestly that I have tried everything on their menu and I continue going back to the Oysters. Now I am a big Oyster fan and I love how they prepare them. The fish and chips are a signature goodie and there are great things to explore on the menu. They have something for everyone. Now for dessert and I'm not joking when I say this, they have the best dessert I have ever tasted. I will go there just for their dulce de leche spring rolls, they are out of this world. They are the reason Pacific Catch goes from 4 to 5 stars for me. The service is great and they are super attentive to the customers needs. Just a great semi-casual place. Good for kids and adults alike. Just some more good eats on Ninth Ave.", "author": "Anna B."}

It's a big, comfortable-looking restaurant with a large-ish bar area facing the Park. The menu has a large selection of seafood dishes (as the restaurant name would suggest) done in a variety of fusion-ish ways. Some of these are predictable, and in my experience, not that exciting. I have had the Fish & Chips and the Fish Tacos in the past, and I wasnt very impressed by either. (Big portions... though on the flip-side, the prices are on the high side.) However, I was very impressed by some of the more unusual and interesting dishes. In particular, the different Rice Bowl options are very good. I have become addicted to the  Hawaiian Poke Rice Bowl & Brown Rice. VERY tasty, and it feels healthy, with its variety of veggies and carbs (though it probably isnt!)\n\nThe place itself feels a bit impersonal - especially, the large restaurant area. It has the feel (just a bit...) of a suburban Red Lobster or TGI Friday's. (Not anything like as cheezy -- but there's a sense of it - not a good thing in an area where there are so many other places that do have personality & character.) The bar feels a bit better - tho the quality of the wait-staff & bartenders is hit-and-miss. \n\nSo - definitely ambivalent about the place, and typically, the price-tab for a meal is a bit on the high side  - but Pacific Catch has its upsides. I remain hopeful, but unconvinced about it.", "author": "donal c."}

My boyfriend and I came on a Friday afternoon for lunch. The inside was cute, but it was freezing (not really a big deal). I ordered the grilled mahi mahi tacos and my boyfriend ordered the coconut shrimp and fish & chips. Our waitress came out with a mahi mahi sandwich, but she quickly brought it back in because I wanted the tacos. When I finally received the tacos, I took a bite, and immediately discovered that the rub on the mahi mahi was kind of yucky... Oh well... I just continued eating, but then I noticed that they left out the avocado and instead of chipotle Crema, they gave me a little drizzle of sour cream AND they never gave me a side of black beans. At this point, I was annoyed and I didn't want it anymore, so I told my boyfriend to try it. He took a couple bites and hated it. So I told her what had been left out and that I didn't like the taco, so she asked me if I wanted a side of avocado.... NO I DON'T!!! ( I didn't yell, I was nice). So she tried giving me the old mahi mahi sandwich ( oh yeah! I want an old soggy sandwich... what a smart girl!) I obviously said no. She asked me if I wanted something else, so I ordered the fried calamari. She asked if my boyfriend wanted the other taco I had left, but he din't, so she took it back with my new order. Then out came the calamari and it was okay ( you can't really mess that up). It would have been better if wasn't swimming in oil, though! EW! \n\nAfter we had finished eating, she came over with the check and didn't say a word..... she had the nerve to charge me for half of my other meal when it didn't even come to me complete!! Instead of complaining, we figured her tip could cover the sneaky little half charge she added on to our check.\n\nAll was not bad...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-21", "description": "Alas, the much-anticipated Pacific Catch has finally reached the Inner Sunset!  Though The Canvas served up delicious lemon bars and ambiance conducive for a late afternoon catch-up with a close friend, Pacific Catch seems to round off the 9th Ave area perfectly by joining the ranks of cheap eats like Park Chow, Hotei and Pluto's.\n\nDesiring for a guilt-free meal at times, my husband and I used to trek to the Chestnut location to treat ourselves to their ahi-tuna or hawaiian poke salads.  Now, ask anyone close to me, and they will affirm that my palette is adamantly of the anti-salad mode, but Pacific Catch's hawaiian poke salad has converted me.  The salads are HUGE, comprised of a generous helping of rare hawaiian poke atop a bed of mixed greens garnished generously with slices of avocado, a handful of baby tomatoes, a healthy sprig of daikon sprouts, shredded carrots in a joyous, unassuming soy-wasabi vinaigrette.\n\nIf you're doubtful that the salad won't quench your appetite, order a side order of their sweet potato fries to push you just over the edge.  These crispy, subtly sweet fries score big on their own, but what knocks them out of the ballpark for me is the sweet chili dipping sauce.  For those who enjoy variety (as my hubby and I do!), they also have a wasabi-aioli dipping sauce too.\n\nJust when we thought Pacific Catch couldn't impress us anymore, today we tried their fried dulce de leche 'spring rolls' for a sweet finish to our already yummy meal.  W-O-W!!  That's all I have to say.  It was a sweet perfection of texture and flavor that honestly, you won't comprehend unless you experience it yourself.  The warmth of the deep fried outside and the contrast with the vanilla ice cream that it's served with is an absolute wonder in the mouth.  And that's not even taking note of the dulce de leche and mascarpone in the middle of the deep fried bliss.  \n\nDon't miss out on this place!  It offers a ton of variety so you're never bored and there's always something new to tempt your tastebuds.", "author": "Jana H."}

I love how they have similar fish/flavor combinations available in different forms depending on if you are in the mood for a salad, a sandwich, or a 'bowl'. The \"Wasabi Ahi\" sandwich or salad are my usual faves.\n\nThe daily specials are really nice too.  Ask about the different \"side styles\" since they will let you change the \"style\" if you'd prefer something different.  Periodically, they have a special \"regional\" 3 course menu.

Took another 10 minutes for our drinks, which were very good.  Dinner order 20 minutes.  The food was delivered by the food runner who was excellent, sorry did not get his name.  The food was ok but not outstanding.  The waitress never checked to see how we were doing or ask if we needed another drink.  Had to order from the food runner.  Did not see the waitres again till she brought the check after the runner cleared the table, she did not even offer dessert.

They are a bit addicting, I think they are perfect as is, but my fiance likes to add salt to them but then again he adds salt to everything and takes blood pressure meds............the sushi is good and consistent, and the menu is extensive enough where if you have any seafood fan they most likely will find something they will like here. Most of the food is healthy, but if you want something fried there are plenty of options for that also. My personal favorite for years and years was the Hawaiian poke yet here I find it to be really salty every time I order even though I keep order it again and again thinking the last time was hopefully a fluke. It wasn't. My other let down was possibly the pineapple fried rice, which I usually tend to think, there is no way to mess up, which they diddn't, but they also didn't do anything with to make me even want to finish eating it! Let down! If it sounds like I am complaining I don't mean to because I usually do like what I order here, just the last two times the fried rice and poke have been letting me down.

The space may not be for everyone, because it is large.

I have eaten here more often than just about anywhere else (except maybe my favorite taqueria). I have tried a lot of the items, and every single thing, every single time, has been delicious. The fish is always fresh, the menu has lots of variety, from Asian style to Asian twists on Mexican. Their fried calamari and coconut shrimp skewers are the best anywhere! Amazing fish tacos, superb salmon entree, the absolute best rice plates.\n\nAnd I love the decor, especially the creative use of resin panels (made by 3-Form - check out the bathroom stalls. Brilliant to use two panels back to back instead of the boring formica you see everywhere else). But the best is looking at the bar, from the restaurant, at night. The way the blue pendant lights glow through 3-Form ring panels is a really nice effect. \n\nI have turned lots and lots of my friends onto this place and everyone agrees that it is great.

Mixed Catch Basket came with 2 pieces of fish, 4 coconut shrimp, and 3 oyster. My sister and I agreed the oysters were the best. Breaded on the outside and when you bite into, it's soft, not quite slimy, and very good!! We could have done without the so-so fish, and the coconut shrimp)\nLast but not least, we also had:\n-today's special appetizer - seafood in sauce(i love sauce) with a piece of very crispy bread that was grilled and tasted excellent dipped in the seafoody sauce, and it was topped with some spicy mustard that gave some surprising zing)\n\nOur family also shared:\n-Hawaiian Poke (very good. many pieces of poke with little chips to eat with it, though the poke was a little salty)\n-Baja Shrimp Ceviche (this was great. tortilla chips with the sour sauce tasted good. and there were many large shrimp we kept discovering beneath the sauce too)\n\nOther family members had:\n-Pineapple fried rice - apparently not very good\n-Shrimp taco - tasted ok\n-sweet tea - basically just sweetened tea\n-spicy fries - not too special\n-shrimp tempura roll - nothing special. the tempura just didn't do much for me\n\nAND, because my family had 3 birthdays, they comped 3 desserts for us! We got two Mochi Fondues, that come with the ice cream mochis in chocolate, vanilla, and coffee flavors to be dipped in warm chocolate sauce. I had the vanilla and that tasted pretty good. We also had the Macadamia Nut Brownie Sundae. I had a bite, and it was good, but just too sweet for my taste.\n\nAlso, the service was interesting. They kept collecting our chopsticks, and once even collected plates they gave my sister and I to use to share our food. We hadn't even used our chopsticks (2nd set) and plates yet! So our food came, and we're like...where are our plates AND our chopsticks! So I was onto my 3rd pair of chopsticks. After that, every time they came by, I held onto my chopsticks.

They're doing a preview lunch today and tomorrow before hopefully opening on Tuesday (as per inspectors approving them).  They did an amazing job with all the space of the old Canvas Cafe which I frequented weekly.  The red really pops and the decor is great.  There's a full bar and PLENTY of seats all around.  The vibe is really good and the food is well...it's Pacific Catch!  I love the one in the Marina and frequented it regularly for the salad bowl with Ahi Tuna Poke and sweet potato fries.  I tried something new today and we split a coconut shrimp appetizer which was really good.  I had fish tacos this time around which were all pretty decent but the sweet potato fries were a bit tasteless.  The ones at the Marina location have also changed from how delicious they used to be.  Not sure if they're using different sweet potatoes but they're definitely brighter orange and less sweet than they used to be.  Anyway, there was a bit of a glitch in the computer so our order took a while, but this was all a trial run, so I'm sure it'll be worked out by opening time.  \n\nThey have an expanded menu at this location (same as Corta Madera) with sushi and sashimi bar.  The prices are slightly higher than the Chestnut location though.  This place is awesome and I highly recommend it.  Easy parking across the street in Golden Gate Park.

Not sure what it was.  Overall this place didn't knock my socks off but I'd come again if I get a hankering for some seafood with an Asian/Pacific twist.", "author": "Karl L."}

(With it's live music night, relatively good food and nice booths/tables to park yourself with your laptop, Canvas was one of my fav spots in the Sunset.  But I remiss...) Anyway, so I'm headed to Pacific Catch because my SO is part of an acronym friends and family group (aka AF&F) and most of them are devout meat worshipers.  I mean they really, really like their meats and fish.  And don't suggest to me that fish is vegetarian.  Hello!  If it's got a face, moves and /or you keep it as a pet, it's not vegetarian.  So Pacific Catch has an upscale look and feel to the place. Nice decor, lighting and a friendly wait staff.  But the menu is not vegetarian friendly.  Lot of choices (sake salmon, calamari, thai coconut shrimp, tuna tataki etc etc...) if you like your meats and fish but not if you're vegetarian.  Most places in SF by now have a section on their menu for vegetarians. Not here. (Btw, I asked the waiter and she didn't have a suggestion off the menu for me as well)  Frustrated, I asked for peanut butter & jelly sandwich and they didn't have that. So I ended up with some starters and sides: wakame seaweed salad (kindda fishy), pineapple fried rice (kindda bland) and sweet potato fries (ok...the fries were good especially with their special dips).  Not very satisfying for $25 (w/ tips) per person bill.\n\nTip for Pacfic Catch.  Have something vegetarian. Something noodly on your menu. And if you can't do that, at least have peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Is that asking for too much?", "author": "ITesh J."}

It must have been my lucky day because they had ecsolar which is my favorite fish as a chalkboard special options, I ordered it baja bbq style. Yummy!!! I can't wait to go back.

The interior is much roomier than the marina location and the decor is trendy and comfortable. Our server was friendly and even showed me the box package of the tea that they brew when I asked what type of green tea they used as it has some fruity floral notes unlike other traditional green teas. \n\nWe started with the spicy fries, which were perfectly crispy and had a cajun spice sprinkled on top. It was served hot and the side sized order was a perfectly adequate amount to avoid overfilling on starches before our meal. My boyfriend had the fish and chips with the \"catch of the day\" which was cod. It was flaky and soft and the batter was light and airy. The sweet potato fries were crispy and tasted really good with the tar tar sauce and sweet/sour sauce that accompanied the dish. I had the seared ahi tuna salad that came with 6 pieces of perfectly cooked tuna that was still raw on the inside. Instead of the wasabi soy dressing, I opted for the miso dressing and was happy with my change as the dressing was creamy and tangy, which matched perfectly with the fish. \n\nPacific Catch is a great place to indulge in seafood and enjoy a nice night out in a trendy joint, which i must mention also has a bar area.", "author": "Florence T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-05-17", "description": "Update: 5/17/08\n\nCame here for dinner last night with a friend and my fiancee.  We ordered the sweet potato fries (of course) and one ahi poke salad and 2 ahi poke wasabi bowls.  The portions are HUGE and the food always tastes good.  When we got there, the hostess said the wait was 45 min but that she could call us right before a table was ready.  I really liked that service so we walked around and shopped a bit.  The call came sooner than we expected so we doubled back.\n\nThe food is great like everyone says but what I want to talk about is the service.  We had an awful waitress.  She didn't give us nearly enough attention.  She barely served our table.  In the beginning, we asked for water and she completely forgot about them.  We had to ask another server to bring it for us.  The waitress only took our order then another server basically brought us our food and waited on us.  She only came back to check on us once and refill water.  Afterwards, we got our bill and we were casually talking.  She dropped by twice to see if we had paid yet and it made us feel rushed.  \n\nI don't mind being rushed our nicely if the place is packed.  I'm not a jerk and I'll give up a table but there wasn't a wait at all so we had time to sit around.  I thought it was very rude to be ushered out when we weren't done talking yet.  It turned the atmosphere sour so we headed out quickly.  I knew we were being rushed when she realized we hadn't paid the bill so she asked if we wanted a dessert menu.  It sounded like we either buy something else or pay up and leave.  \n\nI understand that this is a one time deal with the waitress and hopefully we won't nearly be as unlucky next time.  But it was very disappointing from a place that I expected solid service from.  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nThis new Pacific Catch is much more spacious and a much friendlier date place than the original in the Marina.  However, I found that I was very much disappointed by several things, which are enough to deter me from coming back here.  \n\n1.  The prices are higher (possibly for the ambiance)\n2.  Menu is different from the Marina \n\nThe Marina location isn't exactly a hole in the wall cheapo place to eat but it's decently priced at least.  Here on 9th ave., everything is at least $3 more.  They were also missing my favorite sandwiches here as well.  Lastly, we ordered a basket full of fries and were heartily disappointed that it wasn't a very full basket.  \n\nVerdict:  Overpriced.  I'll make the longer drive out to the Marina location.", "author": "Scott L."}

The food, indeed is good. Their Tuna Bowl and Tuna sandwich is delicious. Of course, their sweet potato fries are the best fries around. Now the bad. Their service. Our server, Rochelle, ruined our image and experience of this place. Not only did she hardly check up on us, near the end of the meal, when our drink glass were completely empty we tried in vain for over 10 minutes to get her to bring us a refill. It was not a very busy day nor did they seem short staff. What made it worse was that she made eye contact with myself and my friend MULTIPLE times from a far, acknowledged us and still did not come over.  As far as I could tell, she was only putting away napkins or putting straws away from the counter. Finally, my friend raised his hand like a child in a classroom for over 2 minutes before she finally came over. \nI hope this is a rare occurrence and we just got unlucky.

A plus was that they take reservations. \n From the start service was great. We were greeted and seated immediately. The restaurant was full, but service was prompt and plesant. There was much to read on the menu and our wait person was always patient and her  return timing to check if we were ready was perfect. Our waitress gave us good suggestions, The ceviche sampler was tasty! Two in our party  tried the best selling Asian Wasabi Bowl topped with different proteins, I had the Corvina Peruvian and it was delicious. We were all happy with our selections.\nTwo minor drawbacks: The margaritas are a bit pricey at $9.00 and they only have 2 flavors of ice cream for dessert (vanilla and a cappucino crunch, though maybe a coconut or Mango would fit the taste theme better?), no other dessert options.\nWe ate half our entrees got them boxed and then walked over to Tart to Tart fon Irving for dessert.

Their best is definitely the shrimp tacos. However a good El Tonayense taco truck can totally wip that. Okay server was slow but it was a Friday. A bit pricey for what it is.

The cuisine is a fusion of fresh, citrus flavors + great seafood. I honestly feel refreshed when I leave this place. The flavors follow that of the countries bordering the pacific rim, which allows for great fusion cuisine. You'll find anything from South American to Asian flavors. However the genius behind the menu is their ability to put a trendy, modern, city-like, lunch style spin on seafood. And that's just the food...the ambience definitely matches its location very well. It's relatively upbeat, and the decor is pieced together in such a funky yet unique and semi-elegant way. I love love love any dish with hawaiin poke, especially their japanese wasabi bowl.

After months of walking by Pacific Catch on the way to other restaurants on Irving, my friend had a hankering for fish and chips so off we went. I ordered the crab salad wasabi bowl with brown rice and miso soup with mushrooms and asparagus. The miso soup was okay, way too much asparagus which distorted the flavor of the soup a little bit (and also too pricey for what it was). However, I  was pleasantly surprised to be graced with a decent portion of crab in the wasabi bowl. The crab salad wasn't too heavy, which I preferred. Unless one is starving, the wasabi bowl is a good choice if you're trying to get two meals out of it (and keeps pretty well in the fridge for a day).\nI'd definitely go back again, although the pretzel fishes kind of weirded me out...in a cute way I guess.\nMy friend and I were seated in a booth, so the ambiance was pretty good. However, they have some 2 person tables in awkward places that didn't look too comfortable.\nI'm only knocking the place down a star because the soup was too over priced and they charged for tea (even though it's a fushion restaurant).", "author": "T L."}

I probably eat here once a week...usually the tacos/fries, grilled special of the day (so long as it has the pineapple salsa and maui onions) or  poke salad is what I order. All are delish. The lemongrass mojito (made with Flor de Cana!) is amazing and refreshing. \n\nI would give this 5 stars, but the service is sucking big time lately. And it's not because they are jammed. It's usually because the servers are on their breaks, talking to the hostess or hanging out by the bathroom. The last few times I've had to flag down our server several times over the course of a quick meal. The Corte Madera and Marina locations are much better with the service (Jeffery in the marina is a scream) and attention.", "author": "julie b."}

At first I was thinking about a Wasabi Bowl but they had a special of Idaho Trout, served Baja style with sweet potato fries for $12.95 (the bowl is $15.95). So, I went for it and ordered a beer since I felt like I just saved $3!! The fish was great, the rub they put on it kicked up the flavor. Of course the fries were good and it came out in about 12 minutes, not bad. So, the reason I am giving four stars is that the bill came and it had the trout at $15.95! I told the waiter that my menu said $12.95 and he said \"oh you must have been given a lunch menu... sorry.\" Not, \"sorry, i'll fix the bill\" but just \"sorry\". Oh well, at least they don't charge the 3% health care thing. Pacific Catch is good at what they do. I'll be back!", "author": "Jim M."}

So when my husband craves it, as he did this weekend, I either have to give in or fndd a place like Pacific Catch that offers a varied menu of sushi and other seafood treats. When we sat down to dinner, I got sucked in to the sushi bandwagon and decided to split a few rolls with my dining companions. I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was. We  shared a rock n roll (eel - yummy!), a spicy tuna roll and a tempura salmon roll. Everything tasted really fresh and, for a non-raw-sushi-eater such as me, it was a great assortment of user-friendly rolls.

Food is good but the service can be slow at times. Sitting at the bar is your best bet because then its hard for the bartender/waiter to ignore you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-29", "description": "My husband and I went to Pacific Catch on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty full.  So we sat at the bar instead so that we didn't have to wait, which turned out great cuz the bartender was very nice and both our cocktails tasted delicious!  We ordered the Firecracker Salmon roll which was very good.  We also ordered the sturgeon fish of the day which came with an avocado sauce, grilled vegetable, and sweet potato fries.  The fries were really good.  The overall portion size for the entree was just right because it still allows room for appetizer if you want.  We are small eaters so it was just right.  Our total bill was about $60 which is not too bad given we had drinks too.  We're definitely going back and will try some of the other menus.  We recommended this place to our friend who liked it too.  The only complain they had was that everything on the menu is fish but that was fine with us.\n\n1/1/2008: This is the 2nd time I've been here and I would still give it a 4 star.  We had reservations at 7pm for 7 people and they seated us late for about 10 mins and they comped all our appetizers, without us complaining or mentioning it at all.  Now that's a restaurant that cares about their customers.  It was a pleasant surprise and treat.  The service was great throughout the meal as well.  \n\nWith 7 people, we tried alot more different dishes.  \n\nAppetizers:\n1) Shrimp ceviche - They were whole shrimp and there were lots of them.  I think they should dice up the shrimp because it was served with tortilla chips and there's no way you can get a whole shrimp on the chip.  But the taste was decent overall, nothing spectacular so I probably won't order it again\n2) Grilled artichokes - Fresh, good, seasoned properly.  Would order it again.\n3) Calamari - very good, came with fried lemon slices too which is an interesting touch.  the sauce was a little spicy.  Would recommend trying this and I would order it again.\n\nRolls\n1) CA roll - good that it was real crab meat, not some doughy fake ones.  There was too much rice which will fill you up quickly.  I prefer less rice.  Probably would not order it again just because I don't think this is not a signature dish.\n\n2) Rock 'n roll - Too much rice, couldn't find/taste the unagi (bbq eel).  Again, it tastes ok, but wouldn't order it again.\n\n3) Firecracker roll - We had this last time, loved it.  This time it was still good.  For some reason, this roll doesn't not have as much rice as the other too, which is good.  Would order it again\n\nEntrees\n1) Mahi mahi fish of the day - came with grilled veggie, sweet potato fries, mahi mahi served with tomatillo avocado sauce.  The fish had a cajun spice rub that was a bit pungent.  The sweet potato fries as always was great.  Grilled veggie - can't go wrong with this.  Don't like the spice rub so won't order it again\n\n2) Grilled shrimp teriyaki bowl - Very tasty, great teriyaki sauce.  Liked that it came with veggie and mushroom, chopped and mixed into the rice.   Would order it again\n\n3) Ono fish of the day - very good.  came with fried onion rings that were delicious.  came with pineapple fried rice which everyone loved.  the fish was grilled on banana leaf so it had a great aroma and taste.  would order it gain.\n\n4) Organic chinook fish of the day - it came with grilled artichoke and brown rice and the fish was served with a tomato sauce.  it was fresh and decently good.  i'm not a big grilled salmon fan so that's why i won't order it again. \n\n5) Grilled Korean beef (another daily special) - I don't eat beef so I can't comment, but my husband thought it was decent.  This place is called \"Pacific Catch\" so I'd stick with the fish but if you have a friend that doesn't like seafood, at least there is an option to have meat.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place and would go again.  Good atmosphere for couples or groups.  Great service.  Nice decor and clean.  Lots of cocktails, decent size wine list.\n\n2/14/08: This is visit #3.\n\nCocktail Review:\nSun Burn - average; menu says there's a tropical syrup in it which I think is what gave it a little after taste of some sort.\nSome cocktail with Gin 209, kiwi and cucumber juice - DELICIOUS!  We had to order a 2nd one.  \n\nHouse salad - Good size, very fresh greens, salad dressing was yummy, if you like a Japanese type kinda dressing w/miso; The mushrooms that were in the salad was delicious.  They're cooked in some sauce, not some uncooked mushroom.\n\nCatch of the Day Fish and Chips - The ling cod fish and chips is the freshest fish and chips we ever had.  It's lightly fried, lightly crispy and covered in a thick batter where you eat a lot of batter and not fish.  The fish was cooked to perfection and fresh and was juicy.  The sweet potato fries as usual, are always yummy!!!\n\nSalmon and mahi mahi taco: Both were good and fresh.  The salsa on each one are good.  The salmon one has a spicy kick to it so if you like spicy, try that.", "author": "Irene C."}

She tried to slip one of the shrimps off the skewer and was having a hard time cuz the breading would come right off.  The actual taste of it wasn't too impressive.  Her oysters were somewhat chewy and her fish was just ok.  Another friend ordered the special for the night which was sea bass...which they didnt have so they said they had trout instead.

And then tonight we went again for dinner (we live in the neighborhood) and I had the special - escolar!  OMG...it's by far the most delicious fish I've ever eaten - EVER!  I'm relatively speechless and ...even though I'm still full...am dreaming about when I can eat this dish again.  The fish was grilled and served with a grilled artichoke and a delicious aioli dip, and rice, and a tomato and summer squash medley.  It was supposed to come with brown rice (my favorite...and from what I hear, they make it just right), but they ran out and told me ahead of time (which was nice) and then said it would come out late but they'd substitute something else in the meantime so my family and I could eat when all the other food was ready (I chose sushi rice).  They never brought the brown rice - so I asked for it as we were leaving to take with me.  That and other slow service issues meant our service was not great.  The manager is not exactly on top of things and there's a bit of an ultra-hip attitude going on that's a bit over the top...but this fish is worth dealing with all of that just to eat it.  I'm only giving 4 stars because of the so-so service, pretentiousness, and the hit and miss menu (I've probably had 4-5 dishes now and only this last one was worth the trouble - this fish was THE BOMB!).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-06-26", "description": "Located on a fairly busy corner of 9th and Lincoln, this new restaurant replaced the art gallery, bar, restaurant thing that was here before. The d\u00e9cor was marine themed, and the place appeared clean. Being my first visit here, and sitting in one of the booths I had an impression that they may have some kind of identity confusion. I don't know if it was because the name gave me the assumption they were a California Cusine restaurant with a slant of seafood offering, or the extensive menu that included American entrees, alongside Japanese items like sushi, teriyaki, and Mexican with the tacos. The edamame they served as soon as we were seated tells me they are Japanese. Maybe it was the Hawaiin entrees, or the fact that the visible cook staff was completely Hispanic, except for the one white guy calling out orders at the pass. Mexliforniapanese Dining. Nah, doesn't have the right ring to it. \n\nWe were disappointed in the ahi tuna poke appetizer. The ahi was fresh enough, but the seasoning was monotone, and overdone. There is no evidence of poke seasoning. Just soy sauce with bits of red and green onions. I love salty foods, but even I thought this dish was too salty, and finishes flat.\n\nOur entrees were Wasabi Ahi Tuna sandwich, and the Mixed Catch Basket. The Ahi Sandwich was over-seared (see Medium Well), and missing any kind of a wasabi bite. It tasted good, with the avocado slices providing a nice buttery texture for the sandwich and a somewhat experimental addition of pink ginger slices (yes, the same ones served alongside sushi) that didn't do much. It was an okay sandwich, for what its worth. I couldn't help but think this was some deli's version of a sushi on a french roll - take a roll, replace rice and seaweed with bread. The Mixed Catch Basket was served with sweet potato fries. It was the probably the best component of the dish. You couldn't go to far off track with fried foods, and this basket was no exception.

Unfortunately I can not say the same for my most recent experience.  \n\nThis past Saturday night, 5/1/10, a group of friends and I headed here for a few late night snacks and drinks since we were in the area and knew about the late night happy hour specials.  We sat at the bar in a few small groups and although we had already had a few drinks were not really loud or rowdy (I acknowledge that we can get like this sometimes but we were pretty tame that night).  From the minute we sat down it was clear that the manager and some of the wait staff were none too thrilled that we had decided to spend money at their establishment.  For the rest of the night the manager stood at the end of the bar and was clearly talking s%*$ about us (about what I am still trying to figure out...) while pointing and casting unhappy stares our way. Our waitress didn't smile once and barely acknowledged that we were trying to order.  I guess the manager thought we were so drunk already that we wouldn't notice her standing there even though we were literally sitting 5 yards away...  At one point my BF asked if everything was ok but our waitress played the I have no idea what you are talking about look and walked away.  The worst part of the whole thing, when our waitress finally did bring us our bill, that would be the bill for just me and my BF since we were not sitting with the rest of my friends, there was already an 18% gratuity added!!! I was completely dumbfounded.  At that point I had no more energy to deal so we left without bringing it up but I woke up the next morning totally regretting that I hadn't.  \n\nOh and the food really wasn't that great.\n\nOne of the worst dining experiences I have had in SF ever.\n\nCouple tips for the staff:\n1-If you are going to talk s%&* about your clients, at least go in to the back\n2-Don't have a late night happy hour if you don't want people coming in who might have already had a few drinks", "author": "Alex S."}

I usually get a teriyaki bowl or the coconut shrimp and they are both ALWAYS exactly what I want. I'm a creature of habit, what can I say. Sitting in the bar with a mojito can be fun, or a mai-tai, which is what my husband gets. The service has been good overall, though there is one waiter that is the slowest guy in town.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-14", "description": "So I will start off by saying that on a different day I'm sure my experience would have been a lot better than it was. I went on a Saturday evening, about 5pm with a reservation of 10 people. The place is nice enough for a casual dinner or lunch with a friend or coworker but not for a quick bite. It is definitely a sit down type of restaurant. The place is pretty spacious, the booths are made to fit about 5 people per booth, unless sitting in the chair seating area. There is a full bar on the outside looking out onto Irving street. The lighting is dim and warm (very complementing to your skin :) ). As well as their paintings on the walls, very welcoming. So, after we all walked in they took about 10 minutes just to acknowledge that our group was waiting to be seated. After we were seated, we had a waiter named Neal, tall, middle-aged, white male with glasses and long-ish white hair, He was really impatient and rude. He did not give us that much time to review the menu before he kept bugging about ordering. By the second or third time of him asking, we were actually ready and he left in the middle of us telling him we were ready to order in irritation. He also made four mistakes on the bill (we had split checks) and was very sarcastic when we had to add more money (because he did not divide the cards right), and I quote, \" Wow how generous of you all, now I am blushing because you added more money\", it might not sound as bad as he said it, but it came off very rude and sarcastic. After the fourth mistake we asked for the manager to set the cards right because clearly he didn't know what he was doing. And even the manager cut my friend off in the middle of expressing our frustration with the cards and also Neal's service to us. Then, once the manager spoke to Neal he came back to us saying \" SO whats the problem now!?!\" then walking away AGAIN in the middle of our sentence shaking his head. I have NO IDEA why they were so out of it with their service but it was EXTREMELY disappointing because the FOOD WAS REALLY GOOD. I ordered the 2 taco Entree with the choice to mix and match with the other styled tacos. I ordered the Traditional Baja taco which is basically a Baja fish taco with Jalepeno sauce over it, and the Shrimp Cabo which is with crispy shrimp, a special chef sauce, pico de gallo and avocado (YUMM). The Shrimp Cabo taco was my friends favorite as well. The Entree's are about  $10-15 depending on what you get. SO all in all, the experience wasn't the best, but the food was very tasteful. I DO, want to go again, but maybe this time to a different location. If any of you do decide to try this location out for yourself STAY CLEAR of NEAL. He is a douche. And a horrible waiter. If it weren't for the service, I would give this place 5 stars or food and location. Hope this helps?", "author": "Allanah S."}

The space was HUGE *by SF standards* and had that sort of Texas Big Chain restaurant feel to it. But I was wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here.  I had the barbecue shrimp tacos and the fried mahi mahi tacos.  Both tacos were yummy, but i liked the shrimp ones best..  My tacos came with lots of sweet and salty sweet potato fries.  They were the best I've had to date (although I've only tried them 2 other times in my life).  My boyfriend at the time ordered the ahi sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I also ordered a Mai Tai in the middle of the day and it was not only sufficiently strong, but tasty as well.  Thank you helpful waitress, for assisting me in finalizing that selection.  All in all, I had a good experience, but after reading the rest of the Yelp reviews, I get the feeling that the food here can be a little hit and miss.", "author": "LaSha G."}

The place is really nice and modern looking. I made reservations through Opentable and got a seat right away.  We got there around 7 and there were still plenty of tables open. I also liked how this place has a parking lot - small, but we were able to get a space.  We ordered the calamari appetizer which was very good! - probably some of the best I've ever had.  For entrees, we got the 3 piece fish n chips and the 3 taco platter.  The fish n chips were average - seasoning was good but not as crispy as I usually like.  The tacos were tasty - we had one of each: cod, tropical shrimp, and i think mahi mahi.  Overall, all of the seafood tasted fresh.  Oh, and had the sweet potato fries - hella good!  They were nice and crispy.  Another cool thing was that they gave us pretzel Goldfish crackers and edamame as snacks before we ordered!!  The service here was also great!!  I only gave this place 3 stars since the food was pretty average but kind of pricey for what it was.  And the place could use better ventilation (the kitchen is open though, which was kind of nice).

Maybe next time (highly fucking doubtful i'll be back for a 'next time'), they'll manage to even crack a goddamn smile. Maybe it was just that my fish 'n chips (sweet potato shoe-string-like frites) wasn't as good as everyone else's food and the much-anticipated Coconut beer (for me anyway) tasted more like an oversweetened Guiness. Or it could be the fact that something that looks like it was spawned from the Marina supplanted what was once a great little hangout called the Canvas Cafe.

I'm not a sprouts eater but these were fresh and yummy and went well with all the other foods in the bowl.  And the poke was outstanding.  I wonder why I've never poke before--probably because this is the first place I've been to that has even mentioned it.  And, of course, there were desserts all around (I take cappuccino as my dessert of choice), which I'm told were incredible.  All in all, the food was excellent, staff was unintrusive but attentive, bathrooms were clean, and I think all was well worth the prices.

You actually get a decent size dish for $8.50 -- big chunks of raw tuna, probably a little TOO big.  As entrees, we ordered fish from their chalkboard specials.  I think what makes it cool was that they give you some side dishes as well which sort of fill you up.  At other places like Aqua, you get just a piece of fish for like $30.

They kept raving about the sweet potato fries and because I'm such a big fan of the \"healthy\" fries, I just had to taste it for myself.\n\nI was warned about the lack of parking, but we got lucky when we found a spot in the restaurant's small lot in the back.  I never knew how booming the area was until Friday.  The weather was just perfect, even at 9pm.  There were so many people walking around 9th Ave. and around GG park in tshirts and shorts.  Pacific Catch was the perfect place to have dinner.  I loved the restaurant - very casual, big and it just reminded me of being in Hawaii.  I made a reservation on Open Table just 3 hours before and we were seated right away.\n\nThe hostess was nice and cordial, but we didn't get much quality service after that.  I have nothing really to say, nothing good or bad.  The conversation was kept at the bare freakin minimum.\n\nMy boyfriend opted to get a bunch of appetizers for himself.  The calamari, shrimp ceviche and coconut shrimp.  He originally asked for the crispy oysters, but they ran out (so he got the shrimp instead).  We were both surprised to find whole shrimp in the ceviche.  It was a refreshing dish, but could've used a little bit more flavor.  I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ Surf and Turf.  The asparagus had to be substituted with bak choy cause they were out of that, too.  I'd hate to hear what else they ran out of, but hey, it was hot and I'm sure they were busy all day long.  The shrimp was cooked perfect.  It didn't occur to me until I saw the medium rare steak strips that the waitress hadn't asked me how I wanted it cooked.  It would've been 10x more delicious if it was prepared the way I like it (medium well).  I wasn't a big fan of the pineapple fried rice only because I don't really like pineapples.  But my bf said it was good.\n\nNow, onto the basket of sweet potato fries we ordered.  Again, my coworkers would not stop talking about them, so you can guess how excited I was to try them.  I wasn't disappointed, but I've had better.  The sweet and sour dipping sauce was a great condiment to go with the fries.  Just pour it from the store bought bottle and serve...so simple!  I believe the other sauce was wasabi something, but I couldn't really tell.  It didn't have much flavor.  I can't pinpoint exactly what I didn't like about the fries.  I mean, they were crispy, cooked fresh and tasty.  I guess my coworkers pumped it up so much that I was expecting a lot more.\n\nNonetheless, I'd go back.  I've read great things about the fish tacos and the dulce de leche dessert that I was too full to try.

The poki (ahi tuna) was on the salty side and the fish recommended by the waitress was dry.  At $17.00 which included a slightly small piece of fish, veggies and potatoes, it was not worth it.  Fried fish and chips was nothing to brag about. Then, the ahi tuna salad was drenched in salty dressing.   My friend just ate what was sitting on top of the bowl.  We mentioned it to the waitress and she was apologetic.  Allowed us to order a dessert on the house.  Coffee was on the house too because the first round of coffee that came out was cold.", "author": "Di F."}

Been here twice now and my bf is/was a regular, but after he got soaked with ice water by our waiter and had the mediocre mixed fried seafood basket he left disappointed.  It was disconcerting that the waiter didn't even bother reseating us even though the water was all over the floor around us, we decided to up and reseat ourselves.  It was also disappointing that he didn't even comp anything (he thought he'd try a joke instead) or have the manager come to see if everything was ok.  SAY NO TO THE FRIED SEAFOOD BASKET- appeared nearly burnt and seems to have been sitting under a heat lamp as the sauces had a \"dried skin\" on them.  The ahi wasabi rice bowl was good for the first few bites and just got boring, too much rice not enough other stuff.", "author": "win c."}

They have their own parking lot which helps on busy weekend days (although it only has like 8 spaces) and the feeling in the restaurant is super cool. I love how much natural light comes in.

You're going to have to circle the blocks plenty of times before finding a parking spot here. Other than that, the place is really good. The service here is alright. Sometimes when you want to ask for something, they don't give you the undivided attention that you need. Maybe they don't hear me loud enough? Idk, I think i'm pretty loud. Anyways, the food here is great. I love getting the Ahi tuna salad, it's one of my favorite dishes here to get. It comes with tuna that is lightly seared with a bed of arugala and natural greens. It comes with daikon, pickled ginger and some wakame... I believe. Either way its great and I love getting it everytime I come here. The wasabi and teriyaki bowls are also really good here. The wasabi bowls come with alot of other stuff other than your \"main\" choice of meat/veggie. The teriyaki bowls comes with pineapple fried rice, yum... with some seared bok choy to go along with it! GREAT STUFF. The sweet potatoe fries are the best stuff that ever happened to this earth after tofu soup. I cannot describe how good they are. It doesn't taste like any old regular fries, it actually has it own distinctive taste to it. It comes with an asian sweet chili sauce which is so good with the fries to give it a kick, and it also comes with a wasabi mayo that is also really good. Yum... making me hungry just talkign about this stuff! I love to come here ever so often, i'm such a fan of this place and espically theres one across from where I work makes this stuff even better.", "author": "Johnny T."}

I ordered the Rising Sun Roll and the Coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp was really good and I'd go back for them, but the rising sun was filled with to much ginger and the shrimp inside was soggy. I went with a larger group and we decided to share some fish and chips. The fish wasn't so great and a little bland. The fries were good but not the best. All in all the place wasn't my favorite and not some place I would go out of my way to go to but I'd go back.

Except  that everytime I went to dip the shrimp in their sauce the outer layer of the shrimp would fall into the sauce.  The fried calamari and the sauce it came with was really good.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and the sauce had a zing in it that you don't notice until a couple of seconds after you've tasted it.  The service was great and the employees were excellent!

Unfortunately I was disappointed and it won't be added to the neighborhood rotation.  The food was just so so -- I ordered the california crab salad and the crab didn't seem particularly plentiful or fresh, but the worst part was our server.  Didn't introduce himself, couldn't be bothered to answer a question about an item on the menu, and had an annoying tendency to walk away  as we were mid question/request.  In general seemed 'put out' to have to be bringing us food.  Not impressive.  Finally, for what it is, I think it's a bit expensive.", "author": "Sarah G."}

I thought it would be good since the place was packed and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table, but boy was I wrong. After careful deliberation, me and my husband decided on a salad for him and miso for me for the appetizers. The miso was okay and the salad was mediocre, but to there credit they also brought us pretzel goldfish, which was probably the best thing I ate there. Then for our entrees he had a fish and chips platter and I had a rock n' roll (Unagi and Avacado). I tried a bite of his fish n' chips and it was about the same as Captain D's. My rock n' roll was kinda all bad though. The roll itself was loose, and the pieces we way too big, while the pieces of unagi itself were skimpy and flavorless. To beat it all there was a short black hair ( I know it wasn't mine b/c my hair is not that color) on the plate beneath one of the sushis (Suprise!) but I didn't complain b/c our dinner was free anyway. Also the last bite of sushi I had felt like fire in my mouth, maybe they accidentally spilled something on it? But I think I just ordered the wrong thing, the lady next to me told me her plate (a salmon dish I think) was delish...so I guess it all depends on what you order here.", "author": "Brittani H."}

We walked in around 7 and even though it looked pretty full we were seated within a few minutes.  The whole placeis very open and you can see the kitchen or bar form anywhere in the restaurant which I really like.  We started out with the Cabo Calamari which was amazing. It had just the right amount of batter on it, not greasy and came with a delicous spicy aioli sauce for dipping.  They actually bring you a side of edamame and pretzels to start with which I thought would be an odd combination but its really nice together.   I ordered the mai tai which was kind of sweet but really good.  Their service was great, fast , friendly, not over bearing or neglectful, just the right amount of attention.  My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the coconut shrimp..MY shrimp was the perfect blend of sweet and crunchy and I actually used the sauce from the calamari which was delicious on the sweet shrimp.  It came with sweet potato fries which also were not greasy.  His fish and chips were delicious! The fish was perfect, not the kind that tastes fishy, but a good crisp light flavor.  Also the coleslaw was awesome.  Sometimes it can be too flavorful with too much mayo.  It was just a nice light refreshing accent to the rest of the dish.   Just everything was great, the service, atmosphere and food. i would definitely check this place out!!!!", "author": "Chelsey L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-10", "description": "For what it is, an american-asian-seafood fusion chain restaurant, I think this place is great.  The menu rarely changes but the choices are good and the prices are fairly reasonable.  The service is pretty good, usually with a nice smile and good attitude.  The bathrooms are usually clean.  The kitchen is visible from the dining room and looks clean too.  They have a microscopic parking lot but parking is often found nearby in Golden Gate Park without too much trouble (unless something is going on in the park that day) and the atmosphere is family-friendly, cheery, and open.  Not bad at all for a lunch or dinner with friends or family.  I like the chopsticks available on the table and the teryaki bowls.  My husband usually likes getting the fried fish and sweet potato fries.  The salads and sushi rolls and calamari are good too.  This is not an elegant choice but it's casual, comfortable, and consistent.  It's a relatively good value.  Also, pretty fast service.  Make a reservation or call ahead though to get seated quite a bit faster.", "author": "GG P."}
