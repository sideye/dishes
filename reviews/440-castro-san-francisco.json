I preface this because I figure most people reading it will understand. I told my friends I would be back and walked down the street and bought a couple of pizza slices. Why? Cause we've been drinking and it's the thing to do. \n\nSo I tried to walk in and he stopped me and said couldn't. I asked why? As anyone would. And he said...\"because I said so\".. oh hell no! You do not say that to anyone. He continued to say \"I said so\", so I told him he's behaving like Fox News peeps and Trump and all he needed to say was \"no outside food in the bar\" and I would have accepted that. Also, put a god damn sign outside if that's the case. \n\nI ate a slice and gave the rest to the homeless people outside and then tried to walk in..empty handed. I was told I couldn't go in. I said my friends are in there and don't have signal and just want to tell them I'm out here. Denied again. So I stood outside of the door and waited for closing for my friends to come out.\n\nI liked 440 but will never, ever  go back there (as if I could get in based on this guy) and will tell everyone I know not to go there while this guy works there.", "author": "Valentin R."}

A couple of people were in front of them and the bartender scolded at each one of them. I didn't know what the situation was and I didn't care. When it was my turn, I ordered 2 drinks, which came up to $12.50. I happened to only have $13 in my wallet so that's what I gave him. When he gave me 50 cents for change, I left them on the counter as tips. He then motioned me and said, \"Take it, don't give it to me. Do you think 50 cents is a decent tip for 2 drinks?\" In which I responded, \"with that kind of attitude, it's not even worth 1 penny\".\n\nThe sad part is that I generally do give a buck or two for tips every time I order a drink. Am I a lavish tipper? No. But am I really obligated to give you a tip for handing me a beer? It's arrogant bartenders like these who EXPECT lavish gratuity are the reasons people stop frequenting these establishments. And there are other options in the Castro.", "author": "Derek W."}

While there, a man followed me into the restroom and sexually assaulted me while I was urinating. He grabbed my penis and said it was perfect for him. He then quickly tried to kneel down and perform oral sex on me, but I was already buttoning up my pants and trying to get out of the way. He then blocked the doorway and tried to kiss me. I pushed past him and told my boyfriend what had just happened. We both agreed that it went beyond the \"look but don't touch\" behavior that the bar's decor (read: trough-style urinal and angled mirror so you can look at everyone's penis) seems to encourage, and decided to report the incident. \n\nDuring the time I was discussing the incident with my boyfriend, the man followed several other guys into the restroom. He was sitting on the bench across from the entrance, as as soon as they would go in, he would get up and run into the bathroom after them. \n\nFirst I reported the incident to the bartender, who directed me to the bouncer at the front door. I informed the bouncer what had happened, and he said he would watch the guy. I was confused by this, since I had just informed him that I had been assaulted, but they want to make sure he's really doing what I said he is? Have you seen the news lately!? \n\nAnyways, it happened again, and the bouncer seemed to have noticed, because the man was asked to leave. I don't know if I should have escalated the incident further, but I would urge the management to do a couple of things: \n\n1. Take people who report assault seriously by immediately confronting and removing the person from the situation. \n\n2. Rethink the angled mirror. I wouldn't have used this restroom but since I was the only one in there (until my assaulter walked in), I felt like it would be OK for a quick bio break. \n\nI definitely don't feel comfortable coming back here.", "author": "Dustin B."}

Prior to April 28, Id not been in this bar since 2004.  It was quaint and friendly as I remembered it with helpful bartenders.  So on Monday April 30, I went to the bar to attend their underwear event. I figured it might be a good way to liven up my last night in town.\n\n  Now please bare in mind Ive been to such events at various bars around the country and outside the country. I dont expect too much other than seeing other laid back fellas in their skivvies.  Well I thought it was a really good deal when I learned that if you stripped to your underwear youd be given a token for a free drink.  Well imagine my surprise when I was CHARGED to check my clothes.  So essentially the drink WASN'T FREE at all. It was $3.  Admittedly in San Francisco a $3 is indeed a steal, but the minor subterfuge whether intentional or not was a mildly disenchanting. Still enjoyed myself and my \"free\" drink but wish the parameters had been more clearly defined. Not only that, you couldnt use the token for call booze. Only well drinks were allowed.  \n\nIm sure Ill visit the bar again, but this time it will be with eyes wide open.", "author": "Kevin H."}

Why?  The F@#%ING NOISE LEVEL OF THE MUSIC IS SO IRRITATING THAT I WANT TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY!  I've got really great hearing (and I want to keep it that way) But whoever manages the bar (Gordy) please get this... I don't come here to LISTEN TO LOUD MUSIC, I can do that at HOME! I go there to meet men, socialize and have conversations, which is now next to impossible. \n\nI can be speaking (shouting) into someone's ear, (my lips 5-6 inches away), and they STILL CAN'T HEAR me, WTF?!?... AND trying to listen to other people,  I get really tired of saying, WHAT? I don't know why the BARTENDERS don't do something about it. I can only speak for myself (and some of my friends), who don't go there anymore, because of the noise level of the music. So, we go to the patio at the MIX, or to the EDGE or even to MOBY DICKS so I can experience what gay bars are supposed to provide, a local place to socialize and make connections with other people. I really don't care what AMAZING DJ is playing his tunes. The music in BARS are supposed to be background music, unless it is specifically a music venue.  I will stop in from time to time, but now I don't order a drink, unless I can have a conversation, if its too loud, I walk out and take my business elsewhere to a bar who understands the real purpose of being a bar in the Castro.", "author": "Michaiel B."}

Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers and some were shot while trying to help the wounded. Other protesters were injured by rubber bullets or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles.[2][3] The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and the Northern Resistance Movement.[4] The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as \"1 Para\".[5]\n\nLearn your history bears, and maybe after the sad events at a protest march in Dallas this week, you may step up and find a more sensitive name for your Sunday romp!!!!!", "author": "Michael D."}

They know what they are doing too.\n\nThe bartenders are professional and like getting people drunk, which is easy in The Castro in general as most bars pour very strong drinks.  440 does a 2 for 1 special and if you are a raging alcoholic this could be your utopia.\n\nWhat I LOVE about this bar is their attempt to keep it more old school.  Meaning, they hate cologne and love the smell of urine in the air.  But truth be told the vodka aroma masks the urine unless you are upstairs near the bathroom.\n\nThey have 2 bathrooms. I am not going to spill any tea, but both bathrooms serve dual purposes.  Like most good gay bars, the one bathroom is open trough style urinal, smelly, so dark you cannot see your hand in front of your face and CRUISY.\n\nThe 2nd bathroom is private and only one person at a time ;)\n\nKnow this; men go here. So do boys, but mostly men. This is not the dance club, which caters mostly to tourists, down the block.  This is gay men, doing what gay men have done for many years before the twink generation came to light and this is why I love 440.\n\nI can grab my drink, sit back and have men hit on me, cruise me and tell me I am still handsome, hahaha, I don't hear that much anymore and this place makes me feed my ego.

We were going from one place to another--not impressed. What caught our attention about this place was this gay boy who was complaining about a $5 cover which we found to be a bargain bc in WeHo $5 is nothing along with paying $12 for a drink. When we entered the place I was relieved to see a younger crowd dancing to good music sipping on drinks that were soo affordable--I don't think people fully appreciate. Saturday night we didn't want to repeat bars but ended back here again since we just weren't impressed by anything else. Maybe it's because I'm not from the area but this place was definitely fun and memorable. \n\nThe only one thing I wasn't cool with were the random straight guys that were lurking around trying to pick up on wasted girls.

I review it because I have many lovely boyfriends who, after getting me socially lubricated can convince me to go into a place named \"Daddy's.\" Sure, it's changing, but it's still similar from a woman's point of view.\n\nA fun place with plenty of eye candy to dazzle you with. As an avid people watcher, I was thrilled by men in their underwear and my usual course of drag quens. I must say, the shocker of the evening was my attempt to find the women's room, which there isn't one. Naturally. \n\nI may have ended the night outside, ill to the stomach, but my best friend did come to my aid with a bottle of water, and then shrilly screamed \"They're playing Gloria\" and he was off to flashdance with the crowd.

IF YOU ARE A MAN. If you are a woman you will be told quickly that this is a very bad idea because this is a gay mans bar and they will not like it if you do. \n\nSo, me being me, I took a survey. I did not find one patron who would have given a rats ass if a woman was in her underwear, and quite a few who said they couldn't believe that was the message being sent out by the staff......but, okay, whatever, the staff must know what they are talking about and I didn't want to be disrespectful (plus, I got a free pass to not have to take my clothes off in public, which, honestly, is not a bad thing at all or something I would likely do). \n\nSo, at this point I figured fair is fair. Since I was basically not allowed to participate in order to get a discount I thought the least they could do was give me the discount in good faith and for listening to their gender bias (illegal, by the way) rules. What I got when very nicely suggesting just that was a rude comment from the bartender and double charged for my drink. \n\nSo, I asked a different bartender to allow me to speak to the manager since the one who overcharged me had no intention of coming near me to fix his \"mistake\". \n\nI explained how if you are going to make exceptions to your discount policy then you should accommodate accordingly. I was very nice and really just looking for an explanation as to why I was instead charged double when inquiring about it. \n\nThe manager at this point very curtly asked what I had been drinking, threw at me half of what I had paid for my drink and said in one of the most hateful voices I have heard this year \"If you don't like what he said you can leave\". \n\nThat I did. \n\nI live in this city, and love it, because it is much more accepting of all people than anywhere else I have been. I  never thought that someone who most likely has dealt with issues of acceptance could be so unaccepting of someone else. \n\nYou mean, mean man. I tried to talk to you nicely. I was not argumentative when you told me I couldn't play with the other kids. I tried to treat you and your place with respect, and you treated me with hate in return.  Hate. Why?? \n\nI will never be back, and if I can help it neither will anyone I know in the gay community (and that constitutes a whole lot of people). Will this shut you down? Probably not, but maybe it will make enough of an impact to make you think about acceptance, just for a minute..... both receiving it and giving it. \n\nShame on you. \n\n(If circumstances were different this could have been one of my funniest reviews EVER!)", "author": "Drue C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-01", "description": "I'm of the opinion that everybody needs places to call their own. Not uniquely their own, but to have as their comfortable, enjoyable default. You need \"your\" Thai joint, \"your\" coffee place. And, when you're a shy, yet kinky gay boy, you need Daddy's. Yes, Daddy's. Calling it \"440\" instantly marks you as a tourist or n00b.\n\nThat said, Daddy's is my prototype, my Plato's \"Form\", if you will, of the ideal gay bar. Attitude is refreshingly absent (*koffkoff*Badlands*koffkoff*), you won't get molested (unless you want to be!), it doesn't smell like fetid asscrack (*koffkoff*Edge*koffkoff*), the staff is friendly, they actually know what a gimlet is, and they have Big Daddy on tap. Fortunately, I'm happily partnered, so I don't have to suffer the existential angst of drinking a Big Daddy while cruising for a big daddy.\n\nYes, you'll find everything from the stereotypical bear to the unbearable vapid twink here. But, all seem to exist in a sort of d\u00e9tente. All are friendly; you can talk to strangers without necessarily having to go home with them afterwards. But, the sexy, sexual edge is still there. The standard angled mirror above the urinal is present, and underwear night gets downright naughty after about 10 PM. And for the love of God, if you don't want to be the most popular guy there, don't bring a just-purchased riding crop into the bar. Just sayin' is all.\n\nSo in sum, Daddy's is friendly without being saccharine, sexy without being nasty, and always good for a quick cocktail or extended booze session.", "author": "Chris T."}

I was just trying to enjoy my Big Daddy (the beer) when a bear friend of mine sidled up to me, pulled off my shirt, and...well, from there I'll spare you the details, mainly because I don't remember them.  I do remember trying to put my shirt back on to order my fifth Big Daddy (again, the beer) of the night when Mr. Bear said, \"No!  Go order your drink with your shirt off, and you will be god of this bar!\"\n\nI've been to 440/Daddy's on a few occasions.  Until my most recent romp, I'd never had a truly great time here.  The place is alright.  It's a gay bar, and they have men and beer.  What I do like about it is near-total absence of cookie-cutter gays that congregate at the B.O.C. or Badlands on any given night.  Instead, it's full of cookie-cutter bear daddies--and while that's not my type, they do make for pleasant company and conversation.  For example, when I wasn't getting groped and ogled, I remember discussing which Star Trek series is best (The Next Generation) and who we would cast in a remake of Harold and Maude (the teenager from Little Miss Sunshine as Harold, and with a lot of age-makeup, Patricia Clarkson as Maude).  You just don't get this kind of conversation at the other bars around the Castro.\n\nWARNING: This is yet another one of those gay bars that has a mirror at belt-level above the trough urinal.  As I've said in the past, there is nothing more humiliating than having to bend over a urinal in order to check your hair and make-up.  \n\nFor as crowded as the bar gets on a Friday night, the bartenders are really fast and friendly.  I was expecting to wait for an eternity to get my drinks and was highly impressed at their efficiency.  This allowed me to get drunk faster.\n\nYou may be wondering how shy, modest me handled my shirt/no shirt drink ordering dilemma.  I compromised--put on only my jacket, left it open, and wore my aviator shades which I always keep handy.  I looked like a badass, and also like an escapee from some aviation-themed porn flick.  But mainly I just looked like a mess, and I fit right in.

I absolutely R-E-F-U-S-E to call this place anything other than \"Daddy's\".  \n\nSo, on to my review - loooooooves Daddy's!\n\n...And, I'm not really sure why.  There isn't a lot of seating.  The benches they do have are uncomfortable.  No dance floor.  The bathroom has one of those mirrors right above the urinal so that pervy types you wouldn't look twice at can sneak peeks of your junk.  \n\nThere are some plusses - the music is fun.  There are two bars (one upper, and one lower) so that you don't get stuck in any crazy lines.  And there is one ridiculously hawt bartender.  The drinks are also pretty decent.  And they have one of those little computer game machines that are way too much fun to play when you reach a certain level of inebriation.\n\nBut, all in all, the positives shouldn't place it much above most of the other bars in the Castro...and yet - somehow they do.  When the friends and I want to gather for a drink, Daddy's is usually one of the first places that comes up, and probably the only place we can all agree on (some hate the crowd at Badlands, some dislike the smoking at The Mix, I'm not much of a fan of Moby Dick's).  Basically everybody's got a gripe about one bar or another - except Daddys!  We all heart Daddys.\n\nOkay...probably my least informative review.  But thats mostly because I can't quite place my finger on why we all dig Daddys.  Decent music, decent drinks & computer games.  Guess it doesn't take all that much to float my boat.  \n\n...well, I guess there is that yum-o-rific bartender.", "author": "Christopher S."}

Once after the Pink Party during Pride 2008 and most recently out with friends after a birthday dinner.  Both times I have had different experiences. During Pride it was far to crowed in a good way, took forever to get a drink, but was well worth it based upon the mood and vibe of the crowd. Being a straight girl in a gay bar can be a tricky situation, you either feel loved or extremely out of place.  I totally loved it and had a fabulous time, and was extremely relieved to see that the women's rest room was upstairs and locked rather than the men's room spectacle that would have proved difficult and extremely akward for me.\n\nThe bar tenders were gorgeous and freindly and one made me the stongest tequila sunrise I have ever had....always a plus.

You'll find this bar full of every taste of the rainbow from twinks to muscle bears.  You won't find many bikers here, nor those dressed in leather, but you will still have an amazing time.\n\nThe bartenders are friendly and have wicked smiles.  Watch the youngster in the upstairs bar, he's more than likely to call you \"Mister or Sir\" regardless of your age.  Obviously he knows his place on the totem pole (just jokes kiddo).  Music at times here can be a little too Pop and best left at Badlands.\n\nOverall, if you walk into Daddy's with a go with the flow attitude, you're night will treat you well.

If you don't personally like the decor, the atmosphere, the crowd, etc, then why are you there reviewing it in the first place?  I don't personally like the Badlands, but I wouldn't give it a negative review based on my dislike of the crowd.  I suppose to a degree the bar decides the clients, but if the Badlands crowd all decided collectively that they were only going to 440 from here on out then I'd not like 440 much anymore.  I used to like the Daddy's crowd, if for no other reason than it was more accessible to me than the outfit and attitude crowd elsewhere.  I was a little unsure about the change when 440 got going, but it was a good change.  Without chasing away the old crowd (Well, other than a few who probably belong at a sex club anyway), they have given it a much more lively atmosphere without loosing the Joe Average feel that made it a favorite in the first place.  The bartenders are usually pretty friendly, though like anyone else, some of them have their moments.   If I was slinging beers to obnoxious drunks on a Friday night at 1:30, I might be a little cranky too (ok, I'd probably be more than a little).  The only reason I don't give a 5 star is that the First Faggot night smacks of an attempt to be something the bar is not.  It is as if the Badlands decided to have a Bear Night once a month.  I think it probably started off differently, but it just feels like they are trying to say 'Regular crowd :  Don't come tonight'.  Other than that I still love the place.

My only complaint about this bar would be the music. Sometimes it's ok, but it totally random most of the time, it would be a lot better if I was dj-ing there.", "author": "Thomas K."}

It's like they're trying to bring in younger guys, but it's not working except for Faggot. The music is good and not loud so it's a nice place to just hang out and drink with friends.", "author": "Michael G."}
