It's in a great location in San Francisco and there is lots of shopping nearby and things to do. We stopped here for lunch, were greeted as soon as we came in, and were provided menus. The staff were friendly and attentive. I love that all of the items had pictures next to them on the menu so you know exactly what you are ordering. The menu had a large selection of entrees to choose from. We ordered the vegetable noodle soup and the chicken pad thai. \n\nThe food came out quickly and was hot. The portion size of the meals were generous and the food was good. I also like that they have chopped nuts and thai chili's on each table in case you want to add them to your dish.", "author": "Katrina G."}

Dreadful to say the least.\n\nI ordered the pad see ew and in less than 5 minutes, it came to the table. How's that even possible...unless it was already made for someone else. When it arrived on the table, it smelled a bit too charred & burnt. And if you look at the flat rice noodles, it's all chopped up. Looks like the chef gave me all the burnt bits and ends of everybody's cooking pan or something. And the most funny thing thing was they gave me a fork on the plate but I could barely even scoop anything because the noodles were that chopped up. \n\nI also ordered the pad thai and that dish was good. That dish was piping hot...which leads me to believe the pad see ew was microwaved or something because it was lukewarm. Super unhappy with this place and wouldn't recommend.", "author": "Victor L."}

We had the papaya salad, pad see ew with seafood, and green curry with chicken. \n\nPapaya salad was alright, but honestly a little too salty, and even though we asked for spicy, it was really mild. The heaviness on the salt and fish sauce took away from the freshness you expect from a cold papaya salad. It was meh.\n\nThe pad see ew was reaaaally kind of fishy smelling. I know we asked for seafood but it was a kind of un-fresh seafood stench. I had to turn my face away to spit out a piece of squid because it tasted quite foul. I then went for the fishcake slices because usually those are just from packaged fish cakes, but even those smelled more foul than usual. I picked at it here and there constantly in the hope that it'd taste better but it just got more and more foul.\n\nFinally, green curry, ok! Quite lacking in the signature classic basil-y flavor, I think an instant sauce mix from Whole Foods or Trader Joe's would've been better (I've tried one such option and it was indeed better). Meh meh meh. Not coming back :( \n\nIn contrast, Service was alright though!", "author": "Su Lin Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-19", "description": "When it comes to Thai food, San Francisco (and the entire Bay Area has you covered). And when I saw that \"King Of Thai Noodle House\" had well over 1,000 reviews, I knew this place had been covered by a ton of Yelpers, both from the area and those who are just visiting the city. To be honest, I was somewhat skeptical that many of my Yelp friends gave this place 3-stars. That, and this was in the heart of Union Square (aka a tourist trap).\n\nLocated directly on the corner of O'Farrell St. & Powell St., \"King of Thai Noodle House\" has to be in one of (if not) the most busiest areas of San Francisco. It surrounds a ton of major retailers, food establishments, and hotels. Parking here is virtually non-existent. However, there are numerous ways to get here via-public transportation including Muni, Bart, taxi, Uber, Lyft, bicycle, or by foot.\n\nI came here on a whim with my lovely lady on a rainy Sunday afternoon in mid-April around 12:30pm. Reason being is that the brunch spot I went to prior to coming here didn't completely fill me up and I was still hungry. Fortunately with as busy as it was, we were both seated immediately. Keep in mind, this place does get packed! The inside is very no-frills so if you're expecting a fine dining Thai experience, I would recommend looking elsewhere. The entire restaurant has dark wooded pub-styled chairs as well as a back area for overflow seating. \n\nOnce seated, we were given menus and two iced waters. Since my lady was still full from eating brunch, I was the only one that ordered food here. I went with one of my favorite Thai dishes, their \"Pad-See Ew\" (which was around $11.50). This dish offers stir fried flat rice noodles with eggs, and Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce. I chose chicken as my meat of choice.\n\nAs I mentioned, this place was very busy. Surprisingly, my entree was brought out to me in just under 10 minutes. My Pad-See Ew was delivered piping hot and the portion itself was very generous. Taste wise, I was very impressed with the overall flavor. Not too sweet and not too salty. They also didn't skimp on the seasoned chicken as this meal was so huge, my lady helped me finish eating the entire plate.\n\nIts hard to give a true honest rating considering I only ate one item off their menu. But as I glanced at some of the neighboring tables as well as photos that many of my Yelp buddies posted, this food (for it being in a touristy area) was pretty decent. Service was above average, prices were very fair for this place being in Union Square, and the overall quality of the food itself met my expectations. My overall rating for \"King of Thai Noodle House\", a solid four stars.", "author": "Donovan H."}

The reason this place is getting a 3-star is purely based on how many Thai restaurants this neighborhood has. If you don't mind walking around a bit more, there are other choices available. \n\nMy go-tos are either Combination Beef Noodle Soup or Pad See Ew. My friend ordered Tom Kha Gai (Coconut/ lemongrass soup with noodles), which I tried and was pretty good. The menu has a large selection of dishes that should satisfy everyone.", "author": "Alice L."}

We were seated right away and our initial waitress was very helpful to us when we had questions in regards to their menu.\n\nHoi Jor: I liked this but it might have been the hunger talking.  Nice and crispy bean curd wrapping around a bundle of meat.  \nPad Thai: I don't know what the hell was going on but I ordered this dish before a bunch of other people came in sat down and people who recently placed their to-go orders and they still got their damn food before me!  My bf got this curry dish 15 minutes before I even got my dish.  We complained to another waitress but she didn't seemed like she cared.  She said she would check on it but I didn't see her do that.  Liar.  The dish itself wasn't great.  Barely any flavor.  Noodles were very soft and mushy.\nPad See Ewe:  This dish is the reason I didn't give this place 1 star.  Right ratio of meat and noodles.  Noodles were cooked beautifully.  Sauce was delicious and salty.  \n\nYou really do take a gamble with the services here.

The dipping sauce was likely from a bottle but added a nice sweetness.\n\nThe chicken larb had some complex flavors but a definite undertone of 'off' chicken, argh!  Only took a couple of bites.

The hostess direct me to sit at the high top table and I told hostess that I'm pregnant (My leg didn't feel well from the fall a week prior) so I asked if it's okay I sit at a regular table. There was still six tables left at that time. She gave me a very mean glance and sat me down at a table. Was planning to leave but I was craving for it for a while so I decided not to let her ruin my lunch.

I was pleasantly surprised at the hefty size of the portion but kinda unsurprised by the lack of flavor. It wasn't horrible, just not amazing. And side note, it's interesting how the peanuts come in a separate container, probably for allergy precaution.\n\nLastly, the mango sticky rice turned out to be worth the wait. Yum!!!

It was about a 7 minute walk for me to get there, I phoned my order just before I left and my food was ready when I arrived. \n\nI ordered the Thai fried rice with beef and the pad Thai. The pad Thai was really good, and it came with shrimp. The friend rice would have probably been better fresh, but it was in a closed container and by the time I got back it was a bit mushy. Then they could have been more generous with the beef... but I'm not complaining. Not the best Thai food in the world, but this place will definitely do the job when you're hungry and looking for a decent quick bite late night.", "author": "Brandon F."}

It's a decent place to try if you're in the area and craving Thai and don't have time to wait a long time. They're bigger than the nearby Thai places so they have more seating, but the food is not as good. \n\nFood:\n-Pad see ew: noodles were kind of mushy and the chicken really didn't taste like much. \n-Yellow curry: chicken was okay, the curry was mediocre. It came with a large portion of rice which is nice since a lot of places charge for rice. A small cucumber salad came on the side that added a nice crunch and something fresh to the meal. \n\nAtmosphere: overall felt like it could use a good cleaning but wasn't horrible. \n\nService: a woman stood at the front on the phone for a long time before acknowledging us. Many people made eye contact from the back of the restaurant and walked by us serving other tables workout saying a thing. Eventually we were seated and from there service was better. We ordered and didn't see the waitress again. Towards the end of the meal a few young servers came by to fill our water and bring us to-go boxes. \n\n**There's a tip guide on the bottom of the receipts. The first bill came and calculated the suggested tip off of the subtotal. The second receipt that came back with my credit card calculated the tip with the taxes and fees. It's an issue with their system, not them trying to be shady. Even so, double check that you're tipping on the correct amount.", "author": "Susan G."}

So we get our food, and there is a hair in my friends soup, gross. The food itself is decent. There are better back alley Thai places that'll charge 2/3 the price this place did with better portions and food as well. So we finish our food, and we wait for our check. We get the check and they charge us the automatic tip, since they \"served\" 6 of us. Only four of us ate, so yeah, they scammed us, nice. So we're wrapping up and seeing what to do next and they ask us to leave for other customers.

In a city like San Francisco that shuts down so early, that makes this restaurant a valuable mainstay.  So they get a star for that.\n\nHowever, they don't set out peanut sauce on the table.

Before walking into this joint, I checked out the reviews on yelp and saw there were a number of negative ones. I didn't want to let those reviews cloud my impression of the place so I remained optimistic about my experience here. When my food came, I was pleasantly surprised by the large portion of my dish. I happily dug in and realized it was seriously lacking flavor-- not to fret because I had some chili sauce on deck. \n\nSo I'm making my way through this dish because I'm ravenous, and then I take a bite of chicken. NOOO. I'm assuming most of the dishes are cooked with a huge wok and ingredients are tossed in without much regard of what was left in the wok from before. This is a mistake that could have easily been avoided, and it goes to show how little attention the chefs pay to their dishes. \n\nI really wanted to leave a positive review to balance out all of the negative ones, but sorry King of Thai, y'all did me wrong.\n\nI do want to note that the service was very fast and pleasant!

Sometimes when you're drunk you appreciate anything that's available.\n\nI have had better Thai food, but I again I think King of Thai is decent too. I like their food and service. Their food is never too salty, its always a good amount of seasoning. Though, mind you that most of their dishes are rather on the sweeter side than salty. I personally dont mind it.\n\nAnd service was quick too, they take your order and food comes about 10-15 minutes later even if the restaurant is busy.\n\nMy favorite and recommended dishes are:\n* Pinapple Fried Ride $9\n* Rad Na (fried flat noodles with thick broth) $9\n\nPrices are a considered cheap for it is located in downtown. But i think for Thai food, it is slightly more pricey than usual.\n\nSeatings are very packed! Hard to walk around the room, so i suggest you stay seated and let the waiters assist you. This location has two kitchens, one downstairs and one upstairs, so i think this is the reason why their service is so quick. \n\nWatch out for their food safety ratings, it was low the last time I went there.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Inge C."}

For nostalgia's sake, I ordered their ever popular fried chicken over fried rice. This dish includes a deep-fried boneless chicken breast over fried rice with egg, onions, and tomatoes. It served with hearty cucumber slices and a sweet and sour sauce. Lemme tell you, that fried chicken is still solid. The chicken is nice and crispy on the outside and juicy and moist on the inside. That, along the fried rice was just as good as I remembered it to be.\n\nMy sister ordered the combination beef noodle soup. The soup comes with sliced beef, meatballs, beef stew, spinach and bean sprouts. She opted for rice noodles. This dish on the other hand was rather bland. After dumping in generous spoonfuls of chili sauce, the broth was infinitely better with that extra seasoning. It was okay. Good, not great and I probably wouldn't order this again.\n\nIf you find yourself a little drunk and hankering for a good bite to eat in this part of the city, stop by King of Thai Noodle for their fried chicken fried rice dish.

Go a few blocks down and get some better Thai food. Maybe it's the items I ordered, but the last experience really left a bad taste in my mouth...pun intended! \n\nOrdered: Chicken Noodle Soup $9.95\nFor $10, you get clear chicken broth, bits of white meat chicken, noodles, and bean sprouts. Flavorless. \n\nI wasn't feeling well and didn't bother walking a few blocks to a pho place and it just wasn't what I expected. Very bland broth and chicken was over-cooked and rough.

There's several of them around town, but the food is overall pretty good. I have noticed there's a Poor Safety Score warning on the Yelp page, so it does make you a little uneasy when you're eating. However, I didn't feel sick after eating my meal so dine at your own risk!\n\nI ordered the Duck Noodle Soup which was surprisingly very tasty. Duck is one of my favorite things to order especially at Thai restaurants, and this one pretty much lived up to my standards. Also got an order of their thai tea, which was pretty basic, but be warned it's pretty caffeinated so you'll be pretty wired after drinking it.\n\nI probably won't be back until their health score goes up, but give one of the other locations a try if you're in the mood for some decent Thai food.", "author": "Jaymie S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-19", "description": "I started coming to this establishment in 2011, and since then, the quality of both their customer service and food have both went down tremendously. Last night was the worst. I came here with my coworkers because we wanted to have dinner and do our secret Santa exchange.\n\nWe are aware that we had a big party, but they don't take reservations? Luckily, one of the hostesses was willing to accommodate a large group like us, despite always being really busy. We appreciated that she seated us anyway, and waited for the last few members of our party to arrive. \n\nBefore seating us, the staff merged two tables together, and had 10 seats arranged. As we went to our table, I picked a chair located in the middle and pulled it out. As I was going to sit down, the exact same hostess yells at me and says I shouldn't steal a chair from another table, as she gestures to a table behind us that was missing a chair. \n\nHow are you going to yell at me for picking a seat that your staff prepared for us? How dare I do not properly calculate the ratio of chairs to tables that do not pertain to our party, right? \n\nAll of my coworkers ordered their food. As for myself, I was only going to get two dishes for two of our coworkers that couldn't make it because they had to close our store. I didn't want a dish for myself since I don't think their food is as good as before.\n\nWhen ordering, I requested that the pad see-ew and chicken curry be on a separate check from everyone else's joint tab, and that my two items be to-go. I thought the waitress understood, because she repeated back everything exactly. Also, please note that this isn't my first time making a request like this. I've done that before in the past quite a few times, and they've done it with no problem. They usually bring it out towards the end with the other bill.\n\nExcept this time, they brought out the two dishes I ordered for here. Since these dishes aren't intended for me, I'm not going to eat them. If they were for me, I wouldn't have a problem with the mix-up. So I told the person who brought the food that it was supposed to be to-go. They didn't apologize; they just took the dishes back to pack up. \n\nOnce the waitress brings back the to-go items, I hand her my card right away since I didn't want the food to become too cold. When she hands me my card back, I take off with food to bring to my coworkers. I found it odd that the total was $30-ish, but I took it as inflation from half a year ago. I leave with the two dishes to bring to my co-workers. \n\nWhen I return to the restaurant, the coworker sitting next to me says she never received her chicken curry, while everyone else got their plates and was almost finished.\n\nWe told one of the workers to just take her chicken curry off the tab since she never received it and she doesn't want it anymore.\n\nWhen they received the bill, I was sitting there chilling since I thought I already paid my share, so that's their task to divvy up the bill accordingly. Their bill still \nhad the chicken curry we requested to take off. \n\nThe staff insisted they already took off the chicken curry. But obviously not, right? Since there's a chicken curry still on our tab. The waitress takes the bill back to deliberate with the other workers. PLOT TWIST: IT'S MY CHICKEN CURRY? \n\nI told the waitress that I already paid for my two items. The merchant copy is still on the table, with my signature and the 15% tip I left. She insisted I ordered a chicken curry for here. I explained that I ordered two dishes to go, but they came as for here, so I had them pack it to-go and I paid for everything. Nothing else.\n\nNope. She insisted I ordered a third dish. The $33 I dropped was for two items and I still owe an extra $12, right? \n\nSo my coworkers try to intervene and tell the waitress the chicken curry is a dish that we never ordered or received. She goes back, and another staff member comes and claims the to-go bag I took off with was holding 3 items. I think I should know how much I'm carrying... \n\nSo my other coworker intervenes and reasons with the staff with this logic:\n1. If I really ordered 3 items all to-go, why would one item reflect on the tab with everyone else's, and keep two items on my to-go tab? \n2. If I intended to order 2 items and I was charged 3, why should I have to pay extra? Or pay for a dish I didn't want and they messed up by giving an extra one? \n\nIt took 20 min to get them to take off the chicken curry off our tab. They asked us for a name, number, and CA ID#, which I thought was ridiculous. They want to check surveillance to see where the miscommunication occurred. No apologies whatsoever. Horrible communication between their staff, and I'm not doing anything considerate for my coworkers anymore. They can get their own damn chicken curry and pad see ew; I'm done.\n\n(My coworker also proceeded to cross out the 15% tip I intended on leaving).", "author": "Rachel M."}

After another 10, the second one arrives. 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes....\n\nI flag down a second waitress, and ask about our food. She goes about her business for a few more minutes, and then finally goes to check. She promises the other two dishes will be out in 2 minutes. \n\n5 more minutes pass, and I finally walk up to the staging/point of sale area, and ask to speak to the manager. The first person I ask runs off with no comment. I ask a second person. The manager shows up, explains he had only been there since 6pm (it was 6:45 at this point, so I'm still confused as to how this was an excuse), and that they were very busy. I explained to him that half our table had eaten already, and the other half was still waiting. He says the food will be out soon. I go back to my table, where it turns out the manager had been by...not to check on our food or the service, but to tell us to move our bags to make way for other customers. \n\n5 more minutes, and we've had it. We go back to speak to the manager, telling him we'll pay for the dishes that came, and no more. He promises 50% off what we would have paid. For the two dishes that actually arrived, and two soft drinks we ordered, the total should've been about $25. He asks for $20. At this point, we're desperate to leave. I reach into my wallet, pull out the $15 I have in cash, and tell him this is what I've got, and he accepts. \n\nI tried my friends' food, and it wasn't even very good. One friend asked for extra spicy curry, and it came out bland as could be. \n\nI can't remember the last time I've actually walked out of a restaurant like that.

On several occasions, I've ordered a dish priced at $9-12 to only have it come out messy and lacking in quantity.

The basil chicken is the best and spicy perfection.  The fish cakes though, rubbery and not good sauce as I remember.  Something about this place has changed and not for the better.

She then told us that the table was for handicapped people only. Really? I saw no handicap sign. But okay fine, no problem. She told us to go back and wait to be seated, and she pointed to the sign on the door that says \"please wait to be seated\". We then apologized. A few mins later, she sat us at a table in the front. I looked down on my chair, and saw that there was rice on the seat. Gross. Anyway, I ordered the combination beef noodle soup with egg noodles. It was yummy and full of flavor.

They are packed for most of the days and they even get long lines outside on certain times. I introduced this place to my girlfriend and she fell in love with it. The location is really nice which is right around the block by Union Square so when you get hungry while shopping, they are right there ready to fill you up. \n\nThe food here are really good. My usual order is the Fried Chicken on Top of Fried Rice. The fried chicken isn't really that special and it tends to be overcooked (to a point it has become too hard) at times but what salvages this meal is the fried rice. Their fried rice is off the hook and it's one of the reason why my girlfriend's favorite meal is BBQ Pork Fried Rice. \n\nAnother meal that is really good here are their soups. They have a wide variety of soups and I came to like their Slice Beef Noodle Soup a lot. The broth on that noodle soup is so hearty with a good amount of spice. It's also a nice go to meal after a good night of drinking. Trust me, my girlfriend and I had tried it already and it works wonders. \n\nFrom our previous visits, we've also tried the Pad See-Ew. It is really good and sweet at the same time. The only problem was it was burnt when we ordered it the second time on a different occasion. Other than that, the meal is really good as long as they don't mess up the meal.\n\nThey have really nice desserts too. Their Fried Banana with Ice cream (of your choice) is a really good way to finish your meal. You will get 2 fried bananas and two big scoops of ice cream. You also get to choose the ice cream you would want (from coconut, green tea, thai tea, or vanilla) with your dessert. \n\nOverall, this place is a go to spot for me whenever I'm back in San Franciso and it is a must for me and my girlfriend to stop by this place whenever we are around. Just keep in mind that the meals tend to be not consistent at times and the service isn't really that consistent either (but they are good for most of the time). And also keep in mind that there will always be a lot of people, but the wait is really worth it.", "author": "Dennis M."}

It is pretty full but not crazy busy. The staff aren't rude, per se, but aren't attentive. I order a ground meat with rice dish. The food comes and the server comes by, puts the plate down, then walks away. She isn't running off to another table. She goes and sits down at the entryway. The plate in front of me has a cup of rice and very little meet. I mean the type of portion that you would put on your plate at a family gathering, where you do not want to eat something but know, if you don't take some for show, your mother will put a whole lot more on your plate. I mean, seriously, smaller than shockingly small. So nobody comes around to check on me so I start eating (I should have refused the plate)  but it is essential a flavored mush of rice. The taste was drowned out by the rice. So I stop eating because I have decided I will need to go eat lunch, again, somewhere else anyway. Finally, a server comes with a check and asks if everything is OK. I tell her that there was barely any food on the plate and that I should have refused the meal. I am not trying to be a dick but that was the truth. She walks away. She does not come back. I know I could have been difficult, refused to pay, made a scene. If I did, I may have gotten something else or more for my $18 but I cut my losses and ran. I am not that picky about food, thus the penchant to eat in the mall. When I factor in service, portion size, taste of food and price I see this if ridiculous, also I need to just walk away or send food back, if this happens again.

I was oddly craving pad see ew. We dropped in around 6 and although the restaurant was packed we had no wait. It appears they can accommodate large groups and the constant chatter throughout the floor makes it feel like you are in a bustling city center (just like union square). We ordered the seafood pad thai and beef pad see ew. The pad thai for me had the wrong noodles (more cylindrical than flat) and wasn't as sweet as I normally like. The seafood was tender although my sister was mildly disappointed with the lack of imitation crab. The beef pad see ew was great and cooked with the traditional chinese broccoli. Finally the jars of chili varieties is the deal maker for me. Every thai restaurant should have this. It was chili powder, sambal chili paste, peanuts, and pickled green chilis. I like to stick with the powder and the pickled.", "author": "Tammy T."}

My friend and I decided to come here for dinner, we first went into the restaurant one of the worker sat us by the door. Mind you last time I came here they didn't not have a table by the door. They added it and let me tell you it is a huge mistake. The area for the table was limited. We barely had enough space. Few years ago, the food was much better. Now, it just taste very bland and seemed like they just mix everything together to form a dish. The portions are smaller every visit. As for my order, I ordered pad see ew and it taste nothing like stir fry, the rice noodles were overcook that made it mushy. While I was trying to take bites of my food there were fruit flies around my table. Then took extra bites and I found a little surprise in my plate. A long coarse curly hair. How pleasant is that. It completely ruined my appetite.I admittedly called the one of the workers over (I think she was the manager) and told her that I found a piece of hair in my food. She act like she didn't understand English so I had to repeat myself again. She then offered to switch out my food for a new plate but I denied so she then offered me a 10% discount. I didn't want to cause too big of scene so I just accepted it. It was just an total unpleasant meal. I will give 0 stars if I can but too bad the lowest on Yelp is a one star.

After eating at this restaurant the first time I made it my mission to take my Thai wife there to get her impression of the food the next time I returned to SF.\n\nThis past week I traveled back to SF with my wife in tow and I was determined to fulfill my mission. We returned to King of Thai Noodle House and we were also joined by my buddy Stuart who originally turned me on to this place. We ordered Pumpkin Curry, Kao Gra Prow, Sea with Egg Noodles and Gravy and 3 sides of white rice. The food came out of the kitchen within 15 minutes. The quality and taste were GREAT as I remember. \nAs a side bar since I have travelled through Thailand with my wife and have had many different types of rice of all constancies. We felt the quality and consistency of the rice was excellent (it comes to you  on your plate in the shape of a heart) but if they gave patrons the choice of Jasmine rice it would make the dining experience totally superb! If you like Thai food I recommend this place highly.

The order was 15 minutes late, and they would not allow grubhup to add a soda to the order even though the order clearly had not left, since it didn't arrive for another half hour from the time I reached out.  Also they gave us soy sauce versus chili sauce (??).  And the pad thai came with 5 shrimp, and 3 were not de-tailed.  On the other hand, there was free rice and the soup was pretty good.  Not bad for a 2 star joint.", "author": "Cesar G."}

The place was pretty full when we walked in.  There was one table left.  I'm thinking for sure we'll get seated there and great that there will be room since we like to over order.  But NO, the lady at the front said wait here. We waited about 4-5 minutes.  Then I asked why can't we sit there?! There was nobody behind us.  She said no, it's only for 4 people.  Bullshit.  There were 3 other 4 seater tables with only 2 people sitting there.  GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY.  \nLittle did she know that I may look small but can eat a lot.  Ended up going down to the Westfield mall and spent $46 at Coriander Thai at the food court.  Dumb GREEDY lady.  You missed out on a good sale and tipper.  \nAwful awful service, won't be coming back.  The food is just barely edible here.

I was baffled by the cooks and management. I ordered the tom kha kai soup and they brought me the tom yum soup instead- I specified I wanted the one with coconut milk and you know what they did? Brought me back the same damn soup but with added coconut milk. Not only was it not good but so lazy of them.  ITS NOT THE SAME.\n\nThen, a few minutes later my friend found a hair in her pad kee mao, like- intermingled with the noodles NOT fallen on top. Believe me, we were hesitant about saying anything especially after the soup incident, but I'll just say it- it looked like a pube. So we sent it back.\n\nThe servers apologized and then actually had the audacity to tell us that none of the cooks had \"curly hair\" implying it was not their fault. I looked at the server and said, \"neither does she!\" pointing at my friend's a-symmetrical STRAIGHT bob. Seriously. Minutes passed until they came back asking what we wanted to do about it. Again, seriously? I told them that it was ok-no need to make it again and we just wouldn't pay for it. She made a =[] face then disappeared again. THEY WANTED US TO PAY FOR UNEATEN PUBE NOODLES. I left $10 for my sad soup (also uneaten) and we left. There are plenty of other Thai spots in that area, don't go here.", "author": "Jessica I."}

The service is crap to seat you and to take your order. They take forever to bring you your food and when your food shows up it's pretty much hit or miss. Unfortunately it's mostly misses these days. The chicken was over cooked and the breaking didn't even stick to the chicken. The useless manager didn't even offer a solution and charged me for something I ended up having to take to go. The food never comes in order so I can guarantee one meal will show in 5 minutes and the other in 50 minutes. There are far better places to eat at. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

This is a GREAT go-to while in the middle of shopping or running around the area. It's great because you can avoid the typical restaurant food of say Daily Grill, Cheesecake Factory and other diner type places. I feel like that food gets so old and so fast! This is obviously a quick-style Thai place.\n\nThe staff is super nice and extremely patient as tons of ppl come in looking for space. Although, it's aways super busy I feel like I've never waited more than 10n minutes - even on busy holiday wkds. It's best to go with no more than 4 ppl because it's a tiny place. There's also a bar where 1-2 ppl can sit kinda thing even more quick-style cafe. \n\nThe food is very consistent and for the price and convenience I'd say it's pretty good. Some may say standard but I'd give this an above average rating. It's also fresh and not greasy - which can be the case with Thai food when it's quick dining. I particularly like the Pad See Ew but mainly because that's my Thai guilty pleasure! I've had the spring rolls (great), Pad Thai (great), and the green curry dishes (all great). I'd say for the most part this place is satisfying.\n\nThis is my mom's favorite spot and I know it's parent friendly and very cost efficient - two ppl can easily spend under $20 and be more than full! \n\nA great go-to near the Union Square area!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-25", "description": "I really like King of Thai Noodle House.  They are all over the SF Bay Area.  I'm not sure how many there are, but this is the second one I've eaten at.  The first was at King of Thai Noodle House #2 on Clement (Inner Richmond).  It's like bringing the Thai street food/fast food concept to the U.S.  All the plates are reasonably priced ($7-9), cooked and served quickly, and taste good.  Why can't Atlanta have one of these?\n\nAs the name suggests, they offer many Thai noodle dishes.  And it's not just pad Thai here.  You can get various noodle soups and stews and even yen ta fo (Thai pink seafood noodle soup).  My sister and brother-in-law have eaten at these restaurants many times over the past 10 years and one thing they harp on is King of Thai's consistent quality.\n\nWe went to this busy Union Square location for lunch and the restaurant was packed.  This location has a small second floor.  We waited maybe 15 minutes before we could be seated.  I'd like to add that I think the hostess here may be the most beautiful Thai girl I've ever seen.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered:\nSom tam - papaya salad\nFish cakes\nLad na - wide noodles in thick sauce\nYen ta fo - seafood noodle soup\nRoast duck curry\nRoast duck noodle soup\nPineapple fried rice\n\nI'm not a big fan of som tam, but my family loves it.  It's a popular Thai appetizer that consists of shredded papaya in a spicy sauce.  It's served cold.  The fish cakes are small circular patties of fish.  Kind of like fish balls (the meat ball version of fish), except flattened into patties.  The fish cakes at King of Thai are thick and juicy and served with a fresh cucumber sauce you can pour on top.  Very good.\n\nOf the food items, my favorites were the roast duck dishes.  The roast duck noodle soup was served in a light broth and the duck was served bone-in.  The noodles were thin and the bowl overall had good light flavor.  The roast duck curry was a special menu item and was exactly how I imagined it - sweet, rich, and creamy.  It was served with a plate of rice and was very good.  The curry had various vegetables and also chunks of pineapple.  Yum.\n\nIf you happen to go into the back near the restrooms, you will see a picture of the restaurant owner, Toy, with former Thai Prime Minister Thakin Shinawatra.  Very interesting.  Toy was actually around while we were eating here, so we talked to him for a little bit and asked him about his encounter with Thaksin (the photo was taken in DC).\n\nAll the servers wear lavender uniforms.  The restaurant logo is also in lavender.  I'm not sure of the meaning behind it, but it looks good.  This location has an open kitchen where you can see their many cauldrons of soup boiling away.  Good food, good prices, and good service.  King of Thai Noodle House FTW.", "author": "Daniel B."}

Was feeling like some Tom yum while on vacation in SF so I yelped around my hotel for some good tom yum. Came here for lunch and ordered the Tom yum goong soup and added noodles to it. Boy! Was this a HUGE mistake. I generally have a strong stomach and never get food poisoning eating in my travels, road side food etc. and this bowl of soup totally managed to beat me down. If you want bad diarrhea for 5 days, coupled with stomach discomfort days after eating, this is the place for you. To note, the soup flavour wasn't fantastic (similar to Tom yum packet instant noodles). Eat at your own peril.", "author": "Wei Ling N."}

Imagine my surprise I haven't reviewed this place already.  King of Thai Noodle House is open very late and serves you lots of hot, rich food very quickly.\n\nThings That Are Awesome:\n+++Noodle soup bowls.  Choose from a vast selection of broths/toppings (I opt for duck or beef combination) and choose your own noodle style.  Perfect for a rainy day or when you are tired from a long day of shopping.\n+++Duck rice dishes.  Hard enough finding a good restaurant that serves duck in this part of town.  Duck fried rice?  Now you're just crazy.  It is very rich, though.  I only finished a whole plate once in all the times I have eaten here.\n\nThings That Are Not So Awesome:\n---Service.  Either they rush you to get your order (like 3 minutes after you get seated and read the menu) or they don't come to you fast enough.  Usually I'm too tired from my shopping day to care.\n---Humid.  Large open space kitchen.  Lots of people going in/out.  Poor ventilation.  Any combination of the three.  Sounds like a busy Asian restaurant to me.", "author": "Christine L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-10", "description": "GOOD:\n-   Opens late, until 2-3am\n-   Relatively inexpensive? Most entrees were about$10. Fried banana ice cream though, was $6.50 or so.\n\n\n\nNot sure if it's GOOD (because it might have been good drunk food?) or BAD:\n-   There were a lot of very drunk guests there = people looking like they really partied too hard. If it weren't for the intact dresses, some of them looked like they had been in fights, or... had been \"violated\"..... \n\n\n\nGreat SERVICE - NOT!\n-   One woman looked like she was passed out at the table, face down, for a while wasn't moving, and no one offered her any type of assistance, not even just asking if she was ok. Her company did not look a whole lot better. She had to eagerly flag down someone to bring water and let them order food. \n\n-   I expected to have to wait given we had such a large group. But after they said they had a table for us, they left us standing in between other tables. We couldn't see the table they were going to seat us at, and no one said or gestured for us to follow someone. And when they finally did, they didn't bring us menus. They also couldn't count. One cup of water short. We had to ask 3 people before getting the last cup. \n\n\nBAD / REALLY BAD:\n\n-   From the moment I saw the place even from outside, it looked unclean. I only went in because my large party of friends had been walking around looking for a place to grab a bite at 2am. I only drank the water because I was quite dehydrated. The menu was dirty. The tables and utensils didn't feel clean at all. Good thing there weren't enough chopsticks on our table, so they brought us all disposable ones. \n\n\n-   A number of things on the menu sounded good, but ---- the cashew chicken ($10ish) was 40% white rice, 35% cooked onion, 24.5% mushroom. Nowhere on the menu did it mention mushroom. There were a few pieces of terribly cooked meat (well at least it was cooked right?) and 3-4 pieces of cashew - no kidding!\n\n-   I ordered the pineapple fried rice with no shrimp, no cilantro. I was impressed that they correctly left out what I didn't want, given that some of their staff spoke very little English. In fact, when I asked, \"Was this supposed to have pineapple chunks or just pineapple juice?, the gal had to grab another waitress, who asked me if I wanted to order something else -  obviously completely did not understanding my question. I wondered how the waiter knew to serve the dish as pineapple fried rice when there was not one piece of pineapple in it. So they brought me a little bowl of uncooked, canned pineapple chunks. Lovely. It was also more greasy than any average fried rice. It had a puddle of orange-colored oil at the bottom. All in all, the taste of the fried rice itself probably could've earned as many as 4 stars IMO, but all the other problems combine? Um, no.\n\n-   I also woke up in the middle of the night after getting home, feeling soooooo sick and being in soooooo much pain. Not sure if it was food poison or that the greasy just made me that bloated. I thought I was ready to puke a few times, but I didn't. I'd never been that bloated before, so I don't know exactly what that was. I didn't drink last night, so we couldn't blame it on alcohol. \n\n-   Lastly, I just searched on San Francisco's Department of Public Health, http://www.sfdph.org/dph/eh/food/score/default.asp because Yelp showed this place having a \"health score\" of 84, which sounded pretty high, in which case, how the hell did they get it? But - the DPH clearly states that score is in the class of:\n    \"Multiple violations observed\"\n    \"Typically, several high-risk violations\"\n\nSo, my suspicion was confirmed. I'd recommend getting your late dinner or drunk food somewhere else.", "author": "Jenn L."}

Waited about 15 minutes for the food to arrive. The rice & vegetables tasted so fresh. Not greasy like a lot of Asian food places. I was a little skeptical about the soup at first. But after spending $13 it at least had to be tried. It actually turned out to be quite refreshing. A strong taste at first but after a few spoon full's. I was a fan.

MELTED ice water was brought out to the three of us. So we all ordered actual beverages instead. My friend and I ordered a sprite. We were given a cup of ice and the can of soda. Our ice was already melting away in the cup...Ugh. \n\nMy friends ordered a duck noodle soup and the other ordered a plate of fried rice. The duck noodle was really tasty. I liked the flavorful broth. And The fried rice was equally amazing. \n\nBut as for my pad thai...well, it was a waste of money. Pad Thai is a very popular Thai dish and so I know a lot of people, such as myself, would be very likely to order it. But I just don't feel like you get your money's worth here with that dish. I was given the choice of meat and I chose shrimp because that's the traditional way. They gave me like three shrimps...WOW. C'mon now. It's the bay area. Can we NOT be so stingy with the seafood? WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? Smh. \n\nI thought that it was nice how they have so many variety of condiments ready on each table. Except that all of ours were just about empty. Oh yes, they do take the time to refill it. By constantly crowding by us while we're eating to try and replace the jars! \n\nWhen it was time for dessert, I all of a sudden didn't mind the measly shrimp that made it in my dish. I didn't care about them buzzing around us, reaching for jars of condiments. THE FRIED BANANA ICE CREAM WAS DELICIOUS! They give you a choice of three different ice-cream: green tea, coconut, and thai tea. We got the thai tea flavored one. I didn't even know that there was such thing! It tasted incredible. The inside of the chewy crepe was a piping hot fried banana. And also on the plate of course, is a generous portion of the thai tea ice-crea, topped with whip cream and a drizzle of fudge. We grabbed a condiment jar at the table and threw some peanuts on it..

This isn't a large place, and didn't seem like somewhere that you could push the tables together. The wait staff informed us of this, and did their best to accommodate us by seating five of us first, then another five when the space opened. Before that happened, the one large table in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen opened up, and they let us sit back there, even though it was probably not meant for 8 people, and we were partially blocking one of their service doors. It was really nice of them.\n\nI ordered what I always order, yellow curry and a Thai iced tea, and I have to say that this did not disappoint. Everyone really seemed to enjoy their food, and unlike some Thai restaurants, the stuff that was supposed to be spicy actually was.\n\nThe only complaint I had was the timing that the food was brought out, which bothers some people more than others. One of my friends had ordered three different plates of food; one plate was brought out long before everyone else's, and he being the polite person he is, waited for our food. Needless to say, his food was cold by the time he started eating it. The rest of his food came with everyone else's food, but unfortunately my friend did not receive his food. \n\nWe waited so long that he was getting ready to flag down the waitress to make sure that his order hadn't been missed, when it finally showed up. I understand that these things happen sometimes though, and with such a large party along with a full restaurant it may be difficult to prepare so much food at once.", "author": "Chris A."}

At about 5:30pm, there was no wait and we were immediately seated at a table in the middle. We were served our waters right away and then they took our orders. My sister ordered the pineapple fried rice and I ordered the pumpkin chicken curry. \n\nOn a cold rainy night, the place did get kind of drafty, but it wasn't too bad. The layout is nice, especially for those who dine alone because there's a counter area they can sit at and read their paper or whatever. It's definitely a no-frills place, with all the condiments already on the table, but it's nicely kept up. It's also very purple inside. Haha.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, our orders arrived with a few minutes between my sister getting hers and mine arriving. I tried a small bite of the pineapple fried rice and it was quite tasty. It had maybe 4-5 pieces of shrimp, and was perfectly seasoned. My pumpkin chicken curry was also delicious! It definitely hit the spot. It was nice and hot, but not mouth-burning hot. A few hefty chunks of tender pumpkin and slivers of chicken breast. The curry was so good, I had to keep myself from stuffing myself silly with the rice I drowned in the scrumptious sauce. \n\nThe place did get busy as we ate and at one time, a small line formed, but they quickly got people in and out to keep up with the demand.

The ladies taking my order were very accommodating and patient as me and my coworker were looking through the menu and asking questions despite people coming in waiting to be seated.\n\nI get my food, and immediately I noticed a slightly off smell coming out of the box with the egg rolls. Usually when I order takeout, the smell wafts in my nose, and I can't wait to get home and eat. The smell wasn't very appealing. On the bart ride home, I had to put my food on the other seat, because I couldn't stand the smell. I was thinking maybe I'll change my mind when I actually eat.\n\nNow I'm here at home writing my review, after taking a few bites of the egg roll, it tasted ... old and spoiled. The fried rice I got with my roast duck tasted ... old. The roast duck itself tasted.. old. It's like they had leftovers in the fridge for a week and heated it up in the microwave. It just did not have the freshness quality you usually get at other thai restaurants. The only thing that was ok was the pad see ew noodles, but I had to drown it in siracha sauce.

But I was squeezed for time and it was where we were. We got there just after the lunch rush and were seated right away.  The place was clean and service pleasant.  \n\nThe menu was quite extensive making it hard to decide, but I decided on the Pad See - stir fried flat rice noodle with a combination meats and seafoods, egg, Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce.  When it came to the table it wasn't what I was expecting.  I thought that the look fun (flat rice noodles) was going to be stir fried together with the other ingredients.  But what I got was the stir fried ingredients on top of plain look fun.  Even though it wasn't what I expecting, it did look and smelled good, I was happy with the dish, I mixed it up, added sambal and all was fine.  My friend who had the Combination Beef Noodle soup was also happy with his food.\n\nThis place is not a destination restaurant, but for a quick, decent bite of Thai food, that's convenient and close to all the shopping, King of Thai is a good choice.", "author": "Jason C."}

Then I peer at the kitchen and it seems like no one is making food. They are closing in 10 minutes, meaning the kitchen is closing. I look over one more time and it looks like they're cleaning up the kitchen. I asked them where my food was and they seemed shocked that I had nothing to eat!

I felt like I was going to be a burden, so my boyfriend took it upon himself to let me finish the majority of his plate and he'd just eat some leftovers he saved in the car.\n\nThe pad see-ew wasn't all that great.

My girl got the pad see ew which was also standard as well. The flavors were nice. I just didn't like the fact that all the dishes were brought out one at a time. Like the cooks just made one dish, put it out then began to work on the next dish. Many people sat there looking at their food waiting for everyone to get their food. It was obvious the food already brought out would get cold with the wait we had to endure between everyone's dishes (about 6 people) so they just ate. Sort of defeats the purpose of eating together. \n\nPlace has it's flaws but the food is fine. If you are driving to downtown, not worth the hassle to come here.

It was about half empty, which was to be expected on a Tuesday night around 8pm. We got seated in the back, where we could see the whole kitchen, and right next to where the staff had their table that they took their breaks at. It was fine because we were a larger group, but not a place where I would normally like to sit. I was mostly disappointed that the dish I got was just bland and pretty unimpressive. I hadn't been there before, so I decided to go with a pretty standard fare of the chicken fried rice dish. Unfortunately all I could taste the most of was onion. I ate about half and decided not to take the rest home as leftovers. Portion size was big, and the price was very cheap, especially for the area of the city it's in. I can see this would be an awesome late-night munchies kind of place.", "author": "Jess B."}

Potato chunks in yellow curry were sour. Chicken strips in the curry were dry and tasted like boiled chicken. \n- Roasted fried rice was made of unwanted part of the roasted duck. What else can I say?\n\nPoor Service\n- There were plenty of tables on the first floor when we walked in, but we were assigned to sit at a small table adjacent to a four-people party. Why would they do that?\n- There were seven servers on the first floor, but none of them were attentive. I asked for a cup of hot water and was given a cup of cold water. They got it right the second time.", "author": "Spicy G."}

This time around, howver, it was quite the opposite  (but mostly writing a negative review based on the staff and food). At the start of the meal, everything seemed fine, they seated and took orders from me and my guest quickly and efficiently. I ordered the crab fried rice and she ordered the yellow chicken curry. But after 20 minutes, no food came by (and for relativity, it usually takes between 10-15 and the restaurant was maybe 3/4 full). Several waiters and waitresses passed by, kept looking at our table, but nobody bothered to come by and ask if everything was okay.  I asked about the status of the food once, 10 minutes later, the curry came by. I then proceeded to wait even longer, to which at that point, several more waiters and waitresses passed by without saying a single word. I asked a 2nd time about the food, and was told it was on its way. It was not until another 15 minutes later I finally got my crab fried rice. Yes, crab fried rice. Needless to say, this was the worst experience I've had at this place and will probably not come back for a while. I gave them 1 star for delivering my food, and that's the best I think they deserve this round.", "author": "Mark T."}

Prices were fair for the area and type of food. \nI am not really sure how sanitary this place is, but maybe that is the point. I saw kitchen staff eating in the food prep areas. Eating your own bowl of food while cooking mine? No thanks. \nThere were also small flies that we kept having to sweep away with our hands. That got annoying after a while. We arrived at around 7pm, so maybe because it was fairly busy, it wasn't as clean? The bathrooms could have been cleaner as well. \n\nWe had the pad thai and pineapple fried rice. Both has good portion sizes and good taste. I had to add some pepper to it to make it spicier, but that's not a problem with me. Also had thai iced tea, which I wouldn't recommend. They have a ton of glasses pre-filled with tea, and you get some fresh half and half added to your tea before they bring it out. \n\nI would order here again if I were staying in town longer, but only for takeout.

Anyways, nothing can ever top Marnee Thai, but my friend really wanted thai food at around 9:40pm and she wanted to go downtown so we had no choice. I actually never realized how big this place was. It looked SO small but it turns out it has a second floor consisting of about 8 more tables. My crew of 5 got seated immediately which was nice because boy was I hungry. \n\nPineapple fried rice: 3.5 stars. Not bad, but I've had better. It's your average fried rice plate fried in thai fish sauce with your choice of chicken, beef, or pork with pineapples, tomato, cucumber, and eggs. I personally like it with chicken and shrimp. \npad thai: 3 stars. Definitely not as good as Marnee Thai. Very average pad thai that usually is not cooked correctly, hence the rice noodles all cluttering and sitcking together. But for those who have never had this, its basically thin flat rice noodles fried in fish sauce and tamarind sauce with eggs, chicken, beef, or pork, bean sprouts, shrimp, carrots, crushed peanuts and the option of lime to squeeze on top. I personally prefer chicken and shrimp with this dish.\npad see-ew: 3 stars. The thai version of chow fun. It is basically fat flat noodles fried in dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, broccoli, egg, garlic, and your choice of meat. I usually prefer beef with this plate because I think it tastes the best with this dish. \nsweet sticky rice with mango ($5.95): 2.5 stars. Man, I wish I did my research on this dish before ordering it. I read the raving reviews on this dessert and I immediately ordered it expecting it to be uniquely delicious. HOWEVER, it is basically the Vietnamese soy I grew up eating with a couple slices of mangoes. It's soy, mango, some sauce and sesame over the soy. It was nothing special to me. I could make this at home, and it was quite pricey for such a simple dish. 6 bucks for soy and mangoes.... Oh well, not I know what it is. \n\nCustomer service was ok. They accommodated with us and allowed us to get 5 separate checks.The waitress totally called us out saying we forgot to give her one of the receipt back.... but it was just stuck to the one on top of it. But... we weren't mad because it's understandable due to the massive 5 pieces of receipts she handled. \n\nOverall, a very average thai food place. And I believe it was a bit pricier than other branches since it is downtown. Parking was difficult of course, so we parked about 8 blocks from the restaurant, but its ok, WE HAVE TO EXERCISE AFTER WE EAT! \n\nI definitely would not go back here again however due to the lack of quality on top of the added prices.", "author": "Chena N."}

Went there on a Saturday afternoon with the hubby and thought we had to wait as all the tables out front were full.  To our surprise we were seated promptly in the back.  There's a back and a second floor to the restaurant so don't let the crowd deter you from getting a bowl of noodles!\n\nWe ordered the fried spring rolls and a bowl of the vegetarian noodles.  Both dishes came out at the same time, literally 2 minutes after we ordered...talk about speedy service!  The spring rolls were served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce.  Crispy on the outside and piping hot on the inside, not bad if you have a spring roll craving but I wouldn't come back for that.  The noodles on the other hand was delish.  I didn't expect a vegetarian noodle broth to have so much flavor and depth...you can pick between egg noodles, rice noodles or vermicelli so there is a little bit of customization to each order.  We had ours with the egg noodles which went really well with the flavorful broth.\n\nService here is fast, similar to that of Vietnamese pho restaurants.   Food was decent, a nice escape from the food court at the SF shopping center.", "author": "Shirley C."}

I had to literally repeat myself 3-4 times for her to get our order right. We waited about 10-15 minutes and we still didn't get our food yet, so I reminded our waitress and she said it's coming. Another 10 minutes later we got our food.. their Pad Thai has got to be the worst I've ever tried. We wanted to order dessert and my boyfriend wanted to try their Mango Sticky Rice. She told us they didn't have any left. So we tried to order their Fried Banana Ice-cream (they only had 2 desserts to choose from), she told us that they only have fried banana, NO ICE-CREAM. So we passed on dessert.\n\nI decided to use their restroom while my boyfriend was taking care of the bill. Now we usually tip 15%-20% whenever we eat at a sit-down restaurant even if the meal wasn't all that great. We decided not to, call us cheap but their service was horrible and the food sucked big time. So I came out and my boyfriend seemed very upset, I asked him and he told me \"THEY MADE ME TIP THEM.\" So I guess the waitress said to him, \"Oh you forgot to add tip to your bill.\" He replied saying, \"I don't want to.\" She says \"You have to tip us, we need a tip.\" She pretty much demanded a tip and wouldn't leave our table until she received one.

You come to one of the Thai restaurants! King of Thai made a beautiful impression on me when I visited their North Beach location for their amazing happy hour.\n\nI was with a party of 11 starving students and we just wanted to eat ANYTHING. On a Sunday night at 8pm only few locations were open, and thankfully King of Thai was one of them. I honestly didn't expect to get seating for all of us but we got three separate tables immediately in very close proximity.\n\nThe service at the start was not impressive. Once you were ready to make your order you had to flag down the server to order or else you would be left hanging for maybe even more than 10 minutes. This is an Asian restaurant - go forth and make your voice heard.\n\nOur food came out VERY FAST. I don't think it took them more than 10 minutes to make the 5 dishes for our table. The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was pretty good. Very fragrant and flavorful rice with large chunks of Chinese sausage and BBQ pork. The BBQ pork was lacking in flavor but overall the dish did not disappoint, but could have had more meat. On the other hand, the Fried Chicken Over Fried Rice had a LOT of chicken. \nYou always have plenty of crushed peanuts and chili on the side to make up for any lack of spice or texture. \n\nWe weren't expecting it but our waitress let us split our check into 11 separate checks, which made paying so much easier.

Didn't have to wait any longer than 10 minutes for my food, which I scooped up and marched up the hill to my house eager to tuck in to my tasty duck. \n\nThere was less duck than with the normal portion and poorly cooked to boot! The weight of the box, which I gleefully hoped was my dinner style meat, was 90% semi-cooked vegetables.

I was accompanied by my mom when I came here to grab some lunch.\n\nMy mom already ate lunch earlier that day, with me being the only one having a late lunch close to 4pm. We were promptly seated upon arrival and everything seemed good until.... my order of 2 thai ice teas for both me and my mom along with a chicken thai fried rice for me. The waitress asked what my mom was ordering and I told her that I was the one eating. I ordered the 2nd thai ice tea so that they wouldn't give us any poor treatment or so I thought with these petty Thai waitstaff. \n\nI waited 10 minutes, still no thai ice teas or my thai fried rice. 5 other parties of 2's got seated after us and they ALL got their food ASAP. After seeing 5 different parties get their thai fried rice left and right, it got me thinking.....am I getting sh*tty treatment because I was the only one eating and not my mom? \n\nWhen Thai fried rice starts passing my table and the waitress who took my order was no where to be seen, that is a no bueno. I got ahold of a waitress who walked by and told her about my situation with the 1 order of thai fried rice and 2 thai ice teas and she went to go check up on it for me. \n\n2 minutes later, one of the wannabe she-man waitstaff came with my order of thai fried rice and straight drops it on the table in front of my mom and not me. I was literally about to walk out when fried rice passes me left and right but I don't get my food.\n\n1-star is for the cheap thai food and the waitress who got my order rolling. -4 stars for the ENTIRE waitstaff (excluding the girl that helped me) along with offending my mom because she didn't order a dish but just had a thai ice tea.\n\nI use to see the owner at one of the closeby KOT locations in the city close to my old workplace.

My friend and I come here on a regular basis and pretty much only get two dishes - their Fried Chicken over Fried Rice, and a curry, either red or green. Fried Chicken over Fried Rice sounds kinda boring, bland, nothing to call home about, right? Nope. Nope. Nope. I can't get enough of this stuff. When it comes to Thai food I usually prefer a saucy dish or noodle dish, but the fried rice is packed with flavor (as far as rice goes), still light, and goes great with the chicken, which is also simple but for what ever reason is wonderful. Their curries are also spectacular. \nService is friendly and fast. Not the prettiest of places, but hey, its more about the food anyway. I've never gone in and not seen a good number of people inside, which makes me happy for them. \nI only knock down a star because its not SUPER restaurant quality, so that fifth star I reserve for those kinds of joints that really do \"as good as it gets\" but if any place had to be close, it would be King of Thai.", "author": "Laurel R."}

And then we found King of Thai Noodle House. \n\nThe service was good, as I would expect it to be at 11pm when we were one of only a few tables seated. The place was large, but I wouldn't exactly say clean or too appealing... but not bad for cheap Thai.\n\nThe food was great. I got my normal Thai dish...Pad Khee Mao. My only complaint is that they were out of the large egg noodles, which is my favorite part of the dish. But they gave me a choice of substitutions and I chose the smaller egg noodles, and the dish was still delicious.\n\nThe place served up good food, prices were good, and service and cleanliness were all good (or at least sufficient). I'd definitely go back.", "author": "Krista S."}

It's a good place to grab a quick meal either for lunch, before a movie, etc. However, it wouldn't be my first choice for any meal. The prices are cheap though and it's nice that the place is open late.\n\nI've had a couple of items off the menu and they are all decent. My favorite is the pad gra praw (choice of meat stir-fried with basil). They make it with ground meat which I prefer and the sauce is well-rounded in flavors.

At the table next to us was a young, female employee cutting peppers. It really bothered me that she was doing food prep in the dining area. We shared the Pad See Ew, which was mediocre.

If you're looking for a FAST and CHEAP eat, this is the place to go. It's a couple of blocks (near H&M) from the general Union Square area, so finding this little spot was easy.\n\nFor three people, the total came out to be about $25. I had the chicken fried rice (kao pad), while my friends had pad thai and the vegetarian fried rice. Our order came out quickly and steaming hot.\n\nMy dish was just what I needed after skipping breakfast that morning. The rice was fluffy and flavorful, with a good amount of chicken in each bite. The portion sizes was just about enough for one person to finish. The pad thai was delish too, I'll definitely order that the next time I go!\n\nOne of the few faults I have with this place is that it is CASH ONLY! I mean, come on... you're in SF! in Union Square! People are shoppin' and swiping that plastic like there's no tomorrow! The service was kind of non-existent, but our food arrived fast, so it wasn't much of a big deal to us. Although our food came to us quickly, we received our dishes separately (within a 3-4 minute interval, I would say).\n\nOther than that, I would definitely come back again.

We had the seafood crispy noodle, the beef with soft noodles and gravy and Thai fried rice.  There was a sparse amount of seafood and the noodles were soggy., a Cantonese version is way better IMO.    Same with the beef noodle dish, as beef chow gun is a superior offering.   A good wok fried Cantonese style fried rice would have been more satisfying as the Thai version didn't have much meat to it.  Maybe the pad thai would have been different.

We were in this area with a friend the day before and he pointed out King of Thai and suggested we eat there if we got a chance.  It was about 2:30 or 3 pm and I was pretty surprised at how packed it was for a non-popular meal time.  Every single table was seemingly taken on the ground floor and as they asked \"are you okay with sitting upstairs\", I was thinking with my legs tired from running 26.2 miles that it wasn't going to be in the cards for us to eat here...and then a table miraculously opened up right in front of us!  Hooray.  \n\nThe service was really slow.  It took about 5 minutes just to get a menu and another 10 to place our order.  Fortunately, the food came out super fast.  We had egg rolls, lard nar (noodles with gravy) and good old fried rice.  The egg rolls were standard...nothing to brag about but nothing to complain about either.  The lard nar was delicious...loved the savory gravy sauce...yum!  The fried rice though was a big rip off at I think $11 for a mediocre and small plate of chicken fried rice.

The menu is quite possibly the most extensive I have ever seen for a Thai restaurant.  It includes noodles, soup, fried rice, and curries.  \n\nFor those Pad Thai lovers out there, this place uses a very thin noodle, so if you like the thicker noodles, you may not be pleased with the pad thai.

From across the street, we saw that this place was super crowded. We were on our quest on looking for Bangkok but we forgot which street it was on so we settled here. \n\nAs I said from across the street, we saw that it was super packed. I was like OMG this will be quite a wait but since we couldn't find any other eateries that was to our interest so we went ahead and crossed the street. To our amazement, we were seated within 3 minutes. They not only have the front for seating but the back and upstairs. \n\nAt first, my mom and I only ordered main entrees, Pad Thai for me and Thai Style Fried Rice with Seafood for mommy. But since we sat in the back, we saw they were brewing pretty dark Thai Tea. So my mom was like you should order a Thai Tea too! Best idea ever! I think I would rate them for all 3 stars just for their Thai Tea. It's really good and for the price of only $2.50, it's pretty good quality. Reminded me of Thai Tea when I went to Thailand \n\nFood: The Pad Thai and Fried Rice was not the very best. I had better. However, this is coming from someone who had amazing Thai food from Thailand and eat Thai food pretty often, Berkeley student status. The Fried Rice was really soggy. The Pad Thai was a bit saucy in my opinion. I like my Pad Thai dry and it was far from dry. The fish cake that came with Fried Rice was really good though. The fish cake was amazing :) I might come back just to try more of the fish cake. \n\nService: Purely amazing. My mom was astonished by the fluency of everyone in Thai. She kept commenting on their cultural roots. The service really made up for the food. They were fast and efficient. \n\nPrice: In my opinion, I think the price is pretty average since it's slightly pricey compared to Berkeley Thai food places. However, since it was located in Union Square, the price is average. Since I paid for lunch, it would have made me happier if the prices were a bit lower. I think 9 bucks for a dish of Pad Thai was a bit pricey :(", "author": "Diana D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-28", "description": "I'm not a huge fan of Thai food. In fact, when a group of us get together ever so rarely the answer to the question, \"what should we eat?\" will always be \"not Thai.\" But alas, you've finally got me to take the bait King of Thai. A co-worker had a horrible hankering for it and since I was the reason for his missed breakfast, I offered to grab whatever his heart desired. His heart desired Thai food of all things because apparently he was a mind reader and could see my brain waves read, \"anything but Thai, anything but Thai, anything but Thai...\"\n\nAh well, it was my fault and I'm the kind of girl to go back on her word so I ran to KOT with absolutely no expectations of anything remotely decent. Other Thai restaurants in the city had ruined Thai for me for months so it wasn't really their fault. I understood they had a large clientele base and there was always a line out the door and around the corner for some reason so I'll admit I was a teeny tiny bit biased.\n\nAfter studying the menu for a minute and narrowing down the soups, I decided on the wonton soup (to be on the safe side) and Pad Thai for the co-worker. Apparently, college age boys have a four compartmental stomach much like cows and each stomach must be filled with Kraft Jet Puff, granola bars, Gatorade, and Pad Thai or something in peanut form. Must be something about reverting to childhood favorites that keep them going. \n\nI walked inside and was semi-greeted by the girl at the take-out counter. I say semi-greeted because I wasn't sure if she was saying \"hi, how can I help you?\" or \"how many today?\" or \"welcome to Yu's dry cleaning\" because of her thick accent. I'm horrible with understanding anything that's not spoken in perfect English nowadays (which is ironic indeed) so conversing in any metropolitan city has become the obstacle for me as of late. Anyhow, I pushed on and ordered the entrees, paid, and stood there. And stood...and stood some more. The shame about this place is that they don't have a take-out waiting area to make way for more tables to sit down at. Imagine if it was raining??\n\nApparently, the take-out girl had the same problem understanding me and I had understanding her because lo and behold, only the soup came out. The only reason for me walking in a Thai place and there was no Pad Thai in my bag. That could have been my fault of course-maybe I didn't speak clearly enough? Maybe I should have counted my change to verify I was charged an amount that seemed reasonable for 2 entrees? In any case, she apologized politely, assured me it would be out quickly since it was only noodles and offered me a seat at the bar single seating area. \n\nAt this point, it was me who was starving. Against etiquette and better judgement, my stomach won out and I dug into the wontons. One by one, I plopped a delectable dumpling in the hot chicken broth, mixed in half a container's worth of hot sauce and found a much better way to pass the time. The broth was hot, full of herbs and tasted like a healthy alternative to chicken noodle soup and the dumplings were my very own two bite interludes.  A server randomly passed by and dropped off a glass of water as I waited which I thought was a lovely touch. And about a 1/4 of the way down the soup container, a pad thai was delivered and I was on my way again. \n\nI felt guilty it took over 30 minutes to just get noodles out of there but they did make up for it the second time with their quick service and graciousness. It's still not going to make me crave Thai food anytime soon but I won't be kicking and screaming next time someone suggests it.", "author": "Jessica K."}

I haven't been to one of these in awhile, so I'm a bit apprehensive.\n\nWith a party of two, we are seated at one of those tables just for two.  I ordered the #17 Pad Kee Mao (Stir fried flat rice noodle and your choice of ground meat with green bean, bell pepper, Thai chili and basil) with beef at $6.75.  Row M. ordered #18 Pad Thai (Stir fried small rice noodle, shrimps, dry shrimps, egg, ground peanut, tofu, raw bean sprouts with red paprika and lime juice) at $6.95.  We also requested two plates to share.\n\nAs we waited for our order, I watched as our neighboring table got their order of Pad Kee Mao.  (Hmmm, didn't they order after us?)  And then when an order of Pad Thai was headed our way, we thought it was for sure going to us.  Nope, it went next door.  \n\nRow M.: It doesn't usually take this long...\nMe: I think that table got our order...\n\nFinally, my order of Pad Kee Mao arrives.  We wait for the Pad Thai...and see it coming our way...only for the waitress to stop at the next table.  She proceeds to look over at the table, realizes they have their order already, and then walks over to us.  She places the Pad Thai down and I have to remind her about the two plates.\n\nMe: Yeah, they got our order.\n\nThe Pad Kee Mao was oh-so tasty.  I haven't had it in awhile and it was yummy and full of flavor.  I'm not big on bell peppers, but I was eating these up!  The green beans could have been cooked a little longer as they were overly crunchy.  I would still order this again.  The Pad Thai was decent, standard Pad Thai if anything.  It only came with three pieces of shrimp though.\n\nOverall, the two orders were tasty and we had leftovers to boot!  I love the ground peanuts and green chilies that are left at your table.  I wish the wait staff came around to fill our water glasses though.  I had to get up and help myself to the pitcher of water myself.  (Wait, are we supposed to do that here?)  King of Thai works when you want of taste of Thai without the tablecloth napkins and higher prices.\n\nSide note: On their front door, they have a sign saying they'll refund your money if you are unhappy with your order.  I wonder what happened for them to post this signage up.  Hmmm, I wonder how many people ask for their money back.", "author": "Teri C."}

It is, as he put it, \"one of my favorite lunch break spots.\"\n\nWhich is a pretty accurate description.  It's a good place to catch a very informal bite to eat.  Cuisine is not spectacular, but it is tasty, portions are large, and it's cheap.  I wouldn't travel out of my way to come here, but when I'm in the area shopping this is a favorite pit stop if I'm not looking to spend too much or wait too long.  \n\nMy favorite is the pad thai.  They make it sweeter here than at other thai places I frequent, but still good and usually I can finish about half before I'm completely stuffed.  There's an eggplant and rice dish that I enjoy a lot, and pineapple fried rice is also yummy.  \n\nIt's open fairly late, and I've never seen it too crowded. I think the longest I've found myself waiting for a table was 15 minutes.

But, it didn't bother me =). I also noticed the bin of chopsticks next to us... which made the germ-a-phobe in me freak out a little, but I was so hungry, I didn't let it bother me either. \n\nSince this place is a noodle house, I had to try a noodle soup - which looked soo good while passing other people's tables. I ordered the first item on the list, which was the sliced beef in spicy beef broth with egg noodles... and I hope I go back so I can try #2, #3... and so on. The food came to me so quickly, in a huge bowl, with which I was instantly intimidated thinking I wouldn't make a dent in this thing. The broth was very tasty with the right amount of spice, the noodles had a really good texture and the beef was just right. I was extremely satisfied with my order and ate all the food but didn't dare drink all the soup... And the thai iced tea was really good, too.\n\nI highly recommend for the quick service, portion size and the right price.

Oh and it was very freshly brewed.\n\nMy favorite dishes: pad thai, beef combo noodle soup, roast duck noodle soup, papaya salad, yellow curry, beef larb, pad see ew, rad na,  And their thai chili peppers are smoking hot..and always hit the spot!

Food service also had the same speed, even though this place seemed to be moderately busy for 6pm on a Sunday.\n\nWe ordered the Street Noodles, Pumpkin Curry, Tom Yum and three mint lemonades. \n\nThe Street Noodles had the right amount of punch to them, but weren't so hot that they would burn a hole in your mouth. They weren't too greasy either (a common problem with this guilty pleasure of mine). We had originally planned to split the curry and the noodles as two of us were torn, but I found my self zealously defending them after a few bites. \n\nThe Pumpkin Curry had a smooth consistency and intriguing flavor. It didn't have the wow factor of the street noodles, but at this point I think I was biased. It did have a nice balance and was moderately spicy. My friend who ended up with it really enjoyed it and left nothing on her plate (which is a feat for her).\n\nI didn't get to try the Tom Yum, but the bowl was huge! It smelled delicious and J. spent more time eating than talking, so I take this as a positive sign.\n\nThe star of the show was the mint lemonade.

It was brought out with those yellow thin noodles so I told them it wasn't what I ordered (in case it was actually someone else's order or something) and the waitress told me that I should have ordered this kind of noodles anyway because it's how it's traditionally made and it tastes better blah blah it's her personal preference.  Thanks for telling me I have bad taste, betch!  The noodles taste better with flat rice noodles by the way.  The waitress was WRONG!!  \n\nBut damn it their duck fried rice and duck noodle soup is the best combo after a day shopping in SF.", "author": "Anna T."}

I wanted some hot soup and there it was, a Thai noodle place!\n\nMy expectation wasn't high going in but I didn't think it was going to be a total disappointment, because the restaurant was crowded.  I quickly was seated and I ordered a roasted duck noodle soup with flat rice noodle and an order of egg roll.  Add a star here because they let you choose the kind of noodle you want from 4 different types of noodles.\n\nEgg roll was under par.  It was hot and crispy but the stuffing didn't have much flavor.\n\nThe noodle soup was exactly what I wanted.  It was steaming hot, the broth was good and the duck was tender and flavorful.  An extra star here.\n\nI went back the next evening and ordered the Kee Mao noodle with ground chicken.  I was disappointed with this dish for several reasons.  \n\nFirst of all, they only make this noodle with ground meat, that is, if you want meat with it.  I'm not too crazy about ground meat, be it beef, chicken or pork.  I ordered it with chicken and told the waitress to make it \"spicy.\"  She asked me if I really wanted it spicy and I assured her that's what I wanted and...\n\nIt wasn't spicy at all.  I mean, it didn't have any flavor at all, I must say.  It looked as if the chef just threw in some small pieces of vegetables like bell peppers and tomatoes with a few basil leaves and stir fried it with noodle.  And the ground chicken was the only ingredient that had any flavor that was 'salty'.\n\nIn spite of the disappointment I had with the egg roll and the Kee Mao noodle, I am giving this place a 4 star because they hit the nail on the head with the duck noodle soup.  \n\nThe service was friendly and quick.  They do take credit card if the total comes over $10. \n\nI am definitely going back in one of those chilly nights in San Francisco...", "author": "Phyllis K."}

I would have enjoyed a few pieces of broccolli or carrot or any other vegetables. And the flavour of the noodles was nothing to write home about either. Anyway, I hardly ate anything, paid my bill and took off. \n\nThere's not going to be a next time for me. But for the owners of this establishment, please put a little more effort into vegetarian requests- a vegetarian meal doesn't only mean the exclusion of meat, but it also involves perhaps an inclusion of a sprinkling of some vegetables like broccoli, carrots, peas, bok choy or whatever your imagination has failed you so far. \n\nThanks for the bad experience.

Another myth is that the word, the \"tip,\" is an acronym. Tip = To Insure Promptness. This has been largely debunked. As most folks on Yelp can attest, the quickness of service at a restaurant is just one aspect factored into a tip. \n\nIf it was the only one, then King of Thai's servers would deserve 20% tips each time, no question. They are perpetually oiled and charged machines with the power to seat you, plunk your food in front of you, and present you with the bill in under half an hour, not an easy feat in such a high-traffic area as Union Square. You can't expect very much of a machine, right? Certainly not extended eye contact or kindly pleasantries about your general state of being. I can live without those, really. I know the restaurant is busy and will continue to be busy, so there's no time to pamper my tourist-ish ass. But my water glass was touched twice throughout the meal - once when it was filled at the start and again, presumably, when the table was bussed. Add that to the brusque style of service, and I just don't see why anyone would expect any more than a strict 15% tip.\n\nIt's a shame since the food is quite good. Fried rice with duck and kee mao were ordered, and both had just the right combinations of grease and flavor. Maybe I shouldn't really disparage one of the few cheap and fast options that isn't Jack in a Box in Union Square, which is not an area traditionally known for exemplary customer service anyway. But I ate here at the end of my stay in San Francheesy, we tipped 20% because we were in a hurry and felt like we had no other choices, and it makes me miss the extra bills floating around my purse.", "author": "Kimberly V."}

I can't help but to wonder why they were given an award as the Best Thai Restaurant in SF 2012.  But I assure you, it's not from Yelp. So next time you are in Powell St. and craves for Thai food just head to Bangkok Restaurant instead or go to Westfield Mall food court.", "author": "Kit P."}

They give you such generous portions, and there's a lot to choose from the menu! Depending on what you get, usually the prices range from $6-$10.  I can't remember the name of the food I got, it was like the thai version of chow fun, but it was a little too salty, but not so much that I would complain over it.\nMy friends and I came here for a late night munchie before going clubbing in the Castro.  Actually, this makes a really good late-night/pre-clubbing eatery.  It was still pretty crowded during the late hours.  There are quite a few gay/les who come here too, it seems like.  Anyway.

Everyone knows that many places hired \"day workers\" or \"cash jobs\"  I just found out that many of the waiters and waitresses get paid $20-$50 for working 8-12 hour shifts.  Many of these are international students and need money to support themselves and also for their families in Thailand.  This really upset me when I found out that the owner crusies around with a Lamborghini from the sweat and tears of these abused workers?  That type of high living is because of the cheap labor...all people should get paid a decent amount to survive in San Francisco.

The pra ram, which is a dish I've never seen at other Thai restaurants, is composed of your choice of meat or seafood, spinach, and Napa cabbage all topped with a thick peanut sauce that is sweet with just the slightest hint ot heat.  That peanut sauce was fabulous, especially with some white rice, though I added some sambal hot sauce to increase the heat.  Its very reminiscent of the sauce that one gets with chicken satays so if you're fan, I'd definitely order this dish. \n\nThe location is very accessible to those who are working in the Union Square/downtown area and to those who are doing their holiday shopping.  The restaurant is fairly busy but turnover is pretty quick considering the efficient staff and the fast kitchen.  I was able to order, eat, and be out of there in about a half hour.  Servings are huge and you will definitely be full on a single order- you may even be able to share an entree if you aren't too hungry.\n\n3.5 stars that I'm dropping to 3 only because half the rice that came with my order was a little old.  One half was nice and fresh while the other was a little hard and dry.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-06-06", "description": "Of the four King of Thai Noodle restaurants that I have visited so far this one was easily the most chaotic in terms of overall service.  Located just doors away from Macy's Union Square this is a very popular restaurant with diners revolving through the doors at all hours.\n\nYou can pretty much expect the same quality food that you get at other King of Thai Noodle restaurants, but it is the slightly comical service that I received which I will remember most from my visit.  First of all the tables aren't wiped down very well at this restaurant, and don't bother asking one of the waitresses to wipe it for you because apparently they don't do tables here.  Mine had a sticky residue covering a good third of the tabletop.  \n\nOK.  Sit down.  Open the menu.  The first thing you notice is the spine is broken on the very worn menus, and the laminated but cracked pages are just waiting to fall out.  Study the menu well because the waitress won't be back to take your order for awhile.  During this time another waitress has brought me a cup of cold water, but she ignores my request to put in an order.  I've always liked King of Thai Noodle because I can choose the type of noodle (four types of noodle available) that goes into my noodle soup.  On this visit I ordered the Chicken Noodle Soup which is one of their more simpler selections.  So yet another waitress returns to take my order.  At any other King of Thai Noodle the food comes out of the kitchen exceptionally fast but not here.  My wait was close to fifteen minutes.  That gave me time to look around my surroundings and noticed the disgusting, dirty floor with used napkins, food particles and even chopsticks throughout.\n\nMy food arrived.  It's what I expected, a nice portion of noodles swimming in a big bowl with clear chicken broth and freshly chopped cilantro and green onion on top.  There are lots of thinly sliced chicken breast meat surrounding the noodles.  As I reach into the utensil holder to grab a pair of chopsticks and a soup spoon my waitress (same one that took the order) picks up a condiments tray with the five different spicy oils on it from an empty table and puts it on my table.  No sooner than I could pick up a piece of chicken from my soup did another waitress come by and pick up that tray of condiments and move it to yet another occupied table.  My waitress noticed this because she stopped and said something to the other waitress, but I didn't get the condiments tray back.  \n\nThe chicken meat was pretty much flavorless.  As much flavor as boiled white meat chicken can have I guess.  The noodles were firm and chewy and the soup was flavorful.  Several minutes later I had already consumed all of the chicken and most of the noodles when my waitress returned with another tray of condiments.  Thanks!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

We got our waters but we didn't have ice in it, which was weird. I just hate how they don't give you straws because I'm not a big fan of just drinking it straight from the cup. I got the pineapple-fried rice, which I shouldn't have got because it had all the bad stuff I shouldn't be eating but it was good. Lol. My friend got the pad thai but for some reason when she got it, she looked at it with disgust. I think the reason why is because of the peanut sauce that they used, I'm not sure. I just remember a while back she hated Thai food so I guess it was a bad idea to bring her here. Lol. Her boyfriend ended up eating his plate along with the plate he had. On the other hand, my boyfriend did not like their pho. He said Kevin's Noodle House is way better probably because he didn't like the taste of the soup. Overall, it was all right.

I phoned my order in and picked it up about 15 minutes later.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I've consistently had what I consider to be the best Pad See Ew anywhere at the Geary/Mason location.  There's some amazing flavor in there that no other place in the area seems to be able to impart in their dishes. \n\nThe overflowing O'Farrell location, on the other hand, served me some foul, nasty Pad See Ew.  It made me pity all those people waiting in line.  The Geary St. location, albeit small, usually has a table available for lunch.  Go there.  Please.\n\nI normally eat at Banana House on Kearny and it's mediocre at best.

The dish came out fast and piping hot.  I liked how the portion of noodles was generous instead of being overly meaty, although not having enough meat in a dish is probably the more common complaint.  Sometimes pad see ew can be overly garlicky as well, but this place makes it right to my liking.  There were a ton of things on the menu which is very slick and colorful with lots of pictures.  But I made my decision fast since the longer I peruse the options, the more trouble I have deciding what to get.  \n\nThe restaurant was fairly crowded for a Wednesday night, but I figured given the location, which is right down the street from Macy's, it probably attracts a lot of shoppers and tourists.  The decor consisted of a LOT of purple and neon.  I appreciated the non-slip floor since greasy places tend to have super slippery floors that make the trek to the bathroom in the back extremely hazardous.  The prices are moderate - I think it was $7.25 for my meal?  These days I tend to go to the newer food court at the mall for food while shopping, but this place is a good secondary option.\n\nThe waitresses seemed competent and friendly enough and I will give them credit for filling our water glasses promptly every time they dipped below halfway full.  Originally, we were directed to a table for two that was literally half an inch from the people sitting next to us.  I would have felt like we were intruding on their dinner and I hate having to watch what I say.  Luckily, the waitress was cool with us moving to a larger table by the window.

After we ordered we were seated at a large table in the back then 15 minutes later we were asked to move because another family needed to sit there. .. simply unorganized to begin with. Will not be returning I never feel taken care of by the service but more so used for my money. Less is more and there are way too many people working in such a small environment I feel like everyone is hovering waiting for you to finish your food. If you do decide to eat at this place get it to go it's way less bothersome.", "author": "Brooklyn A."}

Though it's a bit of a walk from the FiDi, it's hard to resist.  It's the most flavorful Thai place I've encountered in the last 9 months!  \n\nI've tried a few dishes (ranked in order of preference, best to worst):  Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Fried Chicken, and I liked them all.  If you like your food spicy, make sure to let the wait staff know.  I opted for spice at 7 and I could barely eat my noodles; I had to order two Thai Iced Teas.  My mouth was en fuego!  After the two iced teas, I was also wired.\n\nThe wait staff in purple are very accommodating.  For the non-meat eating folk, they serve tofu instead of meat, so you can satiate your palate.\n\nThe place is always crowded at lunch, but service is quick and the turnover is pretty fast.  It's a cash only place; there is an ATM outside if you forget to bring your moolah and your friends aren't willing to spot you $10.  The entrees average $7/plate.\n\nI wish this place was open later because it's a good place to hit after a few rounds at the bar.  The food should help to sober you up.\n\nAs much as I like the place, I've got a few gripes.  The last couple of times I've been there, they've forgotten to serve us our iced teas before the entrees arrived.  Today, I also found a small strand of hair when I had some of my friend's Pineapple Fried Rice.  We didn't send it back, but before I found the hair, the rice was pretty damn tasty!  Maybe the hair added extra flavor...\n\nI'd rate this place a 4, but because of today's incident, I need to knock off one star.  If I could take off half a star, I would since it was less than half a piece of a strand of hair...

They seemed overpriced for their size and the amount of ice they were filled with.\nThen we sat and sat and sat  and sat some more for what seemed like a trillion years. It took close to half an hour for our food to arrive and we were getting pretty restless. We asked a waiter about our food and she left for a while before the pineapple fried rice arrived. It was garnished with lettuce, tomato, and cucumber. The pad thai came next, with bean sprouts and shrimp. The pad thai was quite wet and by the end of the meal it was slimy. The noodles that they used were very thin, unlike the numerous other pad thai that we tried at other places. The thin noodles stuck together and there was no texture when eating it. There was a hint of spiciness and that was about it. The dish was not very flavorful overall. The pineapple fried rice was very savory, with a hint of coriander. The dish came out hot and the pineapple gave just the right balance of sweetness.", "author": "Lesley T."}

But then again, can I really expect too much from King of Thai? \nThe food however, was good. So I'm guessing it is normal to have raw bean sprouts with pad thai, cause its the second time I noticed. All I have to do is put the noodles over the bean sprouts and let it cook a bit. The #17 was quite delicious, better than Chinese chow fun!", "author": "Elaine H."}

The city of San Francisco gives out those ratings for food service practices--you know, the ones on a 1-100 scale.  It looks like restaurants are required to post them where they can be seen.

The next lowest number I've seen in a restaurant was probably in the 80s.  I didn't get a chance to scrutinize the paper more to find out the reason for such an abysmal score.\n\nBecause I take risks and don't think much about germs, I went back.

I do not like vegetables in my fried rice. However, it was late and I was a little hungry so I sucked it up and kind of ate around the vegetables. The fried chicken is what really made this dish as the fried rice was just ok. \n\nFor the price and how late they're open KoT can be great late night place to eat, but the food is just ok.

Score another one for King of Thai.\n\n5.  Cute waitresses - I know that doesn't matter to most people but hey, they're cute, friendly and they recognize you and say hi.  \n\n6.  Open late - I've popped in here around 10:30 PM on a Monday night to pick some food up on the way home.\n\n7.  Noodles - I'm not a big noodle eater but when I've ordered their noodles they were tasty and a little heavy on the vegetables.  Wish they added more meat.\n\nThe only negatives:\n\n1.  No delivery!

Sometimes the service is fast, but sometimes they will serve 3 of the 5 people at a table and wait 10 minutes to serve the other two. \nIt's just mass chaos. \nI have a pretty regular to-go order when I come in on a work day. Pad see Ew, with carrots added.

Both people behind me left with their orders first, and when I finally got mine, I was relieved.

I mean, really... chefs that serve wires and cockroaches in their food and now something raw??? \n\nI went here for the first time after my cousin told me that they're pretty good. We ordered three dishes: pad thai, bbq pork fried rice, and something that looked like pad see ew (#16, I believe). When my dish came out (#16), I gave it a check over and noticed that the noodles were rather brown, just thinking it was the sauce and that's how it's supposed to look because of the sauce. As I was putting the noodles on my plate, I grabbed the shrimp and quickly noticed how grey and LIMP it was! To my disbelief, the shrimp was completely uncooked.. no pink whatsoever. After pointing this out to the waitress, she took the plate away. I scanned over my noodles that I already had on my plate and bit into the imitation crab meat. It was COLD! Oh my god, how could anyone.. ANYONE send out a dish like this???? Of course, they cancelled our order and we didn't have to pay for it, but in the end I was too disgusted to eat any of their other food. Should have taken a picture...\n\nI would never go here again. Their cooks obviously put no notice to their food and think it is OK to send out food with wires, cockroaches and raw food out to their customers. This place def. does NOT deserve 3.5 stars.

With so few decently priced places to eat in the Union Sq area- this is a safe bet.  It's even safer to order noodle soup if you want prompt service.  Rice noodle soup ALWAYS arrives before any stir-fry dish at a table.  The stir fry dishes are typically oily, but that's Thai food in general, don't kid yourself.  The upside is that the Noodle Soup broth is decent, which is what matters and the meats-- beef, pork, duck are tender and delicate-- haven't tried the chicken yet.

Things must have changed a lot since the last time I've gone. The server girl mixed up our order even though we all said our order clearly and even pointed to our item on the menu to show her since we couldn't pronounce it. It should have been simple, it should have been a no brainer. NOPE. A dish comes out a few minutes after we order and we're all a bit confused on how quickly it came out and how it didn't look anything like what we ordered. The server keeps pushing the dish to us, insisting this is what we got, even though we told her THREE TIMES straight that that's NOT WHAT WE ORDERED. I'm pretty sure the word \"no\" is the most simplest thing to learn in the English language.\n\n I'm not a huge stickler for service in hole in the wall restaurants like King of Thai so I'm fine with order mix ups as long as its handled with politeness. Not here, not today. The server kept pushing the dish at us despite our protests and even brought out the menu to show this was what we ordered. She might as well call us liars right out and tell us we don't know what we're talking about because that's definitely the feeling we all got from her. My friend had pointed to her order on the menu when we first ordered to avoid confusion but that sure as hell didn't do anything. I watched that server girl pass on the dish to another server who then proceeded to take it over to a table who nodded that it was theirs. I was steaming at this point because she didn't even come over to apologize. In fact, it was another girl who apologized. To make things even more ridiculous, that same rude server came back and repeated my other friend's order in a huffy commanding voice. That order came much later than all our dishes, which makes me think that rude server didn't get that order right either. So stupid. \n\nWe left a 12% tip (GENEROUS in my opinion) and left with bad feelings. Do the basics in serving (get our order in good time, bring out the right orders, refill our water if need) and I leave at LEAST 15% if not usually more. I'm not coming back to this place and I sure as hell am not going to recommend it to the NUMEROUS people I know who often ask me where they should eat.

Though the restaurant was packed, they found my group a seat very quickly--upstairs and away from the loud crowds. There was a flat screen TV and air con upstairs, compared to the ceiling fans downstairs. Service was decently quick; I felt sorry for the waiter having to carry food from the kitchen downstairs for the 8 or so tables on the second level. Some days though, service can be pretty slow, but luckily due to the purple polos that they wear, you can easily spot one of the 12+ waiters/waitresses frantically running around to try and help you. Their policy, however, is nice: to apologize for an inconvenience, they offer a drink on the house. Many of their tables are four-seaters, so if you are only a group of two, on a busy day, you may be asked to relocate seats due to a larger group coming in and the need to combine tables. If you can stand a busy lunch crowd and somewhat slow service, I recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Brittany L."}

This was not the first time I have been to the King of Thai chain and particularly to this location. It is just next to Macy's and is always my preference of dinning choice if I am shopping in downtown. I am not disappointed by the food. My one star is plainly for the services and hygiene situation of this restaurant.\n\nI went there Friday night at 9pm. It was always crowded in this restaurant and my friend had a table under the stairs in the back end of their restaurant. The air circulation in that particular area was extremely bad. Seeing a lot of people walking up and down the stairs always made me want to change table. \n\nSince there was a couple sitting in the four-people table behind ours, I decided to take on the empty four-people table next to ours. I was spotted by a waitress who was walking down the stairs and was told that this is a \"busy\" hour and the table was reserved for four. As nice customers, we stayed at our table. But in the middle of my meal, another couple was allowed to sit in that reserved for four table.\n\nI could not let my expensive purse plus my big brown bag on the dirty and sticky floor. I took an empty chair to put my stuff on it. Another waitress walking up the stairs rudely told us move the chair not to block the way, and then there she goes, she used her leg to push it to the spot blocking my friend's chair from exiting. Her rude attitude caught attention of the couple who was originally sitting in the four-people table.\n\nI was looking around for still better table to sit at, and my seat was facing particularly the guy who pour water and make drink. If I had taken out my phone fast enough, I should have taken pictures so I have prove to tell everyone I am not lying about what I saw this day.\n\nHere are the RED FLAGS:\n\n**************************************************************************\n1) The guy was making two Thai Ice tea when I first notice him in action. I don't understand why he was using his raw finger to dip into the ice (like playing the ice...?)\n2) Then, he was pouring ice water into like 8 cups and let them stand in the counter. He literally used his finger to blush the edge of the almost every cup!! I was wondering why he had such action and then realized maybe to blush away lipsticks on the cups!!!\n3) A white uniform person came out from the kitchen to go to the restroom, seeing me wide open my eyes looking shocked to the guy, informed the guy I am looking at what he is doing. (Because it was quite clear I am not checking him out) The guy stopped all his weird behavior after this. \n4) Our waitress was taking our order at the time and I already asked for straw to drink water (which is my usual habit). This guy brought me my straw after I spotted his actions and it feels weird. I regret I am in a Thai restaurant (having spicy food) and did not bring my own beverage!!\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nAt the end, our meals sum up to $16.5. Even though I already told my friend I am not leaving tips (have not done that in more than 5 years), my lazy friend just leave $20 without getting any change back. I was so angry at my friend it makes me go back to High-school. I told her exact words, \"I am going to be mad at you right now.\" \n\nI do not agree you should always leave tips at a certain percentage because tips should reflect your opinion on each and every service. Later on, I decided that I cannot let King of Thai not only ruined my dinner but my friendship. I called my friend and we are okay now. I would just never go back to this location and would go to this Thai place a little bit down on Powell if I want Thai food in this area.", "author": "Angel K."}

I add tons of peanuts and peppers on my food (not to say I'm taking away from the original taste though - just a preference).

So, getting out at 11:30PM, not too many options. Since this place was open late, and only a few blocks away, we decided to check it out. It was pretty busy for so late at nigh - always good sign. Waitress came by to take our order (I had the duck over rice and husband ordered the pad kee mao). My duck was delivered (pretty tasty, but the sauce on top of it took away the crispy texture that I love) and I started eating while waiting for my husband's dish. We waited while the tables around us got their noodle orders. We waited while I fished my dish. Waited while trying to make eye contact with the wait staff. No such luck. We waited as they came by and picked up my empty plate. Husband had given up by then and decided he wasn't that hungry anyway. When they dropped off the check, there was an \"oh, did you order pad kee mao too??!!\" Nevermind.", "author": "Eme L."}

I originally wanted Pizza to absorb the alcohol that was consumed in my Stew Match, so this king of thai was right next door to a pizza joint. We walkin into the pizza joint and stand in line. Aris was like..\"dude...King of Thai sounds really good right now.\" so i was like..\"ya. what in the flying hell are we thinking standing in line for some bunk ass pizza. what are we stupid? (then it dawned upon my knuckleheadness of half a brain i got left that i was severely intoxicated) Lets get up out this joint\" so 37 seconds later, we walk next door to this King of Thai. I check my cell phone and i swear it was exactly  your daylightsavings time of 1:37am and 37 seconds. Beeep! (P.O.P.C.O.R.N.) so we get seated, and Aris goes \"DAMMNN...this IS gonna be GOOD!\" the waitress was supposed to give us a menu...and i throw the palm in the air. i was like..\"hold on baby...no need to bother with the menu. I would like to order the Beef Thai Lahd Nah and Chicken Fried Rice\". i knewed that we were limited with time because they were nice enough to serve us since they were ready to close shop. Anyways...it prolly only took them 5 minutes and 37 seconds to bring out our food. Me and Aris were hungry as hell so we scarfed those plates. so exactly 37 degrees to our left, there were these 3 asian girls and two white dudes. all of a sudden, one of the asian girls completely went MAD! she started Yelling at juan of the other asian girls and used some vulgar language and unacceptaple broken english that offended me. I was just like...O gorts. me and aris were crackin up. and aris was like..NO NEED TO BE MAD...THE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD HERE! i agreed with aris and i replied...\"YA...HOW CAN YOU BE UPSET AT A PLACE LIKE THIS. THE FOOD IS HEY-BEN TO ME\" i meant to said \"heaven\" but since i was around fobs, the hey-bee accent came out of me. So right before the Angry Asian chick walked out, she was like..\"I HATE SPICEY FOOD! I FORCED MYSELF TO EAT THIS BECAUSE OF YOU!\" i was like...that is the reason you blew up? i thought that in my head of course cuz i was scared she might sock me in the face. So when she left and walked out, i mentioned to the Waitress that I LOVE THEIR FOOD! SO WHAT! GO WARRIORS! then i also mentioned that I completely walked out of the Pizza joint next door because I WANTED KING OF THAI! KING OF THAI! i then said, \"when im feeling down or depressed...this is the place to make me happy. I LOVE THIS FOOD! I REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THIS FOOD\" the cooks were around and they laughed but im sure they really appreciated my words and said thank you. then right before me and aris cut out of that joint, i bowed down to the cooks and waitressess like \"we're not worthy! we're not worthy\" anyways..what a long ass review. couldnt i just have said..this place is good check out the stars i provided? *shakes head*  did u guys fall asleep too while i was telling this story? zzzzzzzzzzzZZzzzzzz", "author": "Romes K."}

It's not too \"authentic\" if you catch my drift (i.e. you can read the descriptions on the menu in English). You can take a meat and potatoes man and tell him \"trust me you'll find something here you'll like\" and chances are he will! However although service here is quick, it is forgetful---as in the last three times I've been here they've forgotten my drink order! I am two steps away from wearing a shirt saying \"Don't forget my dietCoke!\" but (a) I don't think that anyone working their or not, would get it. and (b) even if anyone noticed my shirt in the first place, it would be my friend Dani who would steal said shirt and wear it with pride anywhere BUT King Of Thai Noodle House (because it's SO much easier to listen to a petite female than a mini tree like myself-yeah right). Oh well, despite muttering to themselves in a foreign language under their breath (major major turnoff by the way-regardless of what language you speak) they get a bonus point just for being quick and cheap (2 people, 2 bowls of soup plus reasonable tip less than $20=hells yea!!).

This chain restaurant has a few locations, we went to the one over by Mezzanine.  The good thing about this place is that it is open late.  You can go here after a club or if you just feel hungry late at night.  Other than that, there's no reason to go here.  Go to a real Thai place.  We had thai iced tea (of course) which was ok, and then i had some chicken noodle dish.  It was slightly greasy and fast food tasting, and i couldn't finish it.  Not bad, but definitely not good.  One friend had the spring rolls, which she liked.  Another had a dish that was supposed to be a chicken curryish thing but was really just a large bowl of orange sauce.  The sauce was ok, but it wasn't a meal.  Our other friend had a bowl of soup, which was again, just ok.  The restaurant itself had no ambiance, i felt like i was in a hotel - you even needed a card to go to the bathroom.  So, skip the chains, go to the real places.", "author": "Merredith L."}

The meat was scarce and it was just mostly a plate piled high with white rice. For the price, I feel you should get a lot bigger portion and more meat.
