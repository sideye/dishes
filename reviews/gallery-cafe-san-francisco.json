I live a block away and even in coffee desperation I try not to come here because it is THE WORST. Here's some of the top issues \n\n* The coffee tastes burnt and always gross. \n*They don't take credit cards, the ATM in the corner never works and wastes your time with stupid signs written on it \"if it doesn't work, try it again\". Are you kidding me? Take my credit card like every other establishment in 2018. At the very least, have an ATM machine that works. \n* the staff is always rude. Always. \n* I was the only person in there once and they made me move tables cause I was at a no laptop table. I'm not exaggerating... I was the only human inside. \n\nI ain't no snob, but I do expect more than this half assed and poorly executed shop with mean staff and nasty coffee.", "author": "Jeannine R."}

Complete with hanging comic books of Amazing superheroes, the music of the Andrew Sisters, Tommy Dorsey, and an antique cafe full of books and other nostalgic memorabilia. It's a true step back to an era where America stood tall, proud and united. A historical vintage television sits im front of a movie screen with a hand taped sign that reads \"Creature Feature Tuesday\" while the San Francisco trolly cars bustle past and rounding the corner just off the cafe entrance. \n\nThe menu caters to all diets. Granola and yogut, egg covered english muffins, drinks, and handsome meals a plenty to offer any patron. \n\nThe aromas pour out the open glass doors towards the Cable Car Museum.

The aforementioned long-haired fellow has a singing voice that's worse than you've ever heard. Far worse than even your own. Guaranteed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-04", "description": "I really really want to love this place, but there are such glaring problems that it's hard to. I live about 30 seconds from this spot, so I've been in a few times over the past few years. I visited again today because I needed to do some work on my laptop, and didn't feel like staring at the usual scenery. \n\nThe Good: \n* The decorations and atmosphere are super cool. There is a large area for books and magazines, creative wall accessories, board games, and I'm pretty sure they screen classic movies on some nights in this little area with couches and movie theater seats.\n* They recently added a \"cubicle simulation\" corner that is slightly separated from the main seating. It's only enough room for 1 person, but it's a cute sectioned off area for someone looking to use their laptop with more privacy. \n* They have a decent amount of outlets and extensions cords for plugging in devices.\n\nThe Bad:\n* The food. The food is incredibly pricey for a caf\u00e9. Yes, even in San Francisco. The breakfast sandwiches are small, and VERY bland. I don't think they use salt or pepper at all. To make the most out of your money, I suggest getting a bagel with cream cheese, as it seems to be the only affordable option in terms of quality and quantity. But get there early, because they only allot a certain amount of bagels per day, and they run out of options quickly.\n* The coffee (depending on who is making it). It's just...not good. I've had drip coffee from here a few times and it's usually very weak. I was surprised when I had an amazing latte from here this morning. The ratio of milk to espresso was perfect, and there was an adequate amount of foam. I decided to get another because the first was so good, but the woman made it this time, and it was really bad. Tasted burnt, and there was no foam at all. Not even a hint. I couldn't finish it. She was pushing out coffee drinks so fast that I doubt anyone had any quality to their coffee order.\n* The \"Cash-Only\" policy. If things weren't so expensive, I could get over this. Can't you install a square reader? Apple pay? It seems that this might be a nod to their attempts at making this spot more nostalgic of older times when stores only accepted cash, but I think they'd get more service and even be able to up-charge more if they offered other ways to pay.\n* Finally, the service. I've had good experiences with the guys here, I'll give them that. They're polite and friendly- what you'd expect from any basic customer service interaction. But when it comes to the ladies who work here, that's another story. I'm not sure what her name is, but there's an older asian woman who dresses with lots of cleavage (totally fine, just not sure how else to describe her). Anyway, she's INCREDIBLY loud. She screams everyones order, it's really alarming. I've also found that she is only nice to the male customers. I've witnessed this more than once while there. She gives the female customers a ton of attitude for no reason, and then openly flirts with the men. I even overheard her today joking with a random guy about how he should have said \"thank you ~princess~\" instead of just thank you. Super weird. She also openly yelled at this younger girl working the register, in front of all of the customers. Just really unprofessional and off-putting.\n\nIt seems that they do try to present this \"hard-ass\", \"dgaf\" attitude on purpose, like it's part of their schtick, but the atmosphere of the place seems oddly contradictory to that kind of demeanor. If this were a caf\u00e9 connected to Zietgiest, I'd get it. But it's not. It seems like they really need to re-think their staff, as well as their menu. Focusing on at least putting out good coffee would really be a step-up.\n\nP.S. they print out negative Yelp reviews and tape them to the back of the bathroom door for you to read while using the facilities. So, I'm sure this will be on there at some point. Hi everyone!", "author": "Ally H."}

It's easy to spot the owner's love for comics and monsters with a rendering of Godzilla in downtown NY on the roof of the entrance. There's a book shelf filled with classics donated by the owner, and you can even do a book swap if you're feeling nostalgic.\n\nWhat really did it for me was that this was something unique that you could probably only find in SF. The chicken noodle soup was home-made and outstandingly soulful. Loved every sip of it. If I had space in my belly, I would have ordered a few more helpings. Actually, thinking about it right now, I'm missing it already. \n\nThe service was super friendly and immediately made us feel like we were at home.

It always felt comfortable to just sit within this cafe, sipping away at a cup of coffee. There would be other people chatting, reading, on their laptops, and some high school students helping each other out with what I presumed to be SAT prep. It's just like any other cafe, but with a nice vintage look. There's an old TV set in one corner, some record players lying around, a bookshelf of old books, some old artsy photographs of the city, some board games, etc. I just love the feel of this place as it makes me feel calm and as if in a different time. And before I get lost in all this atmosphere talk, the coffee is great too! :D", "author": "Joshua M."}

Just this last month I have gone in 3 times.  Each time I was treated incredibly rude by the staff.  Today I ordered a tea and tried to pay with my credit card, the only way in which I could pay! Instead of understanding and being kind, they treated me like I was a criminal and I was aggressivley and rudely told to leave by a man from the kitchen who freaked me out a bit and caused a little scene as I tried to finish out a time sensative task I had started before leaving.  Gallery Cafe is the only 'Cash Only' Coffee Shop/Cafe I know of in North Beach and to make a customer feel bad because of their probable tax fraud is plain and simple - not right.

Good for two people, but it just feel very homey when you go alone. \n\nThe tea selection isn't huge, but you don't need it, the coffee is great as well. The food here is pretty good for cafe! It can get noisy because of the Cable Car, but it's part of the San Francisco experience right? \n\nI would come here again and again, just to do a bit of light reading.

There went over $10 down the drain as the breakfasts here are overpriced (about $8 for the lox bagel sandwich and about $5 for an oatmeal).

It's a comfy spot to hang out with a friend, read a book, work on the laptop, or just watch the tourist go by on the Cable Car.\r\n\r\nThe coffee and pastries are a bit sub-par for people like me who are used to the conglomerate tastes of Starbucks, Peet's, or Coffee Bean.

My roommate and I would meet our friend to do our laundry at the Fashion Laundromat (best name for a laundromat EVER) and while we were waiting for our clothes to dry we would drink way too much coffee.  Then, I got a job there.  And I loved it even more.  This is a place that takes its coffee seriously.  When I later worked at La Boulange on Union street  I was appalled by their espresso crafting.  At gallery, they gave me a series of videos on how to make espresso drinks.  Videos.  Like I was supposed to go home and study how to make the perfect cappucino.  Like I said, very serious.  And you can definitely taste the difference.\nThe actual space is really lovely.  I love the big windows, the sun reflecting off the honey colored tables, the (usually) really cool art on the walls.  Also, it's a good place to get a beer at happy hour.  If I remember correctly they have some sort of two for one deal.  \nI was so sad when I moved away.  The coffee at Gallery is so good it pretty much ruined me.  Since then, no other coffee has compared.  It's some special coffee that they only serve at like the French Embassy or something.  \nThe only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because it's no longer a block away from my house.", "author": "melissa r."}

My friend told me that if I was in need of a wifi connection, I should check this place out.  At first I went there for a cup of coffee for breakfast, but having been in this city for a little under 2 weeks, I have been going there at least once a day.  My favorite has been sitting down to one of their books (they have reading material ranging from books, magazines to the newspaper for cafe dwellers) and enjoying my fare.  They have plenty of seating available, with tables, benches and couches.  A great spot to relax with a cup of coffee/tea and your laptop!", "author": "Aishah I."}

This cool little cafe is nestled in between the honking cars and busy establishments, offering a little bit of Europe.  In search of coffee one Saturday morning during a weekend overnight in the city, my husband refused to go to Starbucks.  So in search of something more ambiance and less mainstream, we saw the open door and heard music coming from the Gallery Cafe.  The owner couldn't have been more personal, the coffee hit the mark, and the surroundings brought us back to wonderful memories of Europe.  We'll be back!", "author": "Mary R."}
