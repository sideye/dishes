I've been wanting to try Atelier Crenn for the past few years but my trips to San Francisco were always so last minute that reservations were always long gone. The service was top notch and the people were fun and not stuffy which could be typical of some fine dining establishments.  We were given an original poem at the beginning of the meal and it became a fun game between my wife and I trying to guess what the next dish would be in relation to the poem.\n\nDominique Crenn is truly a master magician in the kitchen. My wife and I aren't meat eaters much and were ecstatic to find out that she leaned heavily on seafood and vegetable for her ingredients.\n\nEverything was visually spectacular and of course the mixture of ingredients were paired perfectly together to create a mouthwatering dish. It was a show and artwork at its finest!  Some of the most memorable dishes of the night were: Geoduck Sea urchin & stone fruit; Prawn seaweed and whey; Reserve white sturgeon & koji; Abalone, cabbage & smoked creme; and the Coconut & Pineapple for dessert.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we were given a nice card and menu wishing us a Happy Anniversary and were sent away with some delicious chocolate covered rice puffs.\n\nEverything about Atelier Crenn is amazing and it deserves all the accolades and recognition from the so called experts as one of the best restaurants in the world!", "author": "Johnny N."}

This one did not disappoint.  (How is Crenn rated the same as Benu???  Not even close!)\n\nGranted this is a very expensive restaurant. French Laundry is about the same and if you like to pay for experiences and appreciate excellent food and service, then this is why the restaurant is good for you.  \n\nA+ for substitutions: I am lactose intolerant.  I expect a Michelin restaurant and any chef worth her/his cred to be able to make substitutions and not make me feel like I am missing out or bothering them.  Crenn did a great job with this--among the best of my experiences.  For example, with the cheese/fruit course my husband had a soft cheese with figs; I had figs with a cured Wagyu beef.  He was the jealous one!  In general, the complexity of each dish, the balance of flavors and textures, was so lovely that if a cream sauce was left off it did not affect the overall taste significantly.  I understood why it might add but not having it didn't subtract.  The DESSERT chef, who has been with Crenn from the start, was also excellent.  The main dessert for all in the house that night was coconut milk based. It and all the other desserts were also complex, interesting, tasty. \n\nThe main meal: In total, we left feeling like every dish offered us a nice surprise, something we had not seen before and something worth contemplating. \n\nOften if a \"trick\" or flavor is repeated at restaurants like this I am left feeling like \"it was good the first time but let's get something new, shall we?\"  At Crenn what was repeated was smokey flavors/smells and seafood in general. Now I like both of those things a lot; if you don't, then you might not choose Crenn--maybe French Laundry instead. Crenn is using the entire fish in many cases, which is responsible and interesting.  So this means we get a broth made from shrimp as well as the actual shrimp in another dish.  I found it interesting to see the subtle ways the tastes changed depending upon which parts were used and how she mixed them. There were also 2 broths on the menu--one early and one late--which I thought at first was too much repeat but then realized that the broths were also slowing us down and making us savor both the food and the time/experience. And the balance of textures and flavors in every single dish was truly masterful. \n\nBathroom rating (because such things matter) A+  It has BRIGHT LIGHT over a mirror for people who actually want to see how they look; clean + stylish with terry towels; if you need to wait, or just want to see, there is a viewing window of the kitchen nearby. \n\nParking: we went on a Saturday night for a 5:15 reservation.  All kinds of parking!!  Hooray!\n\nService: A+  You pay the 20% up front.  The water is always full and the service is top notch.  When we asked questions about a particular part of one dish the waiter took us back into the kitchen to see the setup.  FUN.  And the kitchen is tiny and there are like 1,000 people working in it. They all greeted us with a cheery \"welcome\" and \"good night\" in French as we came and went. \n\nIf you do the math about how much they gross a night and how many employees they have, it is clear that they are not making all that much money despite the hefty price tag.  It costs to rent in SF, to hire this many people, and to buy top quality food.  Can you get a good meal for less?  Of course.  With Crenn you choose to pay for not merely good but for artistry in the food, and for the staff which treats you like, well, like you paid a lot for your dinner.", "author": "s t."}

Maybe a 4.5 but I will give it a 5 for the willingness of all the staff to provide an unforgettable experience. \n\nI love meals made of lots of \"bites\" and small plates, allowing me to experience new flavors, the chef's adventurous mindset, and textures. This is what Atelier Crenn is about, with a bit of theatrics mixed in.\n\nMy favorites dishes?\n\nBillowing dry ice producing fog -- when the fog subsides, you discover tiny tarts filled with sliced clams arranged like flower petals, and butter-poached uni. \n\nRoom captain crushing grains and seeds, pumpkin , sunflower seeds and buckwheat, in a white mortar,  spooned over a gelee made from black truffle juice -- mixed together in a delicious melange.\n\nFake coconut shell made of chocolate, with sapote icecream mixed witg lime flavors -- difficult to describe but a dessert to remember.\n\nWhile I was afraid of a slow, a-little-bit-boring meal based on some reviews, time actually flied and (too) soon I was offered the check for the wine I ordered ... maybe the least satisfying aspect of the Atelier Creen experience is the \"pre-paid ticket\" concept that spoils a little bit the joy of reserving the restaurant, and makes for a weird ending to an otherwise perfectly orchestrated experience.", "author": "Benjamin K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-23", "description": "This place is definitely hard to rate... I think a solid 4.5 but I will round up to a 5! The restaurant is absolutely amazing in terms of creativity, presentation, uniqueness, artistry, and the like... it makes you feel like you are really experiencing something very special! The menu come in the form of a poem so you will have a great time trying to guess what the next course will be. There were multiple courses (around 14 ish) and each course was a perfectly sized bite or taste of something delicious. I think there was much more gastronomy here than it other restaurants in sf (reminds me of my experience at guy savoy.) \n\nHowever, a couple of things prevents me from giving this place a solid 5 Star. This place was by far the most creative place I have been in sf but, compared to my experience at Coi, I don't think the flavors of any of the dishes were like WOAH! To be fair, between Coi and here, this place was more consistently good whereas Coi has hit or miss dishes. However, where Coi hit it really hit. Not sure what it is about this place but in every dish a particular flavor or texture prevented the ingredients from reaching their full potential (for example the crunchiness and flavor of the pastry tart and strong flavor of the Stone fruit of the uni geoduck tart prevented the uni flavor from really shining through.) Thus, I would probably say these places end up being around equal overall.\n\nAnother thing is my bf has dietary restrictions which I mentioned when making the reservation. While the restaurant called to check what foods are ok and what are not, we still ended up being served a dish with an ingredient on his no eat list. That was a bit unfortunate and the restaurant was extremely apologetic... even going so far as to making other dishes extra special which I greatly appreciate. However, this experience was different from when I told Coi about my bf's restriction and they had prepare totally different entrees and dishes ahead of time to accommodate. \n\nAll in all, I think this is a must try in sf and I would rate it above Coi because of its creativity. However, I think there is room to grow!!", "author": "Jocelyn K."}

Smaller than the first Pujol. Nothing wrong with that though. Then we noticed how terrible the playlist was, which seemed to have been picked by a 13 year old girl with bad music taste. Katy Perry style and such. Not even kidding.\n\nThen the food came.  And NOTHING WAS MEMORABLE. The lack of protein in the courses was insulting to me, and believe me I've been to a ton of 3,2,1 Michelin stared restaurants, but this was insane. It has been the most unecessarily acidic meal of my life as well as disappointing. I felt like I went on a kombucha cleanse that cost a premium of $700+. I can count with one hand the number of times I have left food on a plate since I was a little kid and I did it 3 times during this \"meal\".\n\nI am a business man and I understand that stories sell products but this was a joke. All romance and no substance. Chicken tea? It was a mediocre chicken consome whipped by the servers. The only decent part of the meal were the deserts which were nothing out of the ordinary and they didn't seem to fit in the menu theme at all. \n\nIt is a shame she is supposed to be the best female chef in the world. There are WAY BETTER ONES out there already and they might have just enrolled into college...\n\nAlso their way of up-selling came of as tasteless, annoying and we were asked multiple times if we wanted the truffles, premium caviar or champagne after we said no.\n\nI don't understand how people give this restaurant more than 3 stars at max. Go to the doctor and get your taste buds checked. Servers must be rating or something...what a waste of $ and time.  \n\nSAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO BENU. Best meal of my life so far.

This place is truly special - there's a lot of love, whimsy and nostalgia in the food which is served in a very warm, modern yet elegant setting.  For me, the best way to describe my experience is that every dish made me smile.  \n\nThe Michelin guide describes three stars as \"A restaurant worth a special journey, indicating exceptional cuisine where diners eat extremely well, often superbly. Distinctive dishes are precisely executed, using superlative ingredients.\"  I think this perfectly describes Atelier Crenn.  \n\nA fabulous French meal always starts with a glass of champagne!!!  Each dish is fantastic but the ones that stood out for me are the Kir Breton, the caviar (golden osetra), the abalone, the brioche (wagyu butter is crazy delicious), the matcha tea and the main dessert (young coconut and pineapple encrusted in chocolate shaped like a coconut shell).  I also really enjoyed the non-alcoholic beverage pairing. \n\nI don't understand why this place only has two Michelin stars but I would put this restaurant up against any place else in the world.  As a San Franciscan, I felt very at home here. I can't wait to visit again. Highly recommended!!!", "author": "Andrew S."}

She's breaking barriers as a world-renowned female chef while being a mother, and she's incredibly down-to-earth and personable!\n\nChef Crenn's avant garde style is often described as whimsical. With this type of creativity, sometimes it clicks and sometimes it doesn't. While my first experience three years ago was absolutely lovely visually, the flavors just didn't wow that day. My second visit, in contrast, left me in awe at how much I enjoyed every dish!\n\nThe seafood-only menu was so varied and complex, that I didn't miss the lack of a hefty land-animal course. The tableside preparation was especially outstanding, perhaps the best I've experienced.\n\nService was wonderful, approachable, and warm - a good description for the interior as well. I loved the wood tables and soft rugs, and the new layout with less tables felt more intimate. The timing was good, and though it was slower between a few courses, it felt appropriately leisurely. We opted for a couple bottles in lieu of the full pairing, and I enjoyed the two whites they picked for us within our price range.\n\nSome highlights:\n\nGeoduck - The layers of geoduck were woven like a rose, with citrus nestled among the layers. The server finished it off with a dollop of cr\u00e8me fraiche. This tiny tart was a flavor bomb, with a rich ham-like taste.\n\nSeeds & Grains - This was a marvelous study of texture, with intricate tableside presentation. The server started by crushing pumpkin, sunflower, and buckwheat seeds with a sphere. He added a mixture of fermented squash and truffle, then added liquid from three vials - two oils and duck fat. This was poured into bowl containing trout roe and finished off with flowers and leaves.\n\nThe resulting mixture was so enjoyable to eat! There was nice pop from the trout roe, crunch from the seeds, creaminess from the duck fat, and the bold flavors of salty, tangy, sour, sweet. Just magical.\n\nBrioche - I've come to expect a high quality bread course in Western tasting menus, and the brioche here was excellent. Intensely buttery and soft, accompanied by cultured house butter and whipped wagyu fat (yes, it was as amazing as it sounds).\n\nBass -  The striped bass was perfectly tender and wonderful, but the two tiny chanterelles stole this show. I love mushrooms, and these two were perhaps the best tasting mushrooms I've ever had! So simple, yet so rich with umami and plenty of butter.\n\nMatcha Tea Service - They use chicken bouillon instead of water. The chicken and matcha combination was like a strange symphony that absolutely worked.\n\nI'm so glad I revisited Atelier Crenn! I also loved that I didn't feel like a stuffed pig afterwards, and I wasn't hungry either. This may have been the first tasting menu that was actually the right volume for me.\n\nWith this meal, Atelier Crenn has jumped into my top three favorite spots in the Bay Area, and I look forward to a return visit.", "author": "Adrienne H."}

From the poetic menu to the beautifully executed dishes to all of the special little touches, this was a dining experience that you have to see for yourself!\n\nWe had the New Year's Tasting Menu, and many of the dishes are unique to this menu.  The menu comes in the form of a poem, where each line describes a dish (you can try to guess the next dish).  Each dish was explained and presented to us.  The plating of each dish was very unique!  There were different cutlery for mostly every dish, and each one was so beautiful!\n\nEverything was delicious and I don't want to spoil the experience, but I do want to note some favorite dishes from this night.  I particularly enjoyed the brioche and house made butter.  The brioche was so warm, light, and fluffy.  The truffle pasta dish was also delicious and creamy.  Their truffles were very fragrant.  Also, BEST ABALONE I'VE EVER HAD.  A lot of the dishes had interesting concepts, such as the matcha tea service.  I wouldn't have ever imagined the creations on this menu, and that's part of what makes them so intriguing.\n\nThe sommelier introduced us to a bottle of 1993 Romanee-St-Vivant, and it was quite delightful.  I'm not hugely into wine, but some of the guests I was dining with definitely are, and we enjoyed the recommended selection and care put into serving the wines.  The wide-bodied glass was perfect!  Quite on the hefty side of price tags, but well worth it.\n\nChef Crenn stopped by our table to greet us and took a photo with us at the end of our dinner.  It was a pleasure to be able to meet her.

My SO made the reservations over a month in advance after looking for a place to celebrate our last week in the Bay Area, and this was honestly the most amazing place for our celebration meal. On top of the deliciously artful food, we also got to meet Chef Crenn and Chef Contreras! (After seeing them on Chef's Table, it was like meeting celebrities. You can tell they truly care both about the food and your experience here.)\n\nThe staff and service here are impeccable. Every detail was refined and explained in the most beautiful way. Each dish comes with its own utensils which add to the beauty and art of each dish. Furthermore, it seems that different staff members explain each dish, and it was done amazingly; not only did they talk about the food but also the inspiration for each. Furthermore, the staff pay a lot of attention to serving. They paced it very well so we didn't feel rushed but the food came out just as we were ready between courses. Furthermore, I took a trip to the restroom which I noticed they accounted for in serving our next dish. The beauty of this restaurant is also amazing. It is classy and elegant (though it's hard to notice from the outside). I loved the lights and the feel of the restaurant itself, the perfect backdrop for Chef Crenn's art.\n\nThe meal itself comes as a surprise (unless you read spoilers). The menu is a poem, and every line is a different dish that is beautifully plated and delectable. It's fun to try and guess what the next dish will be! We actually came in reading reviews stating how the dishes are all one-bite or too weird, but we didn't find this to be true (for us). The portions were perfectly sized (we definitely took more than 1 or 2 bites) and we finished the meal being content but not too full. As for the weirdness, we happen to love all the strong and unique flavors, and can't begin to explain the symphony of tastes throughout the meal. It is to note that the items here are more experimental but this is what made the experience so special. \n\nThis was our first 2 Michelin star locale and it did not disappoint. Everything was absolutely amazing and the experience was the best meal I've had so far. Yes, Atelier Crenn is more on the pricey end, but every bite was worth it. Luckily, we don't drink which made it more affordable for us; there was also a special item that you have to pay extra for, but you're already there so I recommend trying it!\n\nAll in all, this experience was like no other. I'm ecstatic that this meal was my last hurrah for the last 6 years in the Bay Area, and I can't wait for the next chance to try Chef Crenn and Chef Contreras' food.\n\n*Please note that if you want to avoid any spoilers, don't look at my photos.", "author": "Mimi T."}

I have eaten at many Michelin starred restaurants around the world and when comparing this one to many other two star restaurants it came up a bit short for me in two fronts, value for money and service quality. \n\nThe restaurant is quite small and cosy. Loved the interiors and set up, however, it was also a bit loud and noisy and I had to strain to hear my friend speak. There are plenty of staff about and they were all very friendly and nice. I had very high hopes having cancelled a booking at Saison to come here as I like what Dominique Crenn stands for. \n\nThe menu was quite creative and some of the dishes were very creative. I was however disappointed with the Wagyu as the sour japanese flavour did not go with the meat. Also some of the wine pairing did not work at all. The corn dish with truffle was a bit too much corn for me and we also advised the wait staff of that. The sea urchin was amazing as was the caviar dish. The brioche with wagyu butter was simply out of this world. \n\nThe dessert courses were unfortunately disappointing for me except the petit fours which were to die for. The Mayan desert angle simply did not do it for me. The avocado with white chocolate was tasteless and the corn with chocolate was quite nice but nothing special.\n\nThe fact that one of the wines served during the wine flight was corked should never happen in restaurants of such caliber and that, another wine was poured with cork in the glass was also not something that should happen. \n\nFor what you pay here, I would have to question if I would come back here.

A month ago, I tried The French Laundry, the restaurant that I had been dreaming about for a few years. I am certain that the awful experience was not due to the high expectation. It was simply not worth either the travel or the money. The food was either too salty or too sweet which made me lose all the interest in French food for a while. Atelier Crenn is supposed to be my second and last shot this year. I watched the episode of Chef's Table before I went in last night. It reminds me of the movie Ratatouille.   \n\nI like how the menu was presented (through lines of a poem). I did not find it boring to try to relate the food served with each specific line. The staff gave very good introduction of each course and I received a menu with more description about the ingredients in the end. The poem made the experience more than enjoying the food. It was more about stories and memories. \n\nDominique put a lot of efforts in the selection of containers and the presentation of the food, which may be a unique quality of a female chef. Half of the courses were partially made on the table. I felt somewhat involved in the cooking process and that was something I really enjoyed.\n\nThe staff made it very clear at the beginning that Dominique opened this restaurant in memory of her father. You can see her father's paintings of Brittany, France on the walls. I thought about my parents for a little bit. The menu is significantly inspired by her memories of Brittany and her family. I had the warm feelings that I never had at any other michelin rated restaurants. Again, it is not only about food.\n\nThe food combination was very simple and gave a light taste and texture. My favourite was the English peas. I never thought my favourite would be something that simple. What I loved was the freshness of it. The freshness that you can only get on a 5am morning at a Yountville orchard. The cocnut and pineapple sorbet blew all of us away. My friend fell in love with the Chef Patissier aftet finishing this dessert. You can tell he went through trails and errors to find the perfect propertion of each ingredient and it takes him a lot of labor to prepare. Again, neither the restaurant nor the food is fancy. It's about getting the foundemental beauty out of the simplest ingredients. It's not the French Laundry, but if I could, I would get one star from that restaurant and give it to Atelier Grenn. \n\nI do not feel obligated to give such a good review because I spent $500 here (as a person stated in a previous review). I spent more in the French Laundry but I regreted it so much. I am not giving this review only because Dominique Crenn is such a talented and sweet chef who became the first female to get 2-star rating in the States. It just simply rocked me to my core. If a fancy and luxurious setting, a mind-blowing service that makes you feel like the king of the universe are what you are looking for from a Michelin-rated restaurant, this place is not for you. But if you just want to sit down and enjoy great food, and to appreciate the creativity and memories of love presented by the chefs through their superb cooking, give it a try and you will not regret it.", "author": "Ruby H."}

I also should mention my friend and I fangirl-ed hard when we shook Dominique's hand when she went around greeting all the guests! She's such a sweetheart and I really admire her work.\n\nThe experience was fantastic and the food was all delicious. Although, to be honest, I was slightly disappointed in my meal... I probably set the bar too high after watching Chef's Table and looking through old Instagram posts of her beautiful, earthy-looking dishes. \n\nThe server explained each dish and emphasized that the chef makes whatever is currently inspiring her. It just so happened she recently traveled to southeast asia, so she used a lot of asian influence on her dishes.... she curated dishes featuring wagyu beef, uni, etc... so I felt like that wasn't exceptional. I was expecting French food and her delicate dishes that was portrayed on Chef's Table. Man! Expectations ruin everything. Her signature starter dish was great though.\n\nAlso, the desserts had an interesting Mexican cultural theme.. yes, it was unique, but I still was looking forward to the nature-inspired dishes. So that was a bit of a let down. \n\nIt was a spectacular dining experience with no pretentious atmosphere at all. I love the artistic and well-though out dishes.

I've been fortunate enough to dine at several three stars and based on my experience the food at AC was as good, if not better than several of them. The service was top notch and the food was as beautiful as it was delicious. If I had to compare AC to another restaurant I've dined at it would have to be Alinea in Chicago but AC had it's own unique style, story and twist that shined through in each fabulous course.  \n\nI won't go through each dish as the menu is seasonal and changes constantly so your menu will most likely differ from mine. That said, I imagine your experience will nonetheless be as ethereal as mine. From start to finish, the meal here really is choreographed to perfection. \n\nYes, it is pricey but when you're 90 years old, this will be one of those meals you look back on and remember fondly as an 'experience' not just a meal.

I came in again 2/12/18 for a special 4-hands dinner with Julien Royer of Odette. Everything was to the standard of the last dinner foodwise until the seabass course, which was changed to a sizeable portion of a filet compared to the roll they had prepared the first time. Unlike the flaky well-prepared fish I had last time, I was served an undercooked filet that was even difficult to cut through.\n\nNext the duck which was dry aged 21 days via hay stuffed in the duck. Unfortunately this came out very dry and when the staff was notified that it was, I was explained that it was due to the dry aging process. I have had dry-aged duck previously at other establishments (some that were aged even longer!) and didn't experience any dryness close to the extent I experienced here.\n\nOtherwise, I did enjoy the rest of the meal else and put into consideration that it was the first service of this special dinner.", "author": "Chad S."}

Like everyone said, the restaurant is very unassuming (no sign above, just at the door). \n\nThe food was amazing, and we truly enjoyed this meal. I've been to The French Laundry and liked this a lot more, especially how creative Chef Crenn was. She also came out to greet every table which was so sweet. (I realize I'm saying what other reviews said). The food was good, I will say, there was a lot more seafood than even I was expecting (I thought it was going to be a little more vegetable heavy). You definitely have to like seafood here. Every dish was good, but one of the dessert dishes was my absolute favorite- it was a coconut mousse in an edible coconut (the brown outside was milk chocolate), with a herb sorbet and pineapple. Probably one of the best dishes I've ever had. Additionally, the brioche was honestly amazing. Really enjoyed the restaurant, and the atmosphere (service was perfect- didn't feel rushed, but it felt attentive. Also the contemporary music / atmosphere was really nice).

We need to support women and need more female chefs! So I'm sad that her food creations disappointed me. \nI think most yelp reviewers feel obligated to leave a good review to feel better for paying so much at this place or they have simply not dined at other restaurants in that price range. \n\n\nWhy I disliked my experience:\n- the food combinations did not go well together. They sound and look good, but don't taste well. It was the first time I threw up after a fine-dining experience in particular it was her fish egg dish that had some weird combinations on and made me throw up the next morning. \n\n- the place was SO loud. Not intimate and romantic at all. If you want a romantic atmosphere do not book. \n\n- I thought the poetry thing that she does where she doesn't put the menu on the table but poems and as a riddle you have to try to make sense of it, was boring. I just wanted to know the dishes I was expecting, the poems thing was pretentious and it wasn't even witty. Nothing related to the food. \n\n- there's no soothing music, just loud voices in the background, tables are too close. \n\n- though it was our anniversary unlike in other restaurants, we got no \"happy anniversary\" greeting, no candle \n\n- nothing blew me away, I rather blew up from the food. \n\n- considering the price range, it was definitely not worth it.

I like how everyone had their own sever for each course and they explained to you what you where eating. It's pretty pricey I think it was about $700 when the bf and I went for his birthday dinner. \n\nIt's a bit awkward when you get here too early for your reservation because they do not open the door until it's actually the reservation time.  I like the interior it was very minimal and modern. I love the poem they give you as your menu and each line is the one course. From all the courses I loved the red seaweed with popcorn crunchies on top, the bread with the seaweed butter, the duck and the all the desserts. When we went it was the desserts I believe the sobert and the butterflies. The bf love loved the bread and still talks about it to this day. We did not like though the sea urchin or the mushroom soup both were not anything we would eat again. \n\nDefinitely is not a place to fill full like a big thanksgiving meal. You have to remember this is a tasting experience so its all small portions of delicious creations. I love that you get a take home of homemade nougat for the next day. That was also really good. Dominique Crenn was there too and she walked around greeting everyone so I thought that was pretty special. \n\nOverall great experience it is pricey but for me it was worth it.

The severs easily accommodated my dietary restrictions (no red meat or pork) with an extra seafood dish. I'm otherwise not picky about what I eat, so the poetry menu, admittedly a tad silly, left ample time to speculate about courses to come over the excellent wine pairings.

We talked and shared what we thought of the overall experience and we both equally had similar views and thoughts on what word best describes our meal. We agreed that the word \"wow\" best describes it! \n\nI've been looking forward to eating my birthday dinner here and made reservations on \"Resy\" 3 months ago from the Atelier Crenn website. \n\nThe restaurant itself to be described is small, clean, simple and the service from checkin to checkout was on point for the most part. I had a small welcome envelope with a note on our table thanking me for celebrating my birthday with Crenn's team! A very nice welcoming touch IMO. We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation and they did mention that our meal would start at exactly 6 which was the time we reserved for.\n\nAtelier Crenn is whimsical, artsy, and carefully thought through and it shows in each course. Every bite was delightful and delicious! From the first welcome bite of \"Kir Bretton\" that pops and surprises you with a wow of cider in your mouth to the last bite of chocolate at the end of the meal that is presented in a sentimental box with a message dedicated to Chef Crenn's papa. Although we didn't meet Chef Crenn, we felt like she was there sharing pieces of her personal journey and life with us.\n\nMost of the courses are around seafood, most wine pairings were white as it pairs best with. Each wine pairing was a great match to each bite/course it was paired with. Our main entree was Japanese Wagyu Beef and it didn't disappoint. Each course was divinely plated and presented.\n\nBefore dining, as a fellow yelper, of course I Yelped! I had read through a few of the latest Yelp reviews regarding a \"surprise tab/bill\" at the end but that didn't happen to us. The supplements were all mentioned and all came with a price tag. It just wasn't written anywhere. We have dined at French Laundry and the supplement charges were visible on the menu in a smaller font and is sometimes easily missed as well. At Atelier Crenn, it's not written anywhere but is verbally communicated and when you are out dining with company, it could have been easily missed as well. We were not surprised at the end and did upgrade with a supplement of a cheese course following our main entree dish to kick start our dessert meal.\n\nThe main reason for the 4 vs 5 star is mainly due to the wine pairing. We opted to split the $175 Grand Wine Pairing at the start of our meal (split 2 glasses +$50 supplement) but ended up having to share the pairing out of one glass.

In fact, she is at Atelier Crenn on most nights to personally get to know each patron and share a little bit about herself! From the artistic forest-themed interior decoration to the over-the-top presentation of the courses, Chef Crenn's obsession with her work really shines.\n\nThe menu comes in the form of a 15-line poem that tells the story of an excursion through the forest. Each line corresponds to a dish that highlights a short segment in this journey. The presentations are so original, intricate, and delicious that every bite will make you crave for more!\n\nI will note, however, that the portions served are quite small - even for fine dining.

From what I've heard from friends that have been here, and from my experience, Chef Crenn often makes trips out to the dining room to say hello to the customers. She shakes everyone's hand and welcomes them into the restaurant, asking them questions about where they're from or if they're enjoying the meal. This has been going on at least a few years.\n\nHalf of the staff that served us was very friendly and talkative, and half were stoic, but the service was always worthy of 2 Michelin stars. \n\nOur bill was more than expected, so we asked and turns out they charged us for two wine pairings instead of the one. All in all, it was a little under $1k for two meals, 2 glasses of champagne, 1 pineapple mint soda, and 1 grand wine pairing. Tip included. They didn't offer to comp us anything for the error in billing, which was sort of surprising, as it would have been a costly mistake had we not caught it.\n\nThe food itself was inventive but not filling. There was only one dish with a significant meat presence and it contained 3 small slivers of dry aged duck. Be prepared to be amazed by the 18 presentations, but not necessarily full if you're a big boy. My man needed a slice of pizza from the fridge when we got home, but I was perfectly full. I liked the idea of the menu that was a poem, but we needed to recalibrate and ask the staff every now and then which verse of the poem we were on.\n\nHighlights were the seaweed dusted in popcorn; roe with basil flavored jelly and avocado; cold melon soup (veloute poured tableside); the abalone and artichoke with truffle bacon sauce (I mean, with that sauce, how can you lose?); the palate cleanser of a minty mousse dipped in liquid nitrogen tableside to create a sorbet served on a eucalyptus leaf; and a buckwheat tart with cheese, fig and truffles.", "author": "Christina G."}

My wife and I have been to a number of Michelin star restaurants, but our experience here was among the best. Sitting in the dining room felt like sitting in a stylish, but comfortable dining room of a friend's house. The waitstaff were exceptional, combining service and attentiveness with a friendly and welcoming attitude. The food was awesome! I don't have any good way to describe the incredibly creative and delicious dishes that were served. Finally, after dinner, we were offered the opportunity to receive a tour of the kitchen. Despite being in the middle of service, the kitchen staff were wonderfully friendly and welcoming, and even took the time to take a \"family photo\" where a number of the kitchen staff gathered around to take a photo with us.

Boyfie made reservations for our \"I-love-you-versary\" last month. Yes, we find an excuse to celebrate every little thing year round :P\n\nWhen we arrived, we were a bit early so we sat at the entrance waiting for our table to be ready. Dominique Crenn walked over to us and introduced herself. She let us know that our table would be ready soon and offered us drinks to order while we waited. She was warm and friendly and seemed to genuinely care about everyone walking into her restaurant. Amazing.\n\nThe food was incredible. The presentation was so beautiful. The boyfie and I had fun trying to guess the next dish by the poem. Of course, we failed 90% of the time. MMMMM! I had the best abalone I've ever had in my life here! I just wish the wines that came with the wine pairing actually complimented our food... our sommelier appeared a bit junior and his explantation for each were too vague. I don't recommend the wine pairing. Go for a nice bottle of wine instead.\n\nAll in all, it was one of the best dining experiences of my life (food wise). Just wish the wine pairing lived up to it's price... :P \n\nP.S.

I was salivating throughout the entire \"Chef's Table\" episode about Atelier Crenn. I had been to Petit Crenn before and to be quite frank, I was not at all impressed. But the sophistication, care, and thought put into each course at Atelier Crenn takes it to a whole other level.\n\nWe got an earlier reservation on a weeknight and met up right after work. It was early in the week and we did not feel like drinking alcohol. I'll warn you about the $$$$ now; it was $325 per person with no drinks.\n\nWas it worth it? That's always a difficult question to answer. I struggle with the idea that any meal (by looking at the ingredients and portion size) could be \"worth\" more than $150. When we look at a meal as an experience and each course as a scene, then yes, Atelier Crenn put up a strong performance.\n\nI love the surprise factor since you have no idea what you're going to be eating. The poetic menu is fun yet it means absolutely nothing to you unless you are Dominique Crenn. The meal was creative and each presentation was beautiful. They were tiny, however, and somehow my friend thought that it was going to be a lot of food. The only reason we were full was because of the loaf of bread that was served halfway through the meal. Not only was the bread filling, it was also very tasty. I do wish there would've been more protein throughout but I'm no chef and I trust that this was contemplated.", "author": "Yi Z."}

And my conclusion is I really did like this place!\n\nI love that when you first walk up you don't think much of the outside interior, it looks like any other storefront/hole-in-the-wall kind of place but once i stepped inside i felt nostalgia looking at the small paintings of little houses in some meadow in Italy probably. Service was amazing and enriched our dining experience.\n\nEverything was prepared beautifully and most of the dishes completely surprised me. I thought that it would taste one way or have a certain texture but they would be completely different! For example, there was an olive course  and when i put the olive in my mouth i was pleasantly surprised that it was sweet and had a lighter (like sorbet) texture than an olive.\n\nExtremely pricey. It is not four dollar signs for nothing. I think our bill came out to around $800 for two plus added cheese course and two glasses of wine.\n\nOh and they give you goodbai granola + the actual menu (with dishes, not poem) in beautiful card/stationery as a souvenir.\n\nWould I return?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-27", "description": "Atelier Crenn exudes with personality, uniqueness, and profound masterpiece.  \n\nThis may be the best dining EXPERIENCE you will ever have in your life.  If you are lucky enough to go during a time when Chef Crenn is in house, this will undoubtedly be an unforgettable dining experience.\n\nOur dinner was one filled with poetic wonder, savory delight, visual surprises, and amazing flavors we never knew existed.  \"Taking food to the next level,\" \"Food is art,\" and \"passionate about food\" might sound clich\u00e9 and certainly doesn't do justice for this establishment because the imagination, creativity, and thought behind the experience at Atelier Crenn goes high and far beyond words.  Don't read further if you want to save some of the magic for you to experience yourself...aka \"spoilers ahead.\"\n\nMy now-husband and I were planning our mini-moon for the week after our wedding and knowing what a super foodie I was, my hubby suggested a trip to Napa which would include French Laundry of course.  LUCKY for us, French Laundry was under construction, so I had to pick another \"substitute.\"  And so begins the serendipitous introduction to Chef Dominique Crenn's workshop, little in its physical size, but monumental in every other aspect.\n\nA week before, I had come across Chef's Table on Netflix and lo and behold, season 2, episode 3 featured Dominique Crenn. How opportune?!  My  then-fianc\u00e9e and I watched the documentary together and I was enamored by the emotions, love, and personal aspects behind the restaurant  and how sentimental Chef Crenn was.  My fianc\u00e9e commented, she sounds like you when you talk about food...it's not just food.  My expectations were skyrocketing.  My fianc\u00e9e speculated, the higher your expectations, the more likely you'll be disappointed.  It's now clear, Chef Crenn surpassed all expectations.\n\nQuietly tucked away in downtown San Francisco, you might walk right past the restaurant if you don't look for it closely.  Once you walk in, you are treated like royalty, but not in a cold, impersonal, black-tie affair-like kind of way.  You are immediately greeted with warmth and style and soon presented with a poem.  Her menu is presented in beautiful poetry.  The walls are decorated with lines that are equally poetic.  The service is impeccable (3 michelin star quality).  The servers are extremely accommodating and engaging.  It almost felt like they were trying to get to know their diners on a more personal level and not just there to serve you a delicious dinner.  Briefly, the food is heavenly, a triumphantly presented masterpiece.\n\nMy husband asked if Chef Crenn was around, not expecting at all that she would be, and we were told she had just left to visit Petit Crenn (her sister restaurant).  I quickly thought, what a nice Chef to visit her smaller, less expensive restaurants too!  Midway into our poetic journey, I spotted none other than the Chef herself...making her \"rounds.\"  The Netflix documentary was not an exaggeration, it was not a dramatized hyperbole; Chef Crenn really does try to get to know her patrons.  When she arrived at our table, we chatted about our recent wedding and current trip to Napa and then to my pleasant astonishment, she voluntarily offered to show us her kitchen.  What?!   Needless to say the food was phenomenal and part of dessert was presented in a wooden box inscribed with a long letter to her father, from which lines were taken and placed on the wall.  What a great way to end and tie together the experience.  \n\nAs promised, Chef Crenn gave us a tour of her workshop and further amused us with a photograph.  (Note, the experience would have been perfect even without a tour and a picture, but I'm sure that helped me write this emmensely long review).  She explained that the decor of the restaurant had elements of a bird's nest to symbolize birth and the creation of new things.\n\nIf I had to make a criticism, I would have to point to the unisex bathroom.  Like I mentioned before, the restaurant is small and there is only one bathroom.  So there might be an awkward wait.  I used that time to watch the kitchen action on the other side :)\n\nWhy this place does not have 3 michelin stars is beyond me.  It is better than any other 3 michelin restaurant I have dined at, in California, New York, Europe, or otherwise.  It is almost criminal that Atelier Crenn has only 2 stars.   \n\nSo in conclusion, I cannot say go \"eat\" at Atelier Crenn or even \"enjoy dinner\"; I can only urge you to EXPERIENCE the perfection that is Atelier Crenn.", "author": "Lili L."}

The one thing that shined brighter here than at Benu was the beverage pairing.  It was a nearly flawless pairing that managed to surprise and new discoveries that my wife and I enjoyed very much.\n\nThe other aspect where Attelier Crenn shines over almost every other fine dining establishment - whimsy.  Which you may not care about but here - from the menu to the plating to the end of dinner chocolates - it carried as a theme, showed itself assertively, and was a success in terms of setting the tone for dinner.\n\nNow to counter all this, there were perhaps 2 courses that disappointed me.  Mostly in that they were neither particularly creative and when I tasted them, wasn't impressed at all.  These were mostly dry dishes, wafers or crackers, that just didn't do it for me.  This was more than made up, though, by the vast majority of dishes that were not only executed well, but also tasted good.\n\nOne last hiccup.  We asked the somm for a list of the pairing we had that night.  He gave us his email and asked us to email him and he said he would send back the pairing.  We sent the email - but he never responded.  Not a huge problem, but the follow-through would have been nice.\n\nThe reason for 4 stars.  If I have to compare this to other Michelin-starred restaurants, the whole of the experience didn't quiiiiite reach Manresa or Benu or others.  (It surpasses Per Se, though.)  The fact that I think they deserve 3 Michelin stars isn't mutually exclusive from my 4-star Yelp review.  I respect Chef Crenn and what she's set out to accomplish and her food and service are 3-star worthy in terms of Michelin.

Superb.\n\nHowever, if Yelp had an eight-dollar-sign option for \"Price range per person\" ($$$$$$$$$$), it probably still wouldn't be enough.\n\nI don't want to sound like a snob - and just by writing a review of Atelier Crenn, it's difficult to NOT sound like a snob - but I have been routinely let down by two and three-star Michelin restaurants this year and hoped that would not be the case for Atelier Crenn.  It was not.  This restaurant is an incredible experience and the 19-courses that we experienced that night were all delicious.\n\nOne thing that people should get into their heads before going is that this is not a white tablecloth, stuffy establishment.  I'm not sure why people consistently mention the casual (yet refined) decor and why they hold it against the restaurant, but stuffiness is not the vibe here.  And, honestly, that is refreshing.  People are dressed anywhere from nice casual to semi-formal, and it doesn't take away from the food experience.  It's great to be able to experience such an elevated level of cuisine while talking above a whisper, joking and laughing out loud when it's warranted.  The couple sitting next to us often chimed in on our dishes, making friendly conversation.  The wait staff was witty and entertaining.  All in all, the environment is great.  If you demand a higher level of refinement, head over Quince or Saison.\n\nThat being said, service is not casual at all.  The staff is on point, knowledgable, friendly and engaging.  We had great chats about everything from wine to the sommelier's upcoming trip to NYC. Their knowledge of the dishes and their ingredients is encyclopedic and they cannot be stumped. Chef Crenn, herself, came out to the table for a brief chat as well.\n\nIf you've made the decision to come here, you've already made the decision to take full advantage of your expense account or borrow from the kids' college fund, so why skimp on anything?  A wine pairing is a must here and the selections were incredible.  Whether you should go for the $295 reserve pairing is up to you (probably the most expensive I've ever seen!), but at least get the standard pairing.   The selections of Champagnes by the glass beforehand were excellent as well, although not included in the pairing.\n\nThere are a few additional options, which can add up quickly.  Shaved truffles.  Premium Caviar.  Unless you're a true aficionado of either, I don't think you'll miss much by skipping them, but that's between you and your Black Amex.  A cheese course is offered at a more reasonable $25 per person.\n\nThe concept of food as art is probably not represented anywhere better than this restaurant.  It is an experience for all senses and the level of detail paid to every little tidbit is outstanding. People have \"complained\" about the massively long 5+ dessert courses, saying that its excessive.  But if you've come here, you just need to give in to the idea that this meal is anything but ordinary.  \n\nThe  total for two people was $1126 for two tasting menus, two standard wine pairings, two glasses of rose champagne to begin and the cheese supplement. Service and tax is always included.  Yes, I understand that this is more than the mortgage on my first house but, again, you're paying for a special experience here.  Some people prefer to spend $600 a seat to see Hamilton while other people prefer to spend $600 on a more edible occasion.\n\nYou are not going to come here every Friday for dinner - that's for sure - but on the one that you do, I think you'll find it worth every penny.\n\nLastly, the most amusing thing about this Yelp review is the fact that Yelp asks me if Atelier Crenn has \"Bike Parking\".

The food seemed to be inspired and well prepared and the wine was excellent.\n\nThe negatives: basic \"blocking and tackling\" for restaurants was missed.  \n\nFor example, old dishes were frequently left to linger, water went unfilled, crumbs were not cleaned, and on 3 different occasions our wine pairing didn't arrive until after we'd already started eating the course.\n\nBeyond that, the greeter / receptionist really wasn't that friendly nor as excited to see us as you'd expect when paying for a 4 figure experience.

The restaurant resembles a bistro in that you hear your neighbors talking. The default presentation (verbal description, not plating) by the waiter of each dish is also a bit lacking in that you have to ask questions if you care and trying to ascertain the inspiration from the menu description may take too much brain power. I have to admit I prefer when the Chef or server tells a story about each dish( which has been the norm at most of the World's Top 50 restaurants I have dined at)  as opposed to just ingredient composition.

The modern atmosphere, incredible hospitality, and the kindness of the waitstaff fits perfectly into San Francisco's culture. \n\nBecause the menu isn't \"obvious\", note that it is important to like seafood if coming here. The exquisite fishes, the mussels, the caviar, the wagyu beef, the brioche, the DESSERTS - I could go on for days. \n\nLong story short, if you're looking for a high end meal, this is an incredible place to go. I recommend just ordering a bottle of white wine to share if the tasting menu is above your price range, they have some incredible suggestions. \n\nLove that Dominique Crenn herself came out to every table.

Such a milestone requires a review on somewhere that has greatly impacted my life. Atelier Crenn is such a place.\n\nI've been following Chef Dominique Crenn for quite some time. And for years I've been admiring the artful plating and creative conception of her dishes. I told myself that if I ever found myself in San Francisco, I would go to Atelier Crenn, no matter the cost.\n\nWell, in December of 2015, I started planning a trip to the Bay Area I was lucky enough to snag reservations for a Saturday night at 530pm. That might seem a little early for some people, but I think its the perfect time for a long multi course tasting menu. \n\nEnough about the back story though, how was the experience? \n\nI have to say that dining at Atelier Crenn was the single best overall experience I have ever had in any restaurant, anywhere. Everything was absolutely incredible. The restaurant itself wasn't that big yet it was cozy enough to feel intimate, and it created such a buzz with the numerous servers and bussers milling about. The service was impeccable. Each course was described in detail and the courses came out at the perfect pace. I never once sat there wondering where our food was. As for the courses themselves, each one was presented differently and each course was flavorful, well executed and beyond creative. I love how the menu is actually poem written by Chef Crenn, and then each line of the poem is a course. \n\nChef Crenn herself was present that night and she made her way around the dining room talking to guests and ensuring that everyone was enjoying the night as well as the food. I was able to take a few photos with Chef Crenn and it was definitely one of the highlights of my trip to the Bay Area. \n\nAtelier Crenn is definitely deserving of the two Michelin Star rating and for some time I was wondering why it hasn't earned its third? During my time in SF I also dined at the recently promoted Campton Place and Atelier Crenn is definitely much better with a higher value.\n\nBut thats another review for another time.", "author": "Mark M."}

Our meal started with a poem that was as inedible as it was trite and pedestrian.\n\nThe best bites (no dishes here) were semi interesting at best and still not worth sitting thru the long descriptions of ingredients for, let alone the price or the time I spent reading that poem. Much of the presentation and accessories of the meal are arbitrary and functionless yet the plate wear is significantly more memorable than the food.\n\nOur meal ended with a single dried carrot served on an enormous pine cone.  The turd looking carrot was tough, bland, and got stuck in every crevice of my teeth.  Great way to end a 1000 dollar meal for two.  \n\nI understand fine, adventurous, and conceptual dining, I get what this place claims to be and thinks it is.  I also wish I could support the place as the representation of female chefs in the fine dining industry is very much lacking.... but....This was the worst meal I have ever had in any price range in any location on the planet.\n\nDon't waste your time or your money pretending you enjoyed this place so that your friends think you are cool, rich, and knowledgeable about food.", "author": "Michael B."}

I've dined at Quince and SingleThread, so those were my two comparisons. I thought AC was very inventive with presentation and flavor. Loved the menu poem presented on the log; every dish but the shrimp carpaccio was incredible. Carpaccio was quite good; it's just that all the other dishes were outstanding. The dessert blew us away, and we aren't dessert people. We had one regular and one second tier wine pairing. We expected to see a few more older wines in the more expensive wine pairing, but we were really impressed with how all of the wines paired with the food. Really thoughtful and interesting pairings. The service was flawless. I'd say it was my favorite $1000 meal for two so far. I preferred the reserve wine pairing at Quince and the ambiance at SingleThread, but Crenn won on food, presentation and service.", "author": "Lisa M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-22", "description": "It was beautiful, the concept is unique with the poem and the gorgeous custom plating but it was just really expensive art that you get a bite of for each course. It is not any where near worth the price tag. There were a lot of delicious bites and there was one bite in particular that had the entire table gagging (the trout roe) - it was like taking a shot of a loogie. With the exception of the waygu, everything was a bite or two. Then there was the wine pairing, while tasty, you only got a sip or two per pour. That also felt like a rip off. At least at French laundry you can tell them how much you prefer to pay per person and you'd get a substantial amount for $150. At $180 for the wine pairing and $315 for the meal, it seemed a bit obscene. \nAnd don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I wish the food portions were larger, I just don't think it has to be priced that insanely for what you get. The Waygu was delicious and I know it is expensive at $7/ounce but it isn't like you got a 6pz filet of it, you got 4 bites. There could have been more wine, that I am saying. It was interesting experience and I say that if you can part with $500 without caring and want to experience the artful bites, do it. If you are weary, pass.", "author": "Sarah M."}

Unexpected and incongruous at times.\nIt was not a festive new year's menu, despite the caviar and the lobster, as it felt rather earthy - with trunks of wood on the table with twigs.. and even the praline in the shape of a walnut.\nAll this say, I felt like the Chef grounded us where we were - and was not pretending to be elsewhere in the world. With it, came a bit of melancholy in the dishes - possibly because of the chicken broth tea or the grains used in the starter courses - both decadent and reminding us of poorer times. I am not quite sure. I know this might seem bizarre, but I felt lonely after the meal - although I was there celebrating my husband's birthday. I felt like I took a trip to Big Sur and was standing on a cliff observing the trees and tasting the cold Pacific ocean.\nAll this to say, thank you Chef Crenn for this journey - it was emotional, solitary, refined and melancholic.", "author": "Stephanie R."}

Prior to our dinner, I search and searched online for a menu but couldn't find much on the website. Other than expecting to have an amazing meal, I wasn't sure what to expect. \n\nUpon being seated, our waiter presented us both with a poem and were told that there is not a  standard menu, but a poem that we can follow along to that will accompany our tasting. We read each line very carefully and tried our best to guess our meal for the night. It was quite a fun and exciting experience. \n\nAtelier Crenn is simple. The decor and the layout are all very simplicate. Neutral colors with some pieces of art displayed on the walls. It doesn't give off that too fancy, snobby feel.  \n\nEach artful creation was an experience in itself. Often times not exactly sure what to expect we handled each piece with exceptional care. The first item was a very thin white chocolate ball that had apple cider inside. It popped like a balloon in our mouths and we both looked at each other with wide eyes from the deliciousness. \n\nWe were also fortunate enough to have met Dominique that evening. She was very nice and thanked us for choosing to dine at her restaurant. \n\nOverall a very adventurous meal with a lot of surprises and unknowns.", "author": "Serena L."}

Amazing plating, good food but way overpriced.  Its worthy of checking out but has some flaws.\n\nThe ambiance is a bit too modern for me. I also don't like that the kitchen is hidden. However, Chef Crenn does make her presence felt, stalking the floor making sure every detail is correct. She also comes by your table a couple times which is nice.  Service overall was friendly and prompt. However, the description of each course was a bit too routine. These dishes are supposed to be moments of Crenn's life, but that gets lost in how they described off a script.  The pacing of the meal was an A+++, as courses came out almost right after you finished the last.\n\nAs mentioned above, the plating is top notch. This is art more than food.  Only Alinea does it better, and they are more about the experience plus plating, and Crenn is just plating.\n\nThe food was really great, but the portion sizes were just too small. Frustratingly small to be precise.  The biggest dish was the a5 and sadly that derailed the meal for me. The a5 portion was huge but it was so undercooked it was almost raw and cold. It needed to be cooked another minute. This just got the meal off the tracks for me.\n\nThe supplemental truffle cheese course also rubbed me the wrong way. Not only was it boring with no flavor, terrible truffles by the way, it was no where worthy of the $35 price tag for a single bite.\n\nDessert was playful and used non traditional dessert ingredients.\n\nI don't think I'd come back at this price, but I had a great time.", "author": "Trekforbeer B."}

The sommelier always took pity on me by topping me up when I finished my pour before a course was complete. :-)\n\nWe all found the dinner courses to be delicious and unique.  The smoked trout served with trout roe was especially memorable.  The duck breast with foie gras also was delicious.  I'll post photos of the courses for posterity.\n\nOverall, dropping $500+ per person for dinner is not a decision that most take lightly.

Every single bite made me smile from the inside out. It's fueled the fire in me to try more Michelin star restaurants - this could get really dangerous for my wallet. ;) \n\nWe had reservations for 8PM on a Saturday (I made reservations 1 week earlier). The service was absolutely perfect from beginning until the end during our 4 hour dining experience (yes, 4 hours!). Thorough attention to detail from each and every server that accompanied us throughout the dinner service. Our table top was kept immaculate (no crumbs left behind!), our glasses were always filled, and our steady flow of questions always answered. Since each dish was kept as a poetic surprise before it reached our table, our servers did an excellent job of explaining each ingredient and provided the Chef's recommended method of enjoying each dish.\n\nOnto the food:\nIt's so hard to pick favourites from the 18 courses but some of the highlights for me included the very first dish - A sweet ball filled with fresh juice that explodes in your mouth when punctured. Deliciously fun and a great way to cleanse the palette to set up for the epic meal to come. \n\nI also loved the \"Noir sur Noir\" line item from the menu, which was the squid cerviche on a potato puree with squid ink and truffle oil. \n\nWe had the option to add another course to the experience - the Japanese Wagyu beef (+ $130 USD each) - the flavours were amazing but unfortunately we expected a more melt-in-your-mouth quality from the beef. I would probably skip this adder in hindsight since it was a 2oz steak for a big price tag. \n\nOther highlights include the squab tea (think squab broth infused with Jasmine tea), the lobster, and the whimsical dessert treasure box full of goodies on a bed of shredded coconut.\n\nThe plating was simple, elegant and often interactive. Chef Crenn hand-picks her plates from Spain to act as the perfect canvas for her poetic edible art. There was no doubt that the beach/ocean theme of the menu was well represented. \n\nChef Dominique Crenn (the first female chef to receive 2 Michelin stars) came out to our table to introduce herself and say hello. She was kind enough to sign our poetry menu cards and chatted for a bit. Later, Chef Juan Contreras, the pastry chef came out to say hello as well while giving us a little bit more insight behind his dessert creations (amazing, btw!). These introductions added such an intimate and engaging experience to our dinner, I loved it.  \n\nOur bill for two people came to $1100 USD ($1400 CAD) - definitely the most expensive meal I've ever had but oh-so worth it!

The flight has been booked and he is to be gone from 02/04/16-02/14/16. Although I'm happy for my boyfriend (who's finally able to see and spend time with his relatives after ~20 years), the trip initially made me VERY upset because he would be missing both his birthday AND Valentine's Day celebrations in the states. With me. ASDFGHJKL!!!@#$%^\n\nBut, he made it up to me with surprise reservations at Atelier Crenn. And wow, our experience was mind-blowing, to say the very least. All wrongdoings were forgiven, all upset feelings were forgotten.\n\nOur reservations were for 5:30pm on a Friday evening. Before we were led to our table, my boyfriend presented me with a copy of Dominique Crenn's debut cookbook: \"Atelier Crenn: Metamorphosis of Taste\" and asked the hostess if she could have Dominique and the sous chefs sign it. (He called ahead to make sure chef Crenn would be at the restaurant that night.) SWOON.\n\nOnce we were seated, the sommelier made his way over and offered us champagne, which we declined because we were set on wine for the night. My wonderful, thoughtful boyfriend ordered the grand wine pairing ($175), but I just had a glass of pinot noir ($30) because I nearly blacked out the time I finished the wine pairing at Sons & Daughters... lol.\n\nAnyway, onto the food! The menu was presented to us -- a beautiful poem by Dominque Crenn herself, made up of 17 lines. The tasting course began shortly afterwards, starting with an AMAZING amuse bouche. Actually, every dish was amazing and beautifully presented. Intricate and subtle, but bursting with flavor... but how? I do not know. It was all extremely well-executed and every bite was like spending a minute in heaven. Even the cauliflower with goat cheese was wonderful, and I despise goat cheese. Seriously, I don't think I'll ever think of food the same way.\n\nChef Crenn eventually came around to introduce herself and present us with the signed copy of her cookbook. She made sure we were enjoying our dinner and even took a photo with us! (It's now Mike C.'s Yelp profile photo.)\n\nService was impeccable; each course was described in detail and we were never left wondering whether our meal had come to an end or not. Nobody skipped a beat. I still can't believe how impressive the service was.\n\nAfter 3 life-changing hours, our tasting course came to an end. We said our goodbyes and went back to the hotel, where we spent the next hour looking at/uploading photos from our dinner onto Instagram.

And that was after our not opting for the offered  Don Perignon and  \"premium\" wine pairings with no prices specified.  Instead of a menu with prices, guests received a small-print page, containing - for each of 15 courses - a cryptic poetic phrase alluding metaphorically to  sea or earth.

We made this reservation to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday, and after a bit of a hiccup involving the reservation (resolved graciously by the general manager), we wound up with a table in the kitchen next to the pass, right next to Kevin, the executive sous chef who was running the kitchen for the evening.  \n\nWe enjoyed the full menu with one of the high end wine pairings. From the classic amuse bouche to start (a play on the classic Kir Breton, with cider in place of the champagne in a Kir Royale) to the Mayan-themed dessert courses, the food was, as others here have amply illustrated, spectacular:  inventive, creative, flavorful, occasionally indulgent, and beautifully prepared.  Some of the highlights (not including the fantastic brioche, of course) included a play on fish-and-chips with a single shot of swordfish bone marrow in cucumber gelee accompanied by crunchy potato strings dusted with seaweed powder, grilled rice with wakame and kombu seaweed served with butter-poached uni in a fennel-scented dashi/bouillon broth, and the first dessert course, an avocado mousse in the shape of a jade funeral mask.  The wine pairings were extraordinary as well, with some highlights including a rare dry white wine from Chateau D'Yquem, a 1971 (!) Barolo, and a 1994 Haut Brion -- worth the price of admission alone!\n\nThe entire staff, from the General Manager Maxime, the Sommelier Matthew, and the Executive Sous Kevin to the two chefs in the back room putting together some of the dessert courses, were friendly and attentive, and the entire experience from being greeted at the front door to the group photo with the kitchen team really was extraordinary.

The sommelier was a complete douche bag who couldn't bother himself to present wines to both me and my date.  Instead, he chose to ogle my date and present wines exclusively to her which was a bit of turn off on the meal.  I suppose I should be flattered that she was with me, but when the sommelier's service and service style becomes the topic of conversation for dinner, it distracts from the experience which I believe contradicts Chef Crenn's intent.  Perhaps, I'm wrong about that, but that at least summarizes our experience and left a bit of a bad taste in our mouths along with some disappointment in the experience.\n\nWe paid $1300 for two and opted for the reserve pairing -- I guess that got us the extra special fancy service from the sommelier.

When you want a pristine fine dining experience that really shows food as an art and illustrates what the appeal of spending so much money on food is, you go to Atelier Crenn. Definitely wishing Chef Crenn the best with Michelin in the future -- having gone to a few other notable triples in SF and NYC, I can say that this place beats all of those places. Atelier Crenn is insanely innovative and creative in its dishes -- this place will blow your mind and change the way you think about food. Dishes are not only beautiful, but delicious and just fascinating to conceptually think about. \n\nThe SO and I came here to celebrate his birthday. We managed to get an early Saturday dinner reservation fairly easily through Opentable. The restaurant was empty when we arrived around 6pm. By the time we left after 8, the place was pretty packed. Despite the dining area being fairly small, the noise level is managed fairly well so it never gets too loud or anything. \n\nThere's not a ton of point in going into the dishes we had since they change seasonally, so here are a couple highlights from our night: opening kir breton / caviar, corn pudding, and uni / duck broth / and the desserts. The kir breton is such a delight to open with -- it's an apple cider inside a chocolate shell. They open with this regardless of what season it is, and it's just an amazing way to start the meal. After that, every dish was innovative and wonderful. Fine dining is spectacular in its way of taking food I never liked as a kid but then cooking it so wonderfully that it's all delicious at the end. With the right fresh vegetables, everything is delicious. There were a few dishes that were less memorable than others, but you can tell Chef Crenn is taking risks and pushing the boundaries of what you can do with food. The carrot jerky is a good example of holy crap, did you know you could do that with a carrot? It's not my favorite, but that willingness to cook something so odd is what makes the entire experience so much fun. The desserts here were incredible -- I rarely manage to find good desserts these days, but these were outstanding. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what we were eating, just that it was beautiful and delicious. \n\nService here is solid. Professional and still friendly. One really wonderful thing I appreciate about Atelier Crenn is that Chef Crenn actually comes out and greets you during the meal. I'm a huge fan of her work and her restaurant so it was really cool to actually meet someone I really admire in the culinary industry. \n\nI really can't rave enough about this place. Atelier Crenn is a place I hope to come back to year after year to see where they go. Price for two tasting menus and two glasses of wine came out to be $630, which is pretty reasonable relative to other fine dining establishments in SF. Given how amazing the experience is, I think the money is definitely worth spending. There's really not much else you could want from a fine dining experience.\n\ntldr; my favorite fine dining restaurant, dishes are extremely innovative and creative and fun to eat, ingredients are masterfully combined to create insanely fascinating dishes you'll never be able to find anywhere else", "author": "Jasmine X."}

We arrived early concerned with Saturday night traffic in SF. We were the second couple to arrive. The first couple had been provided champagne. We were not offered and sat on the bench to wait. Five other couples joined us over the next twenty minutes. All of them were provided champagne. We again sat without being offered.  I wasn't sure if this was because we didn't pre-order our wine service? Even still, we were the only couple in the restaurant waiting that was without a beverage or even offered. If that thought process was because we hadn't preorder, please inquire and add it to our bill. It was uncomfortable and we certainly would have appreciated a start to our evening. \n\nAs said, we were second into the restaurant. We were the last to be seated. When we were sat, we were at a table with another couple. They had placed a large potted flower in the middle of the table to block our view from each other. \n\nI paid 1200.00 for dinner for 2 (including wine service). Honestly, at 1200.00 per couple having to share a table is completely unacceptable. The flower pot was distracting. Each time I looked up I felt like I had a flower pot in my face.  I did tell our server I was not happy with our ridiculous seating arrangements. It was as if they overbooked or added and they were making it work for themselves. He offered to reschedule our prepaid dinner. (Reminder, special occasion, 9pm on a Saturday night in the city with a hotel room... highly unlikely we would be able to get into another restaurant). He offered to move our table once one opened (1 1/2 hours into our meal which we did). We received a complimentary cheese course. All completely unacceptable considering what I expect from a restaurant of this caliber. We felt as if we didn't want to talk concerned we would interrupt our table mates experience. \n\nRock music was playing in the background. We listened to Foreigner and ACDC. Not exactly what I had in mind for an intimate evening. \n\nThe food was an artistic master piece. It is more of a 'show' with constant service throughout. \nThe flavors of the food were unique but with the sizes being so small I never felt that satisfying feeling of completion to the meal. One to two bites each started to excite the palate but didn't fulfill it for me. \n\nWith the beginning service, the unacceptable table seating, music and lack of meal fulfillment, I would not recommend or return.

Words can not describe the dining experience my wife and I had here on a late July evening.  Each bite is so well conceived and memorable.  While the service was less than stellar, the food itself greatly outweighs any negative marks Atelier Crenn earns from its less-than-attentive staff.  \n\nService: I have been to Jean Georges in New York, which provided the best dining experience in my life, but the least memorable food, and can say that the service at Crenn is lacking.  First, our server did not acknowledge us until maybe 5-10 minutes after we sat down.  Furthermore, they mistakenly brought us a dessert course, 3 courses too early, before we had finished our savory bites.  They ultimately decided to bring that same course again, later on in the meal.\n\nFood:  Each course is very well balanced, full of flavor, and very memorable.  My favorite courses were the abalone and salmon.  Each dish is uniquely plated, and keeps each diner guessing with each bite.  We found ourselves trying to guess the next course based on the next line in the poem, but were often times well off the mark.  I had very high expectations for the food, and those expectations were greatly exceeded!\n\nAmbiance & Decor:  Atelier Crenn is quite small for a michelin star restaurant, but perhaps that was the intent.  The lighting is very ambient, romantic, and greatly adds to the mystery and curiosity of the dining experience.

By far this was the single best meal I have ever had in my life and I seriously doubt I will ever have a better dining experience, Chef Crenn is more than a person that makes food, she is a artist in every sense of the word and her approach to food is inspiring and thought provoking. \n\nI was so shocked that she was actually there running the kitchen that I did not recognize her, plus she was not wearing a chef coat, so she kind of blended into the background, that is until she approached our table and she blessed us with her 1000 watt smile that could literally  be on the cover of any beauty magazine or on anyones movie or tv screen, her beauty, charisma and presence are only outclassed by her genius when it comes to the art of culinary expression.   \n\nAtelier Crenn eschews all pretentiousness associated with french fine dining and has a significant feeling of warmth, exclusivity and cohesion, what I mean by exclusivity is that you will NEVER find Atelier Creen unless you already know it is there, my dining companion and I had so much trouble finding the place we quite literally walked right past it 3 times while staring right at it, but due to her sharp eyes she was finally able to spot the logo on the door, it makes you feel as if you are privy to information that the general public is not aware of, kind of like being part of a elite secret society, moreover the FANTASTIC wait staff reinforce that impression with the artful service you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. \n\nUsually I find that people that work at these types of places are stuck up, but this place was the exact opposite, while professional each person that came to our table had a level of...what word am I looking for...hmm...earthiness...yes that is correct, they were competent and practiced in the knowledge and presentation of the cuisine but at the same time it didn't seem forced or rehearsed or as if they were reading from the cue cards which was really a breath of fresh air for me.\n\nThe only only wrong note hit on the whole night is that our Salmon took a little too long to come out, but the staff said that something happen in the kitchen so they had to redo the dish, but it was really no biggy because I rather have my dish come out a little bit late than have it hammered and everyone knows that there is no pain like that of eating a botched piece of fish, but we did NOT have that problem, the fish was succulent and beautifully prepared, I remember commenting that I could eat this dish everyday of my life for the rest of my life, and I am serious about that!\n\nSo with all of those things being said there is a gigantic pink elephant sitting in the middle of the room, I have had the privilege of dinning at two resteraunts that currently have three Michillan Stars *Manresa and Saison* and I can honestly say that in no way shape or form are they superior to the cuisine, ambiance or service of Chef Crenn's resteraunt and in many ways I find her approach, thoughtfulness and sensibilities when it came to the food to be slightly superior. \n\nThe only reason that I can possibly think of that she doesn't have a 3rd Michillan star is because she is a woman, and that upsets me because awards and prestige she be earned on merrit and nothing else. \nI honestly feel like if she was a man she would have gotten her 3rd star a loooooong time ago!", "author": "Sunday S."}

As I like to try a new restaurant every time, I rarely do repeat visits even if a comp meal is offered but Joel was very sincere and apologetic about our experience when we spoke over the phone that Crenn deserved a second chance. \n\nMy gf and I enjoy savory fare over sweets so we both went with the Signature 5-Courses and split the cost of the second ($95) since only one would be comped. \n\n~ * ~ SIGNATURE 5-COURSE ~ * ~\n*Amuse Bouche - Kir Breton: http://bit.ly/1gGfrav\n(1) Grains & Seeds, Dashi, Yuzu Kosho: http://bit.ly/1aCGcnU\n(2) The Sea: http://bit.ly/1aCGhI9\n**Add'l course not listed on menu (bone marrow dumpling and hodge podge of beautiful ingredients): http://bit.ly/1anaO04\n(3) Walk in the Forest: http://bit.ly/HS1tUB\n(4) Land, Rose, Pomegranate: http://bit.ly/1gGgmI6\n(5) Grape & Hazelnut: http://bit.ly/18oC7nu\n*Complimentary Mignardises  : http://bit.ly/1cRw6Hr\n\nJust like the Grand Tasting Menu, the Signature 5-Course was alluring, whimsical, and delectable. This may be \"pretty\" food but it was also packed with a lot of flavor; expect intricate flavor profiles and satisfying texture and temperature contrasts. Stand-outs of the night: the wondrous uni flan (The Sea) the perfectly cooked squab and deliciously crisp leaves (Land, Rose, Pomegranate). \n\nWe received an additional course that night which contained a bone marrow dumpling that was not listed on the menu. This was the course that was missed the first time we visited Crenn and I was in awe that they remembered and recreated the course for us (assuming this was the case). Talk about going above and beyond. \n\nThe portions for the 5 courses are very small and you will most likely leave hungry so I highly recommend going for the Grand Tasting Menu or making plans to have a second dinner afterwards (our heffer arses went to Amici's afterwards). \n\nThis time around, service was everything you would expect a two Michelin star restaurant to be. It was obvious that they take customers' feedback to heart because service was a complete 180. The staff was professional, refined, and genuine. A smile makes a world of a difference and looks like the staff knew that too. Timing of the courses were prompter and each course was properly introduced unlike our first visit. \n\nHats off to Joel for ensuring our second experience at Crenn was a memorable one and kudos to Dominique Creen for another year with two Michelin stars under her belt. \n\nSadly, we didn't get to see Dominique in the dining area this time around but we did get to meet the amazing manager she hired because Joel was our waiter that night.

We were there eating and drinking from 8:30pm - 12:30am! The menu was presented in a top secret SEALED envelope with a 17 line poem describing our courses for the night.  \n\nMy amazing boyfriend only deserves the best for his birthday so we got the grand tasting menu with grand wine pairings which came with the perfect amount of wine for every 2-3 courses. The service was exceptional. There were at least 6-8 wait staff taking care of everyone.\n\nFor the first course, \"Spring has come with its cool breeze\", it was a delicately crafted sphere with a fragile shell filled with this apple cider concoction gently placed on a tiny pedestal. The waiter instructed us to lift the pedestal to our mouth and take the whole ball in your mouth. It was NOT the first time a man told me to take a whole ball in my mouth, so I thought no problem! This is easy. I didn't realize how delicate it was because as soon as I put my lips on it, it broke and I left a puddle of juicy goodness on the table! Yikes. They were so nice! The staff noticed my mishap (probably shook their heads and uttered amateur under their breath) and gave me another one. I kept laughing so hard I almost fucked up again. The waiter was right, having the ball bust in my mouth was definitely a very refreshing feeling!\n\nMy most favorite was the uni pudding stuff with caviar on top in course #2 \"Mellow serenades of colors licorice and orange\". It tasted fresh and juicy with hints of buttery sweetness that intensified each time I smacked my tongue against my lips. \n\n2nd favorite was the lobster bisque \"These creatures, who move with a slow, vague wavering of claws\". It was creamy and packed full of chunky lobster goodness so fresh and meaty. It came with this pickled stuff on the side which tantalized my taste buds in between spoon fulls of lobster bisque. \n\nThere are just too many courses that I won't be able to write about! You will just have to try it out for yourself! 4 hours is a long time for dinning so plan accordingly!\n\nMy complaints are that there isn't a lot of privacy in between tables. I can eavesdrop on the tables to my left and right even when they're whispering.  Also, the table to our right was always 1 course ahead of us so we were constantly trying not to look at what the course was like so we wouldn't get robbed of our mystery surprise each time. I would also have personally preferred more of a balance between land and sea courses. Other than that, it was a very romantic and fun experience!", "author": "Janny S."}

The meal starts off with the menu being presented as a poem...which is definitely is unique, but without a formal menu, the meal is slightly challenging to follow... a suggestion would be a formal menu next to the poem! :)\n\nAll of the dishes were unique and modern with French inspiration. Some of the unique highlights included a couple chocolate-like domes with chilled liquid on the inside for a couple of the courses...definitely a first in my book! Other unique dishes were some grains mixed with some broth which was a unique and different experience in my book.\n\nDominique Crenn herself stopped by our table a couple times which was definitely a treat of its own.\n\nService by the staff was excellent and very proper ...not quite Michelin 3 star...but close.\n\n...now I wonder if Dominique has met Joel Robuchon... ;)\n\n~$240 per person after tax and tip dinner.", "author": "Derek S."}

I had the opportunity to try a few things I had never eaten before (pickled mussels, abalone, real Wagyu), and many others that I haven't been able to enjoy for months because they're long out of season in DC (peas, strawberries). Everything was just about perfect, but highlights for me included cured trout with orange gelee and yogurt, a pea stew with pickled mussel, and incredibly tender Wagyu beef with beet and horseradish cream. The Wagyu butter accompanying the bread was also delicious and so, so beefy. \n\nAnd isn't that what French cuisine is really about? Coaxing fresh ingredients into the best, most flavorful versions of themselves?\n\nPortion sizes seem small until you get to course 17 and realize that your husband is going to have to roll you out of the restaurant.\n\nWine pairings were delicious. Probably didn't need to spring for the champagne beforehand as well, but hey, we were celebrating :)\n\nThe service was great too - friendly, informative, and well-timed.

There were so many in each dish & since there are no menus ( but a poem that hints about what you'll enjoy! ), we had to rely on our poor short-term memories\n\n*  Apple cider encased in cocoa butter plus kirsch dollop - incredible how the sweet liquid of the cider stayed in the cocoa butter shell - it was like a wine-filled truffle\n\n*  Salsafee with truffle and fried salsafee on top - homemade buckwheat cracker.  This is a tubular root veggie that tasted like a mix of a potato & carrot \n\n*  Tempura turnip. Picked beet,  Pea shoot, baby carrot. Asparagus spear. \n\n*  Sunchoke in a pana cotta of licorice consume   \n\n*  Coconut, persimmon, pea shoot, baby carrot, asparagus spear. This soup / pudding-like dish was our fav.  The coconut was so dense & creamy!\n\n*  Cheese dumpling onion broth & black truffle, housemate brioche. Paired w/ sherry. Creamy dumpling that tasted like a dollop goat cheese (delish!) & we liked the sherry a lot - complimented the savory broth & cheesy goodness\n\n*  Rhubarb consume in veggie ash - palate cleanser.  This was like the Amuse Busche & was a liquid-filled refreshing treat\n\n*  Quinoa, buckwheat, w/ pumpkin, sesame, flax, & sunflower seeds in a seaweed broth paired w/ a dark, nutty beer\n\n*  Dehydrated & pickled mushroom, hazelnuts, pumpernickel meringue dollops \n\n*  Corn consomm\u00e9 corn silk deep fried & wrapped up to look like a bird's nest. Puffed rice, pressed corn pudding (for the eggs in the nest) w/ apple & a tree branch made of Venezuelan chocolate wrapped in porcini dust\n\n*  Turnip Raspberry Helene fermented mustard seeds\n\n*  Olive oil meringue filled w/ edible flowers. \n\n*  We added a cheese course mostly sheep milk cheese but there was a blue & a cow in there too. Semi hard & liked all 5 x 1-ounce slices \n\n*  Guava consomm\u00e9 w/ chili & lime seeds, served in a test tube. Sugarcane infused w lemon grass \n\n*  Lollipops w/ eucalyptus & mint - this came out w/ dry ice & looked very prehistoric\n\n*  Raisin baguette. Fresh grapes, hazelnuts, port ice cream covered in grapes skin Saba poured on top - this was served in a halved wine bottle - very cool concept\n\n*  Final desserts - passion fruit gelee; chocolate nougat, passion fruit; salted caramel\n\nDuring the evening, Dominique Crenn came out to introduce herself to everyone in the room, shake hands & make sure we were all enjoying ourselves - & we were!  \n\nAnd although good times were had by all, just didn't get the vibe that it was the best we'd ever had......and we left there still hungry....which is saying something, given everything I just listed above\n\nOverall, staff was attentive, presentation was exquisite, food was extremely small portioned yet extremely inventive & tasty, so in terms of ratings, would say we were fans & would come again, but would not be top of mind \n\nTotal damage for the evening:\n\n2 people; \n4 hrs 45 min\n2 Tasting Menus\n2 Cheese Courses\n1 wine paring; 2 glasses champagne\nTOTAL before tip - $745", "author": "Adrienne G."}

That's why I am not even going to the details of dishes. There's nice ambience and poetry that goes with each dish.

I ordered the Reserve Pairing and was surprised we started with a $22 bottle of CEP wine.  It was good but for $300 each it was disappointing. Same with the second pairing.  Then a staff member said the somm didn't realize we were the Reserve order and would pour extra wines towards the end.  \n\nAnother area that bugged me at $600 uptick for wine pairing was the somm would pour from the bottle into a small carafe and then divide that portion in to our glasses and the. leave an ounce in the carafe, and walk away and dump it.  Come on dude! we are paying the equivalent of $100 a glass when summed up....pour the rest.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the deserts though they were beautiful to look at.  \n\nSo the big question after spending more than $2 large for a dinner, would I do it again?

They confirm and re-confirm your appointment multiple times and make sure you know about their cancellation fees if you don't show.\n\nBut when you understand how they create their menus and manage their services, it becomes clear why these things are necessary. They use extremely high quality ingredients that are expensive on their own, but they also get most of their supplies on a daily basis to maximize how fresh their proteins and produce are.\n\nAll of the cons for Atelier Crenn take place before you enter the front door, and after that there are nothing but pros.\n\nWe entered the restaurant from the street and it was very peaceful inside. Minimal decorating and seating that's spaced out comfortably (as opposed to cramming every possible seat into a space like most SF restaurants). The host offered to take our bags and coats and showed us our table.\n\nShortly after we sat down, the sommelier came by and offered us champagne from a variety of options. We're not really big on champagne and we planned to do their wine pairings with our meal, so we didn't want to overdo it. Throughout the meal, we were extremely happy with our wine pairings. My wife is very knowledgeable about wine, and every question or comment she made to the sommelier (his name was Matt) was met with impressive knowledge and a very friendly while still professional manner. Our experience as a whole was greatly improved by his service and the wines he paired with the delicious food.\n\nBefore our first course arrived, we were given an envelope with a poem inside. This poem was an artful guide to the way our meal would progress. I won't spoil what the subject matter was, since it changes all the time (seasonally I believe) but it was fun to go back and re-read certain lines of the poem as we finished our courses.\n\nJust as Matt was a great sommelier, everyone that spoke with us while we dined was also extremely professional and friendly. We asked one of the waiters how the chef managed to make the yogurt sauce we really liked and he didn't even miss a beat as he described every aspect of the process. When we asked how he knew it all he simply replied that he loves cooking himself and pays very close attention to the chefs there.\n\nTo say the food was fantastic would be an understatement. The dishes are small, but there are many of them and they are full of incredible flavors. This is not the place for you if you hate minimal, super fancy food. But if you're looking for interesting flavor combinations, umami, and a general ecstatic experience for a picky palette, you will appreciate Atelier Crenn.\n\nThis is a \"special occasion\" dining experience. If you are looking for a wonderful once-in-a-while experience in SF, this is a great place to do that. If you want to have high quality fancy food on a more regular basis, I would suggest less expensive options like Lazy Bear.

The evening was an experience we won't forget. The presentation was exquisite and very creative, and the service was over the top. The price was way over the moon, but keep in mind  in advance that you will be spending an obscene amount of money over the next 90 minutes. You'll understand the high price when you see that she has assembled a staff of 10 servers and 20 in the kitchen servicing about 12-15 tables.  I could have fed a family of four at a very nice restaurant for what I paid for two glasses of Champagne and one wine pairing. The Champagne was great but not worth the $35/glass and the standard wine pairing for one person priced at $175 was not worth the price and included wines (like Sake, and a Sonoma Pinot; really?) with minuscule pours that made the wine tasting I had in Napa this past week seem like I had been over served. They also offered a wine pairing that would have cost $295 (seriously?).  Skip the wine pairing and order a glass or a bottle you'll want to drink. I give my experience a 4 star not because I will go back or because it was a great value or for the non existent wine pairing but really for the overall culinary experience developed and prepared by the incredibly gifted artist she is and the talented and creative team she has assembled at Atelier Crenn.

Modern vibe and fairly quiet the night we went. \n\nService: 4/5 Our reservation was at 8:30pm but unfortunately they don't have anyone who answers phones after 6pm. I misunderstood the voicemail when they said they have valet parking... it's not at the restaurant! You have to download an app and apparently someone comes to pick up your car? We drove a Mclaren to dinner that night and didn't want someone driving the car. I called a couple times leaving voicemails trying to get help and explain how we would now be late, but since no one answers phones after 6pm it was useless. We ended up valeting our car at Bobos steakhouse and Ubered back to the restaurant. Serious hassle! We walked into the restaurant 30 minutes late and extremely frustrated. I briefly explained all of our struggles and the hostess just said sorry...not normally how you want to start a meal at a restaurant like this. I almost chose to just go home. \n\nOnce we were seated the service during our dinner was phenomenal as I expect from any Michelin restaurant. Each dish and wine selection was explained thoroughly. The last problem we had was they forgot we were celebrating my boyfriends birthday... They brought the bill out, I payed, and then I had to ask, \"you guys don't do anything for birthdays?\" Our server apologized and had their birthday dessert brought out pretty quickly. Not a huge deal, but it's a little upsetting when you pay over $1500 for dinner for two and they can't remember it's for a birthday... \n\nFood: 5/5 I have absolutely no complaints here! If you are a foodie, you'll love it! Well thought out courses and perfect wine pairings! I chose the grand pairing and my boyfriend went with the reserve pairing. It was great to be able to try both!  We also opted in for the caviar dish and it was well worth it! Yum! Not only were their main dishes satisfying, creative, and delicious, but so were the desserts!  For me, a meal isn't complete without a mouthwatering dessert!  \n\nOverall: 4/5 I hate to take a star away because the food was delicious, but having the bad experiences before and after the meal with very little comforting from the staff was not 2 Michelin star material. \n\nTip for the restaurant: Please have someone available to answer the phone as long as you are open, or at least until your last reservation has been seated.", "author": "Korinna C."}

The Spring seasonal tasting menu was delicious from the first bite to the last.  The current menu is pretty seafood centric (including oyster, abalone, trout, bream, uni, mussels), but if you love seafood then this is as good as it gets.  The most amazing dish of the night was Uni in a lobster broth.  It looked very simple, but the flavors were like nothing I've ever had before.  \n\nThe service was impeccable; attentive without being overbearing or pretentious, and the pacing was just right -- dinner was 3 hours, but never seemed to drag.  The chef (not Ms. Crenn) came out personally to describe a few of the dishes and he seemed very down to earth and genuinely appreciative of the compliments.  We had a table near the open doorway to the kitchen, which is typically not a great spot, but it was really interesting to watch the staff working to carefully assemble each dish -- all of which were visually beautiful in addition to tasting incredible.  The only thing remotely negative I can say about the overall experience is their annoying process of confirming, and re-confirming (and re-confirming!) our reservation, but that's a nit in comparison to the food itself.  \n\nFor me, Atelier Crenn is right up there with Manresa, and notably better than the other \"Michelin Star\" restaurants I've been to recently (Chez TJ, Bouchon, Village Pub).  We'll certainly be back to try future \"Seasons\" at Atelier Crenn.", "author": "Franklin G."}

This poor review is for the fact that I had a reservation for Valentine's Day weekend since late October and they just called me today (only 5 days in advance) to let me know the price was going from $220 to $298 a person. They said the price now includes gratuity, but even if you tip 20%, that is still an additional $34 increase per person. Plus, the cost of wine pairings went up $25 per person too. \n\nThis was a real splurge already for us, so we didn't keep our reservation. But it is really out of principle that I couldn't support them. Such a bad move to raise the price on someone who has had this reservation for 3 and a half months. And of course, now other restaurants are already all booked up for the holiday weekend. So we don't have any plans. Such a disappointment. But, I guess not too disappointing since we won't be spending $475 a person. Maybe we should go to Hawaii instead.", "author": "Erin T."}

Each course w/ the wine pairing gets better and better.  One of the things that stood out to me was the menu was written in a form of a poem.  The presentation were superb as well.  The creativity in each dish shows the delicacy and intricate details.  It was like eating a work of art every time.\n\nI usually don't care for the desserts b/c they're sweet, but at Atelier Crenn it was tasty and not too sweet.  One notable dessert was the honeycomb.  The pieces were placed inside a honeycomb stand.  It was beautiful and fun to look at and wonderful to eat.  \n\nThe only catch was that the restaurant is quite small, probably not great for a large group, but wonderful for an intimate setting.\n\nThis is definitely a place i'll come back for a magnificent meal and see what kind of artful Ms. Crenn would come up next.

This doesn't mean that you'll go hungry, but don't expect a whole pound of steak!\n\nNow that that's out of our way... let's get to the important things.\n\nService: all our waiters were very nice and they all explained the dishes with detail and they were even able to answer a few random questions about the ingredients and the cuisine we were offered. I also loved that the chef came out to finish some dishes at the table. \n\nAmbiance: i like how they made a simple yet stylish restaurant. I was siting besides the window and the pillow in the bench was somehow hollow... maybe they should think on replacing that.\n\nFood: what??!?! Seriously, what? Every course is a nice and pleasant surprise. \nIt was my birthday, so the chef made an extra dessert for me. I must say: that should be in the regular menu!!! Loved it. Was perfect. \nI'm a sweet's lover and I must say, I was extremely happy with the 4/5 courses of sweet things. I could have eaten 10/15 more easily!\n\nThe whole experience was very pleasant.

Atelier Crenn lives up to its name of culinary beauty for sure.  What is not to love when you combine beautiful poetry with food?  Chef Crenn writes her own 15 line poetry then creates the menu around it!\n\nFirst the ambience:  For a Thursday evening, it was very quiet.  We got in at 6:15 and finished around 9:00.  A good two to three hour experience.  The colors were neutral grey which was very calming and soothing.  Noise level was relatively low because the restaurant was not fully occupied.  The restroom was decorated just like the main dining room.  The kitchen had a small window where you can see the chef in action.  The service was good and that also helped.  Although our waitress knew her job well, she was not exactly the friendliest.\n\nPresentation and creativity:  in this category, they definitely get a 5.  Each dish was meticulous from the type of silverware to the plating.  The use of different culinary techniques shines through the use of color, taste and smell.  Most dishes were too pretty to eat!\n\nTaste:  everything was delicious.  Given that I am a fan of Gary Danko and Commis, I'm a pretty tough customer to please.   Most dishes were solid except for the bone marrow with osetra over buckwheat chips.  I think the chef ran out of ideas and decide to combine 3 lines (of poetry\uff09into one dish.  Each dish was paired with a wine to enhance the taste of the dish.  Although I would've paired the dishes a little different, it still worked.  The taste of each dish was very unique. \n\nYou need to go to taste each dish to see for yourself to see.  Overall experience is true 4.  For the price tag, I think you can definitely get better.

Michelin 2 stars? Menu is in the form of a poem? Why, yes please! \n\nLike: I really appreciate the poetic menu, the artistic presentations, and most of the food. \n\nDislike: the Japanese beef was too chewy and not cooked right; it felt closer to cheap ribeye than standard quality filet mignon (plus it cost an additional $85/person for 3oz of meat). Service was just \"ok\" and subpar compared to other 1-2 Michelin star restaurants in the bay area. \n\nVerdict: Overall, the food quality and service simply don't justify the end price. The total cost for 2 (without wine pairing, but added 2 glasses of wine and the Japanese beef) cost $900+. I'd much prefer eating at Commis (also 2 stars) or even Gary Danko (1 star) multiple times, which in my opinion offer better service and comparable food quality.", "author": "Sasuke N."}

Our server noticed I accidentally grabbed my Kir Breton a little too roughly and it shattered in my fingers. (Oops!)

Notice I'm calling it an 'experience' rather than a meal. That's because it's more like a performance art piece where you, the diner, are a participant. The dishes are heavily on the molecular gastronomy side, and each 'course' is generally a mouthful or two. You will likely leave not hungry -- but not exactly full either. Particularly as these edible art pieces are doled out over the course of perhaps 4-5 hours (our experience was at five hours) for about 19 items. \n\nIt's a prix fixe menu, with the various courses/dishes presented as lines in a poem. Part of the experience is figuring out how the item presented before you fits with the poem. It's a bit 'precious' and pretentious, but it adds an interactive quality to the meal. They do explain what each item is when set on the table.\n\nThe food itself is quite good, with I would say 6 being delicious, 7 good, and about 6 that were -- while ok -- nothing special in terms of flavor. \n\nI won't go into every item, because it changes constantly (which is part of the appeal) -- so my meal won't be your meal. Be prepared for unique items like blue algae and basil in a suspension served in test-tubes, truffle broth in an alginate bon-bon style shell, squab bites draped with huckleberry and bone marrow with caviar on top and set on beads of nitrogen-frozen matcha tea.\n\nAlso of note is that they have vegetarian options and are happy to accommodate dietary restrictions. In fact, one of the high points is the service -- which was fantastic. I'm not sure if every table gets their own server, but it felt that way as they were unobtrusive, yet instantly there the moment you wanted something. For our party of multiple diners, the servers coordinated to make sure each item touched the table at the same moment in a perfectly choreographed move in one fluid motion. It was impressive. As was the way in which they would wipe and reset the setting between each of the 19 courses.\n\nIf you are planning to go, be aware that you must call for a reservation. Atelier Crenn doesn't take walk-ins; it's a small restaurant, with a lengthy and intricate service, so there are limited seatings.", "author": "Ian T."}

Before coming here, I learned at Atelier Crenn is the only two Michelin star restaurant by a female chef in the entire country!  The restaurant is dubbed \"artistic culinaria\" which is both charming and playful.  The restaurant is actually an ode to Chef Dominque Crenn's late father with him she obviously loved very much.  We made reservations for Thursday at 5:30 PM which is when the restaurant opens- this was a mistake.  The doors were locked until 5:45 PM which meant we stood outside like a bunch of smucks.  They also never apologized or addressed their tardiness.  Did I miss a memo?  Strike one.  \n\nThe food itself was delicious although I find the dishes to be a tad repetitive as far as taste and presentation (everything was served on a black slate).  The servers seemed to fall apart as the night progress and the place got busier.  Did I mention the place is tiny?  Each time we got up to use the restroom, a server would come by and refold our napkin.  While this was welcomed at first- the servers got flustered and each napkin was fold messier than the last causing another server to run over and refold it.  Ay caramba!  I know this may sound trivial but I think the dining experience at Le Bernadin may have ruined me anything less than perfect.  \n\nFinally, after we finished our meal and left the restaurant- no one greeted us goodbye.   Did I already mention the place is tiny?  When we left the restaurant- I realized that they still  had my coat and had to run back inside.  This time, the GM ran back to go get it but somehow magically ended up outside the restaurant with my coat when I was still waiting for him at the hostess stand.  For this tardiness, lack of service, inhibited menu and overall forgetfulness of the staff- I think Atelier Crenn is not worth its two star rating.", "author": "Betty L."}

Fun, innocuous.\n\n***UNDER THE MIDNIGHT GLOW, I CAN TASTE THE SWEETNESS OF THE SEA (Uni, Caviar, Licorice)\n\nGorgeous uni torchon pudding, smoked potato clear gel, beautifully unfishy caviar. Oh please more.\n\n***HEAR MELLOW SERENADES OF COLORS LICORICE & ORANGE (Oyster, Green Apple, Tobacco Leaf)\n\nFishy oyster, sweet stewed apple, coffee flavor overwhelmed tobacco. Fun minus fishy.\n\n***I TOUCH THE EARTH & PLAY (Salsify, Cauliflower, White Chocolate)\n\nLooks like \"cinnamon & cream\", actually roasted salsify root, like a sweet potato fry with rich dark smoked skin. Dip into cauliflower white chocolate cream with crunchy cocoa nibs. Stunningly yummy & fun. \n\n***WHERE THE BROAD OCEAN LEANS AGAINST THE SPANISH LAND (Squid, Iberico Ham, Lardo)\n\nA 1 bite charm of delight--soft creamy ham hock w/ completely un-seafoody squid & potato & garlic. Sitting in a thick clear broth with black truffle specks that didn't really pay its way.\n\n***I REMEMBER AN OCEANIC FEELING (Shima Aji, Beet, Turnip)\n\nA salty \"snow\" dusting--uhh? Salty turnip puree, amaranth had earthy (ie dirt) flavor like beet, pickled turnip. Striped jack was smoky but not fishy, oily crunch of tempura leaves. Mildly interesting.\n\n***HERE, THE EARTH PROFFERS ITS JUICY, VERMILION GIFTS (Tomato, Avocado, Nasturtium)\n\nFirst a little shiso sorbet (like Benu), a tad salty. Meh. Then a clear broth identical in flavor to Campbell's Tomato, two savory blobs of tomato paste (the chunky one otherworldly). Perfect basil. Poached tomato was warm, soft, light. Tamari panna cotta meh, smoked avocado paste actually okay. A strong contender.\n\n***AND ABOVE, THE HALF MOON FLOATS, SILKY & SMOKY (Charred Onion Soup, Comte, Truffle)\n\nSoup had savory burnt flavor, sweet onion marmalade ring, Comte dumpling a cheesy & doughy delight. Cider gel\u00e9e pleasant as expected. A plus.\n\n***IN SUMMER'S GREEN DAPPLED LIGHT (Peas, Sorrel, Green Strawberry)\n\nLovely presentation, meh taste. Pickled green strawberries are hip, but too crunchy & not yum. Sorrel & sake sorbet--would've loved to have tasted any sake. Pea ice was bland & meh.\n\n***THE FOREST RADIANT WITH POSSIBILITY (Carrot Jerky)\n\nServed like a slug on an actual mossy branch. Basically chewy dried carrot with a layer of dried orange. Sweet tangy glaze. Cute but unmemorable.\n\n***NATURE REJOICE! CHASING CHILDHOOD MEMORIES (Grains & Seeds, Sturgeon, Dashi)\n\nYer standard grain & roe dish, Quinoa & buckwheat, flax, sunflower, pumpkin seeds for crunchiness, roe for softness, except they were so thick that it was difficult to pop in your mouth, so meh. Frozen pearl of smoked sturgeon--pretty but meh.\n\n***FEELING THE BLACK SAND UNDER MY TOES, I DREAMED OF (Wagyu, Squid Ink, Horseradish)\n\nWhat the eff--we upgraded to the Chef's Grand Tasting Menu just for the Wagyu only to find that it's literally smaller than a fruit roll-up. Tiny, soft, lightly glazed--nothing special. Leaves, bread crumbs, tiny apple sauce. Super disappointment.\n\n***THESE CREATURES' LANGUID MOVEMENTS (Lobster, Sweetbread, Seaweed)\n\nFishy lobster bisque, creamy phytoplankton & bone marrow dumplings, crispy sweetbreads. Served with fishy sea grapes & pickled onion. Too fishy.\n\n***WALKING DEEP IN THE WOODS, AS THE EARTH MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SPARE (Mushroom, Pine, Pumpernickel)\n\nWatch your teeth, the pumpernickel dust is hard as sand. Big boring marinated Chinese mushrooms. Pine meringue transparent in flavor. Leaves. Meh.\n\n***BIRD SONG, SEE THE WATER RIPPLING FROM THEIR VISIT (Pintade, Cabbage, Ume Boshi)\n\nGuineafowl destroys quail, seriously. Tender & juicy w/ crispy fatty skin. Dried cabbage was a perfect match. Pickled leeks with \u6885\u5b50 was okay good. A positive. \n\n***A TOKEN OF THE SUMMER (Salad)\n\nA little mignardises made of Banyuls vinegar meringue, topped with olive oil jam, adorned w/ edible greens. It's a tiny tart that was in fact a crunchy bite-sized salad. I stand all amazed! +1\n\n***SUMMER HAS COME, THE SEA BECKONS (The Sea)\n\nPt 1. Corked vial w/ pineapple consomm\u00e9, blue-green algae, basil seeds, sea grapes. Mildly unappetizing. My vial's exterior had a rotting cheese smell (the culprit of my sickness?)\n\nPt 2. Crystal wafer w/ matcha & seaweed. No green tea flavor, just sugary seaweed. Nasty.\n\nPt 3. Mussel-shaped ice from rice & kasu. Grapefruit + flavorless bubbles. Seaweed shaved ice.

I hate it. Pretentious, stupid, faux \"food.\" Yes I know it's Michelin star and on everybody's bucket list and it has awards up the kazoo . . . we spent an ungodly amount of money on umpteen courses: waiters came with oversized gleaming white plates, set them in front of us--and there was one bite in a massive plate! Initially, I thought, \"Hmm, it's the amuse bouche.\" Uh, no it's no prelude. It is the dish. It's the appetizer and fish course and entree and on and on it went--each time I saw the waiter approaching with a huge white plate, I hoped that we'd get some real substantial food because I was starving! Where's the damn bread? Did we get any? No! I'm naive and simple enough to expect bread at dinner. The waiter sets the plate down, with a flourish always with swagger, and voila--my bite is in there, and btw, I take very small bites, so for me to say that it's a bite of food in the plate, is condemnation. We had lots of courses, which were all a bite each--were they interesting? Yes. Were they tasty? No. Did they sway me to the moon and make me swoon? No. Did they leave me feeling satiated? No. Were the courses beautiful to look at? Yes. Were they presented gorgeously? Yes. Was this a phenomenal sample of molecular gastronomy cooking? Yes. But here's what happened: it was my birthday, and we spent hundreds (with zero alcohol because we do not drink). And when we walked out the door late at night, my husband and I were hungry :-(! So we went to In and Out Burger drive thru :-)! Should this happen after going to a restaurant with so many courses? We are each not big eaters, but still, we left hungry--this is not a good sign. When I was in my 30's and 40's, I used to enjoy experiments on my plate, be open to chi chi stuff no matter the pretentiousness . . . I might've liked this in my younger years. But now in my mid 50's, I want pristine fresh ingredients simply and beautifully prepared with bold explosive flavors, no fuss and not glorified with presentation. I want tasty down to earth food with human portions, not bird portions. Btw, I didn't like the acoustics--all hard surfaces, no softening efforts, so noise reverberates and bounces everywhere, making it waaay too loud. I found the environment austere, though if I were to match the food to the surroundings, this would be the perfect match. Each course comes with a \"poem\" written by the chef. Why are her diners forced to read this as a prelude to eating a course? It actively ruined whatever I was about to bite into. After all, it was one single bite. I should not have to be subject to the whimsy of a chef who fancies herself chef and poet all in one . . . please for the love of real writers, do not subject your diners to your ego. Indulge in your delusions about being a writer on your own time. I do not get why this is supposed to be \"French\" food--what's \"French\" about it? The \"food\" here gives French cuisine a bad rep, because you'll be paying hundreds for a an edible chemical experiment on an oversized plate.

There were 20 something different dishes and we got an additional 3 course upgrade that included caviar, lobster risotto, and wagyu beef. \n\nThe grand tasting menu and poem were beautiful and delicious. My partner and I loved all of it save for a porcini broth dish with egg yolk and duck liver mousse (the mouse was amazing but the rest was just weird). All of the dishes were beautiful but my favorites were the ones with soup/broth additions (except for the porcini one). The squab with the butternut squash and jasmine tea broth was amazing. All of the dessert courses were wonderful.\n\nThe 3 course upgrade was nice but did not really add to our experience. We found out that although we love truffle oil we do not love truffles. Both the risotto (which was probably the best risotto I had in my life) and the wagyu could have done without the truffles. The caviar with fermented egg and creme fraiche (I think) was good but we had sturgeon roe caviar in another course and that one was better. I think the tasting menu is great without the additions. The additions don't hurt but they do detract from the menu a bit.\n\nFor daters: \n\nIf you and your date want an intimate setting then this place may not be for you. The tables are seated rather close to each other and this can be distracting. The woman at the table next to us kept flashing her phone camera at every dish, made her partner hold dishes up for her to take photos of, sounded very upset about how \"sugary\" the food was (despite the staff saying there were primarily only natural sugars in most of the dishes), and called to make reservations are multiple other restaurants while they were there. Her and her \"date\" looked like they may have given up on their relationship. If you are going to do something beautiful like this the put your phone away and send some quality time with the company you are in (even if you were talking about farting uncontrollably throughout a meal at Atelier Crenn and disrupting your neighboring patrons).\n\nMore importantly: \n\nThe tables are longer than normal.

While the service was OK, it pales in comparison to the French Laundry, for example. Do you like spending a large portion of your meal talking with servers and the manager? Neither do I. Or how about a server needing to go back to the kitchen to ask when we asked her a simple question about what was in one of the dishes? This would NEVER happen at a true Michelin starred restaurant. The service is really not the big problem here however. The multi course meal has one or two hits, but mostly pretentious, flavorless misses. For example, there is one dish called \"Fish and Chips\". I am NOT a picky eater. I have eaten rat in Vietnam and enjoyed it, but this dish was one of the worst things I have ever put in my mouth. Gelatinized swordfish bone marrow with a minuscule helping (quite literally six or eight hairlike strands) of fried potato. It was like eating fishy snot, but without the satisfaction of clearing out your nose. I'll spare you a course by course (presentation by presentation?) autopsy, just know that you won't be enjoying most of them very much. Mostly your thoughts will be \"Interesting, but not particularly tasty\". The only really tasty dish was the Wagyu beef. Nobody can screw up Wagyu beef, but then again I can cook that at home and save myself $600.  Is this kind of \"experience\" really what you want to spend $600 per couple on (not including wine)? If you're still undecided, then keep reading. \nThe pretentious nature of this place is brought home by the fact that you aren't brought out dishes or courses, you are brought \"presentations\". The emphasis is on plating, not on flavor. Trust me, you will not be wowed by flavor here. Frankly, even much of the plating is not that pretty. It just exists to feed the ego of the chef. When you need an explanation from the server (which we failed to get several times) on how to eat a course, you have traveled much too far down the path of form before function. By the end, I was looking forward to the dessert courses because really, how can you screw up dessert? They managed to do this through yet another combination of sadly lacking flavor and incredibly pretentious plating and \"presentation\". Do we really need a rotating Mayan temple with carvings representing the desserts brought to the table? You are then scolded for rotating it because you'll \"spoil the surprise\". Would you like a corn \"dessert\" chip that tastes of just corn and nothing else with that one chip representing the entire course? Or perhaps a shaved ice of the pulp of a cacao pod, that tastes very much like just ice? How about a faux vanilla bean cradled in a hand modeled in chocolate, where you are chided to \"not eat the hand\". If you are served a dish where you need to be instructed not to eat an edible portion of the plating, the chef's sanity has to be questioned. If those sound like great desserts to you, by all means give this place a try. If not, go elsewhere because that is what almost all of these ridiculous dishes are like. Anybody who feels that this is what two star dining is supposed to be like, has never been to a better restaurant. \nSo, save your $300 per person and go to the French Laundry or Gary Danko, or almost anywhere else and you'll be much happier. If, through this review, I can get you to spend your money at a restaurant that actually deserves your business rather than here, then this review has served it's purpose.

Atelier Crenn has been on the top of my list since it opened!! This place combines my two favorite things, food and nature. Dinner lasted four hours and it was surprisingly not as packed as I thought it would be. Maybe it has to do with the fact that we had 8pm reservations and were one of the last people there. There were at least five different people dining there alone while we were there btw. \n\nMy friend and I both got the tasting menu that ended up being far too much food. The last three courses were intense as we tried to finish them. I am currently eating a salted caramel I took home with me since it was wrapped and its fucking amazing. I was surprised at the number of dessert courses. Perfect for a sweet tooth like mine! We also got the supplemental cheese course but I felt really bad since I was so full I could hardly eat any of it. \n\nWe got two glasses of champagne to start and he ordered a bottle of white wine. I honestly have no idea what kind of wine it was. The waiter didn't even show it to me before he poured it haha. I was all wtf but my friend told me he showed it to him while I was in the bathroom. I also almost locked myself in the bathroom since I forgot it was a sliding door. \n\nThe menu is a poem and each stanza is a course. Isn't that nuts? I had never seen anything like it before. There were so many textures and colors. Cold, crunchy, crispy, creamy (how come everything is starting with the letter C? ooo Crenn!) I think its the first molecular gastronomy restaurant I've ever been to. Not even going to front like I knew what I was eating half the time. From where we were sitting we could see inside the kitchen too and they had a ton of people back there! Oh and the back of the menu had a letter Dominique wrote to her father? It was something like that and it was so sad I almost started tearing up! \n\nThe staff was, for lack of a better word, extremely well trained. They were pretty on top of it and when there was nothing to do, they would just stand against the wall, ready for anything. They were all crazy good looking and well dressed too. The ambiance was really relaxed and soothing. Not at all pretentious. I have no idea what all these other reviews are talking about. This has to be the least pretentious restaurant I've ever been to which says a lot considering it was the most expensive dinner of my life.\n\nThe only negative was the valet. It was seriously whack. Its on a corner a block away from the restaurant. Its really easy to miss and we did end up missing it. I wouldn't even have noticed it if my friend didn't say anything. Then at the end of dinner the waiter said \"they were nice enough to drop off your keys.\" Um, what? We ended up having to walk around trying to figure out where the hell my car was parked and it was on a random street. Isn't the whole point of the valet to bring your car back to you??\n\n**Dominique has since received two Michelin stars making her the first woman in the U.S. to get two. Hip hip hooray!", "author": "Tiffany V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-20", "description": "Yes, it is a little bit silly and pretentious to present your menu as a poem, but chef/owner Dominique Crenn seems to have some reasons for doing it. She is inspired by her childhood and her father, an artist whose paintings decorate the restaurant. The plate is the canvas for her art.\n\nWe made a game of guessing the courses based on the poem -  a diversion that was necessary because of the extremely long wait in between courses. I understand the need to pace out a long tasting menu, but this was excessive. We were there for 4+ hours and I was literally falling asleep between courses. I'm not sure if that is the usual pace, or if the kitchen was struggling because they were hosting a wedding in their private event space. Luckily the food was excellent and so beautiful that we continued to get excited with each new course. \n\n\"Summer has come and is full of sweet surprises\" - a white chocolate shell filled with apple cider and topped with cassis gel, meant to be a fun take on the Kir Breton cocktail. I really enjoyed this - both the taste and the way it instantly broke on the tongue to release the liquid center. A fun start.\n\n\"Under the midnight glow, I can taste the sweetness of the sea,\" - oyster poached in its own liquid. Forgettable, sadly.\n\n\"hear mellow serenades of colors licorice and orange\" - urchin torchon with caviar, licorice root, and yuzu foam. So good (obviously).\n\n\"I touch the earth and play\" - roasted salsify root dipped in a cauliflower and white chocolate puree. Unexpected and surprisingly delicious.\n\n\"Where the broad ocean leans against the Spanish land,\" - thin, noodle-like strands of squid and lardo in an iberico ham consomme with truffles. The squid was soft with just the right amount of chew, the lardo melted on the tongue, it was boldly salty - excellent.\n\n\"I remember an oceanic feeling\" - shima aji sashimi with beet \"snow\". Very good.\n\n\"Here, the earth proffers its juicy, vermilion gifts\" - shiso sorbet, poached tomato in tomato broth with basil. I wasn't overly impressed with this course.\n\n\"and above, the half moon floats, silky and smoky\" - a take on French onion soup with Comte cheese, apple cider gelee, onion marmalade, and charred onion broth. Enjoyable, but not super memorable.\n\n\"In its cool, milky light,\" - a frozen palate cleanser - I can't remember the flavor!\n\n\"the forest still radiant with possibility\" - a dehydrated carrot jerky, served to look like a slug on a branch. They are very proud of this, it apparently took them years to figure it out and days to make it. I thought it was creative, but not really worth all the effort and fuss, even though the carrot flavor was intensified.\n\n\"Nature rejoice! chasing childhood memories\" - a bowl of toasted (fried?) grains and seeds (quinoa, flax, sunflower seed, pumpkin seed) with trout roe and frozen pearlized sturgeon cream, and a dashi broth poured table side. This was very interesting with the crunchy seeds, the broth starting to soften things, the salty pops of roe, and the frozen pearls. All kinds of texture and flavor going on. I'm inspired to try to make something like this at home (good luck, right?).\n\n\"Feeling the black sand under my toes, I dreamed of\" - a thin piece of raw wagyu beef, rolled and served on \"edible soil\" made with squid ink and garnished with mustard seeds, apple gelee, and horseradish. Very good.\n\n\"these creatures' languid movements\" - lobster bisque with poached lobster, bone marrow dumplings, and crispy sweetbreads served with sea grapes and pickled onion. I loved it!\n\n\"Walking deep in the woods, as the earth might have something to spare\" - this is THE signature dish of the restaurant: a variety of mushrooms prepared in different ways (pickled, roasted, dried) and served with a pine meringue and pumpernickel crumbs (among other toppings). This was fascinating - so many flavors going on, so different and new. Really just superb.\n\n\"bird song, see the water rippling from their visit\" - tender guinea hen with crispy skin, topped with napa cabbage and baby leeks. Very good protein dish, but again not the most memorable.\n\n\"a token of the summer\" - a \"salad\" that was actually a bite-sized banyuls vinegar meringue topped olive oil gelee and micro herbs and greens. Interesting and fun.\n\nAt this point, there is an optional cheese course.\n\n\"Summer has come, the sea beckons\" - a test tube looking vial filled pineapple consomm\u00e9 and blue-green algae - fun! Also a wafer with matcha & seaweed - interesting, but not great. And lastly - a beautiful bowl of ocean-looking shapes.  Sorbet in the shape of a mussel shell, rice pudding, foam and crumbles - there was a lot going on and I couldn't keep track of it all. But the flavors were grapefruit, green tea, and seaweed and it was heavenly. Definitely the standout of the sweets.\n\n\"sweetness, bounty, thanks\" - mignardes course.\n\nSometimes the creativity got in the way of flavor, but not often, and there were some real standout dishes.", "author": "Sarah C."}

Had a sort of casual and rustic feel but with the fine dining service.  It's more contemporary/progressive and not so traditional.\n\nThere was nothing during the course, that wowed me.  I can't name one thing that I would say I would come back for.  Some dishes were underseasoned, and some were just salty.\n\nThe presentation is AMAZING and they do use contemporary techniques.

We've always felt the experience was worth the financial sacrifice, and have enjoyed dinners at a variety of the \"best\" places San Francisco has to offer. So when our anniversary came around, we thought it would be a great time to try Atelier Crenn. \n\nFor the non-readers out there, I'll cut straight to the to chase - dollar-for-dollar, Atelier Crenn is THE WORST MEAL IN SAN FRANCISCO. \n\nFor the more reading inclined... The restaurant is situated in the marina, across the street from a desperately trendy nightclub where it hides sandwiched somewhere between a dive bar and a pizza parlor. The staff is friendly, but heinously amateur... no one asked if a special occasion brought us to the restaurant, our server never shared their name with us, the sommelier's descriptions of the wine pairings were on par with a kindergarteners description of why they liked their class field trip to the park (it was beautiful, it is nice, I like the park). At one point we asked the host/server to write down a wine we did like - never saw him again. \n\nAdmittedly, the food is good. It has some original moments (like liquid nitrogen at the table), but ultimately the \"most impressive\" food feels more like cheap parlor tricks than real innovation. The flavors don't surpass those of MUCH cheaper options (i.e. Gary Danko), and impresses less than other city's \"boundary pushing\" restaurants. (i.e. Canlis, Alinea). But the real kicker isn't that Atelier Crenn ranks below a slew of local competitors (i.e. Sons & Daughters, or any aforementioned restaurant). The real kicker?\n\nOUR BILL WAS $1800 FOR TWO PEOPLE. \n\nAgain. We're not people who shy away from paying for a great food experience. We've tackled two and three Michelin star restaurants in the past and have never walked away feeling like we didn't get our money's worth. Unfortunately, I can say, without any hesitation, that Atelier Crenn was dollar-for-dollar the worst investment we've ever made in a \"food experience.\" \n\nAtelier Crenn is the \"finally losing your virginity\" of fine restaurants. You've heard it's great, you've seen it on television, and you're pretty sure you're ready to try it out, but when it's all said and done it feels kinda cheap, a bit dirty, and like you may end up paying for it for years to come.", "author": "Neil K."}

If you want to choose what you want to eat then this is not for you since they have set menu. I was glad to experience such elegant fine dining with my bf for his birthday. He wanted to go to a gastronomy restaurant and this was one of the ones I found. I think this was like an 18th course meal but they were all extremely small portion. If you're a meat eater, do not come here since there's not going to be much meat eating here. Every plate felt like a one biter, but filled with amazing flavors leaving you wanting more. They give you a poem in the beginning and each meal you get connects to one of the lines. I wish they tell you each line every time they give you a plate so you can see the correlation between the food and poem since I lost track.   \n\nIf you're don't have all night I suggest you ask them to speed up your dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-21", "description": "At first I was going to give Atelier Crenn 4 stars because the desserts just were not good. Then I thought about how exceptional all the seafood courses were and had to give them a 5!!\n\nMost of the courses were seafood.  2 were vegetables - very enjoyable, 1 was lamb - good, 1 foie gras - very good and the rest the best seafood I have ever had.  Just over the top good.\n\nOn the way home we could not decide which seafood course was our favorite.  The Half Moon Bay uni (first I have had from HMB) with bonito gel and sweet creamed corn was the best uni preparation I have ever had.  The so, so tender abalone was excellent.  The giggly squid which normally I would dislike, was incredibly good.  Smoked salmon in a coconut milk sauce with fresh ikura was intriguing.  Maybe the 4 slices of melt in your mouth mackerel was the best topped with creamy avocado and crispy fried bones.  We were in love.\n\nI am not sure what was going on with the desserts.  They were all presented in very dramatic ways.  But the flavors were very odd as in not good.  2 I found had an offensive flavor.  None were really sweet.  The last dessert which was supposed to be their grand finale visually was presented in a huge, fierce bowl.  It was so complicated in appearance and taste it made me think someone should tell the dessert chef sometimes simple is best.  There were candies as the last little bite that at least sent us off with a sweet taste in our mouths.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was the portion size compared to other Michelin starred restaurants in San Francisco.  Here you got 4 or 5 bites per course instead of the usual 1 that always leaves you wanting more especially when you loved the dish.  \n\nWe also ordered the cheese course, though this was a mistake in that we really were already full, but again a very generous serving for I think an extra $37.\n\nThe bread was delicious.  A Parker House loaf which was warm, soft and a bit salty.\n\nThe meal seemed to be served at a good pace but 4 hours was just too long for us to be seated.  We are old and not only do our butts go flat but to try to stand up after your joints have fused together is not fun.\n\nWe loved the wine pairings and had plenty of wine.  No complaints.  We started with champagne which was not part of the pairings. \n\nA little odd was that they present you with what they say is your menu encased in the most beautiful envelope.  Though no mention of food is made on this menu, beautiful images are conjured up with 1 liners that I guess describes the course in poetic terms.  So I was having fun trying to guess what fish was coming using the menu as a guide.  Soon I was at a loss as the dishes did not seem to correspond to the menu.  At one point I asked the waiter where we were on the menu.  He said the menu really does not correspond to the dinner anymore though once it did.  LOL.  The menu changed too frequently to keep the menu up to date so now it is more of a conceptual thing.  LOL.  So why call it a menu?  \n\nParking seemed to be difficult though we lucked out.\n\nThe restaurant is a small, understated room done in neutral tones.  Tables are set apart so you have privacy in conversation.\n\nThe staff was great with excellent service as you would expect in such a place.\n\nAt the end of the evening, Chef Crenn walked through saying hello to everyone.  This was fun.  She has the best smile!  Though she is so slender I doubt she eats her own cooking.\n\nSo was it worth the $1200 for 2?  I would have to say no meal is worth that but this is what really exquisite menus cost.  Whenever we go to such restaurants, my husband bemoans the cost because he feels it is morally wrong to spend so much on 1 meal when there are hungry people all over the city.  And of course he is correct.  But I always respond that we do not live large as a rule, and this is our only vice.  And we try to be generous to those in need.  \n\nWe are already thinking of going back dreaming of their seafood dishes though hoping the dessert chef does something new.", "author": "Kell M."}

Dominque Crenn is the first female chef in the US to achieve 2-Michelin accolade and I can see why after our dining experience. The whole evening truly was an experience and not just a meal. The menu is a poem to describe each course that follows. We had fun reading the lines and guessing what was to come. \n\nWe both did the Grand Tasting menu ($195) and wine pairing. Service was great, although they did forget our champagne in the beginning and we had to remind them. The food presentation is stunning and inventive. It felt like I was eating a piece of art. Not only was it beautiful, the food was thoughtfully prepared, delicate and absolutely delicious. Crenn uses a lot of seafood in her dishes such as oysters, lobster, trout, sea bream, bonito. She is a master at blending unique flavors such as black currant, sweet melon, or coconut butter into a course so that each bite is unique and exquisite.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-06-22", "description": "This review is pretty long, so the short version:\nFood: 5 stars\nPresentation: 5 stars\nAmbiance: 4 stars (it got a little loud with a rowdy party a few tables down)\nService: 1 star\n\nThe long version:\nMy boyfriend and I went at the beginning of June and we were super pumped about going because we watched the Chef's Table episode on Dominique Crenn just a few days before.  \n\nThe week of our reservation, I got a call to confirm the res and to check if there were any special requests/food allergies.  Unfortunately I missed the call because I was at work, so I called back and it was pretty much impossible to speak with a live human even though they asked me to call back to confirm.  Instead, I hopped online and shot them an email message to confirm and inform the restaurant that my boyfriend has food allergies, specifically mushrooms and beans/legumes.  We emailed back and forth and I thought everything was set. \n   \nWe showed up for our 8pm reservation about 5 minutes early.  We ended up having to wait for the first party to vacate and clear the table.  That was the first sign that something was up with service.  I would expect that at a regular restaurant, but not at a 2 star michelin.  We get seated and the hostess asks us if there are any allergies or special requests and I tell her yes, I had emailed with someone a few days prior to inform the staff.  She apparently knew nothing about any of those emails, so the kitchen staff was not prepared to accomodate the request.  She told us that off the top of her head, the menu should be fine and didn't include any mushrooms or legumes.  We ordered a glass of champagne to begin and we started eating.  The food was delicious and exactly what I was expecting.  After about 3 or 4 small courses, the staff FINALLY asked us about what we would like to do about wine for the rest of the meal.  I think they were expecting us to just ask for the wine pairing, but I opted to choose my own bottle.  I know a little about wine, but I'm not an expert or anywhere near it.  I had to ask for the sommelier to come to our table to make recommendations, rather than the hostess just sending him straight over.  He was very helpful and gave us great recommendations for 2 different wines for the meal.  \n\nThroughout the evening I felt like the service was off.  At a 2 star restaurant, I expect the wait staff to basically have telepathy and all seeing eyes, so I don't have to think or worry about anything.  Things should magically occur without me even realizing that I need something. That was not the case.  There were a handful of times that we had to wait for the staff to pour another glass of wine (it was chilling in a bucket, not at our table).  One of the courses, the server tried to drop the food off at our table without any explanation and then returned a minute later to give one.  We got mushrooms AND legumes during the dinner.  They served my boyfriend the mushroom broth with shiitake mushrooms and served me just the broth, when it was explicitly stated that he is the one with the allergy.  Green peas are a legume and were also served.  So I got double portions on those courses.  \nAdditionally, at the beginning of the meal my boyfriend slipped away and informed the hostess it was my birthday (I hadn't said anything about it in the emails, but that doesn't matter anyway since they disappeared into space).  The staff didn't bring out any special dessert course out for me, although I've had that done at other high caliber restaurants without any problems.  \n\nMy overall review, great and beautiful food, but service is VERY much lacking.  I've eaten at Saison, Cyrus, La Folie and a few other 1 star restaurants so I know what to expect.  Part of spending $1000 on a meal like that is not just the food, but the service.  I can get food close in quality at many restaurants without the massive tab.  I can't imagine that Atelier Crenn would keep a 2 star rating with service like that for long.  Hope that we were just an odd case, but I don't think that that's the situation.  At this point, I would not return or recommend Atelier Crenn and wish that I had gone to another restaurant with far superior service.", "author": "Mary V."}

Overall, it's more of an artistic rather than a culinary experience. A lot of emphasis is placed on presentation, appearance, and creativity as opposed to only flavor. That said, all of the dishes were both beautiful AND tasty. \n\nThe tasting menu is presented in the form of a poem and each line is meant to describe the characteristics of a dish. It's really clever and Chef Crenn creates the poem and menu herself. The staff told us that the menu usually changes and gets tweaked once the seasons change, but some of the dishes are so classic that they are pretty much always on the menu.\n\nThe service was really excellent, note that the meal will likely take 3-4 hours, and the restaurant can be a little bit hard to find. There's no big sign and the only indication it gives to the outside world is through light embroidery stitching in its white curtains. I'd highly advise trying to find it based on the address number.

But I too have had my share of fine Western & Euro dining in the past. Waaaaaay before the days of Yelp or social media, I've actually been to Boulevard, Masa, Watergate/Waterfront, La Folie, Fleur de Lys, Fifth Floor, Tommy Toys, Gary Danko, Aqua, Farallon, even the French Laundry for lunch to name a few. But many of those adventures were pre-Yelp (and pre-social media quite frankly). While eating broad and wide enriches your mind and knowledge of food and culture, it certainly is not a substitute for traveling abroad, but at least is a lot easier. However at the end of the day, we sometimes just end up going back to what we are familiar with and grew up loving.\n\nBut once in a while, something so out of the box comes along, yet creative, wonderous, and beautiful, that you are just struck dumb. And that is exactly what Atelier Crenn does to you.\n\nWhile I have no problem dining solo at high end sushi restaurants, or perhaps even kaiseki...something of this caliber would be best enjoyed with like minded friends (or a hot date). So if you have a friend who prefers cheap dirty food (or the type who has Costco samples for lunch and strangely looks forward to that), I suggest you not take them along.\n\nAll I can say is, if you managed to secure a reservation here, go big, or go home. And that is, get the $180 grand tasting menu so you can see for yourself what Chef Dominique Crenn and her crew are truly capable of. Be prepared for 3.5 to 4 hours of pure enjoyment. As always good food is an experience meant to be shared, with good friends, good conversation, and of course a kickass bottle of wine. What's that word? YOLO, or some BS like that?\n\nThose who have dined here already know the MO. The menu reads like a beautiful poem, where each line represents a theme of the dish, which only leaves you guessing/speculating....which is part of the thrill.\n\nWe shared a beautiful bottle of Drew Morning Dew 2010 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir (good luck finding one in the stores).\n\nSome standouts\n\nAmuse Bouche: A delicate almost white chocolate esque sphere to be gently picked up and put into your mouth, which disintegrates and out bursts a juicy fruity liquid, almost apple cider-esque, really refreshing. If only Xiao long bao could be done like that, then the Chinese food nerds will be happy.\n\n2nd item: oyster and uni. Sorry for the lack of description, but one cannot help but notice a very Japanese kaiseki inspired approach to the dishes, from the aesthetics, to the use of konbu dashi, where a small portion packs a huge wallop of flavor.\n\nOne of the offerings was a shima aji (trevally) sashimi with a tempura style radish (probably the best tempura in town, to what it should really be like). The photos alone do not do this justice. If you closed your eyes, I would say Atelier Crenn is like our own version of RyuGin (Tokyo/Hong Kong) in some ways, at least for this dish. Maybe that's not the right comparision but AC deserves this recognition.\n\nThen there's the very wonderful delicate bisque, that on the surface looks like bubble bath. The foam actually has the taste of tomatoes which is awesome. Upon spooning away the foam, is a very intense and rich shellfish stock flavor (made with razor clam). Enjoy each sip slowly, this is not your uncle's clam chowder.\n\nOne of the more striking items was a carrot jerky resting on a tree log, where the jerky was wrapped around dried orange peel. Now the old world in me is tasting all sorts of interesting flavors....from the dried orange peel used in Cantonese red bean soups....to part of the marinade in the Hai Ky Mi Gia duck leg noodle. Yet somehow this is all so profound.\n\nOne of the followup palate cleansers looked like a black gemstone sitting on a black rock. But it had a similar effect to the first amuse bouche. Just incredible.\n\nAnother favorite dish of mine was like \"Japanese cereal\", various grains and \"rice crispy\" like textures that I'm guessing included buckwheat of some sort, ikura served with a heavily deep flavored broth (dashi of some sort) that had to be experienced. And then there was the other dish where duck consomm\u00e9 was added tableside that was just heavenly. And the mixed mushrooms.\n\nHeck, everything was fantastic. In addition to each course being a surprise, they each progressively packed a bigger punch.\n\nChef Crenn greeted everyone in the dining room, and it was truly a delight to meet her and offer our thanks and praise.\n\nWhen a meal like this leaves you almost speechless, pondering how Chef Crenn's thought process of conceptualizing a dish and turning it not just into reality, but a true stunning masterpiece, and makes you wonder philosophically and keep talking about it non stop to your dining companions, and smiling throughout, it means she has reached the pinnacle of her profession, and can still do so much more.\n\nA well deserved 2 Michelin stars!", "author": "Ken K."}

Every single dish regardless of how large or small, was created with immense detail and nothing felt lackluster. \n\nAtelier Crenn really does transcend above a typical dining experience to take you on a journey with different flavors, presentations, and ideas.

What stood out the most was the decoration and presentation of each dish. They were all even more beautiful and exotic than the ones at Baume, which already specializes in that. I suppose it takes the touch of the female head chef (the only one in the world with a 2-Michelin-starred restaurant) to create such a gorgeous menu.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about looks. Regarding taste, the dishes here were more enjoyable than the best ones at Manresa and French Laundry. The experience was much like that of Fleur de Lys in that every dish was delicious. There wasn't a single dish that was so exotic or detached from human understanding that a simpleton like me couldn't enjoy it.\n\nAnd the service was flawless.

Chef Dominique Crenn's presentations transcend all boundaries of taste, touch, smell and sight, and I don't find it bad that they don't allow cell phone usage in the restaurant. Because a photo simply wouldn't do the dishes justice.\n\nWe went on Saturday when they only serve the grand tasting menu. Once we settled down, we got a piece of paper with a poem on it. Apparently that was the menu. The poem was very autumn themed and the dishes consisted of a lot of seasonal offerings.\n\nThere were a lot of very interesting, innovative dishes. Some had Asian flairs (ochazuke), others Californian (multiple seafood dishes). My favourite dish was when they took out a pot of living Eucalyptus plant. The chef had crafted 2 Eucalyptus-mint popsicles on broken-off branches. While I was savoring it, I felt like I was in an Eucalyptus forest, surrounded by mist and fog. It was delicious and that was only a palate cleanser!\n\nEvery dish felt as crafted as that one, and I certainly wouldn't do it any justice just by describe it with my clumsy words. The staff there had been very professional -- replacing one of my dishes because I destroyed it when I picked it up (oh cocoa shells), and pacing us so we wouldn't get stuffed too quickly. The sommelier had many good recommendations. You would also see the chef circling through the tables, talking to the guests and making you feel welcome. This is the ultimate taste experience that also feels very personal and non-pretentious.\n\nI really, really want to go back again soon.

Chef Crenn is the only female in the US to earn 2 Michelin stars...can we say girl power?! \n\nTiny, but important details I wish other restaurants would take note of: \n-- no tablecloths & no stuffy or over-the-top fancy decor. Just a simple, clean space. \n-- waiter introduced each dish, answered any questions, then SCRAMMED! I love that they didn't check on us WHILE we ate. Nothing worse than shoving a bite-full in & then having the clueless waiter ask, \"how's everything?\" when you know they don't really care. Waitstaff here exhibited professionalism, their years of valuable experience evident, so thank you. \n-- accommodated my weird food issues, really listened, asked questions, then suggested a vegetarian tasting (great call; again, thank you.) \n\nBFF & I opted for the \"Chef's Grand Tasting Menu\" -- about 18 courses in all for $180 (& a glass of wine each.) About 4-5 courses were one-bite goodies, some exploded yummy liquids in our mouths. There were 3 dessert courses (freaking epic presentation.) Menu consists not of ingredients, but a poem, with each line hinting at your upcoming dish. \n\nThere's no way I can detail every single course, but I'd like to document my faves (do not read if you want to be surprised):\n-- one-bite salad was a minuscule olive oil meringue w/ microgreens...smallest, cutest carrot (height of my pinky nail, maybe) I've ever laid eyes on \n-- version of adult \"cereal\"...nuts, grains, other crunchy bits in a heavenly, savory broth\n-- course of various mushrooms. Dish has been served since day one, and with good reason. \n-- desserts...pastry chef painstakingly decorated each dish: test tube-like shot of guava...wine bottle-turned-boat-turned-vessel for ice cream made to look like grapes/granita/goat cheese. Pay attention to what your waiter does with the cork; cigar  cutter is on the table for a reason...finally, mignardises on glass (see pic.) \n\nAn unforgettable 4-hour experience.

The parking situation is actually not as dismal as the rest of SF - there's a parking garage (Lombard garage) only about 1-2 blocks away that is reasonably empty! \n\nI was SO excited about this place after seeing pictures and reading reviews, so it was only fitting that I try Atelier Crenn out for my birthday. The staff was all extremely friendly, and we were started on our meal right away.\n\nOur poem was presented in the cutest silver envelope - at a total of 18 courses, I was pretty sure I was going to be stuffed by the end, and I was right. Also, the poem is supposed to give you hints about what the course was going to be like but I was practically never right (lol).\n\nTHE FOOD: Everything was amazing - particularly the uni - and is crafted to perfection, whether it's sprinkling cucumber ice or shaving truffles onto the dish. Every dish has a very earthy-feel to it and seems to emanate the essence and simplicity of northern California. \n\nTHE VENUE: Definitely a little hard to find - I spent a good 5 minutes walking around while looking at Google Maps only to realize that I had been passing it the entire time, but the interior is dimly lit and very simple with more of a modern feel. \n\nOverall, I would highly, highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fancier dinner spot for a special occasion but don't want something that seems overly fancy or stuffy in any way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-13", "description": "*3.5 stars*\n\nI knew I was in for something special when I came to Atelier Crenn. Two Michelin stars, molecular gastronomy, one of the most talked about chefs in Dominique Crenn -- it had to be amazing. And it really was. The food here is wildly creative, uniquely flavorful, and presented so beautifully that to eat it would be a tragedy in the art world. \n\nThere were so many incredible things going for it: (1) The food was delicious, (2) the sommelier was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and (3) the ambiance was intimate and refined. Dominique Crenn is an absolutely genius when it comes to her food.\n\nUnfortunately, the disappointments came with the service. Now, the service was good in the sense that they were attentive (water & wine always filled) and the dishes were brought and taken away simultaneously for the table. For a Michelin-starred restaurant, those are givens. However, the servers (except for the awesome sommelier) were all emotionless robots. Monotone and quiet, they all seemed like they hated their jobs. There wasn't even an iota of friendliness in their voices whatsoever, and it kind of dampened the experience drastically. When each dish was served, it would be served silently and then with a brief and boring description -- completely making us unexcited about whatever we were about to eat.\n\nThe worst part was that they completely didn't do anything for my friend's birthday. Now, I mentioned to them TWICE before the dinner (when I was making the reservation and again, when I confirmed the reservation) that the dinner was to celebrate \"Alice's birthday.\" On the phone, the receptionist even said: \"Oh yeah, I have that written down. Don't worry, we'll have something nice for her.\" During the actual dinner, however, nothing. No candle, no \"Happy Birthday\" written with chocolate, not even a verbal \"Happy birthday.\" For a two-Michelin starred restaurant of this caliber, such negligence should NEVER occur. Unfortunately it did, and we had to have a depressingly anti-climatic \"yeah.... so... happy birthday, I guess\" moment outside. I wouldn't come back solely for that part of the experience.\n\nAlso, from my friends' experiences with Atelier Crenn, Dominique Crenn always comes out to say hello to the guests. Definitely not this time.\n\nNow the food itself was excellent for the most part -- the \"adult cereal\" (seeds & grains) and the mixed mushroom dish were delicious. The \"beet\" dessert (beet sorbet w/ chocolate \"root\") was incredible. The \"Sea\" dish (fresh uni, hamachi, and clam) was refreshing and it included this extremely delicious cocaine-like powder that instantly dissolved in my mouth. The cheese platter had one of the best blue cheeses I've ever had. The squab was well-cooked, although it lacked a powerful flavor that made it dissolve into the background of our meal. Every dish was beautiful and creative, and I believe it really was worth the price.\n\nThe service, however, just disappointed me so much that even the greatest food in the world couldn't make it worth it, especially at this price point.", "author": "Roy C."}

And finally we are here for an anniversary + birthday dinner with the Grand Tasting menu.\n\nConclusion: Very beautiful dinner. Solid techniques and creative ingredients and cooking methods. But started \"slow\" (first a few dishes were not impressive) and the current course has too much Japanese influence that the only thing that wow-ed me was actually the tomatos and 'the sea' at the end. I would have to say, Manresa is not as poetic, but overall I liked their foods better. But don't get me wrong, Chef Crenn's 2-star is well deserved.\n\nThe earlier courses were delicate and light:\n1. Kir Breton - nice hors d'oeuvre with a clean liqueur taste and soft white chocolate\n\n2. uni custard caviar, licorice, oyster, green apple, tobacco leaf, salsify, cauliflower sauce - three items. uni custard and caviar worked well together. I can have a bit more uni flavor in the custard, but it might fight with the caviar. The oyster had very little flavor. Was killed by the green apple. Salsify stick in cauliflower sauce was very interesting. It was a \"tasty pestle\".\n\n3. squid, jberico ham, lardo - again, very delicate squid, nicely cut and placed. the truffle soup was nice and comforting.\n\n4. Shima Aji, beet \"snow\", turnip - very light. The beet snow was beautiful. Turnip offered little flavor. The aji was nicely smoky, which I like, but rather common nowadays. \n\nThings started to pick up from here\n\n5. Tomato 3 way, avocado mousse, nasturitium - WOW the the flavor is finally coming in. Yes tomato is an amazing plant. And sun drying (if I recall correctly) just double, tripled the flavor. I've had similar dish before, but never get tired of this. The sorbet that come with it was interesting. I forgot what's in it but tasted more like cucumber or bitter melon.\n\n6. Charred Onion Soup, comte, Truffle - very comfortable onion soup, comte cheese dumpling and tangy fruit sauce, all very playful.\n\n7. Peas, Sorrel, Green Strawberry - palete cleanser. Nice and refreshing. pea sprouts is quite playful.\n\n8. Carrot Jerky - I liked it. Very strong earthy flavor and nice citrus caramel. Although my gf thought it was nothing special - more like a dried fruit, as she said it.\n\n9. Grains & Seeds, Sturgeon dashi - I enjoyed this quite a bit. crispy and fragrant, in nice comforting dashi broth. \n\n10. Wagyu, Squid ink powder, Hourse radish - Hokkaido rank A wagyu is quite good for the ones that's permitted to export out of Japan. The other components in this dish was a bit chaotic though. Too many things going on at the same time.\n\n11. Lobster biscque, sweet bread, seaweed - perfectly done lobster bisque. Although this is something I cook from time to time as well, I still enjoyed it. It's not easy to get the clean flavor like they did. The bread was very nice and crispy. I had similar bread in Japan, but man it's hard to find decent bread in the US (totally first world problem).\n\n12. \"walk in the forest\" various mushrooms, pine, pumpernickel - I love mushrooms. Especially when they are cooked right.\n\n13 Pintada Cabbage Ume boshi - A strip of (probably broiled) hen. Juicy. dehydrated cabbage was playful. I didn't notice the ume boshi actually (picked plum)\n\n14: Salad - one bit salad, interesting concept and fun, but not impressed by the taste of it.\n\nAnd to the desserts.\n\n15. The Sea - beautiful beautiful dessert. Feel like I could smell the ocean out of it, but they are all sweets. The \"mussel\" looked like a real one although it was a cake. This was a visual wow and taste very good, too. An unique CRENN experience.\n\n16. Mignardises - three courses of different chocolates and mini macaroons in beautiful treasure boxes, wood log jewelry box. Very playful. The macaroons were tasty and it must be hard to make it so small and consistent.\n\n\nOther notes:\n- I like the decor and atmosphere, but it's definitely not photo friendly (which might be exactly what the chefs want lol). It's a bit of waste for the beautiful presentation. But I'm sure there will be someone coming in with nice SLR to capture the moments. \n\n- I asked my server to recommend wine, she suggested we can split a white first then a red. But the red wine was a total waste with this seafood centric menu. The time I wanted red wine with the french onion soup, I only had whites at hand :(. I wish the servers had more knowledge about matching wine to the menu.", "author": "Lance C."}

From the menu that is a poem to the amazing service to the beautifully executed and unique and flavorful dishes, this restaurant has it all.\n\nI had the grand tasting paired with wines and by the midway point the sommelier and I were chatting about his wine selections.  He gave me an \"extra\" since he saw I was very much into wine.  That alone exemplifies what great service is all about.  But there were so many people waiting on me, I felt like a king.  All of them seemed knowledgeable and professional.\n\nThe dishes were out of this world in taste and especially creativity, such as the carrot \"jerky\" that was simply a carrot so dehydrated that it was tiny and covered with some kind of sauce that was reduced.  You had to find it on a moss-covered branch.  Yes, I kid you not.  Just wonderfully amazing, and although the portions are small, I got so many of them that I did not leave hungry.  Another highlight I could mention was the wagyu beef carpaccio rolled into a cigar shape with its various accoutrements.  Mignardises in wooden boxes, one of them with pebbles in it that looked like the macaroons so you had to look for them.  Just amazing.  I opted for an extra cheese course, which seemed very out of place with the rest of the menu, and I mentioned that one of the waiters and he said something like the chef thinks that cheese is always good with a meal.\n\nThe food in this place is very serious and also a level or two above even the finest dining experiences.  It is on a par with Noma for its whimsy and creativity and not as frenetic as Alinea, nor as slavishly devoted to molecular gastronomy, although it is certainly used judiciously here.

That attitude will also probably soften the blow when the bill comes.\n\nThat said, this was probably the best meal of my life.\n\nI won't run down everything we had in our four-hour and probably around 15 course meal but here are a few highlights. There were a few dishes dedicated to seafood, including a few different kinds of roe wrapped in cucumber and sprinkled with cucumber ice, as well as a couple courses dedicated to the duck, which alone was enough to make the meal memorable. Just when you're starting to wonder how much more there could possibly be, there are 3-4 dessert courses. I'm not normally a big dessert person but each one of these courses surprised me both in presentation and how layered the flavors were.\n\nI read one rather pretentious review of Atelier Crenn, asking whether it was food or art. After the four hour presentation, I have to say that I understand the debate much better. There are multiple moments during the meal where you just marvel at the craft of the food, like the creamed pear that is dipped into liquid nitrogen and served on a leaf or the moment when the trumpet fish is laid across your table. I hate the people who have their phones out taking pictures the whole meal but I have to say that I do regret not getting some photos of a few of the different courses.\n\nI found the service to be very knowledgeable and genuine without feeling stuffy. We opted for the classic wine pairing (about $150) vs the deluxe ($395) and really enjoyed the som. Each server seemed to have a thorough understanding of the preparation and sourcing of each dish, without ever making it feel like a dog and pony show. There were a couple time where I felt like I was waiting a little too long between courses but the som was always quick to top you off if you finished your wine before the food came out.\n\nThe bottom line is still that this is a meal I'll remember forever. The $550 per person bill was probably close to twice as expensive as anything I've had before but it's hard to complain when your expectations were completely blown out of the water.", "author": "Peter I."}

Atelier Crenn has easily given us two of the best meals we've had in San Francisco.\n\nTo start, the service is amazing. The staff really notices your concerns (as in food allergies). They tell you about every dish you have and the contents/details of it. The wine guy is extremely knowledgeable - he can tell you back stories about any of the wines and give considerate suggestions.\n\nThe food is unlike any experience I've had. Not just because it's delicious (that seems pretty common in SF) but because of how it's prepared. Each dish comes on a plate specific to the purpose of the dish. For instance, we had a carrot jerky served on a branch, a honey themed dessert in a beehive, and oysters in shells. There is a ton of creativity built into the meals they serve, starting with a poem to describe the meal, staff to tell you about each dish, a visual experience viewing the meal, and the actual taste itself.\n\nYes this restaurant is super expensive, but it's definitely worth it!", "author": "Emily L."}

We also appreciated that they accommodated us and our tardiness, which I'm sure can be a pain to coordinate with the logistics of a 16 course meal.\n\nService? Top notch.\nCreativity?  Come on, you can't beat it.\nQuality of food?  Rivals any other Michelin restaurant I've tried to date.\nPrice?  Considering the competition, it seems about right.  In general, yeah it's expensive as hell.\n\nI highly recommend the wine pairing.  I've been sorely disappointed with pairings in the past, but they absolutely nailed it.  Most memorable was our 2nd course (cauliflower in butter with reduced onions) paired with a white burgundy -- somehow they made the butter in the food taste oaky, and the chardonnay taste salty.

Two courses in, I and everyone else in our dining party, knew we were in rarified air. By the last bite and the sad, desperate licking of empty plates all around, everyone at our table had run out of superlatives. There aren't too many moments as satisfying as a perfect meal and the pure exhilaration on all six of our faces was, as MasterCard says....priceless. Well, not priceless, there certainly was a bill, but priceless nonetheless.\n\nI'd wager it is inarguable that food has never been better in the history of mankind, as it is at this particular moment in time. On one hand it's a shame that not everyone appreciates good food and wine, or worse, even has access to it. On the other hand, it's astounding how advanced even the average diner's palates are these days.\n\nTwenty years ago, few would even remotely consider a meal of delicate sashimi, or birds nest soup, foie gras, or even something as now basic as Pad Thai, but the world shrank and became better and more delicious  for it. Still, this is a step beyond.\n\nAs with much greatness, the genius of what's coming out of the kitchen at Atelier Crenn will be lost on many. It's not classic, or rustic. It's barely recognizable as food.  It's a parade of whimsy and tastes unlike anything you've ever had before, and you're enjoyment of it will be directly proportional to your ability to embrace your inner adventure taking child who still lives deep in your soul. If you want the millionth take on hangar steak, or salmon, or short ribs this is not for you.\n\nI wish I could paint in loving detail the menu we had, but as such there is none, nor could I even been to describe in a useful manner any of the fantasies placed before us. The seasonal offerings come in the form of a poem. If that seems odd, or pretentious to you then this is probably not the place for you. \n\nThe best I can do is a procession of adjectives that bounced through my head with every bite and to say look at the pictures: delightful, fanciful, bewildering, odd, exquisite, extravagant, excessive, silly, heavenly, luxurious, daring, unique, delectable, surprising, wondrous.\n\nThere are only tasting menus here, a small one and a more expansive Chef's Tasting. We had the larger, but the smaller looks equally interesting and has completely different plates. \n\nI have no idea how this compares to Noma, Alinea and the other top destinations in the world, but in my little world it's the best of the best until someone takes the crown. \n\nBest Plates: All of them.\n\nPalate: Exotic and Inventive\n\nFood - A+\nAmbience - A\nService - A+\nValue - A", "author": "Forrest D."}

But I digress. The reason I came here was because I wanted to introduce my friends to the wonders and joys of molecular gastronomy, which in my humble opinion is one of those culinary experiences everyone should have at least once in their lives. My friends had never heard of MG, so I knew they were in for a treat.\n\nWe got the 5-course tasting menu. As others have mentioned, the dishes aren't actually described on the menu. Instead, you're given a rather pastoral-sounding poem that only hints at what you'll be served (a tad pretentious, if you ask me). Here's what we had:\n\nAmuse Bouche: Inspired by Kir and consisting of a shell with cider in it and gel of creme de cassis atop - Inventive, creative and tasty, like a cold truffle filled with liquid.\n\nCourse #1: Grains, seeds and fermented yuzu with dashi broth - Wonderful juxtaposing textures of crunchy and soft. A little sparse in portion, but a great start to our gastronomic journey.\n\nCourse #2: Saffron aioli, lemon foam and fruit of the sea including mackerel, clams and various kinds of fish - I loved everything about this course and so did my friends. One said it was his favorite of the night. The seafood was unbelievably fresh and the creamy saffron mixed with citric flavors was like the taste equivalent of bright, yellow sunlight for your tongue.\n\nPalate Cleaner: Melon, cucumber, sake, crushed ice and sorbet - No different from the palate cleansers I've had at countless other fine dining restaurants. Did the trick and that's really all that mattered.\n\nCourse #3: Varieties of exotic mushrooms, hazelnuts and dehydrated caramelized onions - My favorite savory course of the night because, well, I love mushrooms....I love hazelnuts....I'm fairly indifferent to onions but there weren't many of them....So I devoured this. As did my other mushroom-loving friend.\n\nCourse #4: Squab, raspberry, kumquats and squash - Squab is always a solid choice for the meat course, since it's thick but sears well and has a nice rich flavor without being too gamey. I enjoyed this but I was a tad disappointed that it was our last savory course.\n\nCheese Plate: Tuscan sheep's milk, savoie, cheese made with cow and goat milk, accompanied by crackers made of chickpea floor and honey - We decided to indulge and added this to our dinner. The cheeses were all very tasty but combined with the crackers and the 4 courses we'd had before, we actually had trouble finishing everything.\n\nCourse #5: Beet dessert - Yes, a dessert designed not only to look like a beet, but taste like one. The actual beet itself was made of beet sorbet. The \"roots\" were made of chocolate sprinkled with cocoa powder. The \"dirt\" upon which the beet rested was made of toasted oats, chocolate flakes and white chocolate mousse. As one of the servers had promised, not too sweet while still satisfying your sweet tooth. One of the most delicious, unique and creative desserts I have ever had.\n\nWe were treated to the lovely presence of Ms. Dominique Crenn herself, who came out to present our final course and stayed to chat with us. Dominique is coolness personified, and it was an absolute pleasure speaking with her. She even allowed me to practice my rusty French and was nice enough not to laugh at the way I undoubtedly butchered it. I only wish she could have stayed with us for the rest of the night.\n\nI'm glad I came here to introduce and experiencing molecular gastronomy with my friends.

I'm happy to finally finish my Bay Area michelin dinning experience at this restaurant.  \n\nI'll start out with the only negative- the dinning room. I might have high expectations going in, but I was expecting the dinning room to be somewhat similar to AQ...whimsical, organic, and beautiful...indicative of a female chef.  The decor needs to be updated, the table and chairs felt very...cheap for the quality of the food and the prestige of the restaurant.  But this isn't even a negative and will not stop me from returning, more of a suggestion and hope that the restaurant will get a much needed face lift.  \n\nNow...onto the food. To summarize, I think the tasting menu at Crenn is very intellectual. To appreciate and enjoy this meal, one should have a decent understanding of cooking techniques, flavor combinations, and quality of ingredients used. I appreciated chef Crenn's risk taking approach to her tasting menu.  What resulted were some spectacular dishes, and even the \"OK\" plates can be appreciated through the unique flavor combinations.  The best comparison that I can make is that Crenn is like more innovative and creative Coi.

The texture - it's not runny, it's not chalky - it's almost, but not quite, like the half-cooked egg yolk you might get at a great Japanese ramen joint.  Except that unlike those half-cooked eggs, which are obviously more cooked on the outside and runny in the middle, this entire yolk has that same, smooth, mid-texture throughout the entire dollop.  \n\nI've never had an egg yolk like this.  I'm sure there is something utterly amazing in how they prepare it.  Some smart cooking technique or ingredient or something.  It's delicate, intricate, technical, remarkable, poetic.\n\nBut while it's a remarkable experience, I can't help but think about Corey Lee's deviled egg yolk at Monsieur Benjamin.  There the preparation is pretty straightforward, very traditional.  It's a deviled egg, that's all it is, but man, oh man, it tastes good.  The tartness of whatever spices they mix into it.  The smooth creamy texture of the mayonnaise.  It might not be anything utterly amazing, but it is utterly delicious.  It is in your face delicious.  If I had to choose between sex that night and eating Corey Lee's egg yolk, well, let me just say that China could solve its one-child population program by - anyway, I'm getting off point.\n\nCrenn's egg yolk, while a very interesting and unique culinary experience and tasting just fine, if I had to choose between eating this egg again or just glancing at a pretty girl, well, I'm sure you can guess at which I'd choose.\n\nIt's not just this dish that makes me feel this way, though it certainly exemplifies many throughout the meal.  And it's not like I don't really enjoy the Kir Brenton, or the squid that reminds me of delicious shiokara, except without the overbearing flavor of guts or more than a few of the other plates.  But all in all, I feel like I'm missing on what's going on with this meal.\n\nSo what do you do when the eater is outclassed by the food.  It's like when you go to the ballet or opera and you know there's something amazing going on in front of you but you're just too under-cultured (hey, I'm not saying I'm a total Neanderthal) to really appreciate it.  And the way you keep from being too bored is by focusing on how beautiful the lead dancers are, or how strong their legs are, or the intricacy of their movements.  There are, however, others in the audience who are emotionally swooning.\n\nIt's kind of humbling, but I freely admit that I am not up to the challenge of appreciating how awesome this food is.  This isn't the first time it's happened.  I think of meals at WD50, Coi, Manresa, my prior meals at Atelier Crenn.  It's okay, I'm fine admitting I'm not the most sophisticated eater.  Nor do I believe that every meal needs to be catered to me, else, horror, horror, the place sucks in my opinion and deserves a crappy review on Yelp!\n\nHere's what I don't understand.  I can go to other restaurants that are also technically brilliant, poetic, delicate and walk away feeling totally awed and happy and not beneath the experience.  Saison clearly comes to mind.  Certain meals, certain dishes at some of the names above - Coi, Manresa, even Benu, do as well.  Technical stuff where I'm left in awe of the entire eating experience and not just the art that's clearly presented in front of me.\n\nSee, maybe I'm a simpleton but I just love flavor.  Pure, unadulterated flavor. Yes, the texture has to be there, and yes there are amazing things you can do with technique and texture and balance and poetry and all that to make the flavor, and the meal really shine.  But without flavor, I'm just left kinda cold.  And that's the problem I have with Atelier Crenn.  I want more flavor.  I remember this time I had the brassicas at Saison and the pure, unadultered intensity of the bitterness, sweetness, crispness, of the greens.  How I tasted these vegetables and I thought when God goes to his garden and eats his vegetables, THIS is what it tastes like.\n\nOr this other time I was at Kyubey in Tokyo and I eat this piece of clam they give me and I'm transported back to this pier on the Pacific Ocean, the briney, cold wind, aroma of seaweed and fish filling my senses as I'm a 5 year old child again going fishing with my family in the early morning dawn.\n\nAlright, I'm definitely getting off point.  And I admit, it really isn't fair - I think it was Ruth Reichl (I could be wrong), former restaurant critic for the New York Times, who said that you need to review a restaurant for what it is, not what you want it to be.  There is no doubt that Atelier Crenn is the pinnacle for what it strives to be, and that there are others who appreciate that.\n\nOkay, I will say this. That last savory dish, the A5 Wagyu.  For a restaurant that clearly prides itself on a more nuanced sensibility, this was boringly straight down the middle.  How many dozens of restaurants are also serving a well prepared, simple Wagyu with really good salt?  Felt quite un-Crenn.", "author": "Jason C."}

The seemingly random scattering of micro herbs and edible flowers are in fact placed individually by one of the few chef's implements I had yet to covet up to that point - a pair of tweezers!\n\nI was joined on this meal by my awesome local Yelp Elite friends Julie K, Tammy C and Cece C. Being locals, they were able to find parking more easily than me but I was finally successful after a bit of circling\n\nThe restaurant has a discreet frontage but the interior has a calm and classy feel. Our server, Robert, was fantastic throughout the evening. The is a meal heavy on dishes being finished at the table with sauces being poured, so it was nice to have friendly interaction with the serving staff. A dramatic meal in many ways\n\nWe had 2 amuse bouches. The first looked like an eyeball but was in fact kir royale in a crispy white chocolate shell. The second was a lovely soup poured from a teapot\n\n1. Sea urchin, butternut squash, tarragon emulsion\nSea urchin is a luxurious ingredient and its strong flavour was tempered well by the sweet squash and anissed from the tarragon\n\n2. Oyster\nThe super fresh enormous squishy oyster was enhanced by the wonderful herb soup but still allowing the oyster to sing\n\n3. Taste of the Garden\nYup, every individual element was distinct and was obviously top quality\n\n4. Quinoa\nThe most surprising dish both in appearance and taste. It looked like a random scattering of seeds, herbs and flowers on a stone bowl but the first mouthful blew me away. There was nuttiness, crunch, fresh herbs. A genius dish in concept and execution\n\n5. Intermezzo\nDelicate herb ice creams cleaned the palate without being over-sweet\n\n6. Squid and abalone\nMore luxurious ingredients cooked to perfection and lent umami enhancement from the sauce\n\n7. Venison tartare\nWow! If I hadn't read the description, I wouldn't have known that this was a tartare. Great deep gamey flavourwith sharp and sweet accents from the accompaniments\n\n8. Duck\nHaha! Reminiscent of the 'roast chicken' dish at Dabbous in London where you get all the hit of roast chicken but there's no actual chicken meat on the dish. This dish has the duck in floss form as well in the consomme served alongside but you get the full flavour of duck. Sweetcorn was also an unusual but inspired pairing\n\n9. Guinea fowl\nJust in case diners were missing some real meat, some lovely guinea fowl. Being Asian, we of course tried on gnaw on the guinea fowl talon that was served with the meat but discovered that it was only for decoration!\n\n10. Eucalyptus\nAnother palate cleanser saw eucalyptus ice cream being served in a plant pot of eucalyptus\n\n11. Aubergine\nYes, really. Our dessert course was made from eggplant but how it was transformed. Served dramatically with 'steaming' dry ice, it had been transformed into different sweet textures\n\n11a. Beet\nJulie is allergic eggplant, so she was served a tasting of beet - what appeared to be a whole beet plant arrived on a plate. Only it wasn't a beet plant. The beet itself was beet sorbet and the root was made from chocolate. Stunning - you would swear it was a real beet plant\n\nThe mignardines were served on a glass plate on top of a bed of plants and moss. We also received chocolates\n\nA final lovely touch was an extra birthday dish and card for the birthday girls in our party\n\nDespite having two 3 Michelin restaurants on my itinerary on the trip, I think my meal at Atelier Crenn drew the most happy gasps of surprise and wonderment on the trip\n\nSince my visit, I so happy and not at all surprised to see that Dominique Crenn became the first female chef in the USA to be awarded 2 Michelin stars in the 2013 guide. Very well deserved indeed. Along with Saison, I would rate these 2 restaurants as must-eats for any self respecting foodie coming to the Bay Area", "author": "Yee Gan O."}

As noted by one of our group about the pricing structure, if you're into trying variety, for $20 more, you get many more looks at various course from the $75, three course menu. So the five hour meal went as follows:\n\n-Amuses  - potato&rice crisps, oyster poached in urchin emulsion\n-Kir Breton - A play on the beverage which was a frozen sphere of cider, creme de cassis, and frozen \"snow\" of yogurt\n\n-Oyster and Ocean - Sea Urchin and Lemon Cloud\n\n-Maitake - Maitake mushrooms, Morel Gel, Mushrooom dashi\n\n-Monterey Bay Abalone - Onion dashi, pamplemousse Campari sorbet, coriander, basil, lard\n\n-Le Jardin d'Hiver - micro root vegetables, their purees, grains\n\n-White wine - white balsamic palate cleanser\n\n-Foie gras, beet rhubarb merengue, micro greens\n\n-The Sea - oyster, cuttlefish gnocchi, anchovy, sesame\n\n-Truffle and sous vide egg, Atelier garden herbs, orange\n\n-Lamb Neck, Grains, Yogurt,  Wild Sorrel\n\n-Pigeon \"en croute de sel\", Rose, Grains, Coffee\n\n--Cheese Cart - bleu d'Auvergne, Garrotxa, Red Hawk and Carmody \n\n-Red quinoa grained supreme in a winter porridge with hazelnut pearls and oxalis\n\n-Coconut, Pineapple, Guava\n\n-Tea/Coffee\n\nUnlike the test dinner, this was a true reflection of service with live customers. The service was very leisurely as they were trying to figure out the flow of the night. Five hours may have been a long time to some but we had a great time the whole night, and in my normal fashion, we closed the place down.

Well, you end up here, where a meal is so much more than just food and wine, it's a story. And what a whimsical story it is!\n\nFor our last meal in No.Cal, the Fungry Foodies and I decided we wanted an adventure, and what better place to journey than to a restaurant that believes food is so much more than just eating. This woman is a culinary genius; one whose passion is seen in every plate she does. And we were treated to such a surprising, impressive show, I didn't want to leave.\n\nEven if, for me, some of the dishes were a little \"out there\" in terms of flavor profiles (and she used a lot of beets; I'm not a fan of beets), I enjoyed every bit. I mean who thinks of combining an artichoke with mussels and pear? It was divine. How about venison, eel, and horseradish in one beautiful plate? Or how about making a dish that resembles a nest sitting on a tree branch and everything on it is edible with some chocolate bits throw in?! Honestly, I found myself gasping upon seeing it.\n\nI definitely want to return to this wonderland of food. Atelier Crenn makes you feel like a kid again; all curiosity and excitement, like someone's been telling you how wonderful ice-cream is and you're going to eat it for the first time. It's that same special feeling. What an unforgettable night!", "author": "Cecilia D."}

It's a casually elegant, rustic molecular gastronomy experience.\n\nCAUTION, this type of food is not for everyone, it's dainty, it's innovative, it's bordering on pretentious, but seriously, the decibels in the restaurant was bordering on deafening, it would NEVER get to level of true arrogance, as many of the finer establishments have a very restrained environment.  \n\nService was extremely gracious, knowledgeable and the gratitude of Chef Crenn was evident when she made rounds at each and every table.  Word on the street is if a dish is a flop for the evening, it will be TOAST the next night.\n\nMy favorites of the evening: the crostini amuse bouche, the chilled kir globes, perfectly crisped kale, the sous vide artic char, the root veggies in yogurt 'snow', the sheep's milk cheese & the uniquely crafted mignardises.\n\nThe garden room in the back is more intimate and less rowdy, but I thought the lighting was a bit bright to be romantic.  \n\nItems of improvement: timing of courses, we had the tasting menu, as did many others that evening and it took four hours.  Our server was aware and apologetic of the timing-he generously comped an additional glass of chilled champagne for our patience.\n\nThe food surprised me and the stories behind them brought a warmth to each dish. Glad Crenn has free reign at her own namesake, as she brings a creativity and strength to the SF food culture.", "author": "Cynthia C."}

This place isn't cheap, that is for sure, but I was rather surprised when I saw my bill to be much larger than I remembered.  I left a 20% tip on the pre-tax total, but the amount on my credit card equaled nearly a 50% tip on the pretax total (!!!).\n\nI contacted the concierge about this and was told that the waiter \"accidentally swapped tips with another table,\" and I was refunded the extra tip down to my original.  \n\nThe concierge offered nothing more nor seemed excessively apologetic, acting like it was a normal thing.  I generally would expect more from a restaurant that considers itself this caliber, either a gift certificate or refunding more than the amount that was effectively stolen, but to not even be given an \"OMG Wow I'm super sorry.\"\n\nIt isn't even about the money but a casual \"Oops let me fix that\" in such a suspect situation is disappointing. \n\nAs for the meal itself, I'm likely incriminating myself but I wouldn't have gone back there before I saw the credit card \"error\" though I may have recommended it to people who were into that kind of thing, but as of now not so much.\n\nSome of the combos were interesting, some were nice ideas that didn't work so well on the plate (hot and cold, in particular).  \n\nHaving eaten several Michelin rated chef's tastings from Ko in New York, to Nahm in Bangkok, I'm not sure how into 12+ course chef's tastings I'm into.  With the exception of Nahm, none of them have floored me, and I feel like I'd have a better experience going to Nopa, Mission Chinese, Chotto, Chez Panisse, etc. and just ordering whatever looks good without any regard to cost.\n\nAnd yes, I am aware that Atelier Crenn and the aforementioned restaurants are very different genres, Atelier Crenn taking off more in the family of Dinner as Theater brought to the forefront by individuals like Ferran Adria and Grant Achatz but I think in some small part places like Atelier Crenn and Alinea are in the realm of food as novelty, rather than food as food, and novelty generally wears off.  The novel trend of essentialising food to their fundamental flavor elements, then altering them to powder, smoke, foam, etc. as an accent is just that, novel, and again, newness gets old.\n\nEl Bulli & WD 40 were shut down by their founders for a reason; to grow, evolve, discover, and move onto the Next Big Thing. \n\nSimilarly, why do you think Grant Achatz named his new restaurant \"Next\"?", "author": "Mary G."}

I won't be surprised when Atelier Creen eventually gets a deserved third star. \n\nMy only complain would be the fact that the shorter version of the menu has been removed now. I can understand why, but it was a good way to give the restaurant a try and explore the universe. I am not complaining about the value of the degustation menu, but it is one of the most pricey dining in SF.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-27", "description": "Whether or not I can write a decent review for this restaurant depends on how well I can describe the experience of the dishes served, considering they are each actually titled with interpretive poetic verses instead of, say, \"duck a l'orange\" (random example, not actually served here). This concept was actually intriguing -- it was two people's shared birthday experience several months back (our purpose for attending in the first place), and the menu itself read like a story, with each line representing an individual dish. But, it definitely took some explanation from our waiters.\n\nTake the first line from the Chef's Grand Tasting Menu that night: \"Winter has come with its cool breeze\" -- it was our amuse-bouche, and the references I gathered from that were some sort of white chocolate could represent winter, and something cold inside would be included. I was pretty darn close, as they served each of us a Kir Breton: Kir Royal within a light Cocoa Butter Shell. Exquisite and refreshing!\n\nThat was literally the process for interpreting each dish. Here are just a few more amusing lines that we consumed that evening, which I will leave to your imagination, and I guarantee there were many more:\n\"I refreshed as I gazed at your smooth green coat\nWalking deep in the woods, as the snow might have something to spare\"\n\nI won't even try at this point to dig further back into my memory bank, but it was a grand experience for encountering and tasting numerous uniquely crafted and flavorful dishes and wine pairings that evening -- even their presentation, sometimes within large shells or wooden logs, was fascinating. I see there are more than 1000 other pictures other yelpers posted, including some of the other menus. We all met Chef Dominique Crenn that night, too, while we were all dressed up for the occasion.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-21", "description": "***Atelier Crenn combines Manresa's Japanese flavors and French technique with Saison's approach to food to make it one of San Francisco's best restaurants***\n\nAtelier Crenn is reminiscent of many other great restaurants, but it is very much its own restaurant.  It is lot like Manresa in how it combines French technique with a lot of Japanese ingredients and flavors.  There is also a bit of Saison in its freshness, presentations and approach to nature.  And finally, there is a bit of Alinea's whimsical and playful approach to food.\n\nAtelier Crenn's closeness to nature resonates with both the room and food and it feels like the dominant force here.  The room has nice wood and close-to-nature feel through the ceiling, light fixtures and even the artwork (the room is a nice small, intimate and modern space though I would prefer different tables; the medium wood colored tables felt like tables you would see anywhere and Atelier Crenn does not feel like something you can find anywhere).\n\nThe food reinforces nature too.  First in the ingredients. There are earthy ingredients but also greens and floral notes.  The presentations reflect nature too.  Some presentations are influenced by nature (garden-esque use of color, free flowing ingredients) while other presentations are direct lifts like the bird's nest, which looks exactly like it sounds--the bird eggs are made of reconstituted duck fat; the eggs were buttery, flavorful, creamy, and even reminiscent of foie gras.\n\nThe dinner was actually split into four parts.  The first part consisted of vibrant amuses and small plates.  The second part consisted of spicy and savory plates (luckily a very good and refreshing palate cleanser followed).  Then some more substantial and more balanced savory plates.  And finally desserts.\n\nThe first part was great.  There was creamy and slightly sweet sea urchin paired with a nicely salty caviar, sweet butternut squash pur\u00e9e and a fragrant and floral tarragon foam.  I prefer Santa Barbara sea urchin to Bay Area sea urchin, but this was good.\n\nThere was a great poached oyster dish that was served with fragrant elderflower and cool melon.\n\nThe second part of the meal consisted of a seasonal salad that had quite a bit of seasoning and spice.  There was also some roe with dashi and an additional powerful ingredient that tasted like Japanese rice seasoning.  Both dishes were good, but they were very strong and left quite the taste in my mouth.\n\nLuckily, a very good palate cleanser followed that consisted of shiso ice with apple and ginger sorbet--exactly what you would want in a palate cleanser (cool, refreshing, fragrant, and unique in flavor).\n\nThe next selection of savory courses were outstanding.  There was truly great calamari served with variations of onions--distinct onion flavors and textures without being overpowering.  The calamari was simply cooked and had a great tender texture and a nice flavor.\n\nThere was a great venison tartare paired with beets and little dabs of nicely strong horseradish.  I mentioned the bird's nest, which was very good though I think the addition of chocolate branches didn't work.\n\nThe final course was small, but it was also impactful and sumptuous.  It was pressed guinea hen, which had an incredibly thick, flavorful and crispy skin.  The meat was tender and good too.  It was moist, but I think it could have been juicier.\n\nI liked the sides--a light pistachio mousse with sweet huckleberries and earthy and woody chanterelles.\n\nThere were also a few rolls throughout the meal--wheat and brioche.  They were freshly made but just okay.\n\nDessert started with a creamy, cool and floral eucalyptus sorbet.  The main dessert was very similar in flavors and textures to the dessert I had at Benu, which was variations of cashews--ice cream, meringue, powder, etc.  There was also mint.\n\nThe dessert was fine but nothing special.  The presentation was cool though.  They poured tea into a bowl that created some fragrant and slow moving smoke.  This coupled with the gray dessert created an ash and smoke-like presentation.\n\nThe petit fours were very good.  There was a great nougatine, sweet, tart and distinct p\u00e2t\u00e9 de fruit, incredibly creamy and smooth chocolate ganache pieces, as well as several other good items.  Some of the best petit fours I've had.\n\nService was very good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive as well as professional and polite.  I also liked how the head chef came out to converse with the diners.\n\nIn terms of prices, they offer two tasting menus.  The most expensive tasting menu is priced up there with some of SF's most expensive restaurants, but it is also very elaborate (featuring many high quality dishes).\n\nAtelier Crenn is a great spot that offers a satisfying but also very unique dining experience.  I prefer Saison, but this would be up there with SF's best restaurants.\n\nFor parking, there is a nearby parking structure.

There were some flavors that blew me away and some that missed the mark but It's one of the most creative and visually stunning meals I've ever had. Substitutions were seamlessly and happily accommodated. We did the grand tasting for $160 per person. At the end of the meal I felt satisfied but not full. Everyone else at the table said that they were still hungry. For $160 per person, the last thing you would expect is not to be full.\n\nOverall the meal was fun and creative, service was attentive, professional but not stuffy.

Most tasting menus tend to be self-indulgent, over the top experiences where the chef wants you to experience their childhood, their past, present, future, blah, blah, blah. I did experience chef Crenn's journey and inspiration and i loved it. Their weakest dishes are their desserts, but I'm not a dessert person, so what do I know? A few observations:\n\n-Some dishes will require you to eat with your hands. Eating food can be a sensual experience. I'm all into it. But, some people might have a problem with this. I'm looking at you, German folks.\n-Some of the hand-made \"utensils\" are too awkward to use.\n-I left the restaurant quite full. But I can see how some people with the mindset of \"I paid a lot of money, I better be stuffed\" might complain.\n-Chef Crenn will come out of the kitchen to greet you and thank you for visiting her home so to speak.

He was really apologetic and brought some champagne for us to enjoy while we were waiting. Just seemed kind of weird to be waiting at the door at this level of restaurant.\n\nWe finally got our table. Beautiful menu presentation in a form of a poem. Our server was really friendly.  Since we already had champagne and we don't drink much, we decided not to do the wine pairing.The same guy at the door suggested that we could do a bottle of white wine followed by a glass of red wine for our mains and he will get the sommelier to come by. \n\nBy the time he came by, the tasting menu had already started. He did not seem apologetic nor interested in helping us with our choice of wine. Selected a bottle of wine and it wasn't chilled. We never saw the sommelier come by to our table again the whole night. It was our lovely waitress and the gentleman which sat us who constantly checked in on us. \n\nRight before our main course were delivered, he came by to see if we wanted a glass of red wine and was very helpful with recommending a glass of syrah with the duck. He was more helpful getting us a glass of wine than the sommelier trying to sell us a bottle of wine.\n\nFood wise - there were so many courses to list and it was such a beautiful dinner.\n\nService - kind of bumpy. Our waitress and the door guy was amazing. The other servers which came to our table to deliver food was knowledgeable and gracious. The wine service leaves much to be desired.\n\nThe bill was definitely very expensive. But hey, this is San Francisco. nothing's cheap.", "author": "Jordan B."}

When the grains, seeds and dashi arrived, it didn't look like much, but it was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Packed with so much nutty toastiness and umami, I couldn't believe how much flavor there was in each bite - I could eat that for every meal, every day of my life. \n\nThe dessert was so delightful - when the server brought the dishes to our table, I was confused. Who ordered a raw beet? I couldn't believe how much it looked like a raw beet (as did everybody else around us). Beet sorbet disguised as a raw beet with a chocolate root and chocolate \"dirt\" - beautiful and delicious. I don't really like sweets, so the beet dessert was up my alley as it wasn't too sweet. \n\nChef Crenn was very generous with her time - she came out into the dining area to say hello and check on everybody in the restaurant; she spent a surprising amount of time speaking with people which was surprising given that it was in the middle of a very busy service. \n\nAt less than $100 for the five-course tasting menu, her food is relatively accessible compared to other similar restaurants.", "author": "Wendy L."}

We were all excited to try this place. Brother and mom ate at Meadowood the day before so the expectations were high.\n\nWhat a disappointment this was. All I can say is that I'm glad I didn't have to foot the $1,000 bill. After being given the food and wine pairing menu, we were alerted about 10 mins later that the mid-priced wine paring ($85/person) wasn't available, only the $150/person pairing was offered on Saturday night. Total bummer after three of us had already decided on this since we were NEVER told in the beginning. Lost that business. We opted for wine by the glass.\n\nNext, the chairs are the most uncomfortable thing I've ever sat in. When having a 3-hour plus dinner, I want to be comfortable!!! It was really awful. I will never forget how much I ached sitting there :/\n\nThe time between courses was way too long. We waited at least 20 to 25 minutes between each course. Keep in mind our reservation was at 5:30 PM so it wasn't extremely busy when we were there.  \n\nAfter completing the third course, I think we were all ready to hurry up and get it over with.

Ive been to many two star/three star michelin restaurants and was looking forward to checking out the molecular gastronomy at Athelier Crenn. I also really care about flavorful food...one of the experiences I want is that with each bite, I don't want another bite to end.\n\nSo our reservations were at 9 pm. When we got there, there were two other couples at the door still waiting. We ended up being seated at 9.30 pm. For a two star michelin restaurant and for the amount of money we were paying (our bill was $500 odd dollars sans wine), that is unacceptable. Never had this experience at any other restaurant. The restaurant was obviously understaffed, there was no hostess at the door to greet the waiting guests and the waiters came to check on them while leaving to serve seated patrons. Everyone looked frazzled, giving an air of hub bub rather than relaxation to the restaurant.\n\nFor couples expecting a romantic dinner, the tables were really placed too close together. It felt that the restaurant either should be larger or there should be less tables in there. We were unfortunately seated next to two loud ladies. For the next hour or so (this is a tasting menu), we were treated to a run down of the ladies' abusive father, whether they were ever going to have kids, gossiping about their friend who had a lowly profession but yet saved alot of money. I had a headache, it was not romantic, I was not enjoying myself. I nearly applauded when the ladies left.\n\nThe food was okay..every bite was good. But it was not AMAZING, it did not make me dream of coming back to the restaurant again the way Joel Roubuchon, french laundry, or momofuku ko did. The presentation was innovative....but what was damning was that the BEST dish i enjoyed there was a plate of wagyu beef. that was not even on the tasting menu. It was only given to us as an apology for waiting half an hour. And that was the dish I enjoyed the most. I also notice that alot of the dishes though innovative had less of the whole 'cavair, fois gras, truffle\" thing going on.\n\nI hate to be so contrary but between the waiting, the cramped seating, the loud ladies next to me and the food being interesting but could add more flavor and t he best dish not even on the regular tasting menu, I really think that a patron could get more value going to other superb restaurants in san francisco.", "author": "Holly C."}

The waiters and waitresses were very attentive, and the sommelier was helpful. \n\nMy favorites of the night was dish with uni in it, the French onion soup and micro-salad. They were both very flavorful. The course that shape like a bird nest was pretty cool because the chocolate tasted super good with the savory course. The eye-opener for me throughout the night though (okay, this was my favorite too), was the grape dessert that was served in a half-cut wine bottle!

I can't remember when a restaurant impacted me like this place. It was a total experience!\n\nAlthough you don't really have choices since there are two tasting menu options, they are very receptive to appealing to your particular palate. I was able to have a vegan, no raw vegetable, and no hot spicy culinary experience. \n\nOf the five dishes, I most enjoyed the \"walk though the forest\" which featured wild mushrooms and a zillion other ingredients. Each dish is artfully prepared. The display and arrangement of each dish is part of the fun. My attention was drawn to other tables -- those ordering the 10 taste menu -- with some very outlandish displays. It was rather surreal and reminded me of a scene from the movie \"True Stories.\" There's a fashion show and each model wears something more outrageous than the previous...here in the restaurant tree trunks with mushroom caps holding one bite-sized morsel, and then a eucalyptus tree in a box with a lollipop leaf. It was bizarre.\n\nI do believe it was the most creative food experience I've ever had.

Constantly playful and surprising, unbelievably beautiful, and almost always delicious- the 4-hour stream of dishes on the full spring tasting menu was perfectly sized and paced. We shared a regular beverage (mostly wine) pairing between two and would definitely recommend that. Most of the pairings were excellent, with a couple of surprising departures from the usual. \n\nOverall we were delighted at every turn, wowed by the creative presentations, and in gastronomical heaven from the carefully chosen flavors. It was also a nice touch that Chef Crenn stopped by our table a couple of times during the meal to check in on how we were doing.\n\nIf you are thinking of a high end meal anywhere near San Francisco you owe it to yourself to give Atelier Crenn a try.

The food and plating all exquisite, inventive and delicious. I've done The French Laundry and Meadowood (both 3 Star Michelin), and I would have no problem putting the best dishes from Chef Crenn against Keller.  Menu cost was completely reasonable and I would happily relive the experience again... once my stomach gives me the greenlight.\n\nOur table captain was polite, fun and personable. He did a great job orchestrating the  sequence. Chef Crenn came out at one point (perhaps the 16th course... I was starting to lose count) and greeted everyone in the restaurant. Pretty cool.\n\nThe only uncool aspect of the whole experience was the wine list and the Somm. While the wine list was very well curated, I found it to be a bit aggressive in pricing and pretty minimal in terms of selection (compared to other big Michelin restaurants). We did not go for the wine pairing that is offered with the menu, but from the wines being served they ironically were the inverse of the list... kinda pedestrian. Although they do not encourage bringing in your own wines, I would recommend doing so especially if you have truly rockstar bottles (and there is a $45 corkage fee). And ultimately we lost favor with the Somm as during the discussion of opening our own bottles he came across as hostile and modestly rude. Unfortunately he perpetuates the myth that fine wine is elitist and beyond the appreciation of anyone under 50 years old.\n\nWill I go back... yes, most likely.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-07", "description": "An experience, for sure, but I can see how the reviews are mixed. This place is like modern art...incredible for some, and WTF for others.\n\nWe were lucky and found street parking 2 blocks away. The restaurant is not clearly marked, but it's part of the artistry. Beauty over function. We met DH's parents there for a celebration of DH's dad's retirement. He picked the restaurant and he enjoyed it immensely. DH is in the WTF camp. He wanted bigger portion sizes and more traditional flavors, rather than the artsy plating and dazzling molecular work.\n\nWe went for the extended \"grand\" tasting menu. Everyone at the table needed to order the same, since it took so long for the dishes to come out. Our meal was nearly 4 hours long! The \"menu\" is a poem, playfully hinting at the courses to come. Our servers did explain what was being presented and they graciously accept any dietary restrictions. We only asked for \"not too spicy\", which didn't require any tweaking. The ambiance was cozy modern with Edison lamps, nifty modern silverware, unconventional plating and glasses. People weren't dressed up too much. DH was at ease in his nice button-up shirt and black jeans. I wore the usual sweater, skirt, scarf, and boots. It was a little chilly as we sat near the door.\n\nMany of the dishes were immensely complex...think tempura battered miniature turnips, micro-greens, freeze dried cilantro, deep fried cilantro, and artsy dots of coconut based sauce dripped strategically on each plate. Ingredients were fresh and amazing. We had a seared scallop which was perfectly executed and topped with yuzu foam and licorice notes, alongside uni \"torchon\" prepared like classic foie gras. Stuff came out on slabs of tree bark, attached to eucalyptus branches, and pieces of slate. It was like being a judge on Iron Chef America. \n\nOne of the most amazing looking dishes was a tiny delicate \"nest\" with frozen creamy spheres that looked like eggs. It had a long chocolate \"branch\", apple and vanilla bean sauce dots, and an accompanying duck consomme. DH liked the composition and how most of the plate was purposely left empty. The sweet and savory flavors were strange mixed together, but it sure looked neat!\n\nThere was an lamb and eel tartare served with rice cracker. Too salty. Raw meats aren't my thing, though. DH enjoyed it. We also had a dashi based soup with crunchy grains that was also too salty.\n\nOne of DH's favorite dishes was a rare squab with fig and parsnip. That was pretty tasty and larger than the other portions. The mushroom dish was also excellent. This is one of their signature dishes with several types of sauteed mushrooms, plated on an undulating plate, with micro-greens and apparently even some \"soil\". My dining companions were not sure if it was indeed real soil or molecular-soil-like substitute. But it was kind of gritty. Hmmm.\n\nWe had a few palate cleansers before dessert. Cedar rooibos tea with a real piece of cedar in a long test-tube looking contraption, wedged in ice. Creamy eucalyptus lollipops on eucalyptus stems were a nice twist on the standard mint ice cream.\n\nDessert was one of my faves and truly impressive. It came out in a wine bottle which was sawed in half lengthwise. A bunch of recreated \"grapes\" (seemed like they were made of sorbet) with hazelnuts lined the bottle. The waitstaff pulled out a hollow wax \"cork\" out of the bottle, cut the top off with a special tool, and drizzled a vinegar reduction over the entire thing. Amazing. I've never seen anything like that. The grape and hazelnuts were marvelous together.\n\nWe ended the evening with mignardises: tiny passion fruit marshmallow, jasmine cherry jelly, sesame chocolate crisp, nougat with pistachios, coffee with milk chocolate ganache, and salted caramel wrapped in plastic. All were delicious and nicely executed.\n\nOverall, a creative and fun experience, with some weird flavor moments and impressive molecular work. We were still a bit hungry at the end of the meal and we're usually light eaters. DH didn't think it was worth the $180, but he has been to numerous fancy restaurants and says, \"It's the best plating I have ever seen.\" I think it's worth trying, but we probably won't be back soon.

After I saw them obtain their second Michelin star I decide to check this place out. Its a cute little modern restaurant. On the walls they hang up pictures and art portraits that the chef and her family made. The service was fast and the staff was polite. The platting here is probably one of the best i have ever sean. The food was creative however only a few dishes impressed me. Personally i think its just because the food didnt suite my pallet. The price isnt outrageous - its pretty fair. However i left the restaurant still hungry - which has never happened before in a michelin restaurant. Towards the end the chef came out to greet everyone. She was personable and nice. Overall i would give this place another chance when the menu changes. \n\nThe bread was warm and fresh as if it was just made .\n\nThe amuse was a hibiscus sorbet (?) and kind of like juice inside a white chocolate shell. It was extremely good and you could tell molecular gastronomy was involved. \n\nGrains, Seeds, Dashi and Yuzu plate was extremely good. I call it the best adult cereal soup around\n\nThe Sea plate consistent of one of the best fresh seafood available in norcal. You could taste the sweet notes of the sashmi and and richness of the clams. However it lacked any special cookery that i couldn't emulate imo.\n\nWalk in the forest plate consisted of tons of different mushrooms and greens. It was a bit overly salty for me. However it was still nonetheless delicious. You can notice a lot of different cooking techniques in the dish.  \n\nOcean and land plate was decent. The squab was a bit to rare for me. The squid ink chip was a bit overly fishy for me. \n\nBetterave plate was disappointing for me. I like to end on a sweet note however this was just a sorbet and coconibs plated like a beat. \n\nPetite fours were just okay. Nothing special.\n\nThe portions should be increased. Also In some ways i felt that they were TOO creative with too many cooking techniques involved in one dish. Sometimes complexity confuses people and their pallets. Sometimes too much creativity loses their customers when we beg for something a bit more classic/traditional.", "author": "Andrew W."}

What a beautiful progression of senses from start to finish.  Each dish had some kind of movement, enter \"I remember an oceanic feeling\", which was a beautiful plate of Aji with turnip \"snow\" that was dusted upon arrival. It was like watching snow fall during a winter storm that eventually melted into the sea. My words aren't eloquent enough. \nI often feel some restaurants throw items together just to have certain ingredients on the menu. Oh, we have foie, we have scallops, we have wagyu, etc. At Crenn, every dish and every ingredient made sense and together told a story. The experience and feelings I felt here were unlike any other Michelin starred restaurants we've had the chance to dine at. \n\nI really appreciate how the staff was top-notch with their service, but made us feel at ease. A hard feat since most restaurants of this caliber has that snotty, entitled air to them. At Atelier Crenn, the staff was more like a tour guide or old acquaintance, leading us through the journey of the meal. Never stuffy or snotty, present without you knowing it, and always available when you need them (although they're pros and you'll never need them because they're one step ahead of you). \n\nIt also seems they've rectified previous comments regarding closeness of the seating arrangements. We were comfortably far away enough from our neighbors.  I was also a little worried we'd be rushed to finish the multi-hour meal since our reservations were at 9:30pm. Not at all, didn't feel rushed and we enjoyed our meal at a leisurely pace.\n\nAn experience that all food lovers should go though. Just trust yourself with Chef Crenn and her team, go with the flow, and they will guide you through an unforgettable journey!", "author": "Tina C."}

The 18 course, 3 hour dinner was well paced and a good value for the experience. The first five courses were not served with utensils and the staff encouraged us to eat with your hands which provided a fun and unique experience. One dish that stood out was the Gold Egg dish that was an egg yolk, oyster, foam and chard leek served in a golden egg shell. The supplement of Wagyu beef was delicious and am glad we ordered, it was simple and showcased the flavor of the beef. The five dessert courses were all great but the main dessert, a sorel mouse with blackberries, pine nuts and a lemon cookie that was made to look like a black truffle that was shaved over the dessert was spectacular. There was a flavor profile that ran through the entire dinner and made it very cohesive.\n\nMy wife had the Grand Wine Tasting and I had the Reserve. Both tastings were really good and both paired beautifully with the dishes. The wines were fun and I would highly recommend doing the tastings.\n\nOverall it was a wonderful meal and am extremely glad we were able to enjoy.

We had a hard time finding this place until a guy in a suit walking down the street asked us if we were looking for Atelier Crenn.  Since we were dressed up, it must have been obvious and he kindly led us to the restaurant.  \n\nWe were the first diners there for the night.  It was nice simple organic looking environment.  You could see the kitchen and Chef Dominique Crenn's back through the glass window.  We started off with a glass of champagne to start the night.  They had 2 kinds of menu: a 5 Course ($85) and the Chef's Grand Tasting ($160).  Of course, my husband wanted to go for the Chef's Grand Tasting so we did with one wine pairing to share.\n\nThe amuse bouche was Kir Breton, which was a ball of white chocolate filled with creme de cassis.  The server advised us to slip it into our mouth using our bottom lip.  I tried to do that until my front teeth hit the ball and popped it spilling the liquid on the table and on my napkin.  What a mess I made, but they kindly cleaned it up, gave me a new napkin, and offered me a second chance, which was nice of them.  They said it happens often so they make extras. :)\n\nPer our server, each of the dish used Japanese techniques and focused a lot on seasonal seafood.  Every bite was delightful and put a smile on our faces.  Presentation was excellent and very appealing to the eye.  After seeing a tray of various cheeses, we ordered a small plate to add before our dessert.  Can't say no to cheese!\n\nSome of the desserts came on a piece of tree bark, when out came a spider.  A real one!  I almost let out a shriek, but I politely covered my mouth with my napkin to avoid embarrassment.  Before my husband reacted, the guy next to us saw and killed it with his napkin.  EEekkk!  We told our server and he was surprised, but we laughed about it.  In the end, he offered a box of extra caramel to take with us.  That was nice of him.\n\nEven with the ~14 courses, we weren't stuffed.  Highlights were great food, great experience with the messy amuse bouche and spider, and of course, meeting Chef Dominique Crenn.  Nice that she comes out and greets everyone.", "author": "Erica S."}

Compared to other cheaper tasting menus like $120 Lazy Bear (San Francisco), $125 Melisse (Los Angeles), and $125 Le Bernadin (New York), Crenn is still very worthwhile - opening my mind up to depths of flavour and texture that those aforementioned restaurants (even Le Bernadin, in the world's Top50 list) didn't come close to. \n\nThat broth in the French Onion Soup was transcendental. Uni custard mindblowingly thick. White beet frozen snow a transportative texture. Brittany lobster butter sauce and sweetbreads rich in a classy, not showy, way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-09-25", "description": "To start, I have to say that if you go here you will have a good meal. That's granted at this calibre. But when you have two Michelin stars, there's a higher hill to climb. I'm no stranger to Michelin restaurants, or to the avant garde in a number of other art forms for that matter. So I'm up for a sensory adventure, even if it borders on the weird or unpleasant, as long as it provides a lasting, worthwhile experience.\n\nMy overall impression of Crenn is that there is too much focus on technique at the expense of vision. Take away the fancy decor, and modernist cuisine is essentially just a small-scale application of the same food processing technologies used to make twinkies. An egg yolk \"gelatin\" sheet, or tomato foam, or candy shells filled with apple juice don't mean anything just because they're made with fresh, local ingredients. It's still processed food; the question is whether you do something interesting with it. Crenn didn't. The quality of the ingredients carried the evening, not the masterfulness of her vision. \n\nIt also didn't help that she tried to pair the menu to a poem \"inspired\" by it. I speak English as a first language and I would be reluctant to replace the menu with a poem I wrote. Yet Crenn, from France, has no such compulsions... And the poem is nothing special; it would have been much more informative, in terms of the narrative of the meal, to have had a listing of the actual courses being served. I'm not against poetry or creative presentations of the dining experience, but if you go outside of the tried and true it needs to be amazing, not detract from your strengths. \n\nThat, in sum, is how I felt about most of the courses we were served. There was always some distracting conceptual idea that wasn't fully baked, some \"whiz bang\" bauble that reminded me just how artificial the whole thing is. I mean, it is slightly offensive to be serving highly refined food that can only be made with lab equipment on a tree branch that washed up at Ocean Beach; it's crassly ostentatious and lacks all sense of self-awareness or humility. \n\nSo there you have it, sort of a conceptual review, but this is what the problems are at Crenn. She obviously has talent and I hope someday to be proud to have this restaurant in our city. But for now, it falls short of the Michelin standard.", "author": "Aaron G."}

We chose to have the food and wine pairing hoping that this would be the best showing.  What we found is that the restaurant is one of the most expensive in the City but both the food and the service were both off the mark.  Having never been there before we were unclear on the format or what to expect and our server did little to clarify.  \n\nThere were 2 courses served prior to the first glass of wine, a amuse-bouche and a large shrimp dish.  Our server mentioned that there were going to be 7 wines served throughout the course of the night but neglected to mention that there would be over 1/2 hour and 2 courses where there would be no wine served.  In addition to the lack of clarity on the format and the missing wine, getting the attention of the servers in even the only 1/2 full restaurant was a challenge.  We kept turning around to ask questions but the staff only came over when there was something to put in front of us.  I would have thought it was just us, but the couple at the table next to us seemed to be having the same trouble with both the pacing and the service.\n\nThe presentation of the food for the most part was beautiful, I only wish someone in the back bothered to taste the dishes before they were served.  None of the dishes had any \"wow\" factor and none were memorable in a positive way.  The worst dish is was the most memorable which was the first dessert course.  It was served in what looked like a bowl made of bark.  It tasted like someone made a gelato out of turpentine and then shaved cookies made of pine needles on top.\n\nI had high hopes given the recommendation of people that had been here before, but something must have happened. Perhaps it was because Chef Crenn was not present but the mood in the place seemed somber, the pacing of the meal was off, and many of the dishes were uninspiring bordering on inedible.", "author": "Benjamin K."}

Our experience, eating in the group room, at Atelier Crenn was just short of appalling. \n\nService-- unbelievably slow (4 hours for dinner), cold (no smiles), disinterested, incompetent. They forgot an entire course-- when we pointed it out, there was no apology, they just begrudgingly brought it out. The descriptions of the dishes were as short and uninformative as possible. They poured wine without ever explaining what we were drinking. This is NOT OK when you're running up a $4000 tab. \n\nFood-- what is this nonsense? I give them credit for creativity, but that's about it. The food itself was some combination of bland, uninteresting, uncomfortable (an entire plate of grains and seeds?), or microscopic. There were a few highlights out of 9 courses, namely the Uni and the funky fake beet dessert, but for the most part, this was a series of pretentious, misguided plates. And you WILL be hungry afterwards. \n\nDo not go here. This restaurant has clearly lost its way, forget the food-- service of this caliber should be unacceptable, and yet it seemed to be totally normal to be treated this way. We saw the waitress on the street after leaving, and even at a freaking APPLEBEES they'd at least acknowledge that they just served you, but this woman looked us all right in the eye and pretended that we didn't just spend 4 hours and thousands of dollars with her.

I'm pleased we opted for the supplement to the tasting menu (which more than doubled the $220 cost to $478 per person).  And, I'm pleased to have satisfied my long-standing curiosity by coming here and making the most of it.  \n\nWithout doubt, the high point of the evening was the arrival of bowls with pumpkin cream in the bottom, followed by shaving of white truffles into the bowls, and then the arrival of a full size pumpkin on the table.  After some moments, the pumpkin was opened to reveal two trays of Hokkaido uni which were each transferred to the bowls.  Thereupon, a young man from the kitchens appeared, he had slightly unkept blondish hair, a glowing and slightly well-fed appearing face, and he was holding a steaming small pot of truffle butter.  He was the butter man, and he looked the part!  He spooned the butter into the bowls, softening the truffles and releasing their aroma.  The uni and truffle combination was very nice and the quality of the uni seemed first rate.\n\nThe low point, unfortunately, was a dish that held promise but ultimately disappointed.  This was abalone served with a green sauce which I cannot recall the composition of.  The abalone had been cooked until it was soft, perhaps one might say soggy.  The green sauce seemed to have little flavor, the dish seemed partially cold and partially hot, and the whole concept just didn't work.  There were enough other dishes that this particular one was relatively easy to overlook but it was a sad waste of abalone.\n\nSo, this was a first-rate dinner without any doubt.  But, all things considered, knowing what I know now, is it an experience I would repeat?  Right now I find myself saying no.  For the same price, my wife and I could have overdosed on supplemental sushi at Kusakabe for two dinners and found ourselves more satisfied.  It was worth it to satisfy my curiosity and experience Atelier Crenn, but at this point I don't plan to return.  Perhaps my feeling could change with time or I may have out of town guests who similarly could appreciate such a dining experience, I'll just have to see.", "author": "Richard P."}

We were seated in a space where we could see into the narrow, almost laboratory-looking kitchen.  \n\nThe courses were described when they were served and it was quite fun to match the poem with its corresponding dish.  The food is so incredibly complex yet familiar. Every dish has many different components of whimsy and comfort.  All of the pieces just fit together in such a thoughtful way.  The stand-out dishes for us were the mackrel with coconut sauce, iberico ham and squid, carrot jerky, abalone and oyster, eucalyptus popsicles served within a eucalyptus plant, grains/seeds/dash/yuzu, lobster bisque with transparent gelee, test tube of guava with chia seeds.  I could write an essay about each magical presentation, the nuances in flavor, the superior ingredients, etc. but I'll spare you.  \n\nNow for my only critique. The bathrooms.  Why, oh why does the toilet paper have a lock on it at an establishment so highly regarded?  Why are the gray subway tiles reminiscent of a BART bathroom and why was it dirty?  Sigh.

Yes, it is a restaurant (a cutting edge one) that serves food, tastes and \"fulfilling\" of the stomach. But it elevates dining to many levels over and above that.... imagery and imagination, visual and mental satisfaction, artistry and re-created nature that can be devoured at the end.\n\nFor $160 (full tasting menu in Aug 2012), more than 10 mini-courses and 4+ hours, we were propelled away from Earth to a culinary cosmic galaxy that baffles and intrigues both the cerebral and visceral beings in us. It is similar to reading Alice in Wonderland or watching the first Star Wars episode when they were first introduced, that it represents nothing that anyone has experienced before.\n\nExample 1 (see photo), two tiny renowned Olympic raw oysters rest peacefully in the company of white \"sea\" foams and tiny green asparagus tips. The server slowly pours a green seaweed sauce to make a pond that immerses the oysters. You look at it, contemplate and let your mind wander off to wherever whatever, before you fork it over to your mouth.\n\nExample 2 (see photo), a small bird nest made from corn silks is sitting on top of some twigs (dark chocolate sticks and mushroom stems). The nest is filled with tiny white eggs (made from fish or whatnot). So natural, so poetic! The hardest part is to have to eat them up!\n\nExample 3 (see photo), a pile of irregular pieces of white and dark rocks (chocolate candies) is covered partially with some white ash (white chocolate powders), all sitting on a glass plate supported by a stand. The server pours water to a bowl of dry ice inside the stand to create instant white smokes that ooze out through small holes, gliding across the table in all directions.

It connected perfectly with the poem on the menu. Many unique presentation such as the palette cleanser in a rock and the plant that held the ice cream. And also the amazing and delicious desserts, it reached the holy trinity of food perfection, concept, presentation, taste, it was all there.\n\nCon: Honestly it is way overpriced for the amount and quality of the food you get. If I haven't ate a large lunch, I would have left starving. Another thing was, not all the dishes were tasty. The food either tasted amazing or bad. The most amazing dish was the frozen foie gras and the Kir Royale. Service was also awkward and felt rehearsed. They wouldn't let me have my bread! I know, I shouldn't whine about it, but don't snap at me when I ask for bread. I was told, \"We only serve bread with the specific course, you will get your bread two courses later.\" Ok......... The worse part was the timing between each dish got slower and slower until we waiting for more than 30 minutes for the dessert dish to come out.\n\nSummary: You will be amazed when they set the dish in front of you, but when you finish tasting the meal you will soon forget it. You leave with the feeling of incompleteness, why couldn't have everything been as amazing as the dessert? The concept and presentation is there ,but many of the dishes and the service needs refinement.\n\nMAIN POINT: Go if you have money to burn, but if you are looking a for an amazing once in a life time meal skip this place. \n\nStart of Photos: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA#n8DIjaTuskjVk6bMYNsQhw", "author": "Erica B."}

I've dined at a solid number of Michelins before, and this was by far the most memorable experience I've had at any of them. There's so much to say about this restaurant that I hardly know where to begin..\n\nMenu: Definitely one of the most unique touches of the experience. It's composed as a poem, with each line representing a course. As it's not a literal translation, you don't know what exactly you're getting, but once the dishes come out, it makes a lot of sense, symbolically.\n\nFood: We did the grand tasting menu that had 20 (or was it 21?) courses. Each dish is quite small - can be eaten in 2-3 tiny bites, but as there were 21 of them, we were definitely satiated and satisfied by the end of the meal. There's really no big breaks between the courses - everything went pretty quickly, and we still managed to stay there for over 3 hours! The food was spectacular; you could tell the ingredients were the freshest a restaurant will ever be able to get their hands on and the details were stunning. Presentation of the food was incredible too; each course had a distinct flavor and experience of its own, and was uniquely presented. Textures, tastes... absolutely amazing.\n\nService: Also hands down the best I've experienced at a Michelin. Our waiter was professional (a given), but more importantly, he was personable, accommodating, witty, and in general, extremely pleasant. One thing I have to harp on about Michelin restaurants is that you're generally treated with an air of pretentiousness if you don't come looking like you're pretentious yourself, and this was definitely not the case at Atelier Crenn. They're really managed to get the cream of the crop when it comes to great restaurant service.\n\nOverall... I would say that Atelier Crenn is fully deserving of its 2 Michelin stars. Very rarely will I visit a Michelin twice; usually, a one-time experience is enough. But Atelier Crenn is a different story. The whole experience was perfect; I wouldn't have changed anything about our dinner that night, and I'm definitely looking forward to a return visit to see what new things they come up with!", "author": "Chrystal Z."}

I came here already a fan of the long-form 5 hour tasting menu, and even then I still think this dinner was lengthy.  I'll probably take a break from tasting menus for a while.  Maybe conciseness is a good thing after all?\n\nThat said, the food here is exceptionally creative, with a definite flair for the whimsy that makes it stand out above other restaurants in the tier.  \n\nSome dishes were a little difficult to figure out, like a tiny carrot jerky served on a really big wooden log, or an Iberico ham broth for a chewy squid morsel.  One dish, which focused on Thai flavors, with a tempura fried turnip, red chili, and basil didn't really mesh with the rest of the courses, but maybe that's just a California thing.  Even so, they were still very well prepared. One exception that night was an abalone dish served in its own shell with a yuzu foam --the abalone was a little tough and chewy, which is really only noticeable after having a fantastic and tender abalone steak at Saison recently.  \n\nOthers dishes were simply transcendent, such as the signature seeds and grains dish, which combined umami with salty, earthy, tender, gentle, and crunchy all at once and with a sense of great nostalgia.  Speaking of crunch, I think texture was a definite highlight and a theme throughout; they do amazing work balancing texture in different ways throughout the meal.  The constructions are all very creative and wonderful to discover, such as a lobster-bisque creation that had various fixings arranged on a solid dashi gelee that formed a window atop the bowl, so you had to punch through it to mix the fixings in with the soup (what fun!).\n\nAnother big highlight were the dessert rounds.  The pastry chef here does some extraordinary work.  The grand finale dessert course incorporated honey in basically every conceivable way and was presented with great flourish, with a sorbet impossibly shaped into a honeycomb, with honeycomb shaped crackers and various flavor gels, and a caramel stand made from fresh honeycomb that's presented table-side for full effect.  Really exciting stuff that made a perfect finish to the meal.\n\nThe service was top notch, but not the grandiose theatrical production as it is at some other top tier restaurants.  They were all very friendly and informative with impeccable timing.  There was only one small mishap, which was resolved above and beyond the call of duty.  \n\nThe wine pairing was pretty good, even including some sake, sherry, and beer for good measure.  The sommelier was very personable and extremely knowledgeable but seemed just a little busy.\n\nAll in all, Atelier Crenn is all about whimsy.  It's an adventure that will take a long time to finish, but the creativity and excitement make it well worth the ride.", "author": "Mike L."}

The food was meticulously assembled and beautiful. However the vegan courses were just the omnivorous dishes omitting all protein. There was no replacement and so the meal consisted of visually appealing and complex side dishes. There were many flavors but it was not satisfying and we had to eat afterwards. If Atelier Crenn chooses to continue offering a vegan tasting menu, in future hopefully the chef will incorporate beans or other vegan protein sources into her dishes. I also believe we were served dairy. \n\nBeautiful restaurant but definitely not for vegans.", "author": "Alex F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-11", "description": "Pay attention or you will miss it!  Let me start by getting this out of the way - This is a \"male\" dominated environment, and Chef Crenn holds her own. WELL DESERVED 2 Michelin stars.  WHEW!  Glad I did that.  Now, lets get to the basics.  This is NOT your every day dining. This is \"AFFORDABLE\" poetic molecular gastronomy meets unapologetic technique.  Chef and her immaculate team, make the elite \"food geek\" experience, approachable to the everyday self proclaimed home foodie that can't afford French Laundry or El Bulli (SIGH!) but wants to feel that experience once in a lifetime.  The restaurant is small, immaculate, tastefully demure (if you blink, you WILL miss it). It seems innocuously unpretentious - no dress code - but it is creatively pretentiously approachable.  EVERYTHING is calculated - down to the \"physique\" of all the staff - some are taller and tower over the environment where they can navigate the deceptively tight quarters, and some are \"shorter\" and can engage the sitting diner with refrained but unmistakable passion for the master behind the vision.  The menu is concealed in \"poetry\", with each \"amuse bouche\" serving totally confusing your senses - you think you understand what you see, yet your primitive palate will know EXACTLY what you have ingested - leaving you visually stimulated and palately pleased.  Its crazy, crazy delicacy in motion.  I know self proclaimed poets that come from the science and physics world - and their mathematical poetry is PAINFULLY calculated and not human, almost metalic cold boredom... Chef is as mathematical and calculating, yet the food is fluid, beautiful and sublime yet - familiar... A salad is no larger than the bottom of a tea cup... dainty microgreens carefully tweezed into a merengue... you pop the entire portion in your mouth, and the merengue shell melts into an oh-so-familiar vinaigrette - a one bite SALAD!  An ENTIRE bowl in ONE PERFECT HARMONIOUS BITE! \n\nThis is the kind of place that transcends cooking shows, home cooking, Star Trek gastronomy... It overwhelms and soothes.  Call for reservations.  She books 4 months in advance.  But if you want to have an experience you can not cook at home (unless you are a molecular gastronomist or a crazy scientist) - this super thin, in-your-face-Im-here-and-you-will-be-blow-away (but thank you for loving my food) Artistic gastronomist, is simply delightful.  And her staff will pamper you and satiate you until you feel like you are the \"only one in the room\"... \n\nI originally tried to get into Coqueta... but Chiarello was booked out four months.  I won't confess to how I got a mid week table - suffice to say you have to follow my twitter to see what happened... And understand that this Chef came recommended BY OTHER CHEFS!!!!\n\nI wish I could comment on EVERY dish and pairing... but I'd be writing for a couple of years... Being middle class workers, after the first \"amuse bouche\" serving (a cocoa butter sphere filled with apple cider that POPS in your mouth for an aperitif in a little ball) we honestly thought we would run to Micky D's for a burger after the meal... NOPE.  This is the kind of place that was literally \"KILLING ME SOFTLY\" with their song... tiny, dainty portions and wine pairings... you WILL leave satiated... (and I eat like a truck driver...) - not as in bored but as in going into a peaceful food comma.  This is one of the SNOBBIEST UNSNOBBY meals I have experienced.  Seriously.  I thank Chef Russell Jackson for having pitched several GREAT San Francisco restaurants for my attention, and pointed me to Chef Crenn... A once in a lifetime experience.  Not \"cheap eats\" but certainly worth the $250 pp we left at the table.  I got to meet Chef, and she is one impressive lady - she truly loves what she does, makes no excuses and is sincerely happy to \"dance\" with you - literally - the service and food is one harmonious dance.", "author": "Rita V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-05", "description": "One of the best fine dining restaurants in San Francisco. \nNo wonder Chef Dominique Crenn beat Michael Symon at 'Iron Chef America.'\n\nIn short, it was '11 courses, 4 hours, $230.00 per person' of the artistic culinary journey with beautiful presentations and heavenly deliciousness. \n\nIf you like Atelier Crenn, you may feel like receiving 'the certificate of completion of 11 course dinner.'  If you don't like Atelier Crenn, you may need a \"I survived 11 course dinner at Atelier Crenn!' T-shirt. \n\nThree friends and I arrived at the restaurant around 15 minutes earlier than our reservation but the hostess kindly seated us. There were three choices in the menu. 'Vegetable Tasting Menu $95.00', 'Chef's Tasting Menu $125.00' and 'Fours Courses Prix Fixe Menu $75.00.' Since the paces of the dinner are different between Tasting Menu and Prix Fixe, all of us had to order the same thing and we decided to try 'Chef's Tasting Menu.' \n\nHere are some of the dishes that wowed us. \n\n*** Kir Breton *** \"Please gently pick up the sphere, close your month completely and bite it.\" Our 11 courses started with the explosion! The chef's mother loved Kir so this was homage to her mother. Also French people drink Kir before starting meals so it was a very French way to start the courses. \n\n*** Ocean and Land *** Wagyu beef tartare and smoked sturgeon pearls. Probably the best wagyu that I had in the USA. It just melted on my tongue. The texture of the beef and the smoky flavor of the pearls gave me the sense of having smoked salmon in my mouth. \n\n*** \"Broken\" Avocado *** The avocado was frozen in the 'liquid nitrogen' and literary broken into pieces by the chef. It had a really playful combination of the flavors with grapefruit, tarragon and popcorn sauce. The sourdough had some Asian flavor such as sesame oil. \n \n***  Foie Gras \"Log\" *** The foie gras was first milk-poached then frozen and shaved. The chef created a log with the shaved fois gras. It was not only beautiful but delicious. One the log, there were pieces of pickled cherries which looked like flowers fallen on the log. The apricot, vanilla and oat added more texture and the flavors to it.     \n\n *** Olives *** I really loved this presentation. The olive-infused and olive-shaped ice cream/sorbet was served on a real log. At that time, I didn't say anything but my brain was working like this. \"Wow, olive ice cream on a camp fire log. How cool! Olive? Hmmmm. Mediterranean Sea? But where? Southern France? But where?\" And I found the chef had created white pebbles and brown moss with some ingredients and she put them right next the olive. \"OMG. Those white pebbles....white pebbles. The soil of Mt. Sainte-Victoire. The white rocky mountain that C\u00e9zanne loved and painted over and over.\"  The food was thought-provoking like that. \n\n*** Mignardises *** Wow!  Those small bite-size sweets were served under the bonsai tree grown by Chef Crenn. I thought, \"Bonsai tree = Japonisme = Impressionisme?\" \n\n**** Important Information****\n1. Make a reservation for the main dinning room. Not Garden Room.\n2. Don't come here when you are starving. They do not served bread because if they do, the guests that have 11 course-Tasting Menu will be full by the 6th course. Even after 11 courses, we didn't not have the bleh-we-had-too-much-food feelings.\n3. Don't come here before your show or any appointments. You need around 2 hours 30 minutes - 4 hours depending on what you order. The food here is the show!   \n4. Choose smart dinning companion(s). There are many 10-15 minute breaks after your server takes your plates.  You need someone who can carry conversations during those breaks. At the same time, these breaks are the transition stages when you walk away from one painting then reach another painting. \n5. When people are enjoying artistic food at a fine dining restaurant like this, the flash of a camera gets annoying. Please turn off the flash of your camera. It just ruins other people's experience. \n \nIf three chefs in San Francisco Bay Area are making watches, Chef Thomas Keller is making Patek Philippe watches, Chef Gary Danko is making Rolex watches and Chef Dominique Crenn is making Cartier watches. Three of them are equally exquisite but they are just different. And I love Chef Crenn's creative unique dishes since they were the first dishes that made me think a lot of things as if I had been at an art museum. \n\n The service was excellent except one time when our wine glasses were empty for 8 minutes. Chef Crenn kindly visited our table twice and we enjoyed chatting with her. That was one of many memorable moments at Atelier Crenn. \n\nIf you like art, you will love this restaurant. Her dishes may be too avant-garde to some guests but Monet's paintings were avant-garde at the first Impressionist Exhibit in Paris.\n\nNow, I have three favorite French Impressionists. \nMonet in painting, Debussy in music and Chef Crenn in a culinary world.\n\nHighly recommended!", "author": "Manabu M."}

You were pretty as a picture or I guess you prefer to liken yourself to a poem, but the beauty I saw with my eyes did no translate to tastiness in my tummy. Like a pretty painting, you were a great feast to the eyes but actually inedible. I had been warned that the signature courses ($120) were not worth it but I just wasn't in the mood to commit to the chef's grand tasting menu ($195) that night. So what went wrong the night we met? \"The Sea\", as you so poetically termed it, was a disaster of a dish. I do not think the ingredients were properly treated as they tasted fishy and salty to the point that my friend and I could not finish the tiny portion you placed before us. Furthermore, the \"Land, Rose, Pomegranate\" quail entree was under cooked (read: bloody). That means 2 out of the 5 courses we had were unsatisfactory. This is not to say that you didn't have any shining moments. \"Walk in the Forest\" happens to be the tastiest mushroom dish I have yet to consume to date and I would recommend it to anyone. Also, \"Grains & Seeds, Dashi, Yuzu Kosho\" and \"Grape & Hazelnut\" were both very interesting creations. I see your potential but it just wasn't properly conveyed through your signature courses. I sometimes fall prey to the lazy proxy of utilizing expensiveness as a measure of quality but you are a poignant reminder of that fallacy.", "author": "Charlotte Z."}

By far one of the best presentation I have ever seen at a restaurant. Each dish had awesome looks and feel to it. \n\nNot all the dishes were great but there were a handful of delightful dishes. I would have to say that the beginning dishes were mediocre but gradually got better. Starting from the assortment of sashimi, to the trout, then to the bone marrow and caviar, then to the squab. Those dishes were superb. One desert was awesome looking and tasting. It looked like forest moss with twigs and berries but it was wonderful.....the lemon cookie mock truffle was pretty cool too. The pistachio olive was also very good!\n\nOnly reason I cant give 5 stars.....some of the dishes werent that tasty...one desert was awful.....it had an overpowering licorice taste. The starters o the tasting were also a disappointment. \n\nOne thing that really annoyed me  was a dish we were not served since we both had dietary restrictions on melons.

Many of these were truly wonderful experiences and yet I'd put Atelier Crenn up there only with the French Laundry in what i'd consider a life experience that i'll remember for some time.\n\nAfter some terrific help from their sommelier to help choose a bottle of wine, we also chose the grand tasting menu @$180/person.. The place is small and almost invisible on the street, fairly intimate and personal feeling. \n\nI loved the experience of not really having a menu, reading the next poem passage, and wondering what might come out. It just adds to the adventure and those of you who want to see a menu should let go a bit and just enjoy the ride..\n\nOne of the things I look for in a tasting menu is a culinary journey where each course surprises and delights, disappears quickly making you want more, only to be repeated by the next course. An experience where you reflect back on a memorable journey where some of the dishes stand out as some of the best things that you've eaten. For us, chef Crenn really delivered on all of these points.\n\nThe service was exceptional as you'd expect. Everyone from the sommelier to the rest of the staff made you feel like they cared that you had a great experience. I do think that the French Laundry did an even better job (impeccable really) but thats a really high bar to compare against and I feel as though Crenn's staff and Thomas Keller's are in that top tier that I can't necessarily say about some of the other places that i've been.\n\nThanks to the staff and chef Crenn for a very memorable night.

Company shenanigans and crazies aside, I'll dive right into the dining experience where we had the 9 course with wine pairings. Service was pretty damn amazing and attention to detail was better than an investment banker's eye on analyses and presentation. \n\nThere were three wines to start off with the appetizers. Six for courses. To start, the menu design and cuisine very reminiscent of Providence in LA. Very avant garde.\n\nAppetizer 1: Unlimited spoons of Iranian sturgeon caviar with light uni mousse and sweet balsamic vinegar. Tasted amazing - uni tasted like sweet tofu and the caviar was a nice touch. 5/5\n\nAppetizer 2: Maine diver sea scallops with squid ink. I believe the same diver scallops used at the French Laundry. Good, but a tad salty for me4/5\n\nAppetizer 3: Salsify, candied cauliflower, with white chocolate and graham. 5/5\n\nAppetizer 3: Apple cider encased in cocoa butter and kirsch dollop. Great starter. The experience in your mouth is unreal. 5/5\n\nCourse 1: Grains and seeds: quinoa buckwheat, pumpkin, sturgeon and roe with dashi broth. Cereal for adults?! 4/5\n\nCourse 2: Cured aji sashimi with turnip leaves tempura and beets. This dish was topped with Himalayan shaved ice. Amazing. Tasted like sashimi fresh out of the water dashed with ice. 5/5\n\nCourse 3: Squid, Iberico ham, and Lardo with a black truffle broth. Tasted alright, but wished the portion was bigger. 4/5.\n\nCourse 4: King crab risotto with an obscene amount of white truffle flakes. Through backroom chatter, the truffle flakes are supplementary at $100 per person. This was arguably the BEST dish of the whole tasting. Flavor topped with MORE flavor. 6/5\n\nCourse 5: Viscous duck egg yolk in porcini broth capped with a slice of white truffle and a salty burst from pate. Didn't like this much. Broth was a little too salty, but nice texture..\n\nCourse 6: Wagyu beef steak with baby portobello mushrooms, brussels sprouts, and apple glazing. Wagyu isn't as overrated as many have thought..tender and sweet steak. 5/5\n\nCourse 7: Supplementary les fromages. This was a good supplement after the steak. 5/5\n\nCourse 8: Beet Sorbet, Toasted Oats, Chocolate and Coffee Crumbles, Sheep's Milk Yogurt, Chocolate, and Mandarin Pur\u00e9e. A dessert designed not only to look like a beet, but taste even better than one. 5/5\n\nCourse 9: Mignardises\n\nOverall, very pleased with the experience/ambiance, food, and service.", "author": "Thomas L."}

I have to compare it to other restaurants at the same level and price (Saison, Fleur de Lys, Quince, Benu, Cyrus) and sadly it's not close.\n\nEach course looked beautiful, but the flavors were just not impressive.  The best part was the classic wine pairing actually, the choices were excellent.  \n\nI was really put off by how much up-selling was going on. Never had a fine dining place be like that.  Another annoyance was the fact that they only have one unisex bathroom, which you can see from the dining room and faces the kitchen staff.  There was a line all night.  Kind of gross to pay $200 per person and watch the bathroom door sliding open and closed for 3 hours.  I spent too much time watching for the line to get short.  \n\nThe place is very loud and the tables along the side wall are very close together.

Then we tried it and have been back every week since, for 2.5 months so far. It has only been getting better. We feel like children after eating Crenn's amazing dishes because they are playful, sometimes magical, and they are lovingly crafted as if by a mother nourishing her children with the highest quality and beauty that the earth has to offer. Chef Crenn bares herself emotionally through her food and it is truly a privilege to feel her vulnerability, her love of family, her appreciation for the fruits of farm labor, and how lucky she feels to have her own restaurant (which she richly deserves). The pastry chef, Juan, is a genius and I love his palette as well. \n\nI have tried all of the dishes and my current favorites are the wagyu tartare with pearls of smoked sturgeon, the 'sea' (I often order this as two of my courses), the duck with smoked buckwheat and strawberries or cherries, the foie torchon with apricot and cinnamon streusel, the asparagus with trout caviar and goat hollandaise, the jardin, and the prawn a la plancha, I enjoy all of the dishes frankly but those are the ones I really crave again and again. Some of the complimentary items are ones that I would order if I needed to including the beet meringues and the cucumber sorbet intermezzo.\n\nThe three things I feel could use improvement are the bathroom (although it's nicely decorated, there's only one), the cheese course, and the pain au lait.\n```````````````\nExamples of playfulness: The pork thailandaise was served with cucumber marinated melon and melon marinated cucumber.

I say experience because I've never had a meal where I had no idea what I was going to be eating (even their website tells you nothing) The \"menu\" is a poem written by the chef, with each line describing the food that you're going to be eating. It was kind of fun to guess what your next dish would be but there's no way I could remember by heart what each one was. \n\nPresentation was exceptional and each course was so delicious that I have a hard time figuring out which was my favorite (and which was my least favorite). Consistently, every single dish was a hit for me. We had the 12-16 course menu (because that's all they offered that night, so it's not like we had a choice) so be prepared for at least a 2-3 hour dinner. There were times where the dishes were gimmicky but you could easily tell all the thought and detail that was put into each dish so you didn't care. I truly think this is one of those restaurants where you should come with only one person and just talk about the food to really enjoy it. Don't come in a group because that'll distract you from really knowing what you're eating. \n\nProbably one of the best meals I've had in SF. \n\nTIPS:\n- The restaurant doesn't have an obvious sign so be aware of the address and find the restaurant that way. We definitely walked past it and had to backtrack to find it. \n- As mentioned above, they only offer one menu (the grand tasting menu) on weekends and the only thing they ask you is if you have any food allergies. If you don't want to spend that much, come on the weekday to get the abbreviated menu. This meal, while fantastic, is definitely NOT nice to your wallet.", "author": "Diana Y."}

My husband and I agonized for a while which one to do b/c our friends had gifted us w/ the 5 course, but since we were all the way here, dressed up, and it had been a while since we've treated ourselves out like this, we might as well go all the way right?

FAILED.\n\nIt was new, great, maybe a little fun, but the poem provided very little direction when we were trying to choose between to two menus. However, once we made the jump, we kept a copy of the poem w/ us during the meal and it was such a culinary adventure that I had never experienced before. The mystery, the ambiguity, and just the openness to personal interpretation made our meal so special. It forced my husband and I to have conversation about super abstract things that we normally don't engage in, so it was pretty amazing for us on many levels. We even got to ask Chef Dominique Crenn about certain lines of the poem and her thoughts, and it was just incredibly enjoyable for our minds and ALL of our senses!\n\nFOOD\nIt was like the poem provided us clues to a story that only we could unlock, and seeing the incredible creations being brought over to the neighboring tables (who by the way ALL got the Grand Tasting Menu) this meal truly unfolded into a colorful and rich story that takes you through all four seasons and through the elements of the earth.\n\nThe presentation for each course brought me to a special place. Many of the contraptions that the meal is served on was built/created by the Chef herself. Super detailed, super impressive!\n\nSince sans-alcohol is how I roll, they have a few great non alcoholic concoctions to enjoy. I deeply appreciated that. I'd also like to add that it was reasonably priced (b/c I got a $28 yuzu lemonade from Baume which I didn't realize would be $28, and that was...... a surprise)\n\nSERVICE\nService was impeccable. For a place of this caliber, I thought everything was well executed. Nothing fell short. The fact that the chef comes out and greats each guest during their meal, is a wonderful touch.  I'm impressed that she can run a tight kitchen and still come out and greet people with a handshake and a smile. That goes above and beyond. \n\nFACILITIES/AMBIANCE\nThe restaurant was decorated in a minimalistic, clean fashion and the noise level was reasonable. Bathroom was reasonably clean, maybe a little dark for my personal taste.\nI enjoyed the art installations here and there using a bunch of natural elements (which I think I overheard correctly, that the chef created as well! What can she NOT do?)\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nThe only other \"molecular gastronomy\" type restaurant I've ever been to was Baume in Palo Alto. I was SORELY disappointed by that meal by the way (except for the dessert). If you're trying to pick between the two (Baume and Atelier Crenn) go with Atelier Crenn. HANDS DOWN. That said, I can't wait to one day go to Alinea... \n\nWould I recommend this place to a friend? Oh yes...", "author": "Irene C."}

I've heard this saying from many people but could never fully understand what the heck an \"experience\" is.... but after my dinner at Atelier Crenn, I was finally able to understand what that means.\n\nChef Dominique Crenn is quite the chef... she took me on an amazing journey.\nShe let me experience food like I never have before. And of course we were able to meet Chef Crenn when she visited our table and we were able to leisurely chat for a bit which was quite nice :)\n\nMake no mistake... this place is not for the commoner... even if you're willing to splurge on a meal... Because if you're \"splurging on a meal\"... then it most likely means you can't afford it.... seriously lol... \n\nOf course I did the Grand Tasting Menu that consisted of 12 courses.\nI was seriously in awe... the food here will trip you out. \nI can go on and on about the food but this is one of those things where you have to experience it yourself to understand it...\n\nThis place is very expensive... and rightfully so (being a two-star Michelin rated restaurant)... and if you can easily buy a 300 dollar meal and not blink an eye... then you should def come here. Otherwise... don't come until you do. It's one of those things where you'll count your dollars if you do come without the Benjamin's to back you up. \n\nOh and don't forget it is a 3 hour meal (pretty much mandatory). So keep that in mind and don't come hungry when you come here... Think 13 small courses over the span of 3 hours... yeah... So if you have the money and the time... then def come here.. you'll be blown away.\nIf not, you'll be let down and wondering why the hell you came here when you could have gotten 300 cheeseburgers instead... \nBut this is def a place where you should come at least once in your life so make sure you put this place in your bookmarks for a long time! :)", "author": "Michael K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-03", "description": "Atelier Crenn is the total package; already donning two Michelin stars this venue is going to be a trendsetter in fine dining. The space is small and has tasteful, somewhat understated contemporary decor. While tables are close together they are sufficiently large and acoustics favorable enough that you feel neither cramped nor bothered by noise. Everything about the place is beautiful; from the artistic presentations of the food to the serving vessels to the art adorning the walls. Such a pleasing, upscale yet comfortable ambiance.\n\nThis was the first meal of our California trip where we found service to be at the same level as we are accustomed to at top tier venue in Chicago and New York. Service was nearly flawless. Perfect combination of polished yet warm and personable. Wonderful attention to detail and accommodation of dietary aversions. The sommelier also was warm and knowledgeable; he did a masterful job implementing a mini pairing within our stated wine budget (the full pairings are a bit pricey, but based on the wines we sampled they may well be worth the splurge as what we consumed was phenomenal; there is no cocktail program).There was not a single service gaffe or issue with pacing being too slow or hurried.\n\nAtelier Crenn features two tasting menus; five courses for $95 and twelve for $190 (portions are larger for the shorter menu); the menu is not spelled out but hinted at through a poem resulting in a surprise aspect of what is coming next - after the first couple of courses you do know it will be amazing. Tonight we opted for the five courses and added e supplemental cheese course (two cheeses for $25 that can be shared; additional cheeses can be added). This meal was a case where each dish (and even the extra bites such as a delicious cucumber granita/melon sorbet palate cleanser) had a wow factor and were memorable. Presentations were stunning and ingredients top quality with intriguing combination of favors and textures that married perfectly. Each course from the amuse bouche (a ball with a thin layer of chocolate  covering a cider filing) to the mind blowing deconstructed beet dessert (which looked just like a beet on its root yet was comprised mainly of chocolate and beet sorbet with other accompaniments) had interesting blends of sweet and savory. This aspect reminded me of Schwa whereas the modern and whimsical nature of the courses were reminiscent of Alinea and Moto and the prettiness of the plating and use of edible flowers reminded me of Elizabeth (venues I love back home in Chicago). Chef Crenn uses modern techniques masterfully; never as a gimmick but only to improve the taste. \n\nWhile some reviews complain abut portions being stingy and leaving hungry this was not the case for me. I commenced my meal starving but after consuming the delicious mignardises (the salted caramel was especially wonderful) I was quite comfortable; sure I could have eaten more but I certainly did not feel the need.\n\nPerhaps the only disappointment on the night occurred at the tail end. Several reviews had mentioned that Chef Crenn often spends some time mingling with patrons; this did not occur tonight. Also there was no offer of a kitchen tour, souvenir menu, or take home pastry to enjoy the next day and invoke memories of the wonderful meal of which some or all I have experienced at other multi Michelin starred venues; in fact there was not even anybody at the front to bid adieu or offer to hail a cab. Despite this anticlimactic finale, the other 99% of our just over two hour dinner was flawlessly executed across the board and clearly ranks within one of my top ten meals. The definition of three Michelin stars is \"worth a special journey\"; after my dining experience at Crenn tonight I might just have to plan another trip to San Francisco to partake in the twelve course grand tasting menu.", "author": "Erick N."}

The combinations of flavors and the pairings of different ingredients was so finely crafted. I would have to say that you should be an adventurous, open-minded eater at this place. Some of the dishes are pretty creative and experimental, and some are strange and otherworldly. You have to be very receptive of eating things that really don't appear to be edible at all. To be completely truthful, I would say dining here is less about \"good food\" than it is about truly extraordinary works of culinary art. It was all very pleasing to the senses, and it's really hard to pinpoint highlights and favorites; there was just so much going on! But what I remember is not how this or that dish tasted, but rather the lingering sense of awe at these exquisite creations. \n\nSo all in all, a truly unique experience.

Chef Crenn has an amazing creative culinary mind that takes food to another level from flavor and texture to visual presentation.  It is a well deserved 2 Michelin Stars for Atelier Crenn.\n\nDecor: sleek, modern but homey with wood accents and warm colors.  The silverware (which K was in love with) evoked memories of the fonts that are used on the menu.  Everything is done with purpose within Atelier Crenn.  \n\nService: Everyone is on top of it, no glass left unfilled, no plate left empty before you too long and just impeccable what they do.  I had a little \"oopsy\" on my amuse bouche and right away, another was brought to the table.  The servers were patient in explaining and re-explaining the questions and everything was extremely well orchestrated.  What you expect when you go to fine dining is this amazing service and it was provided.\n\nFood: Of course the highlight of the evening.  From the poetic menu, you don't really get a sense of what is coming but you just dive right in and trust Chef Crenn.  They ask for food allergies and preferences and K had told them about her dislike for raw foods and they went out of their way to make some minor alterations to their dishes to accommodate her.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-14", "description": "I won't try to put my own spin on what everybody else has been saying. We got the $180 Grand Tasting Menu, with wines by the glass as recommended by the sommelier. Overall, this was a pretty amazing (and very unique) experience, and I agree with the general consensus of the other reviews. \n\nWe were satisfied in many ways: our taste buds danced gleefully, our eyes were dazzled, our imaginations were teased, and our noses were delighted. \n\nHowever, our stomachs felt a little left out of the fun. By the time dessert came out, we were Yelping other restaurants nearby where we could grab something a bit more filling. As it was late, and most other appealing restaurants were closed (even Pizza Orgasmica), we just stopped by McD's on the way home to finish off the night. \n\nA few notes about the service, starting with the more surprising:\n\nThey forgot a course! We didn't realize until the end of the meal, after we watched a couple of other tables more closely, that they completely skipped one of our courses. Once we asked about it, the server brought it out at the end (after our final dessert), with a short apology. It wasn't a big deal, but it was surprising that between the kitchen staff, the main server, the runners, and the bussers ... nobody noticed that an entire course had been skipped. \n\nThe server at the table next to us also almost knocked over my wine glass a couple of times. I had to move my glass, which was already some 6 inches from the edge of the table, to give him room to move around safely, and I'm sure he was completely oblivious to it. \n\nI also had mentioned in the reservation that it was my wife's birthday. I reiterated this over the phone when they confirmed the reservation. None of their staff mentioned anything about her birthday that night. Again, not a big deal, but almost every other fine restaurant we've been to on a birthday or anniversary would do something, if not write \"Happy Birthday\" in chocolate, then at least a verbal mention with a smile. When Dominique Crenn came out to do her rounds of hellos, I was really expecting that she would wish my wife a happy birthday. But she shook our hands, asked how everything was, asked where we were from, and moved on to the next table. \n\nLastly, I'm not crazy about the menu concept. Yes, it's very artsy, and I'm sure lots of work and creativity went into coming up with a poem for the menu. But, for several of the dishes, the servers hurried through the description, and gave it while walking around the table setting down the food. So my wife caught bits of the first half of the description, and I caught bits of the second half. Together, we were able to piece together some of the main components of the dish. But having a real menu would've helped us better understand and appreciate what we were eating. For example, I think the server said one of the dishes was a tartare of raw lamb and raw eel, which would be quite unique. But I'm not 100% sure if that's what they said, so I guess I'll never know whether I've had raw lamb and raw eel. \n\nIn summary: It's well worth it to do it once. You can decide yourself whether you'd come back after the first time. For us, the answer is no. But it was money well spent for the one-time experience. \n\nPS: The quail/squab was AMAZING!", "author": "Phil Y."}

As we arrived to honor our boss for the evening, she visited our table to welcome us, which provided a personal brush that would mark the sincerity of this restaurant.\n\nThe space is clean, tightly kept, and respects the line. Lightly colored seats, modest tables and a reserved tone focus you on the impending procession of bites.\n\nEach dish is developed in a way to comically confuse you yet infuse a sense of adventure into every bite. We approached the five course.\n\n\"The Sea\", the second course, was a knockout. Carefully painted onto the plate, foams with fragrance and various items from the sea kept your eyes closed in joy. The Uni was unlike any I've ever had. Sweet, smooth, and could turn anyone into a sushi fan.\n\n\"Walk in the Forest\", third course, depicts the solitude of a private path in the woods. Various mushrooms line the linear dish, with the seasoning playing not only a culinary role, but also that of catered details on the white dish. \n\nThese two dishes stood out, but we finished on a desert derived from the mind of Juan Contreras that was of another world.\n\nA radish sorbet, that came in the form of it's name, with roots made in chocolate. Wild, fun, and sweet, this palate cleanser and refreshing desert pushed what I knew set flavors could be.\n\nThese two, Dominique and Juan, have developed something here. Ironically, this restaurant sits in \"the triangle\", a vast departure from the maturity and grace observed here, but it works.

We were unfortunately not hungry enough to go for the 10 or 12 course tasting (the table next to us kept raving throughout their meal about the artistic and divine food but still had to abort part way through). \n\nWe chose the four course and the wine pairing.  It was excellent and we would definitely go back. \n\nAmuse bouche:  tomato gelee with pine nuts and micro-basil. \n\nFirst course: \"Le Jardin\" pickled vegetables:  tomato, turnip, beets, carrots, crispy rice.  Very light and just the right amount of pickling.  \n\nSecond course:  \nI ordered the foie gras, which was poached in milk and chilled.  The diners next to us loved it, but I didn't appreciate it, although admittedly I prefer the stronger taste and texture of seared foie over pate to begin with. The milk muted the taste and made it more mousse-y in texture. \nMy BF and I both preferred his \"walk in the woods\" mushroom dish. \n\nIntermezzo: celery granita with apple and fennel foam (nice balance of flavors)\n\nThird course: I ordered The Sea (trout, with oyster, mussel and uni).  This was excellent.  My BF got the guinea hen souvis and liked it but it was a bit less distinctive. \n\nDesser:  He ordered the chocolate which was delicious, and I got the \nhoney with champagne foam (a play on the bellini).  I liked it but for the cardamom.  \n\nOverall everything was excellent so we are splitting hairs. We will be back and will try the longer tasting menu.", "author": "Vivian W."}

Unfortunately, we thought the food and experience was only so-so. Everything was impeccably presented, which was awesome in its on right, but at the end of the meal, we both kind of felt like \"oh..that's it?\"  The food was certainly very creative, but almost to the point where it felt a little gimmicky (like the poem of a menu).  I can see how the uniqueness has its appeal, and certain dishes were really great (like the grains!)  Ultimately, as awesome as the \"walk in a forrest\" dish looked, and as excited as we were to  eat  a dessert that looked like a carrot...the taste just didn't justify the 2 Stars and price tag in my opinion.\n\nI will say that I highly recommend this place to any of my vegetarian friends who are into fine dining, since Atelier Crenn does some really cool stuff with all-veggie dishes.", "author": "Andrew K."}

We had heard great things about Crenn  along with a few slight  negatives.   The food did not disappoint, the service was good  at the time of presentation, but dragged at times. The restaurant made an effort to recognize our special day  , including a custom menu message. We did not see the chef during our meal as others have mentioned , but that did not detract from the experience. \n\nThe presentation on the plates was unique, a sight to see. We had the 5 course meal with pairing , a  champagne to start and the supplemental cheese course. Our favorite was the wild mushroom course. The Beet sorbet dessert was visually stunning, but the taste was a bit subdued.    Crenn gave us a little treat and dessert  wine , in addition to  our dessert course . It was delicious! Our sommelier  was very  well trained and made the wine pairings memorable. His selections were excellent, he was actually  my favorite of our many servers. \n\nYou would expect the above niceties   from a 2 Michelin star restaurant like Crenn. They went through all the motions, but it fell just a bit short.  I wanted to give Crenn 5 stars, but there was something just a bit off about the timing of our meal. There were two occasions  where we went a good 25-30 minutes between removal of a course and the arrival of the next. We were dining for about 4 hours for the 5 courses. Given that these were tasting courses, the  gaps between courses were overlong. Since we had a  wine pairing as opposed to ordering a bottle  , there were  long stretches where we had no wine or  food on the table. There was another  table that had the 10 course tasting  that was sat before us and was still eating 4.5 hours after we arrived, I'm guessing it took 90 minutes longer for the ten course than the five. \n\n A wonderful experience and  glad I tried it. I'm not sure its a place that I would return to.", "author": "Brad S."}

It's really comparable to Coi in concept, but I felt it gives more bang for the buck.  You get a decent amount of proteins with the meal, unlike the vegetable heavy menu at Coi.  Standouts were the steak tartare and two different preparations of foie gras.  The desserts are outstanding as well, kudos to their talented pastry chef.  The \"Olive\" dessert was by far the most impressive dessert I've had at any restaurant, multidimensional and a great concept that was executed perfectly.  I would go back just for that dessert alone.  \n\nThe only drawback of the evening was the fact we were seated in the garden room.  It's a detached room in the back that they turned into an extension of the dining room.  We were the only ones seated there for more than half our dinner which was very awkward.  Later on another party was seated in the room as well.  The garden room is quieter and does not really evoke the same lively atmosphere as the main dining room.

I lost track of how many dishes were coming out, and the 5 rounds of dessert was a pleasant surprise as well. Overall, this beats out Coi and Benu of prior years. The dishes here also appear to play a little more with molecular gastronomy techniques than other places. I like the creative pairing of a poem for the season as a \"menu\" for what you're about to get. It's also wonderful that Chef Crenn has time to stop by at each table to say hi throughout the night. Lastly, excellent service from all the staff.\n\nThe vegetarian menu was excellent; it was fun to see how they substituted or tweaked things vs the omnivore's. From a raw ingredient price point of view, you're definitely getting pricier things by going meat (quite a bit of seafood actually), but really you're paying for the skill and creativity of the chefs here. (Plus, we're in SF, so you can get away with charging whatever you want to vegetarians.) I think only 2 of the 14 or so pre-dessert dishes had non-seafood pieces of meat? Nevertheless, I had possibly the best roasted wild mushrooms here, along with the best roasted broccoli in another dish. Also surprisingly excellent tempura beets in an earlier course. The honeycomb dessert was also a lot of fun; kudos to the pastry chef. The rose in the box of truffles was also a nice touch. :) This epic dinner took almost 5(!) hours, but my lovely companion and I hardly noticed, what with all the surprises presented one after another.

The modern cuisine is not so apparent in the Bay Area. Most restaurants such as French laundry, manresa and others are more classical French based food.

The service was great, as a two star restaurant should. But now, the food, every single course was sooo delicious in its own way(much better food that French laundry).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-25", "description": "As always, in a nutshell:\n\nFood: 4 stars\nP/C: 4 stars\nService: 4.5 stars\n\nIn so many words, Atelier Crenn was a culinary experience to be had nowhere else.  The meal was one of a kind, and the service was nearly flawless.  I've been meaning to go to this restaurant for a very long time, and more so partially because I started to follow Chef Crenn after such a memorable impression on the Food Network's Next Iron Chef show.  So ever since the opening of the restaurant, I've been itching.\n\nWe walked in on a cold night (the night of the Santa Con just as a side note) and immediately noticed the clean, minimalist interior, reminding me somewhat of a combination between that of Commonwealth and Benu.  We were seated right away and offered some water.  The server introduced herself and brought us the menu and the wine list.  \n\nWhat was most intriguing about the menu was the poetic expression of it - the chef apparently wrote a poem as she reflected on the season and translated the words into different dishes.  The entire meal consisted of about 5  savory courses, palate cleansers here and there, amuse-bouches, desset, and mignardises.\n\nWe started with a bottle of decent quality champagne and I continued on with the wine pairing.  The wine list was decent, although not extensive, understandable due to the limited space that it has (even the dessert kitchen was in a separate space).  The wine pairing was rather frisky and traveled throughout the world, with tendencies for Rhone and Tuscany.\n\nThe dishes were whimsical, well executed, and flavorful - that's all that matters.  I am generally a bit on the fence about restaurants that utilize something other than the plates and bowls to carry out their offerings.  Atelier Crenn was on the forefront of this - tree logs, syphon machines, and glasses.  But I didn't mind it.  I don't prefer it, but I didn't mind it.  I appreciated the quality of the ingredients - uni, local fish, vegetables, mushrooms were all creme-de-la-creme.  I think the chef preferred to use more seafood/fish ingredients and the meats - there were squab and duck dishes, but....no games for me, and they happily substituted with other non-game ingredients.\n\nThe service was pretty awesome - informative, balanced, and non-intrusive.  I, as usual, asked a lot of questions regarding the ingredients, the preparation techniques, and the wines - my server was right on the point, she knew the dishes, the ingredients, and the wines very well.  The dishes came not too fast, not too slow, just perfect intervals in between.  Cheff Crenn introduced herself during the meal and said good bye as she was leaving the kitchen.\n\nWe started the meal around 8pm and left the restaurant around 1:30am - a long long meal - impressed and satisfied in all aspects.  When the seasons change and the chef partakes in the new poem and through her cuisine, I will be back.", "author": "Mike P."}

Be ready for a long meal - 14 courses is a lot no matter how small they are. \n2. Get the cheese course. Yeah, I know, you're already doing 14 courses. Its worth it, though. \n3. Do the wine pairing. There were a few courses where you couldn't tell the difference between the wine and the food because they were so well matched. \n4. Go stand in the back and watch the chef plate the food. I stood back there for a few minutes and the sous chef invited me to come stand in the kitchen and watch if I liked. This was more of that same feel that Dominique provided when she came by the table and made us feel like guests in her home rather than customers. \n\nMy favorites were the squab, the beef tartar, and the squid courses.

This definitely isn't your typical everyday dining experience. There was a group of 7 of us and we had a reservation for the private room as we were celebrate two birthdays. \nOur menu was a little more personalized than the typical experience in the main dining room. Our individual menus showed our 9 course meal as well as adding a personal touch wishing happy birthday to our two guests of honor. \nAt first glance of the menu you wouldn't be able to guess what it was that you would be eating as each item is named in such a way that you would only guess the theme but not the ingredients; i.e. grains and seeds or the sea, or walk in the forest. \nEach course comes with a wine pairing (some did last for 2-3 courses). The staff was unbelievably exceptional in their attentiveness to serving our plates in unison. The flow was expertly done as well allowing each to enjoy their dish before moving on to the next course. Our lead server introduced each course explaining some of the ingredients and what theme the dish evoked. \nThis is supposedly a French restaurant but honestly I didn't necessarily think of it as being French, it definitely had Asian tones and flavors that were a fusion maybe of French and other types of culinary cuisine.

Accordingly, my husband and I tend to stay away from the plateau of expensive cuisine, since the greater amount of pay is not directly proportional to the deliciousness of the meal. Provided, the service attempts to make up for that difference, but I'd rather take a cheaper bill than be waited upon hand and foot.\n\nThankfully for value-oriented Husband and me, our meal was provided as part of his company's holiday party. And it had been a great year. So, there was no expense spared during our time there.\n\nAmong the tastiest bites, the hors d'oeuvres included a delicate and refreshing uni concoction and a shot with diver's scallops that stood out to me. While I appreciated the personalized menus that included 2 word course descriptions with the company logo, I was a little bummed that we weren't privy to the poem that is famously the daily inspiration for the menu. No matter, the food was poetry itself. Artfully plated and meticulously considered, the flavors were savory and satisfying, covering many different food groups. The highlight of the main courses for me was the lobster risotto. It had just the right amount of bite and creamy in its texture with the richness balanced by the thoughtful portion. And then, we added shaved truffle on top (for $100 per plate, mind you). I'm not a truffle fanatic, but wow. It definitely added another dimension to the risotto and elevated it into an even more complex but still tasty dish.\n\nThe food was very good. But I have to give the highest credit to the wine sommelier. The wine pairings were out of this world. I've never had so many delicious wines back-to-back that were all very unique and distinct in flavor. The entire party agreed, and we had to ask for extra bottle of wine beyond our pairings, because they were so good. The service was a beautifully choreographed dance of presenting and clearing that I enjoyed just sipping my wine quietly and watching our graceful servers float around the table. Thankfully for the rest of the guests, the wine-fueled noise level was enclosed in the private room, which was very intimate, but admittedly a bit of a hassle when visiting the single restroom inside the main dining room.\n\nWas it a once in a lifetime, memorable experience? Yes. Definitely. Would I pay that much to go back again? Nope. Not really. Save this place for a very special occasion with a large budget, and you won't be disappointed. But if you want to go above and beyond for less than $100 per person, please consider going elsewhere.

We Uber here so we were on time for our 5:45pm reservation. Friendly staff, hostess immediately offered to take our jackets and gave us two seating options, i chose the first table by the door, more space and a bit more secluded. And i can see the actions and when each plating is on its way =) I love the decor, warm colors and the lighting were soft (romantic) with music in the background. Semi open kitchen where you can stare at the chefs and be a creeper while you wait for the restroom sliding door to open. Nice roomy bathroom btw. The whole restaruant just 'feels' friendlier, many are spaced for 2 per table with a couple of 4 per table in the middle of the restaurant. I think there is a private room in the back as well. Since it was a Saturday, we were presented the 18 course of very artistic and tasty treats. What a great way to celebrate a bday. I believe it is $220 pp plus wine, we ordered few glasses so no pairing in particular. The first course of the white chocolate that burst immediately when you put it on the tongue (what a great way to start the 'show'). Everything looked so pretty and lots of ooh-ahh along the journey. The poem was a great touch, we didn't guess anything correct tho, of course! But i have to say, i was not 'full' at the end of the dinner(a three hour adventure for sure)...may or may not be a good thing as we had to rush to watch BBB at 9pm.

The meals are pretty and you want to take pictures of this food art. Unfortunately when the focus is so presentation heavy, flavors  take a back seat.  \n\nWe had the bigger of the two tastings ....  One course was outright terrible (an assault to your palate as one companion noted) and  the other courses had no particularly memorable flavors.\n\nIf you  ate the meal with your eyes closed you'd be hard pressed to describe anything notable about the meal (based on taste alone) to your friends at work the next day.  Someone would have to feed you otherwise you might eat all the things on your plate that are \"edible\" in that they won't harm you (sand & salt) but \"inedible\" in that you probably don't want to eat abalone covered in salty sand. \n\nFor  lovers of foie gras  we heard it would continue to appear on plates in the form of a chef's amuse (which is exactly what the Chicago chef's did when it became illegal to \"sell\"). \n\nWine service was sloppy and nothing about the wines extraordinary.  We ordered the pairing and sometimes two wines were bunched together and then long periods with no wine.   We were offered a wine choice at one point (during dessert/cheese) and these wines were added as extra glasses on the bill. The pours on these supplemental wines were not  full pours (probably not  half either) and the charges seemed to be full ($16/glass).\n\nService needed refinement.  The chef like to send out small square plates for each person with a food item on each plate and these were placed in the center of the table.  Sometimes these items were meant to be consumed as a single course and other times the plated items were meant to accompany the actual course (that came 5 minutes later). This redundant style occurred on multiple courses and it was never explained \"eat now\" or \"wait for the rest\"  so we were left to make jokes on our own and just guess (and we were usually wrong). As a group the service seemed stiff despite the pleasantness of the primary server.\n\nBottom line:  For essentially the same amount of money you can eat at Alinea (Chicago) and have a WAY better experience in terms of service, wine pairing, and food quality for molecular gastronomy", "author": "Lisa M J."}

But due to the Luce location, I felt she wasn't as recognized as she should be.  This should change all that.\n\nMy friend and I had the Prelude to a Winter Night http://www.ateliercrenn.com/menus/Winter-2011-Feb.pdf.  In fact, the website (which doesn't reproduce the menu clearly) and the font size of the menu were my only criticisms.  We couldn't read the menu clearly enough to see the prices.  That said, for this level food, the prices were reasonable.  And the descriptions didn't matter much, as the words didn't do justice to the tastes and presentation.  \n\nI can't comment on each course but they were spectacular.  Perfectly realized in almost every instance. The Truffle and Egg, for me, was perfection.  My friend said that she would be content eating the Foie Gras, and nothing but the Foie Gras, for the rest of her life.   The Walk in the Forest salad was spectacular and I usually eat salad as obligation instead of thrill.\n\nA couple of these reviews complained about portion size.  All I can say is, my friend and I were completely full, satisfied but not sick.  And the tastes will remain with me for a long time.

The other three in my party relayed the same sentiment after service was completed.\n\nWe were excited about eating great food and being brought on a culinary adventure. A friend in our group had been a fan of Dominique Crenn before this Marina based establishment so her enthusiasm warranted a great night of food and friends. Little did we know that we were in for an unforgettable experience on a different scale..... \n\nThe 4 major fails of our dinner at Atelier Crenn:\n1- TIMING: Dishes were not well paced. We observed others getting their courses a lot quicker and more consistently while we were twiddling our thumbs, watching them enjoy their meal. Dinner service lasted almost 5 hours for a party of 4.\n2 - ACCOMMODATION: A friend in our party had specific allergies so there were some dishes that were tailored specifically for her. This was fine until the dessert courses started to come out. The kitchen failed to give her an alternative of any kind.\n3 - SERVICE: When asking about why no alternatives were presented one staff member mentioned that the kitchen was closing and there was no other option. There was more attitude presented than dessert alternatives.\n4 - RESERVATIONS: At the end of service I asked to speak to Chef Dominique Crenn but unfortunately she was not working that evening so I asked for her contact info. I told the service staff that our experience was very upsetting and that it is un acceptable by any standards. Within an hour after we left our OpenTable dining reservations was cancelled after we had obviously paid and completed our reservation which prevented us from completing a review for the restaurant.\n\nOur expectations were shattered and in the end our friendly dinner outing turned into an upsetting and long-winded night. We have little to say about the food because the experience as a whole clouded our dining experience. No accountability was taken for any of the issues we encountered and our dining reservation magically \"disappeared\"\n\nChef Dominique Crenn has been contacted.

We chose the wine pairing with our meal. The food was wonderful, really really good. The presentation was beautiful. So for that I would give 5 stars. I'm rating 3 stars on service. We felt rushed the entire dinner. Even when we asked to slow down or set a bite aside we were told it needed to be eaten while it's warm. I kind of wanted to eat it when I wanted. Our requests to slow down were not heard and before we could taste all of one wine another was poured. This made us continually feel like we had to hurry and drink. Because this was a wine pairing I got confused which glass of wine went with what. At the end of our dinner and a 2nd dessert was served, I said, \"oh wow, more?\" I was told there were chocolates and she could box them up. I didn't ask her to box them up but allowed her to. When my husband asked for a regular glass of red wine, one that we had tasted she told us it was gone. Really? The red wine is gone?  Shortly thereafter the couple before us left and it was just my husband and I. The main server woman stood by the door and was looking at us. I guess it was time to leave. This was the most expensive dinner and wine pairing I've ever had. We paid $1100. And that amount of money I would certainly expect to feel wined and dined not rushed. Not even remotely rushed. It was $1100...\nThis was not a good experience and very disappointing.

Every course is truly a work of art, and should be savored and enjoyed with all of your senses. Don't expect super size me portions. This ain't a freakin' Vegas buffet.)\n\n2) Impeccable Service\n(In my opinion, this is where Atelier Crenn falls short. The service was not flawless by any means. A server clumsily tipped over an amuse bouche right off the bat, and a $50 miniscule dice of gelee escaped from the glass. Doh! Faux pas #1.)\n\n3) A Visit From The Chef\n(Yes, if I'm with a large party and we're spending a shitload of money that should be otherwise deposited into my piggy bank or donated to a cleft palate baby in Nicaragua instead, then hell yeah, the chef better come to our table and greet us. Chef Crenn did not disappoint.)\n\n4) An Overall Memorable Dining Experience\n(Despite multiple faux pas throughout the evening, this dining experience is still in my all time memorable top ten meals.)\n\n\nTHINGS YOU DON'T EXPECT FROM A FINE DINING EXPERIENCE:\n\n1) To find SEVERAL fish bones in your salmon\n(Really? REALLY?? I'm speechless. Faux pas #2.)\n\n2) To find the server continuously kicking your clutch beneath your chair\n(Seriously?!! I found myself having to retrieve my itty bitty purse from practically across the freakin' room on several occasions. What the phuck is someone's foot doing that far beneath my chair?!! How clumsy! Watch where you step! Faux pas #3.)\n\nSo kids, the lessons to be learned before you dine at Atelier Crenn are:\n\n1) Don't come with overly high expectations. Just enjoy each moment so you can fully indulge all of your senses.\n\n2) Don't come starving. Each course is meant to be enjoyed slowly, sloooowly. It ain't a freakin' hot dog eating contest!\n\n3) Don't even think about eating here if you're going to complain about the portion sizes or prices. It's called fine dining for a reason. It's definitely an investment in both time and money. Your return is a rich culinary experience that you can reminisce about when you're reclining your 80 year old ass in a La-Z-Boy chair, gumming your TV dinner in front of reruns of Welcome Back Kotter on TV Land.\n\n4) Ladies, leave your purse at home or securely locked in your car.

I'm surprised it's not completely overrun ... yet.\n\nThe conceit of poetry in the form of food is appropriate to chef Crenn's relatively modern and often Asian-inspired food.  Platings were artful, the dishes were skillfully prepared and delicious, and the experience was a cohesive one.  There is a tendency in making fancy food to use ingredients or fancy platings just because the look cool or are in vogue, without regard to whether they make sense.  The beautiful meal we received made sense, fit a theme, and above all tasted good.\n\nThey offered two menus the night we visited - the Chef's Classic Menu and the longer form \"Moments of Winter, An Introduction\".  We chose the latter, longer form dinner and shared a wine pairing.  They have a list of a dozen or so wines by the glass, from which the classic pairing seemed to be chosen, though it also included some things which were not quite wine.  The single wine pairing was definitely generous enough for two to share, all wines from France as far as I can recall, supplemented by a sort of cocktail at the beginning and another solid cocktail with the palate cleanser.\n\nThe menu was seafood-heavy with some amount of Asian influence.  Poached mussels, trout roe, kir in a thin chocolate shell, a single sweet shrimp, oyster, dungeness crab, razor clam, shaved foie gras, madai, mackrel, pigeon, an amazing pear, hibiscus leaf and sage dessert and one of the most gorgeous sets of mignardises we've seen in a long while.  All beautifully and complexly plated.  All flavors well exposed.\n\nService was formal without being stuffy at all and pacing was almost perfect.  Dishes were explained clearly, the kitchen was queried when we had ingredient questions, and the wines were explained well, if not particularly thoroughly.  \n\nChef Crenn appeared and stopped to chat with each table, unfortunately approaching ours just as I was engrossed in trying to take a picture of a particularly nice vegetable garden which was provided in place of the crab due to an allergy.  Sorry, chef.\n\nIf there were any missteps, it might have been a slight bitterness in one bite of the shaved foie course ( having tried to de-vein a lobe or two myself, this is not exactly unforgivable in a shaved course like this - nothing visible ), and it being somewhat unclear when and how the beautiful cheese cart might have come into play in our particular meal.  We were asked at one point if we might be ready to move on to dessert, and it was not quite clear what the other option would have been; I guess we could have asked.\n\nUnlike many over-the-top fine dining experiences we've had, we left the restaurant full but not overstuffed.  The individual dishes are small, and there are a lot of them, but somehow the portioning was perfect for us.\n\nI would not hesitate for a moment to return when the seasonal menu changes ... if I can get a reservation by then.", "author": "Albert H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-17", "description": "Artistic and poetic, the labels of \"atelier\" or \"poetic culinaria\" are fitting and not pretentious in this case.  Everything was so well thought out and beautifully designed.  I love the minimalist decor with the muted grayish blue walls.  The simple and elegant furniture.  \n\nThe menu, upon first glance, seems over the top cryptic.  Poetic? Yes. Informational? Not so much. But as the dishes arrive, I start to understand the practical reasons behind the vague names---surprise is actually an essential element to the whole dining experience. The best example---and now I am going backwards---is the last course, the dessert, which came out in a giant glass bowl with a beet perched on top.  A whole beet, with its leaf and root attached. Our first reaction was, of course, what the???  Small portions we liked, but to deprive us of our sinful, rich dessert? Coming from a French chef?  Fortunately, it turns out to be sherbet (still tasted authentically beet-y but in a good way), with chocolate \"root\", and lays in a bed of chocolate-y granola. The combination isn't just fun, it's tasty, and refreshing. \n\nThe dessert is exemplary of the other dishes, being both innovative and surprising, but at the same time, simply delicious with wonderful flavors and textures.  The amuse bouche, the kir breton, a chocolate ball that you take in one bite, with kir exploding in your mouth, is so much fun, and yet so sweet and tasty.  The \"sea\" course had all the right components of the kind of seafood I'd want to eat over and over again: uni, oyster, crispy salmon skin....At this point, I sigh and tell my husband that I wish seafood could be the last course, because it's often the high light of any tasting menus I've had.\n\nBut then, just then, they show up with this grains and seeds course that was so lovely and surprising that I changed my mind completely. Toasted quinoa, couscous, bulgur, seeds, some smoked, with a bit of dashi soup poured over, was simply amazing! Each bite is crunchy and nutty and smoky.  My husband wanted a bag of their salmon skins to snack on every day, well, I want a bag of this grains and seeds to munch on. I honestly wish I could recreate this at home---and obviously it doesn't need to be equally delicious or complex, but a simplified version would be dreamy!\n\nAnother highlight was the wine, which I probably shouldn't even mention, because I know nothing about wine. I don't drink it, I don't know the right adjectives, I don't know labels or years. I just asked the sommelier for something sweet and light, and he brought me something that wasn't on the menu (at which point I fear I would be imbibing $$$$ liquid while unable to tell the difference between good wine and vinegar).  I ended up extremely happy with the taste.  Wood and butter? earth and crispy? No, I would describe it as delicious. I tasted no acidity whatsoever. And to my relief, it was only $16.\n\nWe walked away with nothing to nitpick on, which says a lot, because the first thing you do when you spend an enormous amount of money on food is to mentally calculate how many decent meals you could have gotten out of that much money instead. But the night was impeccable.  I  felt perfectly happy with the portion size.  And compared to my ultimate indulgence, Benu, this was as innovative and interesting, but not as expensive.  Atelier Crenn definitely provided an ideal special occasion experience.", "author": "Candice B."}

The quality, presentation, and creativity of each dish on its tasting menu is sheer brilliance from Chef Crenn.  However, it is the little things that keep the restaurant from the top tier.\n\nChef Crenn herself was very friendly, taking time to greet us during the busy dinner hours, but unfortunately the rest of the service was subpar.  First, the timing was very poor, with us waiting a long time between dishes.  One would think that the timing would be meticulously planned out for an expensive tasting menu, but the staff consistently appeared disorganized and not ready for the next course.  Second, the water service was laughably inept.  My water glass was more often empty than filled to any level.  At one point, they carelessly filled my previously sparkling glass with still water - then back to sparkling after a couple glasses.  On top of that, a fly buzzed around our table throughout the dinner.\n\nI really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but the little things really kept me from fully enjoying the meal.

He may have been stretched thin as the restaurant was full, but he answered all our questions tersely and without a shred of enthusiasm. We managed to get him to crack a smile towards the 8th course, but I'm not sure why he made us feel like we needed to impress him before he would give us any warmth. \n\nUnfortunately, this sommelier experience primed us for other service interactions. While we otherwise would have overlooked slow service, we were very cognizant of the fact that we had to ask 3 times for the bill at the end of the night. When a restaurant charges nearly $1,000 for a table, you'd think they'd be a little more eager to get their money! Lastly, we asked for the waitress to call a cab for us at the end of the night. She kindly did so, but when it arrived, she barked, \"it's here\" with a glare on her face! \n\nDominique was lovely, however, and we greatly appreciated her coming to talk to our table. She is truly an artist with food, but I would not revisit this place unless I heard they had undergone a serious service change. \n\n(This review excludes Joel because he was fantastic!

The service was great. The wine selections were great. That's what the two stars are for. The food I give no stars, as I hardly saw any. We had chosen the smaller of the two meal choices, but added cheese plates and wine pairings. We joked a few times during the meal about getting some real food afterwards, and I think the only reason we did not was that it was 1am by the time we got out.

It is not often a new restaurant makes it in, but both of us agreed, we put Atelier Crenn at the top.\n\nOf course, a restaurant needs to have both good ambiance and food to make it a memorable experience. Atelier Crenn had both. From the moment we walked in, to the final good-bye, we couldn't stop smiling. The service was professional yet warm. Chef Crenn even visited the dining room twice while we were there, stopping at every table and engaging her guests in conversation, mostly about the food.\n\nEach course is a work of art.

The five course or ten course dinner. We went for the full experience - and I'm glad we did. I would have been jealous watching the patrons at the next table having all the fun.

Really. \n\nI've been to enough Michelin star restaurants to know when a place is doing it right and when they are so off base that you question why they even earned a damn star. Yes, the tree with the fancy little deserts and quince tea was charming, however it was a dollar short and a day late. \n\nThe problems started when we walked in. \n\nOur table wasn't ready, it was simply overbooked. We were escorted to the bar next door where we continued to wait, for nearly an hour. Had it not been pouring rain we might've left at that point despite the bottle of wine the restaurant bought us to help tide us over. \n\nWhen we were seated we were left alone for waaaaay too long given how long we waited for a table. Cups arrived water didn't follow very close behind.\n\nHalf the table drank still, the other half sparkling. Who drank what was confused not once, but at least three times. There are little devices, color of coaster, bottle shape, size, that help wait staff remember who is drinking what, \n\nThe overall service was shoddy, poorly paced and after the hour wait we had I would expect a bit more. Here's the thing: when you shell out that much money for a meal it's more than just food, it's a dining experience. From the way the dishes are brought out in unison so everyone gets the plate at the same time, to the actual plates they are served on and the aromas that come trailing from the kitchen. The idea is to engage all of your senses. With the service falling so far behind what I would expect of a restaurant this lauded I would hope the food would make up the difference. Sadly our dinner from start to finish, with the exception of the deserts was completely forgettable. Really. \n\nYou might say that with many small courses on a tasting menu you can't be expected to remember how each one was or what you had and I say rubbish. If you love the food and it makes an impression, if it enriches your dinning experience you will remember it, and there was nothing terribly memorable about any of it.", "author": "Len S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-01", "description": "Our dinner exceeded our expectations. I had been a little leery of what appeared to be such preciousness (the menu's listing of the $160 tasting is merely a poem entitled \"Introduction to Winter\"!)  Highlights:\n\nPalate cleanser #1 - White chocolate \"egg\" with a fantastic burst of Kir breton inside.  The chocolate shell was paper thin and crackly brittle.  \n\nFoie gras flash chilled and shaved, shaped like a curl of bark, along with vanilla, cocoa nibs, apple bits, balsamic gelee little cubes, rice cracker. This was absolutely wonderful, and a true signal that the pleasure would ratchet up exponentially from here on out.  The lovely foie melted with each bite of sweet vanilla and cocoa, tart apple, and crispy cracker....\n\nRazor clam with carrot foam, squid ink, seaweed, smoked paprika \"soil\", and smoked sturgeon pearls. This was our favorite item ... to this point.  The sweetish foam on the sweet clam, and the smokiness of the entire dish - astounding.\n\nMadai (japanese snapper) with fried sage, alliums, kumquat shells, cilantro puree, edible flowers, browned butter, and fried capers.  This topped the razor clam.  The apparently freeze dried and powdered browned butter \"snow\" melted with the perfectly grilled snapper, the alliums contrasted with the kumquat...this dish was earthy and substantial, and yet still light.\n\nPigeon ume, with \"ash\" of coffee, puree of black garlic, and other delicious things I can no longer read in my notes. The squab held its own heart (or liver - both were definitely on the plate) in its claw - completely dramatic presentation amongst the 10 or more preceding gorgeous presentations (reminded us of Grayson's dish on TC during the Snow White challenge).  I was blown away by the delicious, ruby rare flesh, and the attendant deeply warm flavors of the ume and coffee.\n\nNext came the best dessert I've had in my entire life:  a pear sorbet in the shape of a pear and \"spray painted\" with pear, apple, and quince, to look like a frosted, golden and rosy pear that had fallen from its wintry tree onto the forest floor below. The forest floor was made of more of the powdery, nutty browned butter, maple, sage cake, apple granita and greek yogurt snow - so with each bite you got cold and crunch of snow and a little munch like mud and leaves (I cannot remember what they were, but in my pics they look pretty leaf-like) and the only thing that was inedible was the stem on the pear, which was actually a piece of vanilla, and which I discovered I had inhaled when my plate was empty.  This was an unbelievably thought provoking dish.  And I don't even care about pears.\n\nThen a split log was brought out covered in mignardises:  passion fruit marshmallows, madeleines, rice crispy covered chocolate and passionfruit, ginger something, key lime something else, mango something, gold leaf covered bitter chocolate sheets, and a salted caramel that made us both actually moan out loud.  (Well, there was a lot of that throughout the meal but this was particularly guttural and we both did it at completely different times.)  Our serer told us the pastry chef had tried 15 different ways to make that cellophane wrapped sweet until he hit upon that one. \n\nService was excellent and warm, extremely tolerant of our picture taking and endless requests for repetition of ingredients.  The sommelier took care of me, adhering to my budget conscious request of half glasses.  The only tiny complaint we had was that we were not told, as we almost always are, that we would be charged for the sparkling water.  A small quibble of $10 - I was too happy to bring it up.\n\nThis was, by far, the best meal I've ever had.  Better than Masa, better than Danko, even better than Coi.  We left satiated but not stuffed.  Chef Crenn, as others have mentioned, came out several times to ask how we were faring, inquiring how we liked a particular dish, discussing ingredients, techniques.  She was warm and engaging, and affirmed that she was indeed cooking from her heart.  It's not a trite declaration, coming from her.  The food was for me a perfect mixture of intellect, wonder and rusticity.  \n\nIf I could afford it, I would love to come back to see what flights of thoughtful fancy Ms. Crenn will conjure up each season.

If there is one high end place you can go to a year, this should be it. They can accommodate vegetarians, allergies and the dishes they made are as good if not better than the meat selections.\n\nWe had the winter tasting menu which you can find details of in other reviews. We had two amuse bouches, 2 palate cleaners, 8 savory courses, 2 bread courses, one dessert palate cleaners, 2 desserts including one that had an assortment of more than a dozen truffles, gelees, caramels, chocolates, cookies and other goodies, a cheese course of 5 cheeses that was an additional cost and one super awesome drink that was infused at our table.\n\nThe dishes are small and perfect. Every dish was an artwork but the best thing was they all tasted amazing. The fish had the best skin on it, the razor clam was divine. It was kinds mindblowing how there were so many flavours in such tiny dishes. Also loved how there was flower petal in every dish.\n\nThe service was also some of the best I've experienced in SF, I often find servers here to not have some basic formal dining training but the servers here had both the training but a very friendly and engaging manner. They were very knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nI love seeing a chef in her kitchen and she came out three times to check on us. I also love how quiet and small the place is and how not overdesigned the decor is. The atmosphere was timeless while the food is cutting edge without being pretentious.\n\nIf you just want a steak or don't like to have multi-course dishes that are complex and unlike much of what you have eaten don't come here. If you do not like modernist food or taking your time to eat, do not come here. If you think that spending 160 a person for food is too much, do not come here. If you judge how good food is by the size of the plate, do not come here. really you wouldn't enjoy it at all.\n\nWe got there 15 minutes early and found street parking in 5 minutes but we have a small car and good parking karma, if you are driving give yourself time or get the insanely expensive valet a block away.\n\nIt was indeed worth every penny.

This is probably the most complicated review I have written yet, and I so wanted to spin this positively- but the overall miss was bigger than the various small hits during the dinner,  and when you compete in the 'big ticket' restaurant arena ($100+/person), you need to hit home-runs. \n\nThere were some amazing elements to the meal, and everything we were presented with tasted good or better, however the 'journey' was so over blown- that it kept going and when it finally ended- I was shocked that I was still quite hungry. I think we spent $200 per person for a tasting menu and wine, and left feeling like we forgot to eat dinner.  When we walked out, I joked that I was ready to wash my meal down with a slice from Pizza Orgasmica (next door).  I didn't get one- but as I laid in bed hungry an hour later- I really wished that I had.\n\nI've done tasting menus in this price range and higher at high-end restaurants in San Francisco and other US cities, as well as in Japan and France.  I get the fact that I wasn't supposed to be 'gorging' on any one item.  But at the end of the night, I felt as if I had been tricked. Rather than eating dinner, I merely 'tasted' it.  I felt as if I had witnessed a beautiful artistic display for 3+ hours, but missed the main event.  Like going to the Louvre and not seeing the Mona Lisa, or something to that extent.\n\nPrepare yourself if you choose to visit this restaurant for a 2.5-3.5 hour experience, depending on whether you go with the 4 course prix fixe ($75ea) or the tasting menu ($125ea).  We went with the tasting menu and so it began....\n\nWe started with a little corn puree soup.  Very flavorful.  3 spoonfuls.  An apple cider-filled white chocolate sphere soon followed.  A bit weird, 1 bite, but interesting.  A 1 bite oyster soon followed.  A 2 bite beef item- sort of a carpaccio-ish dish with pseudo-Japanese flair.  Pretty.  But 2 bites.  3 bites of foie gras, an excellent mushroom dish, 2 bites of game hen, 2 bites of salmon, and then 4 bites of dessert.  Maybe there was something somewhere in the middle which I have forgotten- but the problem was that it was forgettable...And then we were done....\n\nEach item is displayed in an amazingly beautiful presentation- there is no denying this, and the theme throughout is 'nature'.  Rocks, leaves, branches, and other natural 'props' provide a setting and backdrop throughout the restaurant and throughout each plate.  There is a certain pageantry which shows with each dish- lots of drips and drops and stylistically sculpted bits of food surround your plate.  Each nibble is interesting, tasty, and fun to talk about-  but there is almost too much attention and too much complexity applied to these factors.  You can only look at your food for so long, and after consuming it rather rapidly (the average plate took us 3 min or less to finish), I kept wanting whatever was next to show up asap- and memories of the previous dish faded rather quickly.  There was nothing that really grabbed me from the food standpoint and asked me to return.  The positive memory here is not of a 'blockbuster' dish or food item- instead it is of a creative journey and the art, and this is what you must understand and be prepared to appreciate more than the food itself.  Some may appreciate the visual experience over the culinary experience, and while I appreciate both- the look cannot take precedence over my satisfaction with the food.\n\nMy two favorites were the mushroom plate, and the game hen.  If I re-orchestrated my menu- I would have gone prix-fixe and incorporated these two dishes (and prayed they were larger than those on the tasting menu), and figured out 2 other dishes from there (prix-fixe is 4 courses).\n\nService was excellent- we were well-attended to, plates arrived in a synchronized manner, dietary needs and allergies were accommodated (although one error was made but rectified quickly) and wine recommendations were excellent.  The wine (we went by the bottle rather than by pairings) was actually reasonably priced by my standards and compared to what I was expecting.  Chef Crenn greeted us and it was refreshing to see the name-sake of the restaurant live and orchestrating the kitchen.\n\nIn summary- Atelier Crenn is competing in the price/experience space that is currently occupied by such restaurants as La Folie, Gary Danko, Meadowwood (Napa), Dining Room at the RItz Carlton, and Acquerello (all of which I have tried multiple times) and others such as French Laundry or Coi (which I have not visited).  Speaking for those restaurants which I have visited (all 4.5 star or better experiences for me), I would definitely return to those venues or try something new before returning to Atelier Crenn.  Again, our experience was interesting and unique and enjoyable to some degree.  But at the end of the $200 / person meal, I shouldn't leave thinking about a $4 slice of pizza", "author": "Andy S."}

Dominque Crenn took down Michael Symon on Iron Chef and it is easy to see why. She and her team's ability to transform perfect ingredients into edible art is the best we have had and rate it right up there with TFL and Danko. The Grand Tasting menu featured sea urchin, oyster, tai snapper, abalone, foie gras and waygu beef whimsically presented over a 3 hour plus palate pleasing journey. The dessert of shades of gray is truly food theater and its dramatic presentation is equaled by the unique flavors. The food is complemented by terrific, attentive service and a chic interior that make this one of the top dining destinations in all of Northern California.", "author": "Trevor F."}

Let's just say.. my stomach was definitely not satisfied afterwards. \n\nThe tasting menu is 9 courses, two of which are dessert courses.\nThe first few courses are so small that me and my boyfriend couldn't tell whether they were complimentary hors d'oeuvres or courses. The courses range from jello like substances and a celery sherbert like thing (to cleanse your palette) to beef tartare and cold foie gras. Really high caliber food (obviously), but almost too interesting. \n\nThe desserts were phenomenal. The ice cream was brought to us attached to a eucalyptus twig and the olive oil ice cream was served on a log. IT WAS SO COOL. \n\nProps to the chef for being so adventurous with her dishes. Everything was beautifully displayed and it is obvious that thorough thought and creativity were put into each one. However, I don't feel like she balanced the entree courses evenly with the dessert courses. I truly ate 1.5 times as much dessert as food. Don't get me wrong.. everything tasted good in its own way; there just simply wasn't enough food. \n\nOverall, I was very impressed by each course. I just wish I hadn't left hungry!", "author": "Allie E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-26", "description": "Full review in the blog - save for one dish and a couple small service gaffs a 5-star experience from an extremely talented chef and pastry chef.  High points below:\n\nI love food, I love the arts, and given my choice I prefer the more freely flowing and less constrained versions of each - it is probably why artists like Dali, chefs like Gagnaire, and bands like Mars Volta all rank highly on my favorites and also why I tend to find tweezered and \"precious\" food more appealing than a pile of meat and potatoes on a plate.  Further taking into my account my fascination vegetables of all sorts and particularly with unique produce prepared in remarkable ways the decision to visit Atelier Crenn seemed obvious yet some detractors gave me pause...\n\nLed quickly to my seat, a nice two top with a direct view of both the kitchen, the center service island, and the majority of the room my comfort was assured, my water preference confirmed (still over sparkling,) and within moments I was presented the wine list and the seasonal menu to peruse - a menu that even to the experienced diner requires a bit of explanation as the right consists of a prix fixe while the left is comprised of a poem and a list of ingredients included in the dishes eluded to in the lines above; \" Sitting on the coast, the waves roll in.  A new salinity brings hints of afar. A place of riches, Of towering trees. Stop, Pause.  Scales glisten in the distance, like a rare Asian gem.  My mind is at peace, the waves recede.\"\n\nFor the first of two amuses bouche Chef Crenn would arrive tableside to describe the course as \"Corn Pudding with fried crispy quinoa, freeze dried corn, consomm\u00e9 of corn and coconut\" and while nearly everything that followed this was good to great, this was perhaps my second favorite course of the evening.   Beginning first with the corn pudding - think creamed corn in flavor yet with a nearly panna cotta mouth-feel and the lingering sweetness of coconut - the dish was subsequently topped with a warm crystal clear consomm\u00e9 dotted with puffed quinoa and crispy corn - a sweet/savory balance whose texture punctuated the smoothness of the pudding.  Showing right away that this was a meal that would walk a careful line in balancing flavors, textures, and temperatures this amuse was wonderful.\n\nHaving omitted the beef and caviar dish that my neighbors received next, my substituted selection would be \"New Potato 'Memoire d'enfance'\" featuring potatoes roasted, cut, and seared served with Potato puree, peas, mint, compte crisps, and a liberal grating of salt.  Showing off the lateral presenting style that would dominate the majority of Dominique's plated landscapes this beautiful dish began with the potatoes - five rounded confitted fingerlings with a crunchy exterior giving way to a center harkening tater tots - and sprawled across the plate with peas both solo and in the pod, raw and cooked, plus the aforementioned mint, crunchy cheese (think cheeze-it made of compte) and light crystals of salt flaked from the block.  Restrained and beautiful this was precisely the sort of vegetable presentation I love and expected when I made my reservation.\n\n\"Foie Gras Log\" was described as frozen and shaved with poached pears, fresh pears, roasted pear puree, vanilla pudding, and thai basil gel infused with cocoa nibs this marvelously textured liver literally melted in the mouth - so much so that I actually requested some bread crisps to go with the sous vided, frozen, and shaved preparation - while the accoutrements walked a tightrope between sweet and savory, neither overwhelming the other and both acting to highlight the subtleties of the foie.\n\nMy favorite dish of the evening was called \"A walk in the Forest\" and despite its beautiful presentation the visual was entirely upstaged by its aroma, a mossy bloom kindling memories of my childhood.  Moving past the intoxicating smell, what arrived on the plate before me was again a visual and textural terrain inhabited by no less than four types of mushrooms (hon shimeji, lobster, chantrelles, and king trumpet) prepared in no less than four manners (raw, dried, pickled, and pan seared) resting atop toasted Douglas Fir meringue \"soil\" along with hazelnuts and chickpeas plus a variety of herbs and what tasted distinctly like notes of morel.   Entirely focused on creating an experience reminiscent of the dish's title while encouraging diners to take a step off the path to explore the varying combinations I'd encourage anyone still hesitating to visit Atelier to make a reservation based on this dish alone.\n\nIn the end I had a fantastic evening overall and of my many fortunate dining experiences over the last several years it is hard to think of any single place where food art and science met so closely with nature; \"Alinea meets L'Arpege\" was the comparison I made and while neither the food nor the service were on par with either those are some pretty lofty standards for a restaurant merely one year old.", "author": "Michael U."}

I can't think of a single other tasting menu that I have done that I have literally eaten EVERY bite of everything served to me. Not only was each course presented beautifully and oh-so-creative, but it actually TASTED amazing as well (which unfortunately isn't always the case...)\n\nI found myself jealous of the table next to us who was a few courses behind us. My favorite bite of the entire night was the \"setting of the purple sun\" line of the Fall poem. It was essentially a palate cleanser of some sort of almond milk / grape juice frozen creamy concoction. I also loved the squid ribbons and the amazing \"sea\" dessert. \n\nThe server Justin was fabulous, and he put us right at ease. Chef Crenn came out and greeted every table, and when she got to our table, chatted with us and even said, \"I just want to confirm--you need your waygu beef course medium-well, correct?\" I was so impressed! \n\nWould definitely recommend Atelier Crenn for those celebrating something special.", "author": "K.

We left the car with the valet stand in front of Balboa which services this restaurant as well.  Did the 4 course menu instead of the 12 course tasting menu (simply bc we started at 9 and didn't want to eat until midnight), and sadly the best thing about the meal were the three bottles of wine we ordered.  I love molecular gastronomy as much as the next guy, but this was not up to par.  The initial salad was nothing special, the foie gras was trying too hard to be cute and ended up failing, and the main course -- \"the sea\"-- was unexpected in a BAD way.  It was literally two tiny pieces of (delish) salmon, two pieces of pickled mussels (bleh), one piece of uni (delish), and a few little other tiny offerings.  I left hungry.  For $200/person, I left hungry!!\n\nThen the worst part of the night -- upon leaving around 11:15, we see the valet is gone.  The guy and his stand from in front of Balboa were just gone.  The bouncers had no idea where he went.  Our keys were nowhere to be found.

The wagyu tartare, frozen foie gras, and sous vide guinea hen were the highlights of the dinner for me. And the wine pairings were really incredible - way more creative than the standard combinations you'll find a lot of places. And very generous pours! And the mignardises at the end of the meal, which are often just an afterthought, were incredible here. First time I've ate all of them at a restaurant!\n\nOnly a few minor issues with the meal. I thought the gelee amuse was sorta whatever, the oyster was v tasty but it was hard to get all of the tastes together - I would have liked a big spoon to scoop it all up, and the wine paired with the trout was overwhelmed by the strong flavors in the fish dish.\n\nBut those are just nitpicks in an outstanding meal in a very elegant, but also casual and comfortable environment, with great staff and service. Very expensive ($300 each for tasting + wine pairing + extra glass of champagne + cheese + coffee), but I got someone else to pay for it, so that was pretty awesome. People have written about not being full after this meal, so I was preparing to need a post-meal Tommy's Joynt sandwich on the way home, but that complaint seems absurd.

We have eaten at Michelin starred restaurants across the world and our meal was so stunningly disappointing, that I feel like I have to say something. \n\nBefore you read further however, you need to know that when it was clear to the staff that we did not like our meal, (I did not eat two of the courses, and my husband also did not eat the last course we were served),  the staff comped our entire meal.  We spent three hours there--ordered the tasting menu and the wine pairing-- it would have been 330.00 per person for all of this food and wine.  We argued to both pay for our meal and leave a tip and were told several times that they would not accept it.  \n\nThe meal started out okay- the wine pairings were solid.  The highlight was a raw fish course with a lovely French wine.  Everything else for the first four courses was not very memorable.  As others have noted, the courses are small--even compared to the French Laundry.  At one point my husband embarrassingly asked for bread; he was that hungry.  They said they would bring some, but never did.  \n\nIt went quite downhill from there.  We knew something was wrong when a sherry was poured for our wine pairing for the fifth or six dish.  It was with a version of a French onion soup.  The interpretation of the soup was okay, but not unlike what we could get at a cafe on Polk Street.  The next course was \"cereal for grown-ups.\"  I am not kidding about this-- we got quinoa and grains in a dashi broth.  It was served with a beer.  It was very disappointing.  \n\nThen a plate of mushrooms came--served with a good Pinot.  But the Pinot was too small for the mushrooms, and I have never, ever, just had mushrooms served as a dish.  \n\nThen, after the mushrooms, we had a very unbelievable dish-- chocolate with a duck pate, duck fat and a duck consomme on the side.  It was supposed to be reminiscent of a birds nest, and it did taste a bit like that, although I can't say for sure because I only had one bite.  \n\nOur last course, because we could not literally stomach anymore food, was a sous-vide squab.  Squab is hard to make tasty, but we have had decent squab in Europe.  This squab made me feel sick to my stomach after one bite.  My husband, who has a stronger stomach than I, just said, \"This is disgusting.\"  It seemed under cooked, but yet tough at the same time.  \n\nWe left before the next courses.  Our main complaint was that there was little protein.  For me, I have been a vegetarian off and on for most of my life.  I love tasting menus that highlight vegetables.  I could not have been more disappointed.  Vegetables that are in season right now were not even provided.  Maybe we had an off night, but I can tell you that we have eaten in places with one Michelin star and have had way better food, for a fraction of the price (than we would have paid.)\n\nMaybe it was just an off night.  But I can't help but comment on how the San Francisco food scene is so driven by reviews.  By comping our food, I could not help but feel that we were being silenced, like we should not complain.  Of course, they did not say anything to dissuade us from publicly complaining. But since we did not pay anything, I feel like a jerk for telling our story.   \n\nMaybe I am a jerk, but for the price, I can tell you there are a lot better places to spend your money in San Francisco. Also, for reasons we don't understand, the restaurant cancelled our reservations for the evening we dined through Open Table.

It is the chef's signature menu and requires a commitment of about 3 to 4 hours at the table. We booked for 8pm and left the restaurant past midnight. The dishes were very original for the greater part and we discovered interesting things and tastes. The sizes were good and we did not feel filled nor hungry: just right!\n\nService was good with a reasonable pace which did not make us feel rushed. \n\nThe wine list is pretty poor and having looked at it ahead of time, we chose to bring our own bottle and pay the $30 corkage fee. Still water that did not seem to be coming from mineral bottles was charged $2 per person. Won't get us broke but feels a little \"cheap\" to be charged $2 when you look at the price of the tasting menu per person ($160 per person).\n\nOn the downside, the tables are really too close to each other and you could help but hear the conversations around you.

The duck \"eggs\" (duck fat and egg) was really interesting with the corn silk nest, which was really salty. The dessert with the toasted cashew ice cream on a grill was great as well.\n\nYou don't need a special occasion for an excuse to come here!", "author": "Pamela L."}

Yes, that's a door-to-door trip to Seattle or Denver. Because our group numbered six, and because we went through four bottles (but not a fifth!) in total, the speed of dinner certainly was impacted. \n\nRegardless, the combinations of ingredients, in design and preparation, had us looking forward to every successive course. My expectations were exceeded by the conception, execution and presentation of the dishes.  Since I knew the bill would be $200/person, you can imagine how high my expectations were.\n\nI saw only a few options are listed:  two tasting menus, chef's or vegetarian, plus a four-course prix fixe menu. We chose the chef's menu and opted for bottles of white and red instead of the wine pairings. Everyone at the table is required to order the same menu. FWIW, I was incredibly impressed by the focused wine list that was ready for ~12 courses including 40+ ingredients in combinations we hadn't seen elsewhere.\n\nNo need for me to discuss individual dishes, given recent reviews and an upcoming menu change as of Nov. 1. Of course I know of no reason why that would deter anyone from making a reservation.  My only advice would be to limit your party to 4 people or fewer.", "author": "Mike H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-24", "description": "I knew I was going to a birthday dinner at a mystery location, and I was secretly hoping it would be Atelier Crenn.  Best birthday dinner ever.\n\nThe place is very low key for a 2-star place but still elegant.  It's very unassuming from the outside, and parking can be hit or miss (we got a spot right out front, but they do have valet).  It's not huge, but tables are well spaced, and there is a private room in the back; there's also a nice view into the kitchen (the \"workshop\").\n\nWe went with the chef's tasting with wine pairings, which was the best meal I've had in years.  The extra glasses of champagne before dinner helped to get my appetite going :)  When you look at the menu, you'll notice it's very poetic and essentially undecipherable.. we spent much of the dinner trying to guess what the next course was going to be..\n\n1. Autumn has come with its cool breeze: a cocoa butter sphere (like a Lindt chocolate) filled with cool apple cider, topped with creme de cassis. I loved the apple for fall, and the delicate bite really does burst in your mouth.\n2. Mellow serenades of colors licorice and orange: Sea urchin topped with caviar and yuzu bubbles - the creamy uni was offset by the light yuzu, and the caviar was nice and savory. The accompanying dish was an oyster, and instead of a mignonette, it was more like a broth\n3. Where the broad ocean leans against the spanish land: Threads of fresh squid (like noodles) wrapped in lardo with the most amazing mushroom broth\n4. A gentle smell, oceanic, of yummy feeling: Shima aji (like mackarel) with a fried turnip, initially paired with sake, but we switched it out for a riesling, which was perfect. The fish was fresh, and the cucumber and other dots on the plate (can't remember what they were made of) went well with the fish without masking its flavor.\n5. Sitting on top of the dune, feeling the beach sand under my toes: this dish had EVERYTHING in it - Manila clam, razor clam, mussel, sweetbread, bone marrow dumping, phytoplankton gelee, braised pork belly, and a tomato water foam. All those little bites went surprisingly well together, and it was like a bowl of mysterious treasures. I don't even usually like sweetbreads, but my favorites were that and the dumpling\n6. The half moon, silky and smoky: chevre cheese dumpling topped with tomato gelee, then poured over it was a fragrant, sweet onion broth, clearer than any other french onion soup I've had. It also came with a home made brioche on the side.  BEST \"french onion soup\" ever.\n7. Woody and stone: candied carrots prepared in an alkaline solution, toasted, and dehydrated - like \"vegetable jerky.\"\n8. Added bite: it looked like a black whiskey rock on a stone - it was made of cocoa butter and vegetable ash (so creative!), similar to the first bite, filled with liquid and paired with fennel. It was VERY delicate, and mine burst when I picked it up, and they were so nice to bring another!\n9. Nature rejoice, chasing childhood memories: like cereal! It was a bowl of toasted grains with toasted, smoked, and fried seeds. It was topped with a dashi broth, but these smoked sturgeon pearls made the broth so rich and amazing, and there was a little yuzu paste to offset the creaminess\n10. Wrapped in a yellow blanket: A5 wagyu tartare, fermented brocolli, wrapped in an egg yolk blanket. This was pretty awesome, but I wish it had something with a kick (like mustard ice cream maybe..)\n11. Walking deep in the woods, as the snow might have been something to spare: a forest of various mushrooms, pine meringue, shaved hazelnut. I adore mushrooms, and this dish was light but hearty.\n12. Birth which gives its morning mystery: duck fat and corn on duck liver mousse with apple and pear foliage, chocolate bark, and a cup of duck consomme. I could have had multiple cups of the consomme, and though it sounds weird, the chocolate bark was amazing with the duck. \n13. Where birds sing and are causing ripples in the nearby water: squab with pomegranate, mustard seeds, and squash - cooked medium rare, not gamey at all, loved the pomegranate + mustard seeds\n14. Extra bite: a \"salad\"\n15. Yet another extra: test tubes of guava and chia seeds, like a very light juice but not too sweet\n16. Dotting the fragrant flora: eucalyptus and menthol ice cream on a menthol leaf, very refreshing and minty\n17. Autumn has come and full of sweet surprises: honey comb sorbet, honey meringue, honey caramel cake, and pear - I love that honey isn't super sweet, and there was a great variety of dessert bites\n18. Final bites: honey caramels, honey comb, meringue, marshmallow\n\nDespite that there were so many courses (and so many wine pairings!), I was very happily fed but not uncomfortably full. The pacing, portion sizes, variety, and everything just go perfectly, and service was impeccable. The two stars are well deserved, and this was the best way I could imagine kicking off my 30th birthday celebrations.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

I would hate to ruin the surprises, so I will save those for in person experiences, but suffice to say that this place takes fine dining presentation to a new level, all the while weaving in their theme of a meal that tells a \"story.\"\n\nThe only complaint I would have, and it is a minor one, is that for me personally, I prefer the rapid-fire approach some restaurants employ where they bombard you with a succession of course after course.  Here, if you're hungry, it may take a while before your appetite is satisfied, as you are presented with a litany of courses that, while incredibly delicious, are diminutive in size, amounting to nothing more than one or two bites per dish.  Still, I would hate for this to come off as if it's a major issue, because it really is not, this place is truly top notch.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys fine dining (and is alright with the high price that this place carries) that wants to venture out and try a different approach based on a conceptual meal.

On par with French Laundry and Alinea.  Not only were the platters/containers unique and theme fitting, but the food presentation itself contributed to the whole montage. (5 stars)\n- The food quality was pretty good.  The majority of dishes were very good, others were okay and some just had too many, non-complementary tastes going on.  (4 stars)\n- Wine Pairing.  The wine pairing was decent on some courses and downright outstanding on a couple courses.  (4 stars)\n\nCons:\n- The decor was very plain.  Not quite as plain as Coi, but nothing really going on.  The ambiance felt a little crowded, with no opportunity for intimacy. (1 star)\n- The service was attentive but not particularly polite or helpful.  It would have been considered good at a regular restaurant but disappointing for the price and prestige associated with two Michelin stars. (2 stars)\n- The physical menu was completely unhelpful.  It's written as bad poetry so there's no way to know which tasting menu to choose.  I like the attempt at uniqueness but I'd rather have an idea of what my choices are if being given a choice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-27", "description": "I think I have a new \"favorite restaurant\" in San Francisco.\n\nMany people may remember Dominque Crenn from 'Iron Chef America,\" where she beat Iron Chef Michael Symon; was on Season Two of \"The Next Iron Chef\" (Michael Symon was the winner on Season One); and has earned Michelin 1 Star ratings for her food at Luce Restaurant at the Inter-Continental Hotel in San Francisco two years in a row. Now she has opened up her own restaurant, Atelier Crenn, in the space on Fillmore formerly held by Plumpjack.\n\nLynn and I had 8:00 reservations (Saturday, 3/26/2011), and were promptly seated. Plumpjack never had space to wait for your table, and neither does Atellier Crenn, but they have redone the room to make it casually elegant, warm and inviting -- the decor may be considered \"spartan\" by some, but I felt immediately comfortable and at home.\n\nNow I should point out that my wife Lynn has been going out to dinner with the same group of women since law school 30 years ago. She had already been to Atelier Crenn, and before leaving that night, she made reservations to take me here. The menu changes seasonally, and some of the dishes had indeed changed since Lynn was there ... nonetheless, I got a fair dose of \"What did I tell you?\" and \"Isn't that fantastic? I *knew* you'd like it!\" She was right.\n\nChef Crenn calls her food \"Poetic Culinaria,\" and the meal was indeed poetic. I'd be hard pressed to come up with a better word to describe her cuisine. I mean, \"excellent\" certainly fits, but it's not nearly as evocative of her food as \"poetic.\"\n\nWe opted for the tasting menu, but without the wine pairing. The current tasting menu is entitled \"Prelude to Spring Night,\" and is a perfect name for the meal to come. (Please be aware that I took no notes wile we dined, and am writing this from memory 24 hours later. If some of the dishes are not described exactly right, the fault is mine.)\n\nThe amuse bouche arrived - foie gras with apple, a goat cheese with celery root, and a crostini with chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9. Now, I have to quickly add that these descriptions do not even come remotely close to actually describing these delicious spoonfuls of delight. Atelier Crenn uses no plates - not in the traditional sense of the word. Slate slabs of various shapes and sizes, burls made from olive wood, glass bowls, and bonsai trees.\n\nWe began with a \"Kir Breton.\" Now Kir is a popular Parisian drink made (traditionally) from Creme de Casis and Bourgogne Aligot\u00e9; Kir Royal substitutes the white wine for sparkling wine. Normally, Kir Breton substitutes hard apple cider.  So, na\u00efvely, I was expecting a small \"cocktail\" as a starter. But no -- here came my first surprise of the evening! Placed in front of us is a perfect sphere the size of the perfect chocolate truffle. Made of cocoa butter and chocolate, topped with a dollop of black currant jam. I popped the ball in my mouth and pressed upward with my tongue. The sphere burst and its liquid center of a true Kir Breton flooded my taste buds and senses ... rarely does one bite strike such pure perfection, but this may be the most memorable single bite of my life.\n\nNext appeared a beautiful prawn atop a smooth rock, and an oyster shell containing two oysters within ... OK, I hate to be repetitive, but rarely has a prawn attained such perfection. Sweet, firm, and such purity of flavor! The oysters? Stunningly delicious.\n\nWe moved on to Le Jardins du Printemps - the Garden of Spring. Made from carrot, roasted beet, parsnip puree, and microgreens, with \"dirt\" made of (IIRC) toasted rye. Playful, whimsical, and very, very flavorful. This is typical of all the food here - each individual component possesses such a purity of flavor, yet works seamlessly with the other components on the dish.\n\nNext came the Foie Gras, poached in milk with fried baby artichokes and crostini. Fabulous and, again, words cannot convey the visual and organoleptic appeal of these dishes.\n\nAfter a charming palate cleanser of while balsamic vinegar and house-made vanilla soda came the sous vide egg with celery root chips, legume sprouts and rye - out of this world!\n\nThe Arctic Char was also cooked sous vide, then seared skin-side down, with a vanilla gel\u00e9e, licorice, fennel and asparagus that was phenomenally delicious. And following the fish, came the lamb tenderloin, served atop a pur\u00e9e of carrot, and served with baby carrot, coffee, and micro-greens. Excellent!\n\nA wonderful cheese course followed, and then the desserts.  \n\nPine branches in a pool of dry ice, flowing over the top of the table - pine-scented marshmallow lollipops ..  followed by a series of \"Mignardises\" (or \"Treats\") - a carrot-infused marshmallow (the only less-than-wonderful part of the meal), a tasty tidbit of fruit gel\u00e9e, milk chocolate ganache, and a thin bark of 73% dark chocolate dusted with raspberry powder.\n\nA breath-taking meal and one that (for me) firmly sets Atelier Crenn in that rarified atmosphere of the very best of San Francisco restaurants.", "author": "Jason L."}

After reading other Yelpers' 4/5-star reviews posted around the same time, I began to wonder if they went to a different Atelier Crenn.  What we experienced at Atelier Crenn was a disappointment.  The portions were tiny and we had the longest 4 hours dinner with the most inattentive service ever experienced at any fine restaurant.  \n\nThere was so much waiting around and thumb twirling throughout our evening.  Although we were promptly seated, we waited a good 15 minutes before we were greeted by a server and offered water/drinks.  There was at least 20 minutes wait between water and wine service, and waited another 15 minutes before our orders were taken.  \n\nWe opted for the 3-course meal but should have selected the tasting menu if we only knew about their portions.  We waited another 30 minutes or so for our amuse bouche.  I immediately noticed we had no utensils but unable to catch our server because he disappeared as soon as he placed the plate on our table.  The oyster with nori was the most memorable piece from the amuse bouche.  Again, we waited for some time before getting my FI's probably \"one bite\" size abalone and my appetizer selection, The Sea, which was according to the server, \"Chef Crenn's interpretation of the aquatic flavors from the sea while she lived in Europe as a child...\" with nothing more than several small sea morsels:  mussels, clams, and fish/squid balls.  \n\nAbout another 40 minutes into our ordeal, we received our entrees with the server finally decided to make an appearance to apologize for the extremely long wait.  During this waiting period, our empty wine glasses went unnoticed and my FI had to find another server to order a bottle of wine.  The server also neglected to fill our wine glasses until he was asked since our wine bottle was placed on the center island along with other diners' wine bottles.  When our entrees finally arrived, we thought the server made a mistake as the entrees (pigeon and arctic char) appeared the same size as the appetizers... a few bites worth of food!\n\nThe chocolate and pistachio dessert was innovatively prepared with molecular gastronomy technique.  However, I found it tasted somewhat bland and not as exciting as its preparation.\n\nEven though Chef Crenn's dishes were artistically presented and the food tasted very good for the most part, I just cannot justify the slow and inattentive service and insubstantial portions.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-29", "description": "Great art is difficult to turn into a business.  Especially poetry.  \n\nMany poets are not recognized by their contemporaries, largely because they don't match their creation with the taste and prevailing winds of the day.  Emily Dickinson, for example, did not accomplish fame during her lifetime; it was only years after her death that her genius was truly recognized.\n\nAs a \"poetic culinaria,\" Atelier Crenn risks falling into the very same trap.  \n\nKnowing fully well that the restaurant has only been open a few days, I want to establish that my review is largely based on areas where the restaurant is flawed in concept, versus mere execution details.  In this way I feel I can be constructive and not viciously attack those rough areas which will, in due time, become smooth.\n\nThe menu is subdivided into three basic choices:  three courses, five courses, and a full degustation option of about 11 courses total.\n\nWe opted for the five course menu.  \n\nThis setup is problematic because one is led to believe that fewer courses means larger portions but less variety.  In reality the chef, in pursuing her delicate art, opts for very small plates indeed.  Some may say refined; others may, unfortunately, read dainty and pretentious.\n\nThe amuse bouche is a lovely selection of varied shellfish, a slow cooked quail egg, a grapefruit foam (that collapsed immediately) and a small potato \"souflee.\"  I quite like that it's a real taste of the chef's cuisine and not just a time filler.\n\nMy first course was abalone which was a $10 supplement to the menu.  It's served with a delicate pamplemousse (grapefruit) sorbet.  it's also tiny verging on hilarious.  Five small pieces of abalone.  There's a perfunctory but nicely made (if quickly cold) onion dashi.  Even Coi's abalone course, as part of a 13 course menu, is more substantial.\n\nThe potato course is fairly pedestrian in my opinion.  The cheese and ham broth is great but it's nothing but comfort food in ludicrous miniature.  \n\nSweetbreads with bone marrow.  What could be better?  I don't know, more?  It's offal for crying out loud.  This is rustic cuisine; plating it otherwise doesn't make it less rustic.  The seasoning and execution are great, though.\n\nA main course of lamb neck is actually pretty substantial; in terms of quality, it has excellent flavor, but even so I found it a bit on the dry side and somewhat grisly.  I suppose some might consider lamb neck a bit of a novelty, but Incanto has been doing it forever, as a wholesome, rustic, gut-sticking option.   The flavor is excellent, the sauce and plating are great.  But given the daintiness of everything else, it's actually just a slab of meat.\n\nThe Sea.  Wow.  Now the waiter explained that this has something to do with the chef's childhood in Britain.  Poor lady!  Did you grow up very poor?  Were you scrounging on the seashore for whatever rogue morsels you could find?  My goodness.\n\nThis is a first for me, where the main course is actually in comparable size and quantity to the amuse bouche.\n\nAre you kidding?  \n\nThere is a vast, vast difference between being minimalist and being minimal.  To my mind the former is about stripping something to its core essence and bringing that to light most favorably; the latter is about being skimpy, reducing beyond necessity.\n\nThe line was crossed.  Minimal, yes; whatever artistic value does not save a plate of ten tiny bits of shellfish from veering off into utter pretense.\n\nMoving on, the cheese course is great but the concept is flawed.  There's a selection of five cheeses, and each person gets to choose one, which is delivered as a rather large slab.\n\nA cheese course is about variety, guys.  We weren't born to dutifully consume cheese.  You offer a cheese course to give us a taste of something new and we know, being reasonably intelligent mice, looking at the cart, that you can cut any size you want.  Give us half the size of two, not one big one, and offer it graciously for our comfort and pleasure.\n\nNow, dessert.\n\nOne is a red quinoa cooked in hazelnut milk with chamomile ice cream.   It's fine and interesting.\n\nThe other is this coconut thing that, by my estimation, is one of the very best desserts I've had anywhere in the world.  If art can devolve into utter pretense, as we've seen, it can also produce real and lasting greatness.  And here it is.\n\nSeriously, if this Atelier thing doesn't work out, please, consider just setting up a food cart in Dolores Park selling that coconut dessert.  You could probably IPO in a few years with it.  It's truly remarkable.\n\nOther notes:  no bread?  Really?  That's a new one by me.  Especially considering the long waits between courses which I chalk up to your newness.\n\nI'm torn on this place.  The food is absolutely terrific but tiny.  I hope it changes direction and improves.  The world needs more great art.", "author": "J W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-12", "description": "There are few things worse than Yelp mouthbreathers who will lower the rating of a place just because of the price: as if they're too stupid to notice that there is a deliberate \"Price Range\" ranking independent of the star rating. (This isn't brain surgery, kiddies.) Because it's simply asinine to equate a four-star rating for a $100/plate top-end restaurant with one for a $4 burrito joint with a non-functioning toilet. They're not even on the same planet.\n\nSo yeah, it's expensive. But that's what those $$$$ signs are for. But compare this place with others of its ilk, and it measures up admirably. Most pricey SF restaurants try to excel by being more local and more organic than the next guy, and that routine gets old quickly when you compare it with the restaurant diversity of a New York, for example. So what's great here is that the food is unique for the area. Chef Crenn does a great job exploring the human palate with simple, small bites that are of some of the best examples you've ever tasted of an item.\n\nThe downside is that while the food has some soul, it's not the most filling meal. Carbohydrates are hard to come by, as the menu is dominated by a dazzling array of proteins and fats.\n\nAlso on the negative side, the service is still working the kinks out. We got to finish a decanter of some other table's wine during an obvious mix-up. And there are still coordination issues between the staff -- such as not being able to time wine pairings properly with each course.\n\nAnd if you must harp on price, the wine list is insanely reasonable for a restaurant of this kind. But beware the Michael Mina touch of a pairing menu that's often overloaded with Austrian Reislings and light on decent reds. Still, it's a star of SF. And given how few peers it has at what it does, it gets a 5-star. Use the dollar sign ratings to weigh as you wish. And if you want to complain that you don't leave here feeling like a bloated pig waiting for the slaughter, I'm sure the nearest all-you-can-eat Sizzler will gladly take your money.", "author": "Teddy B."}

I was really excited since I have followed Chef Crenn's progress after Iron Chef and since she left Luce.  Here is the breakdown as we saw it:\n\nPros: All of the food was absolutely delicious.  Actually, if I was to give a star rating on just the food, it would be 5 ++++ stars.  Seriously this is probably some of the most amazing food I have ever eaten.  And the desserts blew our socks off.  My husband does not like pistachios and he scarfed the pistachio chocolate dessert down like there was no tomorrow and looked at me like I was a deranged alien when I tried to get a taste.\n\nCons: Prices are definitely on the high side, however we knew this coming in.  What I did not prepare for was the really small amounts served.  We chose the three course tasting menu, and for the price we paid, I should not have had to consider buying some pizza from down the street to satisfy my hunger.  Service also was a bit slow, but thankfully we were not in a rush.  My husband was hungry though and it didn't help that he wasn't getting any fuller in between each course.\n\nOverall:  This place is great for a special evening out.  If I had the money, and ate a good meal beforeheand, I would come a lot more frequently.  The atmosphere is really warm and inviting, and Chef Crenn spends some time with each table of diners throughout the night which I thought was an exceptionally nice touch.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

You can see every diner in the room including the kitchen. Menu has two tasting options. We went for the chef's menu. The menu came in a poem which each line represented a dish. Very creative. Once we got our orders in, Chef Crenn herself came out and welcomed us and chatted with us a bit, which I thought was very nice of her and she did that with each new table. As the dishes started to come out the presentations were artfully pretty, pretty enough not to eat. They were not only pretty but tasted amazing as well. Chef's passion comes through in both her plating and taste of her dishes. I crave for the crunchy quinoa and barley in a dashi broth. I could eat a whole bowl of that and it be my comfort food. Service was on point. Wine was wonderful. We were well taken care of. After our dinner was done Chef Crenn came back out to our table to chat and ask about our dinner. We definitely will be back when we get the chance. Thank you to the staff and to the Chef for making our last Anniversary Dinner a great one.", "author": "Ardielyn F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-18", "description": "We did the grand tasting, which indeed met the criteria for \"grand\", with 14 courses. The food was impeccable and presented in astounding fashion. The dishes were absolutely unique and perfectly executed. True molecular gastronomy.  The stoneware/dishwares were absolutely gorgeous and added to the drama of each dish. Service was totally fine; not pushy but on pointe. \n\nI hesitate to give Atelier Crenn 5 stars due to other areas that I did not think constituted the price tag. For me, a 5-star dining experience is more than just about the food. Ambiance, culture, service all plays into it - and these are the areas that AC could improve on, particularly when a bill for 4 comes out to over $1200.\n\nThe lighting was appalling to me. In the small room we sat at a 4-top table near the back kitchen. The kitchen has a overly bright florescent light that shines directly into the eyes of everyone at this table. I felt like I needed some sunglasses or that I was in a grocery store. The open kitchen aesthetic is en vogue right now, but a simple curtain to shield the florescent lighting in the kitchen would improve diners' experience when paying top dollar to sit in this room. The furnishings -- although I appreciate minimal -- were a bit too flimsy and lacked elegance. For example, there was no place to put my handbag so I set it on the concrete floor under my chair. \n\nNext, the bathroom. There is only one. And we were near it. So, while we were being presented with our exceptional courses we looked up to see a line of men and women waiting in their Sunday best for the john. Not so appetizing. Also, this is a unisex bathroom. When I go to this kind of eating establishment, I don't expect to have to put the toilet seat down after the guy in front of me or rush to fix my fancy nylons because there's a big line for the only bathroom. I am a lady and when I go out to these dinners, I want a mirror and a little privacy to re-organize myself midway through the 5 hour experience. \n\nFinally, although it wasn't a big deal, I did not think that the sommelier was accurate in his description of the first bottle of wine we ordered. We all enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite what we had in mind. \n\nOverall, great experience. Exceptional, innovative cuisine. Love supporting women owned businesses. Thank my dear boyfriend for sponsoring this culinary journey. Would recommend this place more whole-heartedly if it cost a little less or if they improved some of the aesthetic flaws of the space.", "author": "Julie D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-29", "description": "Whimsical. Playful. Delicious. \n\nThose are the 3 words I would use to describe my meal at Atelier Crenn. Their nondescript menu supposedly allows the diner to just enjoy the experience without overthinking it too much. Personally, I think that's crap. I like to know the \"what\" and \"how\" when it comes to my food. (Chalk it up to my science background. I'm curious enough as it is. Throw molecular gastronomy in the mix and my mind explodes!) But I had such a fun and enjoyable experience that I'm willing to overlook this. The food was delicious and landscaped dishes works of art...\n\nThe AMUSE BOUCHE of frozen pea soup, beet meringue, and mushroom consomme (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=0LObtyI22d2B-MSxbED17Q) was such a fun way to start the meal and perfectly set the tone for what's to come. \n\nWe started with the LE JARDIN AND ITS SOIL (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=Ic-MKIRONqLcl6L7dzkPcQ) and ARTICHOKE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=NM0x9EvJMnbLXUUqFw0H0Q). Being a huge meat-lover, I was all that excited about these dishes, particularly the former since it was just a bunch of raw veggies.\n \nI really started to get into the food with the meat-containing dishes. The perfectly cooked SWEETBREADS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=H8d99TCJ6rslDKbKoaHVCQ) were great with the broccolini and yummy smoked ham hock broth. I eat a lot of FOIE GRAS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=tRuVaIHvWzVi306t5q-aSg) and this was one of the best I've had! Sous vide, frozen, then seared to order, it was not only perfectly cooked but maintained the most structural integrity of any foie I've had--it didn't break apart nor was there much oil oozing out as I cut into it. The buttery and melt-in-my-mouth foie gras was topped with crushed hazelnuts, which added the perfect textural contrast and just the right amount of saltiness.\n\nAlthough the WALK IN THE FOREST (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=icNhurYuZNF8FdoWyJHxQw) was meatless, I was amazed at how good it was. Underneath a variety of mushrooms prepared using different methods (e.g. pickled, roasted) was a large smear of toasted meringue, whose sweetness and caramelized flavours went perfectly with the earthy and tangy fungi. I scraped my fork thoroughly over my plate to make sure I got it all. (If I was alone, I would've licked my plate.) THE SEA (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=RZCkI7s8WZUsn9s7UrbFlA), consisted of bite-size morsels of prawns, mussels, sea urchin, abalone, oyster, and squid \"dumplings\". All the seafood was incredibly fresh and their flavours really came through. (The prawn was so prawn-y!) The very unique squid dumplings were like squid-flavoured gnocchi with a stickier consistency. I really want to know how they were made!\n\nThe LAMB (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=J-PLUhdaK6_uCSmoT3ZD_A) and PIGEON (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=Pnfks6O66asyim93jayfFQ) were both perfectly seasoned and cooked--so tender and juicy!--and the accompaniments worked well with them too. We also got the ARTIC CHAR (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=mj4R9FdbaZ5nuJH2A49Ctg) from the Tasting Menu. (Bonus points to them for being flexible about that!) Unfortunately, this was the most uninspired dish of the night--basically just a piece of fish covered with foam and some fava beans. Gently cooking it sous vide meant that certain qualities of raw fish were maintained, which I thought I would be a fan of; however, it lacked textural contrast and I missed the flakiness from conventionally-cooked fish. It was like eating a giant piece of underseasoned sashimi. I didn't care much for the foam and fava beans either.\n\nLuckily, our meal returned to form with the desserts. All 3 were all amazing! And none of them were overly sweet. The COCONUT RHUBARB (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=z7eoCDuW3CaAiGIZvK1glQ) topped with shaved ice was so refreshing. By far the most whimsical dish of the night was the moist and flavourful CARROT CAKE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=XYgrDxOxVRY001sQz44WpQ), which came in the form of an actual carrot. The cake was *inside* the \"carrot\"! (See picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=rEH7e9DCumLRzJdVEJyRHA) And the pea sorbet totally worked with it. The CHOCOLATE, PISTACHIO, PEAR dessert (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c3khi7kxBaA2ATUuMjtMZA?select=TiSEmGtkFg0xUiHhKRinEg) was just as fun and tasty. What looked like green moss with a bunch of brown rocks was actually a light and airy chiffon cake with soft frozen chocolate mousse. This was great with the juicy and slightly crunchy pears.\n\nI can't wait to come back to see what else Chefs Crenn and Contreras has up their sleeves!", "author": "Steph L."}

Atelier Crenn delivers the OPPOSITE experience. Crenn's food piques all the senses. It is mindful eating (forgive the California-ism), with the focus on the purity and intensity of flavor in every foraged mushroom, dollop of sturgeon pearl, cloud of lemon foam, and perfect shred of tender lamb. And it is beyond-delicious.\n\nYes, the food is uncommonly beautiful - plated with stone and wood and like an oil painting - but this is not laboratory-style gastronomy. It honors the earth it came from. And nothing is sacrificed for the artistry - flavor rules to an extent that seems almost magical.\n\nCertainly this is unique eating, especially for Americans.

We both ordered the 4-courser, but thankfully got to ogle the 10-course meal that the people at the table next to us ordered. The menu is a bit thin on description, which is fantastic, because it tells you just enough to know if you'll like the ingredients in the dish without spoiling the surprise of how artfully it's presented. For example, the dessert we got was \"Chocolate, Pistachio, and Pear,\" and what arrived was like a little microcosm of forest with each ingredient made to look like a log, or moss, etc.\n\nOne of my favorite things was actually the chef's appetizer, which was a beet merengue that, when you ate it, just melted in your mouth and released an intense and enjoyable beet flavor. The foie gras and pickled beet (I like beets, as you can tell) was also amazing.\n\nService-wise, we had no complaints.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-30", "description": "This is one of my favorite new restaurants in SF. Chef Dominique Crenn is definitely a creative, culinary genius worthy of all the praise she's received so far and more. Her plating and arrangements are fun and artistic; in many cases there isn't even a plate, but a polished stone, a slate, a bonsai tree branch, or even a log of wood. Words don't do them any justice. You need all your senses to truly experience it.\n\nI've been here on three occasions:\n* Jeremy Fox vegetable collaboration event\n* Chef's spring tasting menu, seven course prefixe\n* Six course Champagne pairing event\n\nOn normal nights, they have a couple of tasting menu options, including a vegetarian. They are also very accommodating to diners with allergies, and will often create custom tasting menus depending on the restrictions. Prices range from $75-125 per person, not including wine or pairings.\n\nToo bad I don't remember all of the courses from all the dinners, but here are some of the highlights:\n* Crispy kale chips on a tree branch (Jeremy Fox event)\n* Unique Kir Breton amuse bouche, which is a tiny globe filled with refreshing apple cider.\n* Sous vide duck egg  (Jeremy Fox event)\n* Foie gras, so smooth and buttery\n* Wagyu beef tartare with smoked sturgeon roe (Champagne event)\n* Pork loin, savory and delicious\n* Nice cheese plate options\n* Juan Contreras nature-themed desserts, like a crazy delicious olive gelato served on a log of wood, or a bonsai tree decorated with candy.\n\nTheir wine list is nice, but at every visit we had the sommelier do the pairings for us. The champagne event was most unique and memorable; it was fun trying out seven different champagnes in one sitting.\n\nDominique Crenn herself is also cool and humble. She often visits guests at their tables and greets them with a glowing smile and friendly handshake. I also got to meet the managing partner, who is just as cool. I learned that they plan on doing seasonal events like the Champagne paring to keep the dining experience always fresh and dynamic.  I really hope they are blessed with michelin stars at some point.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-13", "description": "I have many vices.  I love shoes, handbags, travel, lip glosses, hoarding pets, and cursing, but everyone who knows me knows that my greatest loves are food, wine, and beer.  Now I can add Dominique Crenn to my list of loves.  She and her sommelier are gods.\n\nBoyfriend and I went to Atelier Crenn for our Valentine's Day dinner even though there wasn't a special Vday menu, which is our usual M-O.  No matter.  It was one of the most amazing meals we've ever had, and we should know.  We almost ate the entire menu.  \n\nWe did the largest chef's tasting menu with wine pairing, and not one course disappointed.  We've dined on Hubert Keller, Joel Robuchon, Rick Bayless, Michael Mina, Masa's, Wylie Dufresne, and we know how amazing it is that this chef did not miss a beat.  She pitched a perfect game.\n\nIn fact, since it was all great, I'll just tell you about the highlights. Otherwise, you'd have to relive my 3-hour meal:\n1. Amuse bouche -- 5 individual amuses.  Start with the oyster and seaweed, which is beyond simplicity and incomprehensibly delicious.  End with the speck, which is a heady teaser for the rest of the meal.\n2.  Mushrooms -- Earthy and melts in your mouth.\n3.  Foie gras -- My only regret about this course was that boyfriend sent the waiter away when we could've gotten a 2nd portion.  OMG, it was sooo good.  Salivating now thinking about it.  Now I know that some people don't like organ meat, but for those people I say, sucks to be you and more organ meat for me.\n4.  Walk through the garden -- Now you're going to have to trust me on this, but this all-veggie course was actually REALLY good.  I don't normally say this, just like I don't normally let people finish telling me about their favorite vegetarian restaurant or the best vegetarian meal they've ever had.  I have better things to do than to listen to sci-fi, but for a meatarian, this was a quick trip into a vegetable garden that I didn't hate.  In fact, I was a happy forager.\n5.  Taste of the sea -- My love of pork belly has really taken a beating these last few years, what with every chef thinking that they can do right by pork belly.  That said, I think pork belly has just gotten the beat down by a tiny morsel of heavenly rock shrimp.  I tried to convince boyfriend that it sucked and that he shouldn't eat it, but apparently, his love for me doesn't involve believing lies about shellfish.  I could have eaten the entire ocean of this course.\n6.  Originally our chef's tasting menu did not include the sweetbreads, but I live by a firm belief that you never know unless you ask.  So I HAD to ask.  Could we add the sweetbreads with marrow to our menu...you know bc we hadn't had enough fat and salt yet?  Not surprisingly, the chef was gracious and allowed us to do so, and low and behold it was awesome.  Not sure if we could have also asked for lipitor, but I didn't want to press my luck.\n7.  The only difference in mine and boyfriend's menu came at the meat course.  He isn't a fan of lamb, and I am a fan of trying EVERYTHING.  So he had the pigeon, and I got the lamb.  Both of the dishes were great, but the pigeon was outstanding.  I know that a lot of Americans hate pigeons, not knowing anything about the birds or ever having tried it, but I can assure you that pigeon can be an absolute delicacy if done right.  Dominique Crenn's interpretation of the pigeon was even better than the smoked pigeon that we had in Barcelona.  Make sure to try it and give a little respect for those valiant birds!!  Some of them have been designated war heroes.\n8.  The wine and beer pairings -- Simply put, the sommelier kicks ass.  You wouldn't know it by looking at him bc he looks like a cool dude that you'd meet at the local bar or following Green Day, but what he does he does with the precision and accuracy of a scientist.  I could totally hang with this guy all the time, though I'd probably end up an alcoholic bc I wouldn't be able to say no to anything that he offered.  His wine pairings rivaled what we've had at Masa's.\n\nThe service was also amazingly gracious.  The only hiccup was in the succession of the courses of the foods themselves.  This new restaurant and its staff are still working out come kinks:  We almost got the foie gras twice, and we never got the abalone.  We also never really got a chance to order the dessert.  A dessert just showed up.  Boyfriend hates coconut so it was really lucky that the coconut dessert was actually really good.

Several of our companions are vegetarians - and I thought their meals got somewhat of a short shrift on both ingredients, flavor and execution.

Here are some of my impressions of the various courses (no notes, just going from memory):\n\nPotato chips with miso & dried kale: Serviceable start to the tasting menu. Good but nothing special.\n\nFoie gras, pate on toast, freeze-dried pea soup: This was more like it. Both the foie gras and pate were scrumptious. The pea soup was more of a novelty but interesting nonetheless.\n\nOyster & Sea Urchin: Delicious combination of brininess.\n\nKir Breton: Delightful sphere of cider that explodes in your mouth. \n\nLe Jardin d'Hiver: Parsnip puree along with assorted baby vegetables and rye \"dirt\". Simple looking but complex flavors.\n\nFoie Gras with Truffle: Wonderful dish. Heavenly smooth foie gras with the earthiness of the truffle.\n\n\"Walk in the Forest\": Various mushrooms on top of toasted pine meringue. A bit on the tart side due to the pickled mushrooms.\n\nTrou Normand: Meyer lemon ice. Flavorful but a bit hard to eat since it was too frozen.\n\nEgg yolk with rye, celery, and truffle: Probably my least favorite dish as it was all texture and not much flavor even with the celery and truffle.\n\nPigeon: Tasty but a very small portion. Perhaps four bites. Maybe duck would be a better substitute?\n\nCheese: A small wedge of cheese from their cart. Five different choices. Had the sheep's milk and it was good but pricey at a $10 upcharge.\n\nEpilogue: Pine branch \"lollipop\" and a forest mushroom scene composed of ice cream caps, cookie stems, \"dirt\", \"hay\", and \"leaves\". All the elements worked together to make it an inventive, playful and delectable dessert.\n\nMidnardise: Lychee candy, salted caramel, chocolate truffle, and thin pane of 85% dark chocolate. The chocolates were good but nothing compelling but the salted caramel was some of the best caramel that I've ever had. The lychee was intense and a good departure from the norm.\n\nService was excellent. The entire tasting menu took four hours to complete so be sure to set aside enough time!\n\nTo summarize, it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely go back.

Chef Crenn has created a \"workshop\" of culinary adventure.  I had dinner here two weeks ago and it was one of the top 5 meals I have ever had in terms of the entire experience.  When you eat at Atelier Crenn, do not just expect a meal with amazing food but you are on a culinary journey and experience with Chef Crenn.  From the appetizer to the final dessert, Chef Crenn puts her heart in every dish and tells a story through each dish.  I will not ruin the surprise by talking about each dish, but be prepared to be amazed from the menu which is a poem to the final dessert which is located in a wooden chest that has a letter to her father thanking him for all he has instilled in her.  With all the success, Chef Crenn is still in the kitchen being the director to her amazing staff.  She loves talking to her diners and is humble and friendly.  The service here is spectacular as well with friendly wait staff that know you by name.  The difference between a two and three star restaurant is subtle yet significant.  Both types of restaurants must have amazing food and staff, but the feeling of an \"experience\" rather than a meal elevates it to a three star restaurant. I will definitely come here again for the next new adventure and by that time, I hope that Michelin will award the third star that this establishment deserves.

Our courses came out in sea shells, test tubes, honeycombs, logs....I was amused & delighted all at the same time. The Chef came out to meet the guests& discuss particular meal & perhaps the idea / philosophy behind it. \nMy favorite was Ode to Honey that simply left me speechless- it was a beautifully presented chamomile honey desert that in one bite took me back to childhood when whatever ailed you could be fixed with chamomile&honey.

This was the first and only thing that threw me for a loop because it was dry, came with no butter and made no sense. It honestly made me concerned for the rest of our meal. Thank the heavens that wasn't the case.\n\nThe dismal bread rolls were followed by two separate amuse bouches which were fresh and cleansing.\n\nWhat I enjoyed from the 4 Courses Prix Fixe menu:\n\nI looked at the menu before getting to the restaurant and these were picks before hearing to the server suggestions. I'm glad I stuck to my choices...\n\nNew Potato: Gorgeous, light, clean and really melts in your mouth. The right combination of pillows of potato, comte crisps and peas was music in my mouth\n\nFoie Gras: I was the only who got this at the table and I'm so glad I did. The the foie gras was shaved beautifully like thick chocolate shavings and it came adorned with a spring fruit compote. It was umbelievably good and light. \n\nDuck: Best tasting presentation of duck I've ever had in my life! The tender duck combined with strawberry, rhubarb, smoked buckwheat and a sliver of crispy duck skin was divine. I could help but ooh and aah.\n\nCarrot \"Cake\": A beautiful presentation and interpretaion of carrot cake. i won't ruin the surprise for you if you enjoy carrot cake, get it.\n\nWhat my chickadees enjoyed:\n\nLe Jardin:  Beautifully pickled assortment of root vegetables. A tad salty for me.\n\nAsparagus: Very springy and flavorful, although the combo of lard, goat hollandaise and trout caviar was a tad salty for me again.\n\nThe Sea: A wonderful combination of smoked oysters, delightful piece of arctic char, uni and oysters. Th textures were intriguing and bursting of the sea.\n\nWalk in the Forest: We all really wanted to like this dish because the selection and preparation of mushrooms was delicioso but it was all presented ontop of an unusually large layer of meringue which was too sweet and awkward. It perfectly completely the \"look\" of the dish but we're not just here to \"look\" right?\n\nChocolate Pistachio Pear: Creatively presented and the best dessert of the three.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-22", "description": "This was the most creative, unusual meal of my life. I have tried chef's tasting menus at some other prominent restaurants but this one took it in terms of adventurousness and thematic harmonies. The ingredients were all superb individually and in combination, the flavors were distinct, bold, and working together and apart in very interesting ways - sometimes smoothly, sometimes with deliberate friction. Some of the dishes get just plain weird - but in a good way, stretching you. The menu unfolds like a story and you very much feel the chef's imagination threading through the whole thing (the menu is a poem that she wrote which contains no specific names of any food item). The desserts were crazy strange/good. The wines at this restaurant were universally excellent. Service was down to earth but polite and super professional. Of note, the staff makes a tremendous effort to accommodate dietary preferences - very difficult in such a complex menu but they try hard. Also, the chef and her staff are friendly and welcoming. All in all, this is a truly memorable experience and in a couple of months when they switch up the menu a bit, it would be worth going back for what is possibly the most interesting and unique Michelin-rated restaurant in SF (2 stars!). By the way, Dominique Crenn is the only woman in the U.S. to have achieved this. \n\nMaybe because of all the acclaim, the prices seem to have gone up. For the short chef's menu it is $95 and the long menu is now $180. With tax and tip plus 5 drinks, we spent $800 for 3 people. But, amazingly, we thought it was worth it.

The space gave me the feel of a Japanese country house, perhaps an indication that there is some fusion of french, cal-american, and asian restraint.  Whatever, Chef Crenn has a sure hand.  \n\nI went with a five course meal, consisting of 3 savory courses, cheese and dessert.  A preface to the proceedings was a six part amuse that livened the palate and announced that the meal would be special.  \n\nA lovely salad with the chef's signature \"dirt\" and a touch of what I would call molecular gastronomy was artwork.  More importantly, it was artwork that tasted wonderful.  I should comment that the molecular flourishes throughout the meal served the food rather than simply being foolish showoff.\n\n\"The sea\" was a complex melange of cuttlefish ground into the shape of mini raviolis, rock shrimp, freeze dried spices, seaweed and more.  It was light, different, and quite lovely.\n\nLamb neck was an ample serving of braised fatty meat that that had been rolled about itself to give the appearance of neck.  It was a perfect balance of fat and savory.  It came with leeks prepared three ways.\n\nThe cheese course was unique as it was accompanied by a honeycomb that added a woody touch of sweetness to the course.  \n\nDessert.  Coconut.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-26", "description": "Went here for my birthday dinner with the hubby a couple of weeks ago.  I cannot believe this place only has one Michelin star.  It is easily better than Coi or Cyrus, both 2-star places, and is in the same league as Manresa, which has had 2 stars for ages.\n\nAt first I was thinking about just going for the classic menu for $95, but a friend of mine who went recently said it wasn't quite enough food, so hubby and decided to splurge on full tasting menu and wine pairings ($160, +$90 for the regular wine pairing).  I'm so glad we did since it was totally worth it (and we were definitely NOT hungry in the end!)  Including multiple amuses-bouche, palate cleansers, and desserts it must have been at least 18-19 courses...we got there at 7pm and we left at 11:30pm.  \n\nI probably won't have the space to talk about every single one but here are the highlights: \n- \"Kir Royale\" amuse-bouche:  I'm a sucker for molecular gastronomy and one of my favorite techniques are when they make these little spheres that are filled with liquid-y goodness.  It did taste like a kir royale...though I do wish it had champagne inside instead of the cider!\n- Speaking of champagne, they started our wine pairings with a wonderful bubbly and they served it in these cool wine glasses (those extra wide ones that are supposedly shaped after Marie Antoinette's breast).  You just don't see those anymore really and they were just so fun and festive.  The bubbly was good too. :)\n- Oyster:  It was served with a really great soup/sauce, and it even had an \"oyster leaf\" palate cleanser that went right before it, which was a leaf that tasted like an oyster!  Definitely never had anything like that before\n- Razor clam: I loved razor clams in Spain, but this is definitely a very different preparation than anything I've had there.  Maybe because I've never had it with carrot foam before.  A lot of people hate on foam, but I think when it works, it just really works.  This is one of those dishes.\n- Abalone:  This was definitely one of the WOW dishes.  Just had so much flavor, and it was actually a pretty decent sized portion.  At this point, I thought this was the best item on the menu, that is until the next course...\n- Foie Gras:  This was easily the dish of the night, and probably the best preparation of cold foie gras that I've ever had (better than the French Laundry!)  The texture was just perfect, it was so cold and thin, but melted instantly as soon as you put it in your mouth.  Came with a nice piece of brioche.  Makes me sad that I'll probably never have it again after the foie gras ban takes effect in July :(\n- Palate cleanser \"lollipop\".  This thing was sticking out of a plant.  Seriously.  It may be too much for some, but I actually dig the over-the-top presentation.  And it was yummy :)\n- Some sort of dessert with liquid nitrogen:  I don't even know how to describe it, except it was weird, and tasty, and unlike anything I've had before.  Spectacular.\n- Extra desserts:  I got an extra dessert since it was my birthday! :)  The split log of mignardises came around the same time, and it was full of awesome.  I only wish they had little to-go boxes for these candies like some places I've been to since I was ready to burst at this point.\n\nThe wine pairings was excellent overall, and the pours were very generous.  I do kinda wish there were more red wines, but since most of the early courses were light vegetables or seafood I can see why there were a lot of white wines.  My favorite was a wonderful beaujolais which was probably had the most \"oomph\" out of any beaujolais I've ever tried, and this was definitely the best and most surprising wine of the evening.  I definitely appreciated getting extra pours when we needed it, like when we finish a wine after one course that's supposed to last 2 courses (Oops...you put it in front of me, I will drink it!).  I think they probably underestimated our wine-drinking capability though, since even after we put away all the extra pours, I was still craving some wine during my cheese course, which didn't come with any.  I wish they had given me the option to get a glass of port then, though I finally decided to get a port-like French fortified wine to go with the last of the desserts.\n\nChef Crenn came by the table to say hi, which is always great, not all top chefs do this, or are even present in the restaurant every night.  This dinner definitely blurred the line between food and entertainment.  My only regret is that I didn't get to take a picture of every single dish since everything looked spectacular (not that pictures would do it any justice).  This is definitely one of my top meals I've ever had, and I would love to come back someday.", "author": "Arlene M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-11-20", "description": "This was the most exciting culinary experience of my life. Everything was so inventive and rad and over the top in the best way possible. The flavors, the presentation, the service, the ambiance. Everything was crazy excellent. \n\nThe only crappy thing was the valet. I had a 5:30 reservation (same day reservation... stoked!) and I was having a hard time finding parking.... I called and they said there was valet but when I pulled around again there was no valet... I double parked and went in to ask and they then said that valet was on the corner but not open til 6:30. I am really glad I didn't use the valet since it is supposedly 18 bucks and one yelper said that at the end of their meal someone at the restaurant said they valeters were \"kind enough to drop off your keys\" and then they had to walk around the neighborhood looking for their car...... super shitty.\n\nI made a reservation at 5:10 and somehow managed to get over the bridge and to the restaurant only ten minutes late. It was just a shitty fucking day and I have found it rare that a good meal won't at least mute the most bummer of woes. A good book and this incredible meal certainly changed the general feel of my day to awesome.\n\nThe service was warm, friendly, personal and not overbearing. They still folded my napkin when I got up from the table but at least they didn't fucking escort me to the bathroom like they did at Cyrus, Gary Danko etc.  both of which always make me feel uncomfortable and embarassed, both for me and the servers.\n\nI had the Chef's grand tasting menu which is based on a poem. I am not sure how many courses, maybe twelve or fourteen including amuses and palate cleansers (maybe more?).\n\nI truly loved everything.... even the dishes with flavor profiles I don't normally enjoy like the pickled mushroom dish. Everything was served so beautifully. My favorites were a dish made of grains with trout roe and bottarga and something else in some kind of japanese broth... super good and I asked for a second helping of the nori seaweed crips with some kind of fish on top... literally seeing little orgasmy- explosions behind my eyelids at this point. The chef was kind enough to treat my second portion as a gift. The smoky squab was incredible. It was the biggest dish and literally was maybe six bites. \n\nI can see how someone would psychosomatically still find themselves to be hungry when the left considering how small each dish is, but if you stuck all the food on one plate it would look like a giant greasy spoon monstrosity (not the quality obviously, just the amount total) and I left stuffed but not too stuffed like I have at some other places. \n\nI think the decor is pretty perfect. Nicely minimal and kind of woodsy/Japanese/clean feeling. You can see the chef and her crew through a window into the kitchen. I was also impressed by the sommelier. As much as I love and know about food, I am pretty much a heathen imbecile when it comes to wine. I was able to describe what I like in very brutish terms and told him to surpass me. While I don't think there was any grangnano or lambrusco on the menu, I was served a wonderful glass of champagne and later a green sweet wine... I don't remember what either of them were but I know the latter had to be French since there was a sticker saying it was bought at kermit Lynch. I think the first was the champagne cuvee brut, Duval-Leroy 'Kir Royal' ($25 per glass) and the latter was one of these two: Chenin Blanc, Pinon Vouvray 'Cuv\u00e9e Botrytis' ($18) or Petit Manseng, Juran\u00e7on  Melleux,  Clos Uroulat ($15).\n\nI thought it was really rad that the chef came out to greet every table when things were a bit slower earlier in the evening. She seemed very genuine and lovely and not like she was 'just making the rounds'. She was very enjoyable to talk to and it seemed like a very nice personal touch to me. \n\nIt really was such a magical night.... so much so that my partner and I are going back tomorrow for our ten year. Congratulation of being the first lady in America to get two stars. You certainly deserve them!", "author": "Floozy Q."}

I went here with my g/f for Christmas as it's sort of become our yearly tradition to splurge during the holiday season. It recently got upgraded to 2 Michelin stars, so I was both excited and skeptical at the experience we were going to have. \n\nFirstly, it's a small-medium sized restaurant that's cozy and not too stuffy. The servers and staff were fine, I do give it a plus because chef Crenn did go around and greeted all her patrons which is a huge plus that she cares about her customers. \n\nWe opted for the tasting menu, which was in the form of a poem with each line describing each dish, so we didn't know *exactly* what we were getting, but it was definitely fun to anticipate each dish. Overall the meal was fun, surprising, thought-provoking, and delicious. Although I won't say my experience was 'perfect' and there was a noted disappointment that I do want to point out, the experience as a whole was generally very good.  The one dish that really stood out for me was the 'walk in the woods', which was a mushroom dish that was outstanding. Most of the other dishes were excellent as well, the numerous seafood dishes were excellent and beautifully executed. However, the dinner is without some criticism. The dessert was a major disappointment. I read about the pastry program at Crenn is supposed to be one of the better ones in the city, we had a boring brioche pudding something or other, not impressed and expected much much more. Not necessarily a negative, but I did notice a lot of the dishes were seafood and vegetable based. I would have liked to see a bit more meat in there, but not to say that everything else was bad at all. \n\nI'll definitely be back, probably in the Summer time to hopefully get a completely different meal and experience. Definitely worth the 2 stars, it's still far from the 3 though.", "author": "Justin L."}

It is my favorite restaurant in SF - one that my husband introduced me to on a lark - and I've fallen in love.\n\nThe dishes remind me of my Japanese roots in kaiseki cooking, where the point of food is to reconnect with nature and its beauty. Sometimes preparing things in the simplest way is more difficult than 15-spice seasonings.\n\nAt Atelier Crenn, I see that love and bond with nature - it's similar to what I saw at Noma, where Redzepi has hired all these foragers to go out into the Scandinavian wilds. But while the nature that Redzepi portrays is whimsical (ice cream snowman or radishes planted in edible \"dirt\"), Crenn's is more raw - she used to have one dish called \"a taste of the sea\" where the squid ink rocks looked like cliffs and the uni foam looked like dirty sea foam (I'm not kidding, and it was delicious). Her dishes are like naturescapes.\n\nI like the team as well - the pastry chef does some innovative things with desserts (perfume as dessert, anyone?)...and the sommelier has a unique vision (I've never had beer pairings in the middle of wine before). I love SF and California cooking but sometimes I feel like it's all very similar, and it's nice to break out of the norm with something spectacularly different.\n\nThe downside (and upside) of Crenn's menu is that it constantly evolves, so if there's something you like, you usually enjoy it once. While I still crave some of her early dishes, I also respect her commitment to evolution. She doesn't want to sit on the laurels of a few \"signature dishes\" like many chefs (nothing wrong with that of course, but I respect her for taking a harder route). It's a big risk for her, since a food critic could wander in during a particularly wayward experiment and not get an overall feel for the place. But that defines who she is, and she is true to that vision. \n\nIt's only been half a year and she's garnered her first Michelin star...should be interesting to see what happens next.", "author": "Maya B."}

Yep, it's 9 tiny courses, but you embark on a journey through the mind of the mad souls tucked away in their pastry kitchen. Although one shouldn't call this a pastry kitchen as no forms of pastries were served during our meal. Heavy modernist cuisine influence and not so much the classic french pastry training was exhibited during our meal. We received very very nice service and the chef cares about her dinner's experience enough to visit each table. Was it pricey? Hell yeah! Were the dishes innovative? Hell yeah! But I keep thinking to myself there wasn't a single item I crave enough to come back for. As odd as it might be, this is probably a single visit restaurant for me.

Chicago, New York, DC, and even Vegas have restaurants that push culinary boundaries, so I'm pleased to have discovered that Atelier Crenn is representing for San Francisco.\n\nMy only wish is that I'd made the cross-city trek earlier - it's a shame to have missed so many of Chef Crenn's menus.

And aptly put, the poetic flow of the \"Moments of Spring\" tasting menu kept us curious as to deciphering each stanza and predicting what we were to enjoy.\n\nI chose this place for an anniversary dinner in 2012. The dining room was a beautiful juxtaposition of modern minimalistic design with bountiful earthy features which I adored, from the wicker lamps and ceilings, the gnarled wooden wallpieces, it gave a sense of nature in the dining room that really compliments her colorful cuisine that really is meant to showcase the glory of nature. Dishes plated on rocks, dessert intermezzos hidden in eucalyptus bushes, mignardises on bonzai trees, and the like. \n\nThe cuisine was quite honestly stunning. While overly complicated courses comprised of numerous elements can often come across as a bit 'been there done that' for the SF scene, Chef Crenn managed to keep focus in the dishes where every component played its part well. The most memorable course being the 'walk in the forest' being a collection of exotic mushrooms in various preparations; roasted, pickled, etc., accompanied with a pine needle meringue and hazelnuts. I haven't been impressed by a course so much in a long time like this so that it took me a few minutes of silent (and slow) enjoyment to appreciate and maximize the pleasure in every bite. Bravo, Chef Crenn, Bravo.\n\nThis was also an experience where I tasted mackerel that I liked! I tend to avoid mackerel whenever possible but this was done spectacularly.\n\nOne course was beautifully plated, but to eat challenging and honestly unpractical. Following the amuse bouches was 'a shallow pool stirs' - a whole langoustine in the shell. Hard to eat, messy, and my hands didn't feel clean even after the towlette provided for the course. The neighboring table with the smaller tasting menu were provided a langoustine out of the shell for their course- something I would have prefered.\n\nService was flawless. Amanda was wonderful.\n\nOverall, Chef Crenn puts on quite a show with her cuisine. It's nature meets food meets art, and I loved that. I can't wait to visit again once the seasons change. However, I think I will indulge in the Chef's Tasting Menu at $95 per person which we observed our neighbors enjoying, with much large portions it seemed.\n\nWith cuisine like this, it very much could be 3 Michelin stars in the making\n\nI really, really, REALLY hope I see that mushroom course next time.", "author": "M M."}

Chef Crenn came out a couple of times to greet patrons, which is a nice touch. You can tell that a lot of thought goes into each and every detail of the food and restaurant. However, I didn't feel full when leaving the restaurant and for the price you pay, you would expect to feel at least a bit fuller than I did. My party included an additional cheese course, too.  Is it because there is not much bread that accompanies the meal (2 pieces, outside of the cheese course we had)? They give these tiny, mini pieces of bread that accompany a particular entree.  In any case, the food, atmosphere and presentation are great but the overall value is questionable given the meager portion sizes (and this is in comparison to peer restaurants of the same caliber).\n\nAlso, the restroom has a misleading sign on the door. It tells you to pull to the left to open the door...but it's a sliding door, so it should really tell you to slide the door to the left.", "author": "Pauline S."}

In a way, we got two stars for the price of one. Dining at Atelier Crenn is a unique molecular gatsronomical experience that can't be described in a way to do it justice. The menu itself is a poem, which chef Dominique Crenn uses as inspiration for her creations, making every course a complete surprise (I won't spoil it here). The menu is prix fixe, our table opted for the 5-course version (which is more like 7 courses when you consider the Amuse-bouche and palette cleansers). For me, the stand outs were the Hors d'oeuvre and the dessert - the two book-ends of the experience. At the end of our meal, most of us were still a bit hungry.

I kind of stopped writing reviews for a while, but I feel that I have to write this one, because people need to be warned.\nWe spent $500 here, for 4 people, no dessert, and we brought our own wine. It's not unusual for us to spend this much on a dinner, but it was definitely unusual for us to go to Pizza Orgazmica next door right after because all of us were starving! I wish I wrote this review right after I came home, because all the details would have still been fresh in my mind. \n The food is not bad, but the portions are so tiny! They are not even appetizer size portions! And I have been to France. I ate my way through France! Portions there are at least 3 times bigger than at this restaurant! So if they are trying to be French, I'm sorry, this is not French! I don't know what this is, but for the price, the portion size is simply unacceptable. They don't even have bread here! I usually don't eat bread in a restaurant, because I want to leave room for real food,  but bread at this restaurant would have been God send! I could just feel my metabolism slowing down throughout this meal! Presentation of the food was creative however, but who cares about that when you're starving right? Another reason we were starving is because we spent over 3 hours there for dinner. I think the chef was teasing us. Bringing out one tiny plate per person per hour. I am not kidding. And they have their own house water there, sparkling and regular, no bottled water. Supposedly it's filtered. It is not! It tasted like chlorine! And guess what? We were charged for it, per glass! I think it was either $5 or $8 per glass, I don't really remember.\nSo I really don't understand all these positive reviews.

From the elegant greeting at the door to the attentive goodbye, the staff showed experience, tact, and intelligence. \n\nThe decor is well done. The caged lights, ceiling textures, and each purposely placed painting come off as though to have a meaning within the overall purpose, design, and vision of the restaurant as a whole. \n\nThe food and general theme of the restaurant have fallen off the deep end into a black hole of the most pretentious and often made-fun-of aspects of French culture, enough to literally make you laugh at the menu. The garden vegetable salad description is expanded upon in italics: \"and its soil.\" \n\nWhat? \n\nI didn't have a clue what 'The Sea' was, and its side note of \"an interpretation of aquatic Flavors\" made me have to ask the waiter \"No, I really would like you to go down the list and describe every item. I have no idea what these are.\" The menu was confusing from a usability standpoint. I was trying not to laugh when the waiter began one description with something like \"Really, another beautiful interpretation by the chef. A late autumnal walk with her father, with texture and notes of....\" At this point the level of effort required to determine if I was ordering land, sea, or hot air made my group just want to fire and pray for glory.\n\nThe food itself was good, but only in the sense that every dish is what you would consider an experiment in the art of cooking where although something might not taste fantastic you have to label it a success simply by the amount of knowledge and mental masturbation required to have come up with the idea in the first place. I'm not sure there was a single dish that made me feel \"Mmmm. That was delicious. I'm satisfied.\" Much of that remaining feeling of want was due to the sheer tininess of every dish. You're left feeling more than the slightest bit cheated, especially for the price.   \n\nIt's one thing for a restaurant to have a number of staples, accented by flagrant experiments that attempt to push the limits of culinary art. It's also reasonably acceptable for a restaurant to push the other end of the spectrum, while maintaining a backup steak or other dish to balance the menu the smallest bit. It's another thing when your entire menu looks alien where every item acts as an accent and not a main.  \n\nThe staff were great. \n\nThe wine and espresso were fantastic.  \n\nPretentious, overpriced, and insubstantial.", "author": "Matt W."}

When I spend $160 on a meal, I expect it to taste good even if it's pretty.\n\nI really disliked the atmosphere too, it was such a classic elitist french dining experience, uncomfortable in the posture-encouraging chairs, long table which made it impossible for my girlfriend and I hear each other (also due to acoustics in the room which so many restaurants overlook).\n\nEverything was a little off, even the bathroom, which was located in the pathway to the kitchen, and lacked a vacant/occupied indication.

The decor is is understated, and bereft of such traditions as bleached white table cloths and hotel silver. In fact, there is little at all that is traditional about Atelier Crenn. It is, in fact a dramatic departure from what most people think dining is and should be. Every dish is unexpected and surprises with the presentation, and the innovative combinations, and with the flavors that are achieved. I still do to understand who she makes something as simple as a cherry tomatoes explode with depth of flavor. But it's so much more than flavor -- you will eat art -- yes, the presentations are so thoughtful, in some cases, even painstaking, that there is pleasure in simply looking at them and taking in the full concept in their construction. A word of warning, however, - if you are satisfied by slabs of beef, and big breasts of chicken slathered in sauces, buffalo wings, onion rings, and anything smothered in cheese, if you are a fan of fast food burgers, then you should look elsewhere. Atelier Crenn takes dining to a new height and does not reinforce anything that you may already know about dining. We dined for 2.5 hours and every dish was a surprise, something new to discover, and I easily could have stayed double that time had the dishes kept coming. AC is simply a must for any serious foodie. An added bonus is that rather than remaining hidden in the kitchen as so many chefs who achieve celebrity status do, Chef Crenn comes out to each table and engages her guests in conversation.

First of all, you will only be able to eat at Atelier Crenn if you are a lacto-ovo vegetarian (which I am).  I was really primed to like this place:  I'm a francophile,  I love the idea of \"poetic culinaria\", I liked the graphic design, I liked the nest-like ceiling lamps.  Our evening started somewhat stressfully because there was no one at the valet parking stand and it's a nightmare to park in this neighborhood on a Saturday night.  As a result, we finally stumbled into the restaurant 15 minutes late, but the restaurant was half-full, so it wasn't a problem.\n\nAs a vegetarian, there are exactly three courses you will be able to eat, and you must have a minimum of three courses, so you will have no choices.  The first course is called \"Le Jardin d'Hiver\", which is an assortment of about ten baby root vegetables with a yogurt sauce of sorts.  It was perfectly fine, maybe 50 calories in total.  The second course is a slow-cooked egg, which actually means an almost raw egg.  Most vegetarians are a bit queasy about animal products, and I found this one impossible to eat.  I'm okay with runny yolks, but not runny whites, especially if you don't have bread or something to sop it up (no bread here at all!).  I had to leave it, but ate the two small chanterelles and the couple of small nettle leaves used as a garnish, maybe ten calories in total.  We were given a free palate cleanser at this point, a rather sour berry sorbet that was overly frozen using dry ice or some other gastronomic technique that freezes your tastebuds.\n\nThe final course is called \"Walk in the Forest\", with the rather romantic notion of foraged mushrooms.  It was okay, maybe 20 assorted small mushrooms in total with a few herbs and a tablespoon of strangely dry sauce, about 100 calories.  So after the three courses, I considered the cheese course but glanced over at the table next to us who were having it:  razor thin flatbreads and dry-looking cheese.  We decided to bail and have a leftover baguette and Brillat Savarin at home instead.\n\nWe had a nice red wine for a reasonable price from the Corbiere region of France, an area we know well from holidays.  It was the best part of the dinner.\n\nSo if you are a vegetarian, you need to know that you will be spending over a hundred dollar for about 200 calories of so-so nourishment (few carbs or fiber).  Unless you are on an Atkins style diet, you will do well to eat before going to Atelier Crenn with friends.", "author": "Ineke R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-15", "description": "My fianc\u00e9e and I went to Atelier Crenn on tuesday, this was a recommendation from a friend who'd been there a few months ago and I have to say we were very impressed!\n\nBefore deciding to go, I read some of the reviews and saw Dominique Crenn's food was on the \"molecular\" side of the spectrum. When I think \"molecular gastronomy\", I think Coi, partially because I've very much enjoyed dining at Coi and partially because Coi is the only restaurant I've been to that practices those techniques -- gels, bubbles, foams, etc... --  so heavily. So, it's likely that there will be a number of references to Coi throughout this review because that's sort of what I had in mind when I got there, which is probably unfair and all, but eh, that's how these things go.\n\nWe had a reservation for 8:45 but were hungry so we showed up at 8:30 and were seated immediately. As we walked in the first thing I noticed, and commented on, was that the dining room was fairly loud which was not a very good start. This wasn't a good start, when I dine in this type of establishment I expect a more subdued ambiance, a quiet evening, bathed in soft lighting and the aromas of delicious foods and wines. This isn't quite how the meal started, mary and I sat down at a table on the side, in between 2 other couples. I would honestly have preferred a slightly more isolated and mostly a quieter setting. We both debated on why the place was so loud, whether it was the crowd, whether it was the bare concrete floors and bare walls, whether it was just because there were just too many tables -- the place was nearly full when we showed up -- and eventually concluded that it was probably all of the above. After a few minutes of this, we got used to it and started looking at the short, 2 pages menu. Mary is not a fan of tasting menus, she always finds them too daunting but, this one apparently didn't scare her and there were even a few items she was very excited about -- foie gras is her p\u00e9ch\u00e9 mignon -- which made me very happy.\n\nSo, off we went with the tasting menu and bottle of red wine recommended by the sommelier who was very kind and recommended bottles in all price ranges, without us asking: the recommendations ranged in prices from 60 to 400$ and we ended up with a delicious 2006 burgundy.\n\nBefore we'd picked the wine, the amuse bouche arrived, yes, we were taking our sweet time to pick the wine. The amuse bouche, served on a slate plate, consisted of a little metal spoon with frozen pea soup pearls, foie gras nibs with rose petals and a rose gel (as far as I remember), and a little wood branch with 2 chips (I can't remember what the chips were made of) with a little bit of wasabi sauce on top of the chips. The \"soup\" and the foie gras were absolutely delicious and oh so very decadent, the chip I wasn't a huge fan of, mostly a bit too salty for my taste, but I am notoriously sensitive to salt, my fianc\u00e9e, who's less sensitive than me didn't mind the salt at all, on the contrary. ;)\n\nAfter the amuse bouche came something crazy...another rectangular piece of slate with 2 little yellow round spheres with a red paste on top...at that point, we had no idea what to do with those things but the waiter nicely explained that these were the \"kir breton\" and that they came with eating instructions, namely: \"delicately pick these up with your fingers, gently place them on your tongue and close you mouth completely before biting\". OK, I don't mind instructions, I actually find it kinda funny when there are instructions but the part about completely closing our mouth (he literally said that) was a tad over the top. Regardless of the overthetopness, we followed the directions, gently picked up the spheres, gently placed the spheres in our respective mouths, and then closed our respective mouths fully before biting...then...once we did actually bite, something wonderful happened: a crazy explosion of cider! OK, other people might have described the \"kir breton\" but I didn't bother reading those comments...anyhow, the chef, Dominique, later came by and we asked her what that madness was all about and she explained that these were cocoa butter spheres filled with cider and topped with a fruit (I believe it was blackberry) jam. This was even more surprising and exciting than it was tasty!\n\nOK, now in the hope to not make a full novel out of this review, and also to let people discover some of those dishes for themselves, I'm going to shorten the review and just highlight some of the dishes that I really liked.\n\nNow yelp's yelling at me because this review's so long so I'm going to skip ahead: the oyster and shrimp was delicious, the artic char with carrot foam, fava beans and licorice was incredible, the pigeon was terrific.\n\nOK, gotta cut it short: the real star of the show was the dessert.

And, for our party of seven, able to take some ribbings.  \n\nAtmosphere:  3 Stars.  Our party dined in the back room.  It didn't have the cozy atmosphere of the front, but it started out fine.  \n-But...for a restaurant of this caliber, we shouldn't have to complain about the cold air and have nothing done about it, especially when we're the only table there by the end of the night.  \n-C'mon now folks--should we really have to walk by ugly plastic jugs of plant cuttings sitting on the floor of the walkway out back?  Kinda trashy. \n-Finally, the open bathroom window somewhat overlooks the restaurant.  Again, kinda trashy.\n\nFood:  4 Stars.  Maybe I should give three, especially when a guest finds bones in her fish, and when there are courses where the 'art' is so much better than the food.  But I must give credit for the amazing presentations, and in many cases, the taste.  You're eating art.  You're presented with lots of foams, meringues, and tiny sauces.  There are probably too many flavors on the plates; it's all hard to keep track of it all.  After nine courses, I'm ready for something more savory.  For one who truly appreciates nuances, this might be your place.  If you're looking for traditional sustenance, this probably isn't the place for you.\n\nI recently viewed a documentary of people who believe it's healthy to always be a bit hungry.  They'd probably like Atelier Crenn.  Foams and meringues go only so far.  After sitting for five (yes, five!) hours for a nine-course meal with wine pairing, and adding a pre-dessert cheese course, one might think you'd leave feeling satiated, not desiring a couple White Castle burgers to satisfy cravings. For a one-of-a-kind dining experience, though, Altier Crenn might be the place for you.", "author": "David A."}

Inventive was the word I would use to describe this place.  \n\nThe food was interesting to say the least, but you can see how much thought, freshness, and creativity went into each dish.  Chef chose different flavors and ingredients like roe, kobe beef, oysters, that were the best quality and strangely went well together.  She used very forward cooking techniques, hard to describe but was an experience. The wine pairing also meshed well with each dish we had. My favorite dish was the \"walk in the forest\" and I seriously could not name any of the 12 ingredients that was on my plate, but it really looked like a piece of artwork. It was salty, sweet, and each bite was different from the previous. Although, 3 desserts can be overkill but I loved the fact that the sorbet was served on a log, and the ice cream came with a eucalyptus plant.  I was definitely full after course 6 but still thoroughly entertained to see what the next dish would be. Service was excellent of course.  \n\nDefinitely a must try on a SF foodies list, but be ok with the fact that you may spend a lot more than you are comfortable with. A dining experience to be had.\n\nI would rate this 3.5 if I could.\n\n3.5 stars food, 5 stars service, 3 stars ambiance.", "author": "SF Diner A."}

With that said, my dinner last week at Atelier Crenn was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. Yes, it was beautiful, but more importantly, it actually tasted great. So often, these fancy restaurants serve food that clearly has no love behind it, no intention behind it, and it tastes like crap. It was clear to me that this restaurant is a labor of love.

Master Crenn leads guests down enchanted wooded paths of sense and savor, reconnecting us to our origins in earth and time. The food serves as catalyst, like the grain of sand in the oyster, for the pearl of connection to one another and our food system. \n\nIt is easy to get caught up in the hype of a world class chef, who has won Iron Chef and whose visage adorns the pages of the glamor magazines, yet Crenn takes us away from all of that as well. From the moment crossing the threshold into her modest Atelier or \"studio\", the energy of the team is that of a family of highly focused and committed professionals intent on serving up the magic with genuine kindness. \n\nThe experience takes you from one enchanted garden to next with great care given to the transitions. The palate cleanser before the main course was as far as I could tell a tiny cloud offering a mere whisper of flavor to reset the taste buds' expectations before something new to come. \n\nI cannot recall the last time I experienced new flavors or sensations. This is what is remarkable about \"the Crenn Experience\"--part theater, part culinary genius, much magic and mastery all packaged with the utmost of care and warmth, feeding stomach and soul.", "author": "Murat A."}

For whatever reason, I expect a much more traditional place, but Atelier Crenn did a great job of blending \"fresh-local-seasonal\" with molecular techniques in a recognizable French menu.\n\nWe sat in the back room and watched the sky change colors with the sunset - it was a lot more mellow than the front room.  Some highlights:\n - pate with alfalfa sprouts showed me what pairs with alfalfa sprouts\n - the kir Breton ball was solid molecular amuse bouche stuff\n - sous-vide prawn was perfectly cooked - soft texturally but not the same as raw shrimp.  Served on a warm stone\n - simple carrots/beets/turnip salad all kinds of neat condiments\n - sous-vide salmon was amazing....perfectly soft.  Like the shrimp, better than raw.  The uni-carrot dressing was more carrot than uni\n\nStill, the desserts were truly amazing.  We had a palate cleanser of a Douglas fir sorbet.  It was served on an actual branch of douglas fir, and you ate the sorbet off of it.  The branch was covered in natural oils, so holding it intensified the aroma.  It came in a dry-ice metal container with more of the natural oils spilling out in the steam.  Wow...it really was amazing.\n\nThe carrot cake dessert was carrot cake rolled up and then surrounded by a \"carrot\" made of a paste made of carrots formed in the shape of a carrot.  Wow!  The pastry chef explained it all...seemed like a good guy.\n\nThe petit-fours were all kinds of flavors served in a stone tray with a little bonsai tree.  The pastry chef takes care of these himself.\n\nFor $95, it really was worth it.  It seemed a lot more relaxed and real than Benu and Coi.  I just really liked it.", "author": "Craig T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-11", "description": "I hope this review can do justice to the mind blowing experience we had at Atelier Crenn.  Rarely in my life have I had the good fortune to experience what can only be described as a profoundly virtuosic performance.  The cuisine is multi-faceted, working on so many levels that I find myself comparing it to the best concerts, operas, plays, dances, and art works that I've seen.  This all may seem too much, but when an experience keeps you up at night thinking about, dissecting it's every morsel and when you do fall asleep it's what you dream about, the feeling must be authentic.\n\nAfter moving recently to San Francisco from Paris, I was extremely disappointed with what passed for haute cuisine.  Atelier Crenn has renewed my faith in the Bay Area.  What truly sets Atelier Crenn apart is how every element (texture, visual aesthetic, aroma) works together to build something greater than the whole.  \n\nI've never encountered a cuisine that fully realizes the potential for smell and taste to unlock memories and transport you to another place.  Most of the dishes we had actually did this and those that didn't were still absolutely divine.  The micro vegetables with snow gives the feeling of walking through a snowy meadow, snow crunching underfoot with the brisk air bracing the skin.  The interpretation of the sea communicates the lusciousness of salty-sweet air one encounters by the ocean in the morning.  The coconut dessert is snow blowing over the landscaping forming snow drifts in a serenely delicate manner.\n\nIf you go to Atelier Crenn, the tasting menu is a must and let the experience take you away.  After the 9? courses, I felt energized and satisfied.  I don't think the criticisms on portion size are justified.  The dishes are clearly created the way they are for maximum impact.  Larger sizes would alter the balance achieved and dull the experience.  Also, there isn't one iota of pretentiousness here.  It's as authentic an haute cuisine as I've ever encountered.  It looks you in the eyes without blinking.  It is confidence and creative genius on a plate.", "author": "Wesley S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-04", "description": "Mlle. Proust in Cow Hollow - Atelier Crenn - San Francisco\n\n Often young chefs find a horsey-style and ride it, but not so Dominique Crenn who is working with flair to harness her own vision. She has been in the industry for some 23 years, and perhaps \"young\" is a matter less of chronology than the fact that she only reached wide gastronomic notice in 2008 when she became chef at San Francisco's Luce, received a Michelin star, and was named Esquire's chef of the year. She has since triumphed on Iron Chef, which might or might not testify to her vision, but certainly to her culinary chops.\n\n The menu includes a moving (and somewhat ambiguous) letter to her father, talking about pain and sun, surf and sweat. As with so much poetry, readers have much to read in, but one can hardly imagine a male chef making the claim that his cuisine is such a personal and private expression, a way of reliving the past, whether troubled or happy. \n\n Ultimately reviews are about the food. Critics are often asked, reasonably, how good was it? Asking that of Crenn is a bit like asking that of, say, Eva Hesse or Robert Rauschenberg: they don't easily fit on a 30-point scale. They are important artists with a vision that might or might not appeal and techniques that might or might not be proficient. The most obvious limitation of Crenn (and for that matter Rauschenberg) is that her dishes are not noted for their precision. If you admire Thomas Keller's perfection on a plate, this falls short of that standard. Perhaps Crenn doesn't have the staff, but I think she doesn't have the desire. Memory doesn't work like that. She is attempting to produce remembrance and reverie. Whether she succeeds is as much a function of the diner as of the cook.\n\n We began with a quite lovely and evocative amuse: a spoonful of freeze-dried split pea soup, a bloody-dried beet \"kiss,\" an intense bit of fungal broth, and an non-edible boulder. It was quite a stunning composition: possibly Freudian, but perhaps freeze-dried split pea soup is simply freeze-dried split pea soup. The consomm\u00e9 was properly intense, the beet was deeply flavored - a root with a zing. The bright freeze dried pea soup didn't wow my tongue. The crumbly texture added little to the enjoyment of the flavor, but distracted a bit.\n\n My opening course (diners can choose any three dishes from the savory portion of the menu) was a \"Walk in the Forest,\" a composition of textures and aromas of the wild. I imagined that it was going to be similar to David Kinch's iconic \"Into the Vegetable Garden\" salad, a bowl of local surprises. It wasn't quite. The plate was coated with a pine paste (a surprisingly sticky and sweet paste, more keeping with dessert), covered with various forms of mushrooms, the raw and the cooked and the pickled: a delicious black trumpet mushroom paper, picked and pickled morels, champignons, added were hazelnuts, chestnuts, tiny lettuces, toasted pumpernickel, and sorrel oil. I was glad to have selected the dish and I surely will remember it, but I don't quite know what to make of it. As a culinary matter, it was somewhat too sweet and too pickled (Crenn seems to enjoy the tang of pickling). The plate was remarkably creative as an idea, and just a bit off as culinary practice.\n\n My second plate was poetically entitled, \"The Sea, An Interpretation of Aquatic Flavors: Mussels, Oysters, and Arctic Char.\" As I have previously suggested, the modernist style of dessert is to present the diner with a mix of preparations. The Sea, not so sweet as the previous dish, had this same decentered quality. Crenn prepared abalone, smoked oyster, char, mussels, squid ink meringue, and dehydrated lemon foam. It was quite charming in its ingredients and preparations and beautiful in its presentation. However, not having lived Crenn's life, I wondered about the poetic imagery of the dehydrated foam. What might it signify? Still, it was a very worthy dish: a collection of satisfactions.\n\n My main protein was more standard: Duck with crispy skin, spring garlic, strawberry, rhubarb and smoked buckwheat. Crenn's duck was exuberant. It was an excellent use of big protein. I particularly admired how she sprinkled toasted buckwheat on the plate as if buckwheat was salt. Crenn's duck was a special preparation, well within the modernist canon.\n\nFinally dessert (from pastry chef Juan Contreras) was a witty trompe l'oeil: a carrot cake with spring pea cream. The joke was that the cake was within the hunky frosted \"carrot\" with tiny carrots and frozen peas as accompaniments. Perhaps the cake itself tasted no better than a routine carrot cake and the cream was more clever than wondrous, but still it was a pleasurable ending to a most distinctive meal. \n\nWhen a chef is still at work in the kitchen and the ideas are bubbling and bouncing, Atelier Crenn stands a good chance of being a better restaurant in December than it was in June. Even now it is a restaurant that is always thought-provoking and vibrant.", "author": "Gary F."}

Dishes I love the most are the oyster with seaweeds, foie gras log, and the green multi-layered palate cleanser. Now the portions are not that tiny. My son couldn't finish the olive ice-cream because he's too full!\nOverall a truly wonderful meal. To be nitpicky I would say the only dish that I don't care much about is the avocado and popcorn.", "author": "Steven L."}

I will admit there were a couple dishes that flavor wise didn't hit home with me but it's really hard to pitch a 13 course perfect game with anyone's palette. I wish I could sit and describe the flavors and textures I experienced here but I simply can't.  It's much like seeing a great stand up comic. You laugh your ass of the whole show and when someone asks you for a joke they told you can't recite it and do it justice.  The same goes for a meal at a great restaurant.  Aside from the meal the staff is just as precise and amazingly nice and personable. I always fear pretentiousness when going to high end restaurants and that certainly didn't happen here. Being able to watch chef Crenn work from the dining room was a fun treat for my friends who were huge fans. Having her come out and greet us was even better for them even though we got star struck and didn't have the balls to ask for a picture.  As typical for menus like the one at Atelier Crenn it's not cheap and not for everyone but if you like this style of dining and have the pockets for it it's something that should not be missed.  I certainly plan on going again to try the non grand version of the menu.  Thank you Chef Crenn and staff for an amazing night.", "author": "Joco F."}

We just ate there for our second time, and all I can say is that I was blown away by the experience.  What was even more impressive is that the food has gotten even better and more creative since our last visit over two months ago. The service was outstanding, and the tasting menu, with the wine pairings could not have been any better.  The price, while high, was entirely reasonable for this quality of experience.\n\nOn this visit we brought a relative who was visiting us from New York, and his comment to us was that if the restaurant was located in New York it would be impossible to get a reservation for two months.  We are so fortunate to have this gem of a restaurant right in our own back yard.\n\nLet me add that over the last 20 years, my wife and I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world.  While some of them have lived up to what the critics said, others were huge disappointments.  Not only did Atelier Crenn live up to the comments we have heard from others, it far exceeded them.  \n\nAs a sidelight, what I found really amusing was that after our meal, my wife asked me if I had read the review of a food critic who writes for a San Francisco newspaper who gave a very positive, but not a glowing review to Atelier Crenn.  When she mentioned his name, I smiled, and reminded her that that was the same guy who had sent us to a score of disappointing restaurants for several years until I finally gave up reading his reviews and made my decisions after reading postings on Open Table and Yelp.  One great thing about the internet is that we can all make intelligent decisions ourselves on where to eat, without relying on the personal and sometimes very wrong impressions of a single reviewer.", "author": "B.

I was expecting more and even better at her new Atelier however I was disappointed.  At this price range, diners can and should expect the best and while this place is very good, its not at the level the pricing or the expectations set.  The portions are small and the ingredients seem to be the \"lower cost\" parts of the animal.  For example,one of my dishes was a very fatty and poorly executed lamb's neck.  The table next to us purchased a white truffle enhancement to their meal but they complained that the truffle was not up to snuff (literally didnt smell of truffle or of anything for that matter) and didnt taste good either.

Honestly, after reviewing the beautiful pictures of entrees, I was concerned about the taste of the food and whether or not I'd be running for a side order of fries after the meal.  However, everything was wonderfully seasoned and the interplay of textures was memorable.  We appreciated the whimsical dishes of grains and seeds, walk in the forest, and betterave.  I had the wine pairing and we also ordered a cheese tasting.  In the end, we are artistically and gastronomically satiated.  The service was excellent; our waitress was informative and patient with our questions.  We loved the modern and organic decor of the space.

When we showed up around 7:20 the restaurant was surprisingly empty, but filled up over the course of the evening. \n\nThe decor is what I'd call modern rustic, carefully engineered to appear carefree. It creates an ambiance at odds with the Marina crowd stumbling to and from the Matrix next door.\n\nOur server was friendly, informative and clearly excited about describing the inventive menu. With his guidance my wife and I chose the following dishes:\n- Potato: cooked in the soil from whence it came and arriving in tasty Hot Ham Water (as good as anything Lindsay Bluth ever made). A must.\n- Abalone: Fresh and paired nicely with a Pamplemousse sorbet, but a little bland in terms of flavor (to be fair, I was very jealous of my wife's cheesy and hammy potato).\n- Sweetbread: The presentation was basic, but the marrow was stupendous. Something you'll either love or hate.\n- Pigeon (but really squab): Baked with sea salt and served with liver it's another dish that will divide. I enjoyed the juiciness and texture while my wife disliked the rareness of the squab and the entirety of its liver (yay, more for me!).\n- Lamb Neck: While lamb is common in the city you rarely see a dish made from its neck, and that's a shame. The meat was very tender and flavorful with excellent sides to enhance the core entr\u00e9e.\n- Cheese: The double cream was amazing, and the others were good but not extraordinary.\n- Dessert: The Coconut dessert was an amazingly smooth way to end the evening, while the Winter Porridge was creative but less enticing to me.\n\nAtelier Crenn has great potential, and I look forward to seeing and tasting what local yet exotic ingredients Chef Crenn will incorporate into her cuisine next.", "author": "Max G."}

I felt like $150 seemed like a major markup on the wine pairing selections (ie.e., we didn't really get any major premium wines from my perspective, in hindsight I would have rather gotten a bottle of white and red) but that's really more of a nit-pick than anything else.\n\nIn terms of service, this really felt more like 2 stars.  I get the whole relaxed pacing of the meal particularly in French restaurants (and have eaten at enough of them in France and here in the US to understand and enjoy this), and it sounds like many reviewers didn't have a problem with the pace, but from our perspective, the timing of our courses was a bit uncomfortably slow.  There were several 20+ minute pauses between courses, and several of the courses took 10 minutes or so for the various constituent parts to show up.  On one of the pauses, the waiter was kind enough to apologize and pour us more wine, which we appreciated, but we were left feeling like perhaps the issue was that the kitchen wasn't fully staffed rather than it being a conscious effort to parcel out the meal.  Our expectations are somewhat high on service (based on other tasting menu and fine dining experiences in SF, particularly at this price point) but it unfortunately ended up marring the beauty and experience of the meal from our perspective.\n\nAll in all, I think I'd echo what I read from some of other reviewers here -- it's definitely worth a try, the food is very good (particularly if you love molecular gastronomy), but make sure you don't come hungry given the pace of service.  From our perspective, we're glad to have tried it, but probably won't make it a destination in the future.", "author": "Jay P."}

Honestly if you have a big appetite, even the grand tasting menu won't fill you up.  We came to this meal as vegetarians, and its a very intimate setting, so you can hear all of the tables around you clearly, and I  loved that they accommodated a ton of requests to customize the meal to preference around us -- dairy free, gluten free, pescatarian, ovo-lacto vegetarian etc...  Japanese/french fusion, and I felt they did not take the veg version very Japanese.  Personally has become one of my favorite vegetarian places second only to Ubuntu(which was also very modern technique inspired) and which sadly is not open anymore.  Manresa did an uninspired and bland vegetarian menu for me and I will never go back, and I have to say that not one of the 20 odd tastes was bland and uninspiring here.  The french onion soup alone was worth the price of admission and the mushrooms were pitch perfect.  Our waiter did not generally bother to tell us which line of the poem was what course, got to inadvertently listen in to neighbouring experiences to find out.  We may not go back too often as just a couple because close to 4 hours is a long time to talk to just one person:-) Would be great for a group.  On Decor:  I was comfortable on the well upholstered bench, but my husband was squirming after an hour or so on his very modern and too compact chair (he's just 6') .  But he said that the pitch perfect flavors would keep him coming back. Compared to the Plumed horse or Manresa, you feel jammed up against other diners so not really an intimate setting.  Like I said earlier, you can hear and see diners even two tables away.    I would avoid it if you are truly vegetarian because I noted lots of jellies (gelatin) which is a cornerstone of modern cooking I suppose.  Unless they use agar as a default. Didn't ask since I was not feeling picky.  Sometimes modern cooking can feel gimicky but I felt that she let each taste shine through with perfect counterpoints.  French onion soup is a favorite of ours and we have tasted and cooked countless versions and not one had the purity and intensity of flavor we tasted here.  You could say the same about a 2 or three other courses too, and I think that is certainly the hallmark of a great chef.", "author": "Sudha N."}

The restaurant is small and cozy. I like how they have closed off the windows since it is in a very busy area and I think that the street traffic would be very distracting. \n\nWe decided to go with the 4 course prix fixe menu. We started with the new potato and the 'walk in the forest' (wild mushrooms). Both were delicious and of course as everyone has said - quite beautiful as well. I ordered the broken avocado which was good but not very special in flavor. For our mains, I ordered the duck which was amazing. Several parts of the duck were prepared and all were delicious. My friend had the pork which like the duck was served in a variety of ways - all very satisfying. We ordered the cheese tasting which you may need to let them know how many orders since we both picked the cheese they apparently served us 2 portions when we only wanted one. Needless to say, none of it went to waste! It is served with some nice finely sliced bread (2 kinds) and some delicious raw honey. For dessert, I ordered the peach selection and my friend ordered the chocolate. My friend won on this order. The chocolate dessert came out looking like a mini forest on the plate. This dessert was very special in execution, flavor and presentation. All in all, a very well executed meal and we were both quite impressed and satisfied! Not always the case with elevated food. The meal did take 3 hours as most have said but we thought it was well paced. The only thing that I would suggest is for them to add some beverages for anyone not drinking alcohol.

The food itself is nothing short of amazing, and Chef Crenn deserves recognition for such creative poetic dishes.  That said, the service lacked certainty, attention, and detail, not to mention promptness - unacceptable at this price.  What should have taken 2 or maybe 3 hours took over 4, drawn out by unnecessarily long intermissions between courses with missed queues by the staff.  The decor is stark, the lighting is harsh, and while the stained concrete floors look beautiful, they reflect noise - consequently the atmosphere is louder than it should be.  My biggest gripe was that I left hungry...  each plate of the tasting menu was the size of an amuse-bouche - fine early on in the line-up, but insulting for the main.

We did the 4 course tasting menu with the wine pairing and the cheese add-on.  First course was hands down the best for me, I had the Goat Cheese and Tomato salad.  Then the walk in the forest was unique but not amazing, I actually got tired of it after the first bite.  My third course, I went with the Guinea Hen.  It was kind of dry and very bland.  To only have three choices consisting of Fish, Goat and Guinea Hen, I was hoping it would be stellar.   The cheese selection was nice and they were all excellent.  Then dessert for me was the Black Cherry, as far as chocolate cake goes, I was let down.  The wines were decent but once again nothing that made me say amazing.  For the price, I would for sure try other places out first.  My experiences at La Folie, though not as uber foodie trendie, the flavor and quality have been much better.", "author": "Brooke K."}

We've been fans since Luce and we are so happy she now has her own canvas on which to create. The staff was young and attractive, their welcome warm and sincere. Similarly, the millieu and mis en scene were tasteful, not too much, not too little, not too cool, not too precocious. There was a definite vibe going on and it was refreshing. Conscious of high intentions but not self conscious of anything. Considering the place opened just a few months ago, this staging was quite well done. The auteur came to say hello before the amuse bouche, which was the most substantial amuse I've ever encountered. Four-five different demi-tastes served as primary washes for the work that would follow. We had ordered the five course menu and it was a good choice to review the oeuvre. They are, as rumored, \"high concept\" plates, presented in stark relief on cinder slates. Each course has a zen-like conciseness built into it, but by themselves together, they are perfectly satisfying and fulfilling. I had had a wonderful potato dish at Alain Ducasse in Paris which I thought was the most wonderful potato I had ever had. Hers comes close, and that is a high standard. You see each plate and the constituent ingredients don't telegraph a lot of gastronomic anticipation by their looks (\"soil\" is merely a cheeky metaphor). Then you taste it and are immediately taken aback by the simplicity and utter purity of the organic matter your waiter had announced were actually in the dish. You wonder and you contemplate and you savor as if this were the first time you ate. Dessert was a fitting coda, refreshing and reflecting on what passed. Service was applied lightly yet attentively. Explanations of the owner's intent freely given, easily understood. Not aloof or elitist in the least. But cordial, informed, effortless. Crenn, the realisatrice and star, has found the right supporting cast members who know their role. But I glean a bit of dinner theater going on here as well. It's as if at Atelier Crenn, you, the diner, are both enthralled audience and giddy co-conspirator driving forward an intriguing culinary plot. It ends spectacularly well.", "author": "Terence P."}

When we arrived, noone was there to greet us and there was a line of 6 people waiting for the hostess. Finally she arrived and eventually ushered us to the \"garden\" room which is usually reserved for private parties but was used as an extra room the night we were there. The room is OK, didn't love the fake plants and the lighting isn't great. Again the decor is very sparse, not very inviting but on to the food... We got the tasting menu with its 10 courses (w/cheese course) and ordered a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape. Of the 10 courses, a few really stood out for us, Crenn's take on kir Breton was a nice and fun start to the meal, her Maitake (mushroom) appetizer and Jardin d'Hiver were delicious. Our absolutely favorite part was her fresh foie gras, she brines it, then cooks it sous-vide, freezes it and then pan-fries it so it's crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, it is then topped with mini meringues! Absolutely perfect! What worked less well was her fish gnocci dish and her lamb neck which definitely need more work. The cheese course and dessert were exquisite. So overall, there were some amazing dishes and some pretty disappointing ones but the most disappointing thing was service, each course took a VERY long time to arrive (we were there for 4 hours!), the waiters seemed confused and disorganized, we were given sparkling water twice even though we asked for still all along, we got other people's dishes  and were offered the same thing twice (it was for someone else). But, I think that after working-out the kinks, this place could be great, we certainly had a good time and loved talking to Chef Crenn at the end of our meal. She is very artistic and imaginative. It was a pleasure to meet her.", "author": "Celine C."}
