As others have said, there doesn't seem to be an organized reservation or seating system. I'm pretty sure the hostess forgot about us and seated several parties before us on accident... probably because she was doing 3 jobs at once though. Luckily, we weren't in a rush. Once we sat down, everything else was slow as well. Slow to order, slow to get the check. Just slow. I guess it's a reminder to slow down or whatever, but I think it's because they only had like... 3 people on the floor (hosting, waiting tables, bussing), and the restaurant was packed.\n\n2. These complaints aside, the food was BOMB. OH MY GOD. Heavenly. We didn't expect it at all. We were just on a little hike / walk up Bernal and looking for a warm place to eat. I had never heard of Vega, but all the seats were filled (surprising for a Tuesday night), so we naturally gravitated toward the restaurant that everyone else seemed to like despite there being other places to eat on that street. We ordered the gnocchi pasta and a pizza (don't remember which one), but I was so blown away. It reminds me of my favourite Italian restaurant in Russian Hill (Ristorante Milano) - just cozy and homey, and feels like Italy. Next time, I'm definitely ordering wine to go along with it.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Top recommendation from a co-worker who used to live nearby and is in love with all of the pasta here. We had a nice family dinner here, and while my gnocchi was stupendous, my partner's pappardelle was extremely undercooked. \n\nRESERVATIONS: Made online (group of 5, Saturday at 5:30pm) just a few days in advance. \n\nSERVICE: Genuine, friendly, and patient. Half our group was about 40 minutes late for our reservation, and that was no issue for them!\n\nTHE COST: $190.75 before tips for dinner for five. Not bad!\n\nTHE FOOD:\n\nINSALATE\n* Insalata Della Casa ($10) - 3.5 stars\nTried a bite, this was fine, nothing super exciting but works if you need a salad.\n\nPRIMI PIATTI\n* Rigatoni ($17 + $3 sausage) - 4 stars\nI tried a bite, this was good! Definitely a big, hearty dish if you're super hungry as well. Meat was great (italian style - nicely ground meat), and plenty of baked cheese on top.\n\n* Gnocchi Della Casa ($17) - 5 stars\nSoft & heavenly. I couldn't decide between the sauces & was able to get half Tomato Basil, half Gorgonzola & Fontina. Both were fantastic! (Though looking now at the receipt, I realize I was charged $2 for that. Not a big deal, but I wish they would've mentioned something!)\n\n* Papardelle Al Ragu Di Cinghiale ($19) - 2.5 stars\nExtremely undercooked. No, not al dente - my partner and I know how to appreciate al dente. This was objectively too hard and not cooked long enough. Maybe it was an off day, but he couldn't finish this!\n\nSECONDI PIATTI\n* Costolette Di Agnello (lamb chops $24) - 4.5 stars\nVery nicely cooked lamb, tender and soft, juicy, and plenty of wonderful flavor.", "author": "Ziyan C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-05", "description": "I am so glad one of our friend introduced us to this place because they wanted to enjoy the  1/2 priced bottled wine on Wednesdays (yes, that's right, instead of wing Wednesday, it's wine Wednesday and who could say no to wine). This is one of my favorite Italian places in SF and it's not because of the wine Wednesday, although it is a great incentive. I have been here so many times after our friend introduced it to us, I definitely lost count of how many times I have been here but the last time I was here was about a couple of days ago for dinner.\n\nMy best friend came to visit and her favorite cuisine is Italian, so I had to take her to one of my favorite place in town. We decided to order a pizza for the table and our own pasta dishes on top of that. Though it is carbs on carbs, we have no regret. I really like their pizza here because I'm a fan of thin pizza so that it comes out lighter and crispier and this place is one of my favorite to get pizza because they do just that. For the table, we went with Pizza Ai Funghi which is essentially mushroom pizza with truffle oil (because anything with truffle is always amazing). The pizza came out very thin and crispy just as I like it and the mushroom portion was generous. If you wanted parmesan cheese on top of any of your dishes, they will bring out a block and a very long grater and grate your cheese in front of you (drools). The pizza was gone within 5 minutes.\n\nFor the pasta dishes, our table got Boscaiola, Capellini Al Granchio and Linguine Al Nero Di Seppia E Calamari. The Boscaiola is handmade gnocchi with mushroom, Italian sausage, parmigiana and white truffle oil. Not only was the flavor amazing but their gnocchi was really good and fresh. It was not my dish but I definitely was eating a lot of it (sorry to my friend that I stole the gnocchi from). The Capellini Al Granchio is my all-time favorite and my highly recommended dish here. It is angel hair pasta with fresh Dungeness crabmeat, tomatoes, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. The portion is big and there is enough Dungeness crabmeat that I had a piece at every bite. I really like how light this dish sits in my stomach but it is packed with flavor. On top of that, angel hair is a pasta that can overcook or undercook easily due to how thin it is but it is always cooked perfectly here. My second highly recommended dish here is the Linguine Al Nero Di Seppia E Calamari, which essentially is squid ink linguine with calamari, garlic and parsley. The pasta is cooked perfectly and flavor is amazing. If you haven't had squid ink anything, I highly recommend it (unless of course if you're allergic to it).\n\nThough we didn't order it during this dinner, I would recommend the Polpette E Polenta as well because the meatballs are amazing. Overall, I definitely highly recommend this place. The pizzas are great and the pasta is amazing as well. The place is small so try to either make reservations or go early and if you're into wine, go for wine Wednesday!\n\nTLDR: One of the best Italian place with amazing food and  1/2 priced bottle wine on Wednesday.\n\nAtmosphere: 4 out of 5 (intimate but it can get a bit loud)\nFood: 5 out of 5\nService: 5 out of 5\nPresentation: 4 out of 5", "author": "Chenny O."}

I took a friend here for his birthday and we were both amazed by the quality of the food & the fast service. The squid ink pasta was a hit! I would come back for that dish alone. The carbonara was delicious but I could do more than one serving of the squid ink pasta. The noodles were al dente and perfectly cooked, the sauce was rich but light, the seafood in the pasta was tender and delightful. We had the flourless cake and tiramisu to finish. I'd skip the flourless cake was too dense for our liking but that doesn't take away from how wonderful our experience was at this restaurant. I'd definitely recommend it.

There are big windows that allow you to take a look inside and get a feel for that super relaxed, romantic atmosphere that you'll experience. The place is really small, tables are very close to each other, and it's fairly dark inside. This makes it perfect for a basic and simple date night. The service is on point and super friendly. They have a good wine list with mostly bold Italian wines. As I know nothing about Italian wines, I just picked any but the waitress was nice enough to tell me that this was the only wine on the list that she wouldn't get herself ever.\n\nBesides that, the food is amazing. They have a good mix of meat, seafood and vegetarian options. As everyone else is saying, these GNOCCHI are amazing. You can taste the potato but it's not overpowering, they are cooked al dente but not too hard - and that sauce they come in is so on point. Besides that, the Pizza is amazing too - very traditional Italian pizza.\n\nI walked out of this place feeling so happy and relaxed, and not too full of heavy food to go to the bar next door.", "author": "Jonas G."}

Our group of three arrived at the restaurant and then were squeezed into a tiny table barely big enough for two.  When we asked the waiter about this, he just shrugged and said \"it's Friday\".  A few minutes later, we see a 4 top opening up and we ask the waier if we can be moved to that table so we fit.  He says he'll check with the manager.  Time goes by.  Another waitress comes by and we now ask her if we can be moved to that table. She says she'll let us know.  We sit for a while.  We look around and notice that 3 of the occupied 4 tops only have 2 people, so there should be no reason they couldn't let us move to the open 4 top.   More time goes by.  They seat some people at the 4 top we had asked about.  More time goes by and they seat several other parties, completely ignoring us.  By this point it is 25 minutes past our reservation and we had been sitting there hungry, just waiting the whole time.  Finally we give up and leave.  Unbelievable how horrible the customer service is!! I get it that things get busy, and I would totally be OK with it if they were at least trying their best, but it seems like you could accommodate a reservation within 25 minutes, especially if you are seating party after party after party.  Especially infuriating since they were not even apologetic about it and completely ignored us.", "author": "vlad k."}

I love being wined and dined, so obviously I was already in a super chipper mood. The experience at Vega was great and helped make the night perfect; the waitress was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was delicious all around. Even my boyfriend who doesn't usually care for Italian food said that he is now much more open to Italian cuisine (since he enjoyed the food a lot!)\n\nThe space is very intimate and small... Because of the small space, reservations are limited and seemed to be booked back-to-back as much as possible. We had to wait a little bit even though we had a reservation... But I really liked that they offered us the wine menu to glance over/order from while we were waiting. I had my glass of fancy smancy wine before we were even seated! \n\nOnce we were seated, they gave us our menus and then brought out a cute little plate of heart shaped bread + olive oil(?), which was basically bottomless as it usually is at Italian restaurants. I had been craving/eating carbs all week so of course I helped myself to a shameless amount of bread while we waited for our food. We ordered an appetizer (polpette e polenta) which was beef meatballs and roasted polenta to share, and an entree each -- he thought that I might like the dungeness crab pasta dish made with real dungeness crab meat, so he suggested that I get the capellini al granchio (delicious, by the way..) while he himself got the gnocchi alla boscaiola (also delicious!!!) \n\nOur waitress checked up on us a couple of times and someone came by to fill our water cups, so service was very attentive, we were in and out of the place in about an hour with only a little bit of leftovers. On the way out, we saw several tables who went with the pizza options and many of them looked mouth-watering..

So after considering our options we agreed on italian. We were already in the Mission district, and didn't feel like driving for too long so we decided to head to Emmy's. I am SO GLAD we couldn't find any parking because basically that is the reason why we kept driving toward Bernal Heights. Oh boy! What a lovely surprise. Super cute, little place. It was busy!! I thought we were not gonna be able to get a table but, we got lucky and were seated on a corner by the window which we loved!! Everything from start to finish was delicious! The service super friendly and attentive. First we got their super delicious bread made in house along with some tasty, tasty olive oil. Then we got their Caesar salad... THE BEST Caesar salad I've ever had. The dressing is not your typical creamy dressing, oh no... it's this delicious emulsion of oil, and lemon, and anchovies topped with the yummiest shaved parm. My God! You can taste every element on every-single-bite. Sooo good... Hubby had their wild boar papardelle and I had the spaghetti alla puttanesca. Both of them so well prepared and flavored. Of course, we also got dessert. I am a pastry chef, so I am hard to impress when it comes to desserts. Thumbs up for their tiramisu! Perfection. Right amount of espresso, right amount of sweetness.

The menu was devoid of dishes like lasagna, chicken parmesan and other Americanized Italian dishes. Instead, we were greeted with a choice of homemade linguines, gnocchi and orecchiette to name a few. \n\nI personally had the Linguine Ai Frutti di Mare (which seems to be seasonal or a special since I don't see it on their regular menu). Either way, it was absolutely fantastic! The pasta was clearly handmade and had just the right amount of bite. The seafood included was decently generous and the sauce was just the right balance of garlicky, slight heat and sweetness from the wine. (4.5/5)\n\nI also managed to snag a bite of the Gnochhi Alla Boscaiola and my taste buds nearly exploded. The gnocchi was clearly made in-house as they were fluffy, billowy and buttery puffs of potato-goodness. The sausage and truffle oil provided an amazing richness and depth that's hard to describe without just tasting it. The portion doesn't look large but it's a rich dish and I could see it being very filling. (4.5/5)\n\nIf I'm ever in the area, I'll be back to try every other item on this menu.

Cortland Street was a wasteland on Columbus Day; everything was closed, even the corner markets. Vega was the only place open that wasn't a bar. We walked in, said we were in a hurry, and asked how long it would take to order a small pizza to go. The waitress said \"15 minutes.\" I said great, placed my order, paid for it. (The time stamp on my receipt said 6:18.)\n\nAfter 20 minutes, my pizza was nowhere in sight, and at almost 6:40, I asked where it was. The waitress languidly replied \"it's gonna be 10 more minutes.\" What? I replied that was NOT acceptable - we had to be somewhere at 6:45, and she had told us it would only take 15 minutes. The waitress didn't seem to care, so I called over the owner, a man with a thick foreign accent, who also didn't care that we were in a hurry and had been lied to about the wait time. In fact, he seemed annoyed that we were even asking. \n\nWhen the pizza finally came up at 6:47, it sat in the service window for 3 entire minutes before anyone bothered to box it up and hand it to us! Needless to say, we were very late to our event.\n\n...But the real reason I am leaving a negative review (instead of just enjoying my pizza and letting it go) is because when the owner finally handed us our pizza at 6:50, instead of apologizing for the wait, or for misleading us about how long it would take, he raised his voice and berated my husband for my \"impatience\"!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-16", "description": "Girls Night Out (GNO). \n\nIn my 20s, GNO meant getting tipsy, making googly eyes with the guy across the bar who looks cute...after 7 shots; then trying to walk over to him but toppling over because I walk in heels like a baby giraffe in roller skates...after 7 shots.\n\nNow that I'm in my 30s, GNO means enjoying a carblicious meal with a glass of wine while gossiping about how long our significant other lasts in bed. Just kidding, fellas!\n\nFor a last minute GNO, I suggested going to Vega for dinner because I had a solid meal on my first visit and parking is plentiful. Vega is not a destination restaurant by any means but if you're in the area and looking for a simple, tasty, and satisfying Italian meal than look no further than Vega. The portions are generous and prices are reasonable. On Tuesdays, kid's pizzas are 50% off and on Wednesdays, bottles of wine are 50% off.\n\nOn my two visits, I've tried the following (sorry for the poor quality pics):\n*Carpaccio di Polipo: Octopus carpaccio ($10): http://bit.ly/1uR2I8T\n*Tortino di Granchio: Dungeness crab w/ avocado, cucumber & endive ($14): http://bit.ly/Zo3r7B\n*Impepata Di Vongole E Cozze: Mussels w/ garlic, chili flakes, parsley & white wine ($12): http://bit.ly/1qYU1J1\n*Quattro Formaggi Pizza: Mozzarella, fontina, goat cheese, gorgonzola, & pear ($15 + $4 for prosciutto & egg): http://bit.ly/1oVs6GJ\n*Pizza Capricciosa: Homemade tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, artichoke, mushrooms & egg  ($15): http://bit.ly/XcfdAi\n*Pappardelle Al Ragu: Papparadelle w/ beef, pork & lamb ($18): http://bit.ly/1mb4MZz\n*Costolette Di Agnello: Rack of lamb w/ roasted polenta & white truffle oil ($22): http://bit.ly/1mb4WjG\n*Panna Cotta & Vanilla Gelato ($8 + $3): http://bit.ly/1s50qWx\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of their seafood apps. They're fresh and chock full of seafood goodness. My favorite is the mussels in the white wine broth. The broth is robust with a nice kick; it was an addicting dip for the grilled bread. \n\nI enjoyed the thin crust pizza on my first visit (quattro formaggi). It was crispy throughout with a perfectly cooked egg that oozed upon poking. I didn't have the same luck with the pizza capricciosa on my second visit. The middle was soggy upon arrival and the egg had a fully cooked yolk. *sad pouty lip* \n\nIf you have value on your mind, then I would opt for Vega's pastas over their pizzas. The portions are HUGE. My papparadelle could easy feed 2 hungry people. The sheets of pasta were perfectly al-dente and lightly tossed in a flavorful, thick ragu sauce. Really liked the trio of meats; the lamb added a subtle gamey bite. Rustic and comforting. \n\nI had a taste of the tender rack of lamb (medium rare) which was meaty, juicy, and downright delicious. It was a special of the night (first visit) and I would highly recommend this dish if it's available and if you're feeling like a carniwhore that night.\n\nIf you still have room in your tummy, then the panna cotta is a great way to end dinner. It's firm yet lightly smooth with a refreshing hint of lemon.\n\nService is everything you would expect from a good neighborhood restaurant: warm, friendly, and attentive. Much better than what I've experienced at their other restaurants (Liberty Caf\u00e9/Bernal Star).\n\nThe ambiance is dim, a little cramped, and old skool. Great for a casual date but not for parties larger than 4. \n\nFor our GNO party of 4, we shared 2 apps, one pizza, 4 entrees, and each had a glass of wine. The total was only $43 pp including tip plus we each had a doggy bag to bring home. \n\nLeaving with a food baby to go home to comfortably plop on the couch and watch Lifetime Movie Network sure beats nursing a hangover, bruises, and a twisted ankle from toppling over because I walk in heels like a baby giraffe in roller skates...after 7 shots.\n\nHmmm, I wonder how GNO in our 40s will be like...a little Magic Mike action?", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

My friend suggested Vega and it was great choice.\n\nTo start, our party of four decided to go with two appetizers and a pizza to share:\n*Impepata di Vongole e Cozze ($12) - A must order!  The mussels come in a white wine broth.  The chili flakes give it a slight kick.  You'll find yourself asking for more bread to soak up the delicious broth.\n*Tortino di Granchio ($14) - Good & refreshing.  A generous amount of shredded Dungeness crab meat, sliced cucumbers, and avocado slices are placed on top of endive leaves. \n*Pizza Capricciosa ($15) - Sounded good, executed bad.  The pizza was topped with mozzarella, prosciutto, artichoke, mushroom, and egg.  I wish the prosciutto and egg were placed in a more centralized location on the pizza so it could be present on each slice.  My other complaint is that our pizza was soggy and our egg was overcooked and lacked any kind of runniness in the yolk.  \n\nFor my entree, I went with the Gnocchi Alla Boscaiola.  It was delectable and delicious!  The homemade dumplings were tender with a slight chewiness to them.  It was mixed with sausage and mushrooms in a cream sauce.  Truffle oil was added to the dish as the finishing touch. \n\nWHAT TO KNOW:\n*Street parking (some metered)\n*No wait at 6:15pm on a Tuesday\n*Service was attentive and friendly\n*Portion size, a pizza, two appetizers and an entree for each of us was a lot of food.  \n*Dress in layers.

Do NOT come here hungry, the wait can be long and no one will greet you when you arrive. \n\nThe two of us arrived on a Thu evening, hoping to try out this place. It was 8:30ish by the time we arrived, and there were a group of people waiting outside. We were quite confused when we entered the door, hoping to be greeted by a waitress or hostess and tell us what to expect, however, no one showed up or even noticed we were here. My fianc\u00e9 noticed there was a sheet of paper hidden at the counter by the kitchen door, and figured out it would be where he should put the name so he did. There were only 2 more waiting in front of us according to the sheet so we decided to wait it out. \n\nWhilst we were waiting outside, a man from another group told us they called the place before heading down here, and they lived only 2 mins walk from here, were told they'd be seated, but then they had to wait 30 mins and still waiting to be seated... we were already quite hungry... we went in to check a few times and eventually got hold of a waiter who finally seated us. \n\nWith all said, it takes a lot of initiative if you wanna be seated at this place. Don't expect very good service from the beginning. \n\n2. The place is very small and intimate, hence LOUD. \n\nIt's an Italian restaurant in America, so be prepared for some loud talking in this tiny restaurant.

All the waiting made sense eventually. \n\nI'd happily give it a 4 star if ain't for the lousy service at the beginning where we had to figure out all by ourselves, given the price is $$$. \n\nPlease keep up with the good food but also improve your service.

The prices are extremely affordable with each portion order generous enough to share especially if ordering more than one entree.  The quality and taste is superb, noticeable from the first bite. However, unless you're vegan or totally vegetarian, which I am not, next time I will order an appetizer or another entree with the all vegetarian pizza I ordered, though I had them add sausage.  I order a perfectly tossed medley of greens with citrus slices, candied walnuts and thick shaves of parmesano cheese followed by delicate layer of vegetables on Vega's signature thin crispy crust with a high pile of arugula. Had I known there would be a lot of fresh greens on top of the pizza, instead of a salad of greens, an appetizer or entree would have been better. I enjoy fresh raw greens, but confined to a salad or appetizer tray of crudites. However, the choice was my fault, but what I ordered was nicely executed.

When you walk in, you don't feel like you're in a big and busy city. \n\nThey brought out fresh, soft bread, and very sweet and strong olive oil to start. And I ate way too much bread, considering the size of our meal. We shared the pizza with asparagus, smoked pancetta (aka bacon), Carmelites onion, and mounds of parmigiano and mozzarella. It was insanely good, with the perfect crust texture. It was like a breakfast pizza, with wonderful smoky and saltiness from the meat, and sweetness from the onion.\n\nWe also go the rigatoni with meatballs, which even though delicious, I would have been completely fine without, considering the star pizza.", "author": "Joey S."}

Our party of 4 had reservations for 7pm on a Friday night and there were no problems getting seated right away!  It's definitely a cozy place. The tables on our sides were so close, I could almost make out what the other people were talking about.\n\nWe started off with 2 appetizers. The calamari and cannellini beans as well as the mussels. OMG! I could have eaten the mussels as my main entree! The broth was so flavorful. Sadly, we only had 4 pieces of bread with the dish. It would have been nice to have more to soak up the yummy broth.\n\nOur table happened to share small bites of our entr\u00e9e with each other so that we could try everything. \n\nWe ordered:\nBaked Rigatoni, the Gnocchi, the Chicken breast and the pizza Capricciosa.\n\nThe rigatoni was definitely cheesy and hearty. There was so much that even my hubby couldn't finish.\n\nThe gnocchi was soft and pillowy. I loved the Italian sausage.\n\nThe chicken was moist, not dry at all and was a great combination with the prosciutto.\n\nI had a slice of the pizza and surprisingly, it was just ok. (Must have been because I had pizza the other night?)\n\nOverall, the portions are satisfying. If I were to come back, I'd get the either of the appetizers we ordered as my own entr\u00e9e!

Anywho y'all, let me tell you about my evening last night. My newly engaged gal pal Vanessa R and I headed up to Bernal Heights for a little ladies night gab and wine (not whine!) fest. We'd been meaning to get up there for some time, so I finally pulled the trigger and booked via SeatMe which made things quite seemless. \n\nVanessa informed that Bernal is up-and-coming for lesbian / gay couples, so we played into that a bit, as she is very girly with a giant rock on her finger, and I am boisterous and tatted up, good times. (Apologies if anyone is offended by my generalities / stereotyping)\n\n*Half price bottles of wine* is reason enough for me to bus my way to Vega on a Wednesday night. We went with a (regularly $38) bottle of Pinot Bianco and put it in an ice bath to cool me down from my hike up from the bus stop. Our waitress was very friendly and also works down the street at the sister wine bar, VinoRosso, where Vanessa had just tried and they remembered each other, which was nice.\n\nWe shared a salad and a pizza, the Insalata Romana ($9) was big enough for us to share, but the raddicio and arugula combo needs something sweet to break up the bitterness. Might I suggest candied almonds or pecans instead of plain almonds? The Gorgonzola was creamy and delicious, but the salad definitely needs a hint of sugar.\n\nThe Margherita Pizza ($11) was our next dish, and we were a little suprised when we didn't see sliced tomatoes accompanying the basil, but the menu doesn't say anything about sliced tomatoes, so we let by-gone's be by-gones. They do have a delicious tomatoe sauce on the pizza, just not your traditional Margherita pizza. It was good overall, but burned on the bottom, sadly.\n\nSo, why a 4 Star review? Well, for the things already mentioned, also the place was crazy hot inside, like I was sweating in a tank top, and we were seated at arguably the worst table in the place: next to the restroom. At the end of our meal, we both agreed that the times we'd been to Vega in the past were much better. Maybe it was an off night, whatever, we had a nice time together and that's what really matters.

The Carpaccio did Polipo (Thinly sliced octopus, lemon juice, olive oil, arugula   for $10) is a must have. It was just plain excellent. Other incredible dishes were the spaghetti with meatballs, although the dish was light on the meatballs, and the capellini al granchio (handmade capellini with fresh Dungeness crabmeat, tomatoes, olive oil, and parsley) was excellent.

Very happy that we did.\n\nCarciofini Ripieni: Warm Artichoke hearts, stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped with prosciutto on top of pesto and spring greens. Excellent! The artichoke hearts were soft and tender. The prosciutto was seared so it had a bite to it and the pesto/mixed green balance everything out. This is a perfectly satisfying and light appetizer.\n\nGnocchi Alla Boscaiola: Gnocchi with mushrooms, sausages and truffle oil. I am a gnocchi fanatic and had high hopes for this dish. My first bite was just ok. Added  some salt and I was good to go.\n\nPizza Margherita add sausage and 2 eggs: Greatly done pizza! Everything on the pizza was fresh and rich. The dough was thin and had a great crunch. My only complaint is the pizza was slightly warm when it was served. I was expecting something hot and bubbly.\n\nHouse Wine: $5 for glass of good wine.\n\nComplimentary Bread and Olive Oil: Bread was dense, but I think thats the authentic version.\n\nLong wait to get seated. The waiter told us to come back in 30 mins, when we did she had no idea who we were so we had to wait another 15-20 mins for seats to clear up. Once we sat down our order was taken quickly but it took another 40 minutes for our food to come out. We didnt mind the wait so much because we were busy talking, but some people might not be as patient.\n\nWhen we asked for the check they brought out their Panna Cotta desert ON THE HOUSE! I dont expect every establishment to run smoothly all the time, sometimes hiccups happens. I am happy that Vega was able to make up for the unexpected delays by giving us free dessert.\n\nI will definitely be back to Vega's great food, romantic setting and awesome customer service.", "author": "Charisa N."}

I rarely go up Cortland, which is a shame since it is a charming section of Bernal Heights with an almost Mayberry-like allure of small town quaintness. From what I can tell, Vega is quite an upgrade to the previous operation even though it's still a compact place. In fact, Jamie W. and I had to be seated at the only table in the iddy-biddy bar section. I kept getting grazed by the waitstaff as they sped by with dishes to serve in the main dining room. \n\nThe menu offers a solid though predictable selection of items, but the execution is definitely above average. I started with the $10 Insalata Della Casa, a nice spring greens mix with shaved parmigiano and a lot of sweetness - pink grapefruit, pears, candied walnuts - with just a minimum of citrus vinaigrette thrown in, a wise move as I wasn't in the mood for dessert right away (see photo). Jamie went right for the $11 Pizza Margherita, which was nicely turned with a lightly crisp crust, definitely a house specialty (see photo). Our main pasta course was quite tasty twists on basic spaghetti. Jamie ordered the $14 Spaghetti Carbonara, which was not nearly as heavy as I would have expected (see photo).\n\nIn just the right portion for the carbs involved, it definitely had the eggs but also pancetta instead of bacon and a light dousing of pecorino and parmigiano. Mine was definitely different, the $16 Spaghetti al Granchio, a tomato-based pasta with the chunks of fresh tomato nicely balancing the dungeness crab complemented by capers and parsley (see photo). My one slight suggestion on this dish is to undercut the cumulative sweetness of the crab and tomatoes with something more savory, perhaps anchovies. We shared a dessert, the $7 Affrogato, which is a shot of espresso drowning a scoop of ice cream, all topped off by whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa powder (see photo). It was light enough to be satisfying though it appears to be more of an afterthought on the menu here. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...solid Italian fare medium-priced and well executed with fresh ingredients \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...still small and tight but in a neighborhood way \nSERVICE - 4 stars...fine (though we had the advantage of being 12 feet away from the kitchen) \nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely worth a return to Bernal Heights", "author": "Ed U."}

Saw the reviews of this place and wanted to try since it's so close to our house. I called them 1 hour and 30 mins ahead to ensure that they have table available for two at 8pm. A guy in the restaurant picked up the phone and he didn't ask my name nor phone number, just told us to come and it should be fine. I thought it was sort of weird but thought they might not take reservation. My husband & I went in about 7:50pm. The manager who greeted us asked if we had a reservation. I explained to him the situation, and he told us to wait for maybe 15 mins. We waited for 30 mins, but was not seated. There were a few tables open and when I asked if we could be seated the manager said those tables were reserved but no one was waiting. So we walked out and went to the one in West Portal who truly deserves 5 stars and serves us right away. The food from the photos on Yelp looks good, but the way they managed the restaurant was very disappointing. Will NOT come again and will not recommend to friends.", "author": "Gogo W."}

I made one (called right at opening) for 8pm on a Saturday and was not seated until nearly 9pm. the manager(?) was completely dismissive and didn't care at all that a reservation was made and would barely communicate back when we questioned the wait time (which should have been nothing). I have come here multiple times and the food is without a doubt 5 stars, but I can't say that I'll be back after that last debacle.\n\nafter reading the reviews I realized this problem with reservations is an ongoing trend. If you're so worried about filling your tables and you cannot honor your reservations then stop taking them!! simple solution. Also, I don't know if the man running the front of house is the owner or manager or what, but if he isn't the owner then the owners should really look into replacing him with someone more personable, and if he is the owner, you're an a**hole.", "author": "Some B."}

My glasses refused to fit back onto my face after I put the helmet on so I was blind the entire ride there. Neither of us had any idea what neighborhood we were in but I had a feeling it was Bernal Heights considering its the one nice neighborhood by my house. \n\nThe restaurant is so fucking cute! If I lived in Bernal Heights, I can imagine becoming a regular here. It looks like one of those nice neighborhood restaurants one could only dream about. Its warm and cozy and our waiter was not only nice, but he was gorgeous. All 6'4 of him. Mmmmmmmmm. I think the people who work here actually speak Italian too. My date made reservations but I don't think they were necessary. We got there at 8 on a Monday night but the restaurant did fill up at one point. \n\nMy date and I decided to get a pizza and pasta dish. We got the mushroom and truffle oil pizza and the crab pasta. The pizza was definitely worth five stars. It was covered in truffle oil and was even better than the mushroom truffle pizza I had at ZeroZero the week before. The pasta was probably only three stars. It was alright but I didn't like the pasta to sauce ratio. Also I thought the waiter could've offered some parmesan to put over the pasta. \n\nThe portions are really big and we had a ton of leftovers. Every dish I saw served to the surrounding tables looked amazing too! The dessert menu was kind of meh but we got the ice cream sandwich and it ended up being really good. Far exceeded both our expectations. My date said the cookie tasted like a chocolate chip cookie without the chocolate chips haha.

We dine here regularly because the food is usually great, the service is amazing, and the ambiance is warm. \n\nThis time, however, was a different experience. The food was very off.

Though we waited for at least 30 minutes for a table and I was super hungry, I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. The sauce reminded me of the thick, pasty, bland, ketchup-like stuff in Chef Boyardee. Disgusting.

It is tomato season after all!\n\nAlso beware that \"fresh\" Dungeness crab isn't exactly fresh when it's been frozen since Dungeness crab season closed months ago.\n\nI still give two stars: one for the wonderful staff and owners, and one for the lovely feeling of eating in the comfort of someone's inviting home.\n\nI'm sad to say that I most likely won't be going back to Vega on my own volition...not when I can make better pasta at home :(", "author": "Melissa M."}

The server in the new section (blond lady) seemed very unhappy of our new placement: a) asked us if we needed boxes instead of inquiring if we'd like to order anything else b) never came back to check on us (we ended up ordering desert and espresso by calling up our previous server) c) placed our check on the table before we started our deserts\n\nI would have let all this slide because the food was AMAZING but I received no apology or empathy for my painful smoky experience... and with so many great restaurants in the bay area when you drop $100, you expect a certain level of service.", "author": "Katya s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-09", "description": "This is my go-to restaurant in the city. It works for a romantic evening out for 2 or a casual dinner with friends for 4. Service is terrific, price is very reasonable, and the ambiance always just right -- on the intimate side, but still with a gentle background buzz from all the other (happy) patrons. LOVE this place. Love it. \n\nI came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday night on short notice. Like an idiot, I'd suggested first that we go try to wait for a table at the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square after we'd done some holiday shopping. The wait? 1.5 hours... JUST TO GET A PAGER. And then, another hour after that, for a total of 2.5 hours. Needless to say, we looked elsewhere.\n\nI'd been saving a dinner at Vega for a date night but decided to give the restaurant a call anyway to see if they could seat us quickly. Two rings and the host picked up, and he quoted 15 minutes. We got there -- found easy parking nearby, like almost always -- and ended up waiting exactly 15 minutes, just as we were told. We enjoyed a glass Italian wine suggested by the staff which was terrific, and then we sat down for our meal.\n\nThe food is here is terrific every time. Very straightforward Italian fare, everything under $20, everything fresh. We shared a pizza carpaccio (generous with the mushrooms and prosciutto) and -- my favorite -- the dungeness crab capellini. The pasta's simply wonderful, a fresh-tossed blend of capellini, chopped tomatoes and a light tomato sauce, garlic, olive oil, parsley, and plenty of crab meat. At $18 I still think it's one of the great bargain entrees in the city.\n\nAnd the service! It's a small restaurant, so I suppose it isn't surprising that there are plenty of staff people checking up on each table, but what was most remarkable was how warm each person was. The host, the server, the busboy -- to a (wo)man, everyone smiled and asked how we were enjoying ourselves. We couldn't have had a better meal.\n\nI still consider this a hidden gem, and I hope it stays hidden, great reviews notwithstanding!", "author": "Albert L."}

We ordered the Margherita and Veggie Pizza along with the Rigatoni. I know my food and what I am tasting. Costco uses better ingredients on their pizza than Vega, really. The Margherita had a very poor quality Mozza and there were little tiny pieces of tasteless basil. The crust at Papa Johns puts the quality of this crust to shame. The Veg pizza was mostly mushrooms with really low quality olives. The Rigatoni was was made with such obvious canned tomato that it reminded me of eating something from a school lunch when I was a kid. The crappy cheese they used also reminded me of this. The whole dish tasted mostly like Ketchup. I wish I could give more stars because the people were not mean in any way but the way they prepare food is kind of mean.", "author": "Neil W."}

The pasta with crab tasted like the floor of a seafood market. I asked to speak to a manager and the rude hostess replied ' it's basically us', and pointed to the restaurant staff. The owners need to reconsider their staff if they expect to maintain a quality establishment. Overall it was entirely unpleasant. The bread was 2 day old stale as well. It appears the owners stopped caring about the food in 2003. Olive Garden is a step up.", "author": "Ronald B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-24", "description": "Having seen this restaurant on Check Please Bay Area, we had to investigate.  They are on open table, but we were going pretty late on a Saturday night so figured we did not need a reservation. We were able to walk in, and got a nice table near the window immediately.  The menu looked simply fabulous, and we had a hard time deciding what we wanted.  My one problem with traditional Italian restaurants is I have to point at the menu... I cannot pronounce anything to order it. \n\nWe settled on sharing an app, and then splitting a pizza and a pasta.  This was plenty of food for the two of us. \n\nThey brought us wonderful bread and olive oil.  The bread was dense and almost doughy and was a perfect start.  Its always nice to get bread and olive oil to start, and not having to ask.  They brought plenty, but we were hungry and refilled our bread without a problem. \n\nFor our appetizer we got CARCIOFINI RIPIENI, per the menu this is described as \"Warmed artichoke hearts stuffed w/ goat cheese, wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, pesto and mixed greens.\" I describe this as \"OH MY F** GOOD GOD\".  Wow.  Out of this world.  Something I have never had, in a flavor combination that was spectacular and well balanced.  Nothing stood out, the flavors all just went well together. If I had any complaints it would would be too small to share for more than 2 people. \n\nFor our entrees we split the PIZZA BRESAOLA & RUGHETTA and GNOCCHI ALLA BOSCAIOLA.  The pizza was perfect.  Perfect Naples style pizza. The flavors were awesome, the bresaola was some of the best I have ever had and it was topped with an arugula salad that was yummy and worked with the pizza.\n\nThe Gnocchi was wonderful.  Perfect little pillows of love that were so tender and delicate but stood up to the mushroom and sausage sauce. \n\nThe desserts looked fabulous, but had no room for it.  We took our left overs home.  They wrapped them for us, which is such a nice touch.  I hate when you have left overs and they just hand you a box.  It is such a nice touch of service when they take your plates and wrap your items in the back and present them nicely to you.\n\nOn that though, the pizza was delicious in the morning, however the gnocchi did not reheat well.  We would have been better powering through dinner and eating all we could rather than take some home.  Totally not their fault though...\n\nIf you go, definitely order family style so you have multiple tastes.  I cannot wait to go back.\n\nOnly two downfalls is 1) its in Bernal Heights, someplace that I normally don't go or have a reason to hang out it. and 2) no fountain soda.  While I didnt need soda, we got prosecco, but for the most part, my general rule is: No fountain soda, No 5 star.", "author": "David P."}

We've enjoyed two of the pizzas: the Contadina with pancetta, mushrooms, fontina and a fried egg, and the Broccoli & Salsiccia, with broccoli rabe and Italian sausage. The salads are good. The not-quite-traiditional minestrone  is also very good, though it has a bit too much pesto. The grilled sardines are REALLY good--not to be missed if you like sardines. The pasta dishes look very good, and we look forward to trying them on a future visit. The only downside is the sometimes frenetic pace of the waitstaff as they try to stay on top of the orders in the room and large number of take out orders they also have to handle.

But on my most recent visit, we ended up walking out of this restaurant and won't be back again.\n\nI had a gift certificate that gave us $25 off when we spent $35 on food and/or drink.  We showed up and it was SUPER busy  and were told (somewhat rudely - in retrospect it seemed they would rather we give up on eating there) it was probably an hour wait.  That was fine, we went to Stray Bar and nursed a beer for a while.  When we came back and inquired about the status, the manager/owner? looked at me unhappily and made the \"metza metz\" hand gesture, indicating he didn't know how much longer the wait would be.  I took a seat at the bar and soon after our table was ready.\n\nWe looked over everything, realized it was Wednesday and the wine was half-off a bottle.  We presented the gift certificate to our waiter (before ordering, as per the instructions), and then ordered two entrees and a bottle of wine.  He came back shortly and said that they could not give us the gift certificate AND a bottle of wine at half off, so I asked if we could order more food to get to the $35 limit, and then take the bottle at the half-off price (there was no fine print on our certificate about Wednesdays, or other specials, just that it was only valid Sun - Thurs).  He went to check, and the manger/owner came back and explained the issue, and I again offered to purchase an additional appetizer to hit the limit and get a bottle of wine. \n\nThen the truth came out - that the manager felt the restaurant was too busy to handle confirming our gift certificate at any point that night.  I pointed out he was not trying to work with us, but since we were hungry (after waiting an hour), I felt the point was moot and took back my gift certificate (annoyed, but hungry and willing to deal).\n\nA minute later my date pointed out that they were being kind of rude to us, and we probably couldn't expect service to get any better.  I agreed, asked if she wanted to leave, and she did.  So we left.  Never to return.  Our server didn't seem surprised when I told him.  It's a shame, as after the hour wait we were not only starving, but really looking forward to the dinner.\n\nSorry Vega, but if you can't handle a gift certificate from two people are who are trying WAY harder to you to be reasonable, you either need to hire additional staff, or rethink your management.  In other words, don't write checks you can't cash.\n\nWe ended up at Blue Elephant where we got prompt, friendly service, and were able to order, eat, and settle the check in less time then we waited for Vega.   I still have two gift certificates that I won't be using, maybe someone else might want to try them?", "author": "Tmon B."}

What I like about it the most (besides their decadent dishes) is the restaurants atmosphere. I happen to live in the neighborhood and often pass by at all times of the day. However, my particular favorite time is at night because you see, there is something magical and romantic that happens at Vega when the fog rolls in. So by now your dying to know right? It's simple, this little restaurant reminded me of the importance of window panes. Window Panes? Yes, Vega's Windows are what make the restaurant, without the clash of the kitchen heat and outside cool breeze and the small quarters this place would not be so cool. It reminds you of those chic flics where a guy walks by a coffee or restaurant and catches a glimpse of the love of his life through a foggy window pain, however the glare from the street lights does not allow her to see you, but you can see her...and then you right her a note and squiggle what's your name of the fogged up glass......oh geez of track of track sorry. Regardless add that to really good food, and you have a magical evening for two. Best of Luck, who knows maybe you'll meet the Love of your life there hehehehe. \n\np.s Try the gnocchi, forego the broccoli pizza.", "author": "Lannette G."}

Vega serves it with pasta or as a side.   Pizzas are crisp and light.  Salads are imaginative.  Pastas are al dente with delicious sauces.  I've probably tried most of the menu.  Other than pizza and pasta the menu is limited but the few second dishes they serve are flavorful.  The fish is served with a tomato/olive/caper sauce which is delicious and the chicken is prepared with proscuitto and cheese.  The  place is small and cozy and family friendly.

We started off with one of their pizzas for an appetizer then we all had our own entree. I had the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. The gnocchi was ok but the sauce was awesome. We also ordered the fish special which was Halibut. The fish was slightly overcooked however the overall dish was good. I don't recall what the other two ordered but their dishes were good as well. \nThe kicker was that we came on a wednesday and got 1/2 off bottles of wine.

The location has a nice ambience, somewhat dimly lit with candles on each table.  The effect provides a nice glow within the restaurant.  We shared a spinach salad, a margherita pizza, and a papardelle dish with porcini mushrooms.  We each enjoyed the spinach salad, which featured goat cheese, toasted walnuts, and raisins, and were eager for the next arrivals.   Though there are multiple offerings for pizza, margherita seems to be sort of the 'barometer' to gauge a restaurant's pizza, and neither of us were impressed.  The pizza was quite average, with a cracker-crisp crust edge and little flavor.  I can think of a number of better offerings, but in the grand scheme, for $11 it was not a bad value but simply nothing special.  The paparadelle porcini pasta dish was quite disappointing, greasy in appearance as it was bathed in olive and truffle oil, and simply unappetizing.  Perhaps we picked a loser from the menu and would have enjoyed the gnocchi boscaiola or another dish, but we decided to pass on dessert as we were both ready to leave after our uninspiring main courses.\n\nOn the upside, the prices were reasonable from my perspective, and the Nero D'Avola wine I enjoyed @ $8 per glass was well-valued.  Service was attentive and did a nice job.  If I lived in the area, I would surely give it another try, but having driven 20 minutes from across the city- I will pass.  I can walk 5-10 minutes  to several restaurants which I feel provide a better valued Italian meal in a similar price range such as Ristorante Milano, Pane e Vino, Via Veneto, Jackson Fillmore or A-16.", "author": "Andy S."}

We made reservations just in case, and I'm glad we did, because although the restaurant wasn't full when we arrived, there was a line out the door by the time we left.\n\nFirst things first-- the food was wonderful. Eating here reminded me of the occasional Sunday dinners I had at my Italian next-door-neighbor's house when I was a kid. The portions were generous enough that the four of us shared an appetizer and three dishes and were too full to even try dessert. Our favorite dish was the braised shortribs over polenta-- the meat was so tender and flavorful. I'd also highly recommend the capellini with crabmeat; the homemade pasta was so fine my mom was almost convinced they were rice noodles. It was light and delicious and a good contrast to the richness of our other dish, the mushroom and sausage gnocchi. My picky parents who usually don't like anything non-Asian were very impressed.\n\nThe service was very attentive; our drink and food orders were taken promptly, waters were re-filled frequently, and the server checked up on us a couple times. The parking wasn't crazy by San Francisco standards. I'd definitely come back again to try their other pastas and pizzas too.", "author": "J C."}

I got there early and was seated amongst a number of families with children.  That was great as everyone seemed to enjoy the place, including the kids, and it's nice to find a family friendly venue.  \n\nThe menu is very inviting, although I found the food less so.  For example a salad of crab, cucumber, avocado, endive, lemon and chives was beautiful to behold and well-portioned.  But the crab had very little taste; the star of the plate was the avocado.\n\nGnocchi with mushrooms , sausage, Parmesan and truffle oil sounded inviting.  But the gnocchi were pasty and the sausage was bland. \n\nA main of sea bass came with black olives, tomatoes and capers on cauliflower and potato pur\u00e9e.  This was a success as the fish was perfectly cooked and the tomatoes and olives livened the plate. \n\nAll in all a nice enough neighborhood spot.", "author": "David D."}

It was just overwhelming with just the porcini mushrooms because their flavor is strong. I think you should go easy on the Porcini mushrooms Vega, more is not better, and put a variety of mushrooms on it for balance. It was certainly nothing like the mushroom pizza I had in Italy...and I have had great mushroom pizza in Sonoma, so...\n\nThe second pizza was worse, because it was entirely soggy...it did have tomatoes on it, but I have had tomatoes on a pizza before without a pool of liquid below the crust...\n\nI think that there are a few things for vega to work out, like how to make a pizza with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella without a soggy crust...it's been done before, it is possible...\n\n\nService was fine...This is a review for the pizza.

If you haven't had egg on pizza, it is definitely worth trying: the egg is sufficiently cooked so you don't have to worry about salmonella, and the yolk adds a nice flavor and moisture that goes deliciously well with the thin crust.\n\nThey typically have some great specials that rival the pizzas. I recommend the minestrone appetizer special if available.\n\nFor dessert, the affogato--ice cream with a shot of espresso covered by home whipped cream--is dangerously delicious, although we once got it late, at which point the ice cream was already mostly melted.\n\nThe ambiance here is awesome: it is cozy and personal--great place for a romantic date. The price is somewhere between $$ and $$$. The service is very friendly.

The toppings on this pizza - prosciutto, egg, mushrooms, artichoke and mozzarella are lovely accompaniments but I think the composition is a little lacking. Everything slides off the crust a little too easily. Be forewarned as well, only half your pizza will contain prosciutto and half will contain the artichoke and egg. Not sure why the whole pizza isn't covered with all toppings.\n\nA side of broccoli rabbe provides some greens to accompany your pasta - tasty but be forewarned, very overpowering on the garlic however expertly cooked al dente.\n\nThis restaurant also stays open until 10pm which is nice because many places around here close at 9 or 9:30. This place is definitely a favorite that I plan to continue returning to.", "author": "Steven H."}

I chose this place after seeing it on Bay Area Check Please.  Since it was my bday, my husband actually emailed to confirm the night before with the owner, no less.  We show up and they don't have our reservations! The blond waitress there was extremely rude, didn't bother to try to figure out what might have happened or contact the owner (who wasn't there) and treated my husband like he made the mistake, asking him, very condescendingly, if he was sure he had the right date .  Sadly, my husband had deleted the email exchange with the owner so he couldn't pull it up to show the blond.  So we decided to find another spot to eat and there was Liberty Caf\u00e9!  Besides, who would want to patronize a place where your first point of contact is rude and condescending?!  Sidenote: My husband did email the owner back the next day and she was very apologetic.  She knew exactly who he was talking about(probably the same one referenced in the other reviews for bad service), which I thought was interesting.  To me, it seems that she knows she has a problem employee, but tolerates it which blows my mind.  The owner also offered us a gift certificate for our troubles, but that was two weeks ago and nothing's arrived in the mail so I'm not holding my breath. \n\nFrom the street, Liberty Cafe looked like they were almost full, so my husband went inside, explained what had happened across the street and they were more than willing to accommodate us if we were willing to sit in their back cottage!  You wouldn't know it from the street, but not only is there a back cottage, but there's also an outdoor patio(w/heat lamps) and a movie playing!  It was so cute.  We ended up in the cottage which was really cute and cozy.  Food was delicious and fresh.  The only thing is the portions did seem small, but at the end of the meal it worked out because we ended up having room for 2 desserts (to share).  \n\nIt seemed like a real neighborhood restaurant with lots of local regulars.  I would definitely come back and check out their movie nights with my kids.  \n\nBut most of all, the customer service was fantastic.

Our favorites are the Margherita and the Mushroom Truffle Oil.\n\nSecondly, there is an entire section on gnocchi.  And they have truly nailed the texture of this hard-to-master pasta, which is so hard to do - not too mushy, not too springy, not too heavy, not too light.  They know this, so they offer it in several different ways - with your choice of 4 sauces, or in a heartier main dish.  We had the Gnocchi with sausage with mushrooms in a truffle oil cream sauce and it was the best dish of the night, by far.\n\nThe protein based dishes are good as well.  We had a mediterranean-inspired cod that was well cooked and flavored with tomatoes, capers, and olives - very bright and fresh, and a nice contrast to the carb-loaded pastas and pizzas.\n\nService was very nice and accommodating - we mentioned that we had limited time and the food came out quickly, so we didn't feel rushed at all.  Next time, I will try one of the wines from their extensive list.\n\nA nice makeover for the neighborhood's restaurant community, and the packed tables attest to its success thus far.

In unsophisticated wine-ese I asked owner Vega for a \"dark red\" wine and she brought a warm, deep burgundy Italian vintage (none of these thin, sour California reds that look like cranberry juice, thank you very much) that held its own against the earthy mushrooms to come.\n\nThe food: rich, hearty flavors contrasting with the lightest of textures, simply and freshly prepared.\n\nTo start, creamy mushroom soup with truffle oil and parmeggiano cheese -- a rich, intensely mushroom-flavored divinity, made sinfully creamy, incredibly, with mostly potatoes and very little actual cream.  The truffle oil just enough to cause salivation without overpowering.\n\nBroccoli rabe -- a plate of the darkest, freshest greens simply prepared with olive oil.\n\nQuattro formaggio pizza -- an almost liquid blend of cheeses like I remember from Italy, featuring gorgonzola and pears, on the lightest, thinnest and crispiest of crusts.  In my greed I almost wished for more thin, sweet slices of pear to contrast the strong, salty cheeses.\n\nAnd then the gnocchi.  Oh, the gnocchi.  Little pillowy clouds resting in more creamy, mushroomy goodness with more truffle oil, but with a distinctly different flavor from the soup, owing to the bright, almost citrus-y white wine in the sauce.  Not a gluey, starchy potato glob in sight; really the most perfect gnocchi I've had.\n\nAnd just when we thought another bite couldn't be consumed, the panne cotta: fluffy, white, lighter than air, with dark red strawberry sauce (but not too much, and not too sweet) drizzled over top.\n\nA place you could ensconce yourself and a few friends or a special someone for an entire evening, slowly savoring a dish from each section of the menu, expertly paired with Italian wine.\n\nBrava, Vega.\n\n(Also posted on Valentina's Yelp page.)", "author": "Maggie T."}

I simply could not bring myself to appreciate their interpretation of thin-crust pizza.\n\nWe ordered the CALAMARI E CANNELLINI appetizer and PIZZA  CAPRICCIOSA, PIZZA BROCCOLI & SALSICCIA, and PIZZA SPECK & BUFALA pies.  The calamari appetizer was flavorful, but not a dish I would order again.  The pizzas all came uncut, with toppings unevenly distributed, and on a saltine-cracker-thin crust.  If you are thinking that I am an uncultured San Franciscan, and that I have just described the essence of San Francisco pizzas, the rest of my review will be of little interest to you.\n\nThe uncut pizzas made them difficult to share, and when we tried to cut our own slices, the cracker-thin crust crumbled in protest and to our dismay.  The uneven distribution (huge chunks of prosciutto on one-fourth of the pizza, having two slices without tasting artichoke hearts, etc.) made sharing the pizzas and enjoying each slice equally a chore too.  \n\nThe crust was the greatest disappointment for me.  The edges were burnt, and the thinness and crunch of each bite caused me to wonder if I could have been equally satisfied staying at home with a box of saltine crackers, cheese, and prosciutto.\n\nOnce again, this review is not a reflection of the quality of the restaurant, but their interpretation of thin-crust pizza and my personal pizza preference.", "author": "Andrew M."}

We were so excited to eat here, but unfortunately we won't be back.  Everything started great, the service throughout the night was very good, and our party of 4 split a Pizza Margherita and the calamari.  Those were excellent, the pizza was superb, nice flavors, perfect crust, and the calamari was soft and tender (not chewy) and had a beautiful acidity to it.  \nIt was Wednesday so we took advantage of the half priced wine night, having a bottle of Prosecco to start, which was served at room temp and dumped in a bucked of cold water, but our first glasses were slightly chilled at best.  We were somewhat disappointed by the wine list, as there was a huge hole between $40 and $90, but we went with the Cannonau, which was a good choice.\nMy main course was great, I had the baked rigatoni with meatballs, it was a huge serving, and was the best dish at our table.  Our gripe really stemmed from the Gnocchi alla boscaiola that is served with a \"touch\" of truffle oil.  I love truffles, who doesn't, but this seemed like it was served with a cup of truffle oil.  The smell was overwhelming, and the astringency and strength was burned into my mouth until this morning (yes, I did brush my teeth).  I would call this at the point of inedible, and it nearly ruined the meal.  \nWe got the check and after two bottles of wine we were still in a festive mood, except all of us were a bit annoyed that no one was even close on the guess the check game.  We were all under by a lot, I missed by about $75.  I hate to lose, so I grabbed my Iphone and added up the bill.  I did it again before announcing to the table that the total on the bill was $85 more than it should have been.  After a quick apology they fixed this, but what if we would have just paid and not even checked.  I'm sorry but this mistake is inexcusable and will be the lasting impression we will have about this restaurant.\n\nSorry Vega, I wanted to love you, but you didn't meet the standards with the food, then you tried to take my money...

The dough is not too salty either, so you won't be dying of thirst later in the evening, like with other pizzas!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-15", "description": "I can't say enough good things about this place. My wife and I are foodies and wine connouissiers, and Vega sets the standard for what a small Italian restaurant should be. Yes, it's small and in Bernal Heights and if you don't have a reservation, you can expect to wait a while for a table... and even if you do have a reservation, if it's super busy you might have to wait a bit. But,  you can get some wine while you wait, and once you're seated you will be very well taken care of. This is not one of those so-called five-star chain restaurants. This is a tiny \"hole in the wall\" family run place. It's not that big, and its reputation is such that you should expect it to be busy during peak periods, possibly with a line going out the door. The kitchen is large enough for about 3 chefs to work in and they can only put out so much food in a certain amount of time. \n\nMy wife and I have been here several times now and each visit was excellent. If this place seems authentic, it's because it is! Vega, is the owner. She's there pretty much all the time and has an excellent staff supporting her. Each morning, her husband calls his mother in Italy to work out the day's specials, etc. All the pasta is hand-made, etc. There is no way to rush preparation of food this quality. It just takes dedication and patience. If you come here and it's crowded and noisy, that's a sign that they have kept their prices reasonable and the food delicious. Don't be discouraged, just hang in there and wait for a table and be glad they're not asking for twice as much money. They could easily do that and it would still be worth it. They keep the prices reasonable because we all deserve to be able to enjoy this food.\n\nFirst: the wine. They offer an excellent selection of wines by the glass as well as by the bottle. If you're going by the glass, get the Sangiovese. Heck, even by the bottle, it's a good value. If you really want to splurge, go for a bottle of Brunello di Montalicino. Awesome stuff. \n\nWe've had an appetizer called Involtini di Mare here, it's a wonderful combination of shrimp, mango, avocado, and smoked salmon. Get it. \n\nI really love the gnocci here. Gnocci is a potato dumpling style pasta, it's hand-rolled and always cooked to perfection here. Each bite is a bite of heaven. Having had it on my first visit (and it's one of their specialties), each time I come here, I struggle to avoid ordering it, so I can try something new.  There are two forms it comes in: \"della casa\", which is basically just the dumplings with sauce, or \"alla boscaiola\", which comes with mushrooms, (amazing) Italian sausage, and truffle oil.  Both are good, but the extra mushrooms and sausage push the second one slightly ahead in my preferences.\n\nMy wife similarly struggles with the braised pork ribs. They are so good, she can't order anything else.They are incredibly tender and seasoned perfectly, and it all just melts in your mouth. This comes with a polenta to die for!\n\nThe rigatoni is really excellent as well. I recommend you get this their meatballs, which are really tender and tasty. Absolutely delicious!\n\nThe fish specials are always fresh and cooked to perfection. We've had some really amazing scallops here, and scallops are very hard to do well. A poorly executed scallop will leave you never wanting them again. A properly cooked one will melt in your mouth and you will be in love! This place has the latter of the two.\n\nVega has my favorite Panna Cotta for dessert, of anywhere. It's creamy and delicious.  I have also tried the ice cream with espresso poured over it, and that's really good too. My wife says that the Tiramisu is priceless. They don't always have it on the menu, ask for it. It's the best one she has ever had, and she tries it in every high-end italian restaurant we go to. I concur.\n\nApparently, they are known for their pizza! The pizzas I have seen other people eating in here look really good, but the other food on the menu is so good, and I don't live nearby, there's a very good chance I will never get around to trying the pizza.\n\nAs a final note, Vega's husband has opened a restaurant across the street.  We have not yet had the opportunity to try it out, but I think we will be able to expect the same quality there.", "author": "Adam B."}

The two owners even gave my date and I glasses of house-made limoncello on-the-house at the end of the meal... only because the waiter had overheard I live a close walk away.  I'm not one that's easily bribed, but that was just a special touch at the end of a very special evening.\n\nI am very much a wine snob, but admittedly I know the least about Italian wines, and the list is pretty much all Italian.  However, it's not an overwhelming list and pretty easy to navigate with the waiter's assistance.  I discovered in conversation with the hostess that she was actually the owner of the Vino Rosso wine bar down the street which I had been to many times... so that explains the excellent wine list :).  We chose a Sangiovese riserva which was perfect for the meal.  To start, we had this salad of fresh, local dungeness crab meat with cucumber, avocado, endive, and tomatoes drizzled simply with garlic oil and black pepper.  The amount of crab on this appetizer was HUGE... which made my date and I very, very happy.  Next was a small thin crust pizza with rapini, sage sausage, garlic, buffalo mozzarella, and parmesan suggested by the hostess... simply amazing.  Then we moved on to pasta dishes - paparadelle with wild boar ragu and spaghetti a la carbonara, both of which were with house made pasta and perfectly spicy and rich.  Everything winded down with a shared chocolate mousse with strawberry sauce that was very light and airy and a very perfect close to the dinner.\n\nThis place very obviously recognizes that it's existence is dependent upon those of us in the neighborhood and it shows handsomely.  I'm a real big fan of restaurants that are constantly cognizant of their market and their guests and their needs.  This place won on all those counts hands down.

Bernal is my favorite neighborhood in SF and we had a great street view for people watching. I ordered some wine which was excellent and the food was exceptional. The place is small so it gets pretty loud but I love the cozy feel and the service was really good. The bread and olive oil were both so fresh and reminded me of when I lived in Italy!

We had the same woman who was hostess/server that others have mentioned.  She became very annoyed when we asked for a couple minutes to decide on our order.  No surprise when she asked how everything was and I said the food was wonderful, but the noise excrutiating.  She replied with a deadpan expression saying, \"That's not under my control\".  Well then, who the f*** does? \"Kids should be seen and not heard\" is not the motto here.  Don't get me wrong, as I don't have a problem with kids eating out.  I have a problem when 5 kids sitting at the large party behind us, who have not been taught how to behave in restaurants.  The adults in the party had to scream to be heard over their kids who were screaming most of the time.  It seemed that this party may have been friends of the hostess, which would explain the spineless response.\nToo bad, as it was one of the best Carbonara dishes I've had.

We ordered a simple Margarita pizza and a side of the polenta.  Since we live a few miles away we decided to order ahead so we would not have to wait.  First call... no answer.  Ok, they are most likely busy.  I will try back in a few minutes.  A few minutes later success! We placed our order with a pleasant women on the phone and she informed us that the food would be ready in 25 minutes.  We wait the full 25 minutes at our home and take off the get the food.  Ten minutes later we are at Vega.  I step in to let the hostess know I had called an order in.  She looks puzzled and goes to the kitchen for confirmation.  When she comes back she asks me if I got the Margarita pizza and polenta and I agree.  To my disappointment I then can see my food is just being prepared right behind her, 35 minutes after initially ordering.  The hostess did not offer me anything to drink or a seat like she did for the other patrons waiting right next to me.  I waited another 10-15 minutes outside until my food was done and given to me and at that point had been double the estimated time given to me, for thin pizza.  We got back home and were pleasantly surprised with the food.  The pizza was very thin, light and delicious.  The sauce and cheeses tasted very fresh.  The polenta was good as well,  nothing really special.  Even though the pizza was good I will not be returning because of the service and with plenty of other good thin crust pizza places in the Bay Area.", "author": "Shawn B."}

Pasta to sauce ratio is spot-on (not sopping in sauce).  Ragu tasted great - not too salty and hint of acidity.\n\nPizza is thin and crispy, loaded with toppings.  Not true neapolitan pizza, but they don't claim that either.  Hint of truffle rounded out this excellent pizza.\n\nWe can't wait to go back to try the other food, including the secondi (saw a fish entree that looked great).\n\nFinally, the Italian-focused wine list is sized right:  Not too big, but enough choices to pair with all the different types of food.

The day after my wife and I arrived was a Sunday and I had some free time to visit with a friend who lives in Bernal Heights.  We walked up the hill from his place to grab a quick bite to eat and he gave me the choice of The Liberty Cafe or Vega.  I didn't know jack about either place.  I had never heard of either.  I chose Vega.\n\nThe restaurant was a little tight, but that could be that we are both over 6'5\" tall.  The server was attentive without being overbearing and we were able to place our orders relatively quickly.  Both my friend and I ordered the Pizza  Capricciosa which was advertised in the menu with tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, artichoke, mushrooms, egg.\n\nI had never ordered a pizza with prosciutto or egg on it before, so I didn't know quite what to expect.  It did take a while for our food to arrive and I started salivating from the aroma emanating from the kitchen.  I was preoccupied with my conversation, so I didn't particularly care that the food took a little extra longer to arrive.  When it did arrive, oh boy!  It was pizza perfection!  The crust was thin, crisp, tender and perfectly charred around the edges.  The prosciutto was tissue paper thin.  The egg yolk broke and made a tasty ooey gooey mess.  The artichoke was pleasantly tart.  I am a big guy, so the relatively small thin crust pizza only roused my appetite without properly bedding it back down, but had I added a salad or dessert, I don't think this would have been the case.  To make things even better, my friend picked up the tab at the end of the meal.  I REALLY owe him for this one.\n\nEvery time my wife and I visit the Bay Area, I am amazed at the little hole-in-the-wall restaurants that one can find if one only has a smidgen of adventure and just walks in.  I will definitely return for many more meals at Vega!", "author": "Brian S."}

Parking was relatively easy (compared to some other parts of the city, like the Castro). \nI liked the menus...they were in a protective sheet of plastic and easy to read...I'm lame and like stuff like that\nThey had one of those double doors like they have in cottages (the one where it's split in half with a bottom and a top). It's very quaint\nVERY good service. I accidentally and retardedly burned my thumb on a candle that I tried to steal to our table and the waitress we had, MANDY, who is very amazing was very attentive. I loved her. She alone earned this place 2 stars\nThe margherita pizza was very good. Super super thing crust and great flavors. The price was pretty Ok as well. I enjoyed it a lot. \n\nCons:\nSome of the things that were prices I felt like shouldnt have been priced that way (i.e. the calamari)\nThe calamari wasn't fried that much at all...in fact it was sauted. Not that I necessarily had a problem with it being sauted, but it was kind of rubbery and when I think calamari, I think fried. The dish was also served on a bed of beans which was kind of weird to me...\nThe bread was SUPER SALTY. Also their Pizza Speck. I dont know what they were doing, but man, that stuff would have given me a kidney stone if I kept eating it. Not sure what was up with that, but very very salty. I didnt end of eating a full mini-slice of bread or more than 1-2 slices of Pizza Speck which was disappointing\nIt was kind of cramped inside, and maybe because it was Friday night and what not, but I felt very cramped and it got kind of loud at certain points and it was hard for me to hear...or I'm getting old\nThe chairs were super rickety. To the point where I felt like if I moved too much, I'd break it...they should invest in tightening the screws or something b/c they were hella flimsy\n\nOverall I may go back if I was in the area.

I especially recommend the Gnocchi alla boscaiola, so delicious!!  They also have a very nice list of Italian wines. \n\nThe atmosphere is quaint and the flavors are very homy. I also like the fact that the owners are there at all times greeting people and coming to the tables to make sure that everything is going well. \n\nWe will be going back again and again.", "author": "carmen c."}

Table bread is on the dry side. Spinach salad was decent and the goat cheese wasn't overly powerful. Had the pizza margherita but substituted bufala mozzarella instead of the regular one. Tasty, good sauce, a little salty. Thin crust whose edges were crispy, but center floppy. Seems like the only place I can get a crispy pizza all the way thru is Rome. Did not have enough basil on it. My wife had a pasta with wild boar sauce. She liked boar sauce from Capannina better, but the pasta here better. Topped it off with the homemade tiramisu. Not much to look at but tasted fine. Overall, 3.5 stars.", "author": "Veggie S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-02-26", "description": "I am sorry to report that I had a horrible experience at the restaurant. I waited over 35 minutes despite having made a reservation, not given any explanation as to why we had to wait while others who have made reservations at later times were seated before us. I had assumed restaurants were about food as well as about the service. The unprofessional way we were treated at this restaurant would be among the top three worst I've experienced in my life time! \n\nHaving seen numerous positive reviews on Yelp, I reserved a table for 3 on a Sat night. Arrived on time and waited to be seated. Waited... And waited.  In the restaurant, there were tables for 2 and tables for 4. And looking inside, I saw 2 parties of 3 seated on tables for 4. There was a table for 4 in plain sight when we walked in and I expected to be seated on that table. But for some reason, the gentleman in charge of seating us kept telling us to wait and that they were preparing a table. Another mystery was that he kept pointing to a table of 2 who were still having their desserts as \"the\" table we will be seated. Okay, how does he plan to fit 3 of us on a table for 2? He must have his reasons or tricks... And then the real surprise. A party of four who had a reservation 15 minutes later than ours walked in (I knew because the staff asked if they had a reservation), and they were given that very table for 4 we had expected to be seated. I just could not understand why we had to wait; is a party of 4 more valuable than a party of 3? Is a party of 3 a bad number? Wait, but then weren't there two other tables in the restaurant that 3 people were dining?\n\nI asked a couple of times the reason for the wait, and I was answered with a mumbling about preparing a table (he kept pointing to the table of 2 who were still working on their desserts) and that the person in charge of seating (referred to as \"Vega\") had stepped out; hence the wait. That would not be considered a reason for the wait, rather blaming on someone else, which I am not interested at all, nor did it resolve the issue. In the end, we waited over 35 minutes and was seated at a table of 4 that had finished their meal while we waited. Based on how things went, \"preparing a table\" can only be interpreted as \"waiting until a table of 4 who are dining\" but not giving a  table for 4 that was already available. What's the point of having made a reservation?  (If it were just myself, I would have walked away, but unfortunately I was not there by myself.)\n\nIt was Saturday evening and I can understand the staff making a mistake or even being slightly negligent. But when you get zero explanation but an unintelligible mumbling and blaming of others, not a single \"Thank you for waiting\", not a single apology,  it really leaves a bitter taste that lasts a long while. So, I won't even try to rate the food, other than to say there is no way I could be impartial after having been treated in such an unprofessional manner.\n\nI am very disappointed in how unprofessional the staff was. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will not go back again. My only hope is that there won't be any more people that have to experience what I had to and have a perfectly fine Saturday evening ruined.", "author": "S Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-05", "description": "Okay. I have to admit that this is a tough review to write. I have been to this restaurant twice and if I was going to review the place strictly on the food I would award 4 stars for what it is: thin pizzas, savory pastas, a few nice meat and fish dishes and solid appetizers/side dishes. \n\nI would also give the service staff 3.5 stars. I would normally give them 4 stars but on both occasions there were problems with the order and/or seating and it took a bit for the staff to realize and reconcile. In the case of the first time, they resolved the issue after a short wait. In the case of the latter visit, the issue was unresolvable. \n\nTherein lies the major issue with the establishment: the atmosphere is what creates the challenge. This place is configured in such a way that the space can seriously detract from the quality of the meal. Yes, it is a small space. But the real challenge comes from the fact that the space has a small foyer that seats one or two 2-person tables and the main seating area is a small and narrow rectangle. The result is that you can't really get two sets of tables down the sides. This was particularly obvious last night, when the five of us were forced to sit facing the wall (3 down the middle and two on the sides) as the table needed to be flush against the wall to accommodate the other table of 16 guests on the other side of the aisle. What made this galling is that both groups had reservations so the restaurant knew about this \"overbooked\" problem in advance. Our host was very apologetic but blamed it on OpenTable for allowing the reservations. \n\nAs good as the food may be, it is hard to spend a lot of money on dinner and feel good about it while facing a wall.\n\nRATING: 3.5 STARS", "author": "Peter O."}

Not a bad way to be greeted. :) We like the wine and accidentally had a bottle (or 2) during our meal. The wine was great and clearly very inexpensive. It was game one of the World Series (we were those people who kept checking the score on our phones) so the place was quiet, but from the time we walked in, until the time we walked out, the service was impeccable. Our server was great, the bus boy was phenomenal. Our water glasses were always full and as soon as the bread was gone, we were offered more. BTW, the bread is great!! \n\nI can't lie. We had a very hard time trying to decide what we wanted to order. The entire menu sounds delicious. We started with the Arugula and goat cheese salad. Awesome! I really enjoyed it as is was not drenched in dressing. Very light and very fresh. Their salads (along with everything else I saw) are a good sized portion. This place does not skimp on food by any means. I had to smoked prosciutto pizza. Fabulous!! The crust is so thin and crispy/flaky. Just the right amount of cheese. Very tasty! My friend had the paste carbonara. I had a taste....damn good as well. For dessert (which I highly recommend) we shared the homemade ice cream sandwiches. Holy shitballs!!! To die for! I would suggest going just for those alone. :) \n\nOverall, a great experience!!! The food, service, ambiance.....all spectacular and I look forward to returning in the near future.

I would rate it as 2.5 stars if I could, however, I feel that 2 stars would be more truthful than 3. The high points of the meal for me were 1) the house wine, which was exactly as described on the menu, and only $5 per glass - a great value; I wish more restaurants offered house wines at reasonable prices like this; and 2) affogato desert, which was divine. \nThe rest of the meal was very forgettable. The pizza we had was \"Cappriciosa\" - pizza dough was so-so, and they used canned artichokes. We also had \"gnocchi alla boscaiola\" (gnocchi itself was good, but sitting in a bed of cream sauce and sprinkled with oil on top, way too greasy altogether) and wild boar pappardelle. The latter was a huge disappointment; I would have expected slow cooked/braised meat that's fork tender, in a slow cooked sauce; instead we got what tasted exactly like the frozen turkey bolognese from Trader Joes - the meat was ground, and tough, also tasteless, and it came in tomato sauce that tasted like a canned sauce. \nThe ambiance of this place is lacking, and service was rushed and a bit spotty.

Went here with two friends and three children. First trouble occurs when friend eats a mouthful of salad, crunches on something foreign and spits GLASS out into her hand. Second bad moment occurred after they served us a minestrone soup that has  an almond based pesto sauce in it  that was not mentioned on the menu. Why not? every other ingredient was mentioned. My child has a severe tree nut allergy and I had shared the soup with him. What made everything worse was the staff's reaction. Regarding the glass,the waitress' response was a somewhat defensive: \" A drinking glass must have broken in the kitchen. This never happens.'' Regarding the nuts: the waitress and the manager looked at me as though I were crazy for telling them that for the safety of their customers they should include such information on the menu. I was then asked:  \"So what happens, does he get a rash?''  You would think folks in the food industry would be a little bit more knowledgable about food allergies and how serious they can be.
