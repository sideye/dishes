And the crowd was def a lot older, even the chef that came out to talk to the partons had a head full of white hair. \n\nThe food was good, very standard Italian food. I got the Sotto Mare, and it was quite good, I think the seafood could have been a little more fresh (being in North Beach and all) but overall it was delicious. In terms of price, it was $30 for the dish, and I finished the whole plate with room to spare for dessert, so it is very pricey. \n\nService was good, the waiters joked around with us a lot but were attentive, and the live music was a HUGE plus. That night they had a full 5 person jazz band and it was so much fun (a little loud for us to be able to do business talk, but a lot of fun nonetheless). \n\nOverall, I don't know if I would come here myself, but this could be a cute place to impress your spouse's grandparents.", "author": "Sophie W."}

We waited so long between getting refills on drinks, then on getting dishes cleared and again to get dessert menu. \nThen, before we asked for the check, we ordered some desserts to go. Another long wait. Check came and went. No desserts. When we asked he said he hadn't charged us for them yet. Seriously? We asked for them before we were given the check. \n\nJust frustrating. We came here at the request of my dad who was visiting from the east coast. He raved about this place from the last time he was here, 8 years ago. Sadly this visit was lacking.

America's oldest Italian restaurant will continue to live up to its reputation.\n\nI'm glad I used this opportunity on Labor Day to come to Fior D'Italia when it's less crowded.  Just had to call for reservations if I want to have a table.  A guy with a strong Italian accent on a phone wanted me to wait until 1 pm.  But from Michael who happens to be my waiter for the day, he told me it's Gianni, owner of Fior D'Italia.  I'm surprised!  Anyway, Michael is a good American gentleman who's easy to talk to, and took care of me, directed me to the table near the window, where I can watch customers coming into the restaurant.\n\nDon't you just love a fancy restaurant under San Remo Hotel?  A big enough interior space with some black and white paintings of the good old days at Barbara Coast, a big bar at the other side, banquet hall at the back, and some sweet rustic music to relax and enjoy.  The 500 lbs measuring scale outside the restaurant have never been used, but it's never shabby.\n\nThen it was time to choose what's on the small lunch menu.  I barely have a juicy steak since it's only good for dinner.  No need for alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages, Michael gave me free water refills.  Love a free big piece of crispy ciabatta bread drizzled with virgin olive oil, excluding vinegar.  Here are my three best dishes.\n\nFior Caesar Salad.  Fresh iceberg lettuce and crunchy croutons topped with Caesar dressing and cheese flakes was the easiest of the leafy green salads.  Picture perfect as it's been seen and tasted!\n\nLinguine with meatball.  How 'bout that?  A classic spaghetti & meatballs topped with tomato sauce.  No need for additional cheese flakes on a childhood favorite dish.  Everything was just right.  For those who are new to spaghetti, here's a chance to learn.  Fork into the noodles, twirl some until it becomes a yarn, and put them in your mouth (no slurping loudly).\n\nPanna Cotta with strawberry sauce.  A bit bigger and more satisfying than the original in a very cute small jar, this should be one of my favorite desserts.  Aside from a raspberry and few blueberries, mint leaves are truly edible.\n\nI wanted to come again \"Fior\" sure, but I have other eateries I be eager to go to.  I'm positive Fior D'Italia is doing an outstanding job.  Great to be back in the oldies.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

The restaurant was very busy when we arrived, but we were able to reserve a table for 5 on the same day.\n\nThe ambience is that of an old school Italian restaurant. It definitely felt more neighborly than touristy. If you're old enough, this restaurant could be romantic too. \n\nThey make fresh pasta, but I ended up ordering from the \"dry pasta\" section of the menu: Bucatini Amatriciana. Bucatini is my favorite pasta, but I was hesitant because why would I order something I make at home all the time? Was I wrong? I was very impressed by their Bucatini Amatriciana, and I was clearly the happiest one at the table. Most of their past dishes (fresh or dry), except for the ones with sea food, are only $17! See their dinner menu here: http://www.fior.com/dinner.\n\nI think this place is great for a family dinner. The ambience is just right (old school but not uptight). The food is great but reasonably priced. There are millions of ok to good Italian restaurants (i.e., 3~4 stars) in the US, but I think Fior d'Italia ranks above them in terms of the quality of food and service, the ambience, and last but not least the pricing.\n\n******************************\nIf you found something useful in my review, please hit \"useful\" so that I can improve my reviews.

It was pretty late on a Sunday, so we got right in--not sure if that would be true on other days. Quick, extremely friendly service. Our waiter suggested the rack of lamb, which was amazing. Tender, moist, and perfectly cooked. The sauce was bold, but did. It overpower the lamb (the same is true of the Rosemary seasoning). My wife and 5 year-old son split the cabbage soup and lasagne.\n\nAfter the lasagne came out (very large portion), she decided to stop eating the soup. It was delicious and rich, with cheese and bread, so she wanted to save room for the lasagne. My son declared it the \"best lasagne in the world\". He was probably right. Rich but with a strong enough tomato sauce that it didn't cling to the tongue too long.\n\nBefore bringing our dessert menu, the waiter cleared our table, and the manger (owner?) came over immediately to see if there was a problem with the soup. My wife explained it was just too much food, and he gave another opportunity and confirmed she shouldn't hold back. It was obvious how much he cared, which was great to see. \n\nThe service from the second we walked in the door to the second we left was superb. By far the best restaurant experience I can remember. The atmosphere, service, and food were all top notch, and it's very hard to find a place that does everything so spot-on.\n\nThank You!", "author": "Steve M."}

Think about it, it was on February of that year when Jesse and Frank James robbed their first bank in Liberty, Missouri!  \n\nFior d'Italia has moved around six times since its original opening day. Being a resident of North Beach, I remember the night in 2005 when the fire in their last location next to Washington Square Park forced them to eventually move to current location under the historic San Remo Hotel.\n\nThe food is delicious, so you can't do much wrong with your choices, but on this particular night we started with Cozze e Vongole con Vino e Aglio or Clams and mussels for appetizer which I washed down with a glass of perfectly mixed vodka martini (\"Shaken, not stirred\"!!). Delicious, although the juice was slightly too salty for my taste (must admit that I do not care much for salt!). For main course we had Pollo al Mattone (Half chicken flattened and roasted with rosemary and garlic) and Osso Buco con Polenta (Veal shank in stock, carrots, celery, onion and citrus rind served with polenta). I loved the Osso Buco, but must admit that the chicken was far more tasty than what I had hoped for! I mean it, it was delicious! Both entr\u00e9es came in healthy portions so we were full , but we decided to share an order of Pera Caramellata (Poached Pear with Cream & Caramel). It was heavenly! \n\nOur server was a young man who may have been a bit new at his job, and I found him to be a bit less attentive as I would have liked. For example, I put in a delayed order of a Pasta e Fagioli soup and asked if he could get it to me before the main course, he said he could, but then they all arrived together, so I had to return the soup. Not a big deal for me personally, but others may expect better service than that.\n\nAltogether, and excellent dining experience for both of us.", "author": "Afshin A."}

The location was great, parking was kin of hard depending on time and what day you go. We did get a bit confused going in as we went into the wrong door which was to the bar but we just had to walk over and get checked in. The restaurant was spacious and we were seated right away. \n\nFor starters we all shared a calamari basket, and a dozen oysters. The calamari was great and plentiful, definitely a lot to go around. It was cooked right and wasn't chew at all to my liking. The oysters were not the best, I've had better. Maybe because the oysters were HUGE, and I tend to like them smaller if I am going to eat them raw. I also didn't think I tasted as fresh as I thought, and then again its to my liking but I've def had better. \n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I ordered the seafood linguine, while my friends ordered the meatsauce over spaghetti, and some ordered the risotto. I have to say I was not a HUGE fan of the pasta either. I felt that my seafood was just throw in there and cooked, my pasta sauce tasted a bit watery and the pasta was over cooked. The risotto didn't even look like risotto, it looked like porridge and I couldn't taste anything. I have to say the meatsauce over spaghetti was good but that was probably the only thing. \n\nAll in all service was great, and food came out in a timely manner but I wasn't impressed and im a HUGE pasta fan.

After looking at a bunch of restaurants that mostly were seafood, we chose Fior D'Italia since it is Italian and you do have some choices of vegetarian food. The decor is very old school and laid back. In my opinion, it needs a bit of upgrade and maintenance. The floors creak when you walk and the carpet looked quite dirty. Apparently, it is one of the oldest Italian restaurants in the United States. Might as well hold the position high! \n\nOnce we were seated, we were served with some complimentary bread along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar that were already on the table. I'm not sure if the bread was supposed to be that way but it was quite rough in texture. We were in for some light dinner and chose Caesar salad and Tortellini alla Panna. I don't think there is any way to mess up the salad so it was nice but the Tortellini was very bland. My palate was craving for some spice and all I got was cheese!

That's because it was considered fancy eating for someone barely making enough to keep warm in a studio apartment. It used to be where Original Joe's is now across from Washington Square Park, but for the past decade, it's been up a few blocks on Mason in the San Remo Hotel. After passing by it, usually after a hearty meal at Albona around the corner, Jamie W. and I finally tried it just before Christmas, and it brought back warm memories of my penny-saving youth. The prices are still not bad by San Francisco standards.\n\nAnyway, we were seated toward the back of the dining room as a jazz ensemble was finishing up near the front window (photo: http://bit.ly/2j9z6XO). There was quite an audience of enraptured regulars singing and snapping along with the Christmas swing standards the band played. We enjoyed it from where we were but honestly focused primarily on the menu. A big hunk of rustic sourdough bread landed on our table which we surrounded with quite a pool of olive oil and red wine vinegar (photo: http://bit.ly/2imF1I5). For a starter, we didn't go wrong with the $16 Burrata con Pomodori Basilico e Olio (Burrata with Tomato, Basil and Virgin Olive Oil) (photo: http://bit.ly/2j9FBtr).\n\nVery fresh mozzarella surrounded by tomato slices and olives resting on basil leaves with a bit of frisee on top. Delicious. We also did well with our pasta entrees. Jamie had the $17 Tagliatelle alla Bolognese which was eggy with just the right amount of meat sauce to satisfy a true carnivore who would otherwise bypass the bistecca (photo: http://bit.ly/2ja9cU6). I went for the more luxuriant $17 Tortellini alla Panna stuffed with chicken and swimming a bit in lighter-than-expected cream sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2j3f9jq), Thank goodness we ordered the $12 Funghi di Selva Trifolati, a medley of three wild mushroom sauteed in olive oil, garlic, and parsley (photo: http://bit.ly/2imy0a6).\n\nI quickly mixed it up with the tortellini to enhance my dish (photo: http://bit.ly/2jm8rEM). We ended our meal with the $7 Tiramisu alla Schiuma. which is a mousse-style tiramisu served in a sundae glass and sprinkled with a bit of espresso powder (photo: http://bit.ly/2jGBnuv). With a straight cup of coffee (photo: http://bit.ly/2imHlPf), it provided just the right finale as the ensemble had already packed up and went home.

We left Bastille Day across from Ferry building craving Italian food. Started circling Washington square and as our distance from the the square got greater and greater I parked at first empty spot. While looking at yelp, I noticed an old looking building that appeared to be a bar or restaurant, If was both. I entered the wrong door as usual, a distinguished older gent in jeans and a blazer welcomed us and walked us to the dining room, it was packed. We were seated in a nice size table with a spare chair for my Panama hat(thank God). We ordered Caesar salad, calamari and Lasagna Bolognese. Service was excellent, food was good. My only complaint was the waiter kindly split our dish of lasagna but failed to mention the baking dish was 300 degrees.

But, it wouldn't be accurate.  \n\nFior has long been a north beach institution.  Long gone from its original location on Washington Square (where Original Joe's is now), there's no doubt they miss the old spot & the old days since relocating here.  We all do.\n\nThe good news is, while they lost the park view, they gained a special bar.  This bar is beautiful & loaded w SF history.  This is the San Remo Hotel building after all...w all that entails. \n\nBut, the best part might be film and rock & roll related.  Back in the 90's, a little movie about north beach was made.  It's aptly titled \"Little City,\" & it covered everything about the old north beach culture.  Chefs, bartenders, the roommate element, green chartreuse...everything.  The kicker?  It was in this restaurant space (before it was Fior) where they filmed the bartending scenes.  Right at this very bar.  \n\nThe real kicker?  Jon Bon Jovi starred as the bartender.  \n\nJon. Bon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-08", "description": "Saturday, July 30, 2017\nBetween 3:30 and 4 p.m.\n\nMy spouse O and I arrived at Fior d' Italia (Fd'I) after the 2 p.m. matinee of Beach Blanket Babylon. Since this was our first time at the new location on Mason, in fact, I didn't know until recently that Fd'I had reopened after the fire of 2005. As soon as I saw it is still in existence, I have been craving Spaghetti Amatriciana.\n\nMy introduction to the spicy Amatriciana sauce was twenty or more years ago when Fd'I was located on Washington Square. Amatriciana is what I ordered on my first visit to Fd'I and the only dish ordered there until the fire mentioned above. \n\nI love spicy food, and this sauce packed quite a punch. In fact, I was amazed that an Italian restaurant in California would serve a sauce so heavily laced with cayenne and pepper flakes. It turned my face a Marinara-red, and I had to wipe the sweat from my brow, but with my Cajun roots prevailing, I relished every bite. I've learned since that this sauce isn't always easy to find on the menus of other Italian restaurants, but when it was listed, nothing else on the menu matters, I know what I'm having. But I never found a restaurant that could satisfy my palate with a spicy Amatriciana like that from the kitchen of Fd'I.\n\nO and I  arrived for an early dinner, around 4:00 p.m. The jazz band was playing to a small but enthusiastic audience of diners. It was the lull between lunch and dinner. We were greeted and escorted to our table by a pleasant and swarthily attractive host. As we followed our dishy host,  I delighted in the sound of the creaking floors and live jazz. This restaurant occupies the ground floor of one of the city's oldest hotels, The San Remo, a proud Victorian Italianate, and I would have been extremely disappointed had the walk to our table been without creaks. Some of us cling desperately to the remaining charm in San Francisco, and this is the kind of Victorian splendor we find intoxicating.\n\nTo me, this space seemed brighter than the former Washington Square location, but it is certainly not without charm. On our visit, it was a gloriously sunny afternoon in North Beach, so the large window that looks out onto Mason behind Leon Oakley's band filled the dining room with light. \n\nAnother gorgeous, swarthy young man appeared with a big basket of bread. Paradiso! We found Paradiso! It was abundantly clear that we were in for a titillating dining experience. I didn't ask the young man's name because I'm far too old and way too shy so I'll call him, Roman. O and I each ordered the Venesia Martinis, aka Trixie's, from Roman off the House Cocktail Menu and proceeded to enjoy the bread.\n\nThe bread was exactly what I expect from an Italian restaurant: rustic, crispy crust and moist and flavorful inside. If you don't hear a sound and if it doesn't make a huge crumbly mess when you tear into Italian bread, well, just open a bag of Wonder and knock yourself out. Fd'I's pane hit the mark. Bull's Eye!\n\nOne sip of the Venezia Martini and O and I were hooked! It came with a slice of marinated pear that was, well, sublime. We asked Roman about the pear, he smiled (and what a smile) like he had heard this before and said we might want to try it later in a house-made dessert which turned out to be Pera Caramellata with Passito di Pantelleria. Roman could have sold me the Coliseum and a Ferrari factory-slash-garlic-farm in Gilroy. We had planned to switch to wine with our meal, but there was no way I wasn't going to order another Trixie and O felt the same.\n\nI was enjoying a bowl of Minestrone and O a Cesar Salad when Roman appeared, like a vision with 6 o'clock shadow, Bucatini Amatriciana in hand. I place an order for two more Trixies. Sorry, Bacchus.\n\nAnd the jazz played on.\n\nOkay, the Amatriciana was not as I remembered. It was far less spicy. But I believe this is because people with sensitive palates dismissed the descriptive word \"spicy\" on the menu, ordered it then after the first bite, likely complained, some fainted and some, I suspect sued. So, of course, they had to tone it down. But it was still better than I'd had at other restaurants.  Next time, I'll ask Roman if he can crank the heat up a notch or two and I'm sure he'll accommodate.\n\nDessert: Pera Caramellata with Passito di Pantelleria. Have it!\n\nWhat a marvelous dining experience. The service, the music, the food and the cocktails, the seven o'clock shadow, the decor and the history... Fior d' Italia remains my favorite Italian restaurant in the city.\n\nCheck it out. Buon appetito! \n\nGrazie, Roman!", "author": "Julian J."}

The bread was actually very good but the Pasta fajole was disappointing and not to my liking. \n\nWe waited about 25 mins for our main course and I noticed that the waiter Gil was not as friendly to us and not focusing at all on our table like he was other parties. He was always busy attending to the other tables and it seemed like we were almost not there. I don't know if it was because we were the only party of 2 (not as big of a bill) and all the other tables had at least 4 or more people so he didn't want to spend time on us (bigger tip). Because of this we were constantly waiting for drinks and even got our food after others who we ordered before. When we finally got our food the waiter asked if we wanted fresh Parmesan, we said yes and he took about 10 mins to bring it because he decided to take a large tables drink order and bring them their drinks before bringing us the cheese for our pasta that was getting cold..SMH.\n\nI ordered the spinach pasta with peas and it was actually very light and fresh tasting. I enjoyed the plate but don't plan on returning. The service is just as important as the food and when the service is this poor it really ruins the experience.", "author": "Juliana J."}

Sat down and was immediately brought water, olive oil and balsamic. Waiter was efficient and came to take our drink order in a timely manner. While we waited, warm bread slices were placed on our bread plates. Our appetizers and salad came out within 15 - 20 minutes. The prosciutto wrapped melon was delicious, the saltiness of the ham with the sweet melon was heaven. Then the burrata was fresh and yummy even if the tomatoes were cold and out of season.  Our entrees were the roasted half chicken and veal shank with polenta. Both were delicious and so filling. Our waiter was quick to ask if we needed anything. The manager came over to ask how our meal was, all in all delicious food. \n\nCons- when we got out slice of bread, we never was asked if we wanted another, even as we watched the server come around and ask other tables. The chicken entree was hot, the veal shank was pretty warm, but the polenta was cold and flavorless. Even with salt and pepper it was only delicious as a vehicle for the veal and the delectable sauce. And I love polenta!!! Our server was pleasant but overly efficient. When we were finished with our entrees but wanted to take the rest to go, he swept our plates off before we could explain we wanted to take the rest. He asked if we were finished and if the plates should go back.... when we said yes, he collected the plates before we even got a chance to say wait. He was very pleasant but rarely made eye contact and we felt rushed through our meal. We were in and out in 45 minutes, when we wanted to have a nice leisurely meal at a genuine Italian restaurant. \n\nAll in all, I would go back, but knowing what to expect. And perhaps speak up more. The food is delicious, just don't expect super warm and inviting service from your server.", "author": "Heather R."}

Went in for my 21st birthday and we had reservations for our group at 9:15 but what they didn't tell us was that the kitchen closes at 9:30. The moment we walked in the waiter was very rude. Pressuring us to order and making snide comments. The waiter stood over one of my guests as he was reading the menu and was reminding us that the kitchen was closing in 2 minutes. He was incredibly rude, probably the worse service I've ever received. The food was not awful but I have had better. The gnocchi was squishy and overdone. When the check came the waiter didn't ask to split it, he put the whole check on one bill and notified us that the 20% tip was included. When we paid part with cash and part with card he POCKETED THE CASH AS EXTRA TIP, and then charged the rest of the bill to the cards. When we talked to the manager he was not apologetic or helpful whatsoever. The whole ordeal was frustrating, time consuming, and disrespectful. Would not go again.", "author": "Alora B."}

Everything that came out looked stellar and everything we got was quite good. I had the steak, it was prepared perfectly and served with a nice sauce. My fiance had the lasagna- the sauce was phenomenal. We shared the burrata salad. While the cheese was great quality, there could have been a bit more for $16. Presentation was nice on all the dishes. \nThe space is lovely. Old and beautiful with lots of windows and tables that are not too close together. Soft music, nice lighting. Fair prices overall, IMO\n\nThat's the good. What was just ok? The service. They seemed a bit busy but the service did not give the idea of fine dining that is boasted on their website. It wasn't bad, but it was minimal. No lobby, so people waiting are standing in the dining room.\n\nThe bad? I pay attention to the details. Ladies room needed attention. Front door left open leaving us a little too cold. Glassware set on our table was dirty. Lipstick. On multiple glasses. That shakes my confidence in the cleanliness of a place. One glass? OK. 2 or more..eww. Finally, though it seems that the locals that frequent the place are get that this is a nicer restaurant, it is close enough to the Wharf that there are tourists that show up with 3 messy kids and a screaming baby looking like they just got out of a hot yoga class. Not the restaurants fault but when you are paying $50+ pp, having kids going in and out of the restaurant and a wailing baby is a no go.\n\nWe might try this place again but it is not on the top of our list.", "author": "Disco B."}

I actually ate my entire half, a rarity since I have a very dainty appetite. I think I requested extra bread (which, BTW is delicious and hearty) to sop up the remaining sauce.\n\nI broke my toe yesterday and the cocktails were the perfect painkillers.

My dad and I got the clams and mussels as our starter which was amazing. A little pricey for the amount given, so I'm not quite sure I would get it again.

It was established in 1886 and is still around, so they had to be doing something right. We were able to make last minute reservations on a Saturday night and received a nice table. \n\nAmbiance:\nWhite tablecloth tables in a large dining room, which was connected to another room that had a nice bar with the local Warriors game on the TV. You could tell the place had character, with photos dating back to decades ago. There were lots of large parties and the staff seemed to know some of the guests, which made the environment very welcoming. \n\nService:\nThe staff starting from the host to the server to the bus boys were all pleasant. Our server was friendly, energetic, and took all our requests with a smile. However, some gripes I have are that it took almost 10 minutes once we sat down to have someone come to our table to greet us, pour some water, and ask for drinks. Also, throughout the meal our server did not come check in on us from the time we got our food to when we were pretty much finished. Not a huge deal because we were not in dire need of anything, but it would have been frustrating if we were trying to track them down for something. \n\nFood:\nFor appetizers, we ordered a Caesar salad paired with the garlic bread bruschetta topped with heirloom tomatoes. They were both stellar and I would definitely get them again. The two entrees we ordered were the lasagna bolognese and tri-color pasta mix (penne pesto, tortellini stuffed with chicken, potato gnocchi). The lasagna bolognese was fresh out of the oven and just as I would expect with lots of flavor and extremely filling. The other pasta plate left you wanting more. The flavors were a bit bland, but of the 3 choices the penne pesto was the tastiest. \n\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall we had a good experience. I wish the entrees were more flavorful, however, the appetizers were great and the service left us satisfied. I'd be curious to see how their other entrees taste, which means I'd try this place out again if given the choice.", "author": "Michael S."}

The last time we were there, we parked far, far away in a different zip code because there was no parking available.  Then when we arrived to the restaurant, my daughter was frightened to see a waitress that looked just like her dreaded 4th grade math teacher.  So, when Fior d'Italia was recommended to me as a good Italian restaurant, I knew that I would have to bring my family.  \n\nParking was a cinch!  We found a parking spot across the street from the restaurant.  I had made reservations at 7:30 PM.  The restaurant was located in a small hotel.  We walked in and were seated immediately.  It was a nice comfortable place.  We ordered a Calamari in Cesta for the daughter.  My wife ordered a Linguine con Vongole, and I ordered the Linguine con Polpette.  \n\nThe Calamari in Cesta came out first.  The calamari was served inside a coffee filter, and came with a lemon, cocktail and tartar sauce.  The Calamari was very good.  My wife and I had to rescue the daughter from ingesting too much cholesterol inducing squid.  The Linguine Con Vongole was another winner.  It was made with fresh clams.  The sauce was perfect.  My wife enjoyed it and almost did not want to share it with me.  The Linguine con Popette was also good.  It came with tomato sauce and two meatballs.  The meatballs were different.  They looked more like flying saucers; like someone had sat on my meatballs.  But, I liked it.  \n\nService was good throughout our meal.  They refilled our glasses with water and frequently checked up on us.  Even the host (manager?) came to check up on us.  \n\nFior d'Italia is a nice place!  I like it.

We found the positive Yelp reviews to be a good sign, and the staff were quick to reply to our inquiry for a group reservation. The process of selecting menus beforehand was fairly straightforward, too, and it was conveniently located a few minutes' drive from our family's hotel in Fisherman's Wharf. We'd also inquired about another place, but they didn't allow group bookings on weekends. \n\nThe entrees and service were great! Someone (maybe a manager, or owner) came by to visit with us and congratulate us, and the ordering process was quite simple. We chose the smallest menu (caesar salad, basic entree, dessert/coffee) and figured we would order wine and other drinks to get to their food and beverage minimum. The other banquet menu options have more courses and more entree options-- I would've preferred more entree options within the fewer courses. \n\nMy biggest issue was that the private room is bisected by the path to the kitchen, so every dish going out into the main room passed through ours. All that traffic on a busy Saturday night made us feel in the way trying to talk with family and friends at the other tables in the room. The staff did the best they could to be courteous about it, but it detracted from the ambiance of a 'private' room a bit. There may be other private rooms in the place, but from the banquet menu I got the impression they are for larger groups than ours. \n\nOther minor issues: \n-very few (I think just one, a pesto rigatoni?) vegetarian options for banquet menus. \n-caesar salad was SWIMMING in dressing. The lettuce was soggy, dressing too salty.

The service was rude. Had to return a glass of wine, they didn't apologize that we didn't like it, instead said the bottle has just been opened. From then the waiter was even more rude. The food was uninspired and way to expensive for what it was. This place reminds me of a bad Italian restaurant from the 1970's. Not a fine restaurant, more like a diner for tourists serving unrefined pastas plates for $17. The appetizer would have too much coleslaw without vinaigrette, a burnt bacon/shrimp and a tomato slice of poor quality that has no flavor at all. Cold atmosphere where you feel the waiter doesn't care at all since probably only tourists come and never return to such terrible \"wannabe Italian\" restaurant.", "author": "Claire M."}

We serendipitously enjoyed a relaxing lunch with very prompt and friendly service and what we came for: tons of carbs! The pesto and pine nut pasta was superb, and the bolognese just hit the spot.

They were nice enough to bring us two in sauce and even extra bread for he incredible sauce. Meatballs had a silky texture- just fantastic. I had the incredible ravioli di zucca and HIGHLY recommend it. The homemade pasta is heavenly and that butter sauce had just the right amount of salt to contrast the sweetness of the pumpkin. We also had the tagliatelle bolognese and the tortellini al pana. The bolognese was rich and hearty and the homemade pasta is just so much better than dried.

The waiter who served us seemed a bit confused and didn't speak much English but was very attentive with refilling our waters and clearing our dishes, even though the restaurant was full. \n\nWe started with cocktails.

My friend had the Torino Martini ($11) which had Citron Vodka, Punt & Mes, and Orange Zest. Also strong and very satisfying. A+ on the cocktails!\n\nFor appetizers we ordered the Caesar Salad ($7) and Roasted Potatoes ($7). The salad was soaked in dressing (maybe a little too much) but was flavorful and filling. The potatoes (cut into the shape of rounds) were good but the fact that they were sitting in a giant puddle of olive oil was not very appealing.\n\nOnto the entr\u00e9es. I'm generally a huge fan of Pumpkin Ravioli so I ordered the Ravioli di Zucca ($16) which is pasta stuffed with pumpkin, amaretti and mustard fruit with a butter, pinenuts and sage sauce. YUM! I would totally get this again. The saltiness of the sage sauce had a surprisingly delightful contrast to the sweetness of the pumpkin. Plus the crunchiness of the pinenuts adds a nice variety of texture.\n\nMy friend got the Linguine con Polpette ($16) which is linguine, tomato sauce, and meatballs. The meatballs were impressive!

Finally made it.\nThey have had several locations and are currently on the main floor of the San Remo Hotel.\n\nI was extremely surprised by the food. Not that I didn't expect good food, but this was very good.\nWe had a group of 10 and they put us in our own little room which was great because we were kind of loud.\nWe started off with the Prosciutto con Frutta di Stagione for appetizers which was very fresh, very good.\nI had the New York steak and the sauce it was covered in was amazing. My wife had the Salmon which was equally good.\nI didn't look at the wine list as someone else ordered the wine but what we had was very good.\n\nThe service was perfect. This has to be a go to next time we are in San Francisco.", "author": "Jeff C."}

Timely and friendly.  \n\nSecond, my wife started out with a cocktail that, if you wanted to just get drunk, would have been impressive.  It was loaded with alcohol but lacked taste.\n\nAs for the meals, she had the prawns wrapped in pancetta for an app.  It was tasted though the shrimp looked old.  I had the prosciutto and melon.  the melon was fine but eh prosciutto was not fresh.  it looked dark and was dry tasting.  \n\nFor dinner my wife had the pouched salmon.  it did not look fresh, was soaked in water and ultimately was tasteless.  The potatoes were good but the green bean were soaked in oil.  I had the tagliatelle with the bolognese sauce.  While it was dry, the taste was fine. The one main problem i had is in almost all italian restaurants they come table side to see if you want cheese on the dish.  i am not a fan of the cheese so i skip it.  this place just loaded it on.  took me a while to clean it off.\n\nfinally the dessert was not impressive.  My wife had the mousse and it was closer to a cake then mousse.  It was dry.  I had the berries and cream and it looked like berries in a cup of milk, no real tasted was added due to the cream (they would be better for using whip cream).\n\nSo for the price, it was not worth the investment plus the ambiance is not present.  Just feels like an old place that needs infusion.", "author": "Tim F."}

I got the Ravioli with meat sauce as it was the plate he recommended. It was very delicious and tasted homemade and original. Not the biggest fan of ravioli but I have to say I liked it so much I will come by when I'm the area. The portion isn't the biggest and at a moment I thought I wouldn't get full but I was wrong. My bf had their pesto pasta with grilled chicken and I gave his chicken breast a quality check and it was very flavorful, he wasn't a big fan of the angel hair but he said as far as flavor went it was good.

The place was pretty empty at 6pm on Saturday, but the bar was lively.\n\nFirst off, this place had really good bread, olive oil and vinegar.  Very Italian.\n\nWe ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Out come four tasty, but very salty, large shrimp.  \n\nNext, I order the veal with polenta and veggies.  The veal was very tender and tasty, but again, very salty.  This time, it wasn't too bad because the polenta was a little bland so mix them together and it masks the saltiness of the veal.\n\nFor dessert, we had the cooked pudding, which was bland, but the sauce was good.\n\n\nThe service was very good and the waiter was funny without being awkward.\n\nThere were some flies buzzing around, but only because they keep the doors open.", "author": "Richard T."}

That's a good sign right!?? Usually, yes, but the tables were long banquet style set up and we realized it was a HUGE Birthday party.  I thought. We will wait forever for service and food... Wrong on both counts.  My husband and I and teenage daughter couldn't have been treated better.  We are given a wonderful table away from the crowd and I have to say the service was impeccable.

That's paying attention folks!  \nGil was our primary waiter and had great suggestions throughout the meal from apps, wine and dessert !  Started with appetizer of grilled shrimp, prosciutto wrapped melon, tomato and mozzarella slices. Wonderful start!  Hubby had rack of lamb. Cooked \"super rare\", just as requested!  I had the steak ( again perfectly cooked) with the grappa sauce..  delish. Daughter had the 1/2 chicken and said she couldn't stop eating it was sooo good! Ordered a salad and side of saut\u00e9ed spinach for the table as well.  Finished with the non traditional tiramisu ( that we didn't have room for),but scrapped the dish clean in seconds.\nThe owner was watching the floor and the kitchen ,I suspect, to make sure all was well.

I am not sure what the name means in English, but I assume it is Italian for \"Terrible Service\".  The food was good, but it seemed that since we ordered from the low end of the menu & did not order wine or drinks we were more of an inconvenience than a valuable guest. \n\nI was drinking only water (due to a health issue). I politely asked the waiter twice, over a ten to fifteen minute period, for additional water. He acknowledged me on both occasions, but water never came. I had also asked for additional bread during this time, but I guess my allotment was 1 slice. \n\nWhen I told the waiter my concerns he got huffy and hurried off. I spoke with the manager to let him know of my concerns. He listened, but I am not sure I feel he really gets it. \n\nBy the way, when I order water, I normally tip 25 to 30% to offset the missing drink.", "author": "Glenda B."}

This restaurant is at corner (I can't remember the street names but you can find the cross streets under the address). Anyway, location  appearance . In fact it was very nice. Well put together. There were only 3 other tables being served at the time and we got their at about lunch time. It was a nice, clean, peaceful environment. And very elegant yet it had a casual feel.\nPRICE: was a bit up their. But it was worth it for the high quality food \nFOOD: They serve you sliced bread while you wait to order. And that bread was delish!  Both mine and my husbands meals were terrific! (see posted pic of our meals and prices) Keep in mind that I'm not experienced in Italian cuisine and the closest to authentic Italian food that i have tasted is from bucca or macaroni grill, so go ahead, take my review with a grain of salt  but, to me, this place was by far the best Italian food i have ever had! I was going to get a sandwich but the waiter suggested a pasta being that pasta is their specialty. glad i took his advice.\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: Our waiter was a young guy but don't let his age fool you. He was actually professional, kind, attentive, helpful with suggested menu items and kept a good balance of decent convo that didn't get obnoxious or desperately obvious if he was trying to up his tip. He also was the only server for all 4 tables and came to our table often. We never had to ask for refilled drinks, he brought our food when it was nice and hot and frequently checked on us and the other tables.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-21", "description": "Where Italian food is concerned, people have different likes and dislikes. It's not easy to keep everyone happy.  In my humble opinion that's why many of these TV programs featuring restaurant \"makeovers\" involve Italian restaurants.  I think that Italian chefs use recipes handed down for generations and have very personal touches.  If you order dish \"A\" in a place and order the same thing in another place, they may have the same core ingredients but the flavor palette may be entirely different.\n\nI have a friend who thinks genuine \"Italian\" food starts and stops with spaghetti and meatballs.  The Fior D'Italia doesn't eschew those \"American staples\" but has enough variety to suit anyone and everyone.  I went there the other night for the first time since Chef Gianni took over the place and reopened (hence I'm treating this as a new review rather than an update).    Service was spot on attentive, bread hot and water glasses filled and coffee replenished.  I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  I was impressed by the fact that one of our party, a vegetarian, was able to get a \"special\" dish just by asking the waiter (Donny) politely if it was possible.  No problem.\n\nI always read the bad reviews just to get a sense of how a place clicks.  I noticed many were because some coupons from a few years back aren't redeemable under the new owner.   I remember the old owner - a heck of a nice fellow but  prone to giving out coupons and free dinners (I had a free dinner there myself several years ago).  That may be patriotic or civic minded but it impacts negatively on the bottom line.  Personally I would never expect a coupon more than a year old to be honored and don't think anyone else should either.  Kudos to Chef Gianni for trying to make things right  with people that do try to use them.\n\nI had a mixed green salad for starters and the saltimbocca (literally jumps in your mouth) for the main course.  The presentation was excellent and the taste was very exquisite.  This dish could be very bland in the hands of an unskilled chef but Gianni's kitchen did a outstanding job.  There were some potatoes and asparagus to complete the dish - not so much as to waste but definitely enough to satisfy.  My wife had the veal chop (Cotoletta alla Piemontese) and it was huge.  My companions had the vegetarian \"special\" and a chicken dish (Petto di Pollo) respectively.  I didn't sample any of their food but I noticed that very little if any was left on their respective plates.  I declined dessert but one of them ordered a chocolate gelato and let us have a taste.  If you like chocolate ice cream, you will love chocolate gelato.\n\nThe Ambiance was classy but comfortable and pleasant.  It's upscale but doesn't over do it.  Staff was attentive and friendly.  The food was hot, tasty and delicious.  The menu has been cut back from what it was but that's a good thing as it allows them to focus.  The bar seems to be a local neighborhood hangout.  I understand they serve finger food but I didn't try any so my  comments are based on my experience.  The menu is Northern \"Italian\" style with pasta, soup and salad courses  separate items on the menu.\n\nFor a special  treat and a wonderful meal, Fior D'Italia can't be beat.  Thanks Gianni!  I'll be back!", "author": "Robert H."}

I'm giving this place 2 stars only because the servers were very friendly, however the food deserves 1 star. \n\nI got the Ravioli de Zucca, a pumpkin ravioli and My boyfriend the Tortellini alla pana, essentially chicken stuffed tortellini. The food came out fast, perhaps a little too fast. Made me instantly think freezer to microwave, yuck. My dish was incredibly bland, which surprised me since the description on the menu made it sound incredibly flavorful. The sauce had no flavor and the ravioli tasted like they had stuffed it with canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e, minus any flavoring or seasoning. My boyfriends dish was also bland, leaving him to season the heck out of it with the salt and pepper at our table. Needless to say, for about $16 bucks a plate I was expecting a lot more. It was a waste of money and a disappointment. \n\nIf you're looking for a restaurant to explore in San Francisco, probably ask the locals and make sure to avoid this place, it's not worth the bill.", "author": "Jen L."}

They accommodated our group -- we were doing our dinner on a Wednesday night -- in the private Assisi Room so they would not be bothered by the live jazz during their dinner.  We pre-ordered appetizers so that they would be on the table when the guests arrived.\n\nWe walked to the restaurant from our hotel and we were taken back immediately to the private room.  We had two wonderful servers who greeted us right away, and the cold appetizers were already on the table.  Within minutes, they brought out the warm appetizers.  The wine selection was great, the food was wonderful, and the service was terrific.  All the directors returned from the restaurant and had rave reviews!  \n\nThis is also a great local neighborhood hangout -- saw lots of locals (and their dogs -- awesome) hanging out for the great happy hour.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-15", "description": "My son and I had lunch here on October 9. It was the best meal we had during our stay in San Francisco. It was the day of the Italian Heritage Parade (aka Columbus Day) in North Beach. We were staying at a hotel near Chinatown and didn't even know there was a parade/festival scheduled that day (which was fantastically energetic and fun and ended up being one of my favorite experiences). For whatever reason my 16 year old was just determined to get to Fisherman's Wharf and not interested in the whole festival/parade experience going on in North Beach. Anyway, once we got to the Wharf I think he finally realized how touristy it was so he was more amenable to walking back through North Beach. We decided to go up Mason for a late lunch and found Fior d'Italia. We decided to dine outside and it was lovely. Michael, our server, was fantastic. It was pretty slow when we arrived, but within the next hour the outside tables became completely occupied. Having waited tables I know it can be a challenge when the restaurant gets busy but he handled everything admirably.\n\nThe food was perfect. Both my son and I adore linguine with clams; would have been more interesting for us to order different dishes but we both had to have the clams. Our Caesar salads came first; they were perfect. There is something about Caesar salad dressing that certain Italian restaurants that I'm always trying to recapture at home; I haven't been able to do it. It's definitely the anchovies but there's something more to it. The bread served at the table ... yum. Extremely fresh, very crusty on the outside with just the right amount of elasticity and chew on the inside. We broke the loaf off in pieces and dipped it into olive oil with a little balsamic. So simple, but with such good ingredients so yummy.\n\nThe pasta was a hit. The clams were served in the shell and the sauce was on point. I did think the clams were a bit on the small size, but it was a generous portion and the clams were very sweet. Perfectly seasoned.\n\nAfter the meal Kyle ordered a cappuccino which was so pretty to look at it I was kinda sad he had to drink it! He said it was delicious. There was so much froth on it you could make a huge mustache with it if that's your thing.\n\nThe overall vibe of the place was a lot of fun. It's very tastefully appointed with tablecloths, heavy china, etc. but we weren't made to feel uncomfortable in our flip flops and casual dress. Their Sunday jazz ensemble started up while we were eating and it was a nice accompaniment. \n\nMy only quibble is that when the bill arrived we were charged for the dinner price when we had ordered off the lunch menu. However, when I pointed this out to the manager he was very apologetic and rectified the bill immediately. I do think this was just a simple error and not an intentional effort to overcharge. Again, a shout out to Michael the waiter - polite and efficient - a l'il different from our Chinatown experiences (and I'm Chinese). Will definitely make a point of returning next time we're in town!", "author": "Renee N."}

When you enter a nice restaurant, you anticipate the welcome. No one, was present at the front desk for--just a while too long. There were only a few of us seated. Yet, we had to wait much too long to receive the customary attention. Our server, though not young, did not demonstrate the skills of a seasoned server. He was quick to dash off, without attempting to guide us through the menu, or really listen to our questions. As with our previous experience, this time, the food was not memorable. Fortunately, the bread was still great. My husband had a white fish of the day, which was overall, good. I had seafood, which was average. The side vegetables were below average, especially the overly cooked and soggy potatoes. To finish, we ordered the cr\u00e8me caramel. What we received was basically a flan. We love flan, but not at an Italian restaurant. Also worth mentioning, during our first experience, we dined at night. The daylight, however, cast light on the need for updating  or refreshing this once, grand historical restaurant. For the price ($$$), better cuisine and service was in order.

This was my parties first time going here and the waiter definitely recommended that we get the thanksgiving dinner which was 50 dollars per person. Worst decision! Had a group of seven and we each paid around 87 dollars (tip included because we had 7 people but definitely did not deserve tip). \n\nFood 1.5/5:\nThe food consisted of a halibut cake appetizer, pumpkin ravioli, turkey, and pumpkin pie. From reading the menu and reviews, I expected a better menu or more choices. However, our waiter told us that this was the food to get. \n\nThe meal began with a big piece of bread. Who doesn't like bread? But the problem was they gave us a huge piece of bread and did not tend to our order until literally 45minutes later. By the time, I got my meal I was already half full from the bread. We asked our waiter on multiple occasions that we were ready to order. Around the 20minute mark we flagged him again but he said \"No, you finish your bread and I will come back later.\" Although it was taken as a joke and their were really short laughs, he literally left our table and didn't take our order. We felt that this was very rude when we were hungry. Finally, after flagging him down again, he took our orders. \n\nThe halibut cake was just a simple deep-fried fish dish. Nothing amazing, I rather order another appetizer than eat this. Very plain tasting.\n\nPumpkin Ravioli:\noh wow, never ate something so horrible in my life.  Basically ravioli with pumpkin filling. The taste was horrible. I love pumpkin but this seriously did not suit my taste. Basically eating pumpkin pie but worst because its in a ravioli dish. Literally, no one finished their 4 pieces of ravioli. \n\nTurkey meal:\nUsually turkey is hard to cook so I will give them credit for making it edible. But nothing special. Just simple turkey with gravy. \n\nPumpkin Pie:\nOnce again, just a simple pie you can buy at costco or make yourself.\n\nService 0/5:\nAs mention before, waiter was horrible. The waiter also did not know anything about their wine menu. We asked him which one he recommended. His answer was \"they are all good.\" He also had to come back multiple times because he did not know which wine we ordered (almost gave us the 400 dollar wine).

We ate at an odd time when the restaurant was virtually empty, so it was just a little awkward.  We had a reservation from OpenTable but I'm not sure they really acknowledged that I had a reservation since I obviously didn't need one - yet they initially tried to seat us at a table for 2 with plenty of 4-tops available.  We asked to move and they accommodated that pleasantly.  Service was pretty good (Israel).  Only one minor issue, which was handled really smoothly.  We had ordered the Caesar salad but they brought out the entrees before the salad.  No issue, thankfully, when we reminded our server about the salad, he made it right and when the entrees arrived, they were hot.  So no problem there at all, he just forgot.  The pancetta-wrapped shrimp appetizer was excellent. There was even a slight char (which I liked a lot) on the outside.  The shrimp were large and flavorful and fresh. The sauce was really good too, we used it with the bread, which I also thought was excellent, soft on the inside and a nice crust on the outside.  Plenty of oil and balsamic if you are interested, on the table.  Caesar salad was ok not great, but not bad.  I got the Paglia e Fieno con Fieslli, which was outstanding.  Really nice creamy tomato sauce, and really fresh tasting pasta.  Nice peas, too.  I actually finished it, which I don't do that often with pasta dishes.  My wife got the Tagliatelle Bolognese, which was very good in flavor, just a tad off in texture but overall very good (she thought it was just a little on the dry side).

A couple of TV screens available if you want to keep up on the local teams - who doesn't?  The restaurant is beautiful and has adorable outside tables.  Part of a quaint hotel which adds to the lovely ambience and adds charm!   LOVE this place and can't wait to go back!  Super friendly shorter guy behind the bar whose name I didn't catch greeted and bid farewell to his guests with a warm hug in true Italian style!

My impressions upon leaving the restaurant are the following: the food is just \nokay, nothing special here. If you prefer a more lively atmosphere I would \nnot suggest dining here. My dish ( risotto ) was under cooked and bland. \nMy girlfriend ordered penne but got ziti. The bread was very good but I had to ask the waiter for butter, strange. There are better restaurants to choose from in the area and I'd suggest personally stopping by rather then just reading the reviews on Yelp exclusively.", "author": "Ralph E."}

We drove by to show our now adult kids \"where it all began\". We pulled up and saw that Fior D'Italia had relocated where the old restaurant had been. I had enjoyed Fior years ago at it's original location near St Peter and Paul church. So we had an early dinner with other tourists in shorts and sweatshirts. I was surprised there were about six or eight groups eating at 5:30 pm. \n\nI had the osso bucco which was done perfectly. My wife had the chicken with prosciutto that was delicious. The meat sauce was as close to my homemade as I have had since Patsy's in Manhattan. \n\n  My only criticism was the meatballs my daughter had. It may be authentic or their preference but it in my opinion. It was over seasoned with (I think) sage. It was just too strong a flavor for all of us (we all tasted it). In fairness to them we didn't complain. We had plenty to eat. \n\nPeaceful location between North Beach chaos and Fisherman's wharf. \n\nSurprised valet parking was around $10.", "author": "Dave D."}

Given that my grandparents had held onto the business card from their visit 15+ years ago, I had high hopes. And they were met. The food was excellent, particularly the chicken tortellini my husband had. We also really liked the still steaming bread that was served while we waited for the entree. \nWhat I was particularly impressed with was how the host treated us. We wandered in off the street, not dressed fancy in the least, and the host was extra engaged with us, when I expected the opposite. He stopped by multiple times, and was very friendly and engaging.

The staff was very friendly and the food was good. The first thing that kinda through me off was when they served the bread I asked for some garlic to put in my olive oil for dipping and he said I could not have any because it would insult the chef. Which I thought it was a little strange when it is only for dipping. Then when my seafood pasta came out we asked for Parmesan cheese he said we could not have any. I have never been refused either of those items at any Italian restaurant I have been to. We then had desert which was the Tiramisu and a pudding with fruit on top. The desert was delicious. \n\n   Then our check came. I gave the sever my coupon. He looked at it and said that I could not use it. I was very upset about it so he took it to the manager to see if I could use it. He came back with the manager and the manager said that he does not have to take because that they changed ownership. So we went around and around about this coupon. He told me that he would give me a little off my bill. I said whatever and do what you gotta due with a pissed off attitude from me. He then came back and gave me a better discount which made me a little happier. It was a little to much drama over this coupon that should have never happen. It was a Monday night and there was mane a quarter filled up. I explained to the manager that he should be happy that people are coming in to use there coupon because it brings in business that you would normally have. I think it is a great promotion idea from the previous owner. The coupon was good only from Monday through Thursday for food only.My advise to people that have this coupon is to not even waste your time and try to use it there unless you want to battle with the manager.

The decor is something you would expect for a hotel restaurant of that vintage. We decided to bring our own wine since it was one of our favorites I expected them to decant the wine but they did not.\n We ordered the Calamari. It came out hot and crisp as we like it the dipping sauces were good just not enough of them.\nWe ordered ceaser salads which seem to take a long time to get to the table. There were 4 things that went wrong with this course. The salads were much overdressed to the point of making them soggy: The Parmesan cheese was grated instead of shaved or shredded like most restaurants; the croutons were almost nonexistent and we were not offered and fresh ground black pepper. I thought that maybe they did not have the pepper but I saw our same severer offer it to the table next to us.\nThe salad cost $8 romaine lettuce is cheap. They need to step it up and offer a better product.\nWe ordered our entrees. My wife ordered the Tutto Mare which comes with a red sauce she asked if they could change it to a white wine garlic sauce .There was no issue with this and she was happy with the dish overall. \nI wish I could have said the same about my dish. I ordered the Tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce. This was supposed to be fresh pasta. I could not tell since it was in a big ball on plate the covered with some very plain tasting sauce. After the first bite I sent it back and ordered the ravioli with the same sauce equally unexciting. I was hungry so I ate.\nThe bright spot was they brought my wife a dish of Tiramisu. I know it is San Francisco and it cost a bit more to eat out but I expect and bit better.\nBTW- After spending over 100.00 there was no one at the hostess stand to say goodbye or ask us was everything OK.The guy who seated us(Lolo) was setting at the bar feeding his face.", "author": "Al S."}

These guys nearly fell over themselves to seat us. They were genuinely happy to have us as customers.  The staff there were clearly REAL Italians and the food was what I consider to be traditional but well done Italian, not fusion. Big groups in there for birthdays and bachelor parties - so noise level was high and raucous. Bread was delicious. They give you one piece at a time - which actually works because I would have eaten more. I am vegetarian and so my choices were a gnocchi (I was hoping to dave myself for dessert), a couple risottos, a polenta, salads or the vegetable of the day. I opted for the vegetable of the day. The waiter seemed utterly perplexed. Just the vegetables? But I was saving myself for cannoli. Which was very good and very traditional. Which means rich and good with the citron in the recipe. Wine selection good. Mural on the wall was hysterical and oh-so-Italian (my mother is Italian and she LOVES murals...and fake plants and columns...I digress.)  I would go back and I would be very happy there trying the other vegetarian dishes. \n\nWait. Maybe I'd try the gnocchi. I'd have to eat an apple for lunch. \n\nPrices were pretty well SF standard.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-28", "description": "As an Italian American, it pains me to write this review.\nMy wife and I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary so we looked long and hard to find just the right restaurant to eat at for this very special evening.  I advised the restaurant when I made the reservations about our anniversary and requested that if there were anything they could do to make this as special an evening as our marriage has been, we'd really appreciate it.  \nApparently they didn't get the message....  :-(\nWe were seated at a small 2 top directly against a wall near the back next to a long table of a dozen people that included at least 4-5 children running around the table and making a LOT of noise for a white linen restaurant.  The noise of the kids made others in the room have to raise their voices to be heard which created as loud an eating experience as we've ever had.  \nThe noise isn't what I'm upset about...it's the fact that we were sat directly next to them when there were plenty of other tables available and this was supposed to be our romantic anniversary dinner.\nThe rest of our evening WAS in the control of the staff and it was terrible.  The main source of our problem was the waiter: A young, dark haired man with a small ponytail/man-bun (there was only one so there should be no issue with the owners knowing who I'm referring to).\nHe came by to get our drink order, then came back with the drink to ask if we were ready to order.  I said I was not.  He then explained that they were out of quite a few items on their menu....then asked again what we wanted with a very rushed look on his face (as in \"hurry up and order\").  My wife definitely felt pressured to and ordered lasagna....I ordered veal scallopini.  \nA waiter came by and dropped a piece of bread on our plates.  I was interested in getting butter to go with it....so I waited and waited to have any member of the staff come near us so I could ask for butter but NO ONE came by until they dropped off our dinners.\nOur man bun waiter NEVER came back....until he dropped off the bill.  We saw the ma\u00eetre d across the room rip him a new one for screwing up someone's order which gave us a good idea why we weren't getting ANY service.\nWe finished eating and pushed our plates to the middle of the table and waited.....and waited.....and waited..  The ma\u00eetre d was happy to hob nob with a table of 3 older ladies several times and definitely looked our way but never recognized that we were done.  It literally took about 15 minutes for another older staff member in what looked to be a chef's jacket to stop by (the only person to stop by for 45 minutes) to ask if we were done.  \nKeep in mind....this is now about 8:30 on a Monday night so the place was about 1/2 empty.  We felt absolutely ignored on what was supposed to be a very special anniversary evening.\nWe turned down dessert/coffee......at this point it was a nightmare evening that we wanted to have end as quickly as possible.  \nWe let the ma\u00eetre d know when we left how embarrassed we were for them for the service they provided and he was apologetic....but at that point, there was no saving our anniversary.  \nThe food was seriously average.  The lasagna was basic lasagna in a cheesy/saucy soup.  My veal was fine but for almost $40, the portion was miniscule.  Literally about 4 ozs of meat with (no kidding) about $0.25 worth of vegetables (1 potato, 1/4 of a carrot, several green beans).  \n\nWe were so incredibly disappointed.  I had researched dozens of restaurants for our special night before choosing this one.  We were dressed to the nines and ready for a wonderful experience.  The fact that my hat and coat had to hang on a hanger on a post in the middle of the restaurant across the room right above a table should have been our first indication that this place wasn't as great as folks were saying it was.\n\nThe bottom line for us was the absolute lack of ANY service. If you're going to charge that much and consider yourself to be a top notch Italian restaurant in SF, the only thing you have to distinguish yourself from other like-establishments is your service.  When the best thing about your night was the Uber ride, you chose the wrong place.\n\nGli italiani devono essere trattati meglio", "author": "R M."}

It's one of those places I've passed a million times, but for some odd reason, never went in. \n\nLast night upon arriving we were instantly sucked in to the fun vibe of the bar area. Everyone was glued to the tv as some guy was tight rope walking across the Grand Canyon. Hilariously bad jokes were made, but the staff and patrons were all in on it for good natured fun. \n\nWe then got our table on the restaurant side. They let us choose from a window seat or booth. We loved we had the choice and opted for the booth. \n\nThere are fresh cut roses on every table. That was a nice touch. \n\nOur waiter was super friendly and walked us through the different dishes and sauces as they have a bunch of appetizers and entrees I wasn't familiar with. \n\nWe got the roasted peppers with anchovy cream sauce, shared a mixed green salad, bf got lasagna and I had the beef bolognese pasta. It was all delicious and fresh. The portions were generous too--we had plenty to take home. \n\nThe timing of the meal was perfect too.

When we got there, the place was practically empty. \n\nNo wonder. The service is awul. As soon as we sat, the first thing the waiter said to me is \"you look tired\" -- wow, thanks for the compliment, buddy! (I should have replied with: \"You look like a 60 year old man waiting tables in an empty overpriced restaurant.\")\n\nSince I had already spent $25 to eat at this place, I let them know about the coupon/certificate before we ordered. The host/manager comes over and says \"management has changed, and we will no longer honor that deal.\"\n\nHmm... interesting. I have, essentially, a contract saying that it never expires, for an establishment with the exact same name and location as they have, and they are saying they don't have to honor it.\n\nWell, the meal would have been over $100 for the 2 of us anyway, since the food is so overpriced (minimum price for a meat dish is like $30+), so we decided to just take our business elsewhere. Instead of getting the chance to (a) honor our ALREADY-PAID-FOR certificate; (b) win over a repeat customer for the future (we are relatively local); and (c) have us bring additional big-spending business associates there when they visit for company matters... instead, they got ZERO dollars from us \n\n(it was a blessing in disguise, because we went and spent $130 at Le Trappe, the Belgian food/beer place a few blocks down on Columbus, which was a great little discovery...)\n\nFrom the fact that a nearly-empty restaurant still treats their customers like crap and won't honor existing agreements, they clearly don't care whether they get your business... so I suggest you just don't give it to them.

They were just finishing up a wedding reception, and weren't open for supper until 7:00. We were told it would be about 45 minutes and that they had to clear 7 and 730 reservations. Since we could smell the garlic, olive oil and wine, we decided it might be worth the wait.\n\nThe restaurant clearly caters to locals and regulars. We sat at about 7:50, but they seemed to somehow make room for everyone who came it.\n\nWe started with the shrimp wrapped in prosciutto, which was frickn awesome. Garlic, olive oil, salty - and served HOT. Delicious. My wife had the saltimbocca, which was excellent. I suggest about 25% less sage, since that was the dominant flavor, but it was rich and flavorful. Pounded thin, cooked in butter, olive oil, with a nice sauce with broth and wine. Very tasty.\nI had the Osso Bucco, which is one of my benchmark dinners at an Italian restaurant, and Fior did not disappoint. There was no gremolata, but the broth was rich enough with the right flavors that I found it did not matter. Tender and juicy, full of flavor, with just a little pink. Again, full of rich flavors. In both cases, supper was served very hot, so the food had obviously not been sitting out before it was brought to the table.\n\nWe had dessert, but for the life of me I can not remember what we had - so I would probably say that it just did not make an impression.\n\nOverall, even though we had to wait for a table, they made room for walk ins on a busy Saturday evening, the food was excellent, and the service was fast.", "author": "Jon-Louis H."}

Hopefully this page is correct.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went out on a date night here a few days ago and it was just lovely! \n\nWe had a deal from http://Howaboutwe.com that got us one appetizer, one salad, and two entrees. There was a bit of a mixup at first and our waiter (Gill, who was very sweet and helpful by the way) told us to order only from the list of items that were excluded from the offer (which was a very small list) but once we sorted that out we ordered our actual items and received some bread and drinks very promptly! Gill also made a delicious wine recommendation. Also the maitre d was very attentive and apologized about the menu mixup and stopped by a few times to see if we were enjoying everything.\n\nIn addition to the items we ordered from the deal, we also ordered fresh oysters and some cocktails. The Suffering Bastard is delicious. My boyfriend got it and I almost wanted to order one along with my wine. :P The oysters were also very delicious and fresh but out of the 6 we got, two had some grit. It was also super awkward as I was picking shell bits out of my mouth when the maitre d stopped by and asked how we were doing so I had to cover my mouth and just be like, \"MMMMHMM, GREAT, THANK YOU\" \n\nBut besides that, everything was delicious. The ravioli I had was awesome. My boyfriend liked the gnocci but said it wasn't as good as his mom's (but that is biased obviously, I enjoyed it and thought it was good). Everyone there was super friendly, attentive (but not overly so) and helpful and made the experience wonderful! \n\nAlso, at the time of day we went (5:30-6:30 or 7ish) the sun was coming through all the glass windows and it cast everything in such a lovely glow.

But the best event: the Chef races out of the kitchen  to our table to inquire why I want his mushroom sauce on the side of my veal chop! You must be kidding! I didn't want his Campbell Soup mushroom sauce on that nice veal chop. 1 friend had a good veal piccata &  my veal chop was really nice despite 2 minuscule thumb sized potatoes on the plate - just leave em off & forget the soggy asparagus - hey this is California where we have great fresh veggies.  Other friend had dried up overcooked Bolognese Tagliatelle - stick the fork in & the whole bowl comes up with it! UGH -  As a former fan of the real Fior when it was at the now Original Joe's location, we 3 loved the old place and our  message to you is: do not go here!  Dining room had 10 tourists  and we sat near bar to at least enjoy all the fun DOGS that were at the bar with their families - we're pet friendly folks and loved that.", "author": "Guido B."}

Anyhow, we wanted bread and saw that everyone has a basket. We waited for 22 mins and no bread showed up. I asked politely if we could have some from another server.  Bread came out 5 mins later. Now waiting is not the bad part. Our main server had stated that I demanded bread and he didn't want to deal with me. That got me upset because I was polite. I asked to speak to a manager so we could leave. The manager was nothing but respectful and polite and offered to pay for the apps and drinks we ordered. and he asked if he could take care of us. We were uncomfortable and I just asked if we could pay and leave.  He would not let me pay. Very nice of him.\nFOOD::\nSalad was overdressed and salty. The melons were not ripe.

Our waiter was not terribly helpful. It took him forever to come to our table and he never checked in with us to see how everything was. This was at around 4:30 PM on a work day, he was not overwhelmed or busy in any way. I had lasagna and my friend had the Risotto alla Piemontese. The lasagna was absolutely horrible. I could not find a morsel of meat in it and the sauce was an orangish color. It was the kind of thing that you know was put together in an unthoughtful lazy way. No layering of b\u00e9chamel, bolognesem and pasta was attempted.  The frozen stuff you get at the grocery store is far superior.  The Risotto was not bad, but subpar for a restaurant that advertises itself as 'fine dining'. We also ordered Funghi di Selva Trifolati. Which is basically an assortment of three wild mushrooms saut\u00e9d in garlic and parsley. You think they could not mess this up? Yes they can and they did. This was very pungent. I do not mean garlicky pungent, but very old mushroom pungent. It was really not edible. After the horid dining experience, we decided to skip the desert and jolt out of there as fast as possible. The atmosphere is old school Italian without any attempt to update or clean it up. If that is your thing, go there for drinks, but skip the food.", "author": "nima d."}

We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms which were good/ Dinner also comes with bread and there is olive oil for dipping. The food was presented well and tasty. For dessert we shared tiramisu and my son opted for vanilla ice cream. I also ordered a capuchino to go along with the dessert The tiramisu is served in a sundae glass and doesn't look like the traditional cake I am used to but more like a ice cream dessert. It was okay, not what I expected though.The price for dinner including a mixed drink and a glass of house chardonnay was very reasonably priced.\nThe waiter was efficient and the other waiter staff were all good.\nThere is valet parking for $9.00 which is very nice.\nOverall we had an enjoyable experience here", "author": "jack d."}

I'm not one to complain excessively about food .. even my negative reviews here are tempered and balanced. But that this piece of petrale even made it out of the kitchen is proof that this restaurant, under new ownership or not, is already in grave danger. Awful ..  not fresh or properly cooked, splashed carelessly with some oil and adorned with the sorriest small portion of unappetizing green beans ever assembled. Honestly, the plate was a joke .. its appearance alone seemed a pointed attempt to discourage the recipient to ever come back here. Whoever was in the kitchen and allowed this to pass as edible, presentable, or just plain unoffensive, should be told to switch professions. Fior D'Italia may be the oldest restaurant in San Francisco .. but that tenure is about to end if they keep this up. \n\nThe service was fine .. a real shame that a competent waiter would be forced to bring a meal like this to the table.\n\n1/5/13 - Following up a few days later.

This was my first time along with my family, however my wife's family has been here plenty of times before with good reviews. I called a week prior to make reservations with the manager and he insisted that we would be able to be seated in a \"somewhat\" excluded room that usually fits a party of 12. Once arriving to the restaurant the tables were set up in the middle of the restaurant and no one knew about the reservation for the side room. The employees stated that it would've been too small for our party of 11. I was thought to myself well why was it offered? To include non of us are on the hefty side. To make things easier I agreed and sat where the tables have been set up. \n\nThe next issue we had was that we ordered 3 different appetizers (1 of each) and they must've assumed that we wanted 3 of each. They kept saying \"we will take care of you.\"  The appetizers were WAY more than enough and went to waste where they just pulled it away and never asked if we wanted to save it. Afterwards I asked if the appetizers served were 1 or 3 servings of each, where they answered 3 and caused us to be dumbfounded since no one ordered 3 of each.  However I feel no one complained due to the fact that two different families were still trying to get to know each other. On a good note the Calamari in Cesta and Salmone in Carpione were excellent dishes, however the Gamberoni allo Spiedo in Pancetta was very salty where we had shrimp left over. \n\nThe last issue here was a miscommunication. We asked the newly young if we were able to have a couple wine glasses. He states \"we can take care of you\" so he wraps 4 glasses, and quickly puts them in a bag and I said \"thanks!\" He seemed busy so he went straight to the register while I gave him a \"bye\" wave and said thanks again while walking off (he said nothing nor tried to stop me). Half the party slowly exiting he hands a receipt to one of my in laws saying \"heres the receipt\" and in law replies \"thanks\" and starts walking off. The manger replies \"someone needs to pay for the glasses.\" Once again confused, the in law hands me the receipt and I pay for that after spending $600 for dinner which I thought was complimentary. \n\nI do have to admit my chicken breast was cooked very well, however the in laws said the food was mediocre compared to before the new ownership and the menu is half of what it was before.

We were a party of six for lunch and everyone had something different.  No complaints from anyone.  For starters we shared oysters on the half shell and fried calamari.  The oysters were fresh and the calamari were light and crispy, not heavy and greasy as is often the case with fried calamari.  I had the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese for an entree and it was perfect.  The pasta was cooked just right and the sauce was a flavorful balance of beef, tomato, and spices - not too heavy on any ingredient.  \n\nYears ago I had frequented the restaurant in it's former location on Washington Square and the chef (and now owner), Gianni, has maintained the same high quality of cuisine, atmosphere, and service in it's new location.  Gianni came by for a friendly chat and our waiter, Alessandro, came up with excellent recommendations from the menu and later a brief history of Italy in general and Venice in particular (where he hails from).

The wine list is nothing to write home about - actually pretty lazy, lots of Safeway bottles - but you could find something for everyone. My wife had the pumpkin ravioli, which she said was fine, but lacking salt and seasoning. I ordered the quail stuffed with sage and sausage. Big portions of the sausage looked underdone, if not raw, and the texture only confirmed my suspicion. It was bright pink, unlike the rest of the (cooked) sausage. I left it on the side of my plate - it was too sage-y, and I didn't really want more, so I wasn't going to complain. The waiter, when clearing our plates, asked if everything was OK, and I said that actually the sausage was underdone. He took the plate, and returned a moment later saying the Chef had checked it out, and everything was as it should be - the sausage was supposed to be that color, and it was only the dim lighting in the dining room that made it appear otherwise. \n\nI actually found this pretty insulting. First of all, the customer is always right. Second, that sausage was seriously underdone. There was no question; it looked raw, and the texture of it was underdone. Third, it was still broad daylight outside, and the dining room was not *that* dimly lit. Fourth, sausage is not \"two-tone\" in color. If the Chef can't tell the difference, he's an idiot and should be fired. If he refuses to admit his mistake, that's just a food poisoning lawsuit waiting to happen. I didn't even want anything in return - no comp on the bill, no free dessert - I just wanted him to admit it was raw.

The food is normally soooooo amazingly good, too. There were six of us in our party. We were seated in a booth with two additional chairs which was somewhat uncomfortable but we were fine with that. Our waiter seemed very busy and finally after almost 20 minutes came over to take our drink order. We ordered martinis and wine. He brought back the martinis but the martinis were the wrong ones he totally forgot the wine for almost another 10 minutes. By now we are at the 25 minute mark the restaurant was very busy. Finally the wine came and he placed our food orders most of us had pasta I had the halibut. Everyone's food came except my halibut and he apologized saying it would be out shortly so another five minutes passes while my friends are going ahead and eating I'm sitting with just my glass of wine. Then the ma\u00eetre d' came out and also apologize saying the food was on the way he apologized and said there was nothing more he could do please except my apologies which was very nice. Then my halibut came and I was relieved because we had a dinner theater show afterward so now I could start eating my friends were already at least halfway through their meal. The first bite of the halibut was okay but I noticed it was a little tough. The second bite I couldn't even pull the halibut away from the rest of the piece because it was 100% completely raw inside. I had to send the raw fish back it looked like it had been poached in hot boiling water for no more than maybe two minutes it definitely had not even been inside of a saut\u00e9 pan. When I asked another waiter if he could help us and explain my fish was raw he immediately looked at us and yelled at our table \"Who's your waiter?\" And walked away. I understand when restaurants get busy and things go wrong in the bar or the kitchen it happens we understand but the rudeness of the waitstaff and the fact the food wasn't even properly prepared was not cool. it finally came back out another 10 minutes later. By now my friends had completely finished their meal and I am just starting mine. we're now late for a dinner theater by almost half an hour so the entire experience from my side was somewhat ruined and I know my friends felt bad as well. Mostly because I recommended the restaurant. I'm not sure I would go back after being treated this way. San Francisco has so many restaurants with grateful wait staff and properly cooked food.

It was absolutely fresh and  cooked perfectly for all. The al dente fresh string beans were delicious and the lemon completed the dish. We had a side dish of pumpkin ravioli which were good, but I think it is my personal taste that I like the traditional ravioli better. All in all, it was a great place for lunch. \nThe salad was quite large but the made on the spot. Lovely. I would certainly go again.", "author": "Clara M."}

It was a 10 minute walk through the North Beach neighborhood to get to the restaurant, which is located in an old, but charming hotel.  Locals and tourists were dining and the place was lively.  After being seated for 10 minutes with no acknowledgement,  our waiter approaches our table and asks if we are ready to order.  We tell him that we would first like to have water and order a drink. He steers me towards the \"house\" Pinot Noir. I order it and thought it was a very nice wine. We were each going to order a Caesar salad and split a pasta. Our waiter highly recommended the house salad. It was a generous size and very fresh. Pasta was served piping hot and cooked perfect. In true Italian fashion, there was no hurry to turn the table and we even had to ask for the check. We were rather surprised to find that our waiter's recommendations were rather pricey when the check arrived. The house salads were $16 each. Twice as much as the ceasars we were going to order. The house wine, which is typically less expensive was $17. Way to increase the amount of your tip, waiter guy!  Lesson learned: inquire as to the price when suggested by waitstaff. I do think this is an isolated incident and we just happened to get the snarky waiter.", "author": "Maureen W."}

In the past, we always knew what to expect - spotty service but fairly consistent food. You go here because its a tradition and old school. We knew they had closed and re-opened with new owners so we were hopeful - however the first bummer was the plastic label from the soda gun for Root Beer that was floating in my daughter's soda and the second bummer was the big piece of thick clear plastic that was in the middle of her bolognese. Of course, they didn't charge us for the bolognese and offered dessert on the house which was very nice and we could tell that our server was trying his best. The kids ordered the cannoli and that was not good either - and that means it must have been really bad because my kids don't turn down dessert easily. So to sum it up, I'm sad to lose our tradition but in a town with many great Italian options I'm sure we can start a new one!", "author": "Julia B."}

We visit this treasure every time we visit the city and are always greeted as if we are family.  We recently introduced my brother to the restaurant and he now is also a fan.  The employees make us feel welcome and appreciated, and the food is authentic and delicious.  We started with a prosciutto wrapped shrimp appetizer and continued on through a delicious cesar salad.  Our entrees consisted of 2 veal entrees, the fruitti de mare and a side of the best fettuccini alfredo I've ever had. Unfortunately, we had no room for desert. They have a nice wine list with a good selection in all price ranges. There is a reason we visit Fior d'Italia at least once every time we are in SF, it consistently exceeds our expectations and we always leave with full tummies and big smiles.", "author": "Martha V."}

The atmosphere is welcoming, the bar tends to a lot of locals, and the staff are very nice. However, there was a disparity between portions sizes and price. My dad and I ordered two antipasto dishes. The prosciutto with fruit was a decent portion, however the burrata, despite being delicious on its own, was incredibly small.  Although, the chocolate balsamic accent around the edge was a nice touch. My dad thoroughly enjoyed the linguini with meatballs, while I opted for the fettuccine alfredo. It was very al dente, but this was a nice change from restaurants that tend to over cook their pasta. I also asked for chicken with my pasta, which costed extra, but they forgot, and I was too hungry and tired to remind them... Fortunately we weren't charged for it. Overall, it's decent Italian food, especially if you are too picky and don't care about it being a bit over-priced.", "author": "Colleen C."}

The service was great for our dinner and they even checked in with me to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves.  I personally had the Salmon as did a number of people in our group and it was delicious, perfectly cooked.

The reason for only 2 stars is our service was absolute atrocious. The waiter was extremely rude when I asked for a little parmesan cheese with my spaghetti and seafood. I understand that the Chef may not recommend this, but if I want a little cheese I don't think that is a big deal. However, what really solidified the 2 stars, was that we were sitting there with our plates completely cleaned, with our credit card on the table, and glasses empty for so long that the table next to us (who had the waiter check on them twice in the time we were waiting for him) flag the waiter down to say \"I think that table wants their check.\" Apparently, if you aren't a regular, don't expect anything but subpar service. With an abundance of good Italian restaurants in the area, I wouldn't settle on the mediocre service here.", "author": "Ryan L."}

Before the move it was expensive but worth it because of the location, ambiance gave it a extra value.  So now it is struggling to measure up to the same celebrity status.  Looks like a hit one visit and miss the next time.  The personnel makes a big difference also.  The last time was during happy hour and with a friend.  I requested a table booth across from the bar. Wanted a comfortable area to have more than happy hour fair.  The water had to ask the owner because the booth sat more than two.  We had cloth napkins and they picked them up because maybe being happy hour and replaced with paper ones.  We had to requested more sourdough bread and food.  They charged us extra for the bread.

Our experience last night at Fior was amazing.  We were greeted by Lalo, the manager, and seated in a private area of the main dining room.  The unhurried service was absolutely impeccable.  We ordered a Zinfandel, which upon tasting was really not to our liking, but we said it would be okay.  The server--without being asked--suggested he take it back and bring us a different wine altogether.  We hesitated but he insisted.  He pleasantly took the bottle away, and brought us a much nicer wine (only a few dollars more than the first).  The menu has many \"old style\" Italian pastas and entrees.  The side order of three kinds of mushrooms was out-of-this-world.  Everyone enjoyed his or her meal.  The pistachio ice cream and the panna cotta provided an outstanding finale to a thoroughly enjoyable evening.  \n\nI don't understand the bad reviews.

Trust me on this one don't believe in everything you see and hear on TV because you end up looking like a gullible fool like I did. Sadly I came here today for my birthday and let me tell you it is not all that. Shit Olive Garden is better than this place. Let me first start off with the shitty service. The waiter comes and takes our order and as he's taking our order he gets a snappy attitude because my cousin is asking about the meat sauce. Then he doesn't check on us, doesn't refill our water, and then proceeds to take our appetizer and doesn't ask if we are done. Then the food is absolutely awful. We waited an hour for our food no joke and when we finally get it it's cold, bland, and just tasted disgusting. Then when they sing you Happy birthday and bring you the dessert you think it's free but they surprise you at the end when they charge it to the bill and your like wtf most restaurants give you a free desert on your birthday.  Well not this place. Lastly not only is the staff snobby and looks down on you in utter disdain but the clientele does the same thing. We walked in and immediately we got that uncomfortable vibe like we didn't belong there. Then the wtf are you doing here / disdained judgemental looks started throughout the whole night which made the experience even more unpleasant. I felt like I had gone back in time to the 50's when minorities are trying to get a meal at a diner but instead get passive aggressiveness and hostility from the staff and clientele. I smell prejudice.  I mean what did I expect when we were the only Latino family there and everyone else was middle class white baby boomers and their fucking parents. Disgusting!!!!

So sad and disappointed, we so wanted this to be a good experience. However I can't stress enough how gracious and friendly the service was. We sat at the bar first and ordered mussels and a couple of martinis. The drinks and bartenders were great (very reasonable happy hour BTW), but the mussels came out COLD...I mean even the butter sauce was cold. Decided to hope for the best with dinner. We got a great table, again the staff was a class act, it was such a shame to be so disappointed with both our entrees. The chef agreed to do a chicken parm (not on the menu). That was wrapped up after two bites and went to the dog. It was bone dry..just not edible. We also had the butternut and sage raviolis and brown butter sauce. This was totally dry and had no sauce. Jeez was the sous chef off that night? Then the clincher..I asked for some type of cream sauce to try to save this dish, the waiter came back and said the chef refused. WOW. I asked for it on the side and finally got it for my now cold dish. I don't know what is going on in that kitchen, but at this rate I would be surprised to see them open next week.

Johnny and Trudy along with Lalo and their service staff have each time provided excellent & very personal table service, very high quality meals with a delicious variety on the menu; prices are reasonable to the venue as well their atmosphere is one of a neighborhood feel.  Their new setting in the old hotel on Mason is perfect as this location was central to the \"ole Italian waterfront\" which did reach to Water Street at the corner of their building in the early 1900's. Their large venue rooms are perfectly styled to compliment their excellent service and meals. My wife and I feel that Johnny's pride and uncomprising demand for excellence throughout Fior's complete process from kitchen to table ensures that all aspects of this restuarant- service, food, beverages, attitude, as well price, ensure that the patron will always want to return. For years are mainstay when visiting San Francsico was the North Beach Restuarant which is still a fine establishment, yet Fior D'Italia beckons a little more feeling of being with family and of Italy itself, as Johnny and Trudy carefully manage it and interact with thier guests.", "author": "John Z."}
