It's a cool place.\n\nI watched Jonathan Sanchez pitch his no hitter here for the Giants.  I watched Kaep and the 49ers kick the Green Bay Packers ass here on opening day NFL a few years ago before he turned, uh, bad.

Good sides, but the real reason I prefer this place to every other Irish bar in town: they have a vegan impossible burger on the menu (get it without the bun for a complete vegan option). YUM! So delicious. They top it with saut\u00e9ed veggies. So tasty! My husband is a not-vegan, wing eating slob and he loves the wings here. \n\nService: Perfection. The bartenders are polite and chatty, and make mean mixed drinks. None of that trendy too-cool-for-you nonsense you'll find in hipster bars. The service at Chieftain make me with I lived close enough for this to be *my* neighborhood bar. \n\nAmbience: plenty of wood, comfortable seating, dim lighting.

I would assume lunch/HH on a week day would be bangin', but even on a Sunday it was busy.\n\nAnyhow, I ordered the Spicy Irish Potato Bites since I wasn't too hungry.  They're basically potato stuffed with cheese and some jalapeno remnants.  It wasn't spicy at all.  They have a sauce that comes with it and that IS spicy and that made it a good time.  They were slightly awkward to eat because of their size.  They were rather big and I couldn't eat them with a fork, so I just used my hands (not a big deal).  I think the plate had 7 or 8 of them.  I wish they were smaller in size like their name suggests.  They hit the spot and I was satisfied.\n\nThe waitresses: The one with the dyed red hair was nice.  The short blonde not so much.  They were both hungover and struggling.  There was no warm \"hello\" or any kind of welcoming introduction.  A lady was asking questions about sauces on a plate and the short blonde flippantly responded with \"What sauce do you want?\"  I didn't say anything, but internally, I was like \"WOW!\"  I definitely took notice of her attitude and made sure I said \"please\" and \"thank you\" during every interaction so I wouldn't be on the receiving end of all that.\n\nI used to work across the street and have been here before - mainly HH.  The place was clean and looked the part.\n\nMy star rating:\n\n4 for the business - food is ok.  Not bad, but not worth traveling across town for.\n\n2 for the staff.

This place is literally across the street from where I work and I cannot believe how long it took me to come here for lunch. I seriously am mentally kicking myself for not coming here sooner. I think the reason why is because it's more a bar than a restaurant so alcohol is off-limits for daytime use--but I digress.\n\nMy cousin and I come here to celebrate her birthday for lunch and we order a bunch of apps along with a shared entree of fish and chips. Our server suggested we split the hot wings and the fish and chips since we wanted to try a lot of things on the app menu- which was nice because then we would have ended up with a lot of leftovers. Among those we also ordered the calamari and the potato balls (fried mashed up potatoes with jalepenos and cheese-- YUP-- ain't no carb snob here!)  \n\nWhen our apps arrived, we were super excited and each app was a bite of heaven. I literally wanted to cry when I bit into the potato balls-- they were super sinful and delicious--it was that yummy! Perfect crispy balls of potato with cheese and jalepenos--but no fret for those who are fearing the spice because it's more the flavor than the spice in my opinion. The calamari was just as perfect with their aioli sauce (which I totally judge calamari on) and the hot wings were just as yummy then again-- it's really hard to screw up chicken wings.

The concerns I had were:\n\nLACK/ABSENCE OF SERVICE - I had to get up and ask for soda bread (of course if I'm going for a full grill on a Sunday morning it's because carbs are going to be included).  This has been an issue the last couple of times when our non-primary server has delivered the food (our waitress this time made that point herself).\n\nMore so I had to either get up from my table to find a server or wave to get refills/addtional items/the check when there were maybe three parties to serve in the entire place while a bartender and two servers were on duty (this is not at all a big restaurant).\n\nAlso, a party entered, asked to sit at a \"reserved\" table (which for years I can't remember ever being occupied by its \"intended party\") who were seated elsewhere and soon decided to leave for another restaurant without ordering anything.\n\nATMOSPHERE - This has never come up before, but for some reason the red-headed bartender decided it was a good idea to engage an out of town couple in political talk.  It's Sunday morning, I'm at a bar, for breakfast, which doesn't feature anything but sports on the TV screens, but somehow this seems like the best forum to force other customers to have to listen to Joe Shmoe from Nowheresville's political views?  Even if they were preaching to or against the choir it was totally not the time or place for that (or at least keep your voices down so the other customers can enjoy their meals).\n\nAt the end, I would have rather stayed to buy more, but just ended up leaving as quickly as possible to spend my money elsewhere.", "author": "William C."}

It was nice to have tvs around playing baseball and  whatever sports and they do have a lot of seating. Towards the evening around 5ish, it started to get packed and it got really loud to the point where i couldn't hear my friends talk.

It's tough to find a place with consistent and tasty offerings of my favorite soup for life. \n\nTheir Fish and Chips is another frequent plate of mine.  3 pieces of juicy and crispy cod!  Yes, it's crispy, greasy goodness. \n\nThe buffalo wings are tasty and fall off the bone.  I would order it every time I come here but the price is just a little higher than its value in my opinion.\n\nI've tried their burgers and I do not think it's their strong point.

I can't quite recommend how I would make it better.\n\nIf you have to eat a burger however, I'd recommend the Chieftain Burger.  The egg and bacon and all the fixings really tie together well.  Eat the egg separately if you want.\n\nI had the NY Steak dinner and replaced the mashed potatoes with fries instead.

The pub satisfies both cravings with its wide variety of beer and a large projector showing the NFL game in action.\n\nI'm not a big football fan nor am I an avid drinker, so I just settled at Chieftain with their Chieftain Burger and a pint of light beer. The burger was substantial for sure. It was juicy, it had bacon, and it was topped off with a fried egg. For a hungry soul like me, the burger really hit the spot. But because of the juice and the yolk, the buns got really soggy towards the end and that's kinda no bueno.\n\nIf they play NBA games here during November, I could see myself ordering some snacks and drinks.

By 9:15pm we were still waiting to place our order. Finally I asked the Frenchman to order from the bar. I was too hot to even attempt to speak with bar staff - some one would have lost their head. The bar man said, no problem I'll send your server over to you.. \"oh wow that'll be just great, let's wait some more!\" \n\nFinally our drinks were brought out, I had to ask for a glass twice. By now it was 9:25pm and we were still waiting on our hot wings and fries. At this point we asked to have our food wrapped to go, explaining we had a movie to catch. \n\nRecovery: There was a second server who apologized for everything. She came to our table and apologized for the late and slow service. She offered us a shot and said everything is on the house. After our shot our food was brought to us. We assumed when she said everything was on the house, she meant the shot. nope she meant EVERYTHING! Shots, meal and pints. We were shocked and very impressed. We did at least leave a tip for the server. \n\nI have been to the Chieftain many times, this was an unusual experience. So instead of ripping them a 1 star, I am happy to leave 4.

However, I sadly knocked a few points off due to the lackluster food and drink.  \n\nTo their credit, the ordering system was down the day we visited.  Everything had to be done by hand.\n\nWe ordered the Chieftain nachos and a dozen wings.  Now, I'll admit that ordering nachos in an Irish pub is generally a poor idea, so I'll go easy on these.  They were completely underwhelming, the cheese was melted but not hot.  The serving size was smaller than expected.  The wings were ok-- nothing to notable here.  \n\nThe fish and chips were average, and got the job done.  Again, nothing to notable.  ***The star of the menu appears to be the shepherd's pie** Our table ordered two plates of this dish and tasted very satisfying.  The housemade bread added extra pizzazz.    The Chieftain Irish stew receives honorable mention.  Home-cooked goodness with tender chunks of beef and veggies was topped off with excellent housemade soda bread.  \n\nWord of caution:  there is a Yelp deal for a \"specialty\" drink when you check in here.

The place was packed around 7pm, so we were lucky to grab a table. It is REALLY dark, so if you didn't bring a flashlight, you're SOL. Just kidding, thank you iPhones! ;)\n\nOur server was this cute girl that was helpful with all of our questions. She took our beer orders and then gave us some time to look over the food menu. We ended up deciding to split the calamari, fish and chips, and another entree. It was a lot of food - we only finished the calamari. (To be honest, I really liked my Porter, so I was busy drinking instead of eating so I ended up only eating the calamari.) Now that I read that the fish and chips are one of the best... I kind of regret not getting a bite! What can I say - the thirst was real.\n\nIf you check into Yelp, you get a $3 for a shot of Mint Fernet deal. We were curious as to what this Mint Fernet is and asked our server. She said, \"It tastes DISGUSTING. But it's an SF thing. It's one of those when in SF... things, so if you guys are up to it...\" SOLD! Beware, these shots come out warm (yuck). My friends, who like mint, said the shot was not bad. On the other hand, I truly believe that the only things that should be mint flavored is toothpaste or gum. (Yes, I do not eat mint chocolate anything.) Granted, the shot wasn't horrible, but the mint flavor traveling down my throat was not pleasant at all. Again, it's a personal preference, so definitely do the shot for a good time!\n\nMy Yelp friend Kaje told me about the $75 for $100 deal, and I wish I looked more into it last night. Regret #2! Between four people, our bill came out to be almost $100, so we definitely could've saved $25.

It's just a couple blocks down 5th on the corner across from Burlington Coat Factory.\n\nFirst thing you notice walking in, is how small the place is. There's one booth, several low tables with chairs, a few high tables with chairs, a community bar table in the middle and the bar seating itself. It looks like when this place is packed it's very \"intimate\". Lighting was very dim. Typical bar lighting. Also, try to look up at the walls & columns, they've done a pretty good job making the walls & columns look like rock and the torch lighting on the columns.\n\nWe sat at a table and the waitress came up to us and asked us if we wanted menus. She took our beer orders right away and gave us time to look over their menu. We immediately went to the Traditional section of the menu. By great yelp reviews we had to try the Potato Bites. From there we ordered the Fish & Chips and the Shepherd's Pie, especially since it said it was made with ground lamb, NOT ground turkey or ground beef like many other places.\n\nOn to the food...\nSpicy Potato Bites - Mashed potato balls with chopped jalape\u00f1os, deep fried and served with a spicy dipping sauce. You get 5 servings. You bite into one and the outside is light & crunchy, while the inside is what you expect, creamy mashed potato with bits of jalapeno. Just a little heat, but dip them in the sauce & you'll get a little more spice. Not too overpowering, just right.\n\nPhoto - Potato Bites: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-chieftain-irish-pub-and-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zIvLr0z2RVniJ7RxdEmT3g#hhoe4Wv2ee7gk6Br6YrsEw\n\nFish & Chips - Some here have said their fish was soggy, I guess my first experience was better? My fish came out hot & crispy, very light crisp. The fish was flaky, cooked just right. And I consider myself lucky this time because I got 4 pieces instead of 3, like it says on the menu. The chips were your basic steak fries, I didn't find anything really wow about them.\n\nPhoto - Fish & Chips: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-chieftain-irish-pub-and-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zIvLr0z2RVniJ7RxdEmT3g#zVMBCqjlmctWfRitrxze5A\n\nShepherd's Pie - You can definitely taste the difference with this one. Came to us really hot. So hot we had to let it cool down a bit. You can actually taste the lamb, it had that light gamey taste that only lamb has. It wasn't ground turkey or ground beef. The spices were nothing we've tasted in any other Shepherd's Pie. Very flavorful.\n\nPhoto - Shepherd's Pie: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-chieftain-irish-pub-and-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zIvLr0z2RVniJ7RxdEmT3g#7A77tHtv-UF27D10eJX2xA\n\nThey have daily special's too.

I've tried the other bars around the area (Rumors: pretty good but service is slow, and Ted's Sports Bar: DON'T GO; very old crowd and the one overwhelmed bartender tries to avoid eye contact at all costs). Service here is great and it's somehow large enough that my husband and I have always managed to end up with seats, even for the Superbowl or the NBA Finals. \n\nI really like the relaxed \"vibe\" of Chieftain. They give you a large, pretty varied menu at your table and the waitresses are friendly. The spacing of the tables is also pretty nice - you're not knocking into each other. It's probably my favorite place to watch a game and get a nice draft beer; they have quite a large selection including cocktails and wine for the beer-nonenthusiasts out there (confession: sometimes I get wine or cocktails instead; cocktails are okay but they use smaller ice which sometimes melts too quickly for my liking - I want to sip and enjoy the game...). People are generally around the late 20s and early 30s crowd and typically pretty into the game, but it's never rowdy enough that you can't hold a conversation. Just occasional extremely loud cheers. \n\nOnto the food:\n* Turkey burger: Tastes relatively light but delicious. There's jalapeno salsa and melted cheese.

I disliked my experience so much that I am hastening to provide specific comments with regard to my displeasure. The waiter/Bartender was very rude. She started off with telling us what is not available and what she can't do. \"Sorry, I have to add ice to your Diet Coke because it's a little warm\", when I specifically asked for it without ice. I ordered an omelette but it took forever to get it. I had to ask twice to get my questions about ingredients and the menu answered.  People who came in later got their food earlier. The omelette was average at best. I've had much better omelettes at restaurants in Maine that are more sophisticated and taste better at comparable prices. No refills on the water, soda. She said she can't give separate  checks because we didn't ask before hand (can't see why not- is it that much work?). Very unwelcoming, poor service and average food.

Thankfully, the kitchen is open late - until about 10pm.\n\nI had the Angus cheeseburger, with bacon.  It's actually priced reasonably, considering general trends in food in SF these days.  For $12 ($10.50 burger + $1.50 for bacon), I got a good bacon burger with fries - something that would cost about $17 at the pub two blocks from my home.  The burger was fine - better than diner-quality, but also not a fine-dining burger.  Basically, it's good casual restaurant fare.  The fries were steak fries.  They tasted like they were probably frozen, but I'm not complaining because they were included with the burger even though they weren't mentioned on the menu.  I ate at the bar, and the condiment caddy included yellow mustard, ketchup, HP sauce, malt vinegar, some sort of hot sauce, salt, and pepper.\n\nThe bar showcases an impressive collection of liquors, with most of the diversity appearing to be in whiskeys.  It appeared that they had more Scotch than Irish whiskeys, but the selection of both was impressive.  However, I had a beer, and it was one I'm very familiar with.  It tasted like they really needed to clean their lines.  The beer came out tasting sour and stale.  I probably should have mentioned it to the bar tender, but he was busy with a number of other customers, and I wasn't trying to score a free beer.  Anyhow, if any staff are reading this, please clean your tap lines!\n\nThere were two live musicians.  One of them sounded like she knew what she was doing. The other had a pint of Guinness in front of him, and sounded like he had never practiced with the other one prior to playing together that evening.  I don't know if he was actually drunk, or merely unpracticed, but regardless, he was taking Irish folklore out into the back alley, and beating it unconscious with his penny whistle.  I don't think I'm alone in this assessment, because despite being a free show, I never saw any of the other patrons tip the musicians in the time I was there.\n\nIn summary:  The burger was 4-stars, ambiance was 3-stars, beer was 2-stars, and music was 2-stars.

After perusing Yelp reviews for a while, I settled on The Chieftain- an Irish pub with great reviews that was walking distance from our hotel.\n\nOur bartender, Dylan, was phenomenally friendly and attentive. He took our drink order and suggested an appetizer- his favorite, the Spicy Irish Potato Bites (beer-battered mashed potatoes with jalepeno and cheese.) The boyfriend said they were his favorite dish, and I might have to agree. For the entree, we ordered clam chowder and the Fish & Chips to share.. Both were fantastic. The best part though, in my opinion, was Dylan asking the kitchen to split our meal for us before it was served. Absolutely unexpected and obviously not necessary, but so thoughtful! Men tend not to be very proficient when it comes to \"sharing\" food, so this ensured I actually got to eat too :)\n\nInstead of a juke box or radio, there was an incredibly talented guy singing, while playing the guitar AND harmonica. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that he knew every single song on the planet and played them all perfectly- so impressive.

When our waiter came up to take our order, he looked a bit scruffy and disheveled, it looked as if he had a rough night the night before and could use a nap. It did make me question the cleanliness of the place seeing how we are about to have dinner there. Seeing how we wanted to hang out at a brewery type sports bar and didn't know where else to go and our time was limited, we stayed. Boy what a mistake. \n\nI had the nachos with lamb chili and when they came out they didn't look very appetizing. The little bit of cheese on them was burnt on the chips, sour cream and guac was good and the lamb chili seemed decent enough. After we left, I felt a bit of indigestion, I had only had two beers and most of the nachos, so hadn't really overdone it by no means. Long story short, I woke up at 2 AM and again at 3 AM with the squirts! I also felt like I needed to eat about half a dozen tums because it felt like it wanted to come up the other direction also. I had a horrible night sleep due to it all and as I'm laying here writing this I still don't feel great. I have a pretty strong stomach, some have even said I have an iron stomach. But you serve me some Fowl meet and my stomach, every time, will reject it! All in all, I would give this place another chance because I like the vibe there and I am Irish  but I definitely wouldn't eat the lamb Chili.", "author": "Dave H."}

We had our food and some drinks as we watched Sunday footfall.  It worked out well. I have ti say, as much as I've been to SF, this place was awesome based on service alone from Rhia.

What you'll lack in $50 roasted chicken delicacies and hand stirred libations, you'll flow over with standard pub grub fare and pints of beer out the wahzoo. \n\nWith that being said, my expectations were adequately aligned with what I'd anticipate from an Irish bar after hitting The Chieftain this Sunday, and like most bars of similar ilk, it does just fine for what it is: a comfy bar with simple drinks, sports on TV, and recognizable grub. Nothing that'll earn a Beard award anytime soon, but hey -- sometimes utilitarian nourishment at a fair price is just what the doctor ordered.\n\nThe service was pretty slow and spotty, and if I were in more of a hurry, I probably would have been slightly irritated.

Far from it.\n\nWe walked a good half-hour to this place since it was one of a few well-rated restaurants/pubs that was open on a Sunday night that could likely accommodate our group of seven.\n\nWe got there and found that there were many empty tables. We sat down at one and waited about 10 minutes before we were finally served. The waitress did not seem to be in the best of moods and did not seem very interested in any small talk. When it came time to order food, she took one order and nearly walked off before I even had a chance to give her mine. After another of our friends joined, he ordered a burger and waited 20-30 minutes before getting it -- how does it take that long to make a burger, not to mention when the place isn't even buzzing?\n\nService aside, I wasn't very impressed by the fish and chips either. Definitely not the best in the US, and definitely not the best in North America, despite some reviews stating the contrary. The fish was not very crispy; I'd put it somewhere between soggy and a slight crisp, as were the chips/fries (nor were they seasoned very well). Not worth the $12.95, in my opinion.\n\nAnd the beer? We ordered three pitchers and were shocked when we received the bill. They ranged from $22-$30 EACH. How is that anywhere near two dollar signs? There are plenty of other bars in SoMa with better beer and lower prices.\n\nAll in all, I won't be coming here again.", "author": "Michael S."}

Then we all perform \"Riverdance\" for all the bedazzled tavern onlookers. Yes, it's true. OK, no, it's not. But I have actually passed by the Chieftain many, many times walking to the Yerba Buena Gardens. It just looked like a typical Irish-style bar. To my utter lack of surprise, I went in there last weekend with Jamie W...and guess what? It's a typical Irish-style bar. With food. \n\nYes, we ate there. They actually have quite a menu there that stretches beyond the standard definition of pub grub. But I have to say the quality doesn't rise much above pub grub either. Jamie W. had the $11.25 Battered Fish & Chips. They use Harp Irish lager for the batter and serve three generous fillets of cod. Good stuff...wish I ordered it. I went for the ambitious, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink $11.95 Chieftain Irish Grill - a 4-ounce grilled steak, a banger (sausage), a lamb patty, baked beans, sauteed mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, fries, and country gravy. Whew. \n\nWell, I was ready to be embarrassed by what came out, but it turned out to be a major glop-fest on a plate. Everything was covered with the gravy - so I couldn't tell what was what. I pointed out to the waitress that I didn't see my lamb \"slider\" since I was fully expecting a mini-burger on a bun. Well, she came back with a patty - and I later realized I already had a patty on the plate. Now I see on their online menu, they say \"lamb patty\". Did I cause that change? You can thank me later. \n\nNone of it was bad, but the combo of meat and gravy and whatever came across like a meal you'd see in the mess hall of a military base.

Our experience at The Chieftain was by far the worst I've ever been treated at any restaurant, after dropping off our BMW motorcycles at the dealership, we were walking to BART and seen this place waking by. We had on our leathers and helmets and the bar is pretty badly set up for storing gear on bar stools so we sat down in a booth near the west wall of the restaurant. Immediately a red headed hostess walked up and said \"you can't sit there, we reserve it for groups of 6\" to which I replied that we had our leather stuff and helmets and that they appeared only about half full in customers. She stormed away an went to get the waitress. Shortly after our waitress walked up and you could tell she was furious. Her face screamed attitude immediately and she said that the table was reserved for groups of 6 and again I explained that it was not an issue for us to leave the restaurant if it was an inconvenient. She fold her arms and stamps her feet as we begin to prepare to leave. She blurts out angrily \"can I get you some drinks?\" So we sit back down and I ask for an ice tea. My buddy asks if there's any specials or anything in particular she liked and with the bitchiest attitude says \"I like the lamb sandwich but I'm not going to sit here and recommend anything\". We look at each other and I swear I have never felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant in my life. \nWe order the turkey burger and corned beef and cabbage. Food was ok, very much pub fried food with an Irish flair. \n\nHalf way through I asked the hosted why the waitress was being rude to us and she shrugged her shoulder and walked away. \nI get that a restaurant with limited space would want to have larger tables for bigger groups, but it was Saturday at 2:00 and everyone was at the bar. We weren't greeted at the front door and when we asked for men's she snidely said \"what a stupid question, of course we have A menu\". \n\nI assume they were rude because after the initial rude attitude, she felt that we wouldn't leave a tip. It's always proper etiquette to leave a tip and express concerns with a manager and being gay, we know the to always leave a bigger tip than most. \n\nI will not return to this restaurant and I would steer clear of this place, I have a strong feeling it is a fairly common issue with service. One funny part was that with the check came a customer service questionnaire and one of the first questions was \"How can we improve our service?\". \n\nAbsolutely stay away from this place, people with gear or bikers with helmets, they are not friendly by any means.

A great place for food and booze at the same time. \n\nIt's a little narrow for a wheelchair but just barely possible - ask nicely and the staff will help clear a path. I tend to avoid busy nights as it can be hard to get a table. \n\nCome early on sports or busy nights, it will get crowded. But the Moscone crowds don't always know about this place, so if you've got to go to a conference or a friend does, get here early for food and booze and avoid most of the Moscone post-conference crowd nightmares. \n\nNow that the Edinburgh Castle no longer has decent fish and chips, this is one of the best fish and chip pubs in town if not the best - my only complaint is the Heinz vinegar could be upgraded. But everything I've eaten here has been good or great, authentic and delicious.

And it's consistently good, no matter when I get here. \n\nBeer taps: excellent selection of local and British and rotating taps. Whiskey: oh heck yes whiskey.

They know their whole menu inside and out -- not that it's a huge menu, but I've been to a lot of bars where nobody who works there eats the food, which is usually a sign to run -- and they're quite knowledgeable with their whiskeys, per my friend who is a far bigger whiskey snob than I.

He even told my friend and I the safest way to get back to our hotel (I'm new to the area and my friend was in from New York). Which was greatly appreciated because we both tend to get lost and end up in rough neighborhoods.\n\nI'd also like to commend the bartender on how he handled a VERY drunk girl who kept falling asleep at the table. He was very professional, yet assertive in asking her friends to take her home. I've seen similar situations handled in much worse ways. So kudos.\n\nAs for the general atmosphere, it was rather quiet when we went (Midnight on a Thursday) so I'm not the best judge. I've driven by other times and seen loads of people standing outside. So it definitely varies.\n\nThe drinks were alright. I had a Manhattan, and my friend had a whiskey sour. Honestly I like them a bit stronger, but these were fine for a night where I didn't intend to get drunk.

It can be kind of loud even when it's not crowded, so don't expect to be able to have an intimate conversation, but it's a good place to hang out with friends or co-workers.\n\nThey carry the typical Irish pub beers (Guinness, Murphy's, Smithwick's) plus a \n few or the larger local microbrews (Anderson Valley, Lagunitas). Food is typical pub food - burgers, fries, fish & chips. Vegetarian options are salads, a garden burger or a couple of potato-based appetizers.\n\nMy favorite drink here is a shot of tequila with a Guinness chaser.

The jalapeno poppers were the freshest I've ever tasted. They were not the frozen type and they used real chiles. Very tasty. Even the chicken wings were cooked well and yummy!\n\nMe: GUINESS BEEF STEW: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QkaSsRmSHnc7vlypsfNfyA?select=HgS-T3wPZ9dSkeN7CiKucQ Not much veggie/seafood selection and I didn't want to eat Fish N Chips.  The Beef Stew was a good choice. Very flavorful and comforting meal with big chunks of carrots and potatoes. The meat was tender.

He was slightly disappointed.\n\nTAB: $60 with Diet Coke, tax and tip.\n\nOVERALL: (3.5-4 Stars) \nChieftain Irish Pub offers delicious comfort food to warm those cold bones at very reasonable prices. The dishes were priced at about $10 on average. The most expensive item on our menu was the appetizer platter at $14 but I would say it was worth it!\n\nRECOMMEND: This pub is great to hangout to catch a game, share a pint with friend or nurse a cold with a plate of stick to your ribs but delicious pubfare. Portions were adequate and not gargantuan.  \n\nIMBIBE: For those who imbibe, they carry a nice selection of Scotch Single Malts and Irish Whiskeys.\n\nLOCATION: Perfect location on 5th Street, not far from BART and shopping!\n\nMOVIE:  \"THE BOX\" @ Century San Francisco at  Bloomies.  Trippy sci-fi. Totally unexpected plot!\n\nTOURIST TRAP:  NOT!!! If you're a European tourist and feeling homesicked, come here!

The high tables were cramped and uncomfortable. \n\nThe cocktails were good. I ordered the Sazerac which was quite a refreshing Green Chartreuse twist on a Manhattan. The spicy Irish potato bites we ordered as an appetizer were fantastic. However, the daily special ravioli the waitress recommended was wayyyyy too salty. And It wasn't just my order. My friend ordered a buffalo chicken wrap that also turned out to be enigmatically salty. \n\nIn addition, getting the waitress's attention was a ordeal, whether it was to order another drink or to get our check.\n\nAdmittedly, my experience at the Chieftain may have been atypical (perhaps someone was adding salt twice in the kitchen due to miscommunication), but the poor service on a Wednesday night left much to be desired for both the food and the service.", "author": "Jugal S."}

If I can walk in a place that feels alive & have great food & drink along with a great time & go home with a smile, that's got to be 5 stars. That was the Chieftain on a recent Friday evening after work.\n\nI was the last person to arrive for what amounted to a double date. The girlfriend & I plus her friend & friend's boyfriend were our party of 4. Inside is the classic Irish pub look. Plenty crowded & noisy, there was somewhat of a celebratory feeling in the air. Friday is always reason enough for me. Our table was right next to the open front door & shouting was often required for conversing. It was a good crowd, though, with lots of random friendly banter with other patrons at the bar or just while walking around.\n\nThe girls had already eaten since they'd been there a while already. Service was friendly & attentive. I had a Murphy's stout while looking over the menu & then decided on the 1/2 Pound Lamb Burger medium rare. My male counterpart ordered Corned Beef & Cabbage. The Corned Beef & Cabbage looked good enough that I would strongly consider ordering it next time. My Lamb Burger was spectacular. Cooked properly to the specified medium rare, the meat was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Add blue cheese, mushrooms & onions on a nice firm on the outside, spongy inside bun & this was the ideal complement to all the delightful beer I was throwing down my gullet.\n\nAfter the meal, I felt like having liquid dessert. I sauntered up to the bar, ordered an Irish coffee & asked the bartender for his Irish whiskey recommendation. His eyes grew big & a wide smile drew across his face at the prospect of bestowing upon me some kind of Irish whiskey epiphany. As he rushed off to fetch the bottle he had in mind, it was obvious to me that here was a man who enjoyed being a bartender, enjoyed being Irish & enjoyed Irish whiskeys. In short, the right man for the job. And epiphany it was. He poured Red Breast 12 Year Irish whiskey & now I know Irish whiskey as I never knew it before. Subtle, delicate & sublime with a complex array of flavors, Red Breast 12 Year for dessert was a wonderful contrast to the hearty, heavy & rich meal of lamb burger with stouts. The Irish coffee was really good too & rounded out everything nicely.\n\nFor atmosphere, food, drink & service, the Chieftain was as good as any Irish pub experience I've had. I look forward to celebrating another Friday here as soon as possible.", "author": "John M."}

Experience started off good with very friendly service from the bartender, but when the rest of our group showed up and we seated ourselves at a big table (which, I guess it was cool that they let us do that) service went downhill. My corned beef sandwich came and it was decent, but after that it took FOR-EV-ER to get more drinks or anything else. It was like the waitress totally forgot about us... and it didn't even seem that hectic... and she was helping everyone around us... it was weird. \n\nThe icing on the cake (or whatever the opposite of that would be) was when the bill(s) came... somehow we were under the impression that she was transferring our tab started at the bar so that we would all end up with one bill, but we ended up with two so that a bunch of us had half our stuff on the bar tab and half on the table. Weird and really confusing, AND there was an automatic 18% (!!) gratuity added to the table bill (but not the one from the bartender... who I wanted to tip much more generously anyway since he was actually helpful).

It had a nice apple flavor to it, and was cool and refreshing.  \n\nThe food was surprisingly good!  We didn't want to eat a lot, given we were going to get dinner shortly after, but we did end up splitting an order of garlic fries.  The fries were thick cut and deliciously garlic-y.  I was curious to try it with the curry (they have curry fries, cheese fries, garlic fries, etc.), so I ordered curry on the side.  For some reason, I was expecting Indian-style curry, but the flavor reminded us of Japanese curry.

But other than that, pretty spacious.  Be very wary about the food- I ordered a lamb burger med. rare with no cheese- and the waitress didn't put in the change so it showed up with blue cheese melted on top of the patty.  I pointed it out and she apologized and took it back.  In fairness it looked pretty good.  One of my buddies got fish and chips- which also looked good and he said he enjoyed.  Within about 5 minutes my replacement burger showed up and I started eating.  After two bites I realize the burger tastes very rare- in fact raw.  Now, I've only taken two bites from the edge and the meat is browned on the outside, and looks kind of light pink on the inside, but I open the bun to get a better look, and I see the burger is just barely marked from the grill- light browning.  I pinch off a bit of meat and find that the light pink inside is completely raw room temperature meat.  No wonder it came back so fast... they didn't cook it.\n\nI was upset at  having been served raw meat and made it plain to the waitress- I told her to take the burger back because it's raw and that I didn't want any food from there kitchen, period.  Apparently she didn't like that, because when she came back with the check she told me she didn't like my tone and I had no business being rude to her because she just serves the food she doesn't cook it.  Then she ran off.  When she came back to get the money, I said look if you don't take any responsibility for the food that's fine, why don't you go get the manager or whoever does have responsibility for it.  She just said she wouldn't do that and then literally ran for the kitchen- and I followed her.  The bartender came over at that point as well as some jerk who apparently just knows the waitress and was there eating apparently with the girl he wants to dump in her favor.  Anyway, turns out- no manager on duty.  How about the cook?

Oh well, a Magner's in a bottle is still a fine beverage. Two in our party tried their mixed drinks, which are delicious. \n\nWe shared an order of the fried mashed potato balls...get these, they are awesome. I could have just eaten an order myself and had my cider and been happy...but dinner still awaited, and it was great. In our little group, 2 people ordered fish & chips, 2 ordered the guinness stew, 1 got bangers and mash, and I got the shepherd's pie. There was very little left on anyone's plate. My shepherd's pie was rich and flavorful, a great choice on a chilly evening. I tried the guinness stew from one of my friends, and it was equally hearty. \n\nI'll just take a moment to call out our waitress, because she was awesome.

I had my boyfriend take a bite (he was eating the regular burger) and it kind of ruined him on the regular burger.  Our friend had the Fish and Chips and really liked it.  He also ordered the fried Potato Balls the first time we had lunch there and we all fell in love with them.  They have a little jalapeno in them, so they have a good spice to them.

However, when you pair it with some french fries, I guess the meal isn't all that healthy! Regardless, they have a great diverse menu from the apps like the crab stuffed portobello app (so yummy), potato poppers, mussels, as well as the traditional burgers and sammies, and Chieftain's classics like bangers and mash and shepherd's pie. \n\nThe Chieftain is in a good neighborhood and away from some of the craziness of the upper SOMA area.

It looks a bit divey from the outside, so I was expecting sticky floors and tabletops but was pleasantly surprised to find a relatively bright, nice little pub. \n\nA couple of us went to the Chieftain for lunch and beers (it had been a long week). I suppose if you're playing hooky to watch sports, this is also a good place to catch a game during the workday (and probably on weekends too). On a Friday afternoon, the place was ~75% full so there was no wait and somebody to seat you (which gives it an advantage over the madness that can occur at Zebulon during the lunch hour). \n\nI got the burger with cheddar cheese and avocado (yes, that's my version of a healthy burger - it doesn't have bacon!), and the burger was cooked to my order (medium!) and tasty. I'm a believer in steak fries (it takes me back to my youth spent at Lyon's restaurants), so I was happy to find steak fries with my burger. Steak fries can be delicious, especially when they are super fried and still nice and potatoey on the inside (like the ones at the Chieftain). Plenty of beers on tap - looked like there were ~8.\n\nOur server was super nice and helpful, and the food arrived quickly. We were in and out in ~45 minutes without any need to hurry the kitchen or the server. \n\nA pricier lunch option (burgers start at $9 with extras...costing extra) but pretty good for a sit-down, high-quality meal.", "author": "Wendy L."}

I was moved from a table to supposedly accommodate a group of 4 but during my whole time at the bar/restaurant only one person of that 4 was present and the server didn't even apologise or offer to reseat me.... When finally after seating myself at the bar- I found the bar man to be snappy at best.... After waiting for 5 minutes for him to even say hello he didn't. All he said was when ever your ready and disappeared for another few minutes... This again is bad customer service where customers should firstly be greeted.... I think their Irish Breakfast is good but unfortunately I don't eat tomatoes so I request some extra fries. And without fail every time I'm lucky to get 5-6 fries on my plate. This is extremely disappointing service especially after being told by the barman that I'll get extra as a substitute for the tomatoe. Also not once did he ask me was everything ok and 20 minutes after I finished my first drink did he ask do I want another... So I guess today the staff we're having a bad day.

Surprisingly, the cocktail list also isn't very long and I saw nothing on it that I wanted to try (wound up going with vodka/cranberry instead) but I wager the beer is what most people go here for.  I'm very picky about what flavours of beer I like and none of what they had appealed to me, so I didn't try any.\n\nNot a bad place to stop by for a quick bite or a place to hang out with friends while munching on snacks and having a few drinks.  It's really close to the movie theatre so a good option if you're looking for something quick beforehand.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

Last night before my girlfriend and I's long walk to Thirsty Bear, we stopped here to grab a drink before we endured the cold wind of San Francisco.

It's pretty small but in a quaint/cozy way; in fact, it really did remind me of a pub you'd find in Ireland or in a more suburban town in Great Britain. The food was both affordable and tasty; I would recommend the corned beef sandwich or shepherd's pie as both were delicious! We didn't order any beer but they had a good variety on tap (and of course, plenty of Guinness/Guinness combinations). The service was a little slow, but everyone was very friendly.

Cute little Irish Pub - we were sat at a high top bar table, which I love. It was a Sunday night so it wasn't very busy, but the waitress somehow kept forgetting about us. She was friendly enough though and we weren't in any hurry. I wasn't super hungry as we had a late lunch, so I ended up with the Grilled Cheese Toastie (on sourdough, of course). The bread was great, the cheese on the other hand was very cheap tasting and in way too high of quantity. My friend was actually laughing at me trying to eat it. The fries weren't very good either (not seasoned at all), but certainly edible. \n\nIt is a cute place though and I would probably have liked it better if we had just gone for beers and not food.", "author": "Amy S."}

We went on a Thursday night around 8 pm for dinner and beer. It was extremely small and very crowded when we walked in so I was immediately discouraged. However, we were greeted almost immediately and the hostess said it would be about a 5 minute wait.  We only waited a few minutes and were seated. The beer and alcohol selection was good. We ordered our beers which cane quickly and then our food. Much to my surprise we only waited another 8 to 10 minutes for our food. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the Shepard pie and I had the Turkey BLT. Both were hot and EXTREMELY delicious!  The chipotle sauce is to die for! By far the beat sauce I've had anywhere.  With how busy it was the waitress only checked in once, but I wasn't bothered by that because the food and beer were so good.

Well, now I can say that I've tried it. I saw two items on their chalkboard that caught my eye and hooked my stomach: a) Cream of Mushroom soup ($6.00) and b) Southern Fried Chicken ($13.50). \nI asked the bartender how long it would take to put together my order and he quickly replied, \"Five minutes.\" I placed my order and grabbed a stool at the bar, watching the numerous TV's on various sport channels. In perusing the room, I noticed that it wasn't very big and lined with some tables for four, but mostly smaller bar tables. The food came as promised... probably closer to eight minutes, but not a big deal since this was my take-home dinner. \nWhen I got home, my first reaction was shock in staring at the Southern Fried Chicken. It was comprised of a breaded, pounded, chicken breast fillet, covered with a creamy white mushroom gravy; it was accompanied by baked beans (sugary and thin sauce), Cole slaw (tangy and a bit too creamy), and mashed potatoes (creamy and buttery good). Don't get me wrong as I did enjoy the meal, but it was misnamed. Fried Chicken Fillet or Chicken Fried Chicken are more appropriate descriptions for this dish. Most chicken that I know come with bones with the following body parts: drumstick, thigh, wing, and breast. \nThe soup came in two small containers, but, like the chicken, was a little disappointing as there were no mushroom chunks or slices.  The mushroom puree was okay after I reheated it and dipped it with their \"housemate brown bread\". I could only finish half (one container of the soup) as the chicken entree was very filling. \nI wanted to give them 4 stars as the food and soup was tasty, but I had to knock them 1 star for relieving the chicken of its skeletal structure without notice.", "author": "Mike C."}

They have really interesting beer cocktail options and are worth a try.  The Irish American Coors and Guinness was really amusing.  Magners is also a favorite of mine and it is a highlight to get it on tap.  The food options are all really good, the chili is good and the Shepard's pie is amazing, and the beer is good.

I splurged a bit and ordered a shot of MIdleton for that reason. \n\nI am also throwing in an extra star for the waitress who when I asked her how their selection of Irish whiskeys was, gave me a look like I just walked into KFC and asked them if they have anything with chicken in it.

You see, we, meaning me and my crew of exceptionally awesome dorks, get really excited on music release days and often times will plan entire lunch hours surrounding the awesomeness of the new release. Chinese Democracy from Guns N Roses included not only a Google Calendar invite, but also included a trip to Virgin and a Chinese themed lunch. We take it seriously, yo.\n\nSo with the highly-anticipated release of Irish fave U2 today, it was a no brainer to travel through the rainy, soaked, puddle-ridden sidewalks of San Francisco an entire 3 BLOCKS from the office to have lunch at an authentic Irish eatery after racing to Virgin to pick up the album! Where oh where would this Irish celebration take place? Why, The Chiefton of course. They will rejoice and celebrate the Irish awesomeness that is U2 with us!\n\nAs soon as we walked in, our U2 Lunch organizers feverishly wrestled with the David Blaine proof trickery that is the CD wrapping. Upon its release, with gleaming smiles and happy dance glee, they anxiously asked the server if we could possibly have them play the new album for us on the sound system. I mean, this is U2 and U2 IS IRISH, right?\n\nWrong. Denied. Pass Go and do not collect $200. \"We will not play your CD.\"\n\nDevastated we still ordered our Guinness's and lamb burgers and Shepard's Pies and turkey sammiches, but, it just wasn't the same.

Nobody enjoys the taste of perfumey- battery -acid- cough- syrup (unless that really is your drink, and for that, I am sorry) unless you've had enough liquor beforehand to make the medicine go down with narry a shutter or body tremble.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've had it, I've ended nights with it, and I am sorry for my own mere existence for days afterwards.\n\nI was only there for a small amount of time, sipping on my Guinness (it was the first thing that came to my mind) on my way to a rehearsal. If I still worked in the area, I'd maybe grab some friends and kick it with some spuds and beer here.\n\nI made the mistake of stopping by on St. Patrick's Day last year and immediately walked out, lest I choked myself with a little green wrist band to deal with the crowds.\n\nOn a normal night though, I'd definitely stop in again for some pub grub and peace of mind. This night though, the crowd can get a little iffy. And for it only being 8:30pm, I can only imagine the debauchery it must house later on.

Our waiter was awesome, the waitress gave us a free beer for no apparent reason, and the food was better-than-expected pub grub.\n\nI'd happily go back any time.

Years ago, it use to be M&M's, where all the Chronicle journos use to hang out. Rumor has it, that they were there so much that the bar had a wire to the paper's newsroom. But I digress....\n\nIn my opinion, Chieftain has lost a step or two over there years.  On my last visit, I ordered my favorite burger in the world, The Chieftain burger....but dammit, it was missing some key ingredients! Eggs, mushrooms and bacon. Hopefully the Chief went back to his old burger, because it really did the place justice. The rest of the menu is pretty legit, not to mention they have daily specials that will make your mouth water. The vibe is still cool, very comfortable Irish pub, with great wood work, and feel good booths (that are ceremoniously named after people, cool). Not to mention, they serve Magner's tall-boy bottles, as all legitimate Irish institutions should. I miss the old neighborhood, I miss The Chieftain.\n\nOn a side note, I use to kick it around with The Chieftain soccer team. 2 or 3 successive promotions! You'll see the trophy's on the wall.

You have to have the spicy potato bites too! Let me stress it again comfort food at its finest.  Just swung by the other day and they've got a chalkboard that lists they're weekly specials.  And I've had the oxtail. That oxtail is like melted butter!  This is THE place to be at when you're local sports team are doing good too.  Was here when the NINERS went thru they're playoff run and can I say that I sure felt like I was at the game!  They also show rugby, soccer, and practically any sport you'd like to watch.

I know it's a pub, sports are on the tv, people are watching the NBA whatever hoo-haw was on. \nIt was packed. We finally grabbed a seat and a waitress' attention. We were not given any silverware or napkins. I was told the burger was amazing. I went on a whim and ordered the lamb burger. Big mistake. It smelled like rotting flesh. I kid you not. I love lamb, I love burgers, I love lamb burgers. This was just all bad, all wrong. I'm never one to have that much plate envy to the point where I can't eat my meal. This time I just couldn't eat it, one bite made me sick to my stomach. I had to steal my boyfriend's burger like a total baby. I really didn't want to be that plate stealing girl, but I had no choice. We were in a hurry, I couldn't send it back nor get the attention of the busy waitress to do so. Luckily, Zac thought it was the bee's knees (I don't know what he was on). I had to leave the Chieftain before the bill, because that place was too loud and if I had to smell more of the rotting flesh I was going to vomit. Seriously, that burger needs to be taken off the menu. For reals. The other burger gave me indigestion and also called for some Pepto. I will not come back here for food, unless I suddenly become some crazy sports fan.", "author": "Kristy H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-28", "description": "Came back with another friend to try the food -- It was outstanding!  And, here's why:\n\nDrinks - Perfect: Ordered Bloody Mary's, perfectly seasoned, with the right amount of garlic and bite. Seriously, this things have a kick! Also ordered a few rounds of J\u00e4ger and Jameson/Bailey's Guinness Bombs, \n\nStarters - Outstanding: Irish Jalepeno Bites, mashed potato with cheese, jalepeno and other goodness deep fried and served with a side of magic sauce. \n\nEntrees - Fantastic: Ordered the cheeseburger, fish and chips, and the Chieftain burger (the one with the egg). Burgers were perfectly cooked, just the right size -- burger patty was thick but not too thick,  ratio of bun to meat was ideal, all condiments come on the side, garnished with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. The egg on the Chieftain burger was a perfectly cooked over-medium egg, made just as ordered. The fish was probably great for people who like fish. The batter was perfect--great flavor, not too much, little greasy  but hit the spot. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fish eater, and I'm kinda picky about it when I do eat it. So, that said, the fish was HUGE, like the size of King Size Snicker bars, maybe 10 inches long by 1+ inches thick. That's just too much fish for. Others who love deep-fried cod would most likely disagree. Oh! And, the fries were big, fat rectangle style ones that were wonderfully addictive, some crispy, some not, some both, just the right combination.\n\nService - Fantastic: Fantastic drink and food services. Waitress, whose name I did not learn but she was the blonde waitress working Sunday night around 6pm, was super attentive, a glass never went dry, not too chatty but chose to engage when she wanted to, making it feel genuinely like she wanted to talk to us rather than having to because customer service is just part of the job (perfect!).\n\nAtmosphere: Busy but not too crowded.

The Shepard's pie had tasty ground beef, peas and carrots, and fresh herbs topped with fluffy mashed potato.

No complaints for the Irish on their drink selection--a big variety of beer on tap and lots of Irish whiskeys to choose from.

So, we land at The Chieftain, so many people in our group have been there before, \"landing\" there many other times.

Although, Foley's has beautiful people and beautiful Irish people working, and the Chieftain may not have as many actual 100% \"Irish\" folk working, it's all the same.

It's a good thing it's not conveniently located to me, 'cuz I really don'r need to eat any more fried food!\n\nMost of the time, The Chieftan manages to capture that old-world pub atmosphere.  I especially love coming in on a cold and rainy day for steaming hot irish coffee and fish & chips.  Plus, they have both Guiness and Murphys on tap (Don't know what else.  Who needs anything else on tap if you've got those two?) and a list of whiskys about a page long.  Very yummy!\n\nThe crab & chese dip and the curry & cheese fries deserve honorable mention.  But I barely get to have them because if I'm here, it's almost always for that fish & chips fix.\n\nTwo caveats though:\n\nIf there's a baseball or (american) football game on, The Chieftan loses all of its ambiance and becomes just another american-style sports bar, with all of the obnoxiousness that entails.  Avoid at those times.\n\nAlso, whoever does the scheduling needs to have his head checked.  Some weeks back, a bunch of my friends and I came here at midnight or so after seeing a movie.  And they had only one person working where there's usually four.  She was a trooper, and did her best.  But there's simply too much work for one person there.

I have lived in SF for about 12 years now and can tell you that I have driven past Chieftain many times a week and never imagined going in. All I can say is do not judge a book by its cover. Not that its in a creepy alley or transits lounging outside but its one of those places that never grabs your attention. Maybe cause they do not care if they grab your attention. I was there last night for one of my buddies birthday. The place has a lot of history and one can feel it in the air. It was opened in 1934 after the prohibition repeal. I assume since it is an Irish pub they have many of the traditional Irish lagers. They also have a full bar so one can order anything one pleases. We started with a few pints of Stella and some Czechvar Pilsners. We closed the night with a few Irish Car Bombs....dont know why I had these. They always make me feel like a college kid. I had the Fish and Chips....it was OK. I had some of my buddies Chieftain Shepherd's Pie and it was one of the most delicious plates I have ever had. It was a Baked Ground Lamb with Peas, Carrots and Onions with a Mashed Potato Crust. Served with Guinness Gravy and  House-Made Brown Bread. Man ohh man....talk about your 3,000 calorie plate...yummy!!!! The party I was with also raved about the Grilled Shrimp & Baby Spinach Salad.

We went to watch the Argentina/Mexico game, got a good seat, the place filled up really quickly with rabid soccer fans of all heritages, and then was transformed into 2 hours of jolly chaos. Hats off the the waitstaff for navigating the crowds, and cheers to the cooks for managing to keep quality food coming out of the kitchen. This place has the best fricking lamb burger I've ever had, yuuuummmm.", "author": "Renee A."}

Tonight I had a bloody mary that was actually really good and it was only $4.\n\nI wouldn't have guessed this, but the smoked turkey & avocado sandwich was actually better than the cheeseburger.  And I feel like the sandwich is a good compromise because you get your fried quotient in the steak fries that come with the sandwich, but the sandwich isn't fried so at least it's sorta healthy?  The sandwich was on great thick wheat bread and the pear chutney spread was very nice with the turkey and cheddar.  The cheeseburger was sorta flat and boring and just not that impressive.  Oh well.  \n\nBoo for having the Rutgers/Stanford women's college bball game on the projection screen and the Chargers/Colts game on a tiny old TV in the corner.  Huh?", "author": "Michelle K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-05-06", "description": "Yeah, well, if you like psuedo Irish pubs and eclectic pub food, this is as good a place as any in the City.  Eric, the day manager / chef, greets all lunch customers when not directing the cooking.  All the wait staff say \"hi\" like they mean it, and after a couple of visits know who you are, and shortly thereafter ask if you are having \"your usual.\"  Nothing better reccommends a saloon (sorry, pub).\n\nThe food is not cusine, but is interesting, with sometimes outstanding specials, and is hearty.\n\nUnusual for commercial San Francisco (as opposed to neighborhood places), you'll even sometimes get a drink comped.\n\nCasual, nice staff, sometimes interesting guests, and reasonable.

I have even foolishly spent a St. Patricks day here (when I was younger and not as wise, of course). Every time I come here I have a good time. Even the last time when I was hiding in the corner nearly falling asleep in my water. Yes, that's right, water.....no it was not an impostor, it was really me! I figured if a red bull and coffee couldn't wake me up perhaps I shouldn't drink alcohol. Don't judge!! Anyhow, this place is, in very simple terms, warm and comfortable, if maybe in a slightly generic way. No pretension (though I could see this change with the rapid gentrification of SOMA), just a good place with good food, good drinks and good people. I only wish they did not write their specials on a chalkboard on the wall outside that some douchebag will deface to read boob balls by the end of the evening.", "author": "Drue C."}

I've had the lamb burger twice now since, and both have been excellent, served on a cibatta-type roll with fries. the fries are nice and thick steak fries, no wimpy potatoes here. i've even been here for brunch now, too, and though my curry vegetable pie was just ok (needed to be spicier), it was hearty and did wonders for a hungover stomach. the traditional breakfast that my companions got looked pretty good, too. oh yeah, plus, they serve beer. happy hour starts at 4pm.", "author": "Tom H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-11-14", "description": "the chieftan is the nearest possible place to my house (yep, we live down here) to grab some food/drink.  its proximity alone -- putting aside that it's so homey, has a terrific  beer selection, serves decent bar food, and is open whenever i want it to be -- gives me tremendous incentive to like the place.  and i do like it, very much.  there are a few of things that, if addressed, would make me (and possibly others out there) want to go there much  more often, though:  (1) i wish there was just one more salad option on the otherwise better-than-your-usual-bar menu -- i.e., \"california\"-style, more veggie-focused, with a light dressing, and lettuce that isn't iceberg.  (2) they need to do something about the fries -- they look terrific -- the plank-shaped, steak kind, well-browned and crispy (so far so good) -- but they have no flavor whatsoever.  none.  'cept maybe fryer grease flavor.  bleh.  but (3) it's not worth substituting the side salad for the fries, even though the upcharge is minimal, since it's just a bit of iceberg topped with a few carrot shreds and rings of raw onion (see #1).  \n\nmy husband loves his burger with a fried egg on it, and the smoked turkey/avocado sandwich is good.  one day i'll go waaaay off my diet and get the fish/chips (hopefully by then they'll have done something to improve the chips) or the cottage pie.  \n\nservice is typically friendly, although one evening earlier this week there was a new/different server (new to me, anyway) who was grouchy and unhelpful.", "author": "bug s."}
