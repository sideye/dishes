Pizza makes everything better, right? All the roommates were around last night, so we decided to get delivery...which turned into pickup. \n\nWe got the \"You Say Potato,\" a combination of sliced and roasted potatoes, roasted garlic cloves, and pesto sauce and \"Big Applewood Bacon,\" barbeque chicken, bacon, tomato slices, and cheddar.\n\nMy all time favorite pizza is a mashed potato and bacon pizza (BAR in New Haven, CT-- I miss this so much) so this potato pizza didn't quite live up to that standard. The crust on this was soft, but not chewy. Toppings were nicely done-- the garlic was soft and the potatoes were cooked through tenderly. The pesto had good color but flavor wasn't that strong.\n\nOur barbeque chicken pizza was juicy, but severely burnt on the bottom. Giant hunks of white meat chicken made it a tad difficult to eat-- I wish they were more bite-size. Bacon was okay but not super delicious.\n\nSeems like a solid spot.", "author": "Nicole H."}

She (didn't catch her name but she had a very long straight brown hair in a side braid) took my order, put the pizza in the oven to heat, dealt with the money and then went to take the pizza out.

I could tell by looking at the pie that the cheese was congealed, which meant it wasn't fresh out of the oven, which was WHY I asked for another two minutes. She ARGUED with me. She was wrong; I don't know why she thought it was her place to argue with the customer who wanted something totally reasonable, let alone when she was incorrect. \n\n3. When she went to take the pizza out the second time, she put all the pieces of pizza on top of each other.

I asked her to fix the slices so they weren't overlapping. She used the tongs, and then also USED HER FINGERS. The same fingers that had just handed money, which everyone who works a cash register KNOWS is FILTHY. This is a huge hygiene issue. She then did NOT close the box. Just ... put the tongs down and stepped back. Who the hell walks out of a pizza parlor with their box of pizza OPEN? \n\n4.

I've been here several times before and the pizza was pretty decent, but tonight ordered a large pepperoni, 1/2 bacon and was beyond disappointed.\n\nThe crust was very, very chewy, thin and tough underneath. The cheese did not cover the entire pizza, there was a giant ball of it on one piece (did they get distracted and forget to spread it around?). The pepperoni and cheese had a very re-heated taste and texture. All in all it looked and tasted like they through some ingredients on an old pizza and put it back in the oven.\n\nI called to complain, asked for the manager, never got him. The employee who answered though seemed to believe the pizza was fine, and offered to keep his ears open for other customers complaints about the crust. Apparently they have to have several bad pizzas in a row before they care?\n\nI've never thrown pizza away in my life, but this sucker was literally inedible. I got a frozen pizza from whole foods instead and tasted like pizza heaven in comparison.\n\nMistakes happen, but no one could have even looked at this thing.

Pizza (around $4) and a beer will net you the beer at only an extra $2, and you can get an Anchor. How is that not a steal? Pizza, soda, and salad for a little over $8. Again, unless you're eating at the Costco food court (which kicks butt, by the way), you're not going to get a deal like this. I always eat in because I don't do the delivery thing, but you're going to get a decent portioned slice, and if you choose the potato pie, you won't be disappointed. It has thicks slices of potatoes and whole garlic cloves on it. Love this slice, but you can't really go wrong with the others, and honestly, you're going to get a flavorful, non-cardboard-like crust that isn't overly thick either. It's not that far off from the way a NY-slice crust is made. Cashiers are quick and know what they're doing. I'm pretty sure they're lit most of the time, but meh. You probably are as well. There's even a huge flat-screen showing sports and lots of Giants memorabilia. This place is always empty too, so don't worry about a crowd or line.

It was a very specific craving: I wanted New York-style pizza, with the thin crust, stretchy cheese and greasy pepperonis.  And since there aren't many NY-style pizza places that deliver to my area in SOMA, I remembered someone mentioning that EFNY had just opened recently REALLY CLOSE BY.\n\nI looked online at their menu, ordered, and was told that the wait would be 46 minutes (what an odd number).  Less than 40 minutes later, my doorbell rang and my pizza was here!  My glorious hot, cheesy, medium pizza with pepperonis (the total plus tax was about $17) was here!  I tipped the delivery guy, and he seemed really surprised.\n\nThe pizza was exactly what I wanted it to be: thin crust that didn't completely fold and droop when I picked it up, topped with stringy gooey hot cheese and slices of pepperoni.  Everything was perfectly spiced and baked, and a medium was enough for 3 meals (I suppose I could've finished the whole thing in one sitting, but that would've negated a week of working out).\n\nOverall, it's my new go-to place for pizza delivery.
