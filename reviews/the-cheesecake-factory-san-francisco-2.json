They have a nice outdoor seating area, which was perfect for the good weather that day. \n\nThe two of us shared a Skinnylicious Sangria, which tasted good, but was 3/4 ice! It would have been great to have a little more of the actual drink, especially since the ice melted so quick and then just made it all so watery. The bigger disappointment however, came when we saw the check. That tiny glass cost $13. The price was not written on the menu, but we didn't bother asking since neither of us expected it to cost that much!\n\nAs for the food, my boyfriend had the Chicken Madeira since that's always our go-to. A stellar dish as a whole, but his mashed potatoes were really lumpy with huge chunks of potato that were not mashed at all! I ordered a side of mashed potatoes for myself, which were just perfect, and just had a bunch of their whole wheat bread! Its undoubtedly the best bread I've every had, and it was what I went there for that morning. I asked for extra after finishing what they first put on your table. Its so good, I even went there the next morning, bought a whole warm baguette from their bakery, and finished the entire thing as breakfast!", "author": "Haylee M."}

It was crowded and had a long wait, but this place usually has a long wait for dinner.\n\nThis restaurant is at the very top of Macy's at Union Square and has both indoor and outdoor seating. If you choose to sit outside, you get to enjoy the nice view of Union Square without getting too cold because there are heat lamps. We chose to sit inside.\n\nOnce seated, you're given a bread basket with 2 kinds of bread. I don't know what type of breads they are, but one of them was a brown bread roll and the other was a white bread roll. Both breads tasted good and are complimentary too!\n\nWe ordered Factory Nachos, Spaghetti and Meatballs, and the Steak Diane with Herb Crusted Salmon. We both thought the Factory Nachos were very good and they give you a big portion too! We had to try to stop ourselves from finishing it because we wanted to make space for our entrees.\n\nI chose the spaghetti and I thought it was good, but not the best spaghetti I've ever had. My boyfriend chose the Steak Diane with Herb Crusted Salmon and he liked it a lot! His dish came with mashed potatoes too. I tried some of his food and I thought it was very good too!

Being on vacation we decided to end our last night in the city at this so called restaurant due to the view and outside seating. Worst Mistake Ever..\n\nWe came to the host and put our name on the list and were told it was going to be a 50 minute wait, which it was. We understood because it's Saturday night and many people like the view as well. We waited right around 50 minutes and got to our seat. We never got introduced by our waitress and ordered drinks that took roughly 15 minutes to arrive. We also didn't get bread for about 15 minutes and when we did, we never got butter.. I then ordered a Rib eye \"MEDIUM RARE\" with Mac & Cheese & Green Beans and my girlfriend ordered Farfalle Pasta. Come to find out they were out of that so she ordered the Shrimp Angel Hair. We waited 1 hour for our food and the Manager did come out and apologize due to the wait time. Which we were semi ok with due to the scenery. We then recieved our meals 3-4 minutes after the manager had talked to us. My steak was WELL DONE, and I never recieved the MAC n Cheese which they later brought out after my meal was done. My green beans were cold as if they were in the fridge and thrown on a plate. Her Pasta was bland but was edible. As we got our check they couldn't even have some type of sincerity to give us the free mac and cheese that came out after my plate was gone. Why would I want to just eat Mac N Cheese?\n\nI'm truly just disappointed on waiting so long for our food and it to turn out so bad. I didn't even eat my meal due to it being so so awful. The service was just terrible and truly disappointing. I know we will never come here and ever step foot into another CheeseCake Factory.", "author": "Alex L."}

A friend of mine came into the Union Square location for a late Friday afternoon lunch. We ended up snagging seats in the bar area and ordering drinks and appetizers. We had the burger sliders, add cheese and bacon, and HOLY COW...THE BEST SLIDERS I'VE EVER HAD!! Our waiter was awesome, my water glass was never empty (which is a common occurrence for me!), he gave food recommendations after listening to what we were in the mood for, and was even nice enough to give us recommendations of bars and lounges to visit the rest of the weekend!\n\nThe only reason that they got minus one star is the drink prices. They seem a little high for what they are...and because it's a corporate chain, I feel like they have their standard drink mixes that aren't strong at all, so not sure that it's anything against the bartender.", "author": "Shelby H."}

They offer out door seating which has great views of downtown. On the other hand their hostess is need training on how to sit people because their wait time went from 15 minutes turned into 1hr and all three of the hostess said the same thing five minutes I was ready to walk out at this point until the manager came and asked told me five more minutes I'm like that's what they have been saying for the last hr? Initially it was 15 min now we're at 1 hr and everyone that is coming in is getting seated so I was bothered already! So a customer overheard the manager and he said theirs no excuse we just got hear and we got a table right away ! So things are not looking good already so with that being said we finally got a table. \n\nFood wise - we got fettuccini Alfredo lunch portions are a good size however I wish the chicken was cut in smaller pieces. And the sauce was broken down but the flavor was good. \n\nCrab Cakes- bite size crab cakes I loved them they were small but full of flavor and packed with crab meat that is a must for sure if you like crab cakes!\n\nCalamari- light and airy fried to perfection it was really delicious and they give you two dipping sauces which is better than just one like most places do!\n\nKids corn dogs- really good and great portion fries were nice and crisp overall the food was really good which I was surprised considering most reviews are about the food . But I'm glad I had patience to stay and try it because it was worth it great views and food was delicious.!! Would I go their again? Of course I would just be more cautious about the wait time !", "author": "Mirna P."}

However, my experiences at this Cheesecake Factory have set the bar way lower. The problem is that this place is too busy, which albeit is more the fault of the city of San Francisco for being so restaurant chain-averse: Cheesecake Factory is one of the only well-known restaurants near Union Square. The wait here is often 1+ hours long, and service is mediocre because the restaurant knows people will still come. \n\nI've ate here a few times before I more or less gave up on the restaurant's service and wait times, and I started ordering take-out from here more often because the food is still usually good *if you get the right meal,* but I've still had a lot of problems with this:\n\n1) I've ordered take-out and they say that it will be ready at x time, and it actually isn't ready until 40 minutes after x time.\n2) Last week I got take out Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breast, which I've gotten many times. I took a bite out of it and it something hard. I spat it back out and dug through it and found a nice ~1 in long bone in there. \n3) I ordered take out, walked all the way there, walked all the way home to find out they gave me the wrong meal. I called them because I wanted the right meal and was put on hold for a few minutes and started walking back to the restaurant. 45 minutes later when I got back to the restaurant, I was still on hold. They took another ~20 minutes preparing the right meal and didn't even refund me. \n\nI've lost my patience with this restaurant and don't plan on going back anytime soon.", "author": "Kristin A."}

The outdoor seating overlooking Union Square, perhaps the widest menu in town, and ummm... cheesecake. \n\nIt's touristy but that also makes it perfect for out-of-the-country visitors for some \"American\" food - portion size and all. Something for everyone because EVERYTHING is on the menu. And then you top it off with cheesecake. But with so many items, it's quantity over quality. \n\nPro tip: The line is notoriously long with typically over an hour waits. If you don't need the view, there's a separate line for the bar which includes a couple of small tables. You'll be seated way faster and the servers are just as friendly.", "author": "Jon L."}

It has the best view of Union Square, especially during Christmas time with they have the tree up and the ice skating rink.\n\nI recently came back here with my mom on Friday for some mother-daughter bonding lunch while we were in the city shopping for Xmas. I really think Cheesecake Factory should rent out the floor below them of Macy's, it's not like people really shop department stores anymore anyway. It's always a super duper long line here because of the view. The wait was 45 minutes this time. The whole front desk area was crammed with people waiting for a table. I had time to go down a few levels and grab a white elephant gift. \n\nOur server was nice as always whenever you go to any CF. I ordered the Thai Coconut Lime Chicken and my mom got the Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp. Both were very good. \n\nGreat Cheesecake Factory location, just make sure you put your name down first before going shopping so that you can minimize your wait time.", "author": "Ramona G."}

He looked down, a little ashamed. \n\nI lightly scolded \"Guests always find out and feel bad about it.\"\n\nSeriously, The Cheesecake Factory, you're better than this and quality and consistency are your hallmarks.\n\nOf course the food was good, The Cheesecake Factory does everything well, but service in aggregate, rounded up to a sad C.\n\nPlease let this have been a one day holiday crush/glitch but if not, fix.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

The wait was about 40 minutes so they gave us a buzzer to let us know when it was our turn. Our turn came and we got seated. About 10 minutes later, our server came by and asked us what we would like to drink. We ordered waters all around and some lemonades. We got our drinks 10 minutes later and the server left without saying a word. We're sipping our drinks and looking at the menu deciding what we want to order when we realize that they haven't given us any bread and butter yet. The server comes back 15 minutes later to take our orders and after he finishes going around the table, we asked if we can get some bread as well as some drink refills since we had pretty much finished them while we were waiting for him to come back. He comes back, you guessed it, another 10 minutes later with a single basket of bread for our party of 6 guys. That's not even the worst part: The brown rye bread was fuckin BURNT black and hard as a rock. If you're gonna burn the bread, at least burn the white bread that no one wants but you give us anyway. At that point, we were hella hungry from waiting so long so we just ate the white bread, you know, the one that Cheesecake Factory isn't famous for that didn't get burnt. Anyways, so we eventually got our real food and while the server was delivering everyone's plate, we asked for refills of our drinks so we wouldn't die of dehydration as well as another basket of rocks, I mean bread, preferably not burnt this time. Safe to say, we never got the bread and our drink refills came when we were almost done with our food. Keyword: almost. I ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta and I never got to finish it because my friend finished his plate so the server took his plate away then assumed I was done too and took mine away without even asking if I was done. I still had like 3 whole shrimps and about 2 good forkfuls (is that a word?) of pasta left when it was taken away from me and I still think about it every night before I go to sleep. I always wonder how different my life would be if I was able to enjoy those last couple bites but it's ok because life goes on. Alright so back to the review. As I mentioned in the beginning of the review, it was my cousin's birthday so one of our friends snuck off to tell the waiter so the employees can ambush us later and sing the happy birthday song to my cousin while he sits there awkwardly not knowing what to do with a dumbass look on his face. As you may or may not know, it's usually tradition for the person celebrating their birthday to be given a free slice of cheesecake during their visit. The waiter comes back 5 days later holding the World's Smallest Plate with the tiniest scoop of vanilla ice cream I've ever seen in my life. My bad, last time I checked I thought this was The Cheesecake Factory, not Baskin Robbins. We thought it was some kind of sick joke and Ashton Kutcher was gonna pop out telling us we got Punk'D...it wasn't a joke. This was real. They had the audacity to tell us they ran out of cheesecake talking about some \"This is all we had\". Overall, the food was good but the service was atrocious. Better off driving down to Hillsdale but I mean hey if you're feeling kinky and in the mood to get choked during your meal from their famous rock bread, no water, and a side of disappointment, hit up Cheesecake Factory in Union Square.\n\nFun Fact: I typed this entire review using my two middle fingers", "author": "Ali O."}

I highly recommend sharing your meal with your friends, unless you're already planning on taking home leftovers.\n\nThis Cheesecake Factory is located next to Union Square, and if you choose to dine outdoors, then you get a nice view that overlooks SF's most popular tourist attraction. We came here in early November, so the big tree and the ice rink was already set-up! The only major con about eating outdoors are all the pigeons, so if you're not a fan, then make sure you specify that you want indoor seating only. Since we came here on a Saturday afternoon, it was a standard 30-minute to 1-hour wait.\n\nWhen we were finally seated, we had an awesome waitress who had lots of energy and also gave us amazing service. For food, we started with the Factory Nachos, which was a huge nacho dish complete with guac, salsa, spicy chicken, jalape\u00f1os, and sour cream. We shared this amongst 4 people, and it was so good that it went away in less than 10 minutes. After our appetizer, my friend and I split the Factory Burger. It was super moist and packed with flavor, and describing it is making my taste buds water because it was so succulent!  Of course, we had to order a cheesecake to finish off our meal. We got the specialty birthday cake cheesecake, which tasted like a funfetti ice cream cake! ALSO, the complimentary bread that they serve always wins me over, especially the whole wheat.\n\nOverall, we had a great lunch at The Cheesecake Factory.

I choose the cobb salad. \nNever have I had such an awful looking salad placed in front of me...and this was after about 45 minutes of waiting for our orders. \nWhat I received was a plate full of lettuce that was pale and old looking. There were about 4 bite sized pieces of chicken, a tablespoon or so of diced crumbled egg, 3 or 4 small bite size cubes of avocado, about 2 tablespoons of diced tomato, and a couple tablespoons of bacon...maybe.  \nAny other time at any restaurant you usually receive at least a half breast of sliced chicken, near a whole sliced boiled egg, plenty of tomato's, bacon, and cheese. The cobb salad is normally a meal. \nThe salads in front of my sisters were no better looking. It was insulting.\nI know it was not the servers fault, but I gently inquired as to why the salads were like this...she said they were all proportioned out. ????\nWhat does that mean? Proportioned for a toddler? I let her know that for the price of the salad, 4 bites of chicken just seemed really odd. She talked to her manager and then brought us back a small bowl of chicken pieces to share...and there would be \"no additional charge\". \nOverall, this experience was awful and disappointing.

Small, mis-proportioned, and discoloured, I was not keen to even try to finish them. \n\nOn the lighter side, I chose the Vanilla Bean cheesecake, this was what I remembered. My biggest issue was not the food though, it was the wait time. There was no issue getting an outdoor table for lunch. But the waitress took time bringing water, then the bread. We sat for over half an hour just waiting for our meal. Then getting an order for cheesecake in. Waiting another lengthy time, just for them to bring us a slice of cheesecake. My lunch stretched out to three hours. \n\nNot only was the wait time like watching grass grow, there was an issue and we were charged another tables bill.

You've been to one, I feel you've been to all. \n\nThis particular Cheesecake Factory is very busy and the waits can be quite long, even during the week. And that's obviously because it's in a touristy spot, where many visitors and locals alike go to dine. Now, I've been to this location plenty of times, so I'm not going to knock them on that.\n\nI must say I've had many positive experiences here before, but alas, this review pertains to my most recent visit, wherein I ordered the pepperoni pizza. The pizza came undercooked. The cheese looked like one solid light-yellow mass, instead of golden yellow gooeyness. The crust was not crisp or toasty. It was unbaked softness of thawed out dough. So it was a bummer. Ended up giving it to the homeless gentleman who serves as the unofficial doorman for Macy's and who has amassed quite a collection of donated Cheesecake Factory leftovers.", "author": "Crissy C."}

Definitely do not go here if you are hungry and expect to be fed no later than an hour. The night we went, which was a random Saturday, we had to stand in line inside Macy's for a very long time before taking the elevator to the restaurant. Also, the elevator is such a ramshackle that it can only take a handful of people because the weight capacity exceeds after like 6 people step in ( depending on their size ofcourse - could be 3 people ). Anyways, when we finally made it to the restaurant we had to wait some more to get seated. After our buzzer went off, we approached the hostess at the front thinking we were ready to be seated but, nope! We had to wait some more while they called everyone else's names. Finally, after about 2 hours, we get a table outside on the roof. It was night time and a bit chilly, typical SF weather. Our table was right underneath the heater and it kept burning our heads. We requested to switch tables which they accommodated. We ordered avocado egg rolls  for appetizer but were informed the kitchen was all out after waiting for 20 minutes. My friends mom asked for their famous \"brown bread\" and guess what? They were out! At this point we became a little frustrated with all the waiting and their poor inventory management of ingredients. I randomly ordered chicken samosas instead. There were three tiny triangles that came and were super greasy. Didn't bother with anything else and went straight to ordering main meals. I ordered Tuscan Chicken from their Skinnylicious menu and everyone else on the table just played it safe and ordered salads instead, haha. The only good memory from this experience was the view and bagpipes playing on the street in Union Square. I definitely do not plan to go back here.", "author": "Natasha S."}

I waited about 45min and someone other then my waiter brought out my food. I noticed lots of bacon sticking out, so I mention that she must have the wrong table. She then informed me that that's what I ordered! I then told her I have never eaten bacon in my Whole life. She said well that's what you ordered, And walked away. I then asked the next person I saw and asked her for my waiter, and she told me he was on a break. I told her the situation, she left, came back and said he put in a bacon burger. She then left as well. At no time did anybody offer to get me what I wanted.\n\nMy server came back and I informed him, her was very sorry for the mistake. At this point I had ate the fries but nothing else. He offered to replace my burger, I told him I couldn't wait any longer for what I had ordered. I brought me the check and offered me some cheesecake. He made it sound like he was going to give it to me for the mistake. I asked for it to go, he then gave me the cheesecake, and my check. I had still been rung up for the burger, I then noticed also the cheesecake. So I paid for a burger I didn't even eat. \n\nI will never be back!!! \n\nCame back to visit again, as I told my staff I would take them where ever the would like. I'm going to make this simple, service was horrible no where to be found, other servers said they couldn't help because they weren't our servers, wrong food still delivered again, still charged for it! Then as I went to the bathroom, I come back to the table, my employees were so upset because the server told them how to tip, and made a comment on how teenager don't know how to do it.

I know most people are not afraid of them so you probably wouldn't care... but guess what?! I know you all care about sanitation when you come to the restaurant, and let me be honest with you. There is literally NO way for Cheesecake Factory to keep this place clean. None of servers cared about it.\n\nThese pigeons walked around to find foods, SAT ON THE TABLE even if there was no food (I saw them touching empty plates that was set for next customers), ATE LEFTOVERS(servers didn't take them away for so long), flew above your head & foods....etc. It was really, really gross. I strongly recommend you to sit inside if you want to enjoy your lunch/dinner.\n\nAnd what about foods?\n\n- fried mac and cheese : comes with 4 balls of fried mac and cheese. crispy enough and it wasn't too greasy or cheesy thanks to tomato sauce that came with. Pretty good.\n\n- avocado salad(?) : baaaaad....i could taste that avocado and greens were not fresh at all. Tortilla chips tasted weird too. I would never get this again, or at least not from this location. I left 70% of it.\n\n- chicken salad : I don't have a picture but this is what my moma got.

What's so special about this one? 8th floor outdoor rooftop of Macy's in DT SF, that's what! The view of union square is worth the wait, doesn't matter if you're a tourist or local. Heating lamps for those always cold folks or opt for dining indoors. Take the special elevator directly up or save time waiting and use 7 sets of escalators to view what Macy's women's/home has to offer. Take note of Starbucks on the 4th floor, Burger Bar on the 6th, and Boudin/Jamba/etc. in the basement.\n\n35 min wait for two at 9pm Saturday night for outdoor seating! Time went by relatively fast but boy was the atrium packed! There was one rude hostess that obviously needed to go home and take a chill pill, but everyone else was polite. Someone probably told her to take a break cuz she disappeared for 20 min. Sometimes I forget how many tourists there are in the city; hosts ask for a US phone # and many didn't have one. Another observation: the bill holder has a card explaining customary tips in the US. Must be nice for servers to be paid better than minimum wage in the U.K. and elsewhere.\n\nPatrizah A. took great care of us-- super sweet and cheerful with a genuine smile, checked back at the right times and offered cheesecake recommendations since they discontinued white chocolate blueberry. The new cold brew Coffee & Cream Chocolate Supreme is a hit with caffeine lovers. Ultimate Red Velvet!\n\nWindow seats! Our original table wasn't clean so we got better ones on the left side with fewer people around. Those seats got filled right before we left at 11! 12:30am closing time on weekends. \n\nFood! I tried something new but similar to my Chicken Bellagio. Ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta with crisp coated thinly pound chicken atop mildly spicy bow tie Cajun pasta with mushrooms and bell peppers. Yum! Couldn't finish this 2200 cal dish (oh heck no, half was for the next day) since I cleaned out my little Caesar salad and indulged in calamari. Sophie N. got the Angel hair pasta with shrimp, asparagus add on. Succulent shrimp! Strange how this dish is listed as Garlic Lemon Shrimp online, asparagus already added in.\n\nExcellent experience on the rooftop once again-- I hope it stays that way!

Oh wait... That's right! It's the ultimate tourist trap for all travelers and locals alike!\n\nLocation:\n\nYou can find the restaurant at the tippy top floor of the Macy's within San Francisco's Union Square. Just take an elevator and enjoy the 45 seconds of awkward silence as the elevator rushes people to the top. From there you will find a dimmed restaurant with thousands of tourists and disgruntled employees. On the other hand, good luck finding parking! Your best bet is to park inside one of the parking garages unless you're daring enough to walk 5-10 blocks from the area. Be prepared with some cash as some parking places take cash only.\n\nSetting:\n\nAs I mentioned before, the CCF is at the tippy top floor of the gigantic Macy's. This place is great for a h-angry someone who ADORES waiting 20-120 minutes for a seat to dine-in. Not to mention ordering a slice of cheesecake to-go can be just as long as waiting for a seat to dine-in. While the views at the top are spectacular during the night time, there's seating inside of the restaurant and on the outdoor balcony. While this restaurant is noisy full of chatter from different patrons, if you're looking for a quiet and romantic dinner, I highly suggest you look elsewhere.\n\nCustomer Service:\n\nI feel the pain for the employees who have to work twice as hard to ensure everyone is happy. However, I have to give them kudos for working at the busiest CCF on the planet. Despite all the patrons coming in and out of the restaurant, they do a pretty decent job at handling the crowd. On the other hand, if you only want a slice of cheesecake to-go, I recommend ordering through the phone instead of waiting in line to order something.\n\nFood:\n\nI only have the Chocolate Macadamia slice of cheesecake. It was BOMB, smooth, and nutty. Even though there's a HUGE chunk of whipped cream on the side, the cheesecake itself is best shared with two people. On the other hand, for the $8-9 a slice, it would be a better option to find a dessert place who sells the same thing at a lower price.\n\nOverall:\n\nDespite the high prices, tourists, and all the crazy schemes happening at this CCF location, I'll give it a plus for the views at the top. However, if I were you, I'd find somewhere else to eat in SF that serves decent cheesecake at a lower price.", "author": "Aubrey D."}

It was the perfect snack to hold us over till our meals came. \n\nI love the festivity of this area around this time of year so it's a great spot to try during the holidays. What I would suggest, and may do in the future, is to come on a not-so-busy day and sit outside and enjoy the tree and skating from above.

We went on a Monday evening around 7pm and wait time for four people was about 15 min to sit inside and getting seated right away if we wanted the outside. It was a bit chilly so it made sense why people would prefer the inside. Our food arrived fairly quickly and in the mean time we had crab bites with mustard sauce which were just delicious. Our food was pretty great! We had no complaints whatsoever and our server was really attentive. We went for a birthday and we surprised the birthday boy with a black out cake to sing happy birthday and the staff made the experience pretty memorable. They got everyone else around involved and made it a special day for my friend. Would definitely recommend this location. The staff is great and the food is always pretty solid.", "author": "Melanie L."}

This particular one is extra nice because it's located on the top floor of Macy's which overlooks Union Square. The view up here is absolutely amazing. With that said, this also means it's quite a touristy spot and it's crazy crowded. They gave a buzzer for when your table is ready, which allowed us to wander around the floors only to wait some more even after our buzzer went off. It's a Monday night and somehow still incredibly packed.\n\nWe ended up sitting inside, which got quite stuffy. It also didn't help with how hot it got as we shared a bottle of wine. One of my favorites here has to be their complimentary bread, especially the honey oat one --yum! Make sure to ask for extra of those. Between the two of us, we ordered to share the Crab Cake Bites ($8), Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($18), and Steak Diane ($29). Everything was yummy and came in huge portions! I know the menu gets intimidating here, but my go-to has and will always be the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.\n\nSince we were so stuffed, it didn't leave us room for the cheesecake.

It's our go-to place when we are shopping in the city because it's easy and there are lots of choices. I loved this place until the last three times we've eaten here, which have all been bad. So, after our last visit here this weekend I think we won't be coming back again. Sad. We had bad service and bad food. I wouldn't normally give this place a one star review but it was bad three times in a row. UGH. \n\nThe service was SLOW. And our server (Glendi? not sure of her name) was bored by our presence and totally inefficient. We asked for water, and she brought one. Had to ask for another one. She never asked if I wanted another drink after I finished my drink. She didn't refill ice tea until asked. Just totally nonchalant about everything. I would give the service a D. But, and the end when she brought our bill, she made sure to put a notation on the receipt that \"tip is not included.\" Duh. And rude. \n\nMy husband ordered the club sandwich. It was DRY AS A BONE. Burnt toast that looked and tasted like it had been under the warmer far too long. (C'mon, how do you ruin a club sandwich?) I ordered the Orange Chicken with rice and vegetables. Basically, we all know that this is breaded fried chicken pieces that they put in different sauces so I know what I'm getting. I've ordered it before also. Well, the chicken was also DRY AS A BONE. It looked like they drizzled a tiny bit of orange sauce over the chicken after it was already on the plate. Weird right??? So I waited 10-15 minutes for her to come back and I asked for a side of orange chicken sauce to put on my food. She comes back with this dish of sauce that had EXACTLY one teaspoon of extra sauce. I'm not even kidding. So I gave up. And I gnawed on my chicken. Gross. \n\nWe had two lunch entrees, two pieces of cheesecake, on daiquiri and one ice tea. It was $75.00. \n\nNO. NO.

The one in Palo Alto was a bad experience but I chose to ignore it under assumption that it was a long weekend and they might have been short staffed. This one in union square is even worse. To avoid long wait, the husband & I sat at the bar. It smelled of alcohol and something sweet but hey that's what you get for sitting at a bar right? Let's get to food now, shall we. I ordered a California guacamole salad that I have tried at least 50 times but never has it been so flavorless. The husband ordered Bang Bang shrimp and chicken which is usually a crowd pleaser and generally dependable in terms of taste and flavor but we were wrong. It tasted mediocre, the curry flavor was missing. The reason I go to cheesecake is because I find their food consistently tasty but if it's not going to maintain that then we will take our business elsewhere.

Getting to the 8th floor is a bit of a hassle, you have to wait for the stupid elevator which is always crowded. There is definitely confusion on where exactly to pick up to-go orders so be sure to not be afraid to sternly make one of the 500 servers walking around doing nothing direct you where you need to go. By time I finally got the food and could bumrush to the front of the elevator line to hurry back down to the 1st floor, I was happy. The pastas were mediocre at best of course, but the CHEESECAKE, wow let me tell you, I was actually surprised at how good the cheesecake was. \n\nI had a slice of the Red Velvet, and a slice of their 30th anniversary special cheesecake that was like a vanilla and chocolate marble mix. Both were SO creamy, SO decadent, SO delicious. And the question to be asked is why would you go to The Cheesecake Factory for anything other than cheesecake? In fact, they should stop trying to outdo themselves by having such a complicated menu and just serve Cheesecake and coffee only because their lack of organization (at this location especially) doesn't help anybody. \n\n4 stars for the cheesecake ONLY. Oh, and 4 stars because the pasta portions for to-go were quite HUGE, considering the price. I hope they are like that everytime.", "author": "Marquis A."}

Being in such a prime location, the wait can be especially long during peak hours. I've come here twice or so over the previous year and have found it to be rather mediocre overall. \n\nThe service was not great, but not terribly bad as well. The food however always ends up being especially bland despite its nice and flavorful appearance. Their fried appetizers are somewhat decent with good heat and crisp, but their pasta tends to be overcooked such that there is a lack of firmness. I've tried another Cheesecake Factory branch in the past and find this establishment to be quite lacking in food quality compared to it. The cheesecake here is quite disappointing as well with it being a mush that tastes of cream and sugar without much substance and depth of flavor.\n\nThe main positive of this restaurant has to be its location though. If you're able to get an outdoor seat for lunch on a nice sunny day in SF then you'll be treated to a wonderful view of union square though more often or not, there's going to be construction going on.", "author": "Joshua M."}

I usually have a meal while I'm there too. \n\nThe location on Union Square in the heart of San Francisco makes this Cheesecake Factory maybe the busiest in the entire chain. The confusing part about this location is finding the entrance. If I recall, the actual restaurant is on the 8th floor of the historic Macy's building and you can only get there via the elevator entered at street level. I've been to this location several times and every-time there's a wait. Is it worth the wait? Probably not, but if you like cheesecake like I do then it's well worth it. It's up to you to decide. Oh, maybe this tip might help too... there's two lines (1) for the restaurant (2) for takeout. So make sure you're in the right one! \n\nThe lunch & dinner menu is typical American grub like hamburgers, but also small plates, salads, and specialties too. Who's fooling who?

I've had attentive servers who are super nice on certain days then extremely rude, inattentive waitstaff on other days. This inconsistency really bothers me as bad service can turn any restaurant experience sour quite quickly.\n\nOne good thing about this Cheesecake Factory is that it is easy to access by various different modes of public transportation (BART, MUNI, bus).

Easy enough right?!?!\n\nEspecially because we all ordered the same thing (bang bang chicken and shrimp) trying to keep it simple. But of course when I go ALL THE WAY HOME I open the bags and it was everything BUT what we ordered.\n\nSo I call and explain what happened and do you know what they tell me ?? \n\n\"YOU should have OPEND SINGLE EVERYONE and made sure it was correct.... \" although on the recite I was changed for the same thing every order and it matched the one on the bag that's the employee gave me.\n\nFun fact: I DONT WORK AT CHEESECAKE FACTORY AND ITS NOT MY JOB  TO CHECK THE BAG !\n\nI let them know that the part of Oakland I live in is almost all the was to Berkeley so this drive is almost 50 mins with no traffic! I told the manger I would like a refund and  for them to make new food because of all the trouble and the drive he AGREED OVER THE PHONE TO COMP THE FOOD. \n\nmind you at this point it's 8pm when I finely walk back through the doors of cheesecake and her birthday party has no food. ( they really destroyed this day up for my family) THEN HE SAID HE WONT COMP. THE FOOD. even after everything that happened and saying he would over the phone!!!! I had to drive all the way back from Oakland 50 min both ways twice in one day! He said he could only give us free cheesecake....WTF IM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH FREE CHEESECAKE AT A BIRTHDAY PARTY? there's already cake DUH!  I just wanted what he agreed to on the phone. And to be compensated for their mistake.  ( but I took ALL the \"free cake \" and promptly threw it ALL away right there in there trash to prove a point ) \n\n OOOh and here's the kicker the food was not even ready when I got there although I called when I was 20mins away just to make sure they were remaking it and was TOLD YES.

Didn't bother to introduce himself, didn't ask for beverages at all, just asked what we wanted to order, and when I mentioned I needed a bit more time, he just seemed annoyed.\n\nEverything here was just... old. The water cups were disturbing, the plastic has become yellow due to age, and there were visible cracks near the top of the cup where people drink from. Cracks in anything is a source for bacteria to grow and extremely unsanitary.

Unfortunately for us we were sat in a section right next to a door that was wide open and the cold wind was coming in so we were freezing. We asked the manager to close it but he said he couldn't so we asked to be seated in a different section and he said that he would see what he could do but of course didn't do anything, so we were freezing the whole time we trying to enjoy lunch.

Out of all the places to savor my little sister chose the Cheesecake Factory. \n\nI would recommend parking in a garage (prices range from different businesses) and walking to this location or taking the bart. Parking on the streets in the city can be hard to find. Go exploring after to get your money's worth! \n\nThis restaurant is located inside Macy's right where Union Square is. On a Saturday around 1 pm we waited 30 minutes for our outdoor table. Keep in mind you are in San Francisco and in the middle of an endless shopping area. It wasn't a surprise there was a wait. One of the wonderful things that I love about going to the city is listening to the background of tourists who are ecstatic to be here in San Francisco :). It makes waiting more entertaining! \n\nI appreciated the fact that our waiters were still attentive and would ask us if we needed anything else throughout our lunch despite it being busy. Great customer service! Also the dining place itself was very clean and tables were immediately bused when customers left.\n\nAt chains like the Cheesecake Factory, I tend to order what I know is good and stick with it. \n\nWhat I recommend:\n\nAmericana Cheeseburger ($13.95) - This burger consists of American/cheddar cheese, crunchy potato crisps, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, and secret sauce. A moist burger with ingredients that may seem basic, but coexist to leave you deliciously satisfied until the last mouthful. I find that this entree can be lovingly shared between two people. \n\nDulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake- Ever find yourself thinking that your eating cake when your at the Cheesecake Factory? This one is a CLOUD in your mouth compared to some of the flavors that are offered on the menu. The caramel cheesecake isn't taxingly sweet. The caramel mousse and vanilla crust only enhances this simple recipe without overwhelming you and your stomach!\n\nOverall this place makes me a pleased customer!\nI would come back here for a future lunch or dinner.", "author": "Suzette C."}

I wasn't quite sure if they have a Brunch menu, but it turns out that they do. I decided upon ordering the French Toast, and my mom chose to have an Egg White Omlette. Jackie was our server in the beginning, she did a fantastic job, and sadly she had to take a brake, and pass us of to Joanne, she was great to.\n\nWhen my French Toast arrived, it was a wonderful presentation. It looks like they use French Bread here. It was served sprinkled with powered sugar, and small amount of diced strawberries on top. Yes, I took a picture, and will include that.

Our pager buzzed fairly quickly but when we handed it over we were told to wait for our name on the side. One party was called. Then the next. Then the next. And so on until I finally got the attention of someone to take us to our table. Finally we're sat and we wait again. No one checks in for about 15 mins and we finally get our orders taken. The drinks come out in a decent amount of time and then the waiting ensues yet again. We literally waited about 35 minutes for our food and in that time they never checked in on us. No apology for the wait and my order was wrong but I wasn't about to send it back to wait 35 more minutes. And it wasn't like I could tell them because they didn't check in again until we needed boxes to go. We handed over a card to pay without seeing the check because we didn't want to risk waiting any longer and that receipt sure made it back to us quickly. Probably the quickest service we had all night in this place. We were celebrating a birthday and trying to make it special but the service was severely lacking. I noticed that our waiter did walk by a few times while we had our food and didn't even look our way. Were we that much of burden? I really try to give people the benefit of the doubt, especially in the service industry but the inattentiveness was too much. A simple check in to let us know food was on the way or ask how things were going or just an apology for all the waiting would have made all the difference! But we couldn't even get that.

Since we had so much time to review the menu we were ready to order apps, entrees, and drinks. My bf NEVER drinks but wanted to celebrate my birthday so I was very excited to put in alcoholic drink orders. As we're on the balcony there are two other birthdays nearby and these people are sung to and offered cheesecake with a candle. App comes... entree comes... No drinks! At this point it was too late. When the server finally returns well after we're done eating everything, my bf mentions the drinks and cancels them. The server is apologetic and puts her hand on my shoulder, regretfully stating \"omg... I'm ruining your birthday!\" I told her it was okay and my boyfriend playfully hints that a complimentary cheesecake would make up for it (which I should get anyway since its my bday)... after another 10 or 15 minutes goes by, I pass our server while going to the restroom and I hear her putting an order into the dessert desk up front. Upon my return, she walks up a few minutes later with a singular crescent-shaped melted scoop of vanilla ice cream with a sad dollop of whipped cream and lazy sprinkles thrown on with an unlit bday candle ontop. As she sets it down she says, \"we're adults... we dont get cake!\" I had to completely turn away from her and my boyfriend because I started tearing up.

We waited for about 45 minutes and then finally got the buzzer, which rang about 15 minutes later.

The salad was huge. It was really good but not enough chicken. It had some nice crispy tortilla strips. My little sister had salmon with a side of carrots and substituted plain noodles for the potatoes. They gave her cheese on top if she wanted it and she said when to stop. The plate of noodles was huge and the salmon was small so it seemed like the salmon was the side and the noodles was the main. She wants to change the salmon to big and the noodles to small. My dad got the Skinnylicious Vegetable Salad with grilled chicken. The vegetables were very fresh. It was also very healthy. My dad says his salad tastes like healthy sadness and the chicken was tough and overcooked. My grandmother had the cob salad. She says it was pretty to look at. All the food was in separate piles so it made a pretty picture. It was very healthy because it had no carbohydrates. The lettuce was not as fresh as it could have been.

The waitress who took our order and told me that she may not be our server 45 mins from then. We thought our order was in. The girl forgot to bring us our drinks. Then a guy told us that what my mom ordered they didn't have. The girl who took our order then told us that she was waiting to put our order in all together and took my moms new order and left. A few minutes later, my moms food comes out. And our drinks are finally showing up. We are now being told our food is on its way. It's now been an hour and our food is still not there. She told me at 3:00 that she wouldn't be our server at 3:45. Now 4:00, and our food is not here. The new waiter, who was fabulous tells us that the order wasn't fully placed and that if we want we can talk to the manager. Which we didn't request but talked to the manager anyway. The drinks got mixed up because the waitress didn't order them right. The new waiter came back and the manager decided to come us a cheesecake! Which is ridiculous!

When we finally got our food it was mixed up and not right. But at that point we didn't care anymore. It's very obvious that the management of this facility does not take customer service very seriously. Comp'd us just a slice of cheesecake. We were a party of 6! We had really enjoyed our waiter when the switch happened, he was super friendly and was obviously trying to make us for his co-workers mistake. Most likely my family and I will not be visiting this place again. There are plenty of amazing eats around the city.", "author": "A.M S."}

He told his partner that we need our drinks and bread.Then the waiting game start again. Waited for another 40 minutes for a basket of bread. By that time, I actually stand up and walked in, to complaint, (the table next to us which came after us, already finished with their bread. )  AND I have a very hungry young kid.  Amazingly, as I walked in, the waiter walked right in front of me with a basket full of bread. the smell of the warm bread calmed me down. Anyway, less than 5 minutes that we got the bread, our food started to came too 8:22. Had to flag to get drinks refill.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-29", "description": "I have been coming here on and off for years, and have finally been \"coerced\" into writing a review. Like many Cheesecake locations, this place has its quirks. However, the food is good to very good the vast majority of the time, and the service here - unlike some other locations - is often spot on and more. In fact, it is unusual when I come here and find myself grousing about something. Having said that, let the review begin. This location is in the Macy's store at Union Square, up at the top - there is an elevator you can take (inside main entrance to your right), or you can slow journey up the many flights of escalators, taking in the various store floors as you go. As a note, if you arrive at a busy time, just hang out one floor down at the foot of the last escalators - lots of sofas on display, and if you're civil in behavior Macy's doesn't seem to mind if you park it for a little while; not sure the beeper reaches there, so leave someone upstairs if needed. This location has what I would call four dining zones - a bar, an area to the left of the bar (as you face it) and a larger room to the right, past the cheesecake display which tempts you upon entry. There is also an outdoor deck, but with limited shade, and with propane heaters for those summer days in SF! So, there is a bit of a choice of seating - tables or booths, as well. The menu is extensive (more than 250 items offered daily!) and does change in small ways now and then. Can't recommend anything, as I have too many favorites and you'd need several visits to try them for yourself. However, this last visit we had the Korean Fried Cauliflower (crispy cauliflower tossed with sweet and spicy sauce, toasted sesame seeds and green onion). First time for this, and of course, one of those rare issues - about 20 minutes after ordering a manager appeared (never a good sign) and said they were still making the sauce, so the dish would be a little delayed. Not a problem, except that the cauliflower arrived cold. Pretty sure it should have been warm-er. Still the taste was amazing, and although served with a ranch side (?!) the taste of the sauce was more than enough. Will have again! The other appetizer was the lightly breaded fried zucchini sticks, which I always enjoy - WITH the ranch side! We had salads for main entrees, a  Chinese Chicken Salad (chicken breast, rice noodles, lettuce, green onions, almonds, crisp wontons, bean sprouts, orange and sesame seeds, tossed in Chinese plum dressing. This was presented well, but the dressing (especially compared to other places we had this type of salad) was bland - no flavor whatever. Very disappointing. The other salad was the Cobb (with chicken and bacon on the side) and a sub of ranch dressing (which is a little tangy - try it!). Very good salad! And of course, we had to have cheesecake for dessert, and the Key Lime was perfect - tangy, tasty and not overwhelming in size. Don't forget the bread! What I call brown bread, and a sourdough type are offered - I only enjoy the brown bread, warm and soft!  I noticed the butter this visit was not offered in the usual foil wrapped pads, but a square in a small dish - forget to reorder? Not sure if this will become the regular way of serving butter, but if so -- note to manager -- PLEASE, let it get to room temperature before serving. Way too hard to spread, even on warm bread. Anyway, a couple of hiccups, unusual here at this location, but overall worthy of 4-stars. Service was attentive, polite, at times humorous and social, and professional. Will review again - someday! - so in the meanwhile, check it out for yourself.", "author": "Mark K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-05", "description": "The Cheesecake Factory at this location is known for its long wait times, balcony view of Union Square, and of course their cheesecake. If you just want to try the cheesecake, skip the wait and just order it to go at the display case. They come in single servings too. \nIf you do decide to take the elevator to the top floor of Macy's and the escalator to the restaurant for a meal, don't be too deterred by the wait. You can hang out on the beds and couches in Macy's furniture section until your beeper goes off. \nThe restaurant itself is quite nice with murals and columns. There are lots of booths and a bar inside. The balcony overlooking Geary St. is also a nice way to enjoy a meal. \n\nHow about the food? The cheesecake is not bad and the list is extensive, but I'm not a cheesecake lover. The rest of the menu is very overwhelming, as are most chain restaurant menus that aim to have an all-encompassing and somewhat confusing selection. \n\nThe last time I dined here, the wait wasn't long at all. It was a very warm day, so the mai tai & the mojito tasted refreshing. The bread was fresh and fluffy. \n\nSeared Tuna Tataki Salad - lightly seared ahi, with avocado, tomato and mixed greens, w/ wasabi vinaigrette:\nThe bright red tuna was seasoned well with sesame seeds seared onto the surface. \n\nGrilled Rib-Eye Steak:\nIt's probably not rib-eye, but it did have beautiful grill marks. It cut well, and was actually pretty juicy.\n\nBanana Cream Cheesecake - topped w/ Bavarian cream & bananas:\nI'm not a cheesecake lover as I usually find it too dense for me, but I do like banana cream desserts. The banana slices and the banana cream were smooth enough to balance out the dense-ness of the cheesecake. \n\nCompared to most chain restaurants or department store restaurants, I think Cheesecake Factory is A-ok. I think the ambience bumps this location up a notch. I admit I never crave a meal from the Cheesecake Factory and none of the dishes really stand out to me, but I do think it is a decent option in this area when the wait isn't too long. Considering the ridiculous wait times, I can't understand why they don't take reservations.", "author": "Joy W."}

We went to celebrate an family member birthday that was turning 80 yrs old. We got there at 1pm and didn't get seated til after 3:30 pm party of 14. After we complained about our wait to an manager named John he was able to seat us 10-15 minutes after however they still separated our party on different sides of a glass separator. Our server Sergio was just coming on his shift he explained. So we placed our drink order as well as our food order at one time. Sergio came back with our drinks but put them all infront of myself, where I then exclaimed that it was my day off on serving my family and that he should place the drinks himself in front of whom ordered them. He replied that isn't his problem for me to pass the drinks to the appropriate persons. I did, but that started the roller coaster ride then. Our food came out sporadically as well as our family meals. Some asked for well done burgers, but when arrived they were raw meat we asked if it could be adjusted to our desire Sergio told us it would be another 30-40 minutes before we received our food. Mean while we have nets and flys hovering around our drinks my merlot had two nets in it unbeknownst to me I'm drinking it ( I'm gagging now)! We ask for a manager because 3-4 people out of our party still weren't able to eat. The manager David came to our table rude and impatient. He had no time to rectify the situation at hand and kept referring to us as these people. I felt racially discriminated against. He also knocked my phone off the counter onto my toe it hurt really bad I began to cry because I was asking for another manager John and he refused to get him. Telling me he's the supervisor and John couldn't do anything with us or these people. Another manager came over because David was livid dealing with these people. Michael Kiernan he tried to rectify the situation but came with the same antics as David he did give me a cup of water after I was in tears however was not any help at all. A white older couple sitting across from us called me to their table too apologize for the treatment my family and I had to endure. She stated that we handled this situation the best we could and they were sorry for what they were witnessing. To make matters worst they charged my card and made us stand there like it didn't go through so we had to pay cash just to find out that the cheese cake factory charged me two times.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-03", "description": "Macys and Cheesecake Factory go hand in hand, with the American chain culture. It's no wonder that they have a CF at the top of Macy's in San Francisco's busiest high end shopping area of the city. It's been a long time since I've been here, high school with my mom for lunch. Even then, we didn't have a long wait because the lunch hour rush isn't as crazy as the holiday, weekend crowd. My family isn't too big on CF, but they wanted to come here for the view. \n\nMy twin's birthdays were last Friday, which is the 30th of December. Union Square, Macy's included were still set up for the holidays. We went to Japantown and then we headed to Union Square. I did a Google search for cheap parking around the area and since it was after 6PM, the parking was averaged to $6 total. Whaaaat, that is crazy! I was expecting that we'd be paying a minimum of $20 for the parking alone. Waze took us down a shorter way to the parking lot (because the streets were a parking lot as well) and we arrived about 15 minutes from leaving Japantown. \n\nIt was 7:05 to be exact when we went to go put down our names for the wait list. He said that it would be about 3 1/2 hours. We bit the bullet and waited. It was prime time traffic on a Friday out of the city, no way would it do us any good sitting in the car. The time on the ticket that was given to us actually said to be back around 9:56PM, so three hours, take off a half an hour. \n\nBy 9:45, we were all over hanging out around Union Square. We had visited the Starbucks on the fourth floor, walked around Union Square and watched some people fall down ice skating. We went to the Disney Store and Old Navy down on Market and still had about an hour to kill before we could even head up. By the time that we went up, it was 10PM. There was a line of people waiting to make a reservation, I suppose. There were other people waiting in a line off to the side, handing their white ticket to the lady behind the counter. Some were seated right away, others were handed a buzzer. I was handed a buzzer. We scored seats in the little room that is between the indoor and outdoor seating. People were out looking at the view, I decided to wait for that until after we were done eating. We waited about 10 minutes before the buzzer started going off.\n\nThe server that we had was really nice. I don't remember his name, but it took him a few minutes to come around and take drink orders...but once he came by, he was very attentive during our dining. We ordered appetizers, cheese sticks and mini crab bites. They didn't have anymore cheese sticks though and my twins didn't want anything else...so we just went with the mini crab bites. \n\nThe time for the food to come out was pretty average, it wasn't that long. One of my twin's daughter's meals came out incorrectly. The waiter offered her a soup or salad on the house, but she didn't want anything. The order came out correctly and we all enjoyed our meals. We ordered a piece of cheesecake and a few of the waiters came over and sung Happy Birthday to our twins. One of them sung really off key and I thought it was hilarious. I'm not sure if he always does that or if he did it because I said \"they're now teenagers\"...but we all thought it was funny.\n\nOverall, would we come here for a random night? No, we wouldn't wait three hours to eat food at a restaurant that we could dine at closer to our house. I would say that the dining experience outside during the summer, is probably amazing. Even with the heaters outside, that is too cold for my liking! But the view is amazing and if you like dessert, this is a great place to come.

The manager comes out and tells us that there is nothing he can do about a discount and that all that can be done is to order another item on the menu and that he would try to expedite the new order.\n\nI have been waiting with my group of 8 now for over three hours in total as of writing this review and I am actually writing this review while I wait for my food to arrive, it has been more than 40 minutes and we still haven't received any entrees.\n\nOverall, I am disappointed that this establishment could not so much as offer a discount for such an inconvenience and I will certainly be thinking twice before returning.", "author": "Stevin H."}

So my review for this is strictly based on this location.\n\nPros:\n- Available seating indoors or outdoors (outdoor seating is the best on a sunny day since you'll have a great view of Union Square. It's also gorgeous during the winter, but make sure to wear a warm jacket or sweater since it tends to be pretty cold in SF)\n- Located on the top floor of Macy's, so you know where to go if you want to walk off that cheesecake after. You're also near a lot of shops along Union Square, which is also pretty neat-o. \n- Their cheesecakes, while the same in most locations, are always definitely a pro here. You can have them to-go or dine in and eat em there. \n\nCons:\n- Service is definitely a hit or miss, but it all depends on how busy it gets.\n- Since a lot of tourists and visitors like to come here after a day of exploring Union Square, be prepared to wait for a while. \n- The food is standard, but definitely overpriced.\n- Parking around Union Square is difficult not only because of the price, but because of how packed it gets, as well as the traffic that comes along with being a touristy area. Be prepared to either wait in traffic, or to ask yourself whether or not you'd want to take public transportation. \n- THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS. Just wanted to let you all know. \n\nYou definitely have to try a Cheesecake Factory, at least once in your life. If not here, then elsewhere also.", "author": "Jerianne G."}

It's like they all come swarming to take everyone to their tables, promptly to then ignore them all. Our service was abysmal at best. My mom ordered the appetizer taquitos so that she could save room for Cheesecake, and then our server never came back. Ever again. He really didn't.  He walked by our table 3 times, each time I asked for water, and he never brought water or asked how our food was. We were going to a show and finally decided to just ask for the check, no dessert.

Two short minutes later, she returned with two cups of water and admitted that she forgot what drinks were ordered. I repeated the drink order and she franticly rushed away. I saw a manager walking by and stopped her to request that we be assigned a new waitress only because I wasn't in the mood for a bad service that evening. The manager acted shocked and stated that the waitress serving us was her best.

It is for only that reason alone I gave this location 2 stars.

This restaurant was located in Union Square so its a great location. When I got there, I saw that there was deck overlooking the square from the 8th floor. I didn't even put my name down to get a table yet as I was mesmerized by the view (about 9pm). So refreshing.\n\nIt was just me so instead of waiting (yeah, people were still waiting at that time) I went to the bar to claim a spot when any is available. A small family was leaving so I luckily snagged that table. The server was just absolutely being worked hard and I felt sorry for the guy. He seemed on edge and jumpy because his area was so busy. I told him its just me and I know what I want to order to make it easy on him. He said the fact that it was just me was just a relief to him because groups can be a little daunting in that kind of setting. Anyway, food was great as always and his service was really good and I was happy. I took a cheesecake home and gave him a very large tip. He deserved it. It made my long day end well with a familiar but great meal. \n\nSome yelpers are actually lowering their star ratings because the restaurant is so crowded. There is a reason for that: its the Cheesecake Factory. Would you be happy if the restaurant was not empty? What if they raised their prices 50% and then the wait times are not so long?

Unfortunately, all the top places we Yelped had a long line up, so we opted for The Cheesecake Factory. I was pretty excited considering the fact that there's none in Canada. The restaurant is at the top floor of the shopping centre and you have to take an elevator to go up. Luckily, they had plenty of seats and the view was incredible! We would've sat at the outside patio but it was raining before so all the tables and seats were wet. \n\nI ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict, because I actually had this at a restaurant in New York (called Friedman's, check out my other review) so I wanted to see how it compared to the Cheesecake Factory. I was really surprised when it came out because it wasn't what I expected. Rather than pieces of fried chicken, it was chicken strips which really lowered my expectations. The side of potatoes were a really nice touch, and they weren't salty which I liked. The creaminess of the poached egg and hollandaise sauce was a really nice balance to the saltiness of the chicken strips.\n\nMy friend ordered the Bruleed French Toast, and HOLY this thing was huge. It's not like your regular french toast, it was more like french baguette...Unlike a baguette though, these wee INCREDIBLY soft and fluffy. I highly recommend this!\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the Tiramisu Cheesecake and this was delicious.

It's in the heart of city, located inside Macy's on the top floor. As cheesy as that sounds, the menu is filled with your all-American generic food options with some variation. You can never go wrong with pasta, burgers, etc. \n\nThis place is pretty well known for their \"brown\" bread which is actually rye bread. Load up on some carbs prior to your entree, and you will have no room for cheesecake. Eat with caution. \n\nSince their menu is ridiculously long and extensive, here are some common entree's I like to order in rotation:\n- Miso Salmon: a fat, juicy, teriyaki based filet of salmon resting on a bed of brown rice, surrounded by snow peas and miso sauce. \n- Louisiana Chicken Pasta: a huge portion of bow tie pasta with a cajun kick of flavor, with crispy chicken tenders on top\n- Avocado Egg rolls: this appetizer can fill me up. Each egg roll is filled with a bite of soft avocado and can be dipped in a tangy tamarind sauce. \n\nMind you, all these portions are HUGE. They really emphasize on family style portions. \n\nIn terms of dessert, how can you visit the Cheesecake Factory without having cheesecake? It would be a sin not to share a slice. My personal favorites are:\n- The 30th Anniversary: CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH FUDGE AND CHEESECAKE. C'mon.. It's the best of both worlds.\n- White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle: It has a little fruit in it so it HAS to be a little healthy.. Ammiright?! \nI refuse to try any other cheesecake. I'm loyal to my soil.\n\nWait time can be long, just because it's located in the middle of Union Square. Enjoy the seating outside, and bask in the SF weather.

Now that I live in the Bay Area, I have plenty of options and am trying local places more often. When I went into The City two days ago, however, I did meet up with a friend for lunch at The Cheesecake Factory. \n\nThis location is really cool, in my opinion, and the two times I've eaten here, I ate outside overlooking Union Square -- great views from up there on either side of the Macy's sign (no, literally!). \n\nI ordered the Georgia Peach cocktail, as recommended by the server when I asked, and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (also recommended when asked). Both were absolutely delicious. ZERO regrets. I am a big guy, I hadn't eaten breakfast, and wasn't eating lunch here until after 1 PM. I ordered the lunch sized pasta and STILL had leftovers to take home. That brown bread (What IS that bread? There's a debate online, and there's too many different answers!) may be the best thing here, honestly. That's not meant as an insult, but I've never tasted a better bread in my life. \n\nMy complaints here are as follows: the staff at the check in counter. They are a little \"gossipy\" and are clearly discussing others in whispered voices, looking around, and then giggling about it. That doesn't make one comfortable and is quite unprofessional. The other complaint/issue (and it's not even the fault of The Cheesecake Factory) is that if you sit outside, there will be birds flying VERY close to you/around you often.

My friend and I wanted pasta so we opted to come here on a Saturday night. It's around 6:30, union square so it's fair we wait an hour bc of how busy it can get. I know it's really hectic to get everyone's plates out in time due to how overwhelmed it was. We were told a 40 minute wait but got seated 1-1 hour and ten minutes later. We quickly ordered bc we were so hangry. We got fried zucchini for starters while my friend chose the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and I got the same thing I got last year, the Cajun jambalaya pasta. Their complementary bread came fast and as soon as we were done with that, our appetizer came. The fried zucchini was amazing. Now I know it might not sound so good, but it was so amazing where I'd say it can curve your tastebuds for chicken nuggets/tenders. After we finished that, our food took super long to come out. Waited at least 30 minutes to come to us only to find out our food has been sitting there. When I tried to dig in to my pasta, I couldn't. The pasta was so dry and hard and the food was lukewarm. Now I'm not the one to complain but if it's something like this, I can't eat it. I let my server Patricia know and she was super calm about it.

We arrived and waited 15 minutes for a table, no big deal. When we were seated, the waiter came by to take our drink order. I got a cup of hot coffee and my two friends got cups of hot chocolate. He promised water and bread, then left. AND WAS GONE FOR ANOTHER 15 MINUTES. When he finally came back, he had the two \"hot chocolates\" (lukewarm chocolate milk with hard whipped cream all over the glasses), my coffee, and the bread. He said he'd be right back with the sugar, then left for another ten minutes. Then he came back, without the sugar, and took out dessert order. And he was gone again. We ended up being at our table for around an hour and twenty minutes just waiting for two strawberry shortcake desserts, a brownie sundae, and the sugar for my now cold coffee (ANOTHER WAITER LITERALLY JUST PICKED IT UP FROM A TABLE TEN FEET AWAY AND HANDED IT TO ME), and that was only after the INCREDIBLY RUDE floor manager came by and condescendingly explained that this was actually no one's fault and, basically, we could leave if we wanted to. We barely touched the desserts - after waiting an hour we weren't really in the mood, and they came disheveled and already melting. After waiting *another 20 minutes* in a completely unmanned section for someone to take our money, we just left.

It's located at the top of the Macy's building in Union Square. They have an elevator to the right at the entrance that takes you straight up to the restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty big but they always seem to be busy. Given it was a nice sunny day, we opted to sit in the outdoor patio area. A must if the weather is good! The patio overlooks Union Square. Though it wasn't overly crowded, we still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and it took another 15 minutes to order our food. Overall the food quality is worth 3 stars. It's just average American food- not terrible but nothing special. It's nice that they have a large selection of entrees so everyone has something to eat (even a skinny menu for those who are on a diet or want to eat healthier). The beautiful view bumped up the rating to 4 stars. \n\nLove the complimentary bread basket with butter and if you have room left at the end, you should try their assortment of cheesecakes. \n\nDefinitely a tourist attraction and come semi-hungry because you'll be waiting for a while.", "author": "Essie K."}

I usually try not to dock the waiter for a kitchen screw up, but felt we had no choice this time. I think the manager owes his waiter the remainder of the tip for not attending to a customer who was inconvenienced.\n\nThe cherry on top of all this was when I went to use the ladies restroom.

I have been to this San Francisco location many times in the past 4-5 years. I come into the city at least once a month and I've always loved going to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. But it appears that for the past six months the food and service is on the decline. In these six months every time I've gone in the wait for my food has been close to 30 minutes and the only reason I get it is because I start inquiring about it. After my last experience with delayed food and rude hostess at the front desk I never wanted to come back but I decided today to give them another chance. BIG MISTAKE, I ordered to go a salad, corn cakes, chicken wings, and a quesadilla . The food came out on a timely basis and stupidly I didn't check my order before I left. I should've known as my server never wrote my order down and when he repeated it to me he had forgotten one item. Once at home I realized that they did NOT give me my salad at all (but funny thing they gave me the cheese for the salad) and my corn cakes were missing everything but the corn cakes. Not sure why my server did not check my order since the restaurant was not really busy today. Unfortunately I will have to find a different restaurant because today was my last time here. My opinion is that the kitchen at this location is no longer producing quality dishes, the food is mediocre at best when delayed and awful when served on time.", "author": "El L."}

We decided on a whim to go to a familiar spot before sightseeing. The food and service were fine - reflective of the Cheesecake brand. \n\nThis is where the experience gets marred. We paid our bill and I went to the restroom a few feet away. When I walked out, I realized I did not have my phone. A quick circle back to the table we just vacated produced no phone. Wow, how bizarre?! So we tried calling it - nothing. The phone that was fully charged and in use a few mins prior, was now off. We looked again before the next party was seated in that booth, and even after they sat, they helped us look. Nada. \n\nThe manager on duty, David Mendes, seemed more concerned about offering a superficial \"We couldn't find it, we'll let you know if we do\" - than actually caring that someone had stolen my $800 phone right in the building. We hadn't left yet - we were still patrons!! He seemed in a hurry to get rid of us so we do not disturb the others. The busser tried his best to offer suggestions but nobody else cared. My husband went back to the restaurant later to ask if they could check their surveillance cameras, and the manager replied that he would need to turn things over to the security team and that will take some time. \n\nWe are home, it's now days later, and STILL no courtesy calls or follow up from the manager.

He also did this with another table. The intention was clear. How many times can you make an excuse for this as a coincidence instead of the primal nature/instincts of an old man in need of, mind my language, viagra? He offended me many times throughout my meal that even eating became an exhausting activity. My server wasn't helping either, by using me, talking to me acting all nice when his focus was not genuinely in serving me but his focus was in hoping that he could attract one of the females sitting at the table in front of me. I understand the financial district is tough and there are ladders that need to be climbed, but not at my expense! When I told the Manager what happened, the first thing that he did, instead of doing the right thing, he chose to take on the easy job, which was lecturing me what is or not in my authority. I am a respectful person. I respect people who are right and noble. I do not, however, respect married or unmarried old men who cross boundaries. This is not ideal and most humans would agree with the discomfort feeling that is exhibited by crooked intentions who may or may not use assumptions as a facade.", "author": "Customer L."}

For drinks, we just got water and two of the cups were yellow and dirty. \n\nTo top our terrible visit off, once we paid and were getting ready to leave our server loudly said \"wow I f***ing hate teenagers\".

Went in for lunch on a weekday, we were happy to be seated within 10 mins of arriving but were surprised by the amount of time it took to wait to order, wait for water, wait for anyone to check in with us especially on a visibly slow day. After 45 mins food arrived and we realized the food wasn't what our table had ordered. The server realized it too and came to take it back, a manager came out and let us know it would be another 10 mins for the sandwich. After 20 more mins I just asked to take the sandwich To-Go as at this point as we were reaching over an hour of just sitting there and we still had a long drive home. The server was not happy about our request but obliged. After bringing us the bill (including the food we didn't get to eat), we couldn't wait to get out of there as this entire experience had made us feel like more of a burden than anything else. Once we got home and actually opened this box, I found a Chicken sandwich that consisted of bread, some sad lettuce and an huge slices of tomatoes. No Chicken Salad whatsoever.

I mentioned that one of them was coming in right now... but there was no budging -- \n\n3 PEOPLE ARE NEEDED FOR A BOOTH. \n\nI asked him if I could then get a table for 1 in the mean time and he said NO - \"you can only seat at the bar.\" I asked if I could then make reservations and wait and again he said NO, no reservations are taken.  \n\nThe lady manager just stood there hearing our conversation without saying a word. \n\nI decided to seat down on the side and wait, but then I decided to walk to the seating area and it was completely empty, except for a table of a few business people, and another booth taken by 2 employees of the restaurant who were hanging out with a waitress working there ---  \n\nwait a minute, I thought it was 3 People for a booth??\n\nI'll now give you my honest opinion... this is so silly because the whole place was empty... more than 7 booths empty - and the patio was close because it was empty. Nobody was coming in today because   \n\n1. it was so early \n2. it was raining. \n\nI finally was able to get my guests to arrived and we were seated.  I requested a booth by the window but even the waitress me standing half way... she had to go back to the host and ask if a seat by the booth was okay. A few minutes later she returns and I finally get seated. \n\nThe meal was good, the other waitress that arrived was polite, and when I asked her if it would get busy... she said the whole place had been empty the whole week because of the rain, and because it's after Christmas season.  \n\nAND GUESS WHAT?\n\nThe whole place remained empty for the remaining 45 minutes that I was there. \n\nI don't blame the young guy for following protocol but I think this is pretty absurd. I\"m a patron, a paying customer who supports their establishments, but their snobbish behavior, and \"rules\" that at times do not apply - or they apply to preferential treatment... that's NOT OKAY.\n\nbtw...  the previous review of the Indian guy visiting this place with his elderly parents really ticked me off. People shouldn't be treated this way.  \n\n\nDON'T REWARD BAD SERVICE. \n\n\nps.  oh yeah, I asked if they had wifi and the waitress said \"no.\" Go figure.", "author": "Christiani C."}

I know, I know, it's the Cheesecake Factory, nothing really to get all excited about. But my experience this time was actually very decent.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is pretty neat. You have a nice marble floor, the craziest view of Union Square above Macy's, and if you don't want to eat outside (which we elected not to in order to avoid pesky pigeon poop) you can be seated at these cute little wooden booths. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and caring. A kid at our party is allergic to eggs, thus we asked the waiter to separate the buns and the patties of the sliders that we ordered. He readily complied. What a chum.\n\nWe ordered a Lunch Special Famous Factory Meat Loaf, Lunch Special Shepard's pie, Fried Calamari, Sweet Potato Fries, sliders, fried chicken. I personally had the lunch meat loaf as I had the Shepard's pie before. The waiter asked if we wanted bread, and I highly suggest that you don't miss out on it. They give you three bread sticks--two rye and one French bread with lots of butter packs. I'm a sucker for bread, and this bread wasn't bad.\n\nCALAMARI (~$16.50): Decent, they give you a decent amount for ~$16.50 along with two dips--cocktail sauce and garlic sauce. Good effort.\n\nSWEET POTATO FRIES (~$12.50): I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries, but these were solid.\n\nLUNCH SPECIAL FAMOUS FACTORY MEAT LOAF (~$13.50): My main dish. They give you two SIZABLE slices topped with onions and sided with succotash and mashed potatoes with gravy on the side. The meatloaf was decent, but had a tad too much rosemary flavor it to. After consuming the calamari, sweet potato fries, and the bread, this was too much for me to finish and I took half of it home. \n\nLUNCH SPECIAL SHEPARD'S PIE (~$13.50): My favorite of all the dishes I sampled--the ground beef topped with mash potatoes was a wonder to behold. I could eat something like that all day. Sure, it's a simple meal, but the amount was HUGE and it was very tasty. \n\nFRIED CHICKEN (~$13.50): The fried chicken was OK, it wasn't all flour like the frozen Tyson chicken you get at the frozen section of the local supermarket, and the meat was surprisingly moist. :)\n\nTASTE: 4 stars--portions are good, food is surprisingly decent.\nSERVICE: 3 stars--they didn't refill our water. That's a boo boo. But the waiter took care of my demands.\nAMBIANCE: 5 stars--nice view and beautiful interior.\nPRICE: 4 stars--it's a solid price for a lot of food.\nTOTAL: 4 stars--I'd come here again.\n\nBottom Line: THE FOOD IS SOLID.

They had like a hundred different flavors of cheesecake, and actually really decent and yummy food. In recent years though, the crowds have become way ridiculous and it looks like they're starting to cut corners on all the recipes I used to love. They just ain't that great anymore.\n\nWAIT TIMES: We dropped by the Cheesecake Factory on Black Friday (on hindsight, not the best idea) and were seated after a 45 minute wait. They have a nifty little system where they text you a few minutes before your turn so you can do some shopping while you wait, which is nice. The servers though, are totally snobby and rude, but I guess they can afford to be since there are 1283719 more customers willing to take your place if you dare to complain.\n\nFOOD: Sigh. This is where it all went down hill. \n\nNormally, I would be happy to wait for a plate of Cheesecake Factory's signature delicious garlic noodles. That garlicky flavorful butter sauce, piled high on al dente spaghetti? Delicious. Droolworthy. Amazing. Dare I say it? One of the best plates of American spaghetti I have ever had. This time though, the garlic spaghetti sauce was terribly diluted, it looked like sad egg noodles in watery soup, and tasted just about as bad.

Then the manager comes along stating that the pasta was taken to a different table...you'd think that since all the meals were cold and that we still needed to wait for them to remake the pasta that at a minimum the pasta would have been taken off the table, but nope! Then, we go and order a whole Cheesecake and we get home to find out it's FROZEN. So now only was the dinner shit, we couldn't even enjoy the dessert.

I've been to other Cheesecake Factory's but none on the 8th floor over looking part of a city as beautiful as San Francisco. The elegance at this particular location does set it apart from others and to me it was the balcony dining that created that separation. \n     I ordered what they call the Factory Combo which you had a choice of two items. The choices were Steak Diane, Chicken Madiera, Shrimp Scampi and Herb Crusted Salmon. I picked the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon and its served with mashed potatoes as the side. I requested my steak medium but received a near well done piece of meat. The flavor was sort of bland to me which showcases poor attention to the steak. The Herb Crusted Salmon was a bit dry but the flavor was bursting and popping quite well. \n     I decided not to order dessert as I'm not a dessert person. But I did have a few Lagunita IPAs which I enjoyed from the draft. I'm used to the bottles and you can taste the difference. \n     The service was actually excellent by the waiter. He was very attentive but not annoying and seemed to pick the times to question refills. \n     The reason for the 3 stars is a direct reflection of their food which is why I came here.

Otherwise, it's a madhouse, and you will wait an absurdly long time for a table, for your food, and finally for your check. And when you get your food, it very likely will not be prepared right. \n\nI do feel bad for the front desk staff, as I know they're trying hard to keep the flow of guests and tables moving along smoothly. But some members of the waitstaff here are not at all pleasant, and it is very clear that they'd rather be doing something else. I spent half of my meal here looking for the waiter. I had to get up and chase him down to get the check, as I'd spent too much time craning my neck and waving my hand to get his attention. \n\nEven if you've enjoyed eating at other Cheesecake Factory locations in the past, be wary about eating at this Union Square location. The huge number of guests on certain nights and the fact that many of these out-of-towners won't be back in town again for the foreseeable future, if ever, might make the staff here less likely to provide good service.

The place has amazing views from the patio over looking Union Square park, there is more on the menu then you will find in an entire food court at most malls. And the staff is always dressed head to toe in white to show how they have somehow managed not to spill anything on themselves throughout their shift. \n\nCame here with a couple of co-workers for lunch and I was stunned to hear that it was their first time inside of the place. There was a long line to get up to the counter to receive a buzzer for a table so we worked our way over to the bar and took a seat. The bartender who greeted us was more than accommodating and asked if he could start us with something to drink. I knew what I was after since I was going to pair my beverage with my dish, and I was thinking Cuban sandwich the entire way there so you know I had to go with a Mojito. \n\nNow the hard decision to make www which mojito to get, I usually go with the Pineapple since it screams the essence of equator living. I ordered one for myself and told my lunch mates that they should follow suit. The bartender offered his suggestion of Blueberry Mojitos for them since they had never tried them and it was now time to sit back and watch him do his thing. After a few shakes and a perfect pour we were ready to enjoy the deliciousness that is a Mojito. \n\nWe were passed our menu's and it was a kick to watch the faces of my co-workers as they flipped through the book (yes, it is thicker than some Daniele Steele novels) to see what they could possibly get themselves into. Page after page is packed full of every thinkable type of food from Asian to French back to Classic fav's such as mini Corndogs... \n\nWe placed our orders for a couple of Cuban sandwiches as well as a couple of appetizers and watched a lil sports on the tv mounted above the bar and waited for our grub to arrive.

Each time I've been here, there's always been at least a 15 minute solid wait. Even then, the hosts have always been helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable. They don't cave under the dozens of families crowding around their desk, waiting for a table.\n\nThis time, my bf and I walked in and were seated immediately. Our server, (Jennifer I think?), greeted us immediately, and brought us water and bread.\n\nYou'll have to take a good 15 minutes to look at the drink menu, BEFORE you even think about food. And after that, good luck sifting through the ridiculous food menu! There's even a menu WITHIN a menu-the skinnylicious menu which basically highlights the same dishes that are already inside the regular menu!\n\nLuckily, our server was so helpful, she immediately pointed out some vegan friendly appetizers and ran to the back to check if a few vegetarian ones were vegan friendly or not! We ordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate (my first time doing that!), and settled on the Thai Lettuce wraps, with avocado instead of chicken. But you could also do portobella mushrooms or eggplant!\n\nThe lettuce wraps were delicious! It definitely kicks PF Chang's lettuce wraps out of the water. sorry Changs, but your dumb-ass \"special\" sauce does nothing on the THREE amazing sauces they provide here. Plus, they use quality butter-leaf lettuce and provide a myriad of veggie choices!\nWe licked the plate clean! It was so good!\n\nFor entrees, I went for Evelyn's favorite pasta dish-or something of similar name. The penne is vegan-friendly and it is tossed with broccoli, eggplant, garlic, tomatoes, pine nuts, and olive oil. It is simple but flavorful! I was actually impressed by the food choices. \nAnd of course, portions were hefty, and the timing was done right!\n\nRemember back in high school when you would grab all your buddies and eat at the cheesecake factory? $30 got you 1 dish, 1 dessert, and a cup of water? Well this isn't high school anymore. Today, we spent the big bucks (we went way over our gift certificate limit), and I couldn't be more satisfied.\n\nI'm sure that your experience here is a definite hit or miss, but you can't discredit them for the times they do it right!\n\nThanks for the great service, food, drinks, and atmosphere! I'll cheers to that!", "author": "Lanie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-12", "description": "Located on the top floor of the Macy's across from Union Square, this Cheesecake Factory is just like all the others with the spectacular food and the bustling, yet ambient atmosphere. However,  what makes this one in particular unique is the incredible view of Union Square and the other FiDi buildings you get from their outdoor patio! \n\nDining from this height will make the experience feel much more grand and special, if you're willing to deal with the wait and the outdoor elements of wind, sun, and random pigeons. Indoor seating is just as exceptional though, and while the wait time will vary in length, the speed and quality of service I've always received here is superb. \n\nI ultimately give this one 3 stars however because of the lack of waiting space and seating in their foyer (their front desk and cheesecake glass case is hard to access with all the people waiting around), and the small elevator used to get all the way up here. The elevator is always crowded and operates slowly every time we come here, forcing us to tediously ride the escalators all the way up. Overall I think my main problem here is accessiblity and openness of the location.\n\nNonetheless, the food is always delicious, and whether or not you're staying to dine here, definitely stop by just to see the view too!", "author": "Kyrie S."}

We had to wait around 20 minutes to get a table. \nThe menu was really appealing and I was torn between a few options. The crispy chicken costolleta was really good and well cooked. It came with 5 green asparagus and a bunch of french fries (I asked for a substitution as it comes with mashed potatoes on the menu and it came with no charge). The chicken was crispy as expected and the lemon sauce was really good. Asparagus were pretty good too and still crunchy as I like them. Fries were okay, a bit cold. The service was nice, our waiter was really nice and helpful.\nMy husband went for the veggie burger and was quite happy with it too. \nWe then ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake to share, we ate it too fast to even snap a picture :-) \nWhile waiting we enjoyed the view on Union Square (and its holiday ice rink opening tomorrow).\nI'll have to come back to try the Evelyn's favorite pasta :p And maybe another kind of cheesecake (I'll have to decide between chocolate hazelnut, mango key lime ou dutch apple caramel...

Guess what, they even add whip cream into the plastic container - as if the cake was not yet creamy enough!\nSecond time we returned we actually ate there as well and it was awesome as well. As we came up the eighth floor of the Macy's store, it was so crowded. So we received a buzzer and had to wait like 30-40 minutes. So we spent the next time at the bar and had some cocktails. Those were so awesome and tasty. All about 11 bucks and got as all drunk as we hadn't eaten yet. So by the time we went to our table, we were all still being tipsy. \nWe ordered a garlic-cheese-bread as a starter and they serve warm bread and butter, too! It was all very yummy and the garlic-bread came with a Parmesan pesto and a tomato salsa! Great. \nAs my main course, I ordered a Ceaser salad with chicken. It was a big-ass salad with nicely grilled chicken breast. As dessert we had again a couple of slices of Cheesecake that we all shared as we were already pretty much stuffed and the cake is very rich. We had a slice of the pumpkin-pecan cheesecake and it was gorgeous, too. Overall, the prices are a bit elevated, but the quality and taste of the food is high!

It was as if we were all playing musical chairs in hopes of finding somewhere to be seated. The service we got from our waitstaff was less than impressive. Sometimes I just wanted to go grab what we needed and we would have been serviced better. For the amount one pays here, how good the food and decor is you would expect the service to match.

Meals are decently priced but their must-try is definitely a cheesecake. They have a lot of choices and you'll be sure to find one you like. \n\nOne weird thing though-- on the menu my mom was strictly looking for any entree with rice. She ended up going with the carne asada steak medallions. One the menu it said it would come with rice and fresh corn. The dish did not come with anything but the carne asada plate. Multiple people told us it didn't come with rice but that was literally all my mom was looking at on the menu when she ordered. Online it even says this: \"Certified Angus Beef Covered with Sauteed Peppers, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Creamy Ranchero Sauce, Fresh Corn and White Rice.\" So we ended up having to order a side that was already supposed to be included in her meal. I should have asked for the menu again so we all could have looked over the menu for the discrepancy. \n\nWait: It wasn't bad for a busy Saturday. We waited about 30 minutes around 5pm. \n\nAmbiance: We sat outside and that was really nice. There was a good view over Union Square and we got lucky since the weather was warm. The sun hid behind the hotels just in time when the food came. \n\nService: It was super slow. I get it though, I always am patient with slow restaurants because I can only imagine how hectic it can be. One red flag though was when I saw my waiter bring over a basket of bread to the table next to us. He had another one with him that he kept circling around with but he didn't drop it off to our table. We were right there. But that was fine. He eventually gave it to us after we got our meal. Like, okay that would've been nice when I was waiting awhile for the food, but again, that was fine. What ticked me off was when he finally delivered our cheesecake. He didn't bring the utensils and when he came back another few minutes without it still, my mom kindly reminded him. He gave her this stern look in the eye and rudely told her he was already going to get it. Like bro, she was very polite about it. She was just reminding you. Don't patronize your paying customers after already being lackluster with your service. I'll just assume he's had a rough day. At least the food was bomb.", "author": "Charis J."}

Since my mother had never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before, I suggested we stop in for lunch since we were in the area.\n\nLOCATION/SETTING:  Top floor of Macy's (women's store).  Accessible via escalator or elevator.  Seating is either indoors or outdoors on their patio overlooking union square park.  \n\nThough we arrived slightly past 1pm, surprisingly we were still quoted a wait of 30 minutes.  A pager was given though we (as well as other parties) waited near the check-in podium.  Some opted to wait on the patio while others left since the wait was too long.  In the end, we waited roughly 35-40 minutes.\n\nFOOD:  The menu is very diverse with many, many selections.  They include appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pastas, etc., and of course, dessert.\n\n1.  Turkey Burger:  My mother's choice.  Served with a small salad.  She found it satisfactory as she finished most of it.\n\n2.  Pasta Da Vinci (lunch portion):  The menu has a lunch section where smaller portions of their sandwiches/pastas/entrees are offered. I've had this pasta before and I thought it was ok. It wasn't as memorable as at other locations where I've ordered this dish.  It was slightly undercooked to say the least.  I ate most of it since I was quite hungry. \n\n3. Seasonal pumpkin cheesecake: Huge slice with a big dollop of whip cream. Not overly sweet. A great way to end the meal.\n\nSERVICE: Not great. The server, though polite and friendly, was slightly forgetful. He neglected to write down my order which prevented my food from being dropped off at the same time as my mother's.  My mom was hungry so I told her to go ahead and start eating.  Drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner and there was a delay (for some reason) in getting the check.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Convenient location. Ok food.

If I was doing some heavy shopping downtown and I was famished, I would probably give it another try only because I haven't had their cheesecake yet.\n\nOne final thing. The decor is very cheesey. No pun intended. It's hard to tell what the theme or motif is but it could use a facelift. The Terrace seating overlooking Union Square is a very nice feature.", "author": "Marlon P."}

I'm a first time San Francisco traveler, and so after a long day of walking and climbing up hills we decided to go to Cheesecake to relax and eat some good food. First off, they sat us at this cruddy table. It was really dirty and super sticky. Also, they served us water in dirty cups. They were yellow and disgusting. Then our waitress was super rude. I went with my two friends, and we are all in university. We asked the waitress, Sierra H., if we could move tables and she gave us attitude saying we can't move because it was too late and put our orders in. We did not give her a hard time and we understood, so we just accepted it and made the best of it. By the end of the night we were leaving and we heard her talking crap about us saying, \"I just hate serving f***ing teenagers,\" directly implying to us. We had never given her any type of attitude, only asked if we could move tables and did not give her a hard time for anything. And I have worked in the food industry before, and never have I said such things in front of the customer, even if they did deserve it. So I would suggest not coming here unless you want terrible service.", "author": "Tatiana A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-05", "description": "One of my go-to restaurants when I'm shopping around Union Square and can't find a nice place to eat. \n\nUnfortunately, a major downfall is the Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations. The several times I've been here, I've always had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table, and that's on a good day. The wait and amount of people is absolutely insane during busier hours and the holidays. Definitely not the place to go if you don't have a lot of time to kill. \n\nOtherwise, I think it's a good date spot to pick that isn't too expensive, has friendly customer service, and a large sized portions for meals. They always serve a couple of loaves of bread, along with quality butter, after they take your menu. This is a huge plus for me, since the actual order can take somewhat long to get to your table. Sitting outside is also really nice, especially when while the sun is setting. It's a little too cold to be sitting outside during the winter, but spring/summer is fine, and there are a few outdoor heaters.\n\nFrom my several visits, I've had: \nShephard's Pie: A huge plate of beef and veggies, topped with mashed potatoes and a parmesan cheese crust. Super filling and tasty, though I wish the meal instead came as a smaller portion with a variety of other sides to make it more interesting.\n\nPasta Carbonara: I've ordered this the most! I love the creamy, cheesey sauce, and thin noodles. My default pasta choice. The server always asks if additional parmesan on top is preferred. \n\nFactory Burrito Grande: A really, really huge burrito with different sauces on the side, and for $15! Pretty good and extremely filling - I got through a third and had to take the rest to go. \n\nGodiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae: My favorite dessert! For $9, this is a really delicious, rich brownie sundae. On one occasion, I've come here looking to ONLY eat dessert, which was totally fine. The plate is huge, and even shared between two people, it's enough to make you full. \n\nLemon Raspberry Cheesecake: My favorite pick of cheesecake, I have a thing for tangy, tart desserts. Overall, I think their cheesecakes are a bit pricey per slice, as the slice is also quite small, but if you've never tried it before, it's worth buying a slice or two.", "author": "Vivian L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-22", "description": "I stand by my statement if you're just visiting: go find a more \"only in SF\" place.  Less of a wait, more ambiance, solid wines etc.  The type of experience you presumably flew out for.\n\nBut if you've been living here 5 years and your friend really wants to go for his birthday, here's the deal:\n\n==The good==\nThe cheesecake.  So good they really should consider it their main selling point.  Not just keep it in the name, but damn well serve it before anything else.  \"Can I get your cheesecake order?  After that's out I'll come by and see what you'd like for drinks.\"\n\nThe food is decent.  Not \"best dish ever\", but flavorful, varied and in (too?) large portions.\nThe drinks are a good mix.  Nothing amazing, but you should find something here you'd like.  But it'll have a weird twist: eg Moscow mule...with pineapple!  Like your one friend who insists on making up new drinks.\n\nThe price is decent.  Especially for San Francisco.\n\nThe service is great.  Servers are incredibly friendly (despite the tsunami of strollers and Fisherman's Wharf apparel), come by frequently, and have solid recs.  And despite the large crowds, we never felt rushed to turnover the table.\n\nCakePay.  It's an app, where you can simply pay and leave.  No awkward waiting for the waiter.  And you can check off items and send them to your friends if you want to split the check.  It's super simple, and I sincerely hope they license it for non-Cheesecake Factory places. (yeah, I know OpenTable and Cover exist)\n\n==The bad==\nGood God the crowds.  No reservations, 25 minute wait for a buzzer, 2+ hours for a table, and a bar that is trying but just too damn small.  I get it, if you're the landlord this is awesome: all these people with nowhere to go and time to kill and sitting at the top of a five-story mall.  Next time I'm paying a TaskRabbit to deal with this.\n\nThe bar/bathrooms/waiting areas.  These places are understandably minimal, but overtaxed by constant at-capacity.\n\nThe food.  I know I said \"good\", but it also tries a little too hard on a few dishes.  Each dish was like five flavors.  Avocado + chicken + zesty spices + mayonnaise + mashed potato + ...  My wife claims the corporation is supposedly super innovative at creating and incorporating new dishes, and I believe it.  But sometimes less is more.\n\nThe ambiance.  Chains are supposed to offer the same value at all locations, so they have to look and feel near-identical at all locations.  But c'mon, you got a killer view.  A few tables have window views, but the overall place feels lifted from the back of a Toledo mall circa 2007.\n\nThe wine.  Again, a regional snobbery thing, but Sonoma is not far away.  You could have some really great wines on the list.  I was surprised to see only a few local estates (including the Cheesecake Factory Reserve).  There may be distribution issues here, or maybe it's just all in keeping it in the chain.", "author": "Scottie B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-17", "description": "We came in on a very busy day, supposedly one of the busiest days they've had in a while. Which I have taken into consideration in writing this review. I understand how hectic things can get at a busy restaurant and of course the extremely long wait (over 3 hours) was not very pleasurable; however, it was completely understandable as to why we had to wait that long. Cheesecake is always busy, so they have a system where you check in first, they give you an initial quote of how long you'll have to wait, and a time to return to get your pager. \n\nWe were told at 4:40 that we should return at about 6:30 for the pager. The initial quote being 2 hours. We came to get our pager at around 6:30, maybe just a few minutes later. We waited in line for about 20-30 minutes just to receive the pager and then when we got to the front of the line they told us, as well as everyone else that they did not have any more pagers to give out and to come back in 10 minutes to get the pagers. Ultimately, in my opinion it would have been much more efficient just to address the whole lobby rather than have people wasting their time filing through a line only to wait in that same line again just to hope they had enough pagers for all of us.\n\nAfter that, we did receive our pager and were told our wait would be 30 minutes. After over 30 minutes I went to the front just to ask how much longer they thought it would be to be told by a hostess about 10-15 minutes. Keep in mind we were already 45 minutes over our quote at this point, but given the current situation it was understandable as to why we were being pushed back.\n\nAgain, after 20 minutes we addressed another hostess just to be greeted very unprofessionally. She didn't want to even give us an estimate, after ensuring her that we could handle the knowledge of the true wait time. Again she refused to tell us and we went back to the seating area to wait again. Luckily, within a few minutes our pager started buzzing, but instead of having a table for us, we were told it was an accident and that they didn't even have a table for us.\n\nThey then apologized and tried to frantically find us a table that wasn't even supposed to be available for us. They then brought us to a table that usually is meant to seat 4 (we had a party of 6). We noticed another party of 2 next to us was just about to leave so we asked  if we could just push the tables together to have proper seating. They replied, no we can not but if you'd like you can go back into the lobby and wait another 45 minutes or so. Which meant to me that ultimately the 30 minute wait that we were first given was somewhere closer to an hour and a half long.\n\nThey were essentially low balling us on the wait time to keep us here instead of waiting. Had we known that the wait would be about 4 hours long rather than 2 hours we would have never came here in the first place, and they know that. So, for the sake of making money, the cheesecake factory purposely doesn't give realistic estimates. They've done it to us before, but nothing as ridiculous as this. We were treated just as another number and I can say with complete assurance that I will never be coming here. It's just not worth the wait for mediocre customer service, and food just so you might have a view of union square.", "author": "Jacob A."}

But this location was just so so poorly thought out. Anyone knows that the Cheesecake Factory is always busy so WHY would the SAN FRANCISCO LOCATION be the smallest one I've ever been to?! San Francisco is huge with so many people in and out daily, ALL year round. The Cheesecake Factory for a city like this, knowing how busy they are, should literally be several floors. I say this with more than my own experience in mind. The design of their location is seriously hurting their business. Not to mention it's also the top the floor of a Macy's, which is bound to be small anyways. Just poor planning on their part. I would probably go again simply because I love the good but with mental preparation because it's just a complete shit show.", "author": "Sierra B."}

We waited about an hour for a table, which is normal for the holiday season in union square. There were so many people there, so it was super cramped just checking it. There was also a lot of servers walking around & it was hard enough for them to get from one place to another. \n\nWhen we got to the table, it was pretty tight for a group of 6. It was a booth that was snug for 3 people sitting on either side of the bench. The server got to us pretty quickly but the food didn't. I'm pretty sure we had to wait around 45 minutes for 3 entrees & an appetizer. That was not cool especially when most of us were fighting hunger pangs. We decided to exchange secret Santa gifts while waiting for the food which was a nice way to make time pass. But because the space was so tight. There wasn't much room to move your arms to open the presents. \n\nThe food itself was really good but I was expecting larger portions for couscous & chicken, especially since it cost $16.95!! The entrees are way overpriced for what you get. \n\nWhen we paid, we noticed there was an automatic 18% gratuity! It was crazy that our gratuity was $10 when the service was not all that great! I guess it applies to groups of 5 or more bc one of our friends ordered something separately from the rest of us! It was $3 per person for tax & tip but that adds up when you have 5 people. I think eating downtown is overrated & only worth it maybe for lunch or for off season (not during Christmas break!). Not sure if I'll come back during this time again.", "author": "Brittany D."}

I heard their food was okay, so nothing drew me here, but I finally had to check it out for myself. Popped in for lunch with a group of friends. \n\nEverything was...underwhelming to say the least. I was so annoyed after my meal, mainly because I had such a such a classic order: a soup, salad, and sandwich combo. You'd think you couldn't really mess any of those up too badly right? Wrong. The best part of my meal was the complimentary bread sticks :( \n\nThe clam chowder would have been good, except it was way too salty. My turkey club sandwich literally tasted like turkey sandwich meat, lettuce, and tomatoes, slapped onto day old sourdough bread, with too much mayo. It was so unappealing that I didn't even eat it, which is rare for me. I took it home and pan fried it to make it acceptable. My brother liked it though. Shrug. \n\nAnd the salad. I love caesar salad. If there's ever an add-on salad option at a restaurant, I always, always get caesar, but the salad was just terrible! It wasn't really the flavor, but the fact that the salad was horribly overdressed. My romaine was drowning in the dressing, which was so thick and creamy that I had to scrape some of it off. It was just way too heavy and again, I didn't finish it. If you get a salad with any type of creamy dressing, GET IT ON THE SIDE. \n\nI don't understand why this place is so popular. There are always hoards of people waiting in the lobby. My guess is their convenient location, ability to accommodate large groups and their hotel island resort type of decor...oh and their delicious cheesecakes. But their cheesecakes shouldn't be their only saving grace. The food is sub-par and the high prices certainly do not reflect quality.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-24", "description": "Over the years I've visited my fair share of Cheesecake Factory locations.  For the most part, with just a few exceptions their food is consistent which is so important to me.  If I'm going to eat at a chain I expect the food to be the same every time.  I rate their food 4 stars for consistency, flavor and presentation.  Being a chain restaurant I would definitely say they are one of the better casual dining chains.  Above an Olive Garden, Outback or Claim Jumpers, but definitely not a Ruth's Chris.  I've been most impressed by their ability to get Salmon right every time, never dry.  \n\nBUT FOR THIS LOCATION SPECIFICALLY, I couldn't give it 4 starts because of the overall experience.  First, the good stuff...\n\nThe location is at the top of Macy's in Union Square so pretty damn good location.  They offer outside seating with views of the square.  Considering the overpriced tourist trap restaurants in and around the square, this location is generally in line with the average prices you would see across their different locations.  For being in Union Square, one might even say this place is a \"deal\" all things considered.   \n\nHowever, also being in a prime location means people everywhere.  It is a complete madhouse in there and beyond loud.  I'm already not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory's standby-only policy due to their refusal to accept reservations which is why I rarely dine here.  The front desk and whole waiting area is a disaster.  People standing shoulder-to-shoulder, some people sprawled out on the floor probably due to hunger, dehydration and exhaustion from waiting out this archaic process.  People are pushing on each other, throwing elbows and just lots of general overall rudeness you would expect to get from starving people in a loud, crowded, dimly lit, stuffy room probably resentful knowing that a reservation could have avoided some of this.\n\nIf you go down the escalator one level there are couches and chairs in Macy's home furnishings department but even those fill up with weary Cheesecake Factory refugees. \n\nOnce you are finally selected to be seated, usually 30-45 minutes after the quoted time, you are seated in one of the more cramped dining rooms I've experienced at this chain.  I'm sure at this point people are so exhausted and relived to care much.  \n\nWhile the food and prices were up to par with other Cheesecake Factories across the U.S., I don't think I'll be visiting this location again.  The whole experience takes away from enjoying your food.  And if you're having a good time visiting Union Square, shopping, visiting the City or just having a good day in general I would advise not visiting this location anywhere near a common meal time or it will drain the life out of you and probably kill the great mood you were in.", "author": "Chino Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-01-17", "description": "This has to be the most disappointing Cheesecake Factory Visit EVER! The only glimmer of happiness was the quality of service we received. Our server was awesome--attentive, funny, and well mannered. \n\nI've been a loyal customer for 12+ years now, as long as I could go out by myself with my friends! In high school, I came to this restaurant to celebrate countless birthdays, \"fancy\" dinners, and would spend an occasional \"splurge\" on a dinner. Mind you, I was a teenager and money was scarce. \n\nAs time passed, I've seen the decline in food and subtle changes that \"crunched the numbers\". They are very minuscule, but it goes to show the restaurant is trying to decrease expenses and increase profit. With every business, this is the main goal. Disclosure: I am not disagreeing with the changes, but rather just stating my observations. \n\n1. The bread: Basket with linen cloth napkin that kept the bread warm. Now, it is served exposed and in a white disposable napkin. (less dirty napkins)\n\n2. Butter: Butter is no longer in a separate bowl. It is nestled and squeezed between breads. (less dishes)\n\n3. Silverware: Before, placed in linen napkins. Now, silverware is on the supposedly clean table. (less time preparing the silverware bundles)\n\nBeyond the subtle changes, is the quality of food. We go to restaurants and occasionally order the same \"go-to\" dish, right? Well yes, I've ordered the Pasta Da Vinci 19/20 times, approximately. It's something that I've always looked forward to and didn't mind waiting 45+ minutes to get. The buttery, wine, caramelized onions, mushroom sauce over penne pasta was my favorite dish of all time. \n\nLast night, I ordered the dish again with expectations of the same great tasting dish I've had since I was 13 years old. I was mistaken. At first bite, I noticed the difference. The once, flavorful and creamy pasta was now a diluted shame. What a disappointment. My only regret, is that i didn't call attention to the Server and Manger  with my disapproval. I honestly think I was just in disbelief that I continued to eat the dish hoping to taste the same great flavor I've grown to remember. \n\nOne more thing, the cheesecake. They're smaller, significantly smaller. My \"go to\" cheesecake is the Dulce De Leche. I don't even look at the menu after a big heavy meal, it's Dulce De Leche all the way! Although the cheesecake did not go down in quality, it went down in quantity. The dessert is no longer humongous and topped with big chunks of candied caramel, but rather a decent portion with tiny speckles of caramel. Ok, so you may be thinking, it's decent, so why complain? My point being is that I'm getting less than what I've got in the past. However, I am ok with this change, it's quality over quantity.\n\nSo what's the cause of all these changes in this establishment? Inflation? Change in Management? Business strategy? Maybe all of the above. I get it. Things change and this is a business, It's the nature of the field. \n\nThe only gripe I have is that the quality of the food SHOULD NOT BE COMPROMISED. For me, it's quality over quantity. I would like to spend my hard earned money for good food.\n\nCheesecake Factory Management, please consider this review. Thank you.", "author": "Briana H."}

Everything was sticky, from the menu to the table, cutlery, and filthy glasses. \n\nI'd recommend this place be avoided like the plague but I think that's grossly understating my feelings.

We did a little shopping in downtown SF and then decided to go to Cheesecake Factory for lunch. Even at 2:00 in the afternoon, the place was packed. So many people were waiting to be seated. Luckily, it only took about 10 minutes before a table was available.\n\nI love Cheesecake Factory. I really do. And while the food was as delicious as ever, I felt that the service was a little slow. And that's why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4. I do understand that Cheesecake Factory is always packed and busy, but even so, we had to wait awhile for our server to come ask us what we'd like to drink. And then we had to wait awhile for him to come back and ask us if we're ready to order. We waited awhile for the food to arrive. And when we were done, we had to wait awhile to get our check. And awhile more to get our change back.\n\nAll the waiting aside, the food was delicious. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which was linguine pasta with a slightly spicy fresh tomato sauce. There were some red and green bell peppers and onions. The chicken and shrimp were perfectly marinated and cooked. They were tender and juicy. I especially loved that the parsley was freshly chopped and sprinkled over the dish, giving it a refreshing taste.\n\nMy sister ordered the Pasta Da Vinci. That was also tasty, as usual. I have an affinity for Madeira sauce so anything with Madeira sauce is bound to be a favorite for me. I loved that the penne pasta was very flavorful.\n\nOverall, I felt that the food was delicious but because the service was especially slow, it made our visit less enjoyable.", "author": "Andrea G."}

At least, that was what my friend and I wondered a couple Friday nights ago as we walked up from Market for a friend's birthday dinner. The plan had suddenly (and disappointingly) changed from drinks at Novella and maybe some tacos, to a full dinner at CF.\n\nNot a fan, to say the least. The staff was unaccomodating, not seating our party until everyone arrived, though there were 3 of us there already, waiting on one more walking up from Market, no one greeted us, no one offered water or bread, and we had a change of server three times in about an hour.\n\nI had a $9 glass of old Chardonnay and split two appetizers with my friend. The other girls had a burger and pasta. They all had cocktails which they all complained gave them a sugar headache. I'm not a fan of most chain restaurants, and I plan to never go back here. We split 3 ways and it was like $50 per person. Way too pricey for what it was. \n\nGet it together Cheecake Factory.", "author": "Crystal C."}

What started off rough was turned around by the right people. We came in today (1/1 at 4pm) \n\nWe walked in as a party of 5. We were told they were no longer seating groups larger than 4 together. We were told we would be sat On opposite sides of the restaurant and there was no guarantee that we would even be sitting at the same time. First off- that is completely unacceptable. I understand being busy.. Coming during the holidays you usually wait 3 hours+ it was pleasant to hear of only 70 min wait.. But not on those circumstances.. \n\nI don't remember all the names of the employees we interacted with but I will describe it... \n\nThe hostess (Latina with pony tail and blue nails) was completely rude. She gave me all kinds of attitude. I was shocked.. I know you are busy but if you can't handle heat as an employee, I suggest not working there!! I didn't feel like dealing with someone acting like an immature child so I asked for the manager.. \n\nThe manager came over (tall thin blonde) and completely explained the situation.. She was super sweet.. We ended up changing my reservation to 4 people so we could guarantee a table together and then I just grabbed an extra chair.. Thankfully our table was big enough. We made it work. \n\nWhat completely turned our night around was our awesome waiter, David L. He was fast, attentive, personable, and was busting his ass. He kept his composure the whole time though it was super busy. Like I said, we come every year and he truly made the night for us. He is the best waiter I have ever had. He deserves major kudos...

Waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for a table. That was understandable because my wife and I came in on a Saturday night at 7:25pm, and it was already a mad house.

They gave us a buzzer for a wait of 15-20 minutes. We are pretty patient people but it came to a point where my boyfriend had to ask if we were going to be seated soon.\n\nWe ended up sitting outside, which we didn't mind - because it was very warm inside. I thought the view was beautiful, but all the birds flying around and swooping other people's food was quite a show. My boyfriend who is terrified of birds didn't enjoy our seat but we did say that we didn't mind sitting in or out. We even saw a bird fly into their glass doors! All you heard was a loud THUD. Lol!\n\nWe ordered the spinach and cheese dip for an appetizer. The portion looked amazing because we were starving to death. (Just kidding, but you get it.) When we took our first bite, it was okay because we were hungry but um...? It was SO bland. Literally no taste - it was like tasting air. We were bummed because we always get this appetizer when we come to CF and this one was meh. We had it sent back to the kitchen. When we got it back, it just looked like they added more to it and it tasted like more cheese. Personally, it just needed to be seasoned with salt and pepper. When we seasoned it ourselves, it tasted a thousand times better. Maybe they were lacking in seasoning their food? I don't know.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and that tasted amazing as always! We both love that dish. I ordered the Garlic Noodles. I seriously had high hopes for this because again, I was seriously so hungry! When my food arrived, I was ready to dig in until I flipped my chicken... I FOUND A HAIR. This has never happened to me and I was very disappointed. I told our server, she apologized and so did a manager(?), I was offered a soup/salad but I honestly just wanted my main entree. They had it remade but I feel like this time they added more sauce to it, which I didn't like. I took a few bites and had it packed to-go.\n\nI love Cheesecake Factory and their wide varieties of food on their menu. There's so much to choose from, along with their famous desserts.

Whatever. We took it.  \n\nOur server seemed nice enough.  He was busy with a few tables and that's normal.  Her kid's drinks came timely and ours took another 10 minutes.  Odd since they were just fountain drinks and nothing fancy or from the bar. \n\nWe ordered food and everything seemed ok.  \n\nThe kid's pizza's came quickly and they were totally happy with piping hot, fresh pizza. I was jealous.  \n\nOur server came and said that our meals would be a few more minutes.  More like 20? meh. I was pretty hungry and I had snacked through a fair amount of that table bread.  Both of our orders were wrong. Her meat wasn't write and mine was also wrong, more than that they were both cold =[.\n\nWe sent them back and the manager came and apologized.  He said that it would be 4-ish minutes.  This turned into 20?  We decided to just cut our loses and take everything home.  I took my meal home and didn't eat it. Over it. Not going back.  There are so many fantastic restaurants in SF that there is really no reason to eat at a chain.", "author": "Stephanie D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-17", "description": "The three star is really on point for this place unfortunately. \n\nFirst things first, be aware of the wait times, don't come in during the weekend expecting to get seated right away, it's in one of the busiest areas of SF.  Parking can be a hassle, but there's parking across the street or down a few blocks near Westfield Mall that may be even cheaper.\n\nIf you're here with friends or on a date do a combined Cheesecake factory and go ice skating. Ice skating gets a bit packed, but lots of photo-ops in the square itself! \n\nFrom the start if you're here at night get a seat outside and enjoy the view from down below it's amazing! \n\nIf you're a tourist, double dating, going on a date, or just enjoying Union Square come here.  I came here with my boyfriend and a girlfriend of mine with her boy. If you're in a group it's a great atmosphere to be in.\n\nUnfortunately the wait is long if you come during the weekend.  We came on a Friday night and knew from the get go it would be at least an hour wait.  It seems after about 6:30, the wait gets longer than an hour.  My boyfriend and I got there earlier than my girlfriend and her guy so we were going to put our name in at 6 but the wait was only about 30 minutes so we waited since we weren't sure if our friends would be there in 30 min, came back 30 minutes later and had a 75 minute wait. Yikes! \n\nRegardless, we chatted downstairs in the furniture section (very smartly placed for people to sit down and relax while waiting forever). \n\nOur waitress was nice.  Very personable which probably comes from serving people who come from all over the country to this place.  \n\nUnfortunately for my group our food wasn't that great for some reason.  It seems my girlfriend and her guy's food was fine (pastas and appetizers), but my boyfriend's food was cold. I don't mean a little warm, lukewarm--it was cold. Eating a cold Steak Diane is not very appealing.  His mushrooms in his dish were cold as well, as if the dish had been waiting there forever. Even our coffee was cold as well, I was able to drink it through the tiny straw in huge gulps because it was literally lukewarm--chilly. \n\nIt seemed that as nice as our waitress was to us she was nice to all her customers, which kind of leads me to assume she probably left our food waiting on the counter for a little too long considering how long it took our food to eat.  The whole experience was about 2 and a half hours so it took quite a while.\n\nThe macaroni cheese balls were okay, a little too much cream for me.  Crab cakes were yummy, coffee would have been better if it was actually hot and not awkwardly lukewarm.  \n\nThe lemon meringue cheesecake was good though. I'd be pretty upset if I didn't enjoy the cheesecake considering I'm at the cheesecake factory. \n\nOverall the experience was enjoyable for the company, but our food was meh. It seems the busier they get the less organized they are with food preparation. I read other reviews about food being a hit or miss, so just be careful.", "author": "Jay K."}

This time wasn't that different. \n\nThis branch is a lot busier than others simply because it's located in downtown San Francisco.The wait was about 30 minutes but we just went downstairs to look at the furniture. Be wary of wandering out of the restaurant floor because the little machine they give you while you wait might not receive the signal to alert you.\n\nThere were three of us: me, my brother, and my sister-in-law. We eat a lot, so we ordered a lot. We got stuffed mushrooms and fried mac n cheese balls for appetizer, we each got huge dishes for meals (I ordered the tomato basil pasta), and two of us each got cheesecake slices. \n\nThe appetizers were okay. The stuffed mushrooms were not to my liking (small and not really stuffed) and the fried mac n cheese was too salty for my taste like the last time I had it.\n\nMy pasta was very bland. The ahi tuna salad thing my sister-in-law got was boring without the tuna. The mushroom swiss burger my brother got was good but not memorable. Pretty average.\n\nThe cheesecakes were good. My brother got the chocolate coconut cream and I got pumpkin pecan. His was good but I felt like the coconut taste was artificial. My pumpkin pecan was good.  I would recommend...it's just a very heavy cheesecake. All cheesecakes there are heavy. \n\nOverall, food was whatever. I don't mind too much because I didn't pay for it at the time. \n\nI added an extra star only because the service was really great and it should be noted.", "author": "Sofia R."}

AFTER our pager had buzzed. Weird system if you ask me. Our table was nice, but the server. \n\nThe server seemed very confused and like she did not have a clear knowledge of the menu.

So, we waved to a waitress and asked if it's possible to maybe arrange seating for us to sit down at another area for a larger party. The waitress then rudely goes \"Oh, you can just go ask the host.\" \n\nNot that we don't have legs, arms, or that we cannot physically go ask the host ourselves. However, as an etiquette, at least OFFER nicely and say things like \"I'm actually not sure if I can personally arrange that for you, but, let me go ask the host for you.\" Nope. She didn't, she just left us hangin'. We also asked if we could order and she told us that we need to wait for our own waitress...UM. OKAY. We don't want to talk to you anyway....-__-\" I'm a host at a restaurant; hence, why I feel like it's necessary to complain about this type of situation because come on, that's extremely rude for an environment like Cheesecake Factory!

It had a little too much pasta water in it but that really wasnt a big deal to me. It tastes a lot better though when they come and shred lots of yummy cheese on it! -My friend ordered the louisiana chicken pasta. I liked that one more than mine. Its realllllyy creamy and nice a nice kick to it too. Lots of flavor and the chicken is really good too. The waiter told us that one is really popular so now i see why.  \n-As for dessert their shit is ALLLWWAAAAYYYYSSSS the bomb. Ive tried quite a few and i do have to say my favorites are the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake!!! As soon as you take a bite , the angels begin to sing. The Reeses pb one is another favorite of mine too. Overall its not bad but its not amazing. Some days we just come for dessert!", "author": "Xochitl T."}

It is a bit on the pricier side, but there are really decent portions for what you pay for. Which is hard to get for a place with a nice atmosphere as well. \n\nI've come here for many formal events and I think it's one of the perfect places to have them.

Great view of the Square, centrally located, and (that weekend only, sorry) free Lyft ride to and from made it an appealing place. Someone got there at 5:30p to wait for a scheduled dinner at 7:30p, and we still weren't seated in time with a group of 12. \n\nFood was typical Cheesecake Factory, but after two and a half hours of waiting, I was starving. We all ordered, ate through two rounds of bread, and finally all of the dishes started coming out. All 11 of the others got their food and politely waited for me to get mine. They waited. And waited. And waited some more. Ten minutes in, I told everyone to just start eating, and flagged down a waiter to ask what was going on. Told me mine was up next, and ran off to the kitchen. Turns out they delivered my entree to another table and hadn't made another one. So he came back and told me as politely as possible that they were starting on a new one for me and would bring it out soon. \n\nTen minutes later, everyone else has finished when mine showed up. I ate a quarter and asked for it to go. The delayed food became the center of attention for the night, and I still left hungry so everyone wouldn't have to sit there watching me eat. The manager realized how bad the situation was and waived my entree, but regardless, my next group dinner won't be at the Cheesecake Factory.", "author": "Allen O."}

The food is surprisingly good with many options at decent prices considering the location - although the cheesecakes are about 30% more expensive than other locations at about $10 per slice (which you forget about one bite in - I recommend the Tuxedo).\n\nHowever, I reeeeeeally don't think it's worth the trip if you ask me.\n\nAs you come in, a typical wait is 45-90 minutes. The hosting staff is nowhere near as pleasant as the waiters, and the approximate waiting times you get are often off. There are no reservations, and very clear inefficiencies. For example, if you decide to take a cheesecake to-go and not wait to be seated, the person taking your order at the very under-utilized takeout counter would not be responsible for putting it in a box for you to get going, although they are literally standing in front of the cake fridge, and yes, you end up with a 20 minute wait as your cake enters the restaurant queue while the two cashiers sit there and gossip.\n\nI hope they take care of these inefficiencies, because otherwise this is a pretty neat spot.

Cheesecake Factory makes prefect sense after their full-day of looting Macy's and the Union Square shops. The name says it all---Cheesecake Factory---known for their cheesecakes and they don't disappoint. \n\nMonday evening at 6 there's already a wait of 10-15 minutes. For party of 4+ everyone has to be present in order to be seated. The wait for the patio seating is usually longer when it's nice out.\n\nIt was nice sitting by the windows so my friends would enjoy the view of Union Square. Food is bland and mediocre at best. We all decided to \"down-size\" our dinner portions to make room for the cheesecakes. \n\nMoscow Mule is a mango-flavored twist and that's the only Moscow Mule they could make. It was alright, more fruity than fizzy. Cosmopolitan is disappointingly weak. I couldn't taste any vodka. My friends had bottled beers. I don't remember ever having a tasty cocktail here. :/\n\nThai Lettuce Wraps quite tasty with a sweet chili sauce and a peanut dip. Mozzarella-basil-tomato flatbread is good , thin-crusted served on a wooden skillet. Pasta Da Vinci is a penne with grilled chicken and mushrooms in a light creamy white wine sauce. It's completely lacking flavor. I had to sprinkle a lot of salt to it. Teriyaki Chicken on Brown Rice is okay, with a sweet-tasting glaze. \n\nAll four cheesecakes are STELLAR: Snickers, Lemon Raspberry, Godiva Chocolate, and Red Velvet. All over the top and we licked all the plates clean. The Snickers one is really plain cheesecake with crunched Snickers bar on top. The Godiva cheesecake is has a stronger taste of chocolate than cheesecake. This is it if you like chocolate. The Red Velvet is a mixture of plain cheesecake and velvet cake.\n\nOverall the food is just mediocre, hit-or-miss. Skip the cocktails and have them instead at Bar Drake or Dirty Habit at the Palomar Hotel. Make sure you save your room for cheesecakes.", "author": "Matt Y."}

We were given 3 sets of silver ware and 3 plates. We had to ask for utensils,plates a few times.sure alot of employees and we had to keep getting up to ask for things over and over. We waited probably 1 hour for food. They brought it out  at different times.So my son and I were last ....soup/salad 1/2 sandwhich...then there was hair in the food ...REALLY!!The manager came over to appease us..gave the food with the hair for free...never mind the  cesear salads had no dressing too. We just wanted to leave since it was one epic fail after another. Oh we asked for 3 separate checks in the beginning and we were given 1 check. Then to ask for that..we were given attitude and it took along time. We chose to skip the birthday party because  the experience was lame.We left the restraunt and I decided that if I was the manager I would want to know my customers experience...the manager listened and said your saying you didnt get desert? Write your address and number and you will hear from us in 1 week to 1 1/2 week... well its been 15 days....no response. I created a yelp because its important for businesses to hear the customers experience .....Customers pay money for the experience and businesses need their customers!!! We were a party of 6 that had a horrible experience enough to share( word of mouth) Doesnt matter if we were a party of 1 or a large party. My sister goes there all the time and wanted her family to visit her and go to Cheesecake Factory for their birthdays...The icing on the cake ( which we didn't have any) was to be told by management that they take it serious with hair nets...then for me, my mom, my son and I watch the cook with no hair net rubbing his hands in his hair then cook....REALLY!!! GROSS!!!\nBy the way I have been a server and in customer service for years and i couldnt imagine letting the customers leave with this type of experience.", "author": "Erika Y."}

This one doesn't get my best review because of a couple of issues. First portion size. I ordered the Ahi Tartar and it was really pitiful. There was 2\" of avocado, less than 1/2\" of tuna and almost no sauce. I did ask for extra won tons and they came, but dang the dish itself was pitifully skimpy. Then on to the burger. Big bun, a piece of meat that barely covered half of it. Either downsize the bun or upsize the meat. And apparently the chef doesn't know medium because the meat was woefully undercooked. I ordered plain tonic water, I got a gin and tonic. No bread until the middle of the meal. Our waitress really tried but there was a real language barrier.

We decided to eat dinner at this location because I've been to this restaurant in different cities. I enjoyed the food as always and was quite impressed by how great the interior looked like. However, the service was rather terrible. There is no communication between the staff members. My family had waited for a table for about an hour, but was told to wait for another three hours. We in no way were going to stand there the entire four hours. There wasn't even any proper seating in the waiting area for anyone. I had to talk  to both managers in order for my family and I to be seated. The waiter had also messed my entree order up. The restrooms were also not sanitary. They had an awful stench of urine.

My boyfriend and I went on a saturday night, of course probably the busiest nights of all so we expected the wait time to be seated was longer than usual. That didnt bother us, the hostes gave us our buzzer and we waited for about an hour and finally were buzzed for our table. They told us to stand on the side with the rest of the people that were also buzzed. We waited and waited and waited for about another 20 mins, everyone who was standing with us were seated, including people who got there after us. I went up to the hostess and I told her we were buzzed and she said we werent buzzed yet and if it did buzz it was a test. A test? I became upset and brought it to her attention that people who were there after us got seated first. She said she couldnt do anything about that and told us to wait again. Well we waited another 10 mins and finally were seated. \n\nThat wasnt the worst part. \n\nOur waitress came and we ordered our drinks and food (since we waited about 2 hours to be seated). Well we waited about ANOTHER hour for our food, and again we saw other guests who were seated AFTER us getting their food. I requested to speak to the manager and I informed him we had been waiting about an hour for our food and pointed out everyone was getting served before us, he asked what we ordered and then replied with \"protein usually takes longer than pastas\" he went to go check on it and 5 mins later our waitress come out with our food apologizing for it taking so long. The manager came to us 2 mins after and also apologized and said he didnt know why it was sitting there for so long. He was nice enough to pay for our dinner.

That women's restroom could use some help and extra cleaning and stocking especially on a weekend. Two of the three faucets were not working, a stall out of toilet paper then the stall next to it a mess. There was even a little dog peeing on the floor. The owner wiped up after it but rather gross in a restaurant.  \n\nThe portions are still as large as ever but healthy and smaller lunch portions are offered now.

They give you a ticket and tell you to report - only to give you a beeper so, they aren't really being honest about how long it takes. We had 2 kids so it was extra long for them.  Finally got seated and the waitress brought drinks. That was messed up - they brought the wrong drink for the youngest (who wanted tea but ended up with water).  While that was happening - I noticed my silverware was dirty (stuck on dried food) so everyone checked theirs and we came up with 3 dirty forks out of 6 and 2 knives. That's when we noticed that the table settings were incomplete and possibly someone had high-graded the settings (no napkins, no spoons, etc). We pointed out to the waitress and she reported it to the manager and brought all new place settings (good job here).  We ordered and after about 20 minutes, a guy walked up (did not introduce himself) to tell us there were no meatballs for my HB's spaghetti and did he want something else (causing more delays). at this time - we again complained about the dirty silverware. This guy seemed unimpressed and brushed us off to hustle away. When the waitress returned, we asked who the other person was and she said he was the Assistant Manager.  All-in-all, the food was good but the problems with the wait, silverware, and running out of food made this a bad experience.  At the end of the meal, we sort of expected some kind of discount on a drink or a meal but - when no concessions were made - my son got very angry and asked to see the manager.  Another long wait and some OTHER guy came over. He must have been the sacrificial lamb as he was NOT the manager or assistant.  He was nice enough but my son told him why we were upset.  We did say that it was not the waitresses fault in general.   SO - my advice is to wander up there for the view and then go somewhere else for food.", "author": "Kat V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-09-06", "description": "I'm not one to review a chain, but seriously, this Cheesecake Factory is an experience unto itself.\n\nMy friend and I came in the day before national cheesecake day with the Facebook offer for a half priced slice of cheesecake.  We gave ourselves 3 hours just to make sure we didn't need to rush to our next engagement.  At 1:00 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, this didn't seem unreasonable.  We were wrong.\n\nFirst, this place has the strangest atmosphere.  There are locals, tourists, homeless people, and the employees all jammed into the top floor of Macy's.  We were taking the elevator up, and there was a psychotic homeless woman harassing everyone.  Remember her, she'll come back later.\n\nSo we manage to get up to the hostess, get a buzzer, etc.  We're given a wait time of 45 minutes.  Fine.  45 minutes pass, and everyone who had come in before us plus two groups of 7 and 12 after us had been seated.  So I walk up to the hostess, and she clearly had never entered our names... Ok.  Mistakes happen (until you read the other Yelp reviews and see this is common.  Ugh.).  She says we'll be next.  Total time to get seated:  1.5 hours\n\nOur waitress came right over with water, got our orders right away, and was efficient.\n\nRandom Digression:  Suddenly, we turn around to find the CRAZY homeless woman sitting behind us at a table for six.  She had finished her piece of cheesecake and was arguing with her poor waitress that the cheesecake should be free because she can't read her coupon.  Seriously.  For whatever reason, the waitress walked away.  So the crazy homeless woman starts going around the tables that haven't been cleaned yet taking the food off of them.  She proceeds to eat anything left on other tables.  What she couldn't eat, she was placing on her table.  She then had the nerve to ask the waitress for boxes.  The waitress comes back with boxes and her bill.  So she boxes everything, and apparently, left a pile of change.  She then RAN out of the Cheesecake Factory.  Moral of the story:  Your waitress will appreciate a good tip.\n\nMeanwhile, we got our slices of cheesecake.  My Kahula coffee cheesecake was good, but the slices here were quite a bit smaller than branches.  Our waitress was decent, though, and she got us in and out without major real pain.  Except that she lost my friend's credit card and had to go searching for it...Not good.\n\nI wouldn't come back here.  San Francisco has much better things to offer.  But 1/2 price cheesecake is pretty cool, and the people watching factor will lead to some great stories later.", "author": "Amanda J."}

Neither have I been to an Olive Garden. I might have to remedy that soon, so I can be part of the bashing ;-)\nAnyway, I came here, because a friend works close by and asked to meet me there. I didn't even know Macy's has a seventh floor. Let alone a secret escalator from its seventh floor up to the \"Factory\".\nSo I came with low expectations, knowing this is a chain that has high caloric foods and is very popular among teens and tourists. \nWe met at 4:30 pm and my friend had already put her name down. We waited another 15 minutes before we were seated. Thankfully, we were seated outside right at the edge of the balcony with view of Union Square. Really nice!\nThe waitress was very friendly, offered bread (which we refused) and came back after she saw we had wrestled down the huuuuge menu. I wasn't really super hungry, so I opted for something small and fried instead of large and healthy (weird logic, I know). So I got little potato balls filled with cheese and bacon and a sour cream dip... an appetizer that was more than a normal person would eat as a whole meal. My friend got a pizza, which was regular sized. Both dishes were surprisingly good. I saw a lot of other fried things, but also salads, fish etc. on other tables, it all looked appetizing. \nWe skipepd the dessert, but took a look at the cake counter. Man, those pieces were ginormous! I would have loved to take one home, to see what the fuss is all about, but didn't want to drag cake through SF on my shopping tour, so I didn't.\nThe prices are ok, I guess. For the amount of food you get, the nice view, the service. \nI would come back if somebody wanted to absolutely go. It's not fine dining, it's not healthy, but it's good.", "author": "Alexa W."}

I've been to this one several times, so I know what to expect. Tonight after my original plans were canceled I came here with two of my close friends for some dinner. We arrived around 7:50pm and were told the wait would be about 30-35 minutes. No big deal we had plenty of time and ordered some drinks at the bar and lounged outside by the big sign overlooking Union Square (quite a nice view). We were seated around 8:20pm. One tip I will say is that while there is always a bit of a wait the outside seating usually is quicker (there are heat lamps all around, so it's still very warm and the view is great especially with the fog rolling in). One other tip I will say to do is while waiting look over the menu! The menu has a ton of options and by knowing what you want now you can get your order in ASAP. Anyways, after we were seated it took probably 5-10 more minutes to get the waiter to our table and we ordered. I ordered the chicken and biscuits and a nacho appetizer. It took roughly another 20-30 minutes to get the rest of our food, but I am the type that likes to talk and after a few drinks we didn't even notice the time passing by. Our waiter Javier was very nice and was never pushy or impassive. The nachos were great! They had a sweet taste to them and everything came together nicely and nothing tasted soggy (like some nachos can be). The chicken and biscuits was also very good! I didn't realize they came with mushrooms (which I hate) but they were easy enough to identify and move over. The chicken was nice and juicy and the gravy went well with the meal. Since we were out we all decided to order some cheesecake. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and it was superb like usual. Overall, a nice spot.  A tad pricey, but if your in the city and looking for a consistent place with a nice view check this spot out. Just remember that there's a bit of waiting, but it's worth it at the end.", "author": "James R."}

I entered the elevator, excited as can be to celebrate the debut of the new Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake (plus 50% off any slice!), only to find myself so close, yet so far from satisfying my sweet tooth. The elevator inched upwards to the restaurant, when suddenly, I hear something very similar to a large piece of metal falling. Next thing I know, the elevator stops, but the doors refuse to open. The innermost set of doors shakes before opening, but the outermost doors only slightly part. As people try to pry the doors open, another piece of metal seems to fall, giving the terrifying idea that the elevator is falling apart. We all look at the max capacity sign: 10 people max. We count exactly 10 in the elevator. One person attempts to press the button for help, but to no avail. Great. Panic strikes as first, one girl states she is claustrophobic, another constantly complains it is getting hotter and harder to breathe. Definitely a harrowing experience. We shout for help at people passing by, but it takes a long time before someone finally calls the fire department. Now what? Well of course, in this new age of technology, everyone whips out their smart phone to take photos and videos to post online. Sigh. #instagraminsteadofcallforhelp\n\nEventually, we were saved. I'm very grateful the elevator did not drop, I'm not a roller coaster fan, at all. The manager Christopher M. was super nice and considerate, offering to take care of my meal and often checking to see how I was doing. Living out my name, I felt like a true desserts princess! He recommended starting with the Strawberry Martini to calm my nerves, a deliciously strong yet sweet drink. Then I had the Steak Diane, which was perfectly cooked. Juicy and well-seasoned. Also had Mai Tai, which comes in an interesting glass and looks quite tropical. Finally, ended with the featured S'mores Cheesecake, which had amazingly gooey, toasted marshmallow and was not overwhelmingly sweet.\n\nAt this location, the ceilings are not as high as the other locations I've frequented. However, there's a patio with a nice view of Union Square (plus pigeons walking around your feet and hopelessly staring at your food). My only complaints (minus the elevator experience, which really wasn't Cheesecake Factory's fault): The indoor floors are slippery, and my group did not receive the complimentary bread until our entrees arrived.\n\nIncredible meal and friendly service (thank you so very much Christopher!), but what a night! Still a Cheesecake Factory fan nonetheless. Lesson learned: Take the stairs/escalator, TRUST ME.", "author": "Christina L."}

I saw a slice of cheesecake fall on the ground, and after picking it up from the ground and the gloves touching the ground, she still didn't change her gloves and proceeded to fill up coffee and package cheesecake slices. It was a long wait for the slices that I ordered, so while I was waiting I saw this, and I felt grossed up.

CF is always my top choices when we plan to celebrate something. However, we had a terrible experienced with the manager( not server or other people). I tried to call them just to preorder and pre-wrap the cake for me so I don't need to wait for too long on my way there. However, after the front desk transfer my call to the bakery and nobody pick up the calls twice ! I give up! ...\nSo I ordered two cake from them when I was there, one large size and one small size. The small size came out very small. Is different than the one on display. So I ask the manager can we change it to a bigger size, I am willing to pay extra. And he told us the one on display is plastic. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! I have been here so many times, and I can tell what is plastic and what is real! I know cake too. I can accept the reasons of no exchange or no return. But I can not except stupid BS like this. The reason that he told us is unacceptable! Terrible service!

I hate when you order multiple courses and they come all at once- but they kept a nice pace.\n\nChicken taquitos were yummy- served hot and flavorable.\nCaesar salad- fresh, crisp, but lacking in dressing- request extra dressing on side- also ask for small dinner Caesar which isn't listed on the menu.\nShrimp platter- hot- fresh and abundant! Cooked to perfection. Served with fries and coleslaw( not just a tbsp). All good\nChicken piccata - yummy- 2-3 thin seasoned slices of chicken- yummy piccata sauce, served with noodles- little over cooked and dried out.\nChicken Madeira - yummy yummy sauce, thin slices of chicken, served with mashed potato- dry.\nCheesecake slices/ ohhhhhh myyyyyy goooooodness! Freaking delish! Huge huge slices. We had to get them to go and eat 3 hours later! Lol\n\nThe prices are steep... 3-4$ higher than what they should be..I think each dish avg. $18...

No other restaurant chain can compare to The Cheesecake Factory.\n\nI've dined at many Cheesecake Factory locations over 15 years and this location is by far my favorite.  It's located on the 8th floor of the Macy's building in Union Square.  You can dine outside (they've got heaters out there for cold nights) & see great views of union square.  I especially like dining here during the Christmas season where you can see the Christmas tree and people ice skating below.\n\nA lot of people complain that this place is too busy & there's a long wait but there's a reason for that...it's that good!!!  If you don't want to wait come during off-peaks hours (late night), find a seat at the bar, or take your order to go.  \n\nOnce you're seated you get to enjoy fresh baked loaves of wheat & sourdough bread served with a side of butter.\n\nTheir entire menu selection is large.  That's what I love about this place.  You'll never get bored of their menu.  There's so many items I want to try but have not had the chance to.  Their portion sizes are huge and their prices are very reasonable.\n\nMy menu favorites:\n\nAppetizers:  \n\nThai lettuce wraps-this could be a meal of its own because the portions are large.  Large slices of chicken satay served with veggies, coconut curry noodles, & 3 delicious dipping sauces - peanut, sweet red chili, & tamarind cashew.\n\nFire cracker salmon rolls-spinach & crispy wrapped salmon served with sweet chili sauce.  definitely a must-try.\n\nEntree:\n\nCajun Jumbalaya Pasta-my all time favorite!  Chicken n shrimp spiced with cajun seasoning, onions, tomato, n peppers served over pasta.  This can also be served over rice but I love their regular & spinach pasta.  Save some leftovers cuz it's even more amazing the next day!\n\nDessert:\n\nThey've got a huge cheesecake selection as well as other desserts. I like the fresh strawberry & the white chocolate caramel macadamia but cheesecakes.\n\nDrinks:\n\nTheir bar does not disappoint!  Their bartenders are definitely stingy with their alcohol!  I can never finish a single cocktail because the alcohol definitely will get to me.  I like their specialty drink -Factory peach Bellini (champagne, peach, n peach liquer).\n\nThey offer a special complimentary dessert for any bday celebrants :)\n\nThere's so much more The Cheesecake Factory has to offer that my review can't justify.  Go visit one today!!!", "author": "Janice C."}

We came during the holiday season so it was quite busy. Since they don't take reservations, and we planned to get together around 6pm, one friend and I showed up extra early around 4pm to reserve a table for 10 people. We told them that this was for our reunion.\n\nWe were pretty disappointed we couldn't all sit together, we were placed at two table, one behind the other, and we couldn't talk or see the other table. We saw a bunch of vacant tables that sat 4, right next to each other. We would've needed three, but the host didn't listen to our request. It was a bit disappointing, but we were going to make the best of it.\n\nSix of us squeeze into one table, the remaining four sat behind us. \nOur waiter was awesome!! I wish I caught his name. He was really friendly and funny and gave good recommendations. \n\nI [think] i ordered the louisiana pasta (or something like that). It was really yummy and full of flavor. The portion was pretty big so I took what I couldn't finish home. I also ordered the Asian Pear Martini and it sure packed a punch :). The others all enjoyed their food as well.\n\nSo even though we didn't all sit together, we still had a great experience.

So around 4pm, I attempt to find an empty seat at the bar of this insanely busy restaurant, thinking, \"No Way That It Should Be Busy at 4pm...Who Eats At 4pm?\"  Unfortunately, not everyone agrees with my logic and well there was a huge wait for tables...the bar was full...the seats in the waiting area were full...the standing room in the waiting area was full...and every ten minutes...there's an employee there who kept his eye on the menus that were being looked over in the waiting area!  \n\n I think I can enjoy going the Cheesecake Factory in general IF there was a way that I could be seated without waiting, not required to talk in elevated voices during the meal, and  not be rushed to leave the table when the server leaves the check at the table...(hint hint we want you to leave so we can sit a few of the HUNDREDS of people who are waiting for a seat).\n\nSo honestly, I don't see that situation happening.

My friend decides she needs more kick cause it's just vodka & bland tomato juice so we pony up to the service station & try to get the bartenders attention which we do. We wanted some of the good stuff I had in my drink added to my friends drink, just a smidge. But instead he tells the server to splash some Tabasco into the glass. That's not we expected for $9.00 drinks, he already got our tip so we were has beens.\n\nNow the rest. What a madhouse. Extreme Noise, people waiting, coming & going. This restaurant is total cookie cutter, descent fair, huge portions. And being on the 7th floor of Macys over looking union square makes for a prime location. I can't think of another restaurant that can be this successful with their large selection, portions & fair prices as well as lunch prices served til 5pm. Nice. \n\nWe ordered the avocado rolls, six large pieces served with in a crunchy fried egg roll, they might want to offer a lighter version, like endive but keep the large portion of avocado.....maybe some more herbs or spices in the avocado too.\n\nThe wait staff doesn't write anything down or at least our waitress. She didn't write down we wanted the lunch portions & prices. So when we received the bill each entree was $5 more. Oh we brought it to her attention & she claimed we didn't request it, though we specifically ordered from the lunch menu & told her so & we were seated at 3pm. Is this a bait and switch? There are so many tourist there & customers that may not speak up or know how to read an American check, so I think this is standard practice. Hint, the portions are huge & a lunch portion along with all the other stuff you may order is more than sufficient.\n\nAfter the avocado egg rolls we both ordered salmon & the portion was great, perfectly cooked, hollandaise sauce adorned the bottom of the plate with perfect al dente asparagus on top & a nice portion of rustic red mash potatoes. For such a manic environment & apathetic waitressing & bar tending the kitchen made up for anything that was a miss. In closing I would recommend this place for location, fair prices & large portions, don't expect much from the wait staff, we still gave the staff a good tip ;-)", "author": "Susan S."}

We were a larger group of 17 people so the wait time to sit near each other was pretty long, which was to be expected. However, it was the customer service at the front desk that made this experience horrible. Daniel at the front desk was very condescending in the way he spoke with members of my family concerning a mix up that was of his own doing. Once we were called to be seated after about an hour and a half wait, part of my family was seated on one side of the restaurant and the other on the opposite side. Kind of defeated the purpose of waiting to be seated near each other to continue the family outing don't you think? When approached to remedy the situation Daniel was smug, rude and very unprofessional, which displeased my family. I understand that the place was busy, but having a horrible demeanor with customers doesn't make it any less busy right? Can't handle it, find another gig sir.\n\nEnter the manager on duty, Erica. She seemed at first to be understanding and responsive but after speaking with her about Daniel, she kept reminding me that he gets paid $12 an hour and shouldn't have to deal with unhappy customers fussing at him. After a short dialogue about my disappointment in how we were treated, we were able to come to an agreement that would accommodate the inconvenience and downright disrespect that Daniel inflicted. I did however lose respect for Erica, the manager, when at the end of our meal our waitress informed that she was told not to accommodate us as had been previously agreed since the manager changed her mind based on the amount of food that was ordered. Common sense would say that a group of 17 was going to eat a lot of food, a point to which she should have been aware. \n\nOur waitress Denay was absolutely awesome! No complaints at all about her service, I would give 5 stars to her alone if I could. But that front desk....just atrocious.

Due to the location being a tourist attraction, the wait can be pretty long but I guess I'm always lucky enough to visit on days where I only have to wait 15-45 mins. I wait downstairs in the comfy sofa department in Macy's til my buzzer goes off to avoid the crowdedness. I never really had any complaints on my food but my boyfriend always order the filet mignon (medium rare) but it rarely comes out to be medium rare, which isn't that big of a deal. We usually don't have any issues with our servers but we realize that it's always people sitting around us who have a problem with theirs. Or maybe it's because we don't really like to complain. There was one incident where a family of 8 were arguing and crying, and their server ended up telling them to shut up. There was another incident where the mother and daughter felt uncomfortable with the, rather homeless-looking guy, sitting next to them and they had a hard time getting their waiter's attention. \n\nThe only real issue I have with this CF is that sometimes we'd wait for a long time to be buzzed and seated but come in to see that half the tables were empty.

We told the waiter and so the manager came and said since he already ate half of it they can only make him half a plate  and charge full or not being anything and charge for a lunch portion when in reality he only ate the chicken and a few of his pasta.

This past Saturday, we paid SF a visit and did just that. The restaurant was packed, especially since the area is known for having tourists. We were told the wait would be between 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. It was 8 o'clock at night, we were starving, and didn't feel like looking elsewhere, so we decided to wait it out. Well, the wait ended up being 2 hours! Last minute I asked if we could sit outside, instead, since it seemed to be a little less chilly than it was 2 hours ago, but was told the wait time would be even longer. No, thanks!\n\nSo, we were seated indoors in a nice booth at the corner of the restaurant and the lights were dim, as all Cheesecake Factory's are. We ordered their avocado egg rolls and fried calamari to start off with. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and was delicious, as expected, especially the calamari. Our waitress also brought out a basket full of fresh bread and butter; kudos to her for bringing another one out once she saw we finished the first one. \n\nFor dinner, I was feeling adventurous.

I was in San Francisco with my friends today and we decided to try the one here.\n\nProblem number one: the wait. It was a Tuesday morning-afternoon so you'd think it wouldn't be so busy, well it was so we had a wait time of 15 minutes. As soon as our buzzer went off, we were told to standby and wait for our waitress to take us to our seat, which lasted about ten minutes. I was confused at this point; why have the buzzer go off only to have us wait even longer? I went up to the desk to ask what we were supposed to be doing, and the girl rudely responded with \"we have a lot of tickets.\" I don't know what that means but she could have handled my simple question much more professionally and kindly. \n\nAfter more minutes of idly standing around, we were finally taken to our seat. Note that there are three people in our party, yet our table only had plates and silverware for two people. I failed to realize this until near the end though, and apparently our waitress never realized it either, even when serving our bread. \n\nMy friend had a couple of dollars in quarters that she needed to exchange for some dollars, so when she asked the waitress if she could, the waitress responded quickly with \"you gotta do that at the bakery,\" before she quickly disappeared again. She left my friend confused, we didn't know where the \"bakery\" was since the whole restaurant looked like a bakery. \n\nNext comes ordering. Ordering was fine and our food was good. One of my friends and I got a new batch of water from the waitress, and immediately noticed something was off. Our water was absolutely repulsive. It tasted like tap water mixed with blood, and contained no ice. We asked for a new cup of water, and this time it tasted better, but still had no ice.\n\nNext came ordering the cheesecake. I first asked if they were serving the Peppermint Bark one, since our buzzer said \"Peppermint Bark cheesecake is back!\" The waitress responded curtly with \"that's only in the winter.\" Feeling a bit disappointed and confused since the peppermint bark flavor was advertised but yet not available, I went with another flavor. Our waitress did not write down what we ordered and memorized it instead. When she brought over our cake, she didn't say a word the whole time and gave each of us our wrong cheesecake. She could have at least asked us who had what instead of slamming them down at our table and have us do the hassle of rearranging of who had what.\n\nMy friend asked another waitress if she could get a to-go box for the rest of her cake. And the waitress rudely responded with \"it will be one moment,\" never stopping, and kept walking by. Needless to say my friend never got her box, and finally had to ask another waitress for it.\n\nWe left with mixed feelings. The food was good except for that awful water, but the service was terrible. The waitresses are all rude and stuck up and do not engage with the customers at all.

The driving, the parking, the wait, it was all worth it!  45 minutes left until the tree gets lit.\n\nWithin five minutes of us sitting down and placing our drink orders, swarms and swarms of people start filling the balcony.  People start crowding around tables.  Leaning over tables.  Shoving their crotches in peoples faces.  Squeezing into every available space they can.  Pretty soon, the entire balcony was quickly looking like a mosh pit.  \n\nThis is absolutely disgusting and rude.  People waited for 3 hours or more to get a balcony seat for this show.  Now, I have already lost faith in humanity so I wasn't actually surprised that people would be this rude and ruin it for people that actually waited patiently, however... I was shocked that management did absolutely NOTHING to stop it.  There must have been 30 tables outside, with people trying to enjoy the view and their food, being completely bombarded by a swarm of rude individuals and not one manager of the restaurant did anything about it.  Oh, and yes, we complained while we were there, and even after our complaint, they did nothing.  \n\nAbsurd.  Expected better.", "author": "Andrew G."}

The noodles were a bit hard and didn't seem \"fully\" cooked or at least cooked to a level where they didn't taste like starch. The sauce was kinda watter-y and not as delicious as I had previously envisioned prior to ordering it. Had a bite of the chicken and wasn't really feeling it. Wasn't the best fettuccine, and way overpriced. Wouldn't order again.\n\nThe only thing that has me coming back for more is the cheesecake. I've had my fair share of cheesecakes from local bakeries to storebought, and TCF's cheesecake is just AMAZING. I had a caramel de leche cheesecake. It tasted a little bit like heaven. It wasn't too sweet and was very smooth. The whipped cream added an excellent touch and presented the cheesecake in a very elegant way. Although it was a bit pricey for me ($6-7 per slice), it was SO GOOD I'm willing to come back more!\n\nAMBIENCE (4/5): \nMy friends and I did not have to wait at all for seating inside (which was great), however I would recommend others to sit outside as the view is stunning. Wasn't too loud and tables were pretty evenly spaced for me so I didn't feel too confined or stuffed. \n\nSERVICE (4/5):\nWaiter was very friendly and helpful. Gave us nice suggestions since my friends and I were all first-timers at TCF. \n\nOVERALL: 4/5\nI think I'm probably being pretty generous with a 4 star review but I swear for all cheesecake lovers you MUST try TCF. The food wasn't so great for me, but hey I only got pasta so maybe I'll come back and try something new next time and update my review. All in all- good service, nice setting, and mouth watering cheesecake :)", "author": "Cindy L."}

Everything I've tried here is really good.\nI usually order four cheese pasta and pasta da vinci every single time I come to the cheesecake factory but I wanted to try something different this time.\n\nI ordered stuffed mushroom and fried crispy artichoke heart as appetizers. Both was deliciously yum yum. I would order it again.\n\nFor my entree, I couldn't decide what to eat and came across the Factory combo which had Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira serve with mash potatoes. That sounded good and I ordered it. The steak was one of the best steak I've ever had in my entire life. It was cooked to perfection. Full of flavor, juicy and it was like a party in my mouth. Just writing a review on it makes me want some more. The chicken madeira was pretty good. Not the best but it's good. Some part of it was bland, some part tasted a lot like wine and some have a lot of flavor. Whoever did the mixing for this chicken didn't do a good job at it. The mushrooms on the chicken madeira and steak was really good. I love mushrooms in case you haven't noticed. I can eat mushrooms with almost anything. Not a big fan of their mashed potatoes. TOO HARD and not a whole lot flavor to it. Just kinda boring. \n\nThe bread they give you before your food comes out is the best. I can eat that all day and night and won't get sick of it. \n\nMy husband ordered the mushroom burger and he said that it tasted really good. Not so dry like other restaurant burgers. The fries was cooked well but please HOLD THE SALT. The french fries was drowning in salt. NO BUENO.\n\nFor dessert we had the Hershey's Chocolate Cheesecake and OMG this was HEAVEN. I was already full but I couldn't put the fork down after one bite. It was addicting and crazily yummy. I will definitely order it again next time.\n\nThis cheesecake factory is located on the upper level above Macy's building in SF. So of course parking definitely sucks and it is always crowded.

We all knew it, but when you one day decide you want Cheesecake Factory anyway and go and find it's a 2-3 hour wait, and then try to come back again and it's the same thing, and again in a different location and it's the same deal...well, it becomes kind of a \"Challenge Accepted\" kinda situation.\n\nDifferent time?? Nope.\n\nDifferent day?? Nope.\n\nAfter the busy season is over (AND before regular dinner hours)?? YES. Finally.\n\nShortest wait ever, just 45 minutes after arriving a Saturday evening around 4:45. We were seated by 6pm (a little longer than 45 minutes but hey, less than 2-3 hours!).\n\nService was terrible for a place that should know how to handle crowds. There was a period where there were a ton of empty tables around us, and yet our server was nowhere to be seen. They forgot our appetizer and took about an hour to bring us our food. I ordered a skinny drink and thought it wasn't what I asked for, but she had said it was so didn't question it...later, looking at the check, she'd given me the wrong drink.\n\nOh, and finally, I love cheesecake and I love carrot cake. There was an item called \"Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake\" on the menu, and I thought it was just exactly what it said: a carrot cake CHEESEcake. Nope. It was a carrot cake with cream cheese filling, like any regular cake, and usually I'd appreciate that, but NOT WHEN I WANT CHEESEcake. Maybe I should have asked, but it was in the cheesecake section. How hard could it be to call it \"Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake\" instead of \"Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake\"? Oh well. It was a pretty standard, 5/10 carrot cake anyway. But if I wanted carrot cake, I'd definitely have gone somewhere else.\n\nOh yeah, and the food that we did get was ok. My boyfriend got the orange chicken and it tasted about half as good as the kind you can get at Trader Joe's. I got a turkey burger and it tasted a little less dry than cardboard (I wanted to ask for ketchup but our server disappeared again).

We waited over the quote time (1 hr 20 min) about 20 minutes. \nSecond the food quality was awful. We had the Louisiana chicken pasta and the chicken was way too salty and the pasta was a bit undercooked. We also had the shrimp scampi with steak diane. The steak was not cooked well at all - it was not steak. We're from Texas we know our steaks.\nWe called the manager over he just said that sirloins are supposed to be chewy but there's no way that was steak. Sirloin my ass. \nHowever, the waiters and waitresses are nice and the bread is great as always.", "author": "Esther J."}

Over the years we probably have been here about a dozen or more times, bringing guest from out of town on a number of occasions to enjoy the view of Union Square.  We recently went to celebrate our son's birthday.\n\nOh my were we disappointed.  I don't know if they have new kitchen staff, new management or if it's too overwhelming for the kitchen to handle as they are as busy as ever, I've heard people wait a couple of hours for a table, the max we'll wait is 30 minutes which of course can turn into an hour...\n\nThe food was not good at all, the pork chops were so overcooked and dry, its plating was wrong, no applesauce, over salted spinach and mashed potatoes.  Shepards pie was served with a pool of oil on its surface.  We know that Cheesecake Factory isn't the healthiest but the pool of oil was disgusting, couldn't even get it to go to give to a homeless person it was so nasty.  Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp came with 5 pieces of shrimp for $19.95.   We've had these dishes in the past so we know how good they can be when cooked properly.\n\nThe only saving grace for the night was a slice of smores cheesecake.\n\nService is spotty, you have to wave down anyone that comes by if you need something, don't know if waiters are being given too many tables.  The restaurant itself is showing it's age, dining tables and chairs and floors need to be replaced as well as the chipped dishes!\n\nWe won't be returning anytime soon, we may have to re-gift the gift cards we have!

Most of the time, if you have a small party, maybe 30 minutes or so.  It's not all that bad honestly.  \n\nI really like the ambiance of the place.  It's really nice to sit outside when it's not too windy.  Chilly is cool with me, but the wind just throws things off (literally).

Buzz buzz buzz goes my placeholder telling me my table was ready and the cheery staff showed me the way.  I got a great little table with a good view.  People were being seated outside because the weather was clearing and the Christmas tree in Union Square highlighted the Christmas music inside the restaurant.

Although the waiter was SO busy, he was a sweetheart and joked with me about sitting down to enjoy the meal with me.  \n\nAll of a sudden the rain started again and BOOM ~ chaos!!  All the people outside had to be moved inside.  Birds flying everywhere to get the food abandoned by folks.  People pouring inside with nowhere to sit, watching their food drown in the puddles of water accumulating on their plates.  Through all of this, the staff was awesome!

Since being back in the Bay Area from the East Coast I've found that many of my fav places either SUCK at customer service now and/or the food is not up to my standards- of how I remember it being.\n\nI feel that that I had suggested that a new friend and I meet up here as I hadn't been to The Cheesecake Factory in years (In SF). We originally were sitting outside in which the waiter; Steven was very attentive. We asked to be seated inside as the chill began to pick up and they had not yet turned on the heated lamps and the damn pigeons were too gangsta for me!\n\nSteven sat us inside and we were introduced to a new waiter (can't recall his name) mainly because we were then given a NEW waiter AGAIN. We were about to order but a unidentified (staff member?) said: \"Hi, I'm not sure who sat you here but I have this area reserved so If you can follow me to a new place to sit\". Long story short we ended up waiting awkwardly with drinks in our hand waiting for a table to be cleared and cleaned. I began to be a little pissed.\n\nTHIS PART TOOK THE CAKE. We were now introduced to Ezekiel a.k.a Zeke. He seemed a little off to begin with but I decided to ignore it. My friend and I wasn't ready to order yet as we were still trying to get situated from the numerous moves we made.\n\nI want to mention that Zeke's other tables were in front, behind, across and adjacent front us. This detail will provide to be VERY important lol\n\nSo it took Zeke 20 mins to return to us to ask what had we decided on. During that time he walked by us a minimal of 3 times- taking other table orders... checking on near by diners and it wasn't until I damn near stared him down that he FINALLY came over.\n\nHe took my order- my friend arrived before I did and had ordered a pasta dish outside so we didn't want to order anything else at the time. I ordered the Garlic noodles (Noodles, asparagus, garlic butter sauce, chicken (BONELESS) with tomatoes). I get this EVERY TIME I come to C.F.\n\nPlus: My friend and I got to have a LENGTHY conversation.\n\nDOWN SIDE: It took Zeke an hour to come to our table to say: \"Oh the reason it's taking so long is because the chicken is with bone and it takes longer\". I let him know that I got this dish every time and the chicken is ALWAYS boneless and I never had to request it boneless. lol WHAT THE FUCCCK!! (I screamed that in my head).\n\nHe said I can rush and tell the cook to make it boneless. He tried to tell me some bullshit about a change in the menu but the item I ordered had been on the menu for EVER!!!\n\nAnywho, he went to request to have it boneless. Took 30mins (That's now damn near 1 hr 45 mins) to come with flavorless crap!\n\nI mentioned that the food was flavorless and did not have a garlic taste to it. Zeke said: \"Well, I can give you some Parmesan cheese for it- that's all I can do\".\n\nHe left and I asked another waiter to get the manager; Lisa- who was VERY sympathetic.\n\nI explained everything and what really hurt was the fact that he wasn't a sucky waiter to everyone else, just to me and my friend- whom we happen to be Black and Indian. I won't say it was a racial thing but he was ATTENTIVE, WARM, BUBBLY and ACCOMMODATING to his other tables and we couldn't even get our water refilled or any damn BREAD- I LOVE THEIR BREAD lol\n\nAnywho, Tina sent his ass home! \n\nI doubt I would go back. The face of SF is def. changing and all these changes is driving down the quality service MY City was once known for.\n\nIf I want sucky-rude waiters, I might as well move back to the East Coast.", "author": "Drea W."}

I heard so many good things about it, I was just dying to try it out. My employee's would always brag about it. So, I got him to take me there. That visit was all I imagined & more. So, I recently rounded up my friends back in February of this year & off we went.  It is always quite a long wait. So, be prepared. If you don't have ant patience you better venture else where. \n\nNow this, Cheesecake factory just happens to be located in Macy's Union square you catch the elevator & up you go to the floor with amazing food & ambiance. I love the interior of this place it's like a formal but contemporary. The lighting is dim to set a romantic tone. It is just gorgeous on the inside makes yo feel like your really somewhere special. You also have the option of outdoor seating & heated outdoor seating at that. As they have torches or heating lamps set up. The view is amazing as your over looking union square, sky scrapers & the outdoor ice skating rink. My friends & I took this seating option.\n\nNow, on to my favorite part the food. I had the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane:mouth watering  Shrimp Scampi saut\u00e9ed in buttery garlic white wine sauce,  sprinkled in basil and tomato. The steak Diane is something to talk about juicy Angus Beef Steak cooked to perfection  covered with black peppercorns smothered  in a  rich mushroom wine sauce with a side of wonderful  garlic mashed potatoes. This honestly has to be the very best steak I've had in a while & I have not came across a steak as good since unfortunately. This whole meal was worth every last dime. I'm yearning for it as we speak. \n\n\nNow let's get down to the Cheesecake part of the Cheesecake factory as that is what they are known for. I had the over the top  Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. Let me tell you what this bad boy consist of: velvety Hershey's Cheesecake along with soft luscious Chocolate Cake. It is oh so moist. That's not all its  topped with Creamy Chocolate Frosting with a whole wall of Chocolate Chips. Oh, this is it for any chocolate lover. It is rich but not over bearing. It's heaven in every bite. Not only is it delicious but it  is a work of art. It is almost too pretty to eat.

Somethings you'll want to know about this location. \n\n-It's located in the Macy's on the top floor by Union Square hence the traffic here is crazy. Usually no matter when you go you'll be looking at a line to wait so be prepared. I would recommend calling ahead a day or two if you know you want to go here, but even then there is usually a wait time. I've waited before almost 90 minutes since I went on the weekend at dinner time. \n-There are two methods to get up to Cheesecake, either you can take the elevator at the Union Square entrance of Macy's or you can take the escalator all the way to the top floor where it is located if Macy's is open.\n-If you don't feel like waiting, order to go. On one side of the factory they have a cheesecake section where you can order to go orders which is nice because if you don't feel like waiting 90 minutes to sit down and then 15-20 minutes to get your order you can eliminate one waiting time. I have gotten a to-go order in less than 30 minutes. If you do to-go, ask for bread...

By the time I had her on the line, I asked for a quick second to ask the other half to verify the cake size, the lady asked me to call back. The wife was sitting right next to me to provide an instant response. I decided at that point there were other businesses worthy of my hard-earned dollars. \n\nThe week before, we decided to grab a quick bite during bridesmaid dress shopping.

Maaaan!!\n\nProvided you survive the escalator episode, you will try to make it over to the \"reservation\" counter where you tell them how many people are in your party, where you prefer to sit (inside or outside) and then the staff hands you a flashing, vibrating pager while they tell you that you will be seated after a short wait.  AHAhahaHAAAHAAA...  \n\nFrom this point of the \"amusement park ride\" line, you will be standing for oh a good 45 minutes or an hour give or take, while everybody and their great grandma keeps bumping into you, because they think the line will move faster, even though the people in front of the line haven't moved an inch.  \n\nOnce you have reached the front of the line, another staff person will usher you to a table. The comfort and space of the table where you are ultimately seated is directly proportional to the amount of cosmetic surgery, designer clothes and jewelry you have.  The ushers make sure the \"skinny/pretty\" folks have at least two extra chairs to place their purses and cute little shopping bags.  Sorry, but if you're average looking and casually dressed, you will be placed at a table where you will have barely enough room to put one elbow on, let alone your appetizers, entrees, desserts and drinks.\n\nSpeaking of the food...  Once you are seated, after having waited in line for so long, you will be so hungry that you will inhale whatever appetizer you order, along with any bread the server gives you.  I ordered a Steak Diane, which when I got it, seemed to be so much smaller than the photos of the dish that other Yelpers have taken.  Steak was cooked well-done which made it very dry.  The mushrooms and sauce had nice flavor, but the overall portion of the dish was too small.\n\nI had my hopes up for a mind-blowing dessert at least.  I figured after all that the \"Cheesecake Factory\" should at least meet my standards for great cheesecake... I had the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake which was pretty unremarkable.  It didn't taste particularly fresh, the texture was a little dry and hard in some spots.  The flavor was kind of blah, with the Kahlua and coffee flavors both not standing out.  In general, the whole feel of the dessert was like something commercially or mass produced, not 'homemade'. No love added as the secret ingredient.\n\nNow that I really analyze it, I guess that the Cheesecake Factory is appropriately named.  The whole experience was a lot like being a part of an assembly-line production -  being shuttled from point A to point B, to point C, served by wait staff with painted-on smiles, food given to you to consume as quickly as possible so that they can give you the check, you can pay (more than the quality and quantity of your food is worth) and then leave.  Then, for them, it's on to the next crash-dummy, I mean customer.  No, thank you, Cheesecake Factory.  If I wanted to hang out and eat at a place where I felt like a number, I'd sooner go to a fast food restaurant...", "author": "Danielle O."}

Honestly, I don't even like cheesecake. We just wanted something close by and it was getting late so went to the tourist trap. Definietly crowded with tourists left and right. It took us about 30 min to get seated. We had to sit outside bc there were no tables inside. Thank goodness for the overhead heaters otherwise, we would have froze to death out there. Another thing about CF that boggles my mind is that the menu is too big and most of the dishes are a ton of calories. \n\nI ended up ordering the white chicken chili with brown rice off the skinny menu. I had it before and knew that it was decent. My friend decided on a burger and the other one picked some beef dish. Why did our waiter disaapear for 45 minutes? It took another 15 minutes for us to even wave a different server down. We asked where our waiter was and why the food still hadn't come out. The manager comes over and brings us our food. Of course, everything is cold bc it's been sitting there for who knows how long, waiting for the waiter to bring it to our table. It wasn't until we were finished with our meals that he showed up again....not even apologizing for his absence. Unprofessional! \n\n2 stars goes to the honey wheat bread.", "author": "Liv A."}

I stick with the Cobb Salad on most occasions.  I use to have the pastas a lot, but then I noticed either the flavors got bland or my taste for pastas here went away.  I believe they have a dish called Bang Bang Chicken here and that's tasty as well.

We figured 3.5 hours would be enough time to eat and get to the next location nearby but clearly we were mistaken. After an hour and fifteen minute wait to get seated and a rude hostess who was annoyed by us asking how much longer (our wait time was estimated 30 minutes), we were sat in a section of a dazed and confused server, Issac. He told us while zoning out taking our order that he was tired from working a double the previous day and coming in early Sunday so don't mind him, though I felt bad for him we were behind schedule and his coworker had already left a bad impression. By the time we sat down it was 2:01pm and brunch was over. We placed our orders right away but it took about 45 minutes to get our food. Once we started eating I noticed hair in my food. We spoke to the manager, we told her about the experience with the hostess, our dazed and confused server, the hair, and our lack of time at this point and she started to make excuses. She took my plate then brought back our bill. Never once did she ask me if I wanted my food to be remade nor offer me anything to go since at this point that is what we had to do. When I asked her if that is her common practice and her response was \"maybe I would have if you guys weren't in a rush.\" Needless to say, I left without eating and no compensation so I definitely won't be back.", "author": "Joslyn J."}

A tourist attraction since it's smack dab in Union Square in Macy's with an amazing view, I never felt the desire to go since I dislike crowds.  But since I haven't had it in over two years, was craving pasta, and it was such amazing weather, why not?  \n\nThe wait is long of course but it's a sizeable restaurant.   People (specifically tourists) need to chill.  Don't come here if you're going to get mad at why people are standing around or if you're going to elbow your way to a good spot on the balcony.  It's just plain rude and you're just asking for death glares.  But if you do come expecting a wait, might as well grab a cocktail and go outside to look at the pretty lights (if you're going during dinner).  We got the Ahi Tuna Tartare app, Pasta da Vinci, and Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic (not pictured).  Pastas were good and heavy as usual but the app was delicious.

The only major downside is the wait.  There is always a wait.  Four stars, however, for the cheesecake and again, the huge menu where most things taste decent.\n\nOnce, the bf and I came here and we saw a young Asian guy with an elderly caucasian man.  My bf noted that they were an odd-looking pair of dining companions.  The Asian guy was around 19 or 20, probably Chinese, and wore a sort of mismatched dress shirt and blazer.  He looked out of his element but happy to engage with the old guy.  The old guy looked comfortable and eager.  There was a weird energy about them.  \n\nAfter listening to their conversation, I decided that the Asian guy was a gigolo.\n\nThat was an interesting evening to eavesdrop.  Anyway, on to the factory food!\n\nFried Macaroni and Cheese\n- We usually order this.  It's pretty good, and comparable to other places that serve arancini.  \n\nHot Spinach and Cheese Dip\n- Not the best I've had but reliably good.\n\nFactory Nachos\n- I don't like nachos with melted cheese.  Bring on the processed gooey cheese!  Skip.\n\nFirecracker Salmon\n- These are actually really good; we usually order these along with the fried mac.\n\nCrabcakes\n- Not good enough of a crabmeat to bread crumbs ratio.  Skip.\n\nOld Fashioned Hamburger and Wild Mushroom Burger\n- Both are pretty good, both are ginormous.  I can only half of the burger and fries.  I only had it when I was craving a burger, otherwise, there are better burgers to be had.  But not many are bigger than these.\n\nPasta Carbonara, Shrimp with Angel Hair, Pasta Da Vinci, and Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes\n- That's four pastas up there.  They're all about the same so I don't see a point in separating them out.  It is better pasta than the average chain.  The carbonara and Da Vinci taste better of the four.\n\nSteak Diane\n- This was okay.  What am I doing, ordering steak at Cheesecake Factory?  I don't know, I was craving it and I was curious.  It was just okay, I definitely wouldn't order it again.  I've had better and I've had worse.  \n\nGrilled Pork Chops\n- I don't normally order pork chops, but there is one restaurant in the Bay Area where I really like their pork chop with potatoes gratin and compote, and I've been trying to find something comparable since.  This was not it.  It had a similar flavor (fruit and potatoes) but fell way short.  It's just okay.\n\nFresh Strawberry Cheesecake\n- Ohhhh mannn.  This is SO GOOD.  I don't normally like cheesecake.  This is the one exception.  Cheesecake Factory's fresh strawberry cheesecake.  I used to get this to go and eat it in a hotel lobby or Union Square with a cup of hot coffee.  It is the shit.", "author": "Erika C."}

The restaurant is on top of Macys, you enter through a Macys door and go up an elevator, or you can take the escalators if you want but it takes longer. \n\nSo... On to the food. Not much to review here - the portions are as big as any other Cheesecake Factory and the food is consistently as good as any other. The service is also quite good. So for that reason, I'm giving 3-Stars, the same as my other Cheesecake Factory review. \n\nSo what makes this restaurant different than other Cheesecake Factories? Well for starters, the view from this restaurant of Union Square if you sit outside at the ledge is awesome at night. It's very pretty looking down at all the people in Union Square. Keep in mind you are 8 floors up. Many people enjoy taking pictures up here with the setting/view in the background and I completely understand why :))). I was one of them, shhhh. \n\nWhat else makes this one different? THE LINE. This Cheesecake Factory has the longest waits to get a table of any one that I have ever been to. Not because the restaurant is so small, but because there are so many people that patronize it. The wait is consistently 1hour+ EASILY no matter when you get there if it's not abnormally early.

Totally there!\n\nI invited along my international friend and the two of us set out for the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. The line to get into the elevator was pretty long, so we had to wait a round before we got in. We arrived at the host counter around 6:15pm, and we were told that the wait would be 35 minutes. Not bad! \n\nWhen we came back, our buzzer vibrated at 35 minutes on the dot, and we were seated outside.\n\nBoth of us were starving, but we decided to share an appetizer and main dish because 1. I don't eat very much 2. we were told to expect large portions and 3. to save room for cheesecake. That ended up being the wisest decision of the night. We finished their complimentary bread (I prefer the darker ones, very nomnomie), gobbled down the appetizer (avocado rolls, absolutely heavenly), and by the time our main dish arrived we were forced to slow down else risk stomach explosion.\n\nMy only gripe about our experience at the restaurant was that the servers seemed to be assigned to specific tables, and our particular server was especially busy juggling several tables inside and outside. Thus, when we needed anything, we had to wait until she was available to get her attention. There were literally four servers behind the staff area out on the patio all of 20 feet away from our table staring at us as we tried to signal for the check, and none of them moved. I can understand that the tip we leave won't go to them, but really? \n\nWe ordered a cheesecake slice to share (lemon raspberry) and I bought another (red velvet) for a friend. The cheesecake tasted amazing, but is very, very rich, and given the state of our stomachs, we had a very hard time finishing it. I ended up taking most of my slice home.\n\nThe red velvet slice came in a box literally triple the size of the one that we had to pack away the lemon raspberry. My butthead of a friend decided to not come and claim it for a week, thus effectively occupying one shelf in my fridge for a good 6 days -____-. I obviously need new friends.", "author": "Rex X."}

After my brother and my brother in law tried with no success I approached her and she completely ignore me and told me that I interrupt her, without saying a word!! I was in shock and ask to talk to the manager, which came aggressively (I guess he was so busy, it is a crowded place) and without hear us ask us to leave!! I don't need to say how I felt, in front of 100 people! I'm a flight attendant, I've been in many restaurants in my life and I know how costumer service should be, obviously not like that. \nFor sure I'm not going to be back in a place that doesn't respect his customers !!

I went at about 12 P.M. and waited for 20 minutes to get seated. Everything was pretty good until we ordered and began waiting for our food to come out. It wasn't very busy at this time but the service was extremely slow and our waiter barely came to check up on us throughout our wait. It is extremely hard to get the waiters' attentions here. Our first entree came out 30 to 40 minutes after we ordered and because our second entree was nowhere to be seen, we asked the waiter about our dish and was told about ten minutes later (again slow service) that they had accidentally served our food to another table and that they would cook it again. The wait time was supposedly 10-15 minutes but it was far longer than this. We asked for another glass of lemonade and the check after we finished our meal and this also took a long amount of time. As I said before, the waiters do not come to check up on you very much so we needed to go up to the front desk ourselves and pay. Not only was the service itself bad, but they made a mistake in our check as well. One of the dishes that we had ordered was charged for twice instead of once. We had to ask for a manager but even then we had to wait for another 15 minutes to see them and wait for an 5 extra minutes for them to find the specific waiter that served us.

The Cheesecake Factory offers an extremely extensive menu filled with anything you could possibly think of and quite a list of cheesecakes!\n\nSince I've gotten older, and presumably wiser ;), I've stayed away from chain restaurants. However, every now and then I get a craving for an club sandwich with fries and an iced tea. That's where the Cheesecake Factory comes in. They have such a delicious Club Sandwich! The bread is fresh, the bacon is crispy, and the fries have just the right amount of salt. Their tropical, or passion fruit, iced tea is so refreshing! Definitely one of my favorites. Their cheesecake is delicious but sometimes can be too sweet. You can't go wrong with a slice of the Original! It's really creamy and the sour cream frosting on top is amazing.\n\nSo why only 3 STARS? The wait to eat here is always AT LEAST 2 hours long! There's hardly enough space to sit and wait, unless you find a spot in Macy's furniture department where the sales reps won't tell you to move, and did I mention the wait time?!

You get the view of SF and rooftop dining is always awesome. I like getting outside tables during the holidays; you get to see people ice skating below which adds to the warm Christmas atmosphere that time of year.\n\nYou'll have to wait a while before you can get a vacant seat. They'll take your name and hand you a device which lights up and vibrates when your table is ready. Since this Cheesecake Factory is located on the top floor of a mall, a lot of people usually go to the floor below because it's a furniture store; plenty of couches to wait in which is convenient.\n\nFood really is a hit or miss. \n\nFirst off, that brown bread they serve you is delicious. Very sweet.\n\nTheir pasta with tomato sauces are usually pretty bland. My recommendation is to go with a pesto pasta. Pesto sauces are usually hard to mess up if you're a chef and are very tasty. \n\nAs for the service, I'm really beating myself up for this because I forgot our waiter's name (This was a couple months ago), but he was extremely nice. Probably one of the best waiters my girlfriend and I have ever had. He was a very young Latin looking kid. Maybe in his late teens or early 20s. I even looked for the receipt before making this review so I can find his name, but I couldn't find it. I think his name was Oscar, but I could be wrong.\n\nGive that guy a raise, please. He goes above and beyond. My girlfriend was concerned with the Union Square parking garage because it was past midnight. She asked the waiter if he knew what time the parking garage closes. He said he doesn't know, but he'll check. I thought he was just going to ask his coworkers, but he went ahead and looked for the garage's phone number and called them for detailed information. He did a lot of other kind things, but this review is already long enough as it is so I'll just cut it here.\n\nWith all that said, this place is a decent place to eat out at.

At the end of the day, I think it's the location and the ambiance that make me want to give it another shot. This Cheesecake Factory is located at the top floor of Macy's in Union Square, affording it a really nice view of downtown San Francisco. Although it can get chilly at times, the patio is in my opinion the prime location to get the best dining experience. After all, that's the biggest differentiating factor of this specific location.\n\nFood-wise, it's very average at best. The only dish I've had here that I really enjoyed was the Chicken Piccata. I love the light flavors and the angel hair pasta in this dish. Beyond that, the other dishes I've tried as well as my friends' dishes have all been very average and don't justify the price. However, I have yet to try their famous cheesecakes so maybe that will be a game changer the next time I come here.\n\nBecause of its prime location, prepare for very long wait times on the weekends. On the weekdays, small parties can usually get a seat within half an hour. Waiting in their lobby with tons of other tourists is a beast in itself, so I would recommend taking advantage of the new system they've implemented. They text you when your food is ready, which is pretty convenient because now you can shop all over Macy's and in neighboring areas while you're waiting.\n\nOverall, it's a good place to bring out of town guests or to treat yourself a little bit. If you're looking for better food, however, I would recommend trying one of the many other restaurants nearby.", "author": "Sunny H."}

A group of 4 of us came in on a Sunday for a quick bite before heading home. It took our waitress over 10 minutes to come and greet us, once she took our drink orders it took another 30 minutes to get those. My drink came with a brown piece of celery and had been sitting out long enough before being served to me that the ice had melted significantly.  It took another 45 minutes before our food was brought out, none of us got our food at the same time one friends nachos came out cold & had touchable frozen parts, another friend's dish took 10 minutes later to come out and was smothered in pepper and garlic in the worst way possible. Two of our dishes were free but it doesn't really make up for the shit show & ridiculous wait times. The restaurant was not busy yet and somehow guests that were seated after us were getting their orders before us and were able to leave before we did. It was awful and I'll never go back.", "author": "Candy A."}

Wait can be long. My friends and I always get there early. We like sitting outside rather than the inside. When the fog in SF fades, it's nice to dine out in the warmth. You get a good view of the Union Square and the other buildings nearby. \n\nThe food here was great. I ordered one of their pasta (Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta) for around $14 I think and the portion was pretty big. I also tried their burgers on another trip, not that great compared to the pasta. One of my friend ordered the fillet mignon and he said it turned out good but was very expensive (around $30). They ask you how well you want it to be done when you order it. And of course, the meal wouldn't be complete without the cheesecake. I believe we shared the Hershey's Chocolate one for desert. There's also alcohol drinks, such as cocktails. The Long Island Iced Tea was fresh and cold as expected. \n\nService can be slow when busy like in any restaurant. Server greets at your table and will serve for you for the entire dine. Staffs were friendly. Water cups were filled and complementary bread with butter is always provided after ordering your meal.

Don't mind the draft, you don't feel the draft when situated under a majestic metal heat lamp... \n\nThey have over 50+ desserts (cheesecakes, only?) on their menu, as the waiter was quick to point out... \n\n***FYI: And, for a limited time only, you can receive a complimentary slice of cheesecake with the purchase of a $25 gift card to be redeemed at a later visit starting 12/26/11.", "author": "Christina G."}

We had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macys.  Fantastic views, even in the rain.  Great patio when it's nicer out.  The elevator going up opens at 11:00 am and is usually backed up with people.  I recommend taking the escalator up as far as the 6th floor then taking the other elevator up to the 7th.  You will be the first in line!  Anyway, the food was so/so but what a selection!  Pizza, sandwiches, salads, chicken dishes, breakfast and of course, cheesecakes.  I opted for the omelet which was just okay but a fun experience anyway.  Try something different and enjoy the views.", "author": "David G."}

It never fails to disappoint me! Although, the wait can get a bit long. It all depends on the hour, the occasion, and etc. However, my friends and I usually don't tend to wait over 30 minutes on average. Given we go in around lunch time (11-12ish).\n\nI've tried just about half of their very extensive menu. So far, no complaints. Everything tastes pretty good! It doesn't hurt to say that the portions are also more-than-generous. If you're a big eater, dinner size would be no problem, but for folks with a more smaller to normal appetite, it might be a bit of struggle for you to finish. \n\nService is a good pace. I wish it could be a bit more timely or quicker, but with the traffic this place gets, it's understandable. The staff members do work very hard to stay on their toes and serve you. \n\nPricing is not bad for what you're getting. Good food and good atmosphere! Not too noisy and perfect for small to large groups!", "author": "Jessica X."}

In fact, I have been to them often and for the past year have basically only one thing I order-the miso salmon with brown rice. It is delicious, it is filling and I can eat it without any problem (I have esophagus issues). \n\nLast weekend, my husband's aunt and uncle were staying in Union Square while visiting from Page, Arizona. We only had a small window of time to see them on Sunday mid morning before the aunt had to attend a 5 hour long opera. Yes, I did say a 5 hour long opera. She is a French horn player and well, music and opera are her thing. Anyway, we decided to meet here as it was an easy choice, nice location, had plenty of places for us to park and we all like it enough. \n\nWe all arrived at the same time and took the packed elevator up together. Had I known the famed Burger Bar was right across the hall, I would have wanted to try that but alas we were committed and had a reservation. We were seated outside in the shade and well, I already knew my order. The aunt and uncle shared an egg brunch dish, the husband had steak and eggs, and the daughter had her standard turkey burger which she loved. \n\nService was hit or miss. Our drinks were hardly refilled, we felt a little cramped and a bit rushed. My salmon was fine but instead of it being plated beautifully with the rice molded like the other locations too, this time, the rice was basically plopped in a big mound and the salmon was on top. It tasted fine but the presentation was just not there. \n\nLIke all other CF's, there are definitely not enough lady bathroom stalls available. 3 stalls for a big restaurant all that seemed to be without toilet paper is just not sufficient. Luckily, being the kind of gal I am, I had some kleenex in my purse so after waiting in line to use the potty, I didn't have to \"drip dry\". \n\nWith all the other restaurant choices in the area, I doubt I would come back to this location for just a regular thing, but when seeing out of towners it was just fine.", "author": "Tam F."}

Maybe, its due to the holidays, but it certainly wasn't helping their case when my friend who had waited in line was cut by another person, who didn't even say sorry, and more surprisingly was the fact that the server who witness the whole thing didn't even bother to tell the lady that what SHE did was capital R U D E.\n\nEating at cheesecake factory, feels like participating in the Hunger Games. \n\nDeath to each comrade until one remains having the trophy or in this case a seat for two.\n\nAnyway, after an hour waiting for food, I was expecting a spectacular meal. I was also getting an alcoholic milkshake to appease my hunger as well as numb my anger and frustration.\n\nThe alcohol milkshake was okay. It was just milkshake mixed with flavored vodka. And the food? Not worth the hour wait. \n\nBut, the balcony seating is wonderful and very romantic. And the pigeons who perched there are very fat and cute. Some of them was eating the crumbs off the floor which made me laugh.

But, if you go to the balcony, there is an amazing view.  \n\nOnce your beeper starts to vibrate, head back inside, give it to the person at the front counter, and they will seat you shortly. \n\nThe menu is so vast.  There are small bites, appetizers, soups, salads, main courses, specialty dishes, and of course cheesecake!  \n\nThe most recent time we went, we ordered the fried cheese, stuffed mushrooms, chicken marsala and mushrooms, and red velvet cheesecake.  We only ordered one entree because we always get two and can barely finish half.  The fried cheese tastes like mozzarella sticks, but more sophisticated.  They are crispy, and the inside is piping hot.  The stuffed mushrooms are delicious too.  The sauce is a bit oily, but still good.  As for the chicken marsala, it tastes like something very familiar.  For those of you who have had Yakisboa, teriyaki flavor, it tastes exactly the same as the sauce they use.  Try it and tell me it doesn't!  \n\nThe red velvet cheesecake was very good, except we were extremely full by the time we ate it.  I would've enjoyed it more if I wasn't so full.  \n\nCool place.

I'd only heard its name as one more chain and had never thought of going there, but we agreed to try it out. My first impression: crowded, noisy and lame pop music. Waited for a table; the place is unpleasant to be in--really uncomfortably crowded--but we found a good spot on the outside balcony to wait. Nice view (the only real thing this place has going for it). We were lucky enough to be seated outside which was good (except probably for my wife--she was sitting next to a glass wall, with another table on the other side and placed in such a way that she was practically staring another patron in the face from inches away. They should move one of those tables.) It was cool, foggy and breezy outside, but the heat lamps did nicely. When I saw how surprisingly high the prices were, I hoped that it was better than my first impressions had suggested....\n\nI had gumbo, a caesar salad with chicken for the daughter, salmon for my wife and pizza for our son. My wife got a substitution for the potatoes on the salmon plate, but it arrived with potatoes, but missing broccoli. Waiter replaced it. Caesar salad with chicken arrived with no chicken. Waiter fixed it. Wife said salmon was very good. Daughter said some of the chicken was OK, some was way too chewy. My gumbo was OK, but nothing special at all. Probably a little better than a Chili's or similar chain, but completely forgettable, and at a price twice what it was worth.\n\nWe had some cheesecake, cheesecake and strawberry shortcake. They were all OK. Not memorable at all however. \n\nDessert made me thirsty, but waiter forgot to fill my water until asked a second time.\n\nAt the end, we paid at least 50% higher than the food was worth (even for SF), and for marginal service. The really baffling thing is this: The place was packed, with a never-ending stream of people lining up to come in. It was really crowded (and this is late-ish on a Wednesday evening, not a weekend). And many of them looked really psyched to be there. Why? My wife said that most were tourists. But what are they doing here? What made them fly across the country to this city, and walk into a Macys and go up seven floors in an over-crowded elevator for this? Everyone has similar chains back home, right? I'm still shaking my head. Man, i once found a great little falafel place not far from there, got a great lunch special with wonderful lentil soup, etc, for almost nothing.

Once you get seated, you think you are safe, but really you are not.  These poor city kids working as waiters are run to pieces, thus don't give you the quality service you think you might get after patiently waiting to be seated.\n\nMy friend never got her meal, out of our group of six  The cook forgot to make her order.  To compensate her, they gave her a free slice of cheesecake, but it didn't fix her hungry stomach.  While at the table we saw people bringing their checks up to the waiters, you aren't supposed to do that!  But because this place is so out of it, I guess that is okay here?\n\nIn conclusion, I'd only order slice of cheesecake here TOGO.  It is not worth it to subject yourself to this unorganized madness.  Out of towners can have at it for the view and \"experience.\"  But local peeps, you know much better places to check out in the smaller districts.", "author": "Michelle M."}

For me growing up, cheesecake factory was the restaurant you only go to if there is a special occasion. I would always look forward to the free bread, the fruit smoothie, and some delicious fried stuff. Even after being to many more 'creative' and 'fancier' restaurants now in my old age, none of them would ever bring me that pure joy feeling that I get when i arrive at 8th floor macy's andseeing the huge 'The Cheesecake Factory' block letters by the busy reception desk.\n\nWe chose to eat outside on a cold day, and while the view was cool, it also makes your food cold 10 times faster, so don't eat outside if you're a slow eater. We decided to go with 4 appetizers and share 1 entree so we'll have enough room for the cheesecake. And even though we told ourselves we won't eat the bread this time so we can finish our food, we ended up eating the bread anyways : )\n\nBUENO!\nFried Artichoke Hearts\nI don't even know how the artichoke tastes like honesty, but its fried really well, and it comes with a garlic-ish dipping sauce. automatic plus in my book.\n\nSpicy Chipotle Pasta\nWe subbed the Angel Hair in for the Penne because I like to slurp my food haha. I didn't eat much of it, but it was good. It was not too spicy, but spicy enough and the thing that put it over the top was that it had this crunchy thing on top that gave the whole dish a nice crunch!\n\nAvocado Eggrolls\nThis is our favorite. I think just having this dish on our table brings back happy times. Basically, its just fried eggroll with avocado and guacamole stuffed inside. You put some delicious green sauce on it and add some of that white crunchy thing, and then it just brings a smile on your face.\n\nNo Bueno\nPeach Smoothie\nI didn't know smoothie does this, but after a while, it kinda tasted watered-down or diluted or whatever. AND it wasn't hella good to begin with either\n\nChicken Samosa\nIt was just another fried thing but with curry stuff stuffed inside. Meh,\n\nFried Calamari\nI think the calamari didn't give enough of a texture substance. It just tasted like fried stuff with cocktail sauce, which is actually pretty good, but i would rather have my calamari more chewy.\n\nI know this generous 5 star rating is more a personal sentiment rating than an actual rating, but i really like the cheesecake factory. I have a good time everytime i come here and that's what its all about right? Sure, the service isn't always there, the wait is crazy, the food aren't mind-blowing and the cheesecake probably isn't worth 8 bucks either, but the cheesecake factory will always have a special place in my heart. and in my tummy too : )", "author": "Ringo M."}

Meanwhile I asked the two waitress to bring me a cup of water, they left and never came back!  After 45 mins when they brought my food, I asked them again for the water.  One of them left and came back with the cup of water.  The food was just as simple as pasta in Diner or Mels Drive in or any casual place could be.  It was a bit salty but the topping was good.  \n\nAt the end when I got the bill, I noticed that there is surcharge of SF Fee which is 2.5% of the total bill.  I didn't understand the little note on it at the bottom of my bill which says: \"In response to mandate increases in employment related costs a 2.5% surcharge has been added to your bill !!!!\"  I didn't understand what the F was this for.  You guys just charging innocent customers (mostly tourists and visitors) for no logic reason??!! What is the Employment related costs??? Don't you corporate businesses make enough money to pay your Employment related bills that you have to charge your costumers??? And you think people won't notice it or will agree paying it??

I realize in my first review I didn't give credit where credit was due.\n\nThin layers and layers of moist chocolate cake and chocolatey mousse, then frosted with chocolate truffle frosting (not too rich) and then the sides are coated with shards of chocolate.

Besides the annoying long wait to speak to someone the management there lack customer service. I ordered through an 3rd party delivery app and placed an order for a cheesecake. Well first of all the option to order an entire cheesecake is not available. So to avoid confusion before placing an order, I called Cheescake factory directly and was told that I just need to make notions on the comments and that there would not be a problem. I place my order and when the delivery guy gets there he notices it is only 1 slice and tells her that the order is for an entire cheesecake not just a slice. She and her name is Nayelli states that the orsder does not say that he reads her the comment but she REFUSES to change it. Needless to say I end up with a delivery of 1 slice of cheesecake to the office. I call to speak with a manager ( if that what she is... because by her TERRIBLE Guarded attitude from the moment she picked up the phone I would not of thought that.) Her name is Mariyah WILKS which she made sure to spell out. Anyway I begin to explain the situation and her response is THAT IS NOT MY PROBLEM deal with the third party. I continued to explain that Nayelli was the ne that refused to listen to what the delivery guy was saying, and her RESPONSE YOU WERE NOT HERE TO KNOW WHAT WAS SAID. I still continued to explain, now by this point she is not listening at all I mention to her that she is not really showing any form of customer service and that some form of apology should at least be made and she then tells me that I am being CONDESENDING and that the apology should come from the third party. TALK ABOUT RUDE!! and ghetto. After about three attempts of me asking for another manager she gives me a first name pauses and says is that all. I ask her if I could speak with him.

I understand that this establishment is a popular choice for the tourists because it is located in the mall at Union Square. There is no excuse for management to not be able to control a crowd. Yes, it was a holiday weekend and Valentine's day is probably the most busiest day of the year for the restaurant industry. Be prepared for the crowd and be organized! When I made my way up to the restaurant, I could not figure out who was waiting for a table and who was trying make their way to the front hosts stand. If I could recall, there were probably over 100 people crowding around the front desk trying to get a pager to wait for a table. People were sitting and standing everywhere around the front area and it was overwhelming to just be in the same room with these people. This place was chaotic. I get that many franchise restaurants don't accept reservations because they know they'll be busy anyway, but they need to really find a better system during the holidays to control the crowd!", "author": "Angel N."}

Strike 1.\n\nWhen I mentioned this, she apologized and proceeded to take us to an open table with one of the worst waiters I have ever had. I wish I could remember his name...UGH. We repeatedly asked for break, which he did not bring until the VERY END of our meal. Are you kidding me?!\n\nThen he kept forgetting to bring my cocktail and kept apologizing for it. Well, if you were TRULY sorry, I doubt you would make this mistake about 3 times. He was another waiter that had a disappearing act problem. We did not even get the tab from him. Of course I left, unsatisfied, pissed off, and normally I will leave some sort of tip because I feel bad, but he gave us such terrible service, I made sure to leave the EXACT amount in cash.\n\nCheesecake Factory in Union Square...you need to step up your game and obviously replace some people on your staff.

I swear this place still gives off that geek vibe to me even though I doubt I could have afforded this place in high school.\n\nThe suburban and global masses that converge upon this place is still staggering, so make sure you allot at least two hours for the time it takes to wait and get through a meal here.

I must have been in a high school cafeteria mood since I ordered the $15.95 Famous Factory Meatloaf, which consists of two big chunks of slightly burnt ground beef topped with grilled onions with a major pile of heavily creamed mashed potatoes on one side and a succotash side on the other (see the photo).\n\nJamie went for the $12.95 Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad which came shaped like Twin Peaks as if to signal to us...\"Wha' ya' kidding me? You ordered two entrees?\" Lots of fresh ingredients on the plate but kinda saucy with the vinaigrette dressing (see the photo). Overall, the quality of the food is pretty good for a chain. Just go to an Olive Garden to make sure I'm right.\n\nWe didn't leave room for cheesecake since we devoured the hot rolls quickly once we sat down.

A slight improvement from the last time. The waitress was nicer to the Fantastic Four this time, by giving us  a table quickly and coming back frequently filling up our water. Which was cool!!\r\n\r\nMatt ordered the Shepherd Pie for $12.00. It tasted OK, but it was a good size. Wifey ordered the the New Orlean Pasta. The pasta didn't look too appealing, and it looked like Hurricane Katrina damaged the pasta, but it was OK as well.  The Rugrats ordered and splitted a Caesar Salad and Bruschetta.

As we entered Macy's we just see a huge line for the elevator so we chose to take the escalator to beat the crowded, as we entered cheesecake factory we see that it is veryyy packed knowing that we would probably have to wait long in order for us to be seated. The host said that it would probably be a 30 minute wait for a table so we were like whatever sure we take it but we thought it would be a good lunch since we only waited about 10 minutes for a table. \n\nHOWEVER, I was wrong! We waited about 20 mins until our waiter came to ask us what we wanted to drink and bring our bread out then waited another 10 mins until he came back to ask for our orders. Then customers came about 20 mins after us and sat next to us with the same waiter who helped them out and was right on task with them which I thought was odd. Also, their food seem to come out quicker than ours. Our food came out about 10 minutes after the customers next to us. \n\nThe food we ordered was jambalaya pasta and pasta da vinci, they were both so delicious which we thought was the best part of our time there. The jambalaya pasta only comes in the large dinner portion dish so I suggest to be very hungry before ordering that and if you enjoy Cajun flavor food then I would recommend you to order this. Pasta da vinci is made of chicken, mushroom, onions, penne pasta with madeira wine sauce which I love the flavor of so if you do too then I recommend this dish and trust me the flavor will fill you up. \n\nI've gone to cheesecake factory so many times in my life and I would have to say that this was such a bad experience from the service side.

I let the server know but after this we never saw her again and she had a look of irritation on her face and said, yes they precook the chicken to \"prep\" it for serving. She said she would remove the chicken charge of $3.00????? Wow, really?

The manager couldn't even bother to come to our table. Really unprofessional and lousy food and service for the price you pay just for a view of union square.

It's your typical run of the mill chain establishment albeit a bit more upscale with a myriad of menu options. This one in San Francisco however, offers that city by the bay nostalgia. The outdoor balcony offers an excellent ambience, especially in the winter when you can overlook Union Square's beautiful and massive Christmas tree and the ice skating mishaps. The heat lamps help keep the cold at bay, but if that doesn't keep you warm there's a variety of alcoholic beverages on the drink menu to warm you up and put some hair on your chest. \nThe only reason why I've given this one 3 stars is because you can never eat here without at least a 45 minute wait for indoor or outdoor seating. Also, the bar ran out of Asian pear martinis, Mai Tais, and Moscow Mules. Really, 0 for 3!?! \nIf your in a hurry and it doesn't mean that much to you to sit outside, it's best to wait near the bar and grab a seat once one becomes available. \nOverall, I always enjoy the food, and like the fact that the menu offers enough options so that I can always try something different.", "author": "Janine R."}

The restaurant was packed!  There were several tourists milling around.  Some were willing to sit outside on the rooftop because to them the weather was not bad at 55 degrees (SF Style).  For others we wanted an inside seat.  Well after 50 minutes we were seated outside which got colder so we decided that we now wanted to sit inside.  Our host, Kameron Burroughs was definitely accommodating he was able to get us an inside seat within 20 minutes.  Additionally, he got us bread, butter and water to start until our waiter was able to attend to us.  \n\nOur food was delicious from the Chicken Madera to the Chicken Samosa, however, the spinach and cheese dip was not flavorful and the chips were stale.  The manager came immediately and remedied the problem because he replaced my dish with another Chicken Samosa and he did not charge us for the 2nd order. \n\nDespite the cold, windy atmosphere, unflavorful dish and long wait it was well worth it.

It's become somewhat of a ritual to dine here with my sisters.\n\nChain restaurants don't really need reviews since they tend to offer the same experience. But the SF one stands out simply because of it's amazing view of Union Square. Sure, you'll have to shoo away a hungry seagull or two as they watch you dine from the other side of the glass. You may also have to use your silverware as a paperweight to stop your napkins from getting blown away. And on most days it can be a bit cold, but the heat lamps make it bearable. But if you don't like the outdoors, there's always inside seating - I just can never bear to dine inside when I could be enjoying beautiful views of my bustling city.\n\nThe HUGE menu can be both a pro and a con. No matter what you're craving, it's likely Cheesecake Factory can fill that craving. It can just be hard to make up your mind. Wait times can also be long, even on weekdays but especially on weekends.\n\nOn my last visit, I had the fish tacos. They came wrapped with corn tortillas, topped with cabbage, avocado and a special sauce. The fish was crispy and delicious. My sister had the orange chicken and rice. It was crispy with a crunchy orange glaze. \n\nTheir menu is consistently good, and so is the service. If you love Cheesecake, this place is a no brainer.

They're so fresh and delicious! They cut it diagonally, so it looks larger. But we all know it actually isn't.

Right inside Macy's. How convenient!\n- Sitting outside is such a treat and highly recommended. The best views of Union Square are directly below and especially a treat during Xmas time, since you can people watch with the ice skating rink smack dab in Union Sq.\n- I am in love with their wheat bread that they bring to your table as a starter. It comes out warm and so delicious. I'll take two of those, please! \n- Avocado Eggrolls: Must order, just trust me!\n- Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: My all time fav. If you don't eat meat or just want something healthy, this is for you. Loaded with vegetables, pasta al dente, and drizzled with olive oil.  \n- Cheesecake: Don't skip or be cheap about it. Fresh strawberry is always a great option, but if you are feeling adventurous ask about their special flavor and indulge. \n\nImprovements\n- Since this is in such a prime location, it's a tourist and local hotspot. At all times of the day, expect a long wait either sitting inside or outside. Even with a party of 2, I've had to wait 45 mins or more. \n- Don't expect great service either, there are way too many people to be served and not enough waiters with the time to cater to your needs. I came once and wasn't served or acknowledged at my table until I flagged two other waiters to ask who my waiter was. \n\nTip\n- You can call in an order for pick-up if you don't want to wait or don't care about the million dollar view above Union Square. \n- Got a date and some time to spare, come here and sit outside.

San Francisco just gives you this amazing feeling that you are on vacation. It is located inside of a Macy's which makes it even better. Definitely a touristy area, so be prepared for a wait. The portions here are great, so someone small like me can never finish a whole plate of food. I can eat a third of it and the rest of the 2/3's  are taken home. It kinda sucks because by that time I am so full there is absolutely no room for dessert. Cheesecake is here is amazing, I don't think you can go wrong with any flavor. My favorite is the original with strawberry sauce. It is plain and simple with a hint of tartness from the ripe strawberries. Whenever my friends and I are in the city and we are indecisive with dinner venues, CF is safe choice. \n\nDishes I recommend. \n\n1. You can't go wrong with any pasta dish\n2.

First of all, the wait for a table is almost ALWAYS 3+ hours...it doesnt help that the hostesses are rude and terribly inexperienced.  The food of course is like all the other Cheesecake Factories, its hit or miss depending on what you order. This past weekend we ordered 3 dishes and they were all either too salty, too cheesy, or the chicken was dry. And you pay quite a pretty penny for this food! Granted, the portions are fair for the price you pay, so I feel it's only worth it if you are eating with friends so you can order a few things and share.\n\nThe best part of the meal is always dessert, who goes to Cheesecake Factory and doesn't order cheesecake right? My favorite is the Red Velvet Cheesecake. There's 1700 calories in each slice but worth eveerrryy bite. But I guess that's why its called the \"Cheesecake\" Factory and not the \"Dry Chicken Marsala\" Factory.", "author": "Cammy C."}

And yes, it's on top of the 2nd largest Macy's in the world. But it's a nice spot to treat a friend to an after-finals dinner, which is just what me and the boyfriend did for our roommate and a friend of his. \n\nIn the interests of full disclosure, we let them pick the eatery. \n\nI've been here a few times, usually for celebratory purposes, and I have no specific complaint except that the elevator ride is usually tight quarters and there isn't a lot of standing space around once you put your name in for a table. Hosts and hostesses are perfunctory bordering on rude, but you have to figure that they see lord knows how many people during the course of any given day, and we all know the public can make the saintliest person curse like a sailor.\n\nOn this particular outing, it was just a 20 minute wait, so our little crew shuffled outside to take in the pretty fantastic view of Union Square at sunset. The bar is also a nice spot to go if you're a small party - if you can snag a table or bar seats, skip the wait and eat there. \n\nWe ate outside, which is normally not advised at sunset in SF, due to COLD, but they have heaters in their outdoor patio area. A few ambitious seagulls and pigeons do make it over the plastic partitions protecting patrons from the precipice (go alliteration!) but they are generally well behaved. I noticed a pair of pigeons actually strolling the aisle from table to table. \n\nGot the bread, devoured the bread, love the bread. Now, as most anyone who's visited any TCF knows, portions here are ginormous. I usually get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta because, well...it's a huge plate of noodles with 4 pounded thin and breaded chicken pieces on top. And it's kinda spicy. And delicious. And makes two meals. Boy got a burger (big surprise), roomie got their pork chop, which I have to assume was good since he left nothing on the plate, and he is a small guy! Roomie's friend got fish n chips. \n\nI was good and only ate half of my meal, and I was just hungry enough to want a few bites of cheesecake, so we ordered one slice for the table to share. Opted for the Kahlua coffee chocolate cheesecake. It was just as decadent as it sounds, and three bites was more than enough to slake my sweet tooth. \n\nService here is typically pretty good, our server was on point and was nice enough to let us know when he went on his dinner break, introducing us to his cover guy. I really do appreciate little touches like that. \n\nSo, yeah. There's a bazillion options in this area, most are local, and a lot are better. But this place cranks out a decent meal (and superplus portions) for a decent price. A-ok indeed.", "author": "Jamie B."}

I could eat baskets of the slightly sweet bread with the chewy oats on top! I came here again for the first time in a couple years, and the portions were just as big as I remembered.\n\nThe Skinnylicious chicken pasta was really good, with pieces of juicy grilled chicken and pasta that was cooked to the chewy texture I like. The fresh tomatoes and basil were a nice extra touch too! I also had that rare burger craving, so we tried the Kobe burger which was huge. I loved the caramelized onions and shiitake mushrooms on top, which gave it an Asian flavor. The bun was nicely toasted, and the meat was perfectly cooked. Overall, food here is good, but nothing that's particularly extraordinary. Except for the cheesecake! First of all, the variety of cheesecake alone makes me excited. I tried the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake for the first time, and it was chocolate heaven. I loved that it had chocolate cake on the bottom and a layer of mascarpone cheese, which made it less heavy overall (as opposed to having the entire thing be cheesecake). The chocolate cheesecake was perfect with the other two layers. My favorite part was the crust on the back, which was chocolatey and crunchy and perfect! \n\nThis is definitely a place to indulge, so wear your loose pants.", "author": "Ashley T."}

I think it is their strategy to create the line even if there are open tables to make the impression they are always so busy and in demand. \nOnce inside almost anything in the menu will be a crowed pleasure and you are sure to enjoy your chosen dish as long as you don't count it's calories, or if you promise yourself to run a marathon the next day ( or before ?)\nThis branch is no different. The service is good the food didn't fail as well.\nThe location on Macy's rooftop above union square is a type A location which is hard to beat.\nI don't like the inside, it is too loud and s bit darkish so we set outside under one of the Heaters. In the cold nights of SF even two heaters from both sides couldn't help to keep us warm. Bring your coat, hat, and scarf. \nThe kids are always psyched about the climb through Macy's different flours, and even more ecstatic about the elevator ride. Then they are truly out of their mind because of the union square view below, and the near by buildings. \nI hate it that they made us wait in line for twenty minutes although we asked to sit outside and more than half the tables outside were empty, clean, and ready to accommodate diners.\n\nA server approached us fast and took our order( we had plenty of time while waiting to choose from the menu), five minutes later he came to tell us his shift has ended and we will have a new server taking care of us. He didn't tell the new server about our special requests ( to leave the decorative seasoning out of the plate, to bring the salad dressing on the side, to split one of the dishes) and as s result almost everything came out wrong. I don't understand why a server that knows his shift ends takes an order. It was very upsetting to send the plates back to the kitchen and again wait for our food. It pretty much killed our dinner.

The reason why I put 2 stars was because the bathroom was disgusting! From toilet paper to sanitary napkins were on the floor.. Twice I used their bathrooms and there was no toilet seat cover. The toilet was wet and water was everywhere. Gross!!  I spoke with the front desk regarding the issues but when I came back to use their bathroom the second time, it seemed like the problems were still there. This is now about health and safety issues!!\nI would like to see the management to have their bathrooms check every 15-30 minutes during peak hours. This is a very busy well established restaurant. I hate to see people slip and fall in the bathroom!!!!", "author": "Ind B."}

She had roughly 10 people in the party and we all promptly arrived at 6pm. We put down our names and the host told us it'll be about a 2 hour wait. We figured this would happen so others sat around chatting while some of us went to the bar to get some drinks. About an hour in, we went back up to the host stand and they told us it'll be another 45 minutes. Okay. Cool. We'll be seated sooner than expected. Again, others went to the bar and some went outside to enjoy the pleasant evening, taking in Union Square. When the 45 minutes were up, the host told us it'll be 2 hours. There was no way the party wanted to wait another 2 hours; we were hungry at this point. After explaining that we've been there since 6, the lady retracted her statement saying it'll be 10 minutes; they are cleaning up our table right now. Luckily, we were seated before we decided to go elsewhere.\n\nThe waitress was friendly and took in our orders. She also helped in accommodating our tardy guest, who didn't think they'd be able to make it on time. We ordered drinks and was  delivered to our table almost instantaneously. Our food came in 30 minutes later, and she came around the table every once in awhile to check on our food and add more drink orders. What I really liked about our service was her splitting the bill before we asked for it. Service was great, the Steak Diane was on point, and some of their drinks were good. \n\nWould I come here again? Probably only if I am with one other person. The wait time is ridiculous.", "author": "Athena M."}

It is very iconic in that this Cheesecake Factory is located at the top level of Macy's in the heart of downtown SF and it overlooks Union Square. If it's not too chilly/windy, I'd recommend trying to sit outside because that gives you a direct overlook of Union Square. This location does not take reservations and you have to talk to the hostess directly in order to be put on the waiting list. You can call ahead to ask what their estimated wait time would be, but keep in mind this can change very quickly. When you arrive and give your name to the hostess, you will be given a buzzer which will vibrate when your table is ready. While you are waiting, feel free to take the escalators down 1 floor to the furniture section of Macy's and relax on some of their couches. The buzzer will still have a signal on that floor.

After we ordered our food we waited for it to come out for an hour, until our waitress decided to come to our table and tell us that she forgot to write down our orders and she asked us to tell her them again. She comes back 10 minutes later to tell us that the kitchen was no longer serving the dish that my boyfriend ordered, threw down a menu, sighed, and told him to pick something else. We sat down 11:00, and did get the bill until 12:40. It was so late that we didnt even take time to eat, we boxed up our food and left  in disappointment. \n\nWorst part about it? As we were waiting for our food we overheard our waitress talking to the people at the table next to us. They were tourists visiting from France and were not accustomed to the idea of \"tipping\". They paid their bill and left her a 15% tip and Janiese complained to them that they should have paid her at lease 20%...\n\nAbsolute worst experience my boyfriend and I have ever had in a restaurant.

We went in for my boyfriends 25th bday and we decided to have a drink at the bar while we waited for our table, we quickly decided to stay at the bar because the bartender was super inviting.   Ashwini was THE BEST bartender We have ever encountered!!! She straight murdered the bar service industry!   She was on top of drinks, on top of her servers /backers and on top of food at the bar. I could never of hoped to have this type of service on my first ccf visit.  She not only made perfect personalized drinks for me and my boyfriend but for the busy whole bar. She did not stop there, she then ordered signature must tries for all of us and they were SO GOOD! The rating this store has is not up to par of the service we all received.  I will definitely be back, not only because of the awesome food and drinks but because of ashwinis killer service.   She went above and beyond what I could ever expect at a chain.  she made his birthday even more memorable by being herself(the greatest) .   At the end of our visit we had a plate full of food left and we  were going to leave it for trash, this beautiful hearted woman suggested we wrap it and take it to one of many hungry San Franciscans outside. I cannot express how much gratitude I have for people like this.   As a server myself, I can only strive to be as good as her.  We have not stopped talking about her since we've been home.

She old us our table was being cleaned, which clearly was a lie. 15 minutes later, when a lot of the people that arrived after us had already been seated, we left to eat at Mc Donalds.

I know it's a corporate restaurant so that is why it gets lower stars on reviews. Yes, the wait is ALWAYS long. Always guaranteed an hour wait AT LEAST. But I think it is worth it, espicially in this location because you can see Union Square. I love San Francisco, even though I come here so often, but it NEVER gets old. The holidays are the best times here, even though it does get crowded. Their brown sweet molasses bread is the BEST, and so is the sourdough. I love ALL their pastas. The top pastas for me are: pasta da vinci, Cajun Jambalaya. Another great dish is the Chicken Marsala with Madiera wine sauce which is to die for!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-27", "description": "Le boyfriend and I came here for lunch yesterday after hiking and climbing at Baker Beach and were very pleasantly surprised. The food here is actually really good, especially considering that this is a chain restaurant. We ordered the warm asparagus salad, tomato&cheese flatbread, spicy chicken chipotle pasta and the fettucine alfredo with a strawberry milkshake and a oreo milkshake. For dessert we had the snickers cheesecake and the chocolate mousse cheesecake to go. \n\nFirst off, when they say small plates, they actually mean small plates. The warm asparagus salad was a very small portion, but I could have eaten buckets of it. I love green asparagus!\nThe tomato&cheese flatbread was all right, but you could make it better at home.\nThe fettucine alfredo was good, I liked it, so did le boyfriend but he thought that I make it better at home. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it very much. The only downside was the amount of sauce. The pasta was drowning in sauce, so by the time I had finished the pasta, half the sauce was still on the plate. Which is a waste because then you're throwing away half of the delicious and creamy sauce. I just realised that I would now love to have that leftover sauce with some garlic bread for dipping. Why did I not think of this yesterday??\nAnyway, on to the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. Le boyfriend said: \"It's unlike any pasta I've ever had before. In a good way.\" So that's some pretty high praise from him. :) And I must say, his plate did look delicious! Especially with the asparagus which I only realised at the end of the meal I would have loved to have had it with my pasta. Seriously, I love green asparagus. \n\nAs for the service. Our server, was sweet, friendly and helpful. He really deserved the tip. I know tipping is kind of the standard here in the U.S. but I still only tip when people actually deserve it. I can't remember our server's name though and don't have the receipt to check, but I hope he reads this and knows how much we appreciated him. So again, thank you for your wonderful service.\n\nNow, the cheesecakes. As you may know, cheesecake is my thing and I'm very picky about it. Considering that this is a chain restaurant I didn't have any expectations for the cheesecake, so I was pleasantly surprised by them. I liked them and even le boyfriend liked it and he used to hate cheesecake and will only eat the one my dad and I make. The first bite of the snickers cheesecake tastes a bit weird, but don't worry, the rest of it really does taste like snickers. And cheesecake, obviously.\nThe chocolate mousse cheesecake is just dreamy. We both loved it and I would definitely order it again.\n\nSo, to sum it up: surprisingly good food, friendly service and good cheesecake. I'll definitely come back here. If not on this trip, then definitely on our next trip to San Francisco. ;)", "author": "Bekkah R."}

Seriously, that and the lure of cheesecake are the only reasons why I would ever consider coming here. \n\nIt may seem like I'm ragging on this restaurant, but I have no real complaints.  I mean, it's just like any other chain restaurant: variety of food and drinks, nice decor, decent service, and solid food. But the experience of sitting out on the patio (if it's not that cold outside or if it is cold, and you can brave the cold) or even sitting next to the huge windows that look out into the patio makes the wait worth it! I know people often complain about the wait, but I think if you come here at like 6:00 on a weekday, you'll likely beat the dinner crowd and have your choice of tables.\n\nI would say this is definitely one of those places to take your out-of-town friends and family when they come visit the city. Not only is it in a really pretty part of town (next to the Tiffany's and Louis Vuitton stores), but there's a huge tourist draw. Imagine your friends saying: \"Yeah, [your name here] took me to the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square. It's right on the roof of Macys! Woah . . . it was such a cool experience.

Well, since it was 4:30PM on a Sunday afternoon, I figured the wait should be tolerable. We were told a half hour wait, ended up being just 20 minutes. \n\nInstead of being seated inside, were seated out on the terrace, overlooking Union Square. It was a sunny, mild afternoon, with a clear sky, and great view of Union Square, and the people walking on the streets below. I haven't ate outdoors in a Cheesecake Factory location in a long time. The last time was sitting dockside at the Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach. The alfresco dining at the Union Square location was reminding me of that location. \n\nThe food itself was OK, and the portions were massive as usual. This location doesn't have a kid's menu like other locations, but they do make kid's portions of what's one their menu. \n\n-Kid-sized Fettuccine Alfredo: This was a pretty portion for kid size. It was cheesy and creamy, but unfortunately, some of the noodles weren't completely cooked, and some pieces were hard and chalky. \n\n-Kid-Sized Four Cheese Pasta: Penne pasta with a marinara sauce made of Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano and Parmesan cheeses. Also a pretty hefty portion for kid size. \n\n-Luau Salad: My wife had this the last time we were at a CF in Orlando. A very visually appealing salad of lettuce, cucumbers, grilled chicken, peppers, carrots, mangoes, mac nuts, and sesame seeds, all layered with large wonton strips. \n\n-Wasabi crusted ahi: This was pretty large slab of seared ahi, placed on a parabolic shaped bed of rice. Ahi crust was bread crumbs, made green with wasabi. I really looking for a little bite from the wasabi, but didn't taste it. Also came with side of vegetables in a miso sauce. It as more of a buttery sauce than a miso sauce, but was still good. \n\nOf course we couldn't pass up the cheese cakes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aSeldMKv9G6_8-gV0bjwvw?select=XhwI-gWjGpH97XF5R2ivxw) \n\n-30th Anniversary: Cheesecake layered with chocolate cake, and with chocolate chips and crispies on the frosting. Topped with chocolate ganache and lots of whipped cream \n\n-Double Oreo Mudslide: Chocolate cheesecake with Oreos mixed in, topped with chocolate ganache and whipped cream. This was good! perfect for chocoholics. \n\n-Key Lime: Needed something other than chocolate. Slightly tart and refreshing cheesecake with a graham cracker crust. Again with lots of whipped cream. \n\nThe downside of eating outside in the sun was that the cheesecakes softened very quickly, and started to become a floppy mess. But by then, we were already full from the cheesecake, and done eating. \n\nNo complaints on the service. Our server was attentive and friendly, and the other servers who brought out our food were very efficient. \n\nAs I said earlier, the food itself is OK, about the same consistency as the other locations, and would be a 3 star.  However, I'd bump it up another star for the perfect weather that day, which made it a happy and pleasant dining experience for us.", "author": "Steve L."}

By the time we reached the restaurant, the place was already packed!!!! As for drinks I started with a passion fruit mojito, and whats \"special\" about it is that it happens to be my first time trying it. When I first sipped into that drink of goodness, I immediately blown away on how delicious it tasted! it was fresh, minty, cool, tropical, sweet, and tarty..this wont be last time ordering it ever again. Ok I'm gonna stop raving about mojitos :)\n    \n   Appetizers and Small Snacks was what we ordered just because we wanted lots of variety! and indeed we did get lots of variety. As a matter of fact we ordered so much variety that it filled up the table (that takes up 4 people space wise). In no particular order we ordered their buffalo chicken wings, that were covered in some tobasco like hot sauce. It also comes with a blue cheese dressing, and I HATE blue cheese so we asked to have ranch instead. However after dipping celery (came with the wings) in this so called \"ranch\" I realized it wasn't ranch at all, but BLUE CHEESE DRESSING!!  I was like \"nooo! tip reduction!!\"...-joking- I just let it slip by and besides it saved me a few calories right?? chicken wings in general were alright nothing to jump up and down about. \n\n Vietnamese tacos were delish! the pork, and the pickled vegetables make a perfect couple. Only I wish the pork was tender, instead it was stringing and a little dry. Artichoke and Crab was alright, I tasted better at other places. It was a little bland, with too much cheese and actually spotted a blot of cream cheese in the middle of the dip. I guess I can now say so that's part of their ingredient to making it creamy. Last but not least, Fried Calamari! Out of all the dishes we ordered my favorite was the fried calamari! it came with cocktail sauce, and some mayo/lemon/dill sauce. Calamari tasted fresh even though they were most likely frozen, I even spotted some cute little small tentacle calamari babies which I was pretty amused to see. Batter over it was bland, without the sauces my palate would've eaten dead bland calamari minions.", "author": "Aja S."}

The ambiance inside the restaurant is decadent. There are high ceilings and swanky decor bathed in yellow lights. Large pillars run from the floor to the ceiling; it feels very fancy.\n\nThe restaurant is usually very crowded, and there's a lot of noise from all the patrons in the restaurant. Hard to get seated immediately unless you have a reservation.\n\nService is okay, although there will be stretches of time when you don't see your server at all, even if your glass of water or basket of bread is empty. This is probably because there are so many patrons in the restaurant, all of whom keep the servers quite busy.\n\nThe food is decent enough; I like the Cashew Chicken, especially, which is a nice spicy dish served with green onions and roasted cashews. The menu claims that it's a Mandarin dish, but I doubt that. Honestly, I doubt that it was even inspired by a Mandarin dish!\n\nHard to avoid the cheesecake at the end of the meal, too! I think my favorite is the Oreo cookie cheesecake! Definitely puts a good end to the meal!\n\nOverall, Cheesecake Factory is a chain, and isn't anything too special.

Being in San Francisco, we had a plethora of dining choices of which to choose - but we decided to meet our friends at the Cheesecake Factory because of its extensive menu, late hours and excellent view/location.\n\nWe came to regret that decision.  After being treated extremely rudely by our waiter, \"Adam J\", we decided to complain to management.  We were directed to the Assistant General Manager, Ed Miller.  As we watched him approach our table, we saw him briefly discuss the situation with Adam and roll his eyes.  When he arrived at our table, his first words were \"I apologize for what you guys think happened\".\nWe were shocked and disgusted by the manner in which Ed approached us.  He was obviously already on the defensive because he did not want to take the time to listen to the situation. \n\nAnd the situation did not improve.  After Ed dismissed our complaints without even a slight show of genuine remorse, we quickly gathered our things and departed the restaurant.  As we were leaving the dining area, we joined another dining party in the elevator.  They too were complaining about the ill treatment that they were given!\n\nWe were a party of 4, plus a 2-year old child.  We were all over the age of 30.  We were a happy group that just wanted to enjoy the view, a good meal and a bottle of wine.  I have never encountered such a rude, unhappy waiter paired with an equally unhappy, unprofessional and bullheaded manager.  It is obvious to me that the wait staff at this location needs additional training in the field of customer service.  I have never had any complaints about a Cheesecake Factory - until now.", "author": "Ruby E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-11", "description": "I would rate this place 5 stars or more for the occasion and the memories, but I cannot. Came to this restaurant around the first week of January. This was one of the first places I went to for my first date with my boyfriend, and it was quite a memorable night. We talk about it a lot til this day and look forward to coming back again (When he graduates and hopefully finds a job here *fingers crossed*) On with the review though, and less with the cheese.\n____\nThe Wait:\nCan't talk about the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square without mentioning the wait! It's almost like a strange conversational blasphemy...Gotta talk about the wait. Let's just say it's the kind of wait where, you have to go window shopping just to kill the time. If the person at the front desk says 30 min, they mean 30 min and maybe a few after. If they say an hour, they mean an hour. They provide you with one of those portable electronic ringers to let you know your seat is ready. Just be patient.\n\nWe had to wait an hour and some minutes, which was fine with us because it gave us time to window shop (don't buy anything in Union Square unless you make a six figure salary, seriously. What are you? A wallet serial killer?) and walk about downtown. Even explore the huge Macy's store. Sofas are conveniently placed next to the restaurant's entrance if you don't plan on walking anywhere to kill time. If they've moved it by the time you read this review: sorry bud. Your couch is in another floor. (Mario reference was intentional).\n\n____\nThe Service:\nService was great in my opinion. I didn't have any rude service. The people at front desk had to raise their voice almost to yell to inform us of stuff over the crowd, so don't take it as them being rude. They're just trying to do their job. Our waiter was a very cheery gay man who was very funny and checked in on us at appropriate times. He didn't check in on us excessively which was very kind of him. He was available to us whenever we needed him though. Wish I remembered his name! But wherever you are dude, you're great. Keep it up.\n\n___\nThe Atmosphere:\nWe sat on the balcony part and it can get a bit chilly yes, but they got space heaters for that and we were placed conveniently next to it. Nice fancy atmosphere. A bit dark on the inside, but it sets the date mood. Great view of the city at night and very clean and nice. Very crowded though. As soon as you get to the restaurant via escalators, you'll notice how loud it is. It's a popular place though, so don't be surprised.\n\n___\nThe Food:\nI can't remember 100% what we ordered. I just know my boyfriend got a pizza, I got some sort of chicken pesto tomato garlic pasta, and we got vanilla bean cheesecake. Let's just say pasta is not this restaurants forte. I'll mention the bad first then the good.\n\n-Cons: You could tell the pasta was made with canned tomatoes, poorly chopped up garlic and boxed pasta. The chicken was very dry too and the plate overall tasted pre-made. The pasta was not boiled well, because I had some half cooked noodles and some over cooked noodles. It was a mixture of both. The sauce had way too much garlic and not enough flavor. It tasted like watered down tomatoes and that it came straight from a can. I felt like there wasn't a lot of love put into my dish. The portion was very big, which I didn't mind. Overall, the dish could have been done better if each part was cooked well.\n\n-Pros: The pizza was great. It was yummy warm and flavorful. The crust was thin but still crunchy and not stale. I wish I ordered the pizza instead of pasta, because I found myself eating off the same plate as my boyfriend more than my own. \n\nThe cheesecake was the star of the show. We were very full but we still wanted to eat all of the cheesecake, but we had to save it. Even after saving it in a box, it still tasted delicious. The vanilla was fragrant and just the right amount of sweetness. The cheesecake was very airy but sweet and delightful. The whip cream was whipped to the right consistency and I felt like I was eating sweet clouds in my mouth. A nice light cheesecake, not full of a lot of strong flavors but it was juuuust right. Probably the best cheesecake I had in my life so far. I look forward to trying more from there next time. \n\n___\nOther comments: \nNot much besides go for the cheesecakes. Every other dish is kind of questionable. If you want to take someone on a date, this is one of those places to put on your list. I miss this place, and we'll come back for it on another date. I'll order something other than the pasta though. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!", "author": "J. H."}

If you've read any of my previous reviews, you know I'm one more for quality than quantity. It's not that I'm trying to give people less food for their buck, but if you can give me as in my last case with them a $10 omelet with breakfast potatoes and toast, then please give me a healthy meal, please, I'm not trying to consume food for two people! Most Americans are not pregnant! \n\nDon't get me wrong, the omelet (Californian- with avocado, mushrooms, three types of cheeses etc) was divine, but FOUR EGGS! REALLY? Two slices of toast AND breakfast potatoes? It should have been mandatory to have some kind of fruit plate in that platter and some kind of bulky green in the omelet. How else are you supposed to consider downing this as just lunch? Because of the thickness in the omelet, I was only able to consume half of it while still having half of my toast and my potatoes. \n\nIf you come here and have never experienced a Cheesecake Factory, please be aware, it's a high tourist trap, especially in this city where the city views from the balcony are actually worth having a drink or two. With that said, possibly the best and most authentic food I've tasted here has been the cheesecakes, which I'll always get to go for parties, special occasions and what not. But as I say, if you're looking for authentic Asian cuisine, or for that matter, a normal sized platter, don't stop here as the service tends to be slower than normal.", "author": "Carolina S."}

You can either take the escalators or the elevators.\n\nThe view is breathtaking and truly a urban experience as far as getting the \"feel\" of the city. I recommend sitting outside at least once. The service at the Bar is always rushed for the Bartenders as they are handling drink orders for the tables as well. Our drinks were strong and tasty and the appetizers we ordered were plentiful.

Now that that's off my chest, I can start my review.\n\nThe wait time was about 45 minutes, but we were told it was going to be about 25 minutes. Once our buzzer thing went off, I was directed to \"wait over there\" with a large group of other people waiting to get seated by a hostess.\n\nAfter 5 more minutes of waiting, we were brought to our table set for 4. But we were a group of 5..... No, sorry, bringing up a chair to stick at the end of booth sized for 4 isn't going to cut it. So, after waiting a few more minutes, we were brought to a table that was meant for really 5 people.\n\nOur waiter took our orders, and told us that the kitchen was backed up for about 30 minutes, but he \"wasn't really supposed to tell us that.\" So yes, service took really long.... My salad came, with a scant few slices of chicken inside. We renamed it the hidden treasure salad instead.\n\nGlad my only reason to come here was to accomodate a picky eater...

Just make sure you eat before you get on the wait list. \n\nI've literally put my name down on the list just to go back to Union Square for happy hour at a nearby restaurant. After loading up on drinks and appetizers, we proceeded back to Westfield to kill some time. After we finished walking around, we went back to Macys to walk around some more. We were finally seated after a two hour wait.\n\nWe started off with several appetizers including the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip, Fire-Roasted Artichoke, Thai Lettuce Wraps, and Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll. The Fire-Roasted Artichoke put the Hot Spinach Cheese Dip to shame, but both were pleasant. I don't know why we ordered two sets of chips and dips.The Thai Lettuce wrap was too complex for a brute like me. I refuse to pay for a meal just to make it myself. The Spicy Ahi was winner of the appetizers though. I honestly didn't expect it to be that great, but it was and more.\n\nFlipping through the menu, I noticed \"We use premium Certified Angus Beef\u00aeor American Style Kobe for all of Our Burgers\". I asked the waiter is it REAL Kobe beef? He told me yes. For $13.95, I absolutely refused to believe it was. After going back and fourth and questioning my waiter's integrity and morals, I decided I had no grounds to judge whether it was real Kobe beef or not seeing how I've never tried it. So I ordered it!\n\nMy KOBE burger came and the moment of truth was in my fingertips. It wasn't Kobe beef. But don't get me wrong, it was still a solid grade A burger with some of the best fries around. But at the end of the day, it was still just regular beef.\n\nWe didn't order cheesecake because a total of 7 appetizers, multiple rounds of drinks, salad/soup, and an entree was more than enough to satisfy four people (gluttony will be the death of us). The bill came out to be around 140$ between four people ordering a feast fit for a king. Not bad. Overall a good choice for a meal if you have some time on your hands.

When we first got there the hostess told us that the wait would be 20-30 mins.  No biggie, we went to the bar and got a few drinks while waiting.  When our pager finally went off, we took our drinks with us. The server from the bar chased us down and told us that we had to pay before we left. He said that it was too difficult for him to transfer our drinks to our table.  That's different. We've always been able to bring our drinks with no problems.  Not wanting to argue, we decided to close out our tab.  \n\nSo when we got to the hostess counter, they took the pager and made us wait another 10 mins.  Why page us if you're going to make us wait some more?  Anyway, we were finally shown our table. Our server seemed pretty attentive in the beginning.  Giving us adequate time to review the menus and then took our order.  This is where my biggest disappointment came.  I had ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta.  When the dish came, it had almost no shrimp on it. And the shrimp that was on it looked like it was from what you would use to make a shrimp salad.  The shrimps were the size of nickels. Thoroughly disappointed.  \nMy friend ordered the Pasta Marinara and had to send it back 2 times because it was too salty to eat. They comped her food but by the time her food finally was edible, the rest of us were done eating.  \n\nBy now our server has disappeared and is nowhere to be found.  We had to flag down someone else to box our leftovers.  And instead of bagging it for us, she just threw us the boxes.  When we were finally done, we had to stand in the long line to take the elevators to the ground floor because the escalators were blocked off.  \n\nI don't think I'll be coming back here again.

The view of Union Square is nice. The menu is HUGE, and there are (probably) literally hundreds of options to choose from. Portion size is big- too. Free bread baskets are warm- and the cheesecake is awesome.\n\nCons: This place is SO big that it takes forever for a waiter to reach you.

All pastas taste the same- all Mexican options taste similar.

Except for the Bad food they serve us like frozen pasta or burnt stake They keeps messing up our orders that the FEMALE manager had to come see what we had ordered. When she wakes up to the table she did not great us or ever told us her name she had brought a plate of food that we clearly did not order and instead of apologizing she got mad and gave us attitude when we tried to explain how we did not order the plate of food.  The female manager had told us that it was normal for the pasta to be like that and did not apologize. I think if we would have gone to Mc Donald's it would have been a better expirence and better food .", "author": "Lizbeth R."}

If you want a salad, I would go for the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. Sandwhich, Shimp & Bacon Club is awesome there. Their Pizza & Salad Lunch Combo is a great deal and really good too. \n\nDessert: I am not much of a tiramisu fan, but I must say that their Tiramisu Cheesecake is absolutely delicious!!!

I entered through the mall and the guys on the first floor convinced me to abandon my plan to take Frontera express to the park (downstairs) for the balcony of the Cheesecake Factory that overlooks the park. After that, it was all over.\n\nWhen I reached reception upstairs, they practically ignored me before taking my name. About 5 minutes later, I was seated outside. I was attended by a server and a trainee server. I ordered pasta and salmon. I was waiting quite a while (enough so they came out to apologize). The pasta was obviously ready long before the salmon because when I received the pasta, it looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamps for about 15 minutes... the pasta was hard. The server didn't notice or chose to ignore it when she brought it out, so I had to send it back. They didn't cook a new batch, because when I received it the second time, there were some overcooked pasta tips hiding in the middle of the dish.\n\nAnother disappointing aspect was the music on the balcony. There was a live band playing in the park, but CF still chose to play cheesy pop music out on the deck. Overall, a terrible experience not worthy of the CF name. Needless to say, I won't be back to this location.", "author": "Angelina T."}

She said she had too many large parties and wouldn't be able to accommodate us.  This was a 6th annual trip for my friend and I and our 6 kids.  This has always been such a tradition for us to make a day trip to San Francisco at Christmas time.  And having dinner at the Cheesecake Factory is one of the most important parts of this tradition!  When we thought we were going to have to change that after 6 years, it was very upsetting.  I think Amy could tell how upset we were and asked us to give her a minute to see what she could do.  There were so many people trying to get a table at one of the busiest places in SF at this time of year.  She came back to us and gave us an estimate wait time of an hour and a half and handed us a pager.  We were so relieved to be able to continue our tradition!  Amy even came and checked on us towards the end of our dinner.  She was SO amazing and we are so grateful for her amazing customer service.  She truly helped to make our annual trip one of the best yet.  Thank you Amy!!!", "author": "Angie W."}

The wait is disgusting but you just have to go at the right time and also find things to do within that wait time. That shouldn't be a problem though, considering Macy*s is right below you and there is a Starbucks a few floors down. \n\nI've had a number of birthday gatherings here too. If you go for lunch, have everyone arrive promptly and plan ahead. No reservations, so don't try calling ahead. They'll just tell you to come down and pick up a pager like everyone else and wait your turn.\n\nFoodwise, the portions are gargantuan! When ordering, please save room for cheesecake, if that is your intention for coming to the establishment. Lunch portions are also above average. A wide range of appetizers are available and seasonal lunch specials (more like snacks) are also on a separate insert or sometimes on the table. If you hate waiting for food, have no fear. The bread is to die for! For most people I know, they love the \"brown bread\"/whole wheat bread. It's delicious and has a touch of sweetness that hits the right notes in your mouth. The sourdough is also noteworthy but a bit on the rigid side, typical though. \n\nI used to always get the farfalle with chicken pasta but I got tired of it. I still stick with the pastas though since I can't go wrong with them. When in doubt, order a salad or pasta. \n\nBurgers are more than a handful and mouthful! I remember the day I got my braces, I came straight to The Cheesecake Factory to eat with my grandma. Just biting down on the bun hurt like a mother! \n\nMy favorite cheesecake is Stephanie's ultimate red velvet. It's extremely high in calories, sugars, and oils but if that doesn't matter to you, try it! I've also had the key lime cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake (delicious!), and others. \n\nThere are occasional promotions throughout the year and I've took advantage of several of them. Most recently was the \"every $30 spent = 1 slice of free cheesecake\". Another was national cheesecake day. And plenty others. I'm glad that those happen because it's not a cheap place to dine. Just the frozen iced mango I get every time amounts to $5 or so and it's the same volume as a Power size at Jamba Juice. I don't think reviews can do the place justice.

But the tiramisu was delicious, rich, and pleasing. \n\nDowngrade 2 stars for the ridiculously long wait and poor service regarding our tables. Came in with a party of 11 and we got split into two booth tables, so our whole party couldn't even converse with each other. Half of our party even came into the city an hour earlier to snag a table, but the total wait was still around 2 hrs. I guess that was still better than waiting 3 hours for a big table. \n\nFood: I want to say that it's on par with Chili's and other chain restaurants. I got the Smokehouse BBQ burger (medium-rare). It came with onion rings and fries. The fries were nice and crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside. The onion rings were actually stacked within the burger, but I just pulled them aside to eat separately. And the burger was HUGE. I ate half of everything and saved the rest for lunch the next day. \n\nPrice: A bit on the expensive side, which is expected from eating out in SF. What was NOT expected was that they still charged us a  18% gratuity for our party even though we split the bills between our two tables. \n\nService: Our waiter seemed curt and too much in a rush. He also insisted my friend order a different dish, because my friend's original choice \"is not as good.\" Who says that to patrons? But our replacement waiter (Stevie) was wonderful and always refilled our water and brought us lots of bread and butter. \n\nI don't think I'll come here again with a big group of ppl.

The pager is supposed to work in the Macy's building but for some reason, ours did not.\n\nWe got seated around 9 pm and the hostess led us to our seats. It was a clear night in San Francisco so the view was gorgeous and made for many picture opportunities. \n\nOur server was very sweet and came out with the breads (the white and brown chocolate tasting one) and our waters. We started off with the avocado eggrolls and calamari. We also ordered a bowl of clam chowder and the fry station was backed up so our waiter gave us another bowl of clam chowder on the house.

I must have had a piece of a clam or two in each bite!\n\nMy family ordered the chicken alfredo, chicken madera, petite filet mignon, skinny turkey burger and salad and chicken bellagio. \n\nI personally had the Chicken Madera with chicken, mushrooms, mashed potatoes and asparagus.

Surprisingly, I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before, even though I have lived in San Francisco all of my life. We went there right when it opened, at 11am, so we were seated right away. The hostess tried to seat us at a table, but I asked if we could sit at a booth so we could have a view, and she let us. \n\nDRINKS: I got the strawberry lemonade and hubby got the raspberry lemonade. The strawberry was wonderful, but also VERY sweet, so you have to like that sort of the thing. The raspberry was less sweet, but in our opinion, not as good, so when we got refills, hubby changed his order for the strawberry. The glass also comes with a sugar rim.\n\nAPPETIZER: We got the crabcakes. So yummy! It comes with 3 small sized crab cakes and it's served with a tartar sauce and a mustard dipping sauce, which were both tastey. You also get the complimentary bread at the table. I think it was brown bread and french bread, and it is served with room temperature butter. Both were good.\n\nENTREES: Hubby got the filet mignon, which was a great portion, tender, very juicy, and had great flavor. The menu says it comes with french fries and onion rings, but it was mostly french fries and only two onion rings. The onion rings were okay, and the french fries were really good. I got the bistro pasta which was AWESOME! It is spaghetti pasta with crispy, battered shrimp, arugala, mushrooms, and tomatoes in a rich cream sauce. Then they top it off with freshly grated parmesan cheese to your liking. Ohhhh... my mouth is watering just thinking about it! I gave hubby some of my dish, and he said he was jealous and wished he ordered the same thing. We definately found a new favorite!\n\nDESSERT: We were picking up my birthday cake to have with a bunch of family later that evening. The 7 inch cheesecake wasn't going to be big enough for everyone we were having over, so we considered getting the 10 inch. When we dicovered that the price of the 10 inch was pretty much double the price of the 7 inch, for (HELLO!) only 3 extra inches, we opted to get two 7 inches instead. That way we could try two different kinds and get way more for the price. We got the Godiva chocolate and the Snickers cheesecakes. Both were delicious, but I am such a chocoholic, I thought the Godiva was just divine, and definately better!\n\nOur waiter was very nice too, and was very patient when hubby and I were taking forever to decide which cheesecakes we were getting. The only down side is that when we decided, he took forever to bring them out to us so we could go. It was worth it for the great experience we had!", "author": "Stephanie K."}

These were surprisingly healthy (ignore the fact they're deep fried), and the mix of avocado/tomato/onions (more like very chunky guacamole) was incredible. Even though there was no meat, these egg rolls were very filling. The Egg Rolls also come with a tamarind peanut dipping sauce - a must try with the egg rolls!\n\nEven though the wait can be long for seating (at one point people were waiting for indoor tables for 2 hours, but we chose outdoor seating where the wait time was 30 minutes), the cheesecake is definitely worth the wait.

I wonder if that thing is baked with crack because seriously, that cheesecake is DELICIOUS.  Not too cheesey, not too heavy, and not too sweet, it really is THE best cheesecake I've tasted..in my life...ever.  I know I have a problem - I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that today was my THIRD DAY IN A ROW of heading downtown just to order that slice of heaven (was talking to the counter guy yesterday, who said they're under contract to offer the Red Velvet Cheesecake for at least a year), but it is so worth it (I feel like Rachel and Chandler on Friends.  Anyone else catch that episode?).\n\nIf I had to rate Cheesecake Factory itself (you know, minus the miraculous Red Velvet Cheesecake), I'd give it...a 3.5.  The wait, particularly at this location, is always outrageous, the food is so-so, and the service is hit or miss (on this past Thursday's visit, Danae was awesome - ask for her!!).  Apparently consistency is not key at this place.  To save yourself from all this, just order the Red Velvet Cheesecake to go.  You won't be disappointed!!\n\nP.S.  Twenty-five cents from each slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake sold is donated to Feeding America.\nP.P.S.  A serving size of Red Velvet Cheesecake is, um, 1500 calories (holy hell).

I had a perfectly bleeding medium rare Monterey burger with avocado. I've been on a real avocado kick lately, can you tell?!? \n\nLast but not least were the cheesecake. We were so stuffed, we took our cheesecakes to go. I enjoyed my luscious red velvet cheesecake for breakfast the next day. Nothing like a sugar rush to get your day going.\n\nThe reason for the 3 stars is the service. Though our waitress was on par for most of the night, she forgot to sing happy birthday to my friend! And it took this super kind lady from New Zealand who was sitting next to us to say to our waitress that she forgot about the birthday. Vicky from New Zealand was super nice...she look pictures of all three of us. I wish I had taken a picture with her too.\n\nAnyways, we'll be back here again eventually. I gave bestie a gift card to Cheesecake, so we're guaranteed to be back sometime.", "author": "Grace L."}

The fact that it takes around 2 hours to get a table, really kills your mood by the time you actually get seated. This dining experience is at most worth a one time deal. \n\nFood: Ordered some pasta dish, doesn't matter what it is, because it was so mediocre. My friend got some fried chicken with mashed potatoes, also sub par. And of course, for dessert, how could you dine at The Cheesecake Factory without ordering cheesecake right? So we got the limited holiday Pumpkin Cheesecake and that tasted pretty good. \n\nAmbiance: WAY TOO FREAKEN CROWDED. Everyone that worked there is way too busy to care about you. I completely understand that being so completely swamped has it's limitations, but don't you think a chain this big can afford to hire more people to offer better service to everyone instead of spreading all their workers super thin? The best seats are the ones on the balcony where you get to overlook union square. It really is a nice relaxing view after a long day of hustling and bustling around the city. \n\nPrice: SUPER SUPER expensive for NOT that great of food! That's all I've got to say. \n\nService: Decent for how busy they were. \n\nOverall: There's so much hype for this place, that I'm sure everyone would go try this place just for the heck of it. But after one dining experience here, I'm sure you'd all agree that the food, the service, the ambiance and the price is NOT going to draw you back!", "author": "Amiee H."}

Despite the wait being ridiculous (usually an hour during dinner rush, more or less) I honestly really like this particular Cheesecake Factory.  It's a busy place but the atmosphere isn't bad, service is decent, and the view is nice if you sit outside because it's right in the middle of downtown.  The long wait is mitigated by the fact that one floor down, it's the Macy's furniture floor, so go find a nice couch and take a break from all that walking around downtown you were probably doing.  This Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place to go if you're not feeling too uppity but still want something better than Applebees.  Also the best part is the ginormous portions; I'm a girl, I eat a lot but these portions are definitely quite sharable.  And don't forget the free bread, everybody loves free bread. I'm just going to make a quick list of what I think are the best dishes to order here.  \n\nEntrees:\nSpicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta\nCajun Jambalaya Pasta\nWasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna\nRoasted Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread\n\nSmall Plates/Appetizers:\nAhi Tartare\nFirecracker Salmon\n\n\nNothing's mindblowing but the food is pretty darn good and the amount you get for the price is definitely worth it.

The location sits on top of Macy's with a great few of the City and Union Square and even has some pretty good choices of food. \n\nIf you plan to have dinner here you've got to get in line really early; like most say, it can get really busy with the combination of tourists and locals who go to take in the view and dining. I personal had to wait 1 hour for my group of 7; but turn bad news into good news by heading around the mall or downstairs into Macy's (there's almost always a sale!). \n\nOur group ordered an array of appetizers because most of us weren't that hungry for a large meal so we all picked plates that appealed to us. The fried mac n cheese tastes the best when it is freshly brought to your table, otherwise it cools and loses a lot of taste and flavor quickly. The avacodo rolls were probably one of the top picks of the night, very well seasoned with great texture. Of all the places I've recently ordered sweet potato fries from, Cheesecake has got this recipe down; the combination of sweet and saltiness flavors just hits your pallet perfectly; the basket lasted maybe 10 minutes. We also ordered the buffalo wings, sliders, a side of normal fries and fried calamari, all which tasted good, but were nothing to really brag about. \n\nAs an entree, my gf and I shared the garlic pasta with chicken where we substituted angel hair instead of spaghetti; the dish smelled amazing! However, it seemed as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time because the top bits of shitake mushroom on our dish were more cooked than the ones underneath and the pasta seemed dry, perhaps because there was little sauce present in the dish. Still, both of us really enjoyed this dish and felt it was bold in flavor and taste. \n\nThe only true downside to the meal which unfortunately was a really big downer was that throughout the entire meal, it was almost impossible to get the attention of our waitress. Once we were seated it seemed as if we had another wait simply to get our orders of water. On multiple occasions we were forced to call another waiter over to order our drinks, our dinner and to get the check. Having struck out on all the important times to hit our table we saw the waiter from the table on the other side of the room more often than we saw her. \n\nLike any other busy restaurant, get there early and beat the crowd so you can enjoy the food and the view. I've been to this place 20+ times, which has got to show something; this restaurant usually has good food and good service; I guess everyone's entitled to their bad days right?

I liked it because their timing was right on, we waited around that time and we had to wait another 5 minutes to get seated.\n\nMy friend really wanted to eat outside, and I wasn`t so sure about it because of my fear of having birds fly over me, and I thought I was going to freeze that night because  the wind was picking up. What I didn`t know until I went outside was that they have those nice heater lamps around every table, and I didn`t see any birds at all.\n\nEverything else was great, the service was very friendly and attentive. All of the foods come in HUGE portions! Not joking! We ordered appetizers, entree's, and cheesecake, we ended up having to take most of the food home!\n\nIt`s definitely a nice place to go back to if you`re patient with waiting, no rush, because especially since this restaurant is in a popular spot located on the top of Macys, expect this place to always be BUSY!

I kind of wish it came with a different side though. \n\nMy loverman ordered the Herb Encrusted Salmon. It came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I have no idea whether or not it was good or not. Haha, I forgot to ask. My sister-in-law had the Boston Salad which looked amazing. I would've tried some had there not been meat all over it. She also ordered this salad from their new snack/small plates menu. It was some greens, goat cheese, and beets. She substituted the goat cheese with blue cheese. She kept raving about it. I hate beets and I'm allergic to mold so I question her tastes. My brother got the pasta carbonara which looked really oily but he said it was good.\n\nNone of us ordered dessert, much to my sister-in-laws surprise. She really wanted to order a cheesecake but since we all weren't ordering anything, she didn't either. \n\nMy brother paid for our lunch. It ended up being $69 total, including a $10 tip. I really enjoyed the lunch and thought the atmosphere was  great and appropriate for the occasion. We had a great waitress too. \n\nMinus one star because they don't post their nutrition information and because everyone knows all their food is a dieters nightmare.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

The food is still great and the staff are nice, even if they did get the order slightly wrong. However, the queuing thing was a bit of a joke today.

We still had to wait ten minutes to be seated on the terrace. Why? There were servers available. There was a full complement of kitchen staff (you can see them) so why did we have to wait?

Ice skating in union square, shopping at Macy's and dinner at Cheesecake Factory.\n\nThe instant you walk in, the ambiance changes completely.  It's like you're in another place and you hardly notice that it's in Macy's.  On top to be exact, as it has spectacular views of Union Square.  It's a must see, especially since it's Christmas time and all of the lights are up.  So gorgeous!\n\nWaits can be long so make reservations. \n\nStaff was great and our waiter was so nice.  He totally indulged all my wacky additions and subtractions to my salad.  Even though my order was wrong because of a misscommunication, he totally handled it well and brought me the corrected order right away.\n\nAmong the many complaints I have about Cheesecake Factory as a whole, I was really shocked to see that their menu no longer has the calorie counts on them.  Seeing their previous calorie counts made me not want to eat there but at least I knew what I was getting into.  Because I felt like I was going into ordering blind, I opted for a Grilled Chicken Salad W/ Mango (normally known as the Luau Salad?)  I was NOT happy with the portions of everything.  They give you ENORMOUS amounts of the fatty food but they are totally stingy with the healthy stuff.  The lettuce was plentiful but the mangoes were chopped up really finely so I probably was given only 2 tablespoons at the most.  I expected big chunks of mango.  It was actually more of a \"salsa\" which added a ton of flavor to the salad so it didn't need any dressing.  Same thing for the bell peppers.  Tiny portions.  The chicken was a little better but dry as all hell.  I can only assume that they cook it days before and freeze it, then thaw it out.  No flavor what-so-ever.  \n\nTheir menu is so overwhelming!  Make sure to take a look at the menu before you go so you aren't sitting there stressed about having to decide.\n\nThe appetizer was completely tasteless.  We ordered the mac and cheese and it was very bland.  Not impressed with it's flavor of the sauce it was in at all.\n\nMy husband's entree, a chicken pasta thing, wasn't good at all.  WAY too spicy, yet it lacked flavor.  Again, he got a huge plate that he only ate about 1/4 of, which is the correct serving for one person.  The rest is now sitting in our fridge, collecting mold.\n\nTheir wheat bread was good but they started giving the packets of butter.  I remember getting fresh butter not too long ago.\n\nI have also never been a fan of their cheesecake so dessert wasn't an option.  I once tried like 6 flavors and not one was good.  I totally had Goldilocks Syndrome.  Coconut was too sweet, chocolate was too dry, plain was too bland, strawberry was almost good but still not impressive.  For literally a Cheesecake Factory, I would expect that each cheesecake would be phenomenal but they always miss the bar.  I can only conjecture that they are not made fresh at the restaurant and are mass produced from a warehouse somewhere and delivered.  But I could be wrong.  It would explain the bland, been frozen too long taste.\n\nI think I may have just out grown these generic, corporate restaurants.  I like my food to be fresh, tasty and healthy.  You won't really find that here but it's a great place to meet up with people and have drinks after work or before a night out on the town.  Even then, there are hundreds of other restaurants that are actually good.", "author": "Victoria C."}

And no we were not, but some drinks would've been nice. This waiter did not ask if we would like anything to drink while waiting. Thumbs down. \n\nMy coworkers ordered the orange chicken, and pasta fettuccini. And I ordered the jambalaya pasta. Everyone was pretty satisfied with their food.

Seating options are indoor and outdoor.  There is usually a bit of a wait for a table depending on the time, you can call in advance to reserve.  Otherwise, you could end up waiting anywhere from 10-20 minutes.\n\nI personally prefer to sit indoors due to my paranoia of birds and bird droppings.  If the normally overcast sky of San Francisco is clear, this is a good outdoor dining area that will also give you a good view of the city.\n\nThe food quality is pretty good.  Good ingredients, prepared well.  The style of food here is varied but does not stray too far from classic recipes.  There are traditional American dishes on the menu like Burgers, Meatloaf, Rotisserie Chicken, etc things that you would expect to see on a 'chain restaurant' menu but you will also see things like Fish Taco's,  Orange Chicken and Sheppards Pie on the menu.  The portions are HUGE!  I'm talking fat American size portions.  They do offer something they call \"lunch size\" portions on some of the dishes but most of them are way too big to finish in one sitting.  They have a full bar on one side of the restaurant.\n\nPrices are reasonable considering the amount of food.

I had the chicken bellagio which sounded oh so delicious with its crusted chicken on top of Basil pasta with a cheese cream sauce. The first bite was good but a little bit disappointing. The chicken and pasta had 2 things in common: both were very flavorful but overly salty and dry. The pasta was also a bit undercooked, thus not too soft to the bite. Food was 3 stars. What pushed it over for 4 stars was the gorgeous sunny day with outdoor seating, a fantastic 8th floor view of union square and the best date that was smart enough to make a reservation so that we didn't have to wait! Next time, i should just skip  lunch and ordered dessert like i wanted to in the first place!", "author": "Stella Y."}

Try saying that one five times fast!\n\nThe decor in this place is pretty amazing, and I hope I have more time to eat in next time I'm in the area. But it was a treat simply to sneak a peek into this infamously busy dessert heaven.\n\nMy slice was ready to go in a flash and topped off with whipped cream on the side. (Not being a fan of whipped cream, this was awesome. I simply hate when the cream is added right on top without my asking!)\n\nI took my cake to the square out front of Macy's and dug in. Chocolate cake inside of peanut butter cheesecake? I could have died. And in fact, I almost did when I couldn't even finish the damn thing.

It's just like any other Cheesecake Factory- but there is a pretty amazing balcony with gorgeous views of San Francisco. If you end up in the city on a bright and sunny day and find yourself in Union Square I definitely recommend it. Also if you're finished with a day full of shopping come in for a nice hot spiked drink and watch the ice skaters and all the gorgeous christmas lights!\n\nThe portions.. are.. HUGE. even when I order a \"lunch\" portion which is supposed to be significantly smaller, I still take home half of it. \n\nI've had pretty much everything here. Usually my girls and I order a TON of apps and share a huge salad.\nThe road side sliders are a great way to start off. The fried macaroni and cheese is pretty good but in my opinion a bit salty..? Southern fried chicken sliders are yummy and have a small kick (paprika?) that I love! The sweet corn tamale cakes are actually fairly decent for the size and yummy. The samosas.. yeh I've had better. Crabcakes- stfu. So yummy. I have never met a crabcake I didnt like..\n\nLast time I was here I had the fish tacos. SO EFFING AMAZING. I wanna say it was around $13 and I got 4 huge delicious tacos filled with veggies and avocado. UGH. I died. I like every salad minus the iceburg salad (who seriously wants to pay $12 for a head of lettuce?) and their mixed drinks are delicious.\n\nIn the past 8 years I've dined at any Cheesecake Factory I've yet to have any of their cheesecake...

Both plates were huge! We have never seen such a big portion for chicken bites and a big scoop of fresh mashed potatoes and corn came on the side.  The burger also came with a huge serving of fries.  We had to order the cheesecake of course and the pecan caramel chocolate cheesecake was undeniably rich decadent and delicious.

Get your name put on the list. Go down, go out, get back in your car. Drive to the Cheesecake Factory (tm) restaurant in Corte Madera, Marin County.  Park, walk in, sit, order, drink, leisurely Eat 'til you burst. Do NOT have dessert!  NOW, Get back in your car, drive back to Union square, park.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-10-17", "description": "This location has always been a giant clusterF of waiting and crowds when walking in for a table inside. Once you've sat down though it used to get better. At least you'd get big portions and servers for the most part are professional and cordial. Nope not this time.\n\nAfter an hour long wait, we are finally seated at a table for two. which is very narrowly separated from the other tables to either side. Everything is pretty normal until we get our food and I notice that our server keeps squeezing herself in between our table and the table next to us to talk to the customer closer... it's a narrow space and although she is thin, she barely fits in there and is bumping our table and even accidentally steps on my foot, to which she apologizes. No big deal, I'm not a prude so whatever.\n\nWe finish up and while waiting for dessert, again she squeezes in but this time she bumps our table hard enough and as she turns she actually knocks my drink down towards me ... right into my lap. Great. Sprite in the pants. Again, not a huge deal. She's clearly flustered and mentions there's a bathroom behind me if I'd like to clean up.\n\nI wash up and get what sticky soda off my pants and out of my naughty bits that I can. I come back to see they've done a quick wipe of the table but my feet are still in a puddle of soda on the floor. Sigh... accident waiting to happen again right there but that's going to be their problem. \n\nI think to myself that our cheesecake still hasn't come and if they had an inkling of good customer service, they'd just comp it. Our server drops off a replacement drink to me, without an apology or even a word of acknowledgement and proceeds to talk to the customers next to us. Ok.... Later when our cheesecake arrives, she's squeezed in on the other side (haven't you learned your lesson?) and she actually places it on our table while facing away from us, again not saying anything. Seriously? Why do I feel like the asshole here? I have to get her attention to ask for our bill. When I get it, nothing is discounted. I want to be clear that I'm not giving such a bad review for not being discounted or freebies. I'm not even giving a bad review for her spilling my drink on me.

Since we were all coming from different locations and meeting up at the restaurant the wait for our table really wasn't too bad.  I can not ever recall when this restaurant was not busy; the reception/waiting area was packed as usual.\n\nA server took us to our corner table, loaded us up with fresh bread and ice water then told us that the regular waiter was on break, and we would see him shortly.  The warm, soft breads were very good and another server returned to refill our water glasses at least twice while we waited for our waiter.  Our waiter finally appeared.  He apologized for the wait and spoke quickly in announcing the evening's special and the soup.  So quickly in fact that only half of our party caught what he had actually said ... \"a fresh salmon\" something, something \"served with French fries and broccoli and our soup is broccoli cheese\".  With that he told us he would let us look at the menu and return shortly to take our drink orders, and he disappeared again.  We had already waited so long that many of us had already memorized the catalog-sized menu.\n\nMeanwhile the young lady with the pitcher of ice water returned yet again to refill our glasses.  This routine was getting to be pretty comical.  Finally our waiter returned, cheerful as ever and asked if we were ready to order our drinks.  Several members of our party suggested he take the entree orders also, and our waiter seemed quite surprised that we were ready to do both tasks simultaneously.  He took our orders, quite carefully in fact, jotting down each little detail as a couple of members from our party were meticulous about what they wanted in their drink and/or on their entree.  \n\nThe wait for our drinks took forever, and our waiter returned with a pitcher of ice water to refill our glasses.  He apologized for the wait and even brought us two more baskets of the fresh baked bread.  A short time later our drinks finally arrived, and we finally got a chance to make a toast to a successful Icer Air event and all of the different accomplishments related to that event.  \n\nOnly one member of our party ordered salad to go with his dinner, and it arrived shortly after the drinks arrived.  The rest of us sat back and noticed the gargantuan portion of salad on his plate which he devoured quickly.  No sooner had he set down his fork when an army of four or five different servers brought out our entrees.  Every plate looked massive in proportion and delicious in presentation.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Madeira which is two pieces of chicken breast topped with soft and gooey mozzarella cheese and covered in a slightly sweetened brown sauce with big chunks of mushrooms and whole spears of fresh asparagus.  I believe it is a single chicken breast cut into two halves.  The chicken was quite moist and the sauce was flavorful.  This came with a gigantic scoop of red-skinned mashed potatoes that was so incredibly large I had trouble finishing it.\n\nAs our waiter returned to remove each half-eaten plate from our table we contemplated whether or not to order dessert.  Six of our party did so ordering a variety of cheesecake slices from the plain Original to the Fresh Strawberry, the Key Lime, the White Chocolate Caramel Latte and the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple.  Although each slice was passed around the table I didn't sample any of the other selections, but my strawberry cheesecake was rich and delicious, an original slice of cheesecake with several fresh strawberries and sweet glaze.  Two dollops of plain whipped cream accompanied each cheesecake slice.  The only thing missing was a cup of hot tea or hot coffee.  Neither was offered.\n\nThe overall service is spotty and not consistent at all times, and the restaurant is continuously busy, but the tasty food is served hot often on heated plates and the desserts are rich and decadent.  You probably won't find me eating here too often, but I think our overall experience deserves at least 3.5 stars.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

I asked for medium rare and it looked and tasted just right. The flavors were original, interesting, and delicious. I devoured it in between bites of sweet potato fries which were awesomely crunchy.

The salad dressings are the bomb. The bread is good- warm soft crunchy. I ordered from the snack part of the menu that i never seen before which was perfect for the evening after a day of shopping! A little house salad that was not \"small\" but just the perfect amount and a margherita pizzette which was delicious as well. The meal only costed me less than ten dollars and I had leftovers as well!  I didn't get a chance to get the cheesecake tonight but I love the red velvet the most! \n\nThis place looks formal but is really a place i can eat at everyvnight. There is a big menu that I can live off of! Bring your date, your friends, and your family!", "author": "Victoria L."}

It was a little too much after 2 pieces.  My friends' food was awesome though.  I didn't get a good view because we were sitting inside but the place that made this a 4 for me was our waitress (Tiffany hooked it up with the bread and was always super attentive to us).  \n\nIf you want to eat at this Cheesecake, make sure to check in and get your name down first because the wait is likely to be 1-2 hours (also be sure to request outside seating).  Then just go shopping, do whatever and come back when the time is rizight.  Then you shall be a happy camper (and not feel like a hungry psycho)", "author": "Christine B."}

After a long day of shopping in the city my friends and I were exhausted and hungry so we decided to eat at Cheesecake Factory because it was the shortest distance of walking. The wait was awful and there was no waiting area to sit in. \n\nAs we were seated we proceeded to wait to be served water and bread. Our food didn't take too long to come out. I asked for a refill on my water so the waiter took my cup. I waited around for several minutes and saw him walk by me with my cup of water and placed it on someone elses table! The other customer clearly did not need a refill because they had two filled cups of water that had not been consumed. I was able to recognize my cup because of the straw that I was using had my chapstick on it! As he walked by my table I asked him again for my cup of water and he said \"Oh, I'm sorry, I will get it now\" as if he wasn't aware that he just placed my cup of water on someone elses table. The poor guy with my cup of water actually didn't realize it and drank my cup of water. The waiter gave me a cup of water with a new straw and failed to mention the mix up. \n\nThis is why I will never come back to this place. Bad experience.", "author": "Amy T."}

I can't help but always think about the Big Bang Theory when I go eat there. Also, for LOTR fans out there, the thin column looking pieces in between tables seem to resemble the tower of Sauron. All geekiness aside, let's get down to the reason why I only gave this place 3 stars when I said how much I love the food. One word: Tourists. Because this place happens to be smack dab in the middle of tourist central, the restaurant is constantly busy and extremely over packed by people. Do expect to wait 30 to an 1hr for a table. The restaurant is located at the top of Macy's, so if you do get a seat outside, you'll get a great view of Union Square. It's unfortunate that I have to get the place 3 stars, but I'm not a big fan of crowds and super long waits. Definitely go there and enjoy the food, though.", "author": "Eric M."}

I can't imagine anyone in US who lives by one of these chain locations and have never been to one.  So to make this short and sweet, I will assume (even though I shouldn't) that everyone knows the food and it's concept and move toward my straightforward experience.\n\nOur party got the following on the trip to San Francisco\n\nMarghareta Pizza:  Simple and tasty!  Can't be the good old traditional taste of Mozza cheese, basil, and tomato!\n\nThe Crunch Burger:  I think that's what's called on the menu.... humongous burger with fries....didn't taste it but looked really filling and tasty though\n\nCalamari:  I love the cheesecake factory calamari with the green sauce that they got...Very  yummy indeed!\n\nCajun Jamalaya Pasta:  Full cajun flavor with lots of spices but was a bit on the salty side... slightly disappointing how salty it was compared to the one served by my neck of the woods.  Can't expect the exact taste I guess.\n\nFactory Meat Loaf:  Large portions of tasty meatloaf, (something I don't usually get), with Corn and veggies on the side (special request for steam veggies is available!)  Actually terrific meat loaf and would definitely get it again.\n\nFinally, got the fresh strawberry cheesecake...General consensus:  TOO SWEET!!!  All the cheesecakes offered here are good but is on the sweet side, so I guess no one in my party really enjoyed sugar \"that much\" so it wasn't anything to brag about....\n\nThe location was awesome...On top of the Macy building (8th floor) and was seated outside on the patio overlooking UNION SQUARE.  Loved the view and really enjoyed this meal for this reason....Good thing the wait was ok as we got there little earlier and it was on a weekday, otherwise, I can see it being a pain waiting for a table there.. it finally got way too crowded when we were about to leave, so best go early if possible.\n\nWaiter was friendly and overall service was the typical Cheesecake Factory performance.  There was a special waiter who was slightly annoying though... he/she kept wanting my meat loaf!!!  Literally!!!\n\nThe waiter was this huge seagull... sitting on the ledge... serving me personally......staring at my food....................for about 15 minutes!!!!!!!!!", "author": "Henry C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-07-27", "description": "Aside from the ridiculously long wait time, there are three things that bother me about the Cheesecake Factory in SF:\n\n1) The menu is like a Macy's catalog. How can you focus on the gazillion choices of food when you are distracted by the advertisements? Who wants to get sliders when there's a 2 carat ring blinging in your eye? Why salivate over chicken madeira when you can drool over a man in a 3 piece suit? And why even think of dessert when designer purses serve as eye candy? I don't know any other restaurant that sells ad space in their menus. It's quite distracting. Effective? To a certain degree. Annoying? Yes.\n\n2) I don't like pigeons pecking at my toes or swooping down to snag bread and bite size pieces off of my plate. Are the Alfred Hitchcock moments worth the breathtaking view from the top of the Macy's building looking down onto the square? Yes.\n\n3) As cute and cuddly as those beanie babies were in the nineties, the nineties are over!! I don't want to stare at beanie babies when I ogle the cheesecake counter.\n\nWhat I do like about the Cheesecake Factory is the appetizer favorites. It's got the best of everything on 4 plates. They may have bumped up the price but it's still worth it if you are sharing it for a meal. As for the cheesecake, it's good (you can also get a cheesecake sampler from Costco on the cheap) and they have every flavor imaginable. I like their cheesecake but i will always gravitate towards the caramel apple dumpling before getting my own 5 lb slice of fat.", "author": "Rachel A."}

Must really like this place, because before we started living healthier, we took a bimonthly pilgrimage. \n\nNo reservations here, so for a no-stress experience, just be at the Macy's elevator or the top-floor escalator right at opening at 11am (or 10am on Sundays).  Convenient parking garage across the street.  \n\nIf outside, get a table by the edge near an outdoor heater. If inside, insist on a booth by the window and they'll give it to you.  If you're with children and you don't insist, you'll likely be placed in an interior round booth with none of the spectacular downtown view.  \n\nFor kids: Ask for the free kids' plate when waiter first comes - they'll bring them an oval dish with banana and bread slices.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-22", "description": "My ex-girlfriend LOVED this place. The food is pretty damn good considering its price. 20 dollars will get you the Steak Diane. Filet medallions with some sort of gravy with shitake mushrooms with some mega soft mashed potatoes. For the same price, you can lessen the steak portion and add a 6- something ounce salmon filet. The salmon is rubbed in herbs and is slightly undercooked which i find to be a glaring strong point in fish.\n\nTwo drawbacks. Service and wait-time. Even on a monday afternoon around 2-3 you will find yourself waiting 20 minutes for a table, and on  weekends? You'll be lucky to wait less than an hour and a half. Worth the wait? Maybe if you are visiting out of town. \n\nAs for the service? similar to hard rock cafes. Hardcore corporate. The service staff is very friendly, but i sense that they feel over worked and that they are under a lot of stress due to the  management and corporate. I have attended this particular Cheesecake the better part of a dozen times, and only once have i had a personable conversation with a server. For the most part, they walk around with a corporate smile, and give corporate service. I feel so bad for them!

Though not as good as that one this place is well worth your visit and for sure ask for patio seating on a nice day so you can enjoy the wonderful view of Union Square.  We only had to wait for 20 minutes for our table and the service was fairly quick.  They worked hard to correct an error with our meal so no loss of stars there as errors happen and they went beyond in making sure we were taken care of.  We'll visit here again hoping for a repeat of this visit as we really did enjoy the view, food, which they provide rather large portions, and the service.  Good job Cheesecake Factory and wonderful location.  \n\nOne tip I would have for others is use the escalators to bypass the line waiting for the one small elevator.

We ate there the day after Christmas so it was extremely busy. Our wait time was 1.5 to 2 hours for a table of 4 so if you plan on eating there, reserve ahead of time! (Just a heads up: they do not accept reservations over the phone. You have to reserve your table in person.) It wasn't a big deal to me because the restaurant is located basically in Macy's so we spent our wait time shopping! \nCustomer service is really good and the food was really good too! All the portions are huge though so if you don't like to eat too much, I would recommend sharing your meal with someone. All the dishes are pretty expensive but I believe it was worth it! :D\nIf you go in the winter time, I suggest that you try outdoor seating. We opted out of it because we thought it was going to be too cold. However, they have heat lamps outside and it was not even one bit cold! If you reserve for outdoor seating, your wait time might be shorter too. The view is AMAZING as well; you get to see the entire Union Square. During the winter time, it is beautiful with all the lights! Even if you eat indoors, after your meal you should go outside to look at the view.

They give amazing recommendations and are very familiar with the dishes. They also check up on you often to see if you need anything. \nI've had the four-cheese pasta, mac and cheese burger, and several appetizers such as buffalo wings and of course a cheesecake for dessert. \nIf you're coming here just for the cheesecake, I wouldn't recommend it.The cheesecake is definitely good here, but there's better. On the plus side, they have a large variety of cheesecakes, so you are bound to find something you like. \nThe food is definitely well cooked, always served hot and well plated. The outside seating on the balcony is amazing at night and they do have heating vents to keep you warm. \nI would say this place is more casual, not something you would have to dress up for.  I love the white-chocolate raspberry cheesecake and the white-chocolate chip one. One slice can definitely be split among two people. From all my past experiences I've never finished a whole slice with another person. We were all left full from the large portions of our main dishes + appetizers. \nSkip the salads, they are very average and unless you find it a necessity I would pass this one up.

I wasn't hungry today so I just ordered their basic eggs dish which is surprisingly cheap (6.95).  Be forewarned that they only serve poached eggs on Sundays because that is when they have the egg poaching machine on.  I was hoping for roasted tomatoes to go with my egg dish but if you choose tomatoes instead of potatoes, you get three large slices of raw tomato.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-04", "description": "Okay...I'll start off by saying that chain restaurants are usually not my thing.  They usually have predictable menus and pretty bland food and people who don't really want to work there. What Cheesecake Factory does that is so different from everyone else is that they try to please everybody, which is perfect for families.  Anyone who's seen their menu notices the 30-40 different entree's available to order - considering they also go across a range of cuisine from Native American, to Thai, to Mexican, to Italian, they do a decent job of making everything taste pretty good.  \n\nWhat they really excel at, however, are the burgers and salads - they give you huge portions and they make everything taste so impressive. The burgers come in a range of choices, but no matter which one is ordered, they are all juicy and full of flavor (the kobe beef is impressive!).  The salads are great since they give you a hefty portion of something that usually doesn't fill you up very well.  Salads such as the BBQ chicken or Chinese chicken are full of flavor and very healthy - it's a great way to eat out, have a good, flavorful meal, but not worry about too many calories/fat in your diet.\n\nOf course, the best things at Cheesecake Factory are the cheesecakes - absolutely amazing!  Whether you like fruit, chocolate or coffee, they have something for everyone.  They even have good desserts that aren't cheesecakes.  My personal favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake - a flourless dark chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, chocolate cheesecake and a dark chocolate ganache - how can you not like this?!?!?\n\nIn short, I'm strangely impressed by this place...my advice is to stick to the following:\n\n-Salads\n-Burgers\n-Cheesecake\n\nAnything outside of these items can be hit or miss.\n\nBTW, try to plan accordingly when you go...there's ALWAYS at least a 45 minute wait to get in.", "author": "Ken G."}

Actually, my server changed three times during the course of my meal, so if they were around I probably didn't realize it.

He was just so kind and really sincerely felt like he cared about our well being not like other servers who just suck up. Therefore we gave him a 30% tip and our phone numbers. Yup. That's how good he was.\n\nCouple negatives are: the location. Yeah it's on top of Macy's and you get to see the view of Union Square from outside but when you think about it, the elevator wait & the escalator inconveniently placed in the middle of all the madness is just stupid. I give this place 4 stars cause of that and the ridiculous long waits.

I actually prefer the outdoor seating, because the lighting in the regular dining area is a tiny bit too dim for me.\n\nThey give you bread at the beginning of the meal and by far the dark colored bread, which I call \"chocolate bread\", is far superior to the sourdough stuff it comes with it.  It's especially good if it's still warm, and I usually ask for an extra helping of that.  When you open the menu and scan through their choices, I'm telling you now.  The food is above average.  That goes for everything on the menu.  It's good, but doesn't have a \"Wow\" factor.  So it doesn't matter what you get.  It's going to be above average.  I've ordered their meat loaf the most and I get the \"you ordered that at Cheesecake Factory?\" question a lot.  I can't help it; I like meatloaf.  I like the fact they serve their breakfast menu all day.  \n\nCheesecake Factory visit is never finished without a slice of cheesecake.  I'm a fan of cheesecake and it's hard for anywhere to beat the choices they have on their cheesecake list.  I'm a simple guy, so I usually tend to get the regular one.  The tiramisu and the carrot cake ones are my other favorites.  \n\nThe biggest pro is the view and their different kind of cheesecakes.  Unfortunately, I'm giving this Cheesecake Factory location 3 stars due to the wait time.  There are just too many choices in that area to justify waiting that long to eat here.  If it wasn't for hand-held devices and smart phones, I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't wait that long.", "author": "Arnold T."}

Any other pasta dish or salad entree is a flat-out ripoff (yeah, I said it!)\n\nCF's glorified Double-Double, or \"TONS OF FUN BURGER\" as they call here, was more than enough to hold me over for the 4-hour+ shopping spree my family & i had in Union Square. Sitting on top of Macy complex, you get a great view of the square off the restaurant's terrace. Hosts/Hostesses at the front desk were very accommodating for our party of 18, not to mention a very friendly & quick-service waitress. Amber, I think was her name; she had a lot of cheerleader qualities from what I remember, but who remembers their server's name anyway? Nevertheless, the cheeriness made the dining experience much more entertaining for the kids' table.\n\nParents took care of the bill which left our wallets untouched for the shops on Powell and Post.\nGreat day.

Our server Isaac T. took our orders, brought drinks and bread and then some 35 minutes later told us our order would be arriving soon.  Someone else brought our order.  We never saw Isaac again, no one came over.  We had to ask a busboy to clear our table.  Isaac reappeared and don't know what we were thinking, but ordered a piece of cheesecake and asked Isaac for the check.  The check arrived and my husband then had to find someone to take our payment.  My husband asked \"where was our server\" and the reply, \"he went out to eat\". No one came to tell us he was on a break, which must have lasted the whole one hour and 20 minutes that we were left to fend for ourselves.  My husband called after we left and spoke to the Manager, Mark, who said \"SF law provides breaks for employees\". But wouldn't common courtesy be nice if someone told us the server was on break and have someone cover in his absence.  Apparently, not the case at Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco.

This particular Cheesecake Factory is at the top of the Union Square Macy's. Definitely full of tourists, meaning the line is ridiculous. My party of 7 had to wait more than an hour! But anyway, once we were seated, our waitress was kind of not there. No matter at this point, since we had more time to look over the menu to be sure of what we wanted.\n\nMy group that I went with loves appetizers. So, we ordered a bunch of them:\n * buffalo wings\n* sliders\n* normal fries\n* fried calamari\n* fried mac and cheese\n* avocado rolls\n* sweet potato fries.\n\nDo you see a trend here? All of these appetizers were FRIED, except for one. Talk about high caloric intake. To me, all the appetizers besides the sweet potato fries and avocado rolls were good. Everything else was just mediocre. The one thing I have to complain about is that when we were finished with more than half the calamari, my brother's girlfriend found a hair fried up in one of the calamaris. We showed our waitress and the only thing she offered was to make us another one. Didn't offer to take it off our bill - look at our table! We have enough appetizers, we don't want any more especially if there's a chance there could be more hairs in there.\n\nWhen the entrees came, the meal only became worse. All of our entrees looked dry as if they were sitting under the heat lamp for an extended period of time. Even if we had a lot of appetizers and needed some time to finish, I don't think that was the issue. Our watress was seriously just a ghost. She would pop in every 20 minutes or so. After most of our appetizers were taken away, we still waited about 15 minutes before our entrees came out. Most likely there were ready and were just sitting in the window for 15 minutes while our waitress took her time to get our food. \n\nI understand that Cheesecake Factory is popular and has a high throughput of people dining there - however, since the restaurant knows this, they would equip staff who knew how to manage their time better. It also didn't help that the waitress was not very helpful when it came to understanding my mom's english. My mom came to the US when she was 20, of course her English isn't perfect, but it's better than a lot of tourists who dine there! Our waitress should have been more accomodating and patient when taking our orders. \n\nI could rant on and on and list the entrees we ordered, but I won't bother. Definitely NOT coming back here. Too much of a hassle.", "author": "Julia K."}

However, this time I was not impressed.  This was about 2 weeks ago on a Friday night.  We came here for a post-movie midnight snack.  We were seated about 40 minutes before closing time, which most likely explained the rushed service we got.  I almost slipped twice walking to our table and walking from our table to the restroom.  The restroom was gross.  Open toilet paper rolls were literally sitting on the floor. Yuck.  \n\nWe ordered the thai chicken wrap, which was surprising flavorful and tender.  The mini corndogs were bleh...I wouldn't be surprised if they were the frozen ones sold at Costco.

It was super busy, but we got seated within 30 min. after being told it was a 45 min. wait. We both order our drinks first. I'm on the verge of coming down with a cold....again....and needed something for my sore throat. Their cocktail menu listed a cocktail called Kentucky Tea (Wid Turkey whiskey, honey, and lemon) and it sounded just what I needed for this on-coming cold. We both were expecting the drinks to be in highball glasses, but they weren't. They were in these tall cocktail glasses (frou-frou drinks), but that was okay. It was yummy, but only kept it to one drink for me while my friend ordered another when she was done with hers. \nSo it's been a long time since I've been to the Cheesecake Factory to eat and  I know why. Not because the food is bad, but this location attracts a lot of tourists. Yeah, well, we were starving and didn't want to eat mall food or trek a long way, so opted for here. We both had burgers. I ordered the Cajun Burger (medium) with the fries while my friend had the BLT burger with blue cheese (?) and fries. I hadn't had a burger since before Lent this year, so needless to say, I devoured mine. The fries were pretty tasty too! Crispy. Just the way I like 'em! If my friend didn't eat hers, I would've finished them off too. My Cajun burger had andouille sausage and sauteed onions and bell peppers. No cheese on this particular burger, but that was okay. I'm lactose =). Nonetheless, my burger was delish and finished before my friend who only ate half of her burger. Oh, my burger was also on a brioche bun, which made it perfect! \n\nFor a chain restaurant, I had a pretty good experience for having my first burger here. It's only the second time I've had lunch here and I can't remember what I had the first time I ate here years ago. Oh, and of course, we ordered cheesecakes. My fave, Khalua for me and banana cream for her...to go though. I'd come back here to try one of their other burgers, but maybe when tourist season dies down =). Note sure if I'd try any of the other entrees, but their burgers, yes!\n\nThree stars because they need more seating area where people can wait to be called when a table is ready.

We also were seated very promptly. This was surprising considering how busy it usually is.

The reason is simply that you can get about $30 worth of food for $15.  Portions are HUGE.  I eat like a man and I still need to share.\n\nThe downside to this: their food is quite heavy.  The saucy dishes definitely are more on the gravy-ish side.  I had an ahi tuna dish, which was lighter and easier to finish, but my friend managed to plow through only about 1/3 of her shepherd's pie and had to take the rest home.\n\nAnother downside: the wait.  Come in on a Friday night and you're looking at a 1.5 hr wait AT LEAST.  It doesn't matter how small your party is.  My friend pointed out to me that we could do takeout, which we did, and it was fantastic.\n\nAs for the cheesecakes, they come in many different flavours, and are quite flavourful and rich.  I'm not always in the mood for such a sweet dessert but when I am it hits the spot!  The vanilla bean cheesecake was tasty and probably a little lighter than the more chocolatey creations (although my universal favourite will always some kind of berry white chocolate cheesecake)\n\nI recommend for takeout mostly, or if you really love standing (you can also wander around macy's while you wait for a table, they give you a little buzzer thing).", "author": "Alison S."}

You stand in a line for 10 minutes to put your name in and they tell you it will be able 30-40 minutes and they page you or text you to let you know your table is ready. After they page you, you go up and fight through the same line to bring your slip of paper up there to \"check in\". Then you stand off to the side to wait another 30-40 minutes for your name to be called. I was joking around with people waiting who had also been paged and tried to keep a good sense of humor about it, but many of them were waiting 40+ minutes AFTER they had already been paged. I started noticing that people who were waiting with me went up to the servers to complain about their wait and soon after were seated. So eventually I had to go up again, like everyone else, to complain that I had been waiting for 35-40 minutes AFTER I had already been paged. The guy then misunderstood me thinking I had JUST shown up after missing my page, which REALLY made me mad. My sense of humor was gone at that point and I loudly explained that it was not the case. We were then finally seated five minutes later. \n\nI am writing this review waiting for my food.

First of all, the lady told us that it was going to be a 45 minute wait for a table seating outside on the rooftop. We were okay with that and they were going to text us when our table was ready because we were going to shop around union square while we wait. We came back 50 minutes later to check on our table and they told us it was going to be another 5-10 minute wait. We waited at the waiting room that they had for another hour. When my friend finally received the text that the table was ready, he went to go check in but another host was there. It was a young man with a tattoo on his arm who was giving my friend attitude saying he texted us 5 minutes ago and gave our table away. My friend barely received the text 2 minutes ago and they already decided to give our table away instead of walking around and calling our group. We were literally just a few steps away from them. It's not that hard to walk over and tell us our table is ready and how are you going to give away our table when you barely just texted us. What if we were shopping at a different store and recieved the text? That would have taken probably 10 minutes for us to arrive back at the Cheesecake Factory. In this case, we were already at the restaurant waiting so there was no need to give us attitude and give our table away. I don't understand what kind of service this location was giving, but it was totally unfair. We ended up hungrily waiting for 2hrs. We did not even receive an apology from him for his stupidity. I didn't get a chance to get his name. However, our waiter/server turned our day around. He was the only one who apologized and tried to make our evening better. It just shows how bad it is when the waiter has to apologize for the host. I am really disappointed with the service we received from the host during my visit.

I love cheesecake.  The first time the cheesecake was HEAVY, not rich enough, too sweet and like something you might get in the frozen section at any supermarket.  Probably because that's not too far from the truth.  \n\nThe second time I was brought a slice I accepted it because I was hungry and broke.  It wasn't even fun to eat, more of a chore.  It definitely wasn't worth the calories.\n\nIt's not horrible cheesecake, but after eating other cheesecakes in Berkeley in past years and of course at Zanze's it made the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake look pretty bad.  What a let-down.  Now I don't have a good impression of the Cheesecake Factory, my guess is they are more interested in giving you calories than you giving you great taste and quality.", "author": "Cynthia B."}

I'm not exaggerating every time I've been here nothing but rude service I can't stand it anymore. Last time my friend and I sat outside we were waiting there for 90 minutes (not exaggerating) we spoke to 4 waiters and the manager Chris and still no help. They don't care about the guests here at all. They are impatient and have no respect. They don't even hide how miserable they are with their facial expressions. And also they too their eyes at you and ignore you.

The night was dark, and I looked up at their lit sign to find the 'c' in 'Factory' was burnt out and it appeared to be called 'Cheesecake Fatory'\n\nAnd I should have heeded the sign's warning.\n\nAfter a day of stressful shopping on Black Friday, almost anything will please my appetite so I thought what the hell, I will try this place. The result was mediocre food in which each bite was probably 100 calories, and there were many bites. \n\nThe service was pretty good actually considering the circumstances. After getting rained on outside our server personally made sure we got to a seat inside as quickly as possible without being unaccounted for. I then resumed my 100-calorie bites and promptly passed out from salt overload when I got home.", "author": "Ryan V."}

It was served cut in half (!?) in a baguette-like piece of bread (I am assuming it was the way it was meant to be, but if that was the case, why changing something that worked fine?); the cheese was not completely melted, and the bread felt like if it was from the day before.

The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places. I ate there this week to celebrate the birthday of a dear friend. Couple things about this particular site is that it's centralized in the heart of San Francisco. A \"tourist trap\", if you will. Now, I'd have to disagree about the \"trap\" part because locals frequent this spot just as much as visiting tourists do.\n\nEverytime I eat at the The Cheesecake Factory I usually order one of 2 things. Either the Chcken Madeira (which comes with some bombass mashed potatoes) or the Chicken Marsala with mushrooms and some bowtie pasta served just the perfect way, between al dente and done. This time around, I had the Marsala and my homegirl tried the Madeira (my recommendation). She loved it and since my dish looked good, she picked at my plate, tried it and loved it!\n\nSince the joint is known for it's namesake, we made sure to make room for what else? Cheesecake. I ain't gonna front, the cheesecake that makes my tummy happier than anything is the dulce de leche. Can't go wrong. The waiter tried to entice me with the red velvet cheesecake so my homegirl had that and decided to pick at mine, again. Of course I didn't mind because it was her birthday.\n\nA couple things about this joint: I really dig the fact that they're open as late as 11pm on weekdays and 12:30a on weekends and there's always alot of people.  Oh and by the way, I suggest you sit outside and enjoy the ambience...especially on a nice day.", "author": "Ivan F."}

This was my first Cheesecake Factory experience and people had me under the impression that it would be like food porn with a taste bud orgasm. I ordered Buffalo wings, which were good but not the best I've had. It also felt like we had to wait forever for the check, despite being one of the few last patrons in the place.

If the pigeons and seagulls aren't enough for you (if you get outdoor seating, indoor seating is usually much longer wait time), the poor service will definitely be another notch down if that's even possible.\n\nI came here twice for lunch, the first time was so so (2/5 stars). Went here again for the second time. This time, we got an outdoor table immediately, but wait, the waitress gave us the wrong table and we had to go back into the waiting area for another 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes wait, we got seated at a outdoor table full of pigeon crap, and a seagull looking at the diners for any trace of unprotected food. Waited for another 10 minutes for the waitress to show up, only for her to ask do you guys want some bread? We said yes, but the water and bread did not show up after she asked if we wanted some (call me crazy, but I expect this to show up within 5 minutes at most restaurants).

Their corporate mission must be to load as many calories as possible into ever customer. They have all kinds of tricks - grated cheese on everything, portion sizes bigger than my torso, appetizers thrown into the deep fryer, oversized beverage glasses, and of course, 1,000 calorie cheesecake. Some things in that ginormous menu are delicious but the majority are worse than the Olive Garden. My team's favorites are: crab wontons (fried), avocado rolls (fried), calamari (fried), macaroni and cheese balls (fried) and buffalo strips (fried). See a pattern yet?\n\nAside from all the food that makes me want to purge afterwards, their service is horrendous. We always make a reservation, 15 minutes before we plan to arrive, and every time they make us wait 30 minutes for our table. Wtf could possibly cause this wait? A 5-yr-old could figure out how to seat everyone on time better than they can. During our last visit, their computer system supposedly crapped out twice, causing all of our delays. Considering the vast empire of Cheesecake Factories across this country, how do they not have a functioning and reliable computer system?

I was worried it might have expired, but it didn't. The $25 didn't get us very far, but at least made a little dent in the total bill.\n\nThe place was swarming with tourists (a lot of Europeans, strangely enough. I guess the size of the portions is exotic for them). Our wait was 45 minutes, so we pushed through the throngs to go over to the bar. Somehow we were able to hover over some other patrons who were leaving and snatch their seats on their way out. We had some drinks -- the Mondavi Cheesecake Factory Cabernet is actually pretty good and the mixed drinks are funny (very fru fru) but if you like sweet, you'll like them. Bartender was professional, curt, and busy. \n\nThen our pager went off! Don't be fooled: when your little pager goes off it doesn't mean you'll be seated right away. It just means that you're supposed to go back over to the swamped front desk and then wait for them to call your name (additional wait time, about 5 minutes). \n\nOur server was nice but, poor girl, seemed a little overwhelmed. She would disappear for 20+ minutes at a time. I was wondering if it was a smoke break or to quell her panic attacks. Either way, we were fine with the slow service because we wanted to take it easy. For us newbies, the menu took about 25 minutes to read anyway. It's very long. The sections are (more or less, in my mind I remember them as): Appetizers, More Appetizers, Little Bites that Are Also Appetizers, Chicken, More Chicken, Meat, Italian-American, Meat, Random Page of Some Stuff that Might be Reminiscent of Mexican, Cheesecake, Cheesecake, Cheesecake.\n\nWe got the \"made to order\" guacamole which I was sad to find out was not made at our table but just made with the amount of spiciness we requested (mild, medium, or hot). I thought it would be more like Adobo Grill (in Chicago). Anyway, the guac was missing something but tasty enough. For dinner I got the 4 cheese penne (not authentic Italian but cheesy and very passable, and enough for 4 giants to split and still be satiated). Husband got the wasabi encrusted tuna tartar. He liked it a lot and surprisingly it wasn't that expensive for a big chunk of seemingly fresh fish.\n\nWe sat inside which was NOISY but in a sort of fun, lively way. There's also the heated patio that looks out onto Union Square (if you're in one of the few tables that actually is set up near the railing) but the people sitting out there looking freezing.\n\nOverall, it was an experience. After hearing the Birthday song sung about 4 times, I got the feeling that this is a place where you go for a special occasion if you're a true blooded American who wants to eat and eat big when you're celebrating. I probably won't end up frequenting this establishment more than once or twice in the next decade (not because it's bad, just because it's not really my style), but if I ever want to feel like a tourist and take a \"staycation,\" or feel like a real American, I'd go again.", "author": "Ekin O."}

We waited, and waited, until finally 2 hours later, we get seated... Outside, with no heaters... I was too busy imagining how delicious the food would taste to notice that my face and hands were numb. Oh well. We devoured our dinner. Service was good/quick, food was good, dessert was even better. They offered a complimentary glass of champagne to ring in the New Year... Sadly I had to turn that offer down since I was 8 months pregnant at the time... We wrap things up and proceed towards the elevator when BAM, I slip on champagne spilled on the floor. Fell face forward, but was lucky enough to land on my wrists... My wrists weren't so lucky though... No wet floor sign, no one trying to clean it up... NOTHING. Did I mention I was 8 months pregnant? While I pulled myself together in the restroom and called my doctor, my fiance and 2 other employees explained what happened to the manager, and what does he reply? \"Well was she drunk?\" NO I WASN'T DRUNK! Didn't you just hear that I'm pregnant? \"Well why did she fall?\" I FELL BECAUSE YOUR STAFF FAILED TO WIPE THE FLOORS. Once I met up with them, we exchanged contact information and he told us to expect a call from Corporate within the next week... That's it? You're not going to bother asking me if I'm alright?

The manager is nice and understanding however the rest of the workers really need to get to par. Each time I eat here it always ends up being a three to four hour event. Waiting for a table takes about 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the size of the group and time of day. After getting situated you wait another 20 minutes for them to take your order 15 minutes later they finally give you some bread and about a half an hour later (sometimes more) your food comes out. I can honestly say I have witnessed one of my WORST restaurant experiences here. Not because of the wait time but also for the way our waiter treated our group. In the end our waiter only came to our table twice and we got charged dinner menu price even though it was still lunch time. For some reason the busboys were serving us, other waiters, and no one ever checked up on us. I know this kind of service only happened to me once but other times I have been here the service has been similar and it was enough to break my patience and appreciativeness toward this restaurant. \n\nThe nice thing about this place though is the view you have from the top of Macy's.

I always have leftovers because I'm a small person :) Expect to pay about $10+ a dish.\n\nThe service is great, overall. Never a problem with any of the waiters/waitresses! They are very friendly. This place is perfect for a date, birthday, anniversary, whatever you want it to be.\n\nOne thing I don't like are the wait times to get a table. They don't take reservations. So its best to arrive there once it opens. If not, you're better off taking a pager and wandering around the floors of Macy's, or going somewhere else.\n\nAnother thing I am not too fond of is the outdoor seating. Yes, the view is breathtaking but during one of my visits, pigeons were flying around occasionally and trying to eat my food. And San Francisco weather can be very windy, so my hair would blow all over the place while I'm eating my food. And it was so cold! Not sure if they installed heaters by now.\n\nMake sure you get a cheesecake after your meal! It's what they are known for. I tried their Kahlua Cheesecake--delicious!", "author": "Amanda S."}

Most of the items I wouldn't even consider for lunch (thousands and thousands of calories); but I settle on the Thai Noodle Salad, lightly dressed ($9.95) and a glass of Saint M (from Germany) Riesling when my bartender/waiter finally was able to look up to take my order.  Good thing I said \"lightly dressed\" because there was plenty of dressing on it; but overall it was good.  This chicken was cooked well, not dry, the veggies fresh, the noodles not all sticking together, and the wine was very very nice with.

The wait can sometimes be a pain in the a** but it's worth it.\n\nJust came here again for a friend's birthday.  We were here for lunch and waited 10 mins for a table (if even that).  My friend and I shared a pizza (the one with artichoke) and the ceasar salad.  Soooo much food!!  It was enough for three people.  The salad was exactly how I liked it but the pizza was a bit off.  Even though it was good, the way they made it was super weird.  It's like instead of taking all the toppings and spreading them throughout the pizza, they took each one and sectioned it!  So there was an artichoke section, a bacon section, and a mushroom section!!  So freakin weird!!  Who does that?!?\n\nThe cheesecakes were of course to die for delicious but I've never had a complaint on that.\n\nThe only other thing that was blah was the service.  Our waitress was so blah and had a bit of a 'tude if you know what I mean.  At first we only wanted two plates for the salad but then our friend changed her mind and wanted to share too.  So when we asked her for another plate she said \"That's why I asked you earlier... well let me welcome these other people FIRST\" all frustrated with us or something.  Geeez!  Hello, isn't that your job?  To fill our glasses and make sure we have what we need??  I could go get the plate myself if you want to tip me.  Honestly, I'm not one of those jerky people that are like bossy and rude to servers but come on now, we just wanted an extra side plate.

For appetizers, the Avocado Eggrolls and Fried Macaroni and Cheese are good too. But most recently, I had a Shrimp and Sausage pasta off their specials menu and it wasn't very good at all. I really like the interior and the heat lamps on the patio, but the wait (even for the elevator to get up there) can take a while (2 hours during weekend peak dinner time). A lot of the cheesecakes are too sweet for my taste, but then again, I'm the type of person who can only eat a few pieces of chocolate at once.

The food is really good but everything else sucks! \n   Visited this place yesterday at about 8:00 pm and did not get seated until 10:00pm!!! I tried to make reservations but was told they do not make reservations. Decided to wait because the last time I was here, I enjoyed the food but was in a hurry to catch the baseball game so I couldn't have some cheesecake. The lady at the check in was quite rude! I was with a party of eight and was told it would be a wait which we expected. She couldn't accommodate such a large party which I find ridiculous and she couldn't guarantee we could sit together!! There was also a man in a suit walking around (manager? I don't know) he was extremely rude. We asked him for a menu to look at food choices and he said to go get it in the front and he walks away! Then we set down the menu and he takes it without asking if we were done looking at it. As he's walking away we said \"excuse me sir, we are not done with that!\" He continues on his merry way! After 2 hours, we finally get seated and that was a problem because they wanted to split up our group and sit us on opposite sides of the restaurant!!! They ended up sitting us together but it was after my husband got loud.  We sat down and didn't have enough utensils, no bread, no drinks. It took about 30 minutes to order our food!

Much like the decor, the menu is a big fusion of anything and everything Americans eat. And again, nothing authentic. \n\nBy the time you finish reading the novel-sized menu and finally decide on what to order: something healthy of course, afterall, you know about their giant portions, the calorie book will make your eyes pop out and gasp for air. A veggie sandwich has 1000 calories? Wait, how many miles do I have to run to burn that off again? \n\nSince almost everything has four digit calories, you might as well loosen your pants and go for something tasty. I chose the Cajun pasta, because it's their \"most popular\" pasta dish. It has 1,176 calories, full of grease and spice. It doesn't necessarily taste bad, but makes me feel so gross afterwards. And the funny thing is, I didn't even finish it. After filling up on orange juice, bread and a side of asparagus (only 43 calories, because it came steamed and had no taste), I could only eat a third of the pasta. \n\nIf you look at it from an economic point of view, $17 for 1,176 calories, is a pretty cheap ratio. But seriously, is that what America's problem is? That food is so expensive we don't eat enough? \n\nBy the way, after the glimpse of the calorie book, I was too afraid to look at the amount of sodium in each dish. I didn't want to have a heart attack BEFORE I even starting eating. \n\nTheir bread is super delicious though. So that adds a star.", "author": "Candice B."}

A friend of mine was in town from Canadia and I wanted to take her to some touristy SF stuff. We capped off a day at Fisherman's Warf and Alcatraz with dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. My expectations were mediocre and they still boo-dy-boo-ed all over them. Everything went downhill after the deepfried mac and cheese (don't judge me!). \n\nThey sat the most obnoxious table full of guys next to us. One kept straight up starring at me during the entire meal. Fool, this ain't dinner AND a show. When they got drunker, they tried to talk to our table via the WORST intro lines imaginable\n\"Hey umbrella girl, your umbrella fell off your chair\"\n\"Wanna eat some of our spinach dip while your friend is in the bathroom?\"\nForreally reals?! That's your intro?? No wonder you're sitting at a table full of dudes with no girls. \n\nAnyways, that's not entirely the fault of the Cheesecake Factory but then I got my main course with a cashew in it.... the one thing on this planet I am allergic to.

I HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION!!!\" For the rest of the night, I could see other patrons stealing glances at me to see if I had gone Eddie Murphy a la The Nutty Professor from a reaction. She called the manager who was far more gracious and he took the dish off our bill. \n\nThen we ordered some cheesecake from their almost embarrassingly long and decadent menu... as if to prove to my visiting guest \"Look, America is fat AND excessive!\". But shit, we could not go to a place and not order something explicitly stated in their name. So we ordered. And waited. And waited... and waited. 15 minutes later, we were told that the printer in the cheesecake kitchen was broken and they had to reorder it for us and she'd be back when it's 'ready'. Really?!?!

Hunger pains set in and why not? He was on vacation.  \n\nI like the view of the Cheesecake Factory over looking Union Square on a nice day.  The heat lamps can only provide so much warmth.  It was raining so as a result we choose to sit inside.  The view would have made the ambiance, much nicer.  \n\nThe wait was short on Wednesday.  I enjoy my $10 cocktails and glasses of wine, or however much they cost.  In terms of food everyone knows the portions are ridiculous.  I honestly don't really care for anything, but the delicious dark bread and appetizers.  I always get the spicy ahi tempura rolls.  They are insanely good and quite filling.  On this occasion I tried the crusted chicken romano.  Disgusting.  If I had been hungry I definitely lost my appetite.  It was too rich.  It just made me nauseous.  I ended up taking the whole thing home to donate to other hungry mouths.  The boyfriend got the steak Diane cooked medium well.

Fresh Crab meat Blended with Cream Cheese, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts and Sweet Chili Sauce. OMG this was so lovely. It wasn't greasy fried, and with ample wontons (maybe 8).

Once that kicked in, we got some drinks and mooned over the view from the patio. I had a Lemon Drop (which was refreshing and divine), boyfriend had a Mojito (which was also most excellent). I was very relaxed from fresh air, medicine, and drink by the time we were called to our table.\n\nThe dinner: The portions here are insanely huge (which explains the overwhelming presence of fatties) so if you're a normal sized person I advise you to skip the appetizers, no matter how hungry you may be from the hour long wait. Or, have a meal made up of JUST appetizers, that works too.\n\nWe had: Artichoke, spinach dip for appetizers. The artichoke came with two sauces for dipping. One thing that really impressed me about Cheesecake Factory is the sauces. If you have a good sauce, it really pulls the meal together, and the sauces here were pretty amazing. I would love to have taken some of these sauces home with me. They were both pretty delicious.\n\nFor dinner, I had the Beef Ribs and the boyfriend had some kind of sandwich that he claims was amazing. I didn't try it though, because it looked boring.\n\nThe Beef Ribs were f-ing delicious. They come large, thick, and pre-separated. Each rib is individually lined with what looked to be two different kinds of BBQ sauce, and the sauces were again delicious. Not too spicy. They are also fork-and-knife tender, so don't be afraid of a mess when you order it. You also get onion rings and french fries with it, though I opted for mashed potatoes instead.\n\nI was getting pretty wasted from the Lemon Drops by the time dessert arrived, which was the Red Velvet Cheesecake. OMFG, Cheesecake. OMFG OMFG OMFG. It was sooooo good. Even though we couldn't finish our dinners we managed to kill at least half of the heaping slice of cheesecake. Then, into the to-go box it went.\n\nIt was pretty reasonably priced. For two appetizers, two entrees, four cocktails and dessert, $118 including tip. And, we took home enough food for 2 more meals each. Pretty good value considering the location.\n\nI recommend bringing a nondescript bag to put the leftovers in because the homeless will try to fight you for them on the way home. Serious.\n\nAll in all, once I got over the claustrophobia, it was a pretty good experience. Our server, a nice lady with short blond wavy hair, was very attentive, especially considering how busy she must have been.\n\nIf they can fix the crowded elevator situation, and CLEARLY MARK THEIR EMERGENCY STAIRS PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, then I feel I can easily bring my rating to five stars. Until then, I think I will only come here for lunch from now on.", "author": "Rachel H."}

This Cheesecake Factory, however, is an exception due to the location. Perched atop the Macy's in Union Square they have a great patio for you to take in the beautiful view!

There is always a super long wait and the lobby area is quite the cluster f, but once you're seated you are greeted with an expansive menu of delicious food including a new lower calorie menu. I've never read a bad meal here and this visit was no exception. The Caesar salad is one of my personal favorites and I decided on the lettuce wraps to compliment the salad with a Long Island ice tea to finish off the meal.

We come here often when we are in the city mainly because when were are done shopping or running our errands its the only good thing open that is close by. It sucks that when it's late they shut down the Macy's where there are couches we sit on while waiting to be seated. There is always a long wait so be prepared, don't come starving because you will die. Anyway it's nice because it's up high in union square and it's just a fantastic view so that's something real special. The food is always consistent and tasty when we get it so that is nice. They have a large menu with different food choices so you can find something you like or just try something new. The bread is always warm and good, the only place where I will pick wheat over white bread. The service is just ok because there are so many people to take care of but the food is good. We usually get the steak diane and the sides are always done right so I don't mess with consistency once it starts to deteriorate I will try something else but until then I stick with a classic.

Everytime we go it's a very long wait but this time....Ooh god!\nIt was the last day before my mother went back to Mexico so naturally my brothers and I wanted to do something for her so cheesecake factory it was. \nThey don't take reservations even for large parties so we decided to wing it. Big mistake, they told us it would be an hour long wait (typical) but 4 of us would be seated at one table and the other 4 at another table separately,(not so typical) not even close to each other! And if we waited for a table large enough we would get it by closing time; it was 8:30 on a Saturday. They close at 12:30!

The restaurant itself isn't horrible, albeit a tad overpriced.\n\nThe last time we were here will prevent me from ever coming back to this location.\n\nWe went on a Saturday night. We went pre-shopping, around 5:30pm or so, and were told it would be a 45 minute wait, which means 1 1/2 hrs, minimum. We decided to get something small elsewhere, shop, and come back. We returned at 7:30/7:45ish, were told the wait would be the same (it was WAY longer than 45 mins), and went to go fight for a decent place to wait in the lobby.\n\nOk, A.) What the crap is up with them having virtually no seating in the lobby? People are going to have to wait to be seated at a table... slap some benches in there. \nB.) It's always so horribly crowded in their poorly layed out lobby that you inevitably feel as though you're in the way.\n\nAs I was struggling to perch on the base of one of their decorative poles, I looked down just in time to see a ROACH crawl by. As I was forced (by their lack of seating) to stand on an already swollen, injured ankle, that was the point that I wanted to leave. But the BF was hungry and cranky and so was I, so we stayed.\n\nWhen we were FINALLY seated (I had to ask the borderline rude hostesses a few times), we were seated outside. Those sad little heaters they have don't do anything. \n\nWe froze our asses off for a good 20 minutes before anyone even came over to acknowledge us. We didn't get drinks, a hello, NOTHING. We sat at the table, literally being ignored, for a good 20 mins before some sweet waiter, taking pity on our souls, stopped by and said, \"I'm not your server but I'll take your order.\" Thank you, savior in tacky CF white. \n\nIn fact, we had no clue the entire evening who our server was. Random servers and bussers came by to refill drinks and drop off our food (usually to the wrong table), but we never actually got a server. My BF's wine didn't come until our food did (one glass should not take that long). \n\nAs usual, food was decent, not great, and overpriced. Service was slow, but that's to be expected when you don't have a server.\n\nI'd like to clarify that the servers and bussers were working their behinds off- none of this was in any way their fault, as far as I could tell. \nI'm chalking this entire horrible experience up to the management. It was clear that they were painfully understaffed and the staff they had was overworked. \nThe staff did the best they could to make things better, hostesses aside.\n\nLOOK, UNION SQUARE CF: YOU'RE RIGHT BY UNION SQUARE. WITH A ROOF DECK. YOU NEED TO ANTICIPATE THE KINDS OF CROWDS YOU GET.

Maybe it was the weather or maybe it was Sunday, not sure but the wait was not bad at all.. it's usually 30-45 min wait with all the tourists. We told the hostess we needed 3 high chairs, she said she's make it work. We got to our table which was a booth... no high chairs... ummmmmmm... okay... so we had to wait for another table to be cleaned. The waiter brought our bread and some fruit for the kids which was very nice. After the waiter took our order and we settled in with drinks and get to catching up. After a little while we noticed the tables around us were all getting their food.. even though we had been there longer and our party sizes were relatively the same since the kids didn't order anything. \nI wanted to order the meatloaf, i just love meatloaf and it's actually not bad here. Instead i tried something different and ordered the pork chops... which were fine except for the apricot glaze. I hate warm fruit... so maybe it really was good.. but I was not a fan. the mashed potatos and the spinach is always good here.\nOverall.... for a tourist spot, this place is decent... if you don't mind the loud hustle and bustle.

I grew up in Fremont and during High School and my friends and I would try and go every time we were in San Francisco but the wait was always just too long. I tried to go again while visiting the city during my college years and alas the wait was too long for us. Finally six years after my first attempt to dine here I finally came here with my boyfriend and his mom during a lunch on a random Tuesday afternoon. SUCCESS!!\n\nThe view was amazing and we got to sit near the window (not outside because it was too cold). Our waiter was awesome and even hooked us up with some very delicious \"hot sauce\" but I think it was just chili sauce used for their ahi salad or something. I had the Crusted Romano Chicken with Alfredo pasta. SO DELICIOUS!!! I'm wanting to go back soon just for that! My boyfriend got the jambalaya pasta which was good but definitely does not beat his mother's jambalaya. His mom got the orange chicken which was good too. I liked that the portions were huge but I wish their bread basket had some better breads in it, they were too tough for my liking. OOO and I got the red velvet cheesecake which was SO AMAZING! I'm a red velvet girl for sure and it was everything I wanted and more! My boyfriend got the snickers cheesecake and I do not know how it tasted myself because he devoured it before I even got a chance to try a bit, I think he liked it. \n\nWe will have to come back again soon.", "author": "Ashley P."}

Basically there was a long line for the elevator to get to the restaurant and when the doors opened it felt like I had landed in the middle of a mosh pit. It was an absolute zoo and you could barely get to the desk where you put your name on the waiting list. After being told it would be a whole TWO HOURS to get a table I decided that I might as well put my name down and get some drinks at the bar. The next thing I heard was \"come back in 25 minutes and I'll give you a pager\". After hearing that comment I decided to leave and go to Cortez (which is a much nicer and unfortunately more expensive restaurant). Waiting to receive a \"pager\" is simply not my idea of a great night out.\n\nCheesecake Factory needs to get a grip. I don't know why they refuse to take reservations and they need to start informing people before they get on the elevator that there is a 2 hour waiting list...I'm betting most people would just say \"Screw This\" and go somewhere else.\n\nI've eating here in the past and the food is \"ok\". The portions are enormous but I'm more of a \"quality not quantity\" type of restaurant goer.

He was so bitchy, for no reason and incredibly cordial to everyone else surrounding us. I'm not sure why, we didnt smell, we weren't rude, and we didnt' come in when they're about to close. He would literally be smiling to the table next to us asking them if everything were alright, they needed more water, if they were ready to order, if he could bend over backward,etc. AND THEN he turns to us\nand become a complete ass.\n\nI asked him if we could have some bread, to which he replied:\nDick: Oh you want bread\"\nMe: Yea..\nDick: You dont have to have it\nMe: ok...\n\nFrom then on, i didnt even bother coming here. \n\nWith a line wait that long, you'd think that people are lining up for a ticket to heaven.", "author": "N K."}

I ordered the chicken \"littles\" (little fried boneless pieces of chicken) it was decent enough, well seasoned and the portion was huge! It was just an okay experience.\n\nI went again last weekend for a friend's birthday and wanted to try the jambalaya pasta (sounds sooo good) but by the time dinner came I wasn't very hungry so didn't get to try that. Plus we were heading to a show afterwards so I didn't wanna have to carry any food bag around. So I ordered a small plate which was the little crabcake balls. It came with six balls and a little (literally) dipping sauce. It was so doughy it wasn't the most pleasant texture. I really didn't like it very much at all. Definitely wish I had gotten something else.\n\nI also hate the crowdedness of the place. People bumping into you and not saying excuse me and getting all up in your personal space. I wanted to push some folk. But I didn't. Also my party had to ask for bread and refills and more butter. Not cool. And I ordered a drink at the bar (martini) it was $9 and the bartender didn't even fill it up to a decent level. \n\nAlso the elevator was jacked up so we had to take the thousand mile escalator ride up to the top. And at the end of our meal one elevator was working and the line was crazy to get on it so we had to be escorted through the kitchen and all through the back way to get out. Macy's was closed so we couldn't take the escalator. It was a freakin' journey and could have been pretty dangerous if there had been a fire other emergency.

After some confusion about where the restaurant was located and some very amusing attempts by us to locate it using our smartphones, we realized it was located upstairs in Macy's in Union Square.  We feared they would be closed since it was around 9 pm and a Thursday night but they were open and packed!\n\nWe asked for first available seating which turned out to be outdoors and perfectly lovely, just a little chilly.  The only reason I'm giving this review four stars is because I felt their directions to us regarding seating were confusing.  When we agreed to sit outside, they did not give us the buzzer and told us to just stand to the side (near the elevators).  There were so many people and waitstaff coming an going that I feared we had gotten lost in the shuffle and would not be called.  After a little arguing with my friend, he assured me that we would be called soon.  And he was right, we were called in about 10 minutes, as soon as they had cleared a table for us.  Had we wanted to sit inside, I'm sure we would have waited much much longer.\n\nThe night was lovely and foggy, but that's perfect San Francisco.  The view of Union Square was great from the upstairs balcony.\n\nWe both ordered salmon.  My friend tried the bar-b-que salmon and I had the herbed salmon.  It was wonderful and juicy.  My friend also had a strawberry lemonade which he said was really really good.  You could see the strawberry seeds floating in his glass.  Yum!\n\nUnfortunately we were too full to try any cheesecake, which I really wanted my friend to try.  But, maybe next time.  Their portions are large enough that sometimes you need to come to The Cheesecake Factory just for dessert.\n\nWe would certainly eat here again.", "author": "Karen C."}

I won't buy $10 drinks to stand in YOUR living room and you wouldn't either.  Get it?\n\nThe food can be hit or miss.  Nobody's perfect, but CF is fairly consistent in serving their best items without any problems.  The Chicken Piccata is amazing and something we always get together.  The Steak Diane is also a top choice for my wife and me.  I will say that the very extensive menu is not all great foods, so ask the server what to stay away from.  That move saved us one time, so don't be afraid.  After all, it's your meal.\n\nAnd yes, tourists go there.What would SF be without tourists??  So, if you're a resident or local, get over yourself.

The lights, the crowd, the bite in the air and the hustle and bustle of mass consumerism just makes me tingly from head to toe. \n\nI really like the Miso Salmon, but would recommend skipping the Thai peanut noodles (think spaghetti  covered in peanut butter....blegh).  \n\nMy beef with Cheesecake is that I'm convinced the waitstaff stole my hat.  I literally had just got in the elevator when I realized I left my hat at the table.  I raced back up and went back the table and it was no where to be found.

The absolute biggest problem with our experience here was the long wait and horrible service at the front desk. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were told we would have an hour wait. We thought it was a little long, but we decided we needed to run over to the Apple store anyway, so we did it. We left, came back half an hour later. We asked, and were (rudely) told that it would be twenty minutes longer. Forty minutes later, our buzzer finally went off - the total wait was about an hour and ten minutes. We were then told to wait to the left of the counter, which we did, for five more minutes. The waitress came and took us halfway to our table, when she stopped and told us to wait in the hallway because she had forgotten what table she was taking us too. When she came back, she led us to our table, where we were again asked to wait while it was cleaned. Finally, we were able to sit down. \n\nThe bad part was over. From here on, we found that the waitress was friendly, and the food (pepperoni pizza) was fairly good. However, we would absolutely never return and be asked to wait an hour and ten minutes. \n\nAs a side note, I hope you're not claustrophobic, because you are obliged to cram into the elevator with fifteen other people for the ride up to the top of Macy's.

Lines are terrible, food is well priced for what you get, but the wait alone makes it totally not worth it.  \n\nWhat i never understood about this place (and ill be honest, i worked here for a year and a half), is how people can wait that long for food!  Valentines day, people come in and wait 3.5-4 hours just for a table that is so close to the next one there is no privacy.  Im sorry, but if my date was to ever even think about taking me here on valentines day, id break up with him or never talk to him again.  \n\nIt shows me that:\na) he didnt have the plans made ahead of time and this is totally last minute. \nb) i could have eaten two meals in that time...make me a meal at home, more romantic than sitting in a lobby with crying kids, and \nc) that this is the level he thinks of me....\n\nBut....go here on a wednesday at 3 and have a JW's pink lemonade on the patio, and you will be a happy camper.

If you can get past the normal 1-2 hour wait, there is a chance you'll be seated outside which will only make things worse. Now if its a nice day, then thats fine. But usual Frisco weather is often cloudy and breezy, so even with the heaters outside, you'll often get a brush of cold wind that could ruin your dining experience.\n\nAside from the seating, the food is pretty good. Their portions are pretty hearty and the food often flavorful. I consider it an upscale TGIFridays. As for the cheesecake, I gotta say that I am not really a fan. I've tried a couple different flavors, but none of it has really stood out. Actually, I have to say that as far as cheesecake goes, your best bet would be Tahoe Joes...now their cheesecake is to die for!\n\nI strongly suggest going on a weekday, when the wait time is reduced.

But despite this, and my requisite Bay Area chain restaurant snobbery, I keep eating here because honestly, there just aren't that many nice sit-down restaurants in the Union Square area where you can eat for less than $20pp. The menu is enormous and clearly designed to please any crowd, and everything is cooked in enough butter to taste good. And their brown bread is legitimately delicious. \n\nThat being said, I hate how tourists flock to this place. There are Cheesecake Factories EVERYWHERE, people!

I've been to the cheesecake factory in Pennsylvania but the one in California is just so much better due to location.  Its located on the top level of the Macy's in Union Square.  There is an outdoor balcony where you can go to see the entire city.   Very fun experience.\r\n\r\nI got a salad - I don't even remember what kind - but I always get the same thing when I go.  The portions are huge and the food is tasty.  The one thing that was a minus was that we asked for a chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake and they were out of them, then we asked for oreo and they were out of those as well, we even asked for one more - and they were out of them!\r\n\r\nI guess that means they sell fast - but come on..keep the cakes in stock!\r\n\r\nAnyways, it was delicious - I love cheesecake factory..I haven't been to one since then and that was a year ago..but if you've read any of my other reviews i'm sure you can presume why.\r\n\r\nIf I lived in San Fran I probably would never go to CF, but I'm a tourist and its a tourist spot.\r\n\r\nOh one major minus is that the wait is insane and they don't allow you to call to make reservations.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-12-28", "description": "It's a chain... and as such it is always going to be pretty much the same... so, if you want to grab something to eat while shopping... go get your pager and shop for about 1hr 45 min before you get seating when it is at it's busiest... this is for a party of 2-4... anything beyond that... bring a camping tent and wait it out in Union Sq. for awhile.  \n\nAs for dishes I like... well... I tend to order the following:\n\nPortobella on a bun: Tasty meatless burger with a side of fries which I usually substitute for broccoli. I actually like how they cook their broccoli. \n\nCajun Chicken little: When I feel like being a pig... I order this fried 3,000 calorie (probably more) dish... it is a fancy chicken strips meal that brings a side of I think... fries or mash potatoes... I forget... again... I substitute for veggies... can't be all that bad! \n\nThai Lettuce Wraps: This is an appetizer that I order as my entree... why? Because I like the sauces and eating like a bunny rabbit!  This dish consists of chicken (grilled) with carrots, onions, noodles and sprouts to warp around in the butter lettuce leaves... my favorite dish here.  The sauces are yummy too.. don't know what the green ones is... but it is YUMMY!\n\nChinese Chicken Salad... HUGE... and delish... I order this when I want salad, crispy noodles, fruits, chicken... everything meshed together... (I think you may be getting the idea here... I pretty much don't eat red meat or pork... so... I have the chicken) The dressing is tasty... and the crazy thing is... I measure other Chinese chicken salads against this one... I have had some horrible ones elsewhere... it is the dressing... maybe the sweat into it or something... it's like crack! Yet not whack... \n\nAnd for drinks... Mojitos!  Yes, they are $10... but I have had good ones... Needs more mint at times... there is usually just a sprinkle of them in there... but it goes down well... again... my expectations aren't too high... it's a chain!  Non-alcoholic drink... the Ice Tea... hands down... that stuff is YUMMY!  \n\nAs for what they are known for... cheesecake... well... I have had a few (not many) but I remember the lemon raspberry one being a good one... by the time I am done eating the HUGE entree... there is no room for desert.  Now... If you just want dessert... order the Strawberry Shortcake... why? Cause I said so... trust me... you will like it... They use cornbread or something... it is not the usual biscuit... and now.. I am hooked... we usually order it to go and they give you all the pieces separately.... we then go to Union Sq. and put it together and eat it up like crazy pigeons pecking at one french fry left on the street... it is gone in seconds!  \n\nOk... and something I find important to know... the condition of the ladies room... it is usually crowded... so if you have to go... go before it gets ugly... they only have about 3-4 stalls for a place that seats waaaay tooo many. There are two (or is it three?) sinks for your hand washing pleasure which are picky... it is the sensor kind... drives me nuts! On the cleanliness level.. they really do try... I have seen them go in often to clean up... but the high volume makes it hard sometimes... especially when there are people that seem to not know how to potty... I wonder if they are that disgusting at home? Hmm... \n\nWell... that is the cheesecake for you... a place where patience is seriously more than a virtue and you can always feel like a tourist... oh... and if you are lucky you will see those elderly twins that hang out there too... They have a table they sit at.. once we were there and they kept giving us the evil eye because we weren't leaving... the longer she looked at us like that... the longer we stayed... and ordered more stuff...

They give you a big flashy buzzer that at least lets you go down one level to the Macy's furniture section to sit and wait.\n\nThe food is alright but not really worth the prices. The appetizers are more appropriately priced so I usually just end up getting a starter, a drink and a piece of cheesecake. Their drink menu and dessert menu are the only real reason to visit any Cheesecake factory. They have a good variety of mixed drinks, blended drinks, and coffee drinks with different alcohol variations to choose from. They have to have at least 20 kinds of cheesecake and they have other kinds of desserts, too. After a thorough sampling of the entire menu, I've decided the tiramisu cheesecake is the best. The BEST I tell you! It's tiramisu AND cheesecake together in one utterly heavenly slice with a mound of real whipped cream next to it.\n\nSince I'm usually too impatient for cheesecake and Irish coffee to wait for a table here, I usually just get a piece to go and take it over to the Gold Dust where they have $2.95 Irish Coffee during happy hour.", "author": "Kristina A."}

Personally, I make it a point to stay away, but some *ahem* friend insisted ... TWICE!\n\nFirst impression - nice decor.  Great location overlooking Union Square.  Opens till late. (all good)\n\nUpon arrival, you go to the reception to check in and put your name down.  Then you wait ... and wait some more.  Meanwhile, you have conversations with random strangers in the same boat as you since there's really nothing for either of you to do but to wait ... a LONG time.  You wander around the bar and \"gift\" areas checking out their cheesecakes and getting hungrier by the minute.\n\nFinally, you name's called.  With an eagerness you didn't know you had before (you're probably starving by now), you elbow the crowds aside as you get back to the front desk ... you now get a BUZZER! and you get to wander off into the rest of the floors of Macy's while you wait some more.  Not too sure about the range of those buzzer thingys, most people just stay on the top floor of Macy's (linens) looking at endless sheets and towels (woohoo!)\n\nDuring this time, you have no doubt gotten a chance to check out the menu so you know exactly what you want to get as soon as you get seated.  Another half hour or so goes by and your plastic coaster thingy buzzes and flashes.  You trade in your flashing coaster and get put into the \"holding pen\" and wait for somebody to show you to your table.\n\nYou finally get seated.  At this point, you really don't care where your table is as long as you get your food NOW.  Hopefully before you faint from low blood sugar.\n\nThe food: there's a wide variety of different kinds of food here.  So you're bound to find something that will catch someone's fancy (on the menu at least), no matter how large your group is.  What we eventually got (food-wise) wasn't necessarily bad ... it's just unremarkable.  Maybe the long wait's their way to nudge people into thinking that the food is better than it is?\n\nPrices:  not too bad, but not cheap either.  I could find better places to go in the same price range without the ridiculous wait.\n\nOverall:  it's ok.  If your friends insist on coming here.  Go ingest something first.  Preferably a full meal.  Perhaps then, you'll only be hungry when you order instead of starved.", "author": "Winnie C."}

Not only guilty of indulging delicious delights, but most of all enjoying an ultimate no no... The chain foods of all chain foods... Yes, I am a giver and lover to mom and pop restaurants all throughout the city, but The Cheesecake Factory sucks me in every time. \n\nThe crowds, the noise, nor the tourists can keep me away from my hour wait (I recommend; shop while you wait) for an outdoor seating on a beautiful day, hey even on a cloudy mist Summer day. \n\nFunny thing is, I don't come here for the cheesecake, but for the hearty lunches and atmosphere. Or maybe... for the energy to shop at union square! Actually yes, the shopping is the only reason I'd be in Union Square to begin with. Now that Bloomies is right around the corner I find myself at the cheesecake factory a little more often. \n\nThe food selection is abundant. The Salads are my favorite. And get this, they even have a weight management selection. In the meantime it is good to know, but I have not tried. \n\nTo be seated outside is ideal, but remember you are in San Francisco! The weather is unpredictable from one minute to the next and there are no overhangs outside, but there are heaters. The last time I was there, I had to take my sunglasses off because of the mist. But oh well, my time there was still pleasant. \n\nThe bar selection is also fabulous!\n\nAnd please my friends, remember this isn't strictly a tourist place. I have run into many friends shopping that all choose and are excited to go to the top of Macy's to grab a bite to eat and not only that, but have randomly run into friends in the restaurant. It is a mecca of locals indulging in their guilty pleasures. Most just dont admit to paying for over priced meals at this popular chain restaurant.\n\nGET A FRUITY GIRL DRINK...

Anyways, upon getting your pager and waiting the standard 35-40 mins you are seated with a menu that looks more like an 8th grade yearbook (advertisements on every other page) and absolutely no sense of order.

Lunch time is a breeze though.\n\nI honestly don't expect much from Cheesecake Factory, except to provide me with a candle if I'm sitting outside at nine o'clock at night (apparently they don't have enough candles). If I'm out downtown and just feel like getting a quick bite to eat, Cheesecake Factory is just fine, no biggie. But just that, nothing fancy.\n\nOn the down side, the restaurant does not really live up to its title. I'm not really a fan of their cheesecakes because I feel as though they put a lot of junk (aka additives) to make it sweet. However, the tiramisu is not bad, though I've had better. \n\nLastly...\nI see tourists at the Cheesecake Factory sometimes and I can't help but wonder; of all the different restaurants in San Francisco, why come to CF?

I took it from something I wrote a long time ago with a few edits.\n\nThree and a half years ago, my boyfriend asked to take me for an early birthday dinner. We went to Cheesecake Factory that resided on the top floor of Macy*s, where the outside terrace overlooked San Francisco's Union Square, Saks Fifth Avenue, Tiffany & Co, Levi's, Niketown, etc. We waited to get seated and for dinner I got fettuccine alfredo (never again) but I can't quite remember what my boyfriend got. We ate dinner, and I was too full to eat a cheesecake but our waitress told me that we could not leave Cheesecake Factory without getting a cheesecake so I ordered one anyway. While we waited for our cheesecakes, my boyfriend asked, \"Are we getting anywhere?\" And I answered with a yes. Afterwards, he let me know that he was going to use the restroom to be polite, and came back in thirty seconds. I did not think much of it, I thought to myself, \"He is a guy, what do you expect?\" Finally, our cheesecakes came out. Mine had the words, \"will you be my girlfriend?\" around the cheesecake. I was totally dumbfounded because our waitress ended up giving me his [strawberry] cheesecake while he had mine [oreo cheesecake], and initially I read it too fast that I thought it had said \"happy birthday girlfriend?\" I was like, \"happy birthday girlfriend? I think she gave us the wrong cheesecakes.\" \"Read it again.\" my boyfriend said. \n\nI can't believe that was three and a half years ago, already.\n\nWe still come here when we have the chance, it's nice to eat outside during a nice day with a bit of a breeze. If you're only coming here for the cheesecake, you HAVE to try the Godiva cheesecake, it's to DIE for! Especially if you love chocolate! So yummy. One thing you must know, the wait is extremely long but once you've waited for a good 30 minutes to an hour for seats, you'd be hungry by the time so come full with food already in your system because the wait will make you HUNGRY.

Most of the food isn't that great, but some are satisfying. I've been here many, many times and service as well as the quality of food has gone down.\n\nTo start off, an estimated three hour wait time for a party of twelve. They took down the reservation at 6:15, but one of us decided to break up into two tables of six. That cut down the wait time to about an hour. When we got our table, it was pretty obvious we could have fit 12 people. We got a corner spot, with an empty table next to us.\n\nFood:\nFor appetizers, we got fried calamari (good) and I tired a tuna civiche dish that one of my friend's ordered  (good). \nI got the Chicken Marsala. I haven't gotten this in sometime so I decided to try it again. I now remember why I don't order this. The bow tie pasta was under-cooked while the chicken was somewhat dry, but I overcame that by soaking it in the Marsala sauce. One of my other friends also complained that his pesto angel hair pasta was hard and pretty dry. I prefer Buca's chicken Marsala (a bit juicier, as well as bigger portions).\n\nOne friend got a Kobe burger, good size but it looks like they've tone down the portion of fries considerably. I wonder how their burgers sell once the Burger Bar opens up downstairs. \nAnother friend got the Meatloaf. It tasted like meatloaf, somewhat over seasoned, but nice portion.\n\nService was alright. It was busy as usual, but no specials were mentioned, nor any recommendations and we had to ask for some drinks to be refilled. Dirty utensils didn't help either.", "author": "Tim S."}

Since we were being social, I will not gripe too much about it taking near an hour for the delivery of the calamari. I ordered a Cajun burger, med rare and my friend orange chicken. The food was brought out and my burger was over-cooked. My friend said to \"let it go\" until he pulled his folk up with the first batch of chicken to find out there was a LONG HAIR (he has short hair) in his food! I got up, went for a manager and I believe her name was Ashley (white female). She apologized, I told her I understand her place as we both worked for a luxury hotel and she has the food replaced. The second delivery came and guess what; my burger was once again OVER COOKED! Tashay came over and he explanation was \"we have Mexicans cooking\" WHAT!?!?!?!?! My friend, who is Latino, and myself were offended by that comment. It was a totally inappropriate comment to make. I told her to take the food back and I would not reorder. So, I eat a few bites of my friends orange chicken. We order cheesecake, as I was hungry and then asked for the check. To my surprise I was still charged for the orange chicken. I pointed this out to Tashay and she wanted to dispute that it was taken off. I crossed out and showed her that I was charged. I asked for Ashley to come back to the table. Tashay brought back the adjusted check and stated that Ashley made the adjustment and if we needed her she would come to the table. I was a bit appalled as I asked for her to come the first time, why would she think that I made the verbal request in error? I am disappointed as this is the second time that I have had a bad experience at the SF Cheesecake Factory.

When I watched Top Gun (my favorite movie as a kid) as an adult, I was sorely disappointed to find that it's just a lame story with cool fighter jet scenes interspersed between scenes depicting  homoerotic behavior.  Cheesecake Factory, my favorite place to eat in high school, has been similarly revealed as another mediocre chain restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good for a chain, but in San Francisco you can do much, much better.  That's why you don't see any Applebee's or Chili's or Red Lobster or TGI Friday's in this city; even with their low prices they don't have enough to offer.\n\nThe good things about Cheesecake Factory are its huge menu that can accommodate pretty much anyone and the giant portions that they serve.  The bad thing about this menu is that nothing is done very well.  The appetizers (avocado eggrolls are my favorite) are decent but I have yet to try an entree here that I really enjoy.  The cheesecake is ok, its strength comes from the stuff they put on it as opposed to the actual cheesecake, but it will definitely satisfy that craving if you are a cheesecake fan.\n\nThis particular location is nice because of the outdoor deck overlooking Union Square and downtown, but it's also bad because with all the tourists the wait can be like 2 hours.  The bar gets overcrowded, and everyone is just happy to wait for the same shit they could get in their home town.\n\nWith no wait, this isn't a bad place to come when it's nice out and you aren't especially picky.  It's a decent brunch spot on a sunny day if you can beat the rush.  But if you're planning to come at dinnertime, or if you want to sit inside, or if you or anyone in your group is looking for a really good meal, don't come here.", "author": "Joseph N."}

We were told that it was going to be a two hour wait for anything inside or outside...OK, we expected that.  We walked around Macy's and Union Square for about an hour before returning to the restaurant.  At 9:00p, one hour after arriving, we were told that it was going to be another 10-15 minutes.  We were pleasantly surprised, but gradually became disappointed when that 10-15 minutes slowly turned into another hour.  So, it really was a two hour wait.  When we asked why we were told 10-15 minutes by someone else, the hostess curtly said that they must have read the list wrong, then quickly dismissed us.\n\nWe we seated outside directly under a heater at two wobbly tables (pushed together) with only two place settings.  Our waiter greeted us fairly quickly, but then disappeared for 15 - 20 minutes.  (As the evening progressed, we came to realize that this was how it was going to be for the rest of our stay.)  When he came back, he took our order from memory, which made us really nervous.  We should have asked him to write it down, but we didn't.  He's a professional, right?  Well, the food came 30 minutes later and two of the orders were wrong.  We didn't have the time or the patience to correct them.  Three out of the five of us enjoyed our food, but felt badly for the other two.  During our meal, we had to flag down other waiters to find OUR waiter so we could get beverage refills and condiments.  We often observed our waiter talking with people and taking pictures instead of tending to his tables, hence the disconnect.  The condiments he brought were almost empty and one of our refills of Sprite turned out to be carbonated water. \n\nDuring our meal outside, several times in fact, different people waiting on the balcony started smoking.  Several staff members walked by these smokers and said nothing to them even though there are \"No Smoking\" signs clearly posted.  One person in our party finally had enough, went over to an offending group with another waiter, and demanded that they put out their cigarettes.  That was uncomfortable for everyone and solidified our experience that night as awful and not worth the time or money we spent.\n\nThe only positive thing I have to say is that we did have the cheesecake for dessert which is ALWAYS a treat.  Next time, though, when we're craving for cheesecake we're going to get it \"to go\" instead of waste our time in that location.\n\nIf you don't care about your time, good customer service, or health laws in California, you will definitely enjoy this location.", "author": "Brian S."}

Most likely.  I really liked getting to sit outdoors on the 8th floor, with an excellent view of Union Square.\n\nIs the food great?  I liked everything I was served, bread, appetizers and all.  A bit pricy, but that was anticipated, and the plates are huge.  Plus, their food can indeed be spicy when listed as such in the menu, despite being told that wasn't true by the flippin' waiter!\n\nDo they serve drinks?  Yes.  I ordered a pineapple mojito, and it had good flavor, though it was not strong at all.\n\nWhy is this review not 5 stars?  Two reasons.  First, and I expected this one, a TON of people went here, making us wait AT LEAST a literal hour, though we were able to browse around for awhile in the Macy's floor immediately below.  Second, I went in a group of 3, and we had told our waiter that we'd each like separate checks to pay individually, and he agreed.  But, did he do that?  No!", "author": "Garett T."}

The food is average, and can be overwhelming with the amount you get (I suggest splitting an entree between 2 people, yes even if you're a hungry guy). It's a great casual spot to dine in Union Square, and it's open pretty late too. The cheesecake is ALWAYS good, but there's never room to fit it after eating your weight in pasta and complimentary bread. The one thing I'd suggest for all Cheesecake Factories is to lessen the amount of food you put on the plate. If everyone in your restaurant is taking doggie bags home, it should be a sign. One thing is for sure though-- the price here is very right. And if you split a dish, maybe add a salad and some cheesecake, you get a great well rounded meal for an even better price.", "author": "Ashley D."}

We decided to use our $25.00 gift certificate from last Christmas.  \n\nWe waited for an hour. Part of it we spent just admiring the view of the City from the top floor of Macy's.  The rest window-shopping for furniture downstairs.  \n\nWe were seated on the patio.  It got really chilly. Good thing that BF was sitting by the heat lamp.  I had my leather jacket.  \n\nWe ordered all appetizers.  We loved the crispy avocado and the ahi tempura.  We thought the buffalo chicken was salmon but the waiter said it was ground chicken mixed in with buffalo sauce then deep fried.  It was good, though.  We had to order calamari because it was BF's favorite. \n\nEverything was good.  The bread was fresh and warm.  The portions were huge. We ended up barely touching the chicken appetizer and ended up taking it home. Their glass of Cheesecake's Cabernet by Robert Mondavi was generous and must have been just poured from a newly opened bottle.  \n\nSipping good wine with a view of Union Square, the feel of the cold wind on your cheeks, your sweetie smiling in front of you--that's all part of it.  The City lights starting to turn on while the sunset was coming into view.  \n\nWe had Godiva cheesecake. Gotta have cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory, right?  We ended up taking two more slices to go.  You can go to any Cheesecake Factory but going to the one at Union Square is an experience--the waiting, the crazy crowd, the view, the tourists--they are all a part of a wonderful dining experience in San Francisco.  \n\nI had some pictures taken by the cable car, pictures of Union Square,  etc. Bought BF new shoes at Aldo's and a purse for me.

It was one of the best things ever discovered and we would literally drive two hours, head into downtown, have dinner at Cheesecake and party the night away. We would literally wait for an hour just to eat there.\n\nSomehow, after CF opened in Union Sq, we weren't that excited after all, the novelty had passed, been there, done that. Everyone thinks abt is the giant slice of cheesecake but they do have an extensive menu. Pages and pages of them and if I'm not mistaken, they put ads in between the menu featuring Macy's latest styles, gift ideas, etc....By the end of the menu, you would think you just read a novel and by then, everyone is confused as to what they would like to order/eat.\n\nAnyhow, I don't remember much from the menu except that I thought the Angel Hair pasta was decent and the one item that I frequented was the Luau Salad. So I decided to rekindle the salad spirit and had the salad to go recently. Had a 15 min wait, picked up the order and chow down at home. It's still good....for that itself, I would give the salad a 4 star and the view from the balcony overlooking Union Sq is another 4. Otherwise, CF concept, a 3 star.

You can actually have a conversation rather than shout. \n\nAlso, if you decide to eat here then make sure you've had some drinks prior to arriving because the drinks are not that strong, plus you don't want to be around those god awful tourists in a sober state of mind. \n\nOverpriced chain restaurant that attracts your idiotic Tourist. \n\nHousewine costs $7.50 a glass and they barely even fill it. It's like hello I'm not wine tasting so fill er up. The portions are too big so I opted for an overpriced tomato and mozzarella salad.

Terrible! \n\nCheesecake= overpriced garbage. They don't even make the cheesecake in the restaurant. Totally worthless.  \n\nThe other thing that really chaps my hide is that the servers always remind me of a deer caught in the headlights.

Oh yea... at the Cheesecake Factory where the average wait is about an hour - they do control when you can commence gorging.\n\nI love the Cobb Salad, it use to be the Symphony Salad with grilled asparagus and mushrooms which I miss, but the parmesan vinegarette is amazing! It really makes the salad one of the best I've had, even distribution of bacon and chicken in every bite, evenly tossed. Love it. CF offers a very diverse menu with a little bit of everything around the world. So you can't go wrong with an empty stomach looking for a hearty meal. I could name some favorites, but the salad ranks up there and the other entrees - to each their own. But be warned - the portions are HUGE. I never finish my salads, their lunch sizes are more digestible. Dinner portions will put you into food coma.\n\nSave room for Cheesecake, the varieties are awesome. Heavenly rich though, and good to share. I love the banana cream, fresh strawberry, kona coffee, heath bar and peanut butter - to name a few.

When my friend put her money in for the check, our waiter asked if she wanted change. Sorry, but one of the biggest things I'd always been taught as a waitress was to NEVER ask that question.

I've never been brave enough to try, and risk having to wait another 45 minutes -2 hours. \n\nThe host that took us to the table was not very friendly, and actually removed my place setting!! I figured the waitress would replace my place setting, I was wrong!! They didn't offer us bread &butter, but we ordered an Appetizer anyways. unfortunately I actually had to ask the server to provide me with utensils such as, a napkin, fork, and plate. The only polite person was our server. The BIG disappointment however was that the appetizer, and entree came all at the same time!!! \n\nThe food is rather substandard.

Since we cannot make reservations (are they ever going to change this, it is SO annoying), we just showed up with my husband on a saturday night around 6.30pm. We were told it would be 1h20 wait. I really wanted to eat there, so we took a pager and went window-shopping around the block. After 1h20 we came back to the building and we were told we would be seated soon. My husband asked one of the hostesses if she knoew when was the last Bart train, she answered \"Just look it up on your smartphone\". He answered he did not have a smartphone. She gave him a look, then glanced at me and said with the most surprised look I've seen in a long time added to a smirk: \"neither of you has a smartphone??!\". We just said no. Casually. Because I really don't why we should. Not everyone is supposed to get the latest gadget just because his friends do. She answered \"well, I don't know then\". So we walked to the \"waiting area\" eagerly. FYI hostess: YOUR reaction in itself will make this our last visit to this location. About 30 min later we were finally seated. Table were too close from eachother. I could have reached in the plate of my neighbor easily. Of course, it was really noisy, but I was expecting this from the fact the restaurant was full. \n\nMY food was great. Small plate of Fried zucchini with cheesy dip. Great. Not too greasy, a little crunchy, juicy, good size for a small plate (and $5) and great dip. My main was a chicken Marsala. It would have been big enough to share for sure. The sauce had a good flavor but was a little too watery. A slice of raspberry/white chocolate truffle for dessert: divine. Also had a good tropical smoothie; it was a little expensive for $6, but I guess that's Union Square. \n\nNow my husband's food. First off he orders a Jack Daniel with Coke and I guess they used a new kind of transparent coke because there was none. We were both extremely surprised (and exchanged a look that was still not as expressive as the hostess') and I told him they must have forgotten. He did not want to call them back and have it exchanged. So we passed on to apps. He took fried the calamaris which was a huge platter of very greasy food. Too greasy. Then he ordered a steak Diane medium rare. It came out well over well-done. It was ridiculous how brown it was. Would it have been my steak, I would have sent it back immediately because there is no way I can eat something this cooked. He is far too nice and did not say anything. But he passed on dessert. The waiter came twice to our table  to tell us very weird jokes. I don;t know if he was trying to create a connection to get a better tip or if he was nervous but it was plain weird. Plus he came back only once (at mid-apps) to refill my husband's glass of water and was then left with an empty glass from the end of his apps to the end of the meal. That pissed him off so much he wanted to leave a 5% tip. My food was good so we ended up leaving an undeserved 20%. Thinking back, we could have left 5% since we are not coming back anymore. \n\nI will now try the location at Walnut Creek. Maybe their hostess is less prejudiced and maybe they pay more attention to their food and customers since they might be less busy. \n\nDisappointment.", "author": "Satheene A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-27", "description": "\"Hi, welcome to the Cheesecake Factory, may I help you?\"\n\nDuring my brief stint as a hostess at the Cheese while I was in college, I chanted his line a billion times. So here's a rundown of how things work here and why things are the way they are here. \n\n1) \"Unfortunately, the cheesecake factory do not take reservations\" - Yes, the wait time is ridiculous. 2 hours on a friday night, what are you thinking you might ask. To be honest, the Cheesecake Factory IS highly demanded. It really is that busy. As a hostess here, I know first\nhand that they do seat you in the fastest, most efficient way possible. The technology they use to schedule seating is much more advance than any other highly demanded dining establishment. Basically, the second that a guests leaves, that table will be cleared and ready to seat within 1 minute time. It's very difficult to do reservations because the demand is already high enough without reservations.\n\n2. \"This menu is a novel!\" Yeah, you're not the only person that noticed. One of the reasons why people frequent the Cheese so much, even with the wait, is because the menu is highly eclectic. Can you think of any other place that can accomodate every person's taste? In the mood for asian? No problem. In the mood for pizza? No problem. Mex? There's Tex-Mex available... It's just the easiest non-planning option. And we all like consistency to know that the food is good every single time. \n\n3. The desserts are NOT made in the restaurant. Yeah, sad as it may sound...they are all shipped day-of from the corporate headquarters in Calabasas Hills. Bet you can't tell can you?\n\n4. If you want the booth seat, ask for it in advance. Those are most difficult to come by. You have to request for it in order to guarentee to get it. Otherwise, you could be waiting a very, very long time after you have been promised normal seating.\n\nI am reviewing the SF location, because the scenery there is absolutely gorgeous!! It is located on the top floor of the Macy's tower and provides an excellent view of the city. It's a very nice setting.\n\nI have tried most of the menu, but the best dishes are:\n\nAppetizers:\nCan't go wrong here. Most are great, but the spinach dip, artichoke, and avocado eggrolls are excellent\n\nEntrees:\n- Chopped salad\n- Chicken maidera\n- Steak Diane  - very, very tender.\n- Miso salmon\n\nDesserts/drinks:\nIf you like sweet drinks, the best is the peach bellini. You barely taste the liquor at all.\n- Vanilla bean cheesecake\n- Strawberry shortcake\n- Pumpkin cheesecake -- this is highly seasonal, but it's a great alternative to pumpkin pie. It's really something you must try\n- Strawberry cheesecake\n\nOn Sunday mornings, they have a special brunch menu. The belgian waffles and the eggs benedict are definitely the most popular pick. It's gorgeous and tasty!!\n\nNote that I no longer work at the Cheesecake Factory. But surprisingly, this is the place I will still go back and eat just because it really does provide a great atmosphere and great food.", "author": "Nancy Y."}

The manager is nice and understanding however the rest of the workers really need to get to par. Each time I eat here it always ends up being a three to four hour event. Waiting for a table takes about 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the size of the group and time of day. After getting situated you wait another 20 minutes for them to take your order 15 minutes later they finally give you some bread and about a half an hour later (sometimes more) your food comes out. I can honestly say I have witnessed one of my WORST restaurant experiences here. Not because of the wait time but also for the way our waiter treated our group. In the end our waiter only came to our table twice and we got charged dinner menu price even though it was still lunch time. For some reason the busboys were serving us, other waiters, and no one ever checked up on us.

You know the kind: easy for big groups, loud, standard party food, a menu 562 pages long to appeal to what everyone likes.

Don't think you can get around the wait, it is crowded at all times. The food is not worth the time it takes to get it, it's anything you can get at a TGIFridays, except it's served in a classier setting. I mean, it's not like I don't enjoy the appetizers (who doesn't like popcorn shrimp!), it's just that it's nothing special and there are so many more things around Union Square that are magically delicious. \n\nThe only reason I'd swing by this place is to get in line for a slice of cheesecake, which is dense, really sweet, and suuuuper rich, so if that's what you're looking for it will hit the spot.

This place is always busy and the wait is always longer than an hour unless you go during abnormal eating times such as 4pm-5pm or 9am. Even then, there's still a wait, just not the hour wait you have at other times. \n\nThere's outside and inside seating. The outside seating has heat lamps so you won't get cold, but actualy, it's the top of the building so it gets pretty windy. And there aren't enough heat lamps to get you warm. One time i went and it was so cold and windy, that it just put me in the bad mood and set the rest of my visit up badly. I didn't want to stay there and then they didn't ahve the menu item I wanted. It's great when the weathers nice and sunny but when does that usually happen in San Francisco?\n\nThe smoothies here are pretty good. They're pretty special and elaborate and i always like ordering them.\n\nThe customer service is mediocre to bad. They pretty much just take your order and then you never see them again. A different person brings out the food and they hardly ever come back to check to see if you're okay. \n\nI bought two gift cards for my boyfriends parents for christmas for dinner there. And they ended up giving it back to us to eat since they never go there. And when we tried to use them, we found out one of them didn't work. That's what i get for trusting a kitchen employee who doesn't know how to work the cash register to do my giftcards. What a waste of 25 bucks. If you're going to implement a gift card, you should get someone who knows how to do it to do it right, not get someone who loses people's money in the process. \n\nThe portions of the food are well worth their money. I usually have trouble finishing my plates and I eat alot. By the time i finish, i never have room for dessert. Boo =[ The food itself is mediocre. First time i ate it I thought it was great, but as i went back. The food wasn't worth the wait. And even without the wait, the food wasn't that great. It was just bleh. I could go somewhere else for cheaper and less trouble and get the same quality of food. They really should change up their menu once in awhile cause they only have a few select things that are actually worthy and then those get tiring quickly.\n\nOne time i did try the strawberry shortcake and that was damn good. I would definitely order that again. Everything about it was just perfect. The shortcake was awesome, the strawberries were fresh. The whipped cream seemed fresh whipped. And the portions were enormous. I could have eaten this for dinner itself. \n\nAll in all, the food portions are worth the price here. The food itself, not so much. Customer Service is bleh. And the wait is jsut wait too long since this is the only cheesecake factory in the area. You have to go an hour away to find another place. So along with all the tourists in the downtown area with the San Franciscans, it's just too many people. Sometimes there isn't even enough room for you to wait. \n\nOh, no reservations. I'm not sure if reservations would make them better or not. It might slow things down or make things quicker for people who are actually on time. It would be nice if there were reservations though. That way i could actually eat when i'm hungry. 2 stars.", "author": "Karen C."}

I usually don't like chain restaurants but this one  upholds a very high standard in the quality of their food. \n\nI've always had a pleasant experience at this SF one. That is because I know when to go. If you live/work in the area, go for lunch at around 11:30 or past 2 (lunch ends at 5 on the weekends) and dinner before 6:30. You will avoid all the lines with the tourist and such. \n\nI love their lunch menu. Even though they call it \"smaller\" portions, they are almost as big as the dinner size but it's almost half the price (ranges from $7-12 vs dinner $13-25). My recommendations for lunch is the pasta carbonara. This is one of the best panchetta carbonara I've had because it doesn't have the \"egg-y\" taste. Because the pasta is tossed in yolk before serving, it's hard to master the dish and make sure that the yolk does not overpower the rest of the taste. Next I would recommend the BBQ chicken salad. I don't usually like chicken in my salad but this BBQ one is tasty and tender. It is tossed in a BBQ/light ranch dressing with beans, lots of avocado, corn, lettuce, and topped with onion rings. I also love the shrimp scampi angel hair pasta. It is cooked with fresh tomato, basil, garlic, and olive oil --- sometimes the most simple dishes turn out to be the best ones. \n\nI do have a sweet tooth and I'm a sucker for cheesecake but I find that most of the cheesecake on the menu is waaay too sweet. When I eat my cheesecake i want to experience the cheesy taste and not oreo, chocolate, banana, and the other 30 absurd flavors they have. I usually stick with the vanilla bean one (make sure you ask them to go easy on the whip cream). It's rich in cheesecake flavor with a hint of vanilla bean. yummy. \n\nThe bread is good. Love the wheat.\n\nLastly, the ambiance is gorgeous. It is situated at the top floor of Macy's, the center of union square.

I would order both again in an instant, but will probably try something else the next time just because there's so much to choose from.\n\nThe only thing that bugs is the wait, but I think it's worth it.

Unfortunately for those of us who live in the fabulous SF and want for god knows what reason a piece of cheesecake and orange chicken, it is a chain, and out -of -towners who don't know better eat there because it is something they recognize away from home\n\n2) It sits atop a Macys in the middle of Union Square. DON'T make me explain this one.\n\n3) It's a large restaurant with lots of people and if you go to eat during peak eating hours, you will have to wait due to reasons 1 and 2 stated above.\n\nNow that I am done with my lecture, I have to agree that the wait is ridiculous at CF, but my solutions are to either go eat at an off time during the week or go to the bar.......weekends are always a nightmare so avoid at all costs if possible. Expect the wait and go a little early to get your vibrating tag and sit and enjoy the view or walk and get a drink at the bar and laugh at all of the frustrated looks on those waiting like you. If you practice enjoyment and patience I swear you'll get a table faster. If all else is lost, then sneak in near the bar, scope out the scene and see if anyone is leaving. Bar area is first come first served, so if you see people leaving a table, gently come up and say \"hi\" and ask if you can have their table when they are done. Be polite, but not too needy or aggressive. It is annoying and I have purposefully avoided giving people like that my table, prefering to defer to the nice people who don't hover like vultures as I am trying to eat my banana cream cheesecake in peace. If they are nice, it will be a smooth transition from their leaving to you sitting and avoiding the 90 minute wait for a table.\n\nThe cheesecake is yummy and with so many varieties you cant go wrong with your choices.\n\nThe portions are ginormous and easy enough to share with your friends or take home and enjoy the next day.\n\nI personally loved the seared ahi tuna salad and orange chicken.

I'm a big mac and cheese fan - what better way than to fry it up and serve over creamy marinara sauce?  Thai lettuce wraps, sweet corn tamale cakes, crispy crab won tons, their clam chowder - all good.

Strawberry cheesecake does it for me.  Big slice of their plain cheesecake with large glazed strawberries.  Two giant dollops of fresh whipped cream.  It's smooth, creamy, and oh so yummy.

The wait can get pretty ridiculous, but that's normal for some places. I've decided to eat outside so I wouldn't have to wait any longer than I have to, because I was pretty hungry. It was pretty cold out there, which is expected for SF towards the evening time. What annoyed me the MOST is how long I had to wait for a server to come to our table, and get us water. Come on PEOPLE water!!! Then it took forever to get our food ordered, and to top it off getting OUR FOOD!!! I've never waited so long for food. I thought maybe they were short staffed and it was terribly busy, BUT I was wrong. I came another time and it was the SAME shananigans -_- so disappointing, so I've come to conclusion that I will avoid eating at Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco.", "author": "Janice K."}

I ordered the Well-Mannered Martini (kettle one vodka, olive juice, and hand stuffed blue cheese olives) YUM-O!  My husband ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, also very tasty.  Edamame as a pre-dinner snack and we were set!\n\nThis one was very nice, dare I say better than our local restaurant.  The ambiance was so romantic and we were seated with a perfect view of the city.  As the sun set and the lights of the city came on, it was the perfect setting for our \"date\".\n\nWe both decided to order something off the menu that we'd never had before.  I got the Bang-Bang-Shrimp (it usually comes with chicken, but we don't eat meat; fish only on occasion) which was to-die-for delicious.  My husband ordered a stir-fry veggies with shrimp and noodles plate (i can't remember the name) and it was incredible.  We just shared because they were both SO good.  The portions are huge so of course we took the rest to-go and also order banana cream pie cheesecake for the hotel after-party, lol.\n\nOur waiter was attentive, not the best, but decent.  He took a break mid-way and was replaced with Miss No-Personality.

EVER.\n\nFirst, the things it's got going for it: a nice view; convenient location; a bar that serves a pleasantly strong manhattan; and some good, but not particularly inventive appetizers (e.g., fried macaroni and cheese balls).\n\nThe things that kind of annoy me: the wait!! who the hell are all these people? shouldn't they be in walnut creek or something?; the associated striving for suburbanite acceptability - i.e., it has the facade of trendiness, unless you've actually been to a trendy restaurant; and overpriced menu for that type and quality of food.\n\nI suppose it's mainly the demographics of the restaurant that irk me. I know, I know... i'm a typical bay area snob. i can't help it... i've been trained well. but i really have to wonder why people want to come here.\n\nThe wait is long, the food is average, and it's expensive.

This is because the menu at CF is maybe at least a dozen pages long.  Some of their \"specialties\" include Baja Chicken Tacos, Teriyaki Chicken, and Chicken Piccata.  I counted 3 country of origins already and that's only the chicken section of the specialties.  Hmm...  I'm thinking Con-Fusion cuisine.  By the way, save your expectation for something else, these dishes will not be authentic in any way.\n\nOkay, I guess if you're going in a big group, it's a surefire because even the pickiest of the picky can find something he/she will not despise.  But if you're going in a big group, rest assured you will have to wait at least 1 hour.  Which means the crankiest of the cranky will be so upset that he/she will not enjoy the meal.  \n\nI do give props to them for the amount of food you get.  One portion of their entree can easily feed 2 people.  Easily.  Flavor-wise, meh.  It's okay.  It's just okay.  Service?  Definitely spotty.  As spotty as the white jeans that they require their servers to wear.  Case in point: last time I had dinner there, a food runner dropped the food off at our table while the server followed right behind.  As the runner walked away the server smiled ear to ear and asked, \"How's everything?\"  To which I answered, \"Uh...  Not sure, because we haven't tried anything yet.\"\n\nI would really rather go elsewhere, really.  But it's so consistently convenient that I always return.  Well, at least when someone suggests it, I wouldn't mind.  With all the options within the 1 block radius, I'd recommend something else in a heartbeat.", "author": "Yohanna B."}

There is a reason why the wait time can range from 5 minutes to 4 hours. Obviously, if you waited 4 hours, there is something good. I've been here around 15 times now, and almost everything is consistent. I say that because, my Miso Salmon was overcooked, undercooked, and perfectly cooked. The service has been consistent throughout all my visits. \n\nWhen someone orders a burger, I always think.. \"Why come to cheesecake factory and have a burger.\" Seriously, unless you're getting a kobe beef burger, otherwise Jack in the Box is down the street. Anyways, my current favorite dish that's a must try is the Chicken Madeira. It's absolutely delicious and flawless. If you want some steak, combine it with the Steak Diane for $20. \n\nAll in all, I love this place and it's a treat to always come here. The restaurant's atmosphere is very nice and pleasing.

All the entrees are excellent at a decent price.  many range from mid $15 and up.  the burger was only $15 and the skirt steak is $20.  the cocktail about $10.   altogether, the bill came to be $55 (bill total).  not too bad for two hungry people!", "author": "Ju D."}

It was on top of the Macy's building which you can walk out and wait for your table there. The view is lovely, of course! You can also sit outside which wouldn't be too bad since they put up some sort of plexiglass to keep the wind from hitting you. There are heat lamps, too. We were sat within 15 minutes. I ordered the steak diane-- delicious! I love the mashed potatoes that come with it and the sauce is amazing. My friend got the chicken madeira which is another favorite of mine. The sauce they put over that chicken is so good.\nWe decided to be fancy and get a bottle of wine. We chose a german riesling that was about $35 a bottle. Worth it.\nThe service was good. The server kind of took out plates a little prematurely, but I guess since we wanted to get dessert we didn't mind too much. \nWhite chocolate raspberry cheesecake.

I had been to cheesecake factory several times when I worked in SF.. So I decided to take my family.. It was a Saturday so I knew it would be busy.. But we decided to make reservations.. We got to our table pretty quick.. Our server was pretty nice in the beginning.. I asked him for some suggestions on my chicken plate.. He offered a few and everything was ordered for dinner.. During our meal, we needed a few things that took awhile to get but it was busy so we were understandable.. After the meal, our server said he would be going on break... And introduced us to a lady.. She brought us our check and that was it.. I paid with a credit card.. And she brought the bill back.. I signed and put zero tip... Cause I had $10 cash in my pocket.. So, I left that on the table and we got up to leave.. The meal was pretty good and overall service was the same.. And for only 3 people eating I thought $10 was plenty for a tip.. As we walked to the exit, the server that was supposably on a break chased me down and asked \"sir..sir.. How was your dinner?? Was everything ok??\" I simply said.. Yeah.. Food was ok.. Why?? He then gave me an odd look and walked away.. I was totally confused.. Why did he run up to me when we were leaving and ask??? As we started down the escalator the girl that had replaced the server walked right behind the server and said \"hey.. They left $10 on the table.. Cheap asssses\"... I was completely shocked and I wasent sure if I heard her right.. My wife then said \"did she just say what I think she said???\"... I just couldn't believe it.. I am still in shock.. A few days after.. My wife sent an email to the cheesecake factory email and never got a response.. That's pretty sad that they can't even respond.. I don't think I will ever be going back..

To start, I have a severe food allergy, so to those who also have one I'd strongly suggest not eating here. I have a severe peanut allergy and the waitress was honest and  told me all of the stations in the kitchen have peanuts, since they make a wide variety of Asian dishes. I was hesitant on ordering anything at all, as it would be at my own risk. However, she reassured me that I would be accommodated and she would let the kitchen know about my situation and they would be very careful. It made me feel safer  so I ordered my meal. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes with my food, which oddly came with onion rings on top?? I thought that was a strange food combo, haha. 5 or 10 minutes had gone by since I had received my food when the waitress came by and said there had been a mistake with my meal. My plate was supposed to come WITHOUT the onion rings, which happened to be fried in PEANUT OIL. I was shocked that such a huge error was made without it being caught by anyone in the kitchen. I had her take back my meal and told her I was done eating for the night. The one thing I was trusting the restaurant to keep out of my food, was carelessly sitting on top! It is a horrible feeling to have to think about death while doing everyday things like sitting down to eat. It is also a horrible feeling knowing you're trusting your life with those handling your food, only to have a mix up that could have killed you! To me, it showed a lack of concern for my particular situation. I was never offered a comped meal or even an apology from the waitress or any other staff/managers for that matter. It was not a happy dining experience!", "author": "Cassandra L."}

For the most part is pretty good...the drinks a bit over-priced but the wines are good and the lower-end priced ones are just fine.\nMy favorite dish is the salad with endive, watercress, pear & (it's either pecans or walnuts...can't remember) with blue cheese crumbled dressing. It's a big portion and unless you are a pig, you certainly don't need anything else especially for a lunch...they bring you a nice basket of warm bread.\n\nAs far as the \"very long wait\" for a table when you are not alone. Just take your pager they give you, go down the escalator one floor to the furniture department and wait plus have your conversation with friends in  a homelike atmosphere on a comfortable sofa because, as I said before, you won't be able to have a sensible conversation in the restaurant unless you sit on the terrace.\n\nThe fried calamari is good as is the salmon salad. WARNING! Never eat a hamburger at any Cheesecake Factory (I don't think they use good meat or they tend to cook it to death even if you order it rare).\n\nNow, as for the crowd. Well for lunch you better damn well be in the place no later than 11:30 or you will wait until hell freezes over for a table. The same thing at dinner...get there by 4:30. They don't rush you so you can order drinks and an appetizer and wait until your real dinner time.\n\nIf you have any complaints about what you order either talk NICELY to the waiter or ask for a manager and you will receive satisfaction.\n\nYou can eat at the bar (which is what  prefer unless I have guests from out of town or it's an especially nice day to sit on the terrace). But don't sit inside because you will have to scream at the person across the table form you it's so noisy in the place.

Unlike the past two times, we didn't have to wait at all for a table. I would suggest arriving early to avoid the long wait (i.e. more than half an hour). \n\nI had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta which is \"penne pasta tossed with broccoli, oven-dried tomato, roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts\", quoted verbatim from their menu. Unfortunately, the reality did not match the description. There weren't any peppers or tomatoes in the dish. A bunch of the penne was clumped together. Overall, the dish was really bland. I would recommend their chicken marsala and mushrooms instead. I've had it in the past and it was much more flavorful. \n\nThe saving grace, however, was the service. The waiter was really attentive and checked up on us several times. Our bread basket and drinks were refilled several times.

Yesterday I went on a thursday night and it was jam packed, had to wait for over an hour, but once we got seated, there were freshly baked bread on the table ready for us, which is wonderful because we were starving. Then I ordered the crusted salmon with Diane steak, which was delicious, the Diane steak anyway, the salmon was okay. the steak had great flavor and nice chewy mushrooms which tasted great when you eat one after the other. \n\nThey also served great creamy red potatoes and were just amazing. The price was as expected, not too overloading and not cheap, my place came out to be 20$ but it was a very large portion which I took some of it to go. I also ordered the factory chopped salad witch was delicious-the mix of apples in there was definitely a plus. Then we ordered the towering cake which was comprised of sooo many layers, but it was moist with just the right amount of chocolate that wasnt too overindulging. I also ordered the cheesecake before, and definitely know why those things are famous, there is no way you could go to cheesecake factory without ordering what they're famous for. Its absolutely amazing, and im not such a big fan of sweets, but always have to get one of these whenever im there. So i ordered two meals, a salad, and a desert and the total came out to be 75$ which includes tip and tax, pretty pricy for two people, but somewhat expected.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, dim lighting, clean place, on top of san francisco's macys, giving you a great view of the city, there's a Tiffany's co. right across, and making the view that much better.

Every tourist in SF must see The Cheesecake Factory and think \"Oh good, a restaurant i recognize\" because man oh man, this place is always packed.  My friends wanted to go there for a birthday. They didn't listen when i said the wait would be 2 hours. I got dragged along knowing I'd be hungry for hours - so I secretly ate a small dinner before heading over ;-)\n\n... 1 BART ride and 4 hours later we were seated.  My friends were all mad at *me* for some reason! It sucks being the fore-bearer of bad news. I tried to warn them, oh well.\n\nAside from the wait - the portions are asinine. I'd love this place if they had smaller portions, shorter waits, or at least took reservations.  At least the food is generally pretty good - but never great.\n\nI think the Cheesecake Factory is part of some conspiracy with McDonald's to make America fat because the portions are ludicrously large. Is this supposed to be some sort of replacement for guilt-inducing \"All you can eat\" places?  It's OK to order gargantuan dishes and eat it all - but \"all you can eat\" means you are a pig? I once went on a date to Cheesecake factory and we split a Santa Fe salad and were both quite satisfied.  It was hard to resist the urge to order tons of food after waiting so long to eat - resisting that \"omg I'm going to starve to death if I don't eat soon\" feeling - but I'm glad we did.

For the five of us, the total came to $109.15-- five!  Not including tip, and only including two drinks (lemonade with a cup full of ice: $3.95 each).  The kids were happy with their orders-- bang-bang chicken and something or other, and chicken costolleta (essentially, high end KFC style fare).  One parent looked disappointed by the miso salmon (salmon on top of rice with a few token snow peas as garnish-- the menu description leads you to believe the veggies play a bigger part in the meal), the other was happy with her Jamaican shrimp (lots of sauce in that one).  My eggplant sandwich looked pretty, but the taste didn't command $9.95.  \n\nThere are not many vegetarian options aside from basic pasta (but who'd want to pay $10 upward for a plate of angel hair topped with tomato sauce you could make at home?), one veggie burger, and one eggplant sandwich.  Good luck dining here if you're vegan.  A whole lot of chicken dishes, though, and lots of salads and pastas with chicken, too.  The seafood variety was limited to salmon, shrimp, and tuna.  The nice thing about TCF is that at least it's okay to substitute, for example, fries for broccoli (take a look under \"side orders\" and choose your substitute) with no extra charge.\n\nAs other reviewers mentioned, the service is pitifully slow, fairly inattentive, and table turn over is the servers' priority.  One of the hostesses was just lazily sitting behind the front podium as a small queue formed to get a table, letting the host do all the name taking.  (Regardless of whether or not it was her break time, that's just poor business practice.)  I noticed our server would suggest the more expensive dishes on the menu as well, so I suppose that's not all that uncommon of restaurant staff for squeaking in larger tips.

Friends got my aunt and I GC to Cheesecake Factory for our birthdays so we went and spent them there. As usual, the one at Macy's Union Square is a zoo. The lines are eternally long, the place filled with tourists eager to eat something familiar instead of exploring SF flavors and the service is spotty. I don't ever remember a time I go there that it wasn't at least a 45 minutes wait time. Why don't they take reservation is beyond me? \n\nWe got there at 6PM thinking that we go for an early dinner and hopefully the line is shorter, boy we were wrong. We were told at the time we checked in that there was a 50 minutes wait. The reservationist gave us a buzzer and sent us to the bar so that we could drink ourselves silly with the expensive beer and wine prices. What she neglected to tell us was that the bar tables at the bar area are opened for grabs on a first come first serve basis. Great customer service huh? Had we know that the bar area serve a full menu and doesn't require wait time, we would have grab the 2 tables that became vacant. That was ridiculous! We waited for 30 minutes and went back to check on the status and that was when she told us that if we wanted to sit outside on the patio, we could have been seated sooner. Hello! Why didn't you say that at the time we checked in? Playing hard to get? Again, things like this pegged my dumb-people meter in one day.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our table, we observed an immoral and uncivilized incident. An older gentleman approached one of the bar tables where a couple (white male and Filipino female) were seated to ask if he could have 1 of their 2 extra empty chairs so that he could take it to the other side and sit down while he waits endlessly for his table. The couple told him NO and that they needed both of the chairs. The older gentleman left and asked the next table and got assisted this time by a nice lady. As we watched the 2 mean, uncivilized and immorally disrespectful couple at the table stuffing their ugly faces with food, they weren't expecting any guests to join them, but they had their jackets and purses on each of the chair. Shamed on them! We were so angry and so disgusted with these people's behavior. I hope you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself for treating an older, weaker person and you weren't even asked to do anything for him, but give him one of your 2 unused chairs. Yes, you, the fatty white boy who looked at your I-Phone the whole time you were stuffing fatty food into your mouth and your Filipino girlfriend who thinks she looks like Kim Kadashe wearing her low-cut top, but has nothing to show for. Shame on you! You deserved to eat at places like the Cheesecake Factory AKA an upscale Danny's! \n\nFinally a table became available and we sat outside even though it was cold. We just wanted to eat and get the hell out of there. By now, it was an hour later, we were hungry, tired from all the standing and pissed that we had to wait because someone didn't do a good job. The food was typically fast food in my opinion.\n\nI had: Steak Diane with medallion of steaks. I asked for medium and it came out well done. So they overcooked my steak. At this point, I didn't even bother to send it back knowing that the second order will come back the same. \n\nMy dining companions had:\n\nJambalaya Linguine - the linguine pasta was a little overcooked, but at least the jambalaya has good flavor and lots of huge shrimps. \n\nSteak Collate with Onions Rings and Sweet Potatoes Fries - The steak was ok, not very good quality meat and the onion rings has too thick of batter and sweet potatoes fries were too salty. \n\nThe soup of the day was Creamy Chicken Soup with Artichokes and Bellpepper - mah! The soup can lukewarm, very starchy, not creamy and bland. \n\nWe split a piece of strawberry cheesecake and could barely finished that. The cheesecake wasn't very light or fluffy and the strawberries were covered in way too much syrup and too sweet and lost its natural strawberry flavors.\n\nAt least our server is friendly, efficient and very professional. So we got good services and he was very intuitive about what we need before we even asked. Overall, not my favorite restaurant especially if I had to dine with the kind of low class patrons they have. No thanks. Please don't give me anymore gift certificate to the Cheesecake Factory. The first time is a torture, the second time would be a disaster.", "author": "Gourmet Princessa L."}

We froze half the meal until the other table left. \n\nThey need more wait staff it feels like. and they need to be more efficient at seating people. After the 1 hour wait, they gave us a 4 person table for only 2 people, so some other poor people kept waiting. \n\nI think they also need to expand to a second floor or something.

Another designed for suburbia, put in the city for suburbanites travesty of taste.  \n\nWas the meal worth its wait in pennies?  Bluntly, Yes.  Large portions that probably get better the next day.

I had the Albacore here and while the albacore was above Can grade the white rice and asianesque bed of vegetables was well lacking in style and creativity.

Because while i tried to push the server along so he could turn his table and get another seating and more tips, he decided to dilly dally and take forever to do anything.

I would put it in the same category as Chili's or TGI Fridays. The cheesecake is super good, but nothing on their 20-page menu aside from the cheesecake is anything special.\n\nI will never, ever, EVER visit this location again as long as I live. We showed up a couple weeks ago, a party of four, and were told the wait would be about 2 hours. We expected that, so we went and hung out in Macy's and Borders across Union Square for about 1 & 1/2 hours. When we got back to Cheesecake Factory, there was standing room only in the extremely loud lobby area. The bar was backed up as it was, so we didn't even bother with it. We were having a good time, and figured standing another half hour wouldn't be that big of a deal. Little did we know, we would not be seated for another hour and 45 minutes. By that time we were not having any fun. We were tired of standing and of the noise, and we were starving.\n\nSo we finally got to our seats. We were not served any bread until after our entrees were served, even though we asked for it twice, no explanation. Our drinks were not refilled until we asked for refills, and the food took 45 minutes to get to our table.\n\nOn top of all that, there was no toilet paper in the bathroom.\n\nBeing on the roof of Macy's above Union Square certainly has its appeal, but trust me, it is not worth it to eat here.

Service was HORRIBLE. From what I've read on here, maybe it's because we're both students. Anyways, we were treated like two 13-year-olds who had no business being in this place. Only we're both in our twenties. Unlike everyone else, we did not get any complimentary bread and butter. Our waitress did not even bother to say \"there you go\" or \"you're welcome\" or \"enjoy\" anything the like. We had to repeatedly ask for refills - they never once just gave us one (in fact, I never even got a refill on my water; but even my bf, who paid for his coke, had to be really persistent). Then they brought us our check when we hadn't even finished half our cheesecakes, which I thought was pretty rude. And it's not like we were taking our sweet-ass time. It was more like they were trying to get rid of us asap. Meanwhile, everyone else around us was treated friendly.\n\nNah, not going back there.

We had a rather large group, and they were nice enough to give us two tables on the patio.\n\nFirst of all, this restaurant has a huge menu, probably twenty pages, the first three just drinks! I could eat there many times in my life and have something different every time!\n\nTo drink, I had a Ritz Martini, which is Courvoisier cognac, champagne, orange juice, and Cointreau. It was perfectly proportioned, not too strong, but tart and sweet, delectable! We also ordered a bottle of 2009 (which is admittedly a young bottle) Colores Del Sol Malbec, a delicious Argentinian red. For its age, this was a very well-executed wine, very expressive and rich. \n\nWe started out with some appetizers, a delicious raw ahi roll, flash-fried tempura style and served with fresh green onion slivers on top. Absolutely delicious when dipped into the sweet sesame dip that it came with! For an entree, we shared the Chicken Stuffed tortillas, which technically was a quesadilla, but so much better. The perfect amount of cheese, didn't overpower the chicken at all, with a tasty jalepeno/cilantro garnish, and black beans and a corn polenta on the side.\n\nThough the restaurant was incredibly crowded due to the event going on in the square, our waitress gave us incredible service.

At least I can express my opinion if it is worth your money.\n\nFood/Selection:\nWith a name like The Cheesecake Factory, one has to assume that the cheesecake is near-top quality. While it may not be the best thing in the world, the experience of tasting their cheesecake will still be worth it (granted you plan to have some). \n\nThe bread is free on them and not too shabby either. The times I've been there, the bread has been somewhat warm to give them their (adequate) texture of freshness. \n\nTheir menu consists of appetizers that lean towards the pricey side, but are usually great picks. An appetizer would be good to have with groups of four or five people. \n\nMain entrees are usually of large enough portions with ranging prices of ~$15 to ~$25 so it isn't one of those expensive restaurants where you get a bite on a large plate. If you're one to have a small stomach, I would consider sharing your dish with another small stomach. Got an above-average-sized stomach like me? The portions are just right.\n\nThe only thing I can really vouch for is the pasta, and to put it bluntly, it's \"not too bad\". Visual appeal is usually very good and well-made. Quality is definitely there, but nothing spectacular. To an inexperienced tongue, the taste and texture might be on the side of being too much. For some, the sauce may be too thick or doesn't have enough flavor, however at the same time is good enough to be said it's good. It shouldn't disappoint too much to either the inexperienced or experienced pasta-eater is what I'm saying.\n\nService: \nAt the desk, they take your name and either have you wait by the side to have someone escort you to your seat or give you an electronic device to notify you of your available table. The waiters/waitresses are nice enough to come by to refill your water and ask if everything's all right. However, if you want to get ahold of your waiter/waitress, that may be slightly difficult, because they're rather busy tending to their tables. \n\nConclusion:\nIt's definitely a good place to go to for a meal. And if the meal itself isn't good enough for your guest or yourself, there's the cheesecake to fall back on. Service is good, food isn't bad, and the interior lends into the dining experience a bit as well. Price also shouldn't be surprising for a well-known restaurant like this by Union Square, San Francisco.\n\nTips:\n- Seating usually is not a problem during non-peak hours, because of the (heated) outdoor seating that's also available on the floor with a view. \n- Good place for a date!\n\nBottom-line:\nFood is good enough for a good time and to spend ~$20+ on.", "author": "M C."}

Me and a couple of my friends we're basically told, these tables are for paying customers only. I was shocked that they even told that to us, good thing right after that we got seated.\n\nOnce we were seated and placed our drink orders it only took about 20 minutes to get the drinks, and then they even forgot one of the drinks which we had to wait another 10 minutes to get. \n\nWe placed our food order and that was done in somewhat of a timely manner. But once we did get our food we just had to sit there because the staff forgot to set the table up correctly. One of the orders wasn't  done correctly and then they even had to say we're going to have to charge extra since it is a side order that you want, even though it would have came with the meal, just on the side. The food was good and that is the only reason overall the restaurant was able to attain the review that I gave it. The tuxedo chocolate cheesecake was great for dessert and I definitely recommend that to anyone that still has room for food after the generous portions of food they give you. \n\nSo overall I must say to be clear on what you order and don't wait for the waiter to check up on you, you check up on them to make sure everything goes smoothly.", "author": "Luis T."}

Ofcourse I had to reserve seats out there. The long wait was to be expected. The downside is that this restaurant is really snug! Especially in the waiting area. There were no place to sit or stand. When we finally got seated, the waiter wasn't really attentive. He just took our order, another person delivered our food and we never saw our original waiter until the end when we got our check. We had to ask other waiters to refill our drinks for us. Otherwise, the food was mediocre.  I gave it a 3 star because of the poor attention from the waiter and there weren't many places to sit/stand while you wait for your table. Although, the balcony seat was the best!

A huge bucket, with a massive oil leak, and a shitty water pump, and you're amazed that even though it is a pile of junk, it still somehow manages to operate.\n\nMy last visit, will remain my last visit, unless I hear they have had some drastic changes. I went in with some friends, three to be exact, and went up the elevator to the top floor and went to put our name in. It was going to be a forty-five minute wait, that is fine, especially for the dining experience which my friends hadn't had yet. The three-quarter-hour wait turned into just over three hours- pay attention, this is why they didn't get one star- which we spent in the bar. The bar, is amazing. Ample seating and standing room, great bar tenders and even better drinks, a bit pricy but it is expected at a place like this.\n\nThen, this is where the downward spiral begins. We get seated outside, which is fine because it wasn't cold and they had the patio heaters on low, too, which helped. So, we're starving and we glance at the menu and are immediately ready to order, but it takes about twenty minutes for our waiter to get us waters and take our order. To our amazement, there isn't really anything left to order! We kept ordering things from the menu to find that they were \"out\" of a lot of stuff. In the end, we ended up all ordering the same thing because we were assured they weren't out of that. Our waiter runs off to put our order in, and comes back promptly, now what? It seems that they only have enough to make three orders, needless to say I'm not even hungry anymore, and I opt to share with my friend. I didn't see our waiter for the rest of the meal, as we were served our dinners by some other wait staff, and never got a refill, or anything. \n\nI don't know what kind of restaurant they think they have, but with no reservations, and ALWAYS a long wait, poor service and running out of food- this is just an unacceptable dining experience, and I warn anyone who reads this to avoid this place at all costs.", "author": "Mace M."}

I went with my dad yesterday at 5 and got a table for two pretty quickly, which was nice. We ordered an appetizer (raw tuna wrapped into tempura), a salad, and a seafood main course. I was going to order an appetizer salad since we had lunch at 2, but the server told us the salad wouldn't be enough so we decided to go for a full size. Turned out the salad was like the size of a main course, which was way too much than what i wanted. I mentioned to the server that it was not what he describe to be \"enough\", but we decided to keep it anyway. After we finished the appetizer and most of the salad (still a little bit leftover), I asked the server to wrap up the rest and bring us the main course. He just gave us the cheque and cancelled our main course!!! The service was so bad!!!! (although the food was ok).", "author": "Alice L."}

The long wait was expected. Once we sat down, a very professional server approached us and took our drink orders. She stated that our waiter is on break and that he will follow up with us shortly. Since we reviewed the menu while waiting, she also took our order. I ordered a mojito and she suggested a glass of water while waiting for my cocktail. That told me that the bar was backed up. I appreciated her suggestion. However, after 10 minutes, no water. She walked by our table a few minutes later and I asked her for the water. She said our regular server would be along with that. 15 minutes in and the water shows up with the cocktail. It's just water. I don't think anyone should wait that long for something so simple. We ordered two mushroom/onion/cheese burgers with side salads. I ordered medium ad hubs ordered med rare. Mine was ok, his was not med rare at all. Barely any pink. The mushroom and onions were so skimpy and there was only once slice of cheese when the menu said two slices. I mentioned the skimpy toppings to our server and he didn't offer to get more. He simply said that's the way it is. For a 1/4 lb  burger that was smaller than the bun with 6 pieces of mushrooms and 3 pieces of onion, I was shocked at the $11 price. I noticed the lady next to me also complain about her food. There was a missing ingredient as well. Oh I forgot, the mushrooms were Luke warm and the cheese was a bit cold. The other reason I'm giving a low rating is because our regular server barely communicated. No thank yous, no acknowledgments, nothing.  At the end, he only asked if we wanted dessert. Hell no. Not going to help your up selling when you can't help make your customers happy. We tipped 10% to reflect the minimal and skimpy service. Next time I will give my gift card away.", "author": "ibby m."}

The cheesecakes alone deserve 5 stars (my fave is the red velvet), service is a 3 on a good day, and the rest of the menu can range from 1 to 4. On our last visit, we went for Sunday brunch round 11am. Got two salmon platters, a coffee, and a mint sweet tea. The salmon platter was very well presented...smoked salmon slices, greens, tomatoes & onion, a scoop of cream cheese and a bagel. Everything was good except for the bagel which was not toasted and was rock hard/stale. We ended up asked for a basket of their complimentary sourdough and oat bread instead. The coffee was extremely watered down...evidenced in the glass cup it was served in - it looked more like tea than coffee. The mint tea was refreshing...I'm thinking of opting out of the sweetener next time cause it was too syrupy. Free refills were offered on both drinks...I thought it funny that the coffee was the same price as the mint tea $3.25...that's more like the price of a latte! On future visits I will skip the coffees and simple beverages and go for the mimosas and other cocktails.

Soooo not into chain restaurants.  I absolutely wanted to hate this place but it actually turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip.  So, instead of Mexican in the Mission that I wanted we went to the Cheesecake Factory, that seems logical, right? So it's in Macy's on the 8th floor and there's outdoor seating! So cool.  Great view of Union Square.  The day we decided to go there was a band (Moonalice) playing in the square- so even though we had to wait 15 minutes for a table we had an amazing view of Union Square and listening to some tunes.  \nThis place has everything but the kitchen sink on it's menu, so I thought I was at least going to make an attempt to squelch my Mexican food craving (yay!).  Had some wine actually called Cheesecake Factory (which was very good, btw).  We ordered some spicy quacamole to start.  We were hungry (we had just spend the day at the California Academy of Sciences) so it seemed like the guac was taking a long time.  We asked our waitress, Katherine (who was also one of our better servers during our two weeks of eating out and eating badly) \"what gives?\" and she said that \"the guac is made to order\", I guess they were busy toiling away to make it spicy and it would be out in a moment.  It finally arrived and it was super delish! Nice and spicy and fresh! Give me lots of yummy guac and you make me a very happy woman!  The guac and chips also came with some very yummy sour cream and salsa!  So, in keeping with the Mexican theme, I also ordered some chicken tacos.  This was pretty good too! Oh joy! The chicken left a little something to be desired in the way of texture- I believed it was in cubed chunks which were kinda on the chewy side, but was definitely ok...the sides of beans and rice were really yummy.  Looking at some of the other plates it's kind of overwhelming the way they serve their food and the portions are humongous.  You could probably order a pasta dish here and eat lunch for at least a couple of days.  I'm not into big portions and left quite a bit of my meal behind.\nI was very pleasantly surprised by this place.  As I mentioned before I'm not really into chains like this, but we had a great time!  We also made a friend! We were stalked by a seagull outside the plexiglass sort of pretend window (we were outdoors), I guess it was some sort of seagull barrier.  My mom (she had the chicken medeira, which she thoroughly enjoyed and ate most of, I won't even mention what my kids ate) decided to give the seagull some French fries and almost had her fingers nipped off!  My kids named the seagull Frenchie, who from then on stalked us for the rest of the meal.  He glared at us from his perch outside the plexiglass and looked longingly at our plates.  I almost thought he might fly over and join our party.  We offered Frenchie wine through the plexiglass, but only French fries seemed to do.  Frenchie rejected sourdough bread!  We had a photo shoot with Frenchie and then we bid adieu avowing to return the next day for lunch prior to returning to New York, alas it was not to be- all that fun caused us to be very weary the next morning and we just made our check out deadline by the skin of our teeth.  Oh yeah, the cheesecake is good too. : )", "author": "Betty T."}

For a total of $15 and a spectacular view of Union Square, here's what I got:\n- Decent service. The waitress was cheerful and helpful enough, but I suppose there were a ton of other customers as well since she didn't come by that much.. Also, her tone kinda implied that we SHOULD order something to drink - we're poor students, give us a break and give us water already!\n- Chicken was superrrr dry!!! Drier than my leather purse, seriously. It didn't have a lot of taste either.\n- Noodles had better flavor than the chicken, a tad too salty though.\n- Large portion, but it looked as if I could finish everything and still be fine. Turns out the bottom of my bowl was 1/4-filled with all the oil used in the cooking, so towards the end my noodles were super saturated with oil. I don't like wasting food, so by the time I was done, I couldn't look at my friends' cheesecakes without feeling the need to puke.\n- We sat outside - there are these heater tower thingies but they don't do much when there's wind. View was nice, but too bad we couldn't sit indoors. Come dressed in layers, because SF weather can get nasty.. \n- For a place with barely OK food, it was surprisingly quite packed. We tried coming here several days ago but didn't actually eat here till today - they told us the wait time was 3 hours last time we were here.\n- Friends liked their cheesecakes. I'd say one slice is pretty pricey though - around $6-8 per slice. =//\n- Only sit outside if you don't mind pigeons. A few of my friends screamed a bit with pigeons flying/walking around our table - there were several instances where I thought my food was going to get soiled with feathers/bird poo. I even watched some pigeons land on other tables to pick at the food left untouched by the customers.\n\nIf anything, I'd rather not come back here.

During my previous visit, I originally ordered the spinach dip as the appetizer and then my girlfriend and I decided to get the nachos too.

It was so packed, it was hard to walk around and show people to their tables, and it was unorganized and so chaotic. Oh wait, that's the same reason I dislike it here as a regular customer too...\n\nLocated on top of Macy's overlooking Union Square, it's in a centralized location. And being in a centralized location, you'd think that it would be more organized but it is so freaking chaotic here. Starting from the bottom floor, you have to wait in line to go into the elevator except there are 2 elevators and tourists don't know that only ONE goes to cheesecake. When you get up to Cheesecake, you pour into a huge roomful of people and you think you're in the line to put your name on the list and you don't realize until minutes later that you're not in any line and in fact, you're just waiting in the area that people are waiting to be seated. Then you go to the front hostess counter where there's no real line so you push your way to the front and get your little beeper and it's normally a 25+ minute wait. Yo could go to the bar but it's super duper tiny so there's no space to sit. There are table but only 3 so good luck with that. So then you wait, but you can't sit because there's only 2 small benches for people to wait so you stand amongst dozens of people with your shopping bags getting heavier and heavier. So that's pretty much the worst part of it. If you can get through that, the rest is a breeze.\n\nStaff is pretty nice there. Food is delicious. If you eat outside and it starts raining though, there is no tarp over head so you have to go inside and wait all over again for a table. Why is it so hard to put a retractable tarp outside??? \n\nWorking here, I met a lot of famous people. (I didn't know Mos Def was so short!!!) \n\nGo here during non peak times and you don't have to deal with the mess.", "author": "Lucky N."}

Seems like a bunch of our other Harper fans decided to do the same. We waited 45 minutes, me on the outside deck and Ms T resting her trotters inside. We were seated on the terrace and waited a few for the waiter. Since we had waited so long, we knew what we wanted and placed our order right away. Ok, I'm just gonna cut to the chase: 1/ We didn't' get our bread and water until we got our drinks. Suggestion - When you have people waiting 45 minutes for a table, bring water and bread to the table right away, it would be appreciated! 2/ Keep track of when tables are seated, it is disconcerting to be seated before another table, yet have your waiter leave your table, hit theirs and then place the order.... remember, we were starving during that 45 minute wait. 3/ Our waiter wasn't as attentive as he could have been. He remained at the waiters station, coming and making rounds occasionally. We had to put our empty glasses at the edge of the table so that someone would notice that we needed refills - unacceptable. Most likely, nothing will change. Due to the location, the tourists and the \"name,\" people will keep coming..... most likely, not me.!

I like the Godiva cheesecake, and the fact that offer whipped cream on the side.  That said, I wouldn't recommend getting one of those annoying vibrating pagers that alert you to get back in line to return said pager so that you could wait to be served by a waiter who would rather not serve you.  Just walk over to the cheesecake counter, place your order, even during the busy times, it should take them no longer than 10 minutes, and LEAVE!!  The entrees may be SUPERSIZED, but so is their prices.  Run out with your cheesecake and dignity intact.

I love how the outdoor seating has a nice view of the city/big buildings surrounding it. It's also packed with people, so it took us at least 30 min to get a table. The food here is consistently good for being a big name chain. We started out with the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which were really yummy and came with 3 super tasty dipping sauces. After I ordered the Luau Salad, which had a better presentation than taste. I think I was a little disappointed because I was trying to be healthy, and instead it was practically all deep fried cracker. But if you're in the mood for that type of thing, it would be delicious. Their cocktails are also tasty and made strong. The guy I was with ordered the Fettuccine with Sundried Tomatoes and Chicken, which was really good.

I was raised on chain restaurants, but I've outgrown their predictable and ho-hum fare served in large portions.    As it happens, every person with whom I have dined at a Cheesecake Factory is no longer in my life.  Yes, that's right...every friend or boyfriend who has suggested we eat at a CF has been kicked to the curb, including my most recent dinner partner.   This doesn't happen immediately, of course.  Rather, I view it as a sign of impending doom...the canary in the coal mine.   Thus, I have accepted it as the kiss of death to any relationship, when someone suggests we eat here, even if it is just because they love the cheesecake.  Let's face it...in a city like SF, there is no reason a city-dweller should come here.  There are just too many to-die-for restaurants at which we could dine.  This one should be left to tourists, Macy's shoppers with low blood sugar, and people who have recently moved here from less sophisticated areas...like Des Moines.\n\nI dined here in May with my BF at the time.  The food was good and the service was friendly and attentive.  We were given the standard flashing-light beeper and waited outside on the terrace for about 30 minutes...not bad on a weekend evening.  By the time we finished our meal, it had gotten so cold that we ordered coffee and cheesecake to go.  For this reason, I recommend sitting inside if it is after 3 PM, even if you have a coat and scarf.\n\nIf you are someone who enjoys the food at this chain, this is definitely one that you should check out.  The roof terrace is nice, with its view overlooking Union Square.  They have patio heaters that emit a nice warmth, although it was still chilly when the sun set, and quite windy while the sun was still out.  You can even peruse the extra menus they keep in the inside waiting area, so you can order once you are seated.  This ensures that you don't spend too much time occupying their tables.  There are people waiting for your table...didn't you notice?!  \n\nSo let it be said that should we ever find ourselves friends or dating, this can be our trigger phrase.  When you are ready to move on, all you need to do to clue me in is to suggest that we eat dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.   I'll promptly dismiss you as the bridge and tunnel unsophisticate that you are, and be happily on my way.", "author": "s r."}

I use to always come here to have my monthly business meetings as i found the location simple and easy. The one thing I was surprised about however was what seemed like an unbearable wait time to get seats. It is somewhat understandable as Cheesecake Factory is located right in the heart of Union Square in downtown San Francisco. I always prefer taking an outdoor seat because I like to look at what the city has to offer in it's amazing background. The restaurant itself is actually quite small usually having long wait lines that form. The bar area is a nice place to sit and unwind as your waiting for your table and a pager is given to you so you know when to come back just in case like you feel the itch to shop at Macy's just located downstairs.\n\nThe food however can be be described as pricey. When I came here in the past I always enjoyed how I felt like I was getting a good deal but as the years went by, it felt like prices were going up and portions getting smaller. Since I am a huge pasta fan it is only natural that I order the chicken fettucini alfredo along with sun dried tomatoes and each time I feel that it tastes different. On one hand it can be perfect, another time it could be too greasy, another time it could have no taste at all. What I'm trying to say is that it's hard to build consistency here. If I were to order a medium rare burger here every week I would expect the same thing every time. But this is not the case. Maybe it's because they are so overwhelmed with customers and orders I will never know but I feel that there are many other places that I can go to that will ofter me the same things at a better price and better consistency.", "author": "Jason Y."}

It's one of the few chain restaurants that actually has good food. The decor is nice - it's interesting, contemporary, and at the same time comfortable. But if you're at this location you really should sit outside on the balcony. You won't be giving yourself the full experience if you don't. I only sit inside if I'm with a group that's too large for the outdoor tables. Service isn't always the best; it's okay to good. It can get pretty busy, especially on summer weekends. Sorry, no reservations. In my experience, the wait can be anywhere from five minutes to over an hour. Usually it's been twenty minutes or under though. People seem to like to complain about the tourists here, but so what if there are tourists?? It's San Francisco! Union Square, no less. Get over yourself. If you really hate tourists that much then you probably shouldn't be in SF. Personally, I like coming and hearing all the different languages. People also seem to write it off because it's a chain and they're just too cool for chain restaurants. Again, get over yourself. Really, is your wait THAT long? I don't know who you're pissing off to have it drag out like that 'cause when I come, it's like fifteen minutes. \n\nI like that their menu offers so many choices. Pretty much everything at The Cheesecake Factory comes in huge portions. It's a good value; you get one and a half meals out of one dish. I'd recommend their chicken dishes though, they probably do that the best. The chicken madeira and chicken marsala are superbly delicious. Sometimes I want to try their steak, but i know that at their portions that's a bad idea for me - I'll probably end up eating until I can't walk. I tried the small plates menu....my pizette and stuffed mushrooms were both really good. If you're looking to make a meal out of small plates, that wasn't quite enough to fill me up. A third plate probably would've done the trick (I just had some of my friend's leftovers instead). Dishes are not all that cheap considering they're small plates, $4-$7.\n\nYou can get decent cheesecake at a lot of places, but theirs is indescribable. Oh so delectable, but also oh so pricey. It's seven or eight bucks a slice these days. They give you ridiculous amounts of whipped cream that you're probably not going to eat. It's good, thick, yet melt-in-your-mouth light, whipped cream. But I wouldn't mind less whipped cream and spending less cash! The cheesecake tastes like heaven, and there are a bunch of flavors to choose from...white chocolate raspberry, Oreo, chocolate coconut, brownie sundae, chocolate mousse...\n\nGood food, lots of variety, large portions, beautiful view outside, and scrumptious cheesecake.", "author": "summer k."}

So when my study buddies and I wanted a weekday brunch and mimosa close to campus, we tried Cheesecake Factory.  Here's what happened:\n\n1. Sat down at a crowded, odd table by the crumb laden waitress stand (I had to climb around a post to get in) even though there were lots of empty seats that were more comfortable.  Sat for like two minutes . . . I am thinking \"it smells like a dumpster in here.\"  I didn't say anything though, because I am a germ freak and everybody always thinks I am paranoid when I say a restaurant is dirty.  One more minute goes by and someone else in my group says \"does it smell like trash in here?\".   We pinpointed the menus as the source of the offending funk - don't ask me how that happens.  We asked for a new table and different menus (of course we should have gotten a new table at a different restaurant, but we weren't that smart).\n\n2.  Ordered our food - two out of four orders were wrong.  The waitress tried to foist the wrong orders off on us anyway, insisting that we didn't remember what we ordered!   It was like she thought to herself, \"oooh the helper didn't present that dish correctly, if I put it on the table they'll eat it.\"  The correct orders didn't arrive until the rest of us finished eating.  Our brunch ended up taking an hour and a half without waiting for a table.  \n\nNext time we're going to Dottie's (great food decent price) . . . after all we can just have an after exam cocktail while we're waiting in line - the crack smoking across the street should be ample distraction.", "author": "am m."}

I tried his fries and they were incredible old and stale tasting. I ordered the tempura ahi roll app (being not too hungry from brunch earlier). I had half a piece and had to swallow a ton of water to get it down. I thought it might be better with the dipping sauce, so I tried to other half, but it was not any better. I pushed it to the other side of the table, thinking I could get the waitress' attention and ask for something else.

It sucks cuz ee couldnt finish it so we decided to just give it to the homeless person who had asked for it.\n\nThe thing I.dont like about this place is waiting in line for so long. And they dont do reservation. Sucks for the people that had.to wait 4hours just to be seated.\n\nOverall this place is amazing. Specially when you get the table.in the patio. Great view of the whole union square with a nice breeeze!", "author": "Blessed Z."}

Very touristy place, but I must say they have a pretty good view of Union Square if you get a table outside or close enough to the window.  Food is overpriced, but you do get large proportions.  HUGE selection of food.  Their menu is practically a novel.  Food quality is pretty good, but not the best.  I LOVE their Fabulous Chocolate Mousse Cake much better than any of the cheesecakes.

If you want to wait about 1.5 hours to get seated, go for it.  The food is good but not spectacular.  My only gripe with Cheesecake Factory is the long wait.  Oh, even if you go on a Tuesday night, you'll be waiting a good hour.  Their desserts are delicious and they shadow their entrees.  The Cheesecake Factory is just a standard American style restaurant that's dim inside and requires a good wait time in order to get seated.", "author": "Manton R."}

This place is kind of love-hate for me. I really love the wheat bread they give you to start (so sweet and delicious) and I have to admit the cheesecakes are divine. But I'm not as impressed with the food. First off their menu seems to never end due to lots of ads cluttering the menu. This also makes it difficult to find a dish more than once while looking at the menu. I used to always get the four cheese pasta, but the last  time I had it they skimped out on the mozzarella and put too much ricotta for my liking. After that I usually tried different things. My problem was that most of the dishes are expensive, huge, heavy, and really unhealthy. By the time you have finished the ample bread and your entree, most likely you will be too stuffed to get  cheesecake. So i suggest getting something small and light and saving room for the delicious cheesecake. Another lesson learned, don't come here often it will burn a hole in your wallet and a will leave you needing to buy a looser pair of jeans at the macy's downstairs.", "author": "Julie C."}

The jambalaya pasta had the shrimp overcooked though but I'm assuming they cook it with the chicken so I can let it slide, besides, the pasta is done perfectly and I could have just eaten that and nothing else. My boyfriend got the steak and chicken combo and he liked his chicken but he felt his steak was a bit overcooked at some parts.\n\nWe ended the meal with cheesecake (who didn't see that one coming?). He got the 30th anniversary cheesecake which is essentially mousse, cheesecake, chocolate cake, and whatever else layered onto it, it was a bit too rich for my taste. I went with the dutch apple caramel struesel and it was very good, I had no complaints about it except I was already so overstuffed with my pasta that I couldn't finish it (makes me want to cry a little now because it was so good).\n\nIt's not some place that I can afford to come to everyday but every now and then isn't so bad.

It can get really windy in their outdoor section. They need more heat lamps, but it is too crowded to fit any more.\nThe waits are terrible. They give pagers but they only work on the floor, so people coming out of the elevator that goes directly to the restaurant from the ground floor of Macy's are bombarded with peopleness as soon as they exit. They should offer to telephone people when their tables are ready so at least people can go one floor down and look at boring furniture in Macy's.\nOnce, however, I went on a Sunday late afternoon and only had to wait 20 minutes. For me, that is an eternity; for Cheesecake Factory, that is a miracle.\nI've already talked about outdoor seating. Indoor seating is fine. The decor is pretty wannabe luxe but it totally works. Sometimes, the music is WAY too loud. I mean, it's Abercrombie loud, and I'm not old, so it really is loud.\nThe last time I went, my hostess was fabulous. She was very bright and cheery. I told her it was the first time I was seated on the east side of the dining area. She welcomed me without a soup\u00e7on of patronization. It was great.\nThe waiter was super-busy and I could see various tables of people being less than nice to him, but he was very diligent and had a cool name I can not remember. I could barely hear him say anything under the volume of music, but he was very patient and recommended a great Bellini. Mmm.\nThe spinach dip is always a safe bet. The chicken Madeira, steak Diane and shrimp scampi were all extremely good. The shrimp was battered and fried and too tasty.\nOf course, the whole purpose of the Cheesecake Factory is to serve cheesecake. The cherry cheesecake is okay. I actually prefer the 6g carb cheesecake. It is yummy enough to satisfy my cheesecake craving but not sinful enough to make me eat the whole shebang.\nI can't give this place 5 stars because it does not give me the sense that I could develop a personal relationship with it. I like places that feel personal. This place just processes tourists.", "author": "sibani b."}

It's been near and dear to my heart since I was introduced to the Cheesecake Factory my freshman year in college. I was expecting the tasty food and drinks that I am accustomed to getting at any other CF, alas this one failed to meet the mark.\n\nLets start with the drink. Since it's been as hot as blazes in the Bay Area (nope, not complaining), I ordered a nice refreshing mojito...except it wasn't. It mostly tasted like rum, lime juice, and sugar. I likes my mint so I was very disappointed by the mint shavings that were floating around in the drink.\n\nFood wise, the Buffalo Blasts were what earned most of the 2 stars for this visit, because really, how can you mess those up? I'm pretty sure they come pre-made. My entree was less than stellar. I got the crusted chicken romano since my favorite dish (Pasta with Pesto, Chicken and Mushrooms) had been removed from the menu. So the chicken romano was bland, the waitress didn't offer freshly grated parm (which I wanted) and as usual, the portion could feed a small family.\n\nI was expecting the cheesecake to save the day, but again, denied. My cheesecake was broken in places and it seems as if they attempted to stealthily cover it up with whipped cream. It tasted like cheesecake, which was good, but the presentation left a lot to be desired.\n\nAll in all, this is probably the worst CF I've ever been to.

This is SF. You will find many good places to eat besides THIS place.  Anyhow, I placed an order for a whole cake and waited, & waited, & waaaaaiiiitttteeed! I waited way to long and I needed to meet with my family at a reserved dinner place.  \n\nI was so upset because not only did people before me get their orders really quick, I ordered 2 different flavors that would make up 1 whole cake.  I don't understand what's so difficult!  Those things are just sitting there for display. I saw people leave with 1 or 2 slices and I couldn't understand why they didn't give me my cake!  More than 15 minutes passed and I was just really feed up!  The servers behind the counter weren't doing anything special. The place was busy but they didn't look that much busier in the dessert area!\n\nFinally, I called for the manager and asked what the hold up was about?  I waited AGAIN.

Now I am a person that doesn't need a bag now and then but in this instance I had to walk several blocks with a heavy cake so I said that I would wait for a bag.  BIG MISTAKE!   I waited way to long for a bag and then thought WHY oh WHY am I waiting here when there are sooo many other places I can buy a cake that would treat their customers better!!!!  They couldn't find a bag?!!!! WHAT?  They have huge portions! The customers don't have bags to put their food in?  They even told me to go down to Macy's to ask for a bag!  Why didn't they ask Macy's for a bag? Wut!  \n\nI got a refund!  The manager wasn't even apologetic!?!  I walked to Bristol Farms in SF Centre and bought a really nice cake in their bakery!

It was a Friday night so a wait for the a table was roughly 45 min.  No worries, because its always busy on a Friday night.  We were seated at a booth and the waitress took our drink order and returned promptly with them and freshly baked bread.  The kids loved the bread, especially the rye (I think).  Our waitress had to go on break but she introduced us to another waiter who quickly took our food order.  30 min came by and still no food.  I noticed the waitstaff servicing our area diassapeared for a moment, otherwise I would have asked about our order. An hour came by and still no food! The kids were whiny, I was upset and finally our waitress stopped by to see how we were.  We told her we've been waiting over an hour and tells us that unfortunately most of the cook staff left!  Something bad apparently happend because the managers are now cooking and  she goes and checks the kitchen for our order.  The manager came by to apologize and explained that they were out of corn dogs (my kids order) and there was a miscommunication because they thought our order had already gone out.  Whatever the reason, it was unacceptable.  We did get our dish within 5 min. however by that time we were full from the bread (we asked for bread 4 times!) and the kids really had to leave by that point.

The food was good, had our usual favorites, crab and artichoke dip, Thai lettuce wraps and something we had not had before, tuna tartare.  Don't know where we went wrong, maybe the tuna.....but about 8 hours later we were both very sick, nauseated and all the rest.  Now about 20 hours later still at it and now feverish.  Called this am to inform Cheesecake that something was bad or unclean or both....\"I'm sorry to hear that, what did you eat....no one else has called\"  Did not take my name or contact info, in case there is a larger issue.

I don't actually mind eating at Cheesecake Factory's if I'm in a place that is all chain restaurants but since SF has such good food options it pains me a little to go here. Generally speaking their food is pretty good, but I'll just base this review on my experience for cheesecake yesterday. \n\nWent there with my sis and her boyfriend since they had a hankering for some cheesecake (specifically from CF)... the place was pretty empty being about 4:30 on a Monday night in the middle of January. However, it still took them a while to give us an empty table so we opted to sit at the bar. None of the empty tables were cleaned off and were littered with old plates, food, etc. We sat down anyway hoping someone would come clean off our table. They cleaned off the table next to us first for some people that were about to sit down, ignoring the fact that we were sitting in filth. Finally someone came to clean it and brought us bread but no utensils, napkins or plates. Again, the people that sat down next to us were given propper utensils right away. grr. We were hungry and wanted to eat the bread so we were forced to act cavemanish and open a butter paket and dip the bread in it and eat it in from our hands. \n\nWatresss takes FOREVER, finally brings us our drink order and allows us to order. Cake comes pretty quick, I just had a glass of wine and took a bite of each of their cheesecakes. Everything tasted pretty good. Again it took a while to get the check and a box to bring the remaining cheesecake home. We get the bill and she charged me for a more expensive glass of wine so had to wait while she  corrected it. Ugh. \n\nLike I said, their food is good and reliable when I'm out of town - usually in Texas or somewhere else that only has chain restaurants. But my experience at the SF version really let me down service-wise, especially with the length of time it took to get the table cleaned in a dead restaurant.", "author": "Lindsay A."}

We were originally a group of 11 but they said the wait was 1hr 45min for a group that size, so we split into 2 group (5&6) so that it would be only around 45min.  So the first half of our group got called within about 25min, fine, the rest of us should be next right? WRONG!  Our half waited another 25min!! WTH?!?! So I asked the girl at the desk why it was taking so long when half of our party was already seated, she just checked our pager number on the computer and said we had another 20min left to wait. ??? Several other groups of 5 got called and we were still waiting.  We checked again and she said 10min. ??? So finally the pager goes off and we still wait another 5-10min! 30min ago I was ready to leave, eat somewhere else and meet up later - why didn't I listen to myself!  Finally we get seated (our other half was finishing their meal already!)  Pleasant enough server.  So I got one of the specials - Salisbury Chopped Steak (with mashed poatoes and green beans).  We also got the Fried Mac&Cheese balls which was good but they should give more marinara sauce.  Ok, so Salisbury Steak was super salty! But I was hungry from waiting so I still ate it.  Refills were slow, especially after our server was switched to the night shift.  I did have my 2 yr old daughter with us - NO KIDS MENU! - but she got a kids size apple juice. When we asked for a refill of the apple juice, the server said she'd have to charge us for another one, ok fine - another kids drink right.  When I got the bill it said KIDS APPLE CIDER 1.95, COLD APPLE CIDER 3.50.  WTH?!?!  I had to change my daughter's diaper so I asked my hubby to see why they were charging a reg. size drink, why not just another kids drink? it was still a small size cup!  When I came back they told me that the server insisted it was right and she had told us there would be another charge.  HELLO! for a kids drink? why not just charge another kids drink then or at least give us a bigger glass? WHATEVER! I was so over the whole place already! While I was pushing the stroller out down the ramp (the place is full of steps) a busy boy mumbled under his breath \"wrong way mam\" WTH! OMG! So I answered back, \"Oh wow really, 'cuz obviously I don't work here and there's no sign.\"  NEVER AGAIN!!! IT WILL RUIN YOUR DAY!!!  I was so upset by the whole thing!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-08-11", "description": "While my review is a little skewed and in-complete, my limited experience at the Cheescake Factory in Macy's in San Francisco is bar far the definition of faux pas when in regards to service. To begin, there was no security guard or doorman at front entrance, but a homeless man (while very nice) opened the door for us. Upon entering the rustle and bustle of the restaurant did intrigue me, feeling like a 1940's L.A Club. The view of the Union Square is fantastic from that angle. Our party of 10 was informed of a wait for about 45 minutes, to which we simply went to the bar and got some beers. Aside from being a tad overcrowded, the fresh Pyrimd ale and Stella Atrois was refreshing and worth it. Luckily our buzzer went of informing us that our table was ready. However, seating didn't occur for about 15 minutes later. While the rest of our party attempted to join us, we had a good look at the menu (I read it 5 times to which I might add their selection is diverse and of great quality from the smell). However, we stayed seated for 35 minutes without a waiter one time come up to us and ask if we wished to start with something. Even after I went and complained to the shift coordinator about the service, we still waited for another 5-10 minutes without anyone to come and service us. At that point I was so appalled I simply left establishment with my party. While the food might have been great I was not able to try it because the service was so terrible. When dealing with any type of business, the most important thing is the service. This is why I have chosen to give this a 1/5, not for the content on the menu. If new management is set in place, I will consider going there again, until then, there are plenty of amazing other restaurants in the Union Square area (with better service).", "author": "Alexander F."}

We were told to stand off to the side and we would be seated in 5 minutes.  After a couple minutes wait we were escorted to the first table immediately as you enter the terrace.  We asked for another table so we wouldn't have everyone entering passing by our table.  We were shown the next table over.  We then asked to be seated at a table on the outside of the terrace (keep in mind the restaurant was virtually empty), only to be told the server would not be there to serve that section for another 10 minutes.  We said that would be OK, but when the host was told we wanted to wait for another table we were told it would be over half an hour, in spite of it being empty.

It is a tourist haven though, and the wait in Macy's can last for hours. I don't have the patience, so it's a rate occasion I go there. Ok, well I was there recently.

There are Cheesecake Factories all over the bay but because it's right in the middle of Union Square it's one of the hot spot tourist-driven restaurants in the area. \n\nThe menu is a bit overwhelming but in a good way. There's practically something on there for even the finicky of eaters. Right off the bat I was impressed with how reasonable the prices were. With it being my first trip to the cheesecake factory I was anticipating small portions and a big lunch tab. I was pleasantly surprised and proven WRONG :) \n\nIt's a new family tradition where we sit and grab lunch at the Cheesecake factory the day after Christmas. Union Square during the holiday season is gorgeous! If it wasn't for the little one dining with us we would have probably asked to be seated on their beautiful outdoor patio. Despite having awesome warmers at practically every table we didn't want to run the risk of having our daughter freak out about the view and want to leave in a hurry. \n\nMy family's lunch party consisted of 6 people. They wait staff seated us at a really comfortable booth with more than enough room to spare. Service was speedy but not the best I had ever experienced. Our server was a total doll but there were a few occasion where we had to remind him a second time to bring extra sauce or to come back with a pitcher so he could refill our waters. TSK TSK. \n\nThe food was actually really good. I ordered the sampler while other people in my family ordered various burgers and pasta dishes. We all sampled each others food and were all impressed and satisfied. I was a bit disappointed that there were only certain cheesecakes that could be purchased for a party of 5-6 people. You figure because it's the CHEESECAKE factory they'd be more accommodating and understanding. What an upset. \n\nOverall I enjoyed the food at the restaurant and would probably willingly come back on a WEEKDAY to hopefully avoid the long wait times.", "author": "Rachel L."}

After assessing the mob scene in the lobby area, you decide to take your pager down the escalator to wait on the couches in the peaceful furniture department, approximately 50 feet from the front desk.\n\nAn hour later, you take your silent pager back up the escalator and suggest to the hostess that it might not be working.  She looks at you scornfully and says, \"You were downstairs SHOPPING, weren't you?\", explaining that the pagers only work on that floor.  Since you've apparently missed your turn in the queue, she says that she'll \"put you at the top--oh, no, NEAR the top of the list\" and that it will be \"no more than ten minutes.\"\n\nAfter fifteen minutes of standing amidst the noisy, hungry throng, you notice the hostess eyeing you quizzically.  She motions towards your pager and asks, \"what number do you have on there?\"  Takes the pager from you, examines it, and says to her co-hostess, \"This one's not working.\"  To you: \"You'll be next.\"\n\nFive minutes later, after two more parties have been seated, you are led to your table.  There, you search for ten minutes to find the three vegetarian options offered on the eighteen page menu.  It's like a treasure hunt!  (Being a traditional American restaurant, 90% of the menu items contain chicken, including every entree salad.)\n\nThen you eat a fairly tasty though oversized meal, attended to by a waitress who is attentive and genuinely nice, albeit somewhat airheaded.\n\nAnd you decide: just not worth the hassle.", "author": "Caroline O."}

I can't remember what we ordered, but I remember that we ordered 2 appetizers and one main dish.  One of the main dishes was a daily special not in the menu....a four-flavor thin crust pizza, which was OK.  I really didn't notice how special it was to be considered something not yet in the menu.  One of the appetizers was a cornbread appetizer with a special sauce surrounding it...I can't remember the name of it right now, but it was between excellent and very good.  We also ordered nachos with guacamole dip, salsa dip, and sour cream, which wasn't bad either.  \nService - 4 stars\nFood - 4 stars", "author": "Jay D."}

Wrong.  It took us 45 minutes to wait for a table. Told the hostess that we wanted a table inside, but we got a table outside. Explained to the hostess (a different one) that we had requested for an inside table. Took about 10 minutes to get it all straightened out, and another 15-20mins to wait for an inside table.  The waiting area was very crowded. Kids were hanging off the counter where the hostesses were working. Kids were running everywhere. It was loud, no wonder the hostess didn't hear us say we wanted inside table. \n\nOrdered the healthy option grilled chicken while my bestfriend had their 3 cheese pasta. My grilled chicken was delicious. It came with jasmine rice, 3 chicken breasts, and asparagus. Yummy! My friend loved her dish. Portions/servings are large - I had to pack mine in a to-go box because I couldn't finish my food.  We ordered 2 different cheesecakes - i had the good ol' regular plain cheesecake while my friend had the lemon raspberry kind. We took it home because we had absolutely no room left in our belly. :) It was still good when we ate it for breakfast the next day. \nDrinks refill - none - waitress didnt even come to check on that. :( \n\nSo... food and portions score big for me. But their service could use a little polishing.", "author": "Christina C."}

They have huge portions and most of the things I have tried were pretty good. The only thing I did not like was the chicken jambalaya pasta. It tasted like it was overly peppered. I do not know so much about Italian or Cajun foods, and maybe it just did not cater to my taste but I did not enjoy it. The prices are expensive, but when you find a dish or things you like, the Cheese Cake Factory is a keeper. One dish that I do love is the spicy chipotle chicken pasta dish. It has a spicy kick to it that I like and the flavor was delightful. It was a good experience overall eating the dish because it was sweet but had a spicy kick to it, and it was soft and chewy yet it had a crunchy bite to it also. The dish is delicious and I want to have another plate the next time I come back.", "author": "Tony T."}

I have gone to the location in my home town multiple times and had an even better time.  This may come down to one very, very simple concept the SF location cannot seem to grasp:\nreservations.\nValley Fair takes 'em. Why can't the most popular of all CF's in the Bay Area take them?\nYeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I'm in San Francisco, one of the most culinarily-advanced regions in the country, I shouldn't be wasting my time here in the first place, but I LIKE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY.  So sue me.  So here I am, Friday night, trying to have good time at a highly-belated birthday dinner from The Boyfriend (we had Amy Winehouse tickets on a day much closer to my actual birthday, but then she had to go and get involved with that yucky husband of hers and cancel the tour. THANKS A LOT AMY WINEHOUSE).  I meet him after work, cranky and starving, having watched my food intake since the previous night.  And we find out it is an hour to a hour and a half wait.\nOK, OK, I try not to lose it.  We can...find something to do for an hour...\nThey don't even have a pager to give us because there are so many people there they have run out.  Most of them are obnoxious tourists smacking their kids around and bitching about the rain.\nSo we go downstairs and sit on a display couch in the furniture section.  I am starting to get really mad, so I'm not talking.\nGreat, so that killed about...ten minutes.\n\"I'm gonna go see what's going on with that pager.\"\nI follow him upstairs.\nWe get a pager and decide to see if we can snag a table at the bar.  It was a long wait, and not worth detailing until the very end when we were only able to sit down after The Boyfriend got into a very vocal and embarrassing fight with someone whom he claims 'swooped in' at the last minute to take our rightful table.  Whatever.  I'm so humiliated and angry at this point I shame him into turning in our pager and leaving.  For the first time in my life, I want to be the bitch that demands to talk to management, but Cheesecake Factory has cleverly made it almost impossible to contact anyone high on the food chain, and I'd feel bad unloading my sob story on some poor hostess, though they weren't doing a great job, either.\nCut to a stupid, couple-y fight in the MUNI station and Boyfriend insists we go back up and give it another try.\nLong story short, we get a seat at the bar.  We order drinks.  Granted I just turned 21 and have never ordered a drink before, but it was pretty disgusting and healthily overpriced.  Bar staff all looked about seventeen.  Waitress (the one with braids) was a TOTAL bitch when there was an issue with the payment.\nWe order appetizers, we order food.  Food was good, but I was so hungry I wasn't even paying attention to the taste.  By the time we were served, at 9:30 at night, the fabulous sandwich I was waiting for for two weeks had become merely convenience food.  I might as well have spent my birthday at Burger King.  This would not have been a problem had The Boyfriend been able to make...\nsay it with me...\nRESERVATIONS.\nThanks, Cheesecake Factory, for the WORST birthday dinner ever.", "author": "Jody A."}

The usual target? Cheesecake Factory.  Only 0.2 mile away from the office and open till 11 pm (12:30 am on weekends), Cheesecake is convenient. \n\nSERVICE. Well, first, you have to deal with the queue. I don't remember waiting for less than an hour, no matter what time I go there. So DO NOT go there famished, or you'll faint. And the maitre d' could be friendlier. The place is ALWAYS packed - a good excuse to grab a few drinks at the bar and wander aimlessly at their heated outdoor terrace overlooking Union Square. Servers are very chatty - the type who'd come to your table every 10 mins and ask \"Everything alright?\" (then of course you have to stop whatever you're doing to say \"yes, thank you\"). But very professional as well. Waiting time for orders to be served is quite reasonable.\n\nFOOD. I love the appetizers and dessert. The main courses, I don't care too much about. The Fried Calamari is great - served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce. Also try the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip - served with tortilla chips and salsa; Quesadilla - garnished with guacamole, salsa and sour cream; and Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls. Oh, and they have this complimentary brown bread which is very yummy. For dessert, the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake is outrageously delicious. For main course, I'd say the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon Combo - although the steak borders on being too sweet.\n\nAMBIENCE. Good ambience - can be romantic or family-oriented. Dim lights. Nice, elegant interiors with lush upholstery. The outdoor terrace offers a great view. Not a very quiet restaurant though, if you're looking for an intimate location. \n\nPRICE. Not a cheap restaurant. I don't exactly remember, but I think average tab per person is about $25-$30. But the main course servings are huge - you can totally share a dish.", "author": "Ryan M."}

With the usual long wait at the Cheesecake Factory, you can expect to stay around 3 hours.

Basic fare with a wide variety of choices, but the concern is, how good could all those dishes be since there are so many of them? The cooks behind the scenes couldn't be experts at making all those dishes.\n\nI tend to order the same thing each time I go which isn't very frequently. I like the pasta dish with chipotle sauce, chicken & peas. The portions are pretty big so I usually eat half & save the rest for lunch the next day.\n\nI tried a kahlua coffee cheesecake & gagged after the first bite, so I told our waitress that I didn't like it & it wasn't what I expected, and asked her to take it off my tab. She did so without any hesitation or fuss.\n\nBe prepared for a wait because I don't know of a time there hasn't been one, especially with all the holiday shoppers this time of year. \n\nDuring the warmer months or occasional heat spell it's fun to eat outdoors on the deck where they also have space heaters.", "author": "D L."}

Maybe it was around 12PM, so it was very crowded. If I had been there with many people, I mgiht have had to wait for a long time. It was noisy but lively. I liked that mood. Also the d\u00e9cor was sophisticated.  We were able to choose where we wanted to sit like on the terrace or inside. We chose to sit inside, but if you choose the terrace, you can see all of Union Square. The food is not cheap but the portions and taste are really awesome. Before the main course, pieces of bread come out for free.  I ordered the Hibachi Steak, and Pasta Carbonara. It was around 35$. The steak was little bit salty but it was tasty. The Pasta was also delicious but there was not enough sauce, so we asked the waitress for more.  The servers were mostly kind. The only thing that bothered me was eventhough it was that even thought it was Saturday at lunch time, it took a long time when I asked for something.

We always had a good time dining at Cheesecake Factory and the food was pretty good. It is maybe because if you eat there, they tend to cook carefully because they don't want you to complain or make a scene if the food is not good.\n\nThe first time i ordered to go because i was craving their pasta. First, the cashier told me that the wait time is 20 minutes, then in 5 minutes i asked her if it is too late if i wanted to change the spaghetti with angel hair pasta. They said it was too late because my order was almost done. \n\nThen i waited 25 minutes, i didn't see my order, i asked her, she said, oh 5 more minutes, i waited again for another 15 minutes and when i asked her again about my order. She looked confused and went to the kitchen. She told me it would be ready in another 10 minutes. Apparently, they didn't cook my order, so they speed cooked my order and even forgot to give me the bread and the sauce for the pasta.\n\nI didn't bother to check on my food, i went home 30 minutes later and was starved to death. I was so pissed to see my bistro shrimp pasta. It was the most gross pasta i've ever had. It was so dry, no sauce at all, no taste, basically it was just a pasta with a few shrimps. \n\nI was so mad, i was about to call the restaurant, but my husband calmed me down. He ended up eating my dinner (with extra alfredo sauce we have at home) and i cooked myself an instant noodle. What a waste!\n\nThe second time, i told myself that i would give them a chance, i ordered louisiana pasta. This time the pasta came on time 20 minutes with bread. However, the pasta was still the same. It was so bland, no taste at all and too dry. I ended up put extra sauce at home.

If you are hungry this dish appeases the taste buds. Most of us ordered pasta by now the time was 8:45. My husband & I decided on sharing carne asada dish that comes with tortillas. I know not the kind of food I really wanted to eat. The food is more on presentation than taste period. At dessert we ordered their famous cheesecake, my daughter recieved a banana cheesecake with \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate! Good touch there! We weren't all overstuffed afterwards which is a good thing since the time was 10:30. All in all if you want the tourist experience then try it. But be very prepared to wait!", "author": "S N."}

We did go on a Friday afternoon, if that makes a difference, but it was beyond packed. The wait wasn't that bad, 20 mins and we roamed the furniture section in Macy's for bit. Then decided to go back and wait in their very small waiting area. Everyone was jammed in there. Finally seated was just like we were waiting. We were seated by the bar and people continuously roaming around. A couple even sat at our table to wait, they asked of coarse, we said that it was fine. But the Staff ushered them out quickly or not really out, but away from our table. There is just not enough space to accommodate the volume of people. SO if you have been to Cheesecake someplace else, leave it at that. This place is the same as all the others.

Out of the 300 things to choose from their menu, I think I've ordered about 10 different things, and haven't hated any of it. I just cannot allot more than two stars for any restaurant that consistently has at minimum of 30 minute wait time, when there are EMPTY tables in the dining room! I swear they do it on purpose, to build up the hype among the tourists. The service is usually subpar, often times requires one to repeat their order after the server has put in the request, re-request your drinks, and sometimes they'll even forget about you all together. And their dishes, while tasty, loses their appeal when you see it's massive Denny's type portions. Each dish can feed 3 people!!! And is 1.5 days worth of calorie consumption, oh and stay away from the salad, it looks like someone's garden got hoed up and put on a plate. But like I said, I have enjoyed ever meal I've had there. Definitely split your plates though, or expect to take a doggy bag home. My fav dessert there is not the cheesecake, but actually the strawberry shortcake. They use real buttermilk biscuits, and vanilla ice cream with strawberries. VERY good, and not too sweet. Oh... also, as a small note, you can tip the hostesses to get a seat slightly quicker... 15 minutes instead of the usual 30+", "author": "Marina K."}

I went on a Sunday afternoon, there were tons of people. Our wait was 40 minutes, which at first made my heart sink because I was super hungry, but actually it wasn't that bad. I was able to scope out all of the food as the waiters passed by so it gave me some new ideas on food to try. Our waitress was super nice and funny. Her great service made up for the semi-long wait. I ate sooo much I felt sick afterwards, but the food (fried chicken breast sliders) and dessert ( strawberry shortcake- it was bomb, so delicious) were so good I didn't want to stop! If you're impatient, don't come here.

It's expected at any restaurant in a busy, tourist-loving city during a rush. Having said that, I think service should be at least halfway decent especially when dishes are like $20 each and a slice of cheesecake is nearly $10. It generally is. Sadly, service here is not always consistent!\n\nI usually get decent waiters. Not awesome, but decent. They're nice, get the job done, some small talk, etc and I usually tip them 20% or more. But this one time I went, we left something like $.83. It actually wasn't my idea. My bf insisted we leave nothing, then decided it'd look more humiliating if we left some coins instead of nothing. He used to be a waiter at Pf changs (and was really good at what he did) and the lack of service REALLY pissed him off. So here's the summary of our lunch:\n\nFirst of all, we're just given sourdough bread. We ask for the wheat too. The waiter told us they were out. I see other tables with wheat bread in their baskets. Okay..so maybe they ran out before we got seated so I'm just indifferent to the whole situation. But then later we see other waiters with their bread baskets that included wheat bread. We request wheat bread again from our waiter (we had to hunt him down), he says their still out (didn't even go check). This guy flat out LIED to us. I mean...if you're going to lie, then at least be smart about it, asshole. So here I am already annoyed before I even decide what I want to order. Waiter comes back to take our order and leaves. We sip on our drinks while we wait. Then we sip and wait some more.  Appetizer finally comes. We eat and wait some more. Sip and wait. And during all that waiting, he didn't stop once by our table to check up on us. Food finally comes and not as hot as it should be, obviously sitting in the window for a good few minutes before it was served. Our drinks only have ice in them by this time. He literally dropped off our food and left, not taking notice of our now empty drinks. We ended up asking a busboy to refill our drinks 'cause our guy was too \"busy\", and by \"busy\" i mean laughing with his other waiter buddies. The same busboy got me a new fork later on 'cause I had dropped mine. Something's wrong when the busboy is doing your waiter's job too. And it's pretty f'ed up.", "author": "Angie Y."}

It was a nice day out and they have a great patio (which is the only reason for a star.)  We waited twenty minutes to be greeted, which our server came over and said, \"I'll be right with you.\"  Then we waited twenty more minutes for our order to be taken.  Another twenty minutes later we get our drinks.  All around us tables are getting their drinks and even bread.  If we had bread at least it would make the twenty MORE minutes we waited to get our food go by faster.  Unfortunately, we didn't get bread until we got our food, which one of the orders was wrong.  It was a fair enough mistake, turkey club instead of the chicken club.  The manager came and apologized, comped our drinks and offered a free dessert, but we never had the chance to order it because we got our check before we were done with our food.  The whole experience was pretty comical.  I understand that sometimes restaurants are understaffed, servers get in the weeds, servers are having bad days, whatever, I've waited tables before, but be nice and apologetic when mistakes are made.  It's a huge part of the job.  Having a flippant attitude to customers is annoying and rude and gets you bad reviews.", "author": "molly n."}

In addition to their signature dessert cakes, I would, hands down, recommend the fried macaroni and cheese appetizer.  Overall, this venue is located in an excellent location (on top of Macy's over looking Union Square), and I'd like to think that it's not as hectic and crowded as it is during the Holidays, once around the time that I visited.  The servers are excellent as far as serving your food on time and presenting themselves professionally (prepare to tip big!).  The inside is subdued, romantic, yet family-friendly.

My sister said she would die if someone took her here to eat, on a date.  That is all this restaurant is over the other cheesecake factories, a good date environment.  I had a pretty good meal, the food was plentiful and for an average 15 dollar a plate upper-class looking restaurant it was good.  I had the lemon chicken which defiantly did not leave me hungry, and the bread that they serve you in the beginning holds you over until you get your food from the starvation for having to wait 2 hours to get seated.  This is the average wait time for a Friday night here, I suggest coming on a week day which is about still 30-40 minutes.  The servers were overly nice, annoying at times, and my water got completely empty twice which is defiantly a negative.  Overall a good restaurant with good food, for a romantic place to bring a date overlooking the city.", "author": "Eric L."}

However, I think I've had too much of it that it's becoming a bit sickening. At this location there is always a wait. I always sit outside on the patio when I do come, overlooking Union Square. Though I've been here numerous times, I've only had the Shrimp and Bacon Club, the Chicken and Avocado Sandwich, Thai Salad, Chicken Littles and BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. All are pretty good, but especially the sandwiches. I did have cheesecake once, but it was way too sweet and the huge portions never leave you still craving dessert. The price is unusually inexpensive for the huge portion you get. I always share a sandwich with someone else and still end up with leftovers. Usually a pleasant experience, but sometimes the wait makes it not worth going to.", "author": "J J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-16", "description": "I went to eat at Cheesecake Factory tonight, and I went to the bar section where the seats are first come, first grab when it is available.  So the hostess said if you see a person about to leave at the seat at the bar area, then just grab it, since they do not have a wait list for the bar area.  So I took a walk around at the bar area, and I noticed a table where they just got their bill from their waiter.  So I stood like 3 feet away from them, not even staring at them, since my back was behind them.  The white female beetch customer said out loud, \"Please don't hover around our table, I hate hovers\".  I was not even facing her direction, since my back was behind them, but she knew that I was carrying a pager that shows that I was to get paged for my table.  So, that gave it away that I was waiting for a table, and that white racist beech had the nerve to say that.   The food is good, but Cheesecake Factory really needs to organize a wait list for the bar area, if they tell the customers to grab a table when you see they are about to leave.  I was not even hovering their table, I was 3 feet away watching the television at the bar, but she can tell that someone is waiting by my pager.    She had no manners at all, because it is known that people at the bar are going to grab a seat whenever it was available.  Then, a white kid was waiting there, and she didn't say anything to him, and she gave the white kid the table, she is so racist.", "author": "Yelper Y."}

I mean look at the menus and you can see that you'll never tire of this place: the menu is extensive (like 15 pages or something or other). The decor is festive and has spectacular views of Union Square, it can be crowded at certain times throughout the day, but when you're eating one of their extraordinary desserts or drinking one of their delectable cocktails, you wouldn't care if they sat you on the escalators. The service could be the worst in the city (but it's not), there could be cracks in the wall (which there isn't), the main chef could have a googley-looking mole on this forehead (which I don't think he does), and I would still eat here. I'm a guy and I feel prego when I leave cause I can't stop eating their gorgeously tasty food (even though they are very generous protions). I know it's the Cheesecake Factory, but I crave their Tirimisu (even if I can go to North Beach) and I act like the weirdest pig when I consume those things... it's disgusting, but this is still making me hungry... think I'll go have a Cheesecake-Factory-baby right now... um.", "author": "Shane W."}

We had 4 people in our party on a wednesday evening celebrating my daughters 21st birthday. They say they don't take reservations however, I called to make one and they took my name and said once I get there it would be about 25 minutes.  When I got there they said they did not see my name on the list and that they don't take reservations, my question is why did you take my name then??? It only got worse after we were seated which took 40 minutes NOT 25 minutes.  Our waitress seemed irritated because I had to send something back to the kitchen and i did it in a friendly way because I dine out quite often and I understand that the waitress is not usually the blame for bad food.  BTW it was a crab dip that looked more like tuna with tons of mayo all you could taste was the mayo.  I informed the waitress that it was my daughters birthday and could they do something special and she told me well you could buy her a piece of cheesecake. She had the nerve to roll her eyes and she made sure I knew she did not like that by her facial expression.  This place is nothing but a tourist trap and they treat the customers like crap.", "author": "Bert W."}

I have to admit, at first I was enticed by the \"escalator to heaven\" vibe that you can't help but feel as you are carried to this restaurant at the top of Macy's. After a long day of shopping, any food looks good to me, and the view is much nicer than being holed up in the cellar to eat at Wolfgang Puck's. I was seated outside, and of course ordered the most extravagant cheesecake slice I could find on the menu. The waitstaff was obscenely slow, and it was a little odd that they brought us bread as an appetizer since we were only having dessert, but the thing that influenced my negative opinion of this place was the pigeons! Within seconds of recieveing my cake, I was attacked by a flock of pigeons that hurridly ate everything on my plate! And I wasn't the only one with this problem, about three or four parties at the next tables were also getting their food demolished by these pigeons. Even after all that, I still had to pay full price for the cheesecake I certainly did not eat. I guess the whole idea of eating outside, high up, is nice, but they seriously need to work on their \"customer satisfaction\" level.", "author": "Bethany D."}

Not only because it's a tourist attraction and popular local haunt known for it's desserts, but their portions are HUGE, good, and so forth. Back to the unusual occurrence: after packing in enough food for the seven of us on a birthday event, one of my young daughters placed the leftovers on the floor in the bag, which tipped, and spilled onto the floor. We apologized and 2 workers came by to clean up the food. I figured, oh well, there goes the pasta, but no, our server comes back a few minutes later with a COMPLETE brand new order? Huh, what gives, isn't it too bad Charlie? I was so impressed, I gave another 20 on top of the 18% gratuity that was factored in the bill. Now you know why people such as Jerry Rice come here (I ran into him a couple of years ago here).

We couldn't even track down our waitress to ask her where our food was the entire hour. Luckily, the manager took care of our bill and did put our order in for to-go. Nevertheless, after promising to be done in 10 minutes...it turned was another 20 minutes.  Whether or not the free food compensated for the terrible service and 4+ hours wait for a dinner is still something to contemplate.

It's the bomb....but other then that...this place deserves less then a star. The wait..is FUCKING LONG...to other people who complain about an hour wait. psh...you won't believe mine. My birthday's in December a few days before Christmas. And of course I had my birthday dinner held here and since you can't reserve, I came FUCKING EARLY to get 25 seats. I told everyone dinner starts at 7pm, guess what time I was here by. FUCKING 1PM JUST TO GUARANTEE MY SEATS BY 7PM. Yes I know I'm crazy but I wanted to get my seats ON TIME. RIDICULOUSLY...AS EARLY AS I WAS..I FUCKING DIDN'T GET MY SEATS TILL FUCKING 8:30PM. They told me I had to have more then half my party here BY 7 and we didn't even come close to getting seated until 8:30pm. Although my birthday wasn't a total wreck, still...the wait here is not worth it at all. Besides..even though I was there at 1pm, of course, I'm downtown..I went shopping all day till 6:30pm and came back hoping to get seated soon. This place is never worth the wait, my advice, just get cheesecake to go, otherwise don't eat here....the food is alright..not anything different or all that great.

If it was in the early part of the week before 7p I can see that.  Do not go here on Fri-Sat.  I have no problem with a no reservation policy but 90min to 2 hours.  Come on.  There are too many places in S.F. to put up with what my Mom is convinced is a bunch of pre-cooked/frozen food because no way can you have a 20 page menu and it's all fresh.  With so many choices I suppose there should be something for everyone.  The Daily Grill and Max's up the street are two alternatives w/similar fare.  They give you a lot and the prices aren't bad.  Some of the pastas are o.k.  I've had better cheesecake.  LUMPY mashed potatoes are not homey; just bad.  The apps/salads are the most inconsistent.  Better to try at lunch when they FIRST open or go early in the week.  They do have a full bar (lots of mixes) for those of you willing to torture yourselves and wait 2 or more hours.", "author": "danielle b."}
