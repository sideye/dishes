Less carbs in your diet might help reduce that rash...\"\n\nSigh. I admit I've been carbing on the heavy and probably eating too much sugars & salts (donuts, evil stuffs). Since diabetes runs in my family I'm aware to eat healthier to live a quality life. In fact, my bestie, Shelley H., encourages me to eat like a rabbit every chance I can, lol, kidding aside, she's my main guru filled with vegetarian & vegan knowledge, so she convinced me there's more to just rabbit foods in eating healthy! Sure enough...\n\nYup. Basically all ancient cultures eat healthy if going back to eating raw and organic. It's nothing new! The processed foods, heavy in salts & sugars is what destroys Americans, hence all the fast foods and bigger arses. And no, Mr. Trump, Taco Bell is not Mexican lol. Back to eating healthier... \n\nSo advice from my Guru and Doctor led me to the nearest Vietnamese spot. A cuisine known to eat fresh, with little empty calories. As I peruse I notice a bookmark from a year ago... DragonEats it is! Located on Haight it is a caf\u00e9 style eatery with modern decor... as I walk in I notice how modern and clean it is, good chi, good flow, this place looks like a win! I am greeted immediately by a young lady w/ Ariana do, and even though the Bahn My Sandwiches looked good w/ good prices, I craved Rolls today. Three choices of Shrimp or Chicken Breasts or Tofu. I opt for the Chicken Breast. Three choices in sauces of Soy, Fish, or Peanut. I opt for the Peanut Sauce. Only $7 and change and complimentary lemon water. As I pay, I notice the older lady (her Mom?) already boxing my Rolls. So my wait time was zero lol. I dine in at the counter. \n\nI immediately notice how heavy these rolls are, and I mean a good heavy, meaning the rolls are packed with good stuff! First piece dipped in the Peanut Sauce... oh my! Heavenly! Two giant rolls cut into six big bite size pieces equals a healthy lunch! It was so fresh, and the Peanut Sauce took it up a notch. I'd order it again, and again. \n\nIn the end, I recommend DragonEats to all. It's a cute little caf\u00e9 on the Haight with a straight forward Vietnamese menu of Bahn My (Sandwiches), Bowls, and Rolls. Next time I might add a homemade Lemonade. So maybe I didn't turn into a magical Dragon, but it was a nice healthy lunch for this Olympic Athlete who needs more Veges, and less processed foods to help reduce that rash... Oh my!", "author": "Eric R."}

It doesn't specify on the menu what the \"bowl\" is; it is actually a vermicelli bowl (as opposed to a soup bowl).\n\nI think it's important to first mention that this place is by no means authentically Vietnamese -- it is clear that it caters mostly to the taste buds of the local community, thereby lacking a lot of authentic Vietnamese flavors and roots. More accurately, the restaurant merely draws influences from Vietnamese cuisine but that is about it.\n\nRoasted chicken bowl: Chicken was dry and hard, and it lacked flavor. The bowl derived all of its flavor from the fish sauce. The vermicelli noodles were not fresh and they stuck to each other. Vegetables included red cabbage shavings and celery.\n\nRoasted duck banh my: Duck was chewy and contained a LOT of fat. In fact, the meat was mostly just fat. I'm not sure how much real protein was actually included in the sandwich. Cucumber pieces were mushy and pickled. Besides that, the sandwich overall contained good flavor. If you must visit this place then I'd say get the banh my but not the bowl.", "author": "Lillian T."}

But it wasn't.  Glad I stepped in there, because I saw signs about Bahn Mi, and Noodle bowls, ginger broths and thai iced coffee.  The best part of it?  Old Vietnamese women doing the damn thing in the back- ya know it's legit.\n\nSure, it's $6.50 for Bahn Mi, \"I can get this for cheaper and better in the TL, BLAH BLAH BLAH.\"  O rly?  Then go to the TL, get your 3 dollar sandwich with a side of crackheads taunting you.  This is Haight, a neighborhood that pays for tourism and high real estate.  I also didn't see the amount of meat to be a problem.  It wasn't lacking, it just wasn't massive like those 3 dollar crackhead Bahn Mi's.  Besides, the bread was crunchy, meat was tender (I did have a slightly fatty piece, but was only a small bite), vegetables crisp and fresh.  Overall, solid sandwich with flavor, texture and...damn. I think i'm gonna walk over there and get one now.  \n\nThe ginger chicken broth was perfect as a side on the rainy day.  I sat in their seating area while some little vietnamese women chatted their way to making my sandwich and soup, and the cashier filled me a cup of iced coffee.  I was just so stunned this place popped out of nowhere. For ambiance-  it was brand new.  Not super comfortable, but I didn't plan on staying their the entire day, so I wasn't complaining- music was not loud and annoying like previous yelper had described. \n\nUnfortunately, local establishments here need to raise their prices for the area.  That day I ran across the new Dragoneats, I had seen a  local clothing shop's \"10 dollars on entire store\" sale.  That store had been there for at least 5 years on Haight;  it's sad to see a local establishment disappear.  Going back to my point, the food sold at Dragoneats is not expensive, nor outrageously priced.   Support a decent joint, especially 1 week into their soft opening.

Pretty good sandwiches, for a decent price. (Sandwiches are all around $6.50 or $7). Although the sauce was a little too sweet and sometimes overpowering. Also the pork sandwich was super greasy and some parts were just fat...not meat. But like just pieces of fat.\n\nEverything else: This restaurant has NO BATHROOM. (LIKE WHERE DO THE EMPLOYEES GO TO THE BATHROOM OR EVEN WASH THEIR HANDS)\n\nSo after sitting here and catching up, we had to use the restroom. And there wasn't one. Not even for customers. Not even to wash our hands. The employee told us to use the coffee shop next door's bathroom and specifically told us to go in through the back. We didn't quite understand his instructions, so we tried to clarify. We even asked if they had a deal with the other store, since we were confused, so we could just ask their employees when we got there. But he was vague and they don't. In the coffee shop, we asked the barista if we could use their bathroom and she said they didn't have any agreement with the restaurant next door and that we needed to buy sometime to use the bathroom. So we spent $3 buying a bottle of water.\n\nAlso, the employee standing in front of the cash register was quiet through all of our interactions with him. We asked him about how the restaurant seemed new, the menu, what items were popular, and also the bathroom issue. He was not particularly helpful and gave us vague and short answers. He wasn't friendly and was very cold. After our bathroom adventure, we kindly suggested how they might want to make a bathroom somehow available for customers in the future, but he just said no.\n\nDecor is pretty modern and very plain. My friend even commented that it didn't seem like they were done building the place. There's limited seating. And with the seating that they do have, there's no leg room.

The menu is simple. They sell rolls, rice noodle bowls, and sandwiches. I got a duck sandwich for myself, spicy chicken sandwich for my parents, and teriyaki tofu rolls for my wife. We all thoroughly enjoyed them. The sandwiches had just the right amount of crunch in the bread and with the fresh veggies. There was a nice kick with the jalape\u00f1os as well and a nice sweet/sour flavor with the fish sauce. My son even tried them and approved.  The rolls were fresh and light with a yummy peanut sauce. \n\nAlso if you have room, the iced Vietnamese coffee was a cool and sweet treat!\n\nWe are glad to have found this on our visit to SF.", "author": "Sri C."}

We decided to go elsewhere and found Dragoneats right up the streeet. Huz had 2 bahn mi (pork and duck), and 5 spiced chicken bowl and ate all of it instantly after we walked the 2 blks home. I did the same with my enormous shrimp roll. Food is excellent quality/taste and the cost is very inexpensive. So glad they're only 2 blks away.

From their warm bread to fresh rolls I've tried the roasted pork and pork meatball 'Bahn My's\" and they are absolutely delicious. Most places don't warm the bread before making the sandwich but this place does - with ample Sriracha in reach and a nice clean atmosphere this place is great for a quick bite or late lunch - you won't regret it!

First of all correct the spelling of the Vietnamese sandwich.  It's not Banh My but Banh Mi.  So here's my two cents that I have shared with owners /managers who were very nice and appreciated the feedback:\n-Very small sandwich for the price (if you go to the tenderloin in little Saigon you will get the real deal for half the price and double the portion.)\n-the sweet sauce they use kills the flavor of the duck (I love duck and had the duck banh mi today)\n-the place is very uncomfortable and there is no leg room when you sit\n-the music (annoying generic pop tunes) was way too loud, bad for digestion...\n-the hours are strange, they close at 6pm.  They need to stay open later if they want more business.\n-the inside of the place is a bit cold and uninviting, they need to make it more cozy somehow.\n\nOn a more positive note: it is nice to have an alternative to pizza, burgers and burritos for an affordable lunch and the people working there seem very nice.  Service was great.", "author": "Monkey B."}
