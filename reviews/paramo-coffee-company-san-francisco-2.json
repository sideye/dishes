San Fran is not lacking in a selection of fantastic coffee, so deciding on my morning coffee stop is always a decision between excellent, superb, and phenomenal. I saw the reviews of Paramo and decided to give it a try. I was impressed that they used Califia Farms almond milk and anytime I can eliminate dairy without a knock to my coffee enjoyment, I'm game. \n\nThe shop is small and narrow. I ordered a light roast filter coffee with almond milk and the cashier asked if I wanted the almond milk steamed, which was a great touch. The minus one star is for something I realized when I looked at my receipt in my email. They charged me $0.50 for the almond milk (standard upcharge) and ANOTHER $0.50 for steaming it. I think that is petty, steaming the milk takes seconds. My small drip coffee was amazing, but $4.50 for a little coffee seems a little steep IMHO.

Coffeehouses should be dark and have a skinny woman in a beret playing performing off-key Joni Mitchell songs on a stool. But now they're more about fair trade beans, blossom brewing, and expensive scones from an artisan bakery nobody's heard of. Like Reveille and Artis, Paramo is another indy alternative to the more successful caffeine chains like Philz and Blue Bottle. And like any coffeehouse in this city, it has its followers and detractors. After two visits, I have to say I'm probably a mild follower, the timid type who would stop by if I walked by their shop in Four Embarcadero but probably not give it much thought afterward.\n\nExcept I gave it enough thought to submit this review. I tried their $2.50, 12-ounce cup of filter coffee which was their Firecracker that day (photo: http://bit.ly/1hMTj1O). They describe that one as lively, bright and juicy - though those three adjectives seem misapplied to a coffee bean, more like a fruit-flavored chewing gum. I liked the basic flavor notes of it though it tasted a tad burnt. It was not nearly enough for me to throw the coffee in the barista's face. OK, I've never done that, I swear, but it was probably not freshly brewed which at 2PM, wasn't my expectation anyway. I'm not sure what the flying donkey on the cup means, but I assume it's their response to having a skinny woman singing on a stool in here.\n\nCOFFEE - 3 stars...pretty good though a tad burnt the last time\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...not much of it unless you count their merchandise on the shelves\nSERVICE - 3 stars...quick\nTOTAL - 3 stars...perhaps when donkeys fly", "author": "Ed U."}

Chai, iced coffee, regular expresso, and even hot cocoa.  I also notice the sell the Chemex glass coffee maker, as well as my favorite the Aeropress!  \n\nI ordered from the lovely lady with a smile, and started with a simple 8oz cup of filtered coffee.

But then again, I believe all their pastries probably match well with their coffee.  Give this place a try, I guarantee you'll like it!  \n\nAnother cool thing about where this shop is located, are the wooden tables and chairs outside.

They have a great minimalist menu, which includes a single line item for Espresso + Milk, which I think is super logical!\n\nConclusion:\nDecent Third Wave shop overall.

The space is small and clean with minimal decoration. The ambience is not too cozy but it is not uninviting either. They do not have chairs inside but there are chairs out in the alley, which  is a good area to settle down and enjoy their coffee.\n\nYou can tell that the staff are fiercely proud of their product. Watching the barista prepare my caffe Americano with such intensity coupled with their claim of \"slow sipping coffee\" made me expect a great coffee. And they delivered. The coffee is bold without any hint of burnt bitterness. It really is a drink to savor in your mouth, much like you would with great wine.\n\nParamo is a great addition to the area and a fantastic substitute to the corporate coffee shops that surround the area.

I usually get a double espresso, but have tried the latte as well. When you get an espresso to stay, they give you a side of seltzer water, which is a nice touch and helps keep the palate fresh. I like the dark roast and the rich (but not too much) crema, but I really enjoy the sour finish to their espresso. It's almost enough to cause you to squint, but not quite. It's definitely a \"hurts so good\" kind of experience if I may be so bold as to quote JC Mellencamp.  \n\nThe service is fantastic and the staff/owners are very knowledgeable and passionate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-18", "description": "If you're serious about coffee, this is where you want to be.\n\nParamo carries 7 distinct lines of coffees, one of which is a decaf and another is an espresso blend. They go down the line from full bodied and toasty to the light and floral fruity beans. They seem to rotate the origin of their blends based on grower availability, so the bag of Stargazer (my favorite) may come from one region one month, then another the next. \n\nThis isn't bad per se, the lines have static flavor profiles, and while you might pick some different flavors in the tasting notes as the regions change, the SPIRIT of what the coffee is supposed to evoke remains the same.\n\nI come in often enough that the staff knows me by name, they know a lot of regulars names and orders actually. They're all very nice and seem to be genuinely enthusiastic about coffee, backed up by sight of an often in use Chemex behind the counter. I'd like to see pourovers on the menu, but given the size of the shop and the volume of customers they see, it just isn't feasible. Expanding on that, the menu is very straightforward, coffee on drip, espresso, espresso+milk (it's just easier than listing every permutation), teas which I've never tried, ditto for the cocoa.\n\nThey have some wonderful pastries behind the counter, some rotate based on what fruit is in season, but I've never had one I didn't like. Try the Kouign Amann (pronounced Queen Uh Mon).\n\nThe space is small, with a maximum of four seats at the bar, but there is plenty of seating outside. Their location is pretty interesting, nestled in the Embarcadero Center right next to the Hyatt, they don't suffer the throngs of tourists Blue Bottle patrons have to elbow out of the way at the Ferry Building, or the bandwagon hype fans of the newly opened Philz on Market, but they have been successful enough to have a second location opening soon.\n\n It's the best 3rd wave coffee shop in FiDi by a wide margin.\n\nGo.", "author": "Miguel L."}

I never do this either-but I went back and asked for an americano since I couldn't drink the iced coffee due to extreme bitterness. I respectfully did this in a low voice so no other patrons could hear me. Well, the americano was also extremely bitter.

I realize they were on the \"slightly lower\" end of cost for roasters in the area at $2.50 for a 12oz beforehand, but it wasn't a steal. Couldn't you just raise it a quarter a cup-maybe 50 cents max? Charging the same price for coffee out of an urn when other shops only charge you that much if they're pouring it by hand isn't right.

The shop itself is small, but they still manage to make if feel very quaint and peaceful.  Their drip coffee is super good!  If you buy a bag of whole bean coffee from them, I recommend the firecracker!  I have not been able to get the taste of their coffee out of my head!  As a self-proclaimed coffee connoisseur, it is a must try for anyone and definitely on my top five coffee shops in the bay area.", "author": "Johnathan W."}

The latte prep was good as well, had the yamyam gluten free muffin and it was pretty solid but not dry.  Small shop, not overdone.", "author": "Tico B."}

Was hoping this would be a good competitor with Blue Bottle, but it doesn't quite measure up. Not bad at all, but for the price, it's worth walking to the Ferry Building and going for the real thing!", "author": "M D."}

Tiny place with super quick payment, emailed receipt, nice employees and you get your coffee in two seconds. I'm not even a huge fan of coffee in general but their 12oz regular drip with room for cream and a dash of sugar is something I look forward to, and I like it better than blue bottle.", "author": "Jordan H."}

I bought a bag of their Flywheel beans for $17 and am excited to try. Had a cup of their Workhorse and this blend was great - very full bodied and tasty. I would definitely go here again - it's nice to find a smaller place in Fidi and I do agree that this place is good competition to Blue Bottle, Reveille, and illy.", "author": "Lindsay N."}

Probably the best cappuccino I've had in years.  Might even be better than Abra\u00e7o, my favorite coffee place until now.  Staff are young but eager to serve with a smile.", "author": "B L."}
