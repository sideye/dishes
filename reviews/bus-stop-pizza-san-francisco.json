The original owners are still there and cranking out the BEST New York style pizza west of New York. Their sauce is authentic and their crispy thin crust is perfectly done. It's not all fancy and 'foody' or whatever. It's DAMN . GOOD. PIZZA.\nTo the Millennials and hipster kids: so the place isn't paneled with reclaimed beach wood or whatever..you want a good slice of pizza? THIS is where you go.\nWhen I lived at Fell and Divisadero they pretty much were at my house with dinner 2-3 times a week (I was a bike messenger, so I could inhale calories like nobody's business). They got to know me and even would stop and pick me up a deck of smokes if I asked them. They were family and treated me as such. \nSF has changed so much, some of it good, some of it not, but Bus Stop harkens back to before the middle class couldn't live in The City. Good people, good pizza.\nDelivery available as well as a couple o' stools to sit and chat with the wonderful owners as you eat.\nStop by. You won't regret it.", "author": "Benjamin T."}

I was working on my laptop in my bed when I realized it was 7:39 PM, and I was really hungry. I thought very seriously about ordering soup at a Chinese restaurant a 10 minute walk away but 1) remembered my roommate saying about an hour earlier that it was drizzling and 2) realized I had no desire of waiting 40+ minutes to eat (20 minutes round trip and 20 minutes to prepare my order). I therefore called up Bus Stop Pizza to put in my order, was told it would take 10 minutes, and promptly rolled in in my college t-shirt, grey sweatpants, Hunter boots, and a black trench coat. Within 6 minutes, I was back in my kitchen stuffing pesto and sausage pizza slices (two separate slices, though I'm sure they'd be happy to make you one slice with both) in my mouth. It was great. While Bus Stop Pizza may have a reputation for being great drunk food, I've only had it while sober, and I still think it's excellent. It's not gourmet pizza, but it's just so freakin' cheesy and delicious, and the slices are gigantic. My personal favorites are the pesto and the Bus Stop specialty slice.", "author": "Kelly R."}

That said, the biggest advantage to Bus Stop is its location: across the street from my house. Their veggie slice is $3.50 and is loaded up with non-sauteed, non-canned mushrooms, black olives, peppers and onions. It is perfectly fine and functions as a meal substitute for me once a week, but it is NOTHING, NOTHING like New York pizza. It tastes more like Chicago pizza to me, because the crust is kind of buttery.\n\nOtherwise, the store has various shady-looking salads and canned and bottled sodas. What I do like about the place is that I invariably end up getting into conversations with Divisidero denizens while waiting the ridiculously long-seeming 10min it takes to heat up a single slice. I have discussed the popularity of the World Cup, the fog, the election in Mexico and What To Do About the Homeless while waiting here. Your other option is sitting and reading the Guardian.

Bus Stop Pizza, as you can probably infer by the name, isn't the highest quality pizza joint in town. These are (technically) NY slices since they're built to the right proportions (I can't tell you how many times I've been dissapointed to open an SF pizza box to find a slice that's smaller than my face). And these are the staple ingredients of pizza, but the taste is off. Separately, the (pass the) tarty sauce, flour-caked crust, and milky cheese are pretty narsty, but it all comes together in a way that makes me come back to Bus Stop anytime I want a quick slice. Without toppings, mind you, since this place can't put anything on a pizza properly. \n\nWait, why am I giving this place a 3-star review again?", "author": "David R."}
