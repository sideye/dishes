All of the staff are lovely and helpful, and they make a great latte which is my drink of choice. I'm lactose and they have several milk substitute options including soy, almond and coconut. The only bummer (and this is something I've noticed at other coffee houses in San Francisco) is that they don't sell sizes here. Everything is the same tall/maybe grande cup size. I wish I could get something more!\n\nThe layout of Flywheel is huge. There are several large tables in front and an outdoor space as well with several more spots to sit down. Definitely a place you could come with large groups and you wouldn't feel guilty taking up space. I would also recommend coming here to do work or homework - lots of front window bar space and stools to sit. Even when it's busy, there are usually still a few open spots.\n\nThe menu of drinks is located on the whole and they also sell small food items/baked goods. I have never had anything to eat but I've been tempted by their savory items: pizza danish and ham and cheese croissant.\n\nOpen on Labor Day too which was nice because a few of my other regular spots were not.

The dude behind the counter was in a zone by himself, sauntering and grooving from station to station almost aimlessly because of his glacial pace despite the long line.

So remember, good for one, difficult for more.\n\nOn a spectrum of acidic to not, the spectrum which I realize is different for each coffee drinker, the beans here tend to be on the more acidic side. But go from coffee to espresso and the acidity becomes more nuanced, perhaps hidden by the frothy milk. Not good or bad per say, but really just a footnote in taste.\n\nThere's a small outdoor section in the back with 3 or so small tables meant for parties of 2.

The espresso was super dark and flavorful-- I'm not used to being able to taste the flavor notes of espresso in my lattes, but I was able to here! If you like sweet lattes, this won't jive well with you, but I thought it tasted delicious. The nitro was tasty as well and definitely over-caffeinated me. Honestly, I've had better nitro, but for around $5 it's not a bad deal.\n\nOnce you order your coffee, there's a good variety of seating options to take (small 2 person tables with a booth, long tables with tall stools, etc etc). There's also a small patio out in the back if you want some sunshine. From the looks of the crowd, it seems like most people who opt to order their coffee \"for here\" are busy at work on their macbooks. The use of macbooks might be the pre-requisite for fitting in at Flywheel, but is also necessary as there is a definite lack of outlets.\n\nThere is free wifi-- it turns off after a certain amount of time, but you can always ask the staff for another access code. There is also free water, but the mason jars you use as a cup are pretty tiny.

It's not cheap to say the least with a basic cup at $4. But that's SF right? However, that black cup of Ethiopia blend containing hints of blueberry and chocolate is carefully crafted via pour over instead of the standard drip coffee. \n\nNot only is their pour over awesome, but the HIGHLIGHT must be their nitro cold brew. I detest cold caffeine, but their cold brew honestly made me give iced coffee a chance. Sadly, no cold brew has made me swoon like theirs, therefore, I'll be sticking to flywheel. With a selection of amazing pastries, flywheel has everything: so much space from the front, tall tables offering copious natural light to the tables situated right across from the brewing action to the back room and patio perfect for larger groups. I often stop by and hunker down to compose emails and to get some serious studying done. \n\nA small caveat is that it is one of THE most hipster coffee shops I have ever been to with special siphon contraptions and the aesthetic architecture and vaulted ceilings.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-27", "description": "As much as I love a good cup of joe, I'd be lying if I said I was a coffee connoisseur.  While I can easily tell the difference between the likes of Blue Bottle, Starbucks, and the \"coffee\" from those Keurid pods (both gross and an environmental menace), my palette definitely isn't sophisticated enough to pick up on the nuances of grinds and beans from around the world.  However, if I were to spend more time at a place like Flywheel?  Perhaps I could start!\n\nSimilar to the likes of Blue Bottle and so many of the city's other \"hipster coffee shops\", Flywheel is quite a bit nicer than your typical neighborhood spot.  The space is decently large and spacious with a modern commercial/industrial sort of look.  Their relative wealth of tables and high tops also make them a good spot for camping out, but all of the meters and restrictions on nearby parking put a damper on that.  Most importantly though, the coffee is pretty good!\n\nOffering beans from numerous countries of the world, Flywheel features a variety of coffee that you don't often see.  Of the handful of choices available, I opted to go with the TARRAZU from Costa Rica ($4.00) specifically because I wanted to see if it tasted like what I had when I was down there (it kind of did!).  While it wasn't super strong, it still packed some punch (hellooooo, caffeine!) and had a nice profile - deep, dark, and a tinge of caramel that was quite tasty.\n\nTo go with my cup of lava java, I also decided to try their CINNAMON CRUMB CAKE ($3.50).  Of all of the pastries in the case, this stood out to me the most simply because it looked so good!  And believe me when I say that it tasted even better; the crumble on top was awesome (not super heavy on the cinnamon) and the cake itself was so moist and light.  Plus, it wasn't overly sweet either, which made it just that much better.\n\nBesides the area's parking situation, Flywheel might not be the ideal option for camping out for an extended period unless you happen to be near one of the few outlets I saw (though, to be fair, I didn't make a point of looking).  However, if you're just looking for a place to catch up with friends or to check out their coffees?  Flywheel just might be what you're looking for.  I'm sure I'll be back again, especially for that crumb cake and to try the cold brew that so many others have mentioned!", "author": "Mike L."}

To put it simply, it's just an interesting place that emanates ~cool~.\n\nRight upon walking into Flywheel, I was mesmerized by the scientific/industrial minimalist design of the interior. Very simple, but very functional and beautiful. Though certainly a popular coffeeshop, it isn't too loud, so this place would be absolutely perfect to study/work with quick breaks to people watch. That is, if you don't think you'll be too distracted by the beautiful-looking pastries in the main case.\n\nIf you're serious about your coffee, then the place is really awesome. But if you're expecting some super sweet, artificial vanilla-caramel-mocha-frap-latte-whatever, then I don't think you'll like the drinks at Flywheel all too much. I ordered a regular latte that was very good and clearly super high quality, but I think that it was maybe a little too intense for me. The more I sipped it, though, the more I began to like and appreciate it. I also had a sip of my friend's breve, which was good but also much stronger that I'm used to. I noticed that there definitely appeared to be a split between my friends, with the more serious coffee lovers enjoying their drinks much more so than the rest of us that view coffee as just a casual treat. \n\nDespite me (much to my chagrin) having to add extra sugar to my latte, I like Flywheel. It's nice to taste what good, pure coffee is supposed to be (especially at their really great prices). But with their small niche menu, it isn't a spot for everyone, especially if you're used to coffee drinks tasting more like dessert.", "author": "Desiree S."}

The space is considerably large and there are outlets throughout the shop, so Flywheel could be a go-to spot if you're looking for a place to work or study on the weekdays.\n\nAfter a few moments of contemplating, I decided to get the Siphon just because it's not something you see every day. It was cool to see them make the coffee, and they bring it to you in the pot for you to pour into the accompanying glass mug. The coffee itself was pretty mellow in flavor; it wasn't very bold, so if you're into stronger-tasting coffee then this probably isn't the best option for you. I did enjoy it myself, as it is definitely a unique way to experience coffee. I don't think I'd get it again simply because of the hefty price tag, but it was fun to try. On top of having a unique selection of drinks, the pastry case was loaded with goodies, but I wasn't hungry during my visit so I didn't get anything to eat even though everything looked so good.\n\nI didn't get to try their cappuccino, which I use as my comparison point between coffee shops, so I'm a little hesitant to give Flywheel a full five stars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-15", "description": "oh my. Flywheel literally blew my mind with the siphon option this past weekend.  In need of finding a new place to venture out to, I ended up in the Haight where I got to see the remnants of Day 1 of the Haight Street Festival and the beginnings of Day 2. Flywheel has been on my radar for awhile now, but given how far it is from me in South Beach, coming out here was definitely a commitment.  Not one to shy away from an adventure, my husband and I decided to go with a few \"non-traditional\" items in ordering the Nitro Cold Brew and the Siphon option listed on their woodblock menu board.  We also had a blueberry muffin and a bran muffin to share.  While the pastries were just OK (not anything out of the ordinary from what specialized SF coffee shops are serving up these days), the coffees were definitely different from what I've had before.  The siphon process is time-consuming, so be prepared to wait awhile for this to come if you catch them during their busy time.  The cold brew has A LOT of caffeine and will chase away any notion of a hangover you might have after finishing their large Mason jar's worth of this potent stuff. But the siphon. I can't. \n\nIf you find yourself here, stay awhile and enjoy people watching. With it being so close to Kezar and the park, there's absolutely no shortage of \"interesting\" things and people that pass by on the street.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-16", "description": "Unlike that Flywheel cycling class I went to, the Flywheel Coffee Roasters live up to the hype. I'm actually not sure if this place has any hype but it should!\n\nFlywheel has a great vibe to the whole place. I dropped in on a Sunday evening. Most people were working independently or in small groups which I typically prefer since it promotes a productive environment. \n\nService was solid and their pastries seemed popular. I was sitting at the counter so I could watch them make coffee during my stay. It's quite entertaining. \n\nWhen I go to coffee shops for the first time (and if you read my other reviews), I typically try 2 cups of coffee: the latte and a drip. Today was a little different. I ordered up 2 Siphons ($6 each) and a Nitro coffee ($4-5, I forget which). I've had both styles from several different places in the past. Both styles were very good and met my expectations. I will explain how each works at the end of my review I case anyone was interested. \n\nIf you're visiting for the first time, I strongly suggest the Nitro coffee because it's basically a cold brew that offers a better drinking experience.   If you desire on the Siphon, you get to (or forced to?) choose which beans to use. I recommend the Kenyan because it has a nice, mellow flavor. If I were to go back, I would try the pour over instead of a Siphon because it's mostly a cool gimmick IMO. \n\nOne criticism I had was that the wifi disconnects every 30 min or so without warning. It'd be helpful if they state that somewhere so I know when my google doc isn't being saved anymore. \n\nBottom line is to check this place out of you like coffee. It's a good experience. \n\nOKAY, stop here if you don't care about the technical stuff because I'm about to flex some knowledge (hopefully, I say everything correctly). \n\nFor the bean options, Your options are the Kenyan, a Costa Rican, and a Ethiopian. There's nothing special about these because of their quality to price point. They, or similar options, are roasted by most of the popular roasters (Blue Bottle, Sightglass, etc.). The difference is usually how the beans are roasted and the brew temperature and duration. I won't get into all those details but just know that how the beans are roasted makes this place unique, not the beans themselves.\n\nNITRO: The process is pretty simple to explain. You take a cold brew, keg it, then use nitrogen to force the cold brew through a modified stout head (stout = beers like Guinness). No, the coffee isn't carbonated but it does have a nice bit of head / foam on top because of the tap. When you drink a Nitro Coffee, you'll first experience the light aromas in the foam along with the foam texture which will be followed by the stronger flavors of the coffee on the back end. I think the nitro helps bring out the flavors in the grounds but that could just be in my head.\n\nSIPHON: Pretty much the same thing you do when you run out of gas. Just kidding. Okay this process is more sciencey version of a French press but it's conceptually simple. Okay, so there's an upper chamber and a lower chamber that are connected to be airtight. The upper chamber has coffee grounds in it while the lower chamber has purified water. As the water heats up in the lower chamber, the water has nowhere to go except to escape to cooler climates in the upper chamber with coffee. This is the \"siphon\" effect. The system continues to be heated while the coffee brews in the upper chamber. Once the coffee is ready, the heat is removed and the brewed coffee drips back into the lower chamber with the help of gravity. There's usually some type of filter in between the two chambers but there doesn't have to be. BAM, coffee is done. Now, let it sit for about 5-10 min for it to be at a drinkable temperature and enjoy. This process takes a long time but I probably wouldn't get it again from Flywheel.\n\nOther notes: The barista told me the Siphon process removes the acidity which doesn't make any sense.  I'm pretty sure that the acid is reduced because of the longer brew time during a Siphon. This can be done with other brew methods. I'd probably just get a pour over next time and ask them to increase the brew time since  cheaper.", "author": "Chris W."}

Think stark with some reclaimed wood and welded iron elements. I can see why some people would find it cold or off-putting but I actually like the space a lot. Definitely conducive to working or meeting up with people.\n\nWhat I am not a big fan of, however, is the drink quality and prices. \n\nOne of the first times I came here, I ordered a Yerba Mate Latte, for some reason assuming the quality would be higher because of its price and the general atmosphere of this place. I was unpleasantly surprised to see that it came from some weird premix you could get from Safeway or some such place.\n\nThe coffee and espresso, from what I can remember, is decent, though it's pricey and you really don't get all that much for what you pay for. Everyone walking around with Flywheel coffee to go is toting it around in this miniature 8oz cup.\n\nThe nitro is interesting, it's kind of like coffee soda, but unlike soda, it leaves a weird bubbly feeling in the back of your throat that doesn't go away immediately. Even a sample of it was enough to get me jacked, I can't imagine how people drink an entire serving of the stuff without having an anxiety attack. \n\nToday I came in early on in the morning and ordered a tea, which was Mighty Leaf, and was $3. Even if you're going to serve the most basic, easily acquired brand of tea in a fancy Bodum mug, it does not justify $3. Also, it doesn't allow much wiggle room for one to tip, which is something I typically do with service industry people. But I'm not about to slap down $4 for a cup of Mighty Leaf Tea.\n\nThe tea was served to me SCALDING hot (burned the very tip of my pinkie in an attempt to test the temperature) with no warning. I'm glad I didn't bump into anything or else I may have ended up with a 3rd degree burn, not even joking. \n\nI'm not sure what the appeal is to playing the most cheesy and explicit R&B/rap music at 9:30 am, but I'd suggest coming prepared with headphones.\n\nAfter about 15-20 min of waiting for my tea to be remotely cool enough to sip, I was disappointed with how bland it was. It is beyond me why 80% of cafes and eateries choose to use this company for their teas.\n\nSo yeah, not the best place for tea or anything other than coffee (I can't speak to their hot chocolate or mochas).

Well, at least they have one thing going for them: consistency.\n\nLet's talk service. Good service is when you look a customer in the eye, smile, answer any questions politely and cheerfully before actually rendering a service in exchange of currency. We did get our lattes eventually, so I guess they understand the last part of the concept but the rude, almost-hostile young woman who took 'care' of us added an extra shot of bitterness to the already bitter coffee for us. She could not be bothered to tell us what the available pastries were and seemed irritated when we asked what was in the pastries. Hey \"lady\", some people have dietary restrictions. Also, knowing the name and ingredients of the pastries sold at the coffee shop where you work isn't a trade secret. Sharing them with customers will not violate your NDA with Apple/Google/Tesla. We ended up ordering just 2 lattes because not a single person behind the counter could be bothered to actually tell us what was in the food items.\n\nThe lattes when they arrived were decent enough. Nothing to touch something from an Intelligentsia or any other really good coffeeshop but not so bad that we couldn't drink it. I was surprised that they actually roast their own beans because the flavor profile was flatter and staler than freshly roasted beans should be. Maybe they save the old beans for out of town visitors along with their crappy service.\n\nThe space is actually quite large for San Francisco and there is plenty of light in the front through the big plate glass windows but the layout of the counters and tables is weirdly inefficient. Not that I care. I don't plan to ever go back to this place but you might if you want to work from there.  \n\nMaybe we just weren't lucky or Yelp is not as reliable as it used to be but we found most higher end coffee places in San Francisco to be lacking in one department or another compared to places in Chicago, Seattle, Portland and yes, Atlanta. Only contraband coffee in Nob Hill seemed to have the magical three part formula down pat: good baristas, good coffee and a welcoming atmosphere. \n\nFlywheel, you have the honor of holding up the other end of the spectrum. Hey, at least you're not lost somewhere in the fat, middle part of the curve.", "author": "Buddhi G."}

Even when he pulled out the sign and realized it was wrong he just played it off and didn't even apologize for basically calling me stupid in the most condescending way possible. Then the man who was ringing me out had the rudest attitude going on asking me what my order was again and acting like I was wasting his time by even being in the shop. \n\nThe whole all-male staff that was working that day were a bunch of rude, snobby, condescending employees.

They hadn't taken our names or anything, so I double checked as I was ordering and confirmed with the cashier that I would wait to hear a second matcha called. She appreciated that (yes, I really AM that responsible and considerate). I waited the usual ten minutes, saw the first girl take hers, and then grabbed the next one. As I was turning to leave, the guy shouted after me, \"Wait, did you want almond milk?\" Thinking he was about to apologize for almost giving me a tummy ache, I came right back, ready to reassure him that it wasn't a problem. But no. He said, \"I didn't say that one was almond milk.\" Okay, no big. You guys are busy and stressed out.

I FINALLY get mine, and he says sorry, then I smile and say, \"That's okay--I'm sorry I took the wrong one!\" Then he looks at me, nods, and gives me a yeah-you-should-be glare (was that an eye roll as you turned away, bro?).

I came here based on the raves for the coffee and the location/space itself, figuring the low reviews were outliers--but they seemed to be pretty on-point. \n\nThe place itself has a completely standoffish, sterile vibe. It's not warm and welcoming, despite the design touches to the contrary (the now-cliche warming Edison bulbs, wood paneling, the outdoor patio area), and the day of my visit the counterstaff wasn't either.  The space is very roomy, spacious even, but there's a lot of it that is unused. The layout doesn't allow for much communal interaction, either. I had expected to see a lot of laptops based on other comments but was surprised at how many there actually were--just about everyone had a laptop flipped open, as if it was a requirement to be there. I was there to meet with a friend and have a conversation over a cup of coffee but the vibe just didn't feel right for this. \n\nI had some rudimentary inquiries about the coffee available, expecting them to sell me on a particular varietal/region. The \"third wave\" coffee 'trend' is all about nuances of flavor from different regions and styles of roasting, and it seems at most places I've visited even if they don't roast the beans they will share some impressions of what they're brewing with some semblance of enthusiasm. Not here. I received the equivalent of a \"meh\" and a shoulder shrug in the guise of 'we hope it's good'.  Come on, people, get excited about what you're serving!\n\nAs I was planning on staying in I didn't expect to see them pouring my coffee in a paper cup. But as soon as I realized they only had plastic mugs I immediately recanted. Plastic? Who does that? Outside of the kiddie cups at a family restaurant I don't expect to be served coffee in a plastic mug, period. Even the low-cost greasy spoon has ceramic mugs. They need to do the same.

Also, this review is soley based on the roasting skill and price of Flywheels whole-bean products. I grind and make my own coffee daily (multiple brewing styles) and buy 1/2 pound of fresh roasted beans weekly. Purchasing weekly ensures that my beans are always extremely fresh and full of oils and are,attics that are lost over time.\nFlywheel usually has 3 varieties of bean available at any one time. My 2 favorites are usually roasted on Mondays and Tuesdays. Without fail, the beans are always roasted to perfection (usually a \"medium\" roast) and is always finished based on what is best for the bean. The cost of $16 per pound is amazing for this quality. I have compared EVERY roaster in the city and Flywheel wins on price and quality. Others may have more variety, but charge nearly double for their beans and either don't have the consistent quality or ability to sample the aromatic product prior to purchasing. Flywheel is a winner in my book, and I always kick myself when I choose to try another roaster. I always come back to the best. Thanks for the great product!!", "author": "Moses A."}

It has a slightly burnt \"left-it-in-a-pot-on-the-warmer\" taste, and is lacking the faint sour, acidic tartness and complex notes that the coffee snob in me prefers. At least they know to make a strong americano ($2.75) by default. Instead of an italian porcelain cup, they put it in a double-walled Bodum glass, which works well. I assume the coffee will get better once they start roasting their own.\n\nThe price is a little high but you're paying for the power plugs. I believe a Sightglass americano costs the same; most places charge 10-20% less ($2.25- 2.50). (Duboce Cafe takes the prize as the worst deal in SF for a $3 watered down americano in a 10 oz. glass mug, and they removed their power outlets years ago.)\n\nBut you know, once everyone gets a 10-hours-on-a-charge iPad, then those outlets won't matter.", "author": "Tom P."}

Free wifi that is fast and usually reliable, drops out sometimes. Clean bathroom. No bums or hippies come in to stink up the place.\n\nDrink-wise, everything I've had has been stellar. Iced tea is refreshing and comes in a variety of flavors. Coffee blends have nice, smooth, fruity flavors. Best coffee in Haight-Ashbury and second only to Philz in the city. In my opinion.\n\nThey take their time brewing your coffee right, so don't expect to run in and be back out in 2 minutes.

Turns out I missed the wooden sign they stand up at the edge of the sidewalk, but despite the initial confusion I've been walking or biking over here for a few weeks now and have a few points:\n\nFirst, their coffee is pretty damn good. I can't say it's the best in the city but definitely the best I've had on this side of Market St (and when you're getting to this level of rating it's really the difference between a 9.9 and a 10). I havn't tried any of their espresso drinks other than a cappuccino, but it was definitely up to expectations.\n\nComing from an architecture background, the environment inside is admittedly a bit sterile. I personally love the Edison style bulbs and the mix of wood/concrete, but there's an excess of unused open space that isn't even well suited to standing around and talking. I'm regrettably one of the laptop crew that frequents this place, and as many people have noted we're a large portion of the shop.\n\nI think they've got a great location, the right coffee, and with the addition of more seating and some laptop restrictions (I know I'm shooting myself in the foot here) could make it a much more welcoming place for those just looking to chat over their Sunday morning coffee.", "author": "Robert N."}

I understand that pour over coffee takes time - but they do not have a system down yet to take multiple orders.  Also, the light roast was sour.  I will update this review when I go another time.", "author": "Tia B."}

Each cup of coffee is freshly brewed for each customer. Among my favorite beverages are an iced white mocha, hot mocha, and the blackberry coffee. The interior and equipment are very modern and the cafe is a popular place for getting work done on the computer.  I give flywheel my highest recommendation.", "author": "Amber B."}

It has such a cool exterior and wide eyed customers looking out from their glass window seats.  There isn't a sign on the door, only a wooden one, standing on the sidewalk welcoming you in.  Which if you don't read, could make you miss this place.  I used to think it was some random start-up company that was way too skool for cool. Every time I walked by I always peered in dreaming of the day I can step inside.  I wanted to be with the cool kids.  Well, that day came.  I was in need of a good go to coffee shop to do some work and was accessible by foot.  It took me some time to think about and then I remembered, there's that cool no-name place a few blocks away.  As I entered and looked around for a table I found one close to an outlet.  I ordered my red-eye and I was given a choice of what coffee beans I wanted.  I chose the Costa Rican one.  I sat down, set up my station, ate my blueberry scone and retrieved my coffee.  \"Delicious\".  I'm satisfied.  The things I like about this place:\n\nFriendly staff\nGreat place to study or work\nUnique layout\nBig open windows\nPlenty of outlets \nSteel and wood design - my favorite thing about this place\nComfortable enough to spend hours there\nGood coffee and pastries - this should be at the top\n\nI'm going back.  I think I've found my go-to place.  Finally, I don't have to drive around in circles looking for a parking spot anymore.  Yay!  Thumbs up.", "author": "Marita S."}

Strong coffee that is at the same time smooth and luxurious - not bitter - and it's the perfect way to start your day.  It's that kind of coffee that just makes you feel good at the first sip - rich, flavorful, rejuvenating.  A much different experience than most coffee in the city.  \n\nThe coffee at Flywheel is about 100 times better than the coffee at the Whole Foods next door - sorry, I love that Whole Foods but the coffee at Flywheel is on an entirely different level.  Flywheel is just better.  I think they have access to better beans and their owner has a ton of experience in the coffee industry.  It also opens earlier than Whole Foods.\n\nIf you're at Whole Foods buying something and you feel like you need a pick-me-up, walk next door for the coffee at Flywheel.  You won't regret it.  They also have great baked goods, try the pumpkin bread and the homemade bread pudding. Plus it's right next to GG park, a great place to hang out, meet with friends, or just quietly enjoy the neighborhood.  This is the next hot coffee spot in SF and it's already attracting a crowd of dedicated customers and fans.\n\nHighly recommend.  Check it out!", "author": "Matt S."}

Also, a certain nearby grocery store had not yet opened (grmph), so I needed a place to defrost after a GGP workout and get some breakfast. Despite its hipster vibe, the two folks behind the counter were perfectly friendly, which almost made up for the $4 price tag for a small mocha and $3 price tag for a gluten- and soy-free muffin. Almost. I hadn't had a mocha in several years, and it turns out I no longer like chocolate in my milky espresso. BUT, I deigned to scraped the chocolate sludge off the bottom of the cup for review purposes, and I can report that it was mighty tasty indeed. (You're welcome.) The muffin, though gluten- and soy-free, was decidedly not sugar-free. Goodness, that was one SWEET muffin. Even for my sweet tooth. It was also very cold, which is no good for a baked treat. Alas. However, at the 7ish AM hour, the place was pretty quiet, and the seating and space was comfy and cozy.

I was quickly deflated however, as the plastic white chairs were set up inside... and there they remained.  The coffee was T.E.R.R.I.B.L.E.  I ordered a cappuccino and they poured in air-foamed milk and then the espresso shot on top of the milk!!  I had a foamy milk (not the smooth, velvety milk delivered by experienced baristas, mind you) with a black hole in the middle where the gritty, burnt shot had been poured.  SO DISAPPOINTING. To compare Flywheel to Ritual Roasters or Site Glass is an embarrassment at best.  I was sincerely hoping for a hip, quality coffee house in the Haight, as I have been waiting forever.
