I will never come back here ever.\n\nI placed a mobile order at this Starbucks around 6pm on Sunday, October 7th. When I arrived to the stonestown mall to pick up my order, all the doors to the mall were locked and I saw security escorting people out early, still around 6pm.  The mall was closed but the Starbucks still accepted my mobile order.  \n\nI did not want to be charged stars for a coffee I didn't even drink (through no fault of my own), so I came back today 10/10/18 to let them know what happened. I told the barista that my mobile order was accepted, but the mall was closed so I could not pick up my drink.\n\nThe female barista with glasses and a beanie told me that it was impossible because the mall closes at 7pm. She told me that I was probably just trying to get a free drink and there was no way to tell for sure if I actually came and picked up my drink that day. \n\nWHY and how could I make this up!? How rude to claim that I was lying just to get a free drink! She ended up calling her manager who told her to make me the drink. I drink Starbucks almost every day. Why would I go through all that trouble just to get a free drink! I literally just wanted the drink I ordered and do not appreciate being ripped off. This barista was the most clueless person on planet earth!\n\nThis whole situation is completely ridiculous. Horrible customer service and the rudest barista that I have ever seen at a Starbucks or anywhere for that matter.

The place was a wreck but I figured they were busy. My 12 year old hates whipped cream so he ordered without. Now some history, he has ASD, social exchanges are difficult so we have worked hard for him to be able to interact like neurotypical people, and to advocate for himself, so when they added whip cream he wanted to ask the barista to fix it. He purchased the counter and says to the barista, \"I ordered without whip cream and this has whip.\" As he hands it to her she looks down in disgust and says, \"can you remove the straw?\" I thought that was odd, she takes the drink and removes the lid and begins scraping the whip cream into a trash bin , then she takes a spoon and begins to spoon the cream off at which point I ask her to just remake it. She stops throws the cup in the trash violently and says, \" Okay but I have to make ALL the other drinks before his!\" I'm sorry but didn't they make the mistake?

Completely and utterly off Starbucks branding expectations! There were 5 workers in their little module and only 2 were actually doing their job. They had a male barista doing all of the drinks while close to about 8-10 customer were waiting for their drinks. As this was taking place, the other 3 female workers were too busy yapping amongst each other. \n\nAt one point, a customer returns their empty milk canister to the cashier and she states \"um, you're supposed to return this to the drink area!\" Oh, that makes perfect sense... give it to the guy who trying to catch up on everyone's drinks so you can continue to chat with another coworker and act like your busy. In addition, why are you correcting a customer about where to leave YOUR empty milk canisters??? \n\nSince the barista was overly busy making drinks, he couldn't even properly refill the canister, but instead hands the customer a cup of milk to be used. Below customer service expectations! I really felt sorry for that kid as he had no back up help whatsoever.\n\nThen as I was leaving, the workers were playing rap music. I'm not against any sort of music but, when you have to abide by a brand such as Starbucks, this is completely unacceptable. This Starbucks in particular has some employees that don't give a crap about work efficiency or their fellow employees that actually do their job.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-09-24", "description": "I've had it with this place and Starbucks in general! This Starbucks at Stonestown has and have always had mostly rude surly employees who do minimal to acknowledge you whether they're the person taking your order or the barista making your overpriced drink. It's understandable to a certain point as they are very busy and pumping out drink after drink and need to go fast but even if you're that busy, firstly do your best to try and be cordial to the costumers and try to make their drink to their liking each and every time. \n\nI am no longer a regular Starbucks costumer and have never bought 1 or 2 drinks every day, but I would say that I started patronizing Starbucks in the early 2000's and depending on different times and eras would buy an average of 2 or 3 drinks a week when all averaged out over the past 15 years or so with the exception of the past 2 or 3 years when I have not patronized Starbucks unless I have a gift card. So I figure I have spent minimally $4000 (star)bucks at various Starbucks since my first visit, probably much more! There are probably a lot of people who have spent $30,000 or more at Starbucks and everybody gets the same crummy service. \n\nMy sister in law gave me two $50 Starbucks gift cards on my last birthday; I've actually asked her not to give me Starbucks gift cards and suggested other gift cards she could give me including other coffee shops but she keeps forgetting. So I have only been back to Starbucks three times since my birthday last August and of course two out of three drinks were not made to my liking and if they are not I usually just have my drink and not complain or ask them to remake it unless it's really really bad. Once in a while, every two or three years I'll call up Starbucks costumer service to complain about only my very worst experiences there and the most they ever gave me was a $20 gift card and they used to send out a couple of free drink vouchers, I think over all I've gotten back a total of 50 or less including the one time I got a $20 gift card. Last time I called to complain about my recent unsatisfactory drinks and also the new Starbucks at Target Stonestown never having the stopper plugs in spite of them having only been open for a month at the time I complained and being out of them for three straight weeks,( I also often bring my mom a latte in the morning and need the stoppers to keep the drink hot and from splashing. ) The guy on the phone didn't even offer me anything in compensation at all! I was there like \"um .. OK .. \" waiting for him to offer a couple of vouchers but never did and said \"Is there anything else I can help you with today? Well okay now, have a nice day\" Whatever! I don't need the the $10 in vouchers, especially considering I have spent thousands of dollars at Starbucks. It's just the thought, the acknowledgment of understanding a valued costumers frustration and wanting to do something to make it right. \n\nI recently had a one time problem with a small business to which after reading a negative update which I downgraded from a five star to a 2 star rating from a bad experience with an Art School/day care business, the owner reached out to me and my nieces parents and was extremely friendly and apologetic taking full responsibility and wanting to make things right again, and actually offered us a package of 4 hours of FREE art lessons on the house as a kind  act of benevolence and a very sincere apology worth about $100, Now THAT\"S the way to rectify a mistake! And that is a very small business compared to Starbucks.\n\nOh yeah, about my last bad experience here and why I decided to write a 1 star review. Yesterday I ordered an iced white mocha with no whip cream and light on ice. First I waited for 15 minutes, a long wait even for Starbucks. I noticed that at least 4 people who ordered behind me all got their drinks before me, I kept looking over from the side and kept seeing a couple of plastic venti cups just sitting there near the register not moving for at least ten minutes. I saw the guy finishing a drink to which I thought it was the other persons who ordered a cold venti drink because the guy filled the cup with \"a little more\" than half with liquid content which is not \"light on ice\" As the other costumer grabbed at my cup asking if it were his soy milk latte or whatever, the barista said no, it's a white mocha to which I said \"I ordered a white mocha light on ice and he rudely says \"that IS light ice\" to which I knew he was wrong but wasn't going to stand there and argue, so I took it and left! tasted like shit too! after finishing my drink which is really less than a tall in actual liquid content I clearly saw that half \"HALF\" the cup was filled with ice which is in no way a light on ice drink, and that's with ice in the drink melting down over 10-15 minutes as well. The blond guy with facial hair needs to be retrained! He sticks his dirty hands inside the cups, doesn't know how to properly make drinks and is rude.", "author": "David A."}

I can see this location is a kiosk which gives no extra room for additional baristas. They do have the potential to expand this location. I usually get Hot or Ice Coffee at this location, but they are very slow in getting orders out. Hot Coffee is standard, but the wait in line to order is very long and mobile ordering does not help. It seems to me that when I order Ice Coffee, they tend to not add the milk and would normally tell you to add it yourself. This location is very busy and is usually understaffed. Don't bother ordering Frappuccinos here, it seems that their blender is always \"broken\", but it's more like they don't want to wash the blender after making Frappuccinos. I understand from what most Starbucks baristas complain about is washing the blenders. There is another Starbucks location outside of the mall inside the Target with plenty of seating and is well staffed. I think there was a reason behind the ice water signs and the policy of giving only tall sizes. I would frequently see kids hangout at the mall and they would often go to Starbucks to get Ice Water without making any purchases. No joke, I saw 5/10 orders were ice waters and they would also run out of Venti cups. There's a reason why they enforced the policy of giving only tall sizes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-26", "description": "I am a regular Starbucks customer at several locations, so much so that I have run through several gift cards that my friends and family have given me. Everything from the lunches to yogurt, sandwiches, baked goods, and various coffee and tea drinks. I love the place. However, I felt compelled to write this review because of my first bad experience ever, and I think it should be noted.\n\nI went in earlier this week during the afternoon to the Starbucks to get a yogurt and some iced tea. I happened to get an important text while I was ordering, so I was a little bit distracted. The cashier asked me if I wanted my receipt, and I said no. She said your drink will be waiting at the end. I saw an iced tea there and picked it up. Went to a table and proceeded to eat my yogurt when all of the sudden an angry woman came up to me and said \"that's my tea! you took my tea. the baristas think you stole my tea!\" I was like - omg I must have picked up the wrong drink!\n\nI went to the barista and told her I picked up the wrong drink. She said, what did you order, and when I told her, she said, \"no you didn't. You stole a drink.\" I said \"no, I ordered an iced tea just a few minutes ago and I ordered it from that cashier. I just picked up the wrong iced tea\". She said, \"where is your receipt?\" I didn't have it. Ugh! She continued to dress me down as a thief and refused to help me at all until someone I assume was the manager came up and asked what was happening. Within a few minutes it was resolved - he had the cashier look up my order and confirm to everyone that I did indeed order a drink. While they were making it, this barista was back there talking angrily to the manager. I assume she still thought I was an iced tea thief. \n\nWhat bugs me about this experience is the unfriendly atmosphere and automatic assumption that a customer \"stole\" something instead of looking into what happened and assuming that it was just as I said it was, a misunderstanding and accidental pick up of a drink. Whether this is due to poor management of the orders, I don't know. Whatever the case, I was truly offended and will AVOID the Stonestown Mall Starbucks after this experience, sadly. It was a favorite place but now has a really bad vibe after such a nasty accusation. Too bad.", "author": "Mary Q."}

Unlike a stand alone where you have 1 person in charge of pastry, one or two at the register, 1 preparing the drink and 2 people making the drinks. So yes, it will be a little slower - especially if there's a line with people in front of you (oh the calamity! People in front of YOU!). You're not special. Be patient.", "author": "Ian B."}

So, I am a regular but I have worked at (6) different malls and they by far have the best service out of every mall I have worked at. They all know me by name & are super friendly. So they usually know my order. I love all most the whole crew from shift leader Mandy, Amanda (Asian), Scottie, Dillon, Rudy & both Nieko's. Little Nieko's makes the most mouth watering coffee ever. They all can make a pretty good coffee. I think Mandy, Dillon & Nieko make them the best. There great I would highly recommend them if your looking for great coffee and excellent service. Everyone is so sweet here. Best Strabucks ever! I have worked at Newpark & Stoneridge,  3rd Market, San Francisco Centre (Westfeild) & this Starbucks is by far the best.\n\n-Elena", "author": "Elena A."}

If you read back through all of the negative reviews of the Stonestown Starbucks, all you see is a bunch of freakin whiners.  Yelp has become a place for idiots to congregate and talk about things they don't understand and have any patience for.  Here.. let me briefly explain/address/answer practically every single thing all you complainers have nit picked about this starbucks:\n\n1. \"The prices are more expensive\" -  Than WHAT?!  It's the same exact prices as every other starbucks in the city.  It's STARbucks... you seriously going to complain about this particular locations prices?\n\n2. \"They greeted the person in front and behind of me, but not me\" - Maybe if you showed a smile or some courtesy they'd show some back.  It's called manners, and baristas aren't the only ones who are expected to have them.\n\n3. \"The line is always long\" - Oh.. gee... that sucks you recognize this spot is always busy and yet choose to wait in line and then bitch about it.  Sorry they can't immediately grow the kiosk to a larger size just to address your impatience and bad time-planning on your lunch break.\n\nThat's the problem with starbucks these days... it makes customers think they have the right to bitch and moan about any little detail they don't like.  Grow a pair and, like a grown adult, tell the Barista what it wasn't like and politely ask them to do it again.  If they don't, don't come back.  It's that simple.\n\nIn any case... the employees here are nice, friendly, and if you're polite to them, they'll be nice back to you.   (ps. if you order a frap every single day, particularly with extra caramel/mocha/etc etc, don't expect to get wonderful service since you have bad taste and they're annoying as shit to make).", "author": "Matt M."}

Ahaha it's not that we cared for her to build some type of rapport with us, but we certainly didn't want an eye roll, a grunt, and an \"oh my god.\" She didn't even pay attention, so..\n\nAlthough our order came out just as expected, the service we received wasn't particularly decent. I understand that this branch is in a mall and people don't have any other choice in terms of drinks, besides soda and the like, so things get hectic at times, but come on now; shouldn't that indicate how well the baristas are supposed to treat its customers?

By the time you've consumed 3 cups of that, you can buy 1/2 lb coffee beans to make several pots of coffee at home.\nBut, it's the seasonal peppermint mocha I crave that no other coffee purveyor seems to be able to make it the way I like.  Such merriment if you add the snow, Xmas music, and omnipresent Xmas decoratons as soon as Halloween (or before) is over.  Surprisingly, the taste of the PM does vary from Starbucks to Starbucks.
