The line at 12:30 was long, but it moved relatively quickly. After reading through Yelp reviews, I settled on the roast beef sandwich - the tender, juicy-looking homemade roast beef I saw in others' photos looked irresistible. Also, given the size of the sandwich - it looks HUGE in photos - I figured I could split it into two meals, thereby taking the sting off the $12 price. I also splurged on a fresh baked walnut chocolate chip cookie. The cashier was friendly and fast in taking my order and ringing me up. \n\nVerdict:\n1. Roast Beef Sandwich: the roast beef was cooked really well and definitely met my high expectations, but there was so little of it on the bread (maybe 1-3 slices) that all I could taste was bread and pickle. Also, despite the size of the sandwich, most of the volume was bread, which meant I had to eat the entire thing to feel not hungry. Without being able to split it across two meals, $12 for an attractive but unsubstantial sandwich seemed high. \n2. Walnut chocolate chip cookie: this $2.50 splurge was the best decision I've made in recent memory! It was mind blowingly delicious - slightly crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the chocolate was melty throughout. I would go back to The Sentinel in a heartbeat, just to buy cookies. \n\nOverall, I appreciated the friendly cashier and fresh ingredients, but food-wise it was a wash between the delicious cookie and the rip off roast beef sandwich. Before writing it off completely,\nI'll probably give their sandwiches a second chance another day. \n\nNote: Bring cash! There is a $.50 up charge for using credit card.", "author": "Cindy T."}

The line is usually out the door so I suggest preordering your meal. If you are in line, they're pretty quick with their sandwich making abilities! They run out of their specialty sandwiches so I would keep that in mind if going later during the day.\n\nOne of my favorite sandwiches here is the lamb and eggplant sandwich. This comes on a soft but sturdy roll, with lamb,eggplant, and pesto sauce on the inside. The lamb isn't overwhelming so if you're expecting a intense lamb flavor, I would be disappointed. The chickpeas complement everything well. This is definitely a satisfying meal that keeps me full all day.

It should be illegal to use or repurpose the \"BLT\" acronym unless you're building off of the holy trinity of Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato. \n\nSentinel's BALT is a Basil, Avocado, Lettuce, and Tomato sandwich on a doughy roll with a heaping spread of cream cheese and a horrifying amount of mayo on it. From the first bite this was a nightmare of a sandwich - I saved half for my bf, who also didn't finish it. If you'd like the rest of it, it's still sitting in our fridge, decomposing into a cream-cheesy, mayo-soaked wad of wilted basil and sadness. \n\nOne star extra for the free pickle spear, the Andes mint, and what looked like a decent corned beef sandwich ordered by my coworker. Pickles aside, I don't plan on returning - $10 is better spent elsewhere.", "author": "Laura B."}

When I'm looking for lunch places, I want a combination of good quality for the price. By this, I mean I want a meal under $10 that will be of decent quality and a decent portion. \n\nSentinel sandwiches are a little pricey, but the portions are very generous. I'm giving it four stars because the portions are a little too big for me and as a result, the price is a little steep for me. You get what you pay for, but the food always gives me food coma for the afternoon. That's why I tend to stay away unless I want the same sandwich for lunch and dinner. \n\nHowever, the sandwiches I've had here are some of the best sandwiches I've had in FiDi. They always pack it full of filling. I've tried both the deviled egg sandwich and the Vietnamese pork shoulder. They change their menu based on the season so the sandwiches are not always available. \n\nI love deviled eggs and the sandwich did not disappoint. I would totally recommend it too if you like deviled eggs. The Vietnamese pork shoulder was also very delicious. The pork shoulder is flavorful and tender and the fillings of jalape\u00f1os and cilantro and a few other veggies really rounded out the flavor of the sandwich nicely.", "author": "Lin Z."}

In fact, it was my memory of the sandwich I ate last year that drew me from the line at a highly favored neighboring establishment and made me choose The Sentinel for lunch today.\n\nGolden brown, soft, seeded, and slightly sweet and eggy, this roll is the kind of bread I crave. The interior is pillowy soft, while the exterior provides just enough substance to hold in all of the goodness they pack into these sandwiches. The combinations are perfect, and you really can't go wrong with any of them.\n\nNot surprisingly I chose the same sandwich as I had last year, despite trying desperately not to do it. The specials were looking mighty fine but the spicy pork with carrot and celery root slaw looked too tasty to pass up again! That sandwich has a gravitational pull all its own, and it could not be avoided.\n\nNow an artisan sandwich like this deserves a side that measures up, and while Vickies potato chips are good, I opted for the house Cale chips with raisins, hazelnuts, and cumin. Turns out these are more like kale clusters, packed with all the goodness above. They were good, but not the savory accompaniment I had hoped for, though not a disappointment.\n\nThe shining star at the end of the meal though are the incredible cookies! They have the perfect texture, have a lot of chew to them, are quite large and are chock full of goodies! \n\nMmmm. Since I failed at my mission today, I may have to return again during this trip.

I wasn't too impressed by the look of the sandwich right off the bat. Not only was this sandwich very pricey ($12.00) it wasn't very appealing to the eyes and apparently my tummy (more on that later). The sandwich didn't seem like it had the best meat on it, there was way too much cabbage and the red Russian dressing was way too salty for everything overall. I ate the whole thing still, but immediately regretted it. I must have stayed the remaining four hours of work inside our local bathroom because my stomach did not like what I put in!

I mean, I think I waited something like 22 seconds from payment to sandwich in hand, ready to roll. Impressed. \n\nI ordered the pork and figs with escarole and manchego on wheat. The sandwich was large, with the meat stacked high, with yummy condiments that were a perfect fit. \n\nFor those of you watching your waistline: see if you can share with a fellow co-worker.

It's a hidden gem that is easy to miss if you're rushing down New Montgomery street but I would highly recommend you slow down and stop in! The Sentinel is a tiny, quaint spot on the corner that creates delicious muffins and sandwiches (these are the only things I've sampled on the menu, but I keep coming back for more!). \n\nThe muffins are big, freshly made, and sell out quickly. I've had the blueberry muffin and the apple cinnamon muffin, which are both so good. I'd like to try more flavors but they do sell out pretty fast.\n\nThe corned beef sandwich, which comes as a warm hot sandwich, is a personal favorite of mine that keeps me coming back. It comes with Swiss cheese and Russian dressing (and a pickle!) and is quite filling. If you time your visit right, you won't have a wait at all, but make sure to go early enough or right after the lunch rush to ensure they still have them and haven't sold out for the day.

The meat, however, was great.  \n\nOn my second visit, I decided to try the cold roast beef sandwich.  This is THE BOMB.  Again, really high-quality, delicious meat - perfectly rare - and then the various toppings are great.  In this case, I'm glad the toppings aren't super bold because the horseradish sauce isn't overpowering.

The bread was not toasted or crisp and the light sauce used for additional flavor for the pulled pork was not special or memorable.  They provide a quarter of a dill pickle, which helps with the dryness of the pulled pork...I guess.\n\n$9 was pretty pricey for a sandwich that was NOT above average and for a normal sized one - the size reminded me and looked like a burger patty.

Given that it is only open on weekdays for lunch, we met up at their shop around 12:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. While there was a small line, it moved incredibly quickly and we had our order placed in no time at all.\n\nRoast beef sandwich - 2/5 - From the cold selection, this seemed like the best option to try. It made a special note on the menu that the beef was rare in this sandwich, although none of the meat in ours was pink at all. It was all brown. The taste was average for this item and was definitely overpowered by the horseradish slathered on. I thought the beets were a strange addition and did not contribute much to the flavor, although they did alter the consistency considerably. I wouldn't order this again.\n\nSpicy pork sandwich - 3/5 - Although, I'm fairly certain that the flavor of the sauce here was mostly sriracha, it did turn out decently enough to enjoy. There is a good amount of pork here mixed in with a bunch of shredded carrots on the same bun that the roast beef came on. This bun is definitely quality bread added a lot to the taste. Eating this item was very messy and it easily fell apart, which is fine with me. Although good, I wouldn't order this again.\n\nCorned beef sandwich - 4/5 - This is the reason you will come to The Sentinel and for a few reasons it is quite impressive. One reason is that it is served on their house baked focaccia bread which is delicious. Secondly, the size of this is quite large and is served in a separate takeout container which it fills completely. The corned beef itself was good, but not the best I've had in the city. It is all mixed in with some russian dressing and cabbage. If I were to come here again, this is what I would order.\n\nOverall, The Sentinel was mostly good and I enjoyed my meal here.

We both paid for spicy pork sandwiches, received our orders, and walked back to work. When I got to the office, I eagerly ripped off the white paper encasing my sandwich only to find - to my absolute horror - not a spicy pork sandwich but a sad, limp turkey sandwich... I took a deep breath and said to myself, \"Hey! It's okay! The spicy pork is only $1 more expensive than the turkey. It's not a big deal. Let's give The Sentinel the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps today is the day I find a new favorite sandwich!\" Then, I took a bite only to find - to my absolute horror - that the turkey sandwich tasted just as sad as it looked. The sandwich was pretty much 75% bread with 2 pieces of cold turkey deli meat slapped between a chunk of cheese and a sliver of butter lettuce (not unlike the kind of lettuce you'd find in a McChicken at McDonalds). Now I'm not a chef, but I sincerely believe my 13 year old nephew could've made this turkey sandwich that the Sentinel sold for $10 (technically $11 since I thought I was getting spicy pork) whole dollars.

My absolute favorite is the Apple Cranberry. The apple sweetens the muffin dough while the cranberries add this very subtle burst of tart. These muffins are magical. Before you read this review and get your hopes up you should know the Apple Cranberry muffins were evidently discontinued a few weeks ago. Considering how much everyone I know loves these, I'm shocked at the discontinuation, but I am also hoping this is just a temporary menu change?  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING THEM BACK.\n\nThe blueberry and the strawberry muffins are also delicious. These gigantic muffins have generous portions of fruit in them. The tops are ever so slightly crunchy, and somehow even a little sweeter than what you would expect. I honestly can never decide which part I enjoy more, the cake at the bottom or the tops; And I have never been one to differentiate the two. I walk 10 minutes there and 10 minutes back twice a week just to get one. I would likely walk there more often if the Apple Cranberry muffins were still available  :) \n\nI should add the butternut squash muffins are much like a pumpkin muffin with commitment issues. If you like the taste of pumpkin bread but feel it is a little too much pumpkin for you, then these muffins are for you. I personally prefer the bold taste of pumpkin bread over these, and will more than happily stick to the other muffin options. \n\nThe chocolate brioche is really just airy bread with some melted chocolate inside, and a sprinkling of powdered sugar on top. Not bad, but not anything amazing either. There are just too many good pastries to be had in the city; I would have to give these only two stars. \n\nThe sandwiches... I have only had one sandwich - the Vietnamese Pork Shoulder. Again. It was ok, but nothing to rave about. If you like a ton of meet, they are not by any means shy about their meat portions! Although a ton of meat is not my thing, I do appreciate that they do not skimp on their ingredients. I guess worst case you take some out.

Love the old time cigar shop decor. But unlike other reviewers, it's my opinion that the famed corned beef sandwich (as praised by 7x7 Magazine's list) is just okay. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-sentinel-san-francisco?select=gtv6L2qCpifd0NsVygtW-A#9qZna9_PwC-Sh_dNKH1kDQ Too soft and mushy for my taste. Also too much mayo. I prefer the traditional version from Miller's East Coast deli much better.\n\nMany new customer are easily disappointed, because they expect every food item to be awesome. I like this place for the chef's creativity, so sometimes u get winners and some not as good. I only come here if something new sounds interesting to me (daily menu posted online). One good example was the yellowtail ceviche sandwich, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-sentinel-san-francisco?select=q1apU6nG-8vyS7LafBenmQ#q1apU6nG-8vyS7LafBenmQ which was delicious. Another good one was a pork tenderloin sandwich. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-sentinel-san-francisco?select=koL2mhTO_-tewWK6gDyi4g#koL2mhTO_-tewWK6gDyi4g But not every new gourmet sandwich creation is successful. For example, one time a curry egg salad sando was a mess and didn't taste as good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-sentinel-san-francisco?select=0bz5otBa6BScg7SipY01Zw#0bz5otBa6BScg7SipY01Zw\n\nSoups are my favorite comfort food. And this shop makes very tasty creamy soups, like pumpkin soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-sentinel-san-francisco?select=t306Q_4WN_6nl-Dd52jnNw#t306Q_4WN_6nl-Dd52jnNw and celery root soup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-sentinel-san-francisco?select=59tFnWYCMJDT9RJC-YeopQ#59tFnWYCMJDT9RJC-YeopQ And many others. For example, I still remember the delicious cucumber soup from their first week open in 2008. My only complaint is that soup portions are very modest (only 2/3 full) for the $6 price.\n\nMost lunch menu items are priced around $8-9, only the daily special plate is over $10. In my opinion, usually the specials are less successful than the sandwiches. For example, one time a scallop ceviche with cucumbers was too watery, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-sentinel-san-francisco?select=L6FMNdLDPuFP-EgpV-aRZA#L6FMNdLDPuFP-EgpV-aRZA and a pear crisp dessert was unmemorable.

I, on the other hand, am more focused on the abomination of said delicious sandwiches... using my face.\n\nBy the time I got to the menu posted on the wall outside, I didn't have much time.  I needed to think quickly and decided it was time to enter my Cyclopes mode to scour the menu.  Which one do I choose?  The Egg Salad, The Corned Beef with Cabbage... time was running out.  I made a decision on the fly and went with the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Mustard Cabbage.  I tore open the packaging to find a stacked pork sandwich.  I Wolverine'd my way through it leaving no morsels behind.\n\nOne of my other cohorts picked up an order of the Meatballs with Polenta to share.  I used my Magneto force to bring that container my way and proceeded to feast.  It tasted as though Storm was in my mouth brewing up a flavor monsoon.\n\nNeedless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch from the Sentinel and will be sure to bring my X-men team back for more.", "author": "Scotty C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-06", "description": "I found out about this place through the \"20 Epic Sandwiches to eat in SF Before you Die.\" The sandwich they recommended: the corned beef on focaccia with cabbage, Swiss, and Russian dressing. Truthfully, I wasn't a big fan so I decided to try this place out again to see if any of their other sandwiches made the cut. After coming here two more times, I have to say that I am not an ecstatic fan. Personally, I feel like this is one of those places that puts a bunch of ingredients, which are delicious on their own, together and thinks it will turn out to be an amazing product. For example, the sweetness of the Russian dressing did not go well with the corned beed and focaccia. If it was mustard or a more spicy sauce, I probably would have loved the sandwich. The other sandwich I got was the Roast Beef with onions, frisee and horseradish cream cheese. If it were a more tangier cheese that went well with the horseradish such as feta, I might have enjoyed this sandwich a little more also, but the cream cheese did not blend well and I also barely tasted any horseradish. The Tazzo was the one sandwich, which I somewhat enjoyed although still have some criticism. For example, the egg and the ham (and also the avocado that I added per recommendation of another reviewer) went very well although there was barely any ham! There were just two pieces and the rest of the sandwich was loaded with egg. Had there have been more ham, this definitely would be one of the better sandwiches I have eaten and I would be back. Sadly, I fail to see what the long line is about unless I worked in the area and there were no other options.

I'm a bit of a harsh critic when it comes to corned beef. I've been fortunate enough to try both Katz's in NY and Langer's in LA -- the gold standards of corned beef in my book\n\nThe Sentinel's corned beef sandwich is definitely a change of pace from the usual. With the first bite, the buttery foccacia bread definitely steals the show. Call me a purist, but I'm just not a big proponent of using foccacia bread as the vehicle for a corned beef sandwich. Focaccia bread excels on its own.\n\nInstead, the bread takes away from the true star of the sandwich, which should be the corned beef. Here, the corned beef seemed to lack flavor. Or, it could be that it didn't even stand up to the rich and buttery foccacia bread. The Russian dressing and sauerkraut were there, but all I could think about was how disappointed I was in the corned beef.\n\nIf I lived or worked in the area, I could see myself slowly but surely trying everything on the menu.

It was quite spicy too, which I did not mind. I did, however, object to the level of acidity in the sandwich. Maybe it was because I was really hungry and kind of stressed out, but the sourness gave me acid reflex for the rest of the afternoon. If you're into very sour food, then this will definitely be your cup of tea, but since I'm more of a savory and sweet person, not so much.

(basil, avocado, lettuce, tomato, goat cheese) sandwich on wheat, and my friend got the corned beef one along with the carrot-ginger soup. \n\nI unwrapped my B.A.L.T. sandwich, took a bite, and was like DAAAAMN this HELLA GOOD.  The basil adds some punch to it!  Very strong flavor, and I love anything with basil in it.  The avocado and whatever sauce they used in it added a nice, creamy touch to the whole thing.  The butter lettuce was crisp and scrumptious too.  The bread was solid.  It was a melody of great flavors and textures, very well-put-together and tasty sandwich.  HIGHLY recommended.\n\nI tried my friend's corned beef sandwich too, and it was also fantastic.  That's saying a lot too because I totally dislike corned beef, so to be able to almost convert me is very impressive.  The carrot ginger soup was tasty - packed with ginger flavor, which I feel like you'll either love or hate.  \n\nAnd, as an added bonus, they gave me a PICKLE and a CHOCOLATE MINT along with the sandwich!  Now, I don't especially like pickles or mints (especially chocolate ones), but I do like free add-ons, so I happily took both and made cringy faces while eating the sour.  And I guess one of the cool things about eating pickles, for me, is that I feel like they're a nice, clean, crisp finish to a meal.  \n\nI'd give this place 5 stars, but there's two things that deter me:\n\n1.) $8 SANDWICH = normal for FiDi/SOMA, but still much teh expensives to me!  It's so totally stuffwhitepeoplelike = oh god, I'm turning pasty.\n\n2.) I had a very strange interaction with one of the employees there; I'll call her E for employee:\n\nV:  I'm trying to decide between the BALT and the pork loin.  What would you recommend?\nE:  One is vegetarian, and the other one has meat.\nV: . . .(*thinks: yes, I'm not stupid*)\nV: Um. . .okay.  Well, between the BALT and the pork loin one, what would you recommend?\nE:  I like the veal sandwich.\nV: Um. . .okay.  I'll have the BALT then.  \n\nYeah, I don't know what happened there.\n\nAnyway, one more tip: for places to eat nearby, since there's no seating here (it's a hole in the wall), walk to nearby Yerba Buena Gardens for a nice outdoor lunch with a friend or with a book.\n\nBut yeah, Sentinel sandwiches.  Sure to please!", "author": "Vivian C."}

It was funny at times bc the workers would often come out and cross out certain sandwiches that are \"out of stock\" for the day, while everyone gasps in anticipation that it is not the sandwich they will be ordering. :)\n\nI tried the LAMB AND EGGPLANT with chickpea, curry, and herb pesto; and the SPICY PORK with celery root and carrot coleslaw . The best thing about the sandwich aside from its scrumptious fresh ingredients is its SOFT warm bread. Each bite is fulfilling and thorough. Loved it! In terms of drinks, the Strawberry Lemonade or plain Lemonade are fresh and thirst-quenching (and perfect balance of sweet and sourness). And what else can get better than that? The little Andes chocolate mint candy they put into the bag for a sweet finishing touch!\n\nLast little tidbit is that they only take credit cards for purchases of $10 or more, so a sandwich plus drink will satisfy that minimum perfectly.\n\nCan't wait to try this place again!", "author": "Jasmine G."}

It is literally the size of a corridor and they are serving up delicious lunch fare sandwiches both hot and cold. The signs above the store state \"cigar\" and all this other good jazz and it is right across the street from the Palace. A team I am working with have been traveling to SF all year and staying at the palace but had never noticed or been to this spot so I decided to take them here for lunch one day. \n\nI would definitely recommend showing up to this spot before 12 because the line will literally stretch around the corner and down the block. They take credit cards but it is only after you spend a certain dollar amount. I think the most noticeable sandwich and one which receives a lot of praise is the Corned Beef sandwich and for good reasons. This sandwich has corned beef, cabbage, and Russian dressing in between two large slabs of focaccia. This thing is an awesome lunch selection but definitely get ready to fall into the afternoon nap mode after 2 PM. For those looking for a lighter fare the Turkey sandwich is a nice option which was interesting because I did not think cranberry and chipotle mayo would work but it does for this sandwich. I have had a few other sandwiches here and all have been solid. This is definitely a joint that I am a fan of and somewhere I always try to hit up whenever I am in town.", "author": "Dan M."}

When I think of a corned beef sandwich, I think of dead saltiness in between two breads with some hint of meatiness from a canned beef stew. Surprisingly, The Sentinel's corned beef sandwich, is the total opposite of my imaginative description. In between two fluff and satisfying pieces of focaccia was layers and layers of corned beef topped with Russian Dressing which was tangy and sweet, balancing out with the savoriness of the corned beef, which is surprisingly not too overpowering, the marinated cabbage on the top adds a great soft crunch and a mustard-y bitterness to the whole sandwich, and the swiss cheese is just perfectly sharp enough to linger through the flavor of the corned beef. It was like nothing I have ever had before, it hit my every taste bud comfortably.\n\nIf you're like me, who believe deeply in the recommendations on yelp, with the corned beef sandwich here reviewed 350 times plus being featured on Unique Eats, YOU know YOU GOTTA HAVE IT even if the sentinel is on top of the Mount Everest.", "author": "David H."}

To my surprise, it wasn't too bad at 12:30. Rather than being wrapped around the entire block, it was more of halfway down the block situation. \n\nThe impressive part  is the fact that the staff at the Sentinel knows their customers, and is able to not only put together a rockstar menu (they had as specials smoked salmon, roast beef, egg salad, asparagus,and  tofu sandwiches along with their usuals of corned beef and lamb meatballs), but also are efficient in helping to satiate their customers' hunger and constrained lunch hours by taking your order and name ahead of time. By the time you get to the front to pay, your sammich is wrapped and ready to go in your little hands. \n\nSadly my sammich partner M was late. Which is cool, as I had come prepared with book in hand and a latte. It is pleasant standing across from The Sentinel in the sun, but beware the smokers who convene around lunch. Ew.\n\nSo I waited.\nAnd waited.\nAaaaaand waited (over an hour).\n\nIt got to the point where the girls working the counter at The Sentinel probably thought I was being stood up by my lunch \"date\".\nIn FACT, one of them came out and asked me where my friend was, and then asked if I wanted a cookie. Of course I will have a cookie! So I followed her and was about to pay for my cookie when she said,\n\n \"No worries. Do you want a refill on your coffee? It's cold outside\"\n\nHahahaha...awesome. I love the fact that the staff at this place are so cool. And took pity on me :-)\n\nWhen M finally showed up, we ordered the corned beef and the lamb feta meatball sammiches, and went halvsies like we always do. The result? Amazing flavors, from two sammiches that couldn't be more different. The corned beef was flavorful without being greasy. The lamb meatballs were a little spicy and on a flavorful brioche bun. \nI wanted to try out their lunch specials which is like a mini 3 course meal, but they were sold out! The lesson seems to be to go early if you can to get their special meal for the day. I saw lots of disappointed faces when they realized they had missed their opportunity.\n\nAlthough the start to our adventure was a little harrowing, the end result was a lovely lunch sitting in the sun, surrounded by bike messengers and Market Street traffic. \n\nA perfect way to start the weekend.", "author": "Kathy K."}

The sandwiches are typically very good. HOWEVER, earlier this week I arrived at 11:30 to find the spicy pork sandwich wasn't available and the meatball sandwich was sold out. So, rather than settling for another sandwich, I opted for the daily special of Spicy Shrimp Stew. After walking back to my office and digging into the bag, I discovered that the \"stew\" was nothing more than a stock with small bay-sized shrimp and nearly raw red onions, peppers, celery, and canned artichoke hearts.  In my book, it's a far cry from a stew and a poor attempt at a soup.  The soup looks like it was thrown together literally in minutes.  After consuming about half of it, I gave up as it was not very satisfying. The dessert of Almond Cake with Strawberries even lacked strawberries or fruit of any kind.\n\nThis is the second time I have ordered the daily special and have been disappointed both times.\n\nIn the future, I will NEVER order the daily special.

Short opinion: great customer service;  food is VERY hit or miss.\n\nCorned beef sandwich:  I found this pretty gross (though I realize I am in the minority on this). But hear me out! This was one of the heaviest sandwiches I have ever had, despite it being rather skimpy on meat. Other ingredients included cheese, slaw, tons of mayo, and oily ciabatta bread. The first bite was decent, but at bite 4 my body was like \"stop feeding me oil.\" Maybe I just really like the classic corned beef and rye combination. Anyway, verdict: 2/5\n\nLamb, chick pea, curry, and herb pesto sandwich: This was great! The lamb is ground which took me by surprise and made the sandwich messy, but I would definitely order it again. They slathered mayo on the bread which I could definitely have done without, but next time I'll special order it. Verdict: 4.5/5\n\nPork sandwich: This was seriously gross. I believe the chipotle-fig was left off my sandwich (see below under customer service for more on this) so all that was on my sandwich was slimy (from the cheese) slabs of flavorless pork and of course a quarter inch of mayo. I couldn't even bear to eat the second half. Verdict: 1/5\n\nRare roast beef sandwich: This sells out every day, so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Honestly, I think it's just one step above being \"just ok.\" The meat is good - nice and rare as promised. Aside from that, there is a horseradish mayo (as you can see, my distaste for excess mayo may be coloring my opinion of this place), smoked onions, and lettuce. Sort of basic. Still, I'd probably order this again if the lamb were ever sold out. Verdict: 3.5/10\n\nDaily special shrimp and tofu curry: Ehhh this dish bordered on a soup. Some rice was pre-mixed into the sauce but not nearly enough to absorb the sauce. Sauce was not terribly flavorful (for a green curry). Also, this was served with a side of seeded bread and a pickle spear! I love this practice with sandwiches, but with a green curry it felt odd. Would not order again. Verdict: 2.5/5\n\nPeach and blueberry crisp: So good. This came with my lunch special and I am still thinking about it a week later. Perfectly cooked fruit and crispy top. Yum! Verdict: 5/5\n\nChocolate chip cookies: TO DIE FOR! Maybe this is what keeps me coming back  Plus, they get you over the credit card minimum when you buy a sandwich. Verdict: 5/5!\n\nCustomer service: This is what really sets this place apart; I cannot say enough good things about them! Service is very efficient, so that even if the line is long I have never had to wait more than 8 minutes total from the time I get in line until my food is ready. I also LOVE that they give you a pickle spear and an Andes mint with every lunch purchase. While certainly not the best pickle I've ever had, it shows such an effort to please customers. Finally, their responsiveness to customer concerns is wonderful. After my pork sandwich was missing ingredients (described above), I contacted the owner who apologized and said I could get my next sandwich on the house. I thought there might be a hassle when I actually attempted to take him up on that, but I showed the cashiers the email and there was no problem at all.

You come, check out their menu of 10-15 items, order, and go back to your office.  Usually comes paired with a delicious pickle and an Andes chocomint piece.\n\nThe sandwiches. If you go later than 12p (close to 1pm), you might miss out on pork and fig sandwiches or other fancy specials of the day. Their menu changes for certain things but they obviously got usual suspects. I've had their corned beef, their roast beef, their pork+fig deliciousness, their deviled egg, and another pork sammich. My go-to is their corned beef.  All sandwiches are stuffed silly with meats. The bread is soft and delicious and can be eaten on its own. The flavour + amount of food you get is well worth the sub-$10 price tag.\n\nThe bread. Soft, delicious, highly addictive. It's not high in sugar content, like most standard sandwich bread. If you're expecting cheap crumbly dry bread, this is not the place for you.\n\nWhat makes this a 5 star vs a 4 star? Let me tell you the 'wow' factor. I don't frequent the place often, because the bread's too much gluten for me personally and I get into a food coma. Ergo, I go here maybe 1x every 4-6 weeks. One of the gals there remembers my name. Every. Time. And when people serve so many people and can still remember your name? That's feel-good service.

Not knowing SF very well, I went with it, despite the limited menu I perused online... and I trusted the hundreds of reviews that came before mine.\n\nWhen we arrived, I was disappointed to find that the White Beans Soup with Chili paste and cinnamon was no longer available... I guess that's why they clearly say \"all items subject to change without notice\" on their website.  Instead, I went with a spicy egg salad sandwich and a cauliflower soup.  While the soup was a tad on the watery side, the sandwich was quite tasty and extremely filling.  The perfect weather enhanced the experience... we at at Yerba Buena Park!\n\nThe four of us ate for less than $40 - not horrible, but not cheap either.  The rest of my group all had the corned beef and seemed to enjoy it as well.

The sandwich is really really goood.  The beef is tender, the cabbage adds a good crunch, and the Russian dressing gives that slightly sweet cherry on top taste to the sandwich.  The bread is also really good.\n\nThe egg salad sandwich is a different story.  I didn't find it all that great to be honest.  The egg salad lacked any real taste and could definitely use a little extra dose of vinegar.  Very plain jane.\n\nWith the hype from 7x7, Sentinel's lines do get long and their sandwiches do sell out.  Try to get there earlier rather than later.  I'm a late lunch eater, and I've always wanted to venture out from the Corned Beef, but they always sell out of everything.\n\nAll the sandwiches comes with pickle spears and the mints with the green wrappers (the name escapes me at the moment).  The pickles in my opinion taste a little funny.  I think they need to revisit their pickling process.\n\nAlso, there is a credit card minimum that happens to be just slightly more than the cost of a sandwich, so be prepared to either buy a drink or something extra if you want to use your card, else bring some cash.\n\nThe corned beef on its own though, makes Sentinel a worthwhile trip.", "author": "Kyle W."}

I've been meaning to check out The Sentinel for quite a while now. They're quite famous for their roast beef and corned beef sandwiches. \n\nThe line went by speedy gonzales fast. They basically just start making sandwiches and put them into boxes so they're ready to go for the next customer in line who wants it. I ordered a corned beef sandwich when I got to the front of the line and had it in my hands within about 2 seconds. Paid $9 and was out of there in a jiffy.\n\nThis little corner shop isn't a place to sit and eat. In fact, they don't have anywhere inside to sit and eat. Does that matter? No. Because Yerba Buena Gardens is just a block or 2 down the street. And what better way to enjoy a \nsunny afternoon than to sit in a beautiful park, absorbing the sunshine, and eating one of the most delicious sandwiches ever? I guess winning the lottery might be better, but not much else.\n\nMy first bite of this sandwich was one of those moments where your life changes a little bit for the better. The bread was buttery and soft, but still held up extremely well. The corned beef was absolutely delicious, but what really made this sandwich was the sauce they put on it. I have no idea what it was, but it was so flavorful and mouth watering-ly good.\n\nMy friend who was with me let me try a little bit of his oatmeal cookie he got as well. Whoa. I never really think to get a dessert at places for lunch, but this cookie alone is worth coming back for.

At the end though, I wonder if I really do need a chef of Mr. Leary's caliber to make me a corned beef sandwich.  It was good -- damned good, but it wasn't heads and tails above a corned beef sandwich I might find elsewhere.  The turkey salad sandwich didn't quite fare as well (a little dry, a little underseasoned?), but still was enjoyable and filling.\n\nIt's hard to knock The Sentinel, and the truth is that I'm probably not scrutinizing my other corned beef sandwiches the way I scrutinized this one.

I asked the girl who was taking the orders what her favorite is, she said the roast beef is the bomb, but she said it takes like 10 minutes to make.  Too bad, I didn't have that much time.  She said the spicy pork is the bomb too, so I tried that.  2 minutes later, I was in elevator on my way back to my work thing.  The sandwich was the bomb, had this peppery sauce that was kinda sweet but kinda not.  Not very spicy for spicy pork but full-flavored, not dry at all.

So for me this is really an example for such a case: ever since I've started working in the area I've been visiting this slice of heaven of a lunch spot at least twice a week. \n\nEach time I fall in love with a different sandwich. Then the process is as follows: I remain completely faithful to it until some workmate lets me try a bite of his, at which point I switch partners. So far I've coupled with the Egg sandwich, the Spicy Tuna sandwich, the Lamb and Feta sandwich. Smoked Mozzarella and Ratatouille seems spectacular and if it weren't for the onions I would have probably been closer to that one too.\n\nWhat can I say.. I even love their cookie and coffee cake. \n\nWell, today I realized that it is my duty to Yelp. Curiously, it was due to a tragic accident: somebody there put the wrong sandwich in my bag by some rare turn of events. unknowingly I walked back to the office only to be stuck at a meeting and having to miserably watch everybody else eat. \nI therefore went back an hour later with my sandwich. And what can I say... they made up for it handsomely.. didn't think I could appreciate this business more, but there... \n\nAnyway, I realize this review came out bordering on fan fiction - so for the sake of proving that I was writing it while maintaining the proper levels of objectivity as worthy of a critic, I'll just mention that I am not a big groupie of the (complimentary!) chocolate mint or the pickled cucumber.

The efficiency and energy level, and seriousness, are stunning.  Redheaded Chef Denis Leary, in full Bobby Flay mode, commands five cooks, two cashiers, an order-taker, some back-of-house runnders, all in a low voice, staring down his station with the intensity of a caged bobcat, all in an area the size of a suburban bathroom - no exaggeration, the interior here is about 250 square feet. If someone says boo here there may be bloodshed.\n\nIf you haven't been I highly recommend it.  Just watching Denis and his expanding lunchtime empire gives me local pride.  Success couldn't happen to a more sincere, hardworking chef.\n\nPrices are high for sandwiches, but low for serious food.  Quality ingredients shine on things like the olive oil on the salad garnish.  Some items here would be worth twenty dollars a plate at a sit down fancy restaurant.  But there are misfires.  Home baked bread makes the place smell wonderful, but Acme is better.  Pulled pork has a wonderful natural flavor but is stringy and dry.  By contrast the corned beef is awesome, and homemade pickles are a step beyond.\n\nRight now I'm at a bar counter watching an even more famous chef wander his kitchen purposefully but in a happy mood, he jokes with a staff in obvious awe, his kitchen turning out sublime small plates to some early evening locals.  You don't have to be gonzo to be great, I guess.

The corn beef sandwich was incredible. The extra pickle on the side and the little candy were also a nice touch.

It would be nice if it was located near an area with some benches or something...Guess that means I will just have to enjoy my food in front of my coworkers and make them jealous. The other downside was the price. Definitely a great sandwich worth the price but nonetheless the price is what will keep me from eating there more often.

He would be the perfect host.  Given the small size of this shop you get a front row seat to the verbal interplay that happens in most busy kitchens.  That means terse words and orders being exchanged with regularity.  It's good theatre while you wait for your sandwich.\n\nFor the most part, they deliver.  The bread is always fresh (as it is at Canteen, the sister restaurant) and soft, kind of a brioche.  Although I've had many sandwiches here, the one I love most is the pork with the spicy sauce.  The roast beef has been a mainstay too; it's bloody rare and rich.  They are known for their corned beef sandwich, too, although I found it too mild for my taste (mostly over-dressed).\n\nThe sandwiches are messy.  It's the necessary result of using soft bread, actually.  They also tend to get a bit soggy because the bread absorbs moisture and there isn't generally much fat (e.g. butter) to keep it out.  This is a problem, although if you're like me the sandwich will be gone before its moist doomsday arrives.\n\nIn all honesty Naked Lunch has supplanted this place as my favorite sandwich shop, so I rarely come here anymore since moving away from it.  It's no fault of the business, really, there's just nowhere to sit and eat if you don't work in an office nearby.

Mine was good - though realistically, it wasn't particularly unique and I could easily make the filling myself at home.  The soft, delicious bun was really the standout.  The chicken mole was interesting... the sauce was really nutty and not very chocolate-y, but the addition of tortilla chips is a good idea.

The Sentinel is a well-run establishment that serves delicious sandwiches.  \n\nDon't be discouraged by the long line that straddles the corner of New Montgomery and Stevenson.  First, a long line is a good sign!  The line moves pretty quickly because Dennis Leary and his crew have thoughtfully created an efficient system of order taking, food preparation, and cashiering, given the space his team has to work with. \n\nThe Sandwiches (I tried the chicken salad sandwich and the spicy pork sandwich):\n\nSpicy Pork Sandwich: Don't expect flavors similar to that of a BBQ pulled-pork sandwich.  There are slices of pork tenderloin lightly smothered in a slightly spice pepper puree, which is topped with a carrot/celery root coleslaw that gives it a bit of the tangy flavor.  This is served on a freshly baked Challah bun, which provides sweetness to the sandwich.  It's a beautifully crafted sandwich that satisfy the belly.  The portions are quite generous and well worth the $8.50.\n\nChicken-Salad Sandwich:  Also served on a Challah bun. You won't get any of the \"mayo\" flavor that comes with regular chicken salad.  This chicken salad was dressed (I don't think it was mayo-based) with large chunks of chicken along with roasted peppers and artichokes (pleasant treat).  It also had a tangier taste with the artichoke hearts, blended with the sweetness of the Challah bun.\n\nOther things I liked about the Sentinel:\n1) Food pricing- Tax is included in the price (presumably) so there's no added time making change with pennies, nickels, and dimes.(except for quarters)\n2) Menu- Smaller selection (maybe 10 choices of sandwiches) means food is prepared quickly.  But it still takes time to decide on your sandwich because they all sound really good!\n3) Order taking- In peak times, someone will take your order while you are in line. When you reach the cashier to pay, your food is ready for you.  This means no waiting around, and no crowd hovering around for their food next to the register\n4) Werther's candy and pickle.  Added treats in the bottom of your sandwich bag.\n\nI definitely have my eye on the corned-beef sandwich and the Coppa sandwich the next time I go. And if the sandwiches are equally tasty, I will add more stars to the review.  \n\nAs I finish up my review on The Sentinel, my mouth is watering and sadly, the computer clock shows it's only  9:11 AM.", "author": "Brian K."}

Nor does the Sentinel probably need my rave review, I'm sure they're doing fine.  I just like it so much that I can't reasonably keep my gushing off of the internet any longer.  I've had a love-hate relationship with the sandwich.  Sure, it's a good idea in concept, but what if the bread is dry?  What if it's mushy?  What if it's just a slab of meat on a bun?  (Sorry, Carnegie Deli.)  What if it's not filling?  What if a quarter of it will end up giving me a coronary?  (Someday, when I've lived a full life, I'll have an Elvis.)\n\nWhat if nothing.  The Sentinel serves up fresh ingredients in interesting flavor combinations faster than you can say \"Gee, I hope they don't take too long to make my sandwich, I'm awfully hungry.\"  That tiny ex-cigar shop houses a well-oiled machine comprised of People Who Do Not Mess Around, and they want nothing more than to stuff your face with a culinary wonder that would make a particular deceased British nobleman smile down from whatever edible heaven he's in.\n\nI could tell you what to get, but it doesn't matter.  Whatever sounds good, is good.  The sandwiches I have tried and find particularly delectable are the tofu sandwich (a staple in summer), the BALT (that's basil, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and some goat cheese for good measure), and my most recent discovery: the smoked trout salad.  They are respectively: texturally firm and a little spicy, extra creamy and adequately tangy, and crispy, just fishy enough (but I sure hope you like mayo).  I would attempt to describe to you the immense quantity of the flavor in each of them, but the drool on my keyboard is making that difficult.  They are all served on light, fluffy, buttery rolls.\n\nYes, there's a line.  Yes, they run out of ingredients.  But they encourage you to call your order in, and if they run out of ingredients after you've called in, I believe they're in the habit of offering you your order for free.  So do that.

The bread was actually good.\n2. The taste of the filling was good. (but not enough)\n3. Nice staff\n\nThe bad\n1. Too much bread to filling ratio\n2. Not worth 9 bucks (You'd expect chips and a drink for this price)\n3. The pickle was terrible.\n4. Way over hyped.\n\nI have been avoiding this place because, every time I go by there there is an extremely long line. So, finally after 3 years of my co-workers telling me how good it was, I passed by today and found only 4 people in line. I said what the hell let's give it a try. \n\nI liked the fact that there were only about 6 sandwiches on the menu, so it was easy to order. I almost got the Corned Beef Sandwich but wasn't in the mood for that typical sandwich. I was seeking some adventure. It was a toss up between the Corned Beef and the Lamb and Eggplant with Chickpea Curry. I got the Lamb. \n\nUpon first inspection I was impressed by the bread, I got the wheat bun. I opened it up and saw the curry mixture and I thought they had not given me any meat with the sandwich. All I could see were the chickpeas. I expected something like a shawarma style meat, I looked closer and the lamb was ground up. \nThey really should call this sandwich \"Chickpea and Eggplant with Ground Lamb\". \n\nI took my first bite and all I really could taste was the bread, then the curry flavor then the chickpeas. I could not really decipher any meat in this mixture or the eggplant. It was all drowned down in bread, the chickpeas and curry flavor (which I liked). I almost felt like I was eating a Vegetarian sandwich.\n\nThe major complaint I had was the bread to filling ratio. There simply was not enough filling! \n\nMy second complaint was that that sandwich was not worth 9 dollars.\nIf you're going to sell a 9 dollar sandwich I'd at least want it big enough to save and have that other half for a 3 o'clock snack. But that was not the case because after you eat the one half, because of lack of filling, you can eat the other half no problem. Or give us some chips and a drink I think you can afford to hand us some chips in that bag for 9 bucks a sandwich.\n\nOh last but not least the pickle tasted like it was \"pickled\" in the ocean. BLEH. It tasted like when I used to surf and I'd swallow ocean water.\n\nMaybe next time I'll get the Corned Beef.", "author": "Mark S."}

Basil, lettuce, tomato, and goat cheese (the BALT). An award winning combo, to be sure, but I had some issues with The Sentinel's version and let me tell you why:\n\n1. With no option to add chicken or turkey cold cuts, I took them up on their suggestion to get it with the chicken salad inside- my need for protein in the afternoon is like a hooker's at 2am. It was excessively doused in mayo and lacked in any real added flavor or zing. I ended up dumping it all out in the end, and sort of wish they had meats other than roast or corned beef to add into their veggie options.\n\n2. For a sandwich that was intended for vegetarians, it was really lacking in cheese. Cheese- or, \"the 8th wonder of the world\" as I call it- should be a dominant flavor in any sandwich, but ESPECIALLY in one that has only vegetables and no dressing (I don't do mayo and they don't seem to have any sort of house sauce). There was two bites of cheese in there. TWO. I counted....twice ;)\n\n3. The bread is super soft and crumbles very easily. I should have taken a picture- left with a mountain of bread and chicken salad in the end. Not that it wasn't tasty, just messy. And it would be nice to have the option to toast it. If that is an option, I wasn't asked about it and regretted not having asked.\n\nAll said, the place smelled INCREDIBLE and my special sexy male friend loved his rare roast beef with horseradish. I might try it again when the menu changes, but being that its downtown and I work in SOMA, I can't say I'll go back too soon and I can't say that I have anything wrong with that.", "author": "Raquel C."}

Their gourmet sandwiches are simply fantastic...made with fresh, unique ingredients and packed with incredible flavors. Definitely some of the tastiest sandwiches I've ever had!\n\nI decided to phone in my order today to beat the lunchtime line and took several tries before I got through. I'm not sure if it was THE Dennis Leary who answered the phone but he was prompt to take down the sandwich I wanted, my name, and pick-up time. This is great since you get to cut the line, pay, and leave with brown baggie in hand within 5 min. =) Thank god they take credit cards too since their prices range from $8-$10 (including tax)...not too bad for FiDi and the quality of their food.\n\nI've had the infamous corned beef, pork loin, and BBQ eggplant sandwiches before and ALL were uh-may-zing!!! They melt in your mouth (hot sandwiches) and are soooo delicious that you never want it to end. I would say they are all must-trys in my book. I was sad they didn't have the BBQ eggplant on their current Spring menu.\n\nToday, I decided to go another route and tried the cold marinated yellowtail with fennel and avocado sandwich. The abundant yellowtail fish was marinated with something zesty and lemony plus fennel, topped with lettuce, cucumber slivers, and avocado (I think they skimped on mine though). The fish was seared on the outside, slightly raw on the inside and was very fresh!\n\nThe roll was covered in sesame and sunflower seeds so that added a nice crunch to offset the tenderness of the fish and softness of the bread. All the flavors just blended extremely well together and is something I will order again. I finished the entire thing, no problem whatsoever and my tummy was happy as well. \n\nI love how they change up the menu every so often too to provide some variety. I'm determined to eventually try all of their sandwiches!", "author": "Karen Y."}

I didn't know the different colored post-it's reflected a sandwich, so I commented that nobody took my order..and she said \"I did\" and proceeded to help the guy behind me who placed his order with someone behind her! UGH! It would be nice if they actually had a system where only one person does the order taking and one does the cashiering.

The pear muffin has huge chunks of sweet juicy pears, they are so big that the muffin stays so moist. The squash one is unique in flavor, not too spicy, but you could definitely taste the sweetness of the squash. Both of them have the the BEST slightly crusty top, which is what I love about muffins.

Just to make sure my theory was correct, I ordered three sandwiches; The corned beef, the vegetarian Swiss chard, and the deviled ham.  \n\nThe Swiss chard was unique in that it was unlike anything I'd ever eaten before.  It came cold, with a wallop of chard and mushrooms, a huge smear of goat cheese, sun dried tomato mayonnaise, and curried raisins.  It was a taste sensation my mouth was not sophisticated enough to appreciate yet.  I'm purely a deli meats kind of gal, I suppose.\n\nThe deviled ham, although appearing to be minced with mayo, looked unappealing as soon as I opened the wrapper.  It was accompanied by butter lettuce, cream cheese and walnuts.  Not my favorite choice, but my husband loved the flavor, and said it tasted swell.   Then again, he'll eat anything meat.  He calls pigs \"a magical animal.\" Yes, I'm married to Homer Simpson.\n\nBut I put my vote in for the corned beef.  It had Gruyere, caramelized onions, Russian dressing, and what I think was some sort of slaw.  It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory, and the beef was perfectly prepared.  The sandwich was served warm, unlike the other two, and it hit the spot on a cold San Francisco afternoon.  \n\nSo there you have it.  My Sentinel theory was correct.  Corned beef = crazy delicious.

One sandwich will satiate you and not get you stuffed, which I respect. But if I'm going to pay $8.50 for a sandwich, I better have leftovers. I can get a better, bigger gourmet/fresh (however you want to label it) sandwich in NYC for 25% less money.

There isn't a seating area, but it's just a quick walk to Yerba Buena Park or one of the indoor areas that they recommend on 2nd Street.\n\nI got to sample a couple of sandwiches, both delicious and interesting in their own way. One was yellowtail served on a soft seeded baguette with fennel and apple. Fresh, light and dressed in a bright vinaigrette, it was a refreshing combination. The other sandwich was their special of the day, the BBQ pork sandwich -- thin slices of pork covered with enough tangy sauce to keep it together between its soft roll.\n\nOpen on the weekdays for lunch, be sure to get there early if you want  to pick from their full menu.

Just a real nice alternative to the kind of crap you wind up eating downtown for just a buck or 2 more.  Which, I think, is always worth it.\n\nI've had the 2 hot sandwiches on the Summer Menu:  The veal meatball and the corned beef.  The stars of each were the meat, as I'd imagine they should have been.\n\nThe meatballs were flavored with nice fresh herbs that gave a loud garden-like spin, while maintaining a huge meat flavor.  The sauce had a nice taste, but was drenched all over the meatballs and both buns to the point where it could not be picked up dues to sogginess.  Meatballs and sauce on a bun;  that was it - no additional roughage or veggies.  Flavor-wise, it arguably doesn't need anything else, but texture-wise I'd say some contrast was missing.  Pretty messy, very heavy, but damn satisfying.\n\nThe corn beef itself wasn't too greasy at all.  More importantly, it didn't have that tough or rubbery texture you can expect at some of the cheaper spots nearby.  The lightly toasted (and quite greasy from butter) foccacia and cabbage offered a little more bite to this sandwich.  The Russian dressing was mild but nice.  Very filling, but required a good amount of napkins that weren't found in our take-away bag.  \n\nI like this place.  I'm looking forward to seeing the fall menu.  Also, if these two sandwiches made their summer menu, what kind of heavy items can we expect come winter?", "author": "Dave H."}

I love the busy-bodies working behind the counter oh-so serious in the creation of the perfect sandwich.  Yes, and I think they've accomplished near perfection.  I don't work in the financial district, but whenever I have a week day off (I'm a student) I make sure to find time to stop by.  Going down that way for lunch is a good reminder that we need to get more women in business, finance, whatever it is these \"financial district\" people do, but that's beside the point.\n\nI've been to the Sentinel a handful of times now and most of the time I get the egg salad.  My only complaint is that I loved the first one I had the best, and since then they've changed it a bit.  The first one I had came on a wonderful crispy roll - just the right amount of crunch with a soft, buttery interior.  The egg salad had a great flavor - a little bit vinegar-y with some fresh herbs chopped in.  It also wasn't too heavy on the mayo.  I think this last time I had it, the vinegar flavor wasn't really there, and I missed that.\n\nI've also tried the chopped chickpea salad.  My favorite part of the sandwich was the bread.  Probably the only time I'll eat white bread, and it's well worth it - tastes like it just came from the oven.  I had a white bean soup as well - it wasn't incredible, but had an interesting tangy flavor.\n\nAs I'm not a meat eater, I can't say much for the meat sandwiches except that my dad (who was visiting from Wisconsin) is still talking about his Reuben!  \n\nI recommend going early - we went 1/2 hour before close once and they were out of all but one sandwich.", "author": "Sarah F."}

Take myself to The Sentinel.\n\nWill you indulge me a minute while I gush some more?  \n\nIt all starts with the website.  Check the daily menu: if the special sounds appetizing, well, you better get it.

She always makes a gesture of conversation, no matter how busy she is.  She's never messed up an order no matter how large.  If it's been more than a few days since you've been, she'll make you feel missed.  If you come alone, she takes care to ask where your friends are -- Tavi, buddy, she misses you!\n\nYou'd like to stay and chat with Holly forever, but it'd be rude to the customers behind you.

The daily lunch special is always such a surprise delight.  But the best thing on the menu is the soup.  I could kill for that soup.  Every day it's something different.  I think my favorites have been the mushroom, tomato parmesan, and sweet corn soups.  I think he may use a little bit of a cream and butter in those soups.  A touch.  Those lovely soup containers covered in foil with a slice of bread and pickle and an Andes mint (along with whatever sandwich or lunch special I happen to get that day) are really setting me back quite a bit for lunch, but I DON'T CARE.  I am blinded by the soup.\n\nAnd, the daily rotating selection of muffins and oatmeal in the morning is incredible.

Walking in is really underwhelming.  Natural lighting, no seating, and a staff of only three (one young female asian cashier and two hispanic cooks in the back).  It's about the size of a dorm room.  From experience I knew it had to be something good for this hole in the wall to survive.\n\nThe interior isn't anything upscale but it has it's charming touches such as the antique wooden cash register, big ass clock, and plainly stated menu board.  There is a counter for maybe two people to eat at, although this is primarily a take out spot for people on the run or living in the nearby hotel.\n\nAccording to the website the menu changes seasonally.  They state that they have breakfast and soup yet no items are listed on the menu, only sandwiches are listed.  All the sandwiches sounded really tasty but the corned beef on flatbread with gruyere cheese sounded the best.  Plus there aren't that many places that serve up quality corned beef.\n\nI was expecting a 'Soup Nazi' yet the cashier was really nice.  Even saying \"por favor\" to her hispanic comrades.  The sandwich comes in a recycled-paper box with a bagged pickle and butterscotch candy.  I really loved my sandwich.  Super tasty.  All the elements worked well together.  The corned beef sandwich had cabbage as well as some kind of pinkish-orange sauce that tasted like tomato.  At times it tasted like pizza.  Now I want to try putting corned beef on a pizza pie!  The quality of corned beef is worth noting.  Really moist, flavorful, and plentiful.\n\nThe sandwich is pricey at $8.25 but it really filled me up.  It looks kinda small but it definitely exceeded my expectations.  I would go back if I ran out of ideas or craved a sandwich.  Locals probably bring back lunch from here all the time.

But it helps that every choice is fantastic.  Today, the bf had:\n\nPastrami on rye with gruyere, grainy mustard, and red cabbage slaw - which must have had some serious aioli mixed in cause this one was RICH.  In a good way.  It was the perfect boy sandwich - ultra-meaty, savory, and intense.  \n\nI had:\n\nSmoked salmon with horseradish aioli, watercress, and fennel on a seeded roll: this was, appropriately, the female counterpart to the above: fresh, delicate, and subtle.  Every flavor was distinct and balanced.  And the roll: amazing.  It had to be housemade.\n\nWe shared:\n\nCorn soup.  Essence of corn.  And well, cream.  Probably a lot of cream.  Hence the sharing.\n\nBoth sandwiches came with pickles, which, while bf-approved, disappointed me just a bit: I wanted something more interesting on the side - I'd heard rumors of fabulous-sounding mini-salads served earlier in the week.  I also tried to score an order of the strawberry shortcake that accompanied today's ahi tartare (which I would have ordered if not for the scary spicy tuna bowl I foolishly consumed last night at the Westfield food court - what was I thinking, raw tuna in a mall?!), but was rebuffed.

Even though Jessica was second in line (they open at 11:30am), I waited in the getaway car for about 20 minutes for the order to come out. 20 minutes for two gourmet spicy peppered turkey on ciabatta sandwiches. In those 20 minutes, I saw the line grow from 2 to 20 people, with the line formed along Stevenson Street. This better be a damned good sandwich, I thought to myself.\n\nBecause I was posted out front inside the Yelpmobile, I didn't get to check out the selection of desserts. Which was just as well though, because the sandwich was huge. There was about 2\" of turkey, and oh was it delicious!\n\nI can't wait to come back to try out the daily changing selection of sammies and sweet treats.

Sentinel did  not blow me away, and I have had much better sandwiches in my day.\n\nIt wasn't the customer service or speed, because both times I've gone have been after 1:30 when there was no line and I was in and out in about 3 minutes. The first time I got the smoked salmon sandwich, which was good and today I got their corned beef Reuben, which was nontraditional but still tasty.

The lines out the door speak to the need for such a business.  \n\nIt doesn't even matter that there is nowhere to eat.  I picture people hovered over their keyboards in the surrounding office buildings, hunkered down with their sandwiches like animals, making grunting sounds and not even bothering to wipe their mouths.

So we looked at the menu before leaving and walked right over.  \n\nThere was a line, but it was not very long - about 15 people tops.  It went by really really fast.  I don't know how these people do it, there were at least 5-6 employees for a crowded sandwich joint on the corner, working with speed and knocking out those orders like it was no ones business.  I ordered the Coppa sandwich which basically is ike a glorified salami sandwich with mozarella, tomato, lettuce, and - interestingly - pumpkin pesto.  We got our food and took it back to the office.  The sammich was awesome!  Especially the hint of the pumpkin in the sandwich, it wasn't overpowering or crazy (which is what I was afraid of).

(For our readers on the East Coast, I wouldn't stand ON line for anything).\n\nSo, we came here at 11:15 on Friday to avoid standing in line.  We did avoid the lines, in a way.  Apparently, they didn't serve lunch until 11:30.  Still, the friendly clerk at the counter took our order and our money and told us to come back at 11:30.  I showed up at 11:32, and had to wait 3-4 more minutes because our food wasn't ready yet.  No big deal, I can wait.\n\nI kind of like the shop itself.  Sure, the name makes you think of a small-town newspaper (The Poughkeepsie Sentinel, for example).  However, the decor is reminiscent of an old New York deli.  It's a tiny place with a tiny kitchen and no place to sit.  The 1950s cash register encased in old mahogany - very stylish.  Unfortunately, the comparisons to New York delicatessen end here.\n\nI ordered the corned beef sandwich ($8.25) and a cup of acorn squash soup ($5.50).  The soup was NOT a good value.  A cup, although pretty big, was only 3/4 full.  The soup, which was supposed to be a puree, had the consistency of water.  I wish they had given me a straw instead of a spoon.  The corned beef sandwich itself was very tasty: grilled panini with onions, cabbage, Gruyere cheese and Russian dressing.  What was missing, however, is corned beef.   Two measly slices?  Are you kidding me?  Carnegie Deli in NYC gives you more corned beef than you can shake a stick at.  \n\nIf they want to establish themselves as a \"New York Deli,\" they should really consider not skimping on the meat.  Yes, it's a delicious sandwich, and a very popular one, might I add.  However, until they decide to add some meat, I probably won't rush back.\n\nAs my coworker said, \"it was the best five-dollar sandwich I've ever had.\"  My Sentinel sentiments exactly.\n\nI ask you again, Where's the beef?", "author": "Yan G."}

Folks, I took a day off and drove all the way here to try the infamous sandwich - even got there way early, too early.  Got there at 10:15am and Dennis Leary was the only person at the little shop.  I didn't know they don't serve lunch until 11am but he said I can place my order and come back.  He was busy and preoccupied and not very friendly but then I guess he's a famous chef and taking order is not his daily task.\n\nDecided to try the brisket sandwich and be back at 11am.   Drove around, no space and parked at the Mission garage.  It was still too early but it was a nice day.  There is now a staff in the small kitchen working and a cashier.  Decided to get the lemonade while debating on the soup and the special salad.  \n\nAt 11am sharp, the cashier called my name.  The lunch came with a small sweet treat - andes mint.  Walked to the closest shady spot and dug in - it was good, just wasn't a WOW.  It's definitely not a deli sandwich but a sandwich you will find in a fine restaurant.  The sandwich is on the smaller size, lean on meat,  plenty slaw, and a flavorful sauce.  The pickle was not good.\n\nWon't go out of my way but will try again if in the neighborhood.

My personal favorite was the Curry Cauliflower (please please please I want that back on the menu!), which they had on the menu some time last year.

That was a definite first, for lunch time, but it looks like everyone was at Sushiritto down the block.  I ordered the corned beef sandwhich, and that was definitely to die for.

I've tried the coffee cake and brioche and neither came in comparison to the muffins. \n\nAs for the sandwiches, it pains to me say that I had an awful experience once with the turkey meatloaf sandwich. It was cold! I found it strange when the sandwich came out within seconds of me placing the order but I figured maybe they found a way to optimize the process. Nope - they just forgot to heat it up, or something. It was nast. I had another recent disappointing experience with their special lunch entree - braised veal breast with macaroni, mushroom salad, and chocolate something or other. The veal and macaroni were good but very light and not filling enough. Mushroom salad was fine. But the chocolate something or other, wtf. It was a blob of gritty, ultra thick chocolate frosting mixture. Completely inedible and a waste of $11.\n\nDespite my inconsistent experiences, I'll still go to Sentinel.

After several months of making two, maybe three trips a week to this hole-in-the-wall spot, the idea of getting a sandwich anywhere else still strikes me as ludicrous. \n\nPeople line up early, so shoot for noon if you want to avoid the crowds and ensure that you don't miss out on the more popular items (arrive at 2:00 and half the menu will be crossed out). The staff is awesome - I'm impressed (and mildly embarassed) that the cashier knows me by name, which she'll write on a color-coded post-it for orders - crazy system, but it seems to work. \n\nLately I'm a fairly consistent hot pink post-it - the turkey meatloaf is ridiculous. I'd never consider myself a meatloaf kind of girl (I don't think I'd ever even tasted meatloaf before) but this sandwich comes with some crazy delicious chipotle spread and juicy cranberries. But the real superstar is the bread - fresh from the oven and definitely the key to The Sentinel's sucess.

I love Canteen and would appreciate a high quality take out lunch given that I spend most of my work days typing away in between bites.\n\nWe ordered the chicken salad special. Being a girl from the midwest, I like a good chicken salad. The chunks of chicken were ample and fresh, and  I love the golden raisins, but the spices were off to me. The dish left an odd taste in my mouth. The few pieces of bread served along the salad were delicious - I was given two but could have used more. The endive salad was fresh but very bitter. I think that one of the challenges of serving food with this much personality is that people aren't eating it with a well chosen beverage - so intense flavors can overpower the meal entirely.\n\nThe special comes with a small dessert - genius.

From AG Ferrari and Specialty's to Subway and Quizno's, working in the FiDi puts you in a veritable nirvana of stuff between bread. While all are pretty much variations on the same theme, there is the rare shop that breaks down stereotypes and gets truly innovative. The Sentinel, on New Montgomery and Stevenson Alley is one of those places. The menu changes every day and they only offer a few selections, but each one is crafted uniquely and promises at least innovation. \n\nOn Tuesday, May 5th, the menu consisted of a vegan option, yellowtail, pork, roast beef and the hot corned beef sandwich. All of these priced between $8 and $8.5. I had the yellowtail. It was marinated with fennel in a lemon/dill marinade and lightly seared. It was in sandwiched inside a rustic egg roll and topped off with Avocado, butter lettuce and cucumber. From the first bite, the overwhelming flavor was muted perfectly by the avocado and soft roll. The cucumbers and lettuce provided crunch and the yellowtail and fennel danced delicately on the tastebuds to provide a complex combination of tart, savory and crisp flavors. This creative take on the tuna sandwich certainly had me hooked from the first bite and I had no problem finishing the entire sandwich. \n\nThe service staff was efficient and prompt, while giving up quite a bit on the friendliness front to accomodate the long line of patrons. Personally, I cant wait to get back and try their other sandwiches.", "author": "Adam L."}

So, I went with the lamb & eggplant, chickpea curry, pesto one... it was good, but having it once was probably enough. I think next time I'll have to try the roast or corned beef, as it seems those are the specialty items. \n\nWhen looking at the menu online I saw you could call in your order so you don't have to wait... definitely suggest doing that. \n\nThere is a $10 minimum, which you meet if you get a cookie.

The cabbage and russian dressing definitely round out the flavor of the sandwich, and make the overall experience quite wonderful.\n\nTheir menu changes by season, and changes daily, so check online before heading over, and be ready to wait in line at least 5-10 minutes.

The only complaint I have is that for a sandwich that cost $8 it should have some kind of side salad.\n\nI would recommend ordering a dessert item. My  fresh baked chocolate chip cookie ($3) was huge and very good. Although it is no the best chocolate chip cookie I have had. It needed more molasses and vanilla flavor. The \"nade\" drinks are good too. My Watermelonade ($2) tasted like a really good Agua Fresca.\n\nThe ordering process was very fast they keep things moving there. Service was efficient but not rude. While you wait in line you have plenty of time to scan the menu so you aren't standing there deciding while everyone is giving you the evil eye.\n\n-- 4 stars I want try the other sandwiches.

But were I to puke, it'd probably something pretty, like rainbows. Or kittens wearing shirts with rainbows on them. Yeah. \n\nThe first sandwich I got: The Reuben. I thought I wouldn't like it because it is named after a human name, and, well, it's kinda gross thinking about eating another human being (except for Dennis Leary -- I'd eat him). But, to my surprise, it was delicious. Because of this, I am now able to eat humans without hesitation -- thanks, Dennis! \n\nSecond sandwich: Turkey salad. Yum. I described this sandwich as being \"pleasant\" to my co-workers. That's my 'tardo way of saying I'm incapable of *really* describing why it tastes good. But they also agreed it was pleasant -- hah, fooled them! So not only did I feign intelligence, but I also got a tasty treat, to boot. That's worth 8 bucks right there. \n\nThird selection: braised pork shoulder. This is not a sandwich. No bread here, folks. Just a lot of tasty meat. Tasty, tasty meat. And tastier whip cream-topped apples. Or pears. Or plums. Or whatever the hell they were. That's not important (although it kinda is) -- the most important thing is the whipped cream. My oh my.

I mean the meat was definitely good but i can imagine it must've taste better with it all warm. Maybe they prepared it beforehand instead of made to order.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-08-05", "description": "The Sentinel presents me with a conundrum. How do you rate a deli whose signature sandwich sucks, and yet has an incidental item which is first-rate?\n\nThe signature item is of course the Corned Beef With Cabbage. I could see the wisdom of substituting Gruyere for the usual Swiss cheese - that adds a layer of sophistication -- but the focaccia falls apart when you try to eat the sandwich and clashes with the flavor of the corned beef. Moreover, the dressing is more like ketchup than Russian dressing. Yeccch. The corned beef was good quality but chintzy in quantity, especially when you consider that the Sentinel's Reuben is a $9 sandwich. \n\nMaybe it's a mistake to try to tart up a Corned Beef sandwich. If you're doing a decent job in the classic style, the meat should be excellent finely marbled corned beef, anyway. The Gruyere is a nice addition, but everything else the Sentinel tried was a dis-improvement over the classic Jewish deli style. \n\nBesides, it's seems pointless to have an \"upscale\" Corned Beef sandwich when there isn't one place in San Francisco that can execute a competent classic version. (Miller's East Coast Deli's version is fatty and nasty. Moishe's Pippic's version is dry as dust. The only one I know of that isn't a total embarrassment is from Morty's -- it's not classic, it's portion controlled, and pricey, but at least it tastes good.) \n\nAfter I finished my Corned Beef sandwich, I was disgusted, ready to huff off and give The Sentinel one star. Then I took a bite of my Blueberry/Strawberry muffin. Now, since Suzanne's Muffins went out of business, it's been hard to get a decent muffin in this town. No more. The Sentinel's muffin has a delicate crumb, lots of fruit, isn't too sweet, but isn't sugarless in a misguided effort to be healthy, either. It's a darned good muffin.\n\nSo, what to do? The Sentinel's claim to fame is their sandwiches, so I'll give one star for their Corned Beef sandwich. If I was rating their muffins, I'd give The Sentinel 4 stars, but it's not a bakery, so I'll add one star to the rating.\n\nThe bottom line: don't bother with the sandwiches -- go to Morty's or Ike's instead.

So one day, when my brother came over to my place for lunch and asked me what restaurant nearby makes good sandwiches, I scoffed at him the way Paris HIlton scoffed at Tara Reid when Tara and her entourage got turned away from a night club, and said to him, \"Shit son, you call yourself a gourmand and you haven't heard of the Sentinel? You are more wack than a dog learning to play the piano!\" Of course, the reality was that I had never been to the Sentinel but since i heard so many people raving about it on Yelp, I thought the place would live up to the hype.\n\nWhen we got there at 11:40, there wasn't a line. But a few minutes after we arrived, a line started forming and within 5 minutes, there were about 10 people behind us. So if you are dying to try this place out, it's best to get there early. \n\nAnd now, on to the sandwiches.... First of all, let me start out by saying if you don't like corned beef, don't expect the Sentinel to change your mind about it. I never really knew what corned beef was before visiting the Sentinel but I always thought it sounded a little suspect. And I should have trusted my gut instinct. The corned beef had a sweet flavor, which I didn't enjoy very much and the bread was rather greasy. I've read tons of reviews where people swear that the bread must be baked fresh since it's \"so doughy and delicious\" but after tasting the bread, I was more inclined to drive to the Fisherman's Wharf and get sourdough bread from the Boudin Bakery. I was hoping that the pickle (included with the sandwich)  would be redeeming but to my disappointment, it wasn't as crisp as I had hoped. Even my brother, who ordered 3 corned beef sandwiches to eat after I gave him such a hard time for not knowing about the Sentinel said, after one bite, \"I don't get it. It's just a regular corned beef sandwich...\" And unfortunately, he ended up throwing the sandwiches away. \n\nLastly, I know this is going to sound crazy, but one of my favorite TV shows of all time is Roseanne. And one of the reason that I was rather curious to try the Sentinel was because I always imagined that corned beef sandwich would be something that Roseanne and her family would enjoy. So in that respect, I am thankful that the Sentinel allowed me to feel more \"connected\" to the show. Of course, the Roseanne we all know would NEVER pay $8.75 for a sandwich.", "author": "Andrew C."}

The bread was incredibly fresh and tasty and the combo of ingredients was a hit. The pickled veggies were delish. Someone clearly put some thought into this food, and that's about the best thing I can hope for, especially in a FiDi lunch spot. \n\nAlso, can I just add that although I'm not a vegetarian all of the time, I do eat vegetarian a lot, and the veggie sammie is almost always the least thoughtful, least appetizing item on menus around here. Its either a pile of cheese or a regular sandwich with the meat removed. So I really appreciated that the veggie sandwich at the sentinel was just as creative and delicious as the other options appeared to be. I will, however, plan to try the pork or roast beef next time. \n\nOh and the Werther's Original in the bag made my day. Because as much as I didn't want my sandwich to end (it was that good), I couldn't wait to pop that tasty Werther's in my mouth. Good choice on the sweet treat! \n\nOverall, a refreshing change from the low quality, uninspired lunch fare available within a few blocks of my office.", "author": "Amber C."}

The bread Chef Leary uses on this sammy is buttery goodness baked up into this genius bread-like substance. I've had it a couple of times where there was a little too much horsey cream cheese, and it ruined the balance of the sandwich, but that's ok. \n\nI've also had the reuben --- phenomenal with the zing of good gruyere and fresh cabbage slaw. Head and shoulders above the de riguer kraut. The blueberry muffin and latte I had one morning were fantabulous. The muffin was warm and busted open with blueberry juicy flavor. I wasn't a huge fan of the turkey salad, but to be honest, I'm not a fan of poultry mayo salads. I dunno I had thought that perhaps the sentinel, if anything, could convert me. But alas, I think I just don't like them. \n\nI'd give it 5 stars if they had seating. But on second thought, I kind of feel like seating would detract from the atmosphere.

We were told they weren't serving anyone until 11:30am, but there appeared to be some folks who squeezed in early to pick up some (pre-ordered) food. As we waited on line for about 10 minutes, IT FELT LIKE AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB THAT WAS GOING TO ASK US FOR A COVER CHARGE. Nonetheless, we were excited! Me and two coworkers ordered food: two hot sandwiches (the veal meatball and the corned beef) and one special lunch (BBQ beef). Delighted to have our food and it looked damn delicious as it always was, we were let down.\n \nTHERE WAS A SMALL DEAD FLY ON THE GREENS OF THE SPECIAL. Sure this crap happens every now and then, but we were surprised to be given what seemed like a semi-hard time by the chef. We whispered there was a fly in the food to the chef so that other customers wouldn't hear us. After his response, \"There's no fly in here--that was a mushroom\" we picked up the green with the dead fly on it and handed it to him. He kindly called us his friend and insisted that we take a replacement, although we said we'd just take it without the one lettuce leaf with the dead fly. We did appreciate the gesture and thanked him. \n \nAs we got back to our desks at The Embarcadero, we chowed down on the food and encountered a couple more bothersome things: THE SANDWICH'S VEAL MEATBALL HAD PLASTIC WRAP IN IT and THERE WAS DARK SHORT HAIR IN THE SPECIAL'S BUTTERMILK PIE. [If you watch HUNG on HBO, think of the meatball like Tanya's cookies with the laminated messages baked inside them, but as a meatball with flimsy cellophane plastic that doesn't have a message.]\n \nI'd venture to guess that the prep work at The Sentinel may have fallen by the wayside--greens should have been well-washed, meats should be clear of any packaging and batter should be sanitarily prepared in a clean environment. Shit like this happens sometimes. GRANTED THIS SEEMS LIKE A FEW MORE INSTANCES OF ILL-PREPARED FOOD THAN ONE WOULD EXPECT IN A SINGLE VISIT, but it just seemed all so bad... The stars were misaligned perfectly: waiting for The Sentinel to open felt like waiting on line at a club, asking for a replacement meal with a dead arthropod is found on it didn't seem all right and not knowing how to spell your basic English language name wasn't all right. [The order staff person seemed to be from a European country and asked one of us to spell our name.] \n \nSeriously, we all love The Sentinel and think that the food served here is damn good--at least it was... However, in a town of foodies where there are many good restaurants, The Sentinel has been stricken from the list of our office's go-to's for an awesome lunch. At The Sentinel TODAY, SERVICE WAS A MISS and SHODDY PREPWORK HAS RUINED THE ANTICIPATED QUALITY OF FUTURE MEALS. \n \nWe've seen things like this at other eateries that have made our office's banned eatery-list: Kokkari (for a snail found in a salad), Foccacia Grill (for stomach flu) and all locations of Sellers Markets (for shoddier and smaller quality food)... Even John's Snack and Deil has semi-made the list for forgetting to put meat on Bi Bim Bap, lessening meat portions and selling out to the fad that is Kimchi Soft Tacos. When things like this happen, it's disappointing for us, but we'll hope that improvement is achieved soon.", "author": "Travel Swagger R."}

Probably 4.5/5 but I'll round up. The bread they use in this thing is terrific - like a foccacia bread or something but not quite. It's soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. The corned beef is tender and full of flavor but not overpowering. They put some kind of sauce in here, I want to say ketchup, but it's definitely not that. For $8, it is a little pricey for a sandwich, but shoot, if you're going to have a sandwich, might as well make it a good one! They're not the biggest of sandwiches, by no means submarine sized, but it's quality over quantity here. I would put this place almost on par with Ike's over in the Castro. Well, at least for their corned beef sandwiches. Their BBQ beef sandwiches didn't look all that good.\n\nService was great. Called in advance, went to pick up the sandwiches and they made them right there on the spot. Skipped the whole line. Not sure if you're supposed to do this, but heck, why not? I wasn't too sure about the place at first but 5 stars for the killer good first impression on the corned beef sandwiches. I'm a fan!\n\nIf you're a 6'4 lumberjack, this place isn't for you.

I figured when I went there and they had 6 items on the menu (two of which were sold out) that they all must be pretty good... dear god was I wrong. I ordered the \"lunch special\" hoping to get a good variety dish for lunch. The special was described on the menu as \"mac and cheese, small salad, and a piece of almond cake with blueberries\" which seemed right up my alley. I was quite surprised when my order arrived. The mac and cheese was mediocre at best (soggy noodles in a bland-beyond-bland cheese sauce) the salad consisted of literally a dozen alfalfa sprouts covered in about a teaspoon of salsa... that's it... and the \"almond blueberry cake\" was a piece of almond flavored sponge cake sitting on a half dozen blueberries.\n\nIf you go here, don't order ANYTHING other than one of their sandwiches, I'm told they're very good (although I wasn't particularly impressed after a snatching a bite or two from my co-worker).

Let me just say this:  if you madly adore cream cheese, you will be in heaven.  I, however, prefer extremely light cream cheese...  when I got this sandwich back to my desk, I had to take it apart and scrape off all the excess cream cheese with a knife.  When I was done, I had a nice pile o' cream cheese that probably would have covered half a dozen bagels.  Seriously.  So, I put the sandwich back together, and thought it was... good.  But not great.  The horseradish was a nice touch and gave it a bit of a zing, but aside from that, I didn't see how this sandwich was any more special than your typical lox bagel sandwich from Noah's...  I know other people have raved about the bread, but I found it too crunchy...  almost hard.\n\nAs for the pricing...  A bit pricey, sure, but the portions are big (I didn't even finish my sandwich, despite Project Cream Cheese Removal), and you get a crunchy pickle and the aforementioned Ande's mint (best part, IMHO), so you do get some added value for the price.\n\nI will go back because I am curious to try some of the other offerings, but I don't think I'll order the salmon sandwich again.", "author": "Cara K."}

Must say, the thinly sliced corned beef was tasty, every morsel of it.  It was packed with flavor and whatever sauce they had in addition to the cabbage was superb.  The mango lemonade was not bad at all either!", "author": "Christopher W."}

There is no display case so I asked what they had. The woman behind the counter began with coffee cake and pointed to it. I stopped her there and said I would take that. She cut a huge piece, while another woman rang me up ($2.75). It must have just come from the oven because it was still hot and the sugary topping had whole almonds for a nice crunch. The serving was large enough to keep me snacking until lunch. It was a delightful treat on a cold SF morning!", "author": "Lisa G."}

The wheat bread is perfect - just crackly enough on the outside but soft enough not to make roast beef shoot out the back.  And a hint of sweetness.  And - my god! - rare roast beef, there was even a little bit of bloody juice left at the bottom of my sandwich wrapper today.\n\nI could mainline the Roast Beef w/ blue cheese on wheat.

After seeing long lines at this place for months, I decided to check it out.   Of course, I was waiting in those long lines, but it must be worth it, right?  You betcha!  I ordered the corn beef brisket with grueye cheese, pickled cabbage, and some type of aioloi spread.  I took it back to the office, and ate half of it at my desk.  The bread is fresh and tasty, and I loved the grueye pairing.  Also, I loved the little details like Andes chocolate, and a pickle (that's what all sandwiches should include on the side).  Then, this afternoon, I ate the other half of the sandwich.  It was cold from sitting in the refrig, but it was sooo yummy.  All the flavors were marinated together, and it was so deliciouso.  Definitely will add this to my regular lunch haunts!", "author": "Jen C."}

Unlike a lot of lunch places, the Sentinel changes its menu seasonally, and the new winter menu really distinguishes itself from the typical sandwich and soup fare. The winter soups -- ones I might not usually think to order such as pumpkin or parsnip or today's excellent winter vegetable puree withe gruyere -- have consistently been great. The swiss chard sandwich is an unique and perhaps unexpected delight; everyone in my office -- mostly dudes, mostly meat-eaters -- loves it and orders it regularly over the heartier corned beef sandwich and deviled ham sandwich, both of which are delicious in their own right.\n\nThe daily specials are posted every weekday on the website -- why doesn't everybody do this? -- and the folks at the Sentinel accept phone orders in advance.

It's pretty cool how they take your order on colored post it notes for the kitchen.  I had to wait about 5 minutes for the order to come up after ordering.  The sandwich was much smaller than I expected in terms of size of bread and amount of corned beef.  Still, the tastes were all well-balanced.

It was a nice, sweet, tart and great balance to the protein and oil in the salmon.  The menu board read \"brioche\" so I was also sold on that taste dynamic; I got my sandwich and went a few block; voila... open box and thick light rye bread.  A bit disappointed I was undeterred and truly enjoyed the sensible size; full of natural flavors; Dennis Leary was behind the counter; he is a Chef's Chef--calm, seemingly detached from everything except the food; I was happy to see him there and knew what was coming out of The Sentinel kitchen was going to be brilliant.  To the ultra cool Leary I said \"Thank you, Dennis\" I think I got back a \"yeah\" or \"your welcome.\"  I wished I worked in the FiDi to enjoy wonderful food-- I live in the City but work in the Oakland.  For being just a few miles across the water from each other they might as well be on the other side of the planet or better yet a distant planetoid.  Back to The Sentinel it is a great way to experience Leary's cooking frequently and what a treat that is--I always make my way to Canteen; in many ways I wish there were many types of places like Canteen; small, intimate, serious about the food, and a place where a conversation can be had; Canteen and The Sentinel are homages to this food land of San Francisco.\n\nBuen Provecho!", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

The corned beef sandwich is quite tasty. I didn't enjoy the smoked catfish one so much, though, as it was like a salad made with mayonnaise -- I thought it'd be straight-ahead fish.

The breads are fresh and yummy.  The semi-new addition of a hot meal is kind of fun.  You never know what the various pieces are going to be!  I recommend picking whatever sounds the most unusual, it can be a surprise.  They had a ground lamb with eggplant and raisins and cinnamon and maybe something else that was A.MAZ.ING.

You order, your name is put on a color-coded sticky note and lined up for the chef and line guys.  When it's ready, your name is called.  You really should steup up immediately and take it, or he'll look annoyed.  He'll call your name again - louder, snottier.  If you don't come at that, it goes behind the counter until you come ask for it, at which point you get a withering glance of annoyance.  If you become a regular, loyal customer of the sandwich miracles that he creates, you'll occasionally be rewarded with a free cookie or something.

But shortly after we walked into the deli, they closed the door behind us.  The menu didn't have a lot of choices, but it seemed like it changes frequently and it may be better to go earlier because they'd run out of ingredients to make some of the sandwiches.  I ordered a spicy turkey sandwich on ciabatta bread.  The ciabatta bread was of high caliber and probably one of the freshest if not the freshest ciabatta bread that I've ever eaten.  The meat of the meal consisted of cubed slices of peppered turkey, mustard, and shredded lettuce if I remember correctly.  I thoroughly enjoyed it half way through before the mustard started to get to me, but it was definitely filling and it was packed so much that everything was just falling out like a sloppy joe.

I thought of getting a Flames burger, but as I approached The Sentinel, I saw a turkey sandwich on the menu that I wanted to try.  I had enjoyed the braised pork shoulder, cabbage salad with a side of fresh strawberries the prior week.  When I went to the counter to order, the pleasant  young lady  said they were out of the turkey sandwich, but they did have a hot corn beef sandwich which wasn't on the menu.  The corn beef sandwich comes in a hard ciabatta roll thinly sliced corn beef with shredded cabbage with a light dijon mustard and aged gruyere cheese.  It's absolutely a quality sandwich.  It also came with a light dressed cucumber salad with feta cheese.   I would have to say it's one of the best corn beef sandwich I ever had.  Traditionalist will probably like rye bread, but the crisp ciabatta roll was the key for me.  I know food sells out fast here, but I got lucky  when the turkey sandwich sold out at 1:30p. \n\nIt's a little more what I usually spend for lunch, but it's well worth the quality and freshness.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-17", "description": "Came here for sandwiches the other day and was pretty pleased.  They had a lot of delicious looking things on the menu including a coppa sandwich with pumpkinseed pesto, a pulled pork sandwich (they serve it cold, personally I think ALL pulled pork sandwiches need to be hot!), and lamb & feta meatballs with spicy tomato sauce.  I ended up getting the lamb one and while the meatballs were quite tasty, they were rather big and unwieldy, making the sandwich difficult to eat and impossible to pick up.  My advice - bring a knife or ask them to cut it for you.  My boyfriend got their special of the day which was a salmon salad with butter lettuce, red onion & cucumber w/ a side of chocolate flan and a piece of bread.  The salmon was really good, not just the boring strip of salmon you usually get.  The flan was more custard-y than flan-y but good, esp. if you like chocolate.  I don't think I'd get the lamb meatball sandwich again but that's just because I want to try all the other sandwiches.  I've been told their menu changes frequently which is exciting to me as it seems to be seasonal.  Also - this place has a long line and no places to sit so keep that in mind.  Next time I want to order one of their strawberry lemonades which comes with real chunks of strawberry in it.", "author": "Suzanne V."}

I was expecting it to be really salty but I was completely surprised. The cabbage helped to round out the corned beef flavor. (I mean what's corned beef without the cabbage!) There were a fair amount of people in line but I was able to order and receive my sandwich within 10 minutes. Will definitely try again!", "author": "Mei F."}

I work down in Cupertino, but I worked from home today just so that I could experience The Sentinel. I had the B.A.L.T. (basil, avocado, lettuce, tomato) and my wife had the Rueben. The fresh baked bread of the B.A.L.T. was excellent as it had a tinge of buttery goodness and it was seriously... I don't know... It was... Uhm... I don't have words to describe. The lettuce was NOT iceberg, but like a butter lettuce, the basil was fresh and the avocado was perfect. Oh yeah, and whatever the mayo mixture that was on the sandwich, was really tasty. My wife's Rueben had a perfect mixture of Russian dressing, meat and a grilled bread that was out of this world. The Orange Ade was fantastic -- it tasted like a gourmet Orange Julius -- and the chocolate hazelnut cookie was melt in your mouth good. I'm gonna have to start working from home more often.", "author": "Chris G."}

The coffee and coffee drinks are good and they beat Starbucks any day;  but, $2 for a drip coffee is a bit much, they need to get more in the priceline of the neighborhood.  The food is good but not $11 roast beef sandwich good, then it is only considered decent for the price.  If I spend $8+ for a sandwich I want it to blow me away and to linger on my tastebuds for hours - it does not.  The same goes for an $11 salad, good but small and not worth $11.  I hope they lower their prices and stick around - the small menu concept is nice but not the over priced prices.  Aren't we in a recession?", "author": "DL W."}

I don't care who gets elected as long as there are eating days like these.", "author": "david b."}

Although the menu appears to be a simple take away soup and sandwich shop you will be blown away at your first bite. The food is exquisitely prepared using very creative flavor combinations that one would normally find in an expensive gourmet restaurant. A very good value at a reasonable price.", "author": "volspill"}

I decided to treat myself for lunch yesterday and got their BALT (basil, avocado, lettuce and tomato) and the chilled cucumber soup.  The sandwich was delicious...and I loved how like 2 people when I ordered it made sure I knew there was \"no bacon in it...it's vegetarian\"...i was like \"i know\" hehe...just cracked me up because I am sure there had been previous misunderstandings.  No matter - don't get me wrong, I LOVE BACON (the candy of meat) but by no means did I miss it or think this delectable concoction needed it in any way.   Moving on to the soup...I am not usually a fan of cold soup, but oh my goodness, I couldn't get enough of this stuff.  There was something sweet in it that I coudn't quite nail down. Bell pepper?  Dunno...I knew this place was a 5 star, but needed some time to work into it.  Service again was fast, carefully prepared, and personal...there were obviously people in line who go several times a week, who Dennis and the staff were quite chatty with but even though I was a newbie, I didn't feel neglected.  Keep up the good work!  Next time I need to try the desserts and ades which look amazing too.", "author": "Urbo O."}
