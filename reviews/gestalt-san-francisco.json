Maybe its the constant allure of the boot or the fact that their name becomes a lot harder to pronounce after a few beers.\n\nPros:\n\n- The beer selection is phenomenal. You'll find yourself staring at the wall for a good 10 minutes trying to pick something out. If you're a fan of German beer, you'll be in for a treat. Spaten Optimator is the way to go. \n\n- Das Boot. 2 liters of whatever beer you fancy. Not many bars in the city have it, so take advantage of this rare experience. The boot will not disappoint. Just make sure you're sober before you start, or else you might have trouble.\n\n- Pinball machines, couches, and German themed decorations. Pretty sweet layout and a nice relaxing feel.\n\n- Relatively spacious. If you can't get a seat on one of the chairs or couches, there's plenty of standing room, even on a busy night. You won't find yourself rubbing up against people.\n\nCons:\n\n- Only one horrid, disgusting bathroom. You'll be really lucky if you don't have to stand in line for it. Doesn't look like they have room to build another bathroom, but it would greatly help.

It's known for being a hipster beer bar in the Mission where you can hang your bicycle on the wall while downing pints of quality international brews. The walls are red, it has a pool table, and the bathroom is gross. There are some well-worn couches/chairs at the front of the bar, but the music (did I mention the live DJ?) might make it difficult to sit back and read. The bar advertises that it's a great place to watch sporting events, and rocks 4 big screen TVs. They also serve various 'wursts, including a vegetarian bratwurst (welcome to SF!!), so nobody has to go hungry. \n\nDrink-wise, they offer 20 beers on tap in additon to a variety of bottled foreign beers, and the bartender will permit you to taste the beers before you buy one. I went with Young's Double Chocolate Stout, which was fantastic. All of my friends enjoyed their draughts, served up in fancy glasses. Prices are generally in the $5-$6 range.\n\nThis Gestalt definitely has a lot of parts, but I'm not sure that it makes a cohesive whole.", "author": "Ray J."}

Oddly enough, I can't really drink hard alcohol all that much anymore. Admittedly, after a few too many brews, I feel a little gassy and bloated.

A skull is a terrible thing to waste.\n\nJust around six on a Thursday, there were only about five people at the bar. Two in plaid. It's a dark bar in the back and I had to strain my myopic eyes to read the menu, though I got by with a little help from my friend. There's a handful of good beers on tap, and many more expensive Belgians and otherwise in bottles. Hoegaarden on tap, so I was happy. There was a small menu of bar food, and the potato salad with bacon was only three dollars and was sehr lecker! The bartender was pretty rude; he reminded me to tip when he gave me my change. Of course I would tip! Why wouldn't I tip? He said that a lot of people don't. I suppose he felt that the revolution would start with me. A whisper in San Francisco would turn into a tornado across the country of people wising up and dropping tips? I tipped as I always do. Hope he's saving up for a plaid shirt. \n\nI sat as far away from that guy as possible, near the front there is a lot of light coming in.

On a Friday night a few weeks ago, this guy threw in the garbage the food my friends ordered (and threw their money back at them across the bar) just because he was annoyed or something with a simple question about whether a side of potatoes was included in their sausage order. There is room for interpretation the way one of the veggie sausages is listed on the menu as it seems to include potatoes (but I believe it's in the actual sausage). \n\nGabe's behavior was uncalled for and a flagrant abuse of his \"authority\" as a bartender. Another friend tried to step in and reason with Gabe like a logical human being but this guy only reacted like a raging a-hole (pardon my language). He does no favors for the bar and should be put into an anger management class. Just to give context, my friends are seriously the nicest people in the world and would not have done/said anything rude to merit this kind of response from the bartender. Regardless of whether he was having a bad night or the bar was understaffed, he should have had more self-control.\n\nAlso to be fair, there were other severs and bartenders who were much nicer but the experience with Gabe will color our opinion of the bar forever.", "author": "Amy B."}

Thankfully, they also had vegan sausages. \n\nThe vegan sausage was delicious. I loved that the bun was toasted. The toasted bun really sealed the deal for me. I ordered the sausage with sauerkraut and onions and tried the two different mustards and even some ketchup.

I originally headed to Monk's Kettle, which I've been wanting to hit up for a month, but was steered away by friends because they don't have TVs. Thus, using the Bill Clinton methodology, we took whatever was close to us and ended up at Gestalt Haus. \n\nThis place does have 20 beers on tap, BUT they don't do pitchers. It's either $5 for a pint or $10 for 0.5L. Kind of expected this place to be cash only, but a part of me still hoped that they'd take credit card. Gestalt Haus is a great sports bar. They have a pool table in the front, but the winning element is their huge projection screen in the middle of the bar. With that, anyone can see, but if you're at the bar, then there are small TVs for you as well.\n\nThe beer selection is pretty legit, ranging from your normal beers to ones like Racer 5 and Drakes 1500. Aside from beer, they also do sell sausages like kielbasa, etc. I didn't try them because I was on a liquid diet, but they smelled good. If you're looking for a unique beer, they do have the double chocolate stout which was actually pretty decent.\n\nWith all bars, the downside is that this place does get packed. I'm going to say its because of the game, but still. I hate waiting 5 min just to get a beer. They have one bathroom but it's pretty grimey.

First, the stools are too short for the bar - you're just about drinking with your elbows at ear level.

Okay, not a big deal, except this place stops serving food to Chinese people at 6pm.  Why would I say such a thing?  We arrived at 6.03pm.  Our non-Asian friend ordered food before we arrived and I asked the bar tender if I could have their special.  He said they were all out, rips the sign off the wall, and walked away.  When I finally got his attention again and asked for a menu, he said there was no food available.  They only served food for lunch while my friend was being served at 6.10pm.  \n\nThere is a shift change and next thing I notice food was being prepared and served.  I am not pleased to say the least.  I tried to get the attention of the new tender (if for nothing but to refill my empty beer glass).  Things quickly got worse, the new tender throws a full stein of beer across the bar, across at least 5 customers, hits the walls, drenches beer over a ladies' purse, cell phone, and date.  A foul shout match between the tender and about 3 Middle Eastern ex-customers ensue for about 2 minutes.  The bartender does not offer to help the beer soaked customers clean up.  He does offer us a round of free beer but must have noticed the one Asian outlier and never gave us any beer.  \n\nTo make a shitty evening worse, we go to a Vietnamese restaurant afterwards which gave me the runs and my boy friend stayed out with another group of friends until 3am...FML (different website but I think the clause fits)", "author": "Linda W."}

PREEEEEcisely what I says to myself.\n\nBack when the Mission didn't have a 20-50% chance of making me upchuck in my mouth, I thought this place was THEE SHIZ.

The beer selection is impressive, whether you're looking for something light, hoppy, dark, sophisticated, Belgian, whatever. They have a beer for all palates...assuming, that is, that you're a beer drinker. And the sausages!! Well, I won't lie and pretend that I care about any of the actual meat options, but there are a few, and I'm sure they taste much as a sausage should. What I care about are my VEGAN SAUSAGE options. What makes a me happier than a big ol' beer and a fake sausage on a sunny and/or rainy day? Well, quite a few things, but that's beside the point. The vegan sausages are delicious.

Take my favorite option, \"The Ray Davies.\" This baby features bacon dripped with honey, cheddar cheese, slice apples and house aioli, served up on 7-grain bread.

She was some hipster girl who was playing such shitty bar music; slooow-ass, boring 80's music. Playing 80s is one thing, but she only played the slowest ones. After every song ended, my group and I would audibly heckle the DJ's terrible playlist and yell for something upbeat. She responded by turning the music up... that little bitch. If I owned a business where the patrons typically liked to come and drink at least 2 liters of beer, I would want them to enjoy themselves and play the music they want to hear, lest I'd have to deal with 2 to 3 liters worth of anger.\n\nShe wasn't getting it. Every single song ended with me screaming, \"Hey DJ Power Trip, play better music already!!!\" and giving her disapproving expressions every time she looked in my direction. At one point, my friend and I mocked her by slow-dancing in front of the DJ booth at full-arm's length with nervous expressions, like the middle school dances this bitch is apparently used to working at. \n\nI eventually finished my beer, waited until the song was over so that the DJ could clearly hear me screaming that she completely sucked dick at entertaining us all night, and returned home as the proud owner of one of the massive glass steins that Gestalt serves liters of beer in.\n\nAs far as beer and sausage, the place is still as good as it gets.

You're always welcomed with a smile and you won't want for friendly conversation at the bar, which offers a dozen superb beer choices, equally weighted between balanced German brews, Belgian (and -style) selections, and a few local choices, including the lovely Brit-style Napa Smith Pale Ale. \n\nThe attention to detail in their food is admirable. The sausage buns are carefully selected, Their ingredients are local and fredh. Just today I witnessed them steaming fresh artichokes for sandwiches so that they don't have to use canned ones anymore. And the tomatoes? Heirlooms. \n\nThis place should be busier, and they should charge a bit more, hopefully the latter before the former. I look forward to returning soon.", "author": "Tim T."}

Gestalt Haus is no longer the rustic, beer-lover's bicyclist destination it once was. It is now, in fact, a generic, boring, and inappropriately flashy bourgeois hangout. The young and stylish danced to loud hip-hop music, whereas before, scruffy (but still young and stylish) cyclists brooded over enormous liter-mugs of beer, playing Led Zeppelin on the juke-box. Now the indoor bicycle rack has vanished, and so, it seems, have the comely bicycle boys. They now serve ale in fancy tall glasses instead of comically oversized mugs, and, in my humble opinion, the worst transgression of all, they no longer serve my favorite ale, Fat Tire. Too plebian for them now, I imagine. They now only serve extremely crafty and foreign beers I've never heard of or do not care for.\n\nSo sad, this pub had much promise. In a few years, it may have even become a proper dive. But alas, it's gone astray and will never be the same again. Needless to say, I shall not set foot in Gestalt Haus ever again.", "author": "Mortimer P."}

If you're wondering why I only gave it three stars, it's because I would have given it 4 stars except for the bathroom situation, which is a BIG ding.\n\nC'mon now, you cannot have ONE bathroom for both men and women in a beer-heavy bar! Some of us are stricken with Tiny Bladder Syndrome, which means we need to piss after every delicious beer on tap that you serve (and by the way, the beers on tap are GREAT. They have a fantastic selection of rotating taps and beers in bottles as well). But one bathroom?? I feel bad for the men who have to wait for us ladies to do our business. Cuz we womenfolk are SLOW. I guess they could always just go outside and pee on the walls? \n\nPlease, Gestalt, add another bathroom. I'm just asking for ONE more, that's all, and I'll be much happier and come to your lovely little bar more often.\n\nThe bar itself is neat. Small, dark but not so dark that you can't see who you're about to make out with (which may or may not be a good thing). There's not a ton of seating but it makes more sense to have more standing room areas, which is what Gestalt has. They also have two ledges at the front so you can lean, flirt and look at people pissing on the walls outside (For the record, I have never seen anyone piss on the walls, but it's the Mission so I won't be surprised if I do, and given the bathroom situation...). There is also a pool table at the front, and Big Game Hunter in the back. Fun atmosphere, low-key, nice people. I have met some really fun, nice people at Gestalt. The bartenders I've experienced have all been hard-working and attentive. Yes, they could use more bartenders but maybe they're balancing their bartender to bathroom ratio (I need to get over the bathroom situation, I know, I know).\n\nI believe the beers on tap ran about $6, though I was a little drunk so I can't remember clearly. Prices are not super cheap but also not overpriced so they are on par. Cash only, like many places in the Mission. It usually doesn't get as crowded as Elixir, Killowat or 500 Club on the weekends.\n\nI've not had their food but maybe next time. After they get a second bathroom, that is.", "author": "Logan The H."}

Now that's a commute I can believe in.  But to my surprise there was not a single bike in the place.  I was so baffled I ended up leaving mine outside.\n\nAt any rate, most of these sausage-&-beer operations are epically sprawling biergartens (Broken Record or Zeitgeist), some even taking it so far as to be technically two separate entities (like Toranadosamunde's).  Gestalt Haus, on the other hand, inverts the concept with a very compact feel.  And while this would be genius in, say, West Portal, at 16th & Mission I'm not so sure there's enough bar to go around, at least on Saturday night (though admittedly, I'm not sure of any Mission bar that I really dig on Saturday).\n\nBut a happy hour chowdown on Hawaiian-Portuguese(!) sausage washed down with unfamiliar beers from familiar brands (like Speakeasy's White Lightning Wheat or Moonlight's Twist of Fate Bitter)--what's not to like about that?", "author": "Wes M."}

By the time you get halfway through it, it's warm and flat anyway, and your hand is starting to cramp up from hoisting that gigantic heavy mug (at least it is if you're a wussy herbivore girl like me). But it's a good value, and it's very generous of them to offer it in that quantity.\n\nThe bartenders here are also super cool. Very chill, very friendly and generous. If you're into the whole hipster-fixed-gear-revolution-look-thingy, then you'll probably also find them pretty sex-ay.\n\nIt's too bad they're in the same neighborhood as Zeitgeist.

Since that crazy yelp happy hour at Gestalt Haus the other night ended with some crazy drunken sliding at the Seward Street Slides I kinda thought I'd injured myself there somehow. \n\nThe it occurred to me the sore area was right where the handle rested of that incredibly HEAVY beer glass I was holding all night. I had one... okay, one and a half... liter beers at Gestalt and I was pickled. That was a huge beer, in a heavy glass with an alcohol content of 8.something percent - whoa doggy.\n\nHave to admit, I live around the corner and while I was excited to see it opening (who doesn't love a good beer and sausage joint?) I've never patronized the place til now.

After making it through the light gauntlet of elbows from the tables lined along the bar you finally make it towards the back and can breathe easy.\n\nSo why bother?  Easy, the beer.  Delicious German beers and most of the Speakeasy brews are available on tap.  All pints are a flat  $4 which is great.  Good attempt to try to make it German by offering beers in half-liters and liters.  Eventually at some point you'll hopefully be able to snag a table and enjoy your beers, making it actually a pretty fun place for a few rounds of \"would you rather?\"\n\nSomeday this place might endear me enough to get a 4, but for now it's a 3 and a solid backup for when Kilowatt is far too crowded.\n\nOh yeah, is there more than one bathroom in this place?  If not, that is something that should really get taken care of given this place only serves beer.", "author": "Steven R."}

It's not big so you may have trouble finding a table but I actually prefer to sit at the bar because the drunker I get, the easier it will be for me to procure one of their delicious sausages. This place actually has really, really good sausages! and it's so perfect with the beer.  I ate three sausages in one evening, and thank goodness for that because I suspect they had something to do with the fact that my hangover the next day was not as bad as I thought it would be. \n\nThe one thing is that the sausages kinda take a while to cook, but it is so worth it. And they grill the bun too. I also really like that they have bike racks inside of the bar so you can keep an eye on your ride while boozing.  And as it has been stated before, this place isn't great for meeting chicks because it's mostly dudes that come here. But great for me because they are all hot bike messengers!

They were playing great music plus it looked like there is actually room to walk around, which is amazing for a bar in the Mission on a Friday night. I didn't realize that it was a beer and wine bar at first so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't order a regular drink. However, the bartender was pretty helpful and helped me pick out a beer that I would like. We were also able to get seats on the couches at the front of the bar. The only downfall for me was the fact that they do not have a full bar. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this place to others who are looking for a place in the mission where you can easily get to a bar.", "author": "Kate G."}

She got shouted at across the bar in a very merry-killing way. The whole bar went silent. I probably would have cried. Dude, it's a crappy bar....with antlers. Lighten.

Why did you have to ruin a really cool spot?\n\nIn addition to the above, as if that wasn't enough, the bartender was a total choad. On two separate occasions he was rude to me, then my girlfriend went up to get her beer and he was a jerk to her as well. What's your deal man?

Hurrah!!!  That deserves another star!  4/3/07\n\nLet me preface this by saying that many of my formative beer experiences had to do with the second best beers in the world, German beers.  Coming from Chicago, crappy bars that were basically someone's living room, stocked excellent beers in every neighborhood I lived in.  So when I heard about Gestalt Haus, I got excited!  Mistake.  Always have low expectations in these kind of situations so you won't have your heart broken.\n\nI checked out this place last night.  It was pretty slow around 9pm with about 8 or 9 patrons in the bar.  I walked by the two level bike rack in the bar.  Very cool, this place was getting at least a couple of stars just for that even if it's run by Nazis.  I asked the bartender if they carried my favorite beer, Haecker Schorr Weiss.  He sort of looked at me blankly.  At that moment I categorized this as a hipster bar not a German bar.  After a small sigh I ordered an Erdlinger, one of the few German beers they had, and plopped down at the bar.  Although Gestalt Haus isn't what I'd hoped for, it does have some positive points including serving sausages as well as Californized food, a good selection of non-German beers, a pool table and a great location on 16th near Valencia.

He told me his name, so I could properly yelp him, but I warned him I was drinking and would likely forget...which I have. I did say I would just describe him as the cute guy with the dark hair, so if you see him you'll know who I am talking about. When I first ordered our beer the keg blew halfway through the first pint. He gave us that half a beer to tide us over and said come back in 3 minutes. I did, and by the time I came back there were two beautiful, frosty beers waiting for me....that is service!! He also gave us money for the jukebox to pick songs to have singalongs to (after we were belting out Guns and Roses rather loudly and obnoxiously). Clearly he doesnt mind people having a good time at this bar.

(We are psychology students so we thought Gestalt would be fun/funny...) The bartender was a total jerk and basically pushed this old woman on the floor--granted she was a mentally ill homeless woman that probably went in there quite often to bother the patrons--but nevertheless, no one deserves to be pushed around. She was sitting on the floor with no pants on, so two of my friends went and helped her up and walked her outside. Bartender got mad about that and said they had to LEAVE the bar for HELPING her. WTF?! How does this even make sense? He proceeded to push my friend across the room and throw beer in his face. As we were exiting he said something to the effect of: \"I hate all you of and I am glad you are leaving\" (with expletives thrown in). Hipster angst? I don't know...All I know is that I will never go back there. Also, they ran out of vegan sausages. :P", "author": "Tiffany P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-21", "description": "I've been quietly procrastinating the writing of this review for...well, when was November?  I can hardly remember those 8 months thanks to Gestalt Haus.  But I don't even call it Gestalt anymore.  My friends and I just call it the bar.  \n\nTo be real, I've got a lot of bias behind those five stars, but I'm also a very 'observant' and 'detail-oriented' woman.  (Is this a resume?)  \n\nI don't like hipsters, and I sure don't like fixie heads.  But sometimes I dress like one, and Murphy sold me an apparently pretty sweet fucking road bike a couple months ago.  I ride it.  A lot.  And I'm friends with many of these fixie riders.  So I'm also a hypocrite, but that keeps life interesting.  And so does this bar.  \n\nFor example:  You never know if the lock on the bathroom door will be fixed that night or totally busted.  You never know when suddenly the juke has some new shit (that I've never heard of/love/hate).  You never know if some Marina imports will come in and trip on the sinking floorboards, or when the place will reek of sweaty, unwashed biker hipsters.  You never know when they'll re-felt the pool table (as they did last week).  \n\nThen there's also the givens:  You know that every night the beer will taste so fucking delicious and that you could try something new and learn more about beer.  You know that the potato salad will warm your belly and make you want to marry bacon.  You know that John will yell Stella at least once.  You know you'll dance/interpretive dance/sing your face off to Smooth Criminal and Bohemian Rhapsody.  You know you'll make a new friend or check someone out.  You know you'll learn something about road bikes.  You know Kev will take breaks at Double Dutch.  You know you'll play a round of pool with people who are really good and people who suck balls.  You know you'll have more pints, half-liters and liters than you said you would before you walked in.  You know you'll roll your eyes at someone who is too lazy or too cool to put their bike up, or is so cool that they can balance on their fixie no hands for minutes.  You know Murph will slap his arm to exemplify his need for speed and love for bikes.  \n\nI wished the bar stools were taller, but I got used to it.  I worried about the leaking and running toilet, but then sometimes I'd fix it.  I got used to the too-bright xmas lighting, and now I'm used to the perfectly dim xmas lighting that Murph and Kev rigged.  I've developed a love for taxidermy and have increased my knowledge of such.  I've learned about the art of running a business.  I've ignored the gross things.  I've wished for different tunes, but then some new things have come in and I've learned new music.  \n\nI've slept here, blacked out here, puked, pissed, definitely shit here, danced, cried, yelled, laughed.  I've even gotten my dad shit faced here.  Mostly I've just had the fucking time of my life.  Who said college was the best time?  We were dubbed mascots.  It's a good relationship, and a good bar.  \n\nIt's not trying to be perfect.  It wants to make you have fun, relax, learn stuff about beer, hang out, and not worry about getting kicked out if you make a mess of your coaster, brat, or beer.  And as it succeeds at those things, it IS perfect.\n\nAnd they DO do take-out of brats and potato salad, though so far the majority thinks they don't.", "author": "Loren R."}

The bike racks near the front of the place really threw me a curve, as did some of the patrons that were dressed in bike/messenger shorts.  But then, the placement of the pool table kinda brought it all together.  This was a neighborhood watering hole that welcomed the environmentally conscious to their rustic bar.  Situated on one of the busiest cross-streets in the Mission, Gestalt Haus forte is beer...in what looked to be about 20 different ones on tap.  The difference between any other bar in the Mission and Gestalt seems to be the choice of glasses...pints, half-liter, or 1 liter glasses.  It didn't dawn on me that you could get something larger than a pint until Omid and Ed 'brung' it.  I couldn't even fathom finishing a liter.  So I proceeded to take baby steps...start with a pint, then a half-liter, and then another half-liter.  I didn't make it to the liter, but FWIW, stick with a pint instead of a half-liter.  You're getting more for your money ($0.25 vs $0.296 per oz) with the pint.  The liters do make it look like you're at Oktoberfest, but if you don't drink fast, the beer does get warm.  It's nicer to have a cold fresh one at hand.  Also not to be missed, their selection of organic sausage sandwiches.  A good alternative if you're not bacon dog cart friendly.  This place did take a while before the crowds started to filter in, but once they did, it did get noisy.  Definitely a cool stop to lounge in the Mission.", "author": "JeFF T."}

Now, I don't ride my bike that much, I definitely shower like I should, and, I change my pants frequently. I guess three is what they get from me. The clientele here is made up of all the USUAL SUSPECTS you'd find on 16th St. in the mission. Guy with skinny jeans who pulled his clothes out from the dirty clothes hamper, his equally stinky chick with horizontally striped shirt and some hi-liter yellow high heels, the dude who has pierced his face into oblivion cuz daddy just couldn't say \" I Love You\", and, the VEGAN NAZIS who obviously love the texture of meat but don't want to do what it takes to get it. PU$$IES. Anyway, you should go here if you don't feel like going to the lower Haight to get a Brat from Rosamunde and eat it at the Toronado. I would suggest you do the latter first.", "author": "santiago g."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-03-26", "description": "i used to have the perfect relationship with gestalt. it was my main standby, as i could always ensure that it wouldn't be too crowded, the lights wouldn't be offensive and friends could park their bikes inside.\n\nhow i long for the days of yore. gestalt has remade itself into some sort of lounge-y, red-walled, bad-lighting spot. i wanted to like the new gestalt because i'd loved the old one so much, but when they took the bike rack out, gestalt became unrecognizable to me. \n\na little part of me is holding out hope that gestalt will realize the folly of its ways, but i suppose that depends on whether they care about losing many loyalists. i, for one, have no desire to go back to this now-nondescript locale.", "author": "Lisa T."}

WHAT?!! DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?! yup, about the only thing that really turns me off is the tendency for that volume to be turned up SO HIGH THAT YOU CAN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK. c'mon now, one does not have to be deaf to be cool and hip. turn down the music, hand me a pint, grill me a lamb sausage and all will be fine.", "author": "ray e."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-02", "description": "this is one of the first bars that i discovered when i moved to sf. they opened on halloween of 2006..i moved here on 11/2/06. i was immediately drawn to the vegan sausages, dark interior (the walls are painted black and stewn with white christmas lights) and litres of beer for a good price. i have always had a good time there. even when i go by myself a stranger always strikes up a conversation with me. theres always cute boys and if you play pool someone willing to play a game or two. i do advise you to respect the litres...espescially of double daddy. theres been many a time when ive abused them and gotten out of hand. i dont go there as much as i used to but i am always down for a litre and a vegan sausage.", "author": "shawna s."}
