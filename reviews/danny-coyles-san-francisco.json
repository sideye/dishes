The bar is pretty spacious with ample seating, good drinks, and 3 restrooms. The bartenders are really nice so that's always a  plus. I ordered an Irish coffee and the bartender offered to make a fresh pot of coffee since it was 10pm and they didn't have any coffee at the time. I love the smell of fresh brewed coffee (they use Peet's) so gladly obliged to wait 10 mins for my Irish coffee which was delicious!\n\nSaturday night was a good crowd.. there's a jukebox so different types of music was playing all night. Our group of 10 had a great time hanging out at Danny Coyle's. Definitely a low-key, laid bar to head back to in the near future.\n\nCash is king but if you prefer plastic then it's minimum of $20 for credit card.", "author": "Ruby C."}

It has Carlsbad on draft, something I hadn't seen in a looooong time and a few other drafts like Lagunitas. Again, no real complaints and I understand a bar needs to stock certain libations based on what customers order but it was disappointing that the bar only stocked one kind of rye whiskey. No Templeton or even George Dickel but that's ok too. I'd check it out again if I am ever in the hood, as it IS a nice place with friendly folk. Cheers.", "author": "Frank L."}

After graduating from UNC in 2010, Danny Coyle's has served as a hub throughout the college basketball season for my friends and I. We often find ourselves here for more than 20 games a year, not even counting the ACC and NCAA tournaments. I wouldn't be anywhere near as close to the Carolina community as I am now without our regular gatherings for games here.\n\nDanny Coyle's is pretty much what you'd expect from an Irish pub. While it's a Carolina bar, it definitely serves a lot of other sports teams, and at times it can get a bit crowded. It's not really my stop-over for everyday drinks, but I have a lot of friends that live in the Haight area that swear by it as a great nightcap spot. Brian is an awesome bartender and always takes great care of his guests (and is EXTREMELY patient with the rowdy Carolina crew).\n\nYou'll find plenty of Carolina memorabilia around the bar, but don't let that scare you off. Coyle's is clean, friendly, very comfortable and has good drinks (and great drink specials). And it's also located in the middle of Haight, so it's a great stopover for people passing through the area. I wouldn't say it's a great bar for tourists or visitors, but it's great for locals --\u00a0especially if you're a Carolina fan.", "author": "Matthew L."}

Kinda dirty, no one buses the tables from the previous people for the whole duration of the game. It is what it is though. Roudy/passionate crowd to watch my team in SF!", "author": "Kathleen C."}

I asked a friend who I knew moved there a few years ago if he knew of a \"truly special place\" where a man can watch his frustrating, liquor inducing team watch a game\" and he answered with 2 letters (not words, letters).\n\nDC's.\n\nAfter further elaboration, he added me to the facebook group... I promptly added my friend who would be attending and forgot about it until football preseason began... Something curious happened, I began seeing TRUE FANS (I live in San Diego and they are few and far between here) posting playfully vulgar comments and quips about how excited/dreading our season would be. I became active in the group, posting a few vulgar comments of my own and before I knew it... I was driving 10 hours from SD to SF to join 40+ ROARING CHARGERS FANS for the Chargers/Niners game. \n\nI arrive on the eve of the game to a roar and friendly bouncer. He smiles, lets me in and I'm oddly known by multiple people I have never met. What is next is a blur but I'll try to decipher the memorable aspects...\n\n- The bar is small, but cozy.\n- The people are friendly to the point where you wonder if you should put your wallet in your front pocket (It never left my pants, btw).\n- A drink is never far away, I was a bartender for 5+ years and this crew is ON.THEIR.GAME.\n- Charger fever is alive here.\n\nI heard laughable scoffs that this place was a seahawks bar. In all honestly... good for them. It's a lot like seeing a girl who suddenly got cute but is still absolutely clueless and terrible to talk to. If you meet one \"12th man\" in here that actually knows who Jim Mora is, I will legitimately die of shock.\n\nHands down, best Chargers bar I've ever been to and has some of the greatest human beings here that I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. \n\nANTONIOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\n\nGATES.", "author": "Jerry M."}

My flakey friend who was supposed to meet me to watch the game didn't come through so I turned to my BFF yelp (is that sad?) and searched \"San Diego Chargers Bar.\"  Danny Coyle's came up.  I trekked it there, big suitcase and all, and arrived to what looked like an average pub.  There was a Christmas tree in the corner and I pushed my suitcase behind it and got to work.  Bloody Mary was mediocre.  Then I hit the Speakeasy on tap.  Yum.  After trying to mix in with the rowdy fans I realized that there was no room and found a lone Chargers fan next to the only empty seat in the house and plopped down next to him.   Things were slow at first but the more we scored the rowdier it got.   \"San Dee-aygo Super Chaaaargers\" was belted many times.  I saw more cool Chargers paraphernalia there than I have seen in all of San Diego!  Vintage button downs, Mitchell and Ness T's, and even their own \"Dany Coyle's Super Chargers\" gear (someone please tell me where to get it)  \n\nI am meeting people left and right listening to everyone's San Diego stories and a chick decked out in head to toe Chargers gear grabs my hand and hauls me to the rowdy end of the bar where a tray of Don Julio awaits.  Two shots later we are all friends for life and my suitcase gets placed behind the safety of the bar by a nice gentlemen.  Of course the Chargers beat the Bangles and they play the entirety of the Super Chargers song over the speakers and everyone sings along.  It was probably the most fun I have ever had singing that song!  \n\nIf ever in SF again on a Super Sunday I will be there....", "author": "Juliana M."}

This bar does not know how to control its rowdy, disrespectful patrons and they do not respect the neighbors that live around them. I have been to many bars that reside in neighborhoods (gay bars) and I can say that they really respect the people that live around them by keeping the noise down. \n\nThis bar could care less about that. I have witnessed this bar opening their doors to rowdy guest as earl as 5am. Loud music, screaming and hooting and hollering. Why the bar feels the need to keep their front and back doors open to let the noise travel far is beyond me. Also I have seen their guest climbing and setting up a smoke camp outside peoples front steps until 2am. Whoever owns this place does not seem to care much about the people that live around them and who have to maybe work in the morning.\n\nThis place is a great bar, but they really need to start taking lessons from Castro and SOMA gay bars and learn how to keep the noise levels down and control their guest.", "author": "Robert Shawn W."}

One of my friends got a cocktail, which was strong and well prepared. I probably should have ordered that instead, but oh well.\n\nThe crowd wasn't very big, but there was one obnoxiously loud older gentleman who probably wanted to kill himself when his baseball team lost.

It's nice, and has a great Irish style pub feel to it(obviously)... But my friend and I went to Danny Coyles one Saturday morning to watch English Premier league Soccer. The bartender was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. But a day later I go to use my debit card and it wouldn't work. I checked my statements and realized Coyles had charged for 2 purchases...one being 16$ for my soda and my friend had a few whiskey and cokes. The other purchase was for 40$. I had no idea what it was for, but I knew for sure I didn't spend an even 40$ there, on a second purchase. Since it being the end of the month and my bills auto-deducting from my checking account, the 40$ over drafted me. (Plus an overdraft fee) I called Coyles and the person working seemed willing to help. They wrote down my number and said they would call the next day. I heard nothing. I called again, and this time I was given the cold shoulder and treated like I was accusing them of stealing. I was very calm and polite and made sure I mentioned to him that I was just inquiring as to what was going on. They said the owner would contact me the next day. The next day my bank called and said that Coyles had cancelled the purchase, so I checked to see with my own eyes, and sure enough it was reversed. I never heard from any owner or anything. I was disappointed because it was actually a great place to watch a soccer game, and because it was a nightmare to get the situation worked out.

Ok- let's do this! I pulled out my Yelp! app and typed in irish coffee and lo and behold Danny Coyle's popped up. I've been there before to watch hockey games and I believe I've played trivia there once or twice (not enough to remember it being as good as everyone says it is), but never to drink irish coffees so I figured I should call first. And I suspected (with it being a bar) that the phone would just ring and ring. THE BARTENDER PICKED UP! On the second ring. I was so in awe that I think I sat on the line not speaking for a moment until the bartender was like, \"umm, hello?\" \"Oh- hi! We were wondering if you serve irish coffees.\" \"We do.\" \"If we were over there in 15 mins would that work?\" \"Sure, I'll brew a fresh pot of coffe.\" \"I love you (my group told me to say this).\" \"I love you too.\" Major swoon! \n\nWhat do you know, 15 mins later, we step into Danny Coyle's and not only does the smell of fresh brewed coffee fill the bar, but he is warming up the glass coffee cups.

There was good variety of subject matter (music, current events, sports, pop culture, history, etc.).  \n\nThey had baseball and soccer on the tvs, which was also nice.  And, like many other people here, I have to give a shout-out to their bathrooms!  Very clean, and there was a third one, which essentially turned into a 2nd women's room - awesome!  And it's in the middle of the bar, so you can still hear and participate in the trivia when you're standing in line.

There was wall to wall people, almost unable to move, but OK, it's playoffs, I expected that.  And they played the \"San Diego SuperChargers\" song!! After muscling my way to the bar, I stole a bar seat where there were 3 bartenders for the whole bar. The service was quite prompt for how busy it was, I didn't wait long for a decently priced drink at all. Despite the large crowd, there was never a line for the bathroom. \n\nThe only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is there was one bartender who was very obnoxious. He was wearing a Radiers t-shirt and talking lots of smack to all the patrons there. I understand that he may be a Raiders fan, and dislike the Chargers, but you work at a CHARGERS BAR!! My only regret was giving this douche bag a big tip before I heard him run his mouth. This guy alone would make me not want to go there again. He sat down every 5 minutes to eat, leaving only 2 bartenders busting their ass, while being rude the whole time. For this reason alone, I would avoid this bar, or at least that employee. It was appalling.\n\nOther than that one person, the experience there was good. Good crowd, fast drinks, and Chargers fans!!", "author": "krista z."}

I'd be a horrible realtor.\n\nWell, after a trip to Martin Macks on some hazy night that left me without my favorite jacket, of which I had to retrieve the next day, I got to speaking to the bartender, while partaking in the hair of the dog, I learned about the plan of DC.  I'd give it a shot...they returned my jacket.  Well, that and I can see it from my window making it definitly stumble distance from my bed...or any other flat surface in my house.  So, in other words...I was going to check it out anyway but the jacket return made me feel like a trip was deserved.\n\nInterior:  Not as charming as the old place but damn clean and accessable.  This is so nice when meeting a group of friends.  The bathroom is always nice.  The bar is always clean.  The lighting is OK and the TVs are doable as well.

My girl can vouch for the other bartenders as well.  They are all very friendly and make it a point to get to know their customers.  Again, another shoutout to Brian.

There has never been a time when he hasn't made me feel like and old friend returnng back to the bar.  \n\nI agree w/ a comment earlier about gentrification.  As a Planner myself I know the pitfalls of certain redevelopment and resettlement patterns but when done right, also allowing for market forces, a mutually beneficial path will emerge.  DC is an example.  Yes the lower haight has a steeped history of being passed over for more trendy neighborhoods...thank god for that.  However, if things never change it leads to stagnant neighborhoods.  A measured amount of new blood and new approaches can retain old values but add vigor to accomplish the overall goal.

There was a group of us there, probably 7-10 people.  A lot of us are bartenders ourselves, including myself.  We were not a rowdy bunch, just looking to have a good time together.  The bar looked great, it had a very comfortable atmosphere to it.  Unfortunately, the woman behind the bar had to ruin our experience.\n    When I first arrived, I soon noticed the the bartender had a brash personality, a little 'rough around the edges'.  I watched as she helped the people next to me, and the way she communicated with them seemed to make them a little uncomfortable.  I didn't think much of it, I actually found it a bit entertaining to watch these people squirm as she did her best to give them lousy service.  \n     Pretty soon the rest of my party showed up, and we started ordering drinks.  We were all together for no more then 10 minutes when one of my friends tells the bartender a joke that he had been telling the rest of the group.  The joke had a bit of sophomoric humor to it, but nothing overly offensive.  After asking my friend to repeat the joke, the bartender starts ridiculing and snapping him, almost as if he insulted her.  I don't remember it verbatim,  but it was basically \"I'm 34 years old, why would you tell me something so stupid\", but really laying into him in a very unnecessary way.\n     After completely spitting on our good time, the rest of the group tried to collect ourselves from that incredibly awkward and unnecessary encounter. As we started to buy some more drinks.  Another friend of mine called the bartender over to buy the birthday boy a drink.  After ordering the drink, the bartender starts to criticize him for making the birthday boy pay for his own drink, which he clearly did not do.  After trying to explain to her that this wasn't the case (it was loud and it was hard to hear), we made the decision that we needed to leave this place ASAP.\n     So we left, and had a great rest of the evening at the bar down the street. \n  So, in conclusion, the bar is pretty, and seems to have a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, even with our best efforts we could not enjoy ourselves, thanks to the unpleasant woman (euphemism) behind the bar.
