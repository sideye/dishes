The last cake I have I have to wait and pre-order.  If I prefer order, shouldn't it be freshly made? And it was not that good, tasted several days old. It was like a zoo with so many customers ordering birthday cakes. I am sure that is why the quality went downhill. I was disappointed and they have raised their price also. From now on I would just get the small  buns instead of birthday cakes it's not worth it.  Recently, I am not so sure about their cakes, the sponge cakes looks light and fluffy, and looks fresh with warm condensation in the bag.  It was so blend, lack of any egg flavors, full of baking soda and plain flour, and stale almost turn bad milk taste. Yuck.  Tempted to return to the store but am afraid of the rude cashier.

Everyone always asks me where I get the cake from, and I say it's a little Chinese bakery a few blocks from my house. I typically get the mango cake and it's less than $30 and looks fancy af. Other mentions are the green tea cake and the mocha cake. Both are good and more of a mousse style cake. I've tried the chestnut, and the strawberry/mango and those aren't as good. So if you're looking for a quick easy place to pick up a great looking fresh fruit or mousse cake, look no further!\n\nAside from the cake, I've tried a number of their buns, and they are also alright. They are a little more expensive than most normal Chinese bakeries, but a little cheaper than Sheng Kee, to put that into perspective. Friends and family have enjoyed the pork puff bun, the bbq pork bun, the pineapple bun, and the hot dog bun. My personal fave is this sponge cake loaf, it looks like a rectangle and is packed in a paper bakery sleeve. It's about 5 bucks for the entire loaf, but it's like a large sponge cake, yum!", "author": "Eva C."}

Nothing different, nothing stood out except their green tea crepe cake which I'll explain. Located right on the corner near China town. Came across this little bakery after leaving Stinkin Rose. I was craving sweets and the pretty baked goods in the window caught my eye. Very typical Asian style bakery where you grab a tray, tongs, and get all excited piling up all the sweet goodies. Also, like most Asian bakeries I am finding that they have the most beautifully decorated pastries, but they're not as good as they look. \nToday's pastry picks;\n-Black sesame toast: simple, soft, fresh. I actually liked this. Very subtle black sesame taste to this loaf of bread. 4/5 stars.\n-honey comb: this was odd. Sweet interesting fast to\nIt. I didn't like the texture, it was kind of gelatinous, chewy 2.5/ stars\n- mango mousse: this is one of those pretty desserts I was talking about. But it was bleh. The fresh mango fruit that was on top was not ripe and sweet although mangoes are currently in season. The flavor wasn't good and the cake part of it was dry. 2/5 stars\n-green tea crepe cake: I saved the best for last. I was actually very surprised. This. Was. Amazing!! It's in the cooler section of the bakery, packed in a plastic container. As soon as I opened it I got a whiff of the pleasant sweet floral fragrance. It was also very pretty delicate looking dessert. Numerous thin green layers of crepe inbetween a thin spread of filling. I enjoyed eating this very much. \nOverall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I was passing by again like today I would definitely pop in to get me another one of those green tea crepe\nCakes", "author": "Sharon P."}

We had just finished eating our meal and I dismissed it at first. It had onions and dried pork on the sides so I was like, \"Meh\" at first. We put it aside and had no intention of even touching it. \n\nWhat changed my mind?\n\nThe smell eventually drew me in.\n\nAfter a couple of hours of just staring at us, I said \"Eff it.\" and I went in for a bite. The first bite got to me as it was sweet, savory and with just the right texture of fluffiness on the bread. It was like eating dessert and yet it was meaty on the same time. You get the best of both worlds and the combination of flavors and texture in my mouth felt like Heaven and Earth coming together. OK, that's a little bit overboard, but they were hella good. In fact, I immediately asked my co-worker where they get them from and I took a picture and checked it on Yelp.\n\nI went with the Wifey a couple of days later as she used to live in this part of the neighborhood. This place has certainly changed from what I remember it back in the mid 90's. Parking is a bit of a challenge, which requires a lot of patience and you will eventually find one. Another thing which will requires lots of patience is fighting those old Asian grannies grabbing, tugging, bumping, grinding, cutting and cussing you off just to get their fill.  \n\nIf you're used to fighting them off like at the lines for the free food samples at Costco or the 38 Muni line on Geary, you should be fine.

Let's just say they stopped putting in the full amounts of oil/butter/shortening that is required in the recipe. Instead of soft and moist cakes, these were dry and difficult to swallow. I almost choked my way through eating one of these. Please, please do not give any of the sponge cakes to children. This is a choke hazard. \n\nIf you liked the shredded pork roll, think again. Don't even try to get these. They tend to run out fast and the kitchen fails to re-stock them in time.

Wiping the trays and tongs with a dirty rag is not sanitary nor is it appetizing. \n\nI am very sad and disappointed in this bakery. In the beginning it seems they were trying to go beyond the typical stereotype of a Chinese bakery and create a wonderful business. Now I can see it is all about the money and cutting corners to save a little. Employees look over worked and irritated with customers. No friendly or helpful employee can be found here. Pastries and cakes are not fresh and made poorly. Not enough oil in the cakes and the taste is not like before, lack of sugar? Also, the establishment as a whole is not clean any more.

All the baked goods look as deliciously enticing as they taste and all the credit goes to my Mom for helping me discover FWFB. Let me preface by saying that my mom is probably one of the most \"budget friendliest\" (aka cheapest) people known to man; i.e. she doesn't believe in spending $4-5 for a bowl of wonton mein that you can make at home. So, if she forks down more than $1 for a bao, it must be good! FWFB is a bit pricer than most Chinese bakeries but the superior quality and taste more than makes up for it. \n\nAfter my mom had bought me a FWFB's Pork Sung Bao which is one of their best sellers, I knew I had I had to pay FWFB a visit on my next bakery run. The Pork Sung Bao was ultra soft and fluffy with bits of dried shredded pork throughout that added a rich, porky savoryness. It was the BEST Pork Sung Bao I've had and I was shocked when she told me she got it from a bakery in the unassuming Portola district.\n\nNeeding a cake for a 4th of July BBQ, I came to FWFB this past Monday. Luckily, they were open otherwise I would have been screwed (Thank Gawd for Chinese businesses that open almost 365 days/year). Presentation wise, all of their cakes were simply and beautifully decorated unlike most Chinese bakeries which tend to have a 1980s cheeziness to them. I opted for the Mocha Cake ($23) which was nicely placed in a colorful sturdy box and came with complimentary cake kit (cake slicer, candles, plates and forks). \n\nMOCHA CAKE - LIGHT, SWEET DECADENCE!!!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AUUZV0FOBqhtYM7bUBS_KQ?select=zjU_j1y2qC5a3x34fAk36w\nI grew up eating Chinese cakes, but rarely buy them because they tend to lack eye appeal, but FWFB's Mocha Cake tasted as amazingly good as it looked. The sponge cake was fluffy, airy and moist and the mocha mousse was velvety smooth with a subtle bitterness to cut through some of the richness. It was light with just the right amount of sweetness so you don't feel an ounce of guilt for face shoveling into it. Everyone at the BBQ enjoyed the cake. Even one of my friends who never eats sweets, tried a slice and said it was delicious. \n\nSchubert's Bakery use to be my go-to bakery for cakes, but I think I've just found my new favorite bakery. And as many Yelpers have mentioned, it's TRUE...FWFB does TRUMP Sheng Kee Bakery!\n\nP.S.- Brownie points for the incredibly nice workers that call their female customers Leng Loi.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-03-20", "description": "As I grow older, my tastebuds have also started to become more...shall we say... corrupt. I started appreciating the finer things in life that are not necessarily good for you. Cured meats, smoked animal proteins, fattier cuts of cha siu/bbq pork, marinated innards (except liver and particular uber nasty bits), very well executed carb based dishes from certain rice plates to old world style Italian pasta to lo mein drizzled with shrimp or fish roe (karasumi, bottarga, wuyuzi/Taiwanese cured mullet roe...all the same thing). Except I am not sipping on fermented sour grapes while enjoying these rotten yummy pleasures, nor do I consume soju like a poor sod from a K-drama show. But an occasional bottle of Tsing Tao can hit the spot. And it feels like I'm up to no good. I'm just missing other vices like gambling and smoking, which I do not partake.\n\nIn an age where organic foods and eating healthy is important, people freak out at the mention of GMO beans (and thus shy away even from Soon Dubious Korean tofu stews). Organic has been the vogue word at farmers markets and causing a ruckus even in Hong Kong (where if you want to eat healthy you pay 3 times the cost of inorganic from China). \n\nSome say life is short, so why not eat like a pig and enjoy (and maybe pay for it later)....thus the million dollar question: what good is the quality of life if you cannot enjoy foie gras, shark fin (just kidding I'm not enamored with the stuff), abalone, toro, animal protein with insane amounts of fat, and shellfish head/innards/brain juice, or sea urchin gonads, or fatty pork with liver basked in honey sauce, or food deep fried with all sorts of old fashioned lard, without worrying about blood pressure, chloestrol HDL/LDL etc, since we are all going to croak eventually?\n\nSo with that said, one of the finer (unhealthy) things in Hong Kong local food...is a pineapple bun (bor lor bao)...not made with pineapple, but named as such. Baked bun with some sweet dough layers on top. And if it doesn't get any better than that, cut a slit either cross section from the top or on the side like a bagel, and insert a mondo sized slab of salted butter. Pair it with a solid hot HK milk tea (or coffee) and it's one of the best (and worst) things ever for your body. It's ok to skip the butter... but you're missing out. Even better if you can sit down to enjoy fresh piping hot out of the oven, and freshly brewed drink.\n\nIn SF Bay Area there are a dearth of options for being able to savor this combo.\nAnd when that is out of reach, you just take what you can get at a HK caf\u00e9 or a local bakery.\n\nIf geographic location and lack of competition being a factor, it is easy to understand why this bakery gets good reviews. Quick, fast, cheap, and the goods hit the spot and does what it needs to. The baked goods are slightly better packaged, more visually appealing, unlike some of the unrefined fugly you see in parts of Chinatown. It is a favorite for the locals, some of which are Cantonese speakers, but the majority appear to be Toishanese from Southern China (after all this is their territory!). Looking at the words on the wall, it's shorthand Chinese...so the only Hong Kong \"style\" is the approach, but it ends there.\n\nThe baked goods are a bit too sweet for my liking.\n\nEgg tart (dan taat) - cookie crust rendition. Unfortunately even at 8 am, this must be either yesterday's batch...it was as cold as the morning air. Not terribly exciting, but definitely better than something like Hong Kong Bakery in downtown Mountain View, or Sheng Kee\n\nMacau style Portugese egg tart (po taat) - these are at the bottom shelf from the regular egg tarts. Don't bother...these are the worst po taat I've ever had. What is the opposite of \"fancy\"? Head to Sogo Bakery in Burlingame, and if you are lucky to encounter ones fresh out of the oven, they are indeed the Lady Gaga of Egg Tarts.\n\nPork Sung Bun - Looked like a pretty elegant non layered croissant. The inside was sweet...like a coconut paste, and they mixed in the \"pork floss\" (yok sung or rou song in Mandarin). This was more palatable than the egg tarts, but still not quite my bag. Maybe the ham and pork sung hairy bun would be better...but this unfortunately did not blow me away like it did to my other Yelp friends. \n\nHot milk tea - Eeek....again too sweet. But being able to get a hot coffee or hot milk tea here in the AM is already not bad (not like you can find it elsewhere nearby I think). At least it did not give me the runs like some of the other bakeries in the Peninsula that do this drink. It's not HK caf\u00e9 like goodness (like Tak Kee Lee). Maybe a Yin Yang remix would be better (half coffee half hot milk tea)? Don't know.", "author": "Ken K."}

It was fully decorated on top with lots of plastic decorations (some decorations looked like it was from Thanksgiving), but we were here for the cake, so we didn't care that much.\n\nThey wrapped it in a pretty cool box and we told it home and immediately started serving. Considering the Tiramisu was Asian made, it was really good! Had the chocolate, cream, and coffee flavor and it wasn't too sweet which all the older members of the family always appreciate. I enjoyed it and had too slices (though if you put any cake in front of me, don't expect too much leftovers hahaha).\n\nOverall, this cake was good so it's definitely on our list of Asian Bakeries for cake buying.

The location is on a busy street on San Bruno Ave, and parking is sometimes hard to find, but not impossible. Similar to a ShengKee, but their cakes are bomb! I've tried most of the larger cakes for parties, like their greentea mousse cake (which is my favorite), and their regular chinese sponge cake is really good as well because it's not too sweet and has fresh fruit inside. I like chinese cakes because their cream/icing is not buttercream icing and sometimes, after a large meal you just want a light airy cake. \n\nI would say, if you have a party, just call in and reserve a cake. For my grandma's birthday, I tried walking in and picking up a cake, and at least 7 of them were already reserved so I had to settle for something that I didn't originally want to buy.

For about 250 guests, wedding cakes can cost over $1000, which i think is just way too expensive!! Believe me, my husband and I sampled so many cakes (and he doesn't even really like cake!). But whenever bakeries quoted us, it cost almost $1000 bucks, which is just ridiculous for cake! Although my husband doesn't really like cake, he said he does like one type of cake -- mixed fruit cake with whipped cream from Chinese bakeries. He mentioned Fancy Wheat to me, and that he tried stuff from there before. So I checked them out on Yelp and they got great reviews--mostly about their buns and desserts, but they actually do wedding cakes too! \n\nWhen we went to the bakery, there was a huge language barrier since hardly any of the workers speak any English. But I spoke with Cindy, who does speak some English, and she showed us their wedding cake pictures. They don't give out samples of their cakes--you just buy the small cakes they have already made and tell them which one you want for your cake. We ended up ordering a 3 tier cake plus a sheet cake for 250 guests and for HALF the price we would have originally paid if we went with those other fancy bakeries!! Our bottom layer was tiramisu, middle layer was mixed fruit, and the top layer was strawberry mango mousse. All were delicious, especially the tiramisu!!! Our sheet cake was half tiramisu and mixed fruit. We paid the deposit in cash, and all we had to do was bring in the ribbon with the remaining deposit before the wedding. \n\nOn my next visit, I brought the ribbon and remaining deposit, and met with the baker, Wesley, who was the guy who would be making our cake. He spoke perfect English, so i felt more comfortable knowing that there would be no confusion on how the cake should be made. He was very nice and gave me his email to contact him for any questions. \n\nWedding day: The cake arrived on time and it was exactly how I wanted--beautiful, simple, and delicious. All of our guests loved it!! Some said it was the best tiramisu they've ever had! We even had some cake leftover, so we brought it to our family party the next day. \n\nFancy Wheat Field Bakery is the best Chinese bakery around! Their cakes are delicious and affordable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-29", "description": "If you read my two previous reviews you'll already know that I practically live off of this bakery, but it turns out that all of my really favorite items are located inside the refrigerated box near the cashier station.  Here is my latest update:\n\nCoffee Cake Slice (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/xZy6wcfJLd2nT6RHq9Dm_w/l) - The cream is typical of that from many Chinese bakeries in that it is barely sweet and almost slightly salty.  The multiple layers of cake had a subtle flavor of sweetened coffee.  The cake is quite dry.\n\nChocolate Cake Slice (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/xsVDFSueB8Vs7X3fg_0wWg/l) - One can tell by its color that it is not very chocolatey.  The cake is very similar to that of the coffee cake slice but with a faint chocolate flavor instead.  The layer of whipped cream and powdered cocoa on top definitely help the overall taste of the cake.\n\nTiramisu Cake Slice (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/n_qFtt4VrFVj78Sg20BACg/l) - One layer of each of the coffee and chocolate cakes are used with lots of whipped cream.  The whipped cream is nicely flavored and definitely helps in moistening both layers of cake.  The only thing that I wished for was a dash of liqueur but that's easy, I can do that at home.\n\nStrawberry Cake Slice (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/Trja5yLPO59eoRh2-HBPYw/l) - I like this one a lot.  It's very simple.  It's a rolled cake (like a jelly roll) with a moist, soft sponge cake, whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  Delicious!\n\nMixed Fruit Cake Slice (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/ZvB05gXLLxULcEricfuTJg/l) - I imagine their whole cakes are similar to this.   This is my favorite cake slice.  The soft sponge cake is used in this one too also with whipped cream, canned peach segments, fresh kiwi and fresh strawberries.  It is topped with more fresh fruit.  Yummy!\n\nFresh Fruit Mini Tart (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/TjBDqmibcr04dewiVTsy1Q/l) - They have these in full size tarts also.  It's a simple pie crust with a big dollop of custard cream in the center.  Canned peach slices are arranged on top along with fresh strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, a blackberry and a cantaloupe ball.  All of the fruit is held together by a thin film of sweetened clear gelatin.  Another favorite!\n\nMango Chocolate Mousse (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/C2bstQqEeUIxunsF6VldZQ/l) - It looks great but didn't taste very good.  Oddly enough they've stuck a chocolate cake slice in the middle of the whipped up mousse.  The mousse had zero mango flavor though and just tasted like sweetened, rich cream.  The chewy gelatin on top had no mango flavor either.  Nice to look at though!\n\nOrange Berry Mousse (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/OYRfWMN0mD0K7rLWwf3ujQ/l) - I liked this one much more.  The flavors on the two mousses are very distinct - one orange, one strawberry.  There's a thin layer of chewy strawberry gelatin on top.\n\nMixed Fruit Cup (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/BxbH63JSYulMwPtUXGMnDg/l) - It's another one of my favorites.  The bottom of the dessert is Asian rainbow jelly.  An assortment of mixed fruits in soft gelatin is layered on top of the jelly.  Then comes the whipped cream, a layer of the soft sponge cake and another layer of whipped cream.  Surprisingly light and very tasty!\n\nMixed Fruit and Jellies Boat (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/ySNIcCF94_9QRONX96lWpg/l) - They sell out of these often and for good reason.  Beautiful to look at and refreshing to eat.  I don't understand why they don't use the mousse in this dessert for the mango chocolate mousse.  The bottom layer of the boat is mango mousse mixed with a little gelatin.  The mango flavor is excellent.  Strawberry gelatin and a layer of rainbow jelly complete the boat layers.  Up top is a dollop of whipped cream, fresh fruits and both dark and white chocolate ornaments.  I keep going back to look for this only to be told that I have to wait because they're all gone.

There were other pastries available as well. I decided to go with a chocolate mouse cake (which ended up being about 20 something dollars). The lady at the register bundled the cake up nice and securely in a cute box. The box was tied in a cute pink bow (which made carrying the box to my car so convenient!)

This place is esteemed as a Chinese bao bakery and definitely doesn't disappoint. It has more of a modern, Hong Kong-style feel; you grab a tray and grab the types of bread you want. The bread is already pre-packaged, and I came on the occasion where they were warm and fresh out of the oven! \n\nI got a Pork Sung bao. it was soft, covered with pork sung all around the roll. Most of all, I got it when it was WARM. Nothing beats that. \n\nI also ended up getting a variety of standard baos: Char Siu bao, Hot Dog bao, etc. I had these when they were cold, but it was still good. The bread was nice and soft, easy to eat. The meat inside the Char Siu bao was VERY good. It was plentiful and didn't taste artificial. The hot dog was just a hot dog. Uh, what can I really say about it?\n\nThe prices for these baos are pretty good. They tend to be a little more expensive than average - and I consider the average to be like, 60-70 cents - but for the quality and freshness, it's great.\n\nAlso, someone told me that they noticed a lot of people working in the back (who actually make the bread). That's interesting, since there was only one person at the cash register. With that many people in the back, they could at least put another person out front.

If not, YOU MUST. Their pork sung bun is amazing!\"\nI think she felt very sorry reading my Sheng Kee Bakery's 2 star review.\nSo I went FWFB down that San Bruno Ave near by candlestick.\n\nChinese bakery is not really hit and miss kinda thing in SF because it's too many. Most of them are OK, edible, but, it's very hard to find a really good one.\n\nWhen I walked in the store, I was like, \"HolyFXXX, it's same as Sheng Kee!\"\nI was expecting an Old Chinese Chinatown like Chinese Bakery type. O.C.C.C.B type. But it's same as Sheng Kee, you know, tongs and tray, you pick it up by your self kind, I hate it because I always get too many and I felt sorry afterwards.\n\nSo, I was very disappointed, fail to fulfill the hopes or expectations.\nAt the same time, is this some kind of joke? How can I write review?\nI was seriously thinking even though I didn't get anything yet.\n\nSo, I looked around, \nI picked 1 pork sung bun, I was like, \" OK, this is the thing what Cherylynn N. was talking about, FXXX, it looks like shit, well, just once, just once, and it's only 90 cents, not a big of deal.\"\n\nThen, I saw the ham pork sung roll, I was like, \"WTF? this is the most ugly shit i've ever seen, who eats a shit like this? Oh hell.\"\n\nThen I saw the seaweed pork bun, I was totally shocked to see the label. I could not believe what I was reading. I stood up for a while, and I hear something sayin', \"Take it, Nobu, take the shit, you'll regret if you don't get the shit.\"\nI looked around, no one was there. But I really heard it.\nAfter I picked up the frecken' seaweed pork bun, I said to myself, \" Well, I think I should get something ordinary, simple, regular and I familiar with, Oh, BBq pork bun, and.... hey, red bean bun!\"\n\nSo, I got 3 totally almost illegal funky lookin' Chinese pastries and 2 regular Chinese pastries.\n5 of them, I payed $4.65, that was it.\nIt was 8 am, I parked my car right front. I was a bit hungry so I had the pork sung bun in my car. I am so glad that I was not driving. I think I might be hit something if I was driving, Yes, that good.\nThis shit is good.\nAll of them!\n\nPork Sung Bun is A BOMB, A KILLER! Dangerously addictive/heroin/crack like good! Indeed. salty sweet dried shredded pork with some kind of crunchy-ness, like a bitting sugar, I am not a big fan of cheap Chinese Super-Soft buns but this is something very special. It's very creative, smart idea who ever made the thing.\n\nHam Pork Sung Roll is second. Super ugly but Super Good.\n\nSeaweed Pork Bun is ... it sounds like WTF? but Fxxxin' Owesome! Lovein' it.\n\nBBQ Pork Bun. Good of course.\n\nRed Bean Bun. Good. Its crunchy kind. I just notice that why non-Asian-Americans don't like sweet red bean paste? There is nothing wrong with red bean to be \"sweet\".\n\nHey, Cherylynn N. without your recommendation, I would not know.\nThe Best and Fanciest Chinese Bakery in SF!\nIndeed.\n\nI just wishing the FWFB has deep fried curry bun.", "author": "Nobu K."}

Even if the business isn't terribly big, it was still impressive. Navigating around all the bodies, I grabbed a tray from the rear right of the shop and attacked the cases. Thanks to my panaderia experiences, this DIY style was familiar. I loaded up with a variety of sweet and salty buns but was still missing some pineapple buns, which will play an important part later. I jumped into line and thought it would be a quick affair.\n\nNOPE. Apparently, each transaction will take a minimum of three minutes. I'm not really sure what happened that day, but the cashiers just took their sweet time in packing up everyone's purchases and making change. Luckily, in those seven odd minutes that I was waiting, I saw the bakers put a fresh rack of pineapple buns onto the cooling trays. NICE. When I checked out, I asked the cashier for one of the pineapple buns, but she said \"No, we're out. Sorry.\" Cool. Maybe she didn't see them. I point them out to her and she turns around to tell me again, \"No, sorry. No more.\" What? Really? At this point, I've spent about ten minutes in this godforsaken place; ten minutes that I will never get back. I told myself to forget it and just leave. Funny story: as soon as I step out of the store, the pineapple buns are loaded into the self-serve racks. Great. Awesome.\n\nAs for the goods that I did purchase? Meh.

I like that it's a small neighborhood place, so none of that snooty bum-rush feel to it. \n\nThey're smart, their buns are all on display to the street. Great marketing to get you inside their doors. But really, how could you pass them up?! Their buns look amazing!! And they don't have just the standard stuff, they have their own creations, which is why I would def be returning here. \n\nThey have many variations of pork sung buns, but too bad the ham & pork sung roll one has mayo in the center! blech!! but not to worry, it's a roll, so i happily unrolled it and wiped it all off to still enjoy it. Not like most places, there's no removing the mayo. You wipe it off and there goes all your pork sung! \n\nTheir single serving mousse desserts looked so pretty and delish! Their baked cheesecake was light and airy, really reminded me of Jap cheesecake. It had the perfect balance of flavor without being too sweet and having baked it, gave it the slightest crisp of an edge. (Drooling yet?!)\n\nI wished they had a few more selection of cake flavors but all good, because the strawberry mango mousse cake I got, was a hit at the party. It wasn't too sweet and very light. Not to mention it was really pretty with the fresh fruits and decoration. \n\nIt truly distinguishes itself from all the other asian bakeries because of their own variations of buns. Otherwise, it would just be \"another asian bakery.\" Not to mention, their cake box is really nice and sturdy. It is an actual box with a lid (picture a hat box...but for cake!) which came with shoe-lace like ties, making it easy to transport and repack the leftovers. Not only that, but they included a cute bday set with plastic cake knife, forks, skinny candles and mini plates.

It was a tedious wait in a sketchy neighborhood, so I went inside to grab a cup of coffee because the outside banner looked pretty eye-catching and the place looked really clean.\n\nStepping inside, I immediately am reminded of the bakeries in HK and Guangzhou, China. They have the grab-a-tray-and-pair-'ol-tongs-and-pick-what-your- heart-desires set up, the individual cellophane wrapped pastries, the authentic wafting scent of something wonderful being baked in the back, and EVEN the bakery girl in matching apron and handkerchief headband a la Cooking Mama!

I was overwhelmed by the classic offerings that I thought I could only get every 4 years I could travel to HK. These pastries are more expensive than places like Golden Gate Bakery or ABC but definitely worth it!\n\nI ended up getting two of each: caterpillar custard loaf, taro pastries, rooster tail bun, angel cheesecake, milk cake, and a cup of coffee.\n\nSo far, I tried the caterpillar custard loaf, the filling has an amazing air-whipped texture and the bread itself was soft and has the perfect sweetness to it. Not too sweet, but not bland neither!\n\nThe taro pastries were also amazing. They were actually layered into tiny paper tin...layers! These aren't like those boxed pastries with a piece of dough with filling inside. They flake and fall apart like any pastry worth it's salt does.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-28", "description": "First of all, I just have to say: HOLY F***ING MOUTHGASM!!\n\nAlright, now that I've gotten that out of the way, I must delve into the back story illustrating the chain of events that led me to this heavenly place.  I actually live in Denver, which has an extremely minimal Asian population. Thus, the culinary experience suffers heavily.  So when my Taiwanese mom heard that I was driving my dumpy Subaru to San Francisco to hang out for a month, she didn't hesitate to email me a massive grocery list of food that she somehow expected to last the 22 hour drive back.  Her biggest priority was for me to get loaves and loaves of Chinese style white \"toast\" bread.  She's an accomplished baker of Chinese pastries herself, but has never felt that she was able to master that style of bread. I was skeptical about whether or not the bread would last in a hot car with no working air conditioning for 1,200 + miles, especially since I was planning on staying with a friend in Vegas. She insisted it would be fine as long as I threw it in a freezer whenever I had a chance. Apparently they can last pretty long in the freeze. \n\nI made a list of four of the highest rated Chinese bakeries on Yelp and visited them all the day before I left.  I grabbed loaves from every single place. As I was making my way out of town this was my absolute last stop.  I was a little skeptical of the sketchy location (forgive me if it's not actually that sketchy.. I'm a Denverite) but all my concerns were alleviated the second I walked in.  Growing up in Asia and having had my fair share of Chinese pastries, I know the good stuff when I see it. I knew I had to buy more than one loaf from this bakery.  I bought four.  I also caved and got a couple treats for myself. Every single thing I bought tasted amazing.  I hadn't had quality like this since being in Taiwan.  The cake in particular was ridiculous.  Absolutely ridiculous. I didn't even know it was possible to make cake that light and airy and still so super moist. Wow. I threw all the loaves in the freezer that night.  \n\nMy journey back to Denver began at 4am the next day, I was exhausted and about 5lbs heavier due to excess pastries. You might ask why I left so early if I was planning to spend the night in Vegas.  Well, that's because I decided to get creative and take a detour through Death Valley. Yes, Death Valley in my car that didn't have a working heater, with about ten loaves of Chinese bread in the trunk.  I made it to Vegas, stuffed the bread in my friends freezer and decided to stay and party for a few days before heading back to Colorado.  I was mildly concerned at the quality of the bread my mom was going to get by the time I got home, especially being that she's highly picky.  At that point the bread had sat in a freezer for a day, in an extremely hot car for ten hours, a freezer for another three days and then the car for over ten more hours.\n\nI waited anxiously as my mom took the first bite of the bread.  She paused for a moment, then said just one word: \"Wow\". (In Mandarin it's more like \"Waaa\" but bear with me).  She then proceeded to tell me that it was the best Chinese style toast bread she's ever had, even beating out anything she's ever had in Taipei. Together we tested out the loaves from all the different bakeries. Nothing compared, and a couple of them didn't last well during the trip. The Fancy Wheat Field Bakery loaves held up perfectly and tasted amazing.\n\nSo there you have it. Tested and proven. This place is phenomenal.  So phenomenal in fact, that I am probably not going to tell my mother the next time I'm going to be in San Francisco, because I know she's going to make me pay Fancy Wheat Field a visit...  And I know that if I ever set foot in that place again, I will probably eat their entire display case and my waistline can't take that sort of punishment. Don't judge me.  Where I live, the best quality of baked goods you can get is a doughnut at a strip mall... or if you're brave enough to drive into the dodgiest area of town you might be lucky enough to get a stale pineapple bun on your way to the pawn shop.", "author": "Lana P."}

I do understand in comparison to it's neighborhood competitor bakeries, it is much nicer in decor and cleanliness, but it's pastries are really just OK. I've had better Chinese bakeries elsewhere, like Kee Wah. \n\nThe buns were pretty decent so I did buy a hot dog bun and a cocktail bun to try, but be warn...NOT everything is. I learned it the hard way. I was really hungry when I was there, so when my mom offered me to buy me one of their Tiramisu desserts...I fell for it. OMG...it's like the WORSEST Tiramisu I've EVER eaten! Typically, Tiramisu is really light but this was super rich with buttercream! WTF?! I barely tasted any coffee flavor in it, and of course there's no surprise there wasn't any rum in it, plus there really wasn't any sign of sponge cake or ladyfingers in any of the three layers! Uh...do I even needa say more??? It was totally disastrous! THE TIRAMISU SUCKED BIG TIME!!! I really should've known better! Yuck!\n\nAnyhow, there are two things that I did like about this place despite of my bad Tiramisu experience. One is that most of it's its pastries are presented in display cases that ppl can just grab with a pair of thongs and put it onto a tray. It's totally self-serve so ppl can get whatever they desire without pressure...and it does make it more fun and totally HK-style. The other thing was that they are not cheapsakes like other Chinese bakeries, they actually provide BOXES for the pastries, not white or clear plastic grocery bags! I hate it when they put tart-like items in it and it always ends up getting smushed. So, kudos for them for not being cheap! :)\n\nIt really comes down to whether if I'll come back here again. I would if it's a convenience to me, but for their buns only though.", "author": "Winnie L."}

A great choice it was. I got the $18 cake, relatively cheap imo, and it was really good! My co-worker loved it! It wasn't super sweet or too sweet, it was just right and fluffy.  They also gave us a party pack that included forks, plates, candles, and a cake cutter. How cool is that? I don't think any other bakeries provide those extras free with purchase. Oh! We also got a free apron with our order!\n\nAs I was waiting in the bakery with my cousin, we drooled at all the yummy goodies they offered, believe me it was a lot! Thanks to Wilhelm, I get to stare at them and drool right now too on the pictures. I'm definitely hitting this place up again tomorrow to try their other goodies.

But I was conservative in trying the new things in the two times I have been there. Of the four simple things I tried, the worm shape bread is the most memorable and comforting.  It is just a bun filled with cream, which other places have and I normally would not get. But this thing is insanely good, with light cream in a cloud-fluffy bun and just the right amount of sweetness to let you to eat the whole thing without filling sick to your stomach. It almost melts in your mouth when eaten warm. And this thing has some sort of magical powers. On my first bite, I felt like I was somewhere else for a split second, and melted all my troubles away. Am I describing drugs? Well, I do recommend it to drug addicts who are trying to quit! :-)\n\nThe second thing I tried was the green onion bun with dry pork crumble. Again, not entirely original unlike the other things I haven't tried. And I like  this from other places too.  But this thing has intense flavors, with no different layering whatsoever - everything just blows up in your mouth. Salty from the dry pork crumble and green onion, savory from the mayo/cream in the middle, and light sweet from the bun. Combining with the same super fluffiness as the worm shape bun, this almost took me on a trip again.\n\nI normally would not praise so highly of baked buns, but these are definitely some of the best things I ever ate.

Besides, I have a wedding coming up in May, so I was also checking out different bakeries and looking at their wedding cakes. \n\nI got to the store and was not greeted. But that's okay. I went to the counter and asked the lady that I wanted to look at their wedding cake pictures and samples. She then handed me a photo album. I flipped through it and saw only about 5-6 different styles of wedding cakes. Not too impressive, but of the pictures that they had, they looked really pretty. I then went to the lady (at the counter) and asked for more information. I asked for the price and she did not know how much so she went to the back and asked the \"bakery chef\". She then came back out with the price of $625. I then asked how much I needed to place the order in advance. She again said she didn't know, and then proceeded to head to the back again and asked the chef. She came back out with the answer one more time. So I asked her how much deposit I need to make and by when will I have to make the deposit by. She AGAIN said she didn't know and AGAIN proceeded to the back and asked again. She again came back out with the answer. HOW RUDE! First of all, it's fine that the front counter ladies KNEW NOTHING at all, but to run back and forth just wasn't very professional. And I bet the \"bakery chef\" who had all the answers (price, deposit, and other info, etc. ) is the BOSS, or at the very least, a manager of the bakery. If that's the case, why isn't my business good enough for him/her to come out and greet me? It wasn't very nice to have a customer stand around and have a counter lady (who knew nothing!) run back THREE TIMES to get some very very basic answers. I felt unappreciated so I picked up my order and left the store. \n\nI also order a chestnut birthday cake and it is not as good as the reviews rave. They were too sweet and the cake wasn't very spongy / soft at all. So if you want rude service and overpriced cake, by all means, this is the place for you.

The fruits on the outside looked and tasted really fresh. However, the mango was a bit sour. The filling was also filled with pieces of mango instead of the standard fruit mix. I believe they used 2 types of mangoes in the cake. It would be better for them to use the Ataulfo mango for the entire cake because they tend to be sweeter, instead of just having bits of them in the filling. But I guess the Ataulfo is a bit smaller in size and they wouldn't be able to cover up the cake. Aside from the sourness, the texture of the cake is not smooth. They did not do a good job in preparing the cake mixture and you can see little holes in the cake layer. \n\nSheng kee is still the better choice for me.
