Papa's is located on the bottom 'C' floor food court, and is serving up fresh and natural cream puffs!\n\nWhen ordering your cream puff you get to choose both your shell and your filling. Shell options include the Original (puff with powdered sugar), Eclair, Green Tea Eclair, Strawberry Eclair, and Honey and Butter. These puffs are then filled with your choice of vanilla, green tea, or expresso cream. \n\nSince I was a little overwhelmed by the amount of flavor combinations, I asked the ladies at the counter what their best seller was - this was of course the Original Vanilla! The dessert was incredible with light and fluffy breading, and then cold flavorful cream on the inside.", "author": "Hayley H."}

Ahhhh I know, it's just cream, not ice-cream. If it was ice-cream, I'd probably go haywire and buy a dozen to go! Beard Papa's cream puffs has vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and green tea flavours, where you can choose the flavour of the coating and the inside cream flavour.\n\nWe tried the green tea out coating with a vanilla inside. The outside coating is fairly hard - the texture of them reminds me of the filling inside the Koala Bear snacks (not the Panda Bear one's cause those are softer).

Once you bite into the cream puff, the inside gooish cream texture oozes out, but not so much that it's drizzling all over the place! \n\nThis was an okay cream puff for such an expensive price.

You can get plain, green tea, chocolate or strawberry coating for your cream puffs and choose green tea, vanilla or chocolate ice cream on the inside.\n\nWe decided to get the green tea coated cream puff with vanilla ice cream for $3.40.

But once I had it with the dough and the vanilla ice cream on the inside, it was pretty tasty, but wasn't anything super great.\n\nI feel like there are a few reasons it isn't good. First, being in westfield mall the bar for quality of food is lower because you always know you'll get customers. Second, Beard Papa is a franchise with a well-known brand and it's known that business franchises degrade quality.

Perfect proportion of cream to shell.\n\nThe eclair donut, while Instagram worthy, is flawed by design. There just isn't enough room in the donut for the right cream to pastry ratio. Also the dough was soft (not fresh and crunchy like the shell on the regular puffs). Perhaps low turnover? Do yourself a favor and stick with the puffs.", "author": "Chris S."}

The shell was a little different than I remember though. It was crispy and a little crumbly on the edges. I prefer the shell a little more chewy, but I still enjoy the puff as a whole.\n\nGreat place to grab cream puffs. They also offer seasonal flavors, so be on the lookout.

Woohoo!\nI first tried Beard Papa over 10 years ago when vacationing in the Philippines.  My sister and I were strolling through the Glorietta Mall in Makati, and she pointed out that there was a Beard Papa in the Philippines.\n\nSeveral years, and several cream puffs and eclairs later, it turns out that Beard Papa is only a few blocks from where I work.  I walked by the stand, trying to kill a few hours, and I was tempted by the flavor of the week, Green Tea.\n\nThe prices have gone up a bit, $2.90 for a cream puff, $3.50 for an \u00e9clair.  But the green tea filling was slightly bitter (as green tea should be) but also rich, creamy, and refreshing - an absolutely perfect treat on the first day San Francisco hit 65 degrees this calendar year.  \n\nThere may have also been a dash of green tea powder along with the regular confectioner's sugar sitting atop by cream puff.  The staff at this location (Filipino guy) was exceedingly friendly.\n\nFunnily enough, the wifey calls me a few hours after I've enjoyed my cream puff, and asks me to bring her an \u00e9clair from Beard Papa.

The cream puffs have 2 layers: outer layer of crisp pie crust and inner layer of soft French choux (typical cream puff pastry). This is why a puff pastry the size of a typical donut can hold its shape. The origin of this chain is in Osaka, Japan and there are a bunch of locations all around Japan but upon inquiring the No1DP never heard of this chain. He now knows another place to take me when I visit him in Japan.\n\nAs I already ate I only had an opportunity to try one flavor. I tried their cookie crunch puff, which adds a third outer layer of crunchy cookie dough. Fillings available were vanilla or chocolate, I chose vanilla.\n\n-You can see your cream puff put together. There's a machine that inserts filling inside the cream puff. There was a small hole you can see where the insertion took place.\n-Cream puff had a slightly crunchy top yet soft bottom and for how big it was cream puff was stable.\n-Good portion of filling and cream puff.\n-Filling tasted excellent, vanilla custard done right. More dominant flavor was custard but there was quite a bit of vanilla flavor.\n\nOnly con is that there used to be a branch in SD but it closed. This will soon be a moot point because I'll be moving to the Bay Area in a couple of weeks, which means I'll have an excuse to BART to SF and try more.", "author": "Isabella B."}

I love that they don't fill the puff until you order it. \n \nWe only sampled one while we were there, and we took the rest of them home.

AND THE CREAM IS DA SH*T! OMGGG SO.GOOD. When you take a bite, the cream melts in your mouth and instantly brightens your day!! It's super creamy and doesn't have that heavy buttery feelings. It doesn't taste too sweet either, which I love. Their daily flavors are chocolate and vanilla. And they also have weekly special flavors. My fav are green tea and coffee! They also serve other pastries such as tiramisu and cheesecakes, which are also pleasing. But the cream puffs are the highlights of the shop :) Definitely a must-try!! \n\nA tip for girls: these cream puffs are surprisingly filling even though they're not very big...

I must have come at a weird time (Wednesday lunch?), because when I arrived at Beard Papa's, there was no line and I was handed a cold cream puff.\n\nAnd my reaction? \n\nVictor G., another Yelper, very wisely wrote, \"the warm cream puff was almost melt in your mouth-heavenly. wouldn't advise taking it home. taste wouldn't be the name. taste would be like chewing on paper. well, not exactly, would be like chewing on cold dough, stick in your teeth kind.\"\n\nHe was right.\n\nI was impressed by the quality of the cream -- obviously fresh, not too sweet -- but less so with the actual pastry itself. It was too airy or something. I felt like I was just eating quality custard and cardboard that just kept crumbling in my mouth! The cream puff also made a gigantic mess (try looking dignified while cream is dripping down your face and pants) and the Beard Papa guy had not adequately prepared me -- he'd handed me two napkins with my puff! And they don't offer any utensils! Lame.\n\nAll in all though, I'm willing to give this place another chance -- because it is pretty neat to have a store that just sells cream puffs and eclairs. I have a sneaking feeling that their eclairs are better than their cream puffs. I'm also willing to believe the Yelpers who say that their strawberry puffs are better than the original. While definitely a good experience, the vanilla cream puff left more to be desired. Yeah, I think that's a good summary of Beard Papa's in general.", "author": "Michelle L."}

My cousin enjoyed a cup of coffee and a strawberry mouse cheesecake while I devoured several cream puffs. The eclair and cookie crunch are my favorite cream puffs. I found that the caramel cream complimented both well but good ol' vanilla was just as tasty. \n\nOnce I bit into the cream puff it was crispy, light, and the slightly sweet cream generously oozed out. Every bite was equal with pastry and cream but of course, there was an excess of cream towards the end. No complaints about that!\n\nThe specialty cream puffs like the eclair and cookie crunch are $2.95 and the regular cream puff is $2.50.

I guess it is already represented by gluttony. We were in SF for a quick day trip for my birthday and I wanted to take some of these amazing cream puffs home. We ended up with a half dozen, two of each flavor - vanilla, chocolate and, the flavor of the day, coffee. They held up really well on the drive back to Sacramento and made a decadent before bedtime snack. \n\nWe gave one each to my mom for watching our boys and sent one home to my 98 year old grandmother. They both raved about them the next day. It was a little hard to figure out which flavor we were giving to them, so my mom asked my grandmother which one she had and she replied \"I don't know, but it was delicious!\" \n\nThe coffee and chocolate were both yummy, but I have to say that I think the classic vanilla is still my favorite. They now have a Beard Papa's closer to where I live in the Roseville Galleria, which is dangerous. I think I will just pretend it is still only a \"when in SF\" treat.

Seriously, Beard Papa's cream puff is absolutely the best dessert ever. ever. ever. They have the lightest and fluffiest choux pastry (the dough used for the cream puffs) that isn't deflated and overly soft like other cream puffs I've tried. The cream is amazing. Not just some silly foamy cream but a cool, slightly sweet, whipped custard - like really smooth pudding. Then to top it off, you can either choose a puff with powered sugar, cookie crumbles, or chocolate glaze on top your already mouth-watering masterpiece.  Their vanilla is the best and always available but I'm also a fan of the strawberry and green tea flavors when they're available, but really, all of the flavors are just magic in my mouth. Magic I tell you.\n\nAlso, their 'eclair cream puffs' taste just like a delicious authentic eclair I tasted while in Paris. Look, you don't even have to buy a plane ticket to France to try an awesome equivalent of eclairs. Maybe that will ditch the idea that the $2.25 price tag is too much for you. And for the record, I've tried the Beard Papa's in Japan where it all started and it wasn't even as good as the Beard Papa's in SF and NYC (it was too soggy). How can that be?! I don't know. It baffles me but I don't question magic and I'm glad the better Beard Papa is in this side of the world..where I am. *obsessed", "author": "Allie Y."}

Light pastry with delicious filling in various flavors.  Very generous portion size as well.  The problem at this Westfield mall location is their lack of customer service.  If you don't mind waiting in plain site while 5 workers play on their phone, then by all means - try a cream puff.  Bad customer service ruins an experience for me personally.  I gave this place a shot 3 different times because I love their cream puffs that much and each time was the same. Workers distracted, more concerned talking to each other or playing on their phones to even acknowledge their customers.  Third time is not the charm here.

I was craving something sweet, and I got a chocolate eclair with chocolate cream filling. It's kind of costly and dinky, at more than $2/eclair (it's cheaper to buy at least 6 for $11). The chocolate eclair part hit the spot. The chocolate cream wasn't impressive - I much prefer the regular cream filling. They get 3 stars because it's good, but not impressive for what you pay, and also for being a popular chain store. There's nothing particularly special to it. At least at the downtown LA location you can people watch and it's cool bc it's next to the Kodak Theatre. This one is just in a mall food court, albeit a humongous mall.", "author": "Phoebe C."}

But since it's quite nearby, read up on Yelp & had to give it a try.  After reading so many high reviews, I was starting to get a bit nervous... what if I was opening a Pandora's Box that'd result in me gaining 5 sizes?  And yet, I just couldn't resist trying!\n\nGot a standard vanilla creampuff, figuring it best to start with the basic.  The employee was very friendly, & it is sorta cool watching them put the cream in the puff.  But I wasn't blown away at all; more like a combo of disappointed (in the creampuff's meh-ness) & relieved (that I wouldn't have to take up marathon running to balance a new addiction).\n\nThe pastry shell is ok.. flaky, but kinda bland, & lacking in the tender texture inherent to really luscious fresh pastry.  The filling was cool, smooth, & creamy, & had specks of vanilla.  But it didn't have much flavor; Handi-Pak puddings from the grocery store honestly have more.  \n\nI don't get all the fuss.  If people think these are so amazing, my mom should totally open a bakery out here; she'd give Beard Papa's what-for!  ;)", "author": "Rebecca M."}

It took me sometime to find this place, but it's actually pretty accessible. Upon getting here around 5pm, there was a short line, but it moved pretty quick. I had never had cream puffs before so I was curious as to how they tasted. As for selection, there's a variety of flavors you can choose from but generally vanilla and chocolate are available, with others like coffee or green tea depending on the day of the week. \n\nI bought one of each of the ones available at the time- vanilla, chocolate and coffee, and watched as each of my cream puffs were filled up with the appropriate filling. The first time I bit into a cream puff, I felt like I was in puff pastry heaven. The outside was just the right texture- not too crunchy, but not too soggy. The filling was sweet, although a bit overbearing. I hungrily devoured the others and felt very satisfied. I ended up going back and buying half a dozen for the housemates I was staying with.\n\nNeedless to say, this was a very pleasant experience. The cream puffs are worth the money and the wait, cause this is located in a mall. The only qualm I have with them is that the cream filling can get a bit messy at times so you'll just have to use a couple of napkins just in case. This review is more for the food than location as I'm sure there are better locations around, but still, I was happy with the cream puffs here.", "author": "Justin H."}

I'll give them another month and then I'm MUNI-free again because they'll have given up on their New Years resolutions and be skipping the gym in order to drive me home, stopping for a martini on the way.\n\nSoooo... Beard Papa. Our assistant has decided that these cream puffs make the best birthday cakes, so we got more of them today. I'm usually a chocolate fan, but I like the vanilla cream puffs from here better. They're tasty. Sweet, but not too sweet. The pastry could be a bit better, but it's pretty good. \n\nBut with all these fat fuckers on diets, they're not eating what they should be eating. And so there are 4 cream puffs sitting across the floor from me, just taunting me. And Lord knows I have no self control. So I'm going to wrap this up now and go throw them in the trash can of the mens room. And try not to go back in there to fish them out.\n\nBy the way, the manager told our assistant that they are going to start DELIVERING!", "author": "Suge K."}

Goren's know it all ness and odd way of communicating to be incredibly annoying and I would always skip CI's long, convoluted plots in favor of lighter fare, like say, SVU, which is basically written by monkeys. \n\nUntil this one episode, in which Bobby has some verbal sparring with a hot FBI agent (don't you know? there is a lot of animosity between federal and local law enforcement) and I caught a glimmer in his eye and saw a completely different side.  The side of Bobby that was completely smokin' hot. You know he's the kind of guy who would drop off the face of the earth for a few months (working on a case!) but then he would call  you randomly at 8pm, ask you out to dinner at some hole in the wall Italian restaurant in Long Island and no matter what bullshit you have been telling your friends for the past six months about how much you hate him, you will drop everything and GO.  He will look at you with his twitchy eyes over bottles of red wine and veal parmesan (his favorite) and you may as well take off your clothes right there. He's got you.  \n\nI had a similar moment at Beard Papa's yesterday. I always found people' s obsession with them to be tedious and was spewing hate about how omg it was so overrated but last night, while watching Law and Order: CI, I bit into the cream puff I bought home from the mall and knew.

Doesn't that sound kinda nasty and wrong?\n\nLet's see, first time I had Beard Papa in Hong Kong 7 years ago, I suffered long lines, aching waits (it was THE hottest thing in the world at the Sogo department store), and by the time I got it, the first few bites were excellent, then towards the end I felt like I was the dirtiest man-ho on cel block E (or Britters Hilton with a different flavor of sausage every week), riddled with calorific guilt and an uneasy feeling.\n\n2nd time was the then newly opened location in Redwood City. Runny soggy cream filling and cold pre-made clam shell puffs. Powdered sugar that easily went down the wrong pipe, causing me to bark like a seal non stop.\n\nI was hoping 3rd time was a charm. And lucky for me it was. No green tea flavor, but just in time for Halloween, pumpkin flavor cream filling!\nThe vanilla was a bit ubersweet and oozy in this location but luckily not as runny as my encounter at Redwood City's. Pumpkin was nice and light, and probably the highlight.\n\nThe puff itself was a bit more enjoyable this time round, and luckily bare minimal powdered sugar, in case that fell down the wrong hole again ....oh sorry I meant pipe. This is not prison talk :-)\n\nBut Beard Papa is a bit of an oddity and seems out of place in the basement of Downtown Westfield SF. Definitely a better alternative that the watered down gelateria nearby.\n\nMy faith in Beard Papa cream puffs is slightly restored.

I told him that I will be back sometime the next week since it was Friday and I wasn't planning to go back there that day. Anyway, I forgot and didn't make it back there until a few weeks later and since it was the same guy that messed up my order, I told him about it again (since it couldn't hurt to ask) and he gave me a my correct order.

Beard Papa uses no preservatives and all natural ingredients, so it loses its freshness quick.\n\nCareful when you try one for the first time.  It's harder to kick than smoking.", "author": "Ed C."}

I have the most major sweet tooth in the world, and I can swim in dairy for days, so a cream puff is impossible for me to resist.  The most recent time I went, they had coffee flavored cream available, and my mouth was percolating when I bit into it!  The cream had a nice hint of coffee, without being overwhelming, allowing you to enjoy the taste of the pastry, and the sweetness was well tamed.  Before I could even leave the food court area, it was all gone, and I was back in line to get a couple of their classics, vanilla and chocolate, to take home.  The cream is so fresh, that taking it home turned out not to be a good idea.  These need to be consumed within a few minutes, to enjoy their full integrity.  Those of us who make fresh whipping cream know that once exposed to room temperature, the consistency starts to revert back to liquid. All evidence of a quality cream puff!  By the way, of the two classic flavors, I preferred the vanilla.  \n\nOn your next shopping trip at Westfield, grab one on the fly.  It won't leave you with that weighed down feeling that some dessert can do to you.  I think I'll head on down there for one as soon as I hit the post button on this review!", "author": "Damon Z."}

I didn't take her word for it and decided to try it for myself this evening...\n\nIf you're a fan of creme brulee, or any dessert with fresh cream for that matter, you will love Beard Papa (BP) cream puffs!  Unlike most places that serve eclairs and cream puffs, the cream puffs at BP do not have a custard base and do not taste like lard.  The pastry is very light and the cream is not uber sweet, like other bakeries.  In fact, it is perfect.  The cream puffs come in two flavors, vanilla and chocolate, and they also serve eclairs.\n\nThough the line was long, it moved rather quickly.  I had my cream puffs in tow in less than 5 minutes.  BP's puffs are slightly more expensive than what you would find at your local bakery, but it's well worth it.\n\nMy sweet tooth felt even sweeter after devouring their cream puffs.", "author": "Annalynn C."}

I didn't even have to think about which cream puff I was going to order.

A crispy and light pastry filled with creamy cool chocolate.  \n\nDelicious.

The chocolate cream puff seemed to be the hit item, the four people in front of my all ordered it, as did I.  I didn't have to wait long, which was nice as I was in a bit of a hurry to get back to the office.  \n\nThe puff pastry on the outside was room temperature, which didn't turn me off but it would have been much yummier had it been warm.  It tasted fresh and wasn't too sweet, a main complaint of mine with some of the dessert places downtown (that shall remain nameless, in this review anyway).  The chocolate cream on the inside was cool and creamy, and also not too sweet.  \n\nOverall, it was good, but not amazing.  And like some of the other reviewers, after all I'd heard I was not blown away by the deliciousness of the Beard Papa cream puff.  It will probably be a while before I go back to get another one, as the size was a bit much for me, and at $1.95 (with tax) per cream puff, they're a bit pricy in my book.  If they came out with half size (and half price) cream puffs, I'd probably come back more frequently.", "author": "Lindsay B."}

When Beard Papa first opened at the Westfield Shopping Center in SF, I was told to expect huge lines of eager pastry eaters.  So I stopped by one day and, sure enough, there was a huge line.  I am not one to stand in a line for anything unless (a) someone is handing out gobs of free money or (2) someone is handing out free Harry Winston diamonds.  OK, maybe not just two things I would stand in line for but standing in line for something to eat, unless I live in Cold War Russia, is something I just don't do. I though everyone was crazy for standing in line for cream puff -- I mean what the heck could be so good about something as basic as a cream puff, right?\n\nSomeone brought a box of the vanilla bean puffs to work one day.  I ate one and it was so delicious that if I was fired from my job that day, I would have raced over to Beard Papa and bought as many of the puffs as possible with my severance check to console myself.   \n\nI am addicted to the plain vanilla bean puff -- I haven't even tried any of the flavor of the week puffs.  The plain vanilla bean puffs are so light and so creamy and tasty.  Not too sweet, not too subtle, not too watery and not too dense -- just PERFECT.  Novices should be careful not to choke on the light dusted sugar on top, but if you're a puff-pro like me, this is never a problem.  Like a stellar black hole, this place has a gravitational pull so powerful that not even light or my taste buds can escape it.  When I succumb to its gravitational pull, I always end up buying a dozen -- 6 plain vanilla bean for me and 6 chocolate eclairs for my bff.  When I get them home (assuming I haven't consumed them on the ride home on Muni) I don't share mine and my bff doesn't share his.  My justification for such gluttony is that they are cheaper by the dozen.  We eat them all at one sitting,  My arteries are probably clogged with vanilla bean cream and cholesterol but I don't care 'cos these pastries are TO DIE FOR.  My cardiologist probably has a booming medical practice thanks to Bearded Papa junkies like me.\n\nI'm a pig when it comes to dessert.

I also like that the Bloomingdale's location is in the basement of the mall because it's more convenient.\n\nAs far as cream puffs go, I like that they are fresh but they are so big that eating them is a HUGE MESS. I guess this would be ok if you have that fetish where you like to be covered in food. I don't. The chocolate eclairs are even messier. I practically needed to take a shower after eating one of those.\n\nIn summary, good cream puffs but not good enough to crave. They're comparable to the frozen cream puffs that Trader Joe's sells.", "author": "Cindy P."}

She told me she picked it up from within the Westfield Shopping Center eatery.   To my foolishness, I had this weird thought in my head that cream puffs were supposed to be served warm with the sauce oozing out. I decided to stick the cream puff in the microwave.  That lead to a disaster because the cream puff instantly became super flat.  I managed to get the oozing filling I was looking for though!\n\nI digress.  Overtime I decided to try Beard Papa's again.  I've been to a couple different Beard Papa's locations across the Bay Area and visited this establishment this past weekend.  \n\nBeard Papa's has Vanilla Bean and Chocolate in stock all the time and tends to rotate its other flavors between Caramel, Green Tea, Pumpkin, Coffee, and Strawberry.  Flavors for 2010 in SF can be found here: http://bit.ly/9jR6Tw.  At this location I saw you have an option for what type of cream puff you want to be filled.  Amongst the selections were the normal cream puff shell, a cookie crunch puff shell, and a chocolate covered puff shell.\n\nI was in luck this week since Strawberry was the flavor on rotation.  I immediately knew I wanted Strawberry with the cookie crunch puff shell.  The cookie crunch puff shell is a little more expensive, but it is so worth it!  The Strawberry filling is also very scrumptious.  It's super smooth and has actual Strawberries bits in it. The cookie crust also gives the cream puff a good contrast in texture, similar to dutch crunch bread, but of course this falls apart a lot faster in your mouth.\n\nI didn't have to fight with much of a line since it was a little before noon on a Sunday.  The staff was helpful, friendly, and quickly completed my order.  I would come back for sure.\n\n== A MUST TRY! ==", "author": "Jason H."}

I'm not a fan of super sweet cream puffs or a thick custard filling, so these were perfect.  These go down fast and easy.  Perhaps its their airiness that makes them so easily digested.\n\nI would definitely recommend the vanilla over the chocolate, even though I LOVE chocolate.

Not smooth at all, which is not what you want in a cream puff.\n\nSo, if you haven't had one, I would recommend one.  They're delicious, not too sweet, and all natural or organic (I forget which).

I gave the place a second chance but it just was not appealing to my taste buds. I feel they were overall pretty bland and I did not find the shell tasty either. I have not been to any other cream puff place so I have nothing to compare to. If this is what cream puffs are like everywhere then cream puffs just aren't for me.", "author": "Helen L."}

I like to watch them pump the cream into the puff shell as I wait to get my order. That's how I know each one is made fresh. The packaging is cute too - a box holds a half a dozen to a dozen.

I can't help it!!!!!\n\nThe only thing I really don't like is their display of the actual creme puffs prior to being filled, things that run through my mind are: Why are they all just sitting in a bucket in one big pile? It disturbs me.  I wonder how long have they been sitting there, are they fresh? And not to mention it looks sorta cheap.", "author": "eeerleni d."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-02", "description": "So, here I am - completely unsure of how to --exactly-- pop my own Yelp cherry. You see, I'm a Yelp virgin... and though I may be inexperienced in these regions, I come prepared. I bring along with me, a protective Asian flavored Mary \"de sade\" F.  She's my yellow fever homie and I, the cream puff. \n\nNow try to imagine: this situation for a minute: (The food review I swear will happen, eventually) Mary & I met in class (A) and later found each other in another class (B) at the beginning of last semester. She walked in late (class A) and I'm sitting there staring blankly at the professor and she smiles and sits down somewhere in front of my seat. \n\nMy first impression was, \"Oh that's cool someone actually smiled at me\" and didn't give me the - \"OMG YOU WEAR BLACK YOUR THE DEVIL OMG OMG LOLZZ\" - Look. \n\nRight, so break time came along and I'm heading for the proper smoke section when I see that Mary chick again & she's already out there smoking away in the NON-designated smoking area. I ask her politely \"do you know where I can smoke?\" (even though I see her smoking right where she pleases) & she says \"Uh, somewhere over there but you can just smoke here security won't notice\" so second impression of Mary is: \"Ah, spiffy she doesn't seem like a tart\" So I light up, & we make small talk. She lends some academic advice toward my interest in science and later tells me a quick story about her trips to Africa. third impression: \"THIS bitch is whack... No I'm kidding ;-) I thought this girl probably has a lot going on under the surface than expected..\" we return to (class A.) day ends.\n\nNext day I come to (class B) late, mid-class girl with tightly pinned up doll-like hair turns around and I see it's that Mary chick again...I felt reassured as she smiled at me and said \"Oh hey you\" as we recognized each other from (class A). \n  It's always nice when you don't feel alien. So we head out to smoke during a break I believe - and conversations are had, followed by many more, and many many more.\n...Followed by both mutually agreed lame field trips, gentle hang outs and lots of going to class late from picking each other up and carpooling to school and from school while each time getting side-tracked or chatting it up, too much. Yes, that's Mary - the proverbial chatter box with late tendencies - whom still always seems to manage to get everything done right. One astute little bugger ain't she? Needless to say? a fond and, unconventional friendship was created. This was nothing unfamiliar in my personality either - both open wounds - infectiously inviting anything interesting and flowing into our lives. Fancy that. I had never met anyone so unlike & like me all at once. Mary has the ability to provoke you - in ways you'd only imagined. I am a dreamer and to me Mary's life was the dream I'd only thought of  - meeting her made my thoughts and travel hopes and goals in life seem much less sterile, and more real. \n\nYes right so. You may be asking yourself what the hell this has to do with food, aye? Well it does ! Because I'm a vegan. No I lied. I'm a vegetarian whose too addicted to cheese, wheat and butter to become a full vegan. Hey, I haven't eaten meat since I was 11 1/2 years old. I'll be twenty-two = AUG 3RD. So do the math, that's epic shit right there. \n\nNow then. It's last Wednesday Mary & I have some other lame ass field trip. We go, we fool around get the Professor all kinds of miffed at us. Then we part ways with (class A) and head to this cream puff shin-dig that Mary mentioned in passing - during the pointless field trip meandering. I hadn't had anything creamy in so long since I'm sensitive to milk (borderline lactose intolerant) - I was craving something with a milky kick. \n\nI swear I must have poked Mary and yelled the word 'Cream Puff' to her about twenty effin times on our way to the shop because I was -that- excited. By the time we get there I think she was just so annoyed with my dire NEED for this blasted cream puff she just bought me the damn thing so I'd shut the fluff up. Well it worked. My pallet hasn't experienced anything so lush in the dairy department in so long, it was like I had an mouth-gasm. \n\nOnly my reactions to said cream puff were thwarted because I had to contain my excite:  we were walking around with a dude from our class who probably would have had too much delight in my reaction to that. So, I just privately enjoyed the sweet creamy, flakey, lush puff of yum. And amazingly I didn't get a lactose reaction from it. No my intestinal lining didn't coat itself with mucus + I seemed to only want more of said puff. \n\nIt was a really warm afternoon in SF, the cream puff hit the spot... in more ways than one. Mary stuffed her chocolate flavored cream puff in my face to sample, and I was overall delighted. \n\nAs you may or may not learn. I can be long-winded, off-track, confusing, and erratic.

This time around I finally experienced the original cream puff with regular filling, chocolate filling, and the green tea filling. The puff themselves are not all too spectacular, but the filling is just heaven in your mouth. The creams (all of them) are not sickenly sweet or bland.  I found the filling to be just the right flavor at just the right consistency.  The green tea and chocolate just had enough of the chocolate and green tea flavors without it being to overpowering.  For those of you who are texture eaters will find the crunchy puffs more to your liking.

We went with a Chocolate Puff filled with Vanilla and also tried a Tiramisu Cheesecake Stick. The cream puff was not only beautifully large, it tasted great! The chocolate tasted as if it was dark or semisweet, which went perfectly with the sweet vanilla custard inside. The puff was slightly crisp with the perfect airy lightness you'd expect from a cream puff. The filling  was fresh and creamy and was the perfect custard like consistency. It had a lovely and prominent vanilla taste which nicely counteracted the richness of the chocolate. I wish I could've brought a whole dozen home, but that would be setting myself up for disaster.\nThe Tiramisu Cheesecake Stick was just that- a stick, about an inch wide and 5 inches long, of tiramisu cheesecake. The crust was dense and the cheesecake layer was nice, but it just seemed like a normal cheesecake. The top cream layer, however, was the only tiramisu part of it- it was light and creamy and had a slight espresso flavor to it. This was the best part of the stick. The top was heavily, and I mean heavily, dusted with cocoa powder which made the initial bite of the cheesecake stick really dry and unpleasant. I noticed BFF and I were shaking it off before each bite. \nHowever, Beard Papa is famous for their Cream Puffs, which is what they do best.

You'll need several napkins to eat the cream puffs cause they're oozing with cream once you bite into it. I should have tried their pumpkin flavor but maybe next holiday season. By the way, I got vanilla bean too.", "author": "Stella S."}

The line was at least 18 people long at any given time when I sat and ate lunch for an hour. Finally when the line hit 15 people I just gave up and joined it, because that was as short as it was going to get. So I look at the yummy menu and decide that I will get one of each, even tho these things are like ridiculously priced. But when I get to the register. OMG. They ran out of most of the stuff I wanted. No sign saying that they ran out. Nada! So I had to settle for a chocolate cream puff. And my friend got a vanilla one and then we split them. The vanilla one was delicious, soft pastry with smooth vanilla cream, so light and fluffy... and then I was less angry, but still annoyed that after this crazy line I couldn't get all of what I wanted. What food court place runs out of stuff when it is only 2pm!?!?!\n\nBut I do think that this is the next big thing. Crispy Kreme part deux but more expensive. Hopefully it'll fair better in long term success.", "author": "Jessica C."}

IT IS HUGE! not like those puny little costco one with frozen cream in the middle, (not that i don't like costco. their samples are awesome) it is like the size of your palm. They have eclairs, and chocolate and vanilla cream puffs, with a changing flavor. its either pumpkin, caramel, coffee, green tea, strawberry, or chestnut during the xmas time. The cheesecake sticks and molten chocolate cake thing isnt that good though. but that's only compared to the AMAZING creampuffs. They are crunchy on the outside, and they taste sooo fresh. and the filling is almost pudding like. The even dusted a little powdered sugar on top. I stuffed myself super full with like 3 cream puffs. Tidbit. bite where the pipe the filling in, or it goes flying all over the place, becoming super messy. I think the best flavors are chocolate, caramel, and grn tea, vanilla's a little too bland, and I haven't had pumpkin yet. I'm trying to time my beard papa trips now. :]\nAnother really cool thing is they pump the cream in front of you, when you order, so it is TOTALLY fresh in that sense too. Another tidbit. No preservatives in your cream puff. so it only lasts 24 hours. but seriously. you would not need 24 hours to eat the AWESOMEST FRESHEST PUDDINGEST YUMMIEST CREAM PUFF ALIVE!", "author": "Katie T."}

The pastry is always perfectly crisp on the outside and has a slight chew on the inside. It all combines into a textural triple play that will leave you perfectly satisfied. The puffs are also the perfect size to not leave you bloated if you have one after lunch. One of the few chain stores i will even consider having something dessert-y at.

The only difference between this cream puff and other ones is that they use a custard/whipped cream type filling instead of a cream type one (I bake french pastries). That's where you get the light and airy taste that everyone raves about. Though it may sound innocent and not \"waist\"-ful, trust me baby, it is. Go and ask them about their nutritional content. Go ahead, I'll wait. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nScared you straight, huh? And teh thing is, I'm not even a health nut. I love indulging myself in everything food-related, but this is just too much for me to handle. If you're looking for a sweet treat, you might as well hit up Sophie's Crepes (my hometown hero) in J-town. I mean for the amount of fat, carbs, and calories you're consuming, you might as well enjoy yourself and eat a whole crepe. Beard Papa's is good, yes, but that itty bitty cream puff can turn ME into a cream puff. In moderation folks, in moderation! \n\nFinal Verdict: Yes, these little treats may taste really good, but go and read up on the facts, like good children should!

We found one bakery but the creams puffs were covered in chocolate, and the husband doesn't eat chocolate. We were running out of time so I decided to order a couple hundred cream puffs from BP. The ordering was super easy- I literally made one phone call it was all ready to go. And they had free delivery in the financial district- perfect! They were made fresh that morning and dropped off at the City Club by 5pm that afternoon. No stress and pretty damn affordable. The guests lovvveed the cream puffs. There was a dessert spread, with the puffs as center of the dessert buffet. We rented these gorgeous silver multi-tiered trays and they looked pretty nice if I do say so myself : )  And they were so yummy- chocolate and vanilla.
