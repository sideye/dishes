If you get there early enough, you might be able to find a table, otherwise you're stuck competing for standing space close to a bar. \n\nYou get 2 tacos for $7, though this doesn't apply to any of the fish tacos which are definitely worth trying. All of the tacos are pretty large, so two is more than enough. \n\nThe carnitas and carne asada are pretty standard, and definitely benefit from going \"Nick's Way\", which adds a huge scoop of guac and melty cheese on the tortilla. My favorite taco here though is the pescado, which is a fried fish taco with mayo and slaw. The batter on the fish is crispy and not too greasy. IMO, you really don't need the extra guac or cheese for any of the fish tacos.\n\nGo on Tuesdays for a fun after work activity with friends. If you don't want to eat your tacos in a rowdy club, it's worth going another weeknight, especially if you want to try other things on the menu.", "author": "Joanna X."}

I wasn't too hungry so i just got 3 tacos and a side of beans and rice for my daughter and i. The inside looks like a large set of a haunted house. Dim and gothic chandeliers with dark red walls and black furniture.  I noticed a man coming in for a large catering order to pick,  so,  i guess they do pretty well.  My tacos  1. Steak (very dry under seasoned meat)  on a plain warmed tortilla was not great the steak was over cooked chewy and had no flavor beside cow. \n2. Grilled chicken (very dry over cooked meat) again not well seasoned just plain chicken and again a warm plain tortilla. \n3. Shredded chicken with sauce.  Finally very good , cooked perfectly seasoned good although the tortilla is just Warmed plain tortilla.  My beans and rice were fantastic. Very good beans, the flavor was perfect the cheese they use was my fav (jack) .\nI personally think they should at least grill the tortillas, not just warm them.  Add some seasoning to the meat and insure it's tender and moist (not dry and chewy)  as far as the salsas they range from mild, med, hot,  and the habanero was killer hot.  The pico was good and the chips were good.  Id come back but id order something else.", "author": "Rachel D."}

Not the grilled but the fried version, done Nick's way, is what I think about when hunger strikes. They fry one of the tortillas so it has a cup shape and the second tortilla they leave soft wrapped over the fried one and I just looooove that crunch! The two sauces on the table are not spicy at all but lends good taste and allows you to pretend like you have taste buds that withstand fiery spices. A little pricey to have a small taco ending up almost $8 (because one is definitely not enough!). Elote was good, but the corn kernel itself was oddly small; perhaps different type of corn than the ones I'm used to? Nevertheless, come. Enjoy the odd ambience of a bar that serves taco during the day. Great place for sport watching on weekends and bring cash. No credit cards.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

The service was horrible, every employee acts like they hate their lives and does not hide it. \n\n2. Only take cash but tell you this after you order, kind of inconvenient. When you have to leave, go to the atm, pay a fee and then go stand in the long freaking line again to start all over. \n\n3. Get ready, all tables are reserved on Tuesday nights; only barstools are open for seating. \n\n4. It's SO damn loud in this place on Tuesday. Like literally dark, with techno lights and super loud music. It was exactly like a nightclub at 7pm - the worst if you're actually trying to have a conversation with the people you're with.  \n\n5. My husband ordered a beer and they wouldn't let him bring it outside to our table. There were no tables inside, therefore causing him to throw it away. \n\n6. There are many mentions of the HUGE tacos at this place but don't be fooled, they are basically just full of beans and salsa, VERY LITTLE MEAT and the meat that's on there is basic. \n\nProbably won't be back.

This is literally a club blasting music with a full bar that definitely focuses on the club aspect than the food. I am not sure why they even serve food here. The club is divided into 2 portions, one side being the lavish bar, the other side being a \"restaurant\". Seat yourself and order at the counter type of place, but you cannot hear a single word the person next to you is saying. Like a club, you literally have to yell to communicate. So the atmosphere was not ideal to eat anything.\n\nThe tacos itself are nothing to write home about. Basic flavors and toppings that you can get anywhere. The nachos were decent, in terms of size and flavor. They have 2 salsas, none of which are spicy. The food just was not good, and the atmosphere was just annoying.

The restaurant side was busy, and they only take cash. There's an ATM, but there's a high fee so bring cash if you can. \n\nThere's barely any staff, which is a little off-putting. It makes getting a drink a little cumbersome. There's little to no decor and a lot of space (it doubles as a nightclub so that makes sense). During the day they have tons of tables moved on to the stage and around the dance floors. \n\nThe tacos were super overpriced for what you get, as are the margaritas. $5 for tiny glass that's 3/4 ice. I drank about three and had to cut myself off due to the cost, not the effect.\n\nThe only thing that will keep me coming back is the pico and chips. I literally crave their pico de gallo, it's so fresh and well seasoned. I wish I could find a copycat recipe! The way they serve it is nacho style, so on top of the chips. The chips are crispy enough to not get soggy under the pico, and the pico isn't too watery like some that I have had.\n\nIf this place wasn't as expensive and laid out so weird, I'd want to come back for more than chips and salsa.

Getting any taco Nick's way comes out to $6+ per taco, which is pretty ridiculous - I'm used to getting tacos for $1.25 - $3 each back in LA.  The premium paid isn't really worth it in my opinion, as these tacos weren't better than the ones I've had before.  \n\nIf you do decide to stop by for a game or for a meal though, I would definitely recommend the carne asada taco Nick's way, which was probably the tastiest thing I had there.  They also give you free chips and salsa with a Yelp check in, and the staff are really friendly + helpful!  The drinks during happy hour are pretty solid though - we came on Mojito Monday and got a pitcher for $15 pre-tax and tip, which was fantastic.  \n\nOverall, this is a great place for games (lots of TVs), the service is excellent, and the drinks are a great value, but the food is overpriced and not worth what I paid in my opinion.  I'll probably stop by for some drinks with friends again, but I would pass on the food in future visits.", "author": "Tim L."}

But don't let that sway you. We'll, unless you are like me and eating for 1, because man it's lonely in this corner. But I think I'll get back to this. Enter from Nick's on Polk, or Rouge with its corner entrance. It makes no difference.\nSo I went with the suggestion of the guy behind the counter and their 2 most popular tacos - Asada and pescado. While I wait for my food, I walk over to Rouge and order a monito, as they are the Monday special. I'm no mojito expert, but I'm sure I've had better. I was still impressed to see the bar tender crushing the mint leaves. Seems like a lot of work for a $5 drink. But it's good. And by good, I mean I'll be buzzed by the end of it. Maybe I should have closed my tab, but I'm socially obligated to order at least 1 more drink now lol. My tacos? I mean they're ok. I think getting it Nick's way certainly makes it better, but in the future, I think I'll just get a burrito and save some money. Well unless it's Taco Tuesday. Now I'm headed back to the bar to get that beer and finish my free Yelp check-in chips, whilst pretending to care about the hockey game going on in front of me lol\nI forgot to comment on the loneliness of my situation. This seems like a pretty trendy spot, as there is a party going on in one corner, and lots of after work people hanging out. Warriors vs Rockets is about to come on, so I grabbed a bar seat at just the right time. Pretty soon the bar is full, and I'm chatting it up with a local who seems to know her drink spots(chill out, she's much older than I). They seem to know her too. And her knowledge of sports is embarrassing me. I lucked out. I'm no longer the lonely vato in the corner. But I can't stay. This isn't a pleasure trip \nImabigdeal@yelp.com", "author": "Tomas A."}

I'm not a huge fan of Mexican/Tex-Mex, however, I finally ordered something to-go tonight with a friend! The menu choices can be a bit overwhelming but I settled on the Pollo Burrito and my friend ordered her usual of 2 Pescado Tacos. \n\nSo my burrito was $9.75, but the option of Burrito Con Todo (includes Sour Cream, Cheese, and Guacamole) of $1.50 was added without my knowledge. I was asked if those ingredients were \"Okay,\" so I thought they were included. I mean, it's only $1.50, but at least let me know it's extra and don't sound like everything comes with my order. If you are going to do that, please also let me know I had choice in choosing the type of tortillas, which are Whole Wheat, Spinach, or Tomatoe.   \n\nThe 2 Pescado Tacos were $11.59 plus Nick's Way (Make the tacos crispy, and with Jack Cheese and Guacamole) for $2.50. I thought it was funny that you have to add money to make the tacos crispy when the restaurant's name is \"Nick's Crispy Tacos.\" Lol\n\nAnyway, the size of this burrito was pretty big. It's not Chipotle big but was long and nicely wrapped. My OCD liked it. After taking couple bites, I thought the tiny amount of the chicken was dry, has tons of beans, and has a decent amount of rice, but where is the cheese and guacamole? I literally couldn't tell if there was cheese and I only believed there was guacamole after seeing it in my photo. \n\nSo perhaps I ordered wrong and should have followed my friend with getting the Pescado Tacos because those were pretty delicious with a ton of guacamole! \n\nI guess I was a bit disappointed with this place, if you couldn't tell. Also if you do the Add-ons, this place can get pretty expensive. Since it's also CASH ONLY, make sure you bring enough money, or use the ATM machine they have.", "author": "Alice L."}

We walked inside, got a few drinks from the bar, and then headed to the other side of the lounge to get our tacos.\n\nSince it was my first time here, I asked the cashier for suggestions. She recommended that I try one steak and one fish taco and to get them \"Nick's Way\" (which consists of making them crispy and adding guacamole and jack cheese). I ordered one fish and one steak taco and my friend ordered one steak and one fried chicken taco and the spicy Elote (Mexican corn on the cob). Chips and salsa weren't complimentary, but I was able to redeem a Yelp check in offer for a free basket of chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty good but it definitely wasn't fresh and the chips tasted like they came out of a bag. The price point here is also a little on the high side for tacos. For twos tacos alone, it costed over $10. We took our numbers and then headed back to our booth.\n\nOur food arrived and was delivered to our table. I first noticed the massive amount of guacamole that was compiled on top. Although I am a lover of guac, I felt that this was just entirely too much and it definitely overpowered the taste of everything else on the taco. To top it off, the guac tasted like it was days old. Definitely wasn't fresh to say the least. The steak was dry and tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all. I couldn't even taste the jack cheese and doubted if they even put any on the taco in the first place. My friend liked her Elote and said that her fried chicken taco was decent but nothing special.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-03-06", "description": "I feel like the proximity to Rouge has more to do with Nick's popularity than the actual quality of the food. I've been here a few times and I am pretty convinced that the main audience for Nick's is the built-in one supplied by sharing a space with a bar.\n\nFood-wise I think Nick's is a bit subpar. Their tacos are definitely not as good as other taquerias in say, the Mission, and despite claiming to use high quality sources, the food doesn't have the quality of nearby upscale Mexican spots. The crispy tacos (\"Nick's way\") are also extremely sloppy, and near impossible to eat without covering your face and hands in sour cream.\n\nI think someone also needs to mention the lines. If you try to get food here at dinner, well, good luck, because it's going to suck. First, the place is crowded, so you might not even have a seat to eat at. Given how messy the tacos are, this means you essentially can't eat them until someone moves, which takes forever. Second, the wait times are agonizing. I've spent almost 30 minutes waiting for 2 tacos here, which really sucks as there is never anywhere to sit and rarely even a place to stand.\n\nSo here's my breakdown: if you want to go to a bar, Rouge is overcrowded and full of \"Marina people\" anyway, so unless you're looking to score a pretentious frat boy you should go somewhere else anyway. Nick's serves subpar food, slowly, and you'll have no place to eat it, so you should go someplace else.\n\nSo why would you go here? You wouldn't. And shouldn't.", "author": "Sm L."}

The food prices on Amazon Restaurants are cheaper than the Nick's Crispy Tacos menu on Yelp. I am not sure why, but you do have to pay the delivery fee.\n\nMy meal came with two types of sauces (looked green and red) in their own containers. I am not sure what they were but they tasted ok and were a little spicy. The green one was spicier than the red one. \n\nMy burrito was about 8.5 inches in length and contained tons of vegetables and too many beans. When I took a bite, I found the burrito to be super crunchy probably due to the purple cabbage and red onions. The cabbage pieces and red onions were shredded but they looked to be more on the bigger side. At other burrito places I have been to, sour cream was typically free. Here, it costed 75 cents extra. I was glad I was given a decent scoop of sour cream. Lastly, the tortilla was very moist and soft. It contrasted with the crunchiness inside the burrito and was more on the plain side. \n\nOverall, this place was decent. There is a good chance I will come back.", "author": "Kristina M."}

I frequent another fish taco place in Palo Alto (Sancho's) that charge same price but yet were extremely generous with the fish.

I understand that it's SF, but their price point is not low... why not throw in free chips!!!\n\nThough, I have to mention that I checked in on yelp and got a small plate of chips for free....it should be free for everyone else though...\n\nAnyway.. it's a nice, NOT a hole in the wall mexican restaurant...there is a nice full bar and the bathrooms are super clean.

The corner booth didn't have the best center view of the tvs but it was sufficient. \n\nThere are two different servers one for the food and one of the drinks.

It did get more and more crowded as the night wore on but we were lucky because we still got to keep our booth even though we were past the 120 minutes. :) \n\nThe tacos aren't the best tacos you'll ever eat but they're decently good and when its Taco Tuesday (2 for $7) you really can't complain too much especially when the Warriors get a win.", "author": "Stephanie W."}

Well I'm gonna need to have more than one. Thankfully, I've never had a problem ordering multiple tacos before. \n\nI pretty much only like tacos crunchy, so I'll always go for tacos done Nick's Way with a crispy tortilla pan fried with jack cheese & guacamole, and wrapped in a second soft tortilla, for an extra $1.25. How you can say no to cheese & guac?\n\nThe one I like most is probably the Pescado taco - Baja style fried fish w/ salsa, lime mayo, cilantro, cabbage & onions. The large fish filet is fried to a crispy and golden brown. The guac not only adds creaminess but sort of acts as the glue that holds it all together. A little squeeze of lime to cut through some of the heaviness and that's a tasty taco. \n\nI've also tried their Elote, corn on the cob with grated cheese and chili powder. You can't go wrong with Mexican style corn, but elote is becoming a ubiquitous trend that you can find anywhere these days. \n\nI'll stick to the tacos, which are a little pricey, starting around $4-$5, but they are pretty big tacos, and they don't skimp on the filling. They're all pretty good, but pace yourself. I think most people find themselves surprisingly full after about 1.5 tacos. \n\nNow there may be a certain appeal to eating a taco in a lounge under a chandelier, but I'd rather order for delivery. Rouge feels more dingy and dated than it does dark and mysterious. Plus, the appeal of stuffing myself with fried foods in the comfort of my sweats is tough to top.", "author": "Joy W."}

Probably not the most authentic or as good as the ones in the Mission, but for the area, its a pretty solid Mexican joint.\n\nOrdered: \nElote - YUM. Do yourself a favor, and get one or two. Perfectly seasoned, and cooked. Kernels are soft and juicy and the amount of butter, cheese and spices blend perfectly in your mouth. \nFish Tacos - Delicious. Fish was fried to a crispy golden brown and the meat itself was still juicy and not overcooked. \nCarnitas - DRY. They also filled the taco with  peppers and pinto beans. Huh? Maybe I should have read the descriptions more clearly, but whole beans (really, any beans) in my meat taco is a no no. \n\nOverall, I think this place is pricey for what it is.

The SO and I came for an early dinner one day so the bar wasn't too crazy yet. But anyways, this place is cash only and serves up some awesome tacos. The most salient thing you need to know about Nick's is the Nick's Way tacos, which is basically like... a hard shell taco wrapped inside a soft shell taco with jack cheese and guac. Pretty dope. You should have at least one of your tacos Nick's Way. \n\nBasic concept here is to order at the counter, grab a number, and then try to grab a seat. Seats aren't exactly limited, but aren't that plentiful either. We found the table and booth seats pretty rare, but a ton of space at a side bar in Rouge. \n\nWe got the fish tacos, carnitas, and and pollo. Overall, the fish tacos were actually the best. The chicken was dry and unmemorable, and the carnitas weren't all that juicy and tasty either. But the fish man, the fish were delicious. Nick's Way is also great, though I personally thought that Nick's Way was a bit overwhelming for me since I'm more of a pico de gallo kind of girl. Anyways, 3 tacos split between two was actually a pretty good portion size for us since the tacos are fairly large.\n\nIf you check in on Yelp, you get free chips and salsa!

I've taken multiple out of town guests here to rave about having taco's Nick's Way - \"Any taco made crispy with jack cheese and guacamole.\" I ordered some tacos after coming home from a trip, and just asked to leave off the giant leaves of cilantro that get added to the fish related tacos. I'm indifferent to cilantro mostly, but sometimes I get tired of trying to pick giant stems out of the taco when it's thick with guacamole and salsa since it does taste a little soap-like to me in too big quantities. I asked to not include the extra cilantro leaves that garnish on the taco. This apparently confused the restaurant beyond understanding. My shrimp taco Nick's way is supposed to have \"tomatillo, cilantro, pico de gallo salsas, cilantro, cabbage & onion\" along with guacamole and jack cheese. They instead put plain sliced avocado, some unmelted jack cheese on the bottom of the soft tortilla, and plain diced tomatoes. There were no onions, no tomatillo, no guacamole, and no pico de gallo. I understand there might be some cilantro in those garnishes so maybe the intention was to remove all traces of cilantro forever but really I just didn't want the extra leaves. My BF who bought the food called back and said they didn't really do things the \"Nick's way\" the extra price calls for, and the restaurant said they'd make a new order. My BF's non Nick's way tacos he also noticed were also missing the pico de gallo, but he was willing to let it go. For the extra price of my tacos though, no guacamole and no salas was a deal breaker. When he arrived, the server at the restaurant fought what was told to him on the phone. They said we needed to bring the offending tacos back and prove they were made wrong. I found this so needlessly confrontational. I've been a regular customer for almost 10 years now and I'm questioning going back. If you're going to charge extra for guacamole and crisping the taco with melted cheese, you should actually deliver. If your customer has a request you don't understand, you can just ask or say no. I don't get trying to fight your customer over it. Avoid this place until they get their lives back on track.", "author": "Alissa L."}

Probably the best tacos I've ever had. \n\nI read about Nick's Crispy Tacos on a couple of San Francisco travel blogs and knew I had to bookmark it. My mom and I walked over here from the Fisherman's Wharf area. It was a long walk but so worth it. \n\nWe were immediately greeted by the lady behind the counter. She explained the process to us (order at the counter, take a seat with a number) and gave us her recommendations. She let us know that most people ordered the carne asada taco Nick's Way (taco made crispy and topped with guacamole). She also recommended the pescado (beer battered fried fish) taco. I of course had to get both. My mom got the pescado and the vegetariano taco.    I also got a small cup of Horchata. \n\nThe food came out super quick. We got our chips and salsa that came with the Yelp check-in immediately. The tacos were soon to follow. Literally everything we tried was amazing!!! My absolute favorite was the pescado taco. Good God the flavor!! My mom literally could not put it down. I was able to put it down because I wanted to move on the carne asada taco so that I could save the pescado for last.  \n\nMmmmmm I'm still dreaming of that meal. It was so filling and fantastic. It was also inexpensive- $23 for everything we ordered. I highly recommend!!", "author": "Elizabeth C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-29", "description": "Taco Tuesday. SOOO crowded, but for some amazingly delicious and inexpensive tacos and quesadillas. Every Tuesday evening is crazy packed inside. Most likely, you're not going to get a table unless you arrive before Happy Hour begins or if you made a reservation at least a week prior. People tend to stay in their seats for a long, long time because they are so scarce. When I went this past Tuesday, my crew and I just stood the whole time we were there. But the crowdedness is definitely the sole downside of my entire experience.\n\nYou get some pretty darn good tacos for 2 for $5. I had the veggie tacos, which were smothered in delicious guacamole and were prepared Nick's Way. I'm a little conflicted as for whether having your tacos Nick's Way is worth the money or not. I loved the addition of the cheese and guacamole, but having two layers of tortilla was a little too much for me, especially because the \"crispy\" layer wasn't especially crispy. I'm glad that the veggie taco came Nick's Way automatically so that I didn't have to pay extra and still got to try it.\n\nIn terms of the flavor, my friends and I all thought that the tacos were great. Generous portions of meats and veggies to the point that the tacos are falling apart (get your fork ready!). I also got the cheese quesadilla for $2 on Taco Tuesday, and it's weird to say, but this was one of the best quesadillas I've ever had... and all that was inside was cheese! I don't know how, but Nick's was able to add so much flavor into a quesadilla without too many ingredients. The portions are huge as well. If you love just regular cheese quesadillas, this one is to die for.\n\nDrinks are pretty cheap on Tuesdays as well. My friends and I shared a nicely-sized pitcher (served 4-5 people with one glass each) of margarita for $20.\n\nCash only for tacos unless you have the LevelUp app to pay, which I highly recommend. LevelUp is just a payments app that's very easy to use and connect a card to. I believe you save $2 on your first visit if you use LevelUp to pay!\n\nI doubt that I will come back to Nick's other than for the Taco Tuesday deals, and next time I'll definitely make a reservation far in advance so the crowd doesn't become as much of a problem as it was this last visit.", "author": "Sheila D."}

They give you a number and bring the food to you. I only ordered one pescado taco Nick's way and I'm glad I only ordered the one. It was huge! Love that they make the tortilla just a little crispy but not crispy enough that it becomes a hard shell. A little pricey - $10 for one taco and a small horchata but I was full afterwards. I also utilized the free chips and salsa (it's pico de gallo over chips) Yelp check-in offer which added to my fullness. In case you were wondering what the consistency of the horchata is like as my bf always inquires, it is quite chalky and not too creamy. \n\nFriendly service and I like the big booths along the walls.

I love crunchy tacos, so I actually ate the tortillas since they were nice and crispy.\n\n*Elote: corn on the cob with grated cheese and chili powder ($4.10)\nMy favorite dish! The corn was sweet and perfectly cooked.\n\n*Grilled fish taco: seasonal fresh fish served with tomatillo and pico de gallo salsas, cilantro, cabbage & onions in a corn tortilla ($5.15)\nThe fish got a little soggy from the trip, but nice flavors.\n\n*Camarones taco: grilled tiger prawns with tomatillo and pico de gallo salsas, cilantro, cabbage & onions in a corn tortilla ($5.15)\nThis was awful. The shrimp were rubbery and just looked old and shriveled.\n\n*Carnitas burrito: braised shredded pork rolled in a flour tortilla with pico de gallo & pinto beans ($8.85), add Guacamole (+$1.50)\nThe roommate ordered this. I thought the carnitas were okay. A little dry.\n\n*Pescado burrito: Baja style fried fish rolled in a flour tortilla with Baja salsas, cilantro, cabbage & onions ($9.60)\nThis was way better than the other burrito. The fish was nice and crunchy. Like having a huge fish taco wrapped up in a flour tortilla.\n\nIf you order through Caviar, they don't really have much of a markup. Averages about 4% more on Caviar than from what's listed on Nick's online menu. It was also great that our driver packed up sides of salsas since I love pouring salsa a whole container per taco.\n\nIf it wasn't for the awful Camarones taco, I'd give Nick's 4 stars.

I hate to say it, but the original tacos here...were not that good. *gasp*  Maybe I came on a bad day but here's a brief overview:\n\nLOCATION: This place is on Russian hill.. street parking is hard, even though there are free residential parking around, it would still be hard to find an open spot. It was also a little confusing to find this place because it is located inside a bar.\n\nFOOD:\n-Nick's Way Taco: (Basically a regular taco with a crunchy layer + guach) The crunchy layer... was soggy. Now now, I know it's expected that tacos get soggy after a while but the ones that I had at Underdog was crispy and perfect, while the ones I got here... were not. Save your money and get the regular taco *sigh*\n-Regular taco: just what you expected. Nothing extraordinary about these but nothing to complain either :)\n- Elote: Mmmm... drenched in butter goodness. It is a little pricey in comparison to the places that sell these on a cart, but still good regardless. \n- Chips and Salse: FREE with yelp check in. What gets better than free?\n-Horchata: One word to describe it? Sandy. The whole drink was thick and had the seed mash was not mixed well. \n\nSERVICE: \nMe and my friend was basically ignored by the girl waitresses the whole time, and probably because we weren't looking to order drinks from the bar.. which in my opinion is a little rude. Me and my friend had no seats and was just standing at the table eating (while ignored by the girl waitresses..haha thanks) when out of nowhere the guy worker came and grabbed us some seats.

When I arrived, they had lost our reservation and therefore screwed up the entire surprise (we went to Bullit instead). The manager emailed me, offering me a Taco Tuesday on her. \n\nI took her up on the offer a few months later for a Warriors playoff game. She was really thoughtful, placed us in a booth as so it wasn't crowded and we could bring tons of friends around. She comped the first round of beers, and told us we could take our bucket home (which they later removed from our table and we couldn't take home). They also comped the food, so all in all it was a fantastic apology for  surprise birthday party reservation gone wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, she didn't seem completely honest in her intentions. She kept telling us she was going to take care of us, give us a deal, etc in a strange way. She was very out of her way nice to us... until later in the evening. It got busy and a friend of mine tried to order at the bar. She coincidentally ended up speaking to the manager who assisted her at the bar.

I just think that there are great places to eat in every state. This place, however, was not an amazing representation of Cali food. It's exactly what 2 stars mean- it was \"meh.\" \n\nMy brothers and I visited Nick's Crispy Tacos sometime around 8-11pm on a Saturday night and when we arrived, the place seemed like it had just been the venue of a high school party. There were empty booths but dirty tables, a shiny walkway but sticky floors, several trashcans yet all of which were overflowing. But, it was in the middle of the night, perhaps reaching closing time, and I didn't think too much of it. We got to the counter and were greeted by 2 cordial women. They took our order and were happy to redeem our yelp voucher for free chips and salsa. The chips were crispy but plain and the salsa tasted watered down. But I wasn't there for the chips; I wanted to try some of the tacos that people were raving about. After around 15-18 minutes, we got our bag of tacos and went to town. My first impression of the tacos were their size. Imagine a chipotle burrito and then cut that burrito into 3-4 even pieces and comparably, thats how small the tacos were. After finishing the steak and fish tacos in 2-3 bites, I was not impressed. Sure, I tasted the fresh ingredients of a family owned restaurant and enjoyed tender steak. However, the tacos did not live up to the hype. \n\nI suppose it's only fair to say that the tacos were reasonably priced (maybe a bit expensive for a taco with the circumference of a beer coasters). But the flavors of the tacos, chips, and salsa were disenchanting. The presentation of the venue was unattractive. And if it wasn't for those two cheerful workers/cash registers, I might've given this restaurant 1 star.

A Nick's Taco will cost you $3.95 and then when you do it Nick's WAY (add Guac and beans with the Hard and soft shell) you get a meal.  One should be enough.  I hadn't eaten breakfast so I had a Carne Asada and a Pollo along with a Mexican Bottled Coke!   \n\nYour order at the register (cash only, but there is an ATM right there behind you if your eyes get too big and you order more than your wallet can handle). I was given my number and found a nice red velvet window booth.  Nick's owner, Pete, also has a club called Rouge (Red) that shares the space. It becomes more of a bar/club scene at night.\n\nWait, did I say Pete and not Nick?  Is Pete's dad's name Nick?  Nope. Uncle? Nope. Son? Nope.  Was he a fan of Nick van Exel? Nope.  Nick was the first cook until he was fired for stealing money!  Ohhhhh, then why not Pete's Crispy Taco's or at least Pedro's Crispy Tacos?  Who knows, perhaps it makes a better story this way.\n\nAnyway, my two tacos arrive in a matter of 5 minutes and I devour them in the same amount of time! Oh boy!  I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  The guac was excellent, the tortilla was crispy and not greasy.  The meat was tender!  Bueno!  Dang, the bar doesn't even look open! Should I deduct a star for that?  Nah.  \n\nIf you want a good vibe, cool food, cheap date, come here.  Yeah, it might be a while before I come back, but not because I don't like it, I just don't like the parking situation.

I wanted to try something new when a friend was in town and Nick's was high up on my list. It was good, but to be honest I think it was overrated. We ordered fish tacos and carne asada Nick's way. The fish tacos were totally lacking flavor and I wouldn't order again. The carne asada was very good and I loved that it came with beans and a big scoop of guac although I will say they blend the guac way too much so it's lacking texture. \nTo me, good Mexican food in SF should be at a dirty hole in the wall somewhere on Mission or Valencia St. I thought this place was overrated and the atmosphere didn't match the food at all which sounds weird but it mattered.", "author": "Sophie S."}

They are big for tacos, so don't over order! I ordered a carne asada one and a carnitas one. Both are good, although i don't see anything special with them. Compared to other places, they taste just \"good\" for me. \n\nI also ordered a margarita. My friends and I didn't realized there are pitchers for $20. We would've totally got that instead since they are huge.\n \nI don't think i would come back on a tuesday night especially if it is this packed every week. There is no room to sit or stand.

I have to admit that the cheese was a weird consistency, but still very tasty! It was more of a cream that was broken leading to a grainy texture.

My friend and I wandered in looking for someone to help us and it took a couple minutes before we could flag down a food runner and have her clear off a table in one of the booths for us. The inside decor is really interesting, that of a lounge, which threw us off as well. But nice to look at, anyway.\n\nUpon checking in at Nick's I received the offer via Yelp for free chips and salsa. I love me some chips and salsa and these chips were EXCELLENT! Nice and thick, house made, not overly salted. And the salsa/pico was very fresh and tasty in tandem with the two other salsas available (roasted and green) in bottles on the table.\n\nYou have to go up to the counter in the corner where the register is located to order, so I ordered the grilled fish taco and camarones,  but forgot to ask to have them crispy (which, in my opinion, should be standard since the place is called \"Nick's CRISPY Tacos\" but whatever). So I received my double tortilla tacos and they were pretty darn tasty with that green salsa. They don't skimp on the filling either so two tacos, plus the chips, left me pretty full. My friend ordered the same but \"Nick's style\" which includes guacamole and sour cream, for I believe an extra $1.50. The crispy shell was actually covered by the outer soft tortilla, interesting. Reminded me of a double decker taco from Taco Bell, but way more tasty-looking.\n\nWe were lucky to get a table in the early evening on Sunday but I have heard there are lines out the door, so I guess its best to go at non-peak times if you're tummy is grumbling!", "author": "Malika H."}

But then again, I feel like I have high expectations for tacos. We came in for taco Tuesday and got the 2 for $6 tacos. Still a little pricey for a taco Tuesday I think, considering you can get some pretty darn good tacos for ~2. The tacos were pretty big in proportions so I guess that makes up for the price. We also got a pitcher of margarita and it was very sweet, didn't really like it all too much.  \n\nThe atmosphere was a bit loud, there was a lot of people, but makes sense since beer was like 2 for $7 and it was taco Tuesday.

Don't let this scare you. On average, people looked to be in their mid-twenties.\n\nThe music was loud and the DJ had a great assortment of techno/hip hop songs. Don't come in here thinking you can a deep conversation with a friend. You'll be shouting to hear each other (which comes easy when you're three drinks in).\n\nThe place was packed yet our order got to us in less than 5 minutes.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe tacos are...OK.

I was surprised to see it attached to a lounge - kind of cool for an evening thing but also kind of odd at 3 PM. Never thought I'd be eating tacos in a very red room surrounded by so many bros. \n\nAnyways, on to the tacos! I got 2 vegetarian tacos and shared the jalape\u00f1o poppers. The food came out pretty quickly. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of guacamole they add. Definitely a major bonus point! I also was surprised at the crispy taco shell within the taco but I guess it is called Nicks CRISPY Taco. Added a nice crunch to the overall taco. 2 was very filling even though they appear small. They stuff it with beans, cabbage, onion, cheese, and guacamole. The jalape\u00f1o poppers were okay, nothing too special. I would recommend against them and instead trying another taco if you're hungry. \n\nDidn't try any of the drinks but there appears to be a lot of specials so wouldn't mind coming back to check those out.

A nice beer selection and tasty tacos, in addition to half a dozen large, wide-screen TVs throughout the bar, Nick's Crispy Tacos always delivers for loyal Giants and 49ers fans that are in search for good eats and a fun, lively venue to catch the game.\n\nNotwithstanding the myriad of excellent taquer\u00edas I used to eat at in the Mission District, whenever I am now in town for a visit, I am craving the huge, tasty tacos here at Nick's.\n\nNick's Tacos are all jumbo sized tacos and packed with juicy, flavorful meats that are seasoned just right and pinto beans that are cooked to near perfection on either a crispy corn shell or two layers of warm, moist flour tortilla, topped with pico de gallo and shredded cheese. Two tacos are substantial enough to satisfy the heartiest of appetites.\n\nI would recommend the two choices I tried: Carne Asada - grilled steak in corn tortilla with pico de gallo & pinto beans, $3.25 and Pollo - seasoned, simmered chicken in corn tortilla with pico de gallo & pinto beans, $3.25. \n\nThe steak is not overly seasoned and grilled perfectly, juicy and oozing with flavor. The simmered chicken is very moist and infused with the zesty broth and ingredients the meat has been cooking in. I suggest trying either one served up 'Nick's Way,' with jack cheese and smothered with their creamy guacamole for an extra $0.95. Simple, no-frills preparation but still delicious. I am hard-pressed to try anything else here.\n\nA cool sports bar with a lively crowd and tasty, humongous tacos that really rock! A great place to catch a Giants or Niners game!\n\nNOTE: located in Nob Hill on 1500 Broadway, finding a nearby parking spot can be quite a challenge.

Bless you Nick's -- for your pescado taco and loveable staff! \n\nAlso, ask to sample the fresh fruit juices. Then buy some! Awwww yes.", "author": "tee v."}

If you're looking to dine on below average bar food and spotty service, this is your spot. \nI had a take out order consisting of elote, black bean and grilled corn salad, shredded chicken burrito, chips and salsa, and horchata. The horchata was absolutely disgusting. Chalky, gritty, and tasted like watered down mush. My boyfriend took two bites of his chicken burrito and said it tasted like nothing and wasn't interested in finishing it. My \"taco salad\" was horrendous, full of the ends of every vegetable and strips of stale chips - didn't bother to finish that either. The elote was dripping in mayo.. Which I think is nasty..

Crunchy tacos are one of my favorite foods but this place does NOT serve hard shell tacos.  Instead Nick's Way is burning an inner tortilla, attempting to \"crisp\" it up enough to be crunchy, then wrap a regular soft tortilla on the outside.  The result is a soggy chewy double tortilla with burnt edges.  My jaw started aching after half of the pollo asado Nick's Way taco.  I tried two bites of my camarones taco, also Nick's Way, before switching to a spoon to scoop out the content.  I only had two shrimps in my second taco which is BS for $5.25 each taco.\n\nAnd Cash Only in 2016?  Automatic negative star.  This place gets 3/5 for lackluster \"crispy\" tacos and not taking plastic but I really want to leave 2.5/5 stars because this place was more meh than neutral.", "author": "Kirstin K."}

I kept saying to my friend, \"wow\" and \"OMG.\"  I mean, these were just tacos, right? But they ended up being the BEST tacos I have ever had.  They are wrapped cone-style, which allows them to really pack in the ingredients and make them so big.

First off, I did not look at yelp before coming here so for some reason, I imagined a more authentic Mexican Restaurant when my friend said, \"Let's grab some tacos at Nick's...\" This place was not that LOL This place looked like a fancy bar but with college kids running around ahaha when I walked in all 21 to 28 year olds grabbing tacos and booze, music clamoring loudly, and sports playing on T.V. Not really a place you'd expect good tacos.\n\nThis place gets packed real quick on a Tuesday. The red comfortable seats that you see in the pictures...  Well make sure to make a reservation if you want to sit on those. Each booth were reserved by the hour. So there is a reservation at 6 then another at 7 then another at 8 and so on, you get the point. No reservation?

Small sample size, I know. But if you live in the area and don't want to travel far (the Mission), it's one of the better ones.\n\nHowever, the problems with this place are twofold.  First of all, the attached bar/lounge/douche museum is always obnoxiously packed.  On any given night, especially if there's a game worth watching, there's a line out front like it's the hottest nightclub in town.  From the (relative) comfort of Shanghai Kelly's, I witnessed people missing the entirety of Warriors-Cavs Game 6 because they refused to give up on the line for this place.  The clientele are not sane/logical people. So yeah, dining in is not ideal.\n\nSecond, and most infuriatingly, I have ordered delivery from this place maybe 4 times and last night, for the second time, I was called after 45 minutes or more and was told that the restaurant had just decided to cancel my order with absolutely no explanation, whatsoever. Just \"The restaurant has cancelled the order and you'll get refunded in 5 business days.\"  Imagine being at a restaurant, paying for your food, waiting 45+ minutes, then have them say \"Nah, nevermind, you don't get any food, go somewhere else. Your money? I mean... we'll refund you in a few days.\"  That's essentially the experience I've had 50% of the times that I've ordered delivery from this place.\n\nIn summary: Dining in = Bad.

But the tacos are tasty, popular, and certainly one of the top choices in the hood for a fun and simple meal.\n\nFish tacos are all the rage in southern California and it's fitting a couple of decent versions can be had here. The pescado tacos are San Diego worthy Baja style pescado fritos, doused in lime mayo and garnished with cabbage and cilantro, which are mighty tasty. The fish can be grilled as well, typically served with tomatillo and pico de gallo and is my favorite of the two. Though most of the tacos are served in corn tortillas, one has the option to get some Taco Bell nostalgia and go 'dorado with crispy shells and all.\n\nIn terms of taco meats, I can vouch for their carnitas, pollo asado, and dare I say the camerones, aka shrimp. Everything is seasoned well and served in abundance enough not to feel jipped. For the non-taco variety, beware of the jalapeno \"poppers\" which have been known to light up tastebuds on occasion. I love the Elote, or buttered up / cheesed up corn on the cob, even if it's $3 each.\n\nAnd that's the one thing that keeps Nick's from achieving immortal taco greatness are those prices. While it's *relatively* affordable, but feels pricey for taco land. Every taco is $3+ and even an extra side of cheese + guacamole is an extra $2+. This wouldn't be a big deal if they took credit cards, but alas they are cash only.\n\nLastly, I miss Miss Bubbles. Gracias for the taco memories and then some.", "author": "Jando S."}

As I ordered I asked the service staff if the bar was open and they said absolutely. The Bartenders however  (Tuesday, sept 20 4:28 pm) told me when I politely asked if I could order a few beers and a pitcher barked at me and pointed at her watch \"we ARENT OPEN FOR ANOTHER 2 minutes\" like oh sorry excuse me let me go kindly f*** myself, so sorry for inquiring (while I am one of maybe 4 patrons in the whole establishment) to bother you 2 minutes early for a beer\nManager (or who I assume was the manager by his button up) then came to our table and told us we had to move because the table was reserved at 6:30 which I considered odd as that was 2 hours away. We ended up being there until about 6 pm and watched maybe 2 or 3 different parties sit at the same table we were kicked from and eat their meals. \n+forgot to add that I worked in the bar industry for years and always have a high tolerance (bc I get it) but this was another story", "author": "Sabina T."}

I don't mind paying for good food, but it's pretty expensive for tacos.\n\nI sit down and begin to feast. These are not normal sized tacos, and for how much they were they should be big. There is a soft shell with cheese inside and then another crispy shell with all the works on the inside of that. Lots going on in here.

I didn't enjoy it at all. \n\nIn the end I think I would have given this place and experience two stars due to the venue, price and quality of food.

A swanky club? A lounge? Sports bar? Chandelier outlet?!? We all are dying to know.\n\nThe plus side about nicks is their drinks, food and phenomenal service during brunch/dinner hours. (I can't speak for the club/lounge part as I haven't partied there since MAYBE 2008?)\nThe first time I have come here as of late, I met with some friends for a few beers around 9pm. We were shocked to see open booths, huge TVs and a nice interior. \nWe took a seat and a waitress came over to take our order. Everything was A-OK... until we saw the happy hour menu:\n\nWed. & Thu. 5-10pm; Fri. 2-2am. Yes, literally all night.\nWell drinks/cocktails: $3\nBud and Bud light bottles: $3\nMargaritas: $3\nMargarita Pitchers: $18\nPints of draft beer: $4\nPitchers of beers: $10\n\nWUT?\n\nImmediately I knew we hit jackpot because a) this is polk street on a Friday and b) these are damn good specials. \nThere is a separate area for ordering food that can be brought over to the lounge area. My friends ordered 3 burritos, nachos and some tacos and devoured them as if there was a shortage of Mexican food in the US.\nOur waitress was really on top of her game: attentive, nice and ensured our drinks stayed filled along with our bellies.\n\nFast forward to this past Sunday: we hit polk street to watch the saints and niners game. We pop into bullitt to catch the first saints game. The bartender regretfully tells us that all screens are occupied and they weren't playing the game; bummer. We check out greens sports bar; too packed and too grimy. As a last ditch effort  to give polk a solid chance, we trek over to find good ol nicks. Ample standing room, a few places at the bar and EVERY GAME PLAYING INCLUDING OUR SAINTS. In that moment, the GF was happy... which makes me happy.\n\nThe deal of the day was brunch, but since we had already eaten we \"settled\" for bottomless mimosas ($10 with food order, $15 without); beyond reasonable. \nThe crowd slowly built as time grew nearer to the niners game. This is your typical polk crowd amped up on mimosas and jager bombs... which was fine seeing as there were no colts fans.\nOur server kept our carafes filled and was one of the friendliest bartenders we have had the pleasure of working with.\n\nBefore you know it, we had new friends (#allnewfriends) and a booth to share while watching the game. Although busy for a game day/brunch, there was plenty of standing room and wasn't uncomfortably packed like others on the block. \n\nConclusion: don't be fooled by the reputation or the identity crisis; nicks is your solid go-to for a drink, a game or some damn good food.\n\nTips: I am not sure what the rule on animals are, but we saw a few dogs in the bar area. Which is great for us as the girlfriend and I hate leaving our pup in his crate.\nAlso, they're \"known\" for their taco Tuesdays; same specials as above except 2 Dos XX for $6, 2 corona for $6 and I do believe they have taco specials (aka nicks way from underdogs... amazing)\nThey also have Monday night football specials as well. This wouldn't be my go-to for games, but this past Sunday has swayed my opinion.\n\nNicks/rougeSF/chandelier expo, you wow'd the girlfriend and I and I am a fan. A true fan.", "author": "Ryan L."}

So far, it's been disappointment after disappointment.  And needing to recover after watching the epic fail that was the NFC Championship game, my friends and I stopped by here...mainly because I kept demanding we get Mexican food for the better part of 30 minutes.\n\nThe tacos were good, but not really worth the hefty cost.  A carne asada taco and a pescado taco, both done Nick's Way (which quite frankly should be standard and not optional) ran me $13.  Nothing particularly special about either taco aside from replacing a regular tortilla with a fried tortilla.  For all the hype of the reviews, I really expected more.  Especially considering how much it was.\n\nAdditionally, some of the other stuff just frustrated the hell out me.  You're churning out tacos at an insane rate, but cash only?  I can understand it if we're dealing with a hole in the wall place, but this is prime City territory on Broadway!  The sheer amount of customer volume should be enough to justify covering the CC fees.  Service was also virtually nonexistent.  And seriously, one register that's CASH ONLY even though you have a long ass line of people waiting to order?  Don't even get me started on the disaster of trying to find an open seat in here during peak times.\n\nIf it were simply a matter of the food being overpriced, i would probably just deal with it.

Since I do like the beef, I was expecting a lot from the carne asada, however it was the grilled fish that opened up my eyes to the joy of seafood tacos. The carne asada was a little tough, but was still good. But the grilled fish mixed with the sauce that they provide was superb. Great choice. I also got the free chips and salsa courtesy of the yelp check-in, which, combined with the two tacos filled me up quite nicely.\n\nOverall, a little bit on the expensive side for tacos, but you should definitely try the tacos, and it seems like a cool place to chill also because of the environment indoors.", "author": "Brandon Y."}

My boyfriend and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to join us. We are from out of town so we were unaware that they have happy hour specials on Thursday night (we are from Boston where happy hour drink discounts are illegal). We ordered 2 margaritas from the menu. The summer cucumber one was my favorite as it was not overwhelmingly tequila tasting. I was really disappointed to find out that for a cheaper price that two margaritas, we could have bought a pitcher. The bartender failed to even mention this to us when we ordered. I thought that was poor service. \n\nThat said, the tacos were phenomenal. You have to order at the bar in the back of the place and then sit with your number. The waitress will not serve your table outside of filling your drinks and delivering your food after ordering at the bar. They are much larger than I'm used to in Boston, so 2 of them were plenty. I chose the carnitas and fish tacos. The fish one was a little dry but tasty, and the carnitas was juicy with a little spice. \n\nThe atmosphere was hilarious. Restaurant by day, club by night characterized by the cheesey crystal chandeliers and red velvet half moon booths.

We stuck with the name sake and ordered a slew of Nick's style tacos; pescado, cammorones, carne asada and fried chicken. The tacos were delish although on one of mine the inner fried tortilla was a bit over done and hard to chew. My husband LOVED the friend chicken and my fav was the fried fish. Our kids went with the carnitas taco Nick's way, bean and cheese burrito (2 for $5 Friday special) and a carne asada burrito con todo which was all amazeballs. Our son tried the horchata which was heavy on the cinnamon but tasty and my husband and I ordered vodka soda and crown on the rocks both of which tasted very watered down which is what lost them a star. \n\nPlease take note that it is cash only and you order drinks at the bar and food at the counter.

These tacos cause such resolution of conflict between crispy and soft that any bipartisan bilateral biplane committee will fly their pants off to unilateral agreement that these tacos are, in fact, unable to be classified as crispy or soft, and yet are both.

Nick's does such a nice job with the cabbage that I did not feel the urge to pick out the normally bitter red cabbage. The only drawback is that the taco gets messy.

I'm all about textures when I'm eating food, so this was a big issue for me.\n\nOther than the tortilla, I had no issues with the contents of the taco. The steak wasn't overly salty, and the guacamole was very smooth and creamy. Each of the tables had bottles of red salsa and a salsa verde, which had a slight spice to it. The tacos were tasty on their own without the sauces, but if you want your tacos to have a kick to it, add the salsas. \n\nThe strawberry agua fresca was very refreshing. I could actually taste real strawberry as opposed to strawberry syrup. The horchata, which is one of my favorite drinks, was actually rather disappointing. I kept hyping it up to my brother, but this was not the best I've had. It was overly sweet and felt like it coated my mouth because it was thicker than I was used to.\n\nUnfortunately, they messed up my brother's order and gave him a pescado taco instead of the pollo asado taco. He ended up just eating it anyway instead of sending it back, but that was a setback on the experience. \n\nTwo tacos would definitely be enough for a meal, so it would be a very affordable option if you're looking to dine on a budget.", "author": "Erica L."}

Nick's Crispy Tacos could only be compared to a lying, cheating, stealing, scum-bag politician that lies through his teeth for your vote. And then when he gets your vote, takes a proverbial diarrhea (which i had multiple times after this meal) right on your fucking head.\n\nI was lured in here by a promotional offer that promised free margaritas with a $10 purchase. Not only was that a blatant lie, I had to purchase both 10$ an additional margarita to receive the free margarita offer. \n\nI didn't come here planning on getting wasted, however, I believe that this bait and switch was intentional so that you would get wasted enough to at least temporarily tolerate that which could only be described as sub-standard human waste; not real food.\n\nI ordered a fish taco which tasted like purely of mercury (I am currently consulting with a physician to preemptively combat the symptoms of mercury poisoning). The salsa that this fish taco was drowned in was clearly from sub-par tomatoes, over-ripe and extremely wet, causing the crispiness of the fried fish to disappear, turning it into a soggy, mercury-ridden piece of white fish. A sorry excuse for a fish taco in my opinion.\n\nThe margarita (the one i paid for) was basically all tequila. Again, i believe they try to get you drunk so that their \"food\" will be more tolerable. And the second margarita (the \"free\" offering) was devoid of all alcohol. \n\nA word you hear a lot in the GOOD restaurant business is \"consistency\" to which Nick's Crispy Tacos exhibited none, and made my dining out experience more like a nightmare from a Freddy Crougar film directed by Wes Craven. \n\nMy experience here was in a word; terrifying. Terrifying for my personal health seeing as I may have ingested unhealthy portions of Mercury. Terrifying in terms of the service (non-existant, devoid of manners), decor (cheesy Mexican murals lined the walls of this try-hard establishment) , and atmosphere (terrifying in terms of the amount of tattoos and 2 year college degrees that each patron had). \n\nBut most of all this experience was terrifying because it was crowded. This was terrifying because it really makes me question the sophistication, taste, and overall merit of San Francisco, a city that I have lived in and loved for almost a decade. \n\nMay God have mercy on this restaurant and everyone who enjoys it souls.\n\nThanks,\n\nMichael Stern", "author": "Michael S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-23", "description": "I've been a patron of Nick's for a number of years.  It started as a fledgling taco operation during 'off' times for the Rouge nightclub on Polk & Broadway, and it has blossomed into a bubbling and busy Taco spot which sometimes gets so extremely packed it can be frustrating.  This place is just a few blocks away from me, and I have tried a large percentage of the items over the years- and their food is great overall. But there are a few 'must haves' which I almost always find myself ordering these days.\n\nI love their 'Pescado' burritos- they make Fried or Grilled fish, stuffed with chopped cabbage, onions, cilantro, a tangy mildly spicy sauce, and you can add rice, guac, or other items.  I usually order the fried version (adds a nice crunch!) and I  believe they use either Mahi Mahi or Snapper. To me, this is the top item on the menu and distinguishes their otherwise good menu from the selections at most taco & burrito joints.  Also, I am a big fan of their spicy gooey cheesy 'elote' corn- I find this item delicious as well.m  My wife swears by the carnitas quesadilla....\n\nA few quick pointers- Nick's does take out, and sometimes when I go and the line is super long, rather than wait in line, sometimes I call and place a take-out order instead.  And sometimes they don't answer their phone.  When I do have takeout- catch someone's attention behind the counter and you can usually grab your takeout without enduring the line just to pay.  Remember Nick's only takes cash!\n\nNick's started off being 'the only' option for Mexican in the general area, and it got my business for that reason. However, I can solidly call their fish burritos a 'selection of choice' which draws me there from time to time over their competitors that I patronize from time to time, and NOT just because it is close to my home.  Please give it a try and I hope you enjoy!", "author": "Andy S."}

The tacos themselves are delicious.  These tacos are definitely filling, and you certainly get your money's worth out of them.  I had two carne asada tacos, both done Nick's way, which means it gets loaded with cheese, guacamole, and sour cream - SO WORTH IT.  These tacos do require that you wait in a line that has potential to be 30 minutes long, and will also require you to run to an ATM for cash if you don't have any.  The crispy part of this is what gets me pumped, and the amount of meat you get is definitely generous. I'll be back to hang out here hopefully some time in the near future!", "author": "Lisa I."}

Unfortunately, the experience didn't live up to the anticipation.\n\nTucked into a corner of Rouge, Nick's seemed to be more of a destination than the main attraction; maybe it was because it was relatively early on a Monday evening, but Nick's had a steady stream of people keeping the line at least four deep.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the shrimp taco (regular), the veggie taco (crispy) and one of Nick's margaritas. I found it strange that Nick's way isn't the default way tacos are served; meaning most are soft, not crispy by default. The guy who rang me up was nice, but I wish he liked fish and could've steered me toward what I believe may have been better choices.\n\nOn paper my shrimp taco was a winner; to taste it was fine, but pretty unremarkable. The veggie taco was a waste of my time, bland and boring I've had much better veggie tacos. I'm also not sure I love my tacos Nick's way where a soft tortilla covers the crispy one holding all of the ingredients; the overall result is a sort of crispy taco. The highlight of my meal - and one thing that didn't feel oversold - was the margarita. I was glad I opted for it and bummed at the idea of braving the line for another.\n\nThis place is a solid 3 stars; maybe I'm spoiled by the tacos back home because while decent, it's not a destination in my book.\n\nTIP: You can get drinks at Rouge and take advantage of their specials.\n\n* Cash or Level Up only", "author": "Mary T."}

From 5 pm till late, they have a variety of good options for $2: cheese quesadillas, chips + guac & salsa, and tacos. The tacos are made with corn tortillas, and are packed full of veggies, beans, and meat (I'm vegetarian, but there are several different meat options that I don't remember). You can get your tacos Nick's way for $1 more, which means they come with guac and jack cheese, plus the tortilla is crispy. The veggie tacos generally come with guac and cheese anyway, but others tell me its a good value.\n\nWhile baseball season was going on, the place was always PACKED on Tuesdays starting around 6 pm - you had to get there before, or you'd have to wait 30-40 minutes for food. But now its a lot more relaxed, it's still hard to find a seat after 6 but you can definitely get your food relatively quickly.\n\nBesides Tuesday nights, this place isn't really worth the price - everything is about twice as expensive, and paying $4 for a veggie taco seems a bit unnecessary.\n\nAlso - Taco Tuesdays deals are only good for eating in.", "author": "Amaresh S."}

It's literally inside Rouge, I even got to sit at one of the velvet tables more known for bottle service when it turns into a club at night time.\n\nI wasn't sure how big are the tacos, so I decided to order 3 of them. Once I got my order, I immediately regret getting that many tacos because they were prepared very generously. I got fish taco and 2 of the shrimps - all made Nick's Way. The tacos tasted amazing! I was glad I got it made Nick's way because that guacamole on top of each taco just seem to hit the right spot.

Instead, it's been slowly building over the course of several years. You see, I pass this spot every day for one reason or another. It says Mexican food. It serves \"Mexican\" fast food (tacos, burritos, elote, etc.), but there's nothing about it that implies any Mexican influence. In fact, for whatever reasons, I hear the words \"SO WHITE\" screaming in my head every time I pass. It's an unfair basis for a review, but it somehow has gotten under my skin over the years.\n\nMaybe it's the polar word-of-mouth reviews I hear almost every time I walk by. Love it or hate it, it just feels improper to me. It's a nightclub that serves Mexican food. Sounds like a great idea, and kudos to them for that. I've stopped a couple of times and left unimpressed, nothing good or bad enough to warrant the comments I hear from someone EVERY SINGLE TIME I walk past. In fact, as I type this, I hear a group of four (stereotypically white) people walking past. One of them suggested Nick's, and another said, \"You want to go here for a taco? What are you doing?!\" And you know what? They just went inside anyway.\n\nI think that's it. I have nothing against the place. I just don't understand the people that hate it and go in anyway. It's like a Bermuda Triangle of opinion on Polk Street. It defies all logic and still thrives. Go there if you hate it.\n\nOh, they have huge screens for sports. Go team.", "author": "Nick W."}

Imagine a wannabe-fancy steakhouse with big gaudy chandeliers, bright red wallpaper, and pleather booths. Then imagine that place serving tacos in plastic baskets to long lines of rowdy late-night grubbers, taking a number and chilling with a stiff margarita. \n\nTrippy, right? Yeah, endearingly so. \n\nAfter hanging at a trunk show with my fabulous designer pal, we decided to check out Nick's for a quick bite and some serious girl talk. This was the perfect spot. The line was pretty crazy at 8pm, but in about 20 minutes we made it to the front and were thoroughly charmed by our Latino order-taker. We went with some fish, chicken, and prawn tacos \"Nick's style\" (w/ avocado and an awkward slice of jack cheese. Sliced, not shredded. Weird.) Tacos range from about $3-5, which is totally worth the setting you get to consume them in.\n\nMr. Charmer talked us into getting the \"real\" margaritas from him, vs. the weaker ones they serve at the bar in the main dining room (apparently they are separate businesses? There are lots of confusing quirks about this place). Oooooh, he did us well. The margaritas came up fast: simple and strong, with a salty rim. The tacos, of course, would require more waiting...\n\nWe took our number and plopped into one of the plastic-y red booths admiring the abandoned steakhouse atmosphere, and the lively cantina energy that now defined the place. The tacos arrived and between two of us, 3 was plenty. There are squeeze tubes of sauces, but we didn't mess with those. Nick's style was fancy enough for us. \n\nSo yeah...if you like tacos and margaritas and the color red, you really gotta see this place! Viva la Nick's (or something gringa-esque like that).", "author": "Nique F."}

I couldn't pass up the deal, especially with the great reviews. However, I'm going against the majority by saying I don't see the big deal. \n\n1) Parking is a bitch. I headed over to Nick's from the Mission District and parking took about 15-20 minutes to find. I'm a patient person, but it was getting frustrating not being able to find a spot in the area.\n\n2) Douchebag central. Granted, it was 5p.m. on a Sunday and it was a madhouse. I hate when I forget there's a football game. I would avoided the bar/lounge/taco house had I known a game was going on.\n\nI was a little confused on the ordering process as there's no sign or hostess to point you in a direction. A bar area with a counter and a menu on the wall is located immediately to the right.  The menu includes a few starters, such as nachos, chips and salsa, jalapeno poppers, etc.  As for the main entrees, you have a variety of tacos, both regular or Nick's Way, burritos, quesadillas, and a kid's menu.\n\nI ordered two carne asada tacos, one regular and one Nick's Way, which is served crispy with Jack cheese and lots of guacamole. Additionally, I ordered a pollo taco and my +1 ordered the chicken nachos.  The total came to $26 with all said items and two soft drinks.  The voucher redemption was simple and painless.  We received our order number and sat ourselves.  Fortunately, the game was over and we found a booth.\n\nThe food came out and my tacos looked great, but the nachos looked less than appetizing in my opinion. The chicken taco was okay, far from special and pretty bland all around.  Tacos are served with two tortillas, which is a bit of overkill as they are pretty thick.  Up next was the carne asada taco, Nick's Way, which was a little better due to the guac.  The melted Jack was a bit much for me and there's was nothing \"crispy\" about it. I stomached the third taco out of sheer hunger, but was pretty disappointed. The nachos were okay, but far from memorable and felt like movie theater nachos.\n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed. Did I order the right item? Am I bias because I'm Mexican? Am I spoiled by home cooked Mexican and real SF/East Bay taquerias?

Unlike the tiny tacos which are ubiquitous in California, Nick's Crispy Tacos can be a full meal by themselves.  I got the fish tacos and the fish filets are thick enough so that you can REALLY enjoy how crunchy the outside is while still having a very juicy interior.  The warm flour tortilla on the outside serves as protection when you crunch into it and the inside crunchy shell breaks apart. And OOHHH YESSSS when you get it Nick's way they load it so full of guac it's oozing everywhere whenever you take a bite.  I'm salivating right now and kicking myself for living so far away from this place.  \n\nThe ambiance at this place is hilarious. It looks like what may have been an old dance/strip club that is converted to a taco restaurant. When you walk in, there is very clearly a place to collect 'cover charge' and all nice private eating booths along the wall are obviously 'VIP areas'.  There is an old 'DJ booth' next to where you get the water and I'm sure the ordering counter where you get your tacos used to be a bar.  I like to fantasize that each chandelier is covering the spot of an old stripper pole and that's why there are so many.\n\nApparently on weekend nights this place has Nick's Saturdays or something.

If you are getting tacos, Nicks way is a must. They add an extra tortilla, some jack cheese, and throw some guac on top. I used to strictly go with the carnitas and carne asada but I've been on a Pollo asada (grilled chicken) kick lately. All the meat is juicy and the tacos are crispy (would be a let down if they weren't given the name).\n\nIf you eat there, the green sauce they have is some of the best salsa I've ever had. Not sure what it is exactly and the guys behind the counter just laugh when I ask them what it is. I recommend dousing everything you eat with that gold.

I didn't even care about the Free Chips & Salsa check-in offer at this point.. \n\n\nSo after all that chaos, about 5:30PM now, and having to refeed the meter again, we finally dug into our 2 very troublesome tacos. [http://s3-media3.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SJxr6AsurCkPFQ88m4nfYw/l.jpg] \n\nMeh. The tacos were okay at best. The Carnita Taco (Nick's Way) was a disappointment. One crispy shell inside and some guac topped off is hardly worth the extra buck per.. no jalapenos either.. The Horchata was good though; it's tough finding a Mexican joint that actually serves it, so kudos. \n\nBut really, on a regular day, your gonna shell out about $5 per for a small taco with guacamole, which is absurd! Maybe they get some intoxicated help from Rogue.. or maybe that's just Nick's way of business..", "author": "Albert L."}

I heard Nick has moved on to the Taco Shop at Underdog, but the place still bears his name?  Well, if he has moved on, he should feel good knowing that they're keeping things the same...for the most part.\n\nThe first time I had Nick's was years ago, back when most people hadn't heard about it yet, Yelp hadn't hit its prime, and when a \"7x7\" probably had more to do with the size of an In N Out burger than a famous list.  Boy have things changed.  Back then, only a small section of Rouge was open for seating, but now the whole place is available, and the bar is open for service as well.\n\nThe menu is still the same as before (and the same as Underdog's), so I went with my usual Pescado (fish taco) Nick's way (cheese and guacamole) and added a Pollo Asado.  The Pescado is a solid taco, though my pieces of fish weren't as nice as what I've been accustomed to getting at Underdog.  I'm assuming it was just this one time that I got some shorter pieces, since I've usually been pretty happy with it, but at least it still tasted good.  The batter is nice and crispy, and the fish is flavorful without being too \"fishy\".  The pollo asado was something I had yet to try, so I was hopeful that it would be pretty good.  I liked the flavor (somewhat like its beefy cousin) and I thought it was seasoned nicely, but the meat was pretty dried out and it took away a bit from the taco.\n\nIt seems there's usually a bit of a line regardless of the day, but it moves pretty quickly, so it's not too bad of a wait.  For whatever reason, the tacos didn't seem quite as good as the ones over at Underdog, and not quite as good as what I remember.  Maybe Nick's needs to come back in, but still not too shabby overall.", "author": "Mike L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-02", "description": "Came here last Saturday after work and the Polk St. Pub Crawl was going on at the same time... it was so packed!  I felt that the restaurant was prepared for a large turnout as my food came out quickly but a little on the cold side.  I had ordered 2 pescado tacos, Nick's style, and a carne asada con todo burrito to go.  The fish tasted like it was fried hours ago--a little crispy yet a little soggy.  Not the most palatable and definitely up to the high standards they set in my books during the last many visits I came here when it was less busy.  I understand that the restaurant has to make a lot of food to accommodate the expected large number of guests, but at the expense of quality just doesn't cut it.  Frankly, when drunk, I'm sure all food (both good and bad) tastes good - so I'm not sure if the pub crawlers could tell that the food was cold or soggy!\n\nLastly, the restaurant seems to charge an extra surcharge every single time I go there.  I think it's the Healthy SF surcharge or sit-in-tax, but I'm not sure.  For example, when I get a pescado taco (not nick's way) it's normally $4.50, but when I pay, I have to pay $5.50.  With tax, it should no more than $5 dollars.  I'm surprised out of all the reviews on yelp, nobody has mentioned this.  Most restaurants in the city will notify customers of extra surcharges (especially for Healthy SF), but as far as I've experienced, I haven't seen any notification at Nick's since the last 2 years I've been coming here.  A little shady on their end. \n\nAll in all, Nick's is good if you come at an off-time (i.e. between lunch and dinner is a good time) so that you can get a table and can have fresher (not soggy or as soggy) food.  Taco Tuesdays are ALWAYS packed (so come early, otherwise you won't get a seat).  Going on days when there are pub crawls is JUST as packed.  \n\nThis place is still cash only, so bring cash!  You will also get charged extra for some unknown fee, so don't be surprised when your total comes out to be $1-2 extra (after 9.50% tax).  It would be nice to know what that extra unknown surcharge is though, but I guess it'll remain unknown in their shady books.", "author": "Matthew L."}

I could eat Nick's Crispy Tacos at any time of the day: breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Sometimes, after lunch or dinner, I even crave the crispy tacos as my dessert over any kind of ice cream, cookies, cake, etc. No joke peoples.\n\nWow, even writing this review right now is making me excited. Where do I begin? I pretty much always order all my tacos Nick's way cause you gotta. Comes with a crispy corn tortilla within a soft one that delivers extra crunch. And it also includes all the good stuff: a CRAP TON of yummy guac and some jack cheese. My go-to's are the camarones (shrimp) and grilled fish. I can't express to you how EFFFING GOOD these tacos are. Love all the salsa, lime, cabbage, cilantro, and onions that come with it, and the whole taco is just a piece of heaven with all the ingredients they load in it. 2 tacos usually fill me up, but sometimes I crave a 3rd just to top it all off... The chips and salsa are also really good here. \n\nSeating can often be a pain in the ass because it's a bar-type of atmosphere, and people are always running around trying to save tables for friends. But dude, it's so worth it. I've come here on Taco Tuesdays once, and it was SUPER crowded; perhaps it's because I showed up pretty late (9pm?). Although tacos are cheaper on these days, I'd actually rather come on a less crowded day and pay more because they're just that good; I want to be able to get my tacos quickly and enjoy these divine tacos in peace.\n\nMy bfs go-to's are usually the carne asada and pescado tacos (Nick's way of course). Those are also damn good but just a bit more on the fattier side. But who am I kidding? All these tacos are probably loaded with a crap ton of calories, but I'd gladly gain all the weight in the world to eat these tacos.\n\nAs for price, yeah yeah, they're more expensive than Mexican street tacos. But they're also WAY LARGER AND SO DELICIOUS. And you figure, for a lunch/dinner in SF, to pay $10-$12 for 2 tacos and be pretty full, that's one hell of a deal.

It's the chunky salsa, which isn't my cup of tea.\n\nWe ordered 1 grilled & 1 fried fish taco and the carnitas taco. I only had the grilled fished taco, so I can't really go much into the other two.

I think the best fish taco I've ever had is in Cozumel, so I compare every fish taco to that one. \n\nOn Sundays, they have a bottomless mimosa for $7 - everyone at the restaurant had a pitcher of mimosa.

Yeah it's cool that the decor is like a cabaret place, but it's pretty run down in my opinion. The cheap tables with the fancy chandeliers just doesn't go. Or maybe it is a cabaret/night club but in the day time it's a taco joint - seriously I don't know what's the theme is.  Also, the taco isn't cheap... it's pretty pricy in my opinion.", "author": "Karen C."}

After using yelp early in the morning to find an AWESOME brunch spot a short cab ride from my hotel; I was really confident in the reviews for Nick's Crispy Tacos.  Also, this restuarant was in walking distance from my hotel.... Bonus, right!?!?!\n\nWrong!  I walked past the place at first due mostly to my own unfamiliarity with San Fran but also due to confusing signage that has the adjoining club name listed first and the taco joint trailing after.  The signage did not deter me one bit however going into the club entrance and being greeted by the standing room only crowd was not at all what expected at 6:30 pm on a Saturday night.  Apparently, college football was happening.  \n\nSo, I went back out and finally found the \"entrance\" to Nick's. I waited 30 mins in line to place an order of 2 fish tacos with cheese and chips with guacamole.   10 additional minutes and 17 bucks later I found myself the proud owner of two bland, lukewarm, cabbage laden tacos and guacamole so weirdly green it was off-putting.  \n\nThe chips however were great", "author": "Jen W."}

Such casual food for such ornate (gaudy) diggs. \n\nI filled up on their super-thick chips, pico de gallo & guac ($3.50.) The salsa lacked acidity. I'd ordered a pollo asado taco (grilled chicken, $3.50) nick's way (extra $0.95) but packed it up to-go. Well-seasoned white meat chicken & black beans gave this heavy, fried Mexi-Cali concoction a slightly healthier quality.

It is boring and plain tasting.\n\nDefinitely come here for the Tuesday special after 5pm because you save yourself a few bucks literally.

I had almost od'ed on coffee at Philz and then took a tortuous bus ride on the 49-Van Ness from the Mission to meet my friend, and I was jittered out beyond even a kid's imagination. \n\nSo I needed food stat as I had one foot in the grave, gravely disabled as I was. My friend kept texting that he was almost \"at Nicky's\" as he kept calling it, having troubles of his own with the 1-Cali. You could not imagine a more cracked out scene than me waiting outside, my hunger pangs bellowing out to all four corners.\n\nOnce inside, I felt like I was in a strip club with a taqueria facade, or was it just my imagination that those tacos were giving lap dances? We got down and dirty in one of the booths, with tableside service when the tacos were ready. They weren't very crispy, but they did hit the spot for my undiscerning palate that night. Carnitas and carne asada were my favorites; I like a good chunk of meat on my tacos. They're large and in charge tacos to boot. If you get \"Nicky's style\" as my friend continued to say, it comes with guacamole and possibly other fixings for a buck extra. This provided a literal lap dance when oozing out onto my lap, but I wasn't one to care at the time.\n\nCame with a starving stomach and a Yelp Deals! voucher, left with a belly full, fuller wallet, and no holds barred imagination on how lascivious a taco can be if the setting is right.", "author": "Joanna M."}

For my boyfriend and I's first time at Nick's Crispy Tacos.. we were definitely confused!\n\nI came here on a Tuesday at around 4:10pm with my boyfriend. The restaurant is poorly lit, tacky, and just an awkward place to enjoy some tacos because every table was reserved. The cashier told us that if we come back at 5pm, the tacos are $2. Taco Tuesdays? Hell yeah! My boyfriend and I strolled around Polk Street before coming back at 5pm. There was already a line at 5pm, but thankfully it went by quickly. I ordered the cantaloupe fresca, a pollo taco Nick's way, a carne asada taco Nick's way while my boyfriend got a Mexican Coke, a carne asada Nick's way and a Fish Taco Nick's way. We both shared a Carne Asada nacho plate. The total came out to be $28 and some change which was a bit pricy in my opinion.\n\nThe wait wasn't that bad considering how many people were there. When our order arrived, I was definitely confused. All of our tacos were Nick's way which meant all of them were supposed to have guacamole. 3 out of the 4 tacos had guacamole on them. Our nachos, which were supposed to be Carne Asada, had pollo. Both of my tacos were carne asada when I clearly ordered a pollo one. My boyfriend had a pollo one when he clearly ordered a carne asada one. Too bad we didn't realize it till after we ate our meal. :( Everything was just all wrong.\n\nSo why the 4 stars? Because everything we had, regardless if the order was wrong, was so damn good! It was seriously finger licking good and at $3 a taco (a dollar more for Nick's way) I was definitely pleased!

The place gets packed pretty quickly and people swoop your seat. I'm sorry, but there's a way to eye peoples tables without being so damn obvious.  Plus, during the taco hours, I think they pre-make taco's. I got a Nick's way taco that was soggy...even though it had a crispy shell. Meaning my taco had been sitting there for at least 15 minutes. ICK.\n\nTaco Tuesdays is for any non-seafood taco for $2.  On any other day from 3-5 they have $1 off non-seafood tacos. Guess the theme is that seafood will never be discounted (boo). \n\nAtmosphere is ok, but not great. You go in from the side door and order at the counter. They'll give you a number and you go get a seat and wait for them.  Water and utensils are off to the side (either in the center of the room by the pillars or in the back).

They then display that pile of ingredients proudly on the front of the taco to get you excited.  All of this leads to a very satisfying and memorable taco that I'll probably be craving for a while.\n\nThe meats themselves are not out of this world, but they are certainly good.

Anytime a place claims they have the best anything, they are trying to make up for what they lack. And that is a paraphrased quote directly from Gordon Ramsey.\n\nMy first impression of the inside was one of horror. It looks like a seedy nightclub/strip bar that had the bright idea to try and sell \"Mexican\" food one day. Oh, wait, it is!! That is precisely what it is. A couple weeks ago (and years after I went there for tacos) I was misled into going to that club without knowing it was at Nick's. What a turn off. I'm sorry, but I just don't want to eat in a place that seconds as a gross city club that plays terrible music. \n\nThe tacos are greasy, soggy, over-filled pockets of bland food that are WAY overpriced. And I have had a fish taco in Ensenada. Maybe that's my problem. But I kind of doubt it. There are plenty of other respectable taquerias in the city that serve amazing and actual Mexican food. \n\nI think Nick's is best for certain people who are too afraid to venture into the Mission for authentic food. Such a tourist trap and waste of money!", "author": "Nikki G."}

My stomach is so happy right now because of Nick's Crispy Tacos. \nA friend suggested this place to visit in San Fran and from the name I was expecting a dumpy Mexican place with cheesy furniture. Ahh big surprise. Nick's Crispy Tacos looks like a fancy lounge where people should be eating filet mignon instead of stuffing giant burritos into their mouths. \n\nThere are these awesome velvety red plush booths situated around the restaurant and pretty twinkly chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Yes, chandeliers in a taco joint. \n\nNot sure if this is a regular thing but the night I went they had $3 margaritas. So cheap! Cocktails under $5 are hard to find! By the time my food came I was definitely more than a little drunk and ready to chow down. \n\nOur food order came surprisingly quickly. I'd been craving real fish tacos since I left California 2 years ago so ordered the pescado burrito to satiate my craving. Baja mayonnaise, crispy fried fish, cabbage and lime= foodgasm. Best fried fish I've had in a while. The flavor combinations were !!!! And my burritio was gigantic! When the waitress brought it out it looked like this huge phallic object wrapped in foil. Couldn't finish the whole thing so ate the rest for lunch the next day and came back a day later because the burritio was so good I wanted another one. Technically it's big enough where you shouldn't be eating the whole thing for one meal...\n\nBoth times I came to Nick's the vibe was really good. The bar was closed when I came in the daytime so the atmosphere was more laid back. I hear it gets busy on weekends but I'd def recommend waiting to eat at one of the red plush booths. It makes pigging out on Mexican food so much classier. I doubt I'll ever stuff a humongous burrito in mouth in a classier setting. \n\nNick's is very versatile. It's a great afterhours spot, pregame spot, and a great place just to eat some good Mexican with friend. I would love to come back to Nick's if I didn't live 3000 miles away. Def my fave place in San Fran to eat! Giving it an extra star just because of the pescado burrito", "author": "Yoshi K."}

The place is cute in a very relaxed/bar-like environment. The staff were all very friendly.\n\nTo start we've ordered nachos, which was house made chips topped with cheese sauce, gauc and pico de gallo. The gauc was amazing, maybe because I have been deprived from ripe avocados grown from California and had always been eating imported ones. We had ordered a Pescado taco, which is baja style fried fish in a corn tortilla with salsa, lime mayonnaise, cilantro, cabbage & onions. One of these tacos were pretty big and tasty as a matter of fact! The fish taco was truly amazing and it's not just a myth that I've been hearing all this time. I wish NYC make some amazing fish tacos like this. We've also tried the Pescado burrito, which is the same as the taco version, only this was in burrito form. However, the taco was no doubt better than the burrito. Since I'm at a Mexican restaurant, it's a must to order an elote (grill corn) with grated cheese and chilli powder. The corn was good, but honestly I had better back in NYC.\n\nOverall, I loved the food here, especially the fish taco. Darn, wish I was in this part of town right now, just so I can experience the fresh guac and fish taco again. I guess I'll go out and get some NY style thin crust pizza instead, which is something that I didn't find in California =)", "author": "Sandy C."}

I am a taco fiend, plus I work in the service industry and bring a lot of superbly tipping people to spots. We walked in 5 mins before their Monday night happy hour ended for $9 margarita pitchers and $5 drafts. The girl at the bar saw us walk in, my sister goes to order some tacos and I stood at the bar to get the drinks. The tender was putting away bottles and I did not want to be rude, so I waited until she was done to order. \n\nWe did not know they close at 10 and no one informed us. Then the bartender turns around to let us know that since it was 10 pm, after I waited 3+ minutes to have her attention, our pitcher would be twenty something and everything was the full price \"since the POS system switches back automatically.\" My sister had a similar experience when trying to get us tacos; they mumbled something about someone coming into clean at 9:30. \n\nIt was rude and horrible practice as far as customer service goes. So we said thanks, but no thanks, and took our business elsewhere. It's one thing to work at a business that is consistently busy, and have people walk in 5 mins before closing, but at least have the sense to let the guests know the deal.

This was an absolutely must, since Nick's is infamous for their lack of seating and long lines.\n\nAfter accepting the carpeted ceilings and Marina-style crowd that I had encountered here several times before, we headed to our table.\n\nLo and behold, a group of girls had taken our *reserved* table. So, we hailed the floor manager, who unapologetically explained to us that even though we had reservations, the new group was allowed to take our table. And, that \"unfortunately,\" the decision was above her. \n\nWhen asked if some higher-up was sleeping with, dating, or somehow involved with a girl in that group, the floor manager said, \"yes.\"\n\nI'm sorry, what just happened?? \n\nSo, all 10-15 of us were sent to a table suitable for 5. After 45 minutes of fitting 5 pitchers, a huge group of people, and a truckload of food on that puny table, the floor manager informed us that she had convinced the group of girls to swap with us.\n\nAt that point, we were so peeved and disappointed that, although we took the offer, it didn't really make up for the lack of professionalism and customer service.\n\nSo, that's what the two stars are for. Awful, awful handling of a ridiculous situation. And, you've been warned: TAKE YOUR RESERVATIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. \n\nAs for the food, here you go:\n\nPescado taco, Nick's Way ($5.95): Two corn tortillas are flash fried, then filled with lettuce, pico de gallo, fried fish, guacamole, and jack cheese. Super yummy, and very filling.\n\nNachos (~$6): Thick tortilla chips slathered with nacho cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole, and your meat of choice.\n\nQuesadilla ($2): This was a part of the TT deal. A simple quesadilla with jack cheese. No frills, but damn was that tortilla flaky and delicious.\n\nYes, the food is good. Yes, the waiters are nice and attentive.

Maybe these are better as \"sit-in\" fare. I must also clamor against the guacamole - several times I have tasted what is clearly Old Guac, which is totally unacceptable for the price they are charging. \n\nThe regular tacos are better and cheaper. Burritos are tasty, although definitely $1-$2 pricier than any of the authentic Mexican joints that are currently keeping themselves afloat in the Mission.\n\nHowever, unless you are really desperate for Mexican food and do not have an extra half an hour to get to any part of town other than the north side of Polk, there's no point. Pancho's, only a few blocks south, is just as good - if not better for certain items. Definitely more \"authentic\".

I ordered a grilled fish taco and a pescado (fried fish) taco, both Nick's way, which means they add guac and cheese in it.  The crispy inner shell/soft outer shell combo is GENIUS.  I was completely shocked after my first bite because the texture was THAT good.  As for the fish itself, you get very hearty and fresh pieces.  They are super generous with the fish, which I appreciated.  The grilled fish was tender and cooked well.  The fried fish pieces were also huge and delicious.  The veggies, cilantro, and lime were great complements too.  \n\nAnd also, dare I say it?  Yes, I will.  If you order it Nick's way, they put waaaaaay too much guac on your taco.  Which I guess really isn't a problem, and I should probably be slapped for whining about anybody giving you too much guac.  But...yeah, there's a lot of guac on those tacos, and that's an understatement. \n\nThese tacos are also GINORMOUS.  When I was about to order, I was debating getting three tacos because I like to eat, but the guy taking our order was like, \"If you're hungry, eat two.\"  I was like, \"Hmm...I'm REALLY hungry.  How about 3?\"  He looked at me and was like, \"No.\"  And he had this deadpan, serious look when he said that - like, seriously, NO, three tacos = no bueno!  \n\nHe was right.  After two of those monster-sized tacos, I felt 100% stuffed.  Maybe even 110% stuffed.  I have never encountered such HUGE tacos, so loaded with plenty fish and lots of toppings.  Yes, if you're hungry, get two.  Although, my friend was also hungry, and he said he felt like he could eat another one after he had his two tacos.  So maybe you may be able to eat three if you're ravenous.\n\nThe decor here is also extremely odd.  I did not expect a place that does Mexican food to have chandeliers.

She kept giving me dirty looks throughout the night not letting me feel comfortable as I ate and three of my other friends noticed this rude behavior as well.

DK suggested Nick's Crispy Tacos on Polk and Broadway without hesitation. He didn't even ask what I felt like eating or where I was in the city. It didn't matter. Because he knows I love a good taco and awesome pico de gallo. Which is exactly what we found at Nick's Crispy Tacos. When your friend tells you, \"You'll like it,\" that's a pretty confident statement. Especially to me. \n\nWe parked at a meter at $2/hour, with a 1 hour limit. Stupid SF meters. You can enter from the corner, or through their \"main\" entrance under the name of the restaurant. You walk in and there's a counter to your right and a menu above that. There's usually a line (it never died down the entire hour we were there), but it moves fast because the people there know what they're doing. I ordered a carne asada taco (Nick's style which comes with a crispy shell layer and cheese) and a grilled fish taco. They were about $4/each, not cheap for tacos. We also got a large watermelon agua fresca $4 and a salsa and chips with guacamole $4. They hand you your drink and chips right there as you pay. CASH ONLY. Total bill for 4 tacos, chips and drink came out to about $27. \n\nYou look around and there is red decor with semi-circle booths, tables scattered and a huge bar in the adjacent room. I went to the bathroom and it was super creepy, with doors falling off the hinges and you can just tell that this is a place where either murders happen or people barf after drinking too much. Found out it was the latter since this place turns into a lounge at night (no tacos!). \n\nYou get a number and they bring out your food fairly quickly. The tacos were pretty substantial, but I wasn't really into Nick's style. The crispy shell didn't do anything for me, but the filling was good. Next time I'll know to get it without beans because that just takes away from the flavor of the meat. The carne asada was tasty and filling. The grilled fish was pretty good too and the piece of fish was generous. \n\nBest thing was the chips and salsa with a scoop of guacamole. I would've been happy with more guac, but for $4, you really can't complain. The pico de gallo was piled high on thick chips. I couldn't stop stuffing my face with them. One person in our group got the quesadilla, which was the biggest quesadilla I've ever seen, and I'm not just saying that to be polite. Someone else got chicken tacos, which she liked. And GL got baja style fish and carnitas. He said he didn't really like the flavor of the carnitas, but it also could've been because it was Nick's way too. That just wasn't a favorite at our table.\n\nGreat experience, friendly service and I'm still thinking about the chips and salsa. That night, I saw Nick's listed as a favorite in 7x7 magazine in the hotel room. Good friends don't steer you wrong.", "author": "Ming-Jou C."}

They also have burritos that are very good, however the quality of the burrito tortilla is not great.  I've been to a number of Mexican restaurants that have really good tortillas and that is what makes the burrito great.  These tortillas are soft and grewy, almost wet.  If they had different tortillas That were thinner and a little bit crispy, the burritos could take it to the next level.  It's a cash only establishment so that is something to remember.\n\nNicks is attached to a bar that are 2 separate business entities.  The cool thing about the place is that the bar allows you to sit at the bar and eat when you order some food.

My Girlfriend got her tacos 'Nick's Way' so we could experience the crispy tacos everyone raves about(which is an extra charge)- but they tasted the same as my tacos did. There was either a small difference that we couldn't really notice, or they forgot to make them 'Nick's Way' because they tasted exactly the same- no crispiness :(\n\nHowever, I really enjoyed the Nachos. I like when restaurants use nacho cheese instead of melted shredded cheese- Nick's uses a very mild spicy nacho cheese! Nice! Look at the ooey gooey cheese lol http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ziVej4oW2JpUConTE_Y_mg?userid=-4BEUkLvHQntN6qPfKJP2w  \n\nOne thing that sucks is Nick's is CASH ONLY- I had to run across the street to Walgreens and pull out $40.

All tacos they give you two tortilla, but for crispy, they fry one of the tortilla leaving the other same, so you get this great contrast in texture.  They also add this huge huge glob of guac on top.  Delicious.\n\nMy favorite turned out to be the fried fish taco.  Great large piece of fried fish with a really light and refreshing cream sauce.  Add some of their house salsa and I'm in taco heaven.  Don't know if it's beer battered but man that fish batter was good.  As for the grilled, definitely the healthier option and really good too.\n\nThe shrimp was a little forgetful just because the fish tacos were so outstanding.  Nevertheless, lots of shrimp in the taco and I would suggest not adding salsa first to really taste the shrimp, cause the flavors might get covered up by the salsas.\n\nIf you get it crispy, it'll be around $4-6 per taco.

The carne asada was the only even moderately edible component to my burrito. The tortilla was barely cooked, the rice was old and mushy, and the chips had obviously been overcooked and left under a heat lamp. The pico de gallo was under-seasoned and the salsa (which were in squeeze bottles on every table) came in 2 flavors: green goo and red mayo-something? I asked for some hot sauce or picante and what I got was a habanero version of the cream based red sauce on the table - still no heat.\n\nOrdered another round of drinks and received the wrong beer.

Instead I found mediocrity aligned with the other ubiquitous \"I-need-to-be drunk\" places that infest the city.\n\nPlease, someone take a 1-minute walk beyond the border in TJ, passed the one-way turnstile into Mexico, and try the first taco place you can find. Can someone please replicate this here? Please?\n\nAs for SF, the best crispy taco I've found is at the unfriendly El Faro, but they have their own set of issues that make the dining there lame, like bad customer service and the tendency to nickel-n-dime you for every ingredient add-on, and go further to charge you for salsa and chip. So avoid that place as well.\n\nBest crispy I've found north of LA is in Alameda, at Juanita's Restaurant, but note, this was at 2:30am after a few rounds at the legendary Forbidden Island. Still, this place rivals LA. Viva lard.", "author": "Brian J."}

It doesn't matter whether I am on a plane, train or automobile, if I am mobile, I am not eating anything. So, add this quirk to several hours of consciousness and enough beer to make a college coed feel nauseous and you can tell that I was in trouble. I needed tacos. I don't know why I fixated on tacos as opposed to pizza, kebabs or any one of a number of street foods. But, I needed tacos and I needed them now.\n\nChicago has a rather large Mexican population so, as a Chicagoan, I am fortunate to have my choice of Mexican fare whenever and whatever. Coming to San Francisco, I thought there'd be an embarrassment of riches when it came to Mexican food. Maybe...but I didn't find them here. Perhaps it was my bad. I didn't order a taco. After all my Veruca Salting, I ordered a burrito. Here's my thinking. The tacos here cost about as much as a baby on the black market. If I am going to expend that kinda cash, I figure I might as well go for the big portion ticket. You know. So, I ordered a chicken burrito with guac, cheese and all the fixins. I put the order in, I wept at the price, I received the food, I smiled at the heft of the burrito (heavy) and I tore in. \n\nEh. It was ai'ight. Even in my drunken starving stupor, I wasn't that impressed with the food. I didn't taste anything crispy or crunchy. Maybe that's reserved for tacos only. The meat was a little charred. The guac didn't have much taste and my cheese was more 'pug' than 'chihuahua.' I didn't get it. I should have been in the target demo for this place (drunken dumb@ss) and I wasn't getting it. I ate the burrito. I was hungry and needed the assist to sobriety, but I have definitely had better in Chicago. Honestly, I was a little shocked. Better luck next time?", "author": "Johnny T."}

I was in the area and just yelped Tacos and I saw this was listed as #1 2012 SF taco spot and thought, hell yea! We have to try it! Wished I didn't. \n\nHuge crowds, due to the fact this place becomes a nightclub after 7pm or something.  Seating is impossible and the lines to order can be utterly ridiculous after 7pm.  It's an order at the register and pick a table affair.  Drinks OR food, yes, there are separate lines for each though a waitress does walk the line sometimes and take orders for drinks. CASH ONLY.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I arrive, we wait in the perilously long line for food and order tacos, yay! We go outside and find outdoor seating, but we had to chug our drinks, because at THIS venue, you can't drink outside even though there are tables. hah.\n\n\nThe food:\n\nEvery single meat taco we got (pork, beef, chicken) was SUPER dry. The shrimp taco was pretty much tasteless, except for the guacamole I had slathered on it.  The cheese quesadilla was the only highlight of the meal, and we ordered 6 tacos to boot.  \n\nI had tried to order more guacamole for our nachos (didn't come with nearly enough) and some more drinks (until I found out I couldn't), but it was impossible. The line was already 20+ people deep. \n\nService: Terrible. They forgot my side of sour cream and side of rice and beans.  I understood they were slammed and it actually didn't bother me until I got back to the counter and told them they forgot my sides (nicely!) The guy behind the counter rolled his eyes, went back to the kitchen for a few minutes then handed it to me with a blank face.  That didn't make me feel to great about taking food from someone who clearly thought my requesting the food I ordered was tedious.  What else did he put in there other than disdain?\n\nThere are about 6 outdoor tables, each with two chairs. Now what REALLY destroyed the experience here was the fact that it's first come first serve.  Let me explain.  Three heifers were were taking up a table outside and grabbed one seat from another table, leaving it with just one.  Fine, first come first serve.  BUT, they were finished eating and just lingered for 40 minutes longer while we sat right next to them eating, minus one chair. Same story with the couple next to us, finished eating when we sat down and just stayed there for even longer.  They were still there when we left! My boyfriend stood the entire time, refusing to alternate with me. \n\nC'mon, Management...MANAGE! Just put a time limit outside, it's just 6 tables! Since no one can have alcohol outside, and you bet NO ONE is going to wait in line twice for more food,  there's no reason to linger other than someone being a cheap @$$hole. Make them go inside and booze it up if they want to stay. Or, be smart and instead of tables, fill the damn place with counters. Way less space and better height if 40% of the people are going to be standing when they eat their food. \n\nCrowd: Lame. Lots of eyeballing and some attitudes flying left and right that left me with a less than favorable opinion of the neighborhood. Maybe I'm just too humanl, but if I saw someone trying to eat dinner and I had the extra chair I snagged from the table, I'd offer to move the party elsewhere. Plus, why would I sit outside in a clearly slammed place after I'm done with my meal, where people are eating out of plastic baskets standing up when I could just move down the block to another cafe, bar, parking lot, whatever! \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, there's nothing worth going back for.  \n\nUnless you're a dude on the prowl.

But we were already here, and this place was oh so popular. It had to be good, right? It was. \n\nPros:\n-Popular place. All those people can attest to the fact that it's good, right? \n-Really good tacos. A taco is ~$4, but it's worth it because they're very generous and super filling tacos, not puny Taco Tuesday tacos. 2 tacos are enough for a girl. Probably 3-4 for a guy. I got the vegetarian taco and pollo asada taco cooked Nick's Crispy Taco style (soft taco inside and a crispy taco outside) I loved the pollo asada one. Neither felt too heavy and it was def filling. They were very generous w/ the toppings, i.e. beans, lettuce, and best of all, guacamole! \n-Green salsa verde sauce (on the table). So good.  \n\nCons:\n-Long ass lines. ~15 minute wait to order your food. \n-Hard to find seating. Waited ~20-30 minutes to find proper seating. \n-Dark/dim lighting. Literally can't see what you're eating. But it's not like a romantic dim, it's an annoying reddish hue. \n-Place turns into a nightclub after like, 10 PM... from Nick's Crispy Tacos to Rouge Night Club... Weird. No wonder the place resembles more of a lounge than a taco joint. \n-Margarita was meh, mainly because it was on the rocks instead of blended. I thought it would be the latter. Def very very strong at first. Costs $3 for a glass, or $18 for a pitcher. \n-Cash only or level up. Ugh! Luckily I'm from out of town so I always carry cash on vacay, but usually I don't. And, I don't have a smart phone so I can't level up via mobile. I hate when places are cash only. C'mon, it's the 21st century. Accept debit/credit and dont' be so cheap.", "author": "Phoebe C."}

We got an assortment of carne asada, pollo, pollo asado, and carnitas tacos. Tacos were alright, they seemed a little bland and lacking in flavor, we probably shouldn't have cheaped out and gotten them Nick's way instead. Favorite was the carne asada. I will say that the tacos were sized quite well and crammed with meat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-02", "description": "Welcome to another \"Dear Archie G.\" review.\n\nDear Archie G.,\n\nThis upcoming weekend, I am visiting from out of state and heading into San Francisco to visit my best friend. While in town, I wanted to grab some delicious Mexican food for dinner. Unfortunately, Mexican food in San Francisco tends to be pretty terrible. \n\nNo matter where I go or highly ranked on Yelp, I am left disappointed. Isn't San Francisco supposed to be the food capitol of California? If so, why is Mexican, as well as other cuisines so mediocre or downright bad here? Can you please recommend a good Mexican joint that focuses on food, rather than the (drunken) atmosphere surrounded by imbeciles with multiple popped collars?\n\n-Sexy Mexi in Manhattan\n\nDear Sexy Mexi,\n\nThere's a common misconception that San Francisco is some sort of culinary destination. The truth is, San Francisco is full of transplants that left their hometowns because they felt different and unaccepted. They grew up on food that tasted like paper with a sprinkle of salt. Sadly, they don't know any better, so they think any steaming pile of crap on a plate is delicious. \n\nEven worse, they are quick to jump on social networks and rave about their rat feces burrito. Eventually, new transplants are afraid of being different and unaccepted in their new \"hometown\" of San Francisco (since they moved here for those same reasons), so they follow the lead of transplants before them and rave about \"Crunchy Cucaracha Enchiladas\" at the famous \"Taqueria Basura.\" \n\nSadly, people perceive value. And that mediocre Mexican joint is rocking a 4 star rating in San Francisco in the lower Haight, would only merit 2 stars in East San Jose because San Jose natives know what Mexican food is supposed to taste like. They just know better. Yeah, maybe they don't know which brand of skinny jeans are in, or what alternative rock band that has only sold 17 albums is super cool right now, or where to buy a powder pink Giants cap; but they do know Mexican food. Trust.\n\nWith all of that said, as I am from San Jose, I highly recommend Nick's Crispy Tacos in San Francisco. This place would get 4 stars in San Jose, San Francisco, or Tijuana. It's that damn good.\n\nIt's located in Nob Hill and has limited hours. It's only open during the day as the place turns into \"Rouge\" at night, a dance club that  has repetitive music that goes uns, uns, uns...\n\nThis place has real value, as the only use the best ingredients. The menu is limited, so it's easy to order. I'll make it even easier for you. Just walk up to the register and order two tacos \"Nick's Way\" (with carne asada, carnitas, or fish) and a lime flavored Jarrito or horchata. This should be enough to feed you. And if you aren't concerned about fitting into some San Francisco style skinny jeans, go wild and order a third taco. And if you ever want to be a contestant on \"The Biggest Loser,\" just step up the plate and order a fourth taco. Rawr!\n\nWhen a taco here is done \"Nick's Way,\" they fry the inner tortilla, wrap it with a warm tortilla, and then slab a pound of amazing Guacamole on top. It's freakin' delicious. Get ready to \"Guac and Roll.\" Ba-Dum-Cha!\n\nBad joke aside, you really have pay the extra $1 to get them Nick's Way. It's totally worth it. Nick can have his way with me anytime. Oh wait. Not sure if I should have said it like that. I was kidding. No, seriously. It's not like that. I swear.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy your meal. I know I do every single time. And it's one of the few joints in San Francisco that actually lives up to the hype.", "author": "Archie G."}

Both were yummy and delightful, as desired. The fish was super crispy and huge, hardly a date taco. Smothered in guac and all wrapped for your dining pleasure in wax paper to help avoid mess.

The place is casual (weekend brunch you can even catch people in shacker attire) but it tries to be classy with red/black color scheme & nice chandeliers.  \n\nThe food is choice -- big portions, good flavor etc.  In particular I like their guacamole and their breakfast burritos.  Pretty big menu and they are good about customizing it to your liking.  They also have a full bar, which takes CCs (restaurant section is cash only but has an ATM).  They have a number of TVs but in my experience it is not a great place to watch a game if you actually care about said game, as the place gets too crowded/loud / hard to find a seat (and the TVs are kind of small / far from the booths).  \n\nA lot of people like to talk about $2 Taco Tuesdays, but in my opinion the lines get way too long if you actually want to eat (although Tuesdays can be a good time to people-watch).  I prefer the 2 for $5 Fridays and the bottomless mimosa Sun brunch (goes until 3) and the all day happy hour on Sundays as well.  The line can be daunting, but once you make it through, they are very fast to bring out your food.   The space is big but seating can be deceptively hard to come by during weekends and obviously on Tuesdays when the place is packed to the gills. \n\nOne request if the Nick's folks are reading this: y'all need to get some bigger cups for the complimentary water!  I can go through like 6 cups over the course of a meal...sometimes it feels like I'm spending more time going over to that carafe than I am actually eating the meal / socializing with my friends.", "author": "Molly B."}

We got 2 tacos 'Nick's Way' (crispy with guac) one pescado (that's fish for all of you non-spanish speaking friends) and one carne asada. Also, we got a pollo asada burrito 'Con todo' (with sour cream, cheese, and guac). When we got to the restaurant our food was ready to go and we could pay with Level Up which I love! Otherwise it was cash only. The total was $21 with tax and was more than enough food for the both of us.\n\nAfter walking a quarter mile home the tacos and burrito were still in pretty good shape considering their trip, and they were delicious. However, there was a strong winner that we both fought over and it was the pescado taco. Neither one of us thought that we liked fish tacos that much but this was the best we had ever had! The sauce was delicious and the fish was fresh without any hint of fishy-ness. The fresh lime packed in the foil was such an added bonus when squeezed over the top of the taco and the guac added a perfect creamy texture to the mix.

No offense, buddy ;).\n\nSince the first time I went to Nicks I've always asked myself, where does Nick hide? What is Nicks Crispy Tacos? Is it a bar? a taqueria in the day? a club at night? All we really know is it's Mexican, cheap, quick, the lines can go all the way to Shanghai Kelly's, particularly sketchy that one side only allows cash and the other side accepts cash and cards, It's popular on Taco Tuesdays, you can reserve your table beforehand, has TV's, tacky looking chandeliers, red booths, red curtains, and other red looking things.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-03", "description": "Who knew?  The best tacos are not in the Mission and are not made by Mexicans!  Maybe Nick's is pandering to the American palate that likes greasy crispy fried texture and gooey cheese product, but with over 1300 Yelp reviews it can't be wrong.  More pricey than a taco truck or Mission dive, after taxes the tacos will run you between $4.60 and $5.70 (since you shouldn't even think about getting it any way but Nick's Way)!  I went just after the lunch rush and the lines still moved slowly, I can't begin to imagine the hot mess this place will be with all the el cheapo patrons on Taco Tuesdays!\n\nNachos: It always annoys me that I cannot get nacho cheese at any of those taquerias in the Mission.  Screw queso blanco and oaxaca cheese, I want the orange kind that oozes.  No clue what their recipe is, but probably doesn't include the lesser varieties like Velveeta and Cheez Whiz.  The nacho chips themselves were good too - hardy.\n\nNick's Way Taco: Two medium sized soft corn tortilla shells (from a bag, not freshly gridled from fresh masa).  The inner most shell is semi-deep fried to give a strong structure and amazing crunch.  It also makes the tortilla shell tastier because they're infused with grease.  The regular soft outer tortilla shell adds a texture contrast, almost like the Double Decker at Taco Bell.  They also add on some guacamole and jack cheese.  Wish there was a lower price point option for just the crispy upgrade since the cheese and guac addition don't add much taste.\n\nGuacamole: I've been spoiled by the authentic Mexican restaurants that have authentic Mexicans scooping authentic Mexican avocados at your table side for an authentic Mexican freshly hand hacked guacamole.  It was good here, just probably made earlier in the morning and machine processed so missing that finer detail.\n\nCarne Asada: Cubes of grilled seared goodness with no soggy pieces.  The pinto beans were a bit overkill because who needs beans when you have that much meat?\n\nPollo: My favorite of the two chickens.  Mostly white meat, but tender since it was slow simmered.  Loads of flavor.  Once again, the pinto beans were kind of unnecessary.\n\nPollo Asado: Bland, dry and tough.  Horrible way to mess up free range poultry.\n\nCarnitas: iNo es aut\u00e9ntico!  Soft pulled pork without any of the crispiness we love from true carnitas.  Also seemed to be lacking on the spices.  The pinto beans seemed like flavorless filler in this one.\n\nPescado: Fried tortilla shell, fried fish and lime mayonnaise... sounds like a perfect American innovation on Mexican food.  The breading is full of spices and is extra crunchy, way better than those boring fish & chips style filets other taco joints use.  The cabbage and cilantro were good choices too, helping balance out the fried factor.\n\nGrilled Fish: Nowhere near as good as the pescado.  Bland and a tad fishy tasting.\n\nCamarones: Could this be?  My first meaty shrimp taco that doesn't taste rubbery or overcooked?  Totally awesome.  The shrimp looks almost unreal in the shape of cool shrimp discs.\n\nVegetariano: Bad idea.  Other tacos already have pinto beans in them (carne asada, carintas and pollo) so there was nothing new in this one.  At the same price of four other meat tacos, why bother?\n\nMelon Agua Fresca: A disappointment.  The melon seemed pur\u00e9ed so each sip yielded a bunch of grainy slush.  Would have been better if in the form of  larger muddled chunks to add flavor to the sugar water without bordering a smoothie texture.", "author": "Adam B."}

Of course I was kidding.\" And all these years spent in silence, thinking I belonged to blood money. \n\nThis is mainly a way of iterating to you, dear reader, my affection for Nick's Crispy.

He tied together buttons as weights and before you know it, I'm eating his victory. And that victory tastes great. Perfectly grilled (with a nice little blackened seasoning) and smothered with a dollop of guacamole. Also divine was the free range funky chicken taco.

I had heard all the hype, I had heard about the massive quantities of guacamole, and I had heard about the $2 deal for Taco Tuesday. But, hailing from the land of OG Mexican Food (which is socal, not Mexico, contrary to popular belief) I didn't want to get my hopes up. This Tuesday, however, I got one of those really bad cravings for guacamole (you know the kind I'm talking about) and I just couldn't put off a trip to Nick's any longer. \n\nAnother yelper fittingly deemed these \"White girl tacos\"- which, being a white girl, doesn't offend me because it's true. But they have the tortillas down, they have **** tons (fill-in-the-blank with your expletive of choice) of guacamole (provided you get it \"Nick's\" way) and they have massive shrimp in their tacos which are my absolute fave. They were, I must admit, delicious. and HUGE! Can we take a minute to awe at the size of these tacos?! I guess the rumors are true...\n\nThe only downside is that Taco Tuesday doesn't start until 5 or 6, and I went in at 12pm right after they opened (so no taco tuesday price, sad day). 11 dollars for two tacos is pretty steep but considering the fact that I usually shell out $6 for guacamole on a $2 taco (I like guac, okay??!!!)

I had the pescado, fried fish taco and it was the best fried fish taco I've ever had so far.  It's packed with salsa, lettuce and guacamole with a decent size crispy fried fish in the middle.. mMm..

No one cleared our spot when we sat down, and we were left with prior guests' drinks sitting on our table during the entire meal.  When our orders arrived, we were not given Nick's signature bottles of salsa, and instead were instructed by a server to grab them ourselves from a nearby table, where people were already sitting (we had to ask these patrons if they wouldn't mind us taking the bottles, since they were not using them).  Unlike at Underdogs, where servers come by repeatedly to pick up our soiled napkins before we're even done eating, no one here checked in with us even once.  \n\nAdditionally, I swear they skimp on the food here.  The chips and guac were not as plentiful, and my two tacos were not nearly as filling as they've been at Underdogs.  \n\nLastly, cash only (this isn't a huge deal, but still a con compared to Underdogs).\n\nNext time I'm not bothering venturing out to Nob Hill for Nick's Crispy Tacos - I'm sticking to my neck of the woods and heading to Underdogs.", "author": "Mel T."}

I was quite disappointed since the carne asada didnt have any meat in it- they must of forgotten =( The fish taco was really good though!\n\nWhile I was waiting for my food, one of the customers found a ring in his burrito which must have fallen off of someone's hand. The manager was very apologetic and gave the guy 10 bucks back for the cost of his burrito- luckily he the old man didnt bite into it.", "author": "M W."}

Come on a regular day, the tacos aren't REALLY worth the price, especially after you get it Nick's way just to try to get some guacamole in there. Then if you come on Taco Tuesday, you better damn well make sure you get there EARLY. Early as in, right after work early. Unless you want to spend 30 min hovering and waiting for someone to stand up from a table, go by 6. Otherwise be prepared to eat while standing or waiting.

Yeah, I said it.\n\nWe went here after the rave reviews with the Yelp coupon in hand, expecting our minds to be blown. I realized a few different things immediately after stepping inside: it's dangerously overpriced, and we were way too sober.\n\nD and I both ordered two tacos, \"Nick's Way\" (when in Rome, I guess), for an additional $1 on an already expensive, $3.25 taco (I might mention here that at Taco Grill in Oakland, you can get Niman Ranch meat stuffed to the max in a handmade tortilla for only $2). D also ordered elote and a mango agua fresca. With an order of chips and salsa, the total was over $30!\n\nWhile we snacked on our expensive chips and salsa, we were able to enjoy the only fun thing about Nick's - people watching. Had the food been as mind-blowingly good as everyone says, I would have been okay with paying $30, but unfortunately it just wasn't.\n\nThe \"crispy\" tacos are pretty huge, but pretty flavorless. The guacamole lacks flavor, the meat's overly sweet and/or dry, and the fried shell gets stale inside the outer store-bought, steamed tortilla. The elote was mushy, and the agua fresca was atrociously bad. It had tiny little rock-hard chunks of mango in it that tasted like we were swallowing sand.\n\nDespite having the Yelp Deal coupon, I felt totally robbed. It was a huge mistake to trek all the way from the East Bay, and I pray that if I ever get trapped into going out in North Beach that it's nowhere near this place.", "author": "Kara R."}

My one minor complaint is that it was a little too heavy on the cilantro, not my favorite.\n\nEven better is the $3.25 Pescado Taco, which they describe as a Baja-style fried fish, again in a corn tortilla but with spicier salsas, a lime-flavored mayonnaise, cilantro, shredded cabbage and onions. Both were delish. And for just 75 cents more, you can have them Nick's Way which means they pan fry them with cheese and guacamole...sounds wicked good.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, we also tried the $5.50 Carnitas Quesadilla, which replicates Nick's Way in a big way. It had braised shredded pork folded with pico de gallo and melted jack cheese in a pan-fried folded flour tortilla. The pork was not what I expected...it was better...like the kind of pulled pork you'd get at a Kansas City barbecue joint.

Nick's is a large, cash only restaurant/bar/nightclub. The inside of Nick's is huge. Right when you walk in you see a wide open area that serves as the dining room by day and a dance floor at night. To the right of that is a counter where you place your food order. To the left is the bar area where there are about five or six flat screen televisions hanging above the bar and about nine or ten booths that surround the bar. The inside of Nick's is painted blood red and there are big, gold chandeliers hanging throughout the restaurant. \n\nMy friends and I arrived at Nick's right when they opened at 10am. On Sundays, when football is on, they offer many early morning drink specials. I usually do not like to drink alcohol that early in the morning but on their AM HH menu they offered large carafe's of Mimosa's for about ten dollars, which is a great deal. My friends and I went through four carafe's before we left Nick's at 1pm. Besides the tasty Mimosa's, we also ordered lots of nachos and crispy tacos. The nachos at Nick's are pretty good, definitely not the best I have had, but better than average. Nick's nachos are made with tortilla chips, nacho cheese, carne asada, tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, and jalape\u00f1os. The asada in these nachos was really juicy and tender. Each of us also ordered a bunch of crispy tacos. A crispy taco at Nick's is made by filling a crispy corn tortilla with whatever meat you choose, plus veggies and sauces, and then wrapping a soft corn tortilla around the crispy taco. \nThese are the crispy tacos I ordered: \nBreakfast CT- Scrambled eggs, cheese, french fries, fresh salsa and sour cream \nChicken CT- Strips of juicy chicken, cheese, lettuce, black beans, salsa, sour cream and guacamole \nCrispy Fish CT- Deep fried fish, cabbage, guacamole and lime mayo \n\nAll three tacos were great. I really liked how they use both a crispy tortilla and a soft corn tortilla. The best of my three tacos had to be the fish. The fish fillet itself was pretty big and perfectly deep fried in a delicious batter that was semi sweet. The fish was not greasy at all, which is unusual for a deep fried piece of fish. \n\nThe prices for food here is somewhat high. For my three tacos and an order of nachos my bill was over $25. Since the tacos are not huge I kind of felt like they shouldn't charge $4 a piece for them. \nThe service here was great. Once our orders was placed it took them less than ten minutes to have our food delivered to us at the bar. \n\nIf you're a fan of nachos crispy taco's, Mimosa's and football than you need to check out Nick's. If you happen to be a fan of those three things than I guarantee you will love Nick's.", "author": "Craig R."}

Then a customer points to some other guy who has been watching you this whole time.  Apparently he works here and is now ready to help take your order.  You order the burrito with no sour cream.  Your burrito finally arrives with as much sour cream as they could fit in the tortilla.  Nix this place if you care to be treated good.  But in spite of this, that was a damn good burito.  So its getting 2 stars for the burrito only.  Oh, I think I was charged incorrectly too.", "author": "Gary A."}

The Mexican Coke was warm, and the strawberry drink tasted like water, no strawberry. The tacos were the blandest tacos that I've EVER had in all of California. The only redeeming quality of one of the tacos was that the shrimp/prawns were actually ample sized. Everything else sucked. \n\nI honestly wanted to cry while eating these tacos. Why? Was it the fact that I had just paid $36 in San Francisco for some horrible tacos when I could've gone to ANY random taco truck and gotten 10x better tacos for a fraction of the price? Or was it that I had just ruined my appetite with these faux-tacos and now had to wait a few hours before being able to eat tasty foods again?

Thanks to Yelp Deals, we had a prepaid coupon (God, I feel like I'm turning into my Mom) for $20 worth of food for $10. Lemme preface by saying that while I still had my Nick's cherry, the wife HATES Nick's. Unfortunately, our neighborhood is pretty devoid of cheap, decent Mexican food (come back, La Salsa!) and we didn't have enough time to shoot down to the Mission. Still, we figured with the deal, we'd be covered for food and 2 beers.\n\nWhat the woman didn't mention is that Nick's is retardedly expensive. We ordered 2 pescado burritos Nick's style and 2 beers. I happily handed my coupon to the gentleman behind the counter (like the cheap bastard that I am) waited for my rations like a good little boy. So you could imagine my surprise when he said \"that'll be $9.75\"! I tried explaining that I signed up for the $20 for $10 deal, but apparently with Nick's ass-inine pricing $20 doesn't even cover the 2 burritos. To make matters worse, they only take cash, so I had to run across the street to Walgreens and buy a homeless guy a banana (seriously) to avoid $6 in ATM fees. No wonder the place was freaking empty, and 2 patrons actually walked out without their takeout orders!\n\nWell, my cash was already wasted and I was starving, so I sat down and waited for my food. So out comes the 2 burritos, sans chips. How can one eat a burrito without having fresh chips to scoop up the slop that falls out? So I mention to our server that he forgot the chips, and he says \"oh no, they're extra\"! Are you f*cking kidding me? $30 for 2 burritos and 2 beers and I have to pay extra for chips?!? Nick's might be the most expensive taqueria in the City, even more so than Papalote, home of a $20 burrito.

The reason people keep giving it a good review is because they have no standards. \n\nThe first time I went, I ordered a fish burrito. Fried fish, cabbage, cilantro, lime... The tortilla had the consistency of the rice paper that had been soaking all night. Not what I was expecting, but this happens when you put a gallon of water in a burrito. Also a margarita. $6.50 for a tiny thing only three-quarters full. Don't try getting a buzz on here. \n\nLater, I decided I must actually order the Nick's \"crispy taco,\" since that's what the place is called, and went back. Two tacos I got--pollo asado (that's grilled chicken, folks) and carnitas (yes, slow-roasted pork)--the meats for both were incredibly dry. And this was like noon--your meats shouldn't be that dry--maybe they were day-olds microwaved. \n\nNow, the chips, although you have to order them separately, were good, greasy, and plentiful, with salsa heaped on--one star. \n\nNow, the tortillas must be commented on again. What they do with these tacos, if you haven't heard, is take a crispy shell corn tortilla and surround it by, I think two soft shells. This provides for an unmatched taco durability, and that's why they get two stars. Huge, overfilled tacos that I doused in sauce attempting to rehydrate the meat, and they still didn't fall apart.

This is definitely something different from other mexican places I've been to. Very hip (Do people say \"hip\" anymore?) and trendy, although I don't understand the cheap looking steel tables and chairs scattered around the floor. \n\nWe didn't know about Nick's way, but the cashier seemed to added it automatically. I had the crispy fish burrito and boyfriend had crispy fish tacos and carnitas tacos. \n\nThe food was good and in generous size. Every bite I took into the fish burrito was a mouthful of lettuce, crispy-fried fish and sauce. It certainly satisfied my craving. I tried the carnitas one too and it was pretty good. But I'd recommend the burrito more since it's a better value and it's essentially the same thing.

You can order to go at the bar (super friendly staff), and the restaurant itself has a sit-down area that's really big with booths and tables. \n\nMy friends also ordered the fish tacos, but for some reason, they didn't seem very impressed.  It wasn't stellar for them.  I guess to each his/her own.\n\nThe hot sauce is great-- I've never had it that hot, and usually you have to ask for it because it's not always on the table in a little red tube.", "author": "Sunny S."}

I was reflecting back on my weekend and was thinking about the food I ate and remembered that I had Nick's Crispy Tacos on Saturday night--and decided to yelp it!\n\nWe entered and I asked \"'what is this a dirty strip club in the evening? I apparently forgot to bring my 1 dollar bills\" The walls, floors, and seats were red (duct tape covered the tears in the booth seats), and there were a few chandeliers hanging above. Whatever. I'm reviewing the food, not the decor, so I digress. \n\nWe went to the counter and ordered. The only complaint I have is they need to chop chop on the craft of order taking. We waited forever to order from a guy that looked like he was from the 1970s with long, birdsnest-esque hair and a headband...and the line wasn't even that long to begin with. Isn't there such thing as opening another register?\n\nI ordered 2 tacos: one pollo asado and one carne asada--both Nick's Way. This was my first time here, so I had no clue what that meant, except the best way my friend could describe it was \"Remember those amazing gorditas from Taco bell? the one with a soft taco wrapping a crunchy one? Kinda like that...\" And she was correct. The tacos were STUFFED with beans, cheese, guac and meat. Pretty generous with the portions--well it better be for $3.50 per taco with an additional $1 to have it Nick's Way. It's ok. I don't mind spending money when it's freaking delicious.  \n\nAlso ordered the nachos--standard nachos, but they were so good. The chips weren't those thin bull-shit Tostito chips from Safeway. They were thick, slightly greasy, and had an amazing crunch to them. Pile on the guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and cheese and that chip won't fall apart. BIG DEAL. \n\nThis isn't the best Mexican place ever--being that I lived in San Diego for 4 years, so I know what a good dirty taco tastes like, but it's pretty solid. I want to go back and try their other items on the menu--quesadillas, burritos, etc, but I don't mind eating those tacos again--everyday. Yum", "author": "Victoria B."}

The tacos were good, got them Nick's way 4 carne and 2 al pastor tacos split between 3 people. They didn't rock my world but they were good. 3 stars just for that. I also got a quesadilla. 5 Stars just for the most amazing cheese quesadilla of my life! When I'm blue and feeling down I think about that quesadilla and cheer up again. Super thin tortilla with tons of cheese and fried in pig fat and magic or something close to that. Get it! $2 on tuesdays, best choice of my life. \nNow onto the service. This is the part that makes it hard to rate. My group walked in at 6 and unlike most people, you know who you are (and so do your bosses) we can't go online ahead of time to make reservations because we actually work for a living. So there were only 2 tables that people who just walked in could sit at IN AN EMPTY RESTAURANT because all the other tables were \"reserved.\" We finally get a table because this mother and daughter dual, bless them, decide it's too late for them (daughter is like 6 and super cute) and leave the table for us. We now have a table WITH NO CHAIRS, which is another reason why they left. So we asked around at other tables for chairs and this brown haired waitress in all black comes over and starts scolding us like we were 5 for taking chairs away from the other table. Then she complains about it to another guy and he tells her it's fine and just gets more chairs from the back. First off, unless you're cutting my hair at a place charging me $100 per strand or working as a puppet master at some Japanese Kabuki theater, let's try to be a little more creative with what we wear. You're not a ninja and yes I still notice you trying to take away my half full plate that you clearly see me eating from. Second, if you have more chairs and you see tables without any, esp ones with little 5 year old girls out on a fun day with her mommy, GO GET THEM! This isn't the year 3000 where the world just blew up for the 5th time and now cheap metal chairs from Ikea are the new form of currency. Want to make the place standing room only? Get cocktail tables that are tall, not midget tables that rise 2 feet off the ground. \nFinally go to order our food now that the table situation is figured out and of course because of Ink Blot Sally the taco line is super long now. We finally get there and were greeted by the most wonderful man EVER. I want to put him in my packet and take him home! He would make the funniest sassiest comments as I ordered, go just for him and quesadillas. My friend couldn't decide between the cantaloupe or the watermelon juice so the man goes, Half and Half! and fills it with both halfway. Most amazing juice this year!\nFor those of you keeping track, we went +5 stars for food, -100000 stars for Ink Blot Sally and now +100003 stars for the funny, sassy man taking my money.\nThen we get a visit from this other curly brown haired girl dressed in a long gypsy skirt, a brown cardigan and rainbow scarf, like she couldn't decide what she was going to wear today, so just a bit of everything to cover all her bases. Someone should have told her boho chic died a long time ago, along with her customer service skills. She clearly wanted to kick us out, for reasons we can't figure out. We'll go get drinks and she'll whisper something to the bartender every time, we'll finish a basket (they don't believe in plates) and she'll be right there to pick it up. Extremely rude, the bartender is a friend of someone in our group and was clearly upset with her, but now I want to stay for hours JUST to piss her off. \nThe rest of our group comes after work a few hours later and I go out to meet them. I try to get back in the side door that I left through and this Mexican version of \"The Situation\" with less hair and less muscles tells me I need to wait in line at the front. You CLEARLY saw me sitting in front of your counter and you for the last three hours and then saw me leave through the door, so why would I have to go to the front when all I want is my stuff, 2 feet away. So I had to wait in line to get back in to get my stuff and the place's last saving grace was the photo man who had just taken our pic, sees me trying to get back in and lets me and the rest of my group in without trouble.\n\nLong story short, 5 stars for food, but they need a new staff.", "author": "Brian J."}

When I arrived at around 7, the line for ordering tacos was already snaked across Nick's/Rouge and out the door.  Which wouldn't be a terrible thing, only we never seemed to move....which may be true, as there was nothing delineating what was the line and what was just people hanging about.\n\nAfter way too much time in that line, I finally order my chips+salsa+guac and carne asada taco, nick's way.  I get the chips immediately, which are a great deal for $2.  Heck, I would probably pay full price for them!  The chips were thick and had the satisfying crunch of a deep-fried tortilla.  The salsa was cool and refreshing, and the guac was smooth and creamy.\n\nI have no idea how the staff is able to match up orders with the numbers we had.  There is barely any room to walk around in there, yet they somehow found us and gave us our tacos.  For $2 it was a pretty good and very filling taco, but I'm not sure it was worth the wait, nor do I think I would come again to buy at full price.", "author": "Cathy Y."}

What sucks is that if you go on at a busy time like we did, it might take a while to find a table.\n\nWe ordered 2 carne asada tacos, 1 pescado (fried) taco, and 1 shrimp (grilled)  taco, all Nick's way (guacamole and cheese for an extra 95 cents).  I thought we would be able to finish four, but the tacos were so big that we only ended up eating 3 and taking the 4th one home. I was practically full after the first.  The tacos itself were very tasty and they are very generous with the filling.  They seriously do load each taco up with the guacamole.  \n\nWe also got a side of chips with salsa and guacamole.  Loved that the chips were so crispy and they pour the salsa and guacamole all over them.\n\nHappy hour was apparently still going on (8-12) and for $5, you an get a beer (draft) and a shot, or 2 beers if you preferred that.

After being told that there is no place at another restaurant, we looked at our trusty Yelp App, and found out that Nick's Crispy Tacos wasn't too far away. So we decided to try it. It is inside a night club, I think the name was Rouge, but I'm not very sure. We walked in and went up to the Nick's and looked at the menu. Then we ordered and found a place to sit, while my husband went to the bar and got us drinks. I ordered a Elote, which came much after the tacos, I think they had forgotten it, and a Pollo Asado, Nick's way. My husband ordered the Carne Asada and the Pescado, both regular. His fish taco was the best out of all of them, but the other two weren't very far behind. I really liked the addition of the Guacamole and cheese to the tacos. I'd do that to all of them if I could. After about 9:30 however, the lounge started putting away tables to make more standing/ dancing room, and they came up to us and asked us to please vacate the area we were sitting in, as it was about to become the VIP section of the lounge. Luckily, we were almost done, so we finished up and left.  Nick's Crispy Tacos are great.

(Guilty pleasure I guess) The portions are good, the flavors is there, and the texture is definitely a plus. Although, the prices might be a bit high in terms of taco value, it's not really anything I could complain about. However, I have heard that they do have 2$ tacos on Tuesdays from other people that frequent Nick's on a more regular basis. On that note, they've also mentioned that on Tuesdays, it's extremely packed because of all the college students that want a good meal on a budget. \n\nOne thing to watch out for is the seating, since it's a club at night, I would say that they lack the knowledge of how to really run a restaurant. It's self-seating, so once you get in, start looking because there are usually very little open spots and not to mention the people working there probably wont lift a finger to help you. The previous time I was there, we even had to wipe clean our own table. The only time we had any interaction with someone there was when they approached us to let us know that we have 10min left before they close to convert it to the club. \n\nMy favorite there would probably be the crispy fish tacos. \n\nGo there, have some tasty tacos and then leave, because they want you to.", "author": "Frank L."}

Downside, guacamole only covered half the taco since the other half was still covered in the wrapper.  Every bite of my Pescado Taco = a drip of sauce in my basket. Took one bite of my bf's Pollo Taco, Nick's Way. Love that they used white meat, didn't like how chewy and kind of dry it was. Service is good, with a friendly staff. You order up front, pay, take a number, find a seat, get your food delivered to your table, enjoy, and they even bus for you. It'd be nicer if Taco Tuesdays were all day long.

Nick's Way adds the good 'ol fixins to your taco- guacamole, sour cream, & a dash of lime. The grilled fish tacos are just as yummy, too!\n\nEven the drinks are nice & cheap. A few measly dollars for a nice, cold beer or a glass of wine.\n\nI can be in casual gear at your humble abode, just order my tacos at the cashier line, then park my rear at one of your many tables, and I'm good to go. \n\nI can't wait to come back to you when I have the next taco craving!", "author": "Joy A."}

In my past review I stated I woke up early on a saturday to go to a dentist appt. I had no idea that Nicks was not even a block away!!!!!  I was like dayum, imma never reallie in this area, I gotta check it out. I was drawn toward it. As i entered and looked around it didn't seem all that great until I looked over and into the area that is Rouge. Red velvet couches, red curtains, red walls and huge Chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.  \n\nBeing 11 something in the morning and not reallie eating breakfast i was hungry and decided to be a  fat ass. I got one pollo crispy taco and a carne asada burrito. Prices were great the gianormous burrito was only 5.95 and the taco was 3 sumthing. I didn't feel like being stuck inside so as soon as I got my order I decided to find somewhere outside to eat. I walked a bit and found they had opened a Tuttimelon here and there was a park bench outside. PERFECT!! so the taco didn't last very long, it went with in a matter of 2 minutes. The chicken was tender, they had good amount of guacamole and if i had just gotten this I would still be hungree. So imma really glad i got the burrito too. As I started to nom the burrito I noticed that many people were walking by. I love people watching, what better chance then when i was stuffing my face. I am a multitasker that is for sure lols. \n\nThe burrito was huge! yet somehow my fatass finished it x_x The burrito was packed with steak, beans, guacamole, melted cheese, tomatoes, god damn it, imma making myself hungry thinking about it XDDDD.  \n\nI will be back to check out their fish tacos, wasn't in the mood for fish in the morning :3.

I'm always on the hunt for authentic, delicious Mexican food in the city and Nick's Crispy Tacos is NOT it. \n\nWalking in I was pretty horrified by the obvious fact that the location used to be a dance club. It's got red velvet drapes, mirrors covering the walls, and cheesy chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. It did not give off the vibe that it was going to be pricey, instead it gave off the vibe that it was tacky. But whatevers, right? Let's let the food speak for itself. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I ordered the crispy pescado, carnitas, and carne asada tacos. The crispy fish taco was too greasy that you couldn't really taste the fish. The guacamole they have doesn't taste fresh nor like real guacamole. Their carnitas had a lot of fat attached to the meat and also tasted too greasy. Lastly, the carne asada, which I'm always very picky of because I've had the best home cooked carne asada all my life, was tasteless. Where's the seasonings? The lim\u00f3n? The flavor? \n\nI'd heard so many people rave about Nick's Crispy Tacos, and it was definitely the biggest let down. It was simply not good. Why return when you've got the Mission district to go to for good Mexican food (which can also be hit or miss though). \n\nOk, so I hated Nick's and you want to know where to go for a hell of a taco? There is a place. It's a small hole in the wall on 24th street in the Mission that you'll never catch your average Joe walking into. I don't even want to mention the name because this place is such a gem and authentic as can be that if you're loving and grubbing on Nick's Tacos then you kind of don't deserve to know about my secret gem.

Luckily I came across this, oh so lovely, restaurant/lounge. There is usually a line and the seats are scarce, even at the bar, so I suggest that someone from your party grab some instead of everyone waiting in line. I had the fish burrito, which I kept frequently dousing with the green sauce. The burrito was a good size, so needless to say I split it with the bf. From the first bite I wish I had the appetite of my bf, because, well, I didn't want my burrito to be gone. There was the right amount of fish to cabbage ratio, love that! The fish had a great crust - mmmmm crunchy - and the meaty inside was just so tender...melt in your mouth goodness! Adding the green sauce just gives it the extra oomph that you knew you wanted, but would probably get caught up in how great it taste from the beginning. \n\nOh Nick's Crispy Tacos, you best believe I will be back!", "author": "Tyree G."}

Don't be put off by the decorum or atmosphere - after a while, you'll notice that's where part of the charm is.\n\nThese guys make some fantastic quesidillas and burritos. If you get tacos, make sure to get them fried up, it's worth the extra buck or two. Be careful about coming on weekends, especially during football season, as the line can get a bit ridiculous. However, they are incredibly quick, and I've always been amazed at how fast they get my food to me despite the long lines.\n\nThe guys behind the counter have a good sense of humor and are very nice. Only thing that sucks is that they're cash only - but there's an ATM right next to the register, so no big deal. \n\nI've never been here for Rouge, so I can't comment - but for food and beers and good ambiance, you really can't beat Nick's.

The amount of guacamole they piled on the tacos was generous.   The double-shell idea is brilliant... a shell is crispy fried and cheese is melted onto it!   Pescado (fried fish) has too much batter and not much fish so it's a bit disappointing.  Carnitas was not fatty enough, so it tasted a little dry.  But i love the concept of double shell, crispy, and loads of guac on tacos!  The nick's way tacos are about $5-6 each so a bit much for one taco, but they're huge and two is more than enough for one person.  We also had cantalope juice and it was delicious and pulpy!

I knew I wanted the fried fish tacos (Pescado) Nick's way because it's just amazing.  I love the crunch and soft tortilla and their guac is delicious!  I noticed they had a shrimp taco too so I wanted to try that.  We ended up getting 3 fish tacos, a shrimp taco, a carne asada burrito and elote... yes for the 2 of us.. on top of that we got free chips and salsa for checking in on Yelp, and it was a super fresh very tomatoey salsa.

So i was sipping my margarita and was a happy camper, despite the wait.\n\nThe tacos here are huge and worth your money. Get your tacos Nick's way because they add a huge mound of guacamole to it. Also your taco comes with a crispy fried goodness shell and a soft shell with cheese. YUM. I would say 2 tacos and you are would be stuffed. I recommend the fish tacos and the carnitas one. An additional two stars for the food!\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty cool because the place is huge. I recommend coming here if you have a big group because it's more fun that way.

Considering this is more a sports bar than a taquer\u00eda, I was as surprised as you are.\n\nThe positives are many. The meat is fresh, quality and well-spiced. Personally, I preferred the carnitas. They were definitely better than most. The carne asada was only average. Still good, but I wouldn't go here for the carne asada. \n\nThe portion of guacamole is huge and delicious. If you are sick of eating guac that is half tomatoes and want some fresh, avocado-y goodness, this is it. \n\nThe 'Nick's way' tacos are made with a hard shell and a soft tortilla, giving it a great texture. The hard shell is also formed in such a way that you are never in danger of spilling your taco filling all over your lap.\n\nThe ratio of various fillings is great and you get loads of meat. Because of the unique shape of the taco, they are able to stuff more filling into your tacos without causing a disaster. Some people are complaining about the beans, asserting that they are just filler and there are way too many. I'd estimate that there are maybe 20 beans in the entire thing, and they impart a subtle flavor and texture without overpowering the taco. It seems to me they are the opposite of filler. You're not getting a pound of tasteless refried crap here: all fresh and flavorful, just like the rest of their ingredients.\n\nIt fails to get five stars because the price is a little high (you have to get two tacos minimum and that runs you ten dollars already, sans options or drinks), the beer options are anemic (entirely domestic and common imports you'd find on the grocery store shelf) and the Taco Tuesday dollar tacos are so small as to be a worse value than just getting the regular tacos.\n\nStill, highly recommended and I would go here again.

Yes, there was a line to order food (about 15 deep) but it only took 5-10 minutes to get to the front of the line.  We ordered a carne asada taco (nick's way), chips & salsa & a bean burrito.  We took our number and sat down at the bar to wait for our food.  Happy Hour was going on (on a Sat night!) and beers were $2, margaritas (STRONG ones) were $3 - sweet!  Food came over and I was sooooo happy.  Hubby was bummed as they brought out some type of shredded meat burrito - he was really wanting a bean one but didn't feel like waiting for a new one to be whipped up.  Still, he was happy with what he got.\n\nThe place itself is super chill - red velvet walls, crystal chandeliers and big screen TVs playing whatever game is on.  The crowd was 100% 25-35 year olds.  Would LOVE to be able to go there again....", "author": "H G."}

I went with the Fried Fish and Shrimp Tacos Nicks Way. They were amazing, Slathered in Guac with wonderful fresh ingredients. I have no doubt that any of their tacos would kick some serious butt. 2 tacos for about $10 bucks got me almost full, they are bigger than your usual taqueria taco but still 3 would be the ideal amount. \nEven better, free chips and salsa would have done the trick. That did strike a bad chord with me as well. I believe that it is an unalienable right to free chips and salsa at Mexican food spots and they tried to charge $1.25 for them.\n\nAll in all i would say give it a try, and hassle them to give you free chips and salsa.", "author": "Josh B."}

It's a very confusing venue on the corner of a busy street - bar, restaurant, club/lounge ... it's like it can't decide what it wants to be. Moving on...\n\nWe got a ton of food: 4 tacos (1 carne asada nick's way, 1 carnitas nick's way, 1 reg carne asada, 1 pollo asada) and a carne asada burrito.  Let's start with the tacos ... I thought the carnitas nick's way was bomb.  Super juicy and flavorful carnitas and the taco had a great textural combo with the meat, soft/hard taco, cheese, and guac.  The carne asada and pollo asada were let-downs for me.  It was really dry, tough, and plain tasting.  For around $4 a taco, I'm expecting top notch meat and a FAT serving of food.  I can see how people think this place is legit, especially after day drinking and having drunk muchies though.  The burrito was also mediocre.  Same ingredients stuffed into a big flour tortilla.  \n\nI guess it might be worth going back on taco tuesday, but I would not go back during normal hours.  \n\nBottom line: food is mediocre, price is ridiculously high, lines can be insane.", "author": "Phil L."}

I do, and I have come to spread the gospel.\n\nA bad decision is something that SEEMS like a good idea, and then in retrospect was probably an unwise move. For example, say you're AEG Live, the renowned concert promoter, and you've just landed a deal for 50 back-to-back London shows with a superstar and everything is just fine and dandy until said star goes kaput. Now you're fucked.\n\nA poor decision is something that you KNOW is dumb, but you convince yourself otherwise for the sake of adventure or just plain stupidity. For example, you and your husband choose to have cameras invade the everyday lives of you and your eight children, and then you wind up divorcing when fame and the pressure from a lack of privacy siphons off any remaining breathing room you two had left.\n\nEasy enough, right?\n\nThis past Saturday, at the end of a very long bar crawl, I made both a bad decision and a poor decision, although admittedly the overabundance of alcohol contributed to both.\n\nThe poor decision occurred at the Buccaneer when I decided to take a random dixie cup shot of tequila-looking liquid that had been sitting on the bar for at least as long as we had been there. Unsurprisingly, I had to grab a few napkins and make a beeline for the front door. \n\nThe bad decision came a short time thereafter at Nick's. I had been drinking for four hours, that morning I had run ten miles, and I was starving. I'd had their crispy tacos before, and enjoyed them. The amount of guac and cheese would make any Mexican food lover happy. But this was not Taco Tuesday, and no skimpy little taco would do. Super Burrito done crispy style? Fantastic! Everything you love about the tacos, but MORE. After I finished, I decided that it would be a good idea to have a second. And so I did. Two super burritos in the span of half an hour. Delicious, but a 24-hour food coma is never pleasant.\n\nRegardless, whether you're up to no good or you're just a little hungry, Nick's is the place to go. And sure, they may be famous for their tacos, but try their super burrito. If you only have one, it's definitely a smart decision.", "author": "Devon S."}

Back then, I was completely oblivious to good quality fish tacos. I had been eating Rubios at least 2-3 times a month thinking it was the greatest thing on earth. Boy, was I wrong. Now, stepping into another Rubios would be blasphemous to the fish taco gods.\n\nThe scene:\n\nThe decor at Nick's Crispy Taco's is actually unexpected. The hipster-style interior is gaudy red with crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. The restaurants double life consists of a heavenly taco place by day, the trendy nightclub Rouge by night.\n\nThe food:\n\nI only stick to what I know is good here - pescado (fish) tacos \"Nick's Way\" ($5), an elote (corn) and a horchata (rice drink).\n\nPescado Tacos - When you order this, you MUST order it \"Nick's Way,\" which is about $1 more. Trust me, it's completely worth it. \"Nick's Way\" is an extra crispy-fried corn tortilla wrapped with a soft tortilla with jack cheese and guacamole in addition to your choice of filling. These are the best fish taco's I've ever had and any other fish taco I've had since has never come close.\n\nThe pescado taco consists of a layer of cabbage and red onions, Baja-style fried white fish, fresh guacamole, lime mayonnaise, salsa and cilantro. The tacos are enormous, so you can get away with one if you're looking for a light meal. If you like spicy, ask for the habanero sauce. They keep that hidden in the back and it'll add a huge kick to the taco.\n\nElote - I LOVE Mexican corn. I get this any time I'm at a county fair. Mexican corn is grilled corn rubbed any kind of seasoning. This one specifically had butter and topped with Mexican cheese, chili powder and cayanne pepper. It's so rich and creamy, and mucho deliciouso. It really does make this healthy grain/vegetable unhealthy for you.\n\nHorchata - Horchata is a Mexican sweet rice drink flavored with cinnamon and other spices. It pretty much tastes like the left over milk after a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. It's a little chalky, but I still love it.\n\nThe Nick from Nick's Crispy Taco's is actually at Underdogs on Irving now. They pretty much serve the same menu, including the famous fish tacos. I like to go there since it's more convenient for me, but parking is pretty rough during certain times of the day.\n\nI shake my fist at NIck's Crispy Taco's for setting my fish taco standards so high.

Make sure you have a drink handy before trying to devour this treat. The only downside to this experience was the steep pricing of the tacos.

We ate dinner here tonight (I had a quesadilla and it was good) but at the tail-end (no pun intended) of our dining experience, a RAT ran across the floor of the restaurant. Patrons were SCREAMING as this RAT scurried across the dining room floor and ventured up to the booths. A few workers quickly corralled the RAT before it jumped on any patrons and ushered it outside as if it's something they do on a daily basis. A few seconds later, a patron YELLED as another RAT came up from behind her booth and was just a few feet away from her face. In the spirit of being honest, I witnessed the first RAT sprint across the floor but i did not see the second RAT. I only saw the horror on the patron's face and hear the blood-shrilling scream of the pour soul as she came face-to-face with the RODENT. It's unbelievable that I could be at a decent restaurant in the heart of the city and witness RODENTS crawl across the dining room floor. What amazes me even more is that the restaurant CONTINUED TO SERVE INNOCENT PATRONS when they entered the restaurant after the RATS had ran across half the eating area. I have no idea how these RATS got into the restaurant (I REALLY HOPE THEY DIDN'T ENJOY ANY OF THE LIMES I HAD IN MY VODKA TONIC) but this place should be SHUT DOWN until they get this situation figured out.

All the ingredients they use are fresh daily and they have daily specials including fresh made Aqua Fresca in various fabulous flavors. I'm not one to \"pig out\" on many foods, but on a good day I can polish off three of these fabulous tacos regardless of how overstuffed I inevitably will feel afterwards. \n\nPricing is very reasonable here as well. On the days I usually visit this venue (Monday and/or Tuesday) they offer $2 Carne Asadas, $3 Nachos, $3 Taquitos, and of course my favorite, the Pescado Taco Nick's way, which is not lightly stuffed, is only $5.\n\nThe ambiance at Nick's is also very pleasant, despite the rather cheap looking nightclub decor. Nicks is located within Rouge Nightclub so there is a bar you can choose to sit at and indulge in icy cold beverages while chowing down and watching sports on multiple flat screens located around the bar. Marlo always seems to be the bartender on the days I visit Nick's and is very kind and hospitable.

It definitely has all the club decor... plastic-like chandeliers, red walls, velvet-lined booths, and a dirty dirty feel.  I came on a Saturday at around 2 p.m. and there was a line of about 10 people forming to order.  Luckily the food doesn't take too long to come out.  Just grab your number, get situated, and wait!  \n\nI tried 3 tacos all Nick's Way (additional $.95 per taco for jack cheese and guacamole).\n-Carne Asada ($3.25): I would get this again.  The meat was flavorful... not salty, not bland, not dry... just right.  The whole taco itself is just stupendous but a part of me feels like it wouldn't be as good without Nick's Way.  It's worth the extra $.95.  It's good with the red and green sauces on the table although I prefer the red one because it's slightly more spicy.  \n-Carnitas ($3.25): A surprise to find that the pork was moist.  There was definitely more meat in this than in the Carne Asada.  If I came back, I would probably just order one meat taco since they don't stand out too much from each other.\n-Pescado ($3.95): My favorite of the three.  The fish was plentiful and super crispy.  Since the corn tortilla is also crispy, this is just one big crunchy delight to your teeth.  Unlike the other two tacos, this has tomatillo, cabbage, and onions in it.  I'm not sure but I could've sworn I saw some white sauce (kinda like how they make it at Rubio's) but this could have just been the juices all mixed together.\n\nTwo tacos is really all you need.  They are HUGE, filling, and they cost practically $4 per taco!  There's a horseshoe-shaped bar with two flat screen TVs playing sports.  Tap water is free. Cash only.  I'm giving this a 5 because you cannot find a place dedicated to making quality tacos using SF-healthy ingredients.  My only suggestion is to make the bottled sauces on the table spicier unless they are going for that refreshing sauce taste.", "author": "Shannon L."}

And I can't even say it was because I had high expectations coming in to it. I had no expectations coming in and even then it was a disappointment. The 2 reasons why were:\n\n1. The food - God..really? You thought the Taco's were good? Alright, maybe I went when they were having a bad night but my tacos were disgusting. Seriously, they tasted like they had gone bad.\n\n2. The atmosphere - While I love that I can enjoy high energy like this on a Tuesday night, the place itself is an absolute dump. It's connected to the forgotten yet still around, Rouge. First off they have got to get rid of the cords lining the floors or put mats over them because they kept causing people to trip. Wtf guys? You'd rather keep seeing your patrons almost bite it then fix the problem? Second, the floors are sticky, the place stinks, it's a bar atmosphere with extremely bright lighting, which I'm sure we all love. This is one of those bars you never want to see lit up. When it's dark it seems cool but turn the lights on and it's a big ole mess. For anyone else not thinking back to a regrettable encounter they had when they were young, please take this moment to do so.\n\nOn the plus side, service is quick and the men behind the counter do their job well. I think this place has survived because we don't know what else to do on a Tuesday night.

Here I am in front of Nick's Crispy Tacos on the corner of Broadway & Polk in Russian Hill thinking I am going to be the only person when the place opens.  No such thing - there are 10 people in line @ 1130AM.\n\nSo I ordered a Carne Asada taco and a Grilled Fish taco to go.  The tacos have meat, guacamole, tomatoes, cilantro and onion.   The steak is very tender and delicious, while the grilled fish (served w/ lime slice) was healthy and also delicious.  The veggies are fresh and the amount of guacamole in the taco is humongous - it is out of this world and polished off.  I recommend trying both hot red and green sauces, which are each served in a separate container.\n\nProbably the best thing about the tacos are the taco shell itself.  Normally I do not jump up and down about a taco shell since I always order soft.  But their taco shell is what I would consider a  1/2 soft taco shell.  It has the best of both worlds in hard shell and soft shell.  The shell is lightly fried enough for a slight crisp but still soft enough to fold and give the feeling of a soft shell taco.\n\nEveryone is right about this place - try Nick's Crispy Tacos for yourself.", "author": "Janet H."}

My own fault.\n\nThird, I have been on about a month long search for decent (would prefer great) fish tacos - still have yet to find them, but alas, someday I will.  However, Nick's is not the place for fish, definitely, definitely not. No.  No.  No.\n\nFourth, and almost most important - I've never been here before, but this isn't an excuse: If you are going to call your restaurant, \"Crispy Tacos\" - the tacos themselves better come crispy.  Si, por que, no.  They didn't - the tacos at Nick's aren't crispy tacos unless you ask for them crispy.  W.T.F?  Your restaurant is called, \"Nick's Crispy Tacos\" but I have to ask for my tacos crispy?  Umm, okay, I can see the rational behind that - actually, I can't. at all.\n\nSo, my grilled fish and camarones tacos (I like mixing it up) were soft and dry - not crispy, like the name of the restaurant indicated.  The tortillas they did come in were tasteless and I'm relatively sure, store bought from the Walgreen's adjacent.  Tia Rosa much?\n\nI couldn't even eat my tacos - they were so thick with dry, pasty tortilla that they reminded me of cardboard, no - newspaper, yeah newspaper.  I got a total of three shrimp, which is the only thing I ended up eating.  They had no special sauces for their grilled fish and I'm pretty positive that their grilled fish came right out of a Long John Silver's frozen dinner.  Bitchezzzzz.\n\nThis place is a rip-off, I'm really glad I wasted money.  At least I rolled by during happy hour so I could drink my dinner instead.  Which I have to add, the margaritas were good.

AND, even when it's not that crowded, it appears as though it is because the space is designed to crowd people into small spaces. Anyway, so my point is that the space is SO open that it looks completely vacant and frankly, lame. If I were a passerby outside, I would have walked on by. But, I've heard a lot about this place and because we were going for a work event, I figured it was a great opportunity to give it a try.\n\nSo, the food sucks. I can't testify to their \"crispy tacos\" because I don't eat them, but the burrito I ordered was so bland and blah. And they put way too much pico de gallo and I like pico de gallo. It was so much that the tomato juice was dripping down my burrito and just making it kind of soggy and yucky. \n\nSpeaking of soggy, those lame asses dump salsa and guacamole over their chips so that after literally 10 minutes, all the chips with the unfortunate fate of suffocating in pico de gallo and guac are just shit outta luck.

Instead, you'll get a basket of otherwise delicious chips simply topped with about 2,000 pounds of mediocre pico de gallo.\n\nWhew!\n\nNow that that's out of the way, you can take your finger off the \"kill this guy\" button.\n\nEverything else about my experience at Nick's was kickass. First, the fact that they grill the tortillas, as opposed to steaming them, makes for an automatic win in my book. This is how the place achieves its \"crispy\" distinction.\n\nService during the day, despite a moderate line, was speedy and very friendly, and the food was really, really good. Tara got a carne asada breakfast burrito, served to us at around 3 p.m., and it was one of those rare times when it all comes together -- an item with a large number of ingredients, and somehow, nothing overwhelms anything else.\n\n$3 margaritas (which aren't that good, except for the fact that they're $3) only sweeten the deal.\n\nAnd then, there's the salsa. The red is above-average, only slightly spicy, and not too-roasted-tasting, but just right. The green is among the best of its verde rivals in the city. I recommend applying about a teaspoon to every bite you eat at Nick's, no matter what it is you're eating.\n\nDecor is awesome, from high ceilings and chandeliers to red walls and red horseshoe-shaped booths.\n\nOkay, can I come out from under the table now?", "author": "Jeff H."}

I am a taco snob.\n\nI ordered a chicken taco & a carne asada taco, both \"Nick's Way,\" which means, of course, that they come adorned with jack cheese, guacamole, and two corn tortillas--one of which has been gently fried in oil to make it a crispy, oily little treat.  My companion got two carnitas tacos, also a la Nick.  \n\nNow, overall, these were extremely well-made tacos.  For one, anywhere that gives me generous globs of guacamole (even though you had to pay extra for it, as is standard) is going to make me a happy eater.  Plus, they were pretty--a bright slash of green right down the middle, and a neat paper wrapper around each of them, to make the hand-to-mouth transfer that much smoother.  \n\nAs with any taco, however, the devil is in the details.  Can you taste the lime juice-cilantro-salt orgy when you bite into your carne asada?  Does the rich, assaultive taste of lard come through when you hit a bite full of pinto beans?  Is the pico de gallo fresh and summery, or has an unripe, mealy tomato entered the scene?\n\nMy Nick's Crispy Tacos passed each of these tests--except, surprisingly, the carne asada test.  The meat was clearly of high quality, and certainly wasn't overcooked--but I had to keep resorting to the (lovely) salsa verde to give the thing a little kick.  And, being somewhat of a purist, I question the use of pinto beans in my taco--I mean, really.  Beans are burrito fare.  We all know this.  \n\nSome things, however, are easily forgiven*--and in this case, the overall end product was so fabulously fresh and well-presented that I know I'll be back.  \n\n(*Unfortunately, the mirrored walls and red velvet booths aren't one of them.)", "author": "Ann M."}

Granted the tacos were big, I still didn't appreciate the aggressive up-sell for \"Nick's Way\" of which I was asked about 4 times total before my transaction was complete.

Those are basic standard taco entities am I wrong?\n\n- $3 beers, $3 margaritas. not bad, not great. definitely not Taco Tuesday worthy. \n\n-Because it gets crowded, late-comers tend to hover around your table, casting intentional glares to make you feel uncomfortable and rushed to get out of there. Even the staff who came around to collect our empty baskets kept asking \"Oh, are you done yet?\" When clearly, my friend and I had a full beer each in front of us trying to enjoy each others company. \n\n-And here's the kicker: When it came time for my friend and I to leave, we needed some foil wrap to take our extra taco home because we had over-ordered. I asked the girl who came around if I could have a to-go bag, she mumbled something about going to the front register as she pointed and walked away, eying our beers to see if we were finally done yet. I go to the front to ask for foil and the guy has the audacity to charge $1 for a piece of foil and a paper bag! To my disgust, I crease my brow, cock my head and insist \"Well, that's pretty cheesy. It's just foil?\" He then tries to explain that because it's \"so cheap\" on Tues everyone over-orders and needs foil...blah blah...they \"barely break even\"...blah blah. By this time, I'm just over the whole thing, go get a $1 and get my damn foil and get the hell outta there. \n\nIF you've ever experienced a Taco Tuesday the way it should be done, i.e. $1 Tacos, $1 drinks, a FUN, non-boring, hum drum crowd, and way better service, you will notice that this is a shame to the name of Taco Tuesdays everywhere.\n\nThis is quite the rant, I understand.

Fine, their prices are higher than Taco Bell, but the quality is a whole 'nother world--I would never put Toxic Hell in my body, would you?  \n\nFor the non-believers and the Yappers, the trick with NCT is to order the right thing.  And there is only one right thing on the food menu.  Pescado tacos, Nick's way.  If you order that, you will not go wrong.  I don't care what anyone says to the contrary.  These things are laced with crack and mighty fine.  Let me explain: piping hot, crispy fried fish laid on a perfect bed of cabbage slaw with Nick's special sauce atop two tortillas the inner one is crispy, the outer soft to catch all the drippings, topped with cheese, and avocado which can be a good or less good interpretation of guacamole.  My only real complaint about these is that they are not spicy enough.  There is hot sauce available on the tables, but I could still use more kick.  I would love the option to add some jalapeno dice to the top but what can you do?  \n\nMy mouth is watering right now.  Good thing I am getting some NCT tonight!", "author": "Emily H."}

If i hadn't been so famished, perhaps my mind would have been more alert to the fact that Nick's is in fact Rouge. Yes, the same Rouge that is known for bad crowds, bad music, and a bad time.\n\nSome things you may notice prior to tasting the food:\n\n-This place smells funky. Too funky to ignore. It's not the smell of food, much less good food. Could be the scent of a poorly ventilated night at Rouge? Oh gosh, I don't want to know.\n\n-The decor paired with the dimly lit dining space kind of grosses me out. It served as a constant reminder that I was eating at a nightclub and a dirty one at that. Had to keep reminding myself to focus: Just Eat. Don't Think.\n\n-The menu ain't cheap. Don't come here expecting the Mission's pricing. Prepare to bring a good wad of cash too. Plastic is not a word spoken here.\n\nBut all of this won't matter, not after you dig in to one of those tacos. I have to admit that I didn't have my taco crispy, but even so, it was still delicious. I had two (grilled fish and chicken) and was pretty stuffed. The rest of my party had just about every taco on the menu (and in every variety that they came in), and they gave big thumbs up to everything that they ordered. That leads me to conclude: crispy or not, nick's way or not, the tacos are top notch. \n\nSo, Nick, you are my new amigo. You alone will keep me coming back no matter how far away I want to be from Rouge.", "author": "Rona J."}

You flat out lied about my response and furthermore, you never even gave me a chance to fix the situation. So I can't say I really give a damn that you wont be back.\n\nFYI we just won 7X7's readers choice award for best meal in S.F. under $15 ...\"\n\nA)  Thanks for calling me a liar.  Why would I lie?  There's no reason.  We told you because we thought you should know that we've noticed a decline in quality and service.  We weren't asking for a freebie or anything.  We just wanted to let you know that we noticed.  I know if I were running a business I would want to know if my long time customers weren't happy so I could work to rectify the situation to keep them coming back.  But apparently you don't give a damn.\n\nB)  Nick's Crispy Tacos should really think about starting a PR firm.  This was handled so well.  I can totally picture how you would have handled something like the Exxon Valdez incident.  \"You flat out lied that this ship dumped all this oil in to the ocean.  I can't say I really give a damn about this environmental catastrophe that is going to stain the earth for many many years to come.  By the way, what are you going to do with all these dead fish?  I've got this little taco stand in SF that might be interested in taking them off your hands...\"\n\nC)  Congratulations on your 7X7 award.  Apparently you're very proud of it since you took the time to inform me about it in your lovely message.  Keep cutting corners and treating your customers like crap and your little award will be short lived.  \n\n1 star- wish I could give negative ones.\n(end edit)\n\nWe've  been going there since it opened and I have to say it's not even as good now as it used to be.  Not sure what happened but we used to love this place.  We stopped going for a while because I got sick from a fish taco.  Decided to give it another try and my wife found egg shell in her breakfast burrito and the potatoes tasted like they were two days old.  When we brought it to the attention of the server, he was indifferent and actually asked if we wanted to wrap it up to take home.  \"Yes sir!  I would love to take your crappy burrito home to eat later.\"  We weren't looking for a freebie or anything but having been in the food service industry, I know that the right thing to do is to offer to either replace or comp the item.  We told Pete, the manager, and he said \"No body else seems to be complaining.\"  Nice response Pete.\n\nThe lady from table next to us ordered a soft drink with no ice.  They served her drink a little less than 3/4 full.  When she asked to have it filled up, they said they would not do it because that's how much drink would be in it if she had ice.  What's the difference to them between a full drink and a 3/4 drink?  Something like five cents????  Most places have bottomless drinks these days and they are worrying about the difference between a cup with ice and one with no ice?  Lame.\n\nDefinitely not going back which is too bad because we live so close and I loves me a good taco.  They used to have them, but not anymore and their customer service stinks.  Seems like they are more concerned with cutting corners these days than keeping the customer happy.  Used to be 5 stars, now I'm having hesitations about even giving them 2.", "author": "Marc H."}

Right when I thought I would never move to SF because of the lack of drive thru's I came upon a vibrant looking Nicks Crispy Tacos, conveniently located next to an open parking meter space. Being quite a fan of tacos and fish tacos in general I had high hopes for something glorious from the bay. I ordered a battered fish taco resting in a burrito blanket, filled with tangy baja style sauce, lettuce, tomato, and a heaping scoop of fresh guacamole on top all nicely cradled in a crispy taco shell on the outside. It was delicious and I was definitely impressed. My taco came out to be somewhere around $6.00, quite a bit more than your usual taco at \"Baja Fresh\" or the like down in LA or OC, but I would say it was worth the price all the way because it was a large size portion. I will definitely come back here again, perhaps taco Tuesday.

I found the carne asada tough but the pollo was super yummy and juicy. For a non-alcoholic drink alternative, skip out on the horchata (thick tasting yet diluted flavor at the same time) and go for the lime juice instead. \n\nIf you're ever in the mood for tacos on a Tuesday, go here rather than Blue Light. The line may be long but it goes by rather fast (and the food comes to you quickly), it's not as cramped and not as loud as BL. Yes, atmosphere is funky but I guess we don't always need to eat tacos in places with pinatas and rainbow colored paper hanging from the ceiling. ;-)", "author": "Annie W."}

Tacos range in price from about $3-4 per taco and they're very generous with the fillings. THIS is what people who aren't in California are missing.\n\nI've tried the carne asada (Nick's way -with guacamole and jack cheese- is best on those) and the pescado. Both have been excellent every time. Plus, the salsa squeeze bottles on the table are actually complementary to your taco and totally delicious. The only reason I can't give Nick's 5 stars is because Tacubaya in Berkeley still makes a better fish taco. Nevertheless, I love it here.\n\nAlso, chips and salsa are around $1.25 or something, which I greatly respect. You know they could charge anywhere up to 4-5 dollars without getting flak, but they don't because we all know so many places just rip you off when they charge for chips. My only real gripe about Nick's is that it was super crowded last time we came here... the seating arrangement is weird. Our food arrived and we didn't even have a table yet.

Let me count the ways...\n\n1.  The Food\nNick's: delicious everything.  the quesadilla is the best i've had, possibly ever.  usually went with the cheese, recently tried the chicken -- bad call, the pollo was dry and there was hardly any cheese.  but the cheese quesadilla...mmmmm melty cheesy goodness.\nBluelight: remember \"Taco Day\" you had at your middle school cafeteria on wednesdays?  yeah, their tacos are reminiscent of that.  slapped together, usually soggy, and overly salsa-ed.\n\n2.  The Service\nNick's: you line up, pay [cash only], get a number, [hopefully] find a seat, and wait.  i've waited from 2 - 15 minutes for the food to arrive, depending on how busy it is.\nBluelight: you try to find/flag down the waitresses that are umbrageously dressed like you and i, give your order, and hope for the best.  you wait for about 20 minutes and once the waitress machetes her way through the crowd, they [usually - 80% of the time] give you your food; how they remember who ordered what is beyond me.\n\n3.  The Beer Selection\nNick's: Corona and Corona Light for $2 [but you have to go to the bar bar for the Corona Light's]\nBluelight: Just Corona for $2\n\n4.  The Prices\nNick's: Tacos/quesadillas/chips+salsa+guacamole are $2, and are worth every one of the 200 pennies.\nBluelight: Tacos are $2, and worth about 70 Abe Lincoln's.\n\n5.  The Scene\nNick's: pretty menagerie, hailing from most every nook of the city.\nBluelight: douchebaggery at its finest [which is coincidentally also at its worst].  i once saw a guy here push a girl aside [and almost over] who he loudly proclaimed was not pretty enough to be in there.  so terrible.\n\nIn short, if you love sub-par food and shallow rock and republic-rocking company then by all means, Bluelight is all yours.  But if you are into tasty treats and fun(ner) people, then I'll see you at Nick's on Tuesday :)", "author": "Kat S."}

I've never even tried the crispy tacos here.  I find them too confounding to even order.  I typically stick with the carne asada burrito, which is stuffed with enough meat and beans to send shockwaves through your digestive tract.  To this you may add cheese, sour cream, and/or guac, if you dare.  \n\nTake a seat inside at the simple tables and frail chairs, surrounded by the red velvet draperies and faux crystal chandeliers of the doppelganger nightclub.

I am a dedicated follower, proponent, and researcher of good San Francisco style American-Mex food, and this place currently has the crown for me.

The Pescado is my favorite, for instance, and it comes with a piece of fried fish/awesome guac/cheese/sourcream/and cabbage.  Exemplary mofo taco.  I am full right now and am still salivating. The vegetarian is another favorite of mine, it comes 'Nick's way' standard.\n\nThis place is actually in Rouge, a night club in Russian hill that doubles as Nick's during the day and then converts at 10 or so.

I'm sad to report that all the ones I went to are mediocre or worse.  The loser in the competition was me for spending time and money at each.  The winner was any establishment at which I spent money.\n\nSomehow I thought I stumbled into a time machine and now I had ended  up getting tacos at some club in Miami circa 1974.  I expected Scarface to walk in any minute and mow down the line of people at the bar.  \n\nIf you can get over the kind of weird decor, I found Nick's to easily have the best tacos of the places I went.  They were more like small delicious fried meaty pitas than tacos, but given the price and size of the tacos I couldn't complain.  The beer situation was a little annoying, since half the beers were like $2 but then the other beers were regular price but then you couldn't get both in the same spot so then you had to walk from the little counter to the bar to order beers and meanwhile everyone is staring at your chair as hungrily as you are staring at your tacos.\n\nThe experience is ok.  I really wish this place was open later since a few Coronas definitely greases the wheels for some tequila and then next thing you know it's Wednesday morning.  The cheap chairs and tables seem like they were stolen from someone's yard.  I guess they wanted to  make sure no one hangs around too long.  This place ends up getting so crowded people end up sitting on the stairs (or anywhere they can put a buttcheek) and the joint ends up looking like a Thai bus stop.  The bathroom also looks like some too tiny room that was rented to a junkie and then once the owners kicked him out they noticed how really small it was and turned it into a bathroom.\n\nIn summary:  Good tacos, good prices, crappy venue.  Best recommended for if you come early, order a boatload of tacos, eat them fast and go.", "author": "Steven R."}

The \"crispy style\" is actually deep frying one of the two soft taco shells (the inside one), and although I was initially skeptical of such a blatant disregard for such a cultural food item such as the taco the result actually tasted really frickin good.\nOkay, so I don't have anything bad to say about Nick's, but definitely some notes to help you out.  First off the line for the tacos can get pretty long and also moves comically slow, why?  I think the guy taking orders may have been the most stoned person in SF on the particular day that I visited....if he wasn't then he has no excuse for taking forever and a minute to write down orders.  Second, finding a table was a bit of a challenge, so if you are with a group send one person to lay claim to a spot while the rest of the party wait in the never ending taco line.", "author": "Kenneth H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-03-02", "description": "I've been to Nick's a few times. Until the last time, I'd eaten nothing but tacos, plus chips and salsa. This last time, I decided to try something different. The menu on the wall, after all, devotes just about as much space to burritos as tacos, so I decided to try my first Nick's burrito. I'm sorry to say that despite my affection for a Nick's taco, this burrito was the worst I have ever had in San Francisco in memory. I do not say this lightly-- this was an effort not quite worthy of the distinguished appellation \"burrito.\" But, it wasn't all Nick's fault ...\n\nMy first mistake might have been going for a burrito at a place with \"Tacos\" in the name, but again, almost half the menu is burritos, so it's fair game. My second mistake was ordering the grilled fish burrito. Fish is tricky to do in a burrito, at best, though some places-- La Corneta, for example-- handle it with ease. It's hard, but not impossible. My favorite version of Nick's tacos are those with grilled and fried fish; for a burrito, I thought the grilled fish was a better choice. My third mistake was assuming that this burrito didn't come with tomatoes-- not salsa, not pico de gallo, just chopped tomatoes, thrown in. I'm not a huge fan of the tomatoes. The menu didn't list them, I didn't expect them, but there they were.\n\nBut even with my mistakes, their were problems on Nick's end. Despite my best efforts to squeeze out the accompanying limes, and my vain use of not one, not two, but three types of Nick's salsa, this was one flavor-less burrito. The fish tasted about as plain as possible, leaving cabbage as the dominant flavor. Mmmmm, cabbage burrito! The beans were fine, but in this company, it didn't matter. And yet despite the lack of flavor and salsa in the burrito as-served, it was incredibly wet and drippy. Something in this burrito was leaking a fairly clear, nearly flavorless liquid from the start. My attempts to add taste via the lime and salsas didn't help. My guess is the tomatoes or cabbage had too much water on them when they were put in, hard to say.\n\nIn all, this was a bad experience. I'll be back to Nick's Crispy Tacos (note the name is not Nick's Soggy Burritos), but only for the tacos. Making a good burrito, even one with fish, is not something to be taken lightly in this town. I hope they either improve it, or better yet, just take it off the menu. The flavorless fish, the random tomatoes, the dominant cabbage, the drips-- this burrito, sadly, was beyond redemption.\n\nAnd yet, despite this being such a bad burrito, I'm still giving Nick's 2 stars overall- the tacos and salsas are ~4-star-good. I could even see bumping this up to 3 stars after my next crispy taco, but for now, my faith is shaken.", "author": "Daniel M."}

I don't know if they're the most authentic, but when I'm hungry I care less about how \"genuine\" food is and much more about how it tastes. Make sure you order \"Nick's Way\", which will get you a nice dallop of guacamole and an extra crispy shell to go along with the soft one. Also, as a guy that always goes for steak or chicken in about 99% of restaurant situations, I have to say the fish tacos are the best thing you can get here. All of the ingredients and components here are super fresh - even the chips and salsa is a must have for the awesome big tomato chunks and cilantro flakes. Finally, I'd recommend topping anything and everything with the green salsa. Not the spiciest salsa, but incredibly addicting and a nice little acidity to cut through the richness of the food. Oh, as for the other stuff: the burritos are solid but not amazing; the salads are huge and filling and are my second choice if I'm not feeling tacos; and the quesadillas are just okay.  \n\nThe food, as far as taco/Mexican joints go, is probably a solid 8.5/10.

Sure, these are damn good tasty tacos but we are talking different styles altogether.  Nick's are more of a Russian Hilelite I want to appear semi healthy sort of taco, made with all great fresh ingredients and pretty damn tasty.  However, when you want a good mission taco, nothing is going to stand up to one... not even Nick's.  \n\nWith that being said, let's move on and talk about their tortilla soup which I think hasn't gotten nearly enough coverage on the reviews.  Let me describe it for you.... tender white chicken floating in a grease less broth (big plus) and chocked full of tender diced carrots, onions, tomatoes, lots of Nick's fresh tortilla strips and finished off with a hand full of chopped avocado, a lime and cilantro.  This soup is absolutely delicious and consistent.  I would suggest that you get an extra side of chips and keep adding them to the soup as you go.  It makes for one great meal and with the recent rainy days, it sure warms your tummy.   I look forward to the rainy days just to have a bowl.  Definitely a 4 star bowl of soup in my book.  \n\nAnother reviewer mentioned that they were going to bring their own habanero sauce next time.  As a side note, they only have the medium and green salsa on the tables, however, they have the fire behind the counter.  Just ask, they are more than happy to share it with you.  \n\nThe last thing I would like to mention about Nick's is the margarita scene here.  If you want a cheap margarita don't order at the taco counter.  Instead, walk over to the bar and get your 2 dollar margarita.  However, just remember, you are getting a 2 dollar margarita.  So when they pour that fake sweet and sour shit in it, don't whine.   If on the other hand you want a heavy pour margarita made with fresh lime juice, you must order it at the taco counter.  The cost is a little higher than the bar and worth it.  They use Hornitas instead of the cheap shit the bar uses.  (Rouge has the crappiest booze selection I have ever seen).  \n\nSince the lines at the taco counter can get long and you think you might want two margaritas, order them both when you place your taco (or soup) order.  After having a decent margarita, you sure don't want the second one to be from the shitty bar.\n\nI quit drinking -  but damn -  just typing this review sure makes my mouth water.  So do me a favor and next time you go to Nick's try the margarita at the taco counter and have one (preferably two,three) for me.  :p  \n\nTry the soup!!!! too.  :)", "author": "Kathleen K."}

I came here for Taco Tuesdays, and boy, were those tacos good.  Each taco is piled with meat, beans and is pretty much a mess when you try to shove the food in your mouth.  Whatevers, having food all over your face is a small price to pay.\n\nThe place and atmosphere, was not so great.  Because of their $2 taco deal, the whole place is beyond packed.  If you're planning to come here to eat, drink and hang out, you'll probably need someone to camp out for a spot 30 minutes before you even order your food.  Most folks are literally standing against the bar, chowing down on their tacos.  So be prepared.\n\nAnd you're in the mood to drink, I recommend skipping the 2 for $5 margaritas and head straight for the $10 pitcher of beer.  The margaritas come in the small cups bars use for cocktails, and it's filled with the mix.  There's pretty much no alcohol in it.  The $10 pitcher though, totally worth it!", "author": "Maggie L."}

The tortilla soup is OK (too many chunks in it for me; I appreciate the fresh avocado and all, but I want a soup, not a mexican stew) and I haven't tried a burrito yet.\n\nIf this is your first try at Nick's - I definitely recommend trying the tacos \"Nick's Way\".

Nick's puts a nice big piece of fish in the taco, which is what seems to keep bringing everyone back.  What I loved about Nick's is their three salsas.  They have a verde, a red and habanero.  The verde and the red taste great and are medium spiciness.  The Habanero is a tearjerker.  It's really tasty but it's fuckin' hot.  I was ballin' by the end of the meal.  If you mix the three of them together and splash a lime wedge or two into the taco you get the tastiest result.

It's the signature. Otherwise, you might as well go elsewhere. That being said, the guacamole is so scrumptious that it kind of suffocates the taco. \n\nThe first time I went here, the pescado (fried fish) was the way to go. But I find myself preferring the non-fried one at this point. I wouldn't go with the pork (way too sweet) - it reminds you how much the carnitas at the humble taco truck down the street still wipes the floor with the american version.\n\nThe decor is a bit jarring the first time around. Parking has always been awful and finding a seat is even worse, particularly during the post-dinner pre-clubbing rush. The experience of eyeing tables while waiting in line is already uncomfortable as is the nomadic existence I find myself leading while clutching my number and waiting for seats. What makes it far worse, however, is the high ratio of inebriated douchebags lording over empty glasses and trays while they leer at the fairer sex... if only fewer girls would return those glances, I might not have to always eat my food standing up.", "author": "R L."}

It was a pretty good sign when we found a parking spot right across the street from Nick's. \n\nI had the carne asada burrito with all the works--cheese, rice, guac, sour cream--and a lime aqua fresca. The girlfriend had a fish taco, a carnitas taco--both Nick's Way-- and a margarita. My meal was a little better than average, I've had better burritos and a lot more worse ones in my lifetime. The aqua fresca also wasn't all that special. Granted, that's what I get for ordering against what the name of the place is. The bite I had of the carnitas taco was very good. It's the way the shells were done that made it. I've always had a thing for double-decker Tacos from Taco Bell, and that's what this was only with pork and ingredients that are better to the nth degree.\n\nThe decor is what made this place though. It was way cool spending $25 on a meal for two people and eating it in something that looked like you were stepping into a Swinging 60s sort of bar.\n\nYou'll find better burritos in the Mission.

Trying to avoid another stain disaster, a couple friends and I found a spot standing at the bar. The bartender told us we couldn't have food at the bar and that we had to go sit at a table or booth...which was absurd because half the booths were filled with people only drinking.

I prefer the excelsior for my burrito and taco fix usually, but I digress......\n\nAnyway stumbled into this place as was in the neighborhood looking at apartments.  I didn't really like the apartment I'd checked out, but eating here, I was thinking \"but if I rented that place I could hang out here a lot\", it kind of made me think more highly of the apt than I really did.  Anyway, I'd been out of town for a few months for work, and this was my first day back.  I wanted mexican food, obviously!  I walked in and it looked totally cool, red velvet booths, a full bar in the middle, pretty big- not like your average mexican place- all all!! Plus they use nieman ranch meats, line-caught seafood, etc. I like this, as usually at mission and excelsior places I order fish or vegetarian stuff only as I have a serious aversion to dodgy cheap meat on all levels.\n\nI got a grilled fish taco (they also have baja style fried fish ones) with rice and black beans on the side.  It was a little pricier than other neighborhoods (this is to be expected), however the portions of rice and black beans were extremely generous!  The grilled fish taco was yummy, and a lot of fish was given.  Everyone in this place looked happy, and was lounging enjoying it- not like a rush and leave vibe you get at most other mexican places.  You could easily spend many hours here, especially with full bar.\n\nWhere it loses a point for me is that they charge for chips- I mean come on, really? On one hand it is kind of a good thing as you end up not having that super full post-mexican food coma you can get after you scarf an entire basket of chips plus your main meal.  On the other hand it's just kind of cheap and tacky, especially at the prices they charge for their food.  Also, no salsa and condiment bar.  They give you three salsas on your table, but none of them had the wow factor, at all.  Nope, totally average- which in this town should not cut it.  It just doesn't cut it.  They need better salsas, more variety, and a condiment bar with fresh limes, pickled veggies, etc.  My fish taco would have been much happier with several more limes worth of juice.\n\nBut overall dig the place and will come back for some of their specials.", "author": "Carlin S."}

I visited this restaurant today, not knowing that on a Tuesday, you wouldn't be able to sit down anywhere for most of your meal. The place was so packed people that were sitting all over the stairs and anywhere they could find to sit down. It was so crowded, someone even spilled black bean sauce on my friend's purse and she didn't even notice until after she got home.\n\nAnyway, you get into the restaurant and you have to wait in a really long line to order before finding a seat. I finally arrived at the counter and wanted to try the Nick's Way of crispy tacos, which comes with globs of guacamole and jack cheese. The way that the wrap is served is also deep-fried and crispy versus the normal style. I wanted to order it Nick's way, but without the guacamole. I asked twice for this without the guacamole, but the cash register person was so incompetent that he didn't get that I kept saying \"yes, but without the guacamole.\" So my order came out as just a regular taco. \n\nThe taste of the food was just alright. Nothing special. The atmosphere was a good one, but if I ever go back here again, it won't be on a Tuesday.

Though not terribly fond of Mexican cuisine, I thought the food--particularly, the pescado tacos & chips/salsa--was fantastic.  Best tacos I've ever had?  I'd certainly say this place is in the running.  Reasonably priced & especially filling--the boyfriend & I ordered two tacos each, totaling ~$20, and were more than satisfied with the meal.  \n\nThe atmosphere resembles, as others have pointed out, what one might expect from a scene dedicated to delivering lively nightlife.  Appearing to be a small joint from the outside, the interior is actually quite spacious, with brilliant red walls and dangling chandeliers.  Apple red booths surround the outskirts of the place, with movable tables and chairs everywhere else.  During our visit (a Saturday night), the place was bustling with a line nearly out the door.  The restaurant blasted loud dance music, and restaurant-goers were, sometimes drunkenly, swaying their hips to the music as they made their way across the room to their tables.  Though hardly conducive for a nice conversation, the atmosphere was fun and, needless to say, social.  The cashiers and servers were friendly and efficient, taking orders for drinks as we stood in line waiting to order and pay for food at the bar (orders are only taken at the bar; utensils, water, etc. is self-serve, though they bring you the food via an assigned number).\n\nI'd visit this joint again just for their pescado tacos.  I didn't try \"Nick's Way\" and opted for the default soft shell--but that seemed to be fine enough for me.", "author": "Joanna K."}

I work close to Nicks tacos and so I go there from time to time for lunch.  Overall, the food is pretty good.  The fish tacos are done well and the tacos \"Nicks way\"  are also pretty good  with generous amounts of guac and carne.  \n\nThere are a few problems with the place.  First, the food is overpriced.  You are definitely paying a lot more for the tacos than most joints in the Mission.  (Basically you are paying La Taqueria prices, but La Taqueria can get away with those prices because they are truly fabulous.)  Second, the space sucks.  Nick's tacos uses a night club (rouge) so the space is too big and the ambiance is way off.  And third, they only accept cash.  Lame.

I'll be that girl.\n\nNick's Crispy aren't really that crispy. Nor are they that tasty. If they were my student, I'd give them a B- and ask them to try harder next time, to add a bit of creativity, to spice it up. Nick's Way - which everyone raves about - doesn't really add that much except for an unbalanced salsa (I say unbalanced because any salsa that has more onions than tomatoes really needs to find its \"center\" point) and some (dare I say it?) tasteless cheese. Sure, they give you two shells (one supposedly crispy, but usually moreso soggy) but all it does is make it harder to get into the real prize, the meat concoction inside.\n\nWhile we're on that topic, I have a suggestion for the fine folks there (note that I'm not being sarcastic; the staff is truly hard-working and friendly) - work on your carnitas. The pork is dry, flavorless and - forgive me for this - flaccid. \n\nGross, right?\n\nDon't get me started on their quesadillas. Just avoid them. You'll thank me.\n\nBut I remain hopeful - they've recently introduced breakfast burritos that negate most of what I said above...they're flavorful, fresh, and have the right combination of meat vs. egg vs. salsa. YUM. \n\nNow if they continue to make improvements in a similar vein, I'll change my story and start singing Nick's tune again. In the meantime, I'll venture over to their new neighbor, Escape from New York Pizza, and get a satisfying meal. Sorry, Nick, we're on a break.", "author": "Aubrey S."}

The bottom line is that while the burrito is inauthentic in concept, the San Diego version that comes loaded with greasy meat, guacamole, and salsa is the champion of the $3 bracket.  No rice, beans, or lettuce necessary.  Sometimes your carne asada will be 60% fat and cartilage, but it doesn't matter.  As much as I love San Francisco, I cannot vouch for anything in the Mission that matches this late-night, drunken college student's salvation.\n\nHere's the thing... there's also a step up in quality, where you can expect higher-quality meat, devoid of bones & joints, and possibly some vegetable content for $6-7.  I don't not deserve yuppie classification for enjoying this level of \"Mexican\" food.  Rather, think of it as an entirely separate genre of culinary delight... does anyone say, \"Fuck The French Laundry because Thomas Keller doesn't cook chicken like fucking KFC\"?  No.  Maybe you're the racist for suggesting that Mexican food can't be good unless they charge less than $5.  What do you think about that?!\n\nWhere am I going with this?  Oh yeah... upon moving to SF, I didn't really have a favorite taco/burrito spot for a long time.

Nothing spectacular to separate it from other Mexican food though. I had a Pollo Asada burrito and a pal had the Pollo quesadilla. The quesadilla was not what I was expecting. It was 2 very thick pieces. Tasty all around though.\n\nThe service was pretty quick as well. The line was pretty sizable yet it moved along pretty steadily and once my order was placed the food was up in a jiffy.

My next tip would be to order two. You think one will be enough but it is never enough and the line will be a 30 minute wait when you turn to get another. 2 for $5 Coronas and $3 margaritas are the perfect companions to the tacos. \n\nOne thing to note is that Taco Tuesday gets WAY crowded. Get in before 6 if you don't want to battle it out for a table. You can stand and eat but it is dangerous since there is a high chance your knees will get weak when you take your first bite.

Its totally related to the fact that they mess up my order just as frequently as they don't.  The other food items are great, but I only want one thing from them.  When I don't get it, I'm sad.  They are so packed most of the time, I just deal with it.  The crowds are probably what screw them up a bit.

Though of course if you want it Nick's way (which to me is the only way) with a massive amount of guac and melty cheese inside it costs you a little extra..but is so worth it.\nThat and a chips special to split ($2 chips and guac) makes my Tuesday nights.\n\nOnly issue is that over time, this place has gotten so crowded! There were several weeks where we had to stand and eat our food. And the people eating there are so rude!! Tables full of guys who finished eating and just sitting around and chatting while girls try to eat their tacos standing... spilling out chunks of meat on the floor with a basket of chips in the other hand, while they sit and digest? Can't they do that standing at the bar or better....at home? There's only so many tables, please, be courteous, I'd do it for you. (either that or they need signs up that during busy hours to not hog tables!) So with that...it's best to arrive early and if you do, be kind to the new fellow taco eaters who would like to seat and enjoy their taco....Nick's way.\n\n\n*edit* went on another night besides Tuesday. I couldn't believe I paid $4.25 for one taco! Tuesday night (though its probably crowded enough) is the only night worth going. Unless you are really craving it....", "author": "Whitney F."}

First, I must mention that I feel awful for not ordering Nick's Crispy Tacos, despite being intrigued by the name. But somehow I could not bring myself to purchase a $4+ taco. Instead, I ordered a carne asada burrito with sour cream, guac, and cheese, which was  rather tasty and almost bordered on the \"wet\" style. \n\nThe on-the-spot reviews of Nick's Crispy Tacos from my colleagues were positive. The pescado (fish fried in batter) tacos were huge and pretty good, according to one colleague. She ordered two but said one was enough for lunch. Another ordered the carne asada tacos, Nick's way, and said they were rather awesome. \n\nI'll definitely return to Nick's, next time for Tacos Nick's way, possibly on a tuesday to take advantage of $2 tacos. As for the other aspects of the restaurant, service was very friendly and efficient (the girl taking orders was rather attractive too, and that always helps). We also seemed to beat the lunch crowd, so perhaps the experience could be different when the place gets hectic. Also, one negative thing to mention was that from the moment I walked in all I could smell was whiskey, as if a wild party-til-morning in the name of Mr. Daniels spilled over to the 11:30 opening time.", "author": "Jonathan L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-28", "description": "When it comes to tacos, burritos & all things Mexican food, Nick is not a traditionalist. That said, I've set up some rules.\n\nRULES FOR NICK'S CRISPY TACOS:\n1. You must pretend that you've never eaten burritos in the Mission. Matter of fact, pretend you've never even been to or heard of the Mission.\n2. You must overlook the fact that you will likely be called 'bro', 'chief', or 'boss' by someone either while waiting in line or while ordering at the counter.\n3. You must not dwell on the deep red colored walls, round velvet booths, or sticky dance floor (this place morphs into a striped-shirt w/the collar popped wearing b&t-crowd on weekends).\n4. You must let Nick do his thing here. This can be accomplished by allowing them to make your food \"Nick's Way\".\n5. If you are eating in-house, really focus in...concentrate on the eating. If you are taking your meal elsewhere, shoot for a quiet place & someplace close. I will stress again that it must be close. Walking long distances with a bag full of goodness hitting your nostrils is dangerous, & you don't want to be that person sitting cross-legged on the sidewalk scarfing down food in public. That is indecent.\n\nIf you follow these instructions, Nick's is an almost perfect non-Mexican taco/burrito experience. When the place is almost empty (ie. early), it's quite possibly the best cheap meal in Russian Hill. The fish tacos (Nick's way, of course) are highly recommended.\n\nIt's one of the few places in town where I'm willing to tolerate a quick blast of extreme broishness.", "author": "Pete J."}

My sister complained about her iced tea....  it went to worst quickly. The carnitas taco I ordered was warm, and the meat was either microwaved too long to heat it up, or just plain over-cooked; it was terrible and with or without sauce, the stringy meat had NO flavor, no taste and no substance. The beans were cold - the menu states: BRAiSED shredded pork...  well, if this was braised perhaps they used an oven that resembled the engine of a Ford? The bean & cheese burrito my sister had was steamed - so she says - and had no flavor also. However, on the one tiny good point, the poppers she ordered was steaming hot out of the deep fryer and she liked that! YUCK. As I waited for sis to finish her \"food\", I watched as two guys at the bar tried to order but couldn't attract the attention of the gal, too busy chatting with a friend and laughing so much she couldn't hear these two guys calling her from 10feet away. \n\nThe place reeks of a Las Vegas nightclub nightmare, and is the first place I've ever seen in my life with red carpeting on the ceiling.

As a SoCal transplant, I like my taco shells crispy and I'm fine with a bit of vegetation inside my taco or burrito.  Having gone out of my way to give it a try, it's with regret that I must say it wasn't worth the time or energy to do so.  \n\nThis isn't to say I wouldn't go back.  The carne asada from Niman Ranch is of high-quality and rather flavorful, and the crispy taco shell appears to be homemade.  The guacamole and pico de gallo were a bit lacking in spice, but easily spruced up with the available hot sauces on the tables.  My only real complaint about the taco is the fact that the crispy shell wasn't all that crispy by the time the food hit my table, but that's a minor thing for me.  Overall, the tacos get a 3, and they'd get a 4 if they weren't $3.95 each.\n\nI did appreciate the fact that they have rotating flavors of aqua fresca (last night's were mango and watermelon) and access to a full bar.  Not many taquerias can boast a full bar, and it's nice to enjoy a margarita with a taco.  Customer service was a little bit slow, but friendly - I did have to ask for the soda I ordered as they didn't bring it over with the food, but it happens.  \n\nMy main disappointment was the burrito.  I recognize that these are my own tastebuds talking here as there wasn't anything technically wrong with the burrito, and it did come as advertised, although...did cabbage have to mean red cabbage?!?  Seriously, red cabbage?  The menu mentioned there was cabbage in the vegetarian burrito, and I was genuinely looking forward to the textures and the potential interminglings of guac, cabbage and sour cream.   But not red cabbage!!!  I happen to love red cabbage, but it's a lot denser than regular cabbage and has a different flavor.  I'm willing to bet it would have been better in a fish taco, but I don't like fish so...oh, and, er, parsley.  Waaay too much parsley.  The parsley to cilantro ratio should have been a lot smaller if it had to be in there at all.  Yes, they're related plants, but they taste as different as well, red and green cabbage.   Neither the parsley nor the red cabbage belonged in that burrito.\n\nI'll gladly sip a margarita, munch on a crispy taco, some chips (those look homemade too) and give the quesadilla a try the next time I'm in the area.  However, I'm not making a special trip and I'm staying the hell away from their vegetarian burrito.  \n\n2.5 stars.", "author": "Sus... B."}

Other good lunch/dinner options include carne asada quesadillas, chips & salsa for $1, and (surprisingly) corn on the cob loaded with spices.  I've also started getting their enormous breakfast burritos or quesadillas on Sat & Sun (11:30a-3p), which are awesome.

After a good hour of research on Yelp, I decided on La Mexicana.  But when I arrived it was closed!\n\nSo, of course, I had to have Mexican food.  Not wanting to head back to my lonely apartment to scout out another place on Yelp, I tried to backtrack to a Mexican restaurant I'd passed by the night before when going to Sushi with my brother.  After I marveled at the funny name and strange interior my brother informed me that some consider Nick's Crispy Tacos to be the best Mexican food in the city!\n\nAfter the disappointment of La Mexicana, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a delicious, and crispy, taco.  But the taco was not crispy!  It was soggy and oil-drenched.  The soft tortilla seemed to serve only as a container for all of the grease.  Yuck!  I thought Boston Mexican food was bad, but the bland, slimy mess that is Nick's crispy taco is even worse.\n\nMaybe it was the anticipation that made my dining experience so bad.  Maybe it was the realization halfway into my taco that I'd been there 12 hours earlier (unhappily) when it was Rouge.\n\nWhich leads me to my other big problem with Nick's.  I think a nightclub/Mexican Restaurant is a cool concept except I hate Rouge.  I hate the mirrored columns, the millions of chandeliers, the plush velvet booths.  I can tolerate mediocre food, but the decor of Nick's is even harder for me to swallow than the food.\n\nI would go back to Nick's if I had to, but I will never go back to Rouge.

So I shell out the extra $1 to get it \"Nick's Style\".  And the \"crispy\" shell that I paid $1 more for was not even crispy despite looking like a hard shell.  I'm sure it WAS... but since it tasted like it was fried that morning and left out all day, it just lazily gave in as I bit in, as opposed to exploding in greasy goodness.  I know you're thinking, \"but the juicy piles of fatty meat probably soaked in, therefore rendering the crispy shell un-crispy.\"  To that I reply, \"NO.\"  You see, the low quality carnitas and carne asada that was pre-cooked was also hella dry, so there was no possible way it soaked in (pollo asado was better).  The dab of guacamole was underwhelming.  Time to change up the style, Nick.\n\n     Also, I need three tacos, so that's $9 for 3 tacos that still aren't crispy and don't do that much for me.  For $6, I can go anywhere and get the same volume of Mexican ingredients (tortilla, rice, beans, meat) and be full (and said ingredients would be put together HOT, not premade and piled on).\n                                                           Sincereley, J", "author": "Joey S."}

The space is amazing and spread out with a full bar and cozy plush booths to kick back in. \nNow the tacos - whoa, like whoa! First off, they are HUGE, I would suggest starting with one. The chips and salsa cost, which is redonk, but they give you a good portion covered in a yummy salsa. One basket kept 3 of us busy while we waited on our tacos. And there are two different sauces at every table. As a person who loves condiments, that's right I said it, I loved adding the extra sauces to things throughout the meal. \nYou do have to order at the counter, but they are quick and bring it to your table when it's ready. I ordered a baja fish and a grilled fish taco. The baha crispy taco was so damn good! The batter was not too overwhelming, perfectly crispy and the piece of fish itself must have given the fisherman an issue! I usually prefer the grilled fish tacos, but in this case I have to vote for the crispy. I finished that one off and only got halfway through the grilled version. Order any of them \"Nick's Way\" and you will get a bucket of guac and cheese on top. \nOne of my friends ordered the nacho plate and it did not come with beans or rice = downer. But she ordered both on the side and the portions were enough to feed 4! \nOverall, the baja fish tacos were fantastic - it's no Rosarita street version, but it will more than suffice when one can't jaunt on down to the border.

It did not compliment the fish AT ALL.\n-The lime mayonnaise and the veggies in the taco are wayyyy too overpowering - too much lime flavor! \n-The fish was flavorless... It looked good but it didn't impress. The meat was dry and the batter was tasteless.\n-The chicken taquitos... the meat was even drier than the fish. Huge chunks of dry and bland chicken in a too crunchy shell. Horrible.\n-The orchata my friends had tasted like liquid bubble gum. Gross.\n-The agua fresa we had was not sweet enough - it's like they made the juice out of unripened strawberries. \n- anyone ever heard of complimentary chips & salsa? =/ Guess Nick didn't get the memo...\n\nWhat went right...\n\n+The cheesy, spicy corn was A-OK for my friends (I didn't have any since I am not a fan of cheese)... the only enjoyable part of the meal. \n\nMuch better places for tacos...

Everyone else in my group (6 of them who had ordered after me) received their order.\n\nSo I went to ask the lady at the counter what happened.  She just said.. it's not ready yet.  After a couple more tries I found someone who went to check on it for me and said they forgot my order and he will bring it to me.\n\nA few minutes later I received it and bit into it (of course its such a small taco one bite means about half a taco) and realized it wasn't chicken.. it was steak.  And I don't eat beef.  \n\nSo I go back again and tell them that I don't eat beef and that I had ordered chicken.  They seemed very frustrated with me and by that point I wasn't even sure if I was going to get another one.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I did receive my taco but by then everyone else was done so I had the taco packed up.\n\nI can't even comment on the food because by the time I got home it wasn't so \"crispy\" anymore.\n\nI am sure it was tasty.

I use the term \"hellhole \" with consideration 'cause they are some strong co-joined words, but Nick's earns it. Lousy food in a horrid former nightclub. I mean this space was a downer when Memphis Minnie's was here, and although they didn't have great 'que, it was still 'cue and that transcends all environments (see Smitty's in Lockhart Texas). So, my take on this place was that I just had the wrong thing. I work a couple of blocks away and know sane people who go here and like it. So I figured I was just ordering wrong. I was thinking it was like a taqueria, and expecting at least a decent taqueria type experience. So I retried the place ordering what seemed to be a consensus pick. Fish taco. Nick's style, with the extra crap. This meant a fried fast food style tortilla with a unfried industrial style tortilla that apparently was just pulled out of the tortilla bag and wrapped around the fried one (?-why?) and filled with decent fish, and the world's most expensive guacamole ( I think it was 2 bucks for a tablespoon of the precious green substance, but I could be wrong, they might have provided some other \"upgrade\" as well. Whatever it was, 2 tacos and a beer, a couple of bucks in the tip jar, and out about 15 bucks and sitting in what has to be the ugliest eating environment in the city, so 1 star and my own little nickname for the place Nick's crappy tacos.", "author": "James T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-13", "description": "\"Uh... isn't this Rouge?\" Apparently best known among friends as a nightclub, I surprised them with Rouge's day job transformation--a hipster run taqueria, complete with red walls, plush seating, several chandeliers and one lone sombrero to denote that indeed Mexican fare was served in this night club.\nThis had been on my bookmark list forever since Satyan P. touted another Taco Tuesday place for us to explore and offered this as a challenge to our regular Blue Light hangout. The tacos we got looked exactly like the pictures, but I have to say... the pescado taco? No bueno. Maybe it was just wrong timing but, it was super fried to the point that the fish was not really soft whitefish anymore, but more like dehydrated tuna jerky, ew! Additionally, it is not part of their Taco Tuesday special, which only include carne asada, pollo and carnitas but, my friends, stay within those bounds because those are really the only ones we found worth it! It's $2 per taco, and $5 for 2 Coronas; my advice, get a few carne asada and pollo, and a round of Coronas. You'll probably average the same price as Blue Light, but be better filled; I'd say, average out 2 to 3 tacos, and one $5 set of the beers should satisfy nicely. I think it's worth it to get it Nick's Way on at least one taco, but... not necessary. The guac is fantastic, and for a $1 more it isn't too bad but then... you think about it... $3 a taco? Hmm...\nThat said, I still like Blue Light better, even though there is more space to stand and eat (yup, Nick's is not free from seating issues), and dignified order to Nick's Crispy Tacos (note though, the wait is still pretty long, but since they have a line-ordering system you're safe to know what the approximate time would be to get your taco...). With better pricing at Blue Light, libations seem easier to come by and the nights extended with chaotic life.\nAll in all, it was okay, and for a group of Taco Tuesday regulars, it was a better atmosphere and ordering experience. I would say, not overwhelmingly better than Blue Light but not bad either. I would come back but no, I'm not in love. (Think I was really was put off by that fish taco, sigh.). There is one other plus for Nick's: Turn around for seating doesn't seem too bad as the clock ticks towards 8, the reverse effect of Blue Light.\nStill, it's all about having a good time, and I think I'm just not in-sync with Nick's vibe.", "author": "Jessica L."}

At least, thats what I think of when i hear \"crispy taco\". (one of the best crispy tacos i've ever had was in an el torito in tsukuba, japan, but thats a different review).\n\nI ordered a pescado taco and a carne asada nick's way, but the guac just seemed cloying and overly messy. My first two bites of the pescado taco were all fried batter with no fish. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. The carne asada taco was better, with more flavor in the meat and beans, but still not wowing. The fried chips were pretty good, but they cost monies...in my book, tacos and free chips are like steak dinners and free bread. you just expect it. but i have noticed a trend to charge for tortilla chips wherever i go lately...another aside.\n\nthe horchata was sweet and good though. i think after all the hype, i just prefer other fish tacos to this one.", "author": "Jade L."}

Throughout my grade school days I frequented the Mission district quite often, so I know a thing or two about good Mexican food. \n\nSo when my co-worker told me about \"the best tacos ever,\" I was surprised when he said I would find these tacos on Broadway (an area known for other things, if you know what I mean). He told me to try out the Pescado (baja fried fish) Taco, but I had to have it Nick's way (w/ jack cheese & guacamole). And I actually have to give it up to my homie. Why? Because today I ate the most awesome tacos ever. If it's you're first time going to Nick's, I suggest trying out the Pescado. This is the taco that will keep you coming back for more. I also had the carne asada tacos, which were pretty damn good too. I haven't tried the other things on the menu (burritos, quesadillas, etc), but why come to Nick's Crispy Tacos if you are planning to order a burrito.

Instead of a taco shop, I found myself in a restaurant/bar/lounge, courtesy of the Rouge nightclub, which is connected next door. It's really simple: line up, buy your tacos (or whatever else you want), take a number, and wait for them to bring your food out. It was incredibly busy at around 7:30PM (Taco Tuesday runs from 5-9PM), but the food still came out suprisingly fast. Within five minutes, my three Nick's style (with cheese + guacamole) tacos were delivered straight to my spot at the bar. It was actually so busy that when we got there, it was standing room only and we had to scout around before we finally found a table that could seat us. The music was great, the drinks were cheap ($2 bud/bud light, 2 coronas for $5, $3 margaritas), and the atmosphere overall was unusually awesome. Definitely a suprisingly great find and an amazing place to pick up some cheap and delicious food while enjoying a lounge-esque feel.\n\nThe most hilarious part had to be the guy they had working in the bathroom - they have a guy in a nice suit standing in the men's restroom who turns on the water for you and pulls the lever for your paper towels. Next to him is a shelf full of little goodies like Starburst, Jolly Ranchers, and random lotion/perfume products which you are \"free to use,\" but of course, you're expected to tip in the bowl  in the center.

Finally, though, I succumbed to the hype machine (dude-all the cool kids eat there), and I have never been so pleased with a taco. I've only had two kinds, fish and vegetarian, and I love the veggies so much, I refuse to try anything else.  Warm, crunchy, covered with mounds of fresh guacamole. HEAVEN.

Geeze, out of town-ers!!! Anyway I ordered the chicken taco and they were to die for! And Id like to think I'm somewhat of a chicken taco extraordinaire. I give it 3 stars because everybody failed to notify us that you needed to order first, and that the decor of Rouge (which is the same rest/building)was kinda run down looking during the day.

Plus, I had come here a few years ago, so I knew they had pretty good fish tacos.  Well, they were out of fish tacos by 5pm, so I can't review that.  But instead, we got 2 pollo asados, 2 carnitas, and 2 camarones, all done Nick's Way.  Even with $10 off, the bill came out to be $23.  Without our discount, that means that each taco would average out to be over $5 each.  For that price, they better be some damn good tacos.  But alas, they were just ok.  They weren't bad, but I wouldn't run all the way to Pac Heights for them.  Plus, the place was packed by the time we left, with the line for people waiting to get tacos almost to the door.  That's way too much of a wait for kinda expensive tacos that were good, but not great.  Maybe the fish tacos are great, but I didn't get to try them this time.  I do hear that they have $2 tacos (besides fish) on Tuesdays, so that may be the time to come for cheaper tacos, but I also expect the line to be twice as long (and it was already long on Monday).", "author": "Tyler C."}

Case in point, I live in Davis, which is about 8 miles from Woodland, a town whose residents are predominantly Mexican and make the most amazing foods I've ever savored. I will always be a Guadalajara Taqueria girl, so I am a biased reviewer I guess when it comes to Mexican cuisine. However, being hungry after volleyball practice on Tuesday evening wasn't going to stop me from trying some place new for crispy tacos. \n\nEverytime I've ever been by Nick's, the place is absolutely PACKED which would indicate that something must be pretty damn good about the place. The line always seems to be 10 back, but it moves quickly as the cashier punches in orders and hands out numbers all nite. The bar is also close by which is a plus, so your wait will never seem that long. Once you order, good luck finding a place to sit. Good thing tacos are a great handheld food and small enough to devour quickly. On my visit, I went with a carne asada and a carnitas taco prepared Nick's style with guac and cheese of course. Carnitas will always have a special place in my heart, so I can never talk bad about it. It was fantabulous! The crispy shell of the taco seemed to be wrapped in another tortilla that seemed not so crispy so that was a small turnoff, but other than that, the tacos were A-OK especially since they were only $2 each on Tuesday!", "author": "Christina N."}

Took a while to find parking(being from out of town never helps; if you were near there last Sunday, we were the ones driving poorly that you could peg as being tourists from two blocks away).Great atmosphere, in the funky kind of way. Giant glass chandeliers, red leather and velvet for most of the seating (some chairs, loveseats, booths). I bet it can be a pretty good scene on Fridays and Saturdays.\n Didn't realize they only took cash, so we went across the street to Walgreens, bought a $1 bottle of water and got $40 cash back. \nYou order at the counter; the younger counter guy was friendly, patient, and efficient. Tipped him $3 on $37 for counter service... I can sure rack up a bill for a cheap taco place.\nWe each got a margarita for $5.50. Fully worth it. \nWe got an order of the chips, salsa, and guac. for $3.50. The chips and salsa alone, without the guac, are $1.50. I always hate paying for chips, but at least these were really good. Crispy, on the thinner side, just enough salt, covered in chunky, tasty salsa fresca and decent/good guacamole.  Ate the whole damn basket. \nWe each got two of the pescado (battered, deep fried fish) tacos done \"Nick's Way\" (fried tortilla inside the soft one, with jack cheese and guacamole). Big fillet, good amount of cabbage, tasty sauce, jack cheese inside. more salsa fresca and big dollop of guac on top. It was a taco that felt like a 1/2 lb. burger in my hand.  I think I'd like this stye with the grilled fish or chicken, but with the heavily battered fried fish, be prepared for an absolute fry-fest. Two of these gut bombs was more than we could handle on top of the chips and guac. I'd definitely like to go back and try other things next time I'm in the area.

You wait in line, place your order of food and drinks, pay, take your number and find a table. \nOnce you've surveyed the place for a table, you may end up where we were - at the tiny \"bar\" seating that awkwardly faces the booths against the wall. \nOk, so it wasn't so bad - we just turned our chairs to face each other while we drank our Modelo Especial's and waited for our order. \nThe hubby and I both ordered pescado tacos \"Nick's way\" and also 1 grilled fish taco, just to see what it was like. \nThis taco... is heaven. Warm tortilla, filled with a crispy HOT fish fillet, guacamole, shredded cabbage and some yummy mayo-type sauce. It was honestly delicious. We barely talked to each other while eating it besides mumbling \"Mmmmm\" in-between bites. \nI'm not sure what the plain pescado taco is comprised of... but just go with the \"Nick's way\" option. Their guacamole is reason enough. \nThese are pretty big tacos too, at $4 each... and worth every penny. \n\nOh - this place is also really pretty. There are chandeliers hanging throughout the restaurant, and lots of cozy velvet booths and red paint. Turns out, after 10pm it turns into a lounge/club... so if you decide to stay, there ya go! \nWe were in and out, as it was the day we flew in, but it hit the spot!

I have to say that I was pretty disappointed after all of the hype. \n\nThe taco wasn't really that crispy, although it had a nice helping of guac on it, seriously the meat was lacking. I paid $3 or $4 something for the taco... there was hardly ANY meat, and where there was some it didn't do it justice. It was pretty dry and flavorless. \n\nThe chips were really good actually. If my taco was as crispy as my chips it would have been well worth it, even with the meat lacking. The salsa didn't have any kick, but there was a generous amount of it on my chips.. \n\nThe horchata was okay. Too sweet and mealy for my taste... and for $3 it should have been a way bigger cup.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't spectacular I've had better in many other places, for the lack of meat, size/price of the horchata, and ugly decor I don't think I will frequent this place often.

Service is OK, sometimes it drags with confusion at the register (have your order together and your money out, people!) sometimes bc of the staff (Headband guy needs frequent help from Ponytail guy) but pretty reasonable and friendly overall. My favorite items include the black bean and corn salad and the fish tacos. Their veggie burrito needs work in my opinion; it's kinda bland. On the weekends and evenings, probably best to order your food to go unless you like squeezing onto a tiny table or standing with your food (the booths are cool, but usually taken). If you order over the phone to pick up food, speak loud and clearly (music/sports blaring in the background with the order taker yelling over it) and when you go to pick up your order, don't wait on the line, just get one of the non-register dude's attention - Oh yes, I should mention it's cash only, so put that card away, it is of no use to you here.", "author": "Barbara K."}

Burritos are American food.  If you must have some  pedigree for your food, I believe the tacos are San Diego style, so try calling it that to satisfy your snobbery.\r\n\r\nThe tacos Nick's way are DELICIOUS.  This place is a blessing on the neighborhood.  They use Niman Ranch beef and pork so you know the meat is clean as well as tasty.  (Niman Ranch actually raises heirloom hogs).  The fish tacos are savory and filling.  The Carne Asada burrito is perfect to sneak into the movies, as long as you wrap it in napkins.\r\nI am a fan of the reggae music.  One time they switched to 50s music, with disasterous results.   Lately it takes forever to get your food so the distraction is nice.\r\nI almost always get my food to go cause it is a bit of a yuppie hell hole.  \r\nI wish people actually followed the no cell phones rule.\r\nCash only is my favorite kind of establishment.\r\nI think it is a very smart use of space; by operating out of Rouge they circumvent both high San Francisco rent and the draconian liquor license application process. \r\nI am sad to hear that Nick is no longer on the premises.\r\n\r\n***Have to update:  the lines are now REALLY REALLY long, and the food is inconsistant.

When I first walked though the doors... cheeeeeeeeeeeze interior!  They have some ugly looking pinatas and chandeliers in that joint.  Thankfully, I didn't go for the ambiance.  The people inside seemed like tools as well, but then I realized where this place was located..\n\nThe tacos here are unbelievable, and every day I am in the office I contemplate walking the 15 blocks it would take me to get to Nick's.  I'm not a big walker, so it has never happened, but nevertheless.. the thought is there.\n\nA word of caution about the chicken burrito- it is crap.  I can't speak for the other burritos, because I haven't had them, but the chicken burrito was not impressive..  Stick with the carne asada or the carnitas.\n\nHowever, on a more pleasant note with my taste buds, the chips & guac are awesome, and the carne asada tacos are some of the best I have ever had.  This place has perfected white-washing Mexican food.  If you don't order your tacos \"Nick's way,\" you are a tool.  It would be like going to Starbucks and ordering a small cup of black decaf.. \n\nAll I'm saying is that if I'm paying $5 a taco (or for a cup of coffee for that matter) it better be fun to order it, and I better feel like I'm \"in the know.\"\n\nNow go order your \"flying dutchman\" at In-N-Out..\n\n-edit-\n\nI actually did walk from the financial to Nick's today, and aside from the fact that I couldn't find an empty cab to save my life, I made it there in about 45 minutes.  Those hills are killer!\n\nAnyway, long story short, I got some tacos and some chips and guac.

Their quesadillas are different from what you'd expect. They're quite thick, with big chunks of chicken (or whatever you get in them) and are cooked so the tortilla is crispy - great combo of flavors and textures. The burritos, nachos, etc were just decent otherwise. I've noticed that this place becomes a nightclub at night which is hilarious.", "author": "Sung P."}

As we were waiting in line I just realized where we were....it was club Rouge! Now I don't know if this place is still a club later on at night but I do remember coming here with the girls for a drunken night of fun. I remember the chandeliers and the big bar...what a strange place for a taco spot! Anyway, the hubby and I each got 2 tacos. He had 2 carne asada (one Nick's Way w/cheese & guac and made crispy and the other regular soft). I ordered 1 carnitas and 1 pollo asada (Nick's Way). We grabbed out number and looked around for a seat or for people who looked like they were about to leave. We ended up sitting at the bar. As I looked around it seemed like a fun place for a casual dinner with a small group of friends. Alot of these small groups were ordering pitchers of margaritas....ahhhh margaritas sound so good.....too bad I can't have any for at least another 3 months. Our tacos came and they looked yummy. First couple of bites I already knew that these could not compare to our favorite La Taqueria tacos. The hubby strongly agreed. Not even close! They weren't bad...but just not as flavorful. I'm not even sure if I would go back for the food. I mean maybe if we were meeting up with some friends there for some drinks as well but definitely not just for the food.

So for the first timers--you stay in line, order your food, and they give you a number.  If you go on a Tuesday, expect to stand or wait at least 15-20 min for someone to get up from their empty pitchers of margaritas and empty food baskets.  The food was quick.  I ordered 1 carne asado taco, and 1 pollo taco-both nick's way.  Definitely worth it for $.95 more.  They have 2 for $6 coronas and I was satisfied with that.  The tacos are $2 and a pretty good size.

The decor is really wacky. Red lights, chandeliers, and disco balls add to the funkiness. Definitely a happening place. But then again, it was Taco Tuesday, where you get tacos for $2 or something like that. In any event, there was a line nearly out the door (which is extra crazy, because the counter is very very far away from the door) and absolutely no free tables. I would guess, that everyone participating in this mad feeding frenzy was under the age of 30. Well, give or take a few years. Anyway, you get the point. A good mix of Marina/ Mission crowd. Probably because it's Russian Hill, the perfect hybrid. I ended up having a margarita, which was decent. I tried samples of the extra crispy (and overly oily) chips doused with salsa and guacamole. Not bad, not great. I am not really a big chips and salsa fan so I am probably overly harsh. I do like the hot sauce they put on the tables though. I would probably squirt that stuff down my throat if I were drunk enough. Luckily it didn't quite reach that point. So why just three stars? First off there were not enough tables to accommodate the taco craving masses. We were actually forced to share a table with strangers (gasp) and converse with them (double gasp). Not that I mind meeting new people, but seriously, if they are going to have Taco Tuesdays, they should provide more tables!

 are we only supposed to review posh, michelin.starred establishments?  the ritz carlton only has so many restaurants, you know?  so who _are_ these anti.yelp wannabe restaurant critics?  i'm not sure.  however, i realise there _are_ other places to hear about restaurants.  now, i can't say if they're better places to hear about restaurants or not.  well, one place i sometimes find out about restaurants is on pbs kqed's _check_please!_ television show.  my wife watches more tv than i do.  i had watched this show in the past, but i rediscovered it while sitting around with my wife at home during my lunch break from work one day.  yeah, i'm blessed with living close to work and thus can often eat lunch at home, a five.star establishment.  anyway, in case you don't know on _check_please!_ three, normal, non.professional restaurant critics get together and pick three restaurants to introduce to the group as well as the viewing audience.  i suppose you're supposed to pick a restaurant that isn't too obvious.  usually, the group is nice to the first person that introduces his/her restaurant.  then as the show progresses, they start getting meaner and meaner.  then by the last of the three, they're totally bagging on each other's tastes in food.  maybe it's because they drink wine as they talk, and that loosens up the lips over time or something.  in the past, some of my friends said i ought to go on that show.  if i were to go on that show, i really wonder which restaurant i would pick.  in order for it not to be too obvious, maybe it ought to be a santa clara koreatown restaurant.  however, i'm sure the other two in my group would be philistines that don't understand korean food.  after all, i watched a desi guy try to introduce an indian fusion restaurant and some dude that thought he knew indian food tried to rip him up just to be a jerk.  i'm glad that doesn't really happen on yelp.\n\nanyway, i found out about nick's crispy tacos from an episode of _check_please!_.  one girl introduced the restaurant, praising its tortilla soup and well... crispy tacos.  i thought they said each taco had two tortillas, one crispy one within one soft one.  immediately, i thought about the taco bell double decker taco.  ah, crud... now, the san franciscan foodie snobs are throwing their arms up in the air and then pointing at me, shouting and screaming, because i dared mention \"taco bell\" in the middle of a restaurant review.  hey, i'm not the first on this page!  uh, did i dig a deeper hole?  anyway, the other two; since this was the second or third of the three restaurants on the episode; started to bag on this restaurant, saying that the food was messy and nothing special.  from the show, i knew that the restaurant was located in club rouge niteclub.  i knew it had the whole red, palace theme (not \"red palace,\" all one word.  that sounds like some place in russia or china... oh, but a wiki says it's a place in birmingham, england).  i think i also heard on the show that this is a cash.only joint.\n\nwell, this past saturday, my wife had us go to a training session for the academy of friends annual gala.  we worked there on sunday night, selling drink tickets to guests of this black tie benefit for aids/hiv research; apparently, a huge san franciscan tradition on academy awards night.  well, after the training session, we strolled around the marina and then drove over to nick's crispy tacos.  god granted us a prime parking spot right in front of this joint.  the restaurant looked just as it had on tv.  just as i had remembered from the show, they were cash.only; and i never carry that much cash.  i'm a credit card kind of guy because i like to monitor my spending on mint.com.  i realised my limited cash supply would place a firm ceiling on my lunch experience.  i only had $15 to feed the both of us.  since we weren't super hungry, i agreed with my wife that we could just share three tacos.  i ordered one carne asada, one carnitas, and one grilled fish taco.  the polite, young woman behind the counter asked if i wanted them nick's way; but i couldn't afford the additional 95 cents.  aw, crud... now the san franciscan foodie snobs are again jumping up and down and pointing at me.  yeah, i must admit that it's hard to experience an eating establishment fully if you can't buy a complete meal, etc.  thus, i must preface the rest of my review by saying that i hope to return to get the full experience and write a better review.  well, the menu just said that nick's way would add guacamole and cheese to my tacos, and i figured i could do without those for now because i had ingested plenty of homemade guacamole the night before.  i did _not_ realise that forgoing \"nick's way\" would eliminate the double decker taco feature!  oops!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-04-19", "description": "I took an out of town visitor here late last year and now we are both a big fan of the fish tacos, baja style (Nick's Way).  The mahi mahi is deep fried in a thick golden brown batter and topped off with cabbage, salsa, fresh pico and wrapped in a corn (or flour) tortilla.  It's good stuff, and basically filling with just one, but if you're really hungry go ahead and get two.  They're really cheap -- about $4 bucks or so each.  I tried the tortilla soup and didn't really care for the flavor, but the soup ingredients were fresh and had hearty portions.  I tried the fish burrito baja style, and the batter clumped together and got really mushy before I was halfway through the burrito.  I also tried a chicken dish and wasn't a big fan of the texture or flavor.  The atmosphere and decor are a bit cheesy, from the floating fish pinatas to the large and gaudy chandeliers, but the waiters and cashiers are down to earth and usually pleasant, so it all makes for a pretty laid back place to grab a bite to eat.  If you go, I recommend the fish tacos (I'd definitely give them 4 stars).

I could barely eat two and I have a pretty hefty appetite for small little girl! Get there early, if you're trying to take advantage of their specials on Tuesdays ($2 tacos, $2.95 if you want it Nick's way) because the line is LONG...but it does move fairly fast. The long line, crowded atmosphere and lack of seats may discourage you, but it's well worth the wait. Another minor downside...I would pass on the horchata and grab a corona instead. It was extremely chalky...and to be honest, difficult to drink. But who knows, maybe it was just a fluke and perhaps a bad batch.

My roommate and I stumbled upon Nick's while we were still in apartment-hunting mode, and for several months before we could move in, we conjured up grandiose happy hour plans involving $2 drinks and famous crispy tacos.  When we finally took up residence (right up the road, conveniently), we began a Thursday evening Nick's tradition that took on a life of its own.  There is something about the combination of neighborhood taqueria juxtaposed against sleazy crushed red-velvet that makes the Nick's experience totally unique.  The tacos and burritos are delicious, and if you linger long enough over your $2 drinks, you get to watch them transform the place from Nick's-crispy-tacos to Rouge-the-nightclub. This fascinating process involves removing the dining room tables from the dance floor, taking down the sombreros hanging from every wall, covering all the booth tables with white tablecloths, dimming the lights, and of course, jacking up the drink prices. It is quite an interesting experience (further enhanced by four hours of happy hour drinks under your belt), and if you ask nicely, they'll let you linger in your booth without having to re-enter or pay a cover charge.", "author": "Chelsea R."}

They two stars are for the guys that work there, they are pretty cool. Also, Nick's doubles as a nightclub at night which throws me off because 1 side of the place is decked out in picnic tables and such and the other side in plush red velvet booths. Quite the awkward setting for a restaurant. because of that, you really can't and shouldnt take Nick's seriously in terms of a good place to eat.

BUT here's an ALARMING maragarita related discovery ... on Friday night we went to grab some drinks before heading out ... the Nick's side was packed so we went to the ROUGE SIDE ... we ordered 4 Patron margaritas and sipped away happily UNTIL - ( dun, dun dun ... enter movie music ) we asked for the check ... the bill read $40.00 ( ok no biggie, we live here - we're no strangers  to the $10.00 drink  .. I get it ) but then we noticed an additional  $6.00 sur charge at the bottom of the bill??  Hmmm that's odd, we thought - so we asked the bartender about it and he said - \"I don't make the rules and besides - I only charged you a  $6.00 surcharge, it shouldve been $8.00\"  ( $2.00 per drink)\"  Reeeally, for what exactly??? Let me get this straight, we're already paying for the top shelf booze but now you're bending us over because we bought it??  Hmmm there's a SOLID  business strategy ! He tried to placate us with  \"for happy hour on the Nick's side, the well drinks are only $ 3.00.\"  yeh well, the thing is pal - last I checked, it's not happy hour and I'm not paying $3.00 per drink in this example - so explain why this is helpful? \n\nMy question is  - how many happy go lucky, unsuspecting boozers are paying the additonal cash w/o even realizing it?? Obviously this is not a bank breaker it's just the principle ....  I'm sure this adds up over the course of a weekend ... the question to management is, why are you being shady to customers who support and love you and your margarita's ??? In the future I'll think twice before buying a margarita on the Rouge side again ...  Tommy's anyone?? ;)", "author": "Aimee J."}
