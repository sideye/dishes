Was it an odd sense of culinary xenophobia that prevented me from entering? Yeah, probably because I was one of the old-school types who felt when in J-Town, you eat Japanese no matter how good or bad it may be. But I've broadened my horizons and tried both Korean and Thai food in the neighborhood, so why not try Chinese, in particular, Mandarin?\n\nOther reviews mentioned Korean dishes as part of the cooking offering here, although I guess I didn't get that far in the menu to notice. I did take notice of the complimentary cup of kimchee that landed in front of me before I ordered. It was crunchy though a tad too sweetly mild for my taste (photo: http://bit.ly/2IsWTfc). I was in the mood for something basic, so I ordered the $12.50 Chicken with Black Mushrooms, which was pretty basic with shiitake caps and pea pods mixed to a shiny finish with the poultry (photo: http://bit.ly/2k3HdVa). The $1.45 Steamed Rice was necessary to sop up the requisite brown sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2IoWsCh).\n\nI was feeling indulgent and went for the $8.95 Steamed Potstickers, a half-dozen hefty ones that tasted even doughier than they looked in the metal steamer (photo: http://bit.ly/2IICkyH). The piping hot minced pork stuffing was hearty stuff though you need to let them cook a bit before ingesting. I actually came back a couple of weeks later to try the $10.95 Eggplant with Garlic Sauce and was pleasantly surprised to find it not submerged in brown sauce and actually festooned with shaved mushrooms. So maybe I have gotten over my xenophobia. OK, maybe not.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pretty standard dishes, huge portions.\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...popular spot but nothing special \nSERVICE - 3 stars...'been there, done that' attitude\nTOTAL - 3 stars... if a hankering for Chinese hits you in J-Town", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-08", "description": "*** Vegetarian Review ***\n\nWho goes to Japantown to eat at a Chinese restaurant? Our family has been paying the Bay Bridge toll to get to the city for over 30 years and hopefully after reading this and browsing through the food pictures, you will too. \n\nThis isn't like the Chinese restaurants in China Town. Let's put it this way. Some great friends that owned a Chinese restaurant said they don't even eat at the Chinese restaurants in China Town because of cleanliness issues. Now it's not eating-off-the-floor clean here either, but you won't think twice when you walk in.\n\nTips for first timers:\n\n1. Parking. San Wang is located on the perimeter of Japantown. If you get a window seat, you can see the Peace Pagoda in Japantown's center. This being San Francisco and in a tourist area, don't mess around with street parking. You're going to stroll Japantown either before or after so use the parking garage across the street.\n\n2. Order everything dry-fried! I have no idea about any other dishes because all I've ever eaten here are the veggie chow mein / chow fun and whatever they can dry fry. What is dry fry? Imagine a tempura with a very thin, extra crispy batter and then imagine rainbows and unicorns!\n\n3. Don't see it on the menu, just ask. Unlike some of the China Town restaurants where communication can be difficult, this is as easy as ordering at Panda Express.\n\n4. They provide a complimentary kimchi for the table before your main meals arrive. Like most kimchis, this is not vegetarian-friendly.\n\nDry fried Eggplant (Grade A+)\n\nI first tried this dish in my early vegetarian days and was so happy, ordered another to go. It has all the making of an eggplant tempura, but unlike the Japanese style that usually has too much batter and is mushy, San Wang lightly batters and dry frys this dish to a golden brown. The edges are crispy like the last piece of a corndog -- the piece on the stick.\n\nThen, they drench the crispy eggplant with a Sichuan style sauce. My rookie taste buds detect soy sauce, sugar, garlic and my eyes can see spring onions, red bell peppers, and chilis. You would think this would make the dish soggy and you would be wrong. However, I recommend moving the eggplant out of the swimming pool of sauce to help your cause. Oftentimes, after this dish moves around the Lazy Susan, you won't have to worry about it because it's all gone.\n\nThe portion size isn't always consistent, but for the most part, enough for 5.\n\nDry fried string beans (Grade A+)\n\nSame sauce as above, but with mushrooms. Same cooking method as above. These are the best string beans you'll ever try. During non-peak hours, you can actually see employees stripping and cleaning the string beans so you know they're fresh. This is the vegetarian version of selecting your fish or lobster from the tank before it's cooked.\n\nPortion size varies, but generally enough to feed a party of 5.\n\nDry fried tofu (Grade B+)\n\nThey have mapo tofu on the menu, but I've stopped ordering this for the last couple of years. I'm sure it's good, but it took me years to realize I just don't like mapo tofu. So on this visit, still wanting a protein to complete my meal, asked if they could make a dry fried tofu. They said they can make anything dry fried, but ask!\n\nSame sauce as the string beans and the tofu is thick cut rectangles. It didn't arrive lightly battered like I expected, but it was still very good. Next time, I'll ask if they can prepare it similarly which would elevate this to an A+ dish.\n\nThe tofu is fresh. This isn't a small detail because some restaurants that offer a tofu dish, but don't have a lot of customers ordering it often serve the tofu beyond its use date as a cost saving attempt. I know when I order tofu here I will get a fresh item because when I look around, plenty of tables have tofu on their table. It's more likely they run out of tofu before they serve you spoiled tofu.\n\nOverall food observations:\n\nThe server jokes, \"everything dry fried.\" You may think it's a waste to order dishes with the same sauce profiles, but trust me, it's worth it. Thirty-plus years as a regular and there's never leftovers.\n\nOverall restaurant observations:\n\n1. Friendly staff. Communication is never a problem.  \n\n2. Bathrooms are clean and have paper towels.\n\n3. Like most authentic Chinese restaurants, tea is provided. If you want water, you have to ask and make sure you say how many or for the table. If one person just asks for water, it's not uncommon for just that one person to get water.\n\n4. Don't want to wait? Try to get there when they open for lunch or if you can wait, go into full-tourist mode and visit the many sights and sounds of Japantown and return a little after the peak hours. Pretend you're on a dessert-recon. \n\n5. Groups. I actually don't know if they take reservations. We always make sure to show up when they open to make sure we get a table. They have 4 round large tables that can hold up to 7 comfortably and 8 uncomfortably.", "author": "Ron R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-30", "description": "What do you eat when in Japantown?\n\nWell, you'd think the normal response is, duh, Japanese food?!  \nIn my pre-20's, besides having countless bowls of udon in the mall, we actually dined at the original Korean House, up the stairs on Post near Laguna.  We also sometimes came here, a Chinese restaurant with a Korean influence... gee, sounds like a popular place on Irving Street.\nThey used to have a second restaurant on Clement near 25th Avenue.  \n\nBack to this place, I've been shopping in the neighborhood a bit more often and, after parking, pass this restaurant seeing a decent amount of diners enjoying their meals. On a recent planned shopping trip, I called the restaurant and ordered my lunch.  When I tried to order it in Mandarin (knew that their cuisine was northern style), I was surprised to learn the lady who answered spoke took my order in English (I believe she is Korean).   Their two staple dishes are their fried chicken wings and Ja jiang mein (noodles in plum sauce).  Not wanting to be stuffed at work, I order the Dry fried chicken wings (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Tu2Fn5Rg3dU0WnPAYVsinw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) and the hot and sour soup (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HlutbfCeg_GaD_eb7zlGDA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).\n\nStarting with the hot and sour soup, my first impression was that the flavors were subtle, not an in-your-face vinegar sour or pepper hot spicy.  Mainly I enjoyed that there was a variety of ingredients though one old time favorite was missing (Kum choy in Cantonese).  If you do not have a high tolerance to heavy flavors or spiciness, you'll enjoy this.\n\nNow, the chicken wings are another story.  I noticed several reviewers compared this version to that Irving Street place and the best description is that they are different.  Where San Tung (and So, for that matter), it's all about the flavors in the batter, the star of San Wang's wings are the trimmings or condiments that accompany the chicken. The ingredients are garlic slices, Szechuan peppers (which I removed), scallions, and ginger in a tangy yet sweet sauce.  The wings are not heavily battered so they are lighter on the palate, yet still just as addictively good.  Let's just say that, after finishing the chicken, I spooned some rice to top with those ingredients.\n\nOld time place that still works.  Be warned that prices have increased and, in studying the takeout menu, dining in for lunch is probably the best deal in enjoying their variety of dishes.  Yes, I will be back and you can bet the wings will be one of my dishes.", "author": "Mike C."}

The bus boy pushed the cart past us a moment later but it was a sign of things to come.\n\nWon ton soup was good, the dumplings were excellent with thin wrappers and delicious pork filling. \n\nThis is where everything went very, very awry: the bus boy began bringing our dishes, first the walnut shrimp and bowl of steamed rice (I picked off a small bit of soy-stained rice off the edge of the bowl and put it aside.)\n\nI chose to ignore it, my mistake -again. \n\nI had two or three shrimp; they were very good but the thought of the bus boy clearing tables in between becoming our server, I began to stop eating.\n\nThe water dumplings came, again delivered by the bus boy.

I was looking up places to go eat nearby, the reason why i don't eat at the festival is because of the long lines, spending a fortune, and nothing new i want from the festival food vendors. \n\nWhen i walked in here, i was greeted and sat down to the table with the nearest outlet. When i sat down, i was automatically given a plate of pickled spicy cabbage, in other words kimchee. \n\nI have decided to order the dry fry chicken wings, and jan pon which is spicy korean seafood noodles soup. \n\nDry fry chicken wings $13 for 15 pieces of wings. I kid not, it was like never ending wings, as much as i ate. I had about 10 wings and i was so satisfied! i had save the rest for a late night snack when i am buzzed. The presentation of the wings were outstanding, colorful and appetizing. The wings were dry with light orangey red sauce. It had tons of fine chopped up garlic, saut\u00e9ed onions, and chives mixed in with it. The chicken wings consist of mostly middle part of the wings, versus the little drum stick on the wing. It was worth the buck for this dish. Next time I'm just sticking with this dish only, because i was filled with just this. \n\nI also gave jan pin a try too. The presentation was steaming wonderful hot. The first sip of the broth i was not impressed, i felt like it was kind of bland. i had to spice it up with the table red chili, which wasn't too good. The noodles were ok, reminds me of soba noodles, but different. It consists a lot of veggies, mushrooms, some shrimps, clams, and slices of pork. I wasn't impress with this dish, and i don't think i will order it again. It was a big portion though. \n\nOverall service was ok, when i flag them down for water, boxes, or ticket, they were quick with it. The food portions was huge. The restaurant was clean and looks like a Chinese restaurant. I do like the little upstairs they have and in my mind i was thinking perfect for a uye party.

San Wang is a Chinese/Korean restaurant in the middle of J-Town that serves up some very tasty dishes. San Wang definitely surprised me tonight with a very satisfying dinner experience.\n\nThe idea to give San Wang a try actually came from my mom. Her friends recommended it to her and she wanted to try it. I was game, so we went ahead and went in. The dining room is definitely adequate and clean. We were seated right away amidst a decent amount of people for a quiet Monday night out for dinner.\n\nLooking at the menu, you might think the cuisine is American Chinese food, but it certainly isn't - it's authentic. We ordered a few dishes, and when they came, we saw that they were unique and portioned generously. I say unique because I feel that San Wang has their own style of preparing 'standard' dishes in a way that isn't typical of other Chinese restaurants. It's a bit hard to describe, but I can say that the dishes at San Wang are both familiar and different enough to pique your pallet's interest.\n\nEach dish was seasoned perfectly and piping hot. We had quite a bit leftover to take home and have for lunch or dinner the next day.\n\nIn terms of service, the staff was friendly and attentive. We got what we needed very quickly, and they helped us box our leftovers up. The bathroom facilities were clean too! A lot of times Chinese restaurants tend to have below cleanliness standards in the bathrooms... but San Wang was nice and tidy. I really appreciate that in a men's restroom!\n\nSan Wang is a solid restaurant if you're craving some Chinese food done well. It's quite a few notches above average, but isn't the best of the best.

It's a unique and delicious blend of both, and is pretty much it's own genre of Asian cuisine.\n\nA personal favorite is the chicken wings. This is really one of my favorite dishes ever and I enjoy these so much more than San Tung. They are smothered in sauce/green beans that is just to die for, yum. Other favorites are the fried shrimp, fried beef (tangsooyuk), green beans, clams in black bean sauce, and sizzling rice soup. It's best to eat here family style and order all of the above! \n\nA paragraph needs to be devoted to the jajangmyeon at this place. In all honesty, it is my favorite place to get jajangmyeon. There is so much flavor and the sauce is loaded with so many goodies like shrimp, onion, etc. When you finish all the noodles, you could mix this sauce with rice.

Indo-Chinese, Japanese-Chinese, Filipino-Chinese, Chinese-American (think your average \"lemon chicken\" takeout and Panda Express), and of course Korean-Chinese. I'd say out of all the renditions I've had so far (Chifa/Chinese-Peruvian you're next), Korean-Chinese is definitely my favorite and I crave JaJangMyun all the time! \n\nNowadays, whenever the fiance and I go to Japantown we always pick this place over all the other over-priced \"Japanese\"places in the area. That being said, San Wang definitely has the best Jajangmyun in town (better than Zazang, Tong Soon and that Korean-Chinese place in Lawrence Plaza that is now closed). Portions are good for the price and the sauce is not watered down like some other places. The sauce itself has the perfect balance of sweet and savory and there's always an abundant amount of sauce with every bowl of noodles. Their tangsooyook (think sweet-n-sour pork without the horrid food coloring) is also solid. Big portions and none of that overly fried, dry-ass, fat and dough-filled dingleberries they call \"meat\" at some Chinese places. \n\nDefinitely a thumbs up from me!", "author": "Mona H."}

Not the best I've had.  (The honor for that goes to Shan Dong in Oakland which sets a very high standard: http://www.yelp.com/biz/shan-dong-restaurant-oakland#hrid:7USD0JPUUshsTpjCJdxh3A/ ).  But also not bad by any means.  Nicely chewy, and the sauce is good.  I'd definitely come back for these noodles.\n\n# Dry Fried Chicken - I think this is what San Wang is known for.  These are no where near as good as the ones at San Tung.  Our pile was mostly drummettes, with just one flapper.  (Most people seem to prefer the drummettes, but I really enjoy the flappers, since the meat is more tender.)  The flavoring was good, mild garlic and soy sauce flavor, but not as sweet as the ones at San Tung.  The part I didn't like was the breading.  It was a bit too thick and dry.\n\n# Bean Curd Family Style - This was some fried tofu pouches (which were kinda mushy) with an assortment of Chinese vegetables, and a very lightly flavored sauce.\n\nService was good.  The interior and customers inside felt authentic.  It's pretty roomy inside, and they've got large tables .... great for groups.  Also, it's possibly the only place to get Chinese food in Japantown.

But after the stinging, breath destroying appetizer of coarsely chopped onions with black bean(?) sauce, all the entrees seemed demagnified in a way.\n\nI heard there's sea cucumber, but I must've overlooked it on the menu.

A lot of the food seems to be inspired by Korean dishes.  I mean they give you complimentary kimchi and raw onions with black bean paste.  What we ordered was also very Korean.  We got the jiajiagmyun and the dried fried chicken wings.  Both were good, but not outstanding.  The jiajiagmyun had good texture and the noodles were nicely done.  However, the sauce, although very good in concsstency and abundant,  lacked a little bit of flavor, just by a little though.  Same thing with the wings, although fried well and were good, they lacked that extra punch.  I don't know, maybe my taste buds are all screwy from all the spicy food I've been eating, but until proven differently I have to give it 3.5 stars.  \n\nThe Chinese food actually looked really good.  A table next to us ordered honey walnut prawns, and I had buyer's remorse!  I will have to come back here and try the Chinese food!

This was my favorite restaurant growing up, and even as an adult, I compare all the chicken wings I eat to their dry fried chicken.  I have been told San-Tung has good/better chicken wings, but I have never tried it.  From my understanding, it is cooked differently.\n\nThe dry-fried chicken is just perfection.  Crispy outside, moist inside.  They then smother it with a garlic, green onion and soy based sauce that is a match made in heaven.  The wings are not greasy, surprisingly.  I can eat a whoel order all to myself!\n\nThey pretty much dry fry everything, but IMO the chicken is the best.  I also really love the sweet and sour whole rock cod.  Its so crispy outside, again moist and juicy inside.  It si pricey though, so I save that for special occassions. \n\nI have also tried their noodle dishes, and they are yummy.  They make their noodles in house.  The jajangmyun is pretty good, and so is the San Wang Noodle soup.  Has a nice spicy kick to it.  I also love their sauteed pea sprouts.\n\nWhen I get a craving of dry-fried chicken, I make the trek from newark to Japantown.\n\nIt's amazingly funny when I take people to my favorite chinese/korean restaurant, we end up in Japantown.\n\nThe only thing holdng me back from 5 stars is the decor and ambience.

I honestly didn't like that very much. When the Jia Jiang Mein and Cashew Chicken came, I was excited. Jia Jiang Mein is not on San Wangs menu, but it is noodles in plum sauce and onions?

MAN ALIVE - be absolutely sure you come with an appetite!\n\nWalking in, San Wang resembles a usual Chinese restaurant. Florescent lighting, white walls, cooks clanging pots in the back, and waiters bustling all over the place. I was the first of my party for 9 that had arrived and luckily we called ahead for reservations, because the restaurant was quite crowded. Another group of 10 dropped into the restaurant without reservations at the same time I showed up. The waiter gave my table away because my other dinner mates had not showed up yet. Understandably, my group was placed a very cramped table. I think I sat at a 45 degree angle from the table to be exact. But seriously, I was ready to eat standing up if I had too!\n\nOnce everyone arrived we took some time and ordered 7 dishes. We were not told how big these dishes were, but just by looking around, I could tell these were massive portions. Someone at first thought that it would not be enough, but we were spot on with the order size. We started out with a large bowl of Hong Kong style Sizzling chicken broth soup. Then the food started coming out immediately. Ma Po tofu dish, sauteed pea sprouts (dau mu), dry fried green beans with chicken,  Jai Jiang Mein (a korean noodle dish), walnut shrimp, their deep fried chicken, AND a whole Hot Braised Fish (rock cod). The two highlight dishes here for me were the fried chicken and the dau mu. I have not had fried chicken that good since my days of living in Beacon Hill in Boston, Primo's restaurant. Not sure that these were actually Pea Pod stems per se, but they were really well done.\n\nThe service here is awesome. There was one younger waiter who was just buzzing around so quickly and on top of everything. For a group of 9, we were all completely full and each of us ended up paying only $15 dollars. Incredibly good value for the amount of food we ordered.", "author": "Michael C."}

We waited for 15 minutes for a menu at one point I thought we were supposed to get it ourselves. Several waiters passed us multiple times and did not even say anything. The store was not full with customers or busy so there shouldn't have been an excuse. We raised our hands and I saw a waiter in the back doing nothing but standing there and looking at clean dishes. We finally got menus and had to wait another 20 minutes to order when everyone already had food and eating amongst themselves. We were about to get up and leave but they already set the side dishes there. He finally got our order, it was an order of black bean noodles (didn't even have it on the menu) and curry chicken. He also did not tell us that it didn't come with rice (curry chicken) which aren't the waiters supposed to tell us? The wait for the food was not long, it came about 10 minutes after we ordered. The chicken was bland and did not taste good, would rate it 1/10. The black bean noodle has shrimp in it which was a big surprise because it usually doesn't. The menu said there was a noodle with plum sauce and shrimp, maybe they mislabeled it? When we were finally done it took forever to get the bill. The wait times for things were ridiculous.

I'm sure if you're chinese this place aint gunna be that great. I mean I love Panda express, so that says something about my taste in Chinese food. I'm not into authentic Chinese flavors. This place is basically Chinese food you'll find in Korea like zzazzangmyun, zampong, tangsuyoot, etc. \n\nWe ALWAYS order the same shit. Sachun beef, meh-woon seh woo, shrimp fried rice, and black and peppar shrimp. Omg I'm drooling as we speak. First off, you can feed an army with these entrees. It's pretty big. I say one entree is for about two people. \n\nSachun beef and meh-woon seh-woo (shrimp) are both battered and deep-fried and smothered in sweet tang-su-yook type sauce. They both have chili peppers but they're both more sweet than even considered spicy. OMG seriously, unhealthy but sooo good. You mix the sauce with the shrimp fried rice and that shiet is heaven. \n\nShrimp fried rice can't go wrong so I won't say much, but it's super light and not greasy, it's just perfection. Honestly I don't really like zzazzangmyun, but honestly it's not bad, but I don't like it in general so I can't say much for that either.\n\nMy mom is obsessed with black pepper shrimp. It's deep fried king shrimp covered in fresh garlic and black pepper and jalapenos. I don't eat it because it's literally the entire shrimp deep fried with eyes, legs, etc. But my mom and everyone LOVES it.\n\nAnyhow, idk about quality or authenticity of the restaurant in terms of Chinese food, but for Chinese Korean Food I think San Wang is what's up.

Yeah, I don't know.\n\nWe came here with enough people to fill two tables, so that's what they gave us. We had two adjacent tables near the corner of the restaurant closest to the door. Since we weren't all sitting together, we thought it'd be best to just order separately for each table because there were some items which one table liked but the other didn't, and vice versa.\n\nI sat at the table which ordered second. Within a few minutes, plate after plate starting coming out of the kitchen for my table. The table which ordered first sat back and waited. Eventually every single plate we ordered came out, and the first table still didn't get anything except white rice. We felt kinda bad for them, since we ordered around just enough food for just our table so it wasn't exactly feasible to share our food with them. The waiter kept insisting that their food was coming.\n\nBy the time most of my table was done eating, the other table just started getting food. It's just ridiculous that the waiters would completely neglect one table of a two-table group.\n\nAs for the food, it was decent but not memorable.

Their secret dry-fried recipe comes in various forms such as dry-fried chicken, shrimp, beef, scallops, squid, green beans, and eggplant. The chicken is especially popular as they are essentially large delicious fried chicken wings of magic. I recommend trying the dry-fried chicken and shrimp or the beans if you are a vegetarian. \n\nSan Wang also offers family-style meals that serve up to 10 people. The fanciest being the Peking Dinner for $159.99 that has an assortment of dishes as well as the much desired Peking Duck dish. \n\nThe appetizers aren't anything to write home about. The potstickers take an average of 15 minutes, which is well after all your entrees arrive at this quick turn-over establishment. Plus they taste as if they are previously frozen (the potstickers at Trader Joe's are better). The soups are good especially the Hot and Sour Soup. \n\nCome hungry and leave in a food-coma as San Wang serves up some of the best Chinese food outside of Chinatown. An average meal for two is $30-40.", "author": "Alice S."}

Without the artificial-tasting sugariness and high salt content that usually accompanies the dishes at San Tung's, San Wang does an impeccable job of balancing its seasoning without compromising the taste. \n\nJust some preliminary words of advice: if you're coming in for lunch (the only time I've ever been) on the weekends it's best to come before the rush hour. Come in by 11:30-11:45am and you're guaranteed a table. This place is rated 5-stars not for the ambience, but for the quality of its food (with ambience ratings added on, my comprehensive score would be a 4). \n\nWhen you're seated, you are offered a small dish of kimchi. Just FYI, this restaurant is Korean-Chinese. And just in case you aren't too familiar with Chinese restaurants, there are various types of cuisines each with their specialties. For instance, you would only order your usual chicken chow mein or beef chow fun at a Cantonese restaurant, as you would only order kung pao chicken or other chili dishes at a Szechuan restaurant.\n\nFor starters we had the sizzling rice soup. Now, if you frequent many Chinese restaurants as I have, you may notice that many, if not most, restaurants have cut down on costs with the wok-crisped rice cakes. Most restaurants use pre-packaged rice cakes purchased at wholesalers and markets, leaving you mostly with a soup that is....sizzle-less. But here at San Wang, they make their own wok-crisped rice cakes and it really does make a significant difference in terms of the soup's savory taste, its aromatic qualities and a bit of a crunch to indulge with its spoonful of fresh, best-quality seafood and vegetable chunky medley. \n\nWe then proceeded with the restaurant's Dried Fried Chicken, a bowl of Zha jiang mian (it's basically a Hand-Pulled Noodle with a black sauce of Zucchini, Potatoes and Pork dish -- if you want this dish to be as authentic-tasting, the first sign for this dish would be the color of its sauce. BLACK ONLY. NOT BROWN), the San Wang Noodle Soup, and a Beef and Green Onion Stir-fry (LOVE IT). \n\nThis place offers a scrumptious, more health-conscious alternative to your typical greasy, sodium-overload Chinese take-out place. The service is quick! The portions are plentiful! And if you order these dishes suggested, I promise you and your tummy will only smile with delight!", "author": "Tiffany H."}

Sweet and sour pork was mostly breading and very little meat, but their Jajangmyun was fine. I really enjoyed all the food because it was freezing cold outside and we were all pretty hungry, but it wasn't anything better than other places I've been. \n\nService Review: Food came out quickly, and they didn't disturb us while eating (typical at many Asian restaurants, so not a surprise). \n\nVenue Review: Lots of indoor seating that could fit even larger families or groups. Parking can be found down the street in an underground parking lot, or if you're lucky there is also some street parking. \n\nOverall Impression: Perfect place to go for some solid Asian comfort food or for large groups.

Yeah, maybe i'm just hurt. \n\nSo they have amazing hand-pulled noodles. We always order chow mein when we are here. They also have some bomb shrimp fried rice. One of my faves in the city. My mom loves their dry fried green beans (yum). My brother loves their sweet and sour shrimp (yum). My dad loves their salt and pepper spare ribs (yum). I loved their chicken in peking sauce. It had tender chicken in a tangy peking sauce with a nice kick of red pepper. They took it off their menu and broke my heart. *sniff sniff*\n\nIt's great for large groups and they even have an upstairs for private parties. Their food is good and decently priced. There's never too long of a wait and their wait staff is attentive and quick. \n\nI would give it 3.5 stars because they took away my fave dish but i bumped them up to 4 since i've been going there so long and have always had good dining experiences with them.", "author": "Tab C."}

I guess an Asian fusion restaurant? The bf and I visited a few friends and they recommended this spot for crispy chicken wings. Thinking that it would be Korean style chicken wings, we went and to our dismay it was quite the opposite. First off, the chicken wings were tiny and the sauce was way too salty and the chicken was oily. We also ordered a Chinese vegetable stir fry medley with bok choy, mushrooms, onions, garlic, and other veggies and honestly, I enjoyed the vegetable dish more than the meat. \n\nThe kimchi here isn't the greatest and San Wang does not have Korean yellow daikon which is real rare for a Korean/Chinese restaurant.

They have that double-fried thing going on perfectly - crispy on the outside and still with a crunch in the inside.  Just good stuff.  I'd eat a whole plate of that myself if I could.\n\nMy family likes ordering their clams, not sure why.  It's good, but not great.  Last time we found a big old rock on our plate.  We showed it to the manager just so he knew and he was pretty indifferent about it.  Oh well was his reaction.\n\nThe first time we ordered some beef dish that tasted pretty blah.  I can't remember what it was because it wasn't very good.\n\nWhat I do remember from the first experience and our most recent was the service.  Nothing to rave about at all.  The first time it was bad - they were not good about clearing dirty dishes at all, especially when it came to cutting the cake.  Despite having reservations, the table wasn't ready for our large family and grandparent in a wheelchair.  Yeah, we don't like waiting when we're hungry and when we expect them to be ready for us.  Most recently, service was not that great either and they were not good about refilling the tea.  They would come around and look, but not take the tea pot with them for a refill.  \n\nWe'll probably end up here again because they have a large table to accommodate our large family, which is probably why we came here in the first place.

San Tung is light years ahead of this place. Go there instead.\n\nThe place is still dingy and dirty.\n\nAmazingly, the awful service has somehow gotten even **worse**. It now ranges from nonexistent, to surly, to purposely ignoring you despite making direct eye contact and conversation.\n\nAs you're probably familiar with Chinese restaurants, you'd know to expect dirty tables and horrendous service if the food were good. But the food here is anything but good.\n\nYears ago, the food was mediocre at best on a good day. It, like the service, has also somehow gotten even **worse**. \n\nThe food used to at least come out quickly. Now it takes forever. Perhaps to balance things out, it's also significantly more expensive, too.\n\nThere's literally no reason for a restaurant like this to exist anymore in San Francisco. Maybe when Chinese food was still a novelty, back in the 1950s (or whenever), and crappy, overpriced Chinese restaurants with terrible service like these were something you would do once for the experience. \n\nI don't think there are any tourists left on the planet naive enough to find this dumpster fire of a restaurant to be anything other than a horrific experience. It really is that bad.\n\nNothing about this place is worth your time, effort or hard-earned money.\n\nSTAY AWAY. \n\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW - Sad to say, San Wang has completely gone to hell.\n\nThe service has become incredibly inattentive and the servers are no longer interested in taking your order, refilling your rice/tea, or actually seating your party properly or in a timely manner. They'll take your order (eventually), bring out your food (which still comes out quickly), and hand you the check (eventually). Beyond that, as a customer here, you may as well be invisible.\n\nThe food has taken an absolute nosedive. The dry-fried squid is an absolute, soggy, floppy, flavorless-mouthful-of-batter disaster. The dry-fried chicken wings now come out over-fried, shriveled, and smelly. I've never been to San Tung in my life (I'll rectify this soon), but I can guarantee their wings, which I've never actually eaten, are better than this place's. That's how bad it's gotten.\n\nBefore, this place looked like your typical, terrible, family-style Chinese restaurant and was such a treat because of how pleasant a surprise it would turn out to be.\n\nNow, this place is, in fact, your typical, terrible, family-style Chinese restaurant, with horrible service and awful food.\n\nIf you're in San Francisco and craving Chinese food, you can do much, much, much better than San Wang.

The menu still seems the same after the recent remodeling (they were closed for a couple of months) and they still give you some complimentary yummy kim chee to start (the owner is Chinese but lived in Korea, I believe).  Some of the dishes were better before the remodel, some were better afterwards.  It seems even more popular now than it did before the remodel (consider making reservations).  Post-remodel, more items seem to be battered and fried than pre-remodel.  The place still looks rather plain despite the remodel.  The dishes have plenty of sauce, probably too much sauce, but the sauces are good and plenty flavorful.  There have been fights over who would take home the leftover sauce.\n\nIt's really a three star restaurant but two five star dishes, reasonable prices, generous portions, and the status as an old family favorite earn San Wang an extra star.  Get the clams in their special sauce with jalapenos and dry fried chicken (my father's favorite, it's loaded with ample garlic and chili peppers, crispy outside, tender inside, explosive flavor).  It seems like you get far less chicken than you used to though.  \n\nThe dry fried string beans were a family favorite too, but they're coated in some type of batter now and they weren't before.  Some of the green beans were stuck together and they didn't use the Chinese long beans.  They do have a great, garlicky flavor though.  The spicy seafood noodle soup with hand-pulled noodles had lots of seafood, including clams, sea cucumber, etc.  The broth is decent but not amazing.  I could do without ordering it.   I think we had hot pepper shrimp - it was deep fried and goopy, definitely a disappointment.  The mabo tofu is okay but not special.  I used to like this dish better before the remodel.\n\nPortions are generous, the food comes out in a blink of an eye even when they're busy, and the prices are reasonable enough to even please my father.  It's better to come here with a large group (make reservations).\n\nThey don't give you oranges or fortune cookies at the end of the meal.  Too bad.

This sauce-brown and goopy- is not too aesthetically pleasing in my opinion..but it compliments the noodles perfectly!! The sauce contains bits of onion, zucchini, meat(I want to say pork?), and some shrimp...TRY IT!!! the only thing is, the sauce is pretty oily, and so a lot of the time I'll get super full after half the bowl...which leaves enough to take home for a second meal! :)\n\nI also LOVE the kimchi they give you here after you order. When I ate here recently, we asked for a second helping of the kimchi..and devoured it. The waitress came buy our table, said,\"oh, you like it!\" and returned to our table with a bowl twice as big as the two previous ones, filled with kimchi. Look at her go, gaining customer service points :)", "author": "Z A."}

Therefore, that's what I ordered when I came in recently, mainly because I was walking by and they had World Series Game 6 showing on their TV.\n\nI can at least appreciate the quality of the noodle and the effort they put into it.  The noodles do taste fresh.  In past years, when I came with a friend, I've even witnessed them pounding dough in the kitchen making the noodles from scratch.\n\nSimilar to San Tung Restaurant, they give you kimchi when they sit you down.

It was too thick for this dish and just warm, not thin and steamy soft which meant it cracked trying to wrap it. They use to use thin wrappers you can buy frozen.

Too much/many canned vegetables. \n\nStir-fry noodles - The hand-pulled noodles really stood out in its texture. The stir-fry version had more flavor than the soup version and used more fresh veggies. \n\nI think this would be a pretty good place for someone watching their diet---all the dishes I ordered, no matter how guilty it sounded, came out \"healthily\" prepared.

Also what was so annoying was yes the restaurant is busy and yes there is a line, but why do the waiters have to rush SO BAD and execute their service like they were running for their lives? I have never seen servers so rushed, so abrupt, and looked like they were so in a hurry with everythng that htey wre about to die.

So, apparently I've been missing out in all the 27 years of my life. \n\nCame here on a Friday at around 9:30PM after HH at Izakaya Lounge. \n\nFOOD: \n*Starter: Kimchee (Free) - Not like the typical Korean kimchee. SW's version is less acidic and less spicy, probably because it isn't fermented as long. It was good though. \n*Dry Chicken Wings (2x): MmMmMm. Hot, crunchy, moist, spicy, sweet, garlicky = Enough said. Just as good as San Tung's! \n*Dry Fried Squid (2x): HOLY MOLY! I've never had chinese calamari done this way. On the bottom of the platter was a sauce made with soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, garlic, and jalapeno. Then, they topple it with calamari that's light, crisp, and tender. This way the sauce doesn't make the calamari soggy....so simple, but genius. \n*Clams in Black Bean Sauce (2x): The clams were a good decent size and were super tender. Normally, black bean sauce can be very salty, but in this dish it wasn't; you can actually \"taste\" the clams. \n*Noodles in Black Bean Sauce: The home-made noodles were done al-dente. Not a huge fan of black bean sauce in general, so this dish was just ok for me. \n*Seafood Noodle Soup: Didn't try this dish, but there was huge amounts of seafood (shrimp, scallop, calamari, etc). \n*Peashoots w/ Garlic (2x): Peashoots were super fresh and wasn't overcooked, so it was still crisp. There was just enough garlic to add the garlic flavor w/o it being to overpowering. \n*Dry Fried Green Beans (2x): MmMmM...another good dish. But, then again all anything fried is good though right? The green beans were lightly fried and then tossed with sauce soy sauce vinegar concoction which balanced out the oiliness of the beans. \n\nSERVICE (-1 Star): Sub par. We arrived at 9:30 and the restaurant closes at 10 PM. When we were ordering the waitress was very impatient, kept rolling her eyes, and pointed to her watch several times. No surprises here, I'm use to having rude service in chinese restaurant unless you're in PF Chang's which of course is NOT considered a chinese restaurant. So, you go there for the good food and not the service. \n\nAs you know, San Tung can get very crowded, so SW is a great alternative to go to. \n\nBTW, the food here is dirt CHEAP. We had 2 orders of everything except for the soup and it came out to $11/person including tip for 10 people. WOOT! \n\nI'll be back... :)", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I wasn't a huge fan of this kind of noodles before, but my husband loves it and noodle texture is extremely important to him.  We would frequent Chef Wang in South San Francisco for their  jajangmyun which my husband thought was the best in the city, so I thought I'd take him here to compare as San Wang makes their own noodles from scratch.  \n\nHe was truly a happy camper and thought these noodles were the best in SF so far (haven't tried that many yet, hah).\n\nAlong with sharing the jajangmyun, we ordered a small hot and sour soup, and potstickers, all for approximately $22 + tip.  They give you a free bowl of kimchee to start with.\n\n4.5 stars - jajangmyun\n\n3.5 stars - The hot and sour soup, it was decently good.  It had a good spice to it and right amount of vinegar, but had too much of the shrimp, black mushrooms, and bamboo shoots in it.  Some people would love the value of having the extra amount of ingredients in it, but I like the soup and had to keep picking off the items and putting them aside because I had too much of it already.\n\n2 stars - The potstickers - We were hoping to get the best tasting pot stickers ever, but as we were picking them off the plate, they would fall apart because there were small cracks in the dough.  Small detail, but aside from that too, the dough texture was a little pasty.  It tasted okay, but I would most likely skip on ordering the pot stickers there next time around. \n\nThank you san wang for having the noodles taste the same as it did 9 years ago.  I can still hold my head up high without another \"I told you things you've had years ago won't taste good anymore\" and can trust at least some of my recommendations from the past.", "author": "W.

I'd have to say it's interesting to see how the Yelpers in SF view San Wang vs. San Tung, given the copious number of reviews on these two hwagyo heavyweights in our City.  Having been to San Tung many times, I thought it'd be helpful to also look at how San Wang would measure up in the hwagyo department.  I've also heard that the Korean Consulate of San Francisco in Pacific Heights is partial to San Wang, so I thought that this endorsement would bode pretty well for San Wang.  Hmmm..meh.  I've experienced better!\n\n1.  SW KIMCHI BETTER THAN ST:  there was no waiting crowds in front of San Wang, so I thought that would be indicative of the popularity and quality of the place.  However being an open diner, I came in anyways and was promptly seated.  They bring kimchi, but no onions.  That's ok, considering that San Wang is in the middle of Jtown.  Actually, their kimchi tastes slightly more right, crunchy in the right notes..just about right in terms of doneness.  ST's always tastes a little more underdone.  Either way though, both places' kimchi tastes shelf-ready and not homemade.\n\n2.  JAJANGMYUN (SW NOT AS GOOD AS ST) following my JJM standard:\n\n*  Ratio of sauce to noodles:  SW's is a little less, and there is no garnish of cucumbers here.  I don't taste much onions here.\n\n*  Vegetables, meat plentiful:  there isn't much in the way of identifiable vegetables, and the server said they only had it in pork.  Couldn't they make it just as easily with beef or shrimp?  \n\n*  Texture, taste and color of sauce:  was slightly lumpy, and had a slight sheen of oil on the top.  Extremely bland, and the color is off-putting.  The pork flavor doesn't add much to the sauce.\n\n*  Noodle quality and bite:  tastes slightly off, overcooked and surprisingly gummy.\n\n*  Balance of sauce to noodles:  ST leans towards being more generous in noodles.  \n\n3.  JAMPONG (SW  UNDERPERFORMS COMPARED TO ST):  the jampong at SW has a harsh ginger aftertaste, leaning towards heavy and flavoring everything including the soup.  It also is watery at times, although certainly not as oily as I expected.  The noodles again do not taste as fresh.  I had to add some hot chili sauce and kimchi to kick up the flavor, and that is a negative.\n\n4.  GAMPONGGI (SW  NOT AS GOOD AS ST):  the gamponggi is not as glazed in the rich garlic sauce and peppers, nor does it glisten in color.  The color of the crunchy outside is rich though, and it on appearance seems appealing.  However, the garlic scallion sauce on top doesn't add much to the flavor, although every bite is certainly crunchy.  It is dry, and often at times you'd have to add kimchi with your chicken to add moisture.  Dipping it in chili sauce may save it from the not too intense garlic sauce, which isn't particularly generous either.\n\n5.  IN SUMMARY WHY SW IS NOT A MUST VISIT:  overall, SW doesn't perform as well as I thought it would in the hwagyo trinity.  =P  I'm extremely underwhelmed despite the hype, and I'd definitely would not recommend SW to anyone looking for hwagyo food with flavor.  However, I did see some Chinese Chinese (not Chinese Korean) and Filipinos ordering the dry garlic fried black pepper crab on the tables behind me, which looked delicious.  Perhaps SW's forte is in Chinese Chinese food is the genre here, rather than hwagyo after my experience here.", "author": "JC K."}

That's always a winning combination with my family. \n\nAlthough my entire family of 6 + 3 significant others = 9 was not here that night, the 4 of us that were there sure ate like a large party! My dad frequents this place often with his co-workers for lunch, so he knew the good stuff. We ordered the following: Dry fried chicken, clams, chili shrimp, gai laan (chinese broccoli) and their special handmade noodle dish/chow mein. Before we could even finish our first cup of tea or our first plate of complimentary kim chee, our dishes started flowing out of the kitchen and onto our table!\n\nThe noodles were first - a little oily, but still better than your average chow mein dish. The dry fried chicken is one of their specialties, and I can taste why. The chicken was very crispy and hardly dripping with oil, unlike some fried chicken I've had at other Chinese restaurants. And the sweet and spicy sauce with jalapenos that they served on top of this dish was a yummy compliment! \n\nLarge pieces of fried shrimp covered in another sweet and spicy red sauce had just the right kick for my taste buds. The clams came out on a large dish and were covered with oyster sauce (?) They were OK - a little too much sauce for me. But that didn't stop me from eating about 15 of them! And the Chinese version of one of my favorite vegetables made me feel a little better about stuffing myself with carbs (we had steam rice, too) and fried food. \n\nThis place is minimally decorated, and only has one dining area. But the staff is friendly and the food is quick. We spent about $56 bucks for a dinner for 4 (not including tip), and had tons of leftovers. \n\nBeware: parking is difficult.

San Tung is a place of mountains and cold weather so of course warm foods that are starchy, soupy and spicy are more common in the diet than summery dishes like vegetables and meats.\n\nWith that said, San Wang's is definitely not bad if you're in the area and wanting a hearty bowl of hand-pulled noodle soup and tasty chicken wings. I disagree (respectfully, since I'm classy like that) with those who claim that San Wang's chicken wings can't hold a candle to San Tung's. I don't think the two are really comparable. San Tung's chicken wings are fried and then doused in a honey sweet glaze while San Wang's are batter fried and served way crunchier than San Tung's version with chopped up garlic and green onions in a soy sauce-y/garlicky sauce. Being more of a savory than sweets fan (well, maybe when it comes to meats), I actually prefer San Wang's.\n\nThe hand pulled noodles are ridiculous. In a good way. That's where it ends, though. If I could somehow just have, literally, the fresh, chewy noodles from San Wang's - yes, sans the broth, sans the garnishes, just the naked noodles, and have them served in San Tung's soups, I would seriously go to TOWN with that badass bowl of noodles right there. So it's probably made obvious now that San Wang's soups are lacking and a little more on a bland side, so my advice is to always order it spicy and not mild because the spices really lend to almost all the flavor of the soups.\n\nThe dumplings (jiao zhi) have a more homemade essence to them with the thicker skin, but are still tasty. Unless your Chinese mom can make those in her sleep . . . then you should pass.\n\nSo, in short - get the noodles (spicy version, always), get the wings if you aren't used to the San Tung's variety or prefer savory/garlicky over the sweet. Oh, and good luck with parking. But hey, know that there's hardly ever a wait at San Wang's and that's something that San Tung's definitely can't top. :)", "author": "Betty W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-19", "description": "Very good Korean-influenced Chinese food. Milder and more flavorful than the food at the cursed Cantonese restaurants that plague the city. There is absolutely nothing wrong with good Cantonese food; unfortunately, the kind that prevails in the city is the wrong kind: oily, deep fried, poor ingredient quality, uncreative. The same can be said of most American food, I suppose - and maybe these Cantonese restaurants are simply cooking for that audience. But I digress.\n\nSan Wang is known for its dry-fried series of dishes (beef, shrimp, chicken, etc.) Dry fried beef is the best. They also have great soups - try the San Wang soup noodles or Ta Lo noodles. You can taste the clams in the broth, the ingredients are fresh, quantity is plentiful, and you don't feel thirsty or sleepy after eating. That's because they go easy on the MSG (or they don't use MSG at all - I did not detect any).\n\nService is decent as well, and so is the price. We have been going here for years and will keep coming back.", "author": "W. T."}

I was confused since it was a pretty ordinary looking Chinese restaurant with bright florescent lights.  Then I learned it was run by Koreans and was a sorta hybrid Chinese/Korean restaurant.\n\nSo let me get to the interesting thing right off.  They have this weird spirit (hard liquor) that I've never heard of.  I think my friend pronounced it \"coran joo\" or something.  It came in this ceramic thing and it was warm.  At first I thought, \"i dunno, Chinese moonshine - i'm scared....\"  You know - it was actually pretty good.  Had a slight herbal taste to it, but also had a slight flavor that I find in a really good scotch.  So I definitely recommend trying it - I thought it was pretty well crafted and not weird at all.\n\nThe food was also pretty good.  Kinda' reminded me of this family-style Chinese place in the Sunset called \"8 Immortals\" which is also pretty good for that type of food.\n\nAnyway - yeah - recommended if you're in that Chinese food mood or want to try that \"coran joo.\"", "author": "Russel H."}

Kams gave you lots more, but San Wangs had better quality, hand pulled noodles, and stayed open till after 10pm.

Portions are still fairly generous. Their Hot & Sour Soup is awesome, and I don't particularly care for Hot Sour soup. I like their Chicken with Double Mushrooms and the Clams in Blk Bean Sauce. But you have to try their hand pulled noodles in Spicy Plum Sauce. Hand pulled means made from scratch, by hand! I can't explain it... you gotta watch reruns of Yan Can Cook to check it out. It's also pretty cool that they give you some free kim chee to get the appetite going.\nOK, so it IS in Japantown, so prices are a bit high, but not outrageous. It's a little cramped in there, but the service is pretty good.

Must be decent to survive there. \n\nThe food was actually pretty good, big portions, fresh veggies and seafood. I liked that they added mushrooms to all the meat and veggie dishes (that's because I'm a big mushroom fan). The salted spicy spareribs were delicious! It wasn't a fried pork chip like it is at some places. It was fried just enough that it was still moist inside, tossed with some green onions and oil, yumm, good flavor. Clams and honey walnut prawns were a hit with the bf's fam. I'm allegrice to seafood, but if they said it was good, so it must be good :)\nI would come back again.

This afternoon, my friend and I went to San Wang to grab an early dinner.  I usually get one of the hand-pulled noodle dishes, so it's nice to bring a San Wang virgin along to see what else is on the menu.\n\nMy friend is a big fan of wonton soup, so she went with a small size.  It was large enough to feed one person as a main dish or two people as a side.  It was loaded with wontons, shrimp, chicken, broccoli, carrots and mushrooms ... quite healthy and fresh.  There was a bit of intrigue for a moment when we tried to figure out what sorts of meat were used in the wonton (we decided it was BBQ or roasted pork).  Overall, it was acceptable.\n\nWe ordered steamed and pan-fried pot-stickers.  If you order steamed, they give you eight (8) pieces.  If you order fried, they punish you for choosing something unhealthy by giving you only six (6) pieces.    Don't really know if that is why, but those are the real amounts that come out for each order.  Dumplings were okay, but nothing to write home about.  If you're trying to talk yourself out of getting an appetizer, please know that these are absolutely missable.  Get something else.\n\nMy noodles with black bean sauce was pretty good, but definitely not as great as the stuff I grew up with or had during my visits to Korea.  The noodles had a nice firm and chewy texture with an appropriate thickness to accommodate the type of sauce I ordered.  \n\nThe bean sauce itself was pretty decent, taste-wise, but sort of a let-down as far and quality and variety of ingredients.  The actual \"ingredients\" of the sauce consisted of 3 shrimp, loads of onion, and a smattering of chewy, dry pork nuggets.  Not too impressive.\n\nA prior reviewer did make a very true point about how one gets what one pays for.

THE BEST. san tung is a far second to these wings and here are the reasons why: \n\nthe wings are not sticky sweet, they're fried CRISP, with lots of scallions and garlic and a soy-garlic flavor marinated into the meat and bones, not coated like they do at san tung. you don't feel like you have to visit the dentist after dining here. there is little sugar in these wings, if at all.\n\nthe jajangmyun is decent (i still prefer the chinese version more with ground pork and braised tofu pieces), and most of the noodle dishes use hand-pulled noodles.\n\ni'm so lucky i live only 3 blocks away from these folks. it's very good eats for a j-town chinese/korean establishment.", "author": "May T."}

Arrived cranky and hungry after walking around all morning, and left feeling content and full. Opted to order family style entree dishes instead of taking advantage of their lunch menu. Jajangmyun, Happy Family, Sweet&Sour Beef, and Mapo Tofu. OMG. The flavorful, generous portions totally made up for the atmosphere.

I never thought that I'd ever come to Japantown for Chinese food, but my parents and I stumbled upon this place one Sunday, and I have been a fan ever since.\n\nMy favorites:\n\n- Dried fried chicken: These are so bad for you, but so sinfully good, especially with all the minced garlic and scallions found in the dish.\n- Dumplings: These are filled with pork and tons of chives (beware of those after-meal burps!).  But the best thing about them is the handmade dumpling skins.  \n- San Wang spicy noodle soup (popularly known in Korean as \"jjampong\"): It is so very comforting on a cold day.  Their spicy soup is filled with perfectly al dente hand-pulled noodles and tons of goodies like clams, shrimp, squid, sea cucumber (the only not-so-goody), pork, mushrooms, wood ear fungus, napa cabbage, and zucchini.  \n- Noodles with plum sauce (popularly known in Chinese as \"zhajiang mian\" and in Korean as \"jajangmyeon\"): I'm not sure why they call it plum sauce because it's really a black soybean sauce.  They use their awesome hand-pulled noodles in this dish, and the sauce is not too overpowering.\n- San Wang Chow Mein: This is exactly like the jjampong (ingredients-wise), except without the spicy soup, and the flavor is full of the heat of the wok. \n\nThis place can be packed at the oddest hours when you would not think it would be (e.g. 3pm on a Sunday afternoon and 9:30pm on a Friday night).

I thought aprons were white but not here, they need to bleach them!!", "author": "Gavy J."}

I really didn't care if a place had a good service or no service, because I go for the food. However, no amount of good food will get me back to rude wait staff. There is a difference between no service and rude/bad service.  My friend and I had ordered 3 entrees for lunch, we were never asked if everything was alright. When I requested for a side dish of radish, the wait staff in a very unprofessional toned told me to \"wait a minute\", of course it was never brought to me.  I guess the place thinks that big portion will bring people in.  For good food and service, I would still go to the Hong Kong Lounge on Geary.", "author": "bill w."}

Finally, a few nights ago, I did just that.  Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs with another night's worth of food; the service is very friendly, prices very reasonable, and atmosphere clean though no frills.  The water dumplings (boiled dumplings filled with shrimp and chives) topped with a little soy sauce are excellent; just the right amount of gossamerness with succulent shrimp and subtle chives.  The dry fried chicken is excellent with a light glaze of a sauce of black pepper, chili, and garlic.  The shrimp with black bean sauce are succulent with one of the most flavorful black bean sauces ever and fresh green onions and bell peppers.  The steamed rice is firm not soggy.  The plum sauce noodles are to die for; hand pulled fresh goodness of just the right amount of gossamerness and chewiness you would expect in northern style noodles.  The complimentary kim chi is an excellent spicy, salty, crunchy number.  So, for excellent Shandong cuisine at reasonable prices with friendly service in a clean yet no frills atmosphere, Sam Wang's cannot be beat.  keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}

We ordered the dry fried chicken, dry fried scallops, mongolian beef and curry chicken. Service was quick , food was really good, prices very decent and place looks great...only gripe is that the table for 4 is small, we had to stack plates' edges!--or we were all pigs for ordering so damn much! Oh yeah, hot and sour soup is off the hook!", "author": "Steve K."}

The mongolian beef and dry fried squid.  both are great dishes and I leave here with garlicky breath.", "author": "kenny l."}

I love the baby shrimp with pepper sauce and their green mussels. I am currently going into withdrawal since they have been closed for so long for remodeling. Their phone message says they are reopening the end of June, but here it is the end of July and still no  opening. I can't wait any longer :(", "author": "Frisco F."}
