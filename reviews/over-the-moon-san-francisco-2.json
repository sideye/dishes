We placed an order through Caviar for delivery at 9:08pm. It arrived at 9:39pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Mint Chip Ice Cream: Mint ice cream with chocolate chips ($3.70), Pint (+$4.75)\n*Coffee Caramel Crunch Ice Cream: Coffee, caramel, and chocolate chips ($3.70), Pint (+$4.75), Waffle cone on the side (+$0.55)\n*6 Cookies: Chocolate Chip, Cookies and Cream x2, Snickerdoodle\u00a0x2, Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip ($10.50)\n\nI got the mint chip while the roommate got the coffee caramel. The mint chip was minty and refreshing. I did find the consistency a little too soft though as it wasn't as creamy as I like. A little airier than normal. The roomie's coffee caramel was richer and thicker. Though it had a very milky flavor. I wanted there to be more black coffee flavor. It almost tasted like a coffee with too much cream. We were really looking forward to the cookies. Unfortunately, we never got them. Not sure if it was Over the Moon or Caviar's fault, but it made our dessert less satisfying. And we couldn't get them redelivered as they were closed by the time we figured out how to report it.\n\nGood ice cream, but I really wanted those cookies.

This was a little gem of a ice cream shop i stumbled upon while being out in SF this past weekend. They have a great range of flavors, which you can taste test before hand, and the best part is the cookie cups they have. You basically choose your flavor, and can get it in a chocolate chip, snicker-doodle or oreo cup. (*Yes the cookie is hard like everyone complained about, but if it was soft your ice cream would most likely drip or melt through it. Plus it softens up by the time you get to your last bite.) I tried the Oreo Coffee ice cream with the chocolate chip cup, a delicious treat all for $5. Next time you are in the neighborhood give this place a try, the staff is welcoming with a smile, and who can ever complain about good ice cream. \n\nP.S. - They have a area in the back you can sit and enjoy your treat as well, and take cute pictures for Instagram and your Yelp review :)", "author": "Vanessa J."}

That's what I come here for (and as I always tell people, I don't even have a sweet tooth). I always order a single scoop of the honey lavender in a chocolate chip cookie cup. The honey lavender is sweeter than I prefer my ice cream, but the lavender is potent and floral-y enough to balance out the taste for me. The cookie cup is light and crispy around the edges, and then as you get to the center of the cookie, it's so chewy -- just like frozen cookie dough! It's a revelation. :)\n \nOnly complaint is the high price for the cookie cups -- it's $6 for a single scoop in a cookie cup. That's just a bit more than I'd like to pay for ice cream.

Normally I'm hesitant on trying more than three flavors, but they actually encouraged me to try more to make sure I'm making the absolute right decision since their flavors do rotate a decent amount.\n\nI decided to get a double scoop of earl grey and honey lavender together.

Move on over CREAM, you've got some sugary competition! Kind of. CREAM, in its various incarnations across the Bay Area, is still far more easily accessible than Over the Moon out in Marina, and sometimes convenience does win out over quality (instant ramen, anyone?).\n\nWhile my friend ordered their coffee caramel crunch with a chocolate chip cookie on the side, I went with their pistachio and a double fudge on the side (neither of us were willing to do a full ice cream sandwich for our first meal of the day). I was initially a little skeptical about the savory and sweet combination, but it worked out fantastically well: the slightly salty pistachio ice cream offset the super sweet double fudge (and chocolate chip half I snagged from my friend) nicely.\n\nTheir ice cream alone can't stand up to the likes of Humphry and Mr & Mrs, but was definitely tastier than that of CREAM. Their cookies, on the other hand, were quite tasty on their own, though a little inconsistent in texture: the chocolate chip was nice and soft, while the double fudge was harder. Whether this was due to higher demand and thus, faster turnover for the former, or just a matter of how the cookies are made, I'm uncertain.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The venue's pretty small, with slightly higher counter seating up front, and a few regular two tops in the back, that are perfectly accessible.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out.", "author": "Johnny W."}

My only suggestion for improvement is adding some sort of ventilation, and a bathroom for customers. \nHopefully I will make my way back to the Marina soon and have some more Over the Moon.", "author": "Fernanda S."}

The toppings were so stingily spread, I can actually count the sprinkles on my daughter's scoop.  I ordered a scoop of the butterscotch, there was no butterscotch flavor at all.  It was all sugar.  It was so sweet, it made me thirsty.  After quarter way through, I couldn't take it anymore.  It was tossed in the garbage.  I don't think I've ever done that with ice cream!\nWhat also made it worst is the service at this place.  The Asian girl at the ice cream bar had a total attitude.

I sampled the earl grey, honey lavender, and cookie-something-or-other.\n\nI chose the earl grey because it wasn't as sweet as the other two and it REALLY tasted like earl grey tea.\n\nThey give you plenty of ice cream in the cups and the price is reasonable. I noticed that they used real earl grey tea leaves in the ice cream as the ice cream was really grainy and infused with tea leaves. \n\nThe place itself is a little unorganized and you don't know where the line starts. Luckily there weren't too many people at this late hour.\n\nOverall I think this is my favorite earl grey ice cream in the area, but I didn't enjoy the other flavors as much. My date didn't like his samples (that I didn't try) enough to order his own scoop.", "author": "Martina M."}

If you're not hungry, I'd definitely recommend trying to split the sandwich with someone else as the cookie + scoop of ice cream was literally only cents cheaper than what the whole sandwich would have been. To Over the Moon's credit, though, the ice cream was tasty and old-fashioned -- I had the coffee crunch, which went well with the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nI'd come back for regular ice cream if I'm already in the area, but otherwise, the Bay Area has better ice cream and ice cream sandwich options.", "author": "Kelly R."}

I settled on Over the Moon since they were close and we wanted to be able to share with our furbaby. \n\nAfter finding a park - we walked down to the shop and immediately I noticed a small ice shop that had a small town look and feel. The service was good - friendly. I tasted the lavender / honey which was okay and then the vanilla bean which was again okay. I settled on snickerdoodle cookies which are my favorites with vanilla bean ice cream. I then went outside to watch my furbaby and my husband picked his selection. \n\nWe sat in front of the shop and enjoyed the treats we selected. My bulldog loved the vanilla bean but he loves ice cream because he only gets 2 spoons worth as a treat occasionally.\n\nMy experience is this a \"Cream\" like place with a SF vibe to it. While they were inexpensive the portions were definitely very small compared to Cream. Was it very good? I was left with a feeling, \" Not terrible and not impressive\".

I ordered two scoops of ice cream. One was chocolate mint and the other funfetti which were filled into a waffle cone. Very delicious both flavors. And the customer service was good. Only two factors that I did not approve was the very crowded/small seating area. And the limited selection on ice cream. Regardless of limited ice cream selection it was still made up with their other delicious flavors. Overall it checks out pretty ok.", "author": "Mariela B."}

I sampled their whiskey praline and went for their ice cream sandwiches, using chocolate chip cookie and the whiskey praline ice cream.  Pretty inexpensive for house-made ice cream.  If you didn't want the sandwich, they also have other options like ice cream on cup or waffle cone , and 2 - 3 frozen yogurt options, for those who prefer yogurt.  Great place to chill esp. on a 2nd (in a row) warm San Francisco night.  For those who enjoy simple, more \"standard\" ice cream flavors with a just a bit of variety, this is your place to be.  \n\nThe place itself was comfortable and brightly lit; if you wanted to sit and enjoy your ice cream inside, there are some small tables towards the back of the shop.

Cinnamon smores was amazing- like a churro and a smores cookie combined to make the most heavenly flavor that was both sweet and spicy from the cinnamon. I also had Oreo cookie, not to be confused with cookies n cream, which is ice cream made with the cookie part of the Oreo & swirled with the white creamy oreo frosting. The only thing I dislike about Oreos is the texture of the cookie and this completely solved my problem- plus it gave me a straight shot of the amazing Oreo frosting I love so much. My boyfriend had caramel cookie dough which he claims is his new favorite ice cream flavor. We also got to try one of their freshly baked snickerdoodles, which was perfectly soft on the inside with just a little crisp on the exterior. A perfect accompaniment to any ice cream experience!

This place is the best of both worlds, you not only get original old-fashioned ice cream but also, you guess it, warm, delicious home-made cookies. I've had this place so many times it's become my go-to ice cream shop. Not to mention the service is so great, everyone is always super nice. This shop reminds me of the Mid-West, not sure why.", "author": "Cindy G."}

My friends and I stumbled onto this place after dinner and went inside. It was busy and the server looked a bit overwhelmed. After 10 or so minutes, I finally got my ice cream. I chose Snickerdoodle and Pumpkin Spice Latte. I should note that the flavors were good (although a little sweet when compared to other places). The texture, however, was unappealing to say the least. When I began to eat it, the ice cream stuck to my spoon and fell back into the cup- it had a texture similar to glue or melted cheese that was both stringy and thick like caramel. This ruined any potential that the flavor had. I couldn't stomach more than two spoonfuls before throwing it away. I would likely not come back and waste another $5. I recommend Bi-Rite on Divisadero or Smitten in Hayes Valley for your next ice cream fix- the two are consistently excellent.", "author": "Dominic L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-29", "description": "We stopped here today while in the neighborhood for a trio of the ice cream sandwiches with some friends.  They make the ice cream AND the cookies in house, from scratch (unlike Cream, which can tastes a bit like grocery-store cookie because I don't think they do).  I am a complete sucker for interesting flavors so had a lot of fun putting together flavors (earl grey and lavender honey on snicker doodle really works well! So does cake batter and chocolate on chocolate chip cookie).  Cookies were soft and amazing.  Also, the staff were super friendly and so helpful.  They are also very patient with samples as I worked through what my masterpiece ice cream sandwiches would be composed of!  Cannot wait to go back.", "author": "Corinna M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-05-17", "description": "Very disappointed. This place used to have One of the best ice creams in the neighborhood and friendly, good service. Today I came here for a usual weekend visit. The store was empty and when we came in the attendant didn't acknowledged us it was like we're not there. I had to ask her to place an order and even then she kept doing what she was doing for a minute or two, which didn't seem important or urgent. My wife ordered the pistachio that she always orders but it tasted sweeter than normal, and it had a different texture than usual, not as creamy. So we informed the attendant, Jasmine, explained it to her and asked gently if she could exchange it for us. She told us that she could, but she'd have to charge. Her bad attitude went on and it simply destroyed our experience. We ended up not eating our ice cream and will never come back. It's sad to see a good establishment in the neighborhood go to waste.", "author": "Rogerio B."}

I kept telling my girlfriend about it and she started getting annoyed. I was so pleasantly surprised as I had gone to other more well known ice cream shops around town looking for the exact experience that was offered here. First off the ice cream is cheap, like $2.30 for a large scoop. The taste and texture is off the charts good. The coffee crunch is amazing. And considering my main squeeze when it comes to ice cream, their chocolate is just what I was looking for. Gets an A+ from this ice cream enthusiast.", "author": "Paul P."}
