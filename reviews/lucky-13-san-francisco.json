As I've gotten older, my bar-going days/nights have dropped significantly. The times of going 2 - 3 nights a week have long passed. But every now and then, I remember how much I loved doing it.\n\nI was getting my car serviced in the area and came through to the Lucky a little after 11:00 am. The joint was empty so we had it to ourselves. We had our first round in the courtyard but it was a windy day, so it was the only one. The next few rounds occurred inside. The courtyard is awesome on warm, sunny days or warm nights.  As the day wore on it began to fill up, but there were plenty of open seats. There are plenty of TVs that have the games on and you can keep up with local teams.\n\nI only intended to have a couple, but when you're with good buddies and they're buying, it would be rude to decline.\n\nLucky 13, you are my Batcave and Xavier Mansion.", "author": "Rich H."}

This was across the street from where we were shopping, so we decided to check it out on Saturday, September 16th around 6:45pm. Our party of four easily found a table against the wall, opposite the bar.\n\nI believe everyone got a beer here. I probably got a Stella Artois as that is one of my go to beers. (Unless they have Blue Moon.) Judging from the pic I took and what I ordered all day, I'm pretty sure I got a Stella. (Can you tell I don't really drink beer? Or I had a little more to drink than I should have?) I didn't pay, so not sure of the pricing. They have a huge beer menu here, so I'm sure you can find anything your heart desires. Or at least something similar. The mood here is like a bustling dive bar. The lighting, very dark. \n\nNice place to throw back a beer or two. Had no idea they had a patio outside. May have to come back to check that out. I love outdoor seating on a nice day!\n\nNote: Lucky 13 is cash only. I do believe they have an ATM inside, just in case.", "author": "Elena N."}

The outside seating is dog-friendly and smoker friendly. If you have problems with either, it's better to stay inside.\n\nI had a good time here with a group of seven people. There was a wide selection of beers. The beers that I tried were the death & taxes, fieldwork IPA, and something else similar to a Belgian that I can't remember the name of.

SF is like a maze...tons of hidden gems but you wouldn't know about them unless you spent your time walking around and exploring the area!\n\nI came here for my first time on a Friday night and fell in love. It's a chill local bar but it's the people and the presence that make it a solid 4 stars! Yup it's dark once you walk in but it definitely helps set up a vibe of a nice drink and some relaxation! Listen up drinkers while I tell you the top reasons why I will be coming back to this bar:\n\n* Calling all dog lovers!! This place is truly dog friendly! They even have an icon dog that sits by the door and patiently waits for your arrival. Don't forget to say hello upon walking in!\n\n* I am like 60% sure that this bar is family owned but if it's definitely a good partnership. It's a lovely lady and nice gentleman that work the bar area. They are totally friendly and I had no problem receiving services from them although I was a newcomer. \n\n* Great outside patio area! Yes, the bar is dark at times but you don't to stay in that inside. They have a great outside patio where you can hang out, enjoy the nice breeze and meet new people! Check it out when you go!\n\n* OKAY...This is the kicker....they have POPCORN!!! Yes, a popcorn maker in the dive bar, this blew my mind when I saw this! So I can have a lovely drink with some popcorn?! OmG! I was sold when I had seen this! \n\n* They have all the alcohol options you can imagine!

Friendly bartenders pointed out beer list above, bottles and on tap. Cash only. ATM in back. Bathroom up front (which I hear is an adventure). \n\nBartender was nice enough to give me a complimentary refill on a pint of Lambic Cassis (black currant) to show me how my first, blended at his insistence with a lighter beer to balance out the sweetness, compared. He was right, the second, straight-up Lambic was uber-sweet, though tasty in small amounts. I was amused at his first blending offer because, channeling my dad, he said \"Oh no, that is WAY too sweet. If you drink a whole pint, that'll ruin your dinner.\"\n\nWalls covered in very cool, trippy posters. I laughed at the handwritten \"NO GOOGLE GLASSES\" sign above the bar. Dog also spotted on bar next to owner's beer. Dogs also wandered in who've seen it all and didn't really care if you petted them but half-heartedly sniffed your offered hand. \n\nOnly caution I'd add is if you are sensitive to mold, stay the heck away from this place. The smell will hit you in the nose right when you walk in, and then settle in the back of your throat like a wet trout and then only slooooowly become less obvious the longer you stay and more alcohol you drink. Maybe they need a few dehumidifiers? \n\nOther than that, cheers to the quintessential dive bar!", "author": "Sarah J."}

Clean it up?\" And proceeded to be very rude to him and went over to the girls and began to harass them. \n\nShe proceeded to tease her and bring out a nasty mop instead of dry towels to clean up the spill and said \"This is only going to make it worse.\" And started saying that she's fallen in the bar all the time and never complained.

Maybe another time and probably bottles only. The bathroom, holy crap! DON'T bother! They were disgusting, stunk terribly and I think I might have caught something while in there. HA HA!

It was one of the first places that I visited after moving to SF, two years ago. I always had a decent time, and rep'd it to my friends and strangers visiting the city.\n\nTonight, I took my girlfriend and my new roommate for the first time, and it was awful. At 1:30 (just after we'd ordered our first beer) they told us that everyone needed to \"[expletive delted] leave, now!\" There were no fights or other altercations. It was simply weird, and rude. They came to our table, and started cussing at us, with no negative responses form us. Mind you -- we had only ONE drink before arriving at this bar, and were very sober. \n\nAs we left, I asked if I could finish my beer, and use the restroom. I was told this was okay, but that I still needed to \"get the [expletive deleted] out, with everyone else!\" This was fine, for the most part; aside from the super rude service... and we tipped pretty well.\n\nAs I approached the restroom, a man intercepted me and tried to grab the beer in my hand. I asked him if everything was okay, and he told me to, \"get the [expletive deleted] out.\" I told him I was just trying to use the restroom, and it was 1:30; everything was alright. He then grabbed the beer can (still half full) and crush it in my hands. I told him this was battery (having nearly three years of legal education). He told me, \"NO, it's not; get the [expletive deleted] out our bar!\" Again, I asked him what was wrong, and why we couldn't just handle this like adults. Nobody, let alone myself was causing harm.\n\nUltimately, they even followed us outside and cursed and basically talked s-it. \n\nI will NEVER recommend this place to anyone else. I'm a combat veteran, and third year law student... even with that and being SUPER nice, I've never been treated with such disrespect in my life.

The new bald bartender ignores people that aren't his buddies, lets the bar sit in complete silence until you put money into the jukebox and then turns it off, and pours weak drinks (except for himself and buddies - then it's long pours of Jameson on the house). The bar now closes at 1:25am according to him. But it really closes at 1:10am when he turns off the jukebox *again* and plays crap country music while he staggers out to smoke.

The Lucky 13 bar is not for everyone...it is dark, dingy, and a little edgy, yet so imminently satisfying as a dive.  The bar is really long and I always enjoy looking at the old rock posters on the wall which I think fit the place well.  All kinds of crazy things behind the bar on the shelves and hanging on the wall.  The pool table is pretty decent too although one of the bumpers is really dead.  Still very playable and the cues aren't too bad.\n\nThere is a serve-yourself popcorn maker there at the far end of the bar near the pool table.  Holy movie butter, Batman!  The popcorn was the super unhealthy, mega movie butter version.  I know movie butter versions, but this one was crazy, impregnated with butter (dry, not drizzled).  It went with the drinks so well and was so bad that it was good...so truly good!  It really fit the theme of the place too.  \n\nTook another look at the mermaid paint in the bathroom stall.  It's actually more of a stencil than a line drawing like I originally mentioned.  Not only that, but it looks like someone has been painting and defacing it so it's not that special anymore.  Tried to take a picture, but my phone doesn't have a flash so it was way too dark.  \n\nNot too many places like this in San Francisco...I could totally picture Jim Morrison or maybe the characters from the film Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas drinking in here.  Yeah, they should film an SF version...Fear & Loathing in San Francisco!  This place would definitely be a must.\n\nYears ago, I used to be known for my fun \"around the world in one night dates\", barhopping around (via taxi) from the most upscale of places down to the craziest of dives.

I was literally tippy-toe side-stepping.  I took a deep breath and talked myself out of having a claustrophobia attack.  \n\nI found a small spot on one of the tables to un-load my baked goods and made my way to the bar.  I asked for a \"Crucifix\" and got a really weird look from the bartender.  I instructed:  Raspberry iambic with Guinness. I technically had no idea but someone had told me that's what it was.  He nodded and brought me back a delicious pint of raspberry accented stout.\n\nI grabbed a buddy and on our hunt for the naked lady photo hunt game, we somehow ended up - upstairs.  There's a really cool little area up there that had much more breathing room and pin-ball machines.  I saw the machine I suspected of having the nudey picture game, it was obstructed by what seemed to be a regular.  I asked him, \"Does this have other games on it?\"  He smiled and replied, \"There are tons of games on here\" and began to pull up a menu.  I deviously peeped out, \"Naked lady games?\"  He grinned again and immediately pulled it up for us.  There were already credits in the machine.  We played a few rounds (so fun) and made sure to pay it forward with the credits.\n\nA tamale lady rolled through and another buddy and I formed our own game - \"community tamale\".  It started with a couple of chuckles of how many people were eating out of one particular tamale on the table.  The final tally came about 2 hours later when one last person dug in.  I saw it, yelled over to my buddy across the table, pointed at culprit #8 and smiled.\n\nI never tried the popcorn due to a rumored fable involving already chewed gum.  It was enough to give me the gag-reflex upon any thought of diving into a bowl.  \n\nThe busy nature of this place was a bit much for me.  However, they can't help it if they are popular - right?  Due to the full capacity, a beer was knocked off of a table. The staff came out and cleaned it up right away.\n\nI know for sure that I want to come back on a Wednesday because I hear that is when the stripper pole On the Bar is utilized.", "author": "Jenn N."}

It has a great selection of beer on tap, and as far as I know, you can get cocktails and whatever too.  Also, the jukebox is terrific, there's a lot of space inside, there's free popcorn, and there's a little patio out back.\n\nIts not all that convenient to me most of the time though, so I don't stop by here very often.  \n\nSome might refer to this type of bar as a dive, but I don't see it that way.  It is located right in the middle of one of the most crowded nightlife districts in the Bay Area.  It's usually pretty crowded, and always is on weekend evenings.  It has energy and vitality between those red, candle-lit walls.\n\nStill, it has a certain grimy ambiance to it that generally gets watered down to \"dive bar\" by certain people who don't really appreciate the difference between a place like Lucky 13, which thrives on craft beer and younger, music-oriented patrons, and a sparsely attended place that serves $2 beers out of plastic cups to a mostly older clientele - a true dive bar.  \n\nThe decor is punk rock themed, and the bathrooms are characteristically messy.  \n\nAt one point in time, this would have been my go-to destination for weekend drinks with friends, but these days I have quite a few friends that probably wouldn't really fit in here or appreciate the peculiar charms of a place like this.  \n\nThat being said, I would bring people here if I thought they had a leather jacket in their wardrobe or a Ramones album in their music collection.   \n\nIf they had a Gun Club album, I would probably even buy the first round....", "author": "Gopal R."}

Maybe I thought that if we became friends I could convince you to improve your taste in music. Like, you know, maybe you could replace the Misfits albums in your jukebox with some Pere Ubu and The Wire. I saw progress: remember that one night you played Bauhaus, and I just happened to be wearing my Bauhaus reunion tour t-shirt? That was so romantic of you.\n\nYou could also be really generous, and I like totally loved that about you. $3.50 for most of the beer in your really-good (except for the surprising lack of stouts and porters) selection. Just a dollar more for a goblet of Delirium! And for your thirteenth birthday, you hired a (really bad) stripper and gave everybody free BBQ. That was like, OMG, so sweet of you!\n\nPlus, everybody's a sucker for a photo booth. Maybe that's why, long ago, I forgave you for your ridiculously slow service. And for the bartender who obviously aspires to be Mike Ness who forgot to bring me my $16.50 change after pouring me a beer. \n\nBut this weekend, I think I finally saw you for who you really are. My hot date and I, after a couple of beers, finally scored two seats at the bar. We were giddy happy. But you had to go and ruin our good mood.\n\nA guy beside us signaled to the bartender -- the fat one who looks like Fred Durst -- and said, \"What's a good local beer? I'm from Austin, so I don't really know.\"\n\nFat Fred Durst recommended Brown Shugga, a fine choice: a unique, rich sweet beer that is a whopping 9 percent booze. I had just had one a few minutes ago, and it was a bargain at $3.50 a pint.\n\n\"Here you go,\" Fat Fred Durst said to the Austinite, \"That will be five bucks.\"\n\nThe nice Austinite tipped Fatty two dollars, totally unaware that he had been ripped off just because he wasn't from around here.\n\nA few minutes later, as F.F. Durst was mixing some drinks for another customer, a guy asked him, \"Can I get two ciders when you get a chance?\" \n\nThe bartender shot back, \"Can I get a HOT MEAL AT A FAIR PRICE WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE?!\" and walked off, leaving the guy to order from another bartender. \n\nFat Fred Durst was obviously having a bad night. All three bartenders were ignoring pretty much everyone that night (after waiting for over 5 minutes, my hot date and I had to enlist a tall, loud, and very friendly stranger to order our second round for us), but Fatty was on a roll. He did actually manage to take the order of a cute-ish girl next to us who batted her eyelashes at him and ordered three tequila shots. But when she asked for a glass of water, he snapped at her, \"There's a water machine at the other end of the bar by the popcorn!\" \n\nYeah, no shit, and there's also a great liquor store around the corner, fucktard. If she wanted to serve herself, she'd probably go there.\n\nFattttttt Fred Durst continued to charge random-ass prices (five bucks, $4.50, $4.00) for beers that are supposed to be $3.50. And once, amazingly, he charged someone $16.00 for three identical drinks. Do the math: that's, uh, $5.33 each. \n\nAs we were waiting for one of the three bartenders who were hovering around right in front of us to actually LOOK UP and MAKE EYE CONTACT so we could order, my hot date overheard Fatty Fred Durst and Wanna-be Mike Ness (who, from the looks of things, spends the majority of his time thinking about his own penis. Like this, \"Dude. I totally look like Mike Ness. And I also really love my penis. It is fucking awesome!\") making fun of somebody by saying, \"Yeah, that dude totally drives a Prius -- hahaha!\" Yeah dude, polluting and giving extra money to huge gas companies to fill up your monster truck is totally punk rock.\n\nThe final straw came when a dapper old gay next to us got royally ignored for ten minutes, even after trying to speak to Fatty Fred a few times and holding up a twenty. The third bartender took the order of a group of guys right next to the man, and while he was MIXING THREE DRINKS, the man asked him, as politely as you can ask this sort of thing, \"Are you a bartender or a bar back?\"\n\n\"BAR BACK\" he said, as he continued mixing drinks.\n\nAnd, after seeing your shit, I can safely say that I hope you get run over by an environmentally-friendly car driven by a polite, older gay man from Austin, Texas. And that afterwards, a cute-ish girl pours tequila shots on your open wounds. And if you're not dead by then, well, I hope that at least the hospital severely overcharges you for the sutures.", "author": "Ben P."}

I've not had to wait too long to be served [the times that I've bought], even though I have that tendency to just fade into the background, and/or I just don't lean all over the bar enough to get some service. \n\nIt's fairly large, lots of space [two upper areas to sit in or to ride a Big Wheel down the stairs from - I saw it happen Saturday night!] and lots of things to keep you occupied if you're the type that needs multiple distractions. Starting from the front, you've got the bathrooms. Very important for activities that would involve bathrooms. In the ladies' room, I must say that there are some true artists out there. They decorate the stalls with pictures, snarky comments, phone numbers, etc. Makes for some quick bathroom reading.\n\nRight after that, the photo booth. Not the same quality as the one at the Elbo Room, but this $5 booth takes both B&W and color and fits about 2.5 persons. Moving along the right, you'll find a stripper pole. Did you notice that? It's on the bar in front of the listing of beers. The various occasions that I find myself at Lucky 13, I've not seen someone dance around it. YET. Will update the review again when I see this in action! There is an awesome jukebox that keeps the place LOUD to the left. Naked Photo Hunt + Sudoku [I held a record at some point!], popcorn, and pool. Video games up top too... And for those itching to watch a game, there is a television up on the wall above the entrance. PLUS, a back patio for hanging outside... It's okay if you have ADD in here, there's always something to do.\n\nThey'll let you bring in 36 cupcakes from Safeway down the block AND let you light 24 of them for a friend's birthday.

Shouldn't I be chopping away at their rating every time I see someone at the bar who isn't inked with a sparrow tat on their neck or discussing the torque of their newly bored-out bike?\n\nWell, yes.\n\nBut we are trapped in San Francisco -- land of smug indie hipsters and real-estate developer scum -- so it's hard to blame Lucky 13 for the fact that its clientele isn't solely limited to greasers who can sing along with every word of \"Why I Drink\" by the Candy Snatchers.\n\nFrankly, the Lucky 13 has so much going for it that I wish the owners could give lectures to other entrepreneurs about how to properly run a goddamn bar. Key topics:\n\n- Stock your juke with custom CD-R mixes, especially those heavy on classic punk, obnoxious outlaw country, and cocaine-blues rants guaranteed to offend the PC Police while simultaneously instigating the alkie regulars to spin a solo waltz on the bar-top.\n\n- Free, greasy, salty popcorn makes customers thirsty.\n\n- A wide selection of beer doesn't necessarily make you a metrosexual, pompous ass...it just makes easily-tricked drunks buy more expensive beer when they're tired of buying $2 bottles of Pabst.\n\n- Filthy bathrooms help separate the wheat (i.e., hard-drinking regulars) from the weak-ass chaff (i.e., khaki-clad weekend warriors).\n\n- A happy \"hour\" that runs from opening time until 8 pm really, really makes you want to buy a liver-crushing load of beer.\n\nClearly, I have spent too much time here. But why not?\n\nFor those who despise slick and trendy lounges, Lucky 13 may be San Francisco's best antidote.", "author": "John G."}

But most likely five or eight times. \r\n\r\nThere's this one dude bartender that looks really tough but is way nice and very fast. The bar itself is super long and I've only ever seen it staffed by one person, causing general slow service. It can also be sort of awkward at times if you're not sitting at the bar, because you might be waiting to order a drink at one end when the bartender is what seems to be 87 feet away. And of course I'm not some douche bag that's shaking my three dollars in the air and whistling, so i end up relocating myself. Blah blah blah.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the women's room (never too gnarly)  has 2 stalls, which is really rad for a dive bar. The Erotic Photohunt game is set at the end of the bar by the pool table and the popcorn machine, a perfect location for an inept pool player like myself, who happens to be very good friends with Miss Pool Shark herself, Julie Andrews. And because I'm a great big fat person I  always have room for a basket of stale free popcorn.  As a result, you can find my seemingly lonely ass at the end of the bar, drinking PBR, eating popcorn, and playing Erotic Photohunt (only the babes, though. The dudes are weird).

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE owner(s) of Lucky 13 don't ever change it to one of those soulless, touch screen things that have been spreading (at least around the Reno area) like a contagious disease.  \n\nWhoever burned the Lucky 13 compilations on the jukebox especially deserves some kind of award, not just for the great taste in song selection, but for the awesome CD covers--my personal favorite being the Richard Ramirez photo where he has Lucky 13 burned/tattooed into his palm.   You know it's time to fuckin' rock, when you're drinking and looking at that, about to play some punk ass tunes.\n\nThe crowd used to be better in years past,  until average Joe douchebag thought it was a cool place to hang out and gain some points by \"hanging out\" with punks.  But hey there's plenty of booze and, hands down, best jukebox ever.  Murrio's Trophy Room (upper Haight) has a pretty kick ass jukebox too, but nothing compares to those compilations.

Since I didn't want to stand in front of Cafe Du Nord with a bottle of vodka, I re-routed our group to Lucky 13, just on the same block.\n\nSo this place rocks.  I got great service, the place wasn't too crowded early, so my group and I had ample places to sit and talk, play pool, and we enjoyed the free popcorn and the $1 goldfishes (you get a LOT of fishies for a buck) very much.  The neighboorhood is great, and it's close to muni, so it works well for a few folks that might have pounded one too many.\n\nIt's a total ROCKER place, a punk rock feel that reminds me of my big hair rocker days back in the eighties.

Yeah, it might be dirty and stinky, but hey - that's what true bars are suppose to be.  If their foosball table was kept in better shape, I would go there WAY more often.   It gets pretty packed on weekend nights, so going during the day on Saturday or Sunday for a few free games of pool is actually one of my favorite times to go.  Good drinks (including a damn good bloody mary), cheap drinks, free popcorn, and free pool - why would you need to leave? \n\n**********Bloody Mary Review**************\nAnother reason to go during the day is their BM.  This isn't anything special in terms of ingredients - what makes it so special is the time and care the bar tender usually takes when they have time to make one.  They usually ask how hot I'd like it and if I want a rimmed glass.  What makes it even better for me is the place isn't famous for making good bloody's - They have decent bartenders that usually need to serve hungover people - so making a decent BM is a necessity.   And since during the day the place isn't a mad house, you are likely to get it the way you really enjoy - and not some 'one taste fits all', like many other places. \n\nSo next time your friends suggest going for some drinks, keep in-mind Lucky 13 - even it it is in the middle of the day on a Sat/Sun.\n\nRead some of my other Bloody Mary reviews at:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=YHu-iA23Xj2c1bVa7JROhA", "author": "Josh M."}

We took our drinks to the raised seating overlooking the bar, which was a little warmer but provided a great view of the entire bar. \n\nThey also have a stripper pole in the middle of the bar! Let me tell you, that's some sleazy entertainment. There were a couple of [beat, drunken] ladies trying not to vomit while doing their best to be remotely seductive... ya know,  without dancing well, looking good, or taking any clothes off. It was hilarious! Seriously, d-list strippers would have been offended had any been present at the time.\n\nHappy hour is daily until 8pm, so I'd like to check that out in the near future.\n\nOther cool features of the place include a popcorn machine with free popcorn, pool table, 2 pinball machines, photo booth, Pac-Man, and an ATM. They also have a small outdoor patio area that's reminiscent of a miniature Zeitgeist.\n\nJust off of the Muni stop at Church. I'll definitely be back.\n\nOh, and you can bring your canine friends as well. I don't think my cat would be into it.", "author": "Ramsey D."}

Huge amount of beers on tap, even more on bottle, plenty of space, high ceilings so that even when it's crowded it's not too loud.

Each time more money had been added to the urinal pile and a second pile of filthy money had started to grow in urinal #2.  \nThere was even a five-dollar bill down there by the end of the night.

To expand this analogy to its logical conclusion, Toronado is certainly the Father, offering the whole width and breadth of our drunken faith, Zeitgeist the Son, with its patio of salvation and its resurrection as a bike messenger bar after its death as another kind of biker bar, and Lucky 13 is the Holy Ghost, with its spooky and spirited interior, and its transcendent balconies that allow us to reach a higher plane, both metaphysically and literally.\n\nOkay, seriously, though, I love this place.  Although the beer selection might not be quite as interesting as Zeitgeist (and neither of the two is really any contest with Toronado), they have some nice options, particularly in bottles.  The two separate balconies are nice and allow a little makeout privacy if you so desire.  Actually, one of the things I love about this place is the sheer size of it relative to the size of the crowds.  It seems to always have a lively, moderate crowd, but you can always find a seat and can hear your friends over the din.\n\nAs at the other two figures in the Beerhead, the bartenders can verge on the surly if you don't follow their mysterious code, but the other night when I thought I'd lost my keys there, the barkeep helped me look for them and let me borrow his flashlight.

Kevin did the embarrassing friend thing and told the bartender that it was my birthday and he responded with the blank stare - which I could have kissed him for because I hate all that nonsense. However - after I took my first and my friend went to the atm - the bartender gave me another...awesome. \n\nmy friend promptly left, too straight he said- but I remained there till close which was about 45 minutes. Surprisingly enough I ran into a girl who had just moved here from Austin too and we had mutual hairstylists and friends from TX. awesome again. \n\nthis is why i love dive bars and I'm glad that I found the lucky 13.

You've probably already stopped reading this.\n\nI like the doorguy. He's a nice fella. We shoot the shit when I drop by. There is a friendly self-possessed bartendress who has been there as long as the place has been open (14 years at last count?), a funny kinda punker dude with great stories about using mace on unruly clientele, and more characters who are surprisingly cool given that they have to deal with all the boatloads of bridge-and-tunnel chuckleheads who drop by on amateur nights (Fri and Sat).\n\nA varied crowd. A friendly pool table. A back patio that usually stays open until around 10pm or so. Pinball. Fucking Foosball. That's pretty huge, right? A photo booth. A good punk-leaning jukebox, although it is unfortunately overloaded with \"Lucky 13 Mixes\" that have their tracks typed out in a tiny typeface that will piss you off and make you cross-eyed.\n\nThe funniest thing about this place is the fact that I can't even count how many times some drunk guy (or gal) has staggered up to me asking me where the bathroom is.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-09", "description": "San Francisco's best juke box resides at the Lucky 13. A great Punk rock bar that has been around for decades. You will not find many, if any Stuffed shirts or skirts at the 13, more likely you will find all the local color that makes San Francisco a great city. Moreover, with all the color comes the K-9's, as the 13 is also the best dog bar in the city. The 13 is housed in a large hall with high ceilings, a long bar and numerous tables. The back holds the pool table which is free on Sundays and a right turn from there takes you to a small back patio where smokers and readers alike lounge and enjoy their pints. Behind the pool table is a loft with tables and couple of pinball machines. Unlike Shitegeist, the bartenders here are capable and pleasant. Happily they provide free popcorn by the pool table. The aromas here can be challenging, the noise level can be prohibitive and it can occasionally just be too crowded.", "author": "Christopher N."}

And I can't believe there is a separate review profile for the photo booth here. Whoever started that is lame. But the booth is worth the $3. It's a polaroid booth that produces 4 shots on 1 photo. You have time to prep between shots and manually take the photo, which I think is a plus, especially if you're with costume(s). The location of you in the booth can be viewed from below, so beware. I think the trick to taking clean shots in every frame is to wait 5-10 seconds and take the next one. If you wait too long the photo starts to develop and takes away from the final shots.

I don't make it here as much as I used to, then again, I'm not out as much overall so I guess it still evens out.  A perfect Friday would be hitting the ZG around 3:00 and hitting up the Lucky for a night cap on the way back to the Lower Haight.  Of course this usually ends up as a good 9 hour run, but it's a good time nonetheless, even if it makes your Saturday wholly unpleasant.  \n\nThe bar itself has everything you would want in a good, divy type bar.  They have your pool and photo hunt.  There's also foos and pinball upstairs for those seeking variety.  The jukebox is great and the music is loud which can be good or bad depending on how much you really want to hear the person(s) you're hanging out with.  There's a lot of space and tables so even when there's a lot of people there, you never get the sense of being too jammed in.  This is noce especially on Friday and Saturday nights when pretty much every bar is jammed.  They also have a cool little patio area out back.  One of the most distinguishing characteristics is there's a big old school popcorn popper and free help yourself popcorn.  It's quite a nice touch too have some tasy popcorn, freshly popped, with your drinks.  Last but not least, all of the bartenders of very cool.  They're efficient, pour good drinks, and will remember you if you're there with any regularity.  \n\nOn a final side note, the bathrooms are near the doors where you come in.

That may be true, but when I was there I didn't witness any of it. I also didn't notice anyone who appeared to be a desperate poseur like some folks seem to think populate this bar. Maybe it's because I went on a Wednesday night. But I don't really care about that kind of thing anyway. What I do care about is cheap (and good) drinks, pinball machines, a jukebox that plays awesome music, a balcony on which my friends and I can dance, and people who don't stare you up and down constantly.   We had fun, and I never thought, \"Wow, this bar would be awesome if it wasn't so obviously trying to be a punk rock bar.\" Okay then.", "author": "Janine M."}

They have that touch screen game at the end of the bar--if you aren't playing Photo Hunt, then you are a chump.  Free popcorn; excellent way to convince folks that, yeah, who needs dinner, let's just stay here and keep drinking! (Cybelle's pizza is around the corner and they are open LATE--put some of that in your belly before you stumble/cab home)  There's an upstairs w/ foosball and pinball and a photo booth, and it is usually not crowded up there at all.  And the pool table is free sometimes, and people actually use the chalk board to see who is next, like God intended.  Good job people.  Also, there is frequently an excited little dog who lives to play fetch.  And on Saturday afternoons they have free hot dogs and burgers--nice!\n     The only bad thing?

I DO NOT KNOW YOU!\" and this dude will not leave and is just leaning against the bar staring at me and smiling like an insane person.  I look back to where the mysterious and adorable stranger had been and he is gone...SO MYSTERIOUS!  i wanted MORE!  but instead this drunken psychopath was blocking my escape.  I don't know why I stayed and talked to him, I think, deep down, there is a little part of me that knows my lot in life is not the mysterious and adorable stranger but is rather the drunken and possibly dangerous psychopath.  These are the cards I have been dealt and I must play them...I think perhaps I was someone terrible in a former life (say, Stalin) and payback is a bitch.  \n\nANYWAY...this dude.  would.  not.  leave.  He tells me many tails over a period of an hour.  my friend, Brigid C., joins us and we are both simultaneously fascinated with and repulsed by this big weirdo stranger.  we learn he is in a band and he plays something ridiculous like the banjo and he is a producer at NPR and he REALLY needs a light PLEASE GOD SOMEBODY LIGHT THIS FUCKING CIGARETTE!!!!  knowing that it is illegal to smoke in this bar, I gladly oblige.  The second his cigarette is lit, the bartender is all, \"dude, take that outside\" and the big fucking weirdo is all, \"miausodfuo8qe980u8!!!!\" and the bartender's all, \"OUT!\" and the big fucking weirdo is all, \"KJOAIU*UU@E(JIOIAWU()U!*UHIJSKASJHDU!!!!!!!!!\" and the bartender's all, \"that's it!  your ass is outta here!\" and with that, comes out from behind the bar and picks the big fucking weirdo up and throws him (literally THROWS him) out of the bar.  I'm sitting on the bar stool being all, \"OH, SNAP!\" when I realize that I have the big fucking weirdo's drivers license in my hand (long story) and so I have to run out after him to give it back.  When I get outside, there is a circle of people around him and he is laying face down in a pile of his own vomit.  I'm all, \"Flip him over before he chokes on his puke!\" and nobody will touch him so I make to go towards this dude and out of nowhere, he fucking SPRINGS up, grabs his drivers license, shakes my hand and takes off RUNNING down the street.  like full speed ahead.  It was INSANE AQUARIUM.\n\nwell, needless to say, this story ends when I place an ad on craigslist looking for the guy, his friend sees it, forwards it to him, he responds, ends up he does work as a producer at NPR and he does remember me and my friends, he invites us to drunken naked thanksgiving, i decline but we do end up forging a somewhat odd relationship built on frequent bizarre encounters and him offering to snort cocaine off our breasts.  i know he sounds unappealing but I have to say, this dude is fucking awesome...i'm so glad he drunkenly threw himself into my life that night at lucky 13.   Our story does take a sad turn when we find out that our man must move to NYC to become a big time NPR head honcho and I must stay here and rescue dogs.  See!  Proof!  Stalin!\n\nAnd that is the tale of david smith (name changed to protect um, his job), a coked out of his mind freak show banjo playing psychopath who is in charge of all of your current liberal thoughts...god help you all.", "author": "Laura B."}

This bar has one of the better (i.e. only) foosball tables in San Francisco, located on the balcony in the back, along with a couple of pinball tables. But pinball is too hard; foosball is the sport of true champions. But watch out: the table sometimes gets jammed because ass-clocks wedge the little cardboard trays for the popcorn into the foosball goals. (Yes, I have done this before as a young man with no morals, but I have matured since then). There's also a decent pool table that usually sees a fair amount of action - and I believe the pool is free during happy hour. Did I mention the popcorn? Yes, I did - you have been paying attention. They have this nifty little popcorn machine downstairs that's free; you can gorge yourself on popcorn while downing cheap drinks ($2 PBR, the standard candle for cheap beer - I wish they had Tecate, though) or more expensive drinks (they have a beer list that hasn't made me sad in the past). The outdoor patio is nice and cozy, but beware - it closes at 11PM, I believe, due to noise concerns. But it is an often overlooked place to while away a sunny afternoon. There's no lock on the stall door in the men's bathroom, so this means it's difficult to poo or do drugs in there, if you are the kind of person that does either of these things outside of your home. As many of these reviews have already testified to, the jukebox is fucking stellar - seriously. A warning, though - Lucky 13 sometimes gets uncomfortably crowded on the weekends, which can be a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on your astrological sign. But the clientele, while perhaps not genuinely punks/bikers/rockers (as if this should matter to anyone) are generally nice, with the occasional fratty douchebag thrown in for your mocking pleasure. Overall, Lucky 13 would get my vote for student body secretary in the high school of bars within walking distance of my house.", "author": "Max H."}

Unless you're out with true alcoholics who can't physically bear the lines at the bar and the lengthy periods between beers. The usual suspects and I found ourselves in just such a predicament last night. With all species of party animal raging in the streets of the Mission and bare-chested men gyrating on every table top in the Castro, standard boozehounds like us were at a loss for a place to go that wouldn't be so crowded as to defeat the purpose of going to a bar altogether. Someone saw Lucky 13 out of our cab window and yelled at the driver to stop. Seeing as the big Lucky lies in the middle of no-man's land, we figured we may have found exactly what we were looking for. And we were right! This is a bar I would generally classify as creepy but last night they fit the bill and I was surprised by the kinder, gentler Lucky 13. The place is huge and accomadates many, the bartenders are super nice, and the crowd was leaning toward the drunk end of the spectrum. Just what we were looking for!

Both their bottle and draft lists are remarkable.  The bartenders are a little rough around the edges, but that's their charm and they all seem to have pretty heavy hands when it comes to pouring cocktails.  Laura is my favorite bartender.  The free popcorn is a nice snack, even though I try not to think about how fresh it may be.  There is a photo booth and a couple games upstairs and the patio is open until 11pm (until the neighbors start complaining about noise).
