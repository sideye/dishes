It's also quite spacious, and according to my friend, this place is normally a bit more empty than it was on that packed rainy night. \n\nMy favorite parts of this bar:\n-Cheap, cheap, cheap drinks!! $5 draft beers, and cocktails are in the single or low double digits. Pretty impressive. \n-Pretty spacious and clean. The entrance feels a bit tight, but the back of the bar is super super spacious, there are some pool tables and photo booths, all neat stuff.

I stopped in for a round with some friends on a Sunday afternoon, and it was well worth the outing. Hell, it was almost worth the visit from L.A. all on its own.\n\nThe bar was quiet when we went, at like 2:00 on a Sunday. It felt comfortabtly divey, with pool tables and bad lighting and plain decor. We got our drinks then seated ourselves at one of the many empty tables. Service was great. There was one bartender on duty, and she made us our bloodys with plenty of flair. I enjoyed watching her mix mine, taste it, then add more hot sauce.\n\nThe bloody mary is a marvel, one of the best and most over-the-top I've had in a long career as a bloody mary fiend. It was spicy and thick, which is how like I like them, and I definitely saw the bartender squirt in some sriracha. It would've been a great bloody mary even with a standard celery garnish, but it came with a ludicrous skewer heavy with pickles--red pepper, green bean, pearl onion, cornichon--as well as cheese, salami, and candied bacon. Every bite was delicious, pairing well with the soup of the mary. That candied bacon was particularly splendid, and I loved the snap of the green bean and that sweet, tart cornichon. This drink was really an appetizer in a glass, absolutely delightful, and a steal at $9. Just remember to bring cash.\n\nThieves is high on my list of places to revisit on future trips to San Francisco. Next time I'd like to come for lunch and order five bloody marys in lieu of an entree. Can't say how that'd go in the evening, but it would make for an excellent afternoon.", "author": "Steph C."}

And to the \"man with the waffle iron,\" Mr. J, for making sweet, sweet waffles.  You get them free with your drinks. Today's sauce was peanut sauce and cinnamon whipped cream.

The group is more successful than I ever anticipated. I expected that I'd get ten or fifteen regulars going to a different dive bar every month. I figured it would be mostly men and hopefully a couple of brave women. I was quite surprised when 30 people with almost an even male / female ratio showed up for my first event. The bartender got a little mad at me and told me I should have told the bar we were coming so they could staff up for the event; I learned my lesson. Now I'm bringing between 40 and 60 people to each event and make sure I set everything up ahead of time with the bar management. \n\nI had an event this Friday at Thieves Tavern and we all had a great time, seriously it was the most fun night I've had in ages. We packed the bar, I'm sure it was one of the best nights they ever had in sales. \n\nHere's the problem; while I really like these bars the management is too flaky and too hard to deal with. This time it took me two and a half months and five personal visits to the bar to confirm the date and details, something that could have been sorted out in a few timely emails. It took weeks for this guy to get back to me and when he did he never quite answered my questions completely. I'm basically working as a promoter for no pay and all I expect is timely communication and maybe a couple of free beers.

We agreed and while the boys racked 'em and chatted, she dragged me to the juke box which still had 6 credits to go. \"Come on girl, make me proud.\" she said and walked away.

Thieves Tavern is a drinkin' bar for sure and the multitude of old school faces behind the bar only brings on fits of alcoholic nostalgia for the long gone days of being twenty-five and free of any sense of fiscal or corporeal responsibility. I love this place, but I can't go unless I've got a whole weekend to nurse the hangover that's going to come with it. \n\nThieves Tavern, recently moved from its original location on Shotwell, has improved itself in size and upgraded to a full liquor license, which if you ask me, is always better. The place is all shiny-new still and still smelled a little of paint last I was there, but that will all go away soon. The upside is the felt on the pool tables is fresh and smooth, the jukebox is all tricked out with fun rocking, indie, country, poppy stuff and most of the bottles are still full. \n\nThe four-star review rather than five is due simply to their mildly unadventurous beer selection. I know, I know, we can't all be Toronado, Zeitgeist or Lucky 13, but shooting for the common denominator is so dull. But I don't blame the guys who own the bar, I blame the drinking public who refuse to pull their heads out of their Heineken, their Bud or their Fat Tire long enough to realize that there is soooo much tasty and tastier beer...

I just hope they don't become popular cuz it would be nice to have someplace near my apt that I can go to on a weekend without it being a madhouse.  And they serve $2 Olympia cans.   Nice to have another cheap alternative rather than just Pabst, which has gotten quite old.", "author": "Kerry L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-21", "description": "i've only been here a couple of times so far, but have every intention of going back many times in the future. i love that there are 2 pool tables and a jukebox. on one occasion i was there, the bartender provided the money for the jukebox with the stipulation that no one put on g'n'r. and something else i can't remember. but still. that is fair. on his dime. fair. it feels neighborhoody and a little divey but not seedy. i loved that the two times i've been there it hasn't been crowded. everyone gets to sit. doesn't seem rowdy or like a place the marina kids would go slumming it either. after a few more visits i'll probably have more to say. like for now.", "author": "Ashley A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-11", "description": "This is a great bar if you're in the neighborhood.  Off the beaten path of 16th Street, so usually there are fewer people than in those bars.  It's dimly lit, with friendly bartenders and a good jukebox.  You can sit at the bar or in one of the comfy booths and drink your whiskey special (a rotating whiskey and a tallboy of PBR).  Also has two pool tables, and a photo booth so you can preserve an image of your visit that you might otherwise not remember.", "author": "Seth W."}
