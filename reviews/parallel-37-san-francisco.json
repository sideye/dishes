Some, like the chawanmushi and the shiso sorbet were amazing but others fell a little short. For some reason the chefs liked to incorporate gritty textures and I don't care for that sandiness in my food.  The Medium rare rack of lamb was tasty but hard to eat. Overall, though, a very pleasant dining experience.", "author": "Priscilla O."}

However, Parallel 37 didn't stand out except for having the slowest service ever. Our dinner took 3 hours, from 7:30pm-10:30pm. Our main courses came out a little after 9pm. Don't come here if you're on a time crunch.\n\nThe hotel's fire alarm went off in the middle of our dinner and none of the workers addressed it or apologized. It just rang loudly while we all watched the workers go about business so we knew it was false alarm.\n\nWe were glad that we got the 3 course dinner because sizes were on the smaller side. Perhaps, they're the perfect sized portions but not enough to fill me up if I didn't have the appetizer and dessert and I'm a 105 lb girl. \n\nMy favorite dish was the buccatini appetizer - a bit on the richer side but delicious. All of the dishes came out on very interesting plates. The sauce on my scallops kept spilling onto the table and made a little puddle of sauce because of the little ridges on the plate. Scallops were a solid entree, pretty darn good. Desserts had beautiful modern designs. Nothing stood out as mind blowing though.\n\nIt was aite, a solid three stars. I guess I was just expecting Parallel 37 to be of a higher caliber. C'mon, a restaurant at the Ritz should be classy and excellent not A-OK.", "author": "Denise K."}

We stumbled in here fairly late in the evening, no reservation, and they graciously showed us to another table. It's a casual restaurant at Ritz Carlton--We ordered the butternut squash soup in a sourdough boule bowl; lamb loin; Asian chicken salad--tender grilled Mary's chicken with napa cabbage and sesame dressing; grilled octopus; ethereal focaccia. The food was fantastic, hearty, no frills and bold satisfying flavors, excellent execution with even better ingredients, e.g. hello Mary's chicken! We sat at a regular table, and shortly after we sat down, their adjoining private room had an \"event\" a party of some sort, and as people began to stream in, the noise got louder and louder. Our server noticed that I kept glancing that way, and offered for him to close the door--he came over and said, \"They're going to start their party soon and I'll be able to close the door ... you won't hear much after that.\" This turned out not to be the case, because there's only so much sound a simple single paned glass door can shield, but I so much appreciated his intent to reassure me, his sensitivity to my distress about the sound, and his coming over proactively. That's service, folks! I cannot rave enough about their informal graciousness, warmth, ease, friendliness. It is the Ritz Carlton, though, and despite it being their \"bar\" with casual offerings and not their formal dining room, the prices reflect the Ritz manner of all things. It's not cheap, but if it's any consolation, the food doesn't taste cheap either :-)", "author": "Ranjan P."}

I could not help finishing every delicious bit. Did I mention that their bread is the best restaurant bread we've ever had?\n\nSince we had the $65 price fixe dinner, we all bore up under the strain and faced 3 wonderful desserts.

Being thoroughly impressed by the YEE meal, I quickly became a regular here... regular as in a few times a year.  And the best part is that he hasn't failed to impress me each time I've been back.  With the latest changes, my review will be a two-part one, so please bear with me:\n\n1)  Dinner - Having hosted a couple of special occasion dinners with relatives during the summer, I was more than happy to share this find with them, dining at both the kitchen table and their private room (the venue of said YEE).  Everyone was impressed and astonished at the food quality and fine service offered here.  Both times, chef Michael greeted our party and asked whether we enjoyed our meal... the five stars answers that question.\nRecently, he emailed me that bison (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4dPkqZKDvGGUnNu4Zwyp6Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) was again available... I'd been chasing him about bringing that back on the menu for over a year now.  Well, that was enough to prompt two more dinners for work and casual friends.  The Autumn tasting menu featured this!  The other highlight of that meal was the foie gras tortellini (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YM1GXAR1hN98GI7H4ionvg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  As was the scallop on that menu (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hCWGM_y0h4XzYuzegrsV-w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q)!\n\n2)  Sunday brunch - To show you how behind the times I am, I did NOT know that the hotel no longer served a Sunday buffet at the Terrace restaurant downstairs.  Nor did I know that they no longer offered the Christmas Day grand... and I do mean grand... buffet in the ballroom.  So it was a bit of a surprise to me when chef Michael invited me to their first rendition of Sunday brunch here in mid-December.  They plan to offer this brunch on the 2nd Sunday of every month.  I brought several friends including my best friend here to enjoy this wonderful, scrumptious meal.  Knowing the layout almost too well, I felt right at home navigating myself throughout the dining room.  \nPlease note that this buffet is one of quality over quantity as the selections are not as wide as their sister restaurant Navio in Half Moon Bay.  However, let's just say that I would be a happy boy just camping out at the hot plates and carving station in their private room.  Between the in-shell scallops and the prime rib and rack of lamb... well, you know.  Trying to pare down those calories in preparation for holiday feasting, I've been holding back on the sweets.  The dessert table here will bring you to tears.  The pastry chef has macarons as well as a variety of seasonal small bites that will leave you nodding your head.  My favorite were those passionfruit tarts that were topped with pomegranate seeds. (My apologizes for no photos as my phone battery died).\n\nWell, I've given you two quick reasons why this has become one of, if not, my favorite restaurant in the City.  I don't think you'll be disappointed dining here.", "author": "Mike C."}

Very limited seating but glad to have been able to get a last minute reservation as a hotel guest.  At $143/person, a steep price....it was an experience but not worth it.", "author": "Harp B."}

These peeps have got it down, never been disappointed here.\n\nIt had been several years since I had been to the Dining Room at the Ritz, it's transformed into a very modern and artistic Parallel 37.  The same elegance and world class service is there, just against a very pretty new backdrop.\n\nWe did the 3 course prix fixe and it was epic from start to finish:\n\n1) SASHIMI OF HAMACHI (Monterey abalone, nori, meyer lemon) - Bomb dot com.  The sashimi melts in your mouth, so tender and fresh.\n2) HAND CUT LINGUINI (morel mushrooms, bloomsdale spinach, pickled ramps) - Very nice.  The only thing that was maybe just very good versus epic; just a bit simple but still well balanced and flavorful.\n3) 32 DAY DRY AGED RIBEYE (short rib ravioli, summer squash, sweet corn) - Wow.  Just the most tender, perfectly aged and grilled steak, heaven in every bite.

You can park as long as you want. We drove up and the guys let us park up front! We weren't supposed to stay long, but we ended up eating dinner here! \n\nWe sat at the bar before dinner and they had some really interesting cocktail concoctions! I'm not a big drinker, but if I were, I would definitely want to try these out. They had a drink that had vodka mixed with absinthe! I didn't even know they served absinthe in America? \n\nFor dinner, we went with the 3 course pre-fixed dinner at $65/per person. Seriously, it was worth every dime! The food options range from fish to meats and even vegetarian. The portions look small, but they're actually tasty and very satisfying! Presentation is sooooo pretty! The flavors are well meshed together! The taste, texture and portions were perfect! Every single one of us at the table enjoyed our meals very much! There were 6 of us! \n\nTo give you a run down on the dinner flow:\n- the chef gave us something to cleanse our pallet and start off our meal. I forget what it was called but it was some kind of green mouse that was chilled. It had some kind of greens and cous cous topping. It was interesting to start off our meal \n- bread basket variety \n- first course: I had the ahi tuna poke. The fish was fresh, and it wasn't overloaded with soy sauce or salty sauce. They poured a nice cucumber sauce on top to compliment the chopped cucumber. It was really nice. \n- second course: I had the lobster! I liked the different elements. They used the meat, the fat, and something that tastes like octopus. I don't know if it was, but it was good! $15 extra for the lobster! So good. \n- third course: I had the vegetarian option, which was the asparagus with polenta and poached egg. I probably could have ordered the rib eye but I wanted something lighter. This dish had everything I liked: poached egg, asparagus and polenta! I was quite happy with my choice \n- dessert: skipped because I was too stuffed to continue on \n\nI loved that all of our food came out at the same time. Several chefs and servers came out together and presented our meals to us. They explained what they were serving, and also answered any questions we had! No one was left hungry waiting for their dish. We were all able to eat at the same time! \n\nI also liked that they allowed us to bring our own wine. Our friends had just come from Napa all week, and they wanted to share two of the bottles they brought back. I really liked that they allowed us to do that! \n\nI would definitely come back here! It is \"uppity\" compared to some other restaurants I've gone to, but the food and service is phenomenal. This has got to be one of the best hotel restaurants I've been to in California.

Enjoy! \nIt is with great pleasure that I get to write my very first review about my experience at such a beautiful restaurant. Lets dive right into this unforgettable 6 course meal! \n\nBread:\nThe bread was heavenly. Please correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that P37 does not make its own bread in-house but wherever they get it from, it deserves 5 stars on its own. They had a variety of breads and a great variety of complementary spreads. \n\n1. European White Asparagus, English Pea Custard, Coriander Encrusted Ahi Tuna \nI usually eat Ahi Tuna cold, but this time, it was served in a warm White Asparagus soup. This was absolutely tantalizing on the tastebuds and a new take - at least for me - on a classic preparation of the beloved fish. Peas were in season and were cooked very slightly so it added a great crunch to the otherwise softer dish.  \n\n2. Sweet Corn Risotto, Poached Maine Lobster, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Sweet 100's\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nmwrLYVIb1-eIBPySnvexg&userid=7JNWJToIaBivj2Pc3PQTrw)\nThe Chanterelle Mushrooms had an amazing crunchy texture to them that contrasted very well with the sweet Risotto. The only minor setback in this dish was that my particular lobster was slightly overcooked so it had a tougher, stringy feel to it. Visually a stunner. \n\n3. Liberty Farms Duck, Farro, Seared Foie Gras, Cherry\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=srbrTQPaJMQpIWEZ_w9_VA&userid=7JNWJToIaBivj2Pc3PQTrw)\nThe Duck was well prepared, but it was lackluster compared to the Foie Gras and the Farro combination. This dish smelled incredible and very rich. The Foie Gras was seared perfectly on both sides and melted in your mouth. They Cherry component left a note of sweetness that worked well.\n\n4. Roasted Lamb Loin Crispy Polenta, Heirloom Tomatoes, Romano Beans\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HxP1EksMeZwABXiRrM8kNA&userid=7JNWJToIaBivj2Pc3PQTrw)\nAs I continue writing this review, I believe I am more in awe of the side components than the supposed stars of the dish. The Heirloom Tomatoes were prepared and seasoned very well. It made a bigger fan out of this long time fan of tomatoes in general. The Polenta did not add much to the dish. Lamb was on point per usual.\n\n5. Ginger Soda, Cucumber Sorbet \n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nyrOCuZEKeIlYGXX-kUNWg&userid=7JNWJToIaBivj2Pc3PQTrw)\nThis dessert was equally unique in its taste and components. The Ginger Soda added a carbonation and a strong ginger profile that was smoothed out by a cool relaxing cucumber sorbet. The ginger was overwhelmingly present in this dish, but the sorbet cooled it down and added a great texture to this dish. \n\n6. Vanilla Parfait, Cherry, Lemon Chutney\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wqaOhfbSVTvYXfhNxgQWTQ&userid=7JNWJToIaBivj2Pc3PQTrw)\nParfait was light and a perfect end to this dining journey at Parallel 37. Cherry was again used beautifully in this dish. 10/10 would try again! \n\nTLDR; \n\nPro: Worthy of the price tag, great overall experience, vegan friendly (sister had her own vegan 6 course meal), great ambience, seasonal foods were greatly prepared and paired\n\nCon?: A more casual gourmet dining experience. We had a big party so it did not feel as formal or intimate, but if you are intimidated by the stuffy suits and getting dolled up, this place may be a great medium for a great meal that is a little less dressy.", "author": "Matthew S."}

In comparison to other fine dining restaurants, Parallel 37 needs to fine tune its service and its bread offerings.  For several dishes, the waiter was not certain about the ingredients/details.  On several occasions, the dishes did not arrive at the same time.  The dessert was served to 8 of the 10 guests.  It was another 2 minutes before the final two guests were served.  From other tasting menu experiences, guests are provided artisan bread and rolls.  We were provided what appeared to be toast with a nice sweet butter.

Though I wanted to dine at The Dining Room at The Ritz, I found out during the fall that it was closing. In its place would be Parallel 37. Chef Siegel would still be heading the kitchen but in a more casual and inviting restaurant. \n\nAfter much anticipation, my friend and I came to Parallel 37 for dinner last night. The ingredients were top-notch, the combination of new American flavors with a French and Japanese flair were unparalleled and each dish was flawlessly executed. But there was one BIG problem: THE SERVICE. More on that later.\n\nF O O D\n*BRAISED CHICKEN BREAD ($7) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GnxzYamcJRd5NG94wGxdcw?select=tfnFpiSaaejBkjDNoAMZzw \nGrilled rustic country bread smeared with garlic butter was served with a tiny ceramic pot of braised chicken. The braised chicken was a delicious hybrid of pate and chicken meat; rich and velvety smooth with a slight bite. The combination of the mouth-watering crunchy bread and the decadent chicken spread was sublime.\n\n*FOIE GRAS w/ Huckleberry & Rome Apples ($18) - 4.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GnxzYamcJRd5NG94wGxdcw?select=SfbUtf2yqaPMEmn4tq_bRA \nRivaling my favorite foie gras off all-time from La Folie, this dish did not disappoint. The perfectly seared foie gras topped a crunchy circular brioche with stewed apples and fresh huckleberries. The burst of sweet tartness from the fruit duo softened the richness from the luxurious foie gras. The flavor and texture combinations were nothing short of amazing.\n\n*MASAMI RIBEYE w/ Potatoes, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Red Onion Jam & Pinot Noir Reduction ($29) - 4.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GnxzYamcJRd5NG94wGxdcw?select=z5S8a2PxbhaF4IR2EaTBFA \nOnce you go kobe, you NEVER go back. Trust me. When available on the menu and when my credit cards aren't giving me the middle finger, I always go for the kobe. The rich marbling can make a tremendous difference in flavor and texture which was exactly the case with this masami kobe ribeye. \n\nCooked to a vibrant red rare, the trio of well-seasoned ribeye strips were as soft as butter with an incredible rich, meaty flavor. The red onion jam was simple, yet genius; imparting a pop of tantalizing sweetness at the end of each bite. I savored every bite and was left wanting more. \n\n*CHOCOLATE NUTELLA CROQUETTE w/ Nutella Ice Cream ($9) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GnxzYamcJRd5NG94wGxdcw?select=9t8JGSyQq9sjmWPgqi_VAw \nThe nutella croquette sounded good conceptually but just didn't work. The croquettes were like mini falafels filled with the hazelnut spread. The exterior was so heavy, hard and dense that it took away from the indulgent filling. Though creamy and smooth, the nutella ice cream was more like a chocolate one. A lighter flavor, perhaps a vanilla ice cream would have mellowed out the richness of the dessert.\n\nS E R V I C E\nSimply put, I've received BETTER service at a Chinese hole-in-the wall restaurant.\n\nPromptly take and bring my order, refill my water, check on me periodically and I'm a happy camper. Of course as the number of $ increases so does my level of expectation.\n\nWith that being said, our waiter, Justin (Kevin Kline look-a-like) was unprofessional, inattentive and completely aloof. He was MIA most of the night. After he brought our cocktails, we were ready to order but he took off and was no where to be found. After ordering, he left one menu on our table and never cleared our wine glasses (I pass out with wine). These are very basic things especially for a fine dining establishment. He checked on us only once towards the end of our meal while he constantly checked and chatted with older patrons.\n\nThe charming maitre d saw us anxiously looking for our waiter so he kindly took our dessert order instead. We saw our busboy more than our waiter. If I had it my way, the entire tip would have gone to our busboy.\n\nFood service was SLOW. We spent 80% of our dinner... WAITING. Waiting to order. Waiting for our dishes. Waiting for water refills. Waiting for the dessert menu. Waiting for our check. Waiting to sign our bill. I think I grew more crow's feet in the interim.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nContemporary and casual with clean lines, wooden furnishings and earthy etched glass fixtures. Located inside the Ritz makes it an ideal spot for tourists to lounge over drinks and/or have an intimate dinner.\n\nP A R K I N G\nStreet parking can be easily found before 6 PM on California Street though trekking up/down the steep hill in heels will pose a challenge. Otherwise, valet parking is available.\n\nThough I thoroughly enjoyed Chef Siegel's culinary masterpieces, it seems the downgraded restaurant transformation caused a complete lost in translation in service.

Though the tortelloni was stuffed with a generous amount of veal, the veal was a bit dry. The worse part of the dish was the undercooked pasta skin which resulted as the skin being doughy and dry.\n\n*Mushroom Risotto ($24) -The risotto was nice and creamy.  If you're a mushroom person, I'd recommend this dish since the mushroom flavor was really brought out in this dish.  The only thing I would've done differently was ask for no fava beans.\n\n*French Fries w/Housemade Ketchup ($8) - Definitely a must order!  The fries were sliced thin and were deep fried until crispy.  The first taste of the homemade ketchup was a bit odd but quickly grew on me.  The housemade sauce is made from tomatoes, mustard seeds, and various herbs and spices.\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waiter was nice, but didn't seem to be seen most of the time.

Aside from plating fouls where you couldn't eat your meal without something rolling off or a sharper knife, there were too many ingredients, sauces and flavors on each plate.  In addition, I wished that they served each dish fresh on a warm plate to meld the smells and flavors together.  Although there are signs of creativity, I felt lost whenever I tried to eat each dish.  For instance, the ramen was deconstructed to the point that it looks like a misnomer.  \n\nThe only thing I remember are the stylish plates and hefty utensils including knives that stand on its own blade.  The ambiance isn't too stuffy, but the overall feel is cold.  Parking can be tough on the street, but there is valet service at the Ritz.", "author": "Jenny L."}

The creativity, presentations,  and flavors were among the best we have experienced in SF, and I dare say that I liked the food more than at Quince during a recent visit there. All that for a price that was easily 1/4 of Quince. The tasting menu was only 65 bucks each! The service was also top notch--there was one little hiccup in that the duck breast came a little too underdone. The service and kitchen staff quickly corrected the situation, and the waiter made it right with the bill by removing the charge for the glass of wine I got (the most expensive cab-Rutherford-which was spectacular, by the way). He even gave us a 2nd glass on the house. On top of all these exceptional qualities, we were able to get a reservation on a Saturday afternoon for that evening at 730. The restaurant was quiet, with only about 25-50% of the tables occupied. Obviously not a lot of people have gotten the message. We will definitely be going back--often!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-07", "description": "I was hoping this reinvention of the Ritz Carlton Dining Room would surpass its former self, but I think it falls short in a few ways.  First of all, while the decor is definitely more modern than before, it does not feel like an actual restaurant anymore, but rather a hotel lounge.  There is no door so while you're dining, you can hear noise from the hotel lobby, which isn't even that close, so sound must carry.  We were interrupted during our meal by various lobby noises, which was distracting and not what you would expect for the price of the meal.  Second, it's very casual inside, which also contrasts poorly with the price point.  No tablecloths, \"rustic\" furniture, and the orange colored water glasses must go.  \n\nFood and service were excellent.  We did the prix fixe, although we were disappointed not to see seared foie gras anywhere, especially since that was such a highlight of the former Dining Room.  All the dishes were great--flavors were inventive and delicious and portions were good.  Service was friendly and informative, including about the wine and cocktail list.  On food/service alone, I would have given 4 stars, but the disconnect with the restaurant's ambiance are bumping this down to 3 stars.", "author": "Michelle C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-15", "description": "This review is for the Sunday brunch.  We went this past Valentine's Day taking our extended family.  We knew the prices going in, and I did see some of the review saying that the variety was smaller than what the Ritz had before, but I did have some expectations knowing we were going to pay $115 per adult and $58 per child.  \n\nThe decor is pretty nice, what you'd expect from a restaurant at the Ritz.  We were seated at the chefs table.  There was a small one way mirror that looked into the kitchen.  I was kind of thinking most of the wall was going to be glass, but it is more like a window.  In fact, I was seated with my back to the window and now that I am thinking of it, the only time I saw anything was when we first sat down and I purposely stood up to take a look.  Otherwise, the window is too high to see anything if you just turn around, so nothing that special.  I have definitely seen a lot cooler ones.  You can stand outside of Benu and watch them cook while seeing a lot more.\n\nAt any rate, for a brunch there were only 2 things I would consider breakfast.  They had a french toast that the kids liked, although one of the kids thought there was coffee in it.  Not sure, as I didn't taste it.  The other thing was an eggs benedict which was pretty good because of the toast, but a little watery for some reason and no hot sauce at the table.  There was some if you went over to the bloody mary bar.  \n\nSpeaking of the bloody mary bar, it was cool.  They had 3 types.  I tried the mildest because it was tomatlllos.  The bartender did warn me that I had to add some acidity and other items, so I did, but I could see it being pretty bland without.  I appreciated the creativity and wanted to go back to try the spicy one, but never made it back.  My brother-in-law did and said it wasn't spicy, although he does like things hot.  \n\nThe rest of the brunch was geared more towards lunch or dinner.  There was a carving station with duck, salmon and prime rib.  The prime rib was pretty good if you got it medium rare.  My sister likes the ends so it was medium well, but she said it was pretty tough and didn't end up eating it.  There were a few pieces of sushi, some dim sum, a lot of cheeses and nuts (filled up at least 1/4 of the space), and desserts.  There were more small plates here and there, but maybe less than 10 things.  Nothing really screamed have 2nds for any of us, but my mother liked the salmon nigiri sushi.  \n\nAt one point, I heard someone telling the waitstaff that they should have small bowls out for the soy sauce for the sushi so you can tell they are still learning.  \n\nThe only thing I think that was up to par were the desserts.  They had a pretty good variety and some creativity.  \n\nThe service was nice and great at clearing the table, but horrendous at refilling our water.  I don't think they ever refilled our water.  Not sure if we asked them to though once we were running low, but at a nice restaurant, the glass should probably never go below half.  All of the adults' waters were at or near the bottom.  To top it off they tacked on 20% gratuity because we had a large party.  Pretty rare to see 20% tacked on, usually 18%, but at a buffet seems really high and the fact that they never refilled our water...  Not really a big deal though, but some at the table thought it was too high for a buffet.  \n\nUnfortunately, we will not be going back.  I am not even sure if we would be going back if we paid the kid's price.  I know Vegas buffets are cheap because they are used for marketing, or at least I assume so, but when you are used to paying $50-60 for a good buffet in Vegas, it is hard to pay twice as much for one that is less than half the size.  I was kind of expecting the buffet the Ritz used to have a long time ago, but I think this one was far from it.  \n\nThe restaurant had the space to increase the amount of food by at least 30% as half of the bar was not being used so I would suggest doing that and limiting the amount of cheese for more breakfast items.", "author": "Jeff N."}

One the second night there we were a bit tired and didn't feel like the 20 minute drive to the restaurant we had reserved dinner for that night, so I stopped by Parallel 37 and spoke with Molly, the hostess. I was concerned because my wife has several dietary restrictions and didn't think the menu would suit her. Molly was so helpful and assured me that anything on the menu could be changed to accommodate her wishes. Molly really sold us on the place...she was delightful.\n\nThe menu is a 3 course prix-fixe with only 5 choices for each course. I was having trouble because there wasn't anything I really wanted in one of the courses, but several things from another. Our waiter, Carl (who was fantastic) said that we can mix and match and are not limited to the order of courses. Which was perfect. I ended up getting black cod (fantastic, and much lighter than expected), duck breast with cherries and a duck confit pancake (delicious, and perfect with their Pinot Noir by the glass), and 32 days aged rib eye with corn and a short rib ravioili (insanely good). My wife had the black cod, halibut in romanesco sauce, and lobster with pea tendrils which was out of this world ($15 supplement).\n\nThe 3 courses are only $65, which I feel was a tremendous bargain given the quality of food and service, and the fact that you are in the Ritz Carlton. It was so good that we cancelled our reservations 2 nights later and returned to eat in the bar area. They allow you to either order from the bar menu, or ala carte from the course on the tasting menu (but you get bigger portions). I had to get that rib eye again, which was even better this time with a full portion. My wife got the half organic chicken with wilted greens and mashed potatoes (a Molly recommendation).  It was exactly what she was looking for that night and loved it.\n\nThe room was nice and the noise level was very quiet, so everything added up to 2 wonderful meals. I would suggest Parallel 37 to anyone, regardless if they are staying in the Ritz Carlton or not.", "author": "Jeff W."}

I'm not gonna be able to remember all of the dishes and the names, but I really liked squid ink linguini with grilled scallops. In a very weird way ( and probably not the best one to compare) but it reminded me of the Korean kind of cup of noodle I used to eat back in Russia when I was kid with little edible pandas in it. So that squid ink pasta tasted like those pandas and it brought back memories and I loved it. \nOther than that, I think desserts were my favorite, I wish it was more of them. \nService was exceptional, I didn't expect less. Out silverware was changed after each dish, server was very attentive, wine and water glasses were always full.

On their first night in town, I knew I had to break them from the monotony of BBQ and Tex-Mex food and take them somewhere that truly highlighted a San Francisco dining experience. Parallel 37 totally delivered.\n\nFrom the get-go we were greeted by warm, friendly faces and escorted to our table by the cheery hostess. The dining room was nice and full on this Tuesday evening and there was a tangible energy to the room -- contemporary music playing along with the buzz of people enjoying their wine and meals, but not too loud to where we couldn't enjoy our conversation. Carl, our server, was super knowledgeable and explained that we could enjoy a 3 course prix fixe selection or put our trust in the hands of the chef and enjoy a 5 or 8 course tasting menu. With a chef as talented and capable as Michael Rotondo, we had to opt for the latter and ended up enjoying a 5 course dining experience.\n\nThe food was phenomenal. My mom usually runs away from any seafood (I think she was attacked by a school of goldfish as a kid or something), but even she was blown away by the flavor of the Alaskan halibut with a tempura battered squash blossom, Israeli couscous and lemon verbena. My dad and I were big fans of the Liberty Farms duck with sweet and sour eggplant, gnocchi, and a plum sauce and of cores the 29 day aged ribeye with braised oxtail fritter, spinach and cherries. To end the meal we enjoyed a dessert of fresh nectarines, almond crumble and tarragon ice cream topped off with nectarine syrup. Delicious. Stone fruits are in full season right now and you can tell the culinary team does everything they can to use the freshest and most seasonal ingredients.\n\nThe sommelier, Ryan, was spot on with creative wine pairings for each course.

I'm getting my foie gras fix every chance I get before the ban kicks in on July 2012 prohibiting restaurants from serving this delicacy.  (That will be the day when my heart dies just a little)  \n\nParallel 37 is more semi formal with a casual comfortable atmosphere despite it being at the Ritz.  \n\nOne word for the oysters on the half shell with elderflower mignonette - FRESH!!!  This was a teaser since a serving only came with 2 tiny oysters.  \n\nWhat was memorable:  Beef ribeye.  The portion was small.  There were 3 pieces of super tender ribeye with yukon potatoes, chanterelle mushroom, red onion jam, pinot noir reduction and they melted in my mouth.  My guess was the portion equated to about 6 ounces of red meat.  It was not enough to fill a hungry stomach for the price but it was really good meat and it reminded me that quality should always come before quantity.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GnxzYamcJRd5NG94wGxdcw?select=OEEoF7aS8VcgFUrqS-wZWA)\n\nInconsistent:  The first serving of foie gras was perfectly seared and the huckleberries balanced out the richness.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GnxzYamcJRd5NG94wGxdcw?select=FeBbJchYmJA434p8QMoaEg)\nSo good that it left me wanting more so I ordered a second serving.  Unfortunately the second time, the foie gras was seared to a burnt.  It was still good but I could taste the burnt texture.  My point is that the food was inconsistent.  \n\nWhat can be improved:  side order of assorted mushrooms with meyer lemon was very forgettable.  It should NOT be called \"assorted\" if it only came with 2 types of mushrooms, oysters and enoki and it was skimpy in portion.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GnxzYamcJRd5NG94wGxdcw?select=LD816kTEvFJeyVD3f4SL8A\n\nWhat I don't care for:  Sweet treats on the dessert menu was a disappointment.  An assortment of sweet nibbles that changes daily.  Macaron with caramel buttercream, watermelon fruit pate, chocolate bon bon, pine nut cookie - tasted like almond cookies, eclaire - chewy rubbery like stale bread, marshmallow with graham cracker crumb coating, chocolate cake pop.  The best item on the treat plate was the cake pop in comparison to the rest of the treats but I wouldn't order any of them again. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GnxzYamcJRd5NG94wGxdcw?select=GBaJmSwxzVSXJe4AeDFl3A\n\nService:  5 star to the waiter who did not include the burnt foie gras on the bill.", "author": "Hannah C."}

For a restaurant at a hotel I think it deserves accolades for not making boring food for the average visitor scared to venture out and try authentic food. Heard good things about the new chef's team and chose this restaurant for a night out since we had a babysitter. Every dish was unique, tasty, and didn't compromise on flavor or culture. This place is a fusion place but does it well. \n\nBauer commented on the decor but I think it is fitting for San Francisco, because yes it kinda feels like the inside of a bar but it's classy yet casual (i'd say 35%/65%)-- which, my friends, is what SF is all about! even at the Ritz, you can wear jeans and be served with respect. It has the same feel as RN74 in terms of decor. The service was spot-on, friendly, not over the top. We had:\n\nzucchini soup $12 (by the way they use the sous vide style of cooking in several dishes...mmmm)\nhamachi (great take) $17\nlinguini was infused with paprika and reduced OJ (never thought of that kinda   preparation but it worked; tart in a good way) $19\ntrump mushroom $20\nchicken wing (again a unique but eye-popping take on the classic wing) $16\nflank steak looked dry but it wasn't at all! I think it was the sous vide thing again. $24\npork loin $22\nCune rioja was also a nice treat.\n\nWhile everyone had probably gone off to a BBQ, we were starving by the time our 8:30 reservation rolled around (have an infant that consumes our days!).

They are very knowledgeable of the wine pairings and describe each wine for you to understand how it pairs well with the meal. \n\nThe food is exquisite! Light and refreshing, but still has a twist in each dish. Market and seasonal driven so you know what time of the year you are eating. I personally do not like shellfish and it was amazing how they incorporate another ingredient to substitute the shellfish, but still look the same way as the other tasting plates. They still make you feel that you are eating the same dishes as everyone else, it is very thoughtful. \n\nWe had a pistachio cremeux with fresh strawberries that was light and cleansing for dessert. I normally do not order desserts because they tend to be heavy sometimes, but this was just right! Cocktails are amazing as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-07", "description": "There's nothing wrong with the food here, and I feel a little bad giving them only 3 stars, but in a city like San Francisco, you can get a much better tasting menu for $95. The chef started us off with a couple of amuse-bouches. They were fine if not spectacular. The second was odd, in that there were three distinct flavors, depending on where you chewed, and they didn't really jive together. Nobody at the table liked that one.\n\nWe then proceeded through several courses based on poultry. They were all good, just nothing that memorable. There was a guinea terrine that had a nice depth of flavor, and also a salad wrapped in rye bread basked in miso-infused butter. Those were highlights. There was a beef tenderloin for the last savory course that was good, cooked sous vide and then seared. But hey--it's beef tenderloin. Any 5-year-old can throw that bad boy in a water bath, set the timer, and have it taste amazing. My rule of thumb is that if they pretty much cook it exactly the same way at Chipotle, then you have to go a step beyond for fine dining.\n\nI don't remember what the desert was, though I'm not much for sweets. But I do remember the wine. We started with a gamay from Oregon. The sommelier was pretty keen on it, but I thought it was a bit weak for the price... $80 for a tart, berry-like wine that's fairly light bodied. I've had beaujolais that were much better for half the price. Then we had a local pinot noir from Alexander Valley I believe. It was very jammy, sort of typical of the region, again a bit more expensive than it was worth.\n\nSo anyway, it was a decent meal. I could tell the chef was putting his heart into it, and I'd be curious to see how his cuisine evolves over time. I'd be raving about it if it were half the price. But you can get a better meal at many of the Michelin-starred restaurants in the city for the same price.", "author": "Aaron G."}

My husband and I booked a room on the Club floor - it was fantastic. We were enjoying the amenities and ambience of the Ritz so much, we cancelled our dinner reservation off site and decided to try the restaurant. The decor is quite casual - more like a nice sushi restaurant than a fine dining restaurant at a Ritz. The wait staff was knowledgable and friendly. The menu was very limited and the portions tiny. My husband and I aren't big eaters, we frequently order starters and split an entree then split a dessert. Tonight we split the very pricey rib eye steak - we were served two tiny slices of steak with a few pieces of a crumbled up corn fritter - delicious but minuscule.  The atmosphere was off the charts casual - even by SF standards. Across from us was a large family wearing yoga pants and sweatshirts with yelling kids they left running and screaming around the restaurant. No one said a thing. If we were spending $50 at a casual pizza place - no problem - but where the tasting menu is $160 per person and you have a romantic dinner planned with your husband, it's definitely not what you would expect or enjoy. As our dinner was microscopic we were planning to order desserts. Just as we were handed our menus two of the racing around yelling kids decided to turn the booth we were sitting in into a jungle Jim complete with more yelling. Neither their inattentive parents nor any of the Ritz staff felt compelled to stop this - needless to say we skipped dessert, signed our bill and walked out. While I don't think a restaurant can necessarily control the bad behavior of their patrons, perhaps if the restaurant weren't so casual, people wouldn't think it was OK behave like they were out at Chuck E Cheese. Absolutely not the romantic dining experience I was looking forward to.", "author": "Heidi S."}

For me, I really don't care what the restaurant looks like inside - I only care about the food.\n\nThat being said, the food is really the same quality as the old Dining Room.  I had the chef's tasting menu plus a few extra courses and many of the dishes were the same.  The ingredients used are still top-notch quality (Kobe beef, black truffles, maitake mushrooms, each person receiving a whole soft shell crab) and the taste is still very Ron Siegel (who is still there, by the way).  Based on my dining experience with the tasting menu, I definitely feel that the kitchen has worked out its kinks since the messy remodel transition.  Service was absolutely wonderful and we had no problems - a good deal of the same wait staff remained as well.\n\nAnyway, on to the food! (Links to pictures of some of my standout favorites)\n\n-Miyagi oysters (perfect start to the meal)\n-Polenta fries (the execution of the chanterelle relish was impeccable - perfect little cubes!)\n-Heirloom tomatoes w/ crispy rice & ricotta\n-Kampachi sashimi\n-Soft shell crab w/ dashi & Maitake mushrooms (an entire soft shell crab per person... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GnxzYamcJRd5NG94wGxdcw?select=z5S8a2PxbhaF4IR2EaTBFA#LhQJRN3fq6HLDIuEvP9LgQ\none of my favorite dishes)\n-Foie gras au torchon w/ strawberries & feuille (BEST FOIE GRAS EVER!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uxxhjG802hZuduse78VcCw&userid=tduMSflg1bhAFDgWOr4MPg\nMy sister and I both agreed this was the best foie gras torchon we've had...and I must say, my sister is a Michelin-star-whore and we have been going crazy lately with foie gras tasting menus)\n-King salmon \n-Braised veal tortellini\n-Kobe ribeye w/ black truffles and corn puree (another favorite - no skimping on the black truffles too http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bqqMnsylnLC4eR-l5X3s7A/l.jpg)\n-Lychee sorbet\n-Peach panna cotta w/ strawberry sorbet (flawlessly executed panna cotta)\n\nWe had fantastic wine pairings with each tasting course as well (see pictures).

Service is spot on and our server gave us complimentary wine and extra dishes. The wine collection is quite intensive and is compiled in an iPad.\n\nMost importantly, the dishes are perfect.\nI was a bit skeptical in the beginning regarding the japanese influence in the menu. It seems like every single restaurant who tried to get their michelin star will put something japanese (sisho, sashimi, and anything that sounds tokyo-like in the menu). Boy, I was wrong. Soft shell crab and lobster risotto for appetizer were unforgettable and perfectly done. Danio (?) risotto for main course was done with skin perfectly seared and the black truffle shaving on risotto was very generous. For our dessert, the server gave us free wine pairing (and I forgot to say at the beginning, we also get free flutes of champagne from champagne - not fake champagne).\n\nAll and all, we had fantastic meal with Ritz' impeccable service.

We had eaten dinner there once before and thought it would be nice and more relaxed for our first night in town.  Flying in from different directions, tired from a hectic work week doesn't lean me towards wanting to hop in a cab for dinner typically.\nWe both opted for the chefs choice menu which is supposed to a lovely surprise of one course after the next, you simply tell them of any allergies or dietary restrictions and they work around that, bringing you hopefully tasty little courses to try.  We represent a challenge to some fine restaurants as we don't eat beef, pork, or duck, and that sometimes presents the need to think outside the box where 'gourmet' food is concerned.  Typically when I have a meal prepared like this I can describe every course and the presentation etc., but sadly this is not one of those situations.  First of all the wine list was not up to date and we predictably chose a wine that was sentimentally significant, which they didn't have - no big deal, we picked a different one and it was delicious.  None of the courses were so yummy that I even clearly can recall what we had.  I know I had a fish that was tasty, a pallet cleanser that was really yummy and refreshing, and one course that was inedible due to the amount of salt on the spinach.  The handmade linguini was really yummy but unfortunately it was included in the overly salty spinach dish.  The staff was friendly and fairly attentive, but never suggested perhaps making the small entree over so we could actually eat it, and I didn't feel right saying \"would you try that again please, because I think the pasta could be really good\". . . Overall after then eating breakfast there a couple of mornings later, and being served Chicken apple sausage that looked like it had been poached, and then corrected most likely by throwing it in the deep fryer, and just not having a very satisfying experience in the early morning either, sadly we're not sure if we'll give them another try next time we're at The Ritz.", "author": "Myrna S."}

It's both a good and bad thing. \nI don't know how to describe the plating technique used here but it's quite beautiful and enchanting. We start off with a chicken salad and it comes out looking like a beautiful floral arrangement on a plate. It was the highlight of the meal. The saut\u00e9ed and pickled veggies went great with the chicken, all drenched in a warm root pur\u00e9e sauce. \nThe rest of the dishes try to follow the cue but miss the mark. Their Ramen was a square stacked variation, almost cake like in a moat of soup. I applaud the creativity but the flavors were just not there. All I could taste were bean sprouts. \nFor Entrees were a Poached Salmon with a quinoa salad. The Salmon was perfectly cooked but the entire dish was a little too subtle in flavor. Being able to taste the freshness of a dish should not be at the sacrifice of savoriness. Beef flatbread was our next dish. Again, beautifully presented but the flavors were lacking in complexity. Dessert was amazing. Described as a panama cotta but it was really more of a caramel cream mousse. Descriptions are deceiving on this menu. \nOverall I'm left a bit confused and wanting something more. Perhaps a compass is needed to guide me in the right direction. The decor is wonderful at parallel 37. Wood, stone, chrome, glass, and pop of orange for color. Service was attentive but a bit condescending to other guests.

The flavors were fine, but it was literally two bites... and done.\n\nI also had the Pacific halibut with artichoke ravioli per our server's recommendation.

Years ago (or is it a decade now?!?) I enjoyed one of his meals at Masa's.  I don't remember what I had but a happy grin comes on whenever I think of that dinner.  To quote my friend that night. \"it was a party in my mouth\".\n\nSo when a dear friend offered to take the nieces and I to Parallel 37 to celebrate the girls' birthdays, I said YES!  The hostess was excellent and acknowledged the birthday celebrations.  There was a candy bowl on the front desk and the little niece's eyes went big.  Later the hostess told us take as many of the caramels and nougats as we wanted.  Believe me the little niece did.\n\nI started with the Vaudeville Punch.  Tasty and refreshing.  It had Hanger One Vodka, Dimmi liquore, caviar lime & Fentimans rose lemonade.  My friend had Ketel One with an onion.  The girls had an \"orange dreamsicle\" which was interesting.  I think there was pepper in it.  Not sure.  One of them really liked it but the other didn't.\n\nFor appetizers, the table split the shortrib ravioli and the English pea tortelloni pastas.  My friend and I also split the foie gras.  It might be our last chance in California!  And we ordered french fries with the housemade ketchup.  The fries were yummy.  Unfortunately my friend and I had some housemade ketchup on the Big Island once and we are forever trying to find some that's just as good.  This was not it.  Maybe we have an idealized memory of that ketchup.  (I know, I know.  Am I seriously salivating over ketchup?  Well, actually, yes.)\n\nI like that there's a children's menu.  Sometimes the girls just want macaroni and cheese or plain pasta with vegetables.  Those were on the menu as well as a fruit plate which was beautifully presented.  I order the duck breast and enjoyed it.  My friend had the ribeye.  \n\nDessert was good but sadly I can't remember what we had.  My friend was peeved that the nieces' birthdays weren't acknowledged initially but the waiter made up for it by bringing by a second round of dessert for them.\n\nIt was a good meal at Parallel 37 but I wasn't wow'd.  We enjoyed our meal but there was no spark.  Did I set my expectations too high?  I'm not sure.  Maybe I'll just have to head back to see if the experience will be different.", "author": "J. P."}

But that did not work out, and we are one and done on Parallel 37, thanks to ridiculously minuscule portions of bland food, a \"bar program\" that I could have topped in my kitchen, and prices that are completely out of whack for both sizes and quality.\n\nLook, I know its the Ritz Carlton, meaning everything comes with a Ritz tax. But $7 for one potato-wrapped mid-sized shrimp (which the bartender warned us about, meaning people must have already complained about the portions), with a side of sauce that I think came from Trader Joe's (which I love, but really?). Or the pulled pork slider... my date guessed Scrooge McDuck must have been on QC that night, because my slider had multiple whole peppercorns (not something you want to bite into!), a tiny bit of meat, and was otherwise so sweet it reminded me of a sloppy joe. \n\nAs for the cocktails, they weren't terrible at all, but given the pre-opening hype about the bar program I expected more. I've had much better drinks at the Burritt Room--I'd pick Tunnel Top over P 37 for drinks. \n\nI know this place will do brisk business regardless of my review, but for people visiting from out of town, do yourself a favor and skip Parallel 37--you'll have a much better experience for the price at just a walk down the hill (or a cab ride) away.", "author": "Lesly S."}

Parallel was recently remodeled and has a warm, fancy feeling to it.\n\nThe service was decent. My waiter was mediocre. He was slow and a bit unattentive.

Nonetheless,  the other people working here (manager, etc.) were so helpful and sweet--what you would expect from a world-class hotel.\n\nI started off with the ramen. It wasn't ramen though. It's like \"ramen broth\"... but not the tonkotsu type that I like. I don't know why won ton skins are considered ramen. Still confused. But regardless, I wish I ordered the salad. Like other yelpers wrote: the idea was great, but the taste was missing.\n\nNext dish was the poached salmon. Wow. Yum. I don't think I ever had poached salmon before, but this was great. The salmon was flavorful... but also pretty salty! Good there was the salad and quinoa on the side to balance out the taste of the salmon. Salad also had squid ink as the dressing. Innovative, and I appreciate the idea of combining bland with flavorful... but that combination just didn't feel sophisticated enough for the Ritz. However, I must say... this is the only place where they cooked good quinoa. I dislike quinoa and try to avoid it at all costs when eating out, but this was interestingly easy to eat.\n\nFor dessert, there was the caramel panna cotta. with sea salt caramel. This was a perfect dessert to wrap up the meal. I usually don't like panna cotta, but this was  smooth and not too rich. The portion was also just the right amount.\n\nOverall, this experience was decent. I want to come again for the regular menu.", "author": "Adorable T."}

My hubby's crab salad was also pretty good.  For our entrees we got the sea scallop and the snapper...the portions were generous (such giant scallops!) and they were both yummy, though I think the snapper was better than the scallops though.

I really really really wish I had consulted Yelp first.  We got there and for a quick second I thought I was lost, until the hostess explained that they had done away with TDR and Parallel 37 was their new eatery.  The decor looked ok, very modern and dark, so we decided to stay.  The restaurant was only about 30% full - on a Saturday night at 830.  Not a great sign, but since it was pouring outside we chalked it up to the weather.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad experience, but it also wasn't a great experience.  The staff was extremely attentive.  Our waiter was Michael and he was an absolute delight, very personable and very attentive.  He always noticed when my cocktail was running dry and I never had to ask for another, they just kept coming.  Kudos to him for that.\n\nThe food was decent.  I started with the oysters but was disappointed when they came out and there was a huge size discrepancy between them.  One was the size of my fist and the other the size of my thumb.  Then came the foie gras with huckleberry.  It was quite possibly one of the best foie gras preparations I've had in a very long time.  I was beyond impressed with it.  For the main I chose the Angus beef and it was a huge disappointment.  It was tough and chewy.  No matter how I tried to cut it it was difficult.  I'll be honest, I don't even remember what I had for dessert, it was that forgettable.\n\nMy wife had the asparagus soup which was meh, and the scallops which I thought were very well done and I wish I had ordered them as my main.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this experience 3 stars is because of the foie gras and Michael.

It is a very democratic menu.\n\nThere were a lot of things on the menu that I was not familiar with but our server, Justin, was absolutely incredible describing every single dish and the preparation of it.\n\nHere is what we liked:\n\n\"Beet Oysters\"\nBeing from Belarus originally, I was pleased to find out that this is a deconstructed twist on the classic soup Borsch.  I thought I had tried every version, but this was quite new. And, I have to say, delicious. The classic flavors of beets, dill, pickles brought me right back to my childhood. The addition of oyster was an interesting twist that actually mixed very well and showed an impressive daring! I could have ordered 2 or 3 more servings of this one!\n\n\"Dungeness Crab Linguini\"\nIt was amazing! Very delicate and smooth with clean flavors.\n\n\"Royal Trumpet Mushroom \"\nThis was one of the favorites at our table. What stood out about the dish was the range of flavors, from umami-earthy mushroom to bright punches of flavor sprinkled throughout. Very well-balanced, and very enjoyable- we all couldn't get enough.\n\n\"Flank Steak\"\nAnother favorite. Very recommended.\n\nDessert cannot be missed... I don't care how full you are; make sure you order at least one.\n\nThe icing on the cake was to meet the Chef himself at the end of the night.  He was standing by the hostess stand saying good-bye to the last customers.\n\nOverall, we had an amazing time and we will definitely be back.\n\nP.S. Parallel 37 has an extensive wine list. The restaurant manager, Justin was extremely helpful. Make sure to take advantage of his knowledge!", "author": "Alena L."}

Chef Rotondo's menu is creative, playful and oh so packed with surprises. I just loved this unexpected dinner treat. There is a three-course pre fixe dinner or a five-course summer menu or an eight-course menu. There are also wine pairings if you'd like. We were just here for a quick dinner after a long day. We chose the three course pre-fixe and oh my God, this was one of the best dinners that we've had in years! I don't even know where to start. The staff is knowledgeable and actually care (about every little detail). The food is well thought out, beautiful, yummy and playful. Did I say playful? This is what dining should be..... Food entertainment, not just food, The wait staff..even the busboy, were interactive and added to the experience. I could go on and on, but really, I don't want to spoil this treat.

It was an amazing evening with a wonderful tasting menu and wine/drink pairing.  The first course was fried artichokes in baby gem lettuce.  It was the perfect starter; the artichokes were tender and slightly bitter (in the good way that artichokes are bitter) and the gem lettuce was the perfect calming accompaniment.  The second course was sweetbreads with smokey risotto.  The sweetbreads were delicious as only a ball of cholosterol can be.  Everyone around me loved the risotto, but I'm sad to say that it wasn't my favorite.  I LOVE risotto, and cook it often at home because it's a fantastic gluten free option (sometimes I convince myself that my acupuncturist is right and I should limit my gluten - it's rare, but it happens), and it takes on the flavor of whatever you're cooking it with so perfectly.  Anywho....I thought the smokey flavor overpowered the delicious simplicity of risotto, but that was the only part I did not enjoy.  The third course was my absolute favorite - flank steak marinated for five days.  It was so tender and flavorful, and I could tell as I was eating it that I would crave it later.  Thankfully we met the the chef, Michael Rotondo, who offered to email me the recipe....yes please!  Seriously though, Michael came out to talk to the group about the food and his inspiration for the menu.  He's a surprisingly humble person considering his accomplishments, and thoroughly likeable.  He emailed me the recipe for the flank steak as promised, and I'm looking forward to wowing my friends with it during March Madness.  Thank you Michael for a wonderful evening of food!!", "author": "Cori D."}

In other words:  AWESOME.\n\nKampachi Sashimi:  Weren't too excited about the preparation, but who can complain about sashimi.\n\nBlack Cod:  This preparation was also similar to the Dining Room, with a delicious dashi broth.  Ask for a spoon, you will want it.\n\nMasami Beef Rib Eye:  We first learned of this ranch at a Ron Siegel guest chef event at Baker and Banker earlier this year.  This is Japanese style beef raised in Oregon.  This is worth repeated trips.  THE BEST JAPANESE-STYLE BEEF in the US.\n\nLemon semifreddo:  It really amazes us how good Ron Siegel is at desserts (as well as the rest of the menu), a low level of sugar with well match flavors.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-27", "description": "This review is for the bar at Parallel 37 only, as I have yet to eat a meal there.  I came here for the first time for their \"soft opening\" in December 2011,  which featured specialty cocktails and small bites in the newly renovated space.  The energy was good, and the frequent customers are all happy about the updated dining/bar option at the Ritz. \n\nSo, it's no secret that Parallel 37 secured one of the best bartenders/mixologists in the Bay Area.  Camber Lay is indeed quite talented at crafting specialty cocktails so suit most anyone's taste.  I've been back since my initial visit, and each time, Camber was careful to listen to what I liked and even remembered the yummy drink she'd made me the last time.  The other bartenders are attentive and detailed as well, so I'd say Parallel 37 has drawn some great talent behind the bar.  \n\nAs an SF resident (vs. a paying Ritz overnight guest), will I be there often?  Well, I do feel comfortable sidling up to the bar for a nice drink and conversation with anyone else doing the same.  I hope to be there a few more times over the course of the year (special cocktail in hand - thanks for the \"Tilia,\" Camber!).  \n\nI had to dock 1 star for the following reasons:\n\n1)  I'm sure management will iron this out soon when the restaurant isn't so new, but there are managers/men in suits hovering over the check-in table and the bar like hawks.  It was overwhelming and slightly alarming to walk in and be greeted by no less than 6 people in suits, and then to have them pacing awkwardly and a bit too watchfully around the whole dining and bar area.  Diners/drinkers had a hard time being at ease with managers circling.\n\n2)  The are awkwardly placed pillars at the bar.  I watched a patron sit for about 15-20 minutes without getting served simply because he was sitting behind a pillar that prevented the bartenders from even seeing he was there.  It was a slow night and he should have been attended to much sooner.  I'm sure these pillars are structural, but they block the visibility between bartenders and patrons in a pretty jarring way.\n\n\nAll in all, I'll be back the next time I'm craving a good cocktail in a mellow yet upscale atmosphere in Nob Hill.", "author": "Marina Maven C."}

The only thing is the chef topped the whole thing off with unannounced Kimche and the flavors were horrid.  Then there was the \"california lamb, heirloom eggplant, chorizo, piquillo peppers.\"  Mushy, flavorless lamb chunks of varying types, all inedible.

I'm a chick who like to EAT, although the food was good especially the salmon, I wish there were more on my oversized plate. The service was amazing & very attentive. I ordered a glass of Riesling from Germany which complimented my 3 course meal. I was surprised that I was presented with an iPad when I asked to see their wine list so that was pretty cool. The decor is nice, a lot different from the previous decor before the renovation. Started off with a rather small portion of Ramen. It was delicious but I wish i should've told them to poach my egg a little more hard but not a big deal. Second course was the Poached Salmon, which was cured & poached deliciously but like I said before, I wish there were more pieces in the dish. Quinoa added a nice tasty crunch to it then I ended my meal with a Caramel Panna Cotta with a sprinkle of sea salt caramel. My fiance was thrown off by the taste of salt on his first bite but he got over it & devoured the rest. It was very good to the point that I almost ate his but I'm a good woman so I didn't reach across the table with my little teaspoon.

The service was fantastic ( Robert ) was our waiter, but we had a lot of extra love and care from all!  If the service was this good when there are actually people in the dining room then they deserve major  stars!\nthe service was 4star!  the food was very good,  We started with a flatbread /pizza  pretty good but nothing out of this world.  and the green salad  I thought was too plain, and not enough citrus to it.. but hubby thought it was perfect.\nI had the the Halibut with noodles  that had so many wonderful Shitake mushrooms,  and nice juicy but crispy bites of fish,   I never ran out!   Hubby had the Tagliatelle with braised duck .  I think we both liked  the dishes but maybe we should not have ordered 2 pasta dishes  and tried something else.   the noodles tasted handmade, and were delish.  but the staff and the bar drinks beat out the food!", "author": "Mary H."}

The host was actually uncharacteristically lacking basic choreography.  Our service once we reached the table though was great and the meal was one of the best I've had in the city.  This was the Christmas eve menu, not sure what the a la carte menu is like.", "author": "Matt T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-18", "description": "We went there despite the sometimes not very good reviews. Did not go for the 5 or 9 course dinner, rather had 3 courses a la carte. With amuse bouche, dessert and amuse dessert  / mignardises ended up having 6 courses after all. All dishes had very interesting taste combinations, this was kind of a signature theme of the new chef, who came from Chicago where he had worked with the late Charlie Trotter. For example the scallops with smoked clams were just phenomenal. Also the cucumber sorbet with elderberryblossom sirup. Very good selection of wines by the glass. But the wine list is generally on the pricy side. With the dessert, we got a Phelps Eisrebe wine for free, a dessert wine made from scheurebe grapes. The atmosphere is relaxed, not overblown. The service is very friendly and attentive. We will come back again, assuming that this place will make a big splash in the SF gastro scene!", "author": "Ernst N."}

We arrived prior to our reservation and were treated with impeccable service in the lounge. The atmosphere is nice, artistic earthtones, with comfortable seating. From the valet in front to being seated at our table, we wanted for nothing. I felt like a princess. When you stand, someone is there to support your chair. Upon returning to your table, you are again seated, napkin elegantly placed in your lap. If you want to dine somewhere Service is an Artform, and needs are anticipated,I highly reccomend Parallel 37.\n\nWe selected several appetizers prior to our main course. All of them were plated beautifully, with a taste to match. The fois gras simply melts in your mouth! All of us ordered a different entree, and fell silent from our earlier laughter as we reveled in the amazing tastes of our dishes! I will associate Parallel 37 with outstanding service, and delightful food. I highly reccomend this culinary experience! Worth every penny!!!", "author": "Michele H."}

Different animals.\nI was fortunate enough to dine at the Terrace twice, and each time was a mind bending experience, but one I could only handle perhaps once a year.\nParallel 37 is a completely different concept, and it has become my go to business and casual friends from out of town hang out since the first delicious meal four weeks ago. Disregard reviews over a couple of months old, as the restaurant has only been in full swing for perhaps three. Service was warm and not stuffy. The flavors are intriguing and the plated dishes are very very pretty. Prices are way down. We have had the short breads (slightly sweet..warning) the tomato salad, a couple of pasta dishes, the beef in curry (this is a delicate green sauce, not what one usually imagines. Everything was wonderful. Great chef, apparently. (I keep forgetting to ask, but I have seen him about the dining room.). \nThe desserts are varied and delicious. The last one was a green tea semifredo with crisp candied rhubarb strips. I wanted to wolf it down, but it's too delicate to do that. \nThe restaurant has a really neat looking glassed n party room, which I may use for the next lunch conference we hold.", "author": "Otto S."}

If you love bars at regional airports, head to Parallel. This is either the ugliest bar/restaurant in the world or an interpretive center for suburban strip-mall sports bars. 'Relaxed' is a code word for CHEESY. How could they do it? Crap drinks, lousy service, cheap lighting, bad furniture, overall a farce. What were they thinking? The '37' is the temperature of the icy receptionist. You, Ritz, close this joint down now it is ugly and uncomfortable. Your guests and Ron S. deserve better, a LOT better!", "author": "John M."}

They need a need a bartender that's actually mixed drinks as well. I heard the staff from the Burritt Rm is looking, so maybe there's hope. But the food is HORRIBLE!!! As a joke to your friends, order the \"Chicken Wings.\" They're going to be the topic of culinary jokes for years! SO BAD!!!!!! Imagine 3 cubes, (you're reading this correctly.) of, I think they pan seared them, but they tasted and felt microwaved, topped with flabby, gummy skin. There was a watered down sauce, that I think they think had flavor, but... no. Go there, overpay and you'll have stories to dine out on for years at a restaurant that serves food you have a chance in hell of liking. Avoid like the plague!", "author": "John M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-18", "description": "Having dined at the old Dining Room at the Ritz Carlton, and have followed Chef Ron Siegel from all of his different restaurants, we were eager to check out Parallel 37. Lucky for us, Ron Siegel's food is still both modern and classic. Beginning with the corn soup, this seemingly simple dish revealed the Chef's exceptional talent. It was not cloyingly sweet as most other corn soups we've tried, but rich with fresh intense corn flavor. It is even more exceptional when we realize that there was not one drop of cream added, yet it tasted creamy and luscious. This is only possible at the hand of a masterful chef. From the fois gras to the quail to the soft shell crab, Chef Siegel kept us on a culinary high. Our entree of duck and ribeye brought us back to a time when we first enjoyed Chef's food at Charles. It was classical technique executed flawlessly. Service was both warm and professional without a hint of stuffiness. Our server gave us great suggestions on wine, cocktail, and entree selections. Needless to say, I was really surprised at the 3 star and below ratings I've read on Yelp. I really think these reviewers truly miss the point of Chef Siegel's cooking. His cooking is not about how salty or spicy you could make a dish, or how large a piece of ribeye was served. It is all about often subtle flavors served with depth. To those who've given less than 3 star reviews, I challenge you to go back and try the food again. Only this time take the time to talk with your server, and ask for recommendations. They are very friendly and extremely helpful. I could only say that we can't wait to go back soon.", "author": "Amen C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-12-28", "description": "I live across the street from the Ritz Carlton, hence, I live across the street from Parallel 37.  But, it took a work group lunch to actually get me to the restaurant.  The decor is very spare.  Done with beautiful woods and natural fibres but hard-edged and loud. The menu was interesting but not extensive. I ordered the baby beets salad to start.  It was very good with gem-colored baby beets, lovely greens, candied walnuts, and large sheets of shaved parmesan with a delicious light vinaigrette.  For my entree, I chose the scallops. $26 and there were 3 of them on the plate. Three.  No rice or other side.  Just three scallps in sauce.  They were beautifully done but the portions are miniscule. For dessert, I chose the coconut panna cotta.  It came with a lacy cookie and a fruit granita but the granita was so mildly flavored, I wasn't sure what fruit it was.  For that matter, the panna cotta was also rather mild and very small... a bit larger than a silver dollar.  I had never been in the old dining room as I recently moved to the city.  But, seeing the photos here on Yelp, I actually miss it... It looks like it was lush and cozy and romantic.  Not so for Parallel 37.  Not so at all.  For a downtown lunch-only restaurant, it might work.  But for a neighborhood dining spot, it is missing warmth in food and ambience.", "author": "Karen S."}
