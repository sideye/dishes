I'm not sure that's true of other kinds of food and this is coming from a Korean guy. Headache? Have a taco. Appendicitis? Have a burrito. AIDS? Make it a Super Burrito. But Mexican food helps for emotional pain too. Emotional pain can hurt more sometimes, because it is very real and it lasts longer. Sometimes it lasts your entire life. Zona Rosa is good medicine. \n\nIn my memories San Francisco is forever cold and windy with a slate grey caul blocking the city off from the pleasant rays of the sun. I don't believe sunny days happen in San Francisco--contrary to the opening credits of 90s sitcom Full House. In real life the Tanner Family would suffer from seasonal affective disorder. \n\nThe first time I walked into Zona Rosa, the rain outside was coming down like a curtain of mist and I walked into it and it saturated my clothes and I walked around the Haight smelling like wet clothes that had been molding in the washing machine overnight. \n\nI had been shambling down the street, mumbling profanities under my breath, looking like any random homeless person. My face was pale and sweaty, but I forced a friendly smile though I wasn't smiling inside. The big man at the counter with the tattoos covering both his arms took my order--a carnitas Super Burrito and a can of Coca Cola. He nodded in acknowledgment and turned to the flattop grill and went to work. This is very good work, feeding the motley assortment of customers that inhabit the Haight. These are people that walk right up to your face and tell you to \"fuck off,\" without any provocation, but they're hurting very badly and you shouldn't hold it against them. You were just the closest person for them to scream at. I respect Zona Rosa for doing this very good work.\n\nI love the openness of a true taqueria like Zona Rosa. There's nothing to hide here. No one is fucking with your food in the back. You can look right over the counter and watch your food being prepared on the flattop. I love to watch my burrito come to life before my eyes like a little newborn baby swaddled in a tortilla blanket. Then I eat my baby and I cry when it is gone.\n\nAs the big man assembled my burrito baby, I slipped slowly on my Coke, chewing on every sip, and felt myself come back to life. Then my burrito arrived. Meat and carbs packed into a ten inch tortilla capsule. It's everything I need to feel good. Life is good at Zona Rosa.\n\nBest regards from your friend in fun,\nPhilip C.\n\nP.S. The carnitas here is the right combination of crisp, tender and savory. This is how carnitas exists in my dreams, but I don't believe many taquerias do it right like they do at Zona Rosa. Apparently dreams do come true.", "author": "Philip C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-30", "description": "Zona Rosa is currently part of my Holy Trinity of Mexican food in San Francisco.  Located on the corner of Haight and Shrader, just a jaunt away from Amoeba Records and Golden Gate Park, Zona Rosa serves and delivers a fat plate of delicious food in comfortable quarters for a reasonable price.  And they're friendly, too!\n\nFrom the outside, it may not look like much.  Cracked windows painted with the logos of our beloved Giants and Warriors; sidewalk sometimes strewn with cigarette butts and other strange left-behinds by the vagabonds of Haight Street, who wander and loiter about.  But once you are inside, you are greeted by warm and spacious accommodations: a mixture of tables, booths and counter seating that is rarely crowded and never filthy.\n\nAnd trust me: if you are hungry and you enjoy straight-forward Mexican fare, then you, my friend, have stumbled into the right place.\n\nYou make your way to the service counter at the back of the dining room.  A large, easy to read menu is posted high above.  The counter is populated by steaming hotel pans of beans and meats neighboring all the necessary and delicious fixings, such as guacamole, pico de gallo, jalapenos, sour cream, you get the idea!\n\nMore likely than not, you will be bid welcome by the friendly workers who stand behind the counter and between you and your latest food coma.  I'm not sure if Zona Rosa is family owned and operated, but it sure freaking feels like it every time that I go in there.  And, if it is not, then it does raise some pressing concerns regarding child labor laws, as I've definitely been helped before by industrious and friendly kids behind the register ... \n\nIn any case - nightmare scenario aside - just being there gives me that cozy family vibe that so many establishments try to replicate, and often poorly.  There's just no substitute for the real deal!\n\nSo, invariably someone will say hello and you will place your order.  The fare is simple: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile relleno, etc. I've only had the taco platter (tacos with rice and beans) and the Super Burritos (a nearly foot-long monster of a burrito complete with sour cream, salsa, and guac) and both were filling and excellent.  You and your server work your ways down the line, cafeteria-style, until you've got yourself a meal, for here or to go.  \n\nYou pay the kid behind the counter (cash only, but there's an atm right behind you, if you need one), get a complimentary side of chips, and then it's time to enjoy.\n\nYou won't be disappointed.  The food is hearty and delicious.  I always eat in-house, because I need about an hour after chowing-down to digest.  The fare is heavy and the portions are generous.  But, like I said, if you are hungry and a fan of cozy Mexican cuisine, then Zona Rosa is always a home-run.", "author": "Max T."}

They used to have awesome chips - now they are costco bul special.  But what really bummed me out was the wrap. Zona used to have the best, tightest, most evenly distributed wrap in the business. Yesterday was a joke. The jalapenos were clustered on one end, the chicken on another and some mush in between. And it was loose like a Chipotle wrap in De Moines. No offense to Des Moines intended.

We opted with the regular so it was topped with a generous scoop of salsa.  Do we want some chips?

It's not just a great value but also very tasty.  We took 2 chairs looking out onto the street and enjoyed our mini meal - scooped up the salsa, meat and refried beans with the chips squirting an absurd amount of hot sauce on top.  After we leveled the mountain of beef, we split the rest onto the 2 tortilla and enjoyed it.

This place stocks a large number of fresh ingredients which you are welcome to simply point to and have added to your burrito as you move from right to left across the open service counter.  Another feature of this place is they charbroil their meats, whereas many taquerias merely fry and/or simmer their meats and then fork them. The quality is good and quite reliable, and their prices modest.  Parking is nearly impossible, though, and I will say that I have had a couple of recent unsavory run-ins with a fatty chicken or two.  All the more reason to try the California burrito with carnitas.

The carnitas burrito is good also.\nThe tamale is good also.\nThe red sauce and the green tomatillo sauce are spicy but awesome!\nSure, the price runs a little on the high side.\nI usually keep pouring and pouring them into my plate.\nThis location is located near Amoeba music store and as Rick H. mentioned, there are a lot of punks, street kids, gothics, and homeless people - and if you pick the table next to the window, you can watch the people with interesting outfit passing by.\nOh, one negative is that they only accept cash and parking is hard to find (I am actually annoyed with places that only accept cash especially if parking is not easy to find), but I can not take out any of the star because their food overcome anything else.", "author": "Oribel .."}

It is so bomb, I could seriously eat here everyday - and I have. I love sitting by the window and watching the people walk by. They have such good spicy beef and the chips are hella good too. Also I like how they have the old fashioned coke bottles.", "author": "Lacey P."}

I had a zona rosa taco which had a ton of stuff on it, I couldn't fitt all of it in the two corn tortillas they give you. But luckily they give you chips to scoop up the straglers. The burritos were f-ing huge. The staff was friendly and quick.", "author": "Ryan M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-11", "description": "Zona Rosa is like an old friend.  The burritos are great, not as good as the Mission, but very good for this part of town.  The rolling technique, in particular, is excellent here, as you get a burrito with superb structural integrity.  They've got two kinds of hot sauces -- both good -- and they give you free chips.  You can get anything you want here when it comes to beans, meats, tortillas.  The grilled chicken is awesome and not just burned to a crisp like a lot of places.\n\nCons: Not open late, don't take credit card, meat sits out too long.", "author": "Dean A."}

The food has always done me right...until yesterday. That was the day I decided to try their camarones for the first time ever. Big mistake. I have been up since 4am blowing chunks...out of my ass. Sorry for the graphic details, but seriously, I must warn you: do not order the shrimp burrito, no matter how tasty it sounds. It was sooo good going in, but it didn't feel so nice coming out. To top it all off, tomorrow is my birthday and I can't even celebrate to the maximum because my tummy is in a die hard battle with my colon. So, why three stars you say? Come on, I've been going there since I was 6 or 7 and everything has always been fantastic - the chicken, the beef, the pork, the tamales, the guacamole, everything! So I can't deny those fifteen years of bliss, but this one experience might have done me in...", "author": "Lizzy C."}

I have eaten there many times.  On the other hand I got food poisoning one of those times.  That was the last time I ate there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-12-01", "description": "Once I watched a Subway Sandwich Artist (TM) assemble a chicken sub without ever looking down to see his creation, yielding something which only resembled a sandwich in the most abstract form.  This was in New Haven, where the food service industry prides itself on hiring employees who work with less gusto and care than anywhere else in the country.  My visit to Zona Rosa yesterday made me think for a moment that I'd somehow been transported back to gloomy New Haven.  The ingredients sat uncovered behind the counter, assumably a purposeful decision by the management to help maintain a lukewarm temperature perfect for breeding bacteria and serving up unsatisfying burritos.  The staff were clearly unconcerned with what they were preparing of service with a smile.  The burritos were overpriced, the chips were greasy and cold, and there was no salsa bar.   I'd go back here if I were starving, every other place in the Haight was closed, and I wanted salmonella.", "author": "Charles C."}

I didn't stay around to see if the staff washed their hands after handling the popcorn bags. They also can't hold on to their liquor license.", "author": "Arthur B."}
