With a few locations in the Bay they have gotten more and more popular! \n\nThis location does get busy, but the employees work efficiently and get drinks out in a timely manner. The lines are almost always long at this location. There also isn't much a sitting space so it's more of order your drink, wait, then go. \n\nNow onto the important stuff, the drinks! My go to from Boba guys is usually the matcha latte, but I went with the Hong Kong Style (Milk Tea). Can't go wrong with this if you can't decided. I suggest you ask the cashier about the suggested sweetness level as they don't recommend 100% as it can be a little too sweet for most people. The boba is always great and made just right. Can't go wrong with any of their items here.", "author": "Chris N."}

I'm personally a milk tea fan and I don't find they're the best for them but people love their matcha drinks and I know they're an SF staple so we'll continue to bring our out of town friends by for a quick drink :).", "author": "Emily N."}

Not to say that all the bobas I have had are good, but most of the time even the ones that are just meh taste OK to me.  So, for the most part, I will drink just about any boba.  I was in SF recently for a quick trip and while doing some sightseeing, I landed in Mission.  After struggling to find Mission (I was trying to be adventurous and took public transportation, which was an EPIC fail), I was ready for a cool drink.  The last time I was in SF, I remember that I passed by Boba Guys, but the line was way too long.  However, this time around, the line was still long, but not as long as before.  So, I waited about 20 minutes to order my boba. \n\nAs for the menu itself, you can customize your boba (similar to all the other boba places) with the type of milk, sweetness, ice, etc. I settled for a jasmine green tea with boba, which my normal go to order.  There is an extremely small counter seating inside, but somehow I was able to find a seat.  (Note that if you sit there though, you might be in several photos of people trying to instagram in front of super cute painting of an anteater drinking a boba.  I just squished myself to the side.) After ordering, it took about another 15 minutes to actually get my boba.  After my first sip, I was very disappointed.  After a 45 minute, I was expecting my mind to be blown.  The jasmine tea had a weird after taste to it.  I could not put my finger on it, but later I realized that this was because they probably used the tea leaves or tea bags a little too long which caused a bitter after taste.  The boba was just average, just OK.  I had a sip of someone's oolong tea and this was a little better with no aftertaste. Maybe if I had it with a milk the aftertaste could have been hidden, but still this was very disappointing to me. \n\nIt looks like SF does not have too many boba options, but with the long wait and poor boba at the end, I do not think I will ever come back here.  (Random comparison, I went to a pretty popular boba place near LA this weekend.  Even though, there was a wait, I was able to get a very good boba within 15 minutes of when I entered the store).", "author": "Jane L."}

The horchata was ok, it didn't taste like traditional horchata, but I didn't think it was going to. The strawberry matcha latte however, was delicious! I didn't think I was gonna like the strawberry pur\u00e9e with the matcha latte but it was great!! \n\nThe best part about boba guys is their boba. It is really perfect.

I actually really enjoyed the Matcha Mango - it wasn't heavy and the matcha wasn't as overpowering like other matcha drinks I've had, you were actually able to taste the mango! The Ube Halaya wasn't my favorite - the flavors didn't go that well for me, the coconut milk overpowered the Ube flavor, and was overall a very heavy drink - I definitely wouldn't order this again.

There are around 5 locations in the numerous neighborhoods of San Francisco.\n\nI chose the Classic Black milk tea (without boba of course) - smooth, frothy, and had a distinct, robust black tea flavor while still containing a balance of the familiar malty-like milk element. I ordered the drink 50% sweetened (the recommended sweetener level suggested on the menu), since nowadays I prefer tea and even coffee drinks to be less sweet.\n\nMy sister ordered the Jasmine Green milk tea (with boba), also ordering it half sweetened. I sampled her drink (trying to strategically sip it so I didn't suck up a tapioca pearl through the straw) and it was a superbly made tea drink, too! The green tea had a mellow, natural flavorings combined with a hint of a floral-esque taste.\n\nFYI, the tea drinks can also be ordered as a hot version (12 or 16 oz size); iced version (16 or 24 oz size). And there are four milk options to choose from, including vegan options: organic dairy milk (the milk I chose for my tea drink), almond milk, oat milk, or no milk.\n\nOverall, an exceptional milk tea experience!

The atmosphere of the shop itself was very open and welcoming- I believe the clean, white, & minimalistic decor is a signature style of this brand. The staff & cashier were quick to get their jobs done. \n\nThe drink itself was delicious. I got 50% sugar with boba. The matcha is very smooth & light- but the taste of tea is definitely in there. Even at 50% sugar I thought the drink was still fairly sweet, but I think this is because the boba was largest contributing factor to the sweetness in the drink. The boba here is super soft, slightly chewy, and tastes as if it was drenched in honey beforehand. So the drink itself was perhaps cut down in sugar, but the boba definitely upped the sweetness level. But I still enjoyed the drink very much! \n\nDefinitely looking forward to coming back.", "author": "Tammy W."}

I got whole milk, 100% sweetness, and boba.

They make it fresh so you will do yourself a favor by getting this.  The tea itself is also good.  I wouldn't say its the best tea I've ever had, and the tea flavor itself is really a little more muted then I'd like.  But!  It's for the masses.  And it is quite enjoyable.

That's a tall claim and I'll need to try all the things on the menu to be sure, but from the basics (teas and milk teas) which you can get elsewhere to their more unique specially drink options (such as the strawberry matcha latte), Boba Guys consistently delivers on chewy, flavorful and not too sweet goodness!\n\nThe milk teas are some of the best I've ever had not just in the bay. They use Straus Family Creamery organic milk accompanied with their in house brewed heirloom premium teas. Their syrups are also house-made so no powders and artificial replacements!\n\nTheir Strawberry Matcha Latte is not only delicious but also a show stopper and instagramable with its 3 tiers of goodness. It's still the boba and matcha you love but with a new twist. I'd definitely recommend it in addition to trying the classics of course. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough strawberry and it was mostly overpowered by the matcha flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-21", "description": "On a cool spring day, my friend from SF decided to visit me on the East Coast. She told me about Boba Guys, a shop declaring that they have the highest quality boba milk tea in the world. As someone who has had boba around the world and drinks boba like water, I was intrigued. I came to visit her two months later, leaving my halcyon New England summer to brave that famously cool SF mist. \n\nWhen I arrived at Boba Guys, I was struck by an overwhelming sense of confusion. This place claims to break down cultural barriers, and yet all I could find was a bunch of cool hipsters taking orders in an establishment that could have been any of the other bastions of the millennial foodie craze. What cultural barriers did Boba Guys manage to break down? It almost seems like they did the opposite and uprooted boba tea from its Chinese roots into yuppie land.\n\n\"Give the place the benefit of the doubt,\" I said. So I waited, and thirty minutes later, I had boba in my hands. I ordered both the classic milk tea and the matchata. It was a long wait, but the check out process was seamless, and  I had a good chuckle when I noticed the \"Boba Bae\" t-shirts on the wall. I imagined a tribe of Boba Bae influencers promoting the \"next level quality\" that Boba Guys claims to offer. Amped up by the hype, I took my first sip, hoping their #fightthepowder ethos would change the way I saw boba, but alas, I was disappointed.\n\nWas it me? Did I expect too much? Did I order the wrong thing? Nevertheless, here is my experience:\n\n1. Boba - to me this is the most important aspect of the drink. Unfortunately what I experienced was inconsistency in bite. Some pearls were perfectly al dente, some were gooey and slimy, and some were rock hard on the teeth. They claim that they are ballsy, that they don't break your heart, but guess what, Boba Guys, you broke my heart with how you made those balls!\n\n2. Tea - the way they brewed the tea led me to question if they actually gave 110% a damn in everything they do. The tea and the milk, independent of the sugar, should balance each other. The sugar acts as a flavor enhancer in the background. I did not get sugar because I wanted to taste how well they performed the flavor balance between tea and milk. The tea overpowered the milk, a bitter dryness lingered on my tongue, and I knew from that moment that the tea was brewed past its peak.\n\n3. Ice - Why would I rate the ice? It's just ice after all - but to me, the ice cuts and balances the richness from the milk and it is important, so important, that boba places let you choose how much ice you want (Boba Guys does not) What keeps me coming back to boba milk tea is the lusciousness of it all. Unfortunately, I could not taste this lusciousness in my Boba Guys milk tea. What went wrong in their small batch drink making? Did they not taste their artisanal creation? Was my order in an assembly line of drinks that got watered down when I finally received my order? \n\nSad and dejected from my classic milk tea experience, I thought I would find hope in the Matchata. But there was no flavor! Where was the cinnamon rice goodness in the horchata? Where was the earthy clean taste in the matcha? Sure, the two toned drink looked cool on Instagram, but I was expecting more :(\n\nBoba Guys, you say you aren't afraid to try new things, and I wanted to like that about you. But when you don't cook the boba evenly, when you source loose leaf tea but don't brew the tea with respect, when you get great ingredients but don't pay closer attention to balance of flavor, I can't like you. \n\nYet like all hyped things, you'll persist and grow. You'll reach the yuppies not accustomed to venturing into their Chinatowns for milk tea. But it won't be better, and I'll be ballsy myself and say that, in the figurative and literal sense, your boba milk tea is the watered down version of the boba milk tea that I know and love.", "author": "Barbara B."}

I only tried a sample of this and liked it, but do think that it would have been too heavy for me as a whole drink. \nStrawberry matcha latte - I hear that this is the drink to get, so I've been wanting to try it for quite some time. It comes out in three beautifully-colored layers. I personally would have preferred more of a strawberry flavor, but I enjoyed this regardless (though not as much as other people seem to).\nHojicha roasted green milk tea - I absolutely love hojicha in general because of the fragrant \"ricey\" flavor. It was good here and my fiance liked his drink.\nStrawberry jasmine tea fresca - I had this at the wedding I attended and not at this shop, but I'll throw it in this review anyway because it was perfectly refreshing, just like the description says. I liked it a lot!\nSoy milk tea - also an item I tried at the wedding. The couple was so thoughtful to include this milk tea option for guests who can't have dairy! I'm so glad I'm not lactose intolerant though, because the soy milk tea tastes watered down and isn't nearly as delicious as regular milk tea.\n\nI love how they allow you to sample things at the counter - one of the things we tried was this lychee coconut juice that isn't on their regular menu. I took a sip of it after I had already ordered, but we all agreed it would be something we would like to get next time! Great taste with both the lychee and coconut flavors coming through, and wonderfully refreshing on a warm day. I do feel that the prices at Boba Guys are very slightly higher than some other places, but they use organic milk and no powders in their drinks, so it's worth it.

The folks there are exceptionally nice, the place is very clean, the signage is good, the branding is strong, and they make it clear that if you're not happy, they'll make it right. All fantastic characteristics of a stand-out place. Those are the positives.\n\nThe negatives are that the price of goods is high, much higher than any other bubble tea place. We can excuse that a bit since (according to the marketing) the ingredients are top notch--but it's still pretty high. $5.50 is what a classic bubble tea with tapioca balls will run you. The most expensive place in NYC (in Manhattan) is gonna run $4.50, and it's gonna be taste just as good. The other thing I didn't much care for is that the large bubble tea contained a TON of ice. Is it to make the tea cold? If so, I think the better way to handle that is to go ham on the tea in a cocktail shaker with ice, then pour into the cup with a smaller amount of ice to maintain temp.\n\nThis all said, the tea was good, the place was clean, the folks were friendly, but I don't think I'd go again.

They also have a number of specialty drinks like frescas and strawberry rice milk, a few of which don't have caffeine if you'd like to avoid it. \n\nMy go-to is the Classic Milk Tea with tapioca balls, oat milk and 50% sweetness. They use premium tea so I always want that flavor to come through, and at 50% sweetness I definitely can taste the black tea without it being too bitter and still having that milk tea flavor and consistency. \n\nThe vibe is clean and minimalist, and service is fast and friendly which is always a cherry on top to tasty treats.

However, I noticed a fair bit of deterioration in standards in particular at this location.\n\nRegarding taste: I asked for 50% sweetness for my hojicha with milk and pearls, and it was sweeter than my friend's order of the same thing, but with 75% sweetness. Please tell me how that is possible... I had it re-made, and it was still sweeter than hers. We were confused, but I honestly couldn't be bothered to ask them to make it again. \n\nOK, on to the service: People at boba guys have always been super nice, super accommodating, and honestly, that's a little part of why you're willing to pay $2 more than you would elsewhere for boba, right? This lady yesterday making the boba was awful and grumpy and just plain rude. She literally accidentally flung a plastic cup in my friend's face (while grabbing a cup to make a drink) and just turned around and walked away! Did not apologize OR acknowledge what happened even though my friend caught the cup and handed it back to her nicely (she took the cup back from my friend so she obviously knew it happened, but just ignored her and walked away). \n\nWhen I asked for my drink to be remade (because a 50% sweet drink should not be sweeter than a 75% sweet drink), the gentleman who took my request was very kind and immediately offered to remake it, but the same lady (who made it and overheard the question) didn't even look at me and just barked \"what happened!?\" and then walked away. Excuse me, but you made it wrong (and you just literally flung a cup in my friend's face without apologizing).\n\nHow awful! I loved boba guys so much I used to want to visit whenever I could, but honestly yesterday was so disappointing. Cloyingly sweet drink, boba was kinda soggy and clumpy, and to top it off, a cup flung in your face with no apology. Just gonna shake my head and walk away. I'll probably still visit boba guys, but definitely NOT this location.", "author": "Su Lin Y."}

But, hey Thanks Facebook. \n\nI'm such a boba/milk tea addict. When me and my boyfriend finally decided to go on a spur of the moment type deal, I was so happy like a kid finding out she's going to Disneyland (ok maybe not that excited..but you get the point). Parking is horrible. Like any San Francisco parking you have to drive around the block multiple times and hope someone moves so you can swoop in and take their spot. We circled the block maybe 10+ times until my boyfriend wanted to give up, but we there and I didn't want to lose hope. We were about to just park in a red area and hope we can just run in and get our drinks, when thank the boba gods! the car in front of us moved!! .. it was fate! \n\nThis location is pretty small. I was surprised at how small it was. But, hey its San Francisco and I'm getting Boba, at this point I couldn't care less. I'm a real sucker for anything Matcha. So picture my excitement when I saw a Matcha green tea latte. Yup, I ordered that with boba. My boyfriend on the other hand is a boba novice and is starting to get into it, but he loves his horchata and as I predicted he ordered their horchata and loved it. I personally can't say I liked the horchata, since I've always hated horchata. But, their green tea latte was amazing! It had such great rich flavor that I have never tasted before. \n\nOverall I love Boba Guys and am officially addicted to their Matcha green tea latte and crave it frequently. I'm glad that they finally opened a location closer to home, in San Carlos. So I've actually been there more often. \n\nI would defiantly recommend this place to others especially to anyone into boba and milk teas. \nThis place defiantly takes the #1 spot for me!", "author": "Rochelle M."}

Luckily, they have really great customer service and will remake you a drink if you ask. Boba is typically good here with a chewy consistency and strong taste as well. Other drinks that are popular are the HK milk tea (super sweet side), Thai tea, and the strawberry matcha. \n\nHonestly I think a main reason I don't like boba guys as much is because their milk teas just doesn't taste like the traditional places (ten ren) that are my favorite! they aren't bad though, so definitely give it a try.", "author": "Anna L."}

The weather that day was in the high 80s and low 90s, so if the trio colored matcha strawberry latte wasn't eye catching enough, then the fact everybody was standing in an open field under the blazing sun was. \n\nOn our way back to the train station, we actually took the wrong bus, ended up going the opposite, and became very, very lost. By coincidence, we ended up a block away from this particular Boba Guys on 19th Street and decided to drop by. And WOW. Apparently (by the amount of Matcha Festival cups lying around inside and out of the store), a good deal of the festival attendants came out this way to try out more of their stuff. So congrats, Boba Guys! You're investment seemed to pay off pretty well while we there! \n\nThis particular store is pretty small. It's a counter, a bit of room, and a counter-bar along the window. During the time we were there, 30-40 people were trying to occupy that space all at once. There was a literal line that went out the door and down past the next door building and a number of people passing us by were calling us crazy. Which, screw you too, buddy. But that does highlight the point that this place wasn't really built to have a whole lot of people sit down and linger here, though they did say their other locations ARE. They all seem to have a clean, almost See's-candy like aesthetic, but more hipster. Largely relies on natural light, which I appreciate. \n\nTo me, Boba Guys covers an variety of styles and types of milk tea (Thai Tea, Hong Kong Tea, your give coffee milk tea) and a number of different kinds of teas. It's gratifying because you usually go to one place and they have an assortment of that TYPE of tea/milk tea (ex. a list of Hong Kong styled milk tea + [insert flavor]). They also have a variety of snacks at the front container. There were SMALL WAFFLES, OKAY. THEY LOOKED BEAUTIFUL AND DELICIOUS. Oh, and for those who haven't had this kind of matcha latte before where the layers are initially separate, remember to Instagram or whatever first, then stir it before drinking. They also keep a pitcher of water and a stack off cups on the side table where the straws are, or at least they did while we were there. If you see that the pitcher(s) is empty, move or leave it on the pickup counter so the staff doesn't have to wade out into the crowd to get it. It also has the bonus of getting the pitcher refilled more quickly. Anyways, their milk tea isn't overly sweet, but I'd highly recommend the 25% level of sweetness. My friend found her 50% matcha latte to be a bit on the sweeter side and I'm inclined to agree. I'm hoping to visit one of their other locations soon, they're spreading like wildfire!", "author": "Christine L."}

Their drinks are so unique and you can't find them anywhere else! You can also tell they really put effort into the quality of their drinks and care about their customers' needs. Not once have I ever been disappointed by their drinks or customer service! \n\nI love the location of this Boba Guys. It's located smack-dab right in the Mission, surrounded by tons of yummy restaurants and pretty close to the Castro and Dolores Park! BEWARE THOUGH, parking can be a nightmare though and it might take you a while to find. The shop itself is pretty small, and there's usually a line of customers trailing down the sidewalk. The wait can be long, but it's worth it if you have the time. This is a great place to grab boba after lunch or dinner with friends or family! \n\nWhat's great about their drinks is that you can alter the sweetness and ice level, and for the ones that have milk you can substitute it for a non-dairy version, such almond milk or oat milk! So far, I've tried the Classic, Thai, Jasmine, Iced Matcha Latte and Hong Kong Style. My favorite has to be the Hong Kong Style and Thai Tea. The Hong Kong Style is black milk tea made with condensed milk. It has a richer, creamier taste than just the regular Classic, and it tastes sooo good with the boba or egg pudding. Their Thai Tea is also probably the best I've ever had. I usually ask for more half and half in it since I like it creamier, and it's perfect! Do i even need to get started on their boba? There's something about the boba here that makes it tastes so different from other places...It has the perfect chewiness and sweetness and I can't get enough.\n\nOverall, this place is a must if you're ever in San Francisco.

The wait for getting drink wasn't too long maybe only 3-5 minutes. They are efficient once you ordered. \n\nI looked at their menu from their shop, I was undecided because they have so much premium tea and house special tea. Finally, I ordered classic milk tea (Decaf Black) that is non-caffeine which is really suit me. Because I cannot take coffee or stronger tea. They could make me feel very awake later. I added black pearl into my drink because they are famous with their boba. The boba is soft and sweet. I got unsweetened milk tea and less ice. I would say it's perfect for me. Because the tea don't taste sweet but with its boba, it's kind satisfied. My hubby ordered lychee green tea with black pearl. And it taste light to us.\n\nYou can choose organic milk, soy milk or almond milk. Added topping would cost $0.50. You can adjust sugar and ice level. They serve 2 sizes for hot and cold.

During my first trip I got their Strawberry Matcha Latte with boba and was really let down, it was way too sweet, the drink seemed a bit too gritty for my liking and I felt that the strawberry overwhelmed the matcha flavor. The boba was indeed cooked well, which was the only redeeming factor. I was pretty let down considering the drink wasn't what my Instagram hopes and dreams were tastewise and almost $6 for a drink didn't make sense.

This time 25% sweet. Was I crazy? Had I developed an affinity for a more pure milk tea drink without tons of sweetener? Had my first sip and BINGO! That's the type of drink that made me realize Boba Guys definitely has something. Absolutely, refreshing and well brewed Jasmine Tea, creamy Strauss milk and 25% sweetness was perfect. I suppose, for those without a sweet tooth ... do yourself a favor and get 25% for a slight sweetness that allows you to taste the flavor of the milk tea. The almond jelly was okay, a little more of the harder side and difficult to drink through the straw leaving me to have about half of it left over in my cup. \nSide note, the almond jelly does contain dairy (for those lactose intolerant).\n\nPrice is a bit steep for a drink, but I can see how it translates as Boba Guys provides quality ingredients and doesn't use gimmicks in order to draw in customers.

What I didn't know was that they were all over San Francisco, including the Mission!\n\nIt was a Saturday evening coming here, so parking was extra difficult.  While one of circle around, the 3 of us jumped out to get in NO line (woo-hoo!) and ordered.\n\nThis location is very small with no where to sit or really to stick around for long.  This place is more of a \"take-out\" place.\n\nLooking at their menu, I can see what the big deal was! They seem to have a variety of unique Boba drinks that I don't usually see at other Boba spots.  They also have merchandise, haha.\n\nSo here's what I had:\n\nMATCHATA (16 oz) - $4.75\n+$0.50 Boba \nA secret menu item turned not-so-secret.  Organic matcha whisked over their house made horchata.\nSee what I mean?!! Matcha AND horchata!!! I could I possibly pass this up!  The only thing about this one is there is no sweetness adjustment, which I'm completely fine about.  I did like how it's not so sweet.  Besides you get a lot of the sweetness from the warm and chewy (pretty much perfect) tapioca balls.  When this was given to me, you have the bottom layer of the warm boba, then the white layer of matcha, and the top layer is the matcha.  You stir it and let be ice mix it all up! This taste was quite unique--you get this slight gritty semi-sweet texture from the horchata and the earthy taste from the matcha.  I recommend trying this one.\n\nKAYA TOAST - $3.50\nA thick slice of brioche toast served warm with their own housemade kaya coconut jam.\nSo the kaya coconut jam is like this sweet custardy spread that is mixed with coconut milk and has pandan leaf flavor.  The consistency is like condensed milk.  The Boba Guys made their very own!  This took some time to make but the it's worth it!  I would say around 5 minutes (it just seems long compared to how fast drinks are made here).  The kaya toast was served warm, cute into 4 and topped with a decent amount of kaya.  It was so delightful and made me miss Singapore so much.  I wish I had taken a look to see if they sell a jar of their kaya.\n\nI really am impressed. The staff was friendly and efficient.  I hope to come back soon to try everything else. Thanks Boba Guys!", "author": "Tu-Anh N."}

What separates it from other boba places I've been to (chatime, cocos, kung fu, vivis) is the high quality of tapioca. Its substantially chewy and has a nice bounce. Also the ratio of tea to boba is spot on. I asked for less ice and 25% sugar. Although i didn't use it, I like the option of adding sugar syrup.

My only drawback from this place is the way they handle their honey or syrup because I could feel the stickiness from handling my cup. \n\nMaybe if you never had boba before, you would be mind blown because milk tea is awesome in general and you've been missing out your whole life. But if you visit boba shops a lot, Boba Guys doesn't really stand out in particular. They do have some interesting menu options that are different from your regular boba places.\n\nShop is quite small and there's four stools by the window counter. Definitely a cute hipster place for tourists to come check out and discover the world of boba and get that Instagram photo in. I hear lines can get pretty long.

It wasn't like the standard boba shops where milk tea is a dime a dozen. Boba Guys was all about fresh ingredients, fighting the powder, and offered a different way to drink your boba. We all went for the Horchata!  \n\nWhile drinking our Horchata and trying to take pics, a guy offered to take a group photo of us. Coming from New York the thought did cross my mind that this guy might be a camera thief. Quickly my paranoid thoughts were washed away as the guy turned out to be one of the owners of Boba Guys, Andrew. He was super nice. We talked to him for a bit about how we liked our drinks and he gave us some insider information that at the time they were considering opening up shop in Manhattan.\n\nFast forward to about three years later, I am happy to say that I can now get my Boba Guys in Manhattan.

Some of the people in the line were particularly rude but that might have been the one negative thing.  The menu, to me and my daughter, was not the easiest thing to piece together.  Luckily, there are instructions.  There are lots of things you could add to your drink: boba, almond milk, different jellies, etc.  You could ask also for your drink to be more or less sweet. THat's always a nice thing but sometimes I feel it's hard to judge when you don't know what their idea of SWEET or LESS SWEET are. Their boba was pretty good. The staff were super sweet and friendly. I kind of hoped that there would be more a selection as far as their offerings but the things that they had were really good.  I wasn't impressed with their liege waffle with the chocolate drizzle.  I was hoping that it would have been made in house. It was packaged from some outside company and delivered there. Umm, I don't think I'll make that same mistake twice. It wasn't good at all. In fact, my daughter wouldn't even eat it. I had their refresher. It was just that, refreshing.  The matchata wasn't all that.  It was nothing special at all. I can't tell you even what was missing. All around it was missing that UUMMPPHH that makes it special.  The one thing that I did really like was the strawberry matcha.  It was not only pretty but it was just sweet enough and just strong enough. I'd return for another one of those. The cost isn't more than what I'm used to at home in SoCal.

Tiny little place with line out the door looked promising but didn't deliver.\n\nI ordered the Thai Iced Tea with boba. The tea was pretty good and made with organic Strauss milk. They definitely take pride in using good, quality ingredients. However, maybe I was there on a bad day because whoever cooked up the batch of boba clearly never checked that it was cooked through. Nothing worse than biting into a boba to find it hard in the center like partially cooked pasta. No matter how good the tea was, it didn't make up for the awful texture of the boba. Definitely not worth the trip out to the Mission. \n\nSorry guys but you can't call yourself the Boba Guys and post up signs about your \"Grade-A Balls\" if the boba you serve is not even cooked all the way through.", "author": "Betty R."}

Boba is softer rather than firmer (which I like). \n\nThey don't have a huge variety of drinks, but in a way it makes it seem more \"high-class\" and easy to choose. Before you order, make sure to check out the seasonal flavors on the side of the ordering counter. I usually end up picking some fruity flavor from there (strawberry jasmine tea fresca, strawberry matcha, and peach green tea were all great). \n\nOverall, it's a bit expensive for the price ($4-5), but if you're here, you probably don't have an easy alternative.

The line can get long and extend outside, but it does move pretty quick. \n\n[[Iced Matcha Latte with Boba]] Lately, I have been obsessed with anything matcha, so this drink was definitely calling my name. The matcha was smooth, bold, and not chalky. I absolutely hate it when matcha drinks are chalky. Yuck! The boba was soft and chewy; a little sweet, but not too bland either. Add-ons are an extra 50 cents, but so worth it! \n\nThe first time I went, I didn't have them change the sweetness level and kept it at 100%. Now I am one to usually take my drinks pretty sweet. But this was just way too sweet. So the 2nd time I went, I had them knock it down to 75% and it was a little better. The next time I go, I think I'll do 50% sweetness.\n\nYou can choose from regular milk, almond, or soy milk you won't get charged extra! Sweet! \n\nIt is a bit pricey here. If I remember correctly it was around $5 for the 24 oz. However, the pricing is reflected in the quality ingredients, so it's definitely worth it.\n\nMy first time here, I drove, so I was lucky enough to find a spot (metered, of course) within a 5 minute walking distance.

Prices are also comparatively higher, but you can tell that the boba and tea ingredients are quality, so perhaps the prices are justified. \n\nI got a 16oz Golden Black Tea with almond jelly, 25% sweet. I personally like my milk tea to have a stronger tea flavor, and Boba Guys lived up to expectations with a fragrant, fresh flavor that was not overwhelmed by the milk. The almond jelly had a nice, subtle sweetness, but the texture was a little harder than I expected. It was a lightly sweet and refreshing drink for a warm, sunny day in the park.

If you're trying bubble tea for the first time, go to Boba Guys and you won't be disappointed. I've had consistently good quality of tapioca and tea from this place. For sure 5 stars for the drinks and marketing, but had to knock off one star because of long lines and there's very little seating. This is a place to grab and go unless you come at a really random time. I wish there was more seating here so I could hang out while drinking my bubble tea.\n\nThis is one of the few regular bubble tea places that serve the Hong Kong style milk tea, which is black milk tea made with condensed milk. I really enjoy it as it's not too sweet (but I do usually get 50% sweetness on drinks here). They also serve a Horchata drink which is unique and good as well. Their classics like the jasmine milk tea and the iced matcha latte are always delicious and a staple for me. To me, their menus and choices are straightforward and easy to understand. Even first timers would be able to go through the bubble tea ordering process.\n\nPositives:\n+ Consistently good quality\n+ Interesting marketing\n+ Some unique drinks\n\nNegatives:\n- Pretty long lines\n- Very little seating available\n\nRecommend:\n+ 50% sweetness\n+ Hong Kong style milk tea \n+ Iced matcha latte", "author": "Angie N."}

That might depend on how much boba tea you guzzle, which if you are young, gifted and Asian, could be enough to give you a permanent brain freeze or cause suffocation by excess tapioca balls. Now I'm not a doctor, I just play one on TV, but the popularity of boba tea has been unequivocally mind-blowing, and the Boba Guys, Andrew Chau and Bin Chen, appear to be riding the wave by offering their own fashion-forward take on it.\n\nI finally tried their product at their first shop after dinner at Hogs & Rocks up the block. It's not my first time trying boba tea, but it might as well have been, since it took me a while to make my way through their menu as I was surrounded by impatient hipsters heaving audible groans in my direction. I impulsively went for the $3.50 Iced Coffee Milk Tea since I wasn't getting any guidance from the order taker. Then I was asked a battery of questions that led me to customize my drink. First, it was the tapioca balls over coffee jelly for an extra fifty cents.\n\nThen I chose the Straus Family Organic Milk over a soy or almond milk substitute, which I assume caters to the lactose intolerant among us. Finally, I had them turn the sweetness up to 100% which is their default option. I must admit the result was pretty refreshing (photo: http://bit.ly/1mpEuVo) as I pondered the meaning of the aardvark logo (photo: http://bit.ly/1R5KaAG), though in hindsight, I probably would have taken the sweetness down a notch.

As simple as it sounds, very few places can make it just right. \n\nBrother recently came up from LA and we paid this place a visit. Came here with the only intention of ordering Jasmine Milk Tea - while I typically like it 50% sweet, my crazy brother likes to ask for 150% sweet. \n\nBasically, tried it. Don't like it. I could barely taste the Jasmine Tea in it! Why?? Usually 50% sweet hits the spot, but for some reason, the drink had no flavor. Not sweet. No Jasmine. What's up with that?? So confused... \n\nSide note: Brother told me I ordered the drink all wrong - can't mess with the original taste apparently...unless you want more sweet, of course. Fine, I'll give it a another chance. \n\nSO I gave it a second try this past weekend. Came back with my BFF yesterday and ordered the same drink. Original. Regular sweet, regular ice. Results = omg, still no. The original is wayy too sweet. I took one sip of it and didn't want it anymore. All I could taste was the sugar and no tea flavor. \n\nAll in all, my brother loves you guys, but I don't. When I visit him in SoCal, you'll see me at Seven Leaves where Jasmine Milk Tea is done right. \n\nP.S. Service was friendly and drinks were made quickly. Drinks were a def no go though. \n\nTwo stars for the service. Zero for the flavor in drinks.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

When they first opened, I saw a lot of it on instagram/twitter/facebook and didn't think too much of it. To me, it mostly seemed like a novelty hipster place where people just went to take pictures (ha ha ha). The mission district is a bit of a drive from my house so I never had an urge to try it either. One of my friends finally suggested we go after dinner and I obliged because I was curious and she really liked it the last time she had it.. and also she was driving haha!\n\nThere was absolutely noooo parking on a Friday night so one of us double parked while the other 2 went in to order. I got the Hong Kong milk tea with boba, and my friends got an iced matcha latte and a classic black milk tea with soymilk (yes! You can sub reg milk for soy).\n\nWe were the only ones there so the drinks came out in a few minutes. I took my first sip and I was in milk tea heaven!!! It has a hint of condensed milk so that makes it sweeter too. The boba is really chewy and soft here... It's a little more overcooked than most places but that makes it so much more squishy and delicious! I got to try my friends' drinks too and the matcha latte was really good as well! The matcha flavor really stood out and it looks cool before you mix it with all the layers. Just be sure that they've mixed the matcha completely, or else you might get little bitter balls of matcha at the bottom of your drink...\n\nI will definitely be back!! I can't believe I underestimated this place haha. The only bad thing is that drinks are a bit pricey here.

Pretty inconsistent with the others ):\n\n- Classic Milk Tea w/ almond jelly: Drink was good but the best part was the almond jelly. It was AMAZING!!

The first time I ordered it, it was the best I've had from here... creamy and delicious... still able to taste just the slightest bit of bitterness from the green tea, but the overall sweetness from their homemade syrup. The inconsistency that I mentioned about is the way they whisk their matcha powder. I understand that it may be hard to whisk extrrreeeeemely thorough, but I sometimes end up drinking balls and clumps of matcha powder, which you can imagine is very bitter and unpleasant. It makes the experience of drinking the drink a little dreadful to be honest.

If you're looking for authentic, Taiwan-style boba, do not expect to get it here. \n\nI think that living in Taiwan has made me hypercritical of boba in the US. That said, I can still appreciate boba here. With all the hype around Boba Guys, I was very skeptical. Now that I've been, I can say that I was unimpressed. \n\n- Jasmine milk tea with boba\n- Horchata with boba\n- Muscat oolong milk tea with boba\n\nI went with three friends: all of us of Taiwanese decent, all of us have lived in Taiwan. We all felt the tea was very bland and the boba itself too sweet. My jasmine milk tea felt very watered down. I couldn't really taste the tea. I know people might say it tastes watered down because they use milk instead of creamer, but that shouldn't affect the tea strength, just the creaminess. I had adjusted mine to be no ice and 25% sugar, too. My other friends also felt the teas were watered down and the drinks too sweet. \n\nMy friend complained about the cups. The lids are a little annoying and pop off if you squeeze the cup. Also, the tea kind of goes everywhere when you try putting the straw in. \n\nI feel like Boba Guys is targeted at a very specific group of people: the trendy, hip crowd. Boba isn't meant to be fancy and describing it as \"heirloom tea with organic milk\" only adds to the annoyingness of Boba Guys. But that's just me. I mean, boba wasn't created to be some healthy, pretentious drink, but that seems to be how they're trying to market it here. \n\nAnyways, boba goodness might be subjective. As long as you're not looking for a CoCo or 50\u5d50, you can try Boba Guys and decide for yourselves. Personally, I won't be back. There is better boba in the city.", "author": "Eifeh S."}

I ordered a house milk tea with boba, almond jelly, and soy milk (50% sweetness and light ice). The milk tea formula wasn't the best that I've had, and that really shot the drink down for me. I'd probably rank their classic soy milk tea at around 2 to 3 stars (it's not the worst I've had, however it didn't make me want to go back for more). \n\nI would, however, consider going back in the future and trying their more unique drinks (such as the matcha-based ones or the specials menu on the side of the register).

A friend suggested this place as she had been here before and said it was good. \n\nCafe: funny signs and quirky sayings are inviting as soon as you walk in. Like a lot of places in sf it's a pretty small standing area and seating bar area for about 2 or 3 people. \n\nMenu: much different and simpler than any boba place I've been too. The items on the menu are basic teas: Thai,  horchata, rose, green, black, milk, chai, jasmine, and Hong Kong. \n\nToppings: tapioca balls (boba balls), almond jelly, grass jelly.  Tried the grass jelly and almond milk on the side, the almond jelly tasted like the inside of a coconut ( a little earthy, jiggly and like almond lol), the grass jelly was a little better and more tasteless but both I wouldn't put in my drink. \n\nTaste/order: Ordered everything on the menu. Boba itself was chewy and fresh, save a few old hard ones that got mixed in. Thai tea was classic, tasty, sweet, everything you want. Classic milk tea was for lack of better words... Classic, a little low on sweetness. Hong Kong was allright, tasted like a mix of classic and Thai tea. Horchata: \"it nibbled on my tastebuds\", it was cinnamony, everything you expect from horchata. Rose: pretty decent actually, surprised me with the sweet little kick it had. \n\nService: very friendly. The lady at the cashier was patient and understanding, she probably had dealt with confusion about the menu before. \n\nDrink sizes: 16oz and 24oz \n\n*can switch milks around in drinks: almond milk instead of regular, other options, a lot of boba places don't have. \n\n**cant change Thai tea sweetness, premade. \n\n3 stars because old boba balls threw me off, drink choice was different but nothing was amazing for me, nothing I couldn't get from a different place for less price, oh yeah and it was a bit pricey for no reason, couldn't change the sweetness of my favorite drink.

My friend's muscat oolong was the same way, and way too sweet for me at 75%.\n\nThe person taking my order was nice and made sure that I would get what I wanted. My drink also came out super fast. The store was marketing itself as having high class, special blend teas when I could hardly even taste it. It felt like it was hopping on the boba trend and trying to turn it hip and trendy whilst not paying attention to their drinks. I would come back maybe one more time if I find myself in the area to try their matcha latte, but it's not worth a trip especially with so many other places closer to South Bay.", "author": "Jessica L."}

Boba Guys will be my only exception. You can adjust sweetness level, ice level, and most importantly you can choose what kind of milk you want. You can choose between fresh milk, soy milk, and almond milk. Having soy milk and almond milk definitely helps take away my milk anxieties.\n\nAs for toppings, they have boba, almond jelly and grass jelly I believe. I only tried the boba. It was super good, tasted like little gummies and super fresh. However, I did notice that they did harden a bit faster than other bobas, but if you drink your drink fast it shouldn't be a problem. \n\nAlso they have strawberry matcha, as all you Yelpers can see, this item is not shown on the menu..

While some of the balls were good, others were disgustingly hard to chew. I was a bit confused. Were the bobaristas just having a bad day, or are the boba gods just testing me?\n\nI also found the flavor of the Classic Milk Tea boring and a little G rated. I was expecting a more potent black tea sensation to seduce and satiate my olfactory receptors then cleanse and caress my taste buds, but nope. My drink was super watery and I could barely taste the tea -_- \n\nTo make matters worse, there were little pieces of almond jelly floating around my drink that did not belong there. It didn't really do much for the taste but it did look reaaally weird, like tiny flakes of dandruff. Who wants to see dandruff in their boba drink? Surely, not I. And once again, I fall into a state of disappointed confusion. Why boba guys, why.\n\nThe jasmine on the other hand was very fragrant and floral, and although it still tasted a bit watered down, I enjoyed it way more than the Classic. Not sure if there were any rogue almond jelly pieces in this drink though because the milk may have camouflaged it. \n\nThe good:\n\n*Thumbs up for organic milk and customization options! Not many boba places offer soy/almond milk swatches. \n\n*Pretty quick service! It gets pretty busy here but you'll get your drink in less than ten minutes.\n\nThe bad:\n\n*Claustrophobes beware.

An occasional moan escaping parched lips...\"where is my boba?\" \"Where is my milk tea?\" \n\nFinally, down a relatively quiet offshoot from the rush of Valencia, a sign. Small and cramped, easy to miss were it not for the 15 minute line out the door. The mysterious /Orycteropus afer/ or aardvark; a nocturnal beast native to the African continent. Whose carcass, when properly prepared, is said to grant the ability to pass through walls in the night, and perhaps lead knowing of more powerful mysteries.\n\nI peered deeply into the glass wall, allowing my eyes to focus on  a small counter, too small to be very practical, and a very few scattered bar stools.

Then I recoiled in horror...the prices...twice the cost in my former homeland! I recoiled, yet the landscape was barren for other options. The aardvark peered down at me modeling what to do. His sticky tongue darting long into the glass.  I too stood. I joined in the line, behind the many other hopeful seekers.

Unless you're tired, I'm not sure why you'd be sitting down here when you could be window-shopping on Mission, though. Since the place was a desert, the three of us sat at the bar and talked.

Ask for less sweet\n+ Must try tapioca pearls- they're perfect little balls of divinity \n+ Cash or Card accepted\n+ NO Rewards/Stamp Card Available\n+ To-go boba shop, no space to sit/enjoy\n\n[[INTRO/LOCATION]]\nI had a long day working in SF and just ate a mediocre dinner at Akiko's-- I needed boba dessert! Boba Guys has been on my radar for quite a while, so CARPE DIEM! My biggest woe was that I circled around the one-way 19th and 20th streets for 15+ minutes to find parking. I mean literally every nook and cranny were taken up. I parked on a curb not so legally...and just ran inside to grab my boba fix. The neighborhood isn't pretty either. I went around 7PM but I would not stay here when the sun sets...it looks completely muggy and robby. \n\n[[AMBIANCE]]\nThere were about 6-8 people inside the boba shop which made it way too crowded. I was getting claustrophobic. They have a few chairs around with a counter top but it's by no means an enjoyable atmosphere to relax at. The vibe is modern trendy with their minimalistic and hipster decorations. Their menu is limited but only to keep the quality of their products. So don't expect a 100+ items menu like TapEx haha, they only have the basics- classic milk tea, green, Thai, taro, etc.\n\n[[MILK TEAS]]\nTheir organic teas are authentic. It mirrored Ten Ren's taste and quality which impressed me greatly. I opted for the regular sweetness since I wanted to taste how they originally made it- big mistake. Both the Classic Milk Tea and especially the Thai Tea were wayyy too sweet, and I like Dr. Pepper so my sweet palate is already pretty high bar. \n\n[[BOBA PEARLS]]\nHowever, their boba pearls were cooked to perfection. You must try it. There is a difference between OVERCOOKED and Perfectly Cooked pearls-- Boba Guys does it right! If the pearls were overcooked, you would taste a soggy, fuzzy texture surrounding the core of the tapioca pearls before you bite into it. There would be a clear difference in textures of the outer vs inner layer of the balls. Perfectly cooked pearls are soft and chewy and with each bite, the texture is always consistent from the outer layer to the inner layer. \n\nThumb rule about boba pearls: If your tongue is confused by the texture, it's overcooked. If your tongue is soothed by the consistent soft, chewy texture through each bite, it's perfectly cooked.", "author": "Donna T."}

The options were: Original Milk tea, HK style milk tea, Jasmine milk tea, Horchata Boba, Thai Tea, Iced Matcha Latte, and Coffee Milk tea. There's also a selection of teas they brew on the spot, but it takes a bit longer. There are 3 options for addons: Boba, Almond Jelly and Grass Jelly. You can also adjust the sweetness level to your liking (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%)\n\nI ended up getting the Iced matcha latte with almond jelly at 75% and my fiance got the classic milk tea with boba at 75%. The Iced Matche latte at 75% was the perfect amount of sweetness for me with the almond jelly.

You name it. And I live far away from sunset so I can't really go purple kow that often; luckily, I found this little gem in the Mission district.\n\nBoba guys - the name doesn't sound really serious and at first I would thought it's another \"me too\" boba tea houses. But no! Just by reading their menu you can understand the owner has put a lot of thoughts on their drinks. Not only the detailed explanation of each of their signature drinks; you can also find a lot of little notes on the counter, wall etc about their vision, philosophy and origins. You can learn a lot about this place just by reading those signs.\n\nSo basically there are two big categories on their menu: specialty or signature drinks, and slow drip tea. For the latter category, you can choose sweetness and whether you want to add milk in it (and they have organic milk, California farm milk or soy milk as well). First time here, let me try their slow drip tea and see if they have done the fundamentals right.\n\n\n\n-) Muscat Oolong Milk Tea with boba: A. They brewed the tea fresh from your order, turn the teapot/funnel thing upside down, and literally let the tea drip slowly. After it's done, they would pour it into a prepared beaker with iced milk, and there you go your drink. When I first sipped it, it definitely had a very strong oolong tea flavor in it. I really like the fact that the milk was not creamy at all; rather, the milk helped bring out the taste of the tea, make it more smooth, and definitely enhanced the overall experience. Boba was definitely way above average. Soft and chewy, but it's not honey boba so it's not sweet at all, which actually makes sense or else it would not go well with the strong flavor tea.\n\nDefinitely a place that I will be visiting more often. Next time I would like to try their Hong Kong style milk tea and see how it is!", "author": "Simon C."}

It's got a little hipster vibe with their clean white walls and tatted up/I'm-not-trying-to-try-too-hard staff. Our cashier was a beautiful girl with sweet manners, and that was a great first impression of BG. \n\nMy sister got the original boba with no sweetness and I got the horchata boba--we had to add pearls to both of them OF COURSE. \n\nNow in terms of the quality, their horchata tea gets 100% and so does their chewy and deliciously rebound-y texture of boba balls!! MY GOD I think my taste buds went utterly crazy with their delicious but small cup size of boba. BUT the small cup sizes isn't going to stop me from coming back here again. Two palms up for Boba Guys, I'll def be coming back because of their high-quality tea and deliciously chewy boba.\n\n**Now if you'd ask me to compare Boba Guys and Purple Kow...I'm going to have to say, that's impossible.

It's funny because in the front they have a sign that says \"Come in a taste our grade-A balls\". And let me tell you THEY REALLY ARE GRADE-A. Definitely the best boba I've ever had - if you like the sweet, extra chewy kind (soft boba lovers this is not for you). My favorite is their strawberry matcha latte, I don't know any other place that makes a drink like this. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and strawberry flavor. I'm a sucker for matcha anything so I freaking love  this and their original matcha latte). Another favorite is the soy jasmine milk tea. \n\nCustomer service is awesome as well.

Now it's just boba.\nThe shop is cute and the boba is perfect and the drinks are delicious. The Hong Kong style milk tea tasted authentic so I was very pleased because I usually only trust asian cafes with my HK style milk tea. I'll need to come back here and try the horchata milk tea...\nDrinks come in 2 sizes: 16oz or 12oz for cold, and only 16oz for hot. It's $3.50 for a 16oz and 50cents for toppings (boba, pudding, almond jelly).\nService is fast and they're very friendly! Awesome customer service\n\nThey also sell other things like special mason jars, tin cups, buttons, shirts, tea leaves, and flavoured cotton candy. My only complaint would be the price of their cute mason jar. $12?! I understand it has their logo and a special lid with room for a straw but the it only saves you 25cents when you bring it in. And initially you have to pay $12 + the drink you want which averages $16 total.. That a bit intense for a 16oz mason jar of milk tea. And since you only save 25cents when you bring it in again, you'll need to come here at least 48 to make it worth it... The jar is SO cute, I just don't think it's worth $12.\nBESIDES THE JAR, the milk tea at Boba Guys is amazing and I think they've really nailed the science behind preparing good boba and drinks.

To be fair, I do generally prefer my drinks to be less sweet (side effect of my newfound love of beer?), but this was pretty unbearable. I'm guessing the soy was already sweet, so adding their regular amount of sugar made it extra sweet. And they didn't give me an option of sweetness level.

It was literally a hole in the wall place that sold Japanese curry and milk tea. Sounds a bit questionable right? I remember it was raved about back then too and mention of long lines. When I got there, it was empty except for one customer helping themselves to delicious smelling japanese curry. I literally thought I went to the wrong place. I asked the worker if this was Boba Guys and they said yes. They only had two options for milk tea back then, Classic Milk Tea or Jasmine. I got the classic milk tea which was pretty good and boba's texture was perfect. I didn't even know they had mason jars, but I had mine to go so of course I didn't get one.\n\nNow I recently came to the new location. Based on reviews, I tried the muskat oolong milk tea, it's very unique and it wasn't bad. The only downside was it was a tad too sweet for me (will ask for half sweet in the future). But the tapioca had perfect consistency, it was nice and chewy and sweet. I will definitely come back to try their other selections of milk tea. I really like their idea of the slow bar (yes, they use freshly brewed tea :O amazeballs). \n\nThey didn't have macarons that day :( but I tried their cotton candy and it was pretty good.\n\nThe place itself is very small, more like a grab and go place. They have very limited seating. It's also in the mission and parking can be a bit difficult.

Come to find out that they aren't like the ones in Seattle. Many are not owned by Asians. This place has a reputation of being called \"hippy bubble tea\" not sure why. I'm not from the area but from what I understand it's because it's not an Asian bubble tea place. \n\nI digress... This place is simple. Few options with selective jellies and boba add ins. They serve the typical Hong Kong milk tea, Thai iced tea, etc. Reminds me of drive thru boba in Bellevue. The boba was soft, sweet, and chewy aka perfect! They had a flavor I have NEVER seen before at a bubble tea place, Horchata! It intrigued me a lot so I ordered it. It was delicious!! \n\nI was talking to the owner a bit and he believes he has the best boba in the world. I felt that was a bold statement. He said he has compared his to many places in popular cities, however in the back of my mind I kept thinking \"drive thru boba is very similar and is just as good\". He boasted about how they make everything from scratch such as their own syrups. I think that's wonderful and I can't say whether that's not true for any other place but it's good to see that he is so passionate about what he serves.

The friendly Asian dude with glasses told us that Classic & Jasmine were the most popular, but come on, I HAD to try the horchata! \n\nOn to the review... the Classic and Horchata were both extremely sweet. It's cool that they make their own syrup and all, and they do allow for customization,  but I didn't think the regular would be so sugary! The small 16oz drinks also came PACKED with ice, not so cool considering that these drinks came out to $4 a pop. The boba was sweet and chewy, but not any sweeter or chewier than any decent competition. I personally LOVE grass jelly, but I was disappointed by their homemade batch. The squares were a bit too firm and large to easily get sucked up through the straw, and a cup of grass jelly with no drink is never any fun! \n\nAt the end of the day, this place is okay. It's cute and they have seasonal flavors like strawberry jasmine tea (I wish I tried this instead).

It was pricey, but worth it. \n\nTo me, the fact that they really stand behind the quality of their teas (\"If you don't like it, we'll make you anything else on the menu, whatever you want!\")  means a lot and isn't something you always find at a PMT/boba place. \n\nWatery?

There are all kinds of glass beakers and glass test tubes that hold tea leaves and tools like matcha whisks and such. Such a creative idea on styling the space. There was even like a glass beaker terrarium on the counter. They have a statement on their outside window by the door about how they put a lot if science into their boba making process, which is pretty clever. The only thing that would make this even more awesome is if the employees wore white lab coats and safety glasses while making the boba. But I guess that would be really hot - it was already a warm day in the Mission when I visited and it gets pretty warm inside this little shop, especially with lots of people inside. They also had some fans on, so maybe there's no central AC. So...maybe no lab coats...\n\nThey also sell cute mason jars with their logo (I think it's an aardvark? They like boba too!) for $10. Not only is it cute, but it's reusable! If you bring the glass mason jar in, you get 25 cents off your order. So you're helping the environment by reducing waste and saving some money too! Technically, you'll need to visit 40 times to break even, but if you are planning to go everyday, or even like every week for a year, it will pay for itself. Plus you can use it for other beverages at home too. It has a handle. \n\nOk, so how about the most important thing - the boba? I ordered the classic milk tea with tapioca balls - it was my visit and I needed to go with something basic. But they had a lot of other drinks on the menu that made me want to try something different - they offer an horchata boba (that's very original), an iced matcha latte, Hong Kong style boba (black tea with condensed milk), and a Thai tea boba (I love Thai iced tea). \n\nThe milk tea was really good - just the perfect sweetness. Very refreshing on such a warm day. Maybe it tasted good because they use local Straus milk, I don't know. The tapioca was just a tad chewier than I prefer. But the liquid part was yummy. I'm not a boba connoisseur but I know what I like when I taste it. Even though it was busy, my order came out in like five minutes from the time that I ordered it.

Upon ordering, the man behind the register introduced himself and a fellow barista as the owners, and gave a brief introduction to the shop and the organic, fresh ingredients they use (no creamer!). My friend and I asked about the Golden Honey Black Tea and why it was more expensive than the rest, and he happily gave us a background of the tea and what makes it so special (basically, this tea is made up of the tips aka the most expensive part of the leaf, which produces a honey-like sweetness when brewed). He told us that if we're tea enthusiasts then we would be able to tell the difference, and encouraged us to try it. If we didn't like it, he pointed to the sign posted on the wall that dictated their promise to make any drink on the menu for us if we didn't like what we got. \n\nSince he was so convincing, both of us decided to try it, Golden Honey Black Milk Tea with half sugar and pearls, and neither of us were disappointed. At first, it tasted kind of watery, but it occurred to me that this was due to the fact that they use fresh milk instead of creamer, which gives milk tea that thicker consistency, so I shifted my focus onto the tea instead. You really could taste the difference in this type of black tea; the aftertaste was indeed much sweeter, though not sugary, making this a very light and refreshing drink on a surprisingly warm San Francisco day.\n\nAnother thing -- they sell Sunny Hills Pineapple Cakes!! These are my favorite pineapple cakes that I'm only able to find in Taiwan, and I usually bring back boxes and boxes of these when either my mom or I get the chance to go visit family, so it's amazing to see that this cute little boba joint sells this too!

Absolutely unheard of, but at the same time, it kinda works...\n\nWhen trying any new boba place, I always get the original black milk tea. It's a classic, yet it tastes differently depending where you get it. Boba Guys' classic milk tea is refreshing and delicious. It's not overly sweetened, but not watered down either. I love how it has a distinct, but mild, tea taste that isn't hindered by too much cream.\n\nOne outrageous, crazy flavor Boba Guys offers is horchata. It's refreshing, and the cinnamon flavor is strong. However, it's not as creamy as I hoped, and it doesn't pair well with the sweet boba. It was a very very very strange combination that was worth a try, but not worth repurchasing, unfortunately.\n\nThe boba is sweet and chewy, but maybe shy of undercooked because some balls were just too hard. There's some inconsistency with size, and near the end of the drink, all the boba were all sticking to each other so that it was difficult sucking them up through the straw.\n\nService is super quick, friendly, and very upbeat. The shop is very clean and modern, though very small. There's only window seating that seats only 5 or 6 people. Although Boba Guys has good drinks, they're much pricier (average $4 here) than the typical boba shops on Irving St or Clement St.\n\nIn one word (or two), I call Boba Guys \"hipster boba\".", "author": "Priscilla W."}

After all, cooking is a science); their items and their souvenirs were displayed behind a glass wall, where everything was shining and placed carefully. \n\nTheir menu wasn't confusing at all! They had their original milk teas, their premium milk teas, and more. My friend ordered the horchata milk tea (which surprisingly tasted pretty good), and I ordered the Rose black milk tea. \n\nI F***ING LOVED IT. \n\nPLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, GO TO BOBA GUYS, AND ORDER IT. \n\nNot only is it sweet, but you REALLY taste the floral essence of rose.

Yeah, I did, and I would do it again.\n\nI first discovered Boba Guys after a night out in the Mission getting my Wing Wednesday on, down the street. Of course, when we saw this ultra hipster boba spot, we just had to try it. I originally got the Duke of Earl Grey Milk Tea w/Boba ($4.45), which was absolutely delicious.\n\nToday, I drove down with my roommate because we just had to get out of the library. I was surprised to see that the line went well out the door. However, the staff were all very quick and kind. I got the Iced Matcha Latte w/ Boba ($4.50) and my roommate got the Horchata w/Boba ($4.50). I know it's a little pricey, but you can taste it in the quality of the tea and the boba. I really liked the Matcha Latte, it certainly had a very strong matcha taste, and didn't taste watered down at all like other milk teas. You could tell this tea was made with love! \n\nThey've got some other really interesting flavors we wanted to try like Camomile Mint, Lychee Green Tea, Indian Chai, and Roe Black Tea. Their almond jelly and grass jelly are made in-house, AND you can have the option between Straus Family Organic Milk, Almond Milk, or Organic Soy Milk. \n\nYep, totally worth the drive.", "author": "Cara O."}

I got the soy milk tea because I asked if the drink would be sweeter because it is made with soy milk (I like my tapioca on the sweeter side) the lady said yes so I settled. Mine was super watered down and it didn't have much flavor in general. Basically I spent $4 on brown water. I didn't think much of it because I have a somewhat picky palette but my friend on the other hand is easier to please and she did not like her Jasmine milk tea one bit.

I'll get them on my own terms--anytime, anywhere, any place. \n\nThis place is super hipster as it's in Mission and with the range of bubble tea places in SF, you'll probably see less Asians here. Thanks to my OCD on Tumblr, I only know of this place through the photos of their drinks on mason jars. Turns out those jars are $10. Came here with a few friends from the area who also wanted to check the place out. You'd definitely miss this place if you don't look for it because it is small. You know you're not in Chinatown anymore when you see the iPad station and the decor and design--from ceiling to floor--is hip.\n\nMenu is limited, to my surprise and a small costs $4, which is high for SF standard pricing and also high for New York bubble tea pricing, which $3 is a minimum. I got the Classic Milk Tea with Almond Jelly and to my surprise, the milk tea had a great balance of sweetness to it. I've never had almond jelly before so it was a first for me and I really liked it. Reminds me of solidified almond tofu. I'm glad I got to try this place while it's still new, though I really wanted to try their Lychee Green Tea. It's definitely a \"East Meets West\" experience and they're starting out small with some main Hong Kong food staples--it's a good experience for Americans who want to try that style.

Parking in this area is a bit tricky - street parking is almost always full! So this online option is also good if you're just making a quick stop since you'll know when your order is ready, and then you can just walk in to the counter (on the left) and then out again pretty much immediately.\n\nThere's a small seating area, bit the shop is quite small so I never really stick around.

I highly recommend that if you go to Boba Guys, order one of their premium milk teas, and order it with a lower sugar content level. Many milk tea places mask the poor quality of their actual teas with sweetening agents, and if you actually try their teas with low sweetness levels, it becomes alarmingly similar to just drinking milk and no tea. However, my Hojicha was very flavorful by itself, and it complemented nicely with the general sweetness of the boba toppings. \n\nThe Iced Matcha Latte drink is also highly recommended, while the Hong Kong style was good but not quite anything special.", "author": "Matthew L."}

I liked the flavor of the oolong with the almond milk and the boba had great chewiness and a slight sweetness, which is a great combo.

Hipster friendly boba made accessible to people who aren't used to it as a drink (or the texture of boba.) Maybe it's not the most authentic, but Boba Guys does boba up right, and they also happen to be the closest boba place to my house SOOOO I do come here often. (They also offer delivery on Postmates and Doordash if you're lazy or bedridden like me-- something y'all might wanna think about!)\n\nConsistently good because they are very accommodating to your tastes-- you can choose your choice of milk (regular, soy, almond, etc.) and sweetness (which is a new fad that I'm seeing as of now, but it's helpful for a diabetic like me!) Their boba is fairly sweet, so even if you get 0% sugar, if you get boba with it-- the drink is still bound to be somewhat sweet. I really appreciate their slow bar here because you know they're brewing you up some fresh tea :) If you order from the slow bar, it takes around 3-5 minutes for them to brew your tea and serve your drink. It goes by fast though, I promise. My favourites off the basic menu are the matcha and the hong kong (always down for condensed milk!) But if you want to be adventurous, I'm a huge fan of the Golden Honey Black (which has a hint of sweetness to it, even at low sweetness levels) and the Rose Black Tea (floral af, but soooo delicious.) The boba is always at perfect consistency-- chewy and warm, but like I said before-- I think they store their boba in a simple syrup mixture because it's super sweet and will add sweetness to your drink. \n\nIf you're down for snacks, the cotton candy from Sugar & Spun is sold here, and they have outrageous weird flavours-- my favourite being the Li Hing Pineapple. They also have other bites, and fresh honey toast (Hong Kong Toast) topped with condensed milk whipped cream. It's sweet and decadent, but definitely reminiscent of Japanese Honey Toast (though not as big.) Worth the money, get it! \n\nAll in all, Boba Guys is my go-to boba place because of their consistency and great quality drinks.

I am a HUGE boba fan and let me tell you... nothing can compare to this. I have yet to find a unique drink here in the SoCal area that can come close. But once I do best believe the judges panel is coming out haha. \n\nWe went to the Mission location and chilled at Dolores Park while enjoying this tasty drink. Parking is pretty scary since I'm not yet used to the narrow streets but I got it done in one try haha. Thankfully there wasn't a line at all cause it would've been torture waiting to try this strawberry matcha that I fell in love with over Instagram. It's so cute how the drink comes with separated colors. Of course, you have to mix it to get the full flavor. But oh my goodness it was so good.

Boy, I was glad I chose 75% because  for the first time in my boba-drinking life, I had to add water the dilute the drink because it was so painfully sweet. I feel bad for whoever orders the 100% \"default\" sweetness because that would be like drinking straight honey. Next time, if I do go back, I will order 50% sweetness. \n\nIMO, Purple Kow in the Richmond district still beats this.

They were part of a commercial the day we went, so the film crew had some miscellaneous supplies that were piled up by the wall. Service was also slower and the line was out the door, so the owner gave everyone 15% off their orders, which was unexpected but definitely appreciated. They also continued to apologize as we were in line, which was not necessary, but a gesture that shows the type of customer service they uphold.\n-Branding. I've seen their anteater while perusing Instagram and was already intrigued. It's so cute and such a simple but memorable and effective marketing tactic as a newcomer to the already-saturated boba market. \n\nGood, but not great:\n-Iced original milk tea with boba. I can tell that the quality of the tea leaves is not the best I've had (e.g., Ten Ren/Tastea). It's not that strong. As I continued to drink my 16 oz tea, it becomes a bit more diluted, more so than is expected with ice melting. \n-Same with boba...good, but not great. I can't pinpoint it exactly, but I think I would have preferred it to be more QQ and honey-infused. I am a boba fiend, or nitpicky amateur boba connoisseur at best. \n\nSkip:\n-Jasmine milk tea. Jasmine taste is somewhat strong, but it tastes more milky or watered down than anything else. Even my friend who got this drink preferred my original milk tea.\n\nOverall good and would come back again, 'cause why not, I love boba...but not the best I've ever had (Drake's words, not mine).", "author": "Phoebe C."}

I'm sorry--I don't want to admit that I'm not a fan of this place, but I've definitely had better.\n\nService and Space:\nYeah, it's cramped, but I've seen worse. The people who make the drinks are cheery enough, despite dealing with a large crowd that's been waiting for their sugar fix for way too long. However, when it comes down to the time it takes to make the drink itself... that's where Boba Guys loses. My friends and I waited for 10 to 20 minutes for basic brewed tea, even sans toppings.\n\nThe people who make your drinks aren't the friendliest, though, when it comes to modifying your drink, so you better hope that they make it the way you like it the first time, or risk getting some begrudging stares. \n\nDrinks and Food:\nAlthough the drinks are customizable, there is still a limit on how little sugar you can add to the drink. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Hong Kong, Thai Tea, and Horchata drinks still have immense amounts of sugar. The pearls are also hit or miss--some of them are extremely chewy, whereas others clump together. The jellies are a better option for those who want reliable taste and texture.\n\nInterestingly enough, what I like most about Boba Guys' offerings is not actually their drink menu, but rather actually the food. If you get a chance, try their Hokkaido Toast, which is a great complement to any milk tea you order. They don't go overboard with their condensed milk, and is just barely crunchy enough for you to enjoy.\n\nOverall? If you're going here, customize the premium milk teas, as those tend to be more consistent in quality. But at least you can take an IG picture with the large logo, because that seems to be more worth that wait.", "author": "Kat P."}

One of the things I loved about Boba Guys in the beginning was that they were so concerned with maintaining the quality of their drinks. You pay extra for the freshly made teas which were made in front of you before, but now they either do not steep them long enough or they are pre-made to keep the line moving. Either way, after you wait in such a long line, you expect quality that they just aren't giving anymore. The drinks aren't as good and it's definitely not worth the cost.

I don't even want to know how many calories are in one of these things, it would make me too sad.\n\nI usually get the classic milk tea with boba, 50% sweet.  Trust me, that's plenty sweet.  I honestly don't know how anyone could get 100% sweet, it makes my teeth hurt just thinking about it.  And I have a moderately strong sweet tooth...\n\nThe milk tea is perfect, it always scratches my bubble tea itch.\n\nI also tried the matcha latte once, that was great too, it had drizzled honey around the cup before the poured the tea in which was a nice touch.  It was also a layered drink which is just visually stunning.  They really take pride in their products here and it shows.\n\nSimilarly to ordering an espresso drink, it helps to know how to order.  You'll want to specify your drink, how sweet, with boba or not, and confirm if you want dairy milk (only in SF, right?).  The whole think goes much faster if you can prevent them from having to ask you a bunch of clarifying questions.", "author": "Rachel S."}

To be honest I had low expectations due to the hype and price, but was pleasantly surprised. \n\nI of course ordered the Classic Milk Tea with boba (75% sugar) and it was pretty darn good. I like my milk tea to have a detectable black tea taste and this definitely did. Lately I don't get boba balls in my drinks anymore, but always get it the first time at a new place and I didn't regret it. They were cooked well and were not too sweet or too bland. \n\nYes their drinks are quite pricey. Maybe I just don't mind paying more for better tasting food since the expense isn't something that would deter me from coming here. Almost all my favorite boba places that aren't in the city are around $3.50-$4.00ish so it's not a huge deal to me (though their portion size is probably bigger). \n\nThere was a line so we did have to wait about 15-20 minutes to order (which would be the only deterrent for me tbh) but the actual ordering to getting your drink is quick. The place is also TINY so it's nice not having to be squished in a corner for an extended period of time. (They do have like...3 or so seats but not worth it). \n\nThey do offer more unique drinks that I want to eventually try, such as the Horchata boba.

No matter how hard I try, for every place I knock off my list or bookmarks, another three pop up to fill the void.  It never ends!  Thankfully, now that they've both found permanent homes in the same restaurant space, my trip to Ken Ken Ramen also gave me the chance to check out Boba Guys.  Two birds with one stone?  Sweet. \n  \nAfter putting in our dinner order with the waitress, my old coworker walked over to the \"bar\" by the front door to put in our drink order with Boba Guys - two regular milk teas with tapioca/boba.  Served in these awesome mason jars, I thought the drinks were pretty good.  Maybe not quite as good as my usual favorite (Wonderful Foods in the Sunset), but certainly one of the better ones I've tried.  The boba had the right consistency/texture for me (firm yet chewy and not hard) and it wasn't overly sweet like how some places can get.  Similarly, the milk tea wasn't overly sweetened and had a nice balance between the tea and milk, and between the tea and boba.\n\nAt roughly $4 a pop, Boba Guys runs a little higher than what you can find elsewhere, but the drinks are good enough to justify the price.  Despite how much I like them though, the potential lack of parking in the area and the fact I have more convenient alternatives makes it tough for me to stop into Boba Guys again for my occasional tapioca fix unless I'm in the area.

No taro here. This place has more unique drinks that traditional boba places don't have like horchata. They emphasize their use of loose leaf teas (which is great) rather than the powdered drinks. So I tried to be a little creative. I tried to create an almond milk tea drink by ordering the classic milk tea and substituted their default milk with almond milk and added the almond jelly.

This review is for both the Mission St. Location and the Union Square Location.\n\nFirst off, let's discuss price.  These are definitely not the best prices in San Francisco for the size you get (about $4 for 16oz depending on what you order), but for the quality of tea that you get, yes this is worth it.  Many of their ingredients are homemade, high quality, and organic, and this shows in the taste of their drinks.  \n\nHere are some of my favorites here:\n\n*Classic Milk Tea:  The classic milk tea is set at a default sweetness of 100%.  I highly recommend that you get it at a sweetness of 50%, as the default sweetness is way too sugary and will drown out the tea taste.  The milk tea has a very good balance of creaminess and tea flavor, with an excellent sense of freshness to it.  For toppings, I recommend either their boba (scroll down for my review on this!), or grass jelly.\n\n*Strawberry Matcha Latte:  This intriguing drink gets a lot of stares for its strange colors, but it's delicious.  They use no syrups or artificial flavors, the matcha is organic, and they use their own housemade strawberry puree as sweetener.  The flavors go better together than expected, but the matcha tends to drown out the strawberry flavor if you mix the drink.  I recommend taking sips from the puree (at the bottom) and the actual latte (top) separately.\n\nLastly, the BOBA!!! The boba here is chewy and delicious.  It truly lives up to their sign outside, which says \"Grade A Balls.\"", "author": "Tim L."}

Real jasmine, rose, strawberry and lavender exemplify the best of its signature and seasonal blends.\nNervous first-time visitors might want to start with the Jasmine Milk Tea, its flavor a step above the basic, but no-less-tasty Classic Milk Tea.\nThe premium Indian Chai and Rose Black Tea stand apart as original and astonishingly rich blends.

Soy milk and Califia Almondmilk are perhaps better alternative options.\nA house-made simple syrup of white and brown sugars that sweetens all drinks overwhelms most tastes, but chatting with the \"bobaristas\" increases the customer's chances of getting the perfect level of sweetness.\nCustomizable high quality thirst-quenchers served with a smile from bobaristas for around $5 constitutes a steal by San Francisco standards.\nBoba Guys is located at 19th and Valencia streets and on Stockton Street in Union Square.

They accept credit card which makes it super convenient! I couldn't decide between getting the jasmine milk tea or the regular milk tea. I decided to go with the regular milk tea because it's the most popular drink to get. My boyfriend got the muscat oolong milk tea which is a slow brew tea which means they brew the tea leaves on the spot! The slow brew options are also more expensive, because each drink is $5.50 and the regular ones are only $4.00. \n\nI enjoyed their black milk tea with boba. I got mine at 75% sugar because I like my drinks not too sweet. The tea was good and it was balanced with the milk.

Located in the hipster area of Mission, this storefront is small. Since it is Mission, parking is a bit hard to find due to metered spots. I luckily got a prime parking by the front of the store..but only after circling a bit. \n\nSmall storefront with only a bar-countertop seating by the front window that has only about 3-4 seats, and a bench in front of the windows. They have a good selection of drinks ranging from your typical Green Milk Tea or Jasmine Milk Tea to Horchata Milk Tea, which I thought is quite a unique flavor to add to the menu since it is more of a Mexican drink. Sadly, I didn't order it for my first time. Aside from the menu on the wall, there is a 'special' menu on the side by the cash register on mini-clipboards. The staff was very nice and got our drinks done by the time we finished ordering (whaaa)!! \n\nI ordered a Strawberry Jasmine Tea-Fresco and my boyfriend (wow, he finally shows up again on my Yelp reviews..been MIA on my adventures..) got the Strawberry-Calpico Tea-Fresco(?). You get to choose your size (16 oz - 24 oz), toppings (tapioca, almond jelly, grass jelly), Milk (Straus Family Organic Milk, Almond Milk, Soy milk), and sweetness level (see chart on wall). \n\nStrawberry Jasmine Tea-Fresco is good. It's sweet and I feel like you can taste the flavors of the strawberry. My bf ordered the Strawberry-Calpico Tea-Fresco and was a bit disappointed because he felt that it didn't taste like Calpico. I got a sip of his drink and it tasted like my drink, mixed with yogurt - so I guess you can say strawberry yogurt..but in liquid form? Haha. \nI also ordered a Hong Kong Style Toast with condensed milk, which was 1 thick toast, sliced into 1/4th's, with whipped cream spread and honey or condensed milk drizzled over it. Was a bit of a disappointment for me, but slightly met my expectation.. \n\nOverall, I think I would come back if I was in the area. It's a bit of a drive since I am not in the area often, looking for parking is complicated, and the drinks remind me of T pumps - only difference is that they use organic products and loose-leaf tea instead of powder.

I was deciding between Jasmine Milk Tea, Duke of Earl Grey, and Rose Tea and since this was my first time here, I decided to go simple and get the Jasmine Milk Tea with boba.\n\nJASMINE MILK TEA W/ BOBA\nWas a hefty $4 and though it was good, it wasn't $4 good. You can taste both the jasmine and the milk tea without either flavor overwhelming the other. But the boba was... interesting. I have mixed feelings toward it. It hardened a bit so it wasn't fresh and if you're going to call yourself \"Boba Guys\", ya better have some good boba! It did have an interesting chew to it though, almost like the Hi-Chew candy.\n\nWith this drink alone, Boba Guys did not win me over. But I will be back at some point to try the Earl Grey and the Rose Tea, which are $5 - $5.50 for the \"slow-dripped\" tea. Slow-dripped boba drinks, hmm... We'll see how this goes.

I love Tapioca pearls and the milky teas I've had in the Avenues at other HK style tea shops. I hadn't visited Boba Guys before but it sounded delicious today and there was no line so my girlfriend and I went in to get a tea. We ordered a Thai iced tea and a matcha iced tea. One of the things that was confusing and hence the low rating is that Boba Guys charges extra for Boba! I have never experienced a Tapioca bubble tea place that upcharges for the Tapioca pearls. The tea itself was good and we ordered at 50% sweetness which was perfect. So five stars for taste subtract 3 stars for charging extra for what seems like the salient aspect of the tea which is the tapioca pearls. I can see charging extra for other additions but without the tapioca pearls, it really isn't bubble tea. I'm glad I'm not that into drinking sweet high-calorie drinks regularly and I won't be a regular customer knowing this.", "author": "claire k."}

The quality of their boba drinks is much better than average. They brew their tea using organic Five Mountains Tea, and add Straus organic milk and housemade syrup.\n\nThey don't have as many flavors but I like how the emphasis is on quality not quantity. The drinks come in one size (the usual size not the crazy huge size that has become popular) and are priced at $4 and up. Brewed to order drinks ($5) take a little more time. The price includes an add in (boba, housemade almond jelly, grass jelly, aloe vera) though coffee jelly costs extra.\n\n* Earl Grey milk tea ($5, includes choice of one add in. The pearls are cooked to perfection; soft, chewy, sweet and fresh. The tea was excellent too, smooth and not bitter. The drink had a nice creaminess. I asked for it less sweet...still found it a little sweeter than I'd prefer so I might ask for half as sweet next time. They didn't add much ice (yay) but the downside was that the drink could have been colder. Also they could be better organized. The person who ordered a slow bar drink after me got her drink before me.\n\nBoba Guys is open Friday - Sunday only for now. Later they'll add macarons and cupcakes.

I ordered the classic milk tea with tapioca. Some pluses: tapioca was cooked nicely, great texture -- not too hard, not too soft. So, major kudos for making perfect tapiocas. It's a hard task. I know, because I've tried and failed. Some deltas: the drink just wasn't cold enough.. I wish the tea was cooler. Also, the milk tea was too sweet for my liking. I prefer more tea flavor and less milk and sweetness. Thus, the combination of it being room temperature and overly sweet made it hard to finish my drink. I guess what makes this place different is that they use Straus Family Creamery organic milk and actual tea for their drinks. So, it's almost gourmet boba if you will.\n\nI am liking their overall look. It's different and original... cute anteater or aaardvark (which is it?) sipping boba, staff in white coats... like mad scientists trying to concoct the speciality drink in beakers. Well, the white coats and beakers part might be a bit too much for me. \n\nAnyway, it's their first day, so the wait for picking up the drinks took a while.. so maybe I' should cut them some slack.

Their drinks actually come out very sweet most of the time, but if you let the ice melt into the drink, it'll dilute it perfectly so that the drink has the right sweetness. \n\nMy personal favorite is the Hong Kong Style milk tea, a black milk tea in which they use condensed milk to sweeten the drink. I'm a big fan of that, and I'm glad they do that drink justice. \n\nIt's a bit pricier here for drinks, but I think of this place as a treat for myself whenever I feel like I've done a pat-in-the-back worthy task for the day. \n\nWould recommend to others.", "author": "Curtis Y."}

They're trying to do something different without breaking the bank.\n\nMy wife and I strolled in here after she read about Boba Guys on Yelp. The interior of this place is pretty tight. There was no AC, and since it was a little hot outside, it did get a little uncomfortable, especially since my wife ordered the slow brew coconut green tea. And unlike traditional boba shops, these guys aren't nearly as fast at cutting down the line.\n\nI guess my biggest complaint is how pretentious everything feels. Slow brew tea. C'mon, really? All tea is slow brew. You brew tea by steeping it in hot water. This is the way tea has been brewed for thousands of years. It's nothing new.\n\nAnd then there's this acrylic contraption that's supposed to look like a coffee siphon bar. But unlike a coffee siphon, you're not watching water steam in separate chambers, forcing hot water through a filter. Again, they're just steeping tea in hot water. It's silly. \n\nTo top it all off there's all this stuff on the menu boasting about the best quality ingredients from around the world. And as I'm reading this, I'm watching the hipster kids behind the counter use Kirkland cinnamon and vanilla. Don't get me wrong, I love Costco. But I don't consider Costco ingredients rare or exotic.\n\nAnyway, the tea was alright. I had the horchata boba. It had a good flavor without being too sweet. And since most boba shops have at least 30 different flavors, to find something fresh and unique is notable. My wife's green tea with coconut milk and almond jello was also a nice twist. I liked that.\n\nAnd for about $3.50 a pop, which is just about the same price you'd pay for this stuff on Clement Street or in Chinatown, it's not a bad deal. But it's not anything worth going out of your way for.", "author": "Tony L."}

And if you think Tea Pumps is good, you're not Asian enough or you're too Americanized to know what is \"good.\" (Americanized versions of Asian things are always bad if you've tried the Asian-original, whether it be movies or food) And Tea Pumps and Boba Guys are oviously the PF Changs of Chinese food. \"chinese\" food.\n\nFor a company that markets themselves as meticulous guys scientifically crafting the best milk tea recipes, I'd say these scientists missed the mark pretty hard. I think it was not so much meticulous crafting, but more just a few guys in a kitchen mixing stuff together without the slightest culinary skill or wit whatsover... like college dorm kids that don't know how to cook or mix flavors... because these are by far the worst ratios and recipes I've ever had, aside from Tea Pumps.  \n\nPolitical news needs to fact-check, BobaGuys needs to flavor-check.

Mixing flavors and devising combinations is wit and intuition, not calculation and process.\n\n-------------\nI came in with a large party and tried several flavors:\n\nJasmine milk tea: I often jude a milk tea shop by this standard. It's classic, simple, but takes understanding of milk tea to get it PROPERLY made. Well, these guys managed to screw this up. 3 of us ordered it just to be sure. And yes, they all came out identically disgusting.  -- too watery, yet milk to tea ratio... too much milk--so it tasted plain. 75% sweet. 100% sweet. Both pointless It's like adding more sugar to water. The tea was standard jasmine but more importantly, the ratios were all wrong. \n\nEarl Grey Milk tea: This is my staple order at any milk tea place that would serve it. I've tried it EVERYWHERE. You can say I'm a bit of a harlot for earl grey milk tea... I've been everywhere for it. Well, Boba Guys destroyed this drink. Good job. B for effort. \nIt was too watery; had a sharp hint of lychee; had a gross accent of lavender, which I now assume they used the BUTT of all teas--TAZO.. or they used the post 2012 Mighty Leaf version of Earl Grey... which is beyond butt.. and I distinctly remember that nightmare to this day, and I slightly relived it in this milk tea. And the tea to mlik to water ratio was obviously wrong. It just did NOT taste good.\n\nHorchatta Milk tea: not bad. not great. It was like a watery Horchatta with boba. Not so great. They're better off with the store-bought and just throwing boba in it. They don't know how to make horchatta properly.\n\nHong Kong Style: This was their best drink out of the lot. Surprisingly, for such a terrible milk tea place that Americanized the milk tea industry like Tea Pumps, which just means... detroying it.... they managed to get HONG KONG STYLE pretty good. I tried this one last in the lot... maybe anything par would seem good.\n\nI'm not a fan of Quickly's or TapEx, but there are a few with owners that really know how to make it.

But once you do order it only takes about 5 minutes. I got the iced matcha latte. Matcha was great and the tapioca balls were done to perfection. Only thing is I got it 100% sweetened which is the \"default\". I hope a normal person does not need that much sweetener in their life. Next time I'll definitely tone it down a little(a lot). Reason for the 4/5 is that although they do have some variety; they don't have as many choices as most boba places.

It sounds like these guys share the same passion for milk tea, so I really hate giving them a low rating. \n\nOn paper, it sounds like they know what they're doing. Strauss Creamery milk and organic tea would be the perfect recipe for a Mission hipster milk tea, but the result isn't up to par. I had the black milk tea, and the most glaring issue was the absence of any tea flavor. I didn't find it very creamy or that sweet either. I mean, it was just kind of...uhhh...blah. Good milk tea needs to be aromatic, full bodied, rich, and bold. That's only possible with a proper brew of tea.\n\nThese guys seem genuine, and I'm under the impression that they really care about their drinks. It could definitely improve though. They need to make their tea stronger. It could be as simple as steeping the leaves longer, but I can see it being more complicated as well. Since they're using regular milk, more has to be added to the tea in order to achieve the same creaminess as using evaporated or condensed milk. Adding more liquid dilutes the tea flavor. If that's the case, maybe they should tell Strauss to make some evaporated or condensed milk, or they could try using Strauss' whipping cream. I don't imagine brewing extremely super duper strong tea would work with regular milk either. Even if you aerate the tea, you'll start introducing a harsh bitterness if you steep it too long. I hope that helps. I'll probably try it again when they get their brick and mortar store open.", "author": "Nei N."}

Typically when you mix boba with alcohol, especially something as strong as vodka, it tends to overpower the milk tea and ends up tasting bland. To battle this, one might make the tea to alcohol ratio higher, or just add more sugar to the tea. I felt like none of this was done here, and the drink came out tasteless. It gave a good buzz, but after a few sips I was ready to go. It just felt like I was drinking watered down alcoholic milk. \n\nBoba Guys have been around for only 2 years.

I get into line and read the menu and a couple other reviews to see what i'm going to order. Everyone raves that this place is organic and it's delicious so i figured why not go with just the regular milk tea. I ordered a regular milk tea and a jasmine milk tea with pearls for my cousin. The guy then asked if i wanted to change anything with my drink and i told him no. We get our drinks and it did not meet my standards of milk tea.. AT ALL. It was bitter and not sweetened at all even though the menu says that all drinks are made with 100% sweetness unless told otherwise. I thought that my cup was bad my cousins cup of tea turned out even worst.. needless to say both my cousin and i were not satisfied with our milk teas and don't plan on coming back.\n\np.s: the plus side the pearls were the only thing that we enjoyed from boba guys.", "author": "Brenda H."}

Milk tea from tea leaves. Anyways, the drink is very refreshing, as it's not weighed down by overly sweet milk or cream. The peppermint milk tea is pretty good too. I'm not usually a fan of peppermint, but appreciated the light and airiness when I took a sip. \n\nThe boba has a pretty good consistency, not too hard or squishy and not overwhelmingly sweet! The handled mason jars they serve the drinks in are super adorable and their logo is precious!\n\nMy only problem is the price. For $4, you can easily get two milk teas in the Sunset.

Unfortunately, I've gone to my local Quicklys to also get a similar type of drink and it still didn't do it for me.

I've started to believe that boba uses over seeped tea that gives you a bitter tea kick, then they take the edge off with milk and a huge amount of sugar. \n\nBoba guys goes for a more subtle experience, and they brew the tea right in front of you. My experience, as the other reviews have noted, led to boba that didn't taste very strongly of anything.

In my opinion, Boba Guys has the highest quality boba in SF. I am definitely willing to pay a little more for boba made with honest and trustworthy ingredients.\n\nThe store right by 19th St & Valencia street where there are interesting thrift stores to check out and upscale and hip restaurants to try out. On a sunny day, you could grab some boba and make your way to Dolores park (a few blocks away)! Perfect.\n\nThe store is very small, there are only about 4 seats in the store. The staff is friendly and they really care about making sure your drink is made exactly to your liking - You can customize your drink (sweetness, more tea/less milk, almond or soy milk, etc)!\n\n\nTip: If you're taking BART to the 16th Street Mission stop, my suggestion is that you walk down Valencia St. instead of Mission St. to 19th St.  Mission St. is a bit sketchy, while Valencia St. is very nice. When you first walk out of the BART station, it maybe a little scary, but don't worry... just walk to Valencia St.!", "author": "Monica T."}

Surprised I made it all the way into the mission and back during a thought to be heavier lunch hour. Kudos for scoring street meter packing right out front.\n\nThe shop was empty, so service and boba turn around time was quite speedy for the only patron on site. I had the classic milk tea with boba, which was unexpectedly strong and delicious. It contained just the right balance between tea and milk, none of that artificial Quickly/Tap X shit here. Even after the ice had melted, there was still a distinct tea taste as opposed to it just being diluted. I didn't really finish my drink until early evening, which led to the result of my caffine induced insomnia for the night. \n\nI havn't had the chance to compare it to the pop up shop version over at Ken Ken Ramen, which many are saying are drastically better. This location didn't appear to have the alcoholic drink versions on the menu either. Maybe an update once I can sample the others?

The order came out fairly quickly, but I was a little disappointed with the result. \n\n1. I'm sorry, but I really really dislike the boba here. I found them to be too hard and they had a really odd sour taste.\n2. This may be biased because of point 1, but I think they put way too much boba in the cup.\n3. The milk tea flavour was off too. Slightly watery, and it just doesn't have that guilt-inducing delicious taste like the milk tea at HK cafes.

The entrance is quite small and only has enough room for a few bar seats near the window which was unforuntely taken by a bunch of yuppies while visited.\n\nAt 4 bucks for the average drink, this isn't a place that you can call cheap milk tea, but for a place that seems to still be getting it feet on the Mission/Valencia market, I can't really blame them. It's worth a shot!\n\nIf you've ever had milk tea from chain stores around San Francisco like Quickly or Teaway, this taste much different as they use real bitter tea and milk rather than powder. It's more like a cold version of a Hong Kong Style Milk Tea at Chinese cafes, but a bit more sweet. Not really my style and it sure caught me off guard. I can say that the tapioca pearls were really good. Wish they sold them by the bag!\n\nApparently, they're opening a milk tea lab at Union Square soon and even has a Kickstarter for it. Although I don't think my minimal contribution in terms of my 4 bucks will be even close to denting the amount they need, I'd like to give these guys a shout out because the concept of opening something like this sounds pretty unique.

I also tried the horchata milk tea. Boba was perfect - fresh, chewy and each ball had a smooth surface. The almond jelly could have had more almond flavor. The milk tea had good balance, and the horchata was also good but it could have been sweeter. Service was courteous enough and it wasn't busy at all during lunch time on the Saturday I dropped by. Boba Guys definitely uses quality ingredients and you can smell it when entering the store (smells like real brewed tea and sweet milk). The $4 price tag is a bit hefty when considering that you can get comparable boba drinks that are a bit cheaper and come in a larger cup. I like the idea of the slow bar and wouldn't mind coming back to try their macarons.", "author": "Maya S."}

The best you can ask for. \n\nThis is not the artificially-flavored unhealthy and disgusting kind of bubble tea that gives boba a bad rep.

Even the popular bubble tea places in SF asian land AKA inner sunset, joints such as TeaWay still use flavored powder in most of their products.\n\nTrust me, I know what I'm talking about. After all, I'm from Taiwan, where bubble tea was invented! \n\nMy favorite kind of mix for bubble on a cold winter day (like right now) is: hot tea from the slow bar (I tried rose tea) + milk + tapioca. No sugar. The tapioca is already coated with sugar and that's enough sweetness for me. \n\nThe first time I came here it was about to close and I got the jasmine milk tea w/ boba. The tapioca was very hard. I suspected it had something to do with the fact it was at the end of day and having cooked tapioca myself I knew that it could've just been a bad batch. So I came back and gave it a second try.

When we were there, there were less than a dozen people waiting, yet it took more than 25 minutes to get our teas.  They were out of boba (tapioca) and grass jelly, the only add-in they had was almond jelly (which wasn't bad.)\n\nThey carefully measure things using science-lab-style beakers.  Again, unnecessary and slooooow.  This is not rocket science (or any other kind of science, for that matter.)  The owners need to visit Taiwan, where bubble tea is a way of life, and see how to run an efficient operation that doesn't make people wait half an hour in their sweltering shop (which lacks even a modicum of ventilation.)\n\nI had the jasmine milk tea, which was okay, nothing special.  It was a hot day but my drink contained no ice, it probably melted during the ultra-slow preparation.  So it was getting warm before it was half gone.  It was drinkable, thus the two stars.\n\nI get that you're trying to be boba tea for hipsters or something, but the individual brewing and slow service does not make a better product, just a slower one.

Me and some friends came to the grand opening and there they were - lookin' fine as ever, rockin' those white lab coats, mixin' our drinks - the boba guys. They had their lab assistants on the side too. There was a strong distinct sweet smell that took a minute to get used to upon walking in. The space isn't all that big, but there's four seats by the windows to sit and chill with some homies. Compared to their previous location, they have a new selection of drinks lined up along with their slow bar and also various cupcakes and macarons! There's no additional charge for drink toppings!\n\nFor their first day, I was surprised that they ran out of Thai Iced Tea so quickly. We walked in less than two hours after they opened! I had the Classic Milk Tea and for some odd reason, my order took longer than usual. My friends all got their orders, but mine never came up. I eventually had to ask about my drink, which then came out after a couple of other orders placed after mine, but I cut them some slack and let it slide because they just launched.\n\nI'm sippin' my drank and hey, it was one hell of a concoction! Hands down, the milk tea was honestly by far the best I've had yet. Perfect balance, ice cold, and made with the finest organic ingredients - just the way it should be! The grass jelly was pretty good too, but I've definitely had better. However, I caught what I think was a tea leaf in my mouth at one point which wasn't too big of an issue to me, but still questionable.\n\nFor day one and counting, they did a decent job. The whole lab experiment chemistry set-up with the coats and beakers was cute and all. I wish I had my drink in one of those cool jars rather than their to-go cups. It just seems cooler that way! I wanted to take a picture with the dynamic duo, but they were mad scientists at work and didn't seem willing for a photo-op. $4 is definitely the most I've ever paid for boba, but it'll be worth it to treat yourself to a concocted boba love potion every now and then!", "author": "Peter L."}

Plentea can offer the same drink, in a reusable glass jar, for half the price (even if there's no mascot).\n\nCame here, just to try it out, and it's really a hipster thing, located in a hipster spot; don't get me wrong: I enjoy spending a lovely San Francisco afternoon in a hipster spot, but really, $4 - $5 is really the max I would pay for a tapioca drink (please do forgive my ranting).  Anyways, I asked them about their most popular drink; they mentioned the horchata drink so I leaned towards that.  The cashier offered a free sample and I went for it prior to making my final order.  Typically a horchata is creamy, but this one was refreshingly sweet.  I decided to order the horchata boba (no mason jar) and throw in almond jello. Another good thing, about The Boba Guys is that they allow any or all combination of toppings for no extra cost (perhaps hence the expensive prices?).  On top of that, they also allow customers to bring their own reusable container (ex: water bottles, coffee mugs, etc.), which is nice in case you're working nearby and only have time to make 1 stop here during your lunch break.\n\nAfter finishing my tapi (aka boba), I was left with a forgettable feeling; didn't seem memorable.  They say their boba is soft and chewy, which is 100% true, but I preferably like my tapioca balls less chewy. Sorry, I'm not ranting just to rant, but honestly I'd rather return to Plentea or other authentic and local tapioca shops where I can get my milk tea and regular tea for $2.50 -$4.", "author": "Jessica S."}

I think overall tho, it's not worth the hefty price tag. I understand though that they may be using the best of ingredients, so that's probably why it is so expensive. Plus, there's no other Boba place in the mission. \n\nI like that you have the option to use soy milk. and the boba is really fresh. So although i really enjoy the teas here, I probably won't frequent the place just because it's pretty expensive. I'd probably just stick to the other boba places in the sunset where the prices are half what it cost here. But if i was feeling fancy, or if i ever was in the mission then i'd check this place out again. Also, i think the process of making the drink can be improved, it's a little on the slow end. \n\nI like this place tho, they deserve the 4stars.", "author": "Margarita M."}

Since Boba Guys is near the Mission district, parking can be relatively difficult, but if the parking gods are with you, it is possible to find a spot so don't be discouraged! Immediately as we walked in, one of the owners greeted us with a huge smile and informed us that the only drinks that they had were the first four on the menu, which were: Classic Milk Tea, Jasmine Milk Tea, Soy Milk Tea (no dairy) and Horchata Boba. Their toppings consisted of tapioca balls, almond jelly, grass jelly, aloe vera, and coffee jelly, but I'm assuming that the default topping is boba, since they didn't ask us which topping we wanted. They also had 2 cupcakes in the display, and they seemed to run out of macarons and other goodies, which was understandable since it was near closing time. Oh and they have a  \"Slow Bar\" where you basically choose from a selection of their loose leaf teas and they'll make it for you, but you need to wait 5 minutes. I'm not sure how that works, but I'll probably be back to try that! They proudly use Straus organic milk and real tea.. yes, real milk and real tea! None of that powder stuff that most boba shops use, hence why the prices are expensive for a small cup ($4-$5.) It's all about quality, guys! My sister and I settled on the regular milk teas and paid $8.\n\nClassic Milk Tea - The tea to milk ratio was PERFECT! I was able to taste the strong tea flavor, while enjoying the creaminess from the Straus organic milk. The boba was chewy and there was plenty of it! For sugar fiends, this isn't the milk tea for you because it's not sweet at all! My only problem with the milk tea was that it wasn't cold! It was sort of like having a milk tea sitting out for an hour, hence the reason why Boba Guys gets 4 stars and not 5. \n\nWe waited less than 5 minutes for our milk tea, which was great considering the amount of people that were there. The shop was clean, bright, spacious, and was aesthetically pleasing! The employees (owners) were friendly and they seem really passionate about their products and look like they really enjoy serving their customers. Yes, it's definitely pricier than most boba shops, but quality is key! I'll be back!", "author": "Joyce E."}

When my sister told me about you guys, i was super excited.  I couldn't wait to try your boba and milk teas and i must say i have once again been disappointed.  However, you guys do have a lot of potential to make really good boba.  I can tell from what i was drinking!!! \n\nthe problems: \n1.  Not enough boba!!! come guys, boba is cheap.  I'm sure you will make a lot more people happy if you just added a little bit more boba in there.  \n\n2. it's too sweet!! many boba places will customize the sweetness level.  When i asked for half the sweetness, the response was oo everything is pre-made.  Yes that kinda turned me off.  I have no problem with your pre-made teas.  My problem is the fact that you can't make it less sweet because it is pre-made.   \n\n3.  have less random hours.  people might enjoy a cup of boba milk tea after dinner. you guys are located in a hub of restaurants why not have later hours.  \n\nWhy i think you guys have potential to make REALLY good boba milk tea:\n1. the boba balls are chewy but not too chewy.  It has a nice sweetness too it (hence you can make your tea less sweet!!!!!) \n\n2. the tea has really good flavor.  I got the milk tea and my sister got the jasmine milk tea.  When i tried the jasmine milk tea, my first response was WHOA!!!! that is jasmine.  Love the flavor and the smoothness of your teas.  Don't let that hide behind all the sweetness.  \n\n3.  No lines!!! I didn't have to wait at all.. but that's probably because i went at a good time.  \n\nhope you guys find this helpful and i look forward to trying your more boba less sweet milk tea next time.", "author": "JY L."}

Otherwise, it's really meh.\n\nSome examples:\n- their coffee milk tea has gone down in quality over the last 9 months or so. It used to be quite good, and now it's watered down or something.\n- back in their Suika pop up days, they did a really nice jasmine milk tea. They moved to their permanent location, and I went back hoping for the same quality jasmine milk tea. I sadly ended up throwing my drink away after a sip 2/3 times, and never got the jasmine milk tea again. It tasted water down and funky in a bad way.\n- occasionally their boba just tastes....off. Hard to describe, but there are days when it's A+ and other days when it tastes like burnt plastic or something.\n\nI currently like their strawberry jasmine tea fresca a lot. The drink itself has been fairly consistent (across both mission & union square locations), though I'm always wary of adding boba to it because it might ruin an otherwise good drink.\n\nIt's also impossible to get them to add no ice. They usually forget and I end up with an iced drink. The first few times I had them remake my drink, but now I'm kind of \"meh, typical boba guys mediocre service\" about it. I hate iced drinks cuz my teeth are a little cold sensitive and it also waters down the drink, but at least I don't immediately chuck away the drink like I do when the boba tastes funky.\n\nI'd probably give them 2.5 stars. The strawberry jasmine tea fresca really bumps up their favorability, but I can't forgive them for everything just because of it.", "author": "Chris M."}

Their bobas are also cooked well with the right amount of sweetness.\n\nWe tried their Soy Original and Jasmine Milk Tea.

The boba was soft which was to my liking.\n\nThe workers were really nice and that's why (along with the boba) I am giving this place at least a 2 star.

Their drinks aren't bad at all, they definitely taste like real tea, made with real effort, but I feel the tea-milk-syrup ratios are a little off. Maybe just my taste. The boba itself was awesome though, chewy, and just sweet enough to complement the drink.\n\nThe coffee milk tea is cool because they definitely use cold-brew coffee to mix with tea, but again, the ratios are off. I like cold brew coffee, but it tends to be more acidic, and their recipe doesn't balance out the sourness of the cold brew's acidity. It doesn't beat a milk tea with a shot of espresso. The golden honey black tea, one of their special, \"slow brewed\" to-order teas, just tasted like a milk tea with honey..good, but not worth $5. \n\nAgain, I love their style, commitment to using organic ingredients, and I can appreciate the hipster, \"third wave\" kind of approach to brewing milk teas, especially in the Mission. It just hasn't translated into great tasting tea that could stand out in an oversaturated boba market. I'll keep coming back to support the biz because I believe in the potential. And because I go into the Mission a lot. In the meantime I hope they're seeking and being receptive to feedback that could improve their recipes.", "author": "Peter N."}

My boyfriend came to Boba Guys on President's Day (a Monday), and we were enough to find prime time parking along the street right across the shop. When we arrived (around 230pm) there was a bit of a line. It took about 15 minutes to actually reach the inside, which was small and a bit cramped (like most boba places). The register had a display just the to the left of it which showed their signature mason jars and some treats they were selling (sugar spun cotton candy!). I decided to try out the iced matcha latte and my boyfriend tried the hong kong style. I loved both drinks. The boba balls were not too soft and chewy, the price was very typical in comparison to other boba places (that's if you don't purchase the mason jar), the service was on the longer side to most boba places i've been to, and finding parking can be tough.

The profit margin in the boba business is slim and people are used to either cheap pre-made/powdered mixed drinks, coffee creamer (instead of high quality milk - I'm pointing at you T-Pumps), and basic flavors. I appreciate their mission statement and intent for using the highest quality of everything (esp. when everyone is trying to cut costs everywhere and doesn't care that pesticides and hormones are 80% of the end product). The best thing about this place for me is that they have almond jelly, which I can't find in any other place in the bay area. My favorites in order are the Muscat Oolong, Horchata, and regular milk tea.

My friends and I joke that it's the most artisan our boba gets, and it's not that much more expensive than the boba shops closer to home.\n\nWhat I particularly love about this shop is that it doesn't have too many options. Most boba places have a gazillion options, and for indecisive people like me, I spend forever deciding what I want. Having fewer options makes me trust that their options were all carefully crafted/tested and are of high quality, which has been true so far! \n\nThey even brew your tea right when you order, so it's fresh! The teas have a beautiful flavor, particularly the muscat oolong (you can really taste the muscat). I also appreciate that they have so many different options for milk (including almond and soy milk), and that they use healthy, organic products :)\n\nMy favorite so far has been the horchata with boba, which always has a delicious amount of spice and flavor. I've also tried their thai iced tea, as well as their hong kong style, which were both a bit too sweet (although I could have asked them to tone it down). I would suggest sticking with their boba, which has a great consistency, and is quite sweet, mostly because I'm not the biggest fan of jellies.

We accidentally passed by it at first and as we were walking back up the street, we discovered the Mission Night Market and spent some time there before continuing our search for this place.. which we soon realized was right next door LOL.\n\nI judge milk tea on three factors: creaminess, sweetness, and tea flavor. Here, I got the soy milk tea. It had a good amount of creaminess and the tea flavor was subtle, but present. I really enjoyed my drink, but it would've been even better if it had been a little less sweet!

We've actually never been to this place beforehand, but we love boba and tea with a passion, so I thought it would be cool for us to check it out. This easily has to be the best boba I've ever tasted and am thoroughly surprised that it only has 3.5 stars on Yelp! \n\nI think it helps if people actually know the process behind the boba-making; coming from the after hours tasting, we actually got to talk to one of the founders and he personally walked us through the entire process and all the ingredients used. They brew their own tea (using only the finest of tea leaves), use Straus half & half or whole milk (no powders or creamers whatsoever), and their own secret recipe for the syrup. So for those complaining that it's too expensive, well, if you take all the premium ingredients & care/labor put into making the drink into consideration, you'll see that the price is actually pretty cheap for what you're getting. I also read a lot of reviews hating on Boba Guys because it's \"mostly condensed milk\" -- it's NOT condensed milk, because, as said, they ONLY use premium Straus milk for dairy. And if it's too sweet, you can actually ask them to put only half sweetness or less and double the strength of the tea.\n\nAnyways, if you are on HowAboutWe, you should check the after hours tasting out because you'll really learn so much more about these guys and appreciate their intense passion and craftsmanship for tea & boba. I don't know if I'll ever settle for anything less than Boba Guys from now on. ;)", "author": "Trisha D."}

Though I've been acquainted with a few entrepreneurs over the past couple of years, never before had I heard the words \"boba\" and \"startup\" used side by side (nor even with \"Fett\" sandwiched between). Many months down the road, their quintessentially Bay Area approach to milk tea has been unleashed upon the public, in the form of two simple products developed through exhaustively detailed testing: regular milk tea and soy milk tea with tapioca pearls in the Taiwanese mode.\n\nEven though I suck at boba (generally going for a fruit freeze and skipping the tapioca, in the tradition of many silly white people like me), I had to taste their results on opening day. Oh, surprise, by which I mean, not a surprise, the boba is great and the tea refreshing, especially on a beautiful San Francisco summer day. They've also teamed up with Ken Ken Ramen (genius combo) to hawk their bevs in the front of the house, and though it wasn't too crowded on day one, I'd bet the lines are going to get considerably longer.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-05", "description": "tl;dr \n\nOverrated boba for hipsters.\n\n---\n\nCred: I grew up in Taiwan and lived there for 18 years.\n\nWe dropped by here last night waiting for Ken Ken Ramen, and we had the pleasure of meeting one of the co-founders of the Boba Guys. As much as I commend him on his motivation and drive to innovate boba tea, his product honestly cannot compare to numerous, numerous boba places in San Francisco that are better and tastier.\n\nI've got a sense that the Boba Guys are trying to be \"different\" compared to your standard boba place, but I feel like they're almost trying too hard. If something ain't broke, there's no need to fix it. I appreciate your motivation to seek out more interesting tea leaves for your teas, but if that means I have to pay more ($4? you're almost NYC pricing!) for a slightly more interesting flavor, I rather pay less ($2 at Tea Way or $2.85 at Purple Kow) for a less \"exotic,\" but very solid milk tea.\n\nGranted, they're still in their trial-and-error period, but their current product is completely unremarkable and their business would not survive in the Inner Richmond or the Irving area.\n\nWe tried the regular and the soy milk - I expected more soy flavor in the soy milk one, but being a lover of soy I commend them on their integration of soy into boba. Then again, you can get soy at Starbucks, so they can't get too many points for that.\n\nTheir regular milk tea falls flat, as there is clearly not enough tea flavor (it's pretty bland) and not a lot of milk flavor either...it's just very meh. I don't know what kind of tea leaves you use for your mlik tea, but even if it's a fine tea leaf, I unfortunately was not able to taste it very much. The owner said that a stronger tea flavor was one of the strongest feedback they got for their upcoming improved boba, and I solidly agree on this change.\n\nThe standout is their boba balls - their boba balls easily places them into the top quartile of boba balls that I've had in the states - it's the right balance between chewy and too-chewy, and having made numerous batches of boba balls myself, I commend them on their balance. However, as the owner admits himself we came at a great time for the boba, and if we came a few hours later (~9 PM) the boba would have become soft and mushy, so if they can maintain their boba quality consistently, then it would definitely be a plus at this boba place. \n\nRecommendations:\n1. Check out Purple Kow on Balboa, and get their boba with any of their milk teas. If you want to see how to balance tea flavor, try their roasted oolong milk tea. \n2. More tea flavor is definitely great - especially see if you can find a tea flavor that's memorable because you'll need a tea that really distinguishes itself if you want to stand out in the SF boba market. In essence, you need a niche market like you're doing with the horchata, which is a step in the right direction. I'm not sure if you can directly compete with black and green (more \"standard\") milk teas (purely given what I've seen so far).\n3. Kudos on the organic milk, but many boba places make drinks with fresh milk too...so what's the biggie?\n\n2/5 stars for the product, +0.25 for the glass jugs (feels a bit kitschy though), +0.50 for the bar and the bartender (really cool to have boba at a bar counter!), +0.25 for the innovation to keep improving.\n\nI'm sure that the Boba Guys will go places if they keep up their innovation and their drive, but they'll have to really distinguish themselves somehow if they want to move out of the Mission. Right now, I honestly don't think they can cater to that many more people than hipsters who would shell out $4 (and $1 for the bartender?) for a mediocre milk tea.", "author": "Chris S."}

When it was my turn I felt the level of service was different, the owner took my order and that was it. No sample, no small talk, not even a thank you; just nothing. It would not have bothered me as much, except he was not like that with the people in front of me or behind me.\nI guess I'm not the type of patron he wants in his boba spot.\n\nThe actual Boba was highly forgettable as well, not worth the trek to the mission or the long line. I think it is mainly marketing since when it comes to flavor, their boba was not discernible from a boba you could get from Quickly.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back.", "author": "Piers Y."}

So I settled for Thai Tea with the grass jelly. While waiting to order, I couldn't help but notice all the food was sold out and how people actually sat there and worked. Like a coffee shop, except for milk tea. That was pretty cool.\n\nOn to the actual product - the Thai Tea was very sweet and it did taste good. As for the grass jelly, it screams out homemade.

For paying almost $5 for a cup, I expect the boba to be slightly sweet with texture that is soft yet firm and melts in your mouth when you bite into them. The boba was good. Better than most places. Most of them were soft, melting in my mouth, so sweet, when I bit into them. But a noticeable portion the boba were firmer and chewier than others and were not melt-in-your-mouth good.

If you see boxes of coffee mate piled up (ahem Tpumps), RUN! They are serving you crap.\n\nPluses: quality milk tea with quality ingredients. Soft and chewy boba, but my favorite is the classic black tea with almond jelly. \n\nMinuses: I think their jasmine milk tea is a little weak and can use more tea flavor. Their sweetness level is inconsistent and they seem to change it on a whim maybe based on a couple of reviews. First time I had it, it was overly sweet. The second time was perfect, but the last time was bland.  For guys in lab coats, you'd think they'd take a more scientific approach to making their drinks and make it more consistent. Their new permanent store has been opened for maybe a month or two now and it still kind of looks like they just moved in.

Three stars because it looks cute, has an interesting menu, and a pretty sweet location.  In terms of taste, it was all right.  Not quite what I was expecting, as I'm used to my tea coming from Sunset, the San Mateo area, Milpitas, and LA...so I have an idea of the kinds of boba that I personally enjoy.  The service was okay, which is saying a lot for a place that boasts what so many SF joints seem to love boasting about.  When I go to Asian tea places, I already expect bad service.  That's just how it is.  I figured this place would be a bit more welcoming, though they're damn quick with the main milk tea menu.\n\nI ordered what I usually get at milk tea places: honey milk tea.  This counted as a \"slow bar\" item, but I convinced myself it was worth the wait.  In the end, it was all right; I' just glad I had a group to chat with during my wait time for okay-ish tea.  I'm terribly picky about my boba, to the point where I won't usually order it until I've tried a friend's drink.  The texture I go for is a firmer boba, with just enough chewiness -- thus, I tend to think that most boba I get is too chewy.  You do not have to agree with me on this.  Now, texture-wise, the boba here was fine, but I didn't get much flavor from it.  I think I would have been better off just getting the tea on its own, but that seemed silly, as the place IS called \"Boba Guys\".  I'd try the tea by itself next time, but at $4 a pop, I'd rather head to a tea shop and get a pot of loose leaf with more flavors...if I'm just getting tea minus the portability.\n\nI believe that the Food Snob in everyone's group will probably enjoy this place, but if you're used to milk teas that you could afford from middle school onward, it might take some convincing.  I wouldn't come out here for this, but it's an experience that might shift some opinions if people are unwilling to try milk tea at a typical boba place.  If the words \"local\" and \"artisanal\" make your ears perk up, this place is for you.  I dunno, maybe I'm just not classy enough.

Sure it took a try or two to actually find out how to attain one of these miraculously amazing milk teas but the search was so worth it. \nSo here's the deal, they don't actually have their own store because they're only available in the ramen shop which isn't the greatest thing.. I have to admit, it's awfully confusing but just walk in the ramen shop and sit your butt down at the bar. After that, everything will be worth it and you'll forget about being confused. \nSo I got the regular milk tea and my friend got the jasmine milk tea.

I was really excited, since boba is delicious when done well, and these guys had sold me on their efforts to do it well. \n\nVerdict? Tea, tasty. Pearls, suck. \n\nAn informal survey among the officemate pool found that we were all in agreement. Our order included the three milk teas on their menu: original, soy, and jasmine.\n\nI ordered the jasmine milk tea with pearls. The tea was well prepared, creamy from the Straus milk they used, which was nice. The pearls were too gummy. Was this a result of the pearls sitting around for too long whilst being delivered? Doubtful, since I work 10 minutes via car from Boba Guys.\n\nAs one officemate put it: \"they could corner the market on hipsters and white people.\" As for me, I'll continue to go to Fantasia, Verde, or Ten Ren for a solid cup of bubble tea that doesn't cost four dollars (or five when it's delivered).

Me being kinda dumb did not realize that it was the whole rice cinnamon drink thing till I tasted it. Even then it took me a while to realize it. It was like a reallly watered down version of Horchata. Like if I wanted a good one I could have went a couple blocks down to some tacqeria instead of paying $4 ah. Well. The boba was slightly sweet and chewy so that was good but they give you so little so that sucked. The regular milk tea my friend got is more or less if you prefer more tea than milk.

When I got my drink (quite quickly actually) it was over 3/4 ice and the jellies were floating all around the drink (not on the bottom where the straw is). The first sip was great, but by the time I got to the jellies, all the drink was gone and the ice had diluted the flavor to taste like a watered down strawberry vitamin water. I was left with a pile of green jellies and no tea to drink it with. So, I essentially threw out half of the $4.5 I bought.
