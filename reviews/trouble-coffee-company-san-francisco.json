The servers are sassy which is pretty funny - we came in a group of ~8 people, and we all ordered toasts. A lot of us ordered the peanut butter, honey, and banana toast, and after we ordered, the server said \"uhh, you guys ordered the most time consuming toast to make, so y'all are going to have to wait for a while.\" It was pretty amusing. The toast was AMAZING though...I'll have to come back to try some of their other ones.\n\nThe interior is really tiny with a small counter (around 4 seats), but there's a large outdoor parklet area to sit and enjoy your coffee and toast. This is also right next to Outerlands so I'd imagine a bunch of people come here to order some coffee or a small bite while waiting in that ridiculous queue for brunch.", "author": "Theresa L."}

Coffee is overpriced and meh and customer service is just downright horrible. \n\nThe storefront itself is so small. They have a small counter with 4-ish stools for you to wait. Creamer and sugar is located outside of the store. There is 1 person working as a cashier, another as a barista and one other person making toast. \n\nThe menu is literally a 8x11 in sheet of paper on a clipboard hung to the right (basically out of sight). There's also not much to chose from. Beware that the machiato and cortado are only available for dine in only. Be prepared for a wait though. The barista and toast maker work at a very slow pace. \n\nCustomer service is by far the worst I have ever experienced. The cashier gave so much attitude and could not keep up with my order, I had to repeat it a couple times. He low-key scolded my friends and I for being on our phones in their \"no phone zone\", even though everyone else was on their phones too. I heard a customer ask what type of teas are available (reasonable question since there is no clear menu posted) to which the cashier replied: \"we have a sh*t ton of teas here\".\n\nAnother disappointment: I paid $4.75 for a basic, unflavored latte and it had the saddest latte art I've ever seen. The barista did not put any effort in it and did not look like some of the better work I've seen on other Yelp reviews. The toast is just okay, basically thick sliced bread covered in sugar, I could make it at home. \n\nBut I guess bad customer service goes with their whole \"thrash or die\" theme. Safe to say, I will not be back.", "author": "Yennhu N."}

Coffee is mediocre and the toast tasted like it was made from someone who was high- OH WAIT IT WAS!! WELCOME TO SAN FRANCISCO. The aesthetic was confusing. I felt like I was inside a 200 square foot size Hot Topic with a coffee machine. As stated in previous reviews, the customer service is shit. But I'm pretty sure that was the theme they were going for- delinquent/low self esteem dick heads who probably suffered from childhood trauma and want to take out their anger to the world.

Like ridiculously. But the main reason why I'd say this is one of my favorites, if not THE FAVORITE, is because it's not overly pretentious like some of the other hipster coffee shops.

There are 3 bar seats,but it's so crammed there, sitting inside is uncomfortable.\n\nOutside has a cute, hipster tree log decor that could be used for seating.\n\nI had a regular hot coffee which was goood.

I've also tried their cinnamon toast and it is seriously out of this world. Their bread is so thick yet so soft and buttery. I watched how they made it and it appears that they poke holes in the bread once it's done being toasted so when they apply the butter and cinnamon, it seeps into every crevice so you get a very rich and flavorful experience.

My sister used to live right off Irving so we were able to locate it pretty quickly. There was a line out the door when we drove by and we parked Just down the street. The line was still out the door when we arrived, but we learned it was more so because the place is so tiny there is not much room from the counter to the door. The wait to order was only about 5 minutes. We ordered a chai latte with almond milk, a coconut, cinnamon toast, and peanut butter honey toast. The coconut was served almost immediately. The wait time was almost 10 minutes for our toast. I had my kids with me and the baristas were impatient with me as I tried to collect my toast, which I thought was rude and completely unnecessary given that there were no customers waiting to order at that point. We were also told that they needed to close the shop because it was shift change and they needed to mop the floors. While I was not expecting to hang out inside, I was still waiting for my chai latte! They told me they would bring it out to me and quickly shooed us outside. I felt like the toast was kind of a letdown. My aunt told me that when she had the toast, the toppings were swirled into the bread, like the knife cut into the bread so that the toppings melted down into the toast. We were served a thick slice of bread, which tasted like Safeway French bread, and not \"artisanal\" bread as other Yelpers have described. The bread was not very toasted at all and was white on the bottom, which made it too flimsy to pick up and take bites, so we just tore pieces off to eat. Since the bread was not very well toasted, the butter didn't really melt into the bread and it was pretty dry with all the cinnamon sugar piled on top. I really liked the peanut butter and honey toast. The peanut butter was all natural and very creamy, and the honey was delicious! \n\nIt ended up taking 26 minutes for my chai latte to be ready! The chai tea is freshly brewed, which accounts for some of delay, but it's unreasonable to have to wait that long, especially since I was eating toast slathered with peanut butter! I also thought it was odd that they left the huge tea bag in the cup given that it had already been steeping for so long. The flavor was delicious, the chai was nice and spicy and not too sweet.\n\nWould I return? No.", "author": "Melanie E."}

You know, when you hit a certain milestone age, you just don't seem to matter, or be noticed anymore anywhere. But that's the beauty of it. I like being invisible, so that no one pays attention to you, so that YOU can observe. This is a good place to observe hipsters sporting facial hair here. Grab a seat outside, and count how many men are wearing a beard of some sort, 10 out of 10. It's infested with hipsters with facial hair, and robust looking young female companions, with one or two occasional joggers in their stretching positions while sipping a coffee.\n\nMy companion ordered us two lattes. They were served like European sized cappuccinos, smaller but as they ought to be. They make them with patterns that you now see in most boutique coffee shops. He gave me the heart shaped one and he kept the flower one. I swapped it hastily. \"Keep your heart. I like my flowers.\" I took a sip to mark my territory with my rouge lipsticks on the rim of the paper cup. Their espresso drinks is very very good. Their outdoor waiting area, reminds me so much of Omotesando Koffee in Omotesando district near the fashion district of Tokyo.

I knew you were trouble when I walked in...\n\nAfter visiting The Mill, I have unfortunately acquired a taste for expensive toast, which prompted me to check out Trouble. According to the NPR story, Trouble is purportedly the OG of SF's artisanal toast trend. (Though I can't help thinking, didn't thick toast originate in Asia?!)\n\nTrouble is a tiny space that gets crowded even on weekday mornings. They have one paper copy of the menu, no website, and little seating besides logs outside and minimal counter space inside, because anything more would be too mainstream. In fact, they apparently shun technology with a grumpy no-pictures rule; I took care to take my food pics in secret so as not to get chastised. I managed to get multiple pictures in multiple settings with multiple angles including cross-sections :)\n\nI got the PEANUT BUTTER HONEY LAVENDER TOAST ($4) because the cinnamon one sounded too sugary. The design of the honey drizzle compared to latte art, and the toast itself was scrumptious: the peanut butter went unexpectedly well with the honey, and the subtle hint of floral lavender added a nice overtone. However the quality definitely fell short in comparison to the in-house craft bread at The Mill, where you could really taste the freshness, the baking expertise, and the thought put into the creation of each bread. I also noticed that the bottom side of the toast was quite burnt. \n\nThe ICED COFFEE ($4) was not bad, and there was even soy milk at the bar. It came in a neat stamped cup branded with Trouble, but the portion size was very Troubling, approximately a Starbucks short. \n\nThere were a number of kinks: the cashier who handles (cash-only) payment also prepares the toast; instead of real napkins they only have paper towels (the coarse ones that you usually find in the bathroom for wiping hands); the milk and sugar shelf is so tiny that you run into Trouble trying to juggle toast while adding milk to your coffee.\n\nAfter reading some reviews about their hipster attitude, I braced myself for abrasive criticisms when I asked for a straw for my iced coffee. It turned out thoroughly amused when the barista made a clever pun and announced the request as \"the last straw\". \n\nI feel bad giving 2 stars despite their punniness, the originality of the store as a whole (including the notable Trouble etch-a-sketch decor), and the owner's NPR story which is indeed quite amazing. But at the end of the day everything still overpriced, especially with respect to The Mill where there's better (and non-burnt) toast, better coffee, a far more spacious and nicer interior, and I actually end up paying less. I guess irony is, after all, part of hipster culture :3", "author": "Edna C."}

There are never complaints from Yelpers about the toast or coffee, only about the staff members. What a shame. I didn't want to get in Trouble with the person who told me not to come here (because she said the baristas were snobby) but I was curious! This cafe is very close to where I live, so it wasn't too out of my way to check it out.\n\nOn my first time here, I just wanted a cup of black coffee. There was no menu posted, with the exception of six words on a slab of wood -- COFFEE, TOAST, YOKO, TEA, LATTE, COCONUT -- I can't remember the exact words. I wanted to know what a Yoko was, so I asked after ordering my coffee. The barista explained that it's a shot of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. She made it sound super rejuvenating, so I swore I would try that next time.\n\nI came here again on a Saturday morning. Their simple menu had transformed into a one-sheet page listing all the beverage and food options. How peculiar! This time, I did get the Yoko and felt somewhat more energetic, but it was probably a placebo effect. Either way, I've had a decent experience at Trouble Coffee both times. There's a few barstool seats to chill in while you're enjoying your drink or toast. Otherwise, you can hang out in the seating area outside, where everyone congregates to await their delicious toast.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-05", "description": "Okay, I admit it: I'm a nerd. So the only reason I found out about Trouble was through listening to NPR, specifically on an episode of This American Life (http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/520/no-place-like-home). Hearing the story of Giulietta really struck a chord with Jiwon M. (whom I practically forced the story on) and I, so we were determined to make the long, surprisingly sunny journey out to Outer Sunset. \n\nTo our surprise, there was no line that Friday morning, and to our disappointment Giulietta wasn't there, just two pretty apathetic dudes who seemed like they were equally disappointed with our sudden appearance. \"Coffee?\" the cashier prompted as we tried to take in the cramped, eclectic (and eccentric) surroundings. A creepy baby doll, a copy of Yoko Ono's Grapefruit... \n\nWe scrounged together the last of our cash (exactly $14) to purchase two Lattes and two Cinnamon Toasts. Because, Trouble doesn't need to go to the trouble of purchasing a card-reader when they're so popular. There were some interesting sounding pastries also on display, but unfortunately we felt we were on the last ropes of their hospitality as we waited at the narrow counter for our food. Jiwon attempted to take a picture to document this moment and how much it meant to us, but the cashier shot our dreams down with a curt \"No pictures.\" \n\nI'll admit, it's pretty amazing to see how simple the toast is to make but how delicious, crispy, and buttery it is when it gets into your mouth. It's also pretty amazing how tiny the coffees are in comparison. Their espresso is definitely on the citrusy, bitter side, but it's a good counter-balance to the sweetness of the toast. We enjoyed our coffee and carbs using the twisted tree trunk outside as a bench, and another more level tree limb as a table. On a good day like the one we were blessed with, this serene setting is perfect for a long talk while you people-watch surfers walking back from a morning dip at Ocean Beach. Fortunately grouchy barista didn't reprimand us for taking pictures outside, but we've gotten into enough Trouble for now to last us awhile. ;)", "author": "Helen S."}

I had to wait in line because of all the people that wanted coffee from this place. In my experience, long lines tend to make SOMEONE anxious/impatient. However, that \"someone\" should never been the person taking your order. This was my first time here so I felt puzzled to see that there were no menus to order from. When I asked the gentleman at the register, he appeared upset that I did not know how things worked around here. Good thing I already had an idea of what I wanted. \n\nFOOD: I ordered a coffee and toast, the two most commonly posted things on yelp. The coffee was earthy and bitter. Nothing exceptional about it. Although I will say that having the sugar and cream outside is a little off-putting,especially since this place is located on a slope. The toast was tasty but nothing to rave about. I really wanted to try the peanut butter and lavender honey toast but I guess they only serve a single type each time. Today was \"Cinnamon Toast\" which tasted exactly as described. One notable difference is the layer of butter on the toast. It makes the toast extra moist which is nice. Total was roughly $6, not a bad bargain.\n\nAMBIANCE: I cannot comment much here considering that my old dorm room was larger than this place. There are a few stools inside but this place is really not a sit-down sort of deal. They do, however,have lots of open seating right outside this cafe. \n\nOVERALL: This place gets 3 stars because all in all, I was not dissatisfied and definitely will try to revisit this place another time.", "author": "Greg Y."}

No one will want to take your order and when they do, they will be sure to not rush in its preparation, what with there being iphones to check, giant canisters of cinnamon to relocate repeatedly and other customers more interesting than you to chat earnestly with. \n\nOnce your order has been fulfilled (patience), you will be able to enjoy it (may I recommend a coffee and coconut combo with perhaps a slice of thick toast?) in the parklet out front. There are 3 bar seats inside but sit there only if you do not suffer from claustrophobia. The outside benches are roomier and have been assembled from scrap lumber, drift wood and succulents that seem to be held together by sheer force of will. They are reasonably clean and not that uncomfortable. They offer a view of parked cars and a store with fancy pencils.\n\nEnjoy the quirks and conversations of the denizens of the outer sunset who surround you.

But, if it's one thing that I won't stand for, it's being disrespected, no matter how good or delicious anything might be.  And to be clear, I'm writing this review days after my experience, so there's no knee jerk reactions going into this either.\n\nIn reading up on the delicious cinnamon toast that Trouble offers, I decided that on my day off that I'd head out across town (literally in my case, since I live in South Beach) to Trouble and stop in for some of their highly publicized toast. In walking into the shop, it's clearly a surfer/hipster place, which is all well and good; nothing I hadn't already seen in other places before.  In ordering my toast, the guy behind the counter seemed friendly enough.\n\nAs everyone's mentioned, this is a cash only and no coffee & menu board kind of place, so coming ready is essential.  Somehow in my excitement for my toast, I missed the teeny tiny sign on the door that says 'No Electronics' so when my toast arrived and started taking photos of it, I was immediately the butt of the barista/toastmaker's jokes to his buddy who was sitting at the counter.  Small jabs and ribs about how I was taking photos of my food seemed to cause a lot of amusement between the guy and his friend, and proceeded to make fun of me for some time.  Never mind a separate person that's sitting at the the counter reading his emails and watching Netflix on his phone; that obviously doesn't qualify for jokes, but taking food photos is.  I've been to a lot of places, had experiences of subpar service, but never have I been laughed at and disrespected by anyone at any of the places I've been to.  So, along with paying for cinnamon toast (which in all seriousness is something that I truly did enjoy), I apparently also paid to be someone's entertainment that morning. Call me a sourpuss, call me a rulebreaker for not paying attention to their small (and frankly, sort of silly) sign, but I don't pay places to make fun of me and my general enthusiasm for SF fare.

Coming from living in Santa Cruz for about 4 years, this coffee shop reminds me of those hipster-like, small joints that I would find in the downtown of Santa Cruz. Here, they have coconuts, coffee, and their famous cinnamon toast that a lot of people snack on with their beverage. My friends got a iced coffee and latte both with toast, and I just got the mocha. The drinks range from around $3-$4 and their cinnamon toast is $3. I tried a bit of the toast and it was really good! The way they make it is PERFECT; just enough toast with enough seasoning and BAM hits your mouth.\n\nWhat i don't like about this place is that there is NO MENU! How can you expect us to know what you offer and look at me like I'm clueless or something when this is my first time! They offer the usual cappuccino, mocha, latte like every other coffee shop does, but I'm all into specials and what drink they are known for so I was a little disappointed at that. Also there is barely any seating; everyone usually sits outside in their patio with a huge tree branch and all that.\n\nThey also put all iced drinks in a hot cup container. What's the downside of that? The cup gets super soggy.. not really a fan of that. And I love my iced drinks! I get how they are probably trying to reduce the use of plastic but.. in those times it is very convenient.\n\n3 stars for the food because it IS good.. maybe they can work on their service to be just a little more friendlier.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

Because now, now we have some good ole' toast. \n\nWhen I first heard of the new toast craze that had hit SF I I thought \"really?\" I mean I like toast, but how could people really be paying 3-5 bucks for something so normal? Enter Trouble Coffee and Coconut Club. I came across an article claiming this is one of the places (what I can best describe as charmingly odd) where the toast phenomena began. And honestly I was so intrigued the menu items and the owner's story behind the business that I had to check it out.\n\nThere's no menu on the wall but the owner strategically created an eccentric but simple menu based off the things that were important to her. Toast means comfort, coffee means speed and communication, and coconuts represent survival. Oh and shots of fresh squeezed grapefruit juice called \"yoko\" is another random menu item because the owner's theory is that a person can live off coconuts and vitamin C alone (hence the grapefruit).  \"Build Your Own Damn House\" is menu combination item consisting of a coffee, a coconut, and cinnamon toast. I skipped out on the coconut but my cappuccino was on point and honest to God I don't think I've ever had a better piece of toast in my life. Yea sure I could probably have made something similar at home but paired with my coffee and leisurely stroll to the nearby ocean on a foggy Saturday morning...it doesn't get much better.\n\nOh a few other things I noticed:they only have whole milk or soy, no decaf, and no espresso to go. And don't let the creepy plastic baby on the wall deter you. The whole place is decorated with random things yet it somehow just works. There's about 7-8 barstools inside but they also have some cool tree branch/trunk type of seating located just outside.\n\nOk so this isn't your typical review, but I just thought this place is so, just so unique.

It was about appreciating the moment, and since there is no wifi and no tables, you are kind of forced to interact with the people you are with and who are around you, and just appreciate the moment a bit more than you would at SBux or some shiz. And because there are tons of hipsters literally eating coconuts with metal spoons outside of this place, strangers are always striking up conversation because of it.

But...\n\nHmmm.  I'm a big girl.  I don't really need my baristas to kiss up to me or anything.  I'm there for my caffeine fix, that's all.  \n\nBut, admittedly, I also don't really need my baristas to dole out an attitude either.  We all have our days after all.  \n\nSo I went to Trouble, prepared for surliness.  But I didn't care.  I had been craving cinnamon toast for days (strangely enough); only to learn these guys do supposedly THE BEST cinnamon toast EVER.  Go figure.\n\nI went in.  There were 2 people standing ahead of me to order, so I sat down @ the counter in the interim.  No, not to be lazy.  I had been laid up all week nursing a really bad sprained ankle (it was now Saturday).  Yes, it was obviously a premature move, but I needed to get out of the apartment!  Anyway, I regretted my decision to venture out (especially without the ankle brace) as soon as I took a few steps after getting out of my car.  #lessonlearned\n\nSo, there I was.  After a few minutes, the barista guy notices me sitting there & says \"...you haven't been helped yet, have you?\"\n\nHe was actually...wait for it...\nPleasant.\n\nI said no, & that I only sat down without ordering because of my ankle, & he stopped me right there with a big smile & said \"no, no.  You're totally fine.  What would you like?\"\n\nHmmm.  NOT very surly.  At all.\n\nI ordered The Girlfriend & the cinnamon toast.\nThe Girlfriend is an earl grey tea based, lavender, honey, milk concoction.  Named such because, allegedly, like having a girlfriend, \"it's kinda expensive, a little complicated, but well worth it.\"  I'd like to personally reiterate the \"WELL\" in \"well worth it\" for all the ladies out there.  Indeed.\n\nNow, it's what happened next that really raised an eyebrow & left a lasting impression on me, for the best...\n\nSomehow I forgot to request soy milk.  That never happens.  I've been doing soy lattes (or almond) for well over a decade now.  But, remember, I am under duress with a sprained ankle.  So as another barista is literally making orders at the espresso machine, & since he had his back turned to me, I...\n\nI tapped him on the shoulder.  \n\nNo joke.  This is a no-no boys & girls.  Never tap a person on the shoulder, but instead say excuse me, right?  Only with all the froth noise I was afraid he wouldn't hear me in time...\n\nThe barista turned around.\n\nI said \"don't be mad at me!\"\n\nHe kinda laughed, smiled, & to my surprise did not look even the least bit perturbed.  At all.\n\nI explained that I had just ordered The Girlfriend, but I'd like soy or almond milk please.  He said they have soy, but not almond.  And he said so in a way that was polite & most certainly NOT surly.\n\nHe was actually totally pleasant, too.  \n\nHuh.\n\nI mean, really.  The tapping on the shoulder woulda kinda irked me.  I've done the barista thing before.\n\nI limped back to my car.\n\nThe cinnamon toast was OFF THE HOOK.  I scarfed down the entire thing right there, in my car, dripping butter & all.  Loved The Girlfriend.  The bergamot in the earl grey mixed with the lavender...it's wonderful.\nAnd the guys were actually princes.\nGo figure.\n5 stars Trouble.", "author": "Veronica M."}

Not too acidic -- just mild, good, and strong.\n* Any of their specialty toasts. They do NOT skimp on that sugar and butter. Mmm.\n* Their various pastries.

These baristas don't want to talk to you.

Good thing my friend warned me this could happen or else I would have been seriously confused/annoyed... although I was STILL annoyed, because they kicked everyone out, but we hadn't even gotten our food yet! \n\nWhen we got our toast it came on a thin sheet of parchment paper...

I asked the barista if I could see what drinks they offered, and I thought he was kidding when he said he'd make me anything I could think of. He ended up making me 'the girlfriend,' which was a lavender earl grey latte. So good! The flowery flavors were very dominant, which I loved. The bf got a regular drip coffee - pretty standard and appropriately strong.\n\nWe couldn't leave without trying the toast. We shared the buttered cinnamon and the peanut butter & honey. I loved the cinnamon and how the brown sugar crystalized on the top of the toast to provide a delicate crunch. The bf preferred the pb/honey one. It was really sticky and rich, but there was a nice balance of sweet and salty. The toast was the perfect compliment to our coffee.\n\nThis place is very small and it can only seat about 6-7 people inside at a time. There are a couple of benches outside though.

Everyone says it's a must if you're a coffee fanatic..which I am.  \n\nFor starters...this is a really small coffee shop.  However that's perfect, given where it's located.  It's just a few blocks from the beach.  You can grab a quick caffeine fix then head down to the sand on a hot day (which is rare in SF).  But that's not the best part, out front they have a really cool seating area where locals commune and catch up.  I've already met a few locals and their dogs.  Really great people.  \n\nThe pastries they have are awesome.  A lot of people say they are known for their toast...it's great and I get it often but it's just one type of toast and it's not the best thick slice toast I've had.   The cups they use are the traditional 8oz cups.  So don't be alarmed when you ask for a latte and don't get that giant size cup you would get from Starbucks..that's just not normal. \n\nThe reason I give this place 4 out of 5 is because everything adds up except one.  Occasionally the vibe the staff/baristas give off is often rude.  They yell, seem standoffish or just like they want you to get in, order, and get out.  This is not all the time and I know everyone has their days...but this has happened a few times.

It's one thing to be short or brusque when things are busy, it's another to be outright rude.

People working have no interest in helping you order, but rather just getting you out of there. If you've never been here before and don't have someone with you that knows what they are doing, good luck to you.\n\nSecondly, rude. When we did place our order, we were sitting inside waiting. There was a picture of a map on the wall so we were taking a look at it and pointing etc (typical interactions that a normal person would have when seeing a map). The guy at the counter says \"Don't touch the map, it's very old.\" I immediately apologized as I did not know (and there were no signs saying so either). I was met with the retort \"Keep your hands to yourself.\" Also, he called out an order to somebody saying \"Here's the cookie you ordered and walked away\" when he didn't tell them to wait while he got the cookie.\n\nUnless you like coffee with a side of douchey ass, don't come here.

Their coffee is a cut above everything else in the neighborhood and is also among my favorite in the city as a whole, so it fills that need to a T. \n\nI made the mistake of ordering toast a while ago, and I only refer to it as a mistake because now every time I walk by, I want a slice. It's incredible, it's delicious, and you get every cent worth of the cost. I haven't yet tried the peanut butter & honey toast, but the cinnamon sugar & butter one is one of my favorite treats in the world. \n\nMy friends who order espresso drinks there occasionally gripe about the wait or the cost, but once their drink is ready and they take a sip they always forget what they were so worked up about. \n\nWith regards to the service, people need to remember, this is in a stretch of the Outer Sunset where everyone knows everyone and it is a true neighborhood. Respect that the employees here are part of that community and sometimes talk to people they know, some of whom sometimes just come in to hang out. If your coffee takes an extra minute or so, so be it, it's worth the wait. If you can't spare an extra minute out of your morning, you probably shouldn't have stopped for coffee there anyways, just go across the street to 7-11 and get coffee there, because you clearly don't understand what Trouble is all about. They do things there better than other places, and it's because they take the time to do them right. \n\nI for one hope they never change a thing, because they have been doing everything right as far as I'm concerned, and I'll continue to support as often as I can.", "author": "Bill B."}

I'd like to change one of them to a latte if it's not too late.'  To which the dude responds -- drum roll, please -- 'Why the f*ck are you talking to me?  Don't talk to me.'\n\nThe other dude, who worked the register, looked at me and politely smiled, 'You can ask me if you need anything'.\n\nUhhhhh?\n\nThe toast and the latte were pretty decent, but not worth the price or the attitude.

In the morning we went out foraging for coffee, and I love to support the small local places when I'm in an area. \n\nWe see this place, and it's just cool looking. Driftwood counters, found art, scribbled-on etch-a-sketch. Just overall a neat vibe, and just begging for some pics.

Of course there was nothing posted anywhere about not taking pictures, so it felt like a trap to me. \"look, here's a really great photo op, loook at all the pretty thiiiings... come closer... cloooooserrrrr... NO! NO PICTURES FOR YOU!\" \n\nI give two stars rather than just one because the cappuccino was decent, if overpriced, and the barista tried to be friendly about it afterwards, and I asked why the policy existed because it didn't make sense to me. He said they didn't want pictures of their place and their faces plastered over the internet. Because... publicity is bad? I get not wanting your personal face up, but I wasn't anywhere near taking pictures of anyone's faces, really I wanted some abstract shots of the wood grain on the bar and this interesting painted stain up on the ceiling, He kept saying \"it's not personal\" but really, they embarrassed me pretty badly. I have social anxiety issues and I'm an extremely polite person and if there had been signs posted I wouldn't have been taking photos in the first place.  \n\nThe kicker is that when we got home I did a google search and the internet is ALREADY slathered with pictures of the inside of the place, from inside the place, including many shots of baristas in action, and my photos were all abstract and you wouldn't have even known where they were taken. \n\nI know my little review won't mean much to them, they seem to have quite a following with the locals and I'm sure they will continue to do fine, but I feel like maybe any photogs checking yelp reviews on the place before going should be forewarned about this policy so they can avoid the embarrassment that I was subjected to.", "author": "Binary G."}

Okay, no problem, I see not using your phone in a small cramped place when you are trying to order, its just rude. Ordering was fine, except the fact they had Wu-Tang playing, with all the \"f\" this and \"f\" that, and the staff were singing along. Okay, I live in the Mission, I get being edgy and not giving an \"f\" but you are working, trying to run a business, not everyone wants to hear foul mouth coming from employees. Overlooked that for the time being. Realized that the place had a Valencia street vibe, but a strange arrogance of Santa Cruz, like, \"We are too cool to be here, this is our rules, and \"f\" you\" Like they are doing us a service for being in business. Again, overlooked this, cause this is San Francisco after all. A man was asked not to take photos in the store, and to \"enjoy being here\" - again, as if being there, you set the rules. But, I digress, its too small to take photos, and no one wants to enjoy their food and drink with a camera in their face. \nI went back inside to ask about the coconuts and was told they sold them, and I asked \"It's just coconut, nothing in it?\" And the reply was \"Nope, nothing in it just a coconut\" Okay, cool, no problem, I saw spoons and rarely eat coconut, but I love the water in them, so call me a newb, but I just wondered what the deal with them was. What happened next is the reason you are getting two stars and why I likely wont return. As I was leaving, the cashier joked, with coworkers, \"What? There is drugs in the coconut?\" Which was not only snide, but rather uncalled for. I asked a simple, honest question, I did not need to be mocked or made fun of or have attitude thrown openly about it. I too work in a restaurant, customer service and was once a barista, so I know the silly questions asked from people, and it's totally okay to laugh and joke, just not where people can here it. You aren't working for that. You are working to serve, and to push a great product, with that comes a great attitude and loyalty.

I of course took the call (not in the habit of ignoring old women).  The cashier told me no calls inside.  I nodded and waited for him to hand me my change so I could finish my conversation outside.  Instead, he held my money and refused to give me my change.  As I couldn't leave without my money and couldn't hang up on my Aunt, I was perplexed.  He rudely said, \"No calls inside. Now you're not getting your toast.\" as if attempting to discipline me.  I am a paying customer.  He would not have taken this approach had I been an older man rather than a young woman.

It's a pretty small place, but there is also a bench outside to hang out at. I decided to order the regular cinnamon sugar toast (recommended by the guy working) and my bf ordered the peanut butter honey toast because he is obsessed with peanut butter. If you're a first timer, definitely order the cinnamon sugar! Its sooo good, but then again, it is kind of hard to go wrong with toast covered in butter and sugar... I love their bread though. It's so soft on the inside and crunchy on the edges, and it's loaded with butter and cinnamon sugar. The pb toast was just okay - it was too rich and sweet for me. Also, be careful when eating the pb honey toast! It can get messy - I somehow got some honey all over my jacket when I tried it.\n\nFor my drink, I ordered \"The Girlfriend\" which is basically an earl grey lavender latte. So yummy. All lavender lovers should order this. My bf wasn't in the mood for caffeine so he ordered a coconut drink. It's really interesting how they have coconuts here.

They were definitely friendly to their regulars which is great to see, but they were also friendly to us newbies.\n\nNot sure what the negative fuss is about, but maybe because we knew what we wanted to order from reading about the place first, we did not take pictures or take out our phones at all, did not ask for special coffee requests, etc.  They have their shtick and we try to respect that.  If you are going to complain about $4 toast, then don't buy it.  If you must take pictures of everything you eat, go somewhere else.  If you need a menu, this is not the place for you.\n\nMy latte was delicious.   I got the peanut butter and honey toast and loved that.  The one piece was definitely hearty enough to be a meal.

And the little knotted bag had real chamomile flowers in it, not that dusty stuff.  \n\nNow: the toast.  I watched him make it.  The bread is insanely thick (like more than an inch thick) and he slathered the crap out of it with butter, then sprinkled an extremely generous coating of cinnamon sugar on top.  Yikes.  I was expecting it to be a major sugar overload.  But I have to say, even though the toast \"trend\" seems pretty dumb on the surface, that was one perfectly executed slice of cinnamon toast.  All elements were perfectly balanced.  Crispy warm and chewy bread, salted butter, and cinnamon sugar, all join hands in the most beautiful toast harmony one can imagine.

I love how neighborhood-y and visually interesting that little block of Judah has become, despite the oppressive hipster vibe. I kind of like the hipster vibe in fact, even though that is not how I \"read,\" certainly.\n\nSo, my friend and I go into Trouble and speak to the lovely, adorable guy at the cash register who recommends their cappuccino (\"the foam is like marshmallow\"); I admire the atmosphere, and the cute wooden counter and am tempted by the cinnamon French toast and am already planning a trip back with my 2 kids who would love that place. My friend and I decide to go with the recommended cappuccino. The order gets forgotten - but no, that's not so troubling to me - that kind of thing happens and it is easily and politely rectified. However, I AM troubled by the fact that one of the guys behind the register (not the adorable one who helped us originally) leans over to my friend who is benignly leaning over the counter waiting for her cap (which, remember, the order of which had been forgotten) and says in a very rude and somewhat aggressive tone, \"This is our register. Can you move?!\"\n\nDude?! WTF? Seriously? It seemed not only very poor judgement and awful customer service, but also very hard to imagine him being so rude to either 1) a man; 2) a hipster of any gender; or 3) a young, beautiful woman. Now my friend IS a beautiful woman, but she is not 25.

So maybe that's a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how hung over you are. \n\nPrices are decent, $2.50 for an espresso.\n\nSo yeah, the espresso. I forgot who's beans they use, it was someone I wasn't familiar with, but they're good. Above average, actually. They've got decent machines, so they pull nice shots. Thick and creamy. Personally, I feel their shots are a TINY bit too hot. I think if they tuned it down ever so slightly they would get a better tasting shot. The presentation I'm a big fan of. They serve their espresso on these cool ceramic cups on rectangular plates and the presentation just works, especially with the vibe of the area.\n\nThat being said, it's the best in the Outer Sunset area.

What do you expect? I know it's silly, but if I wanted a smile and a red carpet rolled out for me, I'd go to Starbucks. Instead I want delicious coffee, tea, and toast, and I'm willing to accept that a hipster will be taking my money (God knows it will be in cash and cash only) in order for that to happen. \n\nHonestly, I've never received the bad treatment some people talk about here. The first time I went in, I was nervous because I was wearing Lululemon and looked out of place. To make it worse, my friend and I were indecisive about what we wanted and unsure if we had cash on us... \n\nWere we shunned or scoffed at? Did they tell us we didn't have enough tattoos to be served there? Did they summon a fixed-gear pedicab to take us away? Not even close. Our server was so sweet and adorable and walked me through all of their tea options. He waited while we decided on toast or a muffin, and he gave us everything with a smile (SHOCKER).\n\nAnother thing that's great is that they really look out for the community. Fun anecdote: my brother is a lifeguard at Ocean Beach, and they give him free coffee all the time. \n\nThis place may seem like any other pretentious hipster coffee shop, and maybe it is, but at least they have a sense of humor about themselves (look at their website) and deliver a good product.

I had asked the guy taking my order if the toast would still taste okay if I took it to go.  His response in a sarcastic way was \"you can take your toast wherever you want.\"  Also I had requested bags for my toast and instead of helping me bag it up he handed me 2 bags.

We came to get a pre-brunch snack and coffee while waiting for a table at Outerlands and wish that we walked a few more blocks to Andytown. Trouble Coffee is a tiny hole in the wall with cramped space inside but ample outside seating. It's pretty much the epitome of what one might deem as a 'hipster coffee shop' in the city. Being completely honest, the coffee wasn't bad and the toast, while simple to make, was phenomenal. That said, I wish the barista wasn't incredibly rude to my girlfriend when she asked if they had nonfat milk (I'd say a typical request, rather than something more rare and picky like almond milk). I also wish that  it wasn't cash only and so popular such that we had to wait 15 minutes analyzing why the barista was so pissy before we got our coffee and toast. \n\nIn short, the coffee here isn't worth the inconvenience of keeping ample cash (who knows the repercussions we would've gotten if we asked if they took credit card), dealing with an angry barista, and waiting long.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-11", "description": "Came to this coffee shop because 7x7 said that the cinnamon toast here is one of the top 100 things to eat in SF this year. We decided to come and get the toast and some coffee. You walk into the small coffee shop and it's funky and there is a sign that says no electronics. I think that is odd until I see one of the employees yell at someone for having a phone out. That seemed a little unreasonable and a little totalitarian. \n\nSo eventually we walk up to the counter and they don't have any menus to let you know what drinks they make. So we ordered a latte and an iced mocha. My girlfriend said \"can I get an iced mocha?\" The employee responded \"NO!\" We thought he was joking but he was dead serious. He also seemed a bit annoyed that we would ask for such a ridiculous drink. How do you expect people to avoid ordering it if you don't have a menu? We also ordered the toast and asked for it to be cut in half because we saw the pieces were pretty big. Once again, \"NO!\" was the response we got. We just paid and waited outside for our stuff. \n\nI went up to the counter to grab the coffee and all we needed was the toast and we sat outside on the hipster driftwood seats. Eventually the toast came and I went to pick it up and the guy said pretentiously \"Uhh, you didn't order any toast.\" I'm pretty sure I remember ordering toast and also paying for it. Eventually he realized his mistake and apologized but the sheer arrogance and attitude of the people who work there is unsettling. These aren't the nice, inviting hipsters of Andytown, these are the \"we are better than you and we know it\" hipsters. I've seen other reviews and many people have complained about the treatment and service they have received but people still show up! We control your life with coffee and hipsterness so you have no choice but to deal with our shit and you will like it! The coffee was good but not amazing and the toast was also tasty, however I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again just because of the hassle I would have to go through just to get it. If you live in the sunset and are used to being treated poorly I can see why you don't' mind coming here but I'm not going all the way out there to be treated that way just for a cup of coffee, there are plenty of other good shops in the city.

There is also no signs on the walls or at counter regarding their menu.  The cashier rushes us to order even after we told them it was our first time, they were completely unhelpful and rushed us though the order even though they had just made us wait over 20mins standing outside in the rain.  They are nothing but rude assh*oles with nonexistent customer service or common manners.

My first time was last Saturday  when I was waiting to get brunch with my family at outerlands up the street. It was a long wait so I decided to go to trouble and grab a drink to temporarily satisfy my hunger. There was a long line and a crowd of people outside which are both good signs that the place must be good. When it was finally my turn to order, I couldn't find a drink menu anywhere! I ask the guy at the register what's good and he recommended the \"girlfriend\" which was an earl grey tea latte with lavender honey. It sounded good and I didn't know what else to order and I also didn't want to just try a regular coffee it being my first time. So after a long wait, I sip my drink and it was...okay. Just okay nothing special bout it. It tasted like earl grey tea with milk that I make at home. It wasn't terrible but there wasn't anything spectacular about it and I sure wouldn't be paying $6 for a damn tea drink that I could make myself. I wanted to save my appetite for outerlands so I skip the cinnamon toast. \n\nMy second visit was on a Friday morning. No crowd and not too busy. I order a regular coffee this time and their signature cinnamon toast. Coffee was alright. Toast was good! It wasn't overly sweet and it had a nice fluffiness to it in the middle! Pretty good, I'd come back if I'm ever craving it. I wish this place had a large visible drink menu and what ever pastries and toast they have available.

We love trying out new breakfast places and have gone to many in San Francisco loving all of them. As we approached \"Trouble\" the line was out the door and people were huddling along the side walk, precariously balancing food and coffee on their knees. We soon saw that was because the venue was about the size of a small bedroom and no one could fit inside. \n\nWhen we finally get to the front there is no menu to be found, apparently you are just supposed to know what they offer, and my sister asks for two large cafe au laits. The barista grabs two small. When she asked if we could actually have the larger size he responds \"they only come in this size.\" Okay..

He then proceeds to yell to people to take their coffee and food outside because they are exceeding fire code. As we pay he says \"thank you for your cooperation\" in a way as if he were stooping to do business with us.\n\nWe are given our barely lukewarm coffee without lids and instructed that sugar is outside, which turns out to be a jar of brown sugar with a communal spoon in it, sitting  on a kitchen stool. \n\nI was absolutely astounded at the experience.

Sorry if the staff has a sense of humor and you get your feelings hurt, but thank you so much for yelping it so I can have a laugh.  \n\nAll I know is that instead of waiting for the caffeine to course through my veins, my high starts when I round the corner, waive at the owners of the corner store, and see people enjoying the parklet outside Trouble.  \n\nNo disrespect to Java Beach, but if you don't want someone to hand you an empty cup and make you pump your coffee out of carafe like you are at a business luncheon in 1978, come hang out at Trouble.", "author": "Briggs B."}

I am usually not a big coffee drinker and with typical coffee I drink it for the caffeine mainly and I find myself adding a ton of sugar even with \"nicer\" coffees. \n\nThis is the main reason why I was so impressed with the coffee at Troubled coffee. The flavor was complex, light with a subtle sweet/aromatic note and the texture was smooth and you could definitely taste that the coffee beans were lightly roasted. I was very impressed with their coffee and would highly recommend it to anyone. \n\nAnd as a bonus the coffee shop is very eclectic and the staff is pretty cool too, in a grungy kind of way.

It was because the guy who did my tattoo kindof ignored me and there were all these people around who were talking to each other and not to me.  Similarly, this place has a vibe that's more clique than friendly, enough to make me wonder, am I really here?  Yes, I am, and the coffee was good, and the toast was damn good, and the coconut... lemme back up a sec.\n\nOkay my mom lost something like 50 pounds because she decided to stop eating bread.  That was ten-or-so years ago.  You would never know it if you'd only seen her at Trouble.  But what the hell is vacation for if you can't stuff your face with delicious sugary buttery brioche bread?  We had latte and toast every morning here for the whole trip and I honestly think the whole vacation was made with that decision.  Well, that and the place we sublet right down the street.  But I'm getting off the subject.\n\nI checked Yelp before we came here just out of curiosity, and learned about this whole Build Your Own Damn House thing.  I wasn't sure I wanted to order it because it has a DIY vibe and I wasn't sure how I was supposed to Open My Own Damn Coconut.  I needn't have worried, as I saw a couple other customers consuming their coconut with all the machete work done for them.  So I gave it a try and I'm glad I did.\n\nMy point is, the food was all tasty, the coffee delicious, and the bikeshorts lady was hilarious when she screamed TOAST for order-up.

It had a great crunch, topped with cinnamon sugar and some syrup/butter that might have been a bit too sweet for me...but I love the thickness, texture, and taste of the toast! Their other pastries looked really good too. \nBoth times I went, the friends that accompanied me both had the chai and said it was too spicy. Another friend really liked their mocha.\n\nPeople: \nThe first time I came, a lady was at the counter, and it seemed like she didn't want to be bothered. I couldn't elicit a smile from her. It might also be because it was Outerlands Sunday brunch hour so yeah...I'm trying to be understanding. \nBut yesterday, there was a guy at the cashier and he was really friendly and chill.

When I found only brown sugar and raw sugar on the table, I inquired about where I might find the artificial sweeteners.\n\nThe response I received from the female barista was, \"We don't subscribe to that.\"\n\nHuh?!\n\nTo what do you actually not subscribe?!\n\nDiabetics experiencing the joy of sweetness without slipping into a coma?\n\nHow about better oral health? Is that on your watch list, too?\n\nIs it the concept of enjoying a beverage while consuming fewer calories that keeps you awake at night?\n\nOr is your issue with the general presence of facts - like the fact that decades of (independent) medical research have failed to yield a connection between artificial sweeteners and health problems?\n\nHoly moly, people. My local coffee shop has become a campaign office. Their target? Big Sweetener.\n\nThis is the eleventh plague.\n\nTo be fair, I can appreciate that groundbreaking ideas are often initially met with disbelief, and that the proprietors of the Trouble Coffee Company are entitled to run their business however they damned well please.\n\nHowever, there is one critical problem with the dogma being preached at the Trouble Coffee Company: it is not available to you until after you have paid, and only when you arrive at the fixings bar, just in time to hear the din of Satan's laughter. This means that a beverage that is purchased by a customer who uses artificial sweetener as their primary sweetening method is a beverage that is rendered useless.\n\nIt is arrogant to expect that customers would plan for the contingency of there not being artificial sweetener prior to their ordering. I don't care at which music festival your parents conceived you, there is a globally accepted standard that any hot beverage fixings bar will include artificial sweetener of some sort, and that deviations on the theme would include only the esoteric, not the canon. For instance, you might not expect to find Stevia, but you can always expect to come face to face with a packet of Splenda, Equal, or Sweet 'N Low.\n\nTo the proprietors of the Trouble Coffee Company:\n\nIf you want to take on the seemingly bulletproof artificial sweetener machine, replete with its backdoor-deal lobbyists and midnight baby-stealing, don't bankroll your coup on the backs of unsuspecting customers who would otherwise prefer to redirect their funds to higher-impact pursuits, like buying paint and watching it dry.\n\nWon't you please do the right thing, and hang a simple sign that simply states that you are simply uncomfortable with artificial sweeteners?\n\nEven in your utopia, where waterfalls of organic aardvark milk infused with old-vine hemp stalks unfold in the sky, as if to climb to Heaven, where every last naked pedestrian greets one another with a wink and a smile, and where people pay one another in smiles, consumers will still have preferences and the instinct to choose based on them.\n\nAs such, I'll be taking my business to a place that offers less trouble.\n\nAnd more sucralose.", "author": "D B."}

It's very similar to Subrosa in Oakland, except that they have the Holy Grail of cinnamon toast (which is not on the menu). \n\nThe coffee is really, really good. It might even be better than Philz, IMO. I've tried their lattes iced and hot, as well as their mocha and a sip of the Gibraltar (really intense espresso). I took off a star because of one of the space cadet baristas is usually rude and prone to screwing up multiple orders at once without apologizing. It's also pretty overpriced for the portion size, but I suppose you're paying for the imported Mission ambience as well. Another slight downside is the lack of sugar substitutes and indoor seating.\n\nTip: GET THE TOAST. IT'S PERFECT.", "author": "Rachel F."}

He started chatting up the barista and got served right away.  She came back outside to wait because there were way too many people inside.... \n\nAfter a few more minutes I went in by myself to order and stood at the counter at least 2 minutes while the barista chatted to her friend who was sitting at the side bar, completely ignoring me, despite standing in front of her holding money.  Completely unprofessional... when she took my order she did not say hi but rather \"what do you want\"... and charged me $4.00 for hot chocolate.  I dropped $1 into her tip jar thinking she would be nicer but it only got worse, and she did not say thank you or smile once.  Just after I paid, another \"regular\" named Harry came in and she immediately lit up and started chatting with him, saying that she had his drink ready.  Instead of making my hot chocolate which I had just paid for, she then made Harry's drink first, and then continued talking to her friend about her unborn child and whether or not she would keep it.  ...REALLY?! ...at work?

Across the park, of course, there's Simple Pleasures, which also roasts their own. If you can't be bothered to roast the beans, how serious about coffee can you really be?", "author": "Michelle P."}

The Italian and Greek immigrant population there has created a coffee culture there that is amazing.It shows in the range, style and quality of espresso and coffee experiences there. In addition, more than one billion cups of coffee are consumed in caf\u00e9s, restaurants and other outlets each year.  An increase of 65% over the last 10 years. \nMy drink of choice while living there was a \"Fat White\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_white\n\nI have not lived down unda in 4 years and everyday I'm drinking half assed lattes here in the city I'm miss my drink more and more.\n\nAlong comes Trouble Coffee. Being in my neighborhood, I wandered in there last week to grab a quick latte before work. \nAfter standing there watching them prepare my drink for a length of time that would make a high powered executive's head explode, I knew something good was coming. When your latte is ready is about 34 seconds, it is never going to be good. This took a while.  I was happy to wait. What came over the beautiful oak countertop was by far, hands down, THE BEST LATTE I've had in SF. I've lived here since 93 so...I've tried my fair share. \n\nThis is almost spot on similar to the flat whites of OZ I enjoyed daily. \n\nThis alone is enough to bring me  back there. But if that was not enough, the 3 different staff I've talked to there have all been consistently friendly, funny, quirky and positive. Its nice to leave a place feeling good and smiling. I beg you you to tell me that's what you get from the Starbucks at Safeway. \n\nThe 3rd thing I like is that Trouble Coffee is really a completely different experience than Java Beach which is just a few blocks down. I also enjoy going to Java Beach for different reasons. I'm happy that I have 2 places in my hood that I can support and enjoy. I don't see how they compete.

True, you can make your own cinnamon toast at home. But Trouble toasts are huge, thick, soft pieces of bread slathered with butter and dusted with cinnamon sugar. So yes, I could bake my own bread and cut thick slices. But do I feel like doing that every morning, or every couple of days for that matter? No. Trouble has won my $2.\n\nNow let's get to the hot chocolate. I don't drink much coffee, which is a little strange for someone who works in a coffee shop, I know, but Trouble's hot chocolate is awesomely rich and deep without being too sweet (but still sweet enough to share with my daughter). I love it... It's so good that you don't need whipped cream. \n\nAt the end of my visit, my order comes to $5. Totally worth it, to me at least.

As soon as I found out who that was I couldn't believe it. It's no wonder why the staff thinks they can be just as horrible. I get the feeling that they only want to serve one kind of people (      ) are they bigots? I also don't even like to go by there anymore but when I do it's to go to 7/11 and as I drive by I give those nasties a dirty look from my car. Hoping they remember when: \n1.The day they didn't want to serve me\n2. Made me 15 minutes late for work when all I wanted was a cup\n3. The time I actually was sitting at the bar eating - they couldn't wait for me to get out.\n4.

I am a big believer in supporting small locally owned shops.  I love good coffee. But I give up. Trouble Coffee Company just doesn't get it!   A \"third wave\" cafe cafe should, at barest minimum, serve good coffee.  I'm not talking the fru-fru milk drinks, just basic coffee, espresso etc.  I can only assume that the highly favorable reviews were drinkers of  milk/coffee drinks. The brewed coffee is weak and flavorless. The espresso was weak and over extracted with the barest minimum crema.  I am not asking for high-end specialty coffee beans, just good preparation of the beans that they do serve.\n\nA neighborhood coffee cafe should be relaxed and welcoming. Not with a snippy  \"I could care less\" attitude.  There are typically two staff. One order taker/cashier/attitude purveyor. Two, a clearly overworked barista trying to keep up with the orders, but consistently failing.\n\nI really want to love this place. It is really close to one of my favorite brunch/breakfast joints.  But I need real coffee and this little place gives every impression that it serves such. It just fails to do so.\n\nBTW, nice latte art was observed during this morning's visit, but  I can get that at Outlander, without the attitude. The breakfast breads always look delectable!!\n\nI hope Trouble Coffee makes it.  Maybe there are enough milk/coffee drinkers to sustain the business. But it would be nice for them to serve a decent cup of coffee.", "author": "Geary L."}

The company can be great, depending on the day and some of the most interesting people in the Sunset (all kinds of people of all kinds of ages and backgrounds) show up if you hang around a little.\n\nTo address the critique: \n\nWhether you like Trouble depends on your priorities.  They're not cheap -- there's a 7-11 right across the street if you were looking for cheap, or you can go to Java Beach for the midpoint. They're not always fast, and sometimes the staff gets a little chatty with regulars -- it's not McDonald's.  If cheap and fast are important to you, you're not going to be rating Trouble highly, and that's okay.\n\nAlso, all you people fretting about how the hipsters are rude to you? I'm a 40-ish mom, and the staff are okay to me.  Most of the morning regulars are even more middle aged than I and not particularly hipstery.  Occasionally one does see the lone Ocean Beach hipster.

They've cobbled together a cute place and they play good music, which along with the good food and drink makes this place just peachy in my view.\n\nA lot of reviews mention ill treatment from the staff.  I did notice a definite clique vibe when I first went.  Not too-cool-hipster lameness (I just moved from Brooklyn so I'm an expert on that bs), just neighborhood joint giving love to the regulars and friends style cliquishness.  The one barista is pretty cold, but most are friendly and attentive.  I notice that almost all the negative reviews are from neighborhood folks who seem to be angry at being excluded from the group, out-of-towners almost universally love the place.  Also, people complain a lot about the small espresso drinks.  A full shot or two is going in each one, so I think the smaller sizes reflect how Trouble thinks you should make a top notch coffee, not stinginess since adding a few ounces more of water costs them virtually nothing.\n\nI like the place and will keep going back.

Our 7 year old immediately gravitated to the army guy within reach and promptly showed it to me while my eight year old asked me to find out house on the map with pins.  I made the mistake of moving a pin back to where our house is and found that the guy at the register (maybe 5 ft away) was yelling at us like we were vandalizing the property.  Note, none of these items within easy reach had signs asking people not to touch.  I think he tried to soften the moment when we were checking out by saying the owner was very picky about these things.  Fair enough, being anal about details is likely what has made this shop great in so many other areas.  That said, I still found the experience very upsetting rather than relaxing.

The owner made them herself and they were damn impressive. I will go back.\n\nHowever, I'm really sensitive to \"the balance\" when it comes to customers getting what they're willing to pay good money for. And being treated respectfully, every time, when they're spending hard earned money at your place. It's a balance. An exchange. There should be good will in that every single time. I loathe the odd slogan that the customer is always right. No. Sometimes customers have had their expectations set by others with backwards customer service models, sub-par products or services and/or frankly, they just might have no taste. This is where you can be polite, respectful and help by suggesting they remain open to something new, that they should trust you - that they'll likely love the results. That respect can help customers to overlook many small inconveniences, without issue. This is where Trouble can both hold their ground, to the integrity of what they're doing, and make customer happy. \n\nA customer should never, ever be made to feel bad while they're coming into a place to spend their money. Not by employees or the other customers. It's not that difficult to make people feel good.", "author": "S S."}

It's a couple blocks from my house, and my go-to place on freezing mornings when I have to wait longer than 5 minutes for the N-Judah. To be fair, I've only had their coffee, I have yet to try any of their espresso drinks. I was curious about this place after seeing swarms of hipsters hanging out outside (surprised how many of them have been popping up in the sunset lately, btw) but avoided it until I was able to spot it crowd-free (early weekday mornings before work). I've had better coffee, so I'm confused about the crowds. The first time, my coffee was just ok, did the trick, but not the best. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and came back, again a mediocre cup of coffee. After maybe 5 or 6 mediocre large cups of watered down coffee, I think I'm over it and have seriously contemplated walking across the street to 7-11 to grab a coffee instead (decided against it, thankfully). I'd still come back to try a latte, since it looks like people do like this place, but if that disappoints as well, I'm not coming back.", "author": "Irina S."}

Maybe a few tables, but there just isn't enough room.\n\nEdit: I'm going to say this place only deserves 3.5 stars instead of 4. And that's cause $3.50 for a small latte/cappucino is ridiculous.

Having Trouble as my local coffee shop is very seriously one of the best parts of living in the sunset. The food choices are unique and coconuts plus toast is an amazing idea. Their coffee is strong and masterfully prepared staff are very good at what they do (masters of alchemy really) and having read the previous yelp reviews I felt inclined to stick up for them. Since when did it become a requirement for a barista to have to be extra nice to everyone? The staff at Trouble are GREAT at making espresso drinks, they are there for that reason and will have intelligent, sincere conversations with anyone willing to meet them half way. So don't go there if you need to be coddled, go there for good food and coffee with a strong sense of character.", "author": "dead b."}

This place is hella rad, don't let the very small and intimate size of the shop scare you away. This is no few-blocks-from the-beach tourist ripoff factory. These guys take their coffee seriously. They don't have an ultraextensive list of traditional drinks, although you can get a latte, mocha, etc. Instead they have a bunch of original drinks that you really can't get elsewhere except perhaps by giving the baristas a lesson on what it is. My favorite is the dirty chai. I repeat, dirty chai. Dirty chai. Get one. Go now. By combining sweet and spicy chai, milk, espresso, and I think a tasted some cinnamon, it makes for a really bold drink. All their drinks are STRONG so if you aren't into that, you're going to have a hard time finding anything you like on the menu. Staff are great and extremely friendly. There are only a few of them so its easy to remember them and have them remember you. Customer base is equally friendly. This is really a hidden jewel in the Sunset. Starbucks out.

Who wouldn't be intrigued by a coffee shop with such a name? Outside, early a.m., a trio of very not dangerous regulars chatted and drank their brew from mugs brought from home. Conveniently for them, the sugars and stirrers were on a stand beside the bench their tushes warmed. Inside, the beach shack-themed store consisted of a few stools at a narrow bar and a few window stools at a narrow piece of beach wood. The display case under the cash register contained, uhm, coconuts. The friendly coffee guy explained that coconuts, toast, and coffee were the shop's specialty breakfast and provided lots of nutrients, hydration, and a full feeling to take one through to lunch. Well, if I actually liked coconut, he would have sold me. Instead, I had a coffee and watched a number of characters (and their cutie dogs) wander in and then out with cappuccinos, lattes, and some sage surfer advice.", "author": "Poet D."}
