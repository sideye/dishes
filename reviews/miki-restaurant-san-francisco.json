I highly recommend this place if you want a solid bowl of ramen! \n\nUPDATE:\n\nI really loved this place! I would come all the way from Excelsior to eat their ramen, but tonight might be my last time. \n\nWe got seated at around 7:50pm or so and we ordered right away. It took 30-40 minutes for our food to come and all we got were 2 ramens and a roll. People who were seated after us got their bento boxes within 10-15 minutes. What gives! I knew that this place typically had slow service but tonight was extra slow for some reason. The restaurant was only half full, too... I was absolutely hangry! \n\nOnly saving grace was our server.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-13", "description": "Have you ever been excited about a restaurant because it had an item on the menu you couldn't find elsewhere, only to find that it DIDN'T HAVE WHAT YOU WANTED...but you enjoyed your experience anyway because the food was good?! Excuse me for my run-on sentence, but that was my experience with San Francisco's Miki Restaurant! Recently, I stopped by Miki  with my girlfriend after noticing (through Yelp) that this place had Zaru Soba Noodles (a.k.a cold soba noodles with a hot broth on the side). But NOPE, they didn't serve it (or any type of soba noodles at that)! However, we still ended up satisfied because the ramen here was not all that bad for the price and the service was great .\n\nMiki Restaurant is located on Balboa Street in the Outer Richmond neighborhood. The really nice perks about this spot are that 1. Outer Richmond is all residential and so traffic will be  GOOD and street parking is going to be EASY if you choose to drive; and 2. Public transportation should be a cinch since a number of rails go that way (e.g. the 31 runs right through Balboa Street). If you decide to come, I HIGHLY recommend coming early and with a small party because this place is TINY. To put it into perspective, the restaurant's size is around the same as a dorm room; in fact, I was surprised there's a bathroom for customers inside the kitchen. Intimate, but maybe too close? Luckily though, we were seated immediately when we came around 7pm on a Saturday. \n\nContrary to what I thought, Miki Restaurant serves primarily two types of food: sushi (both rolls and sashimi) as well as ramen. For their sushi, they have a few specialty rolls (like 4-5) and a some generic rolls such as spicy tuna and salmon (like around 8-9) different types. In addition, they have around 13 or so nigiri options (two pieces each). In regards to pricing, it's like $7 for their specialty rolls, $3.5 for 3 pieces of their basic rolls ($7 for double portion), and like $5-$6 for nigiri. If you want to mix it up, they also have combination plates too.\n\nIf you are interested in ramen, Miki has a separate one-page menu. Basically, they have tonkatsu, chicken, and vegetarian broths. For the meat broths, you can choose whether you want a miso, shio (salt), or shoyu (soy sauce) base. Unfortunately vegetarian broth = miso. Pricing isn't too bad, as it's around $11-$13 depending on what base you want + what extra ingredients you want to add. We ended up getting one garlic shoyu ramen, one shio ramen, as well as three-piece orders for salmon and tuna avocado rolls. Here's what we thought:\n\n-Garlic Shoyu Ramen (7/10): If you are a big garlic enthusiast like me, this ramen broth is FIRE. Like, have you ever had a ramen bowl with WHOLE GARLIC CLOVES? Miki doesn't hold back! I thought the soy sauce broth was really tasty and the noodles were cooked great. I didn't really care for the pork, as it tasted dry and didn't have that fatty/juicy consistency I've come to expect. $12.5 wasn't that \"bad\" of a price, but unfortunately the portion size could have been a bit better. For example, every bowl only comes with two SMALL pieces of pork. AND, you get HALF an egg?! But, if you are looking for a ramen fix, this bowl isn't a bad option as a whole.\n\n-Shio Ramen (7/10): My girlfriend echoed the same sentiments I had about her Shio Ramen. Overall, she thought the broth was cooked well; though this is a salt base ramen, the broth wasn't overwhelmingly salty, as can be the case with many ramen shops. The noodles were done well, although she too did not care for the pork. And that half egg though! Did they like cut one in half and serve both pieces to each of us?  For $11, this isn't bad but again the portion size is a bit on the smaller end. \n\n-Salmon/Tuna Avocado Rolls (5/10): If you think that a ramen bowl isn't enough to sustain your hunger and you are considering getting sushi here, THINK AGAIN! Though the sushi rolls are pretty cheap, they taste very mediocre. There's really nothing special about the sushi that they serve, although in their defense we ordered the basic rolls. Both the salmon and tuna avocado rolls were very plain and a bit too dry; this may just be me, but I actually felt a bit sick after eating them...I recommend not getting sushi here and just stick with their ramen. \n\n-Service (8/10): The service at Miki restaurant is really good, but not extraordinary. I'm glad that the employees here are SUPER RESPONSIVE. Like, I remember spilling water and they brought out napkins fairly quickly. \n\nAll in all, I thought Miki Restaurant was a solid choice for dinner, but it didn't blow me away. The portion size for ramen was average, but at least the broth was good + pricing was fine. The service was also decent too. Though I was disappointed Miki didn't have soba noodles, the ramen made up for it. For that, I give this place a \"nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating. Just make sure you steer away from the sushi.\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

It was a Friday night and most of the seats were still open, so we picked one by the window. The ambient was okay. I thought that it would feel more cozy given the size but it didnt. Once I sat down and got a menu, it smelled like pee so i thought it was maybe coming from the outside? But turned out it was coming from the menus.

The other reviews said that the service is slow but it was fine for us. \n\nFor the food! The Tonkotsu broth didn't taste super rich but it was good nonetheless... The noodles were not so impressive. The texture is pretty hard/rough and it didn't really mash well with the broth. The extra spicy was a good value add. I also added pork belly which was AMAZING!!!! Though overall the food just wasn't the greatest.

The place is indeed really small, maybe 8 tables, half of them only seating for 2 people. There was 3 of us so we took one of the two 4 people tables there.\n\nAppetizers: we got the tako and chicken karaage. Both were delicious but my favorite was the octopus. Deep fried tiny tako served with a garlic mayo. Two thumbs up.\n\nRamen: I chose to try the chicken broth instead of the tonkotsu that I usually go for. I had it with garlic miso and added pork belly and extra green onions. Each ramen comes with chasu pork, half a soft boiled egg and green onions. The broth was so so good, I was pleasantly surprised! It was perfectly umami and salty but without an overwhelming fatty taste. Just so yum. I tried my friends' spicy tonkotsu and shoyu tonkotsu and I honestly liked my broth better (they were good but not as tasty as the chicken broth). The egg was a tad bit too cooked for a soft boiled egg but otherwise was good. The chasu pork and the pork belly both paired well with the ramen. The ramen noodles were also good, the right amount of chewy and not overcooked.\n\nWe left there with happy tummies. The place was packed by the time we left and it was a random week day too.

I hadn't been in a while and noticed that the interior had been redone, more modern hipsterish. The menu was a little different, too, with some 'yoshoku' (Western inspired) dishes such as natto omelette (natto, the stinky soy beans that most people outside of Japan cannot stand, but some Japanese love!) and mentaiko (spicy cod roe) omelette)--psyche! saiko!! Anyway, I had a feeling that staff and ownership may have changed when I heard both customer and waitstaff discuss the 'tonkatsu ramen'. It is not 'tonkatsu', but 'tonkotsu'. The former is a breaded pork cutlet. The latter is a rich pork broth. We ordered a shio (salt) ramen with a tonkotsu base. Something was off with the broth from the start. It was a bit salty and lacked a certain depth. We also tried the salmon teriyaki teishoku which came with 2 pieces of California maki and white rice (!!). The California maki used real crab meat, which is a plus, but we are not big fans of 'American rolls'.  The salmon teriyaki came with 'teriyaki sauce', which is more 'American style teriyaki', than Japanese. Chicken karaage (Japanese style chicken nuggets) came with the order, but was a bit too oily and soggy. Also accompanying the teishoku meal was miso shiru, but it was too salty and inedible. I left feeling rather disappointed, but the restaurant was packed an a line waiting outside, so perhaps this place is to the taste of others, just not me. That said, the service was fine. The server was friendly and efficient. Nice interior, albeit on the small side (but that is not a negative).", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

We were the first table there.  I ordered the Pork Bone Miso Ramen, my daughter a tempura Udon and my husband a bento box combo comprised of Chicken Karaage and tempura.  \n\nThe ramen was fantastic! The pork broth was full of flavor. The noodles were just the right texture.  The bamboo shoots were fresh and soft.  Chasiu (only 2 pieces though) was tasty and tender.  I drank 1/2 of the soup and 2 hours later, I'm not thirsty, which probably means they didn't use loads of MSG.  Everything about the ramen was done perfectly - my only complaint is that the portion was very small for the hefty price tag of $11.00.  This is probably one of the most expensive bowl of ramen I had, given the size of it.  I finished the whole thing and felt I still could have eaten more.  I just wish they would give you a bit more especially that they are charging $11 for it.   I had a taste of the Udon and Bento Box combo and think those are just average.  Nothing extraordinary about them.  $9.50 each.  \n\nWait service is ok - it's a small restaurant so only 1 waiter.  He seemed to be attentive and got things done quickly.  The one thing you need to note is that there is a long wait for your food.  Expect at least 15 mins.  So if you're super hungry, you will be hangry by the time the food comes.\n\nOverall, I think if you have a massive craving for a good bowl of ramen, willing to wait and fork out 11-12 bucks, this is the place to go.

It can get packed really fast so we were lucky to grab a seat before it got crazy around 6 PM on a Sunday night. Prices are pretty decent around $11-ish for the ramen and sushi from $4-12 bucks.\n\nRAMEN HERE IS SO TASTY! We got an order of Tonkatsu Garlic Shoyu and Torigara (chicken ramen). The tonkatsu is not too heavy but a complimentary savory with the noodles (btw great ratio too on this), meat, and egg. I wasn't too fond of the egg because the yolk was a bit overcooked for me. If you're interested in trying out chicken broth instead of the pork, the Torigara is a solid choice. It's pretty much the same as the Tonkatsu (noodle, egg, meat etc) with the broth being a bit lighter but also creamy! It's a different experience for the taste buds so yes on this! The chashu itself was really tasty without the broth and that's really saying something about how they're preparing the meats here too.\n\nI don't know what it was but the water and cup here smelled kinda funky like old Chinese hobby gift shops. Skip for me! Service was kind of slow with little check up from the servers but difficult to walk around in general. \n\nPASS on the sushi here! We ordered the Rainbow roll which is considered a specialty roll here for $7. We were so disappointed with it since it didn't taste too fresh and it came out to only 4 rolls only too. I guess it's more ramen than it is anything else. Anywhoo, still a solid ramen shop if you're looking for comfort food around here!", "author": "Jia Qi F."}

Mensho is a hit among my friends, and the buzziest name at the moment, but I'll pass on waits upwards of two hours (despite my love for ramen, I have my limits).  Yet, ironically enough, I may have found exactly what I was looking for in the exact opposite type of place!\n\nStationed out in the far and quiet reaches of the Outer Richmond, Miki is an under the radar gem and the epitome of a neighborhood joint - a tiny, mom-and-pop shop without the frills, but with all of the good food.  While ramen is clearly the name of game here (evidenced by the full menu page devoted to your customization options), there are a number of non-ramen entrees available (lunch boxes/plates, donbouris, curries, and udon/soba), along with a bunch of small dishes on their specialties board.\n\n-- CHICKEN KARAAGE\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/miki-restaurant-san-francisco?select=c4EoEqsQRpwICGQjB6VLNw)\nA fairly plain rendition, but in a good way!  The batter was the perfect thickness and it was really crispy.  Plus, the chicken was both well seasoned and juicy.  Unfortunately, I didn't catch the price on the menu board (and my buddy paid), but there's no question that this was one of the better karaages I've had.\n\n-- GARLIC MISO TONKOTSU RAMEN with Chashu, Nitamago (Seasoned Boiled Egg), Menma, and Green Onions...$9.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/miki-restaurant-san-francisco?select=pei1uGKcg5FxpDwpwYbPwg)\nSimply put, this was pretty awesome.  The noodles had just the right bite to them and the included condiments were solid as well (no dry chashu here!).  It also didn't hurt that the Pork Belly I added (+$3.00) was fantastic as well (not too fatty, very tender).  However, to me, the broth was the star - deep and rich with a nice garlicky flavor).\n\nAlso, I think it's worth noting that we didn't run into the slow service that a lot of the older reviews have mentioned.  Rather, things moved at a steady pace and our server was quite friendly.  Admittedly though, we had also arrived towards the latter portion of their lunch service, so we might have missed the crowds.  In any case, if you're willing to stand outside for hours in the TL for ramen, waiting inside at your table with a drink in hand shouldn't be that big of a deal.\n\nFOUR AND A HALF STARS ROUNDED UP.", "author": "Mike L."}

A ramen shop in the Outer Richmond probably won't have a crazy line - was my initial thought. When we arrived, there was a waiting list, but not a very long one. The restaurant is rather small with a handful of tables and just a couple of cooks behind the counter of a very small kitchen. \n\nWe ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen with Pork Belly and Torigara Ramen (chicken flavor). Once our food arrived, we enjoyed some very surprisingly tasty ramen. I wasn't expecting to receive subpar ramen or anything, but I was more surprised that Miki managed to stay under the radar. Hopefully it stays that way. Both had translucent, but visibly fatty broth, which means more flavor. The pork broth had slightly more body to it. The noodles were thick and chewy. The ramen included chashu, half a boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and green onions. The yolk in the egg was cooked solid, but still very gooey. \n\nWe also ordered takoyaki, which were delightfully milky and creamy on the inside, and crunchy on the outside, with a sprinkling of bonito flakes flailing to and fro. \n\nThe rest of the menu includes all the usual Japanese dishes, including sushi, okonomiyaki, and so forth. I may give the other selections a try, but it seemed a bit overwhelming to look through. \nNow, the health inspection score is rather low, but I think they do rather well in their limited facilities. After a couple of times here, I've left full and satisfied. I've seen dirty, dingy places with 90+ scores. Such ratings reveal very little about how the restaurant falls short of restaurant standards and don't hold much weight in my eyes.

That to me is always a good thing, especially for authentic comfort foods, such as ramen. We got there relatively early in the evening, so seating was ample...  \n\nThe ramen did not disappoint. We got the Tonkotsu Garlic Miso Ramen and the Tonkotsu Spicy Miso ramen (regular). We also got Chicken Karage and a rainbow roll.\n\nTonkotsu ramen (garlic miso) - Great depth of flavor. The broth is deep, not watery, and fulfilling. The garlic permeates throughout the rich broth, and every once in awhile, you get a surprise of roasted garlic clove. Noodles are more al-dente then most ramen joints, so that's much appreciated. Don't get soggy seating in the broth. I added some pork-belly to the mix, and that was such a smart move. Appropriate mix of fat/meat. Delectable.\n\nSpicy Miso - Similar to above (but no garlic). Spicy-level on point. Seemed a little bit thinner than the garlic version. I enjoyed the garlic one much more. But as we were leaving, the server brought out a spicy garlic miso!!! Next time, Imma try that.\n\nChicken Karage - Five pieces. Non-fatty. Not greasy. Expertly battered and fried. Loved it.\n\nRainbow roll - My advice is to skip it. And also likely skip all the sushi option. I should have known given you can't see a sushi bar, or the chef.

After enjoying Miki's freshly cooked, steamy bowls of ramen, I now detest too-fast-to-be-true lukewarm broths even more.\n\nRamen is $9.50 for regular pork or chicken broth base, shoyu/shio/miso ($9.75 for garlic or spicy miso), and basic toppings of 1/2 egg, 1 piece of chashu, green onions, and menma. Almost too basic with only one piece of chashu and no kikurage, but it's same complimentary toppings as Izakaya Sokai in the Inner Sunset. Also, default noodle portions are decent enough to keep you from going hungry. Noodles are the curly yellow ones used at many ramen places, standard and warranting neither tirade nor eulogy about noodle QQ/al dente-ness.\n\nThe broth definitely stands out the most--nice and balanced, strong tonkotsu flavors, not too creamy or salty, and it seemed to have a stronger sesame taste than most places. The boo got the GARLIC MISO which was deliicously garlicky; I got the SPICY MISO and because it was an extra $0.25, I opted for the extra spicy level. While most spicy miso I've tried is mild at best, Miki's had quite a kick and, at long last, satisfied my hunt for actually-spicy miso. The catch is that the broth was hotter than expected and I dismissed it as spiciness, ending up with minor mouth burns... first world problems :X\n\nOther notes:\n- They also had an interesting vegetarian kelp broth, but it costs more at ~$11.50, plus I was in a carnivorous mood. \n- After we ordered, I heard another table saying the pork belly (extra $3) is a must-get. Because of the small chashu serving, I would recommend saving your Purple Kow change for the pork belly addition, especially if you are in a carnivorous mood. \n- TL;DR: good quality broth but could use more toppings and is pricey-ish.

Well then, it's time to make your way to Miki. Miki has a good mix of ramen and sushi dishes. There are different ramen \"flavors\" you choose from with the vegetarian options (a kelp based broth) being miso, garlic miso, and spicy miso. Being the spice devil I am, I ordered the spicy miso. It seemed like the best option for a rainy day too! I was definitely not let down. The veggie broth was developed enough to hold my interest and satisfy my palate.

We came at the right time to this tiny restaurant as there were only three tables occupied, but quickly filled up after.  There was only one waiter & I believe only one person working the kitchen, so it's probably not best to come here if you're in a rush during prime time hours like we were.  I like the menu had lots of different ramen options including a chicken broth which I went with.  The build your own bowl of udon also caught my eye, but I saw the good reviews on the garlic ramen broths, so I decided to go with the chicken broth based garlic ramen and he went with the tonkatsu ramen.  \n\nBe forewarned you will have stank breath after eating this!  It was very garlicky (good thing).  I also liked how the egg had oozy yolk, but it was really cold.  I felt like the price of the ramen ($9.75) was steep for what you got - half a soft boiled egg, green onions, bamboo shoots, and two small pieces of pork.  Though the egg was still yolky, noodles were cooked fine, and the broth was good, it's not one of our top choices.

What I love is that you get to order what soup base you want. If you want chicken instead, they offer that. If you prefer vegetable broth, they also have that.\n\nMy spicy miso tonkotsu included half a soft boiled egg, slices of pork, bamboo shoots, minced garlic, chopped green onions, and a piece of seaweed on the side. The soup was very flavorful and delicious. I finished my bowl and wanted more. The soup was a little oily, but it wasn't overwhelming.\n\nMy friend ordered the garlic miso tonkotsu. I had a sip of her soup and it was definitely garlicky. If you're a fan of garlic, that is the ramen you should try.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the ramen at this restaurant. I thought it was a little pricy for the amount of ramen that we got, but it was still good. \n\nI think my biggest concern for this place is the service. While we were there, a few tables were occupied. The restaurant wasn't full, but the service was still slow. We waited over half an hour for our food. Maybe it wouldn't have been too bad of a wait, but we were hungry when we arrived so the wait made us a little bit grouchy. From what I saw, I think the chef in the kitchen makes the ramen bowls individually. Which means it takes awhile for us to get our food.\n\nI recommend not going here if you're extremely hungry because it does take awhile for the food to come out.

Thick broth and flavorful pieces of pork and egg! Definitely spicy enough but didn't have me crying (like my most recent experience at an izakaya...). \n\nThe restaurant is super teeny tiny.

Their tonkotsu base is perfectly creamy and flavorful, and their noodles are the perfect texture and thickness. As with other good ramen restaurants in the bay, if you show up at prime dinner-eating times on weekend nights, you will likely have to wait a bit before getting seated, but it's worth it.

The proximity to the ocean was nice, and parking (my worst fear) wasn't too difficult to find. \n\nThe waiter was friendly and relaxed, and seemed relatively busy, but since it was a small restaurant, one waiter was definitely enough (my water glass was never empty). He was very attentive at all times -- thank goodness! I hate having to do the half-sitting half-standing awkward wave dance to the waiter every time I need something. \n\n**TIP** Don't order the tea unless you are ready to pay an extra $1.50 per person. Purple Kow is right across the street if you want a post-dinner tea drink! \n\nThe restaurant itself is tiny, with maybe about 10-15 small tables inside. We came here on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm, and were able to grab a table -- but it filled up quickly shortly after we arrived. \n\nAs for the ramen: It was good, but nothing too special, especially for the price (~$10). The broth was flavorful, the noodles were decent, and soft-boiled egg was delicious, but the bamboo shoots were a little too squishy for my taste (around the consistency of a mushroom). If you're looking for ramen in SF, I actually enjoyed Katana-Ya (by Union Square) a lot more -- but you'll definitely get a shorter line here. \n\nOverall, I had a decent experience at this place.

The pork belly is very well marinated but it's not the typical so soft it melts in your mouth.  It's a bit tough...

The food is good, but not worth the drive across the park followed by a wait in the cold (while there's an open table waiting to be wiped down for 10 minutes). To be fair they were packed and the 2 nice wait (and 3-4 kitchen) staff seemed overwhelmed, but I've been to other similarly sized and staffed restaurants that managed to quickly get things out/done. \n\nAppetizers/rolls ordered: \nThe caterpillar roll was good but fried shrimp is not hard to make tasty. Menu said 6 pieces?? we got 4. Salmon skin roll was nice and crispy, happy with that one. Gyoza filling was good. \n\nRamen: \nGarlic miso and garlic shoyu were both good because of all of the grated garlic and roasted garlic. I love garlic..but also think the broth could have had more flavor. The garlic made the soup, was not impressed by the broth. Been to ramen places where the soup is rich and fantastic on its own. \n\nTonkatsu was good. Added corn (canned, could do without). Egg was nice and runny. \n\nOverall it's a decent place for Japanese if you're in the neighborhood and don't mind waiting a long time for edible ramen. Next time I'm craving out of this world noodles though, I'll stick to my joint in the Inner Sunset.", "author": "Liz L."}

We put it our order as soon as we could, spicy miso ramen and garlic miso ramen. We waited.. And waited.. And waited. We noticed that 4 groups of people that had gotten put in there order before us still didn't have their food yet. 45 mins later, we got our ramen. At first glance, everything looked okay. However, our broth looked pretty oily. My friend's broth in her garlic miso ramen wasn't that flavorful so she asked for spicy oil to get a bit of kick in the broth. But what she was handed was a small bowl of sriracha and sesame oil. She mixed it into her broth and immediately noticed that her garlic miso tasted exactly the same as my spicy miso, just with sriracha and sesame oil added. In addition, both of our broths were extremely salty.\n\nPrices were pretty high for the lack of quality in our food. The cost to add pork belly is $3 and the price of our ramen was $12.50 each. The pork belly was really tender but seemed like it was soaked in sugar and soy sauce for a little too long. The flavors were too different with the ramen that I almost lost my appetite.\n\nHowever, the service from the waiter was excellent. My advice to Miki would be to hire more waiters so that one person isn't stressed out the entire time.", "author": "Bonnie S."}

I am a public health employee and to score that low means that your restaurant is beyond dirty! Go to their restroom and you'll find a guy in the back washing dishes in one communal tub with ALL the dishes literally getting thrown in infested water from previously old food and Lord knows what else. I'm pretty damn sure that does not meet the mere health standards. The kitchen is even worse! It looks like a back alley that hasn't been sanitized or wiped down in years! The water pitcher is stained with dirt and looks like it hasn't been washed at all. It looks like it been purchased in the 1990s and has not been replaced since. When we were given our tea pot, I lifted it up and there were traces of dirt on our table. There was also only one server who was handling EVERYTHING, wiping down tables, clearing dishes, delivering food, and taking care of people's bill and for the few hours we were there, I have not seen him wash his hands once. \n\nIt was busy, there was only one chef and it took them half an hour for our appetizer to arrive.

Since being introduced to the fresh ramen at Miki, I have been back 1-2 times per month and have yet to veer from the ramen path! And, since discovering this wondrous ramen, havefound myself ordering ramen at other places, only to be sorely disappointed! I've yet to find a better ramen!\n\nI religiously order the spicy Tonkatsu miso ramen,  deviating once to the roasted garlic variety which I found tasty, but not my preference to w/out.\n\nWarning: wait time is a bit inconsistent.  My friend and I were informed on our last visit that due to a large order ahead of ours, it could be a half hour wait for our ramen. Not to worry-we had ordered sushi and wakame which was fairly quick and staved off the hunger while we waited!  This time, our \"usual\" had corn and an oily film on top which I took to be butter. I'm not sure if this was an order error or a \"bonus\" for the wait, since corn and butter are among several \"add on\" toppings you may choose for an additional fee. Yummy!\n\nI continue to go back, as I can't seem to shake this newfound craving! Sadly, the other offerings are never ordered by me, though they look really good!  I just keep ordering the ramen!  The \"white board\" offerings look extensive, with items \"sold out\" by the time I get there at my usual later weeknight hour!  \n\nSpeaking of which, I have always been on a late weeknight and there are always others there! On occasion, one or two other staggered tables of guests; more frequently,  rotation of 4-8 other parties of 2-4.  It is a small space with limited seating. Tonight, four other parties were seated, making it half-full. One other couple came in while we dined. It's small, it's cozy.\n\nLast, I will just say that they have this wonderful dessert ( and yes, I'm a \npig as you can see, as I'm outting myself  by informing you that I ALWAYS get a bowl of ramen-and you can see I get sushi , too!). Anyway, this dessert consists if three little wonton-wrapped, mochi, nanana and sweet red bean-filled fried dumplings served with a dainty scoop of green tea ice-cream with just the slightest drizzle of chocolate \nsauce, sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Pretty divine way to end a piggy \nsession! Run out on occasion, not always part of my Ramen run!\n\nSmall (not great for parties larger than perhaps 6), sometimes a bit of a wait; I would be VERY SAD if this restaurant ceased to exist! Viva la Miki!\n\nETA: It occurred to me that it is worth mentioning that they only accept credit cards during dinner hours.

The lunch specials are a great deal (only $8.50!) for two selections plus rice, miso soup, and a small salad.  I ordered the chicken katsu and the saba shioyaki.  They were excellent and very flavorful.  The portions of each were about half of a what you would normally expect but probably hence why they give you two.\n\nWhile cheap and pretty good, this restaurant lacks the normal flare of your typical Japanese restaurant. The sushi selection is sub-par and the quality is average (the fish looked okay and got some mixed reviews by my friends who ordered it).  Moreover, the service (because there was only one person and one chef) was very limited, but still sufficient.\n\nIts a decent restaurant for a quick bite and reasonable if you're looking for some cheap Japanese food.

Ramen Dojo - Just didn't do it for me and I'm not a fan at all.\n\nAhh, the takoyaki - Possibly one of the best versions I've had! Crispy outside with big pieces of octopus inside - One included a full tentacle! YUM :) Perfect texture inside and very fresh.\n\nDownsides: VERY small restaurant. Decor? None. Service? Slow because they had one waiter (who was very nice) for 8 tables (approx 18 people) and two chefs.\n\nTIP: MAKE SURE YOU PAY FOR PARKING!", "author": "Con L."}

So I walked over to Miki because I of their $13 chirashi. \n\nWhen I entered the restaurant everyone there was ordering ramen, which made me slightly regret my chirashi order. Looking at the chirashi, I now understand why it was $13 -- less fish. Instead of the normal two pieces of each type of fish, I only got one and there were only 5 different fishes. Very small but still very satisfying. Also ordered two unagi nigiri for $3.75, which was totally worth it.

I ordered the tonkotsu garlic miso broth & the garlic was a wee bit overwhelming for me. And trust me, I LOVE garlic. I probably still smelled & tasted garlic 2 days later. The noodles were good, though. I like them aldente (harder) & that's how they were made. It didn't get soggy either. \n\n1 star less because the service was really slow. It took awhile to order, then another 20 minutes or so to receive our food.

LUCKILY that place was closed and I wound up across the street at this Hidden gem! I Yelped it and saw some good reviews about the Ramen bowls so in an effort to speed things up I went with the basic chicken broth ramen TO GO. The server was quick and friendly, and my Ramen  was done in 5-10 minutes. Normally I'm really not that into Ramen because they never have flavor, BUT THIS RAMEN IS THE BOMB.COM.... seriously!! It may not look like much in its' small togo containers but as soon as I opened the broth I could smell the flavor, and the ramen itself was perfectly cooked. Not super mushy but soft and slightly chewy. It tasted really fresh. They also have bamboo shoots that have ridiculous flavor and not to mention a soft boiled egg that I will probably order extra of next time! Once I took a bite I was instantly glad I had ordered it togo..... because I chowed down like a fat kid eating the corner piece of a chocolate birthday cake!

Luckily, we decided to look them up online first to see what time they opened and discovered that they're closed on Tuesdays. :(\n\nI still wanted ramen, so instead, I did a proximity search on Yelp for a ramen restaurant open on Tuesdays and stumbled upon Miki.\n\nI have never even heard nor seen this place.  And it's not that far from my digs.  Yes, I said digs.  I thought I'd try it out.  I don't really like it.  I probably won't be using it again.\n\nYelp says they don't open until noon, so we didn't get there until 12:30pm.  FYI, it looks like they're open before noon since their afternoon happy hour is from 11:45am - 2:00pm.  Parking on Balboa street is metered, but they're doing a TON of construction in the neighborhood right now so it's a bit crazy.  We found FREE street parking on 37th Avenue, so that was pretty convenient.\n\nThere's about 8 tables in the restaurant.  6 two-tops and 2 four-tops, I think.  When we got there, 5 tables were already occupied.\n\nI ordered the Garlic Miso Tonkatsu Broth Ramen and A had the Spicy Miso Chicken Broth Ramen.  The noodles were perfectly al dente.  The soup was not hot, but more on the hotter than warm side.  I loved the soft-boiled egg.  I think I discovered what my favorite kind of egg is.

If the restaurant is filled to it's limited capacity, it will take a while for the waitress to take your order and your food will take quite some time to come out which can seem like for-ev-ver if you're already starving before getting here. Also, the waitress isn't all that friendly but she gets the job done. \n\nNonetheless, I am fan of both the tonkotsu garlic miso ramen and the tonkotsu spicy ramen. The ramen bowls come with chasu, egg, nori, bamboo shoots, and green onion. A bowl comes with plenty of chewy noodles and the best part of the ramen for me is the thick, rich flavorful broth. The garlic miso ramen packs a lot of garlic flavor with garlic bits in the broth, and garlic paste and whole cloves of roasted garlic atop the noodles. As for the spicy ramen, it's very flavorful in its own way. It carries a nice kick of heat that lingers in your throat.\n\nI'm not sure how the rest of the rolls compare but I was unimpressed with the red roll (tuna, avocado and crab). It was simply a flavorless roll that I think may be due to the lacking quality of the ingredients. \n\nI would definitely return to Miki for the ramen and even to try the specials listed on their white board. In preparation for future visits, I plan to account for the extra time required to dine at Miki and plan to bring a whole lotta patience along too.\n\nOn a side note, I saw a paper on the wall which said Cash Only during lunchtime but they do take card at dinnertime.

We were second in line until the couple in front of us bounced -- they realized how slowly everyone was getting served. There was one server for a full house, which might have worked better if she had been more efficient or friendly. Instead, it seemed like she was avoiding us (incl. making eye contact with us) the whole time we were there. We waited 10 min for a table, 15 min to order, 10 min for water, 45 min for our food to come out, 10 min to get our check once we called for it... and these are likely underestimates. My sympathies. It must be hard being one person serving a whole house, and I won't blame the server-- but management needs to add more waitstaff. Otherwise, my friends and I will just be ordering takeout.

I always leave with a warm garlicky breath. I always order the same, tonkatsu garlic miso ramen with nitamago. The eggs are the best! I love soft boiled eggs. However, something was different today when I walked in. The menus are new! The catch is that everything on the ramen menu was more expensive. A dollar more to everything. The extra egg was 1.50 instead of just 1 dollar and the ramen was 9.25 instead of 8:50 or so. I continued to order my ramen anyway. However, when I got my order, there was less soup than there usually was. Leaving me somewhat disappointed since I had to eat just noodles for the first few bites so I wouldn't run out of soup for the end. Overall tasted the same, just kinda sad about the soup and how prices were raised. But I will be glad to help a small business open! :)", "author": "Joyce M."}

The only sign they have with their name is the blue curtain thing out front with the tiny \"MIKI\" print on it.\n\nBeen wanting to try this spot out for so long and finally got the chance.  \n\nWe ordered:\nMiso Ramen $8.50 with corn $1.00\nChicken teriyaki and Tonkatsu bento $12\nDragon Roll $5 \nOrange Roll $5 (salmon, avocado, cali roll)\n\nRamen was amazingly good! It even came with half an egg and the yolk was still runny! So good! Came also with cha-su, seaweed, green onions, etc. The ramen itself was pretty good. I wonder if it's freshly made or package though. Only complaint is for $8.50, I would expect at least maybe two pieces of cha-su..\n\nChicken teriyaki and tonkatsu was really moist and flavorful, not dry at all! The breading on the tonkatsu didn't fall apart like some other restaurants, plus!\n\nDragon roll and orange roll, both $5, came with 4 pieces, huge pieces, each. All the tables that were eating there, all had an order of the Orange Roll also. Good choice. The salmon was fresh and slices of salmon were perfect size. They definitely do not skimp on there fish. Both were delicious.\n\nThe restaurant itself isn't the biggest. Looks like it seats about 20 or even less. The service was amazing.

I didn't want Katana-ya; it was too far and too pricy. I didn't want Santa Ramen or Ramen Dojo, again because they're too far. Thus I turned to yelp and searched ramen and lo and behold Miki poped up. And I'm glad it did.\n\nInitially I was terrified; I perused the menu and I saw no mention of ramen! Note to everyone, their ramen offerings are posted on the wall! I chose the spicy miso. \n\nThe broth was GOOD. It was thick, thoroughly flavorful, full bodied. It coated the mouth and brought me happiness. Unfortunately the same could not be said for the noodles, which is half the bowl. The noodles were disappointingly mediocre. They lacked the chewiness and and firmness ramen noodles should have and they simply did not match the quality of the broth. The egg was delectable and creamy, possibly one of the best ramen eggs I've ever had. but it was cold. \n\nIf Miki can bring up the quality of the noodles, this would almost certainly be a 5 star joint. The broth is incredible and the location is great, not forcing me to go downtown or out of they city just for lunch. The egg really helps add to the quality of the bowl too; however the noodles detract from it. I will definitely be returning to miki just to satisfy my ramen cravings but the noodles make it a slightly bittersweet return.", "author": "Chris D."}

Unsuspecting newcomers might be agitated by the agonizing wait after ordering, so HEED MY WARNING, and only go if you've got the time.  If it's any consolation, the food is fresh, and it seems they run out of things here and there - my guess is probably because they don't use those made-to-last-forever preserved ingredients. \n\nTheir ramen has shot up to the top of my list for ramen in the Bay Area.  I'm not crazy - I think it's safe to say I've been around the ramen block many times to compare and contrast and know what's good.\n\nI got the Tonkatsu Garlic Shoyu ramen. AGAIN.

Usually when I order spicy ramen the broth  is either too spicy or not spicy enough, or it's too salty and tastes like Shin Ramyun (yenno... that Korean noodle in a bag). This broth was well beyond my expectations with a rich orange color and little fat blobs floating around the rim. As you eat the spiciness builds but doesn't overpower the pork base. The black pepper on top of my bamboo was completely unnecessary.  The noodles needed some work, the first bite was already a little too gummy for my taste - a sign that they'd been boiled for a minute too long. By the time I was half way through the bowl the noodles were fat and soggy. \n\nI'd have no problem coming back when I'm in the area again, maybe I'll try the Tonkatsu Shoyu or Tonkatsu Garlic next.

I can taste these things, and its the detail that draws the masterpiece. nonetheless, Miki has a balance that many japanese restaurants do not have, and that is the balance between mixture and flavor. It's that feng shui that makes a bunch of insignificants turn into something beautiful. also, Miki portions come nicely, and the chefs inside knows how to make you happy (except for the tempura). \n\nThe ramen, was also really good, full of flavor; however, like many other yelp reviews, I too found it a little.. full of residue, which only means one thing: fat. if you don't mind that minor detail, Miki's ramen is definitely worth a shot, or two, or three and a sapporo.", "author": "simon k."}

The broth is much thicker than Ramen Dojo's and the pork flavor in the broth was more distinct. The noodles were somewhat chewy, but, closer to the soft side (which I don't mind at all). It also helps to ask for a side of the spicy sauce they add to their soups just to give your ramen a little kick!\n\nThe service was decent, being that there was only one server.

I have yet to try Muracci's curry so I can't make a comparison to the purported best curry in SF. I have tried Japacurry before and although their curry has better flavoring than Miki, at least I don't need to find the Japacurry truck and I get bigger portions. One thing about Miki's curry is their sauce has bits and pieces of shredded pork which is an excellent touch. The tonkatsu (pork cutlet) curry is what I usually get and it's about $10. If you have a huge appetite, one order may not be enough.\n\nOther highlights are their ramen (which I won't review, there is already so many here) and their sashimi is fresh although choices are limited. I won't bother ordering rolls since there are tons of Japanese roll restaurants littering the Bay Area now to eat at but I'm sure Miki's rolls taste just fine and dandy. I do like their spicy tuna handroll and both their hamachi belly and amaebi have been consistently good. No fried head with the amaebi though :( I overhead on two separate occasions that their omelet dish is really good but I have no idea what it is and will ask the waitress next time and try it.\n\nHonestly this place probably doesn't deserve 4 stars when stacking it up against other more specialized Japanese cuisine restaurants.

I'm so glad when we're back in our old neighborhood to see this place still in business. It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall and the chef/owner does a great job keeping things both fresh and interesting. For example you can taste that he makes his own broth and keeps things good by keeping them simple. I particularly love the way he does his saba shioyaki. \n\nIt is also a pretty reasonable Japanese restaurant which is saying something. The box combos are a great deal and a consistent favorite of ours. The last time I ordered the udon just because I noticed he had added more soups and noodles to the menu. It was no surprise that this dish was as typically good as most others I've had there. \n\nIf there is anything to complain about it is the fact that service can get a little slow here. To be honest I accepted that pace at most Japanese restaurants a long time ago. Here I would also add the factor that the operation is often run by only a couple of people (like the chef and the one server) so when they even get a slight rush things can get backed up. All I can say to that is relax and enjoy your meal and the company at your table. \n\nI just hope that this little gem can stay in business. So far so good.", "author": "David H."}

In case there were any vegetarians out there wondering, they do have non-Tonkatzu flavors - it's just too bad that they were all \"OUT.\"  \n\nI looked up at the bulletin board and saw a good variety of dinner options.  It's too bad that 1/3 of them were also \"OUT.\"  Okay, so I decided to give the tuna katsu a try because after giving up most kinds of meat, I realized it's been years since I've had tonkatsu sauce.\n\nGood thing we had a lot of time allotted for dinner because there was only one server and though there were less than 10 tables, it took a ridiculously long time for the food to come out.  \n\nThe tuna katsu portion was really large, but it was a little too tough for my liking.  The futomaki roll (which generally is vegetarian - but this one had some fish in it or bonito?) was wrapped very poorly.\n\nI can't say that I will return.", "author": "Alvina W."}

The squid is bomb for appetizers. Followed by a mentai omelette cooked to perfection. Cucumber salad is light and refreshing. For the main event, I always order the Beef Soy Sauce butter. And the answer is yes, it tastes as amazing as its name implies. It's like a Japanese version of the filipino dish know was bistek. The quality of steak is quite awesome in my opinion. Along with some green beans and steamed rice, this dish is a hitter for sure. And finally, wrap up the meal with some fried chakin for dessert. I love this place. =)", "author": "Alvin P."}

The best broth I've had to date. Rich but still light, and with good flavor depth from the shoyu and pork, which is surprising of the shoyu, which is usually simple and more neutral. I believe its from the pork they add. While they only add 1 slice, which sort of sucks since most ramen houses give you 2, the consistency is perfect. The pork is always tender, perfectly salted, and has a good amount of fat, which also adds to the flavor. It feels like they also portion out the right amounts of radish, seaweed, garlic cloves and bamboo shoots into this ramen, as each element is enough to flavor the ramen, but not overwhelm it.  This place has the best bamboo shoots, mildly enough flavored, with a soft crunch. The egg is also a winner. A perfectly medium boiled egg, with a nice partially yolky center... this egg ties with Daikokuya for being the best. This also helps to thicken and enrich the ramen broth, but I usually just eat it up because hey it tastes good. The noodles are also cooked perfectly, but I actually prefer the broth to a point where I just have soup left.\n\nTonkotsu Garlic Miso\nThe only difference here is the soup broth being miso flavored. Compared to other Miso broths, this one did not feel as heavy or had as much of that fermented soy taste that could potentially overwhelm people. \n\nIf you love garlic, add extra garlic. Its totally worth it but at times can overpower the broth flavor if you can't handle garlic spice.", "author": "Marc T."}

Now, with that said, here's my thoughts on Miki's.\n\ni've visited countless ramen restaurants the bay area had to offer. living in SF, I really wanted \"the hype\" about Miki to be true. driving one hour to  Santouka, located in San Jose, (arguably serving the best tasting ramen in the bay area) was not economical. \n\nTonkatsu ramen:\nthe noodles and broth were average at best. the chasu nearly tasteless. the egg tasted like egg. according to the menu it should be seasoned. \n\nGarlic Miso tonkatsu ramen:\nthe noodles, chasu and egg taste is similar to the tonkatsu ramen. as for the broth, i couldn't make an assessment. Sadly, all i tasted was the mince garlic that is similar to that of bottled minced garlic you purchase at some asian super market. garlic should't overwhelm the broth, it should complement the dish. \n\nPro: Price, located in san francisco, adjacent to purple kow, abundance of parking. \nCon: excessive garlic taste. \n\nAgain, although i've visited many ramen restaurants in the bay area, only miki, Izakaya Sozai and Santouka are worth noting. In my opinion, Izakay Sozai serves the best ramen in SF. However, Santouka serves the best ramen in the Bay Area.", "author": "Jude Q."}

The selection is a quarter of what a typical sushi place would offer, but they ditch tons of redundant overcomplicated rolls in favor of traditional classics with top-notch fish and rice.  \n\nRolls here come to your table at room temperature with sticky, chewy rice that melts in the mouth, crispy seaweed, and fish that always tastes fresh and clean.  I hate getting rolls at a sushi place with fish that's still half frozen and cold, dense rice with a soggy seaweed wrapper.  The quality here has impressed me beyond any other Japanese restaurant i've tried in the city.  \n\nThe chirashi bowl is really great too!  So many places just serve up a bland offering of fish on rice, but here the sampling is varied and attention is paid to the bed of rice itself instead of treating it as an afterthought.\n\nIn addition to the great sushi they have a fantastic selection of authentic Ramen, which is also a bit on the simple side compared to trendier bowls you'll find at other places in the city.  A nice complex broth and chewy noodles never disappoint though.\n\nConsidering how many times I've come here for sushi and ramen, I've tried to sample some of the other offerings on the menu as well and have never been disappointed.

It seems like a 2 man team, the chef works in the back, and the young lady serves the front.  I have a soft spot for simple mom & pop shops.\n\nThe menu offers typical appetizers, nigoris, donburi, noodle soups, and dinner entrees.  The entrees look pretty good, I'll try that next time.  The specialty rolls are written on the wall, VERY affordable.  Each roll has about 4-5 pieces for $4-5.  They even have $2 California roll, that's cheaper than the fake ones at Safeway or Lucky's.  \n\nWe had a half order of salmon sashimi, the catepillar roll, a dragon roll, a california roll with unagi, and a bottle of Nigori sake.  The verdict?  YUM.  The chilled sake was perfect for the hot day, rolls aren't the best, but good enough, the sashimi seems fresh.  The only gripe I have is that the sashimi I had wasn't cut from a great section of the salmon, they left some silver skin on, and the pieces were too thin for my liking.  Yes, I'm wayyy too serious about my sashimi, so ignore if you don't care for raw fish.  \n\nRegardless, I have a feeling this place is at its best with its dinner plates, not the rolls.

Standing around now next to the kitchen window 7 minutes later , I decided to go and grab the menu my self. After doing so the lady rudely ripped it out of my hands only to say that's the lunch menu. I stood back not knowing what this lady was doing ripping anything out of my hands especially after ignoring me now for more then 10 minutes. Getting frustrated I started on my way to the door as she came back and gave me the correct menu. I looked over the menu briskly and told her I was ready to order with her responding \"ok, one second\". After waiting another five minutes I decided my business wasn't needed here as I now wasted eighteen minutes waiting to just place an order. Maybe their food is great, and maybe I would have came here all the time and told all of my friends about this place, but being treated like I was I would never ever come here again!!!!", "author": "Vlad M."}

Damn, the cali roll was the best I've ever had by far!  It just melted once i started chewing, and it tasted really balanced.  There was just the right amount of everything in the roll.  I'm going to go back there and just order a bunch of that. \n\nThe salmon cucumber was good, but I didn't like it nearly as much. \n\nI think that just based on how amazing the Cali roll was, that this place really knows what they're doing.

We have not looked back yet. \n\nThe food is super traditional Japanese Mom and Pop status, and i'll be the first to tell you, it's amazing. Also the prices are so low that when you get the bill you'll actually feel as if you are robbing them.

(1) Since then, I've had a couple of the other bowls of ramen from other places in the city that were more deserving of 5 stars.  (2) Today, my brother and I went for lunch and had a not so great experience there.  The place was close to full, but there was only one server there. She didn't speak great English, and maybe wasn't the right person to be running the front of the house by herself.  The service was slow, and they forgot the pork belly in both of our bowls of ramen.  We had been waiting so long when the bowls came that we asked them to bring the pork belly separate.  It took at least 10 minutes for the pork belly to come, and when it did, it was a bit too sweet, and not entirely warmed through. The texture was good, but it would've been much better if it had been in the soup when we got it. The ramen itself was delicious -- I had spicy garlic miso tonkatsu and my brother had garlic shoyu tonkatsu -- but for some reason I got one piece of pork and he got five pieces.  I understand it's a small, probably family-run place, but they need to be more careful in the future to make sure that people keep coming back for their great bowls of noodles.", "author": "Pilan C."}

It's the only place that I actually can go to everyday and probably still not be tired of it. But everything is sooooo gooood here. It's my secret little spot hidden away in the fog of Richmond. Everytime I come here it feels like I'm back in Japan eating at those cozy neighborhood restaurants and izakayas. The best part is that Miki's serves all of it in one place, whereas in Japan you had to pick 1. At Miki's everythings rolled up into a fuzzy little ball. Izakaya, Sushi, and good ol' homecooking in one place!\n\nIf you come here you have to get something off the specials board. It sucks that some of its in Japanese but you have to try the Hotate (scallops) in butter served in the shell with butter and sake I think. Also the tigerprawn gyoza, gyu-tan (beef tongue), ika karaage, and chawanmushi are all good bets for appetizers. I'm not normally a sushi-roll type of guy, but my favorite sushi roll is the spicy-tuna/avacado crunch with tempura batter on top. it's worth my trip there alone! And for dinners the Beef Soy Sauce butter is deee-lish, another one of my regular orders. I don't know what he does or where he gets that beef but it just so damn tasty. Other things I normally get are the Chirashi, Saba shioyaki (can't live with out that), and the Tuna yukke don (it's like marinated korean raw yukke style beef only with tuna). Theres a whole lot of other things that are on the board that are great and if you're tired of the same old chicken teriyaki vanilla restaurants around the city, try hitting Miki's up, but watch out if it's packed.

The teriyaki sauce wasn't overtly salty as some places tend to do and just the right sweetness ratio. The Ikura was not too salty and tasted fresh. \nBecause there's only 1 server for the entire floor, he was kept hopping...but he was unfailingly polite and asked about my experience with my meal...kudos...\nNext time I want to try the peach sorbet for dessert which they serve in an actual peach.\nParking is great if you come after 7:30...and gets progressively worse as the night goes on.\n\n**Lunch Update** They have a really filling lunch box offering of 2 items for $6.50...$5.50 for the 1 item.

I wouldn't suggest someone who lives on the other side of town to come out here, but if you are in the richmond, it's definitely the spot.", "author": "Nicole M."}

There is only enough room for six or so tables. There is one chef, a prep, and one waitress/waiter. The food here: Spectacular. There something to be said about cozy intimate places where it feels like you're looking into someone's kitchen instead of being at one of those snazzy Japanese places like Ozumo, where the focus is on something other than the food on your plate. Because of the limited space, and staff, the service is at times slow, but it's definitely not from a lack of effort. In a quest to look for those tiny jewel of a restaurants that are totally local and relies heavily on word of mouth, sometimes it's worth a little sacrifice.", "author": "Eric C."}

Wakame Salad \n    Tender Seaweed with light sauce not too salty or greasy\n2. Gyoza 6pcs\n    Yummm. Most places just cook-up some frozen gyoza.

I love it love it love it\n6. Teriyaki Salmon or Beef\n    Small size with few vegetable. If you looking for big dish you might disappointed.\n    but salmon/ beef is very tender and juicy\n7. California Roll - very nice\n8. Dragon Roll or Caterphiller Roll\n9. Uni - you have to check because they don't always have it, or it sells out fast, but when they do have it its super fresh and delicious.\nTotal $50.00-ish\n\nAlso Miso Ramen/ Spicy Ramen/ Bento/ Don Katsu/ Chicken Teriyaki... But these 9 items i listed above are my favorit and I LOVE IT!!!\n\nYou have to be patient because they cn take some time to make the food. The cook is a serious guy too, so don't bitch about waiting because your gonna get good stuff. If you come between 5 and 6:15 I have seen this to be the best time in terms of getting the food fast.\n\nYou can't take the menu home, and they don't have printed menus, so use your cell phone to take pictures of the menu.\n\nThe atmosphere is a small place, so there is none of this \"Welcome to Chevy's!!\" type of fake excitement. This place is pure Japanese all the way, and you can probably already tell that I think it's one of the best in the city.", "author": "Tony M."}

He loved his too.  I didn't expect much from the sushi since the place has no sushi bar and specializes more in cooked dishes so we only ordered a couple items for appetizers.  It was so good that when we went back we just ordered sushi.  Stick to the specials board and you won't be disappointed by anything.  Service wasn't as slow for us as others have mentioned.

We were seated right away which is always a plus. But, once we ordered it was downhill from there. The waitress mentioned after we ordered that it might be a little wait because they only have one sushi chef. I thought that was totally fine considering the size of this tiny hole in the wall sushi spot. There was only one waitress and one sushi chef and every spot was full (maybe about 5 tables in the whole place). There definitely was a wait! A LONG one! I'm not one to complain because I have a fear of spit in my food, but I was getting close to saying something. (I didn't....I'm too much of a wimp! That's what Yelp is for, so I can share my good or bad experiences!) Once the food finally came I scarfed it down so quickly I forgot to actually taste it. I think it was good.....let's just say it wasn't amazing and it wasn't horrible because I think that would stand out to me. I also didn't get sick so that's another clue that it wasn't bad.
