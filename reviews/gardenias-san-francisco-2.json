There was no line but only bar seating was available as all the tables were reserved. Our waitress quickly took our drink and food orders and it was great. Wine and appetizer came within 10 minutes but then the waiting began. \n\nWe sat there for about 30 minutes drinking our wine and chatting with the waitress returning intermittently telling us it'll just be a few more minutes. By now it was 7:10- still ok. Another 10 minutes and the waitress again tells us it's another few minutes. We've been waiting for 40 min for our food by now and had to leave for the movie so we asked for it to be wrapped up. It probably took them another 5-10 minutes to actually box everything up (which by the way was dripping with oil soon after). \n\nAfter carrying the $60 boxed food to the movie theater and back home, we did actually taste the food and it was fortunately quite delicious. However, the overall experience has left a bad impression and we won't be back anytime soon.", "author": "Joanna H."}

The vibe was very cozy with lots of pretty white string lights decorating the restaurant.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive.\n\nI love brussel sprouts but their brussel sprouts appetizer was a little underwhelming - it was intentionally a  cold, more of a salad-style dish. I prefer warm, crispy, crunchy brussel sprouts.\n\nMy duck leg entree was absolutely mouthwatering! The duck had a great glaze with just the perfect amount of salty and sweet flavors. And the cheesy potato au gratin served on the side was delectable. I only wish I had more than one duck leg to eat!\n\nMinus one star for my boyfriend's steak entree which was riddled with strings of fat.

Everything we had was meh.  The brussel sprouts salad was meh, just a collection of parts, no greater sum.

Great for date night, girls night, or family dinner.\n\nI was a little skeptical with some of the negative reviews, but those reviewers also didn't have a lot of reviews or friends... I'm glad I gave this place a shot, because this place is a hidden gem.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed calamari ($14) - saut\u00e9ed with red bell peppers, fava beans, and lemon slivers, and served with a dollop of creme fraiche.  Tender, flavorful, nice colors.  Get this.\n\nHand-cut garlic-scape pesto papardelle ($14) - perfectly cooked pasta, topped with almond slivers for texture, parmesan and chives.  Pesto is creamy, herby (but not overly herby), and appropriately portioned for the pasta.  Yum.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed steelhead trout ($29) - in a balsamic, brown butter, mustard, and caper sauce.  Served atop wax and French green beans and fingerling potatoes.  The menu doesn't mention mustard, so if you're like me and dislike mustard, be wary--the good thing was that it was just a hint and not present in every bite.  Fish was very well cooked with a bit of pink in the center and crispy skin.  Potatoes were overly cooked with some pieces hard crunchy.  A bit too much brown butter, such that every piece of veggies and potatoes were fully dipped in it.  All in all tasty though, and would get again.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food.  They also have cute tea party-esque plates and silverware which is an added plus.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-05-22", "description": "I wish I could give Gardenias a better review.  \n\nWe decided to try Gardenias for our anniversary dinner. Our reservation was at 7:30 p.m. We showed up five minutes late, but typically a restaurant will hold your reservation for 15 minutes before giving it away, so we weren't worried. The location of G is lovely, tucked away in a tree-covered neighborhood on Sutter. I had actually learned about G from just walking to and from work. \n\nThe food, in my opinion, was spectacular. For starters, we ordered the peas and ricotta on crostini, the calamari, and the beet ravioli - they were all special dishes. The peas and ricotta on crostini was probably my favorite - the flavors worked well together and all of the ingredients were noticeably fresh. The calamari was also outstanding, grilled perfectly and served with a perfect amount of heat, it did not disappoint. The beet ravioli was also lovely, with fresh flavors and parmesan cheese, I could have probably eaten 8 more ravioli by myself (the serving size is 2 ravioli). I asked for bread and butter, which by the way, costs $3.50 (only in San Francisco do you pay for bread and butter). \n\nBefore I continue raving about the food, I want to again note that we had a reservation for two people at 7:30 p.m. Our reservation was not honored, and it was not okay. When we walked in and told the host/server we had a reservation, he said that it would be 20 minutes. What? Why? We could have walked in off the street and waited 20 minutes. Because we were in good moods and didn't want to let this rather large oversight spoil the evening (or our anniversary), we took a seat at the bar (where, we were informed, we could also enjoy dinner), and ordered some beer (beer and wine only) and some starters. Over an hour later, at 8:40 p.m., we still had not been seated at a table. I flagged down our server and asked to speak with the manager, WHICH I NEVER DO. She came over, and when I expressed to her how disappointed I was that our reservation was not honored, she did not seem to care. In fact, she didn't even apologize for making us wait for over an hour for a table despite the fact that we had made the reservation far in advance. She just said it was busy and shrugged. We would have left, but we wondered where we could go with no reservation on a Saturday night in San Francisco. \n\nWe were then seated at a table, finally. The server came up to us and asked if we wanted to order dessert. What? We hadn't even ordered entrees yet. We ordered dinner, which was also incredibly yummy. For him, the short ribs. For me, the pesto fettuccini and the seared scallops (both small plates because I'm indecisive). I loved both of my dishes, and my boyfriend's entr\u00e9e was outrageously tasty. \n\nOur bill came and nothing on the bill was taken care of. I wasn't really looking for G to do that, but it would have been a nice gesture, considering the poor service we received. I don't think I'll be back to G's. It's a shame, because I love the food, but they have got to get their act together. Don't take reservations if you can't handle them. Sad face.", "author": "Sunny S."}

I had the slow cooked duck leg, which was very good.  The other guests had the swordfish and pork chop, both were over cooked.  My friend likes his meat well done, but the pork chop was over cooked even for him  However, the flavors for both were good.  Appetizer was good, the gnocchi, very tasty.   Desserts were good.  I object to paying for bread, at these prices it should be included.  It is rather pricy.  It was $110 per person with wine.", "author": "David F."}

The restaurant even had an outdoor back area.\n\nService: Subpar. We were seated late even though we had reservations, yet the restaurant wasn't full. My water glass was never empty UNTIL towards the end of the meal when our server ghosted and never checked on us again. At the end, when the chef came by and asked how the meal was, I informed her the braised pork was too sweet. She completely ignored my comment, cleaned our table of our dishes, and walked off as if she heard nothing. I even had to question my significant other as to whether I spoke too softly, but he assured me I spoke quite loudly. He even commented on how odd it was that the chef walked off without acknowledging my comment.\n\nFood: First off, bread and butter AREN'T complimentary. First time I've been to a restaurant that charged for that. The amount of bread given isn't even a grandiose amount. However, the bread was quite flavorful and had a nice crunchy exterior complimented by a soft interior. Celery apple soup was delicious and refreshing. Wait time for my entree was longer than I would expect for what it was. I ordered the braised pork and it took about forty minutes. It was incredibly tender, but overly sweet to the point of forcing myself to try to finish the dish so as to not leave the restaurant hungry. It almost tasted like a meat dessert dish. I eventually gave up forcing myself to eat it out of fear I would gag and cough the food back up. Other than the food, the wine list was pretty extensive.

We opted to go with three \"beginnings\" and one entree to try more things. My girlfriend will never order or even eat dishes involving beets...except last night. The Roasted Beet Ravioli was cooked perfectly and the visual of a beet red dumpling was delightful. \nWe followed that with the corn soup (not too sweet, complex) and the calamari (not overcooked, fave pur\u00e9e was crazy good). For our entree, we went with the saut\u00e9ed salmon and it completed the meal. I haven't had much rouille (topping the salmon); its consistently was between a whipped butter and mayonnaise.

My favorite small plate is the braised chicories - lovely crisp prosciutto and bittersweet chicories with enough balsamic to cut through the richness of the dish.

The ambiance nice, though the walkways were a little too cramped due to a dense seating arrangement. The service was also good as well. \n\nProblem was the food was just okay. Certainly a hit on some dishes but a miss for others. \n\nFirst, we ordered bread and butter. Most restaurants I have visited provide bread and butter for free, but here there was a small fee. 4 bucks per roll if I remember correctly. Hey that's fine, I understand. But if you're going to charge for the bread, I would hope that it was hot out of the oven, fresh and soft. It was not.\n\nFor the appetizers, we got the artichokes, and the scallops. Scallops were pretty decent, though not enough actual scallops of course. The artichokes, not great. I'll be honest, I don't love artichokes, but we ordered it based on the waiters recommendation and out of the 4 of us at the table, only my mom liked it (this is probably a generous assessment). \n\nOn to the main courses. I had the duck leg, which was great! I also sampled some of the short rib and the salmon, both tasted excellent as well. The fish was cooked perfectly. These were the highlights of the meal, and I can honestly say that everything was good as far as main courses. \n\nDessert. Not great. We ordered 4 different types. The ice cream was packed with mint flavor-- excessively so in our opinion. The strawberry shortbread was probably the best, but nothing to write home about in any case.\n\nTo sum, great service, great ambiance, and good main dishes. The rest, was mediocre-- at best.", "author": "Kevin W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-19", "description": "Having been to Woodward Gardens, I was thrilled my friend found Gardenias for us to try as part of our Diner's Club. All four of us had a lovely time at dinner -- the ambiance is casual, the service attentive, patient and warm. The food was excellent at times and other plates were less than stellar. That, however, did not detract from the overall joy of the meal with good friends: delightful comfort food, enjoyable service, neighborhood-y spot -- can't ask for much more in SF of 2016, which has changed almost beyond comprehension in the 26 years since I first moved here.\n\nWe had early reservations for a Friday night: 6pm. The restaurant was empty and we were given our choice of table -- a great start! When was the last time you got to pick your seating on a Friday night? We started with bright and creamy castelvetrano olives and each ordered our own glasses of wine. Our server, a sweet Spanish girl, knew the wine list and made good recommendations. We explained that we wanted to try many plates and to share everything -- she assured us that the portion sizes would be just right to do so. Perfect! \n\nThe timing of the food was great -- she would bring 2-3 plates at once and allow us our unhurried taste of this, the passing of that plate, back and forth -- none of this forcing more plates onto an already full tabletop to ensure the table was turned over quickly. In the almost 3 hours we were there, we were never rushed, never ignored. Our server was friendly, knowledgable and warm throughout -- even though the restaurant became very full and very busy within an hour of our arrival. \n\nWe started with the artichoke small plate -- it was fine, but not mind blowing. Maybe it would be better a little later in the season? The vegetables with bagna cauda were \"meh\" for me. The veggies were fresh and good -- tricolor carrots, baby fennel, celery, watermelon radish -- but the bagna cauda was not well blended and so just ended up being dipping oil for fresh veggies. Could have done without either of these small plates.\n\nNow the ricotta raviolo was AH-MAZING! The pasta was made with some type of whole grain -- don't know what it was, maybe spelt? Delicious and hearty on the outside, creamy and melty on the inside. Definitely large enough for all 4 of us to share: each got a huge bite. YUM! We got a blood orange salad to share -- the flavors were there but the blood orange should have been segmented more finely, and the nuts chopped more delicately. This is nitpicky stuff, people! Order it anyway, it was a fine counterpoint to the richness of the raviolo. We ended the small plates with the seared scallops -- a hit! I had imagine 2 large scallops that we'd have to cut into small pieces but we got 5-6 scallops on a delicious bed of lentils. Perfection!\n\nFinally, we ordered 2 entrees to split: The falling-off-the-bone duck leg and the savory-sweet-fennel-y short ribs. I could eat those short ribs for days! Both entrees were hearty, flavorful and really hit the spot for a chilly spring evening! \n\nWe were satiated but still ordered dessert because it's our custom. Our server encouraged us to get the strawberry tart -- caramelized, brown butter, I don't know -- but it was such an amazing end to a wonderful meal! We also had an olive oil cake -- great but the strawberry tart had it beat.\n\nIf you've read this far into my too-long review, you're messing up & not making reservations to Gardenias right now. Do a date night, go with a small group of friends, take your parents....heck, go by yourself. But do yourself a favor and enjoy this friendly food -- your soul will be pleased.", "author": "Yasi S."}

He was sad when it closed, but so happy when he got wind of the new spot and concept.  So, we were dying to go.\n\nI did some sleuthing about when it was finally LIVE.  They are only open right now Thurs-Mon for dinner, with a last seating at 8pm, so we took a Monday 8pm spot via Opentable.  The patio looks great, but they are still waiting on the permit for it so, stay tuned.\n\nThe space is sleek and clean, with tables and a lovely eat at counter.  Lots of walk in opportunities.  We had a table with our reservation, but opted for the counter as it is my old man's preference.  It wasn't too crowded, so we were able to chat with the staff and have some fun.  It feels like a place where that will be the norm, even when it is slammed.\n\nOnce seated, Margie came over and brought us menus.  The food is always going to change based on availability, but there are a few staples.  We started with the cucumber gazpacho and a seasonal veggie plate.  The gazpacho was mine, and lovely.  It was a punch of cucumber flavor, with some kick (jalapeno), and these great radish bits too cool off the heat.  The old man had the veggies, but kindly shared them - they were earthy and fresh, and such a warm (as in comforting) way to start our meals.  Dinner was: the wheat berry risotto for him and the braised short ribs for me.  I sadly forgot to try his, but he said it was creamy, filling and yet still light.  My ribs were beautiful cooked and seasoned, but the polenta they were on: I wanted to bathe in it.  It was a different texture than most, but it complemented the ribs perfectly, and the flavor off the charts.\n\nWe were more than full - the portions are what I would call perfect, not tiny waif-like, but not middle-american gluttonous.  But, early in the meal, I saw the olive oil cake go by, so that was happening.  My olive oil cake was really special.  All the lightness and texture that such cakes are marked by, and none of the over-powering nuttiness they can have in less skilled hands.  The old man got the chocolate raspberry tart, and it was so delicate.  The chocolate is an underneath lawyer, so I forgot it was there until I bit into it, and it balanced the raspberry tartness perfectly.  \n\nThe whole meal set us back about $86 (and I had wine), which in SF for 3 courses x 2 people plus wine for me, is really quite a treat.  The old man is already set for dessert date there this week, and dinner next.  So, that should tell you it is up to snuff.  \n\nAnd, though I never went to Woodward's Garden, I could appreciate very easily and straight away why people love Margie so much, and why the place had so many loyal folks.  When we were there, she was all about the place, doing everything from clearing plates to giving advice.  She told us how much she loved the new spot, and how happy she is; I think that comes through pretty clearly with everything we enjoyed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-09-13", "description": "I have never felt compelled to write a restaurant review until now.  My best hope is that the owners take note...if they want this place to survive.  NB: I have worked in restaurants and I am always willing to give the benefit of the doubt and am so very rarely not willing to tip at least 20%.\n\nBeginning with the positive: the space is adorable and the Nebbiolo on tap and the gazpacho were delicious.  \n\nNow, on to the sad remainder of the review.  We sat at the chef's counter.  Point #1: if you expose your kitchen to your customers you **MUST** have your sh*t together.  Otherwise it is like dining at your friends' house, as they teeter on the brink of divorce.\n\nOur first server was a sweet french(?) girl who unknowingly traded off duties with another server who looked less than thrilled to be there.  They were the only two designated servers, but there was someone who appeared to be ab expediter who was also on the floor.  Two line cooks were behind the bar and communication among all parties was a hot mess.  Our gazpacho came in a timely fashion, and like I said, it was delicious.\n\nOur two small plates, crudite and little gems salad seemed to be taking an awfully long time so server #1 checked in, saying they were on their way.  After another 15 minutes and checking with server #2, the little gems that we saw sitting on the counter for 20 minutes arrived to us, along with the vegetables.  Meanwhile, we could SEE that our entrees had been fired and were ready to be served at that time, so off to the heating rack they went, to dry out for 10 minutes.  \n\nIn a hurried frenzy the small plates were cleared and our mains were there, hot hot plates and all.  I had the pork shoulder which had dried out a bit after sitting around.  My husband had the guinea hen, which we both thought would be an actual guinea hen.  Maybe it was 1/3 of a guinea hen, which is like, 2 bites.  And it was accompanied by 1.5 halves of potatoes.  Not worth $27.\n\nI get it.  Accidents happen.  But the couple next to us seemed to have a similar issue.  The owners are restaurant veterans, so I have a hard time seeing how they can let their establishment run like this on a Saturday night.  And like I said, if your kitchen is visible to your customers, don't mess up, and if you do, re-fire those mains and fix your mistakes.  And don't let your customers see the eye-rolling, the huffing and puffing, the stress, and the discord.  It's just not pleasant.  AND if you mess up, comp SOMETHING.  ANYTHING.  Acknowledge that you're having a bad night, and make it right!", "author": "alexis r."}

The current menu could use a few tweaks, as could the service which was extremely friendly if a bit harried.  \nTwo of us had five items of varying sizes and while everything was delicious, it was a bit one note.  Again, I'll stress that we enjoyed all of it (though didn't finish any of the larger items).  I just wish there was a bit of variation in flavors and some lighter options.  The current menu (not the one on the website) is on the heavier side with a very fall/winter feel to it.  I greatly appreciate seasonality, but a little acid somewhere in our meal would have gone a long way.  \nI am currently eating my leftover squash crepes for breakfast and I feel exactly the same as when I had them for dinner - delicious but just a little too heavy and sweet.  And there is something in the flavoring that is very similar to the celery/parsley soup and the short ribs. \nI'd like some heavier wines to cut through the current menu - they were much too light for the current food offerings, though tasty and reasonably priced.\nI will definitely go back to Gardenias though I might wait for Spring....", "author": "Ellen H."}

We had been at the other restaurant they owned in the Mission (Woodward) and loved the experience. I cannot say the same of this new place. \n\nFood was average and overpriced for what you get. Service was sloooow. Waiter was rude and crude. They threw the $14 cheese plate on the table w/o even introducing the cheeses. Well I guess because there was not much to introduce on the plate. Two small piece of ordinary cheese on a plate!\n\nI had the corn hen. Actually 1/2 for $24. I could have eaten it in two bites. It was dry too!\n\nOur table neighbors ended up leaving before they even started. They said they felt they were pressed and waiter (the blonde lady who seems to be one of the two owners) was too rude.\n\n\nWell ...too bad. We hoped this would become our around the corner favorite restaurant. \nI really hope the two owners get in the spirit of this neighborhood and start being nice and connecting with the people!", "author": "Antonella O."}

The room was spacious with clean lines, and much less noisy than most S.F. restaurants.\n\nMy dinner started with grilled asparagus with prosciutto and a bit of chopped hard-boiled egg.  The asparagus was still warm, but crisp and delicious, as was the entire dish.  For my main course I had grilled salmon on a bed of roasted potatoes, leeks, and spinach.  Once again, the fish was perfectly grilled, the ingredients worked well together, and the amount was generous.  For dessert I had their mission fig tart with whipped cream and a blackberry sauce -- to die for.  One of my companions had pork for her main course, the other had their risotto; and both loved their dinners.\n\nTo top it all off, the service was attentively provided by a young Spanish woman; and the prices, we thought, were quite reasonable by S.F. standards.  All three of us promised our friendly server that we'd by back to Gardenias soon.", "author": "Gerald W."}

The menu is fantastic, with many vegetarian options. (There are items like short ribs as well.) I don't know anything about the chef, but from appetizer to dessert there were new combinations of flavors which made this a meal to remember. Great wine list, and the service was spot-on.

Personally, I am not a picky person and typically have an open mind for when bad things happen but it was hard to leave here being satisfied. First of all, we had a reservation that has been called in advance by a few days at 8pm. I arrived exactly at that time and was the first in my party to arrive so by then they just started setting our table. However, by 8:35 my whole party has been there now and still was not seated. The waiters did come up to us to apologize for our wait and explained that the prior party at our table is taking a longer time than thought but what I didn't understand was that all around us there were tables empty that could've easily been filled by my party. Anyways, we were settled in our seats by 8:45 and I was hungry. Not going to lie, after all that waiting, I was hoping my party would get a little more attention from the workers the rest of our visit. However, it took us some flagging down of the waiter to even order our meal and that just added on more time for the wait. By now my thoughts on the service was going down but I was still excited to see how the food would be. We ordered the beet ravioli to share which I will say is very good and for my entree I ordered the $18 risotto. After really testing my patience, I once again felt like I had to test it more since the entrees took some time to come out as well. Once my risotto did come out, I was definitely not pleased. I know I'm not a master chef or anything but I know better that risotto is not supposed to be soaked in the water it's cooked in and should be of a more sticky consistency. Each scoop on my spoon was filled with soup or broth, and then some mushy rice. Flavor was good but I am very sure this isn't how an $18 dish should be. By the end of the night, I was left dissatisfied by the service and my entree :(", "author": "Erika Joy O."}

Stopped by on a whim this weekend and was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was cozy, the service was attentive, and the courses were well-timed. Environment = 4 stars. The food was good, but there were some hits & misses. The braised leeks were delicious and I'd also recommend the duck leg for a hearty main course. The calamari dish has got to go though. It was very disjointed -- a plate of sauteed calamari thrown on a bed of shredded lettuce, with a couple shishito peppers on the side and a huge portion of aioli on top. It was messy and the flavors didn't work together. The brussels sprout salad was a rec from the waitress but was both lacking a bit in flavor and overly salty at the same time. Food = 3.

Our waitress was a sweet young woman who not only offered me a taste of multiple wines when i had trouble deciding (on a glass, mind you, not a bottle), she emphasized that there was no pressure to order any of them. I settled on a lovely Barbera. We had the gnocchi starter- housemade, airy, slightly crisp on the outside, with fresh sweet snap peas, a hearty and flavorful white bean soup, and then we shared the short ribs with polenta. Everything was cooked to perfection, presented beautifully, and well-proportioned. The ambiance is romantic and cozy. This place is the antidote to overcrowded, over-hyped, overpriced downtown restaurants.

We had signed our check around 8PM when a different waiter came up to ask us to finish our time up at the counter.  I had less than half a glass of wine left, there were open tables, almost all of the counter stools were available and there was no one at the front waiting.  Not sure why after a $160 meal that lasted less than an hour and a half on a Wednesday I'd be asked to give up my seat for presumably no one especially when there had been tables there before us that were still lingering after we were asked to move.

We stopped by without reservations on a saturday night after a film. We were seated at the counter which was very comfortable and allowed us to watch the kitchen. Everything we ordered was fantastic. The raviolo with roasted persimmon and the greens wrapped in prosciutto were both outstanding. I had the short ribs and my partner had the game hen. He kept making happy sounds with each bite. My short ribs were the best rendition I have had of that dish in years. The wine list is very interesting and offered us the opportunity to have wines we had never heard of. We picked a red from Northern Italy near the boarder with Germany. It was great. The orange cake was a little sweet for my taste so I was glad to be splitting it.
