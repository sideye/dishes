I mean 2 stars. I'm not sure if it's because they are right by the warf and most of the patrons are tourists or if it's just the culture of this neighborhood but the employees seemed very unhappy with their choice in where to work. No smiles, no politeness. \n\nThey messed up my drink in that the cashier thought I wanted it hot when I asked for iced. The barista offered no emotion when I asked them to remake it, no advice offered on the best way to handle said situation and clearly wanted to be somewhere else. \n\nThe ambiance is pretty cool though. It's small inside. I think there are 5-6 tables inside and none outside. It was pretty busy but the vibe of the neighborhood was cool and I'd bet this place would make a great place for people watching. \n\nAlso somehow they did manage to make my drink to perfection. Much better than my local starbs in LA. \n\nSo I'd say if you want a really well made coffee, come here but get in and get out fast and don't expect them to remember you even if you come here every day.", "author": "Fazil A."}

Tickets get lost, no one is responsive when you nicely ask if your drink is coming up (totally understand you're busy but so am I and I've been waiting for 25 mins AND multiple people who came in after me are getting theirs)... most of the people who work there are rude and seem like they have no idea what they're doing. For such a high-traffic place you'd think they'd train at other stores and then allow employees to work at this one. \n\nAlso ordered a drink today with no whip, it came out half filled with a ton of whipped cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-26", "description": "During a whirlwind weekend trip to San Fran, we stopped at this Starbucks in the midst of our sightseeing and tourist activities to recharge ... literally. This larger store had lots of places to lounge, so my friend and I sat in two of the larger chairs that were located next to outlets and recharged our phones. We were also super thirsty so we got two Venti waters.\n \nThis Starbucks detour ended up being a blessing in disguise, though. I have a collection of Starbucks gift cards from different cities, and I ended up finding the San Francisco-specific gift card at this store. I was also able to find a cute SF Starbucks mug (I have a growing collection of the \"You are Here\" mugs as well). It was a nice place to stop and rest for 30 minutes before we continued on our city adventures.\n \nThis Starbucks store was pretty clean, well lit and organized, and the employees were really friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to revisit.\n \nEven though we didn't order any coffee during this visit, here are some of my usual orders: \n \nIced/Hot Caramel Macchiato: This is my go-to drink at any Starbucks. It features vanilla-flavored syrup combined with full-bodied espresso, milk and ice. I usually get the iced version and ask for light ice, and I order it with soy milk and asked for it stirred (instead of layered). If the weather is chilly, I order this drink hot, but more often than not, I get it iced because it tastes more refreshing and I enjoy the creamy taste of milk and the caramel drizzle. Getting this drink hot is just as comforting, and I often drink it slower to savor the slightly smoky taste and the hot, rich caramel. During this Starbucks visit, it was winter and colder outside, so given the option, I would have ordered this drink hot. \n \nChocolate Chunk Cookie: This is one of my favorite Starbucks snacks and it's usually in stock during my visits. I like these cookies because they're soft and chewy - I love softer cookies over crispy, crunchy cookies. And, they don't skimp on the chocolate; each sports a good amount of chocolate chunks in each. \n \nCake Pops: Yeah, although cake pops can be gone in 1-2 bites, they're the perfect little bits of bite-sized bliss if you're trying to stave off hunger or just need a pick me up! The chocolate chip cookie dough flavor is my favorite because it reminds me of my favorite ice cream flavor ... and there's lots of chocolate chips in here.", "author": "Kelli S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-18", "description": "Let me start by saying if there was a negative star system, that's what this location deserves. Without question, this is the worst Starbucks staff I've ever seen. Note to store manager, you may want to stop hiring children to to run your store. Not necessarily age, but they are poorly trained and have ZERO respect for customers. My last and final visit to this store went like this...... was charged for 3 drinks when I only ordered 2. When I politely asked why my total was so high, Matthew seemed extremely annoyed that I was questioning him. When he realized his error, he rudely said to insert my card into the machine to get refunded. At no time did he apologize for his error. Our drinks were called out and we didn't receive any kind of greeting such as a simple \"thank you\". Finally and the most disturbing part of our experience happened as my daughter and I were finished preparing our drinks at the condiment bar and were walking towards the exit.  Wayland, I believe was his name, made a loud comment for us and the entire dining room to hear \"thanks for making a mess in our store\". At this point, this comment was enough to push me over the edge to reply with a comment back to him. We did not leave a mess. With the way the condiment bar is designed now, you have to throw the trash through the front instead of the top. A few sugar packets apparently fell on the floor. Regardless, isn't it the partners job to ensure the store is kept clean? Which on most of my visits, this store is not kept very clean. As I was explaining this to him, he walked up on me with my daughter standing next to me like he wanted to have a confrontation. I asked him \" are you walking up on me?\"  Threatening me..., really?? He quickly took a step back and just looked at me. By this time the shift supervisor, Kevin, walked up to me and said \" I\"ll talk with him, now get out\". NEVER have I had such a horrible experience.

Is getting everything stocked and the drink orders so important that we forget the service part of customer satisfaction, which - more than getting the drinks and orders correct - includes the happiness of your clients and having a clean place to walk into, and having a clean table to put your stuff on, instead of typically having to grab a bunch of napkins and spending 4.2mins to clean your own table?\n\nbleh......\n\nTo add to it, in the 35 mins I was there, I couldn't connect at all to the wifi.

They are also not good at stocking their condiments, napkins, or cleaning the restroom.

There's nothing else nice to say.  But please don't close this store -- was this one of the 600?  If it is, please put a Peet's here next.", "author": "Patty W."}

I work right nearby and have several choices as to where to go for coffee in this area, but I have been more pleased with the service here.  Maybe the people working there are excited about their super clean and new location right next to the cable car turnabouts and it comes out in their personality.  \n\nNot too much seating around this place but there is this cool little bar area that was set up where you can sit on stools and watch all the coffee magic that happens behind the scenes.  I usually lean towards going to neighborhood coffee places, but in the 15 minute break I am allowed to walk somewhere close, this is my new choice.", "author": "Julie C."}

Sorry, some people like hot, like me. After waiting for them to make the drink and then after they asked me to return it to make another, I politely declined and said I would place the drink in the microwave when I got home. And they were perfectly fine with that. No decent coffee house would ever be ok with me microwaving their drink, but then again, this is just Starbucks. No high expectations here.", "author": "Stephanie J."}

And the employees can't help it they work at a crappy, tourist-filled location (right at the end of a cable car line... In Fisherman's wharf... Ugh!).\n\nHere's why I hate this Starbucks.  Multiple times, I've walked out because the service was so slow (example: barista comes to first person in line who is standing with her friend; takes drink order; makes single drink; returns with drink; asks friend what SHE would like to drink; goes to bar to make second drink.  As the person 5th in line, I rapidly deduced I was going to be trapped in that green and black hell for another 5 minutes minimum, and I was already late to class).  Multiple times I've decided against my espresso drink, and changed my order to black coffee or tea predicated on my estimate of how long it would take to make the former.\n\nBut here is the mother of all anecdotes for why, under threat of serious suffering from caffeine withdrawal, I will never again enter this coffee shop: 9:50 on Sunday morning.  Three visible employees.  Seven people in line.  One employee decides it's more important to stock paper towels in the bathroom than get through the line (first rule in counter service: take their money before they can walk out; where was their manager!?).  After changing my order to tea (for efficiency), I got to the counter with one of their floofy salad things and the intention of buying a pastry.  I pay for my tea, salad, and pastry, and after handing the woman $9, she bids me  \"Have a nice day!\" without my Classic Old Fashioned Doughnut (the only real reason I go to S***bucks in the first place).  I remind her gently re: pastry, and she turns to get it.  In the meantime, the drink was ready for the customer behind me, and the fellow barista rang the order into the register.  Register Girl, who clearly should have had a V-8, hands me my snack, and as I turn to walk away, says, \"Um, MISS?  You need to pay for that.\"\n\nReally?  And to think I tipped her a bill, not just the handful of nickels in my pocket.\n\nI have a theory: the high quantity of confused tourists who enter that location in the first place have a \"rubbing off\" effect on the staff, making them more confused (slow?) than they would be otherwise.\n\nHaving worked in \"the industry,\" I'm more willing than most to give the person behind the counter the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe that's why I had kept going back to this location.  It's a good Starbucks for the same reason any Starbucks is good: it's convenient, it distributes caffeine, and it's generally consistent.  But a good Starbucks is also efficient as hell, and this one just is not.  \n\nFor the time being they have officially lost me as a customer, which is sad because I always tip in bills, and I am NEVER rude to a counter person.", "author": "Liesl B."}
