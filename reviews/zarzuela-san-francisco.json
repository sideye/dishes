I had really high expectations for this place because of the yelp reviews! I'm starting to not trust yelp with all these false high ratings for restaurants!!! \n\nWe ended up getting vermicelli seafood with white wine, pork medallions, and the empanadas. Pork medallions tasted like it was microwaved and overcooked. There was really no flavor. The vermicelli seafood came with three or four mussels some calamari, small pieces of fish and shrimp. It was ok, something I could've made at home and I was very unimpressed. The empanadas... meh. It was Soggy and tasteless. \n\nCompared to other restaurants, I've had way better.

My friend Adna Y. recommended this place, and you have to understand i had my doubts before i arrived.  Not because I don't trust her, well maybe not completely, but she does usually pick a place we don't all like.  But times have change and know i call her \"Oh wise one\".  This place was the jackpot \n\nWe arrived fabulously late as our other friends were waiting.  The host wasn't going to seat us until the whole party arrived, which i understand.  Upon entering this dimly lit restaurant I notice there are different types of customers here.  You have families, couples, friends and people here on a first date. So far I'm loving the ambiance.  \n\nWe started out with two tapas \nMejillones Al Azafran - which was the Mussels sauteed in white wine, garlic, tomatoes, onions & saffron.  This was cooked well, and the sauce went perfectly with the mussels, it didn't over power the flavor which was good. I actually don't even like mussels but this turned out to be well liked by all the people in m party. \n\nCalamares A La Plancha Con Aioli which was Grilled squid with aioli.   I really need to stop sharing food with my friends. It just breaks my heart to see such good food go into other people's stomach.  This was by far my favorite dish of the night.  The octopus and the squid went so well with a the Aioli sauce,   It was very creamy and a a perfect pinch of sweetness to it.  You can feel that it was cooked with love.  I fell in love with this dish.  \n\nFor my entree i got the \nCostillas Breseadas A La Cerveza which was the Short ribs braised with beer, onions, garlic and tomatoes .  This came with mashed potatoes, and the ribs was so tender I didn't even need a knife.    \n\nyou can also get the dish for couples, for the price of 36.00 it's not bad.  It's paella with mussels and calms.  \n\nI would totally come back here, but i have to admit parking was hard.  I would recommend taking a Taxi here if you want to avoid trying to find parking.  You have to get the Sangria here no matter what. It was so good and its freshly made at their restaurant.  I'll be back!", "author": "Belinda C."}

This restaurant is nestled in the middle of Russian Hill (Union and Hyde) and just serves great tapas.\n\nMy friend and I ordered a couple of the specials (fried smelt and padron peppers) as well as the dates, shrimps, octopus, squid, paella and the crema catalana. In short, it was way too much food but we wanted to try everything (I ended up taking a doggy bag home).  Everything was on point. The octopus was the house specialty and I really enjoyed that. The paella was cooked perfectly (not sure if this is the best I've had but it's up there).  To me, the most special tapas was the fried smelt.  I wouldn't hesitate ordering the same items the next time I'm here. \n\nEverything here is nice and rustic.  The restaurant itself and the music they play literally makes you feel like you are in Spain (and I've been).  The service was nice and attentive. The above meal plus a glass of wine including tax and tip costs about $80 per person - it's about what you would expect to spend to eat a nice dinner in SF these days.

Zarzuela didn't disappoint.\n\nUpon ordering the paella (and reading the menu), you're warned the paella is made fresh, for you, and that it'll take 30 minutes to cook. Not a problem for me (I'll wait that long for some good food).  For starters, we dined on the complimentary bread and olive oil for a bit before ordering dates wrapped in pancetta (they are a definite must try here).\n\nThe paella was cooked to perfection!  The rice was moist and soft, yet not turned to mush.  The seafood mixed in was all tender (clams and shrimp tend to get rubbery when over cooked). The saffron was used to perfection: giving the rice it's golden yellow hue and slight floral like scent which came through the brine smell of the seafood.  It was a pleasure to devour. \n\nA warning: online, the paella is listed at $17.00.  That must be a lunch price or something, because when you're in the restaurant at dinner time, there is no other option than the $36.00, serves two, option.  \n\nUltimately, the food was amazing.  The service left a little to be desired (our waiter seemed a bit to pretentious for me, and hated the fact that our group wanted to split the check, and refused to split it more than four ways). When asked about some of the menu items, he seemed overly bothered that we didn't know about the dishes. So, four stars was almost three for that reason, yet might have been five if he was nicer.", "author": "Rafael A."}

That was pretty accurate and we ended up getting seated a little before 8. In the process of waiting, I did notice all the smaller groups of 2-4 people got seated much more quickly, so I would recommend coming here with 4 or less people to get seated faster.\n\nThere is a main dining area where the tables are placed very close together and I can imagine would make for a loud dining experience, but luckily we were seated in the back where it was much quieter.\n\nTwo people in our group weren't too hungry so they did their own thing while the three of us split a couple tapas family style. We ordered;\n\nCroquetas de jamon y pollo ($7.25) - ham and chicken croquettes. I love getting croquettes at tapas spots and these really hit the spot \n\nGambas ajillo ($9.25) - shrimp sauteed in garlic and olive oil. The garlic flavor was strong so I'd recommend ordering this dish if you like the combination of shrimp and garlic\n\nPulpo a la gallega ($17.95) - poached octopus and potatoes. Zarzuela is known for this dish (there's even a framed SF Chronicle article about Zarzuela by Michael Bauer in the waiting area that specifically calls out this dish) so I definitely knew we had to order it. It did not disappoint as the octopus was some of the most tender I've ever had\n\nPaella a la valenciana ($36) - Spanish rice cooked with seafood, chicken, and vegetables. Serves two according to the menu. I love paella, and after many disappointing encounters with paella dishes in the city, I am happy to report that the paella here is legit and has the saffron infused flavor I expect from this dish. There was a generous amount of seafood and chicken as well. By the end of the meal I was super stuffed but still coludn't help picking away at the rice in the paella because it was so good!!\n\nI would be remiss to not mention the amazing service we received in my review. I forgot the name of our server, but he was very attentive and accommodated all of our requests with a smile on his face. He was very knowledgeable about the menu; almost everything we ordered was on his recommendation and none of the dishes disappointed. In addition my friend asked for a wine recommendation from him and loved the wine he selected, so he knows his wines as well.\n\nParking is all along the street, and on a busy Friday/Saturday night is hard to find.

There's plates with nice patterns hanging on the walls and the tables have white table clothes. Basically Spain. Also a painting of a bull with a few arrows sticking out of it. TBH, bull fighting is more barbaric than most people think. First they tie the genitals of the bull and then stick with some colorful arrows. Next they release the bull into a ring with some colorfully dressed bro who waves a large cape at it. Sometimes the bull gets the guy which honestly is ok by me. They deserve it. But mostly the bulls runs around at the cape with a bunch of people screaming and yelling because it's a big deal. At the end, they kill the bull with a sword. Like I said, barbaric. Never really will understand bull fighting. Or the NFL for that matter.\n\nAside from that, this place is great. Highly recommend it. It's not too expensive (most plates are under $10).

You'll find yourself in a quiet little neighborhood where Zarzuela's historic, worn look fits in perfectly. Inside, the tables are packed tightly; I was seated right next to the host podium. I arrived around 7 on a Friday and was seated immediately, but after another 15 minutes we noticed that more people started arriving and were given wait times of 30-45 minutes. \n\nWe ordered the house sangria, seafood paella, which is supposed to feed a minimum of 2 people, and the chorizo (sausages in wine sauce). We were also given bread, olives, and dipping oil while we waited. The sangria was good, though I didn't think it was spectacular. Sausages were the same, although we had fun dipping our bread in the wine sauce after we were done with them. I mean, they're sausages, which are basically a level above hot dogs. How fancy can you get?\n\nThe paella is where these 4 stars come from. It was a steaming feast within a cast-iron pan. I turned the rice over, and it belched these huge puffs of steam. There was a riot of colors from the shrimp, clams, chicken, etc. And the best part is scraping the crunchier rice that sticks to the bottom of the pan. So good. Of course, ordering this means that I didn't really get the \"tapas experience,\" but I feel like I got enough variety out of this single dish. I wouldn't have it any other way.", "author": "Sophie W."}

YES YES YES!\n\nI have passed by this place so many times and its just a few steps from the fabulous Missing Sock laundry as well (great place for a bite while you are washing and drying!)\n\nWhat a sparkling gem of a place this is--tapas at it's finest!\n\nWe sampled the pie of the day, warmed goat cheese and tomato sauce, prawns in garlic and lemon plus the waiter brought the most delightfully briny olives to the table with soft bread and I had initially written the bread off as lackluster--but it was the absolute best choice to enjoy the flavorful sauces from each selection. \n\nLet's talk pie for a moment. The filing of choice was warmed vegetables and while I felt I was playing roulette with something so broadly described, my dining companion and I chose to go for it. Rewarded we were!! A well orchestrated blend of eggplant, zucchini, onion and savory spice baked into a hearty-but not heavy-crust. \n\nThe large, in shell prawns were brought out on a plate where they encircled roasted garlic green beans--an unexpected delight. I am not a person who normally goes out of my way for green beans...but these, I surely would!!\n\nI could make a lovely, comfort food meal from the warmed goat cheese and the soft bread! FLAVOR FLAVOR FLAVOR. I was already a huge fan of goat cheese, this is Olympic class excellent!\n\nThe space is small and feels almost as if someone chose to invite people over and cobble together seating for a communal celebration--not a crowded restaurant. The conversations around were a low hum, in a pleasant and comforting way. The atmosphere is intimate and very personal, a bit magical. And then, the (presumably) owner drew our attention to three celebrations taking place in the room. A special birthday, a milestone even and a special guest--each presented with a dessert and then he broke into a cappella singing that was in a rich, well trained and confident tenor. While I am on the record of NOT being a fan of unaccompanied singing or of foreign music in general...I found myself hoping he'd sing a little longer in his native tongue when it ended. It truly was as if we'd stopped at a family estate for the harvest and were all being feted for the evening! \n\nThe wonderful evening spent there made me wish for a night out with my actual family there to recreate even half of the delight I experienced!

Sit in the back if you can. More room and more privacy. \n\nThe staff was super attentive and the food came quickly. We order the coquettas, squid, empanada, and all came out super quick and was absolutely delicious! But the star is the seafood paella served for two.

The server took our drink order and asked if we were planning on ordering paella, so that he could put the order in for that first to make sure it would come out on time. He was very enthusiastic about explaining the difference between the two options for paella: One had only shellfish, in a more soupy, risotto-like style (though he offered to add chicken in too if we wanted), and the other was a more traditional style paella with crispy rice and both chicken and seafood. We went with the traditional.\n\nWhat we ended up ordering:\n- Complimentary olives and bread with olive oil: Probably the most olives I've received anywhere for free. If you love olives, this will be a huge plus. Bread wasn't warm, but still tasted fresh and was very good with the fragrant olive oil.\n- Sangria: Loved this. Deceptively fruity, but we definitely felt the buzz after a while.\n- Grilled squid with aioli: Super fresh, cooked well, and that garlic aioli was amazing. Once we finished the squid, we ended up soaking the bread in the sauce too.\n- Patatas Bravas: Classic option and probably the least memorable, but still very good. Can't really go wrong with this.\n- Paella a la Valenciana: Great flavors and plenty of chicken and seafood. Once we reached the bottom, we had trouble scraping off the crispy rice at the bottom of the pan (noobs), and the server was happy to help and scrape all of it onto our plates for us. We had enjoyed all of it already, but that crispy rice was the best part!\n- Shrimp saut\u00e9ed in garlic and olive oil: Very heavy on the garlic, in a great way. Another great hot tapas dish. We ordered this as the kitchen was closing, but they still made it for us. Greatly appreciated!\n\nOverall, it was a great meal, with the enthusiastic and friendly service being a huge plus.

Also ordered a bottle of white wine from Galicia.\n\nWell, the pulpo though pricey was very tender and tasty and were paired up with sliced potatoes.  We'd ordered a racion in Madrid of this same dish and it tasted basically the same.  The boquerones were served with a bit of baby greens which was great to break up the saltiness of the anchovies.  The mussels were disappointing:  Very small to tiny (read 'baby' sized which frankly should have been tossed and replaced). The zarzuela I expected more in quantity for the price charged ($21.50).  It was more like the Italian zuppa di pesce.  Very similar but it was quite tasty just not much seafood.  The gambas (shrimp) were pretty small sized, however, the sauce was fantastic & flavorful like the zarzuela.  The paella was just okay.  Again they don't use prawns but shrimp.  And there was hardly any chicken save a few tiny chunks; the mussels again were tiny and just so so.  \n\nDesserts of arroz con leche & crema catalana were pretty good.\n\nWhat was obtrusive & rude was the busboy who continually tried to hurry us.  He grabbed our son's saucer although he was still using it, he grabbed the olive oil although we were still using it for our bread, etc.  \n\nBut overall we prefer Alegrias for their paellas & also for the intimate type of atmosphere.", "author": "Luisa T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-21", "description": "Got here around 6:45pm on a Saturday and they told us an hour wait, but we only waited about 40 minutes. It wasn't too bad, since there's a lot of room to sit and wait. We ordered their famous sangria and the waiter brought it directly to us in the waiting area. The carafe was only $20 and was enough for all four of us to have about 2 glasses worth. I'm not usually a sangria fan--in fact, I don't like. But upon drinking the sangria at Zarzuela, I'm a fan! I even had a couple glasses. It didn't taste too fake or too fruity. It tasted like how sangria should taste--the best I've ever had.\n\nIf you've never been to a tapas restaurant before, it's like family style small-plate Spanish food. This place is about as genuine as you're going to get. \n\nThe food was either hit or miss, with only a couple of misses. The lobster brisk was a little too fishy, but palpable. But the seafood paella was definitely the worst dish. The clams were really sandy and extremely tide-pool-y. The rice was the best part of it, but when it's your signature dish, I expect it to taste signature--or at least good.\n\nThe highlights included the jamon serrano and the datiles rellenos--which was addicting, but definitely more of a dessert. I also liked the eggplant stuffed with goat cheese a lot, which may be too cheesy for those who don't typically like cheese. The calamari a la pancha was good, but don't be surprised if it's a little different than your traditional American calamari.\n\nMost dishes were between $7 and $10, with the exception of the paella (worst dish) which was $17 per person! And although they don't all come with a ton of food, the quality is really good. I'd say, including drinks, you could comfortably leave there at around $25-$30 a person. Especially if you don't get the paella.\n\nService was very good as well. Our food came out promptly and the waiter was extremely personable and accommodating.\n\nZarzuela isn't the best tapas place that I've ever been to, but it's definitely excellent for the price. You just have to know what to order and what you're going to like! Would definitely go back.", "author": "Ashley F."}

My favorites were the croquetas, papas bravas, and mussels, but I'm sure you can't go wrong with any dish.\n\nThe servers were very friendly and, based on how crowded the restaurant was, were very quick!\n\nZarzuela is very affordable.

We were waiting for half an hour to get to sit down (actually we are lucky and usually it takes longer time. So come here early like when it's open). We ordered 5 different tapas including baked snails, crab cakes, tortillas, a cheese plate and goat cheese wrapped by eggplant. I was already full before they delivered crab cakes. We ordered flan as the dessert. All food taste very good but I don't have one that I would say amazing. Will try something else next time.", "author": "Luk C."}

It's a four star for the items we ordered but the other choices seemed less appealing.\n\nFor starters, the grilled mixed mushrooms were fantastically flavorful!

Everything in it blended very well with each other. He rice is a bit soaked if you prefer the harder texture, but I like the rice to be a bit more cooked so this was awesome.\n\nHighly recommend the chocolate sponge cake and mousse soaked in espresso and bourbon (or some other alcohol?)

I'd heard great things about Zarzuela and the food was really good, but not a stand-out.  I tend to get similar dishes at tapas bars so I end up comparing.  The gambas al ajillo was good - tons of garlic and olive oil, though I thought it needed salt.  The chorizo was good, but didn't seem to be Spanish chorizo.  It was still very tasty but wasn't what I was expecting.  The lamb chops with rosemary and garlic were served with mashed potatoes and was really good (that one was my favorite).  I had a rioja which was typical Spanish and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nThe location - the Russian Hill neighborhood - is great.   It's a 15-20 walk from Fisherman's Wharf, so I'd suggest anyone at the Wharf skip the tourist food there and head up the hill to this place.  Definitely worth the walk and you won't go wrong.\n\nSide note:  I made the mistake of not doublechecking the opening time, so I arrived at 5 pm when they opened at 5:30.  There was a small line of people waiting, so the place definitely has a good reputation.", "author": "Marcus P."}

It was both our first time there. We knew they didn't take ressies, so we went a bit early on a Sat. evening....like 6:30pm. Lucky us! Not only did we score rock-star parking across the street, we also we seated at the last available table upon entering the restaurant. \n\nOur waiter was an older gentleman and he was amazing! He was charismatic and extremely friendly. First, we ordered a pitcher of sangria...a must. Second, we knew we wanted the paella. They portion and charge per person. Bf said he was feeling adventurous, so we ordered the poached octopus over potatoes. We were planning on ordering more, but the waiter said this would be enough food and that he wanted us to save room for the paella. That was a very good suggestion bc in the end, he was right! \n\nThe octopus was so tender and delicious. The serving size was actually quite large for a tapa, but we gladly polished it off with delight. When the paella came out, it looked so beautiful...the colors and textures.....and the aroma just so wonderful! Of course, it was yummy! For two people? It was a lot! However, we were still able to finish the whole thing...damn, we're oinkers! At that point we were really full and had no room for dessert whatsoever. We weren't even able to finish our pitcher of sangria. Between the two of us, we probably drank only 3 glasses. The waiter was so kind to only charge us for two glasses instead of the pitcher. Very thoughtful and considerate. Next time, I will  try more tapas. The menu is extensive and you just have to keep going back bc you can only eat so much each time. \n\nHelpful hint: parking is very tough in this neighborhood.

Unfortunately everything tastes less than they should (except for the Sangria).\n\nZarzuela does not live up the hype and you may have liked it if you haven't been to a decent Spanish Tapas before but that's because this is actually a very creative and flavorful cuisine. Unfortunately, Zarzuela is just a mediocre example of it. \n\nI visited Zarzuela when I had 2 friends in town visiting from NYC last month. Knowing that my New Yorker friends love food and Spanish Tapas, I decided to take them there and have them experience my neighborhood's pretty popular Zarzuela. When we arrived on Friday, we were asked to wait for half an hour but ended up waiting 1 hour. That happens on busy days so won't judge much. However, waiting longer just to be located inside a small room right next to the restroom does not make my night any better. So, the ambience was pretty bad.\n\nOnce we are seated, we ordered the carafe of sangria. Great job there and the sangria will probably be the only reason if I ever come back. Everything else we ordered was just mediocre and you can have the same quality, if not better, in just a random Spanish restaurant in Mission for the half of the price. We ordered Paella, lamb chops, garlic shrimp, tortilla espanola, octopus, poached octopus, red peppers and flan and except for the lamp, I did not enjoy the rest. \n\nSo, if you are craving for Spanish food and living in the area then yeah I can understand why you would come.

He explained that the restaurant had existed for 31 years and he had been working there since it opened. He was delightful, recommended some dishes not on the menu  (Jamon Iberico), and kept coming to our table to see how everything was.\n\nThe food here is amazing! It's worth the time I spent looking for parking! :)  We had a tapas dinner; we ordered the mussel tapas,  grilled eggplant stuffed with a mild goat cheese, Jamon Iberico, that comes with toasted bread and a tomato tapenade, mushrooms, and quail  Everything had their own uniqueness of taste! The mussel were big and it tasted fresh. The sauce/broth that comes along with the mussel is excellent for dipping in those breads, so SAVE the plate to dip dip! The eggplant was not bitter and accented the goat cheese.  Insanely good! Love it here! Lastly, for the guest who ordered the paella, they enjoyed  a perfect version,  a mix of all seafood in the platter which included mussels, octopus, shrimps, scallops, and other goodies! What more can you ask for?! \n\nOverall one of my favorites Restaurants!! Highly recommended!", "author": "Elliott L."}

The worst part- the carafe of sangria we ordered had an uncooked, dead prawn in it. As prawns are literally the bottom feeders of the sea... It was like having a cockroach in your drink. It was disgusting. \n\nWhen we showed the waiter- he gave us every excuse he could think of. \"The sangria is mixed far from the kitchen\" ... \"I poured the sangria myself\" ... \"Maybe when the bus boy cleared your table, it fell in\" (to be clear- raw prawns are not on their menu.)\n\nHe just wouldn't admit this was his or the restaurants fault. No apology. No explanation. My husband doesn't carry around dead prawns in his pocket.\n\nThe did comp us the carafe ... But that wasn't good enough. We should have gotten a heartfelt apology.", "author": "Sarah H."}

First impression was that I was dropped off in the middle of Spain with their beautiful decorations and ambiance. They started us off with water, bread, olive oil and olives. We then ordered a pitcher of delicious sangria with 5 tapas plates total, which was enough to make our tummies happy:\n\n- Serrano ham with tomato spread on bread: loved that the ham was so savory and that the bread was there to balance it out with the lightness of tomatoes\n- grilled squid with aioli: cooked to just the right consistency. I really dislike when it's overcooked and becomes rubbery\n- anchovy dish: definitely went out of my comfort zone eating this but surprisingly it wasn't bad. Tad bit salty but eating it with bread is a great complement\n- white bean soup: the biggest beans I've ever seen in my life! Haha I really enjoyed this dish because it wasn't heavy but they gave just enough to fill you up\n- empanadas with chorizo: I absolutely LOVE empanadas and this one did not disappoint! Full of flavor, slight crunchiness on the outside but chewy on the inside, just how I like them\n\nAlso our server and all the other waiters were very attentive and friendly.

There's some great Spanish restaurants, all good for different reasons (some for the atmosphere, some for cheaper price, some for location, some for \"wannabe\"...)  but all in all Zarzuela is my favorite: Best food and nicest people. The team has been together for ages, it says a lot about the bonding and care among themselves and for their clients. It is family style all along. The food tastes of Spain, not pretentious or mixed or \"fusioned\". The octopus is perfect Galician style, the callos bring you back to Madrid and it's hometown with the Fabada! the basics are real: delicious Croquetas, Tortilla de Patatas -as good as the one I make myself at home, and that's hard ;)  Chipirones with ali-oli, boquerones in vinegar, pisto like grandma's, etc etc... I tend to stay on the tapas rather than the larger plates because we always go in a group and we want to try it all! \nEven the desserts are great, though I'm not such a \"sweet tooth\" - I'd recommend the Ponche Segoviano -marzipan kind of cake, can't find it very often, typical from the native region of Lucas, one of the owners; the \"brazo de gitano\" and the rice pudding are also amazing. \n\nPlus the wine list is great and cheap! Excellent Alvari\u00f1os and Godello in my favorites in a range of $40-60, and obviously a great selection of Riojas and Riveras. They also have nice Malbecs for sure. Can't get wrong. \n\nIf there's something \"negative\" to add, might be that they don't take reservations! During the week, or early on a Saturday, you're fine. Later, what we do is get on the list and they have a small \"waiting room\", not fancy but ok to get a wine while waiting.

Yay! Lets do it!   Though I have been to Canelas (awesome), Joya (awesome), Lolo (yum!), ChaChaCha (fun time), this place came up as one of the 'highest rated,.\"  Done!.  Lets go!  Coming from the East bay and trekking into SF on a rainy night to try something new and take mom out for her bday - was pretty excited.   \n\nAfter an hour or so of driving, I drop her off at the restaurant and go to find parking.....an hour later...i'm still looking for parking....I ended up parking down past Van Ness and taking a cab back up the hill.  Though this was annoying; I don't blame the restaurant for this - Russian Hill is just like that.  Okay, so now I have to re-energize.  Sit down, the manager (I think) comes by and feels bad that it took me so long to find parking, he chats it up with me for a bit (appreciated that - thank you!), now I feel better, can I have a glass of vino!  Smiles come back!  \n\nAmbiance: small, intimate, fun, yet cozy.  SUPER LIKE. \n\nMenu time - here's what we ordered: \n\n1) Ensalada De La Casa (salad)\n2) Banderillas De Solomillo Cordero (pork tenders)\n3) Champinones Plancha (mushrooms)\n4) Codornices Estofada (quail) \n5) Patatas Bravas (potatoes)\n6) Mango sorbet based on cheesecake, with strawberries and coconut flavorings\n\nOf the above dinner options, my favorites were the salad and the pork tenders!

We also ordered the grilled squid with aioli. I wasn't really thinking when I ordered it and had thought it was going to be a lot like calamari, but it was (obviously) pieces of grilled squid placed on top of aioli. The squid was perfectly grilled and went well with the aioli, and was surprisingly my most favorite dish of the night. \n\nService was very friendly but not overbearing, and our waters were always filled.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-19", "description": "This is by far one of my favorite spots to go to in the city.\n\nCareful though, parking is a pain. The mister spent over 30 minutes finding parking--I suggest you have the passenger get out and write your name down. Wait time could go anywhere from 45 mins to 1.5 hours. It's well worth it. So have a person wait while the driver finds parking. \n\nYou'll see that the wait can be long to just stand there so leave your number to have the owner call you when your table is almost ready and peruse the streets. I like the collectible antique shop next door. Or make your way to the market across the street to kill time. If you prefer to sit outside and chat, the owner will take your drink orders so you have something to sip on while you wait. Also, there's a waiting room in between the main dining room and side dining room (to the left) in case it's a cold night. \n\nThe ambience/atmosphere is kind of what you'd expect in a.. match.com commercial. Hahaha! That's the best way I can describe it. Busy, loud, fun, but somehow intimate at the same time. The lighting makes your date easy on the eyes, y'know what I'm saying.. ;)\n\nI find that their service is very fast. Highly recommend getting the carafe of sangria ($20), you'll  get about 6-8 glasses. Good for two people to share... 0=)\n\nAfter ordering you'll get a loaf of bread, some AMAZING olive oil (I've had a handful of olive oils, but the olive oil they serve here is very rich and flavorful!) and a mini plate of olives. Love it. Try not to eat too much of the bread, it should be enjoyed with your tapas items and/or in between or tapas items.. Or, I suppose you can order more bread.\n\nThe first time I came here, we ordered the paella. It is VERY filling for two.. So either have a big appetite. If I came as a party of 4, it would be perfect to order along with 1 cold and 1 hot item. .. Just giving you an idea. The rice is not soggy, I'd say it's almost like the al dente version of pasta. They give you PLENTY of seafood. All for about $16--\n\nThis time around, as much as I wanted paella, I really wanted to go big on their tapas. \n\nWe ordered, I'll try to add the prices of what I remember:\n- COLD Tortilla Espanola (potato onion omelette) ($6) - I would skip on this, it's GOOD, but it's a waste of stomach space for some better items. It's very dense and tastes exactly like what you'd expect, cold potato and onion wedges. It came with a cold mixture of citrus tomatoes and onions which was a nice balance to the density of the dish.\n- COLD Plato De Queso Variado (Cheese Platter) ($11) - The cheese platter was great, all except for.. I want to say it's like a Tallegio cheese, it's not so much stinky, but it tastes SO strong. Like, imagine the strongest cheese, with a kick in your mouth, but not the good kind. It's definitely more for major cheese connoisseurs. No apple, candied walnut, grape or sangria could wash that awful taste. It's not for me.. However, the rest of the plate had GREAT cheeses, 3 other kinds with some red grapes, candied walnuts and green apple to complement the flavors of the cheese. I'd definitely get this again, but avoid the veiny one in the center. \n- HOT Champinones al Ajillo (mushrooms in garlic sauce) ($8) - I love this. I ordered this the first time here and this last time and I'll continue ordering this. It has great flavor and you can really taste the garlic.\n- HOT Calamares A La Plancha Con Aioli (grilled squid with aioli) (9) - My favorite item of the night. The aioli is killer.. I just wanted to dip everything in that aioili. The squid was grilled perfectly where it isn't chewy or tough. It was moist and tender. Perfect combination. Well done Zarzuela. This was a beautiful dish.\n- HOT Mejillones Al Azafran (Mussels sauteed in white wine, garlic and saffron) ($9) - Another one of my favorites! It came with a lot of mussels, cooked perfect. You ever get mussels where they've been steamed for too long and you wonder where the rest of it went? Well, that won't happen here. It was great. The white wine with garlic and saffron was a great way to enjoy the mussels.\n- HOT Patatas Bravas (fried potatoes with spiced tomato sauce ($7) - This was good, the sauce is very spicy which I liked, but we were so full. Again, I probably won't order this again. It was good, but a waste of stomach space for better stuff!\n- HOT ENTREE Costillas Breseadas A La Cerveza (short ribs braised in beer) (Small - $13) - It was okay. It came with mashed potatoes. I think by then we were so full from the damn potato onion omelette at the beginning of the meal that it ruined what could've been another amazing item. It was full of flavor.\n\nEverything including drinks tax and tip came out to just under $100. Be generous tippers. Tip them well, because they give great service. \n\nI will keep this place forever in my heart, still one of my faves in the city. Sk", "author": "Zo T."}

This was just ehhhh. \nMushrooms - yum\nRoasted red peppers - ehhh. These were SUPER salty and vinegary.... like the ones that come out of a jar from Trader Joes. \nVegetable melange - ehhh.

This restaurant serves an array of Tapas dishes and has a notorious reputation for serving amazing Sangria. I highly recommend ordering the Paella and the Rollitos de Berenjena (Grilled Eggplant filled with Goat Cheese). Out of the several tapas dishes we tried that night, these two were my favorite. However, I must admit that I was not too crazy about the Sangria, I've tasted better Sangria elsewhere.\n\nMy favorite thing about this restaurant is that they sing authentic Spanish birthday songs to the birthday celebrants.

I also liked the potato-egg ratio in the tortilla and the pepper relish that came with it. The other dishes we tried - vegetable stew, shishito peppers, fried goat cheese were good too.

Back when we would come and visit as tourists about 2-3 years ago. I've always heard and read good things about Zarzuela. And I love tapas! But never made it before this weekend due to the fact that they don't accept reservations (we usually avoid those due to long wait times).\n\nWell we decided to go this past Friday for dinner, and went very early, as soon as they opened at 5:30. And yes we got tables woot! By 5:50pm all the tables were taken and people had to wait. It's a smallish place in the front, and they have more tables in the back. Service is pretty efficient and quick so I don't think it's much of a wait. \n\nThings I liked: service was very good and attentive. The place has that neighborhood restaurant feel, like everybody knows everybody, and the owners/workers. (There are bunch of tourists tho because of the trollies). So it breaks my heart that this review goes south after all that. Namely, the food is .. how to put this.. really mediocre. \n\nTapas:\nCroquetas De Jamon Y Pollo - wow you can't even taste the chicken or ham. It tastes like  something you buy from frozen section of the grocery store and pop in the microwave.\nPasteles De Cangrejo Con Salsa Rosa - crab cakes so bland and I'm afraid had that frozen food aisle taste again.\nCazuela De Queso De Cabra - I liked it but it's just goat cheese on tomato sauce with no additional flavor or seasoning.\n\nI think that was the overriding characteristic of everything was there was no distinct flavor. So bland. We kept wanting sauces for everything to dip in (they did not come with any). Even the bread they give at the beginning and olive oil.. just olive oil with no seasonings! How bland and boring! And unfortunately even the sangria that we ordered was meh. I may just skip visiting Spain if their food tastes like this.\n\nThe only saving grace was the paella we shared. Now that I would recommend. And it was tasty and flavorful. Too bad and too late though... if you're a tapas restaurant, you will have to shine with your tapas!  \n\nI'm quite disappointed sorry to say.", "author": "Vol T."}

Many so-called European restaurants in San Francisco are too pretty, too perfect.

I appreciated that they did not over season their dishes, like many other tapas places that want you to drink wine like water.  I enjoyed their Serrano Ham, Roasted Muscovy leg of duck, and Empanada.  I wasn't a big fan of their poached octopus or pork medallions.  Grilled lamb tenders were okay, but not too special.  \n\nDRINKS:  They had nice value 8 wines by the glass ($6.00-7.50), but unfortunately I didn't like any of them.  I'm not a big fan of sweet drinks, so I haven't tried their Sangria.    \n\nSEATS:  No reservations.  Pick where you want to sit.  Tight seating, so expect no privacy.  \n\nPRICES:  All depends on how many little dishes you order.

This was none of those things.\n\nOctopus with potatoes -- This was kinda weird and borderline gross.  I have never had soft octopus at all.  The octopus was the same texture as the potatoes.  It should have been a lot more chewy to nicely contrast with the soft potatoes.  At least the flavoring was good.\n\nBread pudding -- This was not bread pudding at all.  There was no bread texture to it.  It had more of the texture of flan.\n\nRed sangria -- Watered-down taste. (on both the alcohol and juice factor).  Predominately an apple juice flavor with a subtle hint of cinnamon.\n\nThe service was good.  At one point, one of the servers started singing this birthday song in Spanish (but I think it was actually a Mexican song), and it was quite beautiful.  \n\nThe pricing is quite decent (and on the lower end) for tapas in San Francisco.\n\nI'm not sure why this place averages 4 stars on Yelp.

Now I'm wondering if somewhere else would have been better! We went on a Friday night around 8:15 PM and were told there'd be a half hour wait. Not bad for a Friday night. \n\nWe waited inside since it was chilly outside (just a note: the waiting room can get a little cramped and we had the unfortunate luck of sitting next to people who needed to talk loudly about their worldly travels like anyone in earshot cared). Anyway, we were seated about 40-45 minutes later, in their back room. We got a carafe of sangria and ordered a few of their tapas - namely, the tortilla espanola, the jamon serrano con pan y tomate, and the patatas bravas. The food also came with bread, olives and oil. The food wasn't terrible, but it just didn't stack up to places I've been to in NYC (or Spain, obviously.) The jamon/pan combo was probably the best dish I had there, but the tortilla was just alright, and the patatas bravas were very dry (almost hard), and the sauce drizzled on them was watery. \n\nWas the restaurant horrible? No. Was it the best? Well, not sure, since this was the only tapas joint I hit in San Fran. You might be able to find better.", "author": "Doreen L."}

The little fish is perfectly battered and fried.  It taste so much better with the fingers than knife and fork - please enjoy yourself!  I could easily eat this and nothing else...I've been craving this since our last visit. $7.95.\n\nGrilled sardines - with a mixed green w/ apples - this was tasty too.  Lightly battered and grilled - if you like sardines, you'll enjoy this dish.  $7.95.\n\nfish of the day was wild salmon - we got the small dish $10.95 - a nice grilled portion w/ tomato sauce, the sauteed chard? w/ garlic and raisin completely stole the show.  We loved the veggie - the salmon was just ok.\n\nEmpanada of the day was tuna w/ veggie - $7.25 - this was so good.  The \"bread\" was crispy and the tuna filling was very flavorful - imagine it as the Spanish styled panini.  \n\nSeafood stew - $17.95 - the sauce was SO tasty, loved it!  It came with two large chunks of fish - one salmon and one white fish.  The large portion was great so it's not over cooked.  With some mussels, clams, calamari, some small shrimp and one piece eacg of scallop and butterflied prawn in shell - YUM!\n\nWe had the mango sorbet w/ coconut flakes, macadamia nuts - $5.95 - so fresh and light.

Pay $20 to park at the garage nearby, instead of trying to go around steep uphill/downhill blocks to find a non-existent space. Having recently gone to Barlata in Oakland, it's interesting to compare the two. B44 is decent but can't be considered at their level. Zarzuela and Barlata are both top-notch, yet have different styles. Zarzuela is more refined, a little more old-school. Barlata is earthier, with a younger hip vibe. Both are excellent, just different.\n\nPatatas Bravas were bland, but the Croquetas de Jamon Y Pollo, chicken and ham croquettes, were sensational. The empanada that night was tuna, and it was amazing - what tuna salad should be, but never is in this country. It is served in a pie-shaped wedge, BTW. \n\nThe Cazuela De Queso De Cabra, baked goat cheese in a tomato sauce, had a wonderful earthy, acid-y taste that begged to use up every slice of the generous serving of bread each table receives. The Champinones Plancha, mixed mushrooms, were roasted (the restaurant often uses those small iron skillets for serving). There was the slightest tang of white wine, just enough to enhance but not so much it detracted. \n\nThe Gambas Ajillo, shrimp sauteed in garlic and olive oil, also came in an iron skillet. It was so redolent of toasty garlic that any one of us probably could have killed a vampire with our breath alone at ten paces - IOW, it was perfect. \n\nThe Pulpo a La Gallega was tender thinly sliced poached octopus, layered atop slices of potato with mild seasonings of onion, olive oil, and pimenton. Like the grilled pork tenders (two skewers of moist, tender pork served with a dollop of mashed potatoes), both were simple yet excellent. \n\nAnother winner was the Boquerones, marinated filets of fresh anchovy served atop red and yellow roasted bell peppers. Tangy fish and sweet bells - a great combo. The loser was the chorizo - the Bay Area's many great Portugese sausagemakers do better.\n\nFor dessert, stick to the caramel flan or the rice pudding. Both are traditional, and Zarzuela's versions are excellent, dusted with high-quality cinnamon. The sherries are excellent - and if you want to splurge, get the 20-year old Sandeman's oloroso.

In fact, we waited so long that I had to go across the street and grab a bag of chips to hold me over until we were seated. But trust me - Zarzuela is WORTH THE WAIT.\n\nCold Mussels - the vinegrette perfectly complemented the fresh mussels, and was one of my favorites here.\n\nGrilled Squid - I have honestly never experienced squid executed so well. READ: this is the BEST squid I've ever tasted in my life! Getting hungry just thinking about it.\n\nGrilled Mushrooms - also delicious.\n\nSauteed Mussels - I couldn't really decide which one was better: the cold mussles or the warm sauteed mussels. They were both amazing, so order both and decide for yourself.\n\nPatatas Bravas - how can you have Spanish tapas without patatas bravas? Love it!\n\nSea Bass - in the midst of all the other delicious tapas, I actually forgot what I thought of the Sea Bass, which gives me an excuse to go back and try it again.\n\nBeer-Braised Short Ribs - bring on the meat! It was cooked beautifully and the dish was cleared as soon as it hit the table.\n\nGrilled Lamb Chops - Yummy! The only gripe I had was that they were a bit on the fatty side (as are 99% of lamb chops). Still, that didn't stop me from devouring a few bones-worth.\n\nPaella - YES! This is how you do Paella! B44 needs to take note. We thought about ordering two, but warning: serving size is large on their paella.\n\nRed Sangria - who can complain?\n\nBy far my FAVORITE tapas place in the city. I wish they took reservations so we wouldn't have to wait so long. Oh, and parking around this area sucks. Even with all that, this place DESERVES five stars from me.\n\nBy the way, if it's your birthday, they will serenade you. Not sing to you... SERENADE you.", "author": "Tony L."}

A few of them even had a nice kick.\n*Jamon Serrano - Dry. I seriously wish they had Jamon Iberico instead.\n*Grilled Mixed Mushrooms - Mix of 3-4 different kinds of mushrooms. Flavored nicely and goes well by itself or with other dishes.\n*Poached Octopus - Comes out looking a lot more flavorful than it really is. Cooked nicely and potatoes were a nice compliment. Nothing really special.\n*Roasted Moscovy Leg of Duck - 1 leg barely enough to share between 3 people. Cooked very nicely. Smother the meat in the sauce and it's quite deliciouso. \n*Grilled Lamb Chops - 3 pieces of lamb chop. Again, another dish that was cooked nicely but lacked a bit of flavor. Seems like they just lightly seasoned it with spices.\n*Oxtail Stew - Best dish of the night. Make sure you eat all the cartilage off the bones! \n\nBEER:\n*Estrella - Didn't taste like the Estrella I had in Spain.

Walked in on a Saturday night for dinner w/the BF and had a 30 min wait but went to a wine bar close by and had the table waiting and ready when we came back.  Ordered a bottle of wine based on the recommendations of the table next to us.  Complimentary bread and olives were a nice way to start the meal.  We ordered the grilled calamari (4 large and 4 small pieces on a butter sauce base) that was good but nothing exceptional.  The other starter that we ordered was a special of the day (walnut stuffed dates wrapped in pancetta) OMG these were so good.  Perfectly cooked and the walnuts added an earthy crunch that was to die for. We were planning on ordering a couple of other small plates, but everyone there was ordering the paella sooooo we had to try it.  So. Glad. We. Did.  Perfectly cooked with tons of seafood and chicken, and the crisp bottom rice was amaaaazing! Between the two of us, we basically cleared the entire dish.  \n\nAt this point we were the last people in the restaurant, but they brought out the desert menu anyway.  Typically I pass on desert, but we were temped to try a chocolate dish to round out the meal that reminded me of a chocolate tiramisu.  We were still there as they were starting to clean up the dining area, but were not rushed out at all and the staff was joking around with each other and us as they ended their evening.

In other words, you have a bunch of small plates to choose from, both cold and hot.\n\nSome of my favorites from the tapas frias list would be the tortilla espanola, which is a potato and onion omelet, full of flavor and served cold.   The ensaladilla rusa - potato salad with vegetables is very refreshing and well-seasoned.\n\nFrom the tapas calientes list, albondigas guisadas (aka meatball stew) is rich in flavor and the broth used is really good.  I would also recommend the mejillones al vino tinto, sauteed mussels in red wine sauce - I just love the mussels here as well.\n\nChef Gasco also serves up a mean crema de crustaceo, crab and shrimp bisque.  This was definitely something I was not expecting from a restaurant like this but it was delicious.\n\nThe specialty of the house may be considered the paella valenciana - Spanish rice cooked with an assortment of seafood and chicken.  The consistency is perfect, not too watery, not too salty, just the perfect balance of substance and spices.  Its comparable to the paella offered at Fresca, if not better.\n\nStreet parking can be difficult on busier nights since we're talking about the Russian Hill district, but it gives it just the right amount of neighborhood charm to go along with the neighborly service inside.\n\nThe decor is very rustic but also romantic with the white linens and intimate dimly-lit setting.

I really liked mine and it paired well with the tapas we ordered.\n\nFood:\n- Lambchops: 4.5 stars. SO FREAKING TENDER AND FLAVORFUL. Served with onions and thinly sliced potatoes in a delicious gravy.\n\n- Poached octopus: 3 stars. This is probably the best-cooked octopus I have ever tasted, but it was lacking flavor compared to the rest of our dishes. Also served with thinly sliced potatoes.\n\n- Mussels w/ saffron sauce: 4 stars. Again, suuuuper flavorful. The complimentary bread they serve you is perfect for soaking up the sauce, which I did shamelessly.\n\n- Salad: 2.5 stars. I forget which one we ordered but it had apples, blue cheese, and a vinaigrette dressing. Your average salad, nothing bad but nothing amazing.\n\n- Rice pudding: 2 stars. I dont' like cold rice pudding and this one was REALLY thick and creamy and not very smooth. Not my thang.\n\nOverall, I would want to come here and order more items off their menu in order to possibly bump up my review. I do like the fact that it's small and intimate, and their wait staff was friendly for the remainder of the evening (once my parents arrived).\n\nZarzuela, I'll be back.\n\nOH, and one more thing. Their bathroom sucks. So if you can avoid going #1 or #2 during your dinner, I highly suggest you do.", "author": "Nicole W."}

After having walked by the restaurant 40 times, I finally tried the tapas a few weeks ago with my girlfriends. Although Zarzuela is good for dates with its rustic look and white tablecloth, it's even better for small groups because you get to try more plates.\n\nWe had everything from dates to duck to seafood to snails, including classic tapas like goat cheese in tomato sauce and potatoes in tomato sauce. Everything was tasty, though nothing stood out for me. The portions were also very small. I had amazing tapas at La Trucha in Madrid, so Zarzuela faced a bar that it failed to meet. \n\nI would recommend Alegria's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alegrias-san-francisco) for traditional Spanish tapas or Destino (http://www.yelp.com/biz/destino-san-francisco) for a Latin American twist on them.\n\nIt was about $25 per person for seven plates (6 small, 1 big) and a carafe of sangria. Zarzuela is therefore reasonably priced, but I'd rather pay more for tapas that make my eyes roll back... to memories of Spain.", "author": "Liz T."}

Free street parking for 2 hours until 9pm on the street. Or you can park inside a \"lot\" structure for $10 (2 hours) diagonally across from the restaurant.  \n\nCome right at 6pm or else you may be stuck waiting in line for a bit. There are a few Japanese sushi/bars you can grab a drink at around the neighborhood. \n\nAMIBENCE - rustic and dim with bull fighting posters along the walls. You see #41 bus and the Cable Car whisking by every few minutes. \n\nTAPAS:\n\nBread, Olive Oil and Black Olives on the house. \nPadron Peppers - $8/tapa dish. This was delish and grilled just right\nCalamari with Aioli - okay.\nMushrooms - tasty.\nOctopus with potatoes - The octopus was too overly cooked and not chewy.\n\nMain dish - We shared the seafood stew ($18). \n\nDesserts are $6/each but we didn't try it.\n\n--------\n My notables were: SANGRIA, mushrooms, padron peppers. \n\nMy note to the owners:\n\nHave a website for your restaurant so it's easier for your patrons to look up parking information, peruse the menu, etc. \n\nNot the best tapas I've had.

We shared only 2 appetizers: oven-roasted potatoes with some orange sauce, and the other was a pork on a stick thing that was kind of bland and not that warm.   I was surprised at how fast they arrived though soon after order, that we got bread at the table only after the appetizers arrived.  The olive oil was pretty great.\n\nThe sangria was also pretty good and not overkill with the fruit which was nice.  \nWe all shared a paella valenciana which was meant for 2 but we were able to share it among us 3.  Again, nothing incredible or memorable considering I've had paella from Valencia, and nothing beats the original I guess.  \n\nBut I would revisit if we get the front room best. I fell I was 2 steps away from cleaning the dishes, and I'm latin, so that's kinda awkward. lol.  Service was fast, friendly though it was more about us, they let us do our thing without much interruptions or suggestions.  I asked for a candle for my friend's bread pudding that we also shared, and the waiter was great and brought one.

The menu was a bit limited in my opinion for a primarily tapas place but they did have a nice selection of items.\n\nI had the fried potatoes covered in spicy tomato sauce. It was tasty and had good flavor but not worth the price of the dish. 3.5 out of 5 sporks. \n\nNext I had these ham and Chicken fried sticks. The name escapes me at the moment but they reminded me of fish sticks. Very delicious, they just kind of melted in my mouth. My only grip was there was no dipping sauce. An aoli or marinara dipping sauce would have been perfect to go along with this dish. 4 out of 5 sporks.\n\nFinally I had the snaills cooked in garlic on garlic toast. Very good if you enjoy escargos but not the best I ever had, worth I try I guess. 3.5 out of 5 sporks. \n\nThey served olives and bread as a complimentary dish which was interesting and a nice change of pace. \n\nI have to say though one of my big drawbacks is the service was not very attentive. I had to ask for water 3 times before the waiter came by to fill me up. No it was not due to it being really busy I just think it wasn't his priority which in my book is a big mistake.\n\nThe price is a bit high for what you get.

The host told us an hour, so we went down the street to a wine bar for about 45 minutes. When we came back he told us we were next on the list, but we proceeded to wait ANOTHER 40 minutes or so and watched them seat other larger groups - very confusing. In total it was 1 hour, 35 minutes for a table. Since they have no inside space to wait, we were standing on the street in the cold - not so fun.\n\nThen when we got our table, it took about 25 minutes to be acknowledged by our waiter. Literally no greeting, no water, no bread...nothing. It was really strange. He was serving the table next to us (and it's a small place) but was totally ignoring us trying to get his attention. We flagged down the host again to order some sangria, which he brought to us while our waiter served other tables.\n\nOnce we finally did order, the food came fairly quickly and we did love everything we tried.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-12", "description": "I had super high expectations for this place given the Yelp reviews and the fact it was recommended by a foodie friend but I have to say I was disappointed\n\nSo was the food authentic, absolutely.  The dishes are what you would find in Spain, especially in the Catalonia region.  However, I would describe it as the Spanish equivalent of the random diner on your block that you never remember the name of and only go to for convenience, not for culinary exploration, for great ambiance, etc.  aka not horrendously bad but not special.  The problem is it is in America, which by definition makes it special, and to that end, it just does not live up. \n\nI think the first thing that gave away that it was going to be disappointing was the sangria.  I can best describe it as box-wine frat house/supermarket sangria. Yes you do get sangria like this in Spain but obviously sangria would not be famous if it were supposed to taste like this. In other words, I can make sangria better than this. Took me about to the end of the carafe to feel even a slight anything. It was super watered down. Now what we ordered...\n\nPimientos Asados - This just wasn't what I expected. I was expecting the green roasted peppers that is hot and lightly salted, but my bad for ordering the wrong dish. It was okay, not what I would've ordered normally.  \n\nJamon Serrano con Pan, Tomate - This was also okay, the pan with tomate is very Catalan, but obviously better in Spain, felt like the spread is missing some ingredients but none the less it was alright.  The serrano ham both me and boyfriend agreed tasted somewhat different than the ones we had before but we couldn't put our finger on it. \n\nGambas al Ajillo - This was the hallmark of the diner tapas. It just was not bursting with the garlic flavor and the texture of the shrimp itself did not taste fresh and tasted a bit old and stubborn.\n\nCroquetas - This was okay but I have had Costco croquetas that you bake at home and I can't say I can tell the difference.  \n\nPatatas Bravas - I don't think you can mess it up.  I mean it's like messing up french fries. So it was okay.\n\nPulpo a la Gallega - This was the dish that we were like okay this just took it another level below. It was not evenly seasoned, the first piece I tasted was bland and the second piece I got the salt seasoning. Texture also a bit overdone. \n \nChuletas de Cordero - This in all honesty was actually pretty good but it came at the end of the meal at which point all the other dishes had somewhat spoken for the restaurant. But I recommend this if you are going. Very flavorful done just right. \n\nI do think we will go back another time to try some other dishes before writing it off because it is hard to actually find authentic Spanish food in America.  Overall I would recommend it if you have never had Spanish food but probably not if you have and are expecting to be wowed. I think I had extremely high expectations which probably didn't help.\n\nIn terms of portions, I would recommend 3 per person plus dessert.  We were starving and got 7 between us.

I could safely say that I had my last meal, and what a meal it was. Dining at Zarzuela was the highlight of my trip to San Francisco.\n\nWhat we ate -\n\nChicken Fritters with goat cheese wrapped in eggplant - While not a fan of the cold tapas, this dish was amazing. Note, that these are two separate items served on the same dish. The fritters were crispy and flavorful, but the highlight was the goat cheese. While goat cheese normally has an overpowering flavor, the eggplant balances it out nicely. \n\nTortilla Espanola - One of my favorite tapas and this one was made to perfection. The dish was not too dense with potatoes, but fluffy like a souffle. \n\nPatatas Bravas - I could have done without this one. While the seasoning was amazing, the potatoes took up too much valuable stomach space to try other things. \n\nJamon Iberico - This ham has been banned for import in the US for a long time, and now Zarzuela has it! This is served with tomato bread and is to die for. The ham itself is overpowering, but compliments the tomato topped bread nicely. \n\nGrilled Chorizo - The chorizo was just okay, but when paired with the 2003 Altun Rioja, it creates a flavor explosion. This was incredible!\n\nBeef Short Ribs - Tenderly sliced cuts of short rib served with sauce over a bed of mashed potatoes. The meat just melts in your mouth and the potatoes have a smooth creamy texture. \n\nLamb Chops - Those who are not fond of the gaminess of lamb can enjoy this dish. The chops are seasoned with garlic, butter, and other spices; and the meat is fresh, therefore eliminating the peculiar flavor associated with lamb. The lamb is served over a bed of grilled potatoes that absorb the seasoning and juices. \n\nPaella Valencia - While the paella was really good, it just added to the perfection of the tapas and wasn't the highlight of the meal itself. The rice is served al dente and the ingredients were simmered nicely in the saffron broth. \n\nArroz Con Leche - Rice pudding. Not too sweet and amazingly rich. \n\nCrema Catalana - This is one of my favorite Spanish desserts and Zarzuela makes it perfectly. You can taste the lemon zest infused in the cream and the texture is rich and smooth and compliments the torched sugar on top. \n\nMango Sorbet Tart - An incredible dessert of mango sorbet baked into a tart. I'm not sure how they made this one, but it was perfectly sweet and cleaned the palate nicely. \n\nWhile we ordered other things as well, these dishes were the highlight of the evening. Arturo and the staff know their wine, and paired the meal up with a perfect 2003 Altun Rioja that  was smokey and rich. The food was the most authentic I have ever had, and I would probably say that quality wise, it even tops the places in Barcelona. I was looking forward to dining here for over a month, and I was not disappointed. Zarzuela made my trip to San Francisco perfect.", "author": "Chris E."}

The only minus was the lack of fond on the bottom of the pan.  It just needed a couple extra minutes of heat to get that crunchy, browned rice on the bottom that adds flavor and depth.\n\nOverall, an excellent meal on a weekend trip, with 5-star service at a really busy time.", "author": "Peter J."}

Our food came out quickly and together, and the wine selection was great!\n\nWhere Zarzuela takes a hit is in the food department. I remember going there when I was younger with my dad one of his buddies, and I remember the food being really good. When I returned a decade later, however, the food was much less flavorful and uninspired. I'm not sure if the food got worse or if I've become an overly critical douche as I get older (I'm a fossil almost....27 years old). \n\nIf you've never had tapas in Spain then maybe this place will be of interest, but I can't compare this Russian Hill institution favorably to the tapas bars that I've been fortunate enough to visit in San Sebastian and Barcelona.", "author": "Peter F."}

We liked 6 of the 8 things that we tried and I'd definitely go back.  The service was quick and really good.  We got there a little before 7 and the place was empty, but a little after 7:30 people started streaming in and the place was full by around 8:00.  That's how fast two different rounds of hot tapas came out.  We were in and out in just over an hour.  It wasn't rushed, it was just quick.  I found the potatoes to be dry and oddly flavored, and we discovered that neither of us cared for tripe, but there were 6 other dishes that I'd order again: the chorizo, shrimp with garlic, eggplant and goat cheese, lamb skewers, mussels, and the empanada.  If you're going, go early and go hungry.\n\nThey don't take American Express and I wish they did because when I'm on a business trip, it's easier if it's all on the one card.  They do take Mastercard and Visa, and I understand that amex charges them more, but here's the way I see it.  On the next business trip I'm tempted to try a different restaurant just to keep my life easy, and what did the restaurant save?  Maybe $1.50.  I don't get it, but they serve really good food and they filled up quickly on a Tuesday night, so they must know what they're doing.  Anyway, if you're okay with paying with Mastercard, Visa, or cash, call them first to see if they're full, and then have a great meal.", "author": "Don W."}

The vegetarian was actually better than the regular paella.  I got the regular paella it had a lot of seafood in it which I'm not a real buff of seafood and I actually asked for just chicken and shrimp. They actually gave me shrimp clams oysters calamari and fish in it.  I ate it anyway since it takes a half hour to prepare.   It was okay not bad it was $36 so it's not cheap vegetarian was also $36 and it was just ok the sangria for $20 is a great deal and the sangria is handmade and it really tastes wonderful the desserts are the best part we got the sponge cake with a coconut cream on top and then we tried the cheesecake.  The cheesecake was half frozen still so that wasn't so nice but the sponge cake was phenomenal and I would recommend it highly we got coffee actually we asked for coffee but it never came into we're almost ready to leave by then most of our desserts was almost finished so don't get coffee   The goat cheese appetizer was delicious.

I suggest soaking up some bread in the sauce the tripe is cooked in.

So after six years of being away, I decided to try it again. It did not disappoint...\n\nThe wait was just as long as I remembered it being. The restaurant is tiny and popular so the wait, even on a Wednesday evening for two people is a 20 to 30 minute wait. However this seems like a small price to pay for the amazing food that will entertain your taste buds. The sangria is good, and better than most places, but the real reason to come here is for the paella. It's features a generous amount of seafood and chicken and perfectly cooked rice. The tapas are also tasty. We had the goat cheese and the pork tenders. The goat cheese was delicious but only came with two of the tiniest toast slices. How in the world is anyone supposed to eat a whole dish of goat cheese and tomatoes with two tiny pieces of toast is beyond me. That is my one and only criticism.

It would have been a lot better if the tomatoes had had any flavor, but overall the dish was nice.\nChampinones al Ajillo: I liked these quite a bit, and more than at other restaurants I've been to. The mushrooms themselves seemed quite tasty and weren't overpowered by the sauce or anything.

The paella was a bit greasy but pretty tasty - there were a couple of good sized prawns in there, along with smaller shrimp and pleasant, juicy mussels. \n\nOverall, I was happy with it, but it wasn't great - I'd go back to Alegrias rather than come back here.", "author": "Lisa K."}

I was sure to skip the tight top and go for the loose, forgiving t-shirt. To prepare myself, I loosened my belt. :) Hey, I'm not here to impress anybody, just eat good food! I was starving when I arrived and so excited to start pigging out! \nBetween the 3 of us, we ordered the following: small special lamb dish, the paella, the hot mussels, the snails, the duck breast and the grilled octopus. Oh yeah and a carafe of the Sangria. \nHonestly I wasn't a fan of the lamb- it was gamely and my portion had a lot of chewy fat on it (ewwww!). But it did come with delicious mashed potatoes (whoever invented such a perfect food should be lauded as a hero!) that I hogged. \nEverything else was fantastic! The paella was FULL of yummy things- chicken, veggies, fish, shrimp, mussels! The waiter was kind enough to serve us... probably because he saw that we were having trouble. I'd rather leave it to the professionals. \nThe octopus and mussels- yummy! Just the way I liked them. Full of flavor and juicy! \nThe snails were surprisingly good. They were served on a piece of toast with a green sauce (pesto? I dunno) and some sweet purple veggie stuff. \nAnd the duck breast!!!!! Wow! So juicy and tender! Definitely a must-have! \nThe sangria was meh. But it was $20 for a carafe ($5 for a glass) and we didn't finish it all so it was a push. \nWe grudgingly ordered dessert. Only because my belt was no longer loose! As always, my eyes were bigger than my stomach and I wanted us to share 2 desserts. My dinner mates vetoed my greediness and we got the sponge cake. It was ok... I'm curious about the flan and chocolate!!! \nAt the end of our meal, we were all extremely full and satisfied. Mission accomplished!", "author": "Amanda W."}

For that matter, it doesn't compare that well with my favorite Spanish restaurant,  Cesar's across the Bay.  There are some hits but, sadly, a few more misses.  \n\nFirst, the hits.  They got the seafood salad right.  It's a simple dish but very good.  My only complaint?  It's served straight out of the refrigerator whereas in Spain its kept at room temperature to help enhance the flavor. (Perhaps this is a health code requirement and if that's true, that's BS).  Next, their flan was actually quite good.  I usually hate flan. \n\nThe misses?  There are two issues with the menu:  blandness and too much refrigeration.    The chorizo empanadas were bland.  My 10 year old even hoped for more spice.  The octopus and potato salad was blandness defined.  If you're going to serve octopus, you really shouldn't screw it up.  We also had grilled eggplant stuffed with goat cheese.  What they do is grill the eggplant the night before, stuff it with the cheese and stick it in the fridge and serve.  Goat cheese shouldn't have the feel of an ice cube.  I also had the mussels in vinaigrette.  In this case, it was the same dressing used for the seafood salad so really nothing new.  The biggest miss?  No decent selection of Iberian hams.  At Cesar's in the east bay you get an amazing selection.  Nada here.\n\nThe wine list is a decent sampling of Spanish vino.  However, they were out of Cava.  For dessert, I ordered dessert wine that the waiter forgot to bring.  \n\nAs for service, it was decent but nothing that stood out.   \n\nOverall, I recommend the owners take a trip to Madrid for a little inspiration.", "author": "Rob R."}

Zarzuela was a surprising find, and right by our apartment in Russian Hill. The restaurant is really small and charming; it feels like someone's very nice dining room or patio. All the tables are very close together, which gives it more of a European feel, and the walls are covered in Spanish art.\n\nWe ordered the patatas bravas, calamari, goat cheese, empanadas, and mussels. The patatas bravas, goat cheese, and mussels were fantastic; the empanadas and calamari were good but not great (although my boyfriend said the calamari were his favorite dish). Everything was pretty reasonably priced, at about $7 per dish -- not bad, considering that the portions were larger than I expected for tapas and that 5 dishes was enough for the both of us for dinner.\n\nDownsides: longish wait (we had to wait about 15 minutes for 2 people without a reservation), disappointingly small options for cava :(\n\nAs a side note, the restaurant was much more dressy than we had anticipated.

Not to be.  Although the waiter was courteous and well-informed of each dish, I knew there would be a problem when he said the paella would only take 25 minutes to prepare and serve.  The rice was so under cooked that I should have sent it back (my fault).  We took the majority of it home and separated the rice from the other ingredients and ended up cooking it another 20 minutes (it was THAT under cooked)!  Very disappointing, especially on their signature dish.  Prior to the paella, we did have several savory tapas - all well prepared.  The sangria was so-so; stay with the wines.

I mean, it may be one of the oldest, if not the oldest tapas place in SF, but the food was mediocre, if that.  We ordered the goat cheese and tomato dish which everyone talks about but it was just okay, nothing special or memorable.  We also got the potato pancake which was not very good in my opinion and would have been better if it was hot, even if its supposed to be served cold.  The croquettes were pretty good but you really can't go wrong with ham, cheese and mashed potato that's been deep fried, can you?  We also got a sausage dish which was, again just okay.  \n\nWhat I did love though was the location, minus the parking.

Flavorless quial, dry potatoes, soggy empanadas, nothing special sausages.

Zarzula is a great place to celebrate birthdays, the caveat being that they do not do reservations which can be tricky. However, many other places will hold your credit card and then not seat you until your entire party is there, some places will then give your table away after 15 minutes and proceed to charge your card. So, I decided to do to the no reservations because although I adore my lovely friends, many of them always run 20-60 minutes late- due to pub trans, parking etc., We arrived at Zarzuela around 6 and the place was already packed! The host was very nice, he took my name and asked that I let him know when my entire party had arrived. Around 40 minutes passes by and two friends have not yet arrived, but the host sat us at the table that had just opened which was nice and my friends arrived only minutes later. We sat by the door so it was a little cold and we waited a bit before having our drink orders taken, my friends and I began to talk about the wait in annoyance, I was worried that my b-day was off to a bad start- and it was my 30th! We were all in desperate need of sangria so perhaps we were a bit impatient and there aren't many waiters there. Our waiter arrived and was so friendly and upbeat that we all forgot about the wait and cheerfully began ordering carafes and tapas galore!\n\nMy favorite tapa was hands down the grilled calamari! I've eaten grilled calamari many times and it's never tasted so good- the texture was perfect, not too rough and they use a ton of fresh lemon. I also loved the bell peppers which are delicious with the bread. We also had the potatoes, the mussels, shrimp, spinach pie and the goat cheese and tomato sauce- apparently one of the most popular items and it was good, but the other tapas stood out more. We also ordered the Spanish omelet, I've tried this tapa at other places and wasn't impressed, but here it was great- it's moist and not dry like others I've had, it's also served with a tomato mix in the middle which is very good. \nAlso, the sangria is amazing! I think they must add cinnamon or cloves, I don't know what their secret is, but it's dangerously good! Since it was my birthday our waiter brought our table a chocolate mousse cake, I'm not much of dessert person so a couple of bites was a shock to my palette- a good shock, it was very decadent and my taste buds were pleased. Our waiter also had the entire restaurant stop what they were doing so he could sing to me in Spanish, it was adorable and he has quite a voice! We had many, many tapas and even ordered a total of three calamari plates and two potato plates, I was expecting the bill to be outrageous but it ended up being around $25 per person- not bad considering we ordered a lot, had 2 carafes of sangria and they will refill your bread basket as many times as you would like, it's a great think because the bread is really good. I'm so happy to live only a couple of blocks away from this place and I can't wait to go back!", "author": "Natalie M."}

How I missed this virtually perfect dish for 26 years, I don't know.  We moved to Nob Hill, and while waiting for the bus saw the giant paella mural on the wall at Union and Hyde.  As we wiped off the drool from our mouths, we promised that Zarzuela would be the next restaurant we would try.  Although we were hesitant coming right off a trip from the land of paella, we thought we'd give them the benefit of the doubt and try the cuisine.  I hate to say it......but Zarzuela may be, no IS,  the best Spanish food I've had ever had.  Truly authentic, delicious, and the best part about the place is the staff.  Mostly the same guys every night, and aside from being gracious and friendly, they are so welcoming that you feel like you're in their family house in Spain.  Sometimes when I walk home late at night I see them sitting in the restaurant after everything's closed up, just drinking wine and enjoying each other's company.

The place was hopping--it took my two buddies and me 40 minutes to get a table. There isn't a bar inside, so leave the poor conversationalists in your friend group at home, or it's going to be a long 40 minutes.\n\nNice decor with an intimate feel. In addition to the 30ish seats in the main dining room where we sat, there's a back room with a table or two. Much quieter, I suppose, but lacking some of the charm of the main room.\n\nWe started off with Pimientos Asados (peppers), Rollitos de Berenjena (eggplant and goat cheese), and a pitcher of sangria. I especially recommend the peppers. Moving on to hot tapas, we ordered Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp in garlic and olive oil), Mejillones al Vino Tinto (mussels), Patatas Gravas (potatoes) and another pitcher of sangria. Both the shrimp and mussels were excellent--I recommend ordering seafood from the tapas menu.\n\nLast, we split two entrees: short ribs and pork medallions. Short ribs were oh so tender and melted in my mouth. Pork medallions were enjoyable but not particularly memorable, though we were two pitchers of sangria deep at that point, so my focus was not at its finest.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the port pear. Light and sweet and a good palate cleanser. I had plenty to eat, and our bill (including the sangria) was only about $100, which I consider a good value for the quality of the meal and the ambiance. \n\nIn short: come ready for a wait, and take advantage of the whole menu.

I had been fairly excited to eat here, but after my meal on Friday, I'm pretty shocked that this restaurant made the 100 Best of the Bay. Now, I don't really like ranting about restaurants and I try to only write things on Yelp that I would tell the chef/owner of a restaurant. That being said...\n\nThe food was uninventive, very under seasoned, and simply unimpressive. Now, because it's tapas and they have a lot to choose from, I'm going to say that maybe we just ordered all the wrong things. But I don't even like using that sentence \"maybe we ordered the wrong things\" because if something isn't stellar, it shouldn't be on the menu in the first place. We had the tortilla espanola, the chorizo in wine sauce, the braised quail, and the grilled calamari with aioli. The first was screaming for salt, the second was tasty but was pretty much a piece of chorizo that you could buy anywhere and cut into pieces yourself, the third was too dry and also screaming for salt, and the last one was good but nothing special...and needed salt.\n\nThe best part of my meal was the bread, which wasn't even that good, but by that point I was just that hungry. But the olive oil they served it with was delicious and I literally soaked 5 slices in it as my dinner. \n\nAnd, I didn't even have time to enjoy the company I was with as much as I would've liked because the food came out so fast it gave us no time to talk.

We couldn't have been there longer than 30 minutes!\n\nOur waiter was friendly, but his smiles were not enough to save the errors in execution of the food. I left feeling disappointed, and a little angry we took so much time to find parking only to end up with a meal like that. \n\nCould I cook what they served me at home? Yes. Could I do it better?

We got here pretty early, I think right when they opened, so we didn't have any problems getting a table, but we could see what it would've been like had we arrived just a half hour later. A popular but unpretentious spot in the Russian Hill neighborhood, and everyone loves tapas, right? So between the four of us we shared: croquetas, sauteed mushrooms, empanadas, paella, and a flan. Oh, and some sangria, too (yum!). Everything was very good, but I think we all liked the sauteed mushrooms extra-much! They come to you in this little iron skillet, like fajitas, and they were de-lish! Their empanadas were unusual in that they weren't enclosed little pockets like you'd be used to--it was more like a strata or a lasagna. Still good, but I don't know if my brain actually though of them as \"real\" empanadas. The paella was good, but it did seem to get a tad dry as the evening wore on; eat it fast out of that pan. Finally, the flan was very tasty, but nothing extraordinary. The waiter was great, and it was a very enjoyable experience overall--a good casual place to hang out with friends and loved ones. I'd say probably a bit too noisy and crowded for a romantic dinner, though.", "author": "Steph H."}

Their romesco does have quite a bit of almond to it, which I did enjoy with the wilted greens that accompanied the small scallops (6 to a small order).  Finally, I don't know I can say enough about the pork medallions in a Cabrales cheese sauce with roasted red peppers over mashed potatoes.

Wouldn't have even been able to tell it was alcoholic if it wasn't for my roommate who turns red just from the smell of alcy.  We kinda split the table up and our half went with 8-9 dishes for 5 people.  Things that really stood out were the crab cakes and beef dish.  Mushrooms were great.  Everything else was good too, but I honestly can't remember the other dishes we had.\n\nOverall a good spot to come out to, but only if you aren't super hungry.

But the restaurant gets 2 stars for the noise level in the main room (which is where you probably wish to sit). We started with a tasty gazpacho soup and an average salad and then had tapas of patatas, fresh deep-fried anchovies, quail, 4 little dates stuffed w/ almonds, mussels with garlic and saffron (yum but very salty), chicken on skewers and a main entree of delicious short-ribs and mashed potatoes. Sharing nearly everything (there were 4 of us) along with 2 carafes of sangria, we still managed to cross the street to Swensen's. \nOKAY...here's my 2 cents. Zarzuela is VERY popular. We went there on a Tuesday evening around 6:15pm and within 15 minutes, all tables were full in the main dining room. Zarzuela is also VERY noisy, uncomfortably so. Zarzuela's food ranges from average to very good but not spectacular and most dishes can be salty. The tapas are very small portions, so you end up ordering quite a few to get a meal. My suggestion is to order one or two tapas and then order from the main entree list. You can share the short-ribs for the price of two tapas and enjoy a lot more food (although not the variety of course).  We didn't try the paella but it looked good (they require two persons to order one at $17pp). The sangria was YUM; service very nice and spot on.", "author": "fused g."}

They serve a wide variety of good food, and though it isn't cheap, you do get what you pay for.  The atmosphere is good and convivial, though it can get quite loud when full of people.\n\nIt can be hard getting a table here, however.

Since the hubs and I have been to Spain we wanted to see if this place could really offer authentic Spanish food. Much to our disappointment, we were totally let down. \n\nWhen we arrived, I gave my husband's first name for the waiting list and they guy said it would be about a 20 minute wait. No problem, we were willing to wait. So we made our way outside and stood on the sidewalk with about 15 other people. After 20 minutes of listening screaming kids, the matradee came out and said the name \"Kenny\" in a barley audible voice. He then seated a couple that had just arrived. Hubs and I were confused so I went in and asked what name they just called. The matradee said Kenny. I replied did you mean Kerry? He rudely said, \"Kenny...Kerry...whatever.\"  Then he seated us in a dark dirty looking area in the back of the restaurant. Our table was lopsided but we weren't there to eat the table so we didn't say anything. After a few minutes we ordered a large selection of tapas. They came out quickly and we're guessing that's because not a lot of effort went into making fresh tasty food. The portions were small and we were very underwhelmed by the flavors. With that said, we didn't bother to order a main entree or dessert. \n\nLater that night, both of us had stomach problems. Maybe it was something else we ate...who knows.", "author": "Shara H."}

My first Z outing was on a date (and didn't really pay attention to the food) and the most recent time was for a friend's birthday. Now, I thought the only dining area is the one that can be seen from the street (super small without a real waiting area, and the host stand towards the back and not by the front door). However, with our party of 12, we were led towards the back, by the kitchen, where bigger groups are accommodated. \n\nStraight away, we ordered the alcohol. Pitchers and pitchers of sangria! \nSo tasty and not too tart nor sweet. \nTapas and Food! With such a huge party, we practically ordered everything, and here's what I remember being on the table and liking: \n- Tortilla Espanola (Potato & onion omelet) \n- Grilled Eggplant filled with Goat Cheese - reminded me of a canolli, and so yummy! It's goat cheese, which is one of my favs! \n- Fried Potatoes - perfectly fried and sauce was tomato based with a slight kick to it \n- Croquetas - Wow is all I can say about these! So yummy!! \n- Gambas al Ajillo (Sauteed Shrimps in Garlic and Olive oil) \n- Mejillones (Sauteed Mussels) \n- Goat Cheese with tomato sauce - Being the cheese freak that I am, this was one of my favs and scooped it up with the bread since there were only two pieces of the crostinis. \n- Empanadas - Special of the day was Chorizo. Me gusto! Que bueno! \nFor our entree, we ordered the Paella Valenciana, with seafood and chicken. This was ginormous and enough for everyone to have a serving of it. Savory and topped with enough seafood and chicken in every spoonful. \n\nOur server was nice and accommodating. He brought over a dense chocolate dessert for the birthday girl. We all sang \"Happy Birthday\" to her, and later, another server sang a Spanish birthday song. Our main server announced that his cohort doesn't usually perform, and we all were expecting \"Feliz Cumpleanos.\" To our surprise, it wasn't, and sounded more like a romantic love song than a birthday one. He had our table, and section totally mesmerized with his wonderful voice as he put so much feeling and heart into it. We all gave him a rousing applause! Wow, who knew Zarzuela could provide that kind of entertainment?\n \nDinner was reasonably priced, at $32 each, which isn't bad considering the amount of food and sangria consumed! \n\nThe interior is authentically Spanish, with the warm colors and tiles. \nZ's is a great place for a date or for groups! \n\nI would've given Z a 5 star rating but we waited a long time for the olives, bread, and bill. Also, I felt like they crammed too many people at the table, and who enjoys eating with their elbows glued to their sides? \n\nZarzuela- Hasta la proxima!", "author": "Gill C."}

I studied abroad in Madrid, so I was really looking forward to tasty tapas. The price is fine, but the food is eh. I found everything to be slightly too oily/greasy and the sangria isn't very strong.\n\nThey don't have a liquor license (only beer + wine) which they get around by cooking the brandy down with the simple syrup but it doesn't really make for an alcoholic sangria, which is how I prefer mine.\n\nTry not to sit in the dark cave in the back room if you can help it. The room in the front is at least very well lit with nice people watching. Seriously, I tried everything from paella to chorizo to bravas etc. and I can't think of a single stand-out.

The Paella was well prepared with a variety of good ingredients including mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops, chicken, red peppers, garlic, green beans, parsley and lemon wedges as garnish.  I really did not pick on  the saffron flavor, so I don't know if enough was added to the dish, and  it really only takes a pinch to make a difference in the flavor. \nThe seafood and chicken where all very tender and not dried out from over cooking. \n\nGetting the rice to be properly cooked in a Paella dish is very difficult when cooked in a traditional Paella pan, since the pan is traditionally left uncovered for the entire duration of the cooking process.  In this case the rice was still a bit al dente ( undercooked).\n\nComplaints: \nThe menu price for Paella is $16.95.  However when I ordered, I was told there is a two order minimum for Paella.  I feel this should be stated on the menu.  The stated price should be $33.90. \n\nI also asked the waiter what type of rice they use for Paella and he could only tell me that it's \"special rice.\"  I consider the to be poor knowledge menu ingredients.\n\nPulpo A La Gallega is poached octopus & potatoes - the Octopus was very tender and potatoes were well perfectly cooked but the portions very small, however I understand this because it's a tapas menu  item.", "author": "Ralph F."}

We were seated in less than 10 at a lovely little table by the window, and were greeted immediately by a cheerful server who then rushed off to get our drinks (but certainly not before stopping by a large table to sing a wonderful rendition of Las Mananitas).  He got the crowd going and some even joined in!  (I know I was about to!) \n\nWe munched on the bread, olive oil and olives that were placed on our table, while we waited for our drinks.  Our server returned and we then ordered the mussels, the chorizo, the papas bravas, the Serrano ham, and the Spanish tortilla.  I literally enjoyed every morsel of that meal.

It was one of the first resautants we visited when we first moved to San Francisco, and it has not changed much over the years, thankfully.  This is tapas done in the authentic Spanish way, not in the trendy wine-bar way.  And it's  a grown-up experience, very different from Las Ramblas or Cha Cha Cha which are too insane on the weekends to be enjoyable, and Thirsty Bear, which is only good if you are very drunk.\n\nThey don't take reservations, so expect to wait.  There is a small waiting area in between the two rooms where you can study the wine regions of Spain on a map while sipping a glass of sherry.\n\nThe sangria is very good, heavy on the wine and light on the fruit, not too sweet.  A carafe is about $20 and will serve 4.  One thing that they do which is very nice is add additional ice to your glass throughout the meal so that you can enjoy your sangria cold at all times - a nice touch.\n\nAnd oh, the food.  Tapas are such a treat because it is like having a cocktail party with fantastic hors d'oeurvres right at your table.  Once you get your order in, things come out quickly and the eating frenzy can begin.  Here is what we had on a recent visit with friends:\n\nTapas Frias:\nJamon Serrano con Pan, Tomate - if you love cured meats, you MUST try this dish.  Slices of bread are rubbed with garlic and tomatoes, and served with wonderfully soft and tender slices of Jambon Serrano.   I could eat this all day long - makes me think of vacations in Spain\n\nTortilla Espanola - classic tapas dish, wedges of a potato, onion and egg \"omelet\" with a ratatouille-like garnish.  Light and fluffy\n\nBoquerones - these are not the salty brown oily anchovies you know from a jar - they are marinated in citrus almost like a ceviche, and are so tender and tasty, and they are white, not brown.  Served with a salad with delicious slices of apple\n\nPlato de Queso Variado - 3 assorted cheeses including Manchego, a blue cheese, and a soft white cheese, served with grapes and candied walnuts and apple wedges\n\n*We also shared a bowl of the gazpacho, which is so garlic-y and wonderful, perfect Andalusian-style preparation, with crunchy croutons on top, like Summer in a bowl*\n\nTapas Calientes:\nCalamares Andaluza - classic fried calamari, even better if you use the goat cheese in tomato sauce for dipping\n\nCazuela de Queso de Cabra - baked goat cheese in Tomato sauce, warm and tangy, great on bread or with the calamari\n\nCroquetas de Jamon y Pollo - I LOVE the croquetas here - light, creamy on the the inside, crunchy on the outside (panko-type crust) - mmmmm.\n\nGambas Ajillo - very garlic-y sauteed shrimp dish, tender shrimp\n\nMejillones al Azafran - mussles in a saffron sauce, plump and savory with a good sauce for dipping\n\nPatatas Bravas - potato wedges in a spicy sauce - somehow the potatoes stay crispy under the sauce\n\nZarzuela is one of those institutions that remain a good bet, no matter what.  They take pride in their cooking and hospitality.  Worth driving across town for, finding parking in an impossible parking neighborhood, and waiting for a table.  I wish that there were other good tapas restaurants in the city, but for me, Zarzuela is where I will always recommend if you want a well-rounded, authentically Spanish, experience.", "author": "Liz S."}

I was expecting this place to be much more busy on Thursday night. By 7pm, all of the wall tables were taken, but none of the middle tables were filled.\n\nLocation is a nice area, not too many shops, but there is a Swensen's kitty corner. I've heard the horror stories of looking for parking when you come in the evening and want to eat here. Apparently, people end up leaving because they can't find parking. I took the bus since I was meeting a friend after work. You can take the Muni 41 from downtown and get dropped off right in front of the restaurant.\n\nThe service was excellent. I only had to ask for water once. They immediately took empty places, replaced the tapa plates with fresh plates for the paella, they remembered I wanted my water with no ice, even during the refills. \n\nThe main part lacking here was the speed and timing of the dishes. I think it took them at least 15-20 minutes to come and take our order. They brought out some bread, olives and olive oil. The first dish came about 20 minutes after we ordered. The second dish came 10 minutes later. The third dish (paella) came another 20 minutes later. I think it would have helped if they had taken our order a little earlier. I'm surprised they were slow because the service was great and they weren't really crowded. I would be very hesitant to come on a crowded night. \n\nLuckily our ride home, was stuck in traffic and running late which meant we had time to eat the paella, although we could have eaten more if we had more time.\n\nOur order:\n\nPaella -- TONS of seafood and chicken, barely enough rice, lots of saffron. Really good, but I was secretly daydreaming about extra white or brown rice to mix in.\n\nGrilled oysters -- The sauce was good, but the oysters had a negative flavor. Without the sauce, I'm not sure I could enjoy them. I love oysters. The texture was pretty good for me. My friend said they were a little chewy though.\n\nFried squid -- Light, fluffy, perfectly cooked. Not much flavor, no sauce or dip. We added tons of lemon to give it a little flavor.\n\nTotal including tip: $60", "author": "Lorrie N."}

The shrimp were awesome as were the mussels, but both seemed to be so small. I know they are tapas and they aren't supposed to be massive but the goat cheese was very filling as was the jamon.

So much so that in the last 7 years I'd say I've taken over three dozen people there on various occasions - and \"when are you taking me to Zarzuela\" has become a bragging right in itself for many of my friends.\n\nI try to make these reviews balanced with the good vs. bad, and avoid giving out five stars unless the place is exceptionally good. With Zarzuela this is pretty easy to do - only one real negative: parking. Russian Hill is a terrible place to park, and you're much better off parking in Pac Heights and taking a cab to the corner of Union and Hyde. Also, they're not open on Sundays and Mondays, so be prepared to be disappointed if you're planning on visiting then.\n\nThe good - well, where do I start? The place is always packed - so prepare yourself for a long wait. I like to show up and leave my cell phone number, then shove off to the Bacchus wine bar on the next block to enjoy a nice pre-prandial apertif. You could choose to sit or (more likely, stand) outside as you wait for a table. Ask for a table in the front of the restaurant - they've recently expanded into the back because of the demand, but thats not the same experience as being seated up front. One of the window seats, if you're lucky.\n\nThe Tapas and Sangria are top notch - I've always ordered both and tried everything on the menu. If you're new to Tapas, they're literally 'small plates' and you order a whole bunch of them and eat them with bread and olives, both of which are provided gratis for the table. My favorite tapas is definitely the pulpo a'la gallega (the octopus), but also worthy of mention are the gambas ajillo (shrimp), chorizo al vino (sausage), patatas bravas (potatoes) and of course, the empanadas. The Tapas is all authentic spanish, and the staff are like family - they'll be glad to cater to your every wish and never hurry you out of there; in fact I've stayed past closing time on a few occasions and never felt like I was rushed. Also, everyone I've taken there has commented on the quality of service and attentiveness to the customer.\n\nI wouldn't bother with the entrees, and I'd strongly suggest going here on a weekday (other than Monday). Also, get here early and you won't have too long of a wait.

The complimentary bread, olives and olive oil was perfect.  I was surprised by how quickly everything came out--I think we were in and out in just over an hour.  We are definitely, TOTALLY returning for more.  SO, so SO so SO good.\n\nThe main room does fill up pretty quickly, so plan your arrival carefully.

From the ambiance, to the awesome host/owner, and the amazing food, this place hits the mark every time. I've never had a bad meal here, and it is reasonably priced and reasonably portioned for tapas. I don't understand the people who go out to tapas and expect huge plates of food to come out at you. That's what's so amazing about tapas! Small plates means you get to try everything! And believe me, I've gone here so many times that I'm pretty sure I have had everything on the menu. My two favorite dishes are the duck dish and the cheese wrapped in eggplant. I know people normally do the paella, the tortilla espanola, patatas bravas and the croquetas (which are all delicious), but branch out people! There are so many more excellent dishes aside from that! Their sangria is decent, more syrupy sweet than alcoholic.\n\nAlthough Zarzuela does not take reservations, you can call in ahead of time so that you can get your name on the list before you even get there. We've done this many times and our wait becomes so minimal that by the time we walk over, our table is ready!\n\nIf you don't call in before hand, have a glass (or carafe) of sangria while you wait. It'll make the experience all the better.\n\nOh! I also forgot to mention! Tell them it's your birthday. The wait-staff will come out and sing the traditional Spanish birthday song-- Las Mananitas. I hadn't heard that song since Spanish class in High School and they were so very entertaining in singing it.

Next came out the goat cheese in tomato sauce which is amazingly good. It's worth going to Zarzuela just for this dish. After that came out the shrimp in garlic olive oil (gambas de ajillo) and the muscles. The garlicky olive oil is a great dip for the bread that you get to start the meal. Next came out the lamb dish special which was served with potatoes and for dessert we had a chocolate mousse roll. \n\nHighlights: The olives that come as soon as you sit down, the goat cheese in tomato sauce, and the shrimp in garlic olive oil. \nDisappointments: the service - the dishes came out fast and orderly, but there was no follow up. I had to wait a long time and ask more than once for a refill of water, our bread basket went empty and our olives were taken away without the server asking us if we were finished.\n\nThe food gets five stars, but the service only gets three. The pricing was also reasonable - we had five dishes plus dessert and a glass on wine each and our bill came to $64.

I was craving Pimientos de Padr\u00f3n.  If they had these and made them well I would have been satisfied!\n\nWhat we ordered:\n-Pulpo a La Gallega: Poached Octopus & Potatoes with Onions, Olive Oil & Pimenton--  This was pretty good, although I would have liked it more if the octopus was cooked a tiny bit less.\n-Pato Con Ciruelas: Roasted Muscovy Leg of Duck in a Prune Sauce-- must admit, this was quite tasty, but I've never had it in Spain before!  Maybe I just missed out?\n-Fideos Con Marisco: Vermicelli and Seafood Tossed with Garlic, White Wine & Saffron-- I finally am able to place my finger on the taste; I swear it tasted a bit like rice a roni\n-Vieiras a la plancha con Romesco: grilled scallops with romesco sauce-- these were good, but the dish did not seem quite Spanish\n-Crema Catalana--this was a pretty tasty desert.\n-Sangr\u00eda-- ok but nothing special, especially for $20\n\nI think I expected Zarzuela to be a little more \"homestyle\" but instead it seems like this place has sold out and made everything a little more upscale to charge a higher price.  Bummer.\n\nI did chat with a table of Spanish guys that claim that this place is the best Spanish food in San Francisco.  Perhaps they've been away from Spain too long?  Perhaps I need to give Zarzuela another try or maybe my search for good Spanish food in the Bay Area continues...", "author": "Christopher W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-11-05", "description": "Like another critic here, I am mystified by the heaping of praise and 5-star reviews. No doubt Zarzuela offers authentic Spanish food, though their aesthetic seems to originate from the 1950-60's. If I were stopping in after a hard day of work in the Spanish countryside I would appreciate their hearty, rustic grub. But this is San Francisco, 2012, and there has been so much progress in culinary awareness and sophistication of ingredients that I try to avoid most restaurants trapped in a time-warp like Zarzuela. As with a number of North Beach places that have been open for decades, nothing seems to change and with a crowded dining room, why consider it? I'll tell you why - because we know so much more now and our palates have advanced. All of this is just blather, however, without examples. Let's do it:\n\n- the bread on your table says a lot about the chef's opinion of what constitutes a complete, satisfactory dining experience. The bread at Zarzuela was a generic, cardboard-y, nothing sort of loaf - clearly, not a moment was wasted in sourcing this lowest-common-denominator example. The olives that accompanied it , on the other hand, were a nice touch.\n- goat cheese wrapped in eggplant: well prepared and the ratatouille-like condiment was a nice accent, but the cheese is what could make this dish sing. The goat cheese we ate was notable for its lack of any real character. Here's a perfect example of my thesis - there are so many possibilities, but they seem to have opted for the \"easy-dining\" variety.\n- pato con ciruelas (duck in a prune sauce): meaty and tender, but with virtually no taste of prune to counter the bland meat. One-dimensional.\n- fabada Asturiana (white bean stew with sausage and ham): the beans soft and buttery; the meat either chewy (ham) or just plain scarce. I would have expected a meatier, smoky flavor in the plentiful broth but what we got was lots of beans. End of story.\n- Castilian style oxtail stew: probably the most satisfying dish of all - tender meat and tender veggies, just like tu mama used to make. Still, we're back to basics in terms of flavor here, which isn't a bad thing, but hardly is cause for a 5-star coronation.\n- sangria: take it from someone raised in Mexico City who knows sangria (yes, it's popular there too) - this was nothing to brag about\n\nTo finish: the noise level on a Saturday night was absolutely deafening; it took 20 minutes of circling to find a parking space;  and the decor reminded me of a Spanish-themed rumpus room with bullfight posters et al. None of this would matter overly much if the food were exemplary but it's not. It's just OK. \n\nIt sounds like I'm a hater with this review even though that is not my intent. Rather, I hope to give pause for thought when someone is on the lookout for \"the best tapas in San Francisco\".", "author": "Jim H."}

I think given the price and its location in Russian Hill, well, that's a rare find. So for that, it is unique. But honestly as the food goes, I thought it was just - ok -. \n\n- We had the Patatas Bravas. It was crispy but the sauce wasn't special. \n- Mussels. About 8-10 of them. I'm not a fan of mussels but tried one just to see... eh. Still unconvinced. On top of it all, the sauce which I usually love to dip my bread into was really fishy.\n- Muscovy Duck. This was my favorite dish. The skin was crispy, the meat was tender. That's the way it should be. Just sad that 1 leg = $9.\n- Seafood Stew. From the main entree size we opted for the stew (over the ox tail). While the stew was full of fish, calamari, shrimp, clam and mussels, the broth and flavors weren't very interesting. I could have been getting this at an italian restaurant or anywhere else.\n\nWhat I did like were the complimentary olives that came with the bread. and the Sangria $5 was very tasty though it was served with ice cubes instead of being chilled.\n\nGiven the parking hassles and average food, I think there are other tapas to be tapped.", "author": "Cindy W."}

We weren't planning on meeting until 8 but I figured I could have a drink and relax for a while. So I sit down at a nice table in the middle and am given menus/wine list. And I wait. And wait. And look around. And wait some more. Ok I try catching the waiter's attention, no luck. So after about 12 minutes, I start staring at the host guy who's literally 6 feet away from me. 3 minutes later he realizes I'm giving him the evil eye and approaches to offer me a drink. I went for a carafe of the sangria which was underwhelming. My friend arrived and we order dinner. I'd just come from a dinner meeting and wasn't super hungry. We ordered the braised quail and the goat cheese in tomato sauce. The goat cheese was warm and actually pretty damn good. The quail was like something out of the bizarro world.

I have an issue with panko. Don't know why - just don't like it. So, I only ate one. Husband finished the rest...\n2. Short ribs - my favorite by far. The ribs are sliced thin (no bones) and came with mashed potatoes. Yummy!\n3. Potatoes bravas - what more can you say about fried potatoes? Can't really go wrong here.\n4. Octopus w/ potatoes. This was my second favorite. Usually, the octopus for this dish is chopped into chunks, which (in my opinion) is not at all appetizing. This version was sliced thinly and layered across the potatoes (yes, 3 potato dishes...) Very good.\n5. Crab bisque - fantastic! \n6. Flan dessert - custard was tasty, but had too many \"bubbles\". Not as silky smooth as I like it.\n\nIn general, this is a great little neighborhood place. The service is attentive, and it has very homey atmosphere.", "author": "Eme L."}

I had not been to Zarzuela for several years, but every dish was just as delicious as I remembered, and I love the idea of being able to sample many small plates of both hot and cold tapas.  Personal favorites include the Gambas Ajillo (shrimp sauteed in garlic and olive oil, served in a hot cast iron skillet) and Patatas Bravas (fried potatoes with a spicy tomato sauce).  We sampled two nightly specials of perfectly prepared cod and grilled asparagus, and a new dish of almond-stuffed dates wrapped in prosciutto and grilled, served in a balsamic reduction, which went perfectly with a warm goal cheese dish we ordered.  The chocolate dessert was simply divine!  Also, Zarzuela's sangria is just right, and they put the ice in your glass and not in the carafe, as it should be.  The service was excellent, and the wait staff has been there for many years.  I'm already looking forward to my next meal at Zarzuela.

I think he might have been shocked of how much he spent on our dinner since he didn't ask me out again.  Lol. Then again I think it wasn't a match for us at all.  He and I didn't seem to have the chemistry going, but I enjoyed my dinner.  Anyway, I ordered the valenciana paella again and we tried the other tapas (stuffed mushrooms again, the mussels with saffron), a lamb dish and a seafood salad. We tried their sangria.  We were too full for a dessert.  Since my date really didn't work out, I really still enjoyed the full dinner since we had more of a variety of food.

They had picked a small table right next to the window on the Hyde Stret side and it was great watching the cable cars go by....  It was very casual and very nice, with the light down low. I ordered the Chuletas de Cordero which were fantasticly good and full of flavor. I thought it could use a bit more salt but since I've arrived in the states two years ago, have noticed a lack of salt on foods in general and thought this was just an american watered-down thing....  The Champinones al Ajillo was also very good, served in a small spanish-style black pan.... by time the food was served, the place was filling up!

Everyone agreed that my tortillas are better but this is a restaurant...  not a home kitchen where one can give more care and attention. The attention given was very good and professional. I enjoyed being in a \"spanish\" environment again and though I'll be in Spain and in my apartment before this week is over, I enjoyed this a lot. One thing I pointed out to my friends was the noise-level - it was LOUD in there, more than in any restaurant I've eaten at while in the states, and I explained that in Spain this is typpical, and especially in the southern region (Andalucia). I had a great time and the food was very good - I would certainly return plus I enjoy having the opportunity to speak spanish again. If you see an online menu, it is not the full menu they actually have at the restaurant....  I intend to return after I return from Spain.

It was a nice contrast to the rest of the hot tapas we ordered.\n*serrano ham with crostini and tomato spread: better than what I remembered!  this is really good with some of the goat cheese and tomato sauce smeared on top\n*pork tenders: good but not great.  it was just a dish with pork on skewers with some mashed potatoes, nothing special\n*mushrooms with garlic and herbs: this was tasty, but too greasy for me\n*chorizo in a wine sauce: this dish wasn't as good as the previous time I had it.  the sauce was a bit thick and reminded me of tomato goop instead of sauce\n*goat cheese with tomato sauce: this is the dish I dream about and drool over, and the only reason why I ran a little harder at the gym earlier that day.  I've only had this once, but I am hooked.  \n*seafood paella: I loved that they served this with plenty of thick lemon wedges and seafood.  It was a delicious entree, but definitely too big for a party of 2 as the menu suggests (unless you ONLY order 1 paella and no tapas, then that is a sufficient meal).  It was a bit under-seasoned to0.\n\n\nFor dessert, we all shared two desserts just to end with something sweet:\n*mango sorbet with a layer of NY cheesecake on the bottom and toasted coconuts and cream on top: this is such a unique dessert, with different textures, consistencies, and temperatures!  Really loved this.\n*creme brulee: too much custard, too little caramelized sugar.  I still think the creme brulee at The Slanted Door is the best I've ever had.\n\n\nOverall, the food was great, our service was friendly, and I enjoyed everyone's company.  Great place to go for large parties or a romantic date.  I definitely see myself becoming a regular and perfecting my personal go-to spread of tapas.", "author": "Jen Y."}

Our waiter helped us with the recommendations. We like tapas because you can try several things for dinner and its not expensive. We had the shrimp dish in garlic and olive oil which was awesome and not like any other shrimp dish I ever had. Crab cakes were also really good. We also tried the special empanadas of the day which were with tuna and were ok- we liked the other two items better. We had the decadent creme caramal which comes with toasted caramel on top similar to a creme brulee. This was a great meal because it came out to about $33 before tip for 2 people and we enjoyed trying different items and not left feeling super heavy or overly stuffed. It was the perfect amount of food.", "author": "Sheena S."}

A group of friends and I dined here on a Wednesday night.  There was no crowd.  If you are planning on going, remember to leave extra early because it is difficult to find parking around this area.  I spent about 20 minutes looking for parking on a Wednesday night.\n\nWe ordered so much food because everything on the menu looked so good.  Let me see...we ordered lamb skewers, cheese plate, calamari, spanish sausage, garlic shrimp, stuffed mushrooms, tuna empanadas, seafood bake, roasted mussels, and probably because we ordered so much food - the wonderfully kind waiter brought us this seasonal pepper dish on the house.  Let me not forget that we also added two bottles of wine to our list; we practically had to roll ourselves out of there.  With the exception of the lamb (only because I'm not a big fan of lamb), I loved everything.  The food was well prepared and excellently flavored.\n\nLike I mentioned above, the waiter was wonderfully kind.  He checked on us frequently.  You could tell he had a kind soul; big big heart.  He was genuine and he knew his wine very well.  He recommended this lovely fruit wine for our second choice and we were not disappointed.  \n\nValue wise:  I don't ever think tapas is really of great value only because you get little food and the price is typically between $7 - $12.00 per dish.  Including gratuity, our total bill came out to about $185 for our party of four.   A little steeper than I expected but the food was good so I can't quite complain.

We ended up drizzling a little of the peppery olive oil over each toast. The \"tostadas\" were nestled around a mound of braised red cabbage that was slightly piquant and just melted in your mouth. Both Ferren and I agreed that it was delicious and probably our favorite ingredient out of all the dishes...it was too bad that  the bus boy cleared our plate before we could finish the last few tasty bites of cabbage...\n\nLast, the Arroz con Leche...everything you want in a rice pudding...creamy and rich with a slight sprinkling of cinnamon on top...I liked how the dessert was served chilled but the rice still remained tender. \n\nI will return to try the octopus, tripe and oxtail...will post update.\n-EFK", "author": "Eliza K."}

We went to Zarzuela after reading good reviews in SF gate, yelp and CitySearch. But alas, we were disappointed.  The food here is just not that good, period.  The service is great (everyone is super friendly), the ambiance is cute, the wine menu is pretty good, but the food is severely lacking. But I may also have my expectations severely high as the last time I was in Spain I ate at some phenomenal restaurants (Butafumeiro in Barcelona is just incredible, unbelievable).  But I have been to many Spanish restaurants in the U.S. which are better than Zarzuela for a comparable price.\n\nWhat we had:\nTortilla Espanola (Potato & Onion Omelet)\nBoquerones con Piquillo (Anchovies)\nBanderillas de Cordero (Grilled Lamb tenders, Rosemary sauce)\nPulpo a la Gallega (poached Octopus)\nGambas al Ajillo (garlic Shrimp)\nPaella Valenciana \n(we had other tapas as well, but cannot remember which ones)\n\nEither things were cold when they shouldn't be, ingredients were not fresh, or the taste was just lacking.  Something was missing.\n\nIt is a reasonable restaurant, but the food quality does not deserve the hype in all the review websites.  Perhaps though it is a SF thing as I've heard the other Spanish restaurant in the Marina is also not good from our European friends.  There may just not be a good Spanish restaurant in SF for comparison, so this is as good as it gets.", "author": "susie w."}

She knew the menu very well, and ordered amazing stuff for the all of us.\n\nI've had the place in my mind for a while, and finally had the chance to go back two weeks ago with my friend. Despite being quite early, we were told we needed to wait 45 mins. No worries! We found a very cute and cozy small wine bar just a few meters away, called Bacchus wine bar, which I really recommend if you have to wait for a table.\n\nOnce inside Zarzuela, we both jumped on their Paella Valenciana. Since that was another half an hour wait, we ordered Chorizo al Vino and Patatas Bravas to start with. Both were really tasty and yummy! The Chorizo al Vino is really good, since the sausage they use is clearly a much better quality  than regular grocery store sausages you find around. \n\nWhen our Paella arrived, we could not believe we were going to finish the whole serving! It was great, full of mariscos and chicken meat. The rice was perfectly cooked and stayed really good the whole time we needed to clear our portions up. Of course we made it in the end! In fact their Sangria, full of tasty and fresh fruit, helped us finishing everything. \n\nThe atmosphere was very informal and casual.

Food commands 4 stars as  well.\n\nThe ambiance gives a rustic feel to it. The decor with spanish bowls, paintings etc gives homely feel. The noise levels are kind of high but not annoying.

There are no reservations taken for two, and when we reached, there was a wait in a tiny room where we entertained ourselves with ?sangrias?. The sangrias were not the best in town, but what followed was really fantastic. Breads and sauteed olives were provided as a welcome gesture, as we coursed our way through the interesting yet varied menu. We decided to go for the hot/cold tapas plates followed by small entrees. My favorites were eggplant wrapped around goat cheese (yummy) and the juicy chicken stripes dipped in cheese and breadcrumbs. Other tapas we tasted were calamaries, sauteed shrimps in garlic and olive. For entrees, grilled sea bass and chicken sauteed in sherry followed. In all, it was an awesome experience with great food; romantic ambience and a relaxed destination, which took us to a little dreamy, cozy villa in a make-believe Spanish countryside!!!\nThe staff/owner informed us about the chef's expertise, who is originally from a town near Madrid and the food prepared was therefore very authentic and original to the Spanish platter.

My friend Joy had been _raving_ about it and I was hoping it would live up to all the hype ... which it did in droves. Our server was super friendly and quite good at his trade to keep up with our hungry party of 6. We had some sangria which was OK as far as sangria goes. We also had the grilled lamb tenders in a rosemary sauce, goat cheese in a tomato sauce, & paella all of which were fantastic.\n\nSadly, I've only made it back here one other time since then. I ordered some of the same things, but luckily read some yelp reviews before coming and knew to try the ham & chicken croquettes which are inexplicably scrumptious. I also had the gazpacho which was a nice starter. I took one of my mom's friends and her boyfriend (both visiting from out of state) and they were pretty much blown away. Both by the food and by the hilarity that ensued when a man eating alone at the table behind us got up to leave and plunked down his half-drunk carafe of sangria on our table, explaining that he only wanted a half-carafe but they didn't do half carafe's so we should enjoy the remainder rather than letting it go to waste. The one sangria drinker at our table wasn't planning on drinking more than his one glass until our waiter swooped in and refilled his glass from the carafe, citing he saw an empty glass an a half-full carafe which seemed like an obvious solution to him. Finally, for desert you should try the creme brule & the marzipan cake, both of which are very sweet and satisfying.", "author": "Todd F."}

To this day, Zarzuela is the one place I can go to feel like I'm back in Spain... if only for a meal.

Some of my favorites: chorizo a la sidra, gambas a la plancha, berenjenas con queso de cabra (eggplant). The prices are extremely reasonable for SF; the wine is also quite nice and affordable.

Never had to wait for a table, but maybe that's just because I usually arrive early by Spanish standards.  Sangria ($4.75/glass) is delicious, as are their wines.  I've never been disappointed by what I ordered.  The server we had last night seemed like he had some trouble multi-tasking, as we had to flag him whenever we wanted anything (like placing our order).  He was very friendly though, and I really can't complain.  I heard him speaking spanish with the couple a few tables over, and that just made the ambiance of the place even better.  The prices here are very reasonable if you stick to the tapas, it only gets expensive when you spring for something like the Paella (which is worth every penny).  Parking is close to impossible in this neighborhood, so definitely take either a cab or the cable car, which runs up Hyde.\n\nHere's what we ordered (all to share of course):\nGambas Ajillo - $6.95: Served steaming in a cast-iron pan, be sure to mop up the garlic/oil with your bread before they take it away!\nTortilla Espanola - $4.95: Four slices served with a tomato/bell pepper mix.

Yes, 5 stars for Zarzuela.  \n\nOur party of 4, which included a Spaniard, arrived at 7:30pm on a Friday night and were told it was a 45 minute wait, but we were dining by 8:00.  They don't take reservations.  \n\nAlthough the restaurant was jam packed with a line out the door, the service was attentive and the noise to a \"minimum\"-- meaning we didn't have to shout at one another to have a conversation.\n\nParking was tough, but we found a spot within 10 minutes.  Be sure to avoid Lombard Street, or you'll hit all the tourists.  If you're absolutely desperate, you can park at the lot kitty corner from the restaurant.  At $10 an hour, it's a splurge, but maybe it's better than walking up and down several hills in the cold after you've stuffed yourself.  \n\nA must have on the menu is the crab bisque.  We ended up returning to the restaurant the following night to pick up something we left behind and were tempted to stay just for a bowl each.  Highly recommend ordering your own bowl rather than sharing for a starter.  You won't regret it.\n\nOther highlights from the evening: \noxtail stew - meat so tender it falls off the bones and melts in your mouth; \npatatas bravas - not particularly spicy, but delicious just the same; \npoached octopus -fresh, al dente and paired nicely with new potatoes; \nmussels in red wine sauce - if you don't like shellfish, order it just for the sauce and sop it up with a piece of bread\nshrimp with garlic and olive oil - so simple, yet so flavorful\n\nWith several other items, a bottle of wine and corkage, we walked away with a $130 tab, not including tip.  A steal, if you ask me.\n\nWe will definitely be back, and if not for the parking situation, Zarzuela could easily become our favorite jaunt in the City for Spanish food.", "author": "Anna V."}

I've always drove by this place and initially heard great things about it.  Although I've been coming across some mixed reviews as of late, I thought it's worth a try.  After all, there's no better judge than yourself, especially when it comes to food (and beverage).  \n\nDo note however that it's my first time here and our group only ordered 3 appetizers and 5 dishes (tapas split 3 ways).  Moreover, I have a particular bias/standard towards Spanish cuisine, for the fact that the majority of my initial encounters has occurred in Spain.\n\nFirst of all, not quite sure as to why the 4-star overall rating (from a total of 435 reviews).  The food is decent.  It's really not bad at all but it's nothing to rave about.  Put it this way, if someone asked (with either enthusiasm or curiosity): \"Have you tried Zarzuela?'  My response would simply be:  \"Yeah, it's alrite...\"  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place neither as a 'must-try' nor as a destination for someone who is looking for a place to eat some good food in the city.  With the amount of food we ordered + a bottle of red wine, it came out to be appx $45 per person including tax and tips.  I can find a plenty of other places to head to for some Spanish flavor (I'll save the names of my favorites for the purpose of keeping this review as genuine as possible).\n\nNonetheless, the decor and ambiance are pretty fitting for a casual date or a small get together with friends.  It's neither overwhelmingly fancy nor is it dull and boring.

Usually, prior to going out to eat I will try to read about the destination restaurant on Yelp. Before leaving the house to 'roam' a neighborhood, especially one that I am not familiar with, I do my homework and pick out a few restaurants that are well reviewed. It pays off! Nothing makes me more upset than spending my hard earned cash at a crappy restaurant. Nothing, I say!\n\nSo...last night, after work and a few beers at the casa I decided to be wild and crazy... I avoided the laptop before we left to explore Hyde street, which is walking distance from our new place. It was a crisp, cool night and before we knew it we were standing on Hyde staring at a handful of restaurants, not knowing where to go. I saw ice cream..I saw sushi....what was I craving? We walked to the corner and saw Zarzuela. I heart  tapas, so we decided to give it a try. \n\nWe were immediately seated, the host was quite charming and our waiter gave us a handful of \"popular\" recommendations. We decided to start with four dishes and it ended up being plenty for us since we totally gorged on bread, olive oil and olives before we were served. The olive oil served for dipping was very nice; mellow and slightly grassy tasting so I was excited for the dishes to arrive.\n\nFirst we had the Salpicon de Marisco (Seafood Salad) which was filled with fresh seafood, chopped tomatoes and diced onions...not too tart and very refreshing. Our favorite was the next to arrive: Rollitos de Berenjena (Grilled Eggplant filled with Goat Cheese). I could eat 10 plates of these thinly sliced, pan fried pieces of tender eggplant rolled around goat cheese and served at room temperature. Next we had the Pulpo a la Gallega (Poached Octopus with new potatoes in Olive Oil & Pimenton) and the Champinones al Ajillo (Mushrooms Saute in Garlic sauce). The mushrooms were probably our least favorite dish; they were ok but not too exciting. We really enjoyed the Pulpo a la Gallega. Our waiter told us that this is a very authentic Spanish tapas dish and that it is very hard to get it anywhere in the city. Not sure if that is true, but I am no tapas expert. It was super yummy, but if you don't love octopus, don't order the Pulpo...it is all about the octopus.\n\nFor desert my husband ordered a really crazy chocolate cake; I can't remember the name of it but it was insane...full o' chocolate, soaked in something, drenched in something else, surrounded by raspberry sauce swirled with vanilla. My usual \"one bite of desert\" turned into five. Needless to say, despite the freezing $*#(* weather last night I was quite happy to waddle home and walk off that dinner.", "author": "Rebecca R."}

I was to meet my friends in front of Zarzuela by 7pm and wanted to take a cab to Zarzuela because parking in Russian Hill is horrendous.  I called Yellow Cab to arrange for a pickup at my house at 6:30pm.  15 minutes go by and nothing.  I'm watching a DVR recording of the Cal vs. Tennessee game (Go Bears!) and don't even notice until 30 minutes go by.  Befuddled, I call Yellow Cab again, only to be told that the designated cabbie must have forgotten the assignment and they would send another cab right away.  Another 30 minutes go by and I am pissed.  Finally, I get Luxor's number and call them for a cab and they send one to my place right away.  As I'm heading over to Zarzuela via Luxor Cab, I call Yellow Cab back to complain and the beeyotch friggin' HANGS UP ON ME.  SCREW YOU, YELLOW CAB!!!!  I showed up at the restaurant an hour late as a result, but fortunately my friends only held the table for 30 minutes for me because Zarzuela has a 'No Reservation' policy.  Needless to say, I won't be using Yellow Cab anymore because nobody, and I mean nobody, gets between me and my dinner!\n\nFood:  5 stars.  The sangria here is way better than most Spanish restaurants.  I should know, since I drank alot of it after my whole taxi ordeal.   Everything here was so good, including the fish of the day (sea bass), grilled scallops, and grilled lamb chops.  The oxtail stew was good as well, but I wish there was more meat (and less fat) on them bones.  We also had the mussels, poached octopus, calamari, piquillo peppers, sauteed mushrooms in garlic sauce, and sauteed shrimp in garlic and olive oil (wish they gave you more shrimp).  For dessert, we had the flan, bread pudding, chocolate cake and mango cheesecake (all were good, but the cheesecake was the best of the bunch).\n\nService:  4 stars.  Our waiter was extremely genial, animated, and comical at times.  I felt like a tourist at a friendly restaurant in Madrid (only with better food).  He was also on point in terms of helping us determine the amount of food to order and balancing out the seafood and meat items.  I'm only subtracting a star for a lack of a reservation policy.  Nobody likes to wait for a table.\n\nAtmosphere:  4 stars.  The restaurant, with its tiled floors and stucco walls, has a very homey, traditional Spanish feel to it.  The crowd ranges from young couples to casual families.  I'm subtracting one star for the families with young kids.  Nobody likes to eat with kids around - that's what Chuck E Cheese is for.\n\nHits:   Chuletas de cordero (grilled lamb chops), vieiras a la plancha Romescu (grilled fresh day boat scallops), torta de queso (mango cheesecake).\n\nMisses:  Parking is a bitch, taking Yellow Cab to the restaurant, no reservation policy.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Cesar, Terzo, Thirsty Bear", "author": "Keith C."}

My roomate has raved about the Menudo for a year so when the opportunity arose, I took advantage. I came in looking for the Paella, but alas, it wasn't in the cards last night.\n\nThree tapas (2 cold, 1 hot) and a small entree for two people was perfect:\n1. Goat cheese stuffed eggplant\n2. Onion, zucchini, tomato \"stew\"\n3. Whole roasted prawns\n4. Mahi Mahi special\n\nThe goat cheese eggplant was really tasty. Easy to eat, and especially good if you combine it with the pitted kalamata olives that come with the bread. I simple but delicious starter.\nThe stew was also very cool. Its more like a marinated veggie salad, served cold, which tastes great. Pretty straightforward, but my gf and I really enjoyed it.\nThe prawns were probably the only dish I wasn't completely pleased by. They come head on, which does not bother me, I actually think the heads are underrated; the problem was the fact that they come shell on, which, to some people might be just dandy, but for me made eating them a little hard. Really delicious though once you battle your way in there -- they had a great rub/marinade.\nThe Mahi Mahi was a special, and came in what I think (almost done with a pitcher of Sangria at this point) was a basil sauce. The fish was pretty standard, nothing to complain about but I think we can agree that Mahi Mahi tastes pretty blah to start with. Don't get me wrong, I ordered it so I do enjoy it, its just more like chicken than say salmon. \n\nAll in all a great dining experience and on the cheap, plus we were treated to an amazing song from Arturro for an eight-year-old's birthday, which was pretty great. I highly recommend.", "author": "Jeff G."}

We love Tapas and frequent Cascal in Mountain View often. I was hoping for a similar experience when a friend invited us over for dinner at Zarzuela.... in vain.\n\nThe restaurant was very crowded for a Thursday evening and they do not take reservations. Since there was no room to stand indoors without getting trampled by waiters, we waited outside for a table to free up. When we were finally seated, it was at a long table in a corner such that the three of us ended up sitting in a line making conversation very difficult.\nWe ordered the roasted peppers, the sauteed sausage in a wine sauce, the chicken and ham croquettes, shrimp sauteed in garlic, grilled lamb chops and a special plate they had of fried dates on a skewer. The food arrived remarkably fast - I'll give them that. However, with the exception of the dates, all the other dishes were considerably lacking on the flavor front. The waiter did not replenish our bread basket either.

So I was lucky enough to visit one of my Best's friends in the City after the New Year and she took me to this place over in Russian Hill. It was probably only my second time I've ever tried Tapas before. I consider myself to be an adventurous eater and will try anything when the opportunity is there. This place had my mouth soulful with every bite I had. If you go here, you have to try the goat cheese in Tomato Sauce, and eat it very slowly because you will be able to enjoy it more since it's that good. The sauce is Perfecto and delectable. We also tried their crab cakes, and I'm not much of a sea food eater, but they were the bomb! Each cake melted in my mouth! Savor the taste as best you can because it's that good! Next we tried the Tortilla Espanola, which are wedges of potato, onion and egg. To me it was like having a slice off a quiche! It was yummy! And you must try their empanadas, the ones we tried were made with tuna and garlic, very D'lish! Their Patatas Bravas were tasty too, which are potato wedges in a hot sauce...Spicy the way I like it, 'cause of my Latin roots! Ha ha... \n\nThe ambiance is lively, and you don't need reservations, but if there is a wait time, it's usually about 15 minutes the most. There is inside waiting down a stoop, but makes you feel like you're in a dungeon! There are chairs outside, perfect to see the Cable Cars go by! \n\nOverall this place is really good, but I've had better Sangria. It was o-tay.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-14", "description": "Let's face it: the choices for tapas in the SF Bay Area are pretty slim, and good Spanish ingredients are hard to find in our Italian-dominated deli scene. As the daughter of a Spaniard, my taste buds have been anointed with plenty of tortilla de patatas, thick and musky olive oil, pimientos de piquillo and jam\u00f3n serrano, so anything sub-standard just doesn't make it. However, if you can't fly to Spain to get your tapas fix, head over to Zarzuela and you'll have plenty of delicious tapas to choose from. My favorites include the chorizo al vino, patatas bravas, gambas al ajillo and the croquetas. As a family of four we order two of each of these, then sample a few others to complete our garlic-infestation quota. Plus, we go through at least three baskets of bread to fill up. The wine list is pricey, but they features some lovely Spanish Rioja that is impossible to find at most restaurants. Dessert lovers will enjoy the mango cheesecake and the brazo de gitano. The only issue with Zarzuela is the parking: Russian Hill residents and Lombard Street tourists are the competition, so plan on walking up several hills.", "author": "Rebeca M."}

The difference in the dishes at the two restaurants was remarkable. (I gave Ramblas a 2 star rating by the way).  We tried 4 dishes, all which were reasonably priced, but I can only remember 3 of them....I usually don't like cold tapas but the the tortilla espanola (egg/potato/onion omelette) was tasty ( and since it was the last slice, we got it free which is always great!), the chicken fried with ham/cheese was good, but my favorite was the sizzling shrimp sauteed in olive oil and garlic.  Wow.  First of all they gave us a healthy amount of shrimp..I believe 9-10... , while Ramblas served 4-5 garlic shrimp that were bland.  There was so much garlic on these shrimp it made the dish kind of spicy...but in a good way.  We went on a Friday night and the wait was kind of lengthy, especially since I was starving, so I might go on a week night next time.  But all in all a great spanish tapas place, I definitely look forward to going back and trying a few new dishes.\r\n\r\nUpdate 5/27/06 - Took some friends here for Memorial Day Weekend and the Sangria was marvelous.  My friends raved and raved...  I also tried the Empanadas (vegetable and cheese) and that was my favorite tapas dish and I also had the ensalada espanola with tuna and roasted peppers, which was ultra yummy.  Try it.

I miss the aioli that comes with patatas bravas and the slight spicy kick. The oxtail was grea (rabo del toro), but veggies had a pretty bland blanched flavor, but the oxtail & soup itself was fabulous.

Everyone working at the restaurant was totally attentive to our table. We took a cab b/c we knew that parking would be limited.", "author": "Kimberly C."}

The place was packed, but we lucked out as a walk-in and snagged a table in the backroom. Gracious waiter, although the wait was a little longer, but I can't fault them for being busy.\n\nDinner started off right with the bread basket and olives. I was surprised at how reasonable the prices were ($5-$10 per tapa plate) so we got the shrimp in garlic sauce, chorizo, and beef medallions in a light gravy. All the dishes we ordered were well-received. We also ordered paella for 2, and it was enough to fill us all up. Bonus points for the waiter pointing out that it was cheaper to get two glasses of wine, vs. a half bottle for the two who wanted to drink. I will come back and try other selections for sure, but I definitely recommend this place. \n\nCost of dinner for 3 w/ tip = $90.", "author": "Reeny L."}

We had the salmon (which was much to salty), roasted peppers (didn't know you could really mess this up, it was just drenched in oil and kind of bland), prawns (got to peal them yourself, not much too them), and duck (the only fairly decent part of the meal which we finished).

We picked Zarzuela after reading some good reviews on yelp. \n\nWe reached there at around 7:00 pm. It was a weekday, so got a table right away. Our server was a slightly plump gentleman in his forties (my guess). He was very enthusiastic. We asked him about a couple of dishes and he described them quite accurately. This was helpful because this was my first time with Tapas food and I did not know what to expect. After consulting him we ordered the Sangria, a cold tapas and a hot one, and a pasta.\n\nThe sangria was very fruity. Significant other is not a wine person, but he liked it. It was little too fruity for me. They have a lots of tapas dishes. Our choice was restricted as we don't eat meat. We ordered Rollitos de Berenjena - grilled eggplant filled with goat cheese from the cold tapas menu. We liked the subtle flavor. I would enjoyed it hot. It seemed easy - I am going to try it at home. The hot tapas was Champinones al Ajillo - mushrooms sauted in garlic sauce. It was nicely cooked but a little bland for our Indian taste buds. Next was Fideos con Almejas y Mejillones - Vermicelli tossed with clams and mussels, tomato, white wine and herbs. Both of us liked this one. This too was bit too subtle but pretty good nevertheless.\n\nI think the Spanish food is a lot like Italian food, only with less cheese and more seafood. Next time I go to a Tapas restaurant, I am going to skip the pasta and try more Tapas dishes. There are lots of interesting ones to choose from.\n\nAs for Zarzuela restaurant, it was a very good experience. The service is excellent and the food is great. If you are looking for a simple cozy place, definitely check out this place. Check their website for timing - it seems it is closed on Sunday.", "author": "SoCal G."}

Go on a rainy week day or take a cab to avoid the hassle.\n\nTables are small and packed together so its not ideal for large groups.

Even on a Wednesday it was pretty full, so there was a bit of an initial wait for the waiter to take our food order (though if you're into rushing in and out, a Spanish restaurant shouldn't be part of your evening plans), but no biggie we were there to enjoy the evening.  Having said that, once we ordered the food started arriving quickly, but not too quickly, it was all well paced out.\n\nThe best part is that the waiter, just by noticing a lone birthday card on the table came out and surprised us with a piece of birthday cake and a lit candle for all of us to share.

The service was attentive, friendly, and made our dining experience all the more enjoyable (as well it should be, such a change from the attitude you sometimes get at trendy SF restaurants). Before we ordered we were presented with an assortment of olives and bread, a nice snack while we waited for our first tapas to arrive. These included the Spanish tortilla- a frittata of sorts, with egg and potato and served with sumptously sweet roasted peppers as well as a vegetable stew. And if that were not enough, the main course- paella with chicken and seafood- left us glad we wore our stretchy pants to this culinary extravaganza. We also enjoyed sangria which, not overly sweet, was a fine compliment to the meal. Our night ended with a treat- the owner brought out a huge slice of moist chocolate cake and sang for my friend. It was a special moment indeed. Oh, and the cake was absolutely pure chocolatey  bliss laced with strawberry cream and sliced mangoes.

He researched this place in HKG and wanted to compare with real Spanish tapas, he had in Spain.  It's at the corner of Hyde /Union diagonal to original Swensens icecream.                                                     We ordered two cold and two hot tapas. The cold was a grilled egplant wraping goat cheese, nice flavor but maybe a bit too much cheese, less would of been better.  The next cold dish was a vegetarian mish mash and was quite good, had the bell peppers, onions, olives, and some squash, good combination, spanish salsa.  The hot dish were some roasted imported green peppers, naturally sweet with a kick of spicyness at the end.  Finally pork medallons on a skewers and a dallop of mashed potatoes, was not impressesd, but did go well when eaten with the roast peppers.  We both had a bowl of the cold vegetable soup, gespacho,  was like a fancy fresh blended V8, good and refreshing on a hot day maybe.  For entrees we both ordered small portions, mine a roasted short ribs again with mash potatoes and his sea scallops with a red pepper sauce.  Both were good and fresh but nothing too spectacular.                                  My friend commented that they were close to the real thing in Spain, except there the portions were smaller and more refined.  Kinda like how some Chinese food is here, compared to HongKong.  Americanized usually means larger portions, but less fine prep work done on the food.  The service was good, our server seemed to be the real authentic Spainard, was friendly but not too overtly so.  The sangria was nice not too fruity.  Overall if you can't make it to this region of Spain anytime soon, give it a try.", "author": "Michael D."}

Since I have been back I have only found one other place (in San Diego) that has a TRULY authentic feel to both the food and the ambiance. This place does it right. I travel to S.F. frequently, and one of the last times I was there, a colleague was about to take 20 clients to dinner at a restaurant that I wouldn't eat in if I was starving. I asked him to wait a minute, called Zarzuela, and they got us the back room all to ourselves with 3 or 4 waitstaff handling our every need. Granted, we spent a couple thousand on food and wine, so they were happy we were there, but I didn't see anybody not smiling in the main room either. The food was VERY authentic, and they have a good (not great) selection of Rioja's and Duero wines. One comment is that I would prefer sitting in the main dining room with the windows. The back room had none, and was a bit stuffy -- but considering our last minute reservation (on a Saturday) that was unavoidable. I would & will go back.", "author": "Robert D."}

I reserve 5 stars for truly exceptional experiences, but this does not mean that Zarzuela is anything less than perfect.  I loved walking in to the restaurant and seeing romantic couples on dates in the corners and hip city families filling in the middle tables.  We came on a friend date with someone so environment was key.  I personally love when a restaurant actually contributes to being able to have fun conversation, which Zarzuela did.  Maybe it was the European guy who had a cigarette in his mouth before he even left the restaurant.  Or maybe it was the perfect timing of the service.  When you order multiple dishes it is awesome when they keep bringing them out to you over the course of the night, like a veritable feast, rather than crowd your table with 10 dishes all at once.  The food was extremely tasty.  I'd go with anything with goat cheese, and the steak and short rib specials were delicious (written with a future diner in mind).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-28", "description": "Came here with friends on the advice of the reviews on Yelp.  I've been disappointed with the Spanish tapas choices in San Francisco since our trip to Barcelona several years back.  This one has been our best experience so far.  I heeded the advice that this place gets crowded, so we got there before 6pm on a Friday night, and it was already filling up.  Table to table, even in the back by 7pm, and very little parking in the neighborhood, unless you count the nearby garage for $20.  Luckily, someone pulled out near Van Ness & Union, and we just walked up about 3 blocks.  The restaurant is in a nice setting, tall ceilings, non-pretentious, with posters of matadors on top.  We got started with a pitcher of sangria, which was simple, not too fruity, with just that right amount of brandy and triple sec...delicious.  Our strategy was to sample as much as possible, so we skipped the main courses, and went for the cold and hot tapas.  All the portions were very decently sized...not huge, but definitely not leaving you feeling cheated, and priced very reasonably.  We started with the grilled eggplant stuffed with goat cheese...tasty, but not exceptional.  Next, we had the chorizo and the shrimp in garlic sauce.  The chorizo was actually underwhelming...I expected more of a kick, but I loved the shrimp...very tender, with fragrant garlic, and they didn't skimp on the olive oil.  Really delicious!  I've always enjoyed mussels in wine sauce, and this was again one of the highlights.  In my opinion, better than at a French place like Plouf...the sauce here was slightly smokey flavored, and I couldn't help but do the \"buoy\" with the bread.  Our friend had a vision of Patatas Bravas as she had them back in Barcelona, with this \"special sauce\", but unfortunately, they didn't quite match her expectations here.  The sauce was pedestrian...basically, just tasted like potatoes to me.  My favorite dish was probably the poached octopus.  I love octopus...raw, grilled.  This one appeared to be grilled first for that smokey taste I love, but then poached so they were so tender...the best of both worlds.  I think this was the favorite dish of everyone at the table...even people who weren't particularly crazy about octopus.  We had another pitcher of Sangria, and then for desert, 4 of us shared the poached pear.  It was pretty looking, but I'm not a desert person, so I had no real opinion about it.  Service was friendly and attentive, but not intrusive, as noted by others.  All in all, we were stuffed and sated, and with tip, it came to about $135 for a party of 4, which I think was well worth it.  I'm definitely coming back for the Paella, and am really happy I took the advice of Yelpers!", "author": "David C."}
