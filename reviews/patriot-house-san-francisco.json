I love bars in SF that are a bit larger that aren't too crowded. Sometimes bars can be great, but if they're too crowded, it can just be uncomfortable to move about or even to just find a table.

The inside is pretty large (second floor advantage probably), with a cool pub-y feel. \n\n(I don't know if this happens every Tuesday, but there was a 30-45 min long fire alarm drill/check that continued to interrupt our evening in intervals.

I yelped spots within two blocks and found Patriot House. My group of three arrived on Friday, March 16th around 6:30pm. Since it was St Patty's Day (well, for at least for me anyways since that was the day I was celebrating), the place was packed. Thankfully, the nice hostess managed to find three seats on the left side of the bar as we were about to try and squish into a tiny table for two.\n\n*Totchos: Tator tots, melted jack and cheddar, tomato salsa, guacamole, habanero ranch, green onions ($10)\n*Potato Skins: Cheddar, green onions, sour cream, no bacon ($10)\n*Beer Battered Onion Rings: served with spicy ketchup ($7)\n*Deviled Eggs: Pickles and chives ($7)\n*Corned Beef Quesadilla: jack & cheddar, habanero ranch, no corned beef ($15)\n*Fries\n*Stella Artois ($8) x3\n*Irish Coffee: Tullamore Dew, Coffee, no Cream ($12)\n*Jameson Irish Whiskey Shot ($10) x2\n*Bonterra Cabernet Sauvignon ($9 glass) x2\n\nWe were here for a good three plus hours, so I know we had way more drinks than what is listed above. (This was what was on our receipt.) A couple nice gentleman ended up getting us rounds, so I don't know how many we ended up having. I just know I was the jameson girl, so I sipped on a irish coffee and shots all night long. The food itself was really nothing to write home about. Just your average bar food. But I could only try the deviled eggs and potato skins as I'm not eating deep fried foods at the moment. Later on, I was still hungry, so we got the quesadilla. My gfs weren't eating meat, so we got it without the beef. Not sure if they put extra cheese in it because of that, but I quesadilla was tasty. Ooey, gooey, and comforting. They have a special patriot house hot sauce, so make sure to ask for that if you want your food with some kick.\n\nNot sure if it was because of St Patty's Day, but the atmosphere here was so much fun! From the bartenders to the other patrons there, we had a great time talking to everyone. I think all of the bartenders that night were Irish, so I got to enjoy their accents.

The joke was on me, though, for showing up at 6 - which is exactly when Happy Hour ends. Remember the good ol' days, when the purpose of Happy Hour was to lure working folks in to throw back a couple of beers on a regular basis? How am I going to merrily skip down the road to alcoholism if I don't get out of work early enough for discounted yet still overpriced draft beers? Guess I have to quit my job. \n\nRegular-price draft beers are $6.50 a pint - that said, the Drake's Hef was really, really good. The purportedly \"hand-cut fries\" ($5) more closely resemble Mc-D's, and probably came out of a similar bag. They come with a side of ranch and ketchup, and generally made me kind of hate myself. I'd pass on these in the future. \n\nThe redeemer of the evening were the Nachos ($8, no meat) - the cheese sauce was strange, but the house-made hot sauce was a great add. The size was big enough to share reasonably between two people. If I ever find myself here again, I'll definitely stick to those. \n\nOur server was incredibly harried - she seemed to be the only person serving and bussing the entire restaurant, and I have no idea why. We had to flag her down for pretty much everything - beers, food, the other person's food, the check - because she kept dashing off after we'd only gotten two words out of our mouths. The last straw was our asking her to take a quick picture of the group - I've met people who clean up roadkill who seem to enjoy their work more. \n\nThe decor was pretty dingy, and there was what appeared to be orphaned toddler who kept running up to our table. She was barefoot and rolling around on the carpet underneath the bar. It was all very bizarre.

I've been coming here off-and-on for at least thirty of them since it was THE place to get a burger and a beer during the Reagan years when I would come here with fellow lemmings working for slave wages at an ad agency. And you thought \"12 Years a Slave\" was rough going? I won't show you the lashes to my ego. Anyhow, the original owner finally retired last year selling to four young Irish lasses, the Brown sisters from Dublin.\n\nI don't think they're a Riverdance troupe, but they could be, bonny lasses that they are and also hard-working.

The food menu doesn't look hugely changed except the presidential names (photo: http://bit.ly/18abQQz). Cute touch but I felt like I was taking an exam and I wasn't passing. Except gas maybe. I tried going healthy and did pretty well. I started with their vegetarian soup, the $6.95 Millard Fillmore's Minestrone.\n\nIt was stocked full of goodness - kidney beans, died tomatoes, zucchini, a little pasta. Some haphazard croutons with Parmesan were thrown on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1CzEplY). Decent no-frills soup. Just wish it was a little thicker from stewing in the pot. I followed that up with the $10.95 John Quincy Adams' Peacefield Farm Salad, which was quite a good kale salad with radishes, endive, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, tarragon and vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/1t9Z7GG). It was fresh and not too lacquered though I think I may ask for the dressing on the side next time. Jamie went more for pub grub and ordered the $10.95 The Patriot's Original Pizza with Pepperoni and Italian Sausage on top for an extra $2 (photo: http://bit.ly/1zFwpQq).\n\nWhat can I say? It was bar pizza. No complaints but not an artful creation either. He also had the $7.95 Nachos which sadly had no President associated with it. Richard Nixon comes to mind though. Tricky Dick. It was a plate of tortilla chips with black beans and cheese sauce which just had to be Cheez Whiz, c'mon (photo: http://bit.ly/1xNAHja). Jamie was asked if he wanted meat on it but understandably perturbed to find out on the check that it was $3 extra. Divulge upfront please. Our Diet Pepsi's were refilled without provocation though, so there was joy to be found there. But I have to say even with the Presidential portraits and American flags, it really didn't feel that different in the space. The wrap-around bar, the dark woods, the mirrored panels and the significant douche factor were all present and accounted for.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pub grub was still middling though the kale salad was a nice addition with a fresh taste\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...still feels like the Holding Company, which is fine with me since I didn't have complaints before\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty good and attentive despite the extra meat gaffe on the nachos\nTOTAL - 3 stars...and I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free...hey wait, are we in Philly? Boston maybe?", "author": "Ed U."}

She gave me the menu then disappeared again. I waited another 10 damned minutes and gave up and walked out. Slow. Rude. Understaffed and unacceptable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-03-25", "description": "Well Bar Rescue, you have managed to mess up yet another decent bar. Patriot House, formerly known as Holding Company, is a sad excuse for a bar in the Financial District. A patriot house theme is probably the worst theme you could pick for this neighborhood - the FiDi is swarming with young professionals looking for unique experiences, not a bar filled with old men in a dingy setting. Okay, so lets get started...\n\nFirst off, WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU TAKE FLAT SCREENS OUT OF A BAR?!  Stupid. Not to add, you replaced what used to be a flat screen with a picture of George Washington or some other old person no one wants to look at. Stupid. \n\nSecond, bring back the old menu with the old recipes. I used to order the nachos weekly. They were large and had real cheese. That is, until the remodel. Now they are the same price with less food and FAKE CHEESE. Nasty.\n\nThird, seriously get rid of that UGLY 1776 sign. It seriously burns into your retinas after being around it for more than a half hour. By the end happy hour, I had the worst headache because of that sign. \n\nFourth, if you are going to remodel, for god's sake at least change the faulty lighting in the corner by the bar. The flickering light is not acceptable for a newly remodeled location.\n\nFifth, where did the wait staff go? It took forever to get a drink. Maybe they were short staffed on the days I went, or maybe the Bar Rescue media attention increased traffic, but that shouldn't be an excuse to wait 20 minutes for a drink. I'm waving money in front of you and you're not taking it. \n\nSixth, get rid of those stupid barrel tables. Have you tried sitting at them? As a lady, it is very awkward. Especially if you are in a dress. Do you straddle the table? Do you turn to one side, and if so, how do you avoid ignoring the person sitting on the side to which you are not turned? Not a smart move. \n\nOkay, I could go on for a while, but I will save my time for better things (like looking for a new bar). \n\nUnfortunately, the Holding Company used to by my weekly hump day (Wednesday) happy hour location. I am currently looking for a new bar as Patriot House renovation has been disasterous.", "author": "Amanda R."}

The place is not its own restaurant on the streets of San Francisco, meaning it is located inside a business plaza on the 3rd floor. The building itself doesn't have a directory and being my first time there it took me awhile to find it. After finding the place, you will be surprised how busy it can get! Since it is located within a business building, you can expect to find a lot of people from work afterwards hanging around, so it can get busy. If you are looking for a quiet place to eat, avoid this place because it louder than most. There is a large bar and plenty of seating which as I said before can get full quickly. Because of this the service can be rather slow and you will often have to get the attention of staff instead of them paying attention to you.

Our group liked Taft's Crowd Pleaser best (nutmeg adds a twist to the flavor, but yums still), I was more partial to the Madison Squeeze (citrus-y but pretty, tasty).  Would order again.\n\nBurger sliders were about a thumbs-worth of burger meat served with sweet rolls (assuming Hawaiian bread).  The burger meat was actually yums.  Will probably order the burger next time.\n\nReuben: toasted bread, decent portion of meat and kraut.  Solid sandwich.  Don't expect Katz or Tommy's Joint style, but more on par with diner-style hot sandwiches. Our group subbed out fries for Sweet potato tots - good portion- and another had the fries.  Fries on their own were tough to eat since it seems like actual potatoes were used (not sure about the actual potatoes part).  Think In and Out fries but maybe two to three times the thickness of the cuts of fries.  Apply condiments - ask for housemade hot sauce - to fries.\n\nFish tacos were decent.  Not much else to say\n\nMac and cheese was good, gooey, bacon-y. \n\nLocation: take Embarcadero building 2 escalators to the top, turn right.  We arrived near closing so the place was pretty empty, but the exterior location had a nice view of the skyline.  Picture spot.\n\nWould go again for some solid and decent American food.", "author": "Vivial S."}

Being a local in SF for 8 years...I gotta say I was pretty disappointed overall. \n\nLet's start with the positives. The sweet potato tots were really good, and so was the spicy ranch. The drink prices weren't too high. The crowd was fun. Cool patio. \n\nNegatives: The young man who waited on us sold us the shots with fire. He said ya we will light the shots on fire. So we were all stoked. He brought the shots to our table and  we were like \"hey dude where is the lighter?\" He informed us that they flame up the shots only at the bar. Sucked. DONT SELL US THAT WAY!! Invite us to the bar to watch at minimum!!!! \n\nThe young man waiter had a horrible attitude. Man it's either management treats you like crap or get a new job! LOOK PEOPLE IN THE EYE!!!!!! It's rude not to. \n\nThe burger was average at best. Side salad was just a few leaves, nothing spectacular by any means. \n\nThere was also a 24-28 year attractive female server who must hate all women. Like a rude little cat. \n\nThe bathroom missed the remodel. That needs to be completely redone. Gross. \n\nPlease change your attitudes. I'm not going back for at least 6 months.

Our server never asked us how the food was and when came out and asked if we wanted boxes I told her no thanks I didn't care for mine and she went to grab the check.

I know that Patriot House had a recent revamp, but from what I could tell, it looks like they switched out green coloring for maroon, put up a few giant TVs, and changed their theme to be more patriotic.  The last time I was here (when it was still Holding Company), I had their grilled chicken breast with rice, salsa, and vegetables.  Lo and behold, the exact dish survived the culling but of course, it's really nothing out of the ordinary.  The burgers still seem to be the popular item of choice amongst lunchers here, and I was told that it tastes just about the same as before. Since work picked up the tab here, I can't really say whether or not it was reasonable, but with so many other options in the area, this probably won't be the first place I'd offer up when there's a per diem.
