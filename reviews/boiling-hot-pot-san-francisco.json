We really enjoyed the numbing spice and used that as our main soup to cook our food in.  The miso was good as well, but the tomato and pickled cabbage was pretty disappointing. the pickled cabbage one tasted like water. \n\nFor our meat option we basically just ordered Kobe beef as our main. One interesting note is that every time we would order 2 orders, but they would only bring out one. I wasn't sure why, maybe because they didn't want us to waste meat which is understandable, but what confused me is that when we ordered it the second time, the guy even confirmed that we wanted two orders, but still brought us one.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-28", "description": "This place seems to be really busy on the weekends so make sure to come early or if you have a big group make reservations.\n\nWe came here for a birthday celebration and had a party of 19 people and good thing we made reservations ahead of time. We got 3 booths reserved in the back and didn't have to wait too long to get settled in. \n\nThis was my first time here and I thought the restaurant was a bit cramp but it is SF and space is pretty much limited. We did the AYCE for $27.99/person (90 min dine in time) and got a pitcher of blue moon. The beer was a bit flat since there was no head in it. They have menus where you pick and choose what you want and they'll bring it out to you. There was a bit of variety of different meats, seafood, vegetables and starch. What they're known for is for their pot where it comes with 4 different soup bases. It's a pretty cool pot but might be hard to share with a table of 6 and one pot. We ended up getting the kimchi, Szechuan, miso, and their regular house broth. \n\nWe got all kinds of stuff but the kobe beef, lamb shoulders and their special beef was all really tender. Everything else was pretty much standard for any hot pot place. I liked their Fuzhou fish balls since it contained like a beefy surprise in the middle when you bite into it (beware it might squirt everywhere!). They also have a sauce bar towards the back of the restaurant and have a good variety of sauces to choose from. \n\nEverything was good but the the soup base for me didn't do it. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be and it was a bit watered down. All the broth ended up tasting the same. Usually for me, a good hot pot place would have a really good flavorful broth so that you didn't need to load up on the sauces to make the meats and everything taste better. I also wished they had dumplings or wontons as side dishes. Other than that the service was actually better than average. The waiters were really attentive, got everything we needed, always came back to check on us, and refilled our broths and water. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience. Parking is not the best in this area but if you circle a couple times then you might get lucky. It's a great place to try with a group of friends.", "author": "Lisa H."}

There were 7 of us and none of us had ever been here, but we're all avid fans of hot pot, so the expectations were high. I'm pleased to say that this place did not disappoint!\n\nThere was a wide selection to pick from - 4-5 broths, many meats and types of cuts, tons of mushrooms and veggies and other add-ins. For the price, you can't beat it!\n\nRegarding the taste, the broths were pretty similar and the Mala wasn't really that spicy, but honestly they were all good. The meat and other add-ins (as far as I could tell) were good quality and it was so much fun ordering with abandon! We tried all of their meats and I think the lamb added the most to the dishes. Re everything else, the best things were the quail eggs, the different mushrooms (quite the selection), and all the different types of balls they had. \n\nRoom for improvement: The timing of bringing out plates resulted in a slightly imbalanced hot pot (all beef at once without any veggies, then a bunch of mushrooms all at once, etc). Also, the suave bar seemed a bit watered down. For example, the oyster sauce was so diluted it barely added flavor. That's it. All my complaints.\n\nEither way, I strongly suggest coming here. In the future, I definitely plan on coming back. Solo or in a group, I think either way this could be delicious and fun!", "author": "Quinn Li O."}

I went on a Friday which made it a really long wait but it was well worth it.\n\nOne thing about Boiling that's a lot better than other places is that their soup selection is much bigger and each soup bases actually taste different. We got the pork bone, spicy, kimchi and tomato soup bases and they were all pretty good. Tomato was my favorite though.\n\nThe food was really fresh. The portion sizes are pretty small which is super useful when you're getting full but just want a little bit more of a few things. Their self-serve sauce bar has the essential although its not the most comprehensive. \n\nYou can also pay another $10 for all you can drink (including alcohol!) They have red and white wines, cold and hot sake and a small selection of beer.\n\nThe only small complaint I had is that they took a really long time to bring out the food after we placed our order (relative to other hot pot places) and they forgot multiple times to bring certain items on our order so we had to order them again.", "author": "Cassie Z."}

The interior doesn't seem very large, and it filled up quickly though it was half empty when we arrived at 6. We got one of the large tables in the middle with two pots, which meant we had the option of trying all the broths if we'd really wanted. For the pot on our side, we chose the tomato, pork bone broth in the middle, miso, and spicy. While we waited for food to arrive, I went to the sauce bar and made a beautiful concoction of sesame, cilantro, oyster sauce, and satay, which I could've eaten on its own. \n\nThere are a ton of options for meat, seafood, veggies, and other goodies like my favorite pork blood rice cakes and frozen tofu. The meat is incredibly thin and only needs to be dipped in the broth before it's ready for eating. My favorite was the pork belly, but that might be because that was the only one I kept track of... In terms of the best kinds of veggies to stew, I'd recommend the taro and pumpkin, finished off with some wide vermicelli. \n\nThe waiters were really attentive and brought us huge portions of everything we ordered, so we never went hungry for long. The spicy broth does get pretty spicy, but my only issue is that the other broths didn't taste strong enough to flavor things like the rice cakes. Still, I left feeling like I couldn't stand properly because of all the food I ate, which means that it's good hot pot!", "author": "Sophie W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-07", "description": "No matter how big your party is, I feel it's worth the money to do all you can eat for $27.95, rather than just ordering a dish here and there for $17.95 each. Just make sure you arrive with an empty stomach, ready to eat. You order by choosing four soup bases first. Three on the outside and then one little circle in the middle which can hold a pork bone soup or beef bone soup. I love the fried tofu skin at Tasty pot, so when I ordered the\u00a0fried tofu sheets I thought it would be the same but I didn't like the texture and it was thicker. I think the only meat I tried and liked was the Kobe meat. The pork belly was too thin. I normally like how pork belly is thick. Even though they had a good variety of meat, vegetables, seafood, tofu and noodles, I didn't really like the selection. If you're a fan of ipot and little sheep Mongolian hot pot, you'll love this place. They even have a sauce bar area where you can mix your own sauces. I just chose to get the sesame sauce which was alright. I did however really love their dessert. Their strawberry snow for only $1.99 is probably the only item I would come back for. For only $1.99 the portion was perfect, and the lychee topping + syrup (it comes with) and snow were very fresh. \nIn the end, in my opinion $27.95 wasn't worth the price since I didn't like the selection.", "author": "Kristin H."}

Make-your-own sauce bar: always a consistent variety of condiments, sauces, and veggies to create your own dipping sauce- chopped garlic, cilantro, green onions, satay sauce, peanut sauce, chili sauce, oyster sauce--they have it all.\n\nIt's much better than Little Sheep where you have to pay for sauces AND they only have a few choices. Where's the autonomy?!\n\n2. All-You-Can-Eat: ok, so this is common to most hotpot places. But! I feel like Boiling HotPot really lets you eat all you can. I never feel rushed or judged for ordering my fifth plate of deep-fried tofu skins here.\n\n3. SO MANY SOUPS TO CHOOSE FROM: this is decidedly the go/no factor for me when it comes to hotpot--is your broth tasty and flavorful? Do I want to dip my meat in it? Yes to both here. My favorite broths are: Mala, Pork bone, Beef, and the tomato one if I'm tryna be chill. The best part? YOU CAN ORDER ALL FOUR. Their pots are split into four sections.\n\n4. Last but definitely not least, Boiling Hotpot has a legit selection of meats and veggies. I usually order Kobe beef, house premium lamb, tripe, intestines, all the mushrooms, bamboo shoots, wood ear fungus, tripe, deep-fried tofu and tofu skins.\n\n5. It's v reasonably priced for AYCE in SF ~$27\n\n6. There's extra seating in the back with huge tv screens so you can watch warriors games while you feast.\n\n\nWhat's not to like?

One pot for us four with four different broths to have so we chose pork bone, miso, tomato, and something else that I forgot but it was definitely impressive when the pot first came to us. I've had this place bookmarked for a while so it feels good to finally check this place off the list. \n\nWe did the all you can eat option and added 2 bottles of soju (mango and yogurt) and began ordering a lot of stuff. So first off, food? Comes out pretty damn quick. Sauce bar? Easy to navigate and kept pretty clean most of the time. Service? Friendly and helpful. No complaints there. \n\nWe were all having a good time honestly going through the food until almost halfway through when the broths started dwindling away and the food started getting burnt. Even when the waiter refilled the broth, the rest of the food that cooked just tasted burnt. And the soju? It's not a bad price for one but I would just skip it if I were you.

Menu options are limited compared to my now-favorite hot pot place (Seapot in San Mateo). Yes, there are still some aspects of BHP that are good, like the 4-broth pot which you don't see everywhere. I find that the tomato broth is the most flavorful one and other broths such as miso and pickled cabbage are a bit bland. In terms of meat quality, they do have some of the best pork belly I've had - so tender! The kobe beef is also good. \n\nNow onto the reason why i'm docking stars. My boyfriend and I used to love coming here for the mango snow dessert, which has been complimentary at the end of our meal the past few times we visited. Now we haven't been back for a couple of months and since we were in the area and craving hot pot, we decided to come back to BHP. At the end of our meal, we asked our server if they had snow, and they said yes, but in order to get it, we had to write them a 'positive' Yelp review on the spot. EXCUSE ME???? I informed the server that I had written a review in the past and he said \"It's a one time thing\". UMMM, actually, I wrote my review free of charge - I did not get ANYTHING for writing that review, I wrote it because I genuinely enjoyed my past experiences here. Needless to say, I was irritated at their nerve to tell me that since I had wrote a review in the past, I had to pay for the mango snow today when it had been complimentary the previous times we visited. My boyfriend and I refused and left the restaurant. Makes me wonder if all these 5 star reviews are from them bribing customers with dessert.

It's a good choice for an all you can eat hot pot.  That being said, they don't refill the broth, they just pour water in it when it gets low.  \n\nTheir sauce selection looks decent to start.  They have two oil based sauces, and their both spicy.  It actually numbs your mouth when you eat it so I stick with the sesame sauce.  \n\nThe staff is responsive and they bring the food out quickly which is a plus.  After a while of dumping different foods into the boil, the top of the water will begin producing scum which doesn't get cleaned out.  \n\nAgain - a good option for all you can eat, but overall quality / cleanliness is not as high.", "author": "Justin L."}

Looking back on memories, this place may deserve more stars, but I'll check later. \nWe wanted to go to the hot pot place down the street, but it was clogged so walked down the street and found this cute little hot pot shop. They sat us immediately and gave us plenty of time to look at the menu. My friend and I both ordered the supposedly \"homemade\" plum juice. Eew. Tasted like watered down barbecue sauce. When we flagged down the waiter to ask what was in it he said \" I dunno\" WHAT! How do you not know what's in it if it's supposedly home made! That was one fail. \nAnother slip was how long it took to serve us. It really wasn't packed that day and we hadn't ordered that much food. I noticed a group that arrived at the restaurant after us but left before we even got our noodles. We waited about 60 minutes before we got our hot pot.  \nWhen we actually GOT our food it was delicious!\nHere I need to explain how hot pot works. \nLet's say you have a large party( like ours). Each person gets a small bowl. In the center is a huge bowl, divided into three parts. The bowl is filled with hot water. When you dip your noodles or whatever you ordered it gets cooked for you.\nOur food was amazing! If it weren't for the two little fails at the beginning, I would have given Boiling Hot Pot five stars.", "author": "Lucas D."}

So I've always been skeptical with all of these AYCE buffet hot pot places as I always think the food quality isn't so good, but Boiling Hot Pot proved me wrong. I brought my sister who was visiting from Seattle and my fianc\u00e9 here. We got here about 6:30pm on a Saturday night and already there is 5 people on the wait list and a jam packed restaurant. Good thing my fianc\u00e9 dropped me off for me to sign in first, and he circle around the block to find parking. I supposed the parking was pretty horrendous because it took him 45 min to find parking but when he finally did we were also seated. So I guess perfect timing!\n\nWhen we ordered our first round we were worried that they might be slow with our second rounds so we made sure to order a lot in our first rounds. The meats were great! The best I've had at these AYCE places. The broths were good too, we had the sour cabbage, spicy hot pot, beef broth and the tomato flavored one. The service was impeccable and they were really great at making sure we are taken care of. We are slow eaters so really took advantage of the two hour mark, but they were very courteous and just reminded us 20 min before our 2 hour limit that if we wanted to make last orders which I thought was a great way of reminding us without being pushy.\n\nDefinitely will come again when I'm in town!", "author": "Jean C."}

But being that it was towards the end of the night, a lot of it was pretty empty. Not sure if it got refilled but we made due with what was there. You basically get to choose 4 different broth options! We got beef bone, szechuan, miso, and kimchi.\n\nPretty standard ordering, you mark off what you want on the sheet and hand it to a worker. We were missing an item or two and reordered during our next round. Had marked for rice twice, and got it after verbally asking for it. Anything else that was missing generally showed up after we marked and ordered it again. Items looked portioned for one individual, which is nice so we don't end up with too much food. Only annoying part about our service was that meats and veggies came out at separate times. Meat came out first, we dug in and cleared it. Then veggies. Ordered more and same deal. Had to hold off eating for a bit to have both on the table. We also had to ask for our waters to be refilled. Workers were on top of clearing plates though, which is nice.", "author": "Tina N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-23", "description": "I was originally intrigued by this spot due to its $28 ayce menu along with the sauce bar which allows you to conjure your own dip amongst an assortment of 10 or so choices. While I typically eat Shabu when deciding between the two options, I do like hot pot for it's bigger menu of meats and vegetables. They have the standard beef, pork and lamb but also have a robust selection of fish balls, fish, tendon, tripe, dumplings  and other speciality items which add different textural components to the meal. The hot pot comes in 4 different broth flavors which also adds to the variety of the meal. We tried the pork bone soup which was good, the tomato soup which was really good, the kimchi soup which was spectacular and the spicy soup which was so intense that we ended up not using it after the first bite. I'm a big fan of spicy food and that mala mouth feel but the spicy broth was so intense that our entire table who loves spicy food gave up on it after one try. Other than the spicy broth, all the others were very good. I also suggest getting the quail egg as it's not an every day item you can get at shabu or even hot pot locations.\n\nThe service was also surprisingly good as our waiter was very receptive and friendly to any questions as it was our first time there. Any requests were handled promptly and they were very attentive to our water and food needs. We never felt the need to order large batches at once, our waiters were always very quick to acknowledge us when we wanted more.\n\nI would suggest this spot to anyone who likes hot pot or even the typical Shabu lover who wants to venture out. The pricing here for ayce is better than other places and the food quality is just as good. With the different selection of broth and food, it feels like you're eating a couple different meals at the same time. Combine that with a sauce bar where you can mix and match flavors from over 10 options, this place won't be boring for a while. I had a great experience here all around and will definitely be back.", "author": "James K."}

That being said, I came in here with low expectations. \n\nMy friend and I came here on a Sunday evening around 7pm and we got seated in 15 minutes or less. The restaurant itself looked pretty small. We got asked if we wanted to share a larger table with another party but we said no. The waiter explained to us how to order and how much the price was for all you can eat. At Boiling Hot Pot, you cannot order a la carte. Must be all you can eat/all you can drink (extra $10). I don't think my friend would have been down to drink, so I ordered a soda for myself. Non refillable because it was a can. We ordered about 3 rounds, but every round they forgot at least one plate. It didn't bother me much because the food was coming out pretty fast. As for the broths, you can choose 3 different ones with a bone broth in the middle. I thought the miso and spicy one I chose were really flavorful. The meats I thought tasted really good in all of the broths. I especially liked the pork belly, because that was the only one I could differentiate out of the few we ordered. We didn't order any dessert, as other reviewers stated that you could be bribed into writing a good review. \n\nFor two all you can eat, we only paid around $75 which wasn't bad. I would spend more at other all you can eat hot pot places.

It's bland.\nPickled cabbage: I honestly really like it. If you like the taste of pickled cabbage, I would definitely get it!\n\nIf you want more spicy soup bases, honestly it's not going to be spicy. But, they do have their own sauce bar. It has this chili oil that goes well with the food and has a hint of spice. \n\nThe meat is sometimes good, but sometimes it's just okay.

We had a party of four with a baby and got seated in the back room where it was comfy in the booth under the window. Hot pot places can get too hot but with the window and door ajar, we were fine. You order your food on a plastic sheet and it's all you can eat for $27.99 per person with a $10 per person add on for all you can drink. The food is good. It's not frozen stuff and the vegetables are fresh. The plates of meat are small so you can try a few types and not waste food. Beer Beef was on point per my friends. They have Kobe Beef, fish balls, and shrimp and fish pastes which the baby liked. You get a pot with four compartments of broths. We had spicy, tomato, pork bone, and miso broths. They were all tasty and you could really taste the beer flavor in the Beer Beef cooked in the tomato broth. My friend really liked the Wide Vermicelli Noodle but I thought it was too chewy though that's what she liked about it. The service was friendly and attentive. We got our water filled and they checked on us often.", "author": "Jen L."}

So my friend and I requested to split the bill in half and we both paid with credit card. We paid a bit over 15% for tips. But when I just checked on my bank statement, they charged me an extra $1.  I asked my friend, and the same thing happened to her. So I am pretty sure this is not a mistake. They probably charge everyone a dollar or two more, thinking no one will notice that small difference. $1 is not a lot, but getting an extra dollar from every bill sure do add up. They are smart, but I am pretty sure this is not legal. This is not even about that $1. I don't mind paying more tips if they deserved it, but changing the amount secretly is just not right.", "author": "Sarah C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-03-06", "description": "The hot pot was decent. They ONLY have all you can eat for ~28 per person (adult price). \n\nWhat makes this stand out from other places is that they have pots that have four sections, so you can select a broth and three other flavoured soups for your hotpot. I liked the miso flavour and spicy flavoured soups.\n\nThey also have a bar for you to make your sauces, and there's quite a lot of choices for sauces. They have sesame sauce, oyster sauce, the asian bbq sauce, and other toppings like scallions, garlic, etc.\n\nTheir food is decent too...but there were more than a few issues which is what gives it a 3 star review. First of all, they didn't bring everything that we ordered. They brought out a bunch of food that we ordered, but they never brought out tong ho which we ordered at the very beginning. Also, my friend would ask for more meat and he was very specific (\"Three more orders of lamb, please\") and the waiter would come back with one plate of lamb or two plates of lamb. This happened multiple times...it was really strange. Also, one of the plates of lamb had issues with the meat. No matter how long I cooked the pieces of lamb on that plate, there was a section that remained SUPER raw/undercooked/red colored. It wasn't just one piece of meat..it was the entire plate. My friends had the same issue too.\n\nSo overall, this place is really the definition of yelp's 3 star review which is 'A-OK'... I might try it again to see if it was just a one-off occurrence.", "author": "Theresa L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-18", "description": "I have no idea why this place have 4.5 stars average, but here is my honest assessment on it, which is far from what it averages. \n\nI went on a week night but it was semi-busy. People were waiting inside and outside of the entrance. This brings me to a tip; do not sit by the entrance. You will constantly be getting looked at by people waiting. They may also hate you because you take forever and orders 50 dishes, looking like a slob lol. Anyways, just don't sit by the entrance. \n\nHere are the negatives of my night here:\n\n1.) Let's start first by the dishes they give you for when you get food out of the hotpot to eat on. It is way too small. Not only that, it does not have a decline therefore, the soup spills everywhere when you put food on it from the hotpot. I am thinking this place does it on purpose. Think about it. \n\n2.) On the first order from the menu, we ordered only a few things because we didn't know how much (or little) food it comes with. Not to my surprise, the quantity was really low and the meats were unbelievably thin. So thin that when you put it in the hotpot, it disappears. Again, the quantity is very low for each dish of food. This makes customer order more food and go through the hassle of it while being deterred from ordering. \n\n3.) When we ask for the 2nd round, the waiter was running around frantically and waved us off by saying \"second order, second order\" and threw the menu on our table. We didn't really care about her demeanor because it is an Asian establishment and we didnt come here for 5 star service. What did got on our nerves was when it took 20+ minutes and us asking them twice before they start putting out the food from our 2nd round. \n\n4.) The seats are very low, it's awkward. It feels like you on sitting on a adult version of a baby  highchair. The table was literally at my upper chest level. It just feels awkward and not comfortable.\n\n5.) They forgot a few things from our menu selection and brought us a dish that we didn't order. \n\n6.) There is no fan or ventilation in this place like other hotpot places. It definitely need it. It feels like a sauna in here. I feel bad for whoever wore their nice clothing here because it will smell like hotpot for days. The front door was originally propped open for some ventilation, which is suffice, but at some point during my meal it was shut. It could be from customers or the employees. I went and open it but a few minutes later someone shut it again. Annoying. \n\nI gave this place 2 stars because the food was decent and one of the other waiters apologize to us saying there were \"backed up\". I understand that but some things were too inefficient. Also, it was a week night. If it was this bad on a weekday, I don't want to be in here on Friday's and the weekends. \n\nThis place absolutely does not deserve 4.5 stars average. Especially not in SF, where there is tons of competition for hotpot restaurants.", "author": "U L."}

Not to mention all of your clothing will smell like hot pot.  \n\nAnyways about the food.  We found that quality of the pretty good, and the staff pretty attentive.  You have a pot of 4 different broths, but personally I think I would have been happy with just 1 or 2, as 4 is a bit overkill for me.  They have a good variety of options and the vegetables seemed pretty fresh.  \n\nOverall a small restaurant to be prepared to share a table or wait a while (or maybe even both).", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Ok, lady, stick to one language and stop testing my Chinese. \n\nOk, let's talk about the food itself.  The meat was pretty good, but like I said it wasn't fresh on some days.   The portions are ok for 2 people for, but small for a party of 3 or more.   I only come back here because of the four different broths.  The spicy one is SUPER spicy.

I heard good things about this restaurant and it did not disappoint. For all you can eat, with a variety of sauces to choose from, and 4 different choices of broths, it was $27.95 per person. And for the amount of food you get, along with the quality, I thought this was a great deal. \n\nThey have a sauce bar that offers about 14 different things you can mix together: ponzu, soy sauce, garlic, cilantro, onions, chili, salt, etc. And there was a big variety of everything: broth, meats, vegetables, tofu, mushrooms, other sides. The broth choices include pork bone, beef bone, spicy, tomato, miso, kimchi, and pickled cabbage soup. My personal favorites are the pork bone and kimchi soup. The different kinds of meats included lamb shoulder, beef, kobe beef, beer beef, pork belly, chicken breast, tenderloin beef, fatty pork belly, beef tendon, tripe, and so much more. Their cut meats are fresh and always cut thinly so it doesn't take too long cook. They also have meatballs, cuttlefish balls, lobster balls, and the list goes on. Having this many meat options allowed the order to be diverse and well worth the price. On top of the various meat options, there were many different types of vegetables, tofu, noodles, mushrooms, and other side choices to choose from: fresh/frozen/fried tofu, enoki/shiitake/oyster mushrooms, napa cabbage, spinach, winter melon, potato, corn, and vermicelli/egg/udon noodles, etc. The variety of choices allows everyone to order something. Another plus is that the portions are kept at a decent size, which ensures less wasted food and allows you to order more different things.  \n\nOnce you have chosen what you would like to order, all you have to do is mark how many plates you would like on the menu with the expo marker. Everything is good quality and has great flavors. The service has always been great and the people that work there is surprisingly nice and attentive. Everything I ordered was handled promptly; so I never felt like I had to order everything at once like other hot pot places. \n\nI would definitely recommend this AYCE hot pot location to anyone that likes hot pot.

All you can Eat for $28 per person isn't too bad considering what their menu has to offer. I love how they have a sauce bar on the side where you can make your sauce however you like and as much as you like instead of other places that make it for you or charge you for it. They also have a All you can Drink for $10 which is such a good price! I would have gotten that if I didn't have work tomorrow. Another great thing I love about this place is that they let you select 4 type of soups to use which is awesome, because you can have a variety of flavors from each different soup to find the best one to fit your needs. Lastly the portions that they serve are so generous, much better than alot of other hot pot places. So overall its a great experience and place to come to for AYCE hot pot around San Francisco! Definitely will come back again in the future! \n\nJust a heads up, I would avoid the marinated tenderloin beef, it has a weird marinate flavor but everything else is perfect! Lamb was the best meat in my opinion!", "author": "Christopher G."}

It is a pro that you get to make your own sauce and get to choose 4 broths (wished there were more broth selections) but otherwise I have other hot pot places to go to. \n\nMy parents and I (a party of 3) entered at around 515pm on a Friday and we were welcomed....but was told to sit at the big table that seats a party of 6 with two pots. We told the server we would like a booth, obviously because we had a party of 3, because it's more family style and easier to share and eat together. But he insisted that we sit at the big table and assured us that we wouldn't have to share the table.... bruh do you know what you are doing? The restaurant is empty but you want to seat a party of 3 at a table of 6-8 with two pots????? What if a party of 6-8 comes in??? We insisted that we wanted the booth and we FINALLY got it literally 5 times later insisting we wanted the booth. Few minutes later, another party of 3 walks in and they were also told to sit at the big table and insisted that they wouldn't have to share blah blah blah but the party of 3 also wanted a booth. I was SO irritated. \n\nBeen here before and my parents and I assume that they had changed owners or something... My credit card bills says that it's called Hot Pot Island????

It's always a plus when a hot pot restaurant does AYCE for a decent price. Even better when the meat quality is good. But Boiling Hot Pot is the only one that does all this AND has a station for you to make your own dipping sauce. I love options and Boiling Hot Pot gives you ALL the options here.\n\nAnd when I say ALL the options, I mean that it even extends to the broths. Not only is there like 8 broths to choose from but each pot can hold up to 4 broths. One small broth in the center and three surrounding it. If you come with friends and can't decide on what broth to get, fear not! You can all get your favorite broths and maintain your friendship. My favorite is the herbal broth (it always is), but I think the beef bone broth is pretty good too. \n\nIf you are early and waiting for your friends, I must warn you that it smells very very good outside the restaurant.

Feel like the restaurant is trying everything to cut corners, maximize revenue, and not caring about customers. \n\nWe were told it's 'last call' an hour after we sat down, even though the menu said it's 2 hours maximum per table. A bit later they had the nerve to ask us to hurry up and leave to make space for new customers, and the waiter made up some lie about the typical max time is 90 minutes. I get they want to make more money, but this is not the right way. He argued on top of that the timer starts when you sit down not when the food comes. Well we didn't get served until 15 minutes has passed.  \n\nOn a minor note, I ordered shrimp the moment I sat down and only got 5 an hour after as part of the 'last call'", "author": "Robert L."}

This place is a 3.5 instead of a 4.\n\nHot Pot Island, sounds like a place where all people do is bask in broth in a hot pot. \n\nTried this place out sometime during the summer last year with a couple of my girlfriends. We were the first group to come in, so we didn't really know what to expect.\n\nPros: \n- Located along Geary by other restaurants and dessert places.\n- Rather than picking what broth you want, you are given the best of all worlds. Meaning, you get ALL broths! (Tomato broth, House special broth, Spicy miso broth, and something called \"Nourishing broth\")\n- Unlike traditional Hot Pot places, YOU are in control of what you want by simply marking down what veggies, seafood, condiments, and meats you want.\n- Nice atmospheres with comfortable booths. They can also accommodate bigger parties since they have round tables. \n- Accepts cash and card\n\nCons:\n- Workers are a hit or miss here.\n- Parking is hard even though you have the option of street parking or parking in a nearby public lot (it costs moolah though)\n- Not a big fan of some of their broths.\n- The quality of some of the foods were superb as compared to others. It depends on when you decide to go here, I suppose. \n- Business was slow despite only about 2 groups, including my group, dining at that particular day. \n\nOverall, another decent hot pot place with a nice concept of giving diners an opportunity to try out different broths rather than being limited to two. The service could use some work, but otherwise, it's an O-K place in my book.", "author": "Jerianne G."}

They have a huge selection of meats, from beef, pork, chicken, to different seafoods, so that was a big plus because everyone wanted something different. The staff was very helpful and polite, even though we were ordering like machines. It's AYCE, so of course you're suppose to take advantage of it!

Yes, please!\n\nI was surprised and ecstatic to find out that they were opening a hot pot place in my hood. Finally tried it a couple weekends ago and it is definitely a solid hot pot place. It's not as good as Little Sheep (but what is, really?) but I like it more than Hot Pot Garden (everything starts to taste the same after a while there).\n\nI like that they give you 4 different soup bases; I forget the exact names but they have the typical Little Sheep wannabes, a spicy miso and then a tomato broth. The spicy Little Sheep wannabe soup was really Chinese tasting, and there was a ton of chili oil -- still good, but not great. The other Little Sheep knock off was okay, not too flavorful. The spicy miso was meh. The tomato broth in the middle was AWESOME. It kinda reminds me of tom yum, but not as sour and not spicy at all.\n\nThe menu is a little book that's been laminated so you can mark off what you want with a dry erase pen. It's a pretty extensive menu with plenty of options, though the quality of the meats and what not are not as good as Little Sheep.\n\nThe server was very attention (maybe a little too much?) and asked us several times if we needed anything. But when we needed water, she stopped coming around haha And by the time we were paying, they were closed and eating so that was a bit awkward.\n\nAs for pricing, it is a little expensive. Between two people, we had two orders of meat (beef and lamb), lobster balls, some veggies and mushrooms, corn, udon and maybe one or two others. It came out to be 28, including tax and tip, per person.\n\nOverall, good hot pot experience and will be back.", "author": "Doris K."}

Their broth choices are rather limited and there's not a lot of different things to eat. Although their pot design is rather unique, the only flavor I enjoyed was the miso soup. We also tried their pork bone (the small circle in the middle), spicy soup, and kimchi soup. The pork bone is really bland, spicy wasn't as spicy or salty as I expected, and the kimchi was all around strange. The meats here aren't the freshest and there's not a lot of options for other items, compared to other hot pot places. One of the more unique meats we tried was the beer beef. We had a group of 6 and it was rather difficult to share from one pot since everyone had to climb over to reach things. They also lacked cooked appetizers, which was a huge thing I loved about the other hot pot places in SF. For the amount of money I spent to eat at Boiling Hot Pot, I would rather wait for some place better.", "author": "Cindy C."}

Pretty standard in most hot pot joints though right? I still remember when the place first opened as hot pot island and they didn't offer the ayce option but instead sold by plates. After a few management changes I believe they came to be where they are now.\n\nThe meats that come out are usually never frozen sitting on the table but already completely thawed. If I were to compare that to let's say hot pot garden that has now been moved to millbrae... well let's just say their food comes out hard as rocks till it hits the water.\n\nSeafoods are usually frozen and their vegetables are relatively fresh. I also personally like their choice of udon and vermicelli. Their rice isn't that great though.\n\nAs for drinks I don't actually drink anything other than soda water and their watermelon juice.\n\nTheir servers are great as well but sometimes slow because there's only about 2 or 3 servers for a full house and they'd bring people from the kitchen to help sometimes.\n\nThe only downside is the ventilation of the place. They don't have vents(or efficient ones) so the place would always be really hot and stuffy but if they were to leave the door open it would get really cold.

At one point we put down a \"4\" next to each meat listed on the menu and THEY LISTENED! What a beautiful sight to see piles and piles of meat on our table, thus killing the need to keep asking the server for a new menu to order more.

For those of you who love AYCE, this isn't the place for you as everything is ala carte.  \n\nMost hot pot places give you two soup bases, but HPI is different.  You get four soup bases in an octangular pot: 1) House Spicy, 2) Nourishing Broth, 3) Japanese Spicy Miso, and 4) Tomato Broth.  You don't get an option to choose what soup bases you want as you're automatically given all four.   BUMMER!   The tomato broth is topped with cilantro, so if you don't like cilantro like me, make sure to ask that it be omitted.  Of the four broths, my favorite was the Japanese Spicy Miso.  The tomato brother was good, but after a while, it made me feel sick..not sure if it's because it was too acidic.  Most places charge for their sauces, but it's complimentary here.  The sauce includes satay, sesame, and garlic.    \n\nThe service was mediocre.

Beef was good quality but not the pork which seems way to thin and small. Once it's cooked it shrinks to a tiny piece.   Selection isn't as great given the price.    Some stuff like beef tendon and pork intestines were cut into pieces so it makes it difficult to cook and eat.  The spicy soup base isn't authentic.   It didn't have the peppercorn numbing affect.   It's just spicy and covers all of the taste in the food.  Beef broth has literally no flavor.  The only soup base that stands out is tomato.

I asked I have been waiting for 20 minutes, can we sit there? The server paused and another serve came and said something about they didn't want to open that area, but will sit us there now. I mean, I am glad they are willing to open it up for us, but wait, we waited 20 minutes!!!!! \n\nSecond time, same situation happened with bunch of people waiting outside. After waited for 30 minutes I took a peak at their back seating area, VACANT, again!!!!! I asked the servers why no one is been seated there. The servers told me those tables were all reserved, but if we want to be seated we have to finish our meal by 8pm which left us about 1:15 minutes. Because I was starving, so I agreed.

Great default broth selections that vary seasonally, and you get 4 of them in your hot-pot carousel (we had spicy broth, nourishing broth, pickled cabbage broth, and tomato broth). Veggies were crisp and fresh, and the presentation of all the food was great. The price was pretty good too, our bill for 2 was right around $40.\n\nCONS: Service was not great and pretty slow, outside of the food (which arrived fast). But the real problem was the quality of the meat... we ordered the beer marinated beef and left almost all of it in the jar because it was butchered so poorly that there was silverback/hard white fat on every piece that you just can't chew or get through. We ordered the \"Kobe\" beef instead, and it's not real Kobe... not even close; it was also a lower quality cut of meat than we expected. \n\nI'd go again for a veggie only meal -- udon, cabbage, tofu, all cooked in the spicy broth and it'd probably be great. But the meat quality was low. I've been to more than a dozen hot pot places in the bay area, and this place has some of the best and cleanest decor and setup, but some of the worst meat.", "author": "Laura J."}

I decided to try this place out a few days later.\n\nUpon my entrance to the restaurant I was greeted and seated.  The Hostess / Waitress seem to have a difficult time explaining to me how this place works.  Probably because of a language difference.\n\nBasically, this is not an \"All You Can Eat\" place.  So you have to go through the menu and use the special marker to mark on the menu what your order is.\n\nTo Start.... Broth is brought out and placed on stove.\nYou get all 4 flavors of Broth:\n\n1.  House Spicy Special Broth\n2.  Nourishing Broth\n3.  Japanese Spicy Miso Broth\n4.  Healthy Clear Broth\n\nYou also get 3 types of dipping sauce:\n\n1.  Sesame Sauce\n2.  Garlic Sauce\n3.  Satay Sauce\n\nMix them or use them as you like to your taste.  You can ask for some Green Onions as I did.  \n\nNext you select your meats and veggies:\n\nI had selected:\n\n1.  Lamb Marinated in Red Wine\n2.  Spinach\n3.  Shrimp Meat Balls\n4.  Udon Noodles\n5.  Half order of Tofu and Half order of Fried Tofu\n\nEverything came out pretty fast and my meal was very delicious.  The Broth was very tasty......(Best flavor in broth before they add more soup to the broth).  \n\nI guess they were watching over me very carefully and being very attentive to me since it's their first week in opening.\n\nThis place is highly recommended especially if you've had the Hot Pot experience before....otherwise go with a friend who has the Hot Pot experience.  The cooking technique, mixing of the dipping sauce and what you order all plays a critical roll in having an awesome meal.  \n\nComplementing dishes and sauce is what makes your meal a great meal!!\n\nI loved how they gave me a lot of Spinach compared to other places.\n\nGive it a try!!", "author": "Alan L."}

So, when we learn about the new Hot Pot Island, we gotta go try try...\n\nWhy have two soup base when you can have four!?  The funky octangular pot is divided into four sections with \"house special spicy\", \"nourishing broth\", \"Japanese spicy miso\" on the outside and \"tomato broth\" in the middle.  These are the only four soup base they have and it comes with every pot.  The tomato broth is my favorite so far.  Their plating is very similar to the Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot.  Some of my favorite items (fish tofu, fried tofu sheet) even taste the same.  Although their nourishing (herbal) broth can't compare to the Little Sheep, this still could possibly be open by a veteran of Little Sheep, maybe?  The quality and the quantity of their food is probably not the greatest.  But hey, at least you don't have to pay for the dipping condiments.

By 7:30PM when we left, there was a short line waiting to dine. Ordered the all-you-can-eat for four; total roughly $170 w/ tip. Overall; the food was good and flavorful for hotpot, and what made it even better was that there is almost an entire page of fare to choose from for the AYCE.  I would come back again.\n\n\n[ The \"Affare\" ] \n4 soups: Spicy Broth, Beef Broth, Pork Broth, Miso Broth \n- Beef Broth was very light and clean\n- Pork Broth was infused with dried jujube, dried goji berry, and ginger \n- Miso Broth was a bit light on the miso taste \n- Spicy Broth was my favorite; good amount of heat without it being overbearing\n\nKobe Beef - Average amount of marbled fat [ 3 stars ]\nBeer Marinated Beef - Tender but a lighter beef flavor [ 3.5 stars ]\nMarinated Tenderloin - Smooth, but probably not tenderloin [ 3 stars ]\nPremium Pork Belly - Much more lean than fat ratio [ 2.5 stars ]\nChicken Breast - ehhhhhh [ 2.5 stars ]\nShrimp - Previously frozen, peel yourself but no mushy ones [ 3 stars ]\nMussels - Previously frozen, but tasted \"fresh\" for frozen [ 3 stars ]\nBamboo Shoots - Whole baby stalks, nice and crispy [ 3.5 stars ]\nSpinach - Just spinach, was clean [ 3 stars ]\nShitake Mushrooms - Fresh whole musrooms [ 3.5 stars ]\nMango Shaved Ice Cream - Light mango flavor, topped with popping bolba [ 3.5 stars ]\nGreen Tea Shaved Ice Cream - Strong green tea flavor, topped with popping bolba [ 3 stars ]\n\n[ The Service ]\nThe service is what bumped this place from a 3-star to a 4-star place. The waitress was very attentive; came to check up on us whenever we needed without us having to flag her down. She kept out water glasses full and our soups stocked to the brim. As soon as we pulled out the menu to re-order, she head right over and asked if we were ready for the next round. \n\n[ The Setting ]\nWalking you in get a strong whiff of all the broths boiling, so be prepared to have your clothes smell like food when you walk out. Despite it's smaller size, it was not feel overly crowded nor did it get too stuffy as some other Hot Pot / Shabu places get. A majority of the tables are booth style, the seats are comfy and they are also booth style seats. They also have the top-30 songs playing in the background, but just loud enough to know that its playing. The ambiance is a bit cozy, especially since the lights are slightly dimmed.\n\n[ The Tid Bits ]\nTheir primary draw is the fact that you are able to chose four types of soup out of six. The all-you-can-eat is worth it for ~$27 a person if you eat as much as I do (which is quite a bit), but you can also add a all-you-can-drink option for extra $10; limited to draft beers. Over the span of 1.5hours we had the service drop off more plates of meats three times. They also have a small sauce bar with about 12-15 condiments where you can mix and match your own dipping sauce.", "author": "Derrick W."}

The most differences to me from other shabu shabu places are: the pot is oxtangular with four default soup base, and you order individual stuff (meat, seafood, veggies, etc.) instead of a set.\n\nWe got pretty balanced amount of veggies and meats and udon, and the spicy soup base was truly red spicy. Tomato soup base was surprisingly good with even udon and was my favorite among the four.\n\nI personally would go to other shabu shabu places if I'm in the mood for hot pot in the neighborhood, like shabu house and shabuway just three blocks away. It just saves some time to go through the big menu. It probably cost the same if not more to reach the same balanced & full level. Also those shabu shabu places have ice cream in the end, which is a big plus to me. :P", "author": "Jaclyn C."}

Even though my friend and I sat in the back, the servers were attentive and friendly. They always refilled drinks and checked if we were ready for another round. The food was pretty fresh. They really listen to how much you want for each dish, the only down size was that all you can eat is about $30-35 including tip and tax.

Gone is the menu where you mark down your hot pot selections with a dry erase marker. Now they provide you a sheet of paper and you can check as much as you want. After turning in the initial paper, should you need more food you just verbally tell the staff. \n\nThey still have their 5-flavor broth, which is really yummy and I'm glad they've kept that! Because it's a buffet, paying is much easier too. Bring your hungry tummies and swing on by. It's probably foggy in this part of town anyway (always hot pot weather)!", "author": "Jing D."}

And voila~~~ you proceed to all you can eat after your food arrives.\n\nThe first time I came here I was like \"Woahh this place is the bomb, all you can eat Kobe beef?!\"\n\nThe Kobe beef here is very, very good by the way. I never encountered it being frozen. Please do not ever complain that they only give you like four to five pieces of Kobe beef each time you order it, you have to understand that it is really expensive and they do not want it to be wasted since they cannot redistribute it if tables leave it left over, \n\nI think their soup bases are O.K. They are not as flavorful as they look and I definitely have had better. But for those who like simple broths with a tiny bit of flavor, then this place may be for you! The curry soup base isn't as strong or \"curry\" tasting as I would like so I was a tiny bit disappointed about it.\n\nOther than that I really like the sides and plates of meat they have, Their honeycomb tripe is bombbbbbbbbbb. It's a lot softer and fattier than the regular tripe. Kind of bummed they don't have lobster balls (orange ones) but their cuddle fish balls are good. \n\nOverall the food would be like a four but the thing that really gets to me is their sauce bar... I think they should make the layout of it better or what kind of containers they put it in or the kinds of serving spoons they use because everything is kinda spilled everywhere, or some sauces are spilled in other sauces. They also need to keep attentive to what needs to be refilled or wiped down. I also wish they had a separate bowl for sugar instead of putting it in a small salt shaker. The sauce bar does not look very appealing but it is a must since you do need some sauce to dip your goods in. \n\nThe interior is really hip because the furniture is all dark and they have a projector playing and LED lights lining the walls.", "author": "Liane P."}

The service was extremely slow and dumb planing from the servers. \nIt was about 9pm when they asked us if we wanted to share this big table with another group, we said we would wait so they asked other costumers if they wanted to be seated on a shared table with two pots and they said no. So it was just me and one other group.... 15-20mins later they had the whole table unoccupied and not seated knowing that there was two groups waiting to get seated. So then we (group of four) decided that we would just take the table since it was getting late, they close at 10:30 and it was like 9;30. Once we got seated they brought our soup, 8 minutes later, they brought our meat. Then I noticed that they've never brought us our napkins plates and chopsticks. So I went to the desk of waiters and asked for them and brought them to our table. All they said was sorry. This whole time we've been eating. No one even shared the table with us. We had food and plates stacked up the whole table and even piled high with emptied plates. Rarely came over to take away our empty plates. Even if there was another group were to share the table, it wouldn't even had fitted everyone. Overall the food wasn't worth the money. It didn't taste good and the second order of the beef was hard and thick. As the plates of cut beef gets worst and worst. Me and my girlfriend had a stomachache after eating from there 2-3hrs later. \n\nTips for the waiters. \n#1 please be smarter next time when seating your costumers. \n\n#2 costumers shouldn't have to go and grab their own plates and utensils \n\n#3 costumer service. Don't argue with them. \"Chinese ponytail girl\" \n\nThat's why you guys didn't get any tips at all.", "author": "Kenneth C."}

And yes, it's kind of weird that they even take reservations seeing how big of a demand there is, but I disagree when people say the service is bad.  The servers are really accommodating here.\n\nOn the busy day we went:\n-Since the wait was somewhat long--close to 30-40 minutes, I asked if I could order beer while I waited at the tiki looking bar.  They said yes.  Awesome!  I got beer and it was part of that $10 all you can drink beer tab\n-One server (not even ours) taught my noobie friend what sauces to use and how to mix them.  She's never had hot pot, so that was nice of him!\n-They constantly refilled our waters and topped of our soup\n-They brought out meat quickly, and we were never waiting nor had nothing to eat while seated.\n-Guy with glasses was really making an effort to joke around and be funny. He might have been the manager? I don't know.\n\nOverall I've had a pleasant time everytime I've come here.\n--\nOn another note: \n\nTo the reviewer that tried coming to this place at 9:15pm when they close at 10pm.

For the price of ~25.00, this place is not too shabby and we'd definitely come again.", "author": "Eva O."}

So my girlfriends and I decided to do Hot Pot.  I found this place via yelp and the wait was approximately 45 minutes.  This place is all you can eat, and its a Szechuan version of hot pot which is typically a spicy broth paired with Chinese seasoning.  They have a sauce bar where you can make your own dipping sauces and that was amazing.  All of the meat, seafood, and veggies was really fresh.  The service was fine, they were hysterically busy but they weren't rude at all.  We tried the miso broth, beef broth, and the spicy broth.

It's good broth, but yeesh. For $7.50, 2 people can have an entire meal at, say, Taqueria Cancun.\n\nSecond, they don't give you very much for your money. The seafood platter has 3 squid, 3 shrimp, 3 mussels and a few hunks of fish. Total weight less than 1lb, I'm sure. For $10.99. That's a price I understand if they had to pay a chef to do something fancy to my 1/2 pound of seafood melange, but given that I'm the one cooking it, maybe that's a bit overpriced. At least it was fresh. A bowl of tendon was $4.99. Really? Don't they give that stuff away for free at the butcher because the white folks don't eat it?\n\nService was good, atmosphere was meh -- 3 televisions and loud clubby pop music.

Parking is a bitch in this area. It was packed, the wait seems like forever when you're hangry.. Actually it was 45+ minutes so it was forever. \n\nYou get a choice of 4 broths, the one in the middle you get to pick between pork and beef then the 3 around you can pick between miso, spicy, kimchi and tomato. I got pork, spicy, miso and kimchi because although my mother and I are connoisseur's of spicy food my 5 year old daughter is not.  Pork broth was not tasty. Miso was to be expected. Spicy was the only good one IMO. Kimchi could have had a stronger kimchi flavor to it.. This one was very faint. \n\nAverage amount of items to pick from, the house special beef was good. Kobe beef, tendon, tripe, beef balls, fish balls. Barely any intriguing vegetables to pick from and very limited if you compare it to little sheep in San Mateo. The hot oil tasted more like peanuts than spicy and the garlic sauce was not as garlicky as I thought it would be.\n\nPrice was $28 per adult and $14 per kid which is BS if you have a kid that is a picky eater. All my daughter ate was egg noodles. So it's like I paid $14 for a measly plate of egg noodles for her. \n\nThe reason why I say it's not \"all you can eat\" is because a hot pot buffet is different than a regular buffet. At a regular buffet you have the food already made but here it takes time to cook and to cool down. The hot pot process is pretty time consuming so you're limited by time to how much you can eat. And at $28pp I want to get my money's worth. \n\nI asked if I could get the rest of the soups to go. They said they don't do to go there. The waiter that understood very little English told me they don't have to go containers when I already saw some soup in a to go container on the counter of the bar in the front. Wtf? The bill for my mother and I plus my daughter came to around $80 which is over priced for the amount of food we were able to eat. Not to mention they overcharged us for a beverage we sent back. Nevertheless it is UNETHICAL to waste massive amounts of food like that. It's like I paid $80 for the food to go in the garbage. At least give it to a homeless person rather than throwing it in the garbage. NEVER AGAIN will I waste that much money on bullshit. The owner needs to rethink that stupid policy of his. I go to little sheep and never come out with an $80 bill and still come out satisfied AND I get to take the rest home. In addition their pork broth taste better than this place! \n\nI'm throwing up the middle finger to this place and the owners policy. Go down the block to the flame and you will spend half the amount but still come out satisfied feeling like you got your money's worth.", "author": "Sarah E."}

The spicy one tasted great initially but got more bitter and funky after an hour or so. \n\nModerate selection of meats and vegetables. The mung bean noodle was awful - you could either get super thick and fat option which was extremely extremely chewy, or the super thin vermicelli which wasn't chewy at all.\n\nThe meats were all pretty good except the pre-marinated beef was mediocre. The only truly awful thing was the house made fish mix. DO NOT GET THIS. It was like a watery sludge. The shrimp mix was decent, so go for that instead. Or the premade balls. \n\nMy biggest complaint - The meats started out great, however as we progressed, they started giving us fattier and fattier meat. At the end, the lamb and beef slices were more fat than meat. So their AYCE is really AYCE of FAT. Blergh. \n\nI had a groupon, and with the discount, I might consider coming back. But without the discount, I'm rating it at 3 stars, and I am not planning to return.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-10-03", "description": "Came here with my girlfriend for dinner for the first time. At first the menu was a little confusing cause they made it seem like we had the ability to choose the broth but they came a minute later with four. Two of them were okay but we really enjoyed the spicy broth. \n\nOne of the workers was too persistent. He came by to check on our table every few minutes asking if we need water. If either of us needed water it would be obvious just by looking at our glasses. We wanted to enjoy our food without being interrupted so often. \n\nThe food was ok. We ordered the Kobe beef, and pork belly as our meat. The kobe beef was in my opinion mediocre. Bone was still attached to our kobe beef slices. How am I suppose to eat a bite sized piece of meat with an inedible bone on it?? Not acceptable. The flavor nor texture of beef would pass as kobe which was disappointing. The pork belly was better in texture, though was not as flavorful as we would think especially with half of the meat being fat, we would expect mouth-bursting flavors to follow but, again, we were not fully satisfied. They have three different ingredients you can put into your dipping sauces which were not special in anyway, bland peanut sauce, garlic and only garlic, and one I don't even remember to write about. Plus they were just sitting out on the table like ketchup which didn't seem very sanitary either. \n\nOverall, service was decent but since this place is fairly new I'll cut them some slack. The ambiance was new and modern, but small AND we had to ask to switch booths because the first booth we were sat at, the booth chair and table were way too spread apart (both could not be moved from their original places) and would make any dining experience awkward and more of a hassle than it should be. Food was decent. We got free coconut shave ice after our meal. Pricey, not really worth it. Well at least not yet, maybe give it a couple months to do some tuning up!", "author": "Neil V."}

There menu changed now since they became a buffet limiting out some of my favorite stuff bu I still gave it 4 stars because the food is fresh. The pot comes with 4 different soupbase, my favorite one is the tomato soup base. There are condiments, some sour carrots, kimchi, and fruits at a table near the kitchen for you to make your own sauce.
