They are often pretty fast with their deliveries even though sometimes they can mess up the order.\n\nThe main reason to order here is probably not the sushi, since it's definitely not the best or freshest you can get.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-29", "description": "Weird, but not terrible. Wandered in because we were nearby looking for late night eats.\n\nNot authentic by any stretch. Walk in, they're talking to each other in Mandarin, a Chinese period drama is playing on the tv, and nobody acknowledges us for minutes as we stand there awkwardly. Ah, my people. We're not so good with the customer service, in general.\n\nToward the end of our meal a loud, pushy white woman (his wife?) walked in off the street and started yelling at the Chinese guy about where's her food and she's freaking starving right there in front of the customers, so I guess it's not just a cultural thing, lol. At first I thought she was just a crazy person but then when she started grabbing plates off our table I figured she must be affiliated. When the guy (Jackson?) started whining about how he never gets to relax or something, I figured there must be more than a work relationship there.\n\nThe Yelper complaining about \"discolored ginger\" must never have gone to an Americanized sushi place before. The pink pickled ginger is normal to me, though I am happy to see yellow pickled ginger.\n\nThe \"tofu age\" is not agedashi tofu. It's a Chinese-style fried tofu (the kind where the breading is a little sweet, not a fan) topped with a thickened dashi reduction or something. Tasted okay, a little sweet. You only get 2, but it's only 3 bucks. 3 stars.\n\nChicken karaage: looked like salt and pepper calamari (without pepper) but actually tasted like chicken tempura. I kinda liked it even though it wasn't how I was expecting. Came with a very mild spicy mayo, but I wish it came with tempura dipping sauce. I don't like how he forced me to take the last piece so he could clear the plate -- I wanted to eat the tempura crumbs! 4.5 stars.\n\nThe shrimp tempura temaki (hand roll) was a hot mess. The nori was disappointingly soggy and not crisp. There was the tiniest cold tempura'd shrimp and a whole mess of fake \"krab\" filler. 1 star (on a scale of 1 to 5, not 0 to 5, otherwise it'd be 0).\n\nSaba ginger maki (roll): the best and most interesting item, though I'd probably prefer it with less sweet a pickled ginger. Mackerel was a perfect choice for the type of fish to be used in this roll. The tartness of the ginger cut the oiliness of the mackerel. This roll demonstrates the whole reason why ginger is paired with sushi, though it's really supposed to be a palate cleanser between pieces, not a condiment. Though after this I might be less snobby and judgmental of people who pile ginger on top of their maki or nigiri. 4.5 stars.\n\nThe salmon tempura roll might have been nice but it was too drowned in eel sauce for me to really taste anything but sweetness. 2 stars.\n\nGot 5 pairs of nigiri:\n\nFried unagi, the most interesting nigiri on the sushi menu, suffered the same problem as the salmon tempura: it was too inundated with eel sauce to have much taste outside of cloying sweetness. I would've liked to try them without eel sauce but I don't like making special requests my first time at a place. 2.\n\nSpicy tuna nigiri sounded really strange but turned out to just be spicy tuna in a gunkan (military boat) style sushi (the one where nori is wrapped around like a moat). The spicy tuna itself was a tad spicier than I like but not as spicy as it can be at a Korean-Japanese sushi bar. Like the hand roll, the nori was not crisp. 2.5.\n\nTuna: meh but looked better than I expected at a place like this. 2.\n\nSalmon: okay. 3.\n\nThe yellowtail was a fattier belly or near-belly cut, which I appreciated. Some places this is the default for yellowtail, others charge extra for \"hamachi toro.\" 4.\n\nThe tea, a little scalded, came in a Chinese teapot. The ticket was illegible so I'm not sure if they charged us for it -- I saw a scribble that looked like it might have been the character for \"cha\" but didn't see a dollar amount next to it so I can't be sure. Water was never refilled.\n\nWith 20% tip it came to over $70 -- more than I think it was worth but beggars can't be choosers in the wee hours. Oddly (since they're supposedly a Japanese restaurant) fortune cookies came with the bill?\n\nThe woman acted condescending that our card was declined, but that's because the bank keeps mistakenly freezing that card on suspected fraud alerts, and we'd just bought an $8000+ medical bed this afternoon. When I was noting the tip amount on the customer copy of the receipt for my records, she pointedly told me I didn't need to fill that one out. Like I'm a foreigner who doesn't know how it works, with my perfect 'Merican accent? Weird to be married to an Asian dude and then be racist to customers.\n\nShe'd sounded like she was hangry earlier and maybe was having a bad day, though, so I let it go and didn't dock the tip for it. She was friendly enough saying goodbye and thank you, luckily.\n\nThat they're open late, take card (albeit somewhat snobbily), and have a couple interesting items makes this a low 3, but not a high enough 3 to brave the parking situation again.", "author": "ben l."}

The tuna seemed like it was artificially dyed pink, the sort of nasty processed stuff. The yakitori sampler looked boiled with no grill marks what so ever, the scallops were honestly a joke. And the \"hot link\" tasted like a store bought mini hot dog, which I'm sure it was. To top it all off the kani or \"real crab meat\" nigiri was so stinking and off it seemed like they re-fried it to try and make it better, so it was over cooked and rubbery while also being rancid.

And they estimated it to be about a 45-75 min delivery which was fine because I wasn't hungry yet when I ordered so I figured by the time the food gets here then I'll be all hungry and ready to chow down. \n\nOrdering online makes it easy to track how long it's been and the girl working even called me right after to let me know they were out of the uni nigiri (T____T) and that they could either issue me a refund or I can get something else so I got their Toro nigiri. And their mushroom wrapped beef, dragon roll, poke salad, and spicy salmon roll. It cost me $46 for everything I believe with the delivery fee and tip. \n\nOverall, my boyfriend and I enjoyed the poke salad and mushroom wrapped beef, but the sushi rolls were sort of below average to be honest.

Once it got here, the Godzilla roll was mushy and both items were room temperature. I've honestly had better instant ramen. The noodles were very gummy and they topped it with a sweet, strange flavored beef. The flavor of the beef overpowered even the miso broth. It was also 50% fat. Upon fondling through the noodles there were also bits of corn that weren't supposed to be there. It is definitely not a place for ramen. \n\nI've read that it is Chinese run and they have a sort of Chinese Japanese fusion thing going on here.

We prepay a $2.00 delivery charge plus tip just so the courier can call from her car and tell us to come out to the street--in the middle of the night--because she's \"not good with English.\" Keep in mind that we had already given them our gate's access code through the app; you need not be fluent in any language to punch \"#####\" into a universal dialing pad. She calls another employee to call us to meet her lazy ass outside; we tell him, \"push ##### on the dialing pad.\" He hangs up, and the courier calls us again to meet her down at the street. We reiterate, \"push #####,\" and she goes into great lengths telling us--in full sentences--she is not good with English. Hangry and ready to bitch at management for sending a courier that is too incompetent to \"push ####\" on a dialing pad but competent enough to use a phone and tell us to meet her on the street, we tell the guy, \"tell her to get out of the car and walk up to our front gate first.\" Minutes later, she miraculously shows up at our front door and says, \"here you go\" as she annoyingly hands us our food. For someone who is \"not good with English,\" I am impressed with her familiarity with the idiom \"here you go.\"\n\nConclusion: The fact that Jika Ramen would send someone too illiterate to use universal dialing pads on a delivery run accentuates how little they care about their own employees, let alone customers.

I stood there for 45 seconds (literally) waiting for service (there was NOBODY else seated in the restaurant) and then the sushi chef finally looked up and mumbled \"do you want something?\"  I'm a pretty laid back person, but almost responded with a \"I did, but not anymore\" and walked out, but I asked for a menu because I wanted to call in for delivery later that night. He mumbled something in another language to the kitchen, nothing happened, and then a man who was waiting for his to-go bag finally walked over and grabbed a menu for me (unreal that a customer had to go get me a menu). I left, but planned on going back after seeing some good rolls on the menu.\n\nWalked in today, sushi chef was again of no help, short, and rude (he's the only person you see when walking in, so naturally you ask him where to sit/say hello). The waitress was very nice. Couldn't speak much English but she was polite and did everything in a timely manner. She actually made me laugh when I went to order a glass of Cab and she politely said \"no no no\" and recommended I order something else. I always appreciate honesty.\n\nThe sushi was ok. Not the best, but very good for the prices (regular rolls will cost you $3-5 for 6 pieces, special rolls will cost $8-$12). The plum wine she recommended was actually very good, and only $4-$6.\n\nI have to say the sushi chef again showed TERRIBLE customer service. It was 8:30 PM when I walked in, sat down, and then 2-3 minutes later two other guys walked in. Same thing that happened to me last night happened to them (walked in, said hello, got ignored). One of the guys put his arms up/\"uhhhh, hello.......?\", and the sushi chef finally said \"can I help you?\" and the irritated guy asked if they were open/could they order food. The sushi chef turned around, looked at the clock, chopped sushi for about 8-10 seconds and then shook his head no. I couldn't believe what I saw, because the restaurant is supposed to be open until 2:00 AM, was empty (only two tables being used) and I had literally just walked in. The two guys just walked out laughing and shaking their heads in shock. That's one way to guarantee two paying customers never return to your restaurant. Unbelievable. \n\nThis restaurant has good food for very affordable prices, but very BADLY need to improve the customer service. The waitress was nice, but the sushi chef was a straight a$$hole (maybe he just doesn't speak English very well? I'd sure hope that's the problem).", "author": "Joey B."}

In fact, every dish was incredibly salty and many members of the group watered down their soup with their water to make it edible.  The portion sizes were pretty pathetic too and I only left full because I polished off 5 glasses of water to counter the salt-lick soup.\n\nOne member of the party mentioned to the waitress that there was no toilet paper in the bathroom, to which she shrugged and walked away.

We got the gyoza which was tasty but it was only crisped on one side, leaving the rest of it soggy and not very flavorful.\n\nMy husband ordered some kind of seafood and noodles and stated his noodles were slimy, unappetizing and that there was hardly any seafood in it (1 shrimp, 2 clams or scallops, couple pieces of salmon).  I got the chicken teriyaki bento box.  The salad was ok, lettuce seemed fresh but was just iceberg, tomatoes, cucumber and the ginger dressing.  My california roll tasted like mayo (not saying it has it in there but it had a definite taste to it).  The chicken teriyaki was pretty sweet and I found the chicken to have a \"springy\" texture to it.   I was not able to eat it (texture issues creep me out in food) but my husband had a few pieces as he was hungry from not eating most of his meal.\n\nWe came on a Wednesday and the place is small and there were 3 other tables filled.  Service was slow.  The employees were more interested in talking to each other than helping us, it seemed.  Although maybe since it was not busy the waitress ignored us so as not to be overly attentive.  When she came to fill water glasses she did not fill them to the top (not sure if it because of the drought in California or she worried about overfiling them).\n\nNot a place I would go back to as I am sure there are other restaurants that do the same types of food, much better.\n\nPlus they are open till 2am and they do deliver.\n\nAlso while we were there we observed the person making the sushi rolls (or standing behind the sushi counter) wearing gloves.  She came to the cooler near our table, got out some bags and buckets, took them away, brought them back, went back to the sushi counter and did not appear to change her gloves.  not sure what was in the buckets and bags she was handling but it seemed unsanitary to not change gloves between tasks (I do not have a food service license and am not sure what the proper procedure is).", "author": "Jennifer P."}

Maybe their delivery is better, it seemed like they prioritized getting as many orders out as possible than getting the orders correct of the people actually eating there. Another couple who left just before us also had a messed up order. \n\nThere's another sushi spot right around the corner (Izakaya), I'd recommend going there if you like being treated like an actual human being. Our mistake was checking this place out after seeing that Izakaya had a wait. It definitely would have been worth the wait, in hindsight.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nSpicy tuna roll,\nCombination tempura,\nHot tea,\nMango ice cream.\n\nWhat we got after waiting for 45 minutes:\nSpicy tuna roll,\nEdamame,\nTea,\nSashimi.\n\nSomehow, those four items (that you can get anywhere and would likely taste better) added up to $30.45 for a measly 6 pc of small spicy tuna, a small dish of warm edamame, bland tea, and a plate of 6 dry sashimi that we didn't order. After waiting for an extended time listening to staff and couriers from delivery services arguing, getting a headache and still being hungry, I decided to pay the bill so I could leave and have a real meal even though I was obviously being gypped. I hope that the extra $10 they got out of me was worth it, because no one working in this place seemed to have their shit together. Maybe we just came in on a really bad night. Don't know, but we won't be back.\n\nIn the end:\n-Slow/unfriendly and unattentive service.\n-They messed up our simple order by not giving us 2 items and gave us 1 item we didn't order, and then charged us for things we didn't order/receive. \n-Small uncomfortable loud space with people constantly arguing over getting together delivery orders.\n*****If you like being ignored in a place with 4 tables and a small sushi bar with at least 5-6 employees, overcharged for a messed up order and medicore food, then eat here.

I reiterate: the staff isn't trying to be unfriendly or unprofessional; they just don't understand you well (case in point: the table next to me told the waitress that the food was delicious, but she \"ignored\" it, not intentionally but because she didn't catch what the person said).

To makes things worse, it took 20+ min to get the bill. In the end, it took over 2 hours and 30 minutes for an entire meal for 6 adults and 3 kids. Again, the restaurant was not full. \n\nThe food here was also mediocre. The sushi rice didn't have enough vinegar and the rolls didn't have enough flavor.

Perhaps it was our mistake for ordering ramen for delivery rather than just getting off the couch and going to a restaurant, but my boyfriend and I were completely disgusted by the food from this place.\n\nRamen: totally flavorless. The broth was, at best, lukewarm when it arrived, and tasted like water with a hint of salt. Also, there was a substantial part of a hot dog in my ramen, which perplexed me, to say the least. The meat was a strange color. Neither of us finished even half of our ramen, and my boyfriend usually eats all of his plus some of mine.\n\nRainbow roll: ew. I wouldn't even eat a piece of it. My boyfriend tried one piece and discarded the rest. Not really sure what was going on there, but it looked totally unappetizing and apparently tasted the same. The fish was sliced extremely thin, and the avocado was already half brown.\n\nDeep fried ham and cheese: we ordered this mostly because we were curious as to what it was, and though it was strange, it was the best part of the meal (I still found it gross, however). For those who are also curious, it's a few pieces of ham with what seems to be Velveeta cheese inside, coated in bread crumbs and deep fried. My boyfriend actually sort of liked this, but it certainly did not make up for the rest of the meal. \n\nWe also ordered some sort of fried pork but didn't even open the container or touch it after trying all the other food and being so disappointed. We are not picky eaters and don't usually complain about food, but this was horrific. DO NOT ORDER.\n\nAs a final note, delivery took over an hour, so that wasn't great either.

Maybe I need to make sure I'm not experiencing the Mandela effect by going somewhere for toro today! I also ordered a salmon skin roll and the salmon skin was tempura battered.

It must have made its way into the batter. I was chewing the food then I bit into this hard thing. \"Great...\" I thought. I pulled it out and placed it on a plate. As a side note, the shrimp tempura tasted a bit funky, like it was old. When the waitress returned with my Francisco roll, I promptly pointed it out. She apologized, but they didn't bother to comp us in any way. Unfortunately, this is typical of restaurants when you find something in the food, but it's unacceptable. We're not talking about bringing out the wrong order; we're talking about a health hazard. Anyway, my sushi roll was fine, nothing wrong with it (though I was paranoid and inspected the pieces before each bite). My boyfriend said the mushroom and tofu ramen was ok. He didn't like that the noodles were mushy but maybe they were supposed to be that way? We're not ramen experts...\n\nWell, nice service, food came out fast, but yeah, super put off by the staple.", "author": "Opal L."}

This is the worst ramen I've tasted ever. The noodle soup tastes are not authentic. \n\nI have been to another place called Ramen Yamadaya in Japantown. This restanrant is  running by Japanese owner. And it tasted very authentic and traditional. It's as the same as the ramen I have tried in Japan. Compare with Ramen Yamadaya, Jika Ramen is nothing. It is not made by real pork soup but actually some powder. It's artificial and unhealthy.", "author": "Jessy L."}

I ordered delivery since I loved the Chinese joint that used to occupy the storefront, hoping that their chow mein would still be excellent. Not the case. not the standard chow mein noodles, which is not bad per se, just unexpected. what WAS bad though, was the fact that the skin of the onion made it into the food. California rolls were decent, but miso/salad/teriyaki chicken were not worth the price. I would order again if nothing else were open.", "author": "Josh R."}

I am sashimi fan and this is cheaper than order restaurant, especially sashimi.  BUT!!!!  Sashimi is very thin and not fresh at all.   Although it is just 23 dollar for 20 pcs assorted sashimi, I don't think it worth with it.  DO NOT check the sashimi photo that other people posted.  You will know it is totally different thing.  Or maybe it is just for me, shouldn't crave with sashimi in the afternoon and midnight.", "author": "Tissuebabee S."}

The fish has always been fresh and tasty and the food is great for the price. Oh! They put enoki mushrooms in the miso! \n\nWhen I sat down and ate there, my experience wasn't quite as good. I ordered a hot sake, two rolls and three nigiri. I was a little concerned because my waitress didn't recognize any of the sushi I ordered, and I had to point to each thing in the menu. About ten minutes later she came back with one roll and one nigiri packaged to go, and my check. I tried to ask her about the hot sake and the rest of my order, and she just said yes and pointed to my order of ebi. I gave up and went home. Not a big deal, but I'm glad I wasn't on a date. \n\nI will definitely keep ordering delivery from here, but I'm not sure I'll go back for a sit down.", "author": "Fiona F."}

We told grub hub and they called five times and couldn't get to talk to a manager. I would never order from this place again and I recommend that you don't waste your money. You will NOT be happy.

The food was ok, but the server was very slow, did not paid much attention to us. The other server or helper was very rude. He brought to our table one of our dish we have ordered with such an attitude that shocked us. Then we spend probably 15 minutes if waiting to make our server charged us and when he appear to the table to grab our credit card, he was on his cell which is really Rudy to the guest-us! The place look like a old place that was in business over 10 years, I wish they updated and make sure the place is clean and NO FLYES flying around. So sad that this \"new\" place is dead to us.

We decided to come here since it took us forever to find parking by Genki Ramen in Geary and it was way easier by this place. I ordered the grilled pork and stir fry veggies and he ordered the shrimp tempura ramen. My boyfriend said that the ramen wasn't bad and my dish was pretty decent as well however a bit on the oily side. On that very day after we left, my boyfriend had to go to the bathroom instantly and I thought it was just a normal thing. The next day he was hit with food poisoning. He had the bad case of diarrhea and even noticed blood in his stool after throwing up twice. The whole day he wouldn't stop going to the bathroom. I would not recommend this place and should have never came here when I saw they didn't have such good ratings already.

Many people actually do take out here. The food is very bland and not made well here. I ordered the combo with pork katsu and unagi rice. The pork katsu was soo tough and dry, it was deifinitely over cooked. Also the unagi rice is not slices of unagi over white rice, it is chinese fried rice with unagi bits in it. Did not taste good. My friend ordered an egg side dish which was supposed to be soft boiled. When it came out, the egg was not seasoned at all and was hardboiled rock solid. They don't even know how to boil eggs correctly.  \n\nService was good but slow. They are definitely understaffed. The kitchen is also understaffed because it took everyone at least 30 minutes to get their food. I think this place really tries to be good with the nice menus and decor. But they just don't know how to run a restaurant business. 2 stars because they really try but the skill is just not there.", "author": "Cecile S."}

Details: I ordered Baked Oysters from the appetizer section five minutes after we sat down. Ten minutes later I ordered Hot Spicy Vegetarian Kimchee Ramen (kimchi misspelled on their menu) and my wife ordered Hokkaido Scallops Ramen. My ramen arrived in 15 minutes and I thought I smelled dirty mop, I've mopped a lot of floors, I know what it smells like. I picked up my fork and took a few bites of the warm food and realized that there was a film of something, like grease, on the underside of the fork. I put the folk down and continued with chop sticks. My wife gave me her fork after saying it was dirty too. My ramen was tasteless. The \"kimchee\", of course, had some spice. There were a few under-cooked broccoli florets, unevenly cut cubes of tofu and some other stuff. The liquid had no flavor, it wasn't salted or anything else added. I stopped eating and told my wife the Baked Oysters were probably not coming and that's good because there is \"no way that four baked oysters ordered for appetizer should take 30+ minutes\". A few minutes later my wife said \"oysters are coming\". I did not have the guts to take a picture and I certainly did not try one. I almost did but I couldn't do it. In hindsight the waitress told me the story of the new Chinese owners and added \"Sushi was easy to make, that's why they bought a Japanese restaurant.\" My reply was \"That's really interesting.\" I should have walked out then. Normally I would go back again and try something else but I have a bad taste in my mouth so I won't do it. There are better restaurants around the corner on Judah, what a pity.", "author": "Mike S."}
