It's dimly lit, but there's a lot of seating both at the bar itself and towards the back, where there are comfy lounges. The leather-bound menu was also very cute, with extensive pages of drinks. \n\nI ordered a lime in da cocunut, made with reyka vodka, coconut lychee milk, citrus, and topped off with salted pistachios. An absolutely delicious drink that didn't taste strong at all. I savored each sip. However, the entire glass was filled with little chunks of ice--not the normal cube shaped ones that allow more liquid to permeate through the empty spaces. These little ice chunks fit tightly together, meaning that though the glass was very tall, there was actually very little of the drink inside. It's a pretty big complaint I have, especially since I paid about $16 for the drink after tax/tips. Taste wise, however, this drink was perfect for me. \n\nMy friend ordered the thrilla in Manila, made with Evan Williams bourbon, shiso, calamansi, coconute, absinthe, and li-hing mui. It was a fruity drink that also tasted good. \n\nAll in all, a nice place to go for delicious tasting alcoholic drinks. It's a nice place to kick back and relax. The staff were very welcoming and nice. They allow you to go next door to Hogwash (a pub) and order food and bring it to the bar, as this bar itself does not serve any food.", "author": "Karen Y."}

For the first two reasons, there usually isn't a time when PCH isn't packed after work hours. It can be a little chaotic trying to get the bartender's attention to place your drink order, but if you're able to secure a table in the back, the rest of your evening will be a lot less stressful. With a table and/or seat, somebody will come over to take your drink order, and you can now order food and not have to juggle a plate and a cocktail between your two hands. Whew.\n\nAs it's been a while since I've gone to PCH, I can't remember the exact drink I ordered. However, I do recall that PCH has a very expansive menu that's sorted by liquor. No matter what your preference is, I'm sure PCH will have a cocktail for you. I always opt for the drinks that include some sort of spicy element and I definitely was able to find something on the menu that fit the bill. If you have a friend who's visiting from out of town, I'd recommend taking them over to check out PCH (maybe go before dinner when it's likely to be less crowded). It's super close to Union Square/BART, and it has a lot of elements that popular bars in SF have these days.", "author": "Austin W."}

If you come and there are no more seats at the bar, I believe there are tables further down inside. \n\nThe Thrilla in Manila was really good! However, depending on your preference I did not find my drink to be particularly strong. Instead, it was very sweet and heavy on the coconut flavor. Considering I was drinking on an empty stomach and left without a buzz, I am positive that there was no alcohol in my drink! \n\nThis place has great reviews and came highly recommended to me, so despite their drinks being weaker, I want to come back and try their other creatively named cocktails.

This place does a great job with mixing a variation of ingredients from South American spices, Asian ingredients, and SF style creations. \n\nI'd like to give Francis a huge shout out for taking good care of me and my company. He is everything a bartender should be. He's skilled, knowledgable, swift and super attentive.This guy is knocking down a couple drinks while taking down orders down the line. He's top notch. Me, my cousin and friend basically stayed here for 2 hrs last night. From 4pm-6pm ish. We had around five drinks including some shots. \n\nLast night was their showcasing of their holiday menu which contained about 15 cocktails all within the holiday category. They had mixes from egg yolk, nutmeg, Mexican chocolate, peppermint to even gingerbread whiskey. I also had to order their special which was a Kung Fu Pandan. If you know what pandan is and taste like, then I totally recommend this!!! So far my favorite mix. Drinks range from $10-$15 which is typical SF cocktail prices. This is the only bar up to date where the ingredients & mixes are different and truly out of this world in terms of creativity. \n\nThis place can get packed quick (within the opening hour) so I totally recommend arriving early and grabbing a seat at the bar. Last night they had classic holiday music, lights hanging everywhere, Christmas decor, and even the bartenders were decked in holiday clothing.

I decided on the Tuk Tuk Tea, which is basically alcoholic Thai tea. I'm not usually a fan of Thai tea, but it sounded like a delicious combination of ingredients... and it was. Super strong, flavorful, and beautifully presented. How can you turn down scotch, cognac, laphroaig, honey, thai tea, and cream?\n\nLike I said, I wasn't here for very long, but I'd love to come back to try more of their cocktails.

From the gentleman at the door to the servers and bartenders, everyone was tremendously nice and welcoming. The decor was great. They have a cool wall painted in the style of airport suitcase tags that also include recipes for transitional drinks from those countries. \n\nIn terms of the actual drinks, there was a variety to choose from that is appealing whether you like a more intricate cocktail or a classic old fashioned. \n\nI don't think I've ever had better cocktails. The Return of the Mack was my favourite. It is a tequila, mezcal based drink that also includes an egg white foam on top. Each sip was bursting with new flavours while not being too much at the same time.\nSilk Road was another fantastic drink that was a little more on the fruity side. We had four drinks and based on that sample, I think they don't have a bad drink on the menu. \n\nA pineapple is definitely the international sign of hospitality.", "author": "Mati K."}

It was still well-made, and I'm sure others w/ an affinity for sweet and spicy would have enjoyed it. \n\nAmbiance was a bit bustling, and it was pretty loud inside with minimal seating.

I came in and asked Ann Marie if she had one on her menu and she said no but \"I'd be happy to make an in house one for you.\"  I was sold. Being a full mixology bar with fresh ingredients, in house made syrups and tinctures she concocted a sangria and we played around with the ingredients and eventually found the one that I wanted. An expertly maintained and run bar which focuses on attention to detail, which in any industry, leads you to become the best of the best. \n\nIf your into intricately crafted cocktails, and a good atmosphere: good lighting, good music pretty much everything that touches your senses, this is the place.

I tried quite a few drinks actually... As a group of 6, we each tried something different so I got to sample quite a few.\n\nOne of my favorites was the Do Re Mi with rose syrup, and it comes with an adorable mini clothespin + herbs.  Would definitely recommend this!  You can't really go wrong with any of the cocktails, they're all super well done and taste good.\n\nEven on a Friday night around 9PM we were able to get a table for 6 people without hardly waiting.  The waiters do a stellar job at trying to find your party a table and letting you know when tables open up.  Considering this is a bar and not a restaurant - I found this especially considerate.  \n\nThe place is pretty small and gets very loud.  You pretty much have to yell to be able to talk to each other, so don't plan on having some deep intimate conversation.

Based on the reviews, Pacific Cocktail Haven (PCH) was a no brainer. And shocked that it was right next to Hogwash - I had definitely walked past this place before so glad I could finally go inside.\n\nThe decor isn't going to blow anyone away - it's very similar to a lot of the modern cocktail bars - a slightly industrial vibe with the exposed metal beams; a long gorgeous bar, and some cool seats in the back for groups or dates that got lucky on their timing. \n\nI arrived a bit before my date and had a chance to look over the menu and understand why the place was packed before 7 on a Sunday. They have a solid happy hour menu until 7 every day. \n\nBut beyond the HH menu, the menu is diverse but organized by spirit. There is a page for Agave beverages, multiple rum pages, a few with Whisk(e)y. What I really loved was some of the names like Simple Jack, Ultra Magnus (I'm a Transformers geek so debated getting this just out of the name). Also they have pictures of all the cocktails next to the drink to prepare you for what you are getting. I ended up with the Shizzle My Nizzle but substituted Mezcal. It was a great smokey, sweet, citrusy, and spicy cocktail - which is what I want out of my mezcal cocktails. \n\nThe service was solid, with two bar tenders handing out the menu the second you walk in, and a server helping those at the tables or back seating area. Prices were okay - $14 per cocktail, but they don't skimp here.\n\nSo if in the area and looking for a solid craft cocktail on a date or meeting with friends, can highly recommend PCH.", "author": "Michael C."}

It got crowded pretty quickly so I stood sandwiched in between others in front of the bar, but I don't regret coming at all. \n\nKung Fu Pandan - whisky-based cocktail that's a special on the board, not in the menu. This was my favorite - if you like pandan, then you'll love this too. It has a slightly savory yet sweet finish. \n\nMiso Old-Fashioned - miso-butter rum, pommeau & bitters. This had a unique umami twist to it that came through without being overpowered by the alcohol.\n\nThrilla in Manilla - shiso, calamansi, coconut, absinthe, li-hing mui, bourbon. If you don't like cocktails that taste like alcohol, this is for you. The best part was the sprinkling of li-hing mui powder on top, which gave me intense nostalgia to my time in Hawaii, but that's another story. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend PCH if you're in town.", "author": "Jen L."}

The front section is dominated by a sparkly, inviting bar with a wall of attractive alcohol climbing to the rafters.  Friends of mine installed a similar bar-wall in their kitchen area and PCH's could've been the inspiration.  Alcohol bottles can be things of beauty.  \n\nThe back half of PCH is dimly lit and filled with tables and seemingly where you should go if you've planned a clandestine tete-a-tete.  The front of house was far more inviting to me but then, I wasn't in hiding.  \n\nPCH has an extensive cocktail menu that hits upon all genres, further masking the tiki-whispering influence.  Look closely though, and you'll find the rum-based drinks and even a couple of $60 punches which serve 6 - 8 people.  They look nothing like those flaming things served in a coconut but they're \"punch\", which is a nod in that direction.\n\nNo food is being prepared at PCH but if you need something with which to sop up that punch indulgence you can order in from next door neighbor, Hogwash.   \n\nWatching the bartenders do their magic I regretted that I was only up for wine.

It was dazzled with a dried pineapple on the top of the glass and it's refreshing and vey tropical flavor.  My least favorite of the night is probably the whiskey highball among the 5 drinks I tried.

After a late dinner, we were wandering around the area and stumbled onto this place. The first thing you walk into is the well-stocked bar with seats that leads onto another large and dark seating area which is kind of shabby looking. A ramp leads to the questionable bathroom. There's also a set of stairs that leads down to another area, but it was closed off, so we'll be back to check it out. There's a yellow neon P.C.H. sign, and the rest is typical SF bar decor. The ambiance is lively with a younger crowd.\n\nThe menu is large with cheesy puns for cocktail names. They also have a few specials on the board. All the cocktails sound like they have too many ingredients, but they're actually pretty amazing and are designed well. We tried the Lime in the Coconut, Kung Fu Pandan, and some Kavalan. The cocktails take a while to make, but they're truly a labor of love. The bartenders are seasoned and professional in demeanor. \n\nThe cocktails were well balanced - you could very subtly taste the base alcohol while well-placed accents danced around with every sip. The coconut drink was finished off with lime zest and coconut shavings that smelled refreshing as you sipped. The pandan drink was slightly salty and sweet with a delicate flavor of burnt pandan. I eyed some Kavalan on the top shelf, so asked for a makeshift flight to try the sherry and bourbon for $12 a pour.\n\nAverage drink price is around $14, but well worth it for the quality ingredients and expert execution. Would definitely go back - Cheers!", "author": "Farhan K."}

Rolling in on the weekend on the early side (6-7 PM) meant that getting a seat either at the bar or in the back at a high-top table was a cinch. The bartenders here are very friendly and know their craft, as evidenced by the skill they showed in making my wife's mocktails. The front has high ceilings, giving it a spacious feel, while the back has low lighting, lower ceilings, and a bit more of an intimate ambiance. I also liked the contrast of the walls of the narrow cocktail bar - one side is old-school exposed brick, with shelves of liquor lined up at the bar, while the other has what looks like simple Chinese-style light watercolor paintings of mountains, although a closer look reveals a some subtle maps (of the U.S.?) laid underneath the outline of the mountains. It gives the spot a bit of a zen vibe, which I really liked.\n\nAs for the offerings here, I don't think food is offered - I didn't see it on the menu, nor did I see anyone eating any. However, there are a lot of cocktail offerings, presented in a slightly worn leather covering and laid out by liquor type. All the ones I had (which were 4 or 5 different ones) were quite good, although I will say my favorite was my first - Hall Pass, which was a robust vodka-based drink with a decent amount of citrus and a very nice thick layer of egg white foam on top. I also enjoyed the Hot Toddy - warm and soothing and quite perfect a drink for the winter. There are a few beers on tap (I didn't bother with those), and you can have cocktails made on demand - although I found you had better luck if you were at the bar talking to the bartenders directly as opposed to the waiters, who didn't have the same level of patience.\n\nIn all, I really enjoyed how casual the vibe was, and given the quality of the cocktails, I thought the prices were quite reasonable (particularly compared to NYC).

It deserves love and loyalty and I'm happy to say that it's converted me to become a regular. \n\nIf you've been a follower of the big man Kevin Deidrich, you'll know that this man has not only been a pioneer in SF's cocktail scene, he's been instrumental in setting the scene. He's also been credited to having inventive cocktails at several hotel bars he's previously worked at and even got featured on the Wall Street Journal (oddly enough, not for his bartending skills but for his workout routine!) True to his style, he tends to experiment with less sweet, more complex flavors that really tickles your curiosity. Although, PCH being a tiki-haven, some sweeter style concoctions are on the menu too. \n\nI consider myself a well-researched cocktail aficionado and in my years of cocktailing, you can say, I've seen it all. My palate is now looking for something new, exciting and different. PCH's menu gives me the junkie fix that I've never had before!\n\nDrinks are fun and approachable, like the Lime in da Coconut (salted pistachio! coconut-lychee milk) and the Ko'Olina Swizzle with its orgeat and pineapple notes. This is a tall drink and it's not shy on the rum either!\n\nThere's also geek out cocktails like the Miso Old Fashioned that serious cocktailians will love. It has Miso-butter infused Bacardi 8 rum combined with Pommeau and bitters. It's savory and the surprising creaminess of the faint butter flavor will astound you. If that doesn't, then the proprietary \"PCH\" large ice cube will. Or for the more classic drinkers, their Bobby Burns and Martinis come with a little sidecar, it's like getting two drinks for the price of one!\n\nThe more adventurous should like OH Snap! which highlights sugar snap peas as the main ingredient. (Mom always told you to increase your vegetable intake, right?) or the very aesthetically pleasing Santorini Summer made with gin, cucumber, yogurt liquor and housemade tzatziki sauce. YES. You read that right! the only thing missing is a pita bread ... \n\nNow that I've given you a thorough breakdown of the menu, it's time to focus on how they treat customers here. Whether you come in two's or in a big group, you wouldn't need to fret. They lavished our group with the utmost service: recommending, entertaining and checking up on us. Do you want to bring food? no problem! you can order at Hogwash next door or bring your own. (I HIGHLY recommend Milan Pizza for serious drunk eats! ;-) \n\nThose long work weeks when I have to pull double shifts or work a 7 day stretch and all I want is to go to a neighborhood bar where I won't be ignored for 20 minutes --- I come here. The staff KNOWS that hospitality earns a customer's trust much faster than putting a cold bevvy in my hand.\n\nThat sole reason is why I'm now attached to my bartenders here. And when I get attached, it's for life.\n\n* 2000th Review *", "author": "Janice C."}

When we came here, there were no seats available, the place is quite cozy. No security carded us at the door, so anyone can go in, however if you chose to order a drink they will card you. You find your own table, no one seats you. We wandered around and there were no seats so we were ready to leave, however a table just wrapped up and we took over the seating. Drinks are typical SF prices, especially located in the heart of downtown, this appeals to tourists. I didn't think this place was super interesting or special when it came into the interior decor and design. The drinks were separated on the menu based off of liquor. For example, one page would be vodka based drinks, whereas the next were rum based. Overall, our party of 5 people, we didn't feel anything special about the drinks. It was one of those, oh we're in the city, let's go try it on time kind of places. Nothing that convinced me to return again.

We managed to be right on time to take over the entire back lounge seats so we could feel like pseudo ballers sitting in the back of a club. \n\nThe menu is extensive and can be overwhelming. The drinks are categorized by alcohol type and they serve giant fountain sized ones for large parties. I got the rum version of the fo shizzle my nizzle or something. Wait it was the Ko'Olina Swizzle. It was huge but think it was mostly crushed ice. All the drinks were pretty good. My friend's drink was oddly spicy and I wasn't into it but she loved it! \n\nRan about $60 for four drinks which is not horrible. Music is pretty loud and it was really hot in the bar. It would've been nicer if they played reggae or something to go with the theme but Top 40 it is.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

Convenient to Union Square,  they have a huge selection at the bar. However, this place has a limited cocktail menu, with 3-4 drinks per alcohol. The cocktails on the menu each look fantastic, and I've had a couple during my limited stay in the area. The Eastern promises is an interesting asian fusion drink, and you can definitely taste the spice in it. The Oh Snap was also delicious. The barkeeps and the service here was also great, though admittedly I did not come during rush hour.\n\nIf your going to be in the area the PCH is definitely a goto spot to get drinks and hang out.", "author": "Leon K."}

My cousin and I got to PCH about 15 minutes just after it opened on a Saturday evening. We walked right by it at first, as it's easy to miss.

We were able to grab a seat right at the middle of the bar. \n\nI'm a whiskey/bourbon drinker, so I went for the Ward Eight, which had Wild Turkey in it I believe. The drink was amazing! Probably one of the best cocktails I've ever had, no joke! I ordered my cousin the Cowfee Twalk. She enjoyed that as well! Tasted like coffee as one might imagine! \n\nI finished off with the Miso Old Fashion. It was a little different than what I'm use to drinking when I drink Old Fashions but it tasted pretty good! It tasted like a lemon cough drop but in a good way! \n\nWe hung out for about about an hour or so and the bartenders were very attentive and I don't remember the bartenders name who made my drinks, but he was very informative about the drinks and kept checking on us. We even share a love for Rye Whiskey's so he showed me one of his favorites that he thought I should try. \n\nOverall it was a great experience and the drinks are top notch!

What gives this bar a one up on other craft cocktail bars, is that the bartenders are friendly (the ones I have dealt with anyways.) You tend to get snotty, or aloof bartenders at fancy cocktail bars, but that isn't the case here. The bartending staff can make or break a place for me, especially in a neighborhood bar. If I want to grab a drink by myself and sit at the bar, it's nice to deal with a friendly face, and that's what greets you here. \n\nThe drink menu is obviously carefully thought out, and each drink is made with precision. My favorite, hands down, is the Ko'olina Swizzle. It reminds me of a mai tai, kind of. There are two kinds of rum in it, some banana flavor, pineapple, and a few other things. What kicks it up a notch is that it's presentation is really fun. It's served on crushed ice, with a dried pineapple slice and I think a pineapple leaf. And it isn't an overly sweet drink; it has a nice bang of liquor that will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Prices aren't cheap, but that's typical for craft cocktails in SF, or I guess anywhere. \n\nThe atmosphere is cool, pretty laid back.

Drinks here are handcrafted and very creative with mixes of spices and herbs.  I loved my Sherry Cobbler - not to sweet, not too much herbs, and it was unique.  Prices are standard due to location.

Imagine my surprise when I show up, think to myself, \"this place looks familiar,\" and then realize that what was once Cantina, had now become this new and spacious cocktail bar (Cantina patrons will remember how cramped the place was), with a far, far more extensive cocktail program, from the folks that also brought you Press Club.\n\nNow, was I delighted or disappointed by this development? As far as the venue itself goes, I much preferred the new layout at PCH: clean, slick, and again, most importantly, more spacious than her predecessor. And for those who like variety, PCH's liquor-specific cocktail menu is nothing to shake your finger at.

Bartenders were very attentive and friendly also :) \n\nThe menu is separated by the spirit used--each page consists of 2-3 cocktails of that spirit listed--super easy to find out what you want/prefer. \n\nWhat we got: \n1) Swizzle my Nizzle: mmm this was spicy and sweet at the same time. This drink came at the suggestion of Miguel, our bartender, and it didn't disappoint! I'd definitely try this one out again. \n2) Bay Bridge Buck: This was probably my favorite--it tasted like a strawberry lemonade. It didn't taste dangerous but I'm sure it was!\n3) Lime in da Coconut: really tasty for those wanting something a bit more tropical with a hint of lime. \n\nThe vibe was pretty chill, got a bit more busy as 7:30-8pm rolled around, but still wasn't overly crowded where it became annoying or too loud. I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Shannon N."}

It made comparing very easy and Pacific Cocktail Haven is the winner in my book. We met for drinks right after work on Friday and I had such a fun time reading the names and descriptions on the cocktail menu.\n\nI started with a Lime in da Coconut, which is one of the tastiest drinks I've ever had. I would like to clarify, though, that I absolutely love coconut milk and that was the star of this cocktail. The drinks are beautifully designed, meticulously crafted, and served in the perfect vessels. For drinks with big ice cubes, they even brand the PCH logo into the ice. How cool is that?\n\nAs we sat there sipping our drinks, I noticed that some people got drinks with metal straws. Maybe I was tipsy but I had straw envy. When I tried a new drink, Swizzle My Nizzle, my date ordered it with a metal straw. I was so happy. The drink was so pretty that I didn't want to ruin it.\n\nPCH is a great addition to the SF cocktail bar scene. The drinks here are original and delicious and the bartenders are friendly. Highly recommended!", "author": "Yi Z."}

They are perfectly clear. \nLook at the bar stations.  They are cleaner than some hospitals.  \nLook at the glassware.  Every drink has it's own cup.\n\nThe attention to detail and organization is just the starting point.  Owner Kevin Diedrich uses  chronic OCD to his advantage.  The attention to detail doesn't just stop with the setting-  each of his award winning cocktails are carefully and expertly made by Diedrich or one of his very capable bartenders.  There's a cocktail for any mood, and any of the staff are happy to help you find the one that is right for you, either on or off the menu.  The staff is always going to go out of their way to make sure that you have a good experience.  If you're a fan of craft cocktails, then try to go in at a slow time to talk shop with the staff.  They are all very knowledgeable about spirits.  \n\nRemember back ten years ago when you used to use Internet Explorer and didn't understand what the fuss was about this Firefox browser?

Their modern updates on classic cocktails are certainly appealing but perhaps the best drink I've ordered here was an odd number featuring sugar snap peas (the oh snap!).   Other drinks offer extraordinary attention to detail -- you may notice that even their ice cubes are branded in certain cocktails.  Travel downstairs and instead of a bathroom you may stumble into a dance party.  And on the main floor, you can either sit at the bar for quiet conversation or perhaps snuggle next to a date in the cozy nook with a tiny table meant for two.  \n\nI don't live in SF but I certainly wouldn't be above judging a local if they didn't enjoy this bar.

So the crew and the big seating area in the back and was immediately greeted by one of the staffers. He brought us a few menus and told us about a few of his favorite drinks. I have to say this dudes selections were on point. So we placed our orders and started chatting up a storm then realized the music. When i hear that old school music i get pumped nothing beats some old WU Tang playing in the background. That totally caught me off guard that's a true sign of a good night. Then i hear the drinks are here the drinks are here and it's go time. I can not remember everything we ordered but each drink came out good as hell.

When we first arrived it was a little busy for such a small space but they really made the best use of the area they did have. It's nestled in between some hotels and other bars so it's easy to miss and walk past but please if you're in the area, stop by and check it out. The decor, service, and drinks are all amazing. We browsed the menu for a little bit and there were a lot of drinks that caught our eyes. The bartenders are very attentive and even though it was busy they noticed that we didn't have a drink or menu in our hands and waved for us to come get a menu so we could order. Even though a lot of the drinks had a lot of different fruit components in then they were by far not weak. You really get what you pay for here. We ordered the cocktails according to what we thought were weaker to stronger and it did not disappoint. Tonight was the first night I actually had an egg in one of my drinks and it was delicious. The sesame seeds on top really made a difference. If you chewed on the seeds it added a whole new and interesting new depth to the flavors. It gave it that nutty buttery flavor kind of like peanut butter to a drink that tasted like creme brulee. Overall this bar is a must go to and I will definitely be back to visit.

The drinks are island inspired, and there are a few tiki statues on the bar shelves, but that's about as far as it goes.

The crowd is mixed in age, and the music was a good mix of 90s and current r&b/hip-hop. I tried a few of their rum and whisky drinks, and the definite winner was the Ko'Olina Swizzle, but the Tuk Tuk Tea (thai-tea inspired) was a strong second. The tartness in the Ko'Olina made for a bright drink. Most cocktails here are $12-13, and I don't recall seeing anything cheaper, but you get what you pay for here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-28", "description": "I think this place is run by a mad man. There is wallpaper on one wall that is amazing. and exposed brick on the other wall, also amazing. He must not of been able to make up his mind if he liked wall paper or brick and decided to have both. \n\nThe menu is a assault on the senses! So much to read and see and taste, really too much to read, I am not a big reader. There are offerings from #Gin, #Whisky, #Brandy. (I am using # right). My personal favorite was the Bobby Burns. A scotch cocktail of a rare delight. I think everyone should drink this scotch cocktail featuring Cutty Sark Prohibition #whisky. A whisky of fine elegance and distinction.\n\nThe #beer is great, they have Field works on draft, my personal favorite brewery in the bay area. And make sure not to miss the bottle water feature. They bottle their own water, very fancy for a bar. Most people just put it in a glass in front of you. Not his mad man, he puts it in a bottle for you! So classy.\n\nThe food was amazing as well. Try the candied cherries or the brined olives for a unique small bite experience. If that is to heavy for you ask for the shiso salad. Hand picked shiso served inside of a cocktail glass! and it comes with Rum and lime as well. If you are feeling a little religious and really who isn't these day go for the Monks Buck. A cocktail experience like i have never had, well except for the wine in church.\n\nLast but certainly not least, this owner must be a super nerd with terrible taste in sports. He has superhero coffee cups all over the bar. Star wars soda glasses full of straws, when I asked what was in the cup and if i can drink it they said nothing... I was very confused why a cup had so many straws with no beverage. I also saw a Washington RedSkins mug, by far the worse sports team in the history of sports. This is all forgiven because everything else was 5 stars.\n\nAll in all this is an amazing destination for anyone who is looking for 5 star cocktails, 5 star service, 5 star beer, 5 star wall paper, 5 star bottled water, 5 star whisky collection, 5 star bar top, 5 star glass ware, 5 star 5 stars.", "author": "brian m."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-15", "description": "My friend and I had a moment of confusion when we walked through the door of PCH. We definitely had been there before, but the bar had a different name and a slightly different vibe. I recognized the same bar manager as before, so I knew I wasn't totally off my rocker. So yes, PCH has an updated vibe and a more tiki-focused menu that what it was before, which is a plus. The decor itself is a little mismatched and lacks a cohesive feel from space to space, but overall a very inviting environment. We stood at the counter along the wall for a bit, waiting for space at the bar to open up. I was disappointed that there weren't wall hooks to hang our jackets and bags. \n\nThe first cocktail that I ordered was the Blinker (rye, raspberry and grapefruit) and my friend got the Kingston Crusta (rum, maraschino, ginger, citrus, cayenne, bitters). Both drinks were served in beautiful glassware, but I liked the taste of the Kingston Crusta better. Thankfully as we were finishing up our first drink, two spots opened at the bar and we grabbed them. By this point (6ish), the bar was starting to fill up. For our second round, I ordered the Naked Mai Tai (rum, combier, orgeat, and bitters) and my friend got the Eastern Promises (gin, cocchi rosa, black pepper, lemongrass, bitters). Again, I liked her drink more than mine. The Naked Mai Tai was STRONG and I had a hard time tasting the distinct ingredients. However, the ice cube in my drink was very impressive (they somehow managed to get PCH onto the ice cube with some kind of stamp/brand. By the time we finished up our second drink, the place was packed and we were ready to find a more quiet (and less expensive) place.", "author": "Regina L."}

There are two reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 4 or 5. The first is that, even for a hipster craft cocktail establishment, this place is insanely expensive. It's $90 for a bowl of punch, whereas even at Whitechapel, you can get a bowl for $50-60. The second is just the ingress and egress. Whoever put this place together, and said the bar would be in a prime location where it is, should not get another job. It's impossible to walk around this place without bumping into numerous people.

Perhaps since they share the restroom area space. Fun times here, but it was a bit loud so if you wanted to have a decent conversation, perk them ears up and project your voice!

They take care of all of the details, whether that be placing a perfect garnish or literally branding one of their over-sized ice cubes with their PCH logo! The only real problem with this place is that you'll feel the need to try everything before you go! Good for both first date drinks or a place to hang with friends and have some fabulous drinks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-04", "description": "I always measure the quality of a cocktail bar by how perfect they can make the world's first cocktail, the old fashioned.   Hence the name.  It's the gold standard.  It needs to be made in the tradition of a clean and neat drink.   The way George Washington would have made it.  This Is usually how I order.  \"Make it like George would have\".   Proper attention to detail is the only way to differentiate, since the ingredients are so basic.  Rye, simple sugar, bitters, orange and lemon garnish and ice.  I've had them with muddled fruit, seltzer, cherries etc..  To me those additions are mere distractions and disqualifies the establishment from further patronage.   \n\nLet's break it down.   At PCH  each element of the old fashioned was made to perfection.  I'd say it was the best one I'd ever purchased, even better than my own.   Starting with the right glass(low tumbler), they add clear ice that is cut on-site to fit the glass, they even \"stamp\" the ice PCH with a special tool while making the drink.  The right amount of rye, bitters and sugar is added into a glass beaker.  It Is stirred not shaken within a generous amount of small ice cubes to achieve maximum chilling. This is critical, it must be small ice cubes that have more surface area then large ones.  This ice must be very cold to the point where it feels dry so as to NOT water down the cocktail.  Then they rim the glass with fresh cut lemon rinds.  It can't be pre cut because the lemons loose their essence over time. They start drying out when left out on the bar.  They pour the cocktail into the low tumbler to 2/3 full. This is critical to keep the lemon and orange scent persistent while enjoying the drink.   Just awesome execution.
