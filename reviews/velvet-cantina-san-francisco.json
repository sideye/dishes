When my friends, who live in the area, brought me here, I was pretty excited since they usually have good taste. We shared some Guac which wasn't bad and had a decent kick to it. I also got the Fish Tacos, which weren't bad, but nothing too impressive. The service and environment were weird and not my favorite. It was on the loud side so I felt like I had to scream to talk to my friends, whom I hadn't seen in a year.

I didn't get crispy at all - it just seemed overcooked. It seemed very dry and chewy - thankfully, we had some leftover salsa from the appetizer so that I could drown the meat in it. The rice and black beans that came with it were ok, nothing too spectacular. Although the portion was a decent size, I didn't really want to finish the food given the taste of it. For $15, I was pretty underwhelmed. \n\nThe service was okay for the most part, our waiter checked up on us several times and seemed pretty friendly. The free chips and salsa they give you was also delicious, the salsa actually is pretty chunky and not watery like most restaurants that give you free chips and salsa.

The place took reservations which is an excellent thing as I didn't want everyone to suffer from waiting in line. We got a booth table and ordered three appetizers. Then we looked at the menu and thought it was too much to order a full plate for each person. We ended up sharing an entree and it was still too much. We ordered a pitcher and that was also a lot of liquor for the 7 of us. \n\nThe gist of this place is that the food is really good and the portion is huge. \n\nI got to play the host and that was great. Plus I had another place that I got to be at later that evening across the town so everything just worked out great. \n\nMy colleagues saw me recently as I was abroad back in Asia and they still remember this Mexican joint.

This place was romantic enough, though a tad loud. I would never come back here based on the bad snack (Queso Macho) and margarita alone. Everything disappointed! WASTE OF MONEY. DON'T BOTHER! Overall rating: D-\n\n\nHere's what we got:\n\nQueso Macho (House made queso, chorizo, and guacamole): I was expecting this to come out like nachos. This was LITERALLY a SMALL bowl of cheese sauce with hardly any chorizo and guacamole drowning in the sauce. The sauce was fine. But they didn't give us a new basket of house made tortilla chips for the lonely cheese sauce until we asked for it. This sure as hell was NOT worth $10.79! What a rip off! D-\n\n-They give you complimentary chips and salsa though. The salsa was ok, but the chips tasted very oily and stale. I only ate the chips for the sake of my tiny $11 bowl of cheese sauce. I don't even think a NYC restaurant would dare serve you JUST the sauce without additional chips for $11! C-\n\n-Fresh Fruit Margarita: I choose the mango flavor. But they used UNRIPE mango so it ruined the drink. D-\n\n-My friend's bottled beer was fine. Nothing special.\n\n\nGo elsewhere! Just TERRIBLE here!", "author": "D D."}

Used to order guac here and get a big mortar and pestle bowl of it, now you get a 4oz scoop but it still cost $9 dollars! Wtf, worlds most expensive guac and I'm pretty sure it has mayo in it or some sort of non-avocado additive. \n\nService is poor at the bar and at the tables.  Ordered a drink and 15 minutes later asked if it was still coming because the people sitting next to me ordered after they sat 10 minutes after me and already had their drinks.  The waiter replied that it happens in order of the tickets and it's coming.  Ok well I think you are giving the tickets to the line/bartender backwards then.\n\nFood has become super mediocre overall as well.  My salad was almost all iceberg lettuce with a little cheese and garbanzo beans on top and a super weak dressing, of course it was like $16. \n\nI first came here maybe ten years ago and was blown away, loved the charm, style of food with good drinks and overall feel of the place.  The 2-3 times I've been here the last few years it has gotten progressively worse and worse, what happened?

We got two for the table of 10 and they were quickly devoured. We also got mushroom empanadas, my favorite of the night! They were smothered in a creamy mushroom sauce... and filled with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms as well -  if you like mushrooms, this is the dish for you! Then I tried the fish tacos and the steak tacos! All taco platters come with two tacos, rice and beans (black, pinto or refried) the fish taco was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and had slaw and a spicy aioli on it.. which was delicious and the steak tacos were well seasoned and juicy. I would have liked the steak pieces to be chopped up a little more, because they were a tad sloppy to eat, since the steak was cut fairly large for one of my typical mouthfuls! \n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, unfortunately!

I would say come for the drinks and camaraderie with friends. \n\nLocated in the heart of the Mission district, Velvet Cantina is small, but able to accommodate semi-large groups. We made reservations for 8 p.m. on a Tuesday night for eight people and we all fit comfortably.\n\nI ordered the achiote steak tacos, which sounded downright delicious on the menu. Strips of steak seasoned with achiote topped with pepper jack cheese, guacamole and sour cream. However, the flavor just wasn't there. The meat was also kind of fatty. I made it through about one and one-half of three tacos before I just gave up. Friends gave mixed reviews on their food, as well. From what I gathered, I should try the enchiladas on any subsequent visits. Duly noted. Also, the house salsa was salty and highly acidic. As in maybe too much lemon or lime juice. \n\nWhat Velvet Cantina DOES do well are their drinks! I don't think you can go wrong with any of their margaritas. There was enough variety to appeal to different tastes and budgets, although the prices are fairly close. I don't drink tequila often, but when I do, I enjoy the smooth taste of Herradura (I promise I'm not being paid to say this LOL). Hence, the \"Perfect Margarita\" was my favorite. It was strong and perfectly blended. I also tried the \"Velvet Margarita,\" and since it's the restaurant's namesake, I expected it to be the best one. However, it was entirely too bitter for my taste. I didn't enjoy it.\n\nAgain, I'm not completely over this place, but there are better Mexican food spots where you can get your fix if you're in the city. (Don't sleep on our taco trucks).

Simple and strong. Two of those and I was feeling a-ok. A pitcher is also a nice option if everyone's getting the same thing. Also, try their fresh fruit margaritas - I tried a few sips of my friend's raspberry one and it was phenomenal.\n\nA little sexy and cozy resto - nab the corner booth, which is perfect for a small group of friends. Everyone can hear each other and chat as a group. This was a plus for our crew who all wanted to catch up and hear about everything we've been doing in our own cities.\n\nGuacamole is required.

We ordered a pitcher of the house margarita and it really allowed us to get a good buzz going on. Bartenders were fun and made sure folks got taken care of. The area can get a bit crowded since the bar is located at the front of the restaurant where the entrance is located.\n\nThe food and service was a bit off to me. It took us quite a while to get our check. Maybe because it was a busy Friday night. The things that we ordered tasted very ordinary and didn't leave too much of an impression. Warning...steer clear from the cantaloup margarita.

It was cold and uncomfortable. It wasn't packed so there were other comfortable seats, but unfortunately it was offered. It took almost 30 minutes to be asked if we were thirsty or ready to order. The party of 10-12 got more service than anybody in the place. The food was okay, I've had better nachos elsewhere. I hate to use the race card but I'll throw it out there anyway.

He is in the wrong industry!!! Get it together baby boy. You need some training in the hospitality industry let me know. I have a few restaurant under my belt. I'm not done yet.\n\nThis is how it goes. We were a party of 7. It was busy. It's obvious that everybody working were all busy and running around. We were all seated at our table, Mr. Gabe already had a look on his face of frustration, not my issue. He chose to be a hostess in life not I. \n\nWe get 2 pitchers of the Velvet Margaritas (they were scrumptious) while we make our food selections. We waited, waited. Again, we are patient as we know that it is busy. After 10-15 mins I simply call Gabe over and ask him to call our waiter over. He interrupted me and little did he know he raised his voice and said, \"I have seated, that table (as he points out the tables), that table and that table. At this point, I'm confused because I wasn't one asking him to take our order or anything else. Simply asked to call our waiter over. He continues to get aggravated and says, \"what,? I can't help you. I am busy.\" My whole table looked at each other in disgust! Like really?! Did that just happen? My friend across the table asked, \"What is going on.\" I started talking to her about it and guess what?! Gabe is looking at me dead in the eyes and says, \"You got a problem?!\" So, we are fighting now? \"Did he just threaten me?\" I think he did. So, I call him over to ask him what his issue was and to just reconfirm the fact that all I wanted was our waiter nothing else. Words were exchanged. I sent him off. \n\nAs petty as this is...He had no reason to treat anybody this way. Especially the people like ME, that pay his bills and keep these businesses open. We have choices, the mission has tons of other spots to eat. \n\nMaybe Gabe needs to change his career path and not be a hostess or whatever it is he does. He should be embarrassed as should the whole establishment. Don't let people like this tarnish your reputation. Your food is way too good. Get rid of the bad apple.", "author": "Carla F."}

I like the vibe here - a small divey eating place. I had a small dinner because we were heading to a nightclub later on. I ordered three items: mushroom empanadas, crispy pork street taco, and the seasonal fruit margarita. \n\nI'm not a big fan of empanadas. In the past I felt crust wasn't crispy enough and the filling too heavy. However the mushroom empanadas are the best I ever had. The crust was crispy and the filing was light. The crispy pork street taco wasn't really that good as the meat was dry. Also I expected some crispy skin with the pork, but that's just me as I always expect crispy skin when I see there is crispy pork on the menu. The street taco is the reason why I didn't give a higher rating. For the seasonal fruit margarita I had the options of pineapple, mango, or watermelon; I choose the watermelon. The watermelon margarita was refreshing on that late, hot evening. Overall I had pretty good light dinner before heading to the nightclub.\n\nBe careful of ordering too many items as this place can be too pricy for this type of setting. I recommend ordering one item and the watermelon margarita. In addition take advantage of the free chips and salsa provided and you will be fully satisfied.", "author": "Gerald R."}

Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating because good food is good food. Period. Hell, I like Mission Chinese Food and most people know that it's not legit Chinese food but at least it's somewhat well-executed. Velvet Cantina, however, couldn't even execute basic Mexican staples like rice and beans properly. It was like prison food. Well, at least how I envisioned prison food to be like if I ever got arrested for public indecency.\n\nWe started with the Chicken Tortilla Soup w/ a Sour Cream Empanada ($6.99): http://bit.ly/13isQw1. It was no bueno and tasted like chicken bouillon soup; VERY artificial, salty, and with very few shreds of chicken. The best part was the empanada and only because it was fresh out of the fryer. The Queso Macho w/ Chorizo & Guacomole ($8.49) fared better: http://bit.ly/13isVzG. How can you resist a melding of ooooey gooey cheese with delicioso mildly spicy bits of chorizo? The thick tortilla chips held up well to this sinfully good dip. If you must order something to coat your stomach from the margaritas, get this!\n\nMy entree of Chicken Mole w/ Refried Beans & Rice ($12.79) was another disappointment: http://bit.ly/15eAzPu. Although the chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender, the mole sauce was unappetizing. While mole sauce should be richly thick, Velvet Cantina's mole was grossly thick; almost pasty with a very aggressive flavor profile (too much cinnamon and coriander?). I've grown to love refried beans but these were just awful with a chunky, toothpaste-like texture. And then, there was the mushy and clumpy rice. How can you mess up rice? *Sigh*\n\nI wasn't impressed with the chewy Carne Asada either which I took a bite off from Mr. NSS' plate. Two of my friends ordered the much raved about Chicken Avocado Enchiladas. They said it was mediocre and there was barely had any chicken or avocados in it.\n\nIF I ever come back to Velvet Cantina, I'm bringing hot dates with me: Mr. Patron, Mr. Don Julio, Mr. Tres Agaves and Mr. Tecate! Holla!\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*Reservations were easily made on the same day.\n*2 stars for the food and 4 stars for the service.\n*Seems to be a place to go for drinks and not for the food especially if you're use to legit Mexican food. \n*Upbeat and friendly service (the saving grace). Our water glasses never went below the halfway point which is always a good sign of attentive service.\n*Saw zero natives dining here. Are there even any Mexican natives who even reviewed Velvet Cantina? =/\n*2 very dim dining areas: a bar area with 5 tables and a back dining area with 7 booths and 2 tables.\n*Difficult street parking. There's a parking garage 2 blocks away on 21st/Bartlett.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It can be very challenging to get into all of the uber trendy Foreign Cinemas, Monks Kettles, and Berettas of the world on even a Wednesday night these days. I also sometimes realize that paying $18 for a burger actually isn't normal (most of the time I'm swirling around in the SF cost of living vortex and don't realize how ridiculously overpriced things are). Then there are those times when your friend asks what's a good spot to go to dinner with 10 friends in 4 hours? This is when we come to Velvet Cantina. \n\nWelcome to the stress free zone. Dim lit with perfect volume music playing that is upbeat but not top 40. Red little chili lights strung everywhere with cozy big booths just waiting for you and your friends. Grab a pitcher of margaritas and wait for 10 mins for them to arrange your perfect table for even a group of 8+ and serve you which ever dish under $15 you choose. Try walking into another restaurant with 8 people and no reservation...Monks Kettle couldn't fit you, Foreign Cinema would nicely tell you there's an available reservation in 6 weeks, and you would all have so many cocktails waiting for Beretta for 2 hours that you would just skip dinner or end up at a taqueria. \n\nFood - the food is delicious. Although admittedly I haven't made it past two dishes I love. We always order the Chili Verde and the Avocado Chicken Enchiladas. The Chili Verde comes with 4-5 corn tortillas and rice and beans. The Chili Verde is cooked perfectly. The sauce is delicious and full of flavor and the pork is super moist and falls apart. The Avocado Chicken Enchiladas are delicious too. They also come with rice and beans. The chicken is moist and they add a green avocado sauce on top of the enchiladas that has a great flavor. Both dishes are huge enough to share with someone. Especially if you dig into their chips (best homemade chips!) and salsa. If you like heat they have a habanero salsa they can bring you but you have to ask for it. \n\nDrinks - delicious margaritas. They have a bunch of different flavors and you can order a pitcher or glass. They have a full bar so you can get other items if you want or top shelf tequila shots if it's that kind of a night. They have a bar area that's big enough to wait and have a drink in which is nice. No one likes standing outside.\n\nService - awesome service. They seat everyone really quickly and efficiently and make sure everyone is happy even if you are just waiting for a table. If you wait at the bar they'll serve you chips and salsa. I like that the servers always ask what kind of beans you want and other thoughtful questions rather than just having a standard option and leaving it up to you to ask what it is. \n\nReservations - no Open Table. Call and leave a message if they aren't open and they will call you right back when they open and set up a reservation for you. They will always squeeze you in somehow, even last minute large parties.\n\nOverall fun, delicious dinner spot!", "author": "Juliet S."}

As for the atmosphere, it was pretty dark.  I'm not sure what else was going on in there, which is also unimportant.  What to focus on at Velvet Cantina is the Food.  This is the best \"regular\" Mexican food I have had to date.  Some of you may think I'm crazy but, I have lived most of my life in the northeast and the southeast.  Standard Mexican places are all the same with no creativity.  Let me clarify \"regular\" as well.  I have had high end Mexican dishes i.e. Dos Caminos in NYC, and it was great, but I am referring to more of your every day places.... am I making any sense at this point?\n\nI would consider Velvet Cantina an everyday type of restaurant.  It's not for a special occasion or insanely expensive.  It's the type of place to stop in to for dinner because your craving Mexican food and in the neighborhood.  They aren't trying to be something they're not and they're not trying to reinvent the wheel with crazy ingredients or dishes you've never heard of.\n\nOur group started off with the chips and salsa and an order Guacamole (Haas avocado, red onion, lime, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o).  Im not a huge Guac fan but, this avacado creation kept me digging into the bottom of the bowl.  For my entree, I was torn.  I wanted to try everything on the menu.  I went with the Chicken Avocado Enchiladas (Shredded chicken, slices of avocado, jalape\u00f1o cream sauce, pepper jack cheese, cilantro pesto, rice and choice of beans).  Every time I thought about getting something else, I kept looking back at that \" jalape\u00f1o cream sauce\" and knew that needed to be a component of my dinner. \n\nOne of the best decisions of my night.  The enchiladas were exploding with flavor.  I would easily consider drinking that cream sauce too.  Even the rice and beans were over the top.  I really enjoyed the grated Parmesan on the black beans.  The cheese was a nice flavor addition.

I got the Cornbread Sopas with Chicken and they were *eentsy weentsy*. Like seriously smaller than the palm of my hand. Now, I know in the nutritious school of thought, the palm of your hand is supposed to measure one portion. But for nearly $11? That was way too small.

Everyone wants to take care of you and you can feel that. I got the ensalada de pollo and it was really good! The portion size was perfect. Others at the table got tacos, enchiladas, etc. we had guac for the table, as well as the queso dip.

They don't skimp on the tequila, but it's not overwhelming either. The salsa that comes with the chips and salsa tastes really fresh also. I also at the tacos valentina (chicken tacos), and they were amazing and really flavorful with a huge portion of fresh guac (not that watery pre-made stuff).

Excellent tortilla chips and guac, and a waiter who was patient and didn't pressure us to order. He was helpful in helping me decide what to get (my cousin was a repeat eater, I was a first-timer) and I ended up going with the carnitas.\n\nThey were delicious. The pork was juicy and full of flavor, and I skipped the rice and went with two sides of beans. Everything was wonderful, including the cabbage slaw places on the side of the plate. But from all the chips and guac, I couldn't eat more than half the plate. I ask for it to be wrapped up to go and the waiter obliged.\n\nHowever, I could see him packing it up. He got a to-go box and set it down. Next to my plate was my cousin's plate (with nothing taken to go). He scooped something off of my plate, onto my cousin's, and then the rest of my plate went into the to-go box and my cousin's plate vanished into the kitchen with the bus boy.\n\nI thought, \"Hmm....what just happened?\" When the waiter came over, I asked, \"I was watching you prepare this. What did you scoop off and not include in my box?\" He said, \"Oh, that was the cabbage slaw. A lot of people don't like that so I thought you wouldn't want it.\"\n\nHuh? I am not aware of a waiter ever making a decision on my to-go box without my direction. I'll sometimes say, \"I only want this or that,\" but my entire plate is always in my to-go box otherwise. I found this waiter's behavior very bizarre. He did, to his credit, go get some more cabbage slaw (which I did like and want) and put it in my box.\n\nOutside of this weird ending, everything else was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-27", "description": "After seeing Velvet Cantina reppin' SF on Thrillist's \"21 Best Nachos in America List,\" I HAD to see what these mysterious Velvet Nachos were all about. With so many great taquerias in the area, I was curious to see what could possibly make these so amazing.\n\nThere's only so much you can do with nachos, but Velvet Cantina really does make it an art. A big part of it has to do with their amazing house-made chips. They're thick, perfectly salted, and stay crispy for an unusually long time even after being drenched in the perfect amount of luscious chile con queso, creamy sour cream, and chunky guacamole. The spicy chorizo added great flavor and is definitely an add-on must.  I like how the toppings are evenly distributed and heavily drizzled on top instead of being unevenly slopped all over the place. All the chips had a generous and even amount of toppings, which led to a continuous stream of satisfying bites. At $14 they're a bit pricey, but completely worth it. I almost didn't get the nachos because I was already satisfied with my basket of free chips, but don't settle! Take the plunge!!! Are they the best nachos I've ever had? Probably. Nachos aren't really a common order for me, but these were pretty darn good and I can't think of another place where I've had better. \n\nI also tried the Chicken Enchilada plate, which came with two enchiladas and generous scoops of rice, black beans, and pickled cabbage. The enchiladas were kind of small, but the cilantro pesto on top made up for it. Not the most flavorful or memorable dish, but it was still good. The food wasn't at all greasy and with the nachos, was a perfect amount to share between two people. Washed it all down with a raspberry margarita and I was a happy camper. \n\nVelvet Cantina is either a great happy hour spot or a casual sit-down Mexican type of joint, not a grab n' go burrito spot. The servers are super chill and you'll occasionally catch them rocking out to the music, which by the way, was a great mix of jukebox classics, 90's hits, and current radio favorites. Of course, I highly recommend the Velvet Nachos! My one regret is that I didn't have room for dessert. I guess I'll just have to get those S'more Nachos next time...", "author": "Deanna Y."}

Don't get me wrong, food was decent, but I've had just as good food at other Tex-Mex restaurants both in and out of SF. \n\nWhen I think Mexican restaurant, I want either small and simple taqueria (i.e. El Farolito) or well-lit, bustling All-American fiesta (i.e. Chevy's).

I Definitely recommend their margaritas. I ordered the shrimp deablo, pretty mediocre. Not enough shrimp, and loaded with onions and tomato sauce which gave me heart burn by the of the night.  Although I wasn't thrilled with my entree, I am willing to give them another chance. Maybe I'll stick to what I know best.... carne asada tacos.  This place is good for groups.

I've passed by this area on many occasions and I only would notice the Walgreens and produce store.  Walking in, there is a nice level of music and intimate atmosphere.  A great place to come with friends and chop it up.\n\nThe menu was a list of usual  Mexican food.  However,   I thought it was weird the menu didn't have beef enchiladas.

I could eat the chips and salsa all day.\n\nChicken & Avocado enchiladas:  \n\nI came hungry, so I asked for an extra enchilada.  The food was good, nice sized portion of food.\n\nMy server was friendly, and cool.  My friend complained that the salsa was too mild so he brought out some habanero extract.   Hell has no fury as this habanero.  I dare you to eat about a spoon full.  I'll give you $50 just to see your facial expression change as your eyes well up and tears begin to roll down your cheeks.. (Really is there anything more hilarious than seeing your friends in agony from hot food?)\n\nSo what is Velvet?

There are two rooms that will fill up rather quickly as the place is incredibly popular and for good reason. The main bar is located in the doors on the left and there are a few booth seats and bar seats as well. \n\nYou can come for just drinks or grab a seat with friends and enjoy the fantastic Mexican food. This is part of the reason why you come to the mission area because of the great food and this place holds its own. Choose from the regular staples like nachos, quesadillas, and tacos or branch our and try their ceviche, smores nachos or sopapilla dishes. The food is all excellent if you are in the mood for Mexican and they are open late and night so you can stop by here after one of your earlier bar hopping adventures. The kitchen is open pretty late so feel free to stop by when you get that craving. \n\nAs with any bar a place is only as good as its drinks and luckily if you are in the mood for tequila you are in luck. They have several margarita options which are actually pretty cheap. They kind of skimp on the size of them though as they are not in traditional margarita glasses so you might need to do 3 of 4 of them to do justice. They have the traditional as well as rotating seasonal fresh fruit margaritas like pineapple and mango which are also delicious. There are several infused tequilas and specialty cocktails which also much be tried at least once. \n\nIf you are looking for tasty Mexican food and a chill theme then velvet cantina is a great fit. It is not too hyped so you don't have to worry about major crowds except on the weekends and the drinks are good enough to keep you coming back.

Smooth texture with a subtle coffee undertone and a little spice that kicks in after the first bite. I've spent a good amount of time in Austin where I fell in love with queso, and this was the only one I've ever found that was on par.\n- Fresh fruit margaritas: I'm not the biggest tequila fan, but I loved my mango margarita. On the rocks with just the right amount of sweetness. They were like Lays: I couldn't have just one.\n- Chips and salsa: chips were fresh and had a great thick and crispy texture. Salsa was refreshing filled with ripe tomatoes.\n- Chicken enchiladas: liked that slices of avocado were inside the enchiladas. Chicken was well seasoned with a bit of spice. Was expecting the jalape\u00f1o cream as a sauce on top of the enchilada vs a little inside. That would've probablt become overkill but I could've used a little more of it as that flavor combination sounded magnificent. \n- Music: not your typical Mexicsn tunes which was a welcome departure \n\nLowlights:\n- Single bathroom: not a problem when it wasn't crowded but more so when it got later.\n\nLoved their queso and fruit margaritas, so I'll definitely be back for those.

They bring you lots of delicious chips which is a positive to start with. If you order cheesy dip it's $9 (doesn't say that on the menu I think) which is pretty expensive liquid cheese if you ask me! You might also need a flashlight to see the menu. It's essentially a bar in one room and a dinning area in the other.\n\nI'm giving it three stars instead if four because we were excited to come here for taco Tuesday bc we saw that that's a thing at this place on yelp or their website (can't remember which). Well, they have no such promotion so you're stuck with full price tacos.\n\nThe platters ate BIG- mostly due to the fact that they laid it up with rice and beans (they have black!) The steak was definitely white-Mexican and chewy which I guess was an interesting change to your Mexican taco. They platters run about $14.\n\nOverall id say the quality of the food is average+.

Diarrhea cha cha cha? Yes please! But once in a while, you've got to give your bunghole a break with clean, non-greasy fare as served at Velvet Cantina. \n\nI need to dedicate an entire paragraph to the complimentary chips and salsa. DAMN THAT SHIT WAS GOOD! The tortilla chips were some of the best I've had in my entire life! Fresh, baked, non-greasy, perfect texture...I need to shove some in my piehole right now with a pile of salsa. THAT SALSA! There must have been crack in it because I could not get enough of the diced tomato goodness. They are not stingy with the portions either, and you can always ask for more, which is exactly what our fat kids' table did. We were also given some melted cheese to dip our chips in. Double explosion in my groin!\n\nFor my entree, I chose the Chicken Avocado Enchiladas. This is what I mean by \"clean\" Mexican food: instead of soggy, haphazardly rolled up tortillas swimming in a pile of sauce, these enchiladas were neatly rolled with just the right amount of cilantro pesto squiggles on top. When cut open, the cross section revealed perfectly shredded chicken and avocado as opposed to poo poo mush. It was delicious and actually tasted healthy. It came with sides of rice and beans (I chose black). I just wish there were more enchiladas instead of overly abundant sides. Yeah you know I'm a greedy bitch.\n\nI almost forgot the most important part! We downed some tequila shots and ordered three pitchers of margaritas. The Perfect Margarita was pretty gangster. It tasted way better than the pineapple kind which we thought would improve our love lives. But no, skip it.", "author": "Suany W."}

Itch: scratched. \n\nThe Cantina also distinguished itself even among its many Mission compatriots with one notable dessert: s'mores nachos, blowtorched at our table. How does this work?

I love Mexican food, but believe it's best when it comes from a taqueria or taco truck. Time and again, I end up being talked into trying some Mexican restaurant with $14 burritos and stewed meats served a dozen different ways on giant, oval plates overflowing with rice and beans. I keep thinking, \"well maybe this place will hit the mark.\" Well no. None of them have to date, and Velvet Cantina continues that streak.\n\nI guess I'm trying to say that I am not their target customer. So take what I write with a grain of salt. But if you have similar tastes to mine, this place probably isn't going to surprise you. \n\nThe margaritas are not cloyingly sweet. The beer price is acceptable. It's crowded on a Saturday night, but not overwhelming. Overall, the food is not bad. It just doesn't live up to the hype. And while the prices here are better than many sit-down Mexican restaurants, the food still costs more than it's worth. \n\nOur reservation was for a party of 7. We were seated promptly. The servers were great. The food came out very quickly (too quickly, to be honest... not a lot of time or care could have gone into its preparation).\n\nWhat people in our party had:\n\nChips and salsa -- Chips were great. Salsa was tasty, yet utterly devoid of spice. Chili's makes a spicier house salsa. \n\nQueso bowl -- Not bad, but again, just melted cheese. No punch whatsoever. \n\nGuacamole -- Fresh but boring. Needed salt, lime, and flavor. \n\nAchiote steak tacos -- Very bland. When you're charging $12 for two tacos, you expect to not need to put a half-pint of Cholula hot sauce on in order to taste anything. \n\nCactus enchiladas -- These came highly recommended. They were slimy and devoid of flavor. She didn't even want to finish them. \n\nChicken salad -- Lettuce, tomato, beans, and chicken. Blah.\n\nChili verde enchiladas -- The standout hit! The guy who ordered this liked them very much. \n\nNachos with chicken -- Nothing on the dinner menu stood out to me, so I ordered the nachos for my meal. They were good-ish. I don't know what they were using for cheese, but I didn't much care for it. However, all ingredients were evenly dispersed, so no hunting for veins of salsa or sour cream. If I went there again, this is probably what I'd order. \n\n...but I don't plan on ever going to Velvet Cantina again. In my opinion, you should just grab a burrito or quesadilla at El Farolito (just a block away), then hit up a couple Mission bars.

This mix was so salty that I only took a couple of sips of my drink. It was really that bad. And my wife only finished half of her drink. We were both amazed at how terribly salty their signature margarita was. It left a taste in the mouth like seawater, I kid you not. We won't be going back to the VC. The food and even the drinks there have lots of room for improvement. Oh, and the service was dreadful. I'm not sure if I've ever given a 1-star review before, but that's all this place deserves.", "author": "Scott D."}

They lost my business forever tonight.  They refused to serve us because they were closing a little less than 2 hours earlier than their posted business hours.  I've never known this place not to be busy a few years ago, failure to bring in sufficient business on a Thursday is reflective and a direct consequence of their poor business effort and values. Given the tech money pouring into the bay area and gentrification happening in the mission district, they're clearly under achieving by not attracting enough clientele to remain open Thursday evenings.

It didn't hurt that I'd been craving nachos like whoa and they have a delicious version of them.\n\nTheir chips are tasty - salted just enough and with tasty salsa to accompany it. They refill those baskets of chips quickly, which is an awesome plus.\n\nThose nachos - oh such heavenly nachos!!  A ginormous platter (yes, platter, not a paltry little plate) is chock full of their tasty chips with lick-your-fingers queso, guac, black beans, etc.  I would have gladly eaten the whole platter myself, but I was a good birthday girl and shared with my siblings and friends (it went quickly).\n\nFor an entree, I wavered between chicken mole and carnitas.  Thankfully I have an awesome brother who is the ultimate entree splitting partner, so we ordered each dish and split them.  The carnitas was friggin' awesome. Nice and crispy on the outside, still flavorful and tender on the inside.  The accompanying black beans were tasty and the rice was the bomb. I mean really, I've had a lot of Mexican rice in my day and these take the cake.  Well-seasoned, fluffy, and the perfect side to these glorious chunks of pork.  \n\nThe mole was also good.  The chicken was tender and boy was there a lot of it.  The mole sauce here was more on the chocolatey/sweet side than I've had at other places. Certainly not a bad thing - a mere observation. It was yummy.\n\nI also had a bite of the chicken avocado enchiladas, which were also very tasty.  OVerall, I was a very happy birthday girl. The service was amazing - didn't have to ask for more chips or water. Even better, we didn't have to ask for more pitchers of margaritas! Our server read our table very very well - knew to put the nachos in front of me (my mini sombrero probably helped) and just refilled our margarita pitcher at the appropriate time. He didn't do it so often that we felt forced into buying additional pitchers - it was perfect.\n\nReally, the best birthday dinner experience I could have asked for.

This was particularly underwhelming as the dip was completely cold.  Not sure if it was meant to be cold but I would have preferred warm queso.  Also, the chips were overly cold (not even room temperature) and didn't taste like tortilla chips much.  The free salsa also wasn't as good as the stuff you can get in the jar.\n\nShrimp enchiladas were not very special.  The shrimps were not especially flavorful.  The beans and rice were solid though.  \n\nService was lack luster.  Not too much attention at the table.  The atmosphere was too noisy to be enjoyable.

This place is a bit different - in the low-lit, eclectic dive bar way. \n\n- Tortilla chips are BOMB.  Homemade, thick and crunchy.  If you are looking for the tomato-y restaurant salsa - this is not the place.  Velvet's is more of a finely minced pico de gallo.

If you're in the mood for some great Mexican food with even better margaritas, Velvet Cantina totally hits the spot. It's got an eclectic-fun vibe with the most entertaining waiters/bartenders. Seriously, we were chatting with our waiter for at least 20 minutes. \n\nHere's what we had: \n\nShrimp Enchiladas: Absolutely yummy! The shrimp was very fresh and well-cooked and the cheese was perfectly melted on top. But I think what really made this dish special was the avocado cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche... so creamy and buttery, perfectly complementing the shrimp\n\nChicken Avocado Enchiladas: My friend ordered this dish and it was seriously my cup of tea. The Jalape\u00f1o cream sauce and pepper jack cheese totally spiced up the chicken and took the dish to new heights\n\nNaked Relleno: My vegetarian friend ordered this and although I try very hard to steer clear of veggies and anything remotely healthy, I had to succumb to the whims of this dish. The vegetable stuffed peppers with the special Chile sauce were so addictive.\n\nS'mores Nachos: We ordered this since it was the only dessert item listed on the menu. And once we ate it, we understood why. It has pretty much got everything - cinnamon, graham crackers, sugar, chocolate, marshmallows. Oh yeah, and did I mention it is served FLAMING? \n\nAlso, the portions are huge so I definitely recommend wearing your best pair of trendy fat-pants. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

Upon entering we were informed of the 45 minute wait for a table and we were fine with this as we figured it would be packed and it was!!  \n\nWe saddled up to the bar after a bit of friendly \"pushing\" and ordered a pitcher of pineapple margaritas.  The bartender wasn't quick about it but we were patient considering the 44 shots of tequila he had to pour for a big party at the end of the bar.\n\nFirst he set a pitcher down and filled it (I mean FILLED it) with ice and my friend and I were thinking \"that better not be ours\" but it was... And we were patient again.  Next came a pineapple crush concoction and then bottle after bottle of tequila, he literally DUMPED 3 different varieties in amounting to about 20 shots easy.  The pitcher was basically pure tequila with a splash of pineapple.  We weren't complaining.  Somehow he managed to get some fresh lime juice on the top.  Next came the tasting. I don't think I have ever had such a strong margarita in my life!   Pretty soon we were good and buzzed.\n\nAfter about a half hour we were seated at a fantastic corner table with a view of all the LOUD drunk folk.  We ordered the queso and the naked rellenos (extra on the naked per my request) both delicious.  The chips and salsa were also tasty.  All the waiters were downright adorable, easy on the eyes and friendly with their mannerisms.  We couldn't finish our pitcher of margaritas though we tried.  It was time to move on.  But I'll definitely be back to this hip spot for some more grub soon and maybe a few less margaritas.

The tables themselves are pretty small too, even the ones with booths, so once all the large plates come out with the different glasses and chips and salsa, the table can get super crammed super quickly.\n\nI had the burrito, most of my friends had the chicken enchiladas with avocado.

I live in the Mission, and there are a lot of places, big and small, which are outstanding eat-out options. This isn't one of them. I didn't dislike anything I ate, but didn't have the kind of superlative experience that others who've reviewed this place did.\n\nAnd lastly: the bad. And it was pretty bad. They were playing loud music which was base-heavy and had a high-frequency beat on a poor sound system. The place was full and noisy, so you got to shout over a drumming ompha ompha ompha throughout the meal. I kept on asking them to turn it down (we were easily the largest group there, although no closer to the loudspeakers than others), They would, and then turned it back up.

On top of that, guacamole, crema, etc. etc.  They are unstoppable.  There hasn't been a time that I didn't get these nachos.  I dream of these nachos.  They are the best.\n\nThe margaritas are great as well, and can be strong at times (somewhat inconsistent in my experience).  I've only actually eaten a main course there twice (I usually stick with only margaritas and nachos), and wasn't particularly impressed either time.\n\nThe first time was some steak dish, which was decent, but the more recent dish I tried was the chicken mole...fairly unpleasant.\n\nBUT, the nachos and margaritas are so good that I can overlook the lack of quality entrees.  And I still haven't mentioned the ultimate topper: the s'more nachos.  The same great chips, covered in crushed graham crackers, cinnamon sugar, mexican chocolate, and topped with flaming marshmallows.  It is amazing.\n\nI highly recommend checking out Velvet Cantina for the lively (yet darker) atmosphere, margaritas, and nachos (x2).", "author": "Will A."}

Not by a new menu item or a change in decor or even the level of service (which remains great!) But instead by the EXTREMELY attractive staff.

The nice staff had no problem letting us occupy a big table during that time rather than spout the dreaded \"we-can't-seat-you-until-your-entire-party-is-here\" line.\n\nWe killed time with a couple of pitchers of deceptively-strong margaritas. It took only two small glasses for some of us to break into a sweat and start feeling happy. We also demolished a few bowls of insanely good queso dip; being the non-foodie that I am, I thought it was made with Velveeta (shut up...you KNOW you love Velveeta too!), but it's actually made with real cheese and at least a few types of peppers. It is creamy, rich, chile-packed perfection.\n\nI chose puerco con chile verde as my entree, mostly because I was curious to find out if it's as good as mine. Mine's STILL the best, but this came pretty close. My only complaint is that it was a tad on the salty side, but if you eat it with refried beans it balances out very well. That also helps to cut the heat, as the dish is quite spicy-hot. The pork was fork-tender and there was plenty of it in the bowl. I would definitely order this dish again.\n\nWhen the moment of truth came (THE CHECK), I did a double-take: 6 adults and 1 child ate their fill, including two pitchers of margaritas, and the entire bill, including tip, was $146.\n\nThat made my cheap little heart do a queso-fueled dance.", "author": "Valeria R."}

It was Sunday night but we were still boozing. I was impressed with the drink menu. It wasn't just your typical girly-frou-frou-fruity-sweet-ass drinks. We tried the Gingerly Ginger, Cilantro Gimlet, and Pineapple Margi (names may be a little off). All of them were good, especially the Ginger one! The Cilantro Gimlet was very different, lacked a little flavor but was still refreshing and satisfying. \n\nFor food the 5 of us shared a bunch of dishes. The chicken Mole was chicken legs which I thought was kind of strange. The sauce was yummy, filled with spice and flavor and different than any I've had. The Garlic Prawns were pretty basic, nothing special. The ceviche was definitely a trendy version and wasn't anything I'd order again. The fish was hard cubes and did not taste marinated. The tortilla soup came in a huge bowl and was not what you would expect of tortilla soup. It was thick and remined me more of an Asian egg drop soup. It was incredibly spicy, which normally I like, but this version was almost difficult to eat. Not at all horrible though.\n\nAll in all, the food wasn't spectacular but it did the trick and I still like the place. The drinks are definitely original and different, it has a nice dark boothy atmosphere, and the food is priced right (dishes around $12).

It's...Velvet Cantina!\n\nI was in here for 15 minutes before realizing I'd actually be here before, and not because of the tequila shots we took the first time. Confusion stemmed from the fact that while the front area looks like a run-of-the-mill restaurant, there's a full bar in the back room.\n\nOkay, maybe a little bit because of the tequila.\n\nThe bar/restaurant intersection makes for an interesting vibe - they blast top 40 music, loud, which you're eating, and while I really enjoyed myself at my roommate's birthday dinner, this definitely isn't a place I'd take my family. With friends though, I can see a leisurely meal turning into drinks, and more drinks, late into the night.\n\nThumbs up to the chicken enchiladas as everyone else has said. I might have to disagree on the magaritas, though - we tried the fresh fruit one, as watermelon was the choice of the day, and they were a little too strong.\n\nThey let you call ahead to put your name on the list, which is a huge plus in my book.", "author": "Lisa W."}

I arrived with my friend to eat some dinner on a Friday night around 8pm. The wait was about 20 minutes so we sat at the bar and ordered a pitcher of their watermelon margaritas. The pitchers are huge, and they don't skimp on the tequila or fresh watermelon puree. The bartenders were funny, and enjoyed conversing with everyone at the bar counter. We were served chips and salsa at the bar while we were waiting for our table which was nice. I must say (and I'm not even close to exaggerating) these were the BEST chips and salsa I've had not only in the city, but ANYWHERE. A fresh tomatoey taste, and the chips were light, salted perfectly, and warm. I crave their chips and salsa just about every day.\n\nWe were seated at a table right around 20 minutes later and were handed more chips and salsa and some menus. I ordered the naked relleno with rice and beans. It didn't take long to get the food out to us and our server was outstanding. Not only did I experience the best chips and salsa ever, but this was seriously the best chile relleno I've ever had as well. Be forewarned... the relleno is SPICY. It was almost too spicy to eat (ALMOST). But I ate every single bite. The refried beans were thick, not soupy, and the rice was perfectly cooked (and you could tell it hadn't been sitting in a serving pan for hours as some restaurants tend to serve crispy spanish rice). \n\nI had a wonderful experience here, and can honestly say that this may be one of my favorite restaurants in the city.

This is one of those restaurants where the chips are so good that you can't stop eating them. This is also one of those places where the margaritas are just as addicting (especially the watermelon margarita!). Thank goodness for all those chips or my colleagues would have seen a whole new side of me dancing on the tables!\n\nAs for the entrees it was a pre-selected menu with 3 choices: steak tacos, chicken enchiladas, or mole chicken. To be honest none of them sounded great to me, but I opted for the enchiladas. Most people got their food after about 30 minutes, but for some small reason my table of 6 or so people didn't get our food until about an hour after everyone else.  And so we ate more chips and drank more margaritas.\n\nOnce my enchiladas finally arrived I was surprised to find that I actually do like enchiladas (who knew?) and regretted filling up on all those chips.  Somehow I discovered some more room for the enchiladas and pretty much cleared my plate...and I wonder why my jeans feel tight after my trip to SF??\n\nAs for dessert Velvet Cantina topped their tasty chips with chocolate and marshmallows.  There was officially no more room in my stomach for this, but I'm not quite sure how I feel about smores made out of chips anyway...even Velvet Cantina chips!", "author": "Andrea R."}

I was a tad disappointed though.  There was a surprising lack of velvet in the decor, and the atmosphere was much more \"WOOHOO TEQUILA\" than \"oh baby, let me lick the salt from your rim\".  \n\nObservation #1, IT'S LOUD IN HERE!  WOOHOO! \n\nObservation #2, bar tenders are hot\n\nObservation #3, where's the velvet?\n\nThey have you enter through the bar side which sets you up for an awkward moment of trying to find someone to help you.  There doesn't appear to be a host, so I guess you just shout over to the bar tender that you want a table.  The initial seating process is a bit clumsy.\n\nOnce we were seated in our not velvet booth, service was pretty good.  The chips were fresh but a little greasy, and the salsa was weird tasting.

Not bad for a cantina eh?\n\nThey've got (what looks like) a great selection of tequila.  Their menu margaritas sounded delicious - but the flavors were mild.  This isn't good or bad either way, but just a heads up.  I believe that evening the seasonal flavors were cantalope, peach and pineapple.  I had the peach margarita and it was very subtle ... not bad mind you, but I sort of wanted a fruitier drink.  In retrospect though - I will admit it's a good thing it wasn't super sugary and sweet because this was 1 stop amongst many that evening.  \n\nBefore we paid our bill, we did a shot of Corozon ... and the bartender gave me one on the house because he felt bad for taking my glass of ice before I was finished with it.

Being from the midwest and having queso as an option (more like a staple) at EVERY TEX-MEX restaurant in middle America, I was soooo excited to hear it was on the menu at Velvet Cantina.  \n\nQUESO=DISAPPOINTING! It  tasted like it was made from powdered cheese and I couldn't even tell there were chili peppers inside because it was so bland.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the tabasco sauce I drenched it with along with the heavy salt and pepper sprinkling didn't even work, and tabasco makes everything better in my opinion.  We also started off with the ceviche, which came with citrus marinated white fish with pineapple, mango, cilantro, and tomatoes, which was OK, nothing great though.  Many, many, other places in SF kick their rear when it comes to ceviche.\n\nThe entrees were the highlight of the meal as we split the chicken quesadillas, the chicken and avocado enchiladas and the achiote steak tacos.  Everything was fabulous!  The table favorite was the chicken/avocado enchiladas which came with a lovely and flavorful jalapeno cream sauce, a spicy pepperjack cheese, and a yummy cilantro pesto sauce.  Very flavorful--I wanted more than I was allotted!  The steak tacos were also wonderful, though the steak was on the tougher side and I was unable to keep my taco assembled correctly, which made it hard to eat.  The tacos were stuffed with thin strips of beef marinated in achiote and lime juice, with pepperjack cheese and avocado.  The chicken quesidillas were simple and exactly how a chicken quesadilla should be.\n\nAll entrees are served with your typical rice and beans (beans good, rice was kind of dry) and an amazing mexican slaw made with cabbage marinated with something like red wine vinegar. Delish! \n\nService was great and ambiance was fun.  Great music - think Bloc Party, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Muse, etc.  For for some reason I was expecting it to be a fancier Mexican restaurant, but it definitely wasn't that, but nicer than a dive I suppose.

The staff was amazing and managed to squeeze all of us in their small dining area (1 star docked for the cramped space). We all had pitchers of margaritas, the strongest margaritas I have ever had! I was worried the food would not be as great as I anticipated, but thankfully it was delicious! Everyone in my party seemed to enjoy their dishes. I got the chicken and avocado enchiladas and fell in love with the dish! \n\nI also appreciated that they had a full bar located on the other side of the dining area so the area was not too cramped. It was nice being able to go back and forth to grab shots and other drinks and bring it back to our table to enjoy with our meal and friends.\n\nAs you can imagine, dealing with the bill was hell with 22 people. However, our waitress divided us into 3 groups and told us that whatever we were short on she would pay out of her own pocket. I wish I would have gotten her name because that was beyond excellent customer service.\n\nI highly recommend this place- excellent food, exemplary service, and strong drinks ;).", "author": "Surge C."}

This place is rad! The interior is super retro and doused in soft red lighting and the soothing flicker of candle light. There are leather booths flanking the walls and a small bar right at the entrance. \n\nMy partner in crime, Noelle and I sidled up to the bar and opted for the late night happy hour option of $2 Tecates (God I love the Mission) and were amazed to hear that shots of Fernet were a mere three bones. Being two, tall, outgoing and sauced up blondes on the town for a much needed girls night out, we quickly made friends with the adorable bartenders and decided to try one of their mind blowing margaritas. They...are...delicious! And, they come by the pitcher should you so desire. \n\nWe danced, we laughed, we drank tequila...and we were home and in bed by 10pm like good little career girls.

The watermelon margarita wasn't my cup of tea, but the lime/original was delicious  (maybe that's why I had 5 glasses over the course of an evening) and strong. The chips and salsa were great too.\n\nWe ordered some appetizers.  I only tried the chicken quesadillas, but they were great.  The chicken was flavorful and moist and the cheese was gooey.

It wasn't just a \"blah\" experience, we actually left there feeling punished. \n\nMy husband and I have been looking for a great go-to spot for Mexican food in the Mission. How hard can that can be, right? Based on the reviews, we thought Velvet Cantina might be it, and had been looking forward to our dinner for more than a week. \n\nThere are two rooms in the Velvet Cantina: a bar/eating area in the front, and some booths and larger tables in the back, off the kitchen. When we arrived at 6:00 (on a Sunday) there was plenty of seating in both rooms, but they ushered us into the back. \n\nThe first thing we noticed was the music: they were playing one type of music up front, and something totally different in the back. It was loud but fun in the front. In the back it was earsplitting, boring disco. I guess it would have been okay for dancing, but we were there to eat and -- one would hope -- talk to each other, for crying out loud.  \n\nThere was only ONE other party in the entire room, a corner booth with three obnoxious, narcissistic, potty-mouthed drunks who were shouting (after all, they had to compete with the music to be heard) remarks about excrement and vomit at the top of their lungs. For some unexplained reason, our seater decided it would be a great idea to put us smack dab next to these boors. (I dunno, convenience?) I realize the restaurant is not responsible for the bad behavior of  drunks, but putting us next to them showed a remarkable lack of awareness. \n\nNot that we should have been surprised, since we were neglected the rest of the meal. The food arrived fast and was mediocre, so any hope of redemption was lost at that point. Our waiter didn't bother with us again until we were done and had been sitting awhile. (Meanwhile, waiters were always within sight of us, madly folding napkins -- another annoying, distinctly obnoxious facet of the dinning experience.) \n\nOnce the table was cleared, we sat. And sat. And sat. The drunks had just left, and we were still entertaining the thought of trying the S'mores Nachos, since we had read about them and thought they sounded fun. However, we were never offered a dessert menu, or even another margarita, for that matter. In the end, we finally signaled for the check and got out of there. \n\nI think one of the saddest things is that there were three parties of tourists, guidebooks clutched in hand, bless 'em, who arrived and were seated near us while the drunks were still there. I hate to think that the Velvet Cantina may have been their definitive \"Mexican food in the Mission\" experience: it does not reflect well on our fair city.", "author": "Paula T."}

We were suppose to wait 1.5 hours for a table for 6, but we got lucky and crammed into a corner booth in 30 minutes.  Immediately, a basket of fresh chips and salsa were put in front of us.  Almost simultaneous, we devoured the entire basket, and more were put in front of us.  And endless fountain of delicious chips, this place is.\n\nFood was pretty good.  I very much enjoyed my chicken avocado enchiladas, and from what I gathered, my friends really liked its vegetarian counterpart, the cactus enchiladas.  The chicken mole was too sweet.

The salsa though, was not the most flavorful in town.\n\nThe Nachos are huge and tasty, add in a couple house margaritas and yum, yum, yum.  I ordered the Achiote steak taco.   There is a layer of cheese in-between the soft shells, which is a nice touch.  I thought the steak was tough and could have been spicier.   Also at our table, was the shrimp enchiladas.  The Enchiladas sauce was really tasty; however, the shrimp inside were 'just ok'.  The chicken mole was excellent.  We ordered Agua frescas, and they were sparkling, which threw us all off the taste.  They had lots of flavor and if you knew you were getting more of a soda, I think it would go over better.\n\nVelvet Cantina is a great place if you want a more upscale Mexican food experience.", "author": "Francis B."}

The guacamole was probably the worst I've ever had. It tasted and looked pasty and there was no spice or flavor in sight! Basically just mashed avocados and that's it. Tacos were the same. There was just no flavor! I doused my meal with Cholula hot sauce but there was no saving it. Needless to say, I actually wished we had gone to Chevy's instead.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-12", "description": "Margarita-mixing has to be one of the most dangerous tasks that bartenders have to carry out on a regular basis.  Margaritas contain nothing but the most volatile flavors that react to create an invigorating intoxicating concoction, so it is absolutely vital that bartenders emulate the precision of chemists when it comes to margaritas.  I say this because my experience with 'ritas at VC has been somewhat inconsistent (anywhere from the best I've had to meh).\n\nBefore you eat at VC, try to forget everything you know about Mexican food.  If you do that, it will be easier to order and you'll appreciate what comes to your table a little more.  VC is a good place for an adventurous palate.  With dishes like Cactus Enchiladas, Azteca Cake, and shrimp diablo, you're sure to eat something fun if you try.  The food is anglicized enough to separate itself from the tejano-bumpin' burrito factories of the mission, but zesty and spicy enough to be appreciated as latin cuisine.  Oddly enough, one of my favorite things about the food is the spicy-cole-slaw-relish-stuff that garnishes the beans and rice.\n\nOl\u00e9!", "author": "Jesse M."}

I mean it's interesting...for tex-mex grill it's far more bar-y than it really is a restaurant. I came in at around 7:30 to meet some friends and as I walked through the front door, I figured it was definitely more of a bar setting than a restaurant. \n\nNonetheless, the food was great. I mean pretty run of the mill tex-mex stylings but the small touches like the pickled cabbages with my quesadilla and the delicious (apparently house made?) chips were real winners. \n\nOh and we should certainly mention the margaritas: 30 for a pitcher that pours essentially 4 is, in a sense, a bit steep but it goes well with the stiffness of the margaritas themselves: really it'll get you going by the first pitcher no doubt. \n\nServers were great. Very friendly and very efficient is generally the mark of a good night. Simple as that. \n\nThe vibe is nice: noisy and dark. Again, the ambiance more of a night club or deep lounge than a restaurant but I guess it's an interesting juxtaposition with the norm. \n\nI'll come back for some drinks and appetizers but I dunno if i'd stick around for dinner...the ambiance and the drinks is what sells it for me but, being in the mission there are a whole host of tasty taquerias serving the same fare for half the price. I'll come back to this joint for happy hour for sure.", "author": "Dzu N."}

Too much goopy crap plopped onto soggy chips?\n\nOh no. \n\nThey were, in fact, the BEST DAMNED NACHOS I'VE EVER EATEN.\n\nSmooth and creamy and complexly flavored cheese sauce is drizzled lovingly over crisp chips, topped with shredded chicken (an add-on) and the appropriate fixins. Even after we were both, indeed, sweating, we couldn't stop scarfing these, like little nacho piggies. \n\nI can't stop thinking about them. \n\nCocktails were great. I had a paloma (grapefruit juice, tequila, soda water, and lime) and it was terrific. Some bars like to add simple syrup to this tart cocktail. Those bars are smoking the crazy. A paloma should have a teensy bit of natural sweetness from the grapefruit, but be otherwise tart and dry. And this one was. So perfect. \n\nAm I giving a restaurant 5 stars based on nachos and cocktails? Hell yes I am. I think you can definitely judge a kitchen by their appetizers, especially on something that's as easy to phone in as nachos. \n\nI'm going to get fat on Velvet Cantina nachos.

Unfortunately, there are few excellent choices in the \"casual\" category (or in the upscale category, for that matter) especially in the Mission, where you can choose between Puerto Alegre or Velvet Cantina amongst the plethora of fine taquerias (Taqueria Cancun being my favorite.) I've been to Puerto Alegre, and while wildly popular, serves pretty sub-par mexican, unless you've have way too many margaritas to notice. \n\nVelvet Cantina has a chill atmosphere, fun mexican decor (not like Chevy's fun, but old-school red candles and unique murals fun), and great food. The menu has a bit of a creative southwestern and cali flair - still has the staples like faijiats, burritos, tacos, etc. but includes dishes like catcus enchiladas (awesomeo), chicken avocado tacos, velvet nachos, and a smore plate for dessert. It's a nice variety, even if it's not the most 'authentic' if you're used to Pancho Villa plates.\n\nMargaritas are fantastic and a good balance of tequila (strong) without being too sweet.

And I have to say, I wasn't disappointed.\n\nAllow me to proceed chronologically.\n\nFirst came the chips and salsa.  Bravo, chips!  Homemade, piping hot, thick, crispy, & with just the right amount of salt.  Salsa was not the most amazing I've ever had, but still pretty good.  We had their Perfect margaritas, which, as I remembered, were fantastic.\n\nThe second course was the guacamole course -- very fresh & green-tasting, with big chunks of avocado, and plenty of it.  (There were two of us, and although we ate a bunch of it, there was still a lot left over.)\n\nCourse three was the ceviche course.  This was a fruity, almost tropical sort of ceviche, with chunks of pineapple mixed in.  I thought the acidity of the pineapple went really well with the acid from the ceviche & really dug it.  My boyfriend wasn't crazy about it, but I thought it was a successful attempt at trying something new & different with a classic dish.\n\nFor my entree, I had the chicken avocado (or was it avocado chicken?) enchiladas - tasty, tender white meat with cheese, topped with a creamy avocado-jalapeno sauce (really good - I only wished there were more of).  And, the obligatory rice and beans were delicious (to me, bonus any time they're more than just garnish & actually worth eating).  My boyfriend had the chili verde pork, which I only tried a little of.  The pork was good, but we both agreed that the green sauce was a bit watery & lacked good spice.\n\n$68 for the two of us after tax & tip (including 2 Perfect margaritas).

If there are several people (or maybe 2?), get the pitcher, although it won't improve the quality of the drinks. So good luck with that. \n\nThe food was even worse. TINY enchiladas, and only two. Over-thick beans, flavorless rice. And the guacamole was more-than-a-little bland. Even the salt shakers on the table didn't work well.

And the sauce was spicy deliciousness (I friggin' wiped the plate clean of the sauce). Yea, I'm glad I ordered the shrimp enchiladas. The refried beans and the rice were also good, and it came with this slaw that was a nice touch.\n\nI had a watermelon margarita that was a little too strong for me, but I tried my friend's pineapple one, and that was dangerously good.\n\nFor dessert, they came out w/this ugly-looking concoction called \"s'mores nachos\" and I was kinda turned off at first. It was chips with chocolate and burnt marshmallows on top. But I couldn't knock it w/out trying it, so I took a bite and OMG....I really liked it! The chips were actually coated in cinnamon and sugar and reminded me of churros, and it was drizzled w/dark chocolate and topped w/broiled marshmallows. The burned parts of the marshmallows surprisingly added a nice touch to all the sweetness. \n\nI would definitely order the same dishes if I go back again, so that already says something!", "author": "Emy s."}

Many years ago (before the remodel) Bruno's was that spot in the Mission for me, however Velvet has certainly become a more than worthy successor.\n\nI've taken dates here, I've met friends here, and I've gone by my lonesome.

T's nachos were three times the size of what they should have been, and she said the cheese sauce was unusual but impeccable. D's veggie burrito was delicious, and I actually liked the addition of chickpeas in it.

My girlfriend asked what I would like to eat.  My answer was somewhere we have never been, preferably Mexican food.  When the name Velvet Cantina was presented as an option in the Mission, I jumped up and headed straight to the door.  What is it about that name?  I love it!  Velvet Cantina.  I didn't even ask if the food was good.\n\nSo we get there and are blessed with rockstar parking within 50 feet of the front door which had to be a sign of good things to come.  As we walked up, I noticed a really cool door and signs that say things like \"Edibles and Elixirs\".  I liked it already.\n\nWe walked inside and we were basically in the bar/lounge area.  We were immediately greeted by a nice woman who asked if we wanted to eat dinner.  We responded that we would like dinner, and she promptly seated us at the perfect booth in the middle of the room.  Looking around, I really liked the feel.  There were red lights hanging down from the ceiling and an interesting bar.  This is the type of place that immediately transforms you once you are in the door and I really liked the ambiance.  My girlfriend agreed.\n\nI believe that there is another dining area that is not attached to the bar (with separate entrance) but we did not notice that until we were leaving.  I only post this because a family might want to dine on the other side, away from the booze.\n\nFirst, the chips rolled out with salsa.  The chips were thick, crispy, and very tasty.  The salsa was thick and chunky...much thicker and chunkier than any restaurant salsa I have ever had.  It was delicious.  We had to have more chips and salsa brought to the table because we ate them so quickly.\n\nNext, it was the ceviche.  Yum!  There were mangos in it, which added a pop of flavor that was very good, and I am not normally a fan of mango.  This plate lasted about half as long as the first basket of chips.\n\nFinally, our main courses arrived.  I had the chicken avocado enchiladas and my girlfriend had the steak tacos.  We both got the refried beans and rice that come with.  They also offered black beans and something else that I can't remember...maybe charro beans, but I am a die-hard refried bean guy.  My plate was fantastic.  My girlfriend agreed after a little taste of my enchiladas.  I tasted her steak and it was also very good.  We were both completely satisfied.\n\nOverall, we didn't have a single complaint between us.  This place is really good and I would return again tonight if asked to go.

Despite our large group taking up half the room, service went smoothly and there were no delays with our food.\n\nDranks: Strong margaritas!  They have different fruit flavors.  I wouldn't drink it for the taste but if you want something with a kick, these will do it.\n\nFood: The complimentary chips & salsa were so good that I couldn't stop eating them.  You would think salsa would be simple to make but it's always surprising to find how many places get it completely wrong.  I got the shrimp diablo for my entree.  It had just the right amount of kick and was packed with flavor.  It was so good that I'm willing to brave crappy Mission parking just to get it again.  The nopales veggie mix was delicious but I did not like the \"Mexican slaw\" AT ALL.  It made me think of a bad knock off of kimchi.  Next time I will definitely try to sub the slaw with something else.\n\nParking: Not surprisingly, parking is horrible.  You can test your luck with street parking (we got lucky) but there is also a parking garage nearby.\n\nService: Great.  Fast.  Friendly.\n\nPrices: Reasonable prices but not cheap.  If you get drinks, expect to pay about $25-30/person.  No drinks, probably around $20.\n\nAmbiance:  It's pretty dark inside.  Nothing fancy.  There is a bar area with dining tables and also a separate room with dining tables only.  If you don't want to be in the very noisy area, you should eat in the separate room where it's a little less noisy.\n\nOverall: Great place for a celebration with a big group.

Overall, the food was very tasty, as well as very reasonably priced.  I highly recommend that you try the Chicken Mole.  I've had a good variety of mole in my life, and nothing compares to this one.\n\nExpanding more on the mole in particular... it came with a choice of refried or black beans, a spicy side (wasn't so memorable), and I had some caesar salad instead of rice because they ran out of rice.  This dish also came with 3 tortillas.  The mole itself had 3 big, tender, and juicy, drumsticks.  I gave one of them away to my friend, and still had enough to fill me up for dinner.  Yes, the tender chicken was pretty cool, but really the warm mole sauce takes the cake.  It had the right balance of cinnamon, chocolate, and sweetness.  It even goes well with the tortilla!  Almost like a Nutella of sorts!\n\nI saw the multiple mentions of poor service.  I can't say that I've noticed this.

I will say that the waiter was gorgeous, but a waiter's tip cannot be given on good looks alone. \n\nOur main dishes somewhat salvaged the night - the burrito was decent and the chicken avocado enchiladas were nothing if but creative.

I brought my ex-stepmom here for what was supposed to be a sorta trendy, what-the-kids-are-into kind of dinner, and we ended up with a sorta shitty, \"is this what the kids are into? because your generation has no taste\" kind of dinner.\n\nI'm not trying to be overly harsh; I know people are doing the best they can with their businesses and fuck yelp for providing an open forum to spread detrimental information like how the space looks like a glossed-over italian joint in des moines, or the \"ceviche\" is swimming in a cold tom kha and nearly impossible to eat without splashing coconut milk all over one's shirt.  \n\nBecause the service was really sweet and helpful and cool, and the tasty margaritas sort of make it okay that the taco plate is straight out of Chevy's, and that they were out of sangria (which had they had it  would have made everything seem more palatable.)\n\nIt's the only place I've had to struggle to meet the cozmo card's $40 food minimum, and the only place that's been a stickler about it.

My wife and I had heard that this was a pretty decent place and, frankly, we were intrigued by the name.  My wife had the shrimp enchiladas and I had the chicken mole.  The enchiladas were okay, and the mole was actually pretty decent.  My wife had a beer and I had a margarita.\n\nIf all of this sounds pretty mundane, that's because it is.  See, we're not really \"watermelon margarita\" type of people.  We had heard that this was a decent Mexican place, and in the Mission, if you're a decent Mexican place, that means you're actually pretty good.   What we later realized is that the people who think this is a decent Mexican place are actually more interested in the various types of nontraditional margaritas they serve, and the loud rave music.  I can tell you that the cackling 20somethings celebrating a bridal shower in the booth next to us freaking loved it.  For me and my party...it was...not bad.\n\n\nService: 3 stars; no major mistakes, neither fast nor slow\nFood: 3 stars; the selection is okay, and the mole is really quite tasty, but everything else was just ho-hum.\nAmbiance: 2 stars; loud and dark.  Like I said, this is a Mexican joint for people who would rather be at a rave.\nPrice: 3 stars; I thought it was a little expensive for what you got.  I'd reviewed the menu on-line before going, so I wasn't surprised at the prices, but I was surprised at the portions.\n\nOh, one thing I will say: the chips were pretty damn tasty", "author": "Thomas K."}

Velvet Cantina seemed to have pretty good reviews so we headed down to the Mission to give it a try. From the moment we walked in we loved the decor and vibe. We sat down and ordered the guacamole and a pitcher of margaritas. For me the guacamole wasn't anything to write home about. It just seemed to be missing something. The trick is to dip your chip in both the salsa and the guac. The combination of the two flavors is right on point! The chips and salsa that they bring to your table were definitely good, although the chips were a bit thicker and heavier than I like. Since we had a really big lunch earlier, we decided to go light on food. We ordered the appetizer tacos and it was exactly what we needed. The appetizer tacos certainly will not fill you up if you are looking for a full meal, but they are just the right size when all you need is a little snack. As for the flavor, the tacos were delicious! The chicken was tender and the sauce was something special. Finally, the best part was the margaritas! Its $25 for a pitcher and not a small pitcher either! It was worth it to go there just for the margaritas. \n\nFinal synopsis: Its not the best Mexican place I've ever been too but its most definitely not the worst. Its got some highs (tacos, salsa, MARGARITAS) and then some lows (guacamole, chips) and its certainly worth a try if you are looking for a Mexican place.", "author": "Julie M."}

I went back completely sober on a hot hot day looking forward to some cool margaritas for a little birthday dinner. First of all, I have to say I like how dark it is inside, sort of sets the tone. What that tone is, I'm not sure, but I like it. Cue up pitchers of booze, which is never a bad thing in my book. The margs were interesting mixes of watermelon and pineapple flavors, a little sweet for my particular boozerific palette, but still delicious. And I have to say, the food was pretty darn tasty, even without beer googles on (or beer tastebuds, or drunk munchies or whatever phrase the kids are using). I could only eat half of my bordello burrito, though, it was the size of a house cat.

What the hell happened to you Velvet Cantina?! \n\nFirst, after got in, we decided to get some drinks. The bar was between shifts, so it was chaos. I just wanted a beer and a mixed drink. They were making pitchers of margaritas, and setting up the bars, and blah, blah.. It was taking forever! We had to end up sitting down because my brother was on his way in and we were surprising him. \n\nThe chips and salsa were good. The apps were meh.. The nacho-type cheese that everything was topped with- nachos, sopes, and empanadas had a burned taste. Not good. \n\nThe entrees weren't any better. The rice tasted old. You know the taste- stale, kind of crunchy. THEN- my bros friend found a long blond hair in his taco. WTH? And of course he announced it to our entire party- which sucks because then everyone is double-checking their food for hair. It just turns off the entire meal. The server did comp his dinner, which was only right. \n\nOur server was meh too- didn't seem very happy to be serving a large group. I don't see why not..

Everyone kept raving about the house-made tortilla chips and the margarita pitchers, so I decided it was time to investigate.\n\nWe were promptly seated despite not having a reservation. The venue is rustic and warm with random brick-a-brack decor and quirky paintings on the walls. Great ambiance. I'm not sure who owns the place, but judging by the youthful, handsome all-male waitstaff, it must be a cougar or a horny old gay guy (either way, no complaints here).\n\nThe chips & salsa were indeed some of the best I've had in SF and the margarita pitchers pack a hardy punch (I was looking forward to the Cucumber Serrano shot, but alas... it had been 86ed for the evening). Our group ordered family style.  \n\nAlthough the portions are fairly substantial, most of it is beans and rice. The Bordello Burrito in particular was suffering from serious rice overkill. You literally had to cut into the middle of the burrito to discover the nucleus of meat. The chef at Velvet Cantina knows how to do a great sauce... unfortunately its not used enough. Ultimately, I found the food a little underwhelming. If I had to recommend something, I'd suggest sticking with the quesadilla or the nicely-marinated tri-tip.\n\nAs the evening progressed, the crowd in the restaurant grew significantly louder and larger. At one point, a group of rowdy bros & bro-hoes were practically hovering over our table, which was mildly annoying. Arrive early so you can be out before the chaos commences.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back at some point to try the S'more Nachos.

The crowd was lively and it was VERY crowded on a Saturday night.  Even with reservations, we had to wait another 10 minutes for the table to become available.  We noticed a lot of large groups and couples having dinner/drinks.  We decided to grab some margaritas at the bar until we were seated.  We ordered the raspberry and blueberry margaritas.   They were both great, but I didn't really taste the fruit flavors like I thought we would.   They were very strong though...I got a buzz off of one drink!  \n\nWe were seated in a cozy booth near the front of the restaurant.  The chips they serve are so addicting and delicious.  They could possibly be the best chips I've ever had.  The salsa was pretty good too.   We decided to start with the chile con queso and the carne y queso empanadas.  YOWZA.  These were so good.  The queso was smooth and creamy...it went perfectly with the chips.  The empanadas had a fantastic flavor and they were served on a bed of rice and beans.  I would highly recommend these appetizers.  \n\nFor our entrees, we chose the tri-tip and the steak tacos.

(Gawd, I hate that saying.)\n\nWe started the night out with pitchers of margs, fried tortilla chips, REALLY good salsa and REALLY good queso. Then we shifted into thin, and flaky quessadillas and black bean nachos. We were nowhere near done. I ordered the chicken avocado enchiladas which sounded kind of boring, but were a party in my mouth. The Mole dish is hands down the best things to order even though it is SUPER spicy. The sauce reeks (in a good way) of cinnamon. The meat is so tender that it falls apart at the sign of a knife and fork. To top the night off, we attempted to eat the flaming Smore nachos. Very clever, dudes. I wish I had enough room to fit it all in my bellay, but sadly I did not. I think i did walk out of there with an extra arse and a few hundred extra pounds. \n\nCome here for a date night or to catch up with the honeys. The restaurant is split into two creating a more romantic mood in one section and a more party atmosphere in the next room with a bar. Yes, me likey. Thanks for making me a heffer, VC.", "author": "Melody L."}

I tried to be the gentleman, doing all the chivalrous crap like ordering for her and leaving her the last shrimp.\n\nWe sat at the bar, and were well taken care of by the bartender who grabbed us chips and salsa right off and mixed a mean pair of cocktails.  The Ginegr-Ginger was great, but did nothing to cool my palate, so if you order it, get a glass of water too.  The ceviche was more like soup-viche with a bunch of tasty shrimp swimming in a bowl of coconut milk, pineapple and lime juices.  Different from what I am used to, but good.  The queso was good too, a real cheddar and jack concoction, which is a giant step above the melted Velveta that a lot of places are slinging in this city. \n\nI hope she calls me back.", "author": "Quinn S."}

Here's why:\n-the food (well, the chicken & avocado enchiladas - they're so amazing i've never tried anything else on the menu) is incredible. the queso & guac are divine. the margaritas are strong. all in all, perfect.\n-the prices are totally reasonable. most recently i went with a group eight - we went through several pitchers of margaritas, had starters, etc. and the bill was $250. seemed fair.\n-the atmosphere is fun (though it's always packed so make a reservation) albeit loud, and the service is attentive but not aggressive. The bar is a little hectic but that's a good sign.\nThe worst part about Velvet Cantina is definitely the parking issue (but where isn't that the case?).\nGo!", "author": "Megan Q."}

It was really good, not spectacularly outstanding or anything, but there was a lot of it (at least a lot of beans and rice)!\n\nThe weird thing though was, after about 10 min. of getting our food a dude comes by and asks if we're done with everything.  I'm shoveling rice and beans into my face...so no, we weren't done yet.  Our regular watiress checked on us twice during the meal before we asked for the check.

The place has a cool atmosphere and we got a table in the back behind the bar.  We got a couple of pitchers of margarita's which were OK.  I wasn't a huge fan of the unique mix they made which seemed like it had some fruity Schnapps kind of liquor in it.  But it wasn't terrible.  The chips at this place are great, crsipy crunchy and still warm when you get them.  We ordered some nachos and as soon as I saw them I realized this place was not a as authentic a mexican joint as I was figuring it would be. (the name of this place should have been my first hint).  The nachos were decent, not great.  I got the steak tacos for dinner and they were quite good and their servings were big.  \n\nIts interesting that a few people have reviews complaining about feeling sick since Jason R had the shrimp and it seemed to disagree with him.

The way it works with us is he picks a Genre, and I pick the place. \n\nI had been meaning to try Velvet Cantina for awhile - I had heard good things about it, and was always curious to see what exactly they offered. It's an odd little spot; it's two rooms (what looks like it used to be 2 separate businesses at one point in time) that are now mashed together as a restaurant/bar. They were very nice over the telephone when I placed the reservation, but there was definitely a little bit of fumbling when we got into the restaurant. The boys that were fumbling were cute though, so that always helps. We get lead to the back room to our table, and it was a nice cozy booth. Water was brought out quickly, and we ordered drinks - he got a beer, and I got a watermelon margarita. Chips were also brought out, and those were DELISH. Really, freshly made. We pretty much destroyed those, but it took them awhile to bring out another basket.\n\nWe decided against a starter, for some odd reason, and he ordered the Tri-Tip Steak, and I got the Naked Relleno peppers. Both were served with beans and rice, which were really nicely seasoned. The Relleno was nicely spicy, and the watermelon margarita cooled off some of that heat. The portions were generous - though he cleaned his plate, I had enough left over to take it to work the next day. A word of advice; if you take home leftovers from Velvet Cantina, they are amazing the next day, when all the flavors get to meld together.\n\nSo why only 3 stars? The place was just OK. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't horrible either. This isn't the best date place if groups decide to descend upon Velvet Cantina, because it gets LOUD quickly, which is a mixture of the actual restaurant fixtures and the pitchers of Margaritas that are available off the menu. Service was just OK, and I felt like we could have been checked in on a bit more. Their sign says \"alluring edibles and drinks\". Were they alluring? No. Where they good? Yes.

I like to taste a bit more of the watermelon rather than just pure tequila.\n2) Chips - I was starving so I ate up the chips but they aren't my favorite.

Sure, it's not authentic Texas queso, but it's velvety smooth nonetheless. Hmm...maybe that's why the joint is called Velvet Cantina. \n\nNewly reopened after a kitchen fire, the Cantina is back to serving up greatness. I've never heard any complaints about any of the food (is this due to the drunken state we are always in when we eat there?). The service is always top-notch; including last night, when we had to wait over an hour for our table (note: get there early). As a show of goodwill, the owner gave our starving group 2 plates of nachos and a round of margaritas. Now that's customer service.\n\nMaybe the only downside to the VC is the price. There are plenty of delicious taquerias nearby serving similar fare for less. But then again, that comes without the delicious queso, the margaritas and the atmosphere.

So effin good that I could have seriously skipped my entree and filled up on their chips, salsa and guacamole! The chicken avocado enchiladas were yummy. The chicken was well seasoned, although some bits were a bit too salty. I love the chunks of fresh avocado in the enchilada, it gives it a nice creamy texture.  Even their black beans are full of flavor!\n\nNow, the margaritas are another story!! We ordered a pitcher of the watermelon margarita and man they were strong!! They tasted like watermelon infused tequila over ice. Okay, that sounds sorta good, but it wasn't my preference. I think the fact that they use real fruit juice, makes the margaritas taste stronger because the fruit sinks to the bottom of the pitcher. The bottom of the pitcher tasted better and more balanced. Note to self: next time ask them to add more fruit!\n\nOverall, the service was pretty on point. We were a party of 8 and it was my birthday. The atmosphere is very casual, low key and almost homey.

My boyfriend is a chef and the best thing he had to say about the food is that the cook has good knife skills. The veggie sopes had the exact same cold cactus potato filling as the naked relleno and the beans tasted out of a can, zero flavor. \nAlso the guacamole is just plain avocado with some lime juice, no onions or cilantro or anything. The dish they served it in was severally cracked and kind of disturbing.\n\nThe service got a little more attentive towards the end of our meal but the server  walked by multiple times and never even noticed the stack of dirty plates that we had pushed to the end if the table. \n\nWhen the check came, I ended up leaving over 20% tip because I didn't have the patience to wait for our server another 15 minutes to get change. \n\nRight before we left the guy made a comment about things being crazy in there tonight but if you have a busy restaurant you should hire people who can handle it.

The menu is more interesting than regular tex-mex so it's a good place to go when you're looking for food more interesting than your regular tacqueria. I had:\n\n- Naked Relleno: An egg-free & unfried take on the Chilli Relleno and it was quite good. The chilli is filled with small chunks of bell pepper, chilli, potato, and an almost obscene amount of cheese (I had cheesy strings flying all over the place). I do think it would be better with some egg scrambled into the mix. It's covered with an interesting almost-mole like red sauce - I thought the flavors were more Indian than Mexican, but it was super good. The dish comes served with a heaping amount of beans (the black beans are very good and flavorful) and rice (really good mexican rice). I cleared the entire plate plus a side salad and half a basket of chips, so don't expect to share this entree with anyone. The other interesting vegetarian entree was Cactus Enchiladas which I'm excited to try at some point in the future.\n- Chips & Salsa: The chips are way too greasy (like you can actually see the shinyness) but are good and salty with drinks. The salsa is amazing - super thick, super fresh, and really flavorful. \n- Ginger Ginger: A delightful tequila cocktail. Warning - do not try to eat the ginger chunks because they taste like straight alcohol...unless that's your thing, then you'll love them.\n\nI would definitely come back to Velvet Cantina, whether for drinks & apps or dinner or for a gabfest with girlfriends or a date...it's pretty perfect for all of that.", "author": "Jasmine A."}

After noting the presence of a full bar and late hours it seemed like it would be hard for the V.C. to walk away with anything less than 4 stars. However, with a few adjustments, I think that the cantina can be vastly improved.\n\nGrouse #1-Salsa is hurting in the spice department. I asked if they had anything spicier, nope. Then asked for some chopped jalapenos. Our waiter was compassionate in regards to our spice plight and eventually brought us a bottle of habanero hot sauce. I liked the hot sauce b/c it wasn't a vinegar based hot sauce like tapatio or tabasco, but more pureed chiles. It was also fiery hot.\n\nGrouse numero dos-Tried the serrano infused tequila with cucumber puree drink. The cucumber elements were refreshing but I found the serrano tequila to be acrid and harsh tasting, perhaps a squeeze of lime could balance out the drink. I think I would go margarita next time. \n\nGrouse 3-The chicken avocado enchiladas ($10.99) have jalapeno cream sauce listed in the description. I prefer enchiladas that arrive in a pool of sauce and with just a squiggle of sauce on the top, these guys were a bit dry. Without a hearty napping of sauce, the tortillas became tough after a few minutes on the table.\n\nOk, grousing aside, I *loved* the chips at Velvet Cantina. If we could get a spicy salsa option, I would be there frequently for chips and drinks if not more. Warm, tender cornbread forms the base for tasty pollo asado sopes ($5.99). The white tortilla soup ($4.99) was a large enough portion to share. Shreds of chicken were hidden under the submerged sour cream empanada. My fellow eater enjoyed the soup and I was more ambivalent about it, nothing too exciting, but a decent start to a meal. After reading various reviews in the weeklies, I recalled people mentioning bland beans. As a refritos lover, I hoped that this had been improved upon. Refried pinto beans were creamy enough and went well with the freshly fried chips. \n\nI think that the cantina could be a successful fit to the neighborhood with a few improvements (spicier!). With a cheap late night happy hour and top notch chips, I wouldn't mind whiling away a night here. Plenty of booths to chill out in with friends too.", "author": "Candice L."}

Even though there are countless amazing taquerias, it's tough to find a fun, reasonably priced Mexican restaurant with great food that is good for groups. That's where Velvet Cantina comes in. \n\nThe decor is fun -- red vinyl booths (think of the booths at the old Brunos) and it's located in the heart of the Mission (the perfect pre-party destination). \n\nThe supply of chips is endless.... And these are GOOD restaurant chips.... I've ordered the guac appetizer and I think there must have been 4 avocados in my guac! The margaritas are muy fuerte. Seriously, they are the strongest margs I have ever tried. So, be careful all you drivers, it could be pretty easy to pull a Paris Hilton after 1 margarita at Velvet Cantina. \n\nOf the appetizers, I like the quesadilla and the empanadas. The nachos are to-do-for, but should probably be treated as a meal and not an appetizer. \n\nThe entrees are enormous as well because they all come with very generous portions of rice and beans. I love the steak tacos and the enchiladas. \n\nAnd for dessert, there's an incredible smores nachos. \n\nNY may have Rosa Mex, La Esquina,  and Dos Caminos, but SF has Velvet Cantina! More food, more character and less $!.", "author": "Colleen S."}

Don't go for a romantic night out, it's so loud in there, you have to yell across the table most nights. However, go there with your large group (they make reservations) or smaller - as it's a good way to get the party started. Service is solid, usually extremely friendly, accommodating and attentive. Food is quick, with delicious chips and salsa served immediately on seating, hot and consistent. The interior is dated, 70's style vinyl booths, tile topped tables and dark lighting, but charming none the less.

It is served with a spicy relish on the side, which I also like and the burrito is presented with sauce on top with swirls of sour cream or similar.

The fresh fruit margarita of the day had three choices: pineapple, mango, and watermelon. After checking out the glass vs pitcher prices, we chose a pitcher of the pineapple - great idea! Fresh pineapple (not just juice) was blended with tequila and tasted sooo good, not too sweet. Our one friend said it was pretty strong, but I didn't really think so? I actually seasoned mine with a little of the chile salt, which gave it some welcome heat. Towards the end, I did get some threads of pineapple at the bottom, which was a little unpleasant. After that first pitcher was drained, we decided to get one more but chose the House version instead. It was actually really good too. We did have to ask for salted rims on the glasses though (salt was also missing from round 1 - it would have been awesome had we had some of that chile salt on the rims!) which irked me a little. The other thing that was irksome was that shortly before 11, our server asked us to cash out with him because he was starting his end-of-night paperwork. All right, I guess we won't order more drinks then! There were still a few customers in addition to our table and we all hung out for at least another half hour, so it was kind of awkward to have had to pay already.

It would also be ideal for a single to belly up to the bar. ;) \nThe food is okay, I think your going more for the vibe & bar scene then the food. The logo sure is catchy though: edibles & elixirs put a smile on my face before I even stepped in the door. \nThe hits at the table were: Cornbread sopas w/ pollo asada, pepper jack cheeses, refried beans, salsa & sourcream. AND the Avocado cactus enchiladas. I was unimpressed with my Chimichurri Caesar salad with tri-tip but that is my own fault for ordering a salad at a Mexican restaurant... The chips and salsa were okay and the guacamole was good. I will go back just for the cool Kitchy vibe and margaritas...next time I will try the empanadas!!", "author": "Michele K."}

The \"edibles and exilirs\" tagline on the sign outside had always sounded pretty appealing to me, ever since this place opened, but I hadn't heard anyone talking about this spot, nor had I noticed a particularly large crowd there at any time, so I never made the effort to go until last week. \r\n\r\nWe had a few drinks at the bar, and then moved to a table to order food. A friend and I shared the ceaser salad and the prawns el diablo. Both dishes were healthy-seeming and had a home-cooked feel to them, which I liked! The food was definitely spicy, especially the salad, which is great if you like that. Otherwise, you should mention that you prefer it milder. Overall, I would say that this place works out well if you're in the mood to go out, but you don't want to deal with a lot of chaos, crowds or noise. It's more of a chill, relaxed vibe, could be romantic even, with the dim lights and velvet curtains. Good stuff.\r\n\r\nPretty resonable prices for what it was, and the portions were sizable. The chips and salsa are also worth mentioning-totally satisfying, and again, had that same fresh, home-y feel to them. Very excellent pico de gallo style salsa, which is my fave, you know, when the pieces of tomato and onion are actually discernable. And the chips were hot, crunchy and puffy. \r\n\r\nIn terms of service, our server was a nice guy who was totally on top of things.

We stopped into Beretta for post drink drinks and they did a better job with the tequila (and mezcal, to boot!) than Velvet Cantina. \n\nWhy are you, bartender, shooting top-shelf tequila with patrons throughout the whole night. I take issue more with the shooting than the drinking with patrons...which I actually kind of enjoy sometimes. But dude put down like 3 shots within an hour. \n\nStrawberry and blended margaritas with top-shelf tequila. Ack! What a waste.", "author": "Eric E."}

The steak tacos were savory, tender, GOOD --- no, GREAT. The margaritas were pretty good and pretty strong, especially the mango one. The watermelon one was tasty though. mmhmmm.

I am going to celebrate my birthday here for that. \n\nThe waiters were chill, always on top of things, and just fun.

They were all troopers and deserve plenty of gold stars. Everyone was so accommodating and the employees made sure to give us the quality service with a smile that makes this place so enjoyable. \n\nThe establishment itself is very cozy and the decor reminds me of a little dining room in a mission. We were all promptly seated and our server did great in taking all of our orders, including serving the pineapple margaritas that were flowing throughout the evening. Three words: STIFF AS FUCK. There may have been a hint of pineapple juice in there but my mind was muddled by all the tequila that permeated my bloodstream. It's definitely a sign that you have paid your money's worth on drinks. Just get a pitcher of this stuff and you're set for the night. After the libation we all got our free chips and salsa and our orders. I had the chicken avocado enchilada which was so delicious. The portions were ample and satisfying which helped to soak up some of that margarita. Afterward we ordered the smores nachos which they served to you tableside by a blow torch to give you a good show with oohs and aahs. Also it gives it a little campfire feel. The nachos were definitely a hit and consumed in a matter of seconds. If you've got a party and need to fulfill that sweet tooth, I would advise you to get this dessert.\n\nIf you're planning on getting here by car, be aware that parking is quite a hassle and it would be advisable to take public transportation or ride your bike through. Especially after those margaritas and trips to the bar, it would be smart to not drive and enjoy yourself. I would definitely take another trip back here.", "author": "Leslie K."}

WATERMELON MARGARITA:    What was non-drinker BF thinking?!!!! Last time and only time I saw him drink was in Jan 2008 during our cruise.  He said it was cheaper to order a pitcher than 2 drinks.  Well, we paid for it!  The margarita tasted mellow and was deceptively strong. It tasted fresh, delicious and easy to drink.  I abandoned my wine (I didnt want to drink hard liquor initially but lost focus after the first sip of the watermelon margarita.) Yes, we finished the whole pitcher!!!\n2. COMPLIMENTARY CHIPS/SALSA:   Thick-cut freshly fried chips. Not salty. Not greasy.  Fresh tomato salsa. Addicting.\n3.  FISH CEVICHE:    Mango salsa compliments the fish. Fresh. Not fishy. Light. Healthy option. \n4.  EMPANADAS:    Yummy but the rice and beans the 2 beef/chorizo empanadas came with overpowered the real taste of the pies.\n5.  SHRIMP DIABLO:   Generous portions of fresh shrimps with rice, pickled veggies and steamed beans/diced potatoes simmered in tomato salsa. Really good.\n6.  CHICKEN AVOCADO ENCHILADA:   BF enjoyed it very much that he was disappointed when the plate was cleared before he finished the last bite. (My bad!) 2 fresh light enchiladas with rice and beans.\n7. S' MORES:    Redundant. Fried chips with chocolate drizzle, cinnamon and marshmallows. Just okay.\n\n***********************\nWe did not have \"wow\" moments with the dishes because the flavors were not strong but CLEAN. The dishes were light but they were delicious.  We did not feel grossly stuffed although we did eat a lot.  I will say that the food was superb in flavors in their simplicity and freshness.\n\nThe margarita at Velvet Cantina is a must-have. What was I thinking ordering a glass of wine, instead?!\n**********************\n9:15 PM:  BF and I got out of Velvet Cantina barely walking and staggering drunk.\n\n9:25 PM:  Made it to the Metreon and killed time by playing at the arcade where I won 3 stuffed animals in one shot!\n\n10:00 PM:  Saw \"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian.\"  Love it!\n\n12:20 AM:  Caught the last BART train to the North Oakland while both of us were trying not to retch on the train.\n\n1:30 AM:  In bed.

Our group banded together for Margaritas and some grub following a long workweek. We arrived with a group of 5 and grabbed some Margarita pitchers and chips (that were a bit stale and oily) and found a standing room only area big enough to accommodate. \n\nUpon entering this was definitely unlike any of the Mexican joints I have hit up in the Mission. The bar radiates with trendiness, from the red lights to excessive bartender attitude, to the style of the crowd...something that should be expected from a Cantina named Velvet. \n\nThe pitchers were expertly prepared (not the tastiest, but well prepared), so the bartender's attitude was well backed. The crowd was lively and happy which made for a good social environment. Can't say much for the wait as it was well over an hour before we were seated and the guy seating could probably teach lessons in being catty and rude. \n\nUpon being seated at a table too small. We were set up with another round of drinks and \"fresh\" chips and salsa (Salsa was fairly good). My GF ordered chicken quesedillas and I went with the chile verde. One of our friends ordered a taco and enchilada. \n\nI was warned the Chile Verde was a bit spicy and I would have to agree. Decent...nothing to write home about. Mostly a stew of lime juice and chile powder with fresh cilantro...but no other undertones. The pork was a bit dry for a chile verde. Black beans were in the place of the refried beans I actually ordered. They had a bit of cheese for garnish but no real flavor...same can be said for the spanish rice. I'm not a big salad person so I can't speak to the rabbit food portion. \n\nMy girlfriend only had a couple of 'dillas cause she didn't care much for them. I tried one and it was a bit underwhelming as well; lots of minced chicken, seasoned with chile powder, and cheese that could not be seen but you knew it was there as something was kinda holding the chicken to the tortilla. The grease flavor was a bit heavy considering the tortillas were very lightly browned...so again lacking rich flavor other than chile powder and oil...it had some heat though. Our friends didn't seem too impressed with their orders either. This was just a once around for us at VC but it won't be a return for food. As the food's substance seemed to match the less than jovial attitude of the staff. I would recommend trying it on a less busy day for dining and different entrees than those we had.\n\nIn the end, it was a good social environment for drinks.

So dark you can't even see what's in your plate. The salsa is unimaginably disgusting. It really was water with a hint of salt and a few chunks of tomato slush. I ordered chille rellenos. Man was that bad. I'm not even Latino and I know when I've been served bad Mexican food. The worst part of the whole experience was that my friend and I got sick after dinner. Don't even attempt the ceviche. My friend and I were the only ones to eat that crap and so we were the only ones who got sick. Nauseuous and puked the whole night. I'd give it zero star but the server who helped us was nice and attentive.

It was okay I guess; he's been wanting to come here for a while and I'm sure he thought I had a great time.  I think he busted me texting one of my friends for a \"rescue call\" when he came back from the bathroom.\nIt was really loud, mostly from the one waiter/bartender that did not have an inside voice and kept shouting to the other across the restaurant and swearing like a sailor.  He was professional.  At least he offered up something for us to talk about as we struggled to make small talk.\nThe fresh watermelon margarita was yummy, but the margarita flavor overwhelmed the watermelon flavor.  I tried a sip of the date's ginger drink and it was definitely gingery!  Spicy on the tongue, ginger on the palate - not my cup of tea but he liked it.\nThe coconut-lime ceviche was very sweet and I'm going to have to refer to it as pina colada shrimp since that's seriously what it tasted like with the coconut milk and the pineapple.  It came almost as soup, in a bowl full of \"broth\" with a spoon.  I liked it best when I got some cilantro too, otherwise it tasted like a crustacean dessert.\nThe chili con queso was good; they seem to use actual cheese as opposed to Velveeta or that other nacho melty cheese.  The guy asked if I wanted to get this and I said \"No,\" so he got it anyway.  Wtf?  I've recently discovered that melty cheese and chips make me violently ill, most likely due to the fact that I have no \"off\" switch when mowing through these and I end up eating enough to satisfy an entire ballpark full of nacho fans.\nI hear the food is divine, so I'll definitely try this spot out again, especially since s'mores nachos sound like potentially the best idea ever.  Next time I'll go with someone else though, I am never calling this guy again, despite the 13 texts and messages he's already left for me.  STALKER.  What was I thinking?

First let's start on the food.  I started out w/ the ceviche which was adequate but nothing like the ceviche I had in Costa Rica.  I then had the tri-tip and it was very good but not crazy good like everyone is making it out to be.  I didn't have the drinks, but everyone else at the table said that the margaritas were fantastic\n\nNow let's get into why I gave this restaurant 2 stars.  My friend had gotten the organic chicken enchiladas WITHOUT avocados because is incredibly allergic to it.  He mentioned this (allergy, effects, et al.) to the waitress 3 times as we ordered.  After we got our main course, about 10 minutes into eating it, my friend finds not just one piece of avocado, but avocado all over the inside of his enchilada.  We flagged down the nearest waiter to let them know of the faulty order.  He then flagged down our waitress who in turn just made a ton of excuses as to why it came out the way it did.  So she asked if he wanted another dish to which he said yes cuz he should try to eat to see if he can subside the side effects of his allergic reaction.  She kept on coming back making excuses about how this happened and didn't apologize once.  The initial waiter on the other hand kept on coming back to check on my friend and kept on apologizing.  After my friend got his meal, he couldn't even touch it and we pretty much ended our meal shortly after that.  He ended up sending the meal back eventually too.  When we got the check we noticed that they had comp'd his initial meal but charged us for the second plate that he had ordered.  We pinged the waitress and she was like of course we're gonna charge you for a meal.  And at that point that's when all of us went into an uproar.  How can a restaurant that knows they did something wrong have the audacity to charge for a meal that they knowingly messed up!  She was all flustered that she had to call her manager and was visibly annoyed by all of this.  Needless to say when she came back the manager had comp'd the entire meal and we left no tip.  We did however give a tip to the one waiter guy who did check in on my friend.  The only reason why this place got 2 stars was due to that one waiter.  The waitress though can go to obedience school w/ some chihuahuas.", "author": "Swarup B."}

It was packed on a Saturday night, but we were told the wait will be about 10 mins. That estimate was pretty off since we ended up waiting for about 30 mins instead. We got some seats at the bar right after we walked in, so the extended wait was a non-issue for us. The Palomas were good, but I do miss the toronja Fresca in my Palomas when I'm in Mexico. Once we were seated, we ordered the empandas and the chicken avocado enchildas to share. I thought the empandas were ok, but the bff liked them a lot. And she also really liked the enchiladas (which is a big deal because she is the pickiest eater I know) and said it really reminded her of her mom's cooking. I though the enchiladas were great too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-22", "description": "i just discovered this place, 2 blocks from my house.  SO GOOD! so nice to have a mexican restaurant - as opposed to a taqueria - so close by.  it reminds me of the old style mexican places i grew up with in L.A. - El Cholo, El Coyote, Gardens of Taxco, etc. Old school.  dark, booths.  love the bordello decor.  and a good dinner soundtrack!  fun waiters who promise not to piss in your next drink when they overhear you complaining that the margarita was made with a mix rather than fresh lime juice (ala Tommy's on Geary) - then he brought me one with made w/lime - and no discernable pee!\n\nEveryone's right - the chips are yummy.  Salsa is good too, blended texture, not chunky, but with good flavor.  coulda used a bit more heat, for my taste.  We had the coconut shrimp ceviche to start.  A bit too sweet for us - a bit like dessert - again, coulda used some heat - but we still ate every bite.  with the yummy chips.  my sister had the marinated steak (which wasn't on the online menu), totally tender, juicy, perfectly pink, served with a jalapeno cream sauce, sauteed potatoes and nopalitos, a wonderfully crunchy and tart pickled cabbage thing, and rice.  The rice:  i judge Mexican restaurants by their rice, having grown up in So.Cal. (glad that's over) and attending many a quinceanera in my day, and thereby having tasted a lot of authentic, homemade mexican rice.  it should be firm, with separate grains, not mushy, the taste should smack of cloves, and a hint of garlic, it should have almost a slightly smokey flavor.  and it should be a robust orangy color, flecked with specks of tomato paste.  the individual grains should be flexed, not straight, so that they almost look like little jumping jack men.  i'm serious - i've had lots of good rice!\n\nwell, Velvet Cantina's wasn't that, but it wasn't bad. and it grew on us the more we ate it, especially when mixed with the black beans i was given by a pleasant mistake (i'd asked for refried).  they were DELICIOUS, more like cuban black beans.  my entree was the nopalitos, potato and pepper jack cheese enchiladas, also with the jalapeno cream sauce.  YUM.  gooey but not overly saucy, the tortillas had obviously just been fried so they were not too greasy and not hard, just perfectly al dente.  i usually order a meat entree of some sort, but since my sister was having the steak, i tried this.  and i'm not a fan of chicken (dirty bird!)  that said, we had a friend join us late and we ordered the chicken enchiladas for her.  i had a bite - the chicken was nicely spiced, not like so many other chicken enchiladas where the bird is just boiled and tasteless.\n\nI was sad they were out of the serrano chile/cucumber elixer, but our friend had some kind of cilantro tequila thing that was very refreshing.\n\ni'm definitely going back, and with so many other ridiculously good restaurants in this City still to try, that's saying a lot.", "author": "maria a."}

I don't know what is in the $7 version but it tastes like it could take the paint off of a car.\n\nWe ordered some nachos.  Sparse toppings and not even in the same league as anything you could get at just about any taqueria in the Mission.  Dry.  Tasteless.  Awful.

The pinto beans had lots of cumin.  Rice was flavorful, not greasy.  The vegetarian burrito was generous, with a good amount of spice.  The staff went out of their way to seat us without a reservation.\n\nLoud enough to be kid friendly if you go to the restaurant early.", "author": "Mel D."}

I ordered the chicken enchiladas and my friends had the shrimp enchiladas and the steak tacos. The margartas were strong and a good value (we each probably got 2.5 glasses, so 7.5 glasses for $28 bucks). We had ordered the mango flavored margarita, but I detected no fruit flavor--oh well, I can't drink too much sweet stuff anyway. The food was merely okay--not bad, but, like, we're in the mission eating Mexican food--if it was really bad, this place would have been shut down a long time ago.

Their chicken mole is actually darn tasty, if you like that chocolate plus chicken combo.  And if you're looking for a strong margarita, this is your place.  \n\nHowever, I have one gripe about Velvet Cantina (a gripe large enough for me to feel compelled to create a yelp account and make my gripe public!).  When I called to make resies for my large party, I was told that I could only have the table for 2 hours since it was a Saturday night.  Check, understood.  Well turns out our food took forever to come out since the kitchen was busy cooking for the wedding reception in the other room.  Our waiter was cool and apologetic -- no problemo we said, we were in no rush.  But then once the food came out, another waitress totally hurried us along, grabbing our plates before we even had a chance to put our forks down, throwing to-go boxes on our table along with the check...without even asking if we wanted dessert!  NOT cool, especially since it was their fault we were lagging.", "author": "Lilo F."}

If you hate waiting forever at Puerto Allegre or can't quite enjoy the food at La Rondalla, this is that nice in between place that serves decent food, reasonable prices (not taqueria prices, but restaurant prices), and a full bar! \n\nAll the appetizers and salads were $5-6 (I think) and the entrees were at max $14... but I think most were closer to $10 or $11. \n\nI liked the free chips -- they appear to be homemade chips -- thick and substantial. Ahem. And my friend and I split a Citrus Salad which was good - not AMAZING, but tasty. We also got Cornbread Sopes, now those were yummy and I haven't seen those anywhere else. We also split the Chicken Avo enchiladas -- a seemingly popular item for the Yelp set. I thought they were pretty decent too -- the rice was really flavorful. \n\nThey make different fruity margaritas, and boy do they have a heavy pour. They also sell by the pitcher -- definitely a plus in my eyes. \n\nI agree with whomever said that this is a good, chill birthday party spot for a big group.

We've each been in SF over 12 years so many many nights over the early years at puerto allegra, la rondalla...tastes, incomes and budgets have afforded us upward into other levels of dining hence but that being said, Velvet Cantina brings back the fun WITH QUALITY and awesome prices.  BRING IT ON!!  \n\nUpon entering the bar teeming with a great diverse crowd, we ordered house margaritas while waiting for our reservation.  This set the mood perfectly.  it was a balanced drink, not too sweet, perfect strength.  For starters, we got the Cornbread Sopes, very good, I thought it was pork but the menu does state it's chicken...either I even ate the garnish, every last bite.  Three entrees we get total thumbs up are the Achiote Steak Tacos, Chicken Avocado Enchiladas and the Tri Tip. All perfected prepared, well portioned, even for guys and really tasty. We were torn on the Lasagna.  The description sounds awesome but my friend who ordered it thought it was too runny.  The flavors are there, distinct and tasty but the texture and consistency didn't work for her.  I liked it but it didn't work for her.  This is a place where I could have literally been content with margaritas, chips, salsa and guac. (a must) but very glad to have discovered a place with awesome food.  I will be back many many times for sure.  Oh, the service is good and staff is consistent, friendly.\n\nTravis and Pete are magicians with concoctions...inviting styles and Pete is an A's fan too- NICE!   The house margaritas (rocks no salt for me) ROCK ROCK ROCK and again the chicken avocado enchiladas were consistently fantastic.  However, last night's chili verde was not a favorite.  The broth is well spiced with excellent flavor, but a little too watery and the downer was that the pork was overcooked and tough... I will continue to eat here though because, overall, it's the most fun thing in SF right now.\n\nOK (after many visits later), I am officially a regular now...Gabe is da bomb and has an awesome crew, Justin, Darrius, Jamie, John ;-)  ...all will treat you right.

The drinks were hit or miss, I had the Cilantro gimlet which was an interesting concoction. It was pretty tasty, but one you take slowly since it had a veggie taste to it and was only slightly sweet. It was a hit with the table. However, my friend's margerita tasted like they used lime juice from the plastic \"lime\"...a miss in my opinion. My other friend and my 8 year old girl got virgin margeritas with seasonal fruit, which was fresh watermelon, and all I can say is HOLY CRAP, YUM! It was an amazing drink! Sweet and fresh..I almost stole it from my daughter, but that would be wrong :)\nThe food was so good, fresh ingredients and interesting combinations. Wonderful beans, which I didn't know were veggie until reading the other reviews. Great spanish rice. Super steak tacos.\nOnly lame part was that it took forever to get our entrees, forever.\nPrices were not too shabby.\nI will definitely be going back frequently.

Service was quick, good chips and salsa, Tecate for two bucks (they give you lime if you for \"limon\", so just say \"lemon\"). We started with Guacamole ($5.99), which was pretty good but small portion wise. The cornbread sopes ($6.49) were great - if you can, make sure every one in your party gets a whole one (there's two per order). Chiles Rellenos ($9.99), Chile Verde ($10.99) and Chicken and Avocado Enchiladas ($10.99) all come with your choice of beans. My cohorts were pleased with their selections. I liked my enchiladas well enough, but I miss the old days when the tortillas were dipped in hot lard just long enough to soften them up. I asked for no rice, so they my doubled my refried beans, a bit of overload.

Well, unfortunately a bar, nothing less and definitely nothing more.  Go only to have a Margarita.  \n\nAppetizers, ah yes, (or would that be Aaaarggghhh!!)...Chips and salsa - canned stewed tomatoes. Guacamole - flavorless mush.  Chili con queso - less flavor than Velveeta and stewed tomatoes diluted to avoid any hint of flavor and/or staying on the greasy chips, then slightly heated.   I have never had to go into a Mexican restaurant and ask for bottled sauce to add flavor to salsa, guacamole and chile con queso, but here it is absolutely necessary.  But then again, the appetizers were the highlight of the meal.\n\nSlow, sloppy, inattentive service.  Entre orders wrong.  Four entr\u00e9es, but delivered over a 5-10 minute span while the waiter did what? Who knows?  Perhaps out of sympathy for other diners, pushed more Margaritas.  \n\nOne of our party thought that their burrito was great. It was big.  \n\nShrimp Diablo was a few shrimp swamped in thick stew of tomatoes, onion and peppers. The requested tortillas were slung, by someone flashing by the table, 20 minutes after the last entre arrived.  \n\nThe Chicken in Mole, tepidly warm lower legs drowned in a sauce of Hersey's syrup, Schilling's chili powder and enough sugar to make a week's supply of cotton candy at a good sized carnival. Hardly touched, (and that's a good thing!).Asked for beans no rice. Waiter kindly offered to replace the rice with a salad - great.  What did we get?  Lots of rice, no beans, and under the few chopped lettuce leaves, what, more rice!  \n\nNaked Chile Relleno, well hardly exposed to peering eyes, perhaps there was a chile under the nopales/papas but hard to tell.

I've organized countless birthday parties here and have left thoroughly drunk, happy and full everytime. the margaritas are strong but have excellent flavor, not the sugary cheap gross mix like chevys. the seasonal ones are awesome, i've had mango and watermelon. The food is also delicious, especially the tortilla soup. i've had the entrees and am still the most satisfied with the soup-it's huge, but the avocado pesto chicken enchiladas are good too.  the chips and salsa are great and the waiter refills them as often as you want. the prices aren't the best but i'd call them reasonable.  the waiters are super friendly and even turned down the lights when we went to surprise our friend with a birthday cake!", "author": "melsa m."}

The food and service were great! I changed the number of people a few times and they were very accommodating. They gave us most of our own room and never rushed us or made us feel like we had to move along the party, even though we were there for about 5 hours. I would highly recommend having dinner here or a party. The waiter was very nice and gave out party of 30 lots of service even though he had other tables to attend to.", "author": "elisa s."}

The chips and salsa for your table are great - really flaky and salty.  I had a cantelope margarita with sugar around the rim (a little watery, but still good) and a chicken avacado enchilada for dinner.  You can choose between pinto, refried, or black beans, which makes the serving sizes nice and big.  The enchiladas were juicy and a little spicy, yum!  I was eating dinner with friends, and we had a lot to catch up on, but we were yelling over the noise once the place got packed.  Apparently that is typical for a Friday night at this place.  After we had paid the bill they asked if we would move to the bar to give up our table.  Service was good, and I would come back again, but maybe for something a little rowdier like a birthday or bachelorette party.", "author": "Laura W."}

I got the cactus avocado enchiladas. They were delicious but I found the rice and beans way too salty (I'm not sure if the culprit was the rice or the beans as I mixed them all up together before I starting eating--I suspect the rice).

With such a friendly bar staff, I don't feel like the blame falls entirely on me.  The food looks tasty but I've never partaken as I am more likely to crawl out of the bar and go with a foil wrapped burrito from a taqueria as opposed to the sit down plate.  It might have been a 5 star review but the bar ran out of guiness after my friend and I took repeated car bombs, so we were forced to substitute negro modelo and while we were deviating decided to swap the shot of baileys and jameson with a shot of tequilla and kahlua.  We called this drink a mexican knife stabbing and it was not as good as it sounds.  still, you can't go wrong with their margaritas.", "author": "Mike T."}

They are always jam-packed, and they never fail to deliver great food (heart the chicken avocado enchiladas), strong yummy margaritas, and outstanding service. The last time I went there was a perfect example. We had 6 people, and admittedly we got a bit carried away with our margaritas and stayed for some time after paying the bill. We had probably been there a full 2 hours on a Friday night, and of course they needed the table. Instead of asking us to leave, the waiter explained that they had another party they needed to seat, BUT as a consolation they sent us over to the bar where all 6 of us were presented with double shots of Patron, on the house. Clearly, they knew the way to our hearts. I already loved Velvet Cantina before that experience, but it placed them solidly on my list of absolute favorite restaurants in the city.

We started with margaritas which were well-made, tasty and strong.  They offered us a sample of the raspberry marg which was also pretty good - but I like my margs simple.  The bartender was very attentive and friendly.  When our whole party arrived they'd already prepared a table for us on the restaurant side so we moved over there, where our waitress was also friendly and attentive - I think it helped that the place was not full,  towards the end of a Wednesday night.  Our party split a plate of nachos and a quesadilla - the nachos were outstanding and everyone in our group loved them.  We all ordered entrees but after another pitcher of margs and all those appetizers, we had a hard time finishing the generous portions, even though they were all very tasty.  Our leftovers were promptly wrapped up to go, and though we were full, we figured a group could still demolish a dessert, so we had the smores nachos (I saw no listing of the peanut butter nachos other reviews have mentioned, but it was dark and I was drunk...). They were brought to our table in flames and were also delicious.   Total for a table of 5, including two Patron margs, a raspberry marg, a pitcher of house margs, two appetizers, five entrees, and dessert, was about $30pp not including tip.  I wouldn't call it cheap but it was definitely reasonable.  Food, drinks, and service were all very good.  My boyfriend tasted my leftovers and cursed himself for not having come along.  We'll be back!  Note: I don't know if they're actually open until 2am every night - it appeared we closed the place down, as they were shutting down after we left around 10pm.", "author": "Eclipse T."}

We also ordered the ceviche which was actually pretty good. It all went down hill from there. I ordered the steak taco's, YUCK!!! I took one bite of my taco and lost my appetite. I didn't touch my plate after that so it was obvious something was wrong. About 5 waiters walked by me and saw the obvious (apparently not). As our waiter picked up my plate and did not ask or say how the food was, I quickly asked him if the meat always had no taste. The sad part he said YES, I was surprised he answered the truth. I am not one to ask for a refund or ask for another plate, its part of trying new places.

It's definitely small, so don't expect to meet 15 of your friends here for drinks. But the feel of the place is great - the music is loud but not too loud, it's dark but not too dark, and the crowd all seems cool and friendly. The food smelled amazing and I definitely want to come back here some night for dinner. The flaming smore nachos looked fun too - this place would be perfect for doing someone's birthday dinner. I think it's pretty easy to get a reservation and there was a group of maybe 7 people there celebrating something - I definitely have to keep that in mind next time we're trying to come up with somewhere fun to go for something. Anyway, it took a while to get a drink, but once we did it paid off. The margs were fantastic! Order 4 and you get a pitcher that serves about 6. Strong, tart and really refreshing since we have actually had some warm days. Highly recommended for drinks!!! Would be a fun spot to kick off a girls' night out in the Mission.

I dunno - I was the one who recommended the restaurant, but I found my second experience was not nearly as good as the first time - I guess their margaritas are THAT good that I forgot about the food? I found the appetizers were much better than the entree. Which, being that we had nachos and the quesadilla - which are practically bulletproof/can't really mess them up/everyone loves 'em- style dishes, says a lot about the mediocrity of the entrees. I had the Naked Relleno which was pretty unremarkable other than remarking that I ate it. My friend had the Chicken Mole which was swimming in sauce - didn't look too appetizing, but she seemed to enjoy it. Margaritas were great though - fresh, authentic and tasty; no BS sour mix. Service was OK - I was disappointed that even with having a reservation, they put 4 average-to-tall adults at a TINY booth table (more suitable for 2 people having drinks) which was very cramped with hardly room on the table to fit our drinks and dishes of food. But we had no choice in the matter, as the place was very full, even for a Wed. night. All in all, a so-so meal. I could see myself trying a 3rd time; maybe with a different entree choice it would be better. A note for first-timers: there are 2 different dining areas with two separate entrances (one on the corner, one by the bar). They connect at the back of the bar, but just something to be aware of in case you wander in by the bar and don't see your peeps or vice versa.", "author": "Barbara K."}
