What I noticed right away: is the consistency Bubba Gump's has with their other locations elsewhere.  Example:  I went to Bubba Gump's in Hawaii a few times and this particular place is has almost the identical look and feel.  I also went to another Gumps place somewhere in Cali, and I'm sure it looked and felt the same.  Like on the top of a two-story place, over looking the ocean or some kind of water, with a inside/outdoor seating capacity.  There is also a operate gift shop with Forrest Gump playing continuously on some of their TV's.  The interior design along with their drinks and foods are pretty much all the same.\n\nWe had a big party (about 20+ people for a wedding), and they were well prepared for our arrival.  (Yes, the Bride and Groom organized a dinner event here way in advanced).  The wait staff was up spirited and great, our foods campout pretty fast and so did our drink orders.  \n\nI had the cheeseburger, and though it was good, had a little too much bun for me, but I just ate it with the top bun off, no big deal.  Other than that, drinks were good and food was tasty as well.  I expected how things will taste on what ever I ordered and tried, thus there was no glaring surprises nor too great of expectations.", "author": "Troy T."}

At our table we're 2 Highway Patrol Officers and 1 Director of Transportation and all 3 of us were totally \"SHOCKED\" at the number of employees who were under the influence. Our server Dave was very nice but very scatter brained and appeared to be trying very hard but, unable to stay focused. While at least HALF of the employees appeared to be HIGH on meth, cocaine and marijuana. We swore we were on a hidden camera show because it was so obvious. Staff were dropping dishes, cups and even food and leaving much of the debris on the floor. The other employees would come through and walk through it,kick it and even slip in it. \nWe asked our server Dave for some straws and he he brought back 5 unwrapped straws with his bare hands...so unsanitary...who does this? In fact when he brought them to us he said, \"we're not to do this\" thinking what caring unprotected straw with you bare hands?\" No, give straws unless asked for? Wait a minute...we did ask for them??? \nMy son was seated at the end of the table and several servers were constantly bumping into the back of his chair. Not one person stopped to offer an apology...good thing he wasn't drinking hot coffee! It became more obvious, frustrating and extremely sad having to sit there and observed this conduct. Their physical functioning  was consistent with being high while some were experiencing facial disorders consistent with tweaking. A few others had glossy dilated eyes.  The bussing staff were just as bad.\nWe eat at this restaurant 2-3 times a year with visiting family but, the last few experiences were dreadful!... yesterday was simply out of control.\nI cannot imagine that management didn't notice any of this going on? \nFor health and safety concerns for ourselves and our children we had to leave! \nOn our way out my son expressed to a female manager (long brown hair) our reasoning for why it is we need to leave...he expressed staff were constantly bumping his chair...the final straw (no pun) was when Dave delivered our unprotected straws with his bare hands to the table top (yuck)!!!\n\nDisappointed Landry card holder!\nR.

After waiting to for what seemed like an hour to have our order taken, we left. First, and most importantly, we observed several staff members acting as if they were under the influence of drugs. Not only marijuana, but more like meth. You may want to drug test your employees at this location stat!!!  We observed several staff members excessively dropping things, spilling on people, and unable to physically function. It was very obvious to us that more than a few of the employees there were high while working. I thought we were being punked and Aston Kutcher was going to come out any minute and tell us it was a joke. Unfortunately, it wasn't. \n\nAlso, when we asked for straws, our waiter handed them to us with his bare hands, touching all of our straws before setting them down on a dirty table. After taking our drink order, he advised he would be right back to take our order, he then disappeared for thirty minutes. The unfortunate part of this is that it provided my party a lot of time to notice how the employees were acting and all the stuff they were doing. \n\nYou had servers dropping things because they were so high, servers running into the back of chairs, your busser was unable to keep anything on his tray, and servers dropping sodas only to leave them spilled on on the floor for the next server to walk by and kick it into a seated party. Also, no one came by to clean anything up. After placing our order an hour after being seated, being bumped, spilled on by servers, we left. Your manager canceled our order, apologized, and seemed embarrassed but we won't be back again. This is unfortunate since it had been a staple in our family every time  we visit Pier 39. Thanks for breaking that tradition! We will spend our money elsewhere.", "author": "Angela H."}

This location has the best views, I think that's why it's one of the tourist favorites at pier 39. We got on yelp waitlist for a late lunch but still had to wait about 20 minutes when we got here. Good thing was we just walked around pier 39 and this pier was just too much fun to hang around! \n\nWe were able to get a window table with the views of ocean and Alcatraz island. Funny thing was parents had actually dined here many years ago at the same table! I had a San Pellegrino sparkling water, no alcohol cause I was already dehydrated. For food we had our favorites like shrimper's net catch half and half, Jenny's catch and shrimp scampi. Food was delicious but I don't think it was as good as LA locations, since I eat at Bubba Gump a lot so I could taste that little bit of difference instantly! \n\nOur waitress was very friendly but she really just looked at the \"run forest run\" sign to see if we needed service at the moment. At LA locations, servers always stop by often no matter which side of the sign is on! \n\nIt was still a very pleasant family lunch, we enjoyed the views and food nonetheless!", "author": "Mimi L."}

Our server was good and we didn't have to wait too long.  I know this is a chain but I figure I ate here, might as well write a review.  The good thing is, the food was tasty and actually better than what I remember.  Here is what we had:\n\nPear and berry salad: Fresh Greens with Charbroiled Chicken, Strawberries, Pears, \nand Glazed Pecans. Tossed with a raspberry vinegarette and feta cheese -  If you are just coming for a light lunch, do not get this.  It is so big, it fed 4 of us.  It was so yummy, the fruits in the salad had the perfect tartness and sweetness to them.  We had ours with chicken which was nice and tender.\n\nNet Catch Entree: Beer steamed Shrimp, along with Carrots, Celery, Corn, Potatoes and Andouille Sausage all steamed and \ntossed with Garlic Spice - this was yummy as long as you put a little lemon on it.  The shrimp was so tender, the skin just fell right off and it melted in your mouth.\n\nGrilled Seafood Trio: Shrimp & Veggie Skewer, Shrimp New Orleans and Bourbon Street \nMahi Mahi on a blanket of rice - i love the grilled taste with the skewers and the sauce for the mahi mahi was absolutely delish.\n\nForrest's Seafood Feast: Mama Blue's Fried Shrimp, hand battered Fish & Chips and made from scratch Seafood Hush Pups. Served with Fries and our dippin' Sauces, Tartar, \nCocktail and Remoulade - fried heaven, if I could just eat a surmountable amount of fried stuff, this would be gone.  Big thumbs up for the taste of the the hush puppies and sauces.  Shrimp, perfect...fried fish - almost perfect.

It was really busy but I think people come hear because they think it's cheaper than the restaurants near by. \n\nLocation is great and has great views unfortunately the place itself was really dirty. Bathroom was overall awful and I noticed that the floor looked like it hadn't been swept in a while . I also noticed that the manager and the waiter just kept walking over food and trash that was on the floor as if it was meant to be their . By this point I was already worried about how the quality of the food will be. \n\nFood wise it was very disappointing calamari was overpriced for the portion and batter was not fully cooked. Chicken cesare salad was lacking flavor in the chicken and the food just did not meet the price standards. I just want to say that I have gone to other locations and have got the same thing and I enjoyed the food and the taste and considering it is very busy hear you can still maintain a clean restaurant but the manager seemed to busy walking around instead. Overall bubba Gump is a great place to dine if you have the right management and staff to keep the place maintained. I suggest bring staff from other restaurants to get this one up to standards like the rest and making cleanliness and customers a priority overall they have a great location it's just lacking in many ways .", "author": "Mirna P."}

They have such prime location and I honestly think if it weren't such a popular chain people would seriously boycott. The staff is AWFUL and beyond unprofessional. \n\nMy horrid experience started at the door and really I should have just walked out at that point because it only got worse. The hostess was super unprofessional with the group in front of me who didn't speak English, but you could totally understand what they were saying. She told them it was a 45 minute wait and rolled her eyes when they decided not to wait (good choice on their part!!). My turn came up and I told her I was just a party of 1 and she LAUGHED and said \" oh just 1\". Yes, I sometimes really enjoy traveling alone. I can't seriously be the first person that has ever come alone to Bubba's. Whatever, shrugged it off and went to the bar. \n\nThe first gal that greeted me was friendly and informed me it was HH. I knew what I wanted right away and despite there being 4 people behind the bar, the next guy didn't take my order for about 15 minutes. The drink arrived quickly and was good (Lava flows from here are super yum!). \n\nDuring my time waiting for them to acknowledge me so I could pay (45 minutes!!! Granted I intentionally just sat here waiting for them to make eye contact with an empty glass) I had the opportunity to be horrified by the conversations they openly have with one another. I also witnessed a waitress yell at a child for running ( I agree they shouldn't run but let the parents scold!). \n\nThe staff is so incredibly unprofessional for a touristy and family oriented place. Not to mention NOT ONCE did they ask if I was doing ok, despite having my drink empty for over 30 minutes.

My son and his wife really wanted to eat here while in SF. While we were at the Golden gate I called them to see if they would take a reservation, she said no, they were too swamped and the wait time was about 2 hours. She would not put us on a list. \n\nWe figured we would go to the pier, get our name on the list and mess around there for few hours waiting. It was a beautiful saturday in February so it was beyond packed down there. Luckily, when I hung up from her, I focused on my Yelp app and saw a button that said put your name on the waiting list. I was HIGHLY SKEPTICAL. I had to cap that so you understand the serious level of my skeptical-ness  of really being able to do that. It was even giving me a countdown to where I was in line. I was 72nd in line. I was expected to get a table at 2:14. \n\nWe mosey across town, well, really we got stuck in massive traffic, but none of us took this list thing serious, even though I was moving up in line. We get down there, park and start to take it more seriously just in case they are being honest with this list thing.  \n\nI fight the crowd, as my yelp app says expires in 5 mins, get to the door of Bubba's they are jammed. I get up there literally at 2:14 show her my phone thinking she is going to laugh me out of there, sees my phone, looks down and says, yeah here you are, it will 15 mins or so. It was literally 3 mins. Yelp you rock for this alone! Six people with low blood sugar didn't make the front page news on this day. \n\nGot in there, not expecting much, got a great seat by the window and the grandbabies could see the sea lions on the dock. Waiter was great and on top of us with refills and Bubba trivia. We all got the pot meals and again, didn't expect much, but holy kittens of fire, they were really good. Full of shrimp, sausage, corn on the cob and red potatoes. The grandbabies got little meals served in paper boats they loved. \n\nI was really impressed. I then went back and read reviews and noticed alot of \"touristy, dude drinking spot,\" reviews. I mean nothing on the food as much, so really, a bad review because it is in a massive tourist spot and you ate there? I don't know what to even say about that, if you are going to complain about that aspect of Bubba's, SF has some great eateries not even near that tourist trap wharf we all know and love uber yourself right on over to one of those.

My opinion:  they were trying to discourage patrons from dining there because there were a lot of people in line.  \n\nAs for the food, and dining experience, I love Forrest Gump so that says it all, but again, this is only about the wait time issue that I believe if enough of us Yelpers review this subject, management may take note that reality is the best policy.", "author": "Yvette S."}

With a straight face she just taught us how to use the license plate on the table to signal them to stop and take our orders or if we have any questions. When we told her that we still needed a couple minutes she rolled her eyes and left.  She came back a minute later. We did not switch the license plate yet and asked us if we were ready. So what was the whole point of teaching us how to use it if she was just going to come back?  We felt rushed, so we ordered our food.   My niece ordered a shrimp poor boy sandwich with no pickles. Notice, how she said no pickles. \n\nSecond, the food. We ordered the Popcorn Shrimp for the appetizer. I felt that it was not worth the $10 price tag. The taste was just about average. Nothing really special about it. I ordered a Grilled Texas Chicken Sandwich. It had a lot of flavor. But, there other ingredients over powered the taste of the chicken that I couldn't even tell that there was chicken in it at all. Texture wise I was eating chicken. But I could not taste it.

So I was super excited when wandering around the pier& decided to eat here again after so many years. \n\nFirst off, I used yelp to get on the waitlist, and by doing so I was suppose to \"cut the line.\" We arrived to check in at the specified time but the hostess told us to wait 20 more mins. So we did, then came back to be told to wait another 7 mins. What was the point of all that? It wasn't even busy.\n\nThen we finally get sat& it takes a while for our waiter to approach us. We order everything at once, drinks, appetizer & entrees. We receive the appetizer & drinks before we get the waters.\n\nSo we receive the food actually pretty quick BUT both of our shrimp tasted like it was just taken out of the freezer. The food wasn't even hot, it was probably cold to room temp. The best part of our meals turned out to be the corn& fries. I am so disappointed!!", "author": "Ashley J."}

I'll give this place 2 stars because I love the movie Forrest Gump so the theme of the restaurant was probably the only part of this whole experience that was decent. We started out by walking in and asking for a menu. Right off the bat the shrimp macaroni caught my eye as the picture looked delicious and \"full\" of Mac&shrimp. We were seated in about 10 mins and our waiter was nice. The place was packed as it was a Friday night. There was four people in my party including me, three of us ordered the Mac and shrimp, and one friend ordered a burger. The meals were a bit pricey so we expected the best. Our food took over 45 minutes to come, and when it did we were extremely disappointed. The portions were so small compared to the picture on the menu, the cheese was almost \"watery\" and the shrimp tasted rubbery and bland.actually the whole plate was bland. My friend who ordered a burger was pleased, but probably because we waited so long for our food. As we were waiting for our food we overheard an older couple seated to the left of us complain about the food being bad to a waitress! Definitely won't be coming back here.", "author": "Dalilah K."}

When we checked in with the hostess they said it would be a half hour wait, when it was well over an hour. The host was visibly so high and intoxicated she slurred her speech and couldn't keep her eyes open. Who's managing this place, is that your standard? The bathrooms were really dirty, but much better than any truck stop in Timbuktu. I ordered the peel and eat shrimp, it was very misleading as normally you would have full size shrimp with the heads on, but it consisted of mini cocktail shrimp, what a rip off, I have never seen Cajun shrimp that way, normally they would at least be medium sized with the heads on. Our server was ok, she clearly had more tables than she could handle however which is not her fault that is management trying to save on labor.

(If you have been to a red lobster or clam jumper it's around that price range and taste). This place is all about the nostalgia of the movie it's based off of (Forest Gump). There is a long wait time but you can call or reserve ahead on yelp which is a plus. The service does take awhile in the evenings due to high volume. I saw about 6 people who were serving tables and another person was working the bar. The restaurant fills up and has many large groups. Food took about 45 minutes to receive. If you order salad or an appetizer you should receive it in 15-20 minutes. Drinks took about 15 minutes after seating as well. The waiters looked a little stressed out and busy. Even though there are many waiters the restaurant itself is quite large and seating extend pretty far away from the bar and kitchen so they end up running around a lot. It is one of those restaurants where you may have to flag down a random server to help you refill a drink or add on any food or dessert since your server could end up having to help 5 other tables all at once. Great place to go if you love the movie. There is also a location in Southern California as well which is on a pier which you can play games on and shop around at during the day.", "author": "Aly R."}

Don't get me wrong, I love French fries and fried shrimp just as much as the next guy, but I still want to be wow'd by what I came for - the shrimp. Unfortunately, Bubba Gump's did not do that for me. \n\nWe ordered the Shrimper's Heaven (coconut shrimp, grilled shrimp, crispy golden shrimp, and tempura shrimp) and the Grilled Seafood Trio. I found the shrimp to be overly chewy and it seemed like the huge amounts of batter was supposed to distract customers from the subpar quality of the meal. \n\nThe overall experience was fine. The ambiance and view are probably the best thing about this place. We came just before noon on a Saturday and surprisingly only waited 10 minutes.

The best tip I could give is when you are at Pier 39 go straight to the restaurant and put yourself on the waiting list; or if you are reading this review on your phone, you can do it on the Yelp app. \n\nI think I've had everything in their menu, the fried calamari is a great starter, and Jenny's catch is absolutely delicious!

In this situation, the service started off okay, but once we had our meals, the waitress named Laura P. just became completely inattentive to us, for no reason at all. We were never once rude or anything. She just randomly stopped coming to our table. She was extremely attentive to her other two tables, I'm not sure if it's because they ordered alcohol and we didn't, or what (since I'm pregnant my husband has been practicing sobriety in solidarity with me, out of respect). \n\nShe passed our table 7 times (we counted) while we were with empty plates and empty drinks. Never once asked how we were doing or if we wanted refills. She made eye contact with us several times and we tried to flag her down, but she would very blatantly ignore us and tend to her other tables. She must've touched the other tables at least 12 times, while ours was only touched 3 times. She eventually came to take our empty plates without asking us which plates we were done with (she just took the plates we were still eating off of without even pausing to give us a chance to stop her) and, once again, didn't ask if we wanted refills or the check, nothing. \n\nMy husband is also a server and he was very upset with the service. He flagged down the manager and was very respectful, letting her know maybe the waitress was in need of a coaching session but made it clear he is also a server and had no intention of getting the girl in trouble. The manager apologized and told us she'd make sure our drinks were refilled. \n\nCome 20 minutes...no waitress, no refills. We finally flagged down the waitress for the check (this took three tries, each time we made eye contact with her and she still ignored us). The manager finally came back to touch bases, and we complained we never received our drinks. Turns out the manager had told her to bring us drinks, but the waitress never actually brought them.\n\nWe then witnessed the manager chewing out the server at the register, and the waitress proceeded to argue back, as if she was thoroughly convinced she'd done nothing wrong. Our check was brought back and the manager apologized and asked if we wanted a free dessert, but we declined as we had to leave. We still, after all that, never got our drinks. \n\nI hope that it was just a bad server and not the fault of the establishment, as I enjoyed the food and was super nostalgic about the Forrest Gump theme. But the service was literally the worst and most bizarre thing I've ever seen. Started off okay and took a nosedive out of nowhere. Disappointing.", "author": "Ashley S."}

I've always wanted to try Bubba Gump since watching Forrest Gump all those years ago but just never really crossed my mind to dine here, but we did and I will be back! Our server Mike did a fantastic job of running through their huge menu with us so we understood how it worked and also pointed out to us some favorites.\n\nWe ended up ordering:\n*Gumbo - this was fantastic. We had their 'bowl' and it was a fairly decent portion which also came with rice. Flavors were on point, would order this again!\n\n*Pear and Berry Salad - the dressing they had on this was solid with the flavors. The greens on this however seemed like they were from an old lettuce head since there were spots of redness on it\n\n*Create Your Own - we had the fish with rice and chimichurri, and with their shrimp scampi. This dish was great, all the spices made it awesome\n\n*Bucket of Boat Trash - this was their 'fun' menu choice. It had fried fish, shrimp, crab legs, and a bucket of fries. Honestly I don't think this was that worth it. The legs were good but the portion is mainly fries which were just meh\n\n*Frozen Coronaritas - this is the drink which they pour a mini Corona on top so it looks super fancy and fun. It tastes like what it is. A margarita mixed with Corona. Was pretty decent!\n\nOverall it was a fun experience and the food and alcohol was pretty good. There is a great vibe inside and the ambiance is splendid. For four of us it came out to be around $130 after tax and tip. We would come back!", "author": "Benjamin W."}

Drinks were like $15 each!  We tried to order 4 different drinks and were told that they were out of each one before we selected some that were available. \nThe vastly overpriced bill came and I saw that there was a \"fee\" included at the bottom.  It was like $6 or something somewhat menial, so I asked the waitress what this nonsense was and she said, \"It's a city tax.\"   I know that it is not a city tax and I told her this, so she said, \"yeah, I don't really know, our manager tells us to tell people it's a city tax if they ever ask.\"   If she hadn't been a good waitress I would have taken this fee out of her tip, but that's lame so I didn't do that. \nI went to the hostess stand and asked them the same question, I asked them if I could see a manager and one of the hosts went to fetch the leader of this establishment.  She came back a short time later and said, \"The manager's on a break, but he said to tell you it's a cost of doing business in San Francisco fee.\"  Utter nonsense obviously, but enough to verify that I needn't return to this place.", "author": "H K."}

Bubba Gump is themed on Forrest Gump, and the movie was playing on some of the TVs, along with \"Run Forrest Run,\" and \"Stop Forrest Stop\" license plates on each table. We didn't know what they meant, so we flipped it to \"Stop Forrest Stop\", and a server came by and was like \"Stop Forrest Stop! What do you need?\" And we were like whoops, don't need anything, just didn't know what it meant XD Now we [you] know (cue Bill Nye hehe). \n\n- Shrimper's Net Catch: an appetizer of - you guessed it - shrimp. The shrimp had shells on them, which made it a bit more difficult to eat. It was heavily seasoned. We got a mix of half Garlic and half Cajun seasoning, and it was pretty funny because one of my friends is not very tolerant to spice, but it seemed like each shrimp she ate was the Cajun one haha.\n- Forrest's Seafood Feast: came with a variety of fried goodness. \n    - Hush Pups: these were quite interesting! A fried oval with some corn and seafood goodies inside. These were probably the most unique/tasty thing of the night.\n    - Fish was pretty decent. Fries were decent as well.\n    - Fried shrimp: standard, not much to say.\n\nThe service was kind of funky, but I think it was just our server and the vibe I got. Not sure if he was new or something, but the most prominent example is when we were still in the middle of finishing two plates, and he came by to ask if we wanted the cheque, and we hadn't flagged him (or put the Stop Forrest Stop sign lol). The restaurant wasn't crowded at that time or closing soon either. Like in the middle of my bite I was like um nope not done yet (in my head I'm like look at our giant platter of food that still has more than a third left on it lol). \n\nAnyways, besides that, just speaking about the food alone, the seafood and platters weren't quite worth the price.

We had the shrimp mac and cheese which was decent. I got the fish and chips because it's always a good portion!

I was unaware because I was in my own zone still steam mad about my 3  and I was writing my original review. \n\nSo after my daughters packed up their to go boxes and I didn't see my husband we proceeded to go to the front. I assumed he went to the front to pay.  As we were walking to the front the Manger Mr. Le (kinda look like Squidworth from Spongebob) abruptly blocked my line of travel and asked if he can help me with my bill? I'm thinking he is taking about because I was upset about the 3 Shrimp that I received with my meal. Oh no Honeee he was talking about payment.. now I'm all confused. \n\nHe had me and my daughters blocked from leaving our area and he was on his walkie talkie informing someone he had \" A WALK OUT\"........\n\nHusband come back pay for the food with cash. I inform him of what transpired after he left. Trent was standing there with the manger. They both were aware that his card did not work and he went to the atm to get cash. The manger could have dealt with the situation differently. I was not aware of the situation he could have asked me I would like for you to stay seated until the payment is made. I could understand if my husband did not have a conversation with the server regarding the situation and then the server Trent also directed him to the atm, with his family waiting for him.  So it's a matter of principal I don't want to hear about your damn policy. Use your mouth and have a conversation before you assume that people are trying to run about with about paying. At least I would have enough sense to do something like that with my kids with me and don't you think I would eat at a 5 star restaurant and not go for a BUCKET OF TRASH??", "author": "Keisha J."}

She had the clam chowder, a side, and two glasses of white wine. I partook in a glass of Merlot. For the main course I believe I had the tilapa with mixed vegetables which included spinach, broccoli, carrots, cucumbers, etc.* and mashed potatoes which was cooked to perfection. The service was prompt as well with our servers being attentive and polite. I found their \"Run Forrest Run\" call signs to signal the help quite amusing as it was effective. For this fine dining experience, I award 5 stars. It was definitely worth the twenty minute wait to be seated. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the area for the cuisine, the wine, and the amusing atmosphere of the company's staff. \n\nI do subtract one star for the noise level from the other customers. There could be better ambiance levels in the building by way of infrastructure to create a more private setting. Doing that would create a more upscale quiet environment. Should they do that, the next time I visit I'll give them the full compliment of 5 stars with zero subtractions.", "author": "Richard R."}

Whenever you are ordering food it will come to you in about 30 minutes so you better order everything at once. The reason why the food preparation take so long is because they are very busy like a mention it before the parking spot is very hard to find. If you want to find a parking spot you'll have to park at the very end of the Pier 39.

Once on the list, they shoot you a text and you have 10 mins to get there. \nOnce seated, you immediately see the beautiful ocean views and feel as if you're actually in the Bubba Gump movie. Little things such as signs saying \"run forest, run\" or \"stop forest, stop\" to get your waiter or waitresses attention are pretty cool. \nThere is a selection of food options, the sampler and the fresh pot of shrimp catch are a must. \nSometimes even the manager checks in to make sure everything is great. There are alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks as well that come with souvenir cups, they also validate an hour of parking for you. Highly recommend if you're in the area.\nThe reason I give it 4/5 is because the location is so busy that they don't really care for each individual customer individually. So they pass by and put things down quick and move on to the next customer.", "author": "Damien C."}

As this restaurant was inspired by the popular 1994 film Forrest Gump, it portrays bits from the movie as illustrated by the sitting bench outside, d\u00e9cor and food; all designed to remind you of that once beloved movie and character. \n\nMovie trivia from the waiters are especially fun! Although I 've seen the movie countless times, I usually get stumped by a couple questions. \"Me and Jenny goes together like peas and carrots.\"\n\nWhen at Bubba Gump, Forrest (waiters) would recommend the bubba shrimp or a daily special. Cajun shrimp and calamari are always tasty. I usually get the Seafood Feast and fish & Chips. To add, I usually go with a clam chowder also. By no means is it embarrassing to be hunched back, belly up, because one ate an excessive amount of fried foods and became bloated from so much beer. Don't even talk about exercise now! lol \n\nTheir specials are also considerable items. To name, Coconut Shrimp and bucket of Boat Trash is also worth trying. Frankly, I just come here to get full off of shrimp! I know this may sound super unhealthy, but when I have a cheat day, it usually contains fried food. XD\nWow, I'm kind of getting hungry just talking about all this seafood, but I'm in the mood for crab with butter and crab cakes at the moment.\n \nI especially like this location when I'm lucky enough to get a table with a view. Waiters are super friendly and have a lot of background knowledge of the movie. Service can be awfully slow but ambience and d\u00e9cor make up for it whilst you're waiting for your order. \n\nMy mantra when I'm here is to just pig out! \n\nRun, Forrest, Run! \n---------------\n---------------\nOverall rating: 8.5/10 great for the experience \nWater quality: 8/10 not too shabby", "author": "Andy L."}

I showed the host the app and confirmation text message that we should be seated in the next 2 min. There were maybe 3 other parties ahead of us in the waiting walk way but I did not think much of it because we were approaching the dinner rush. \n\nWe waited an additional 20 minutes to be seated... \n\nNot only that once we were seated we were not asked if we wanted any drinks or WATER for another 20 minutes. \n\nWhen our waitress asked if we wanted any starters\nWe made our orders and emphasized we'd like to have waters \n\nShe impatiently nodded and rushed away \nI already knew she wasnt listening Bc she didn't repeat our orders\n\nMy man didn't want to wave anyone down, but being that we had planned to watch a movie later that evening I was not going to be treated like ghosts. \n\nI waved down 2 different servers besides the one assigned to us.

Like, there is a specific reason why I  waving down every single server that passes our table Bc it's blatantly clear that our assigned Server doesn't know how to be one.  On top of that, the other waiters treated us like we were a nuisance for just askin. For water. \nI don't want talk to the side of your face when I'm asking for something nor do I wanna see you explicitly rolling yalls eyes \n\nAt this point we've spent an HOUR WAITING. Not eating or sipping on any sort of beverage. \n\nOur appetizer  comes out lukewarm and at this point I'm over it. How are you going to serve your customers room temperature food? Especially seafood ?! Thank god we ordered a salad in case something went sideways\n\nBy this time we got our cocktails which weren't anything special ( a mojito and hard lemonade )\n\nOur appetizer, the hush puppy things were really salty. \n\n\n. \nI promptly asked where our food was to our ASSIGNED server and she said she'd go\nCheck like.. you just dropped off our appetizer \n\n\n\nThen we waited around 15-20 min longer for our main course\n\nWhen the shrimp came out I only tasted probably 3-4 baby shrimps and they tasted like pre-frozen shrimp that got tossed in a generic spice bag w no salt. \n\nOur salad was the only memorable dish we had\n\nWe finished everything within 35 minutes Bc we were rushing at this point.\n\nBy the time I wave down a server for our check, we get our waters. \n\nLike, come on \n\nYou seriously are going to serve your customers water at the END of their meal especially when they've been asking for water for the entirety of their dinner?\n\nI will\nNEVER\nGo back to this establishment \n\nThere should be no reason to stay at a restaurant for almost 2 hours and spending most of it waiting to be served \n\nAnd I will throughly tell people who are considering this restaurant to go somewhere else( I can recommend a handful of options )  or make your own bucket of shrimp at home.", "author": "Sun K."}

Our food was good but the portion was, massive. Unfortunately, we didn't finish our entrees and the server did not ask if we would like to take it to go. My problem was, as a tourist, I saw many homeless people on the streets. As for these restaurants with so many leftovers, I could have given someone a meal for the day. It is a problem I noticed with most restaurants I visited in Cali. We both took home souvenir cups which we got along with our drinks. Mine did light up once upon a time.

Was just here with my gf and I got the shrimp mac and cheese and it was depressing! $12 for the smallest portion and the shrimp was not fresh at all which is weird since this place is literally over water. Tasted like it came from a big frozen bag of shrimp and they just warmed it up a little. My gf just got a kids grilled cheese which is one of the most simplest things to make and some how they messed that up also. It was a little burnt and very little cheese. It was more like a burnt piece of bread with a touch of cheese. Not to mention this was at 11am on Tuesday and we were like the only ones in this place just about and the food was horrible. Surprised they served us this food when it was that bad. Our waitress was pretty good tho which is why I'm putting 2 stars.

Before ordering, I liked looking out at all the boats sailing by and the shimmering ocean waters as the night darkened. Waiter was superb. His service and character is definitely a 5 star. He was quite amusing to keep in theme with trivia. Few of the questions he asked were from the movie Forrest Gump. I was amused and happy to still remember some answers. The Seafood here is just okay. I think I would like to try other variety of dishes if ever returning here, which would actually be more unlikely, even if I wanted. So, first & last type of dining experience.\n\nDuring dinner, the fried items were okay, but lacked flavor. Sauces were good and necessary. Just too many fried items felt overwhelming to me. \n\nI liked my Strawberry Speckled drink. Usually I prefer some sort of virgin Strawberry Lemonade type of drink at restaurants so I was happy with the that choice.\n\nThe items had were:\n- Calmari\n- Shrimp and Veggie Skewers\n- Shrimper's Heaven\n- \"I'm Stuffed\" Shrimp\n\nCalamari: This was the appetizer of deep fried calamari with roasted red bell peppers and pepperocini. It comes with sauces.\n\nShrimp and Veggie Skewers: These 2 skewers of shrimp, red bell peppers, red onion, yellow squash, and zucchini were chargrilled and served on jasmine rice with lemon garlic cream sauce.\n\nShrimper's Heaven: Lots of people in the restaurant ordered this one. It piqued my interest. This comes in four shrimp varieties, which are hand breaded coconut shrimp, grilled shrimp, crisp golden shrimp and tempura shrimp. All of those are with fries and yummy sauces called Tangy Asian, Cajun Marmalade, and Zesty Cocktail.\n\n\"I'm Stuffed\" Shrimp: Originally when I read the description, I was interested upon reading shrimp and crab, but it wasn't that appetizing. So, pass on this in the future. This is shrimp with crab stuffing baked in garlic butter, topped with Monterey Jack Cheese, then served around jasmine rice which is in the middle. Plus a piece of bread.\n\nMostly food was average. I liked the sauces with Shrimper's Heaven and the shrimp covered in coconut was good. People all around seemed to be having fun and the restaurant was pretty packed. They serve non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks here like beer, wine, specialty drinks and margaritas.

One dining experience here will prove to you why.\n\nWe received a free artichoke dip & chip appetizer from a Yelp Coupon by checking into Pier 39. The artichoke dip was disappointing because it arrived to our table at room temperature and had sections of it still cold, similar to the results of microwaving TV dinner brownies. The chips were also cold and some were stale. They gave us a second artichoke dip and the results were about the same.\n\nAs for my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the veggie burger (to join in the spirit of eating veg with my vegetarian/vegan friends). The burger was large but the fries were less than expected. The burger was OK. It put something in my stomach.\n\nThe atmosphere is like eating at Chucky Cheese. It's very noisy and over-the-top festive. There were two birthdays that day so the staff was required to do their shouting routine. Overall, the atmosphere is more suitable for family with young kids.\n\nService is very slow. We waited 15-20 minutes only to process our bill. They also ran into technical issues when trying to use the appetizer coupon because of how we split the check.\n\nThe host was rude to us while my friend and I were waiting at a stand up table next to the restroom. She blatantly asked us to leave while another family was behind her waiting on us. It made us look like idiots.\n\nOverall I would never come here again.

I am only giving this place 1 star because I have to at least leave 1 star to leave a review. \n\nMy boyfriend and I chose this as a lunch option while vacationing in the bay. We were looking for a restaurant that had a casual vibe, delicious seafood and was reasonably priced in the fisherman's warf area. Causal vibe- yes.... that's about the only thing good about this place besides being able to see the bay if seated near a window.  We asked our waitress for a drink suggestion and she mentioned the frozen margarita. We inquired about whether or not they would truly be a frozen margarita (she said yes) and took her up on her suggestion. The drinks arrived and they were far from frozen. They looked like \"on the rocks\" margaritas with chips of ice placed in them. We sent the drinks back and told her they were def not frozen. She then proceeded to tell us (after we had specifically had a convo about it) that the margarita machine had been broken for weeks and these were handmade with a blender. For $17 a drink- we expected to get what we asked for. \u200d\n\nDisappointed with the drinks, we decided to order soda instead and hoped that some delicious seafood would turn things around! WRONG! We asked for a recommendation on the food (same time as we asked about the drinks) and our server suggested \"The Feast\"- so we went with it. Apparently it's one of their most popular dishes. We placed our order... and waited...and waited.... annnnnddddd waiiiittteddd. Finally we saw our server coming with our \"feast,\" which was everything that a feast is not. There was hardly any food. The food (shrimp, hush puppies) that was included was mostly fried batter and bland. The fries were terrible!\n\nPlease do not waste your time or your money here.

Even when this place is packed and busy, once you get seated, their service is still wonderful. It's helps that they have the sign you can flip to if you ever need help and someone will stop and help you. \"Run Forest Run\" if you don't need assistance and \"Stop Forest Stop\" if you do. Pretty simple lol. Even when the wait is long, I believe it's worth it. They take your number down and will text you when your name is close to being called and another text when it's your table's turn! So you can walk around the pier as you wait. I always order the lava flow. The taste of coconut is so delicious and it's so refreshing. Whoever I'm with always asks for a taste and they end up enjoying it more than the drink they order ;) I always always always order the bucket of boat trash. For over 10 years, that's what I've always gotten but they've changed it! I couldn't find it yesterday and they changed it for almost the same thing but instead of getting crab legs with it, you get deep fried lobster tail. So this one time, I went with the feast entree. Which my hubby has gotten so I knew I would enjoy it! I also love their run across America sampler. Perfect for sharing! Or if you're like me, you won't want to share. It's got wings, HUSH PUPPIES (favorite), shrimp cocktail, breaded shrimp, and spinach artichoke dip with chips. It's a little bit of everything, so there's something for everyone to enjoy. Sometimes, if they're not so busy. You're server will play a little game with you and another table and do a quiz on the movie! It's a pretty fun place. You just have to wait if you have a large party as they have to clear tables and move seats around. Again, worth it. And most of their drinks, you get take home souvenir cups!

Unfortunately, I was wrong. To start off, their \"strawberry lemonades\" tasted more like water with a splash of flavored strawberry syrup. Secondly, it took 22 minutes for two beverages to arrive. Soon thereafter, we realized we did not have settings upon our food arriving. My younger sister ordered a kids pizza which was cold and did not taste the best. Oh, did I mention that the fries (her side) was non-existing when her food came in. Our waitress was not the most attentive as She was \"covering\" for another server and I am sure had other priority tables. It is safe to say that I will not be coming back. I had been here before with a large group of 50+ & we had a lackluster experience, but I figured I would give it another try. $70 later, it is safe to say that it was a huge MISTAKE! I asked to speak to the manager to thank her after the credit, but like the fries, she did not show up. It would have gotten one star, but since drinks were credited- it gets a second star.

I returned yesterday with a colleague to give it one last chance and immediately regretted it. Where should I start... our table was filthy, we actually had to clean it ourselves. One waiter literally picked his nose then took plates out to serve. People around us who ordered the same simple happy hour menu food that arrived after we did we getting served before us. We would have never been served if we didn't complain. Then they brought our cold food out which had obviously been sitting somewhere. No apologies.

They were so stressed out and complained about everything. They had such an attitude about every little thing. They need training on how to keep their composure and professionalism... I bartend too and it does get very stressful but you need to know how to compose yourself. They were expressing all their feelings and drama in the restaurant in front of customers and yelling at the waitresses & bar backs, shoving each other, etc. it was very unprofessional.

Unfortunately, that wasn't the case... \n\nI ate lunch here with my boyfriend and his family while we were at Pier 39 and I ordered Bubba's After the Storm \"Bucket of Boat Trash.\" I saw some reviews on Yelp recommending it, while others said it was a no-go. In the end, I still ordered it and boy did I regret it... I felt like it was nowhere worth the $22.99 that it was priced at. Do not be fooled by the appetizing picture I took! The shrimp and fish sticks tasted like they were like frozen food items that you could get at any grocery store. Their seasoned fries also tasted very dry and not appetizing at all. I enjoy fries from fast food places like Jack in the Box or Ruby's much more than the ones I received with my order at Bubba Gump's. The only thing I enjoyed was the crab legs which was hardly filling at all... I really did not enjoyedmy order at all and enjoyed my boyfriend's order of \"...Of Course We Have Scampi!\" much more. Perhaps if I ordered a different menu item my experience would have been much different. \n\nThe service was also mediocre. Our server would constantly take dishes away from our table without even asking if we were finished with it, which was quite annoying. \n\nOverall, I don't think I would choose to eat here again since I find their food to be extremely overpriced for the quality and quantity they give you. There are much better things to eat at Pier 39 and I wish I chose to eat there instead.", "author": "Angela A."}

She then comes back to me and says I'm $43 short because one of my gift cards didn't have that much . When I explained to her I check the gifts cards before handing them to her They had enough to cover the bill and I gave her cash to cover the rest she said I didn't have enough. We were in a rush to leave because we had to catch the ferry back Then she came up to me and said what she did was use one of my gift cards and paid for another party's meal at my table so she carried their remaining balance to what I have  left which made my balance now  $46.

However there is room for improvement.\n\nThe service was really good. Truthfully, I've been to a Bubba Gump's on the East Coast, and their service was so much better. However, that was mostly due to the fact that we went as a huge group of people, so it was probably treated like a special event. The service here was still good though. They ask you trivia from Forrest Gump (no prizes though). I also like how they're means of knowing when a table needs service is the flip sign. It the sign reads \"Stop Forrest Stop\", the waiters know to stop at the table to tend to your needs.\n\nMy dish was exceptional. Definitely on the expensive side but well-worth it. Eating seafood by the sea just seems so right. My girlfriend ordered the Bubba's After the Storm \"Bucket of Boat Trash\". Needless to say, she shared some with me, and I was shocked at the quality of the fish sticks. They were not on par with the rest of the dishes. They tasted like something from the cheap frozen section at your local 99 cents store. Other than that the dish was fine, but not worth the money. The bucket was also deceptive. It is NOT full, but rather, the components of the dish rest on top of a paper that sinks slightly into the bucket.\n\nI believe that I would come back only because of the fact that it is a well known restaurant that provides good quality family fun. The food is great, but it itself is not the main attraction of this restaurant.", "author": "Jaime J."}

We are traveling and decided to try out Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. cool looking place, lots of cool memorabilia and decor, nice view of pier, great service (not including one incident), and horrible food that made us both ill. \n\nFirst of all, the peel & eat shrimp appetizer is complete false advertisement. That alone is not acceptable. They show a huge pot of jumbo shrimp in reality it's a teeny-tiny pot of farm-raised tiny soft shelled (which makes them hard to peel) shrimp. The seasoning was good, but seriously disappointed. \n\nSecondly, my husband's fish sandwich & fries..boring, bland, looked like a chicken sandwich from\nMcDonald's except McDonald's fries actually have flavor and a crunch to them. Everything about this did was bland.\n\nThirdly, my Caesar salad was cruddy, worst restaurant salad I'd ever had. And the gumbo had way too much of ONE spice, overpowering and wasn't traditional at all.\n\nMost importantly, my husband and I were totally ill afterwards. We both got sick. We shared the gumbo, so it had to be that. \n\nGot a 1 star for good service & cool decor, and because that's the lowest I could give. Sorry, but not happy.", "author": "Amber M."}

I wish we could have gotten the window seats to see the view as it was not foggy this time. =) We sat down and I saw a couple of tables empty but still with dirty dishes from previous customers. A little unorganized to me. =(   Staff was friendly though.\n\nAll the drinks we ordered were good. We got the drinks where you keep the glasses. We ordered:\n\nCrab stuffed mushrooms was good.\n\nGarlic bread - was buttered garlic flavored but not worth $5.50.\n\nSeafood pasta - It was cooked pretty well with lots of sauce and it was tasty. I thought it was bigger with more seafood for $20?\n\nLt Dan's tilapia with lobster sauce - this was good. The fish was cooked just right with a little crispness on the edges. The mashed potatoes was freshly mashed real red potatoes but the only thing it was lacking more lobster sauce! I wouldn't price this dish at $20?\n\nBourbon mahi mahi - had no flavor...the prawns were shrimp! Lol Hella small! $20 though?\n\nSalmon with veggies - was dry and no flavor. The veggies were aldante! Not worth it.\n\nMy son got a burger  with BBQ sauce but it was more bun then burger. The fries were good. \n\nI think the place is more touristy than anything and the dishes were overpriced as well as the drinks. My rating would have been a little less than three stars.

I would actually highly recommend the strawberry mango frozen lemonade. Unfortunately, you can't opt out of the souvenir glass to save yourself a buck or two. I really liked it though! So if you actually WANT a souvenir glass, then it sounds like a no brainer. As for our appetizer, we were starving, so we ordered the Run Across America Sampler which included chips and dip, cocktail shrimp, chicken strips, hush puppies, and fried shrimp. Everything in there was good enough.\n\nFor my actual meal, I had the Bubba's After The Storm \"Bucket Of Boat Trash\" which included more fried shrimp, some fish strips.

When we arrived with the person who's birthday it was same thing, except this time they said we didn't reserve a room, but even then we asked where we would have our event (we paid nearly two thousand dollars for two hours, A large portion in ADVANCE!!) they brought us to the regular seating area, how are we supposed to put 30+ people at a bunch of spread out tables mixed in next to other diners on two different levels ( not drastically different heights, but a few feet higher) The food was already supposed to be ready or at least set aside to be warmed or cooked as we went over the menu and picked in advance, but it took nearly an hour to get anything, it was all just frozen food recooked in the first place I could have made better food with a toaster oven and a $2.00 yellow box of gortons fish sticks WITH FREEZER BURN from foodsco.

I know now that they were understaffed, but the severe lack of communication to the patrons made our entire party quite frustrated. Once we did get our seats, the service was mediocre, basically ignoring the sign \"stop and go\" policy which usually guarantees quick service, and witnessed at least a few meals drop to the floor while staff members simply laughed it off.

When we got sat it took almost 10 minutes to be greeted, my friends ordered their drinks and I ordered the premium bloody Mary. A different server came and dropped off the drinks a few minutes later and I automatically told that server my drink was wrong they gave me the regular bloody Mary.

When I finally got to tell her she then apologized and went to get the right drink. From where I was sitting I could see the bar and watched that bloody Mary sit till I was finished with my food the only thing the bartender did was put a shrimp on the drink and sent it back. I paid $14 for a watered down well drink and a half frozen shrimp, not acceptable! As for my meal I  ordered the shrimp scampi and had asked if I could get cajun seasoning in it, server said sure but it didn't come out Cajun. She didn't stay around long enough for me to even get her attention to say anything, she checked up on us at the end of the meal and asked if my meal had Cajun, I said  no but there's no point now cuz I'm full. As for the appetizer we we got after our meals we were told it is because that appetizer takes forever to make. Ok great ring in the appetizer first then wait a few minutes before ringing in the meal or put a hold on the meal itself.

It's a bro-filled touristy place you'll find in many major tourist cities, but damn it if I haven't had a great time every time I've been here. With friends, family, we all just put ourselves in the right mood, go with the flow, and we have fun, genuine fun. \n\nThe food has never been great, however when I first started going almost 20 years ago it was definitely better than it is now. Not surprising, we're talking a chain that knows where to put its money. People aren't going there for gourmet meals. The prices are on the higher side for the quality, but again, you pay for tourist places. Don't go there looking for a good deal, go there looking to have fun and eat mediocre food.\n\nThe servers have always been friendly with us. Maybe it's forced, maybe they just hire friendly people, who knows. Either way, they do a great job serving us while entertaining us with Forrest Gump facts and other little games. \n\nI recently noticed that somewhere along the line they went from having several tvs all over showing Forrest Gump to only one tiny almost unnoticeable one in the waiting area. Less props and costumes from the movie are found hanging in glass cases. But that's what happens in these kind of places. The more they expand the cheaper they get. I still have a good time there. Also, if you're looking for souvenir crap to buy they definitely have you covered! Everything from the light up glass your drink came in to prawn magnets to a full scale selection of various types of clothing. Honestly, it's better than an I heart SF tshirt.", "author": "Shannon H."}

Based off of the cultural sensation Forrest Gump, the place offers great Cajun cuisine in a lively environment.\n\nMy group was greeted somewhat promptly but to find out - we had to wait 30 minutes to get a table! I had previously expected a wait with the popularity on this touristy pier but not this long! This definitely brought down a star from me.\n\nWe finally got our table in the timeframe requested and noticed the wide variety of decorations from Forrest Gump. It was pretty cool how we could flip license plates to indicate if we needed attention (Stop Forrest Stop, Run Forrest Run). Our waiter was extremely generous and welcoming, offering suggestions for our group and providing loads of information about each dish!\n\nWhile patiently waiting for our glorious dishes, some waiters around us announced that a customer  was celebrating their birthday and asked us to cheer! This just added to the lively environment, everyone seemed excited and ecstatic. We also noticed that the view was spectacular, although dark the Bay Bridge shined so well with the night sky. \n\nFinally, the food. When it arrived we were completely stunned! The fries, shrimp, and fish I had were absolutely glorious in every way as they had their own spice and were perfectly cooked. They had the right amount of salt, fat, and flavor as a whole! The best Cajun food I've ever had!\n\nThis is a must-go place to chomp on if you ever visit San Francisco! This chain can only be found in mainly coastal cities and although it's on the expensive side the atmosphere (and view) makes up for it! This is truly an unforgettable experience one should never miss!\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPros:\n-Great atmosphere\n-The view!!\n-Utterly amazing food\n\nCons:\n-Long time to wait\n-On the pricey side\n\nFinal Rating:\n-A regretful but reasonable/justifiable FOUR STARS", "author": "Edmund Z."}

She was more like \"Hey, let me know is when you guys are ready. \" When our food finally came out it was a disappointment. We had ordered the \"Forest seafood feast\".

I didn't mind it, but it was quite the surprise when I bit into the pepper.  The shrimp mac n cheese was pretty good as well.  From my husbands dish, I loved the hush puppies because they were super flavorful.  My jambalaya was also very good, but I barely made a dent in it because we had so much food on the table.

The waitress was very friendly and efficient, but the food left some things to desire. We love going to this place because of the setting. There is a large covered deck overlooking the river. You can sit there have a few drinks, and watch the river flow by. You can watch the steady flow of people, boats, and ski dos. It was in the afternoon when we went and very hot. But they have fans with misters to help keep things a little cooler. \nMy wife had the Cajun shrimp which she enjoyed. It was overall satisfactory. We would have liked to rave about it, but in reality it was just slightly \"above average\". I had the steamed shellfish bucket. Here is the odd part. Some of the items were good, some not. There was big crab claw which had the taste and consistency of sawdust. Horrible. The muscles were tough and chewy. However, the shrimp and clams were great. It should have been called the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde bucket. It is also very expensive for what you get. My advice would be to go there, order a couple of drinks and take in the river view. If you eat, get the standard stuff such as fried or steamed shrimp. Goodluck.", "author": "Gerry B."}

It's kind of hard to find at first - you really have to go to the very end of the pier to get there.\n\nThe restaurant is huge, and there's a nice bench on the front, complete with giant shoes and suitcase, for you to recreate the Forrest Gump movie cover.\n\nThe first thing you notice about the interior is that there are awesome, wall to wall windows with great views of the pier, the bridge, and Alcatraz. It was definitely worth plowing through the bad food to get to sit in the natural light and gawk at the bay.\n\nYep, as previously mentioned, the food was pretty horrible. The entire menu is seafood based, and most of it involves some kind of shrimp or breading - it just all kind of tasted like it had come out of the freezer via the microwave.\n\nThe service is interesting - there's a series of license plates on the front which you cycle through - the red one means you want service, and some other one means you don't need service. We tried using it and found that we were mostly ignored. \n\nOverall, I'm really glad dropped by - the views were definitely worth checking out.

This was my first time back in about 3 years and I can honestly say I don't think I will be coming back. They did seat us very quickly tonite. But, There was so much disorganization it was crazy. \n\n1st issue: I had about 3 different waiters come and tell me they were my waiter. This happened right after the 1st waiter took my drink order. The 2nd one came and started going over the process of things, and asked what I would like to drink. I explained to her someone had already taken the drink order. The 3rd waitress came and let me know she would like to get the drinks started and again, I let this one know that someone had already taken the order. The1st waiter came back and looked rather annoyed with the 2nd waiter for stealing her table. Not sure what happened in the background but we ended up with waiter number 2 as our waitress for the rest of the night.\n\n2nd issue: I ordered water for myself and an apple juice for my son. The apple juice came, but the water didn't. Had to ask if I could have a water on 3 occasions when the last time I asked it still hadn't come. They took our food order a short while later, still no water. Once they took my order I again, had several waiters come out to confirm the order...not sure if it was an off night, the food came pretty quickly once they told me the order was in.\n\n3rd Issue: When I got my food it was cold :(. I had been looking forward to this since again, I hadn't been here in about 3 years. The plate usually comes out sizzling hot and the cheese has this amazing oooey gooey, yet cheesy crust and the crab stuffing is very tasty. Tonite it was very mushy, barely warm and unfortunately kind of grossed me out. I ordered a shrimp skewer and jasmine rise for my son. He choked on the shrimp from how over cooked it was. I took a taste of his and found that the cajun shrimp skewer had absolutely no cajun taste to it, it was like they just threw it on the stove and forgot about it for a bit and threw it on a plate when they remembered. \n\nI understand that they are very busy but the quality of the food tonight left a lot to be desired. I asked for my check as fast as I could and got the heck out of there. I felt bad for the person we ended up with as our waiter, it looked like it was her first night working and wasn't really being given direction and just looked lost. They ended up dropping some dirty plates in another booth that had guests sitting in it and she looked mortified. Maybe in another 3 years the place will hav improved its organization and food quality before sending it out, especially for plates being at $18 dollars and higher.", "author": "Sonia L."}

When you get there, you'll notice a line. The wait times usually aren't terrible, but there isn't a lot of place to sit while waiting. They have a gift shop right next door, do you can spend some time buying t shirts or pens or whatever while you wait for a seat. Now the wait is over and you're in! What to expect: it's loud, and crowded. There's music playing from speakers overhead and the noise from people yelling over the speakers, combined with the usual restaurant clatter all mix into a dull roar. This isn't the place you want to go for a romantic evening. But, if you're up for some noise and activity then this is where you want to be. The service during this last visit was particularly slow, probably due to the amount of people there and the limited staff. There was a manager walking around handling various duties to assist the staff. Once our orders were placed, the food arrived quickly. Our waiter tried his best to keep up with the demands of a party of 6. The food was very good. I would say just shy of great... The only reason it got 3 stars was the noise and the slow service. I would definitely recommend to anyone and I will return.", "author": "Michael S."}

I was very excited to try out this spot, after seeing many locations, but after this experience I don't think I'll go back. \nWe got seated and it took 25 minutes before anyone came over to ask for drinks. By that time we had all decided what we wanted for dinner, so we ordered. Then that took another 45 minutes before we got our food. Once we got our food, half of the items we ordered were wrong. And that took another 15 minutes to fix. \nMy food tasted similar to something I could get out of a frozen package and through in the oven at home. It was not tasty and luke warm when I got it. AND for the prices it was very disappointing (22$). \nAfter all of this we were charged for the things they replaced when our orders were wrong. It was a very infuriating and frusterating experience.

We waited outside for about 15 minutes and got to have our seats after another 5 since they were \"cleaning our tables\".  There was alot of unoccupied tables that are available but clearly our party of 6 had to wait till we're cramped in a table  comfortably good for 4 - hey were a \"big\" group. They seated us by the window so we can see the marina where the boats are. Hmmm nice view but am famished.\n\nThe server was nice, and took our orders with a smile. no problem with that...\n\nThese are what we got:\n\nShrimpers heaven - we gobbled it all up cause we're hungry...its actually really good but looking at other peoples yelp pictures I felt  we were ripped off cause our fries were actually on the other cone and not on the tray and we dont have any coleslaw with our dips.\n\nShrimp scampi \"of course we got scampi\" - my mom didnt finish it because....hmmm\n\nShrimp skewers with bourbon on it...dont remember the actual name but my dad liked it.\n\nSteak and shrimp - the mashed potatoes was blah, the steak medium rare...\"ehhh\" and shrimp was good tho.\n\nJambalaya - really tasty but spicy for my taste, good amount of shrimp and pepper chicken was underneath that tomato spicy rice.\n\nDrinks: mango sparkler and the speckled (strawberry)  lemonade, both were too sweet for our taste so we had to water it down (alarmingly sweet for diabetics). Run forest Run smoothie - the kid liked anything with strawberry on it.\n\nFried chicken and corn - cousin says it was soft and tasty...he finished it minus the corn which was dry...\n\nKids meal - cheese burger on jenny's tug boat...really cute presentation minus the newpaper lining the food...the burger according to the kid was ok  but the blue jello was awesome...something's wrong here...it should be the other way around.\n\nAnyhoo with everything ordered and gobbled, we paid a pricey tab plus tip.

This is by far the best time my daughter and I had in a restaurant. Our waiter was super nice. The manager was very involved with her staff and the customers. I have a fish allergy. Yes I know right. Your thinking why is she eating at a seafood restaurant. My 8 year old won't eat fish around me because she cant touch me. I am severely allergic to fish except shelled fish and squid. So here was the issue. All fish and shellfish is cooked in the same oil. Some items are mixed with fish like the hush puppies. The waiter checked with the chef before placing the order. I am glad he took that precaution. I had waiters in the past bring me food and treat me bad for not knowing. But no not this one. Then the manager came to the table and explained they cooked my shrimp separate to make sure I didn't get sick. Amazing!!!! Thank you so much for the first class treatment.", "author": "Sabrina C."}

I think maybe because I went on a weekday evening it's different? However, we did show up towards the end of closing time (9:30pm) and left about 30 minutes after closing (10pm). \n\n\nI found the place charming and the service was the friendliest. I didn't even know this restaurant existed and was surprised it was based from the movie. There's even a gift shop next to the restaurant.\n\nThe host at the front (don't recall his name but he was a bigger guy with an even bigger smile) was so sweet and greeted us immediately upon entering. Our server Jeremiah was an absolute delight, and we were very appreciative of his patience with us (we were confused about the Run Forrest Run signs and kept flipping them around--he kindly explained what we were doing, oops). The staff were all so friendly and accommodating. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like about the food was the their lengthy names. Lol. Felt like a tongue-twister while ordering. \n\nAll in all, the meal was quite good, but I'm a sucker for anything adorned with shrimp. However, I ordered the Net Catch dish under the \"Jenny\" category in the menu with Cajun seasoning...towards the end of dinner I found myself eating mostly from my boyfriend's plate which was the Bubba's After the Storm Bucket of Boat Trash. I liked the texture better, although the Net Catch was quite flavorful. I recommend adding a few drops of the provided Tabasco in the bucket for an extra kick.\n\nBut I LOVE their drinks. They give you the cup for most of them, and I love mine! It lights up at the bottom and when you lift it up it projects Bubba Gino's 20th Anniversary. I thought it was so cute. Jeremiah offered to rinse it for us after dinner (it was so clean and spotless!). I ordered the Strawberry Mango non-alcoholic freeze thing. Boyfriend had the Coronita with the free shaker which you have to pick up at the gift shop after dinner because it's alcohol. \n\nBut again, I really am grateful for the staff's friendly and kind service.

He then forgot my wife's mango drink until we reminded him several times that we didn't have it yet. When we got our food we realized we had no silverware on the table to eat with. We told the waiter and he brought silverware about 10 minutes later , which also our food got cold by that point. The food was mediocre at best. I could've went to Costco and bought some frozen breaded shrimp and some cocktail sauce and it would've been better. When we tried to pay our card was decline by our bank due to suspicious activity which made us have to pay with a credit card while I was calling to get the card unblocked. When we have the waiter the credit card he went to the register and rolled his eyes to another employee implying that we had no money and were probably going to get declined again.

Whenever I arrive the unpreparedness starts from the desk clerk to the waiter. Of this last time, I ordered 3 chopps for the employee of the bar that serves the drinks, until a table to sit was available; she told me that I had to see the other two people who were going to drink, otherwise it would not suit me! That is, I can not order more than 1 chopp per person! After that, I paid the bill to her and did not add the tip, because I did not like the way she met me and because the tip is optional. After a while, I came back and asked for 3 more chopps and the clerk told me that I did not pay tip the first time and she would not serve me any more! After that and for over an hour waiting, I went to complain to the general manager because they had several empty tables and we were waiting a long time hungry; she said that we should already be waiting in line on a small ramp that exists there, but no one had informed us before; so the manager provided us with a table and said that he would talk to the bar employee about the disrespect she made with me, demanding me tip! We made the request and after more than 30 minutes, arrived the food and the chopps! We ate with much displeasure at the lack of commitment we had from the employees and before we finished, the waitress already brought the bill, without having asked for it! We paid and went away indignantly, me, my wife and a friend! I will not be returning to this place, I do not recommend it and from the first time I went, I was mistreated!

By the time we got back we were all starving and had a very picky 4 year old in tow. We were wondering around pier 39 trying to figure out what to eat. Bubba Gumps wasn't our first choice we live pretty close to the area and generally avoid the over touristy places, but after reviewing the menu and saw a short wait, we figured why Not? \nI'm glad we stopped the prices aren't much higher than Red Lobster. We were seated with a great view of the water, definitely a plus.  All of our food came out quickly and tasted great. My son's kids meals was so cute, came in a shrimp boat!.. \n\nNot sure why there is so many complaints on here over the prices, its seafood, on pier 39.

Honestly, I can't remember what we all ate but I do remember everyone saying they had enjoyed it.\n\nMy second visit was today. My mom, sister, and I came here spontaneously after looking at the sea lions. I think the theme of the restaurant is great since I love Forrest Gump.\n\nFood: I can't speak for my family about their food. But for me, I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos and a cup of Clam chowder. (The food they had ordered are in the photos I had posted.) We also had calamari for appetizer.\nThe tacos were not as tasty as I hoped. Not sure how to explain it, but I felt that they were missing something, just not sure what. The clam chowder though, that stuff was the bomb. I loved it. I think the cup is the perfect size because it's not too little and not too much (you can see the difference in size between the cup and bowl size of chowder in the photos I posted.) The calamari was delicious and both sauces it came with were great. However, I just wish the portion was a little better since basically almost half of the serving was fried banana peppers and red peppers.\n\nService: I didn't catch the name of the guy who helped us but he was very kind.

Our server was cool and nice so we thought Until he made a racial comment to me and my friends. We asked why one of the dishes are called \"boat Trash\" he goes \"its just something kind of ironic, you know like with you being black, if you called me darkskinned that would be ironic\" that was the example he used for \"ironic\". Why he used an example in the first place as if we didnt understand what ironic meant anyway... im not sure but it was unnecessary af.. after he said it, i looked up confused and then he pat me on the shoulder and told me \"dont think about it too much\" sarcastically. I should have went off on him right then and there but I let it go and we continued to order. \n\nThen my friend asked our server if one of the dishes would fill her up. He said yes, then while we were eating she playfully told our server \"you said this would fill me up but im not full\" lol (my friend is really goofy). Our server then goes \"Look, you guys had a whole hour to decide if you wanted to eat here and what you wanted to order. Im just trying to do my job here.\" And then he stormed off before we could even process the fact that he really had us messed up.. \n\nSo he comes back like nothing ever happened. We are pretty easy going girls and dont take much seriously so when he came back and offered to refill my friends lemonade i ask him \"oh are you trying to redeem yourself now?\" With a smile on my face Lol i guess this simple question made him mad and he goes \"look im just doing my job here, so do you want a refill or not\" we said no and he says ok and walks away. we didnt even know what to say so we told the manager who didnt do anything to rectify the situation.. when our server came back to the table i asked him if he was ok bc i didnt understand what exchange had prompted him to start being so rude to us all of a sudden.. then he raised his hands again and rolled his eyes and said \"its just a job im just doing my job and walked away\" like WTF \n\nMoral of the story, my first and last time ever coming back here.", "author": "Zakiya B."}

The wait was about 1.5 hrs (for a group of 14) but it's not too bad since the pier has so much going on that killing time was easy. There's a nice arcade bar downstairs that you can grab a few drinks and play games as you wait. \n\nThis was my first time at bubba! I've always heard about it, but I never took the time to drive up here to dine at this restaurant. It's pricey if you're not into paying a lot for a dish, BUT do keep in mind that it is a seafood place. So for that reason, the price is actually reasonable. They serve a variety of dishes: fish tacos,  burgers, surf and turf, and much more. They also have a nice bar with quick service! \n\nThe atmosphere is great. All of the waiters and waitresses are friendly and do look like they're having a fun time at work. Our server Michael was super fun! Every table apparently is asked trivia questions about Forrest Gump! Our table did pretty damn well since we had two big Forrest Gump fans. Michael was helpful and he checked up on us often. Even other waiters/waitresses would check up on us every now and then. \n\nSo the food! Everything looked and tasted amazing (no one complained about their food). I had the baja fish tacos, grilled. It was delicious. The fish was cooked perfectly and flour tortilla is my favorite so that was a plus. I love that they served the condiments for the tacos on the side. That way, I could measure how much I wanted on my taco, and it also prevents the tortilla from soaking up the liquid and tearing apart. \n\nI was able to try their fries and it was very tasty! Like everything else, cooked perfectly. There's this tangy sauce (orange/yellow color) they had served with a shrimp order and it was great to dip fries/chips in as well. I may ask for that sauce on the side the next time I visit. \n\nVisit bubba gump whenever you're in the city! Great food and great atmosphere :)", "author": "Gina N."}

Our server told us it was ok to go up to the bar and get happy hour drinks. My friend went up first, got a drink. Then I went up next. When I went up to the bar, the bartender (a man with long black hair) asked me if I came from a table. I said yes. Then he proceeds to tell me he can't serve me and I have to order drinks from my table (full price.) I say \"excuse me?\" He goes \"Yeh someone got in trouble for it before, sorry.\" He tells me I can come back when I'm done eating. I tell him \"happy hour will be over by then.\" He just looks at me like \"yehhhhh.\" Did this man really just tell me how to spend my money? I tell my server this and she tells me she has been working there forever and has never heard of his none existent policy. Now I'm wondering if the guy was lying to me. Turns out there was another bartender my friend got the drink from. Rather than make a fuss with the manager, I just sat there as my friend enjoyed her discounted drink. Second gripe.

So we migrate to the other one. Were greeted immediately but then this host ignores us for a while which I would understand if she were waiting for a table to clear but no, because once again, this host is joking with coworkers until an entirely different person comes up and asks if we've even been helped yet and then we're immediately seated. So after finally being seated, I have to say I love the decor and layout of this Bubba Gump a lot more than the Monterey location. We weren't even seated by the window but we still had an amazing view of the bay. We had two servers (since our first server's shift was over mid-meal) and while we may have had shitty customer service from the hosts, our waiters were AMAZING. KENNY S. and I believe our original waiter's name was KEVIN, were both absolutely great. Truly top notch! \n\nNow on to the food, I always order the shrimper's heaven which I loooove. Comes with 4 different styles of shrimp and fries. I also ordered the coronitas (the regular margarita one and the special one). The drinks were bleh. I regret ordering them. They're overpriced at 14 dollars and not even good. The syrup was so thick and, no matter how much I stirred, was not dissolving well. The alcohol wasn't strong at all.

One thing that's a plus is that they take your cell phone number to text you when the table is ready so till then you can walk around the pier. We only ordered the appetizers as we were just trying out the place. The shrimp was amazing, had the perfect amount of seasoning and sauce, and of course the fries were well seasoned. They offer many different types of entr\u00e9e, which entail more shrimp since that's what they are known for. If your a shrimp lover than you are definitely going to enjoy this place. The atmosphere is hip and happening with music, and if your lucky to snag a sit by the window then you will get to enjoy an amazing view. The customer was alright it wasn't exceptional, we had many different waiters so it did get confusing when we had questions about our orders. Also, if you need to get a hold of a waiter or when your ready to order than they have a sign on the table that you flip to get attended. \"Run Forrest run\" sign is when you don't need their service and \"Stop Forrest Stop\" is when a waiter will come to your table; otherwise, if you get your food don't expect anyone to come and check on you or your food.

It took a while for out waters but they were swamped, so it was a bit understandable. \n\nThe stuffed mushrooms & shrimp mac & cheese was AMAZING.

For a Cajun dish, though, it was really lacking in the flavor department. I had to make my own side sauce of lime, salt, and pepper.\n\nFish tacos were ordinary fish tacos. The Shrimp Po Boy..  not so great. It was just the wrong kind of bread for a Po Boy - like a sub sandwich. Too doughy, no crispness and no flavor. It would've been better if they used a Baguette as the bread, instead.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience. Overpriced, though. This turned out to be our most expensive meal the entire trip and we barely got as much food as we did at other places. The shrimp cocktail was ridiculously priced. \n\nThe drinks were good.

That don't work, I think she was hoping we would go for boosters, but the kids ain't there yet. We declined and scored a window table! I forgot exactly what I got, but it was a little smaller than I thought. It had snow crab, clams and mussels, I forget if there was lobster. The kids had a icon shrimp meal, I forget what the wife had. Food was ok (it's bubba gumps after all).\n\nOne thing that annoyed me was that I asked the waiter for a few extra bibs for the kids. He said it will be brought out with the food. Don't see the server for a long time. Food comes out and I don't see extra bibs so I ask for some from the guy who brought the food. Sure he says..never see that guy again. We flip the \"stop Forrest stop\" sign and another server got us extra bibs in a few minutes. Liked how hard would it have been for the other two dudes to do that? Our server drops in right after. I know it's petty to get hung up on stuff like this but I hate repeating myself. I don't like tiling less either because my kids make a mess sometimes and I'm\nnot going to screw the bussers for the other people. \n\nThis satisfied my bubba gumps craving for some time, I think I'll work on training my kids to eat at a nice table so that we can bring them to Thang Long", "author": "Chris C."}

The wait wasn't too bad, about 20 min since we went a little after they opened. The food was good as usual, but the rest of our experience was awful. The staff was just rude, the vibe was just totally off. Our waitress took our drink & food order quick because we knew what we wanted. I ordered my daughter a slurpee, which she never got but was charged for it on my receipt. We also ordered a appetizer & told the girl we had a coupon for it. Our appetizer came out AFTER our food. Really?! We were there for maybe an hour & our waitress came to check on us 1 time. My husband asked for a refill on his sprite. The waitress filled his cup up with water even after telling her it was sprite. I never got a refill when I was there. We got our bill back with the charge for the slurpee we never got & for the appetizer that we said we had a free coupon for. So we asked to speak to a manager. Even he was rude. Not to mention it was HOT in the restaurant. My 4 year old was red, sweaty & whiny because how hot it was. It was 85 that day, which is super hot for SF, but still. The restaurant shouldn't be that hot. I honestly don't think we will ever return to this location again, which makes me sad because that was one of the reasons we went to SF.

Since I enjoyed the movie and l love seafood, I had high expectations for Bubba Gump Shrimp.  My first experience at this location left me saying...eh, the food isn't too shabby, but most things on the menu were overpriced, which was to be expected.\n\nOur picks:\n1. Shrimp scampi - shrimp tossed over linguine pasta; it was creamy and lemony but tasted bland.  Portion size was small for the price.\n\n2. Caesar salad: nice salad with tender grilled chicken and fresh romaine lettuce.\n\n3. Dixie Fishwich: quite tasty and portion was huge.  The fries that came along with the dish were seriously good!  \n\n4. Forest seafood feast: included fried shrimp, fish and chips, and hush puppies.  All were delicious!  \n\nThe magnificent view of Pier 39 and the finer details of the movie decorations across the restaurant really made this place memorable.  The service was friendly, but perhaps too friendly - they quizzed us on Movie Trivia while we were busy stuffing our faces, haha!

It was flavorful and packed a punch!  I'd skip the garlic bread and the spinach & artichoke dip since it was nothing really special.  The shrimp tacos were okay, the steamed shellfish was decent, and the scampi was delicious but a bit on the saltier side with the overload of capers.\n\nOverall it was a fun gimmicky place to try and it's cool how they let you  keep the light-up cup from ordering a Strawberry Freeze.

On the Pier until sunset, then dinner at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Now don't get my wrong, Pier 39 has many wonderful places to eat, who doesn't like clam chowder in sourdough bread bowls? I can't help myself, I LOVE shrimp, and I love Forrest Gump, and this restaurant is a wonderful homage to this classic movie. This time on our trip to the city, we brought our two best friends along for the ride. I wanted to show my friend Sara San Francisco because she had never been, and seeing as how her hunny loves shrimp we all decided on Bubba Gump's!\n\nThe wait time was a bit long, about 45 minutes. However they offer a text message when your table is ready, therefore we continued browsing the shops until our text came. Once we were sat, the fun began! Our waitress came instantly and took our drink orders, along with explaining how the Stop and Run Forrest Run sign works. When it's on Run Forrest Run, wait staff knows to keep going, but once flipped to stop, any wait staff to see it will stop and ask what you need! I love this system because getting service is much quicker.\n\nThe menu has SO many different shrimp options, it really is hard to decide what to get! It used to be the wait staff would ask you trivia questions from the movie too...I don't know if they've stopped doing it, or only do it when its not so busy...but when they do, it really adds to the experience and I enjoy it...plus it buys me some more time to look at the menu because I can never decide!!\n\nWe started with Mama Gump's Garlic Bread Basket because who doesn't love garlic bread? The bread is very yummy in my opinion; a good amount of butter and garlic makes it perfect. Sara Ordered the, \"Of course we have Scampi\" Shrimp Scampi. Her hunny ordered the, \"I'm Stuffed!\" Shrimp, I ordered the Shrimper's Heaven and my hubby ordered the All American BBQ Burger. We all tried each other's for optimum sampling! Sara's scampi was amazing! Full of capers, tomatoes and lemon garlic butter, this pasta is really tasty! The stuffed Shrimp was one of my favorite things tried that night! They were loaded with crabmeat stuffing and Monterey jack cheese with garlic butter...I may just be in love with Garlic Butter TBH!! My Shrimper's heaven was great and I instantly fell madly in love with the coconut shrimp with the best Cajun marmalade ever. I found myself finishing everyone's dinners when they all offered me the rest! A 4 hour long drive home doesn't make for good leftovers after all.

But they did not make bread bowls. It just a bowl, a very small bowl for the price you pay. It's $5.95 for a cup and $7.95 for a bowl, and the bowl had half of what I can get at the Pier Market or at Fog Harbor's. And it wasn't that special either. It had a somewhat of a tangy, tomato flavor that was actually pretty good. \n\n\nMy other friend ordered some plate of coconut fried shrimp. There were 7 pieces and it was $21.95. Really? \n\nThe Forrest Gump trivia the server gave us was annoying too. I love Forrest Gump, and so does one of my friends (he memorized every single line of the movie no joke), but we weren't in the mood with interacting with our server. We were there to talk about our own things, and it seemed as though they just forced us into it. \n\ngotta say the view here is pretty night though, but i'm never coming here again.", "author": "Sharon C."}

When ordering drinks we asked for a Bahama Mama and were told they can make it then 5 mins later told they couldn't because they were missing Banana Liqueur but that they can try to still make it. We just ordered something else and sat at the bar for about half hour never asked if we wanted anything else. Finally got their attention and ordered appetizers chips and spinach dip and Shrimpers Net Catch (half n half) we got seated before appetizers came out. While being seated i asked for a glass if water and we ordered and waited about another 15-20 mins for my water and our appetizers which when we got them were cold and not good!! Our main meal we ordered Po Boy sandwiches, fish tacos and a Dixie Fishwich. The Po Boy i was looking forward too but when we got then they were not good!!

The kitchen was sooooo slow that day that we waited almost an hour for our food. My niece's food (something off the kids' menu) also came out later than the rest so she was getting really hungry and frustrated.\n\nAnyway, the main dishes were not good.

But this visit was extra special.  Our entire family was here.  We came to San Francisco to attend a Memorial and decided to make it a mini vacay and show the kids around since it will be their first time to see the State! Secondly, it was Father's Day! So, first my husband called to see if he could make a reservation of which they said they don't take any for the day due to the occasion and it is extremely busy. But nonetheless,  he was told its going to be a 30 minute wait for a group our size which is 6. That's fine.  we understand that.  so we left for Pier 39. When we got there, sure enough there was still a line of people trying to get in.  But we got our names on the list.  This time they told us it will be about 45-50 mins wait. Fine. We still wanted our kids to experience it, i.e. See the view,  taste the great food that we remembered etc... we walked around until we were called.  Finally, we got the text and off we went.  We waited for another 10mins before they seated us.  When they did,  we got a great corner view of the Bay and the Alcatraz. So that was a plus. We started choosing our food and drinks coz mind you it's been over an hour of wait already and we were starving. Our waiter David was extremely nice and funny.  He took our orders promptly. But, you can't blame him if the kitchen takes another hour to prepare it.  yes, that was how long it took for them to prep our order! we got our drinks first though.  my 2 kids got this Strawberry Mango Icee drink and they said it was extremely sugared down. It would kill a diabetic right there and then.  They had to ask for an Extra glass of water to water it down. at least i was happy with my drink and it was a virgin pina colada. David kept on coming back to update us on our order which was extremely nice of him.  When the orders finally arrived,  this was the first thing that i noticed.  #1- the food DID NOT look the same as the photos on their menu. it was like night and day. lol. seriously i had to snicker. But embarrassed because we bragged to our kids how amazing this restaurant was.  my dish for example,  i got the Accidental Fish & Shrimp dish. You will find a photo of the fish that i took from my dish that i couldn't even eat because they forgot to literally season it! Yes! As a foodie,  that's like a big No!No! i took a bite off that fish and was like,  what the heck! nothing! bland.. plain, no sparks.. tasted like literally nothing! i even tried to season it with salt, yet nothing.  you know,  sometimes, even fresh fish has a little sweet taste even if you forget to season it, but this one had nothing! i truly wonder how commercial and cheap are their choice of ingredients like their seafood that they use that i literally got nothing,  ZILCH! David at this point had to go already,  he was off his shift and Travis took over.  So we told him about it so he can relay it to the kitchen.  My son,  ordered the Jambalaya and this kid loves food.  We call him the food disposal. Everything that we dont finish,  he gobbles it up.  But he sat there and his eyes were watery and i asked him if something was wrong.  He said his dish was extremely hot and spicey. He asked if he could get some sour cream to tone it down.  so we did while relaying the problem to Travis. I mean,  obviously there's a big problem but this restaurant was not offering anything to rectify it.  It took Travis another 10 mins to get that sour cream.  seriously! He had to deal with it.  my daughter wanted to try his dish and took a bite and she literally said she didn't like it! liver and over! We finally asked for our bill, they didn't take out any of the dishes to fix the complaints, nothing. they didn't apologize for it. what can i do? but I'll tell you this,  even if it's a special occasion and it is busy,  they still need to maintain their quality or they'll start losing customers. because I'll tell you this,  after this experience,  i don't think I'd want to come back nor would i recommend this restaurant to anyone. I didn't make a fuss there because we've overstayed already.  didn't want to waste our time at Bubba Gump when there's so much to show the kids at the wharf. After 2 hours of waiting, literally another hour dining,  you'd expect something awesome.  instead we get something below average.  That's disappointing. don't you think?  they get 1 star for the view another star for David's service.  if it weren't for those 2, they wouldn't get any! literally!", "author": "Cynthia G."}

I suggested that we rest our weary legs and eat at Bubba Gump's because I had heard of this place for ages and had always wanted to try it. Even though I don't normally follow the \"touristy\" path, I thought it would only be appropriate considering today's earlier event. \n\nMy impression was that it looked and felt a mixture between TGI Friday's and Joe's Crab Shack... but with a nice view of the Bay. We were there on a Monday at about 5:45, and it wasn't crowded at all. We left at almost 7:00 and it was still relatively empty. \n\nOur cute female server was very exuberant (to the point of being quite infectious) and spoke loudly and clearly. I don't think I've ever been served by someone so personable and energetic and with a voice that simply boomed.  I'm sure anyone would agree that these are desirable qualities for a place like this, where there are regularly a lot of tourists and where it can get loud and crowded. And they are even more desirable when you consider that they make an announcement and sing to you if you mention that it's your birthday. \n\nInstead of flagging down a worker when you needed something, you flipped your sign located on your table: the blue \"Run Forest Run\" license plate meant that you were good, while the red \"Run Forest Run\" license plate meant that you needed something. I had flipped the sign at some point, and a worker came by quickly. I was wondering why and how he read my mind, and he said that the sign was red. I had completely forgotten all about the sign.\n\nThe food portions aren't large like, say, at BJ's or Claim Jumpers. The garlic bread was more like a long stick of bread rather than the usual oval shape and was soft and very buttery/oily. I had the Bourbon Street Mahi Mahi (charbroiled Cajun-spiced Mahi Mahi with Bourbon sauce, grilled shrimp, thin fries, served over mashed potatoes) and the Shrimp Shack Mac & Cheese (macaroni with sauteed shrimp, cheddar, Monterey Jack, and Parmesan cheese, topped with bread crumbs). Food was served quickly and presentation was very nice. I especially enjoyed the creamy sauce that came with the mahi mahi and the smooth mixture of cheeses in the mac & cheese. I just wish they included more shrimp or even bigger pieces of shrimp (I know, I know... Not a realistic expectation).\n\nBeing a restaurant chain located in a touristy part of San Francisco, you can expect the food and beverages to cost a pretty penny.

Made eye contact with the bartender and a few of the wait-staff. Nothing. Then, finally, a manager walks out of the office (next to the restrooms) with another employee, seemingly just wrapping up a meeting of sorts and I'm greeted. He doesn't show me to a table, just acknowledges my presence, and that someone will \"be by shortly to seat you\" (in the nearly nearly empty restaurant). \n\nThe meal was as I've grown to expect from Bubba Gump (another reason why I can't stop coming here!) The strawberry shortcake is a MUST-TRY if you're eating here. If you're deciding between an appetizer, or the shortcake: skip the former and go for the dessert!\n\nNearing the end of the meal, I'm offered the Landry's membership which I told the wait-staff that I was already a member. The tune changed a bit and more attention was given to our table (although the place had already closed at 11:00 PM). \n\nOn our way out (into the rain & cold), the hostess at the host-stand said \"good night\" without looking up from her clipboard. I know it's closed and I'm sure she wanted to get out of there as soon as possible, but service could definitely use a boost here. \n\nTo be completely fair, my interactions with the staff were generally positive. They were friendly and courteous, and perhaps I shouldn't be so picky? I did not feel like I was \"mistreated\" in any way, but I just didn't feel welcomed in any way. \n\nI guess (maybe) I'll wait a few months and give them another try? There are other Landry's places down at Fisherman's wharf too...", "author": "Charles K."}

I was seated with my boyfriend and asked what we wanted. So we placed our drink order and as we did I explained that we would like separate tabs. (we split all our bills and vacations in half.) I had explained a second time to the waitress that we would like them in separate tabs and she acted as if she understood. She then continued to ignore us and walked past a few times (even though I had the sign flipped) without asking if we needed anything. The other servers were more helpful for us than she was. I get that everyone has off days but when you're blatantly ignoring your customers and just standing around talking, there is an issue. It got to the point where one of the other waitresses had to tell her and her friend to stop standing around talking. I had half a mind to just ask for a different server! It then took about 20 mins to get the check and again it was a different waitress who brought it.... And it was all in the same tab. So I asked our waitress to separate it and she said yes and then continued to come back twice and ask what was separated . all I wanted was my food and my boyfriend's food separated and it turned into a big ordeal because of the fact that she didn't even know what orders we placed (because she ignored us so another waitress helped us) and she didn't ever check back. It was frustrating to say the least that if she would have just done her job it would have been more pleasurable and not such a long wait just to get a check. Every other experience here has been great. It really all depends on who you get.", "author": "Rachel P."}

What makes BGS unique (when I first visited) was the Forrest Gump theme but over time, they are catering to the sports fan more then the movie fans. The service has improved since my last visit, from being completely ignored ON MY BIRTHDAY. Last year I put my name on the waiting list. They told us it would take 30min wait. After waiting an hour, I checked back and found out someone had scratched out my name off of the list. I had a rotten night. All I wanted to do was go home but hubbgy insisted that we drove 1hr away just to eat here to just make the best of it.

One thing that did kind of bother me that might not bother others (hence why I didn't count it against them) was how constant the service would check up on us. We were clearly in the middle of a very tense conversation, but I'm not sure if the waitresses could tell because they kept checking on us every 2 minutes. That was a bit of a bother at least for us, but I'm sure most people would probably appreciate it. \n\nAnywho, I'd still recommend it.

Stick to the dishes they are most famous for. For dessert I ordered the dessert sampler which wasn't bad. I enjoyed the cookie brownie portion of it the most.

The coconut shrimp, especially the Tangy Asian dipping sauce, was probably my favorite part of the platter. \n\nA friend got the \"I'm Stuffed!\" Shrimp, which was probably the best dish on the table. The crab stuffing tasted wonderful and was the centerpiece of the dish. Another friend got the Accidental Fish and Shrimp, which was okay. The lemon was a little strong so you got a strong taste of acid and salt with the dish, which put me off a little bit. The other two shared a jambalaya and traditional shrimp cocktail. The jambalaya wasn't the best I've tasted, but it wasn't terrible either. The shrimp cocktail was a normal cocktail. Although, I must say that the cocktail sauce was pretty top notch. \n\nOverall, the food was okay. Nothing really had a big wow-factor except maybe the crab stuffing. The price was pretty high, but I would expect that for a seafood restaurant; however, I wouldn't be surprised if it was a little higher due to its ability to draw in tourists. \n\nWould I recommend?

She tapped the table when we didn't respond quickly and said I'll be back and yes she was back within two minutes. I asked about two dishes and this is when I was informed of the dish that cooks the quickest. I ordered the shrimpers net, I think that's the correct name and a side of fries.

Ended up walking down the pier to the wharf all the way. Long walk but I was new here so no worries.\n\nThe wait was one hour and 15 minutes. Now some people will give low reviews based on that.

The only reason I didn't rate a 5 was because I have had the Cajun fried chicken from Razzoo's which tops pretty much any chicken friend chicken breast meal based on the seasoning of the chicken.

If you're a fan of Forest Gump I'd highly recommend coming here. The entire place is decorated with movie memorabilia & references. On the walls you can see different license plates, shrimp posters and snapshots of different scenes from the movie. The view in this restaurant is also unbeatable. You overlook the ocean & can see the port of sailboats. I tried Shrimper's Heaven for $22 & thought that it was super tasty. It came with tempura shrimp, grilled shrimp, coconut shrimp & regular battered shrimp on a bed of fries. It came with 3 dipping sauces that included an orange marmalade type dip, cocktail sauce & a sweet dijon style dip. We had a super bubbly & fun waitress who was attentive when we turned over our \"run forest run\" sign to \"stop forest.\" I like how the drink menu is on a ping pong paddle & how there are movie quotes on the table. I also tried the chocolate root beer float with vanilla vodka. It wasn't as large as I expected it to be nor was it as boozy as I expected it to be but it was very tasty nevertheless. It was made with IBC root beer which is 1 of my favorites. The wait here can be long sometimes but they take down your phone number & text you when your table is ready.

It wasn't until our actual server returned to discuss our dessert options that we finally got that refill.

However, it has been a good 5 or 6 years since we've dined here.\n\nThat being said, if you haven't seen the movie...or worse yet, don't even LIKE the movie....then don't waste your time here.  1/2 the fun of this place is the Forrest Gump-y-ness.  \n\nWe came mid week for lunch. Perfect timing. Seated right away by the window looking out over the bay toward Alcatraz. It was beattiful. Service was attentive & friendly from the get go. Not pushy or overbearing in the least.\n\nThey've got a great thing going with the blue \"run Forrest run\" or \"stop Forrest stop\" signs at each table. We never had to use ours for \"stop\" but have no doubt any one of the abundant and helpful servers would have checked on us immediately upon seeing the red \"stop Forrest stop\". \n\nOrdered their freckled strawberry lemonade (in honor of my daughter who ALWAYS used to get that when we ate here and couldn't be with us this day). My wife had iced tea. It's a Pepsi place. \n\nFor starters, we had the cheesy artichoke spinach dip with a mountain of chips. It was very tasty. Nothing very unique to this place but delicious just the same.\n\nWe were delighted to see they brought back my wife's favorite dish...the shrimp shack pasta...which had been discontinued on our last visit but they were still happy to make for her.  It's a rather yummy shrimp & pasta dish with a light lemon & feta cheese flavor.  I admit to liking it very much too but always get my favorite: shrimp'in dip'in sauce....which has now been dropped from the menu.  No worries, I went for the New Orleans shrimp with jasmine rice. It's very similar to what I used to get and was still very good. I wasn't overly disappointed.  Next time I want to try the Cajun one with shrimp and andouille sausage.  \n\nNo dessert for us this time. Too full.  \n\nIn conclusion, it's probably not the best seafood there is, but what they do...they do right. Pricing is on par with any of the touristy SF restaurants in this area. No sticker shock here. Didn't feel like we got a screaming deal, but we certainly didn't feel raped. Since we went for lunch on a weekday, it wasn't crowded and we certainly didn't feel rushed.\n\nWe are glad we went.

After almost 2 hours they told us that there's no guarantee to seat us. And if we were called, we'd have to wait in another line for over 30 minutes in order to be seated.

Two of our party ordered chicken strips and received two tiny strips and barely a palm full of fries, with jello and a paper tugboat carrier.

She walked away and had to come back before she realized she'd gotten it wrong.

The bar area was open! Waited only 10 mins, table wasn't literally in the bar. Table was tall for my short mom to get up to, but anything to NOT wait for too long.\n\nSTOP FORREST STOP! Yes! Got waiter Jose to stop!\n- Forget Me Not Blueberry drink was delicious. Yes, this would do since I wasn't allowed an alcoholic beverage.\n- BUBBA'S FAR OUT DIP - An artichoke dip. On the greasy end, but it was free!! (If you check into Fisherman's Wharf or Pier 39 you get coupons for activities and restaurants).\n\nRUN FORREST RUN!\nSTOP FORREST STOP!\n- FISH AND CHIPS was huge in portion. Slices of fish were SO FRESH and so soft! Not even oily, it was perfect, once bite and it just slipped into your mouth with a rich fish flavor. Not sure what kind of fish it was. Fries were average. The fish was shining here over the chips. \n\nOn to Jenny's Catch!\n- SALMON & VEGGIE SKILLET was absolutely tasty! You could taste the garlic that the asparagus was sauteed in. If you're price conscious, as some have said it's pricey $20, but was rich in flavor. \n\nWill come back to try the rest of the menu.", "author": "Christine F."}

What wasn't fine is the waitress suggesting my 2 kids get their seasonal watermelon lemonade and charging $1.00 for each refill. I guess that may be expected in a touristy restaurant but the original lemonades cost $9.00 each. So, I basically paid over $20 for 2 kid drinks (prices are not on the menus so make sure you ask what everything costs). I did share my disappointment in a very nice manner. Had she taken just 1 of those drinks off I would have given her the typical 20% tip I normally give servers (even when the service isn't great but I reward great attitudes). Instead, she gave me a really pathetic whiny \"I'm sorry\" and charged me full price. I paid $107 for me and my 2 kids - total rip off. If I had tipped it would have been just around $120.

She loves the movie and when the waiter did the trivia.... she knew almost every answer!  She's 9!  \n\nWe had a party of 8 people and seated by the window.  Service was really good!  Especially since hubby and I came later than the rest.  The kiddies got a their cute kid meals in a Jenny boat.  But neice didn't want her in a kiddie boat.  Eh, no problem. lol  We ordered so much food it was overwhelming.   All I remember was hubby ordered a seasfood salad and a cup of chowdah.  he liked it.  I ordered a bowl of bisque and a side salad.  YUMMY.  Better than expected.\n\nI told the waiter it was neice's birthday.  So when time came they brought it to attention to the WHOLE restaurant by screaming out it was her birthday.  made her stand on a chair and then proceeded to sing her happy Birthday!  She LOVED the attention and ate it all up!   That was really great.  \n\nSo based on the service, the birthday girl being over the moon happy brought up the average eh, of their food to 4 stars!

I went to the one in LA and I must say that place was way better than this one here in SF. The one in LA gave us those trivial questions about Forest Gump but not this place I guess it's Cuz it's too crowded for them to do so but if that was the reason then that's super lame. Anyways the crab stuffed mushroom appetizer was great...a little bit on the salty side but it was yummy nonetheless...same goes with our side order of fries...salty but still ok I just wished they went easier on the seasoning. My pear & berry salad entr\u00e9e was alright but I'll definitely won't be ordering that again next time. The accidental fish & shrimp entr\u00e9e was probably the best one out of everything tonight because of the Jasmine rice.

Nothing was exceptionally good, but the food wasn't bad either. We came in a little after they opened, so there was no wait. I recommend you do that; when we were finished around 1230 or so, there was a wait to be seated. I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy, and the popcorn shrimp was surprisingly done quite well! There was a nice crisp to it. I also got an order of clam chowder because I just love soup.\n\nOverall it was a pleasant experience. The servers were all really friendly, and they periodically came around to make sure everyone had their fair share of refilled water.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-27", "description": "I was totally disappointed by not only our food but our service. We got to Bubba Gump's kind of early (11:30am) to avoid the crowd. We were seated quite quickly considering we had a party of 6. We asked for a table on the side of the restaurant that allowed us to see the water & it would have been perfect had it not been by far the worst spot in the restaurant. We sat three by three and unfortunately one of us (me) had to literally sit against a huge column. I couldn't move to the left or right to avoid it.\nOur waiter came to check on us fairly quickly and took our drink order. It took awhile for him to come back with our drinks and to see if we were ready to order. The first time, we were not ready. We asked if he could come back in a few minutes. About 10-15 minutes went by before he came back. We ordered our food but it was a process. There was a clear language barrier between us and our waiter as he didn't understand what we were saying. For example, my son likes to eat his hamburger dry (no ketchup/mustard) with just pickles. When we asked for a hamburger, dry, cooked well, with pickles only; he asked us more than once if we just wanted a bun with pickles. He kept saying \"you no want any meat?\" It took several tries for us to get our point across but we finally did (well, until my son's order arrived and it was just a hamburger with a bun). We had to ask another server to please bring us a side of pickles. \nMy husband and I always order the same thing; shrimp po'boy sandwich and fish and chips. My husband's sandwich looked great. My fish and chips looked great but did not taste that way. There was very little fish in my fish and chips. It was mainly overcooked batter. And, there were very few chips (and some of them were so burnt that I couldn't even eat them). I was really disappointed. I had also asked for a side of lemon and all of the slices were full of seeds. I kept having to pick the seeds out of my food. \nThankfully my parents enjoyed their food. My Mom said the clam chowder was really good and my Dad liked his shrimp trio. \nI was very surprised that the kids meal did not come with a drink. My son had ordered milk and the second time he went to pick it up, he grabbed it by the lid and since it was a soda lid, it came right off and he spilled half of it on the floor. Our waiter was great with helping me wipe it up. We asked for a second milk (only filled half way) and I was very surprised to see that they charged us for the second milk. \nOur lunch was expensive, the staff were rushed and rude. We put out our, stop forrest stop sign, waited several minutes as 6 to 7 people walked by and didn't stop to have a young lady rudely ask us \"do you need something?\" Um, yes. That is why we put up the, stop forrest stop sign. \nThis was by far the worst experience we have had at this location. I am disappointed to say that we will most likely not eat here again. That makes me kind of sad because it has been a tradition for the last few years to eat here every time we visited Pier 39.", "author": "Casey A."}

However, the pricing was probably twice as much.\n\nThen again, its either Bubba Gump's at Pier 39 or you'll end up staring at another Eric Clapton autographed guitar at the Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nOn a positive note, they did have an actor playing Forrest Gump sitting on the bench in front of the restaurant.

Later when asked what sauces came with our shrimp not a single person could answer. Not a manager or even the cooks! Who doesn't know what sauces/dips they are serving?! \nIt took over 45 minutes to even get our drinks! They were unable to even bring our small child her chocolate milk. When the drinks finally arrived the cups were covered in spilled drinks and we could tell they had been sitting around a while. The foam from the blended drinks was gone. The milk was super cold.\nWe said no appetizers but she later asked if we wanted garlic bread. Thinking it was part of the meal after such a long wait we accepted. On the bill we were charged almost $6 for two pieces of bread with garlic butter.\nWhen our server went on \"mandatory break\" we got a very nice and knowledgeable server Stephen. We enjoyed him and made the extra star on our review.\nWe planned on leaving him a big tip even after the  initial experience but he said it goes to the first server. No thanks. She was awful.\nWhen we were leaving we found that my wheel chair was covered in spilled sweet drink the server for another table spilled.

I knew I wanted clam chowder so being in Fisherman's Wharf, there were plenty of spots to eat chowder. We were already in Pier 39 so we decided to pick Bubba Gump's since we both have never eaten here before. The wait for a table wasn't so bad. Very crowded of course, since it was a Saturday. Beautiful views of the bay although we didn't get seated by the window but I'm not picky about where I sit. Ordered the Run Forrest Run smoothie which was very yummy. Had to order a cup of Clam Chowder but in my opinion, it could've been a little bit more thicker in consistency. It isn't the best but it was ok. Also had the Calamari with bell peppers & pepperoncini (both I dislike very much). Didn't know it was going to be breaded & deep fried along with the calamari so I had to pick my way through it. (I'm a pro picker btw) My other half ordered the Dixie Fishwich in which he said was very good & I had the Shrimp Stack Pasta. The portions were large so that's a plus. My entree was tasty and I like that they put enough numbers of shrimp in my dish. \n\nPlaying the Forrest Gump triva quiz was fun to play.

Clam chowder was OK, only half as good as Boudin's. Caesar salad was perfect! Crispy clean, green romaine with parm and a tangy sauce. Cajun shrimp was very cold, and somewhat translucent (not cooked all the way). Tempura shrimp had a very thick coating like fried chicken, but without the yummy fried chicken flavor. Coconut shrimp was hard, not mouth friendly. The sauces that accompanied the shrimp combo were less than stellar. Stick to the cocktail sauce.\n\nOur server was Mitch, and he was friendly, quick, polite, and enthusiastic about Forrest Gump the movie, and had a great sense of humor.\n\nSurprise! Georgia tea came with a a free souvenir masonjar/wineglass -- pretty cool, heavy glass, made in China, looks kind of hillbilly and mountainman chic.

I came back to the bay area to visit and parents know that I love SF, so they decide to have a family lunch in the city. Sweet thought, but bad execution. My parents heard of this place while walking the pier and connected it with the movie, so it was automatically awesome. I thought place is tacky and the food ridiculously overpriced. \n\nShrimp Po Boy - The bread was tough and tasted almost stale. The shrimp had a really think bread coating and was dry. The fries that it came with were boring and tasted like McDonald's fries.\n\nSeafood Feast - Basically everything (the fish&chips, the shrimp and the hushpuppies) were oily on the outside and dried out on the inside.\n\nCrab - Small pieces of crab with a mediocre sauce\n\nCoconut Shrimp - Again, the shrimp was dried out. The coconut coating had a odd bitter aftertaste. Almost brunt maybe? And you only got like 5 shrimp. For almost $20? Rip off.\n\nCalm Chowder - Decent chowder that isn't super expensive. Its basically the only thing here that I might get again, but being at the pier in SF, you can get way better chowder elsewhere.\n\nTo be fair to our server, he was really nice and attentive.

Yesterday, my bf and I finished out trip to Alcatraz Island and wanted to eat well. It was 2 PM on a Sunday so we were hoping that there wasn't too long a wait. We were warmly greeted and they took our names, infoming us that the wait would be anywhere between 5-15 minutes long. We used the restrooms and walked around for a bit and were called to our tables in about 5 minutes (pretty fast). We requested prior to seating that we get a window seat of the bay and they gladly sat us at a small table near the window.\n\nOur waitress was super hyper and excited to give us the day's picks and her suggestions. We ordered the cajun shrimp appetizer which was pretty decent but I wished they gave us more garlic bread. SO GOOD. \n\nThe menu had so many options and I honestly could have picked anything from their menu. Everything looked enticing! I finally decided on the Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp which consisted of \"Large chargrilled Shrimp and Andouille Sausage with Mashed Potatoes and Bourbon Sauce! 18.29\". My bf ordered the \"Shrimp Chimichurri Skewers\" which included \"Tender Shrimp with fresh Red Bell Peppers, Red Onion, Yellow Squash and Zucchini, chargrilled, served over Jasmine Rice with a Chimichurri sauce of fresh herbs, olive oil, black pepper, and\ncrushed red chilies. 18.29\". Both picks were great choices and I liked that their portions weren't too big and out of control.\n\nMy shrimp and sausage was absolutely perfect. The mashed potatoes were delicious and complimented the entire dish well. I liked that touch of bourbon sauce as well. My bf also enjoyed his skewers and I even got sample a bit of his!

I really liked how they take your cell phone number and will text you when the table is ready. We were able to continue to walk around the pier and do some shopping while we waited. I was excited to see that after only 20 minutes I received a text message saying that a table is ready. We got a table shortly thereafter. \n\n2) Waitstaff: although they were extremely busy, the waitstaff was consistently courteous and very helpful. When we put up the sign that said \"Stop Forest Stop\", servers would stop to see if there was something they could do for us, even if it was not their table.\n\nCons:\nAfter we ordered our food, it took 45 minutes for the meals to be delivered. Fortunately, we ordered an appetizer during that time, otherwise, we might have been extremely cranky by the time our food got there. Unfortunately, when we received our meals, one of the dishes was incorrect. The wait staff was extremely helpful and courteous when it came to fixing the meal, but it took another 45 minutes for the one dish to come out of the kitchen. In the meantime that person just had stuff off of everybody else's plate. When we finally received the correct meal for that person, we ask for it to be put into a to-go box so that we could head out to our next event. By the time we had received our check, it had been two hours from when we first walked into the door to be seated. I have to complement the staff and management because when we received our check they had charged us for the incorrect meal and for the corrected meal. I mentioned it to the server and the manager took the incorrect meal off of our ticket and then comped us our corrected meal, as well. \n\nConclusion:\nI've been to this franchise all over the US and Hawaii, but this experience will not necessarily sway me from avoiding it. I plan on going back to this restaurant in the future. Like I said, I hope it was just a bad day. If you have not yet been to this restaurant, the food taste good, the atmosphere is exciting, and I've never had a problem with the waitstaff at any of the restaurants.

Got there around noonish, only had to wait about 10-15 mins, so that was definitely a plus. \n\nCame here with my mom and brother. Walking in, I felt like I was on a ship or something. The walls were decorated with all sorts of sayings and slogans from the movie \"Forrest Gump.\" We were seated near the area where you could look out the windows into the pier and ocean. The service was superb. I really liked the \"Run, Forrest, Run\" and \"Stop, Forrest, Stop\" signs that they used to tell if their service is needed or not. \n\nWe ordered:\n- \"Shrimper's Heaven\";  consisted of 4 diff cones of Coconut Fried Shrimp, Cocktail Shrimp, Tempura Shrimp, and French Fries. Very tasty. Great sampler dish of shrimp. \n-\"Shrimper's Net Catch\";   reminded me of Boiling Crab's boiled shrimp. We got the garlic flavor since I wasn't sure if my mom could handle cajun spice. It was pretty good; though I wished it had more flavor, maybe will try the Cajun flavor next time. \n-\"Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp\";   this was by far the fanciest. I believe the shrimp was sauteed with diff seasonings, paired with sausage and mashed potatoes. Mmm the sauce was divine.. \n-\"Mango Sparkler\";   i think the orange juice overpowered the mango, there wasn't much mango taste to it. but it was still pretty good. \n\nBeing along the pier, definitely came here in mind that the prices would be on the higher end. Despite that, it was an enjoyable meal with great company and atmosphere. Would definitely want to come back here.", "author": "Diana L."}

This visit was different, as I was bringing my teen age kids in for their first time.  We were celebrating my sons birthday and chose here since Forrest Gump is his favorite movie.  \n\nIt was a Thursday night at 845 when we finally arrived after a long flight, checking in at hotel and taking the trolley to the pier.  I asked the hostess for the best \"Forrest Trivia server\" in the house and explained the favorite movie and we wanted to challenge my son.  Her response was \"all of our servers are great, just give me a few minutes\".  After 10 minutes, we were called to be seated and followed the hostess past 5 empty booths to a 10 top in the back of the place.  Considering we were only a party of 3, I assumed this server must be really good if they were putting us in such a huge table.  Boy, were we wrong.\n\nWe met our server after a few moments and gave our beverage order, received our drinks and then gave our food order.  That was pretty much it for seeing our server the rest of the night.  Our food was delivered by a runner, Room temperature at best and after almost nothing being eaten, our server finally returned, didnt seem to care how things were and delivered the check.  Furious and disappointed, I put cash down and went in search of a manager.\n\nI was greeted at the front door by the same cheery hostess who asked how it was and I shook my head holding back tears, stepped outside to cool off, came back in and asked for a manager.  I was not surprised that the manager was less than shocked by what was said and how we were treated.  Basically, I got the \"wow, I have never had a complaint and not sure why that happened, come back and see us next time you are in town\" kind of answer.  \n\nI understand \"theme\" restraunts, however, SF/pier 39 is a tourist attraction and they should really keep that in mind.", "author": "Jen M."}

Every entree is at least $15 and can go up to around $30 for very small entrees. Even then, we continued to go because we loved the Forrest Gump movie and we usually had good waiters. That was until our last visit.\n\nWe went to have dinner here a few days ago to celebrate a birthday. As soon as we sat down we told our waitress that we were celebrating a birthday. She sad happy birthday and went about taking our drink orders. We ordered our drinks and our food and waited. While we waited for our food, we saw the employees go to two other tables and sing happy birthday and deliver a dessert to the birthday person.\n\nAfter waiting about 20 minutes, our food finally came out. It turned out that the kitchen ran out of certain types of pasta, so they replaced it with other types of pasta without informing us. 3 of our pastas were supposed to come with linguine, but they were made with penne. Another one was supposed to have penne, but was made with elbow pasta. We asked to have it made properly, so they told us it would take about 10 minutes to make again. So we waited once again. About 20 minutes later, after waiting a total of about 40 minutes for our food, it finally comes out properly. \n\nWe ate, paid, and left. We were there for about 1.5 hours, and no one ever bothered to come sing a birthday song for our birthday person. Overall it was a disappointing birthday dinner.

It's primarily fried southern style food, although there are a few items on the menu that are somewhat healthy. If you have Celiac disease, they do have a couple of appetizers and entrees that are gluten free. \n            Anyways, on to the service: the service here is horrible.You can't make a reservation, and you can't even call ahead to put your name on the list. I came in and was told there was a 40 to 50 minute wait for a party of 4, so I gave my name to the host and took a seat outside. As I waited, the line got bigger and bigger and I began to notice that groups, both large and small, that had come after me were being taken before me. I asked the host about it, and she told me that some of the groups had a Landry's reward card (which costs 25 dollars) so they were able to get priority seating. The other groups were taken simply because they were \"large parties\" and were to be seated at  larger tables. \n            Once we were finally called by the host, we discovered we were amongst 5 other groups so, once again, we were taken out of order. We were instructed to go up a ramp to be seated and ended up waiting nearly 10 more minutes while the host managing the ramp, who was also responsible for cleaning silverware, told us that our table was being \"cleaned\" and attempted to make light conversation with us. Another 5 minutes passed despite there being a few clean tables in plain sight. I asked the host atop the ramp why my group still had to wait and he responded that he could not leave the area in fear of getting in trouble by the manager. He told us we would have to wait for the proper host to seat us. Moreover, I noticed the manager walk by multiple times...why he could not have seated us himself baffles me.\n            Once the host finally arrived, we were led to a table right next to the kitchen door and were told that a table closer to the window would be another 5-15 minute wait! Seeing as my family and I had come all the way from the United Arab Emirates, I accepted his offer to wait. 10 minutes later, we were finally taken to our table -- I must admit that it was a great table with a wonderful view of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. Once we were sat down, our experience became somewhat better because our server was nice and the idea of a stop sign was very helpful. We ordered our drinks and some appetizers and shortly after ordered our entrees. Like I said in the beginning of this lengthy review, the food was sub-par and the \"Shrimper's Heaven\" that I ordered was pretty much just overpriced, fried shrimp with poorly cooked french fries. \n              On a better note, our server came back shortly to check on us and also asked if we would like to play \"Forrest Gump Trivia.\" Her assistance was nice and that trivia turned out to be a fun experience. Upon finishing our food, we turned our license plate to \"Stop, Forrest, Stop!\" which is intended to signal to a server that you are in need of help. I tried to make eye contact with a server multiple times but was unable to reach success due to 3-4 servers standing in the corner having a swell time and 2 managers standing by the computer laughing away. \n              At last, we received our absurdly expensive ($100+) bill and with no more satisfaction left to sacrifice, simply got up and left.", "author": "Abdul-Hakim H."}

It amazes me that this place is still in business. \n\nSo my family decided to take a trip down to the pier for a nice day out on the water. We chose Bubba Gump's because we all love shrimp and the movie Forest Gump. I go inside to ask about the wait, firstly the hostess completely ignored me and continued to communicate with whoever she was talking to on her walkie.  I politely waited and finally gained her attention. I put my name down and quoted a 50-60min wait. Ok, I understand it's Memorial Day weekend so of course I'm going to have to wait a while. Before I forget I told her I had a party of 8. So we waited outside and forty minutes later I went  back inside to check in to see how much longer my wait would be. She said gather your party and we can seat you in about 15 Minutes. We waited another 20 minutes and finally I heard a strange name on the intercom \"jessy party of 8, Jessy party of 8\" I looked at my mom and she said, \"does she mean CHELSEA?\" Then she repeats back, \"I mean Chelsea, party of 8\" followed by a chuckle. Seriously? \n\nThen we are directed to this table that has 7 chairs and a high chair all crammed together. There is no way 8 people can fit comfortably in this location. We notify a manager that we need a bigger table. She looks displeased and I swear to you, she sighs and tells us she will find something else. Another male manager comes up to us and says to sit at a nearby booth until something comes available. The table we are supposed to be moved to has other people just sitting there staring at each other. They are obviously done but just wasting precious time doing absolutely nothing. Finally they leave and we are seated, we wait another 15mins until we are greeted by a random server by him saying, \"hold on I'll be with you in a second\" wtf? Then this same server and another server stand over our table arguing no out who will take our table. They were seriously  conversing with each other for 10 minutes while we confusingly look at them with blank stares on our faces. At this point I can't even begin to fathom what is happening. The other server finally introduces himself, and serves us. \n\nAll in all, the food is way too overpriced, mediocre at best, it's extremely loud, elbow to elbow, and all around a hot mess. The managers were confused, the servers were confused, even the busters were confused. I will never spend my money here ever again.

However, as I do quite love seafood I was more than happy to go.\n\nSince it's at Fisherman's Wharf, it's perpetually busy.  The wait for our table of 8 was about an hour, just slightly longer than suggested.\n\nDeciding what to order will be difficult if you like shrimp and fish.  I went with the Mahi-Mahi and shrimp.  \n\nFirst minor disappointment was that the portion size in the photo was decidedly larger than what I actually got.  It also wasn't quite as warm as I might have liked, but having said that, it was quite good.  There were about 5 normal sized shrimp accompanying the mahi mahi along with mashed potatoes.  The highlight was the bourbon sauce, which I could have just eaten on top of a gigantic heap of mashed potatoes and been happy.\n\nThe speckled strawberry lemonade was good and had real strawberries, but also had way too much ice.  Refills also costed a buck, which is a little greedy considering you're paying four bucks already for the first ice-filled one.\n\nMy friend got what I almost did: the jambalaya.  I made the mistake of having a bite... and immediately wished I'd gotten that.  Mine was perfectly fine, mind you, but the jambalaya was creamy and spicy, and anyone who likes it knows that it's tough to find a truly outstanding one.\n\nOur waitress was friendly enough and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  They did a Forrest Gump trivia thing which our table did rather poorly at, I suppose to kill time, keep patrons busy and stay in theme.  And the view out the windows of the bay is pretty great, although we weren't sitting close to a window.\n\nThe coolest thing that BG's does in my opinion is having table signs that read \"Run Forrest Run\" or \"Stop Forrest Stop\".  This way your server can tell if you need them for something or not, preventing the common and annoying requirement of getting their attention.  More restaurants ought to copy this.  I'd love it if there was a third one, \"Pay Forrest Pay\" so they knew you're ready for the bill so you can go.  God knows trying to get the check after eating is probably one of the most common irritations at every restaurant I've been to.\n\nThe prices are probably what you'd expect.  You are unlikely to get out of here for under $20 a person, but considering that you're eating at a tourist trap and getting fresh seafood, it's a hit you can probably afford to take if you're already here and in the mood for shrimp/fish.  \n\nFood: A- \nService: A-\nValue: C-\n\nI'd come back if I was in the area.", "author": "Tony D."}

Kenzie at the bar offered me a mushroom Swiss burger with onions. I gladly accepted as this is one of my favorite types of burgers. The bun was greasy, you could taste that the grill needed to be cleaned, and it was super bland meat. No seasoning at all. Not even some simple salt and pepper. The burger was cooked medium rare like I asked but with no seasoning it wasn't all that great. The crazy amount of onions which were kinda greasy as well made it all worse.", "author": "John B."}

We were very lucky to get a small table that fit us just fine and had views of the water that seemed to go on forever. We got to watch boats pass by and just enjoy the atmosphere. Our food that day was amazing too - I ordered the Jambalaya which was so good but pretty spicy. I asked for a side of sour cream to tame the heat and it was perfect! Our server - Kendrick I believe his name was - was a very cute and very tall young man with curly hair and a pretty smile. He made sure that we were taken care of and I didn't have to ask for anything - he had it all under control. I know that this location can have some pretty heavy wait times but a lot of the time its worth it. Always keep in mind that a lot of places will have their hosts add time to the quoted wait times for every 5+ people that approach the stand wanting a table. (Example: wait list is at 5 people. The wait is 10 minutes. 5 more people come in and so they bump up the wait time to 15 minutes etc.) Since I know this I usually don't get tooo frustrated with quoted waits because usually its less than what I was told. In this case it was.  If you are willing to be patient and decide to wait it out for a table... its always worth the wait in most cases. I cannot recall one bad memory at this location.

I don't know if there's some kind of policy that doesn't allow employees to touch floors or something, but everyone except our waitress and the manager was so rude!

Our party was partially arrived and as soon as they sat down he was pressuring them for their order. Our food arrived and it was good overall, the peel away shrimp wasnt cleaned but everything else was pretty good. The night took a turn when we asked for a water refill, Sean decides to just grab one glass and fills it with water. When he gets back I ask him to please bring a pitcher so we can all get a refill. He comes to the table and just slams the pitcher down for us to pour it ourselves.

My bro-in-law hadn't arrived yet and the guy with the earpiece said we wouldn't be able to be seated until he gets there. My sister asked how long the wait would be. He whispered something into his headset and then said, \"It's our policy not to seat people until their whole party has arrived. \"  Umm, thank you for informing us of the policy, however that wasn't the question.  So my sister asks again, \"How long is the wait if we wait for my husband?\" So, Mr. Earpiece whispers into his headset again and then tells us again that it's restaurant policy to not seat parties until the whole group has arrived. Then he proceeds to tell us about large parties of 10 and more and how they have to wait for everyone to arrive. My sister asked him again how long the wait is and he whispers in his headset and then asks, \"Will you be ordering food?\" Well, there were 6 of us there, 3 kids and 3 adults.  I am pretty sure we wouldn't be sitting at the bar ordering drinks with 3 kids with us. So he finally gets the okay to let us in to our table. \n\nOur waitress was friendly. She was a little hard to hear because of the noise level in the restaurant. The Forrest Gump quiz was fun. The signs signaling when you need service are a great idea and whenever we flipped our sign for service, someone came over right away. However, towards the end of our meal, the manager rushed over with our bill to inform us they automatically included gratuity because we had more than 6 in our party. Well, considering 2 of our party were kids under age 3, I felt that was just a way of squeezing more money out of customers. I don't need a restaurant to calculate how much tip to leave for a server. What I choose to leave (or not leave) is my decision. For that reason, I took off 2 stars. \n\nSo minus 2 stars for an automatic gratuity of 18%, minus 1 star for the generic fast food and minus 1 star for the overpriced food and/or all food prices not being listed on the menu. Be careful when ordering. The prices for some of the smaller portions are listed on the menu, the larger portion prices are not. The saving grace of this place was the waitress who would have been well compensated even without the restaurant including gratuity in our bill. This is obviously a tourist trap and I will stay far away from this place next time I am in the City.", "author": "KiKi W."}

I am sad that we chose this place to eat, but hey.. When the Cheesecake Factory had an almost 2 hour wait on a Friday night we had to make do. Especially since we had my toddler with us. \n\nLet's start off by saying that the server was awesome. His name was Luke and I couldn't have asked for a better person to help us. \n\nHowever the food was GARBAGE !! I mean it literally made my whole table sick. We ordered the popcorn shrimp appetizer.. Yes on the menu it tells you it comes with pepperoncini's & roasted red bell peppers, but if it's called \"Best Ever Popcorn Shrimp\" I would expect way more shrimp. Every one I picked out was a pepper of some sort, so I gave up on that. \n\nNext I ordered \"...Of Course We Have Scampi!\", which I figured would be a safe choice and plus I love shrimp Scampi. Holy cow, when it got to the table and I took a bite all I tasted was lemon. Okay once again they listed it had lemon-garlic butter in the dish, but I didn't know I was ordering LEMON DRENCHED NOODLES with a few small pieces of shrimp. My boyfriend took a bite too and said there were too many capers in it. Either way I ate the few pieces of shrimp and left the rest. \n\nMy son got the kids pizza, (I chose for him obviously). Poor baby wanted nothing to do with the \"pizza\" they brought him. Let me tell you this kid can eat, but I can't blame him. That looked like cardboard with some cheese sprinkled on top. I could make a better pizza myself and I am no chef. Heck, he could probably make a better pizza and he isn't even 2 yet. \n\nMy mom ordered Bubba's After the Storm \"Bucket of Boat Trash\". She dug right in and ate a piece of shrimp and then started working on her lobster claw. She had no real complaints with hers but she didn't touch a single french fry either. I had one of her shrimp which was, eh.. just okay. Then I tried a piece of her fish, and I swear someone had it out for me that night because whatever they used to coat her fish tasted like dirt. No I can't say exactly what dirt tastes like, but that was the first thing that came to mind when I tasted it. She is the one who usually says something to the waiter but we told her not to tonight.\n\nLast my boyfriend orders the Fish & Chips. Just average. Nothing worth bragging about. His fries came out cold as well so they had to bring him new ones. The fish wasn't very crispy like I am used to when I order fish & chips, but at this point I ate three pieces of his because anything was better then the crap I got served. \n\nSo sorry to say, we will NEVER come back to this place. $105 tab for three adults and a child, I think not.

My husband ordered the fish tacos and my daughter ordered the traditional shimp cocktail. \n\nThe fish and chips were overcooked and tasted very fried and were greasy. I'll let my husband yelp his own experience regarding the fish tacos. He wasn't raving about it afterwards, though. \n\nI think my biggest complaint was that we were constantly interrupted despite the \"Run Forest Run\" sign displayed at our table. One of the servers even stopped, brought a chair and sat by our table to asked us trivia questions about the movie Forrest Gump. We participated to be polite, but at the time we were trying to have a family discussion about something. If we weren't having that conversation, perhaps I wouldn't have been so miffed by it. \n\nWe ended our dinner with the Alabama Mud Pie, which ended up to be a small ice cream cake. With mud pies, I'm used to tasting more peanut butter and caramel flavors. This one tasted more like vanilla ice cream with the idea of those elements. I would go back for the on a hot day, though, now that I know what to expect. \n\nI wouldn't eat a meal there unless someone else paid for it, and it wouldn't be my first recommendation choice for someone who wants to dine at Pier 39. If I do eat there again, I'll try the Shrimp Scampi. Who wants to take me? :)", "author": "Jenny S."}

Just slow service but it was packed in there and I received stale fries with my Forrest favorite but I got a new batch as the kitchen was closing and almost every customer was gone. So.... The freshly fried fries were so good. I had ordered forest #1 favorite and it was OK. I'm not a fan of their beer battered almost anything but I personally liked the hush puppies my sister didn't like them. I liked the first taste of the shrimp and fish strips but the after taste I didn't like. So overall I would definitely go here again never go by yourself this place is only good with other people. But they also play the movie over and over again for what ever reason. I get it but They should play other stuff like music videos and sports from that era. or even other movies from that time or about that time. But they seriously have like 20 TVs with the same movie.

I don't think any local in their right mind would actually pay so much for mediocre food. \n\nSince I'm not really into fried seafood (other than my beloved fish & chips), I feel like everything is too greasy for my liking. I've tried the Calamari, Popcorn Shrimp, Bubba's Far Out Dip, Captain's Fish & Chips, and Scampi. Everything tasted good, but occasionally had too much salt or batter/breading. Again, I wouldn't come here just for the food.\n\nAnyone who loves Forrest Gump has to go to Bubba Gump at least once in their lifetime (I predict that Bubba Gump will close down in 30 years because the movie will have become obsolete, and those who do know of it will be too old and die of blocked arteries the moment they breathe inside the restaurant.) They really play up the whole Forrest Gump theme with license plates, quotes, and other misc. memorabilia on tables and walls. They also loop the movie on their TV's, which I've always thought was a nice touch. Another thing they do really well is birthday celebrations - they make you stand on a chair and they scream/sing their little happy birthday song so everyone else can hear and join in.\n\nSince this one is located right at the Wharf (which is a prime tourist spot), the wait is always astronomical - and they don't take reservations! It's really noisy inside, and service is pretty slow because of all the people. I'm actually trying to avoid coming here again because 2-3 times is enough.", "author": "Katie M."}

It took over an hour to seat us which was expected as it was a Sunday around 5pm- I understand its busy on Sundays. After we are seated they take our orders. My mother and I both have fish allergies so we substituted it for more shrimp which we were told was fine. Of course they end up bringing out fish which my mom confused for chicken strips. Luckily we had some Benadryl to combat her reaction. We send it back and wait another probably 45 minutes to receive our meals. I never received mine (we ordered the same thing and they only ordered one over again)so I told the manager never mind. They forgot to place my daughters order so she waited an entire 2 hours to be fed. Everyone had eaten by the time she received her meal. The manager expressed his apologies but I will never come back as it was just way too disorganized and busy for me. The food is just ok anyways. I feel like for the amount you pay, you should receive much larger portions and appetizer portions. This is about my 3rd time coming here and each time the service is below par.

My friend wanted to go here because she had been to a Bubba Gump in Cancun and remembered the food as being good. After eating here she commented that the food was much better at the Cancun location. \n\nOur food was way too pricey for both the amount of food we got and the low quality of our food. For some reason I thought Bubba Gump was a company that had been around before the movie Forrest Gump came out, but apparently it was inspired by the movie instead. If you ask me they take the theme a bit too far and the final end effect is a very cheesy themed restaurant that puts more emphasis on the theme than the food. \n\nAt the end of the day, let's face it, a restaurant is about the food. While my service here was great, my server can't make up for the fact that I spent $20 on food I hated. Sorry Bubba but I won't be back.

We both love shrimp and I was more attracted to the girly drink menu than he was. \n\nWhen we first stepped in the restaurant, it reminded me of a bunch of other family friendly eateries. Staff is nice, memorabilia EVERYWHERE, solid food. \n\nWe ordered were both starving and started off with the Shrimper's Net Catch and Mama Gump's Garlic Bread Basket. We weren't sure which was better: the Cajun Spices or the Garlic Butter sauce. The nice waitress split the sauces for us. It's pretty hard to screw up shrimp and Bubba Gump's did an awesome job. The sauces weren't too salty and the garlic bread was available to mop up all the leftover saucey goodness. \n\nApparently our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because we both ordered entrees. I had the shrimp linguine and my guy ordered the Shrimper's Heaven. My pasta dish was delicious. Simple, not overdressed with sauce. My guy seemed to have enjoyed his mondo shrimp basket. \n\nThe only con: the portions! The hotel we were staying at didn't have a mini-fridge and I felt bad for leaving the 3/4 of my pasta dish behind. Moral of the story: come hungry and ready to eat. \n\nI've read some of the other reviews and had a hard time understanding why people were so bummed out about Bubba Gump's. Yes, it's going to be expensive because you're by the water. I honestly thought the prices were reasonable.

We stopped at the front and there were 3 employees talking to each other and laughing and didn't even acknowledge us. We saw a line so we thought we were supposed to stand in line until we were seated. After 45 minutes we got to the front and one of the employees brought a bunch of menus up and just dropped them in a trough like holder. It was loud and he acted like he didn't want to even be there. My husband and I thought that was rude. Then the gal asked how many was in our party and I said, \"Two.\"\nShe asked the name and I told her. I saw her looking for the name and I asked her if we were supposed to have a reservation. She said that we were supposed to tell them at the front. I told her about our experience up front. My husband and I left. When a company has a bunch of very young people working for them they need to tell them that the first impression starts with the employees at the front. The front staff needs to stop screwing off and pay attention to the customer. Maybe the other staff could at least pretend that they care about the customers and act like they want to work there because there are a lot of unemployed people that would gladly take their place.", "author": "Dameita S."}

We were about to leave when they finally seated us when here were more than 1/2 the restraunt filled with empty tables! \nThey either never put in my drink order or they forgot about it, we never saw our server until we were just about done eating and i told him i never got my drink but never mind on it because im done eating. He tried to offer it 1/2 priced. I was done eating! Why would i want to hang around and just drink my drink for 1/2 an hour? My boyfriends shrimp were not fully fried. and $17! for like 5 shrimp and a basket of fries?! jesus!\nThen there was a huge mixup with the bill where the waiter took the money i put towards the bill as tip and brought me a new bill!

When you arrive you will be given an approximate wait time, when your name is called it does not mean your table is ready, it means you have to come in from waiting and wait in line standing on a ramp for the staff to find a table for you as it becomes available, clean it and finally seat you down. Several names at a time are called at once to come into ramp area so this allowed 2 other parties that signed in way after me but were waiting closer to ramp to get ahead of me in line extending our wait time even more.  My family of 5 we were given an aproximate time of 30 minutes and we sat down at our table 1 hour 30 minutes later. People complain to staff right and left and managers walk around oblivious to their staff's attempt at resolving issues.

It was pretty cold, but we figured we would wait (outside because there is nowhere to wait inside). I checked back about an hour into the wait and was told just ten more minutes. After two hours and repeating the just 10-15 more minutes thing twice more, they finally sent the text. If we would have known it was  going to be that long we would have gone somewhere else. On our way in we grabbed a booster and a high chair, yes we grabbed them because the staff didn't offer to do so.  When we got to our table it couldn't accommodate a high chair. The hostess said if we wanted to wait she could get us another table, but we had another place to be and didn't think we could wait another hour with a two-year-old.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-04-26", "description": "Here I am, on Pier 39 during one of those rare moments when my whole family can get together to visit me in San Francisco, looking for somewhere to just get a beer. We're not picky people, all we want is a beer with a decent view, so somehow we ended up at Bubba Gump. The idea was great, the experience was terrible. Here's the main points:L\n\n1). First impressions really do matter. When we got there, there was some serious mis-communication going on between our group and the wait staff to grab a table. At first it looked like we were going to be by the window - perfect! The waiter walked over, there was a perfect table to fit 8 right there being cleaned up, but no... no no... you have to go forward to the \"stop forest, stop\" sign first, something completely unclear to us. I recognize that perhaps there was a moment of confusion, but this first impression set the tone for the rest of our experience.\n\n2). Hidden costs. We got 1 fancy cock-tail (which was actually ok), which comes with a free glass, and 6 large beers, served in the same glasses which you have a hidden fee- you're buying those glasses. Again, miscommunication by the wait staff; it isn't clear to us whether ordering these you're buying the glass or not. We did get this cleared up, and saved $28 bucks on glasses by not taking them home (through talking with the manager).\n\n3). Shrimp was mediocre at best. I thought I'd be getting super fresh tasting, delicious shrimp, since it is Bubba Gump SHRIMP Co. It wasn't fresh, the flavors were far from bold or exciting, we didn't even finish the plate (and as 8 people sharing, thats a pretty big deal).\n\nConclusions: I have nothing against chains, there are some that I really enjoy, but this just isn't one of them. Forrest Gump, great movie, Bubba Gump, terrible restaurant. I'll be doing my best to never return.", "author": "Phil C."}

People were waiting for their table and we were told 20 minutes for our table.  We were pretty hungry and weren't in need of a view by the window so we went to the bar section and sat at one of the open table.

It comes with a take home 'Logo Hurricane' souvenir glass.  The souvenir glass itself is $7.99 online, hehe... so basically you're paying $2 for the drink.  Even lemonade costs $3.95.  WHAT A DEAL!!!  Here's how it work - When you're done with your drink, you leave the dirty glass on the table.  Take the receipt to the shop across from the restaurant entrance, show them the receipt and they will give you a brand new, wrapped 'Logo Hurricane' glass to take home.  Sweet deal or what?  =)\n\nBOAT TRASH ($18.99) - I recommend this one.  It has deep-fried shrimps, slipper lobsters, and mahi mahi dusted with cajun spices and served with fries.

First off, if you're a fan of the film Forest Gump, then you're certainly going to enjoy this place. Everything in the restaurant is themed toward the movie. Everything from memorabilia replicas, a 24/hr loop of the film, a gift shop, food names, and even a daily film quiz competition against you and the table next to you. Because of the popularity of the film and restaurant, expect the place to constantly be busy. It is definitely a tourist spot, which means only one thing... high prices. Yes, the food is pretty expensive, so here's the advice I have to offer: order the Shrimper's Net Catch (either the 2/3 for two people or the 1 1/3 for more people) and then order sides like fries. This saves you a lot of money and you get plenty of food. Other than that, the place is exactly what it seems to be. It's a fun place to go for a birthday, but be prepared to be the center of attention. I'll leave that part to your imagination. The food is pretty good. I do love the coconut shrimp. For kids, they can order a kids meal in which the food comes in a fun shaped box that resembles Forest Gump's shrimp boat, The Jenny. Unlike Forest Gump's experience, the food does not taste like cigarettes (A little bit of film reference never hurt). Enjoy!", "author": "Eric M."}

We made the choice to go to Bubba Gumps..the food was good, so I would give the food 3-4 stars but the rest of our experience overshadowed everything else.\nOur waitress kept checking on us when we did not need to be checked on, but was never anywhere when we needed her. Then they got busy and it was impossible to get her to deliver check, we had to ask someone else. Check was delivered and it took sooo long for her to come get credit cards that we, once again, had to stop another server to help us. We felt bad as we were not the other servers responsibility.\n\n After our cards were taken, we wait longer than ever. We all became so grumpy and annoyed at this point, until finally she comes over and says their systems crashed and they need to enter everything manually. I understand systems go down and things go wrong, but please let us know while we are painfully awaiting your return with our credit cards. We must have waited 15 min (more) and a manager came by to apologize (Victor) and we asked for some type of discount (somewhat jokingly yet somewhat serious) and he politely refused, which is bad customer service(he offered to refill our sodas)\n\nFinally we sign off for the bill and head out rolling our eyes..The next day my sister in law discovers her card has been charged 3 times!!! The bill was $87 and with tip she approved $100 charge on her card. Lo and behold, they charged $274 after all three charges together. That was monday, she calls Bubba Gump's on tuesday. Today is friday and the matter has still not been resolved. She was supposed to get a call back yesterday and never did so she had to call them herself today. The person she spoke with said it will have to wait until monday when the banks open..Can you imagine, If someone had no money and could only afford the dinner, not the three charges they mistakenly made, then they would be out of luck (and money) for one week due to Bubba Gump's diligence? My sister in law said they did not even seem that apologetic..\n\nI had never been to a Bubba Gumps, a little too cheesy for my tastes..but I assure you I will never return.

A server comes by and tells us he will help us.. after finally never getting served by him we snag another server named Nicholas.. who was not even supposed to be our server but he kindly helped us, which we were very thankful for because as a server myself I probably would pass a table like us off.. but for him to take initiative to take a table that wasn't his was AMAZING! 30 mins later our original server walks to us and tells us he is ready to take our order but thanks to a server taking us under his wing and not passing us off nor making excuses as to why he couldn't be with us our food was already in, thank the lord! We were already upset from it taking a few days to be seated. I appreciate the server who was willing to be a team player and just help our very hungry table. To the other sever would tried to make excuses as to why he took so long to help? That is why I will never come back. I know our table was big but I ate my food without a drink.. and that is just ridiculous.. guess it was our bad thinking we could come to such a popular place and get decent service.. my advice? Never come with a group over 4 people. Clearly the servers besides Nicholas can't handle it.", "author": "Astyn L."}

I'm not gonna write a long review because my experience was so horrible that no one will probably have one as bad as mine...\n\nAnyway, for what it's worth, the wait was over an hour especially since it's in a super tourist-y place. It was almost two hours because I remember walking outside along the pier to play games and looking at all the other food I could have eaten, but nooo, my family wanted to eat here.\n\nWe finally got seated and no matter how badly we wanted to scream, \"STOP, FORREST, STOP\" to get the waiter to STOP, we didn't. He also never stopped. Anything that was wrong with my family's orders never got fixed. My water never got refilled. It took almost an HOUR to pay. No exaggeration, without the one hour wait time, our dining experience took almost 3.5 hours. Not even joking.\n\nThe food made us all sick. It wasn't that great and I really, really did not anticipate getting sick after. It didn't taste bad but something did not agree with our stomachs. I can only think of one time in my life where I threw up from eating bad food at that was something I made in my own home. I actually threw up after eating here, which NEVER happens to me. I felt shitty for most of the morning after. \n\nThe weirdest part is that I didn't even have any fish or seafood. I had the burger. It had mushrooms, pepperjack cheese, onions, avocado and lettuce on it. With fries. It was $12.50. I felt ripped off for the burger I got. It sounded delicious on the menu but didn't hold up to how hungry I was after waiting like two hours.\nIt wasn't bland, but the flavor still wasn't really there. The meat itself wasn't that great, I got most of the taste from the cheese and tiny bit of avocado I got. It was pretty dry too. \n\nSo, sorry Bubba Gump, can't give you a good review.

If one of your friends is a big fan of the movie, they'd be in heaven here. All they need is a live topless hippy performer, and they'd be set. (After all, this is San Francisco.)\n\nWhat I remember the most is the little sign on the table. One side says \"Stop Forrest Stop\" and the other side says \"Run Forrest Run.\" If you want your waiter to come over, just flip it to \"Stop Forrest Stop\" and any one of the waiters will instantly be at your service. I wasn't used to this, so mine was always flipped to \"Stop Forrest Stop\" and the other waiter kept stopping at our table. Hehehe. \n\nSpeaking of, our service was excellent. Our waiter took time to answer all my questions. The other table's waiter was also pretty lively and was giving a pop quiz on the movie.\n\nWe had a great view of the dock and boats outside and one appeared to be haunted, with lights reflecting off it that appeared to be ghosts.

I noticed we were missing two setups and asked for them... they came 15 minutes later.\n\nThe food was mediocre...my wife had the Tilapia and wasn't happy. When she mentioned it to our server, instead of being caring and wanting to please her, he argued with her how he loved it and it was very popular. While that may be so, this Tilapia was not good.\n\nThen, to add insult to injury, when we got the check, an 18% gratuity was added without our knowledge for a group of just seven people.\n\nIn fairness to the rest of the staff, the Stop Forrest sign worked and it was nice to have a server other than ours stop to see what we needed.\n\nAll in all, I would Run Forrest Run from this location!", "author": "Bill S."}

Most of the nearby wharf restaurants had salads that were priced up to $30 for crab and shrimp toppings. Since Bubba's is a bit of a family tradition when we come to the Pier, we headed on down there and got right in with no wait on a Sunday early afternoon. \n\nHoping to find some type of awesome salad, I found the new Pear and Berry salad on the menu (I think it was $14?) and I asked them to replace the chicken for the grilled shrimp. That was no problem at all, but I do think that it cost a little extra for the shrimp replacement. The salad itself was pretty big, but I expected more shrimp. There were probably 7 or 8 medium-sized shrimp on my salad that tasted as if they were sitting out for a while, about room temperature, and I wasn't \"wowed\" by the texture or taste of them. I suppose I expected larger, more succulent shrimp. The lettuce, berries, pears and dressing were DIVINE, but I really was let down by the shrimp. I wished I had stayed with the chicken. \n\nOur view of the sea was fantastic and we did have a blast watching the boats go by. \n\nI was hungry a few hours later and got an $8 crab and shrimp combo cup at one of those outdoor places off to the side of the Pier (past Ripley's) and that totally satisfied my seafood craving.", "author": "Neon D."}

We had only been to this location one other time and had no complaints. However, yesterday we spent the morning at the exploratorium and walked over to Bubba Gumps for some good seafood. Obviously there was a wait, it is a tourist attraction, but it wasnt too long. After we were seated we asked if we could have a window seat and one of the waitresses was kind enough to reseat us. Our server was very friendly to us and came up to check on us often and to ask us Forrest Gump trivia which is always fun. Overall good service, however my FOOD was absolutely terrible. I ordered the Captain's Fish and Chips (Mahi Mahi) and after I started eating the fish I noticed a weird texture. I had eaten some of it before I actually inspected it and that's when I saw the batter. The outside looked fresh, fried, and delicious, but once I peeled back the batter, I saw that the inside of it was raw. Completely raw, I was eating fish coated in wet, thick, orange, raw beer batter inside. We notified the waitress and the manager and they took my meal off the bill. They asked if I wanted to order anything else but my appetite was gone so I declined. The rest of my families' food was alright. It wasnt hot and my sister had a raw fry but my dish was the only real problem. Safe to say we wont be coming to the SF Bubba Gumps again.", "author": "Adri T."}

That being said, the drinks are around $10 and probably have enough alcohol to be called virgins. \n\nNow you know that if you go to the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation on Fisherman's Wharf you're acknowledging to pay a pretty penny for food that may or may not be up to your standards. For example, you get a bowl of clam chowder for $5.50. Yet I think you could get clam chowder of equal or greater quality out of a can. For $13.95 you could get a jumbo shrimp cocktail with surprisingly generous pieces of shrimp with some horseradish and cocktail sauce and be pleased. But yikes. If you go for a bigger entree like Shrimper's Heaven you're going to be paying $20.50 for a bunch of fried things nifty little cones. If that's your thing then go for it. After all you're there for the experience of living in Forrest Gump's \"box of chocolates\" world!\n\nConsidering we were stashed waaay in the back corner with our party of five, we had great service and attentive waiters and bussers that made sure we were taken care of.

When we first got to Pier 39 we went straight to Bubb Gump so we could put our name down, they told us that the wait would be an hour and a half. So this gave us time to look around Pier 39 while we waited. After about an hour we went to check back and they took us in. Even though it was super busy, our server was great. He would constantly check up on us. He also had us play a little Forest Gump Trivia game with the table next to us, which was interesting. I didn't mind this, but I know some people probably don't like to be bothered while they eat.\n\nWe started out with the Garlic Bread as an appetizer, which was enough for two very hungry people to share. If more than 3 people are in your group, then one order of garlic bread may not be enough. I ordered the Shrimp Shack Mac and Cheese as my main dish, even though it was under the Appetizers. It was so good and so much flavor. For most people, the size of this dish probably wouldn't fill you up, but for me it did it's job. The hubby got the All American Burger and Fries with BBQ Sauce and crispy onions. I assume that he liked it because he took his left overs home.\n\nSide Note- ,if you parked at the garage across the street, make sure you get your parking ticket validated.

I cannot grasp the concept why seafood cost more in San Francisco than Arizona. We order the clams and crabs and they are expensive!!! a simple soup and cesar salad (very bland) cost $16???? For $150 i would expect a feast but instead I walked away extremely disappointed. The place is popular but I feel sorry for those who walked in (myself included). Also I do not appreciate the mandatory tips. I have no critics on their service but it is not worth the $23 tips. \n\nI would strongly suggest people not going to this restaurant. All in all I have better food going to my local Chinese seafood restaurants where I can have unlimited snow crabs and tasty clams for 1/3 the price.", "author": "Tommy L."}

I enjoy a greasy Bloomin' Onion or Chili's margarita with the best of them. But if you found Forrest Gump, the movie, to be cheesy, prepare yourself for this lame-ass place.\n\nMy Mom and her husband were in San Francisco for one day, and this is where they chose to eat. In fact, Mom's husband had been anticipating his trip and Bubba Gump's was a huge, huge part of that. Don't ask, people: I don't know what ails him.\n\nI felt ashamed at this place. In a city with affordable, delicious, plentiful seafood, was I really sitting in this joint that could just as easily be in Wichita, Dayton or Detroit? The food was on par with Red Lobster, but the servers much, much more annoying. \n\nIt's huge, and crowded and full of clueless tourists. I know, I brought two of them there. It was expensive, loud and you had to flip a card on the table to get a server's attention.

The wait for a table was long and they don't do reservations so you just have to sick it out. When we finally got seated the atmosphere inside was cute.. very touristy though. The view of the ocean and Alcatraz from our table was amazing. We ordered several different kinds of shrimp as appetizers and they were ALL delicious. I deeply appreciated that they didn't put to much horseradish in their cocktail sauce. For my entree I got the grilled mahi over rice with lemon butter sauce and tomatoes. It was not nearly as good as the shrimp. The mahi was dry and overcooked, the sauce lacked flavor and the whole dish felt kind of cheap. So my word if advice would be stick to the shrimp! My only other gripe was that the service was very slow.. granted, the place was packed, but a tourist trap like this is predictably packed all the time so the management should know to staff properly to handle the business.

We came here right after spending the morning at Alcatraz. We got a table very quickly and was seated next to a window so we could see the sailboats. \n\nWe wanted a couple cocktail virgins but was the same price with and without alcohol so skipped it. We ended up ordering a few ice teas, soda, the pound and a half of shrimp, a sampler, coconut shrimp, a shrimp brisket and a bowl of clam chowder. \n\nThe utensils was not the only thing dirty. A couple of the ice teas had green stuff stuck to the side of the glass. The tables were kind of sticky. And the plates also had some whitish stuff stuck to them. \n\nThe food itself tasted like Denny's quality. The shrimp brisket had so much oil, when I ate the bread the oil lined my stomach so bad. None of the shrimp was fresh in anyway, most likely using frozen shrimp.", "author": "M C."}

Little did I know the service and food would be atrocious. First off the Gentleman at the gift shop insulted my friends and me. Then our server made it his job to insult me, not only did I feel belittled by our server but another server came up and hit the back of my seat as hard as he could as if to get my attention. None the less that is not how you treat a customer. After waiting for our food we were served what I believe was garlic bread, although it tasted like pure oil and everything fell off. Our main corse was taken to a completely different table. So at a table of four half of our food was there and we waited another 15 mins for the other half. I was over joyed to finally try the famous Bubba Gumps! Yet as soon as I went to eat my sandwich I pulled out a piece of white hair. When shown to the server he denied that it was a hair but still offered me another sandwitch. The entire experience left me so upset I refused to eat anything.

They no longer offer refills on strawberry lemonade which seems to be a bit sticking point for some restaurants. Some do, some don't.  this is the only drink i normally order and didn't because of the .99 cent refill policy which didn't exist the last time i came.

I've been to the Bubba Gump in Monterey before, but this was my first visit to the one in SF.  \n\nI don't remember much of the Monterey one, but this place was pretty awesome about keeping everything themed around the movie Forrest Gump.  See Wayne K.'s review for details on some of the well-done theming.  \n\nAlthough most items on the menu were overpriced (but what wouldn't be on the super-touristy Pier 39??), I thought that my appetizer sampler order was worth its money.  For $14.99, I got some perfectly boiled, fresh shrimp; delicious hush puppies that had shrimp and whole corn niblets; fried shrimp, their special cheddar/spinach/artichoke dip with chips; and some buffalo chicken tenders.

And shock, shock, horror, horror...it's located in the high rent tourist district known as Pier 39 so expect to pay a bit more.  The views are great if you get a seat by the huge bay windows.  And it's not THAT expensive.  The portions for the entrees are pretty huge.\n\nFor starters, we always ordered the popcorn shrimp:  small golden crispy shrimp served--typically--in a popcorn style carton and sometimes atop a bed of actual popcorn, which was kinda cool and actually worked....bonus for creativity.  It's accompanied with two sauces (a tartar and a cocktail, if I remember correctly).\n\nTwo of my favorite entrees (that I no longer see on the online menus) are the boneless Fried Chicken (served with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob--NOTE:  obviously, not date-friendly!) and there was a steak plate (some type of skirt/flat steak I think...a bit on the spicy side) that was consistently decent.  I love seafood, but those two items always jumped out at me and were done well.  \n\nTheir mixed drinks are good as well.  One of my favorites is called \"Mama's Favorite\" which is kinda like a mudslide, with Kahlua and low/nonfat frozen yogurt...hits the spot.  A bit thick and on the filling side, but, I mean, if you're gonna eat heavy, might as well go all the way, right?  And there are two prices for the drinks:  the advertised price typically includes a keepsake souvenir glass...you can always request w/o the souvenir and they'll charge you less.  \n\nService is always pleasant and attentive...just be sure to use their system to flag them down (yeah, they're kinda programmed to follow that, a bit weird, I know).  Besides the birthday madness they'll often squeeze right in to your table to quiz you on Forrest Gump movie trivia while you wait for your food.  \n\nCertain times of year, if you're lucky, you can get front row seats for the sailboat races where the boats literally skim by just outside the windows.  Pretty cool.  \n\nI recommend Bubba Gump's for both locals and tourists.  \nJust make sure to work off all that food somehow afterwards or you'll be in for a food coma for sure.", "author": "Jeff H."}

I was invited to Bubba Gumps by a friend of a friend who really LOVES this place.  (they're from Australia, so go figure!)\n\nAnyway, went in not expecting too much which was good!  The crowds were insane! Fortunately, those friends had already procured a table - hence no waiting (BIG PLUS!).  \n\nI tried the bucket of boat trash (sounds appetizing already doesn't it?), and I have to admit, for generic fried foods... it's not bad.  It covers the requisite criteria: fried seafood, fries, and most fat in the form of coleslaw.  Before you get the wrong idea, I was actually quite surprised when it came.  The fried mahi mahi was still tender and not dried out.  The little tiny lobsters (similar to crawfish) were tasty and because they are so extremely fried, the shell is pretty much edible. (hey... gimme a break, I'm asian, we eat shells some of the times...AND!!! you get your dose of calcium for the day too!)\n\nMy final verdict, not bad.  If you are dragged there by tourist, it's not too horrible.  You'll get a large meal of decently fried foods.  My other friend had the fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and it was HUGE!  2 large fried chicken breasts with a mound of mashed potatoes, coleslaw and whole ear of corn.", "author": "H. Q."}

Our waiter came by very often and was super friendly and helpful. Even gave us a little Forrest Gump pop quiz to help us pass some time by as we waited for our food. He chatted up with my friend who, to everyone's surprise, knew more about the movie than the waiter! Spectacular service from him. *applauds\n\nOnto their food now. I had the mushroom veggie burger and it was soooo delicious except for the fact that it was unevenly prepared. Some bites out of my burger were extremely salty! The edges were also burnt to the point that it was solid black and added a pretty bad taste. I ate through half of my burger before throwing in the towel and just peeling the burnt parts out and eating the middle of the burger where it wasn't salty. Oh yeah, they throw in two huge slices of avocado in the burger which made it extremely tasty(I LOVE avocado!), except they kept falling out. They really should stick with sliced avocados instead of GIANT CHUNKS. The fries that came with my burger, on the other hand, was really satisfying for some reason. It wasn't soggy or soft or too crispy. It was....I can almost say PERFECT if they would've just added a bit of salt. Their fisherman's catch dish was very bland. Once you peel away the shells, the shrimp is tasteless. You know how shrimp has that mild sweet flavor by itself? Well, this didn't taste anything like it. Might as well just eat it with the shell just for the taste. Overpriced food, but can't really complain because it IS a place for tourists and seafood lovers, but for their quality, I'd look elsewhere for seafood.", "author": "Annie S."}

Just another financial ploy to further collect on people's fascination over a good movie.

The idea of telling your waiters you need help simply by changing the sign from stop and go on your table is funny.

I would rank the food 3 stars but the service brought the overall rating down.  \n\nSo first the food and why 3 stars.  We ordered the New Orleans Shrimp and it was good.  A spicy sauce under a bed of white rice and about a dozen grilled shrimp.  The flavor was good.  Wish the portion would be bigger than the price of the dish - $18.  \n\nThe second dish was a fish with shrimp combo and it was good. The right size and good taste.  The third item was a Mac and Cheese and whoever made it did not follow the directions on the blue box.  The dish lacked liquid so was very dry.  And yes, it is what you get in the blue box that you get at the grocery store for a dollar. The last dish was the popcorn shrimp.  Cannot go wrong with fried shrimp.  \n\nBad thing, we never got our salad.  When told, no apologies no nothing.

My review is on their hostess and table wait list service.  We had a large party and they must' have happen to have a table available because they said the wait would only be about 10 minutes.  They said the whole party needed to be there.  When they called my name I told them that our family was still parking in the lot and by the time I told them they were walking over they told me they gave the table up.  I understand they cannot hold the table for a long time, but usually in the city all the restaurants I have been to have been extremely understanding knowing the parking is difficult there.  Also, the walk to the restaurant is farther since they are at the end of the wharf.  I was mostly dissatisfied that I was sitting right next to the hostess table and she didn't have the courtesy to give me a heads up that they were giving up the table so I could just tell my family to go to our other restaurant option.  I can definitely see they are a typical tourist restaurant that doesn't care as much for returning customers and just wants to fill their table with whoever shows up.", "author": "L C."}

I hadn't eaten lunch, it was already 2:30pm and I didn't feel like wandering around Pier 39 anymore.\n\nIt was my first time to eat at Bubba Gump and probably the last time at that. If anything I went in just to say that I've eaten there. I wasn't expecting a grand experience, but the view of the bay was great. \n\nI didn't like how I put my name down for a table, got called over the PA system to announce that a table was ready, only to wait in line AGAIN for a table to be actually ready. I was starved at this time of the day so needless to say I wasn't very happy to wait twice for a table.\n\nThe artichoke dip was actually pretty good. There were huge chunks of artichoke. It was cheesy and oily (which made it good). Adding the extra pieces of shrimp like what we had didn't really make a difference in the flavor of the dip, only that it was a little bit more on the price.\n\nThe clam chowder was okay...still not as good as others I've tried, but at least it didn't taste like it came straight out of a Progresso Clam Chowder can. It had a lot of clam pieces, which was a nice surprise.\n\nI ordered the shrimp po' boy since I didn't feel like having anything huge. It was great for the most part. The shrimp was nicely breaded and stayed crunchy even with the dressing in the sandwich. It was a little dry.\n\nOur server was enthusiastic and helpful, so I can't complain there.\n\nThe only time that I'd probably go back here is when I have relatives over and they wanted to go to a Bubba Gumps, but I'd most definitely try to steer them in another direction if I could.", "author": "Chris F."}

As for the Shellfish bucket, It was a decent size serving of mussel, clams, crab legs and a lobster claw in some garlic sauce.  Too be honest it was kind of bland, there was really no special taste to it that caught my attention.  I found myself dipping almost everything in butter which is totally good for my health.  My friends got the shrimp basket, that was good but it was a bit on the salty side.   All in all, this is a nice place to try out if you're in the area.

He Immediately swapped out my husbands warm tap beer for a colder one. He explained they were out of chilled glasses. But my food order was a huge disappointment. I ordered an $18 dollar  shrimp Louisiana bourbon skewers with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob & coleslaw. This food was completely cold. There was absolutely no heat at all. We were trying to catch a cruise to Alcatraz so there wasn't time to send it back. But I'm really surprised they would think such cold food would be acceptable. I tipped the waiter $12.00 out of $14.00, and wrote a note on the bill about the super cold food. Maybe he'll let the cooks know they are messin' with his money and step up their game when it comes to serving hot food.  Next trip to SF, I'll skip the trip to Bubba Gumps and get some chowder and fresh bread bowl instead.", "author": "Marcy R."}

We were lucky and did not have much of a wait for a table on a busy Saturday evening.  I ordered the clam chowder and fish & chips.  The clam chowder was ok.  A bit too peppery and watered down.  I prefer my clam chowder to be creamy.  The fish & chips came with 5 pieces of fish; which weren't particularly big.  The flavor though was good.  Would I go back to this restaurant?  Meh....there are other restaurants at the pier that I would prefer to go try before returning to Bubba Gump.

It was jammed packed in there though, even in the late afternoon. And noisy. Three people had a birthday apparently, and the loud, obnoxious birthday song was certainly not helping the atmosphere. \n\nI ordered the Shrimper's Heaven, which was 4 kinds of Shrimp. Tempura, fried, coconut, and chili. Tempura shrimp was flavorless and barely warm, same with fried shrimp. The chili shrimp were slightly below room temperature, and barely tasted of anything other than plain shrimp. The coconut shrimp were hot and juicy, and delightful. Unfortunately 1 out of 4 is not acceptable for a shrimp restaurant literally a stone's throw away from the ocean. The fries were good. Dipping sauces were passable, and I relied on the classic seafood sauce for my flavor. \n\nAmong the other tourist traps on the wharf I visited, this was the most unfortunate.

Wait staff apologized and took ten minutes just to bring me the salad. Husband asked where my soup was and I just told them to forget it. My teenager ordered the clam chowder and didn't like it. Husband tasted and said the same. Usually when the wait staff makes a mistake they may offer a discount or free item, but nothing. The waiter serving us did not even apologize, only the food runner did. Very loud, lots of customers, but I am willing to bet if it wasn't on the wharf they wouldn't be as popular.

They got a good listing of mixed drinks and beers on tap here.  Hurray!  Their food on the other hand is a little above average, but I'd expect more coming to a place like this.  But at least they validate your Pier 39 parking for you for eating here.  I'd recommend either getting a fish & chips plate or getting down with a fish fillet or some sort of fish plate that looks and sounds good on the menu.

My friend called me to tell me he was not going to work because there drain system and sewage line backed up into the dishwashers, sinks, cooking areas, bar, everywhere...They did close for a full day to clean up and have health inspectors check it out before opening but I have not gone back cus even the dishwasher's had backed up sewage and there kitchen was full of piss & shit...So I would never go back and eat there again....", "author": "Michael H."}

After waiting hours to be seated we were asked if our party of 8 (plus a high chair) would like to split our party up inorder to be served at two different tables.  Are you kidding me!!  What's the point of being put on the wait list with a large party when you will be asked while your being seated (might I add) if your party would like to be split up.  Of course we DECLINE!!  Then they proceeded to seat us at a table that had enough room for 8 chairs only!  Where was my 2 year old suppose to sit on top of the table? REALLY!!!  By this time I'm getting annoyed.  I asked  the female embecles who made the silly request to split up my party that I wanted to speak to the manager.  She replied with a nasty attitude \"I am the manager', as if I had asked her to have several seats in those hard, ugly chairs they make their customers sit in.  Then we were told that we had to wait until customers at another table vacated so they could push their table together to make room for my party and THEN proceeded to ask my party of 8 (plus a high chair) remind you to sit at a booth which seats 4 at the most.  You want us to sit where?  WHAT IS GOING ON UP IN HERE!!!!   After waiting for the other party to vacate which I must add was a party that was split up as well.  They were waiting for the rest of their party who was seated close by at another table to finish their meals so they could all leave together.  Unbelieveable!!!  Once seated I wish we had left.  They only reason I stayed was because my children waited so long and really wanted to eat there.  The food was terrible, cold and bland.  The waiter at another table spilled someone drink all over the table and the floor.   I can't believe I paid money to this establishment after experiencing what my family and I had to deal with.

Had to wait about an hour to get seated. Then had to fight the crowd to even walk through the front door after being called to get seated. The we were greeted sent up to person who seats us, the guy got 3 menus and then walked about 100 mph to the table. While here I was practically pulling the arm off of my 7 yr old trying to keep up. Crazy. The same goes when trying to exit the restaurant. I was thinking wow, what if a fire broke out and you were trying to get out of this place and all you have is this small opening jam packed with people. I over heard another pissed of lady cussing to her friend about the people blocking the entrance way.\n\nSo...then...our waitress came and we ordered our drinks. I ordered a lemonade (the one for $7.95 for my son, came with a glass you can keep, well it wasnt glass but plastic but the bottom lit up which he liked) So she brought us 3 waters and 5 min later the lemonade came. My son took a slurp and his mouth puckered. I drank it and did the same. The waitress came by and asked how it was. He said the truth, it was sour. She just gave a questioned looked and just smiled.  I thought ok.\n\nMy husband ordered the bucket of junk (which consisted of fried fish, shrimp and 2 lobster claws) I tasted the lobster and it was good. Son got the usual chicken tenders & fries. It came in a paper Jenny boat, it was cute.\nI ordered the fish sandwich (I got it charbroiled instead of fried) when it came out it wasnt charbroiled and it didnt have much flavor. Very bland. I tried dumping some of that hot sauce that was on the table and it worked. The pickle it came with was warm and real salty. Fries were nothing special. \nYes the view is nice we sat in the lower level, not right next to the window but the tables next to them. So we have the table in the upper level, group of people sitting there facing outwards. Feels like you are being watched while you eat, drink & talk. Like you have your own audience. lol\nWe never used that Run Forest Run / Stop Forest Stop license place signs on the table but the people next to us was using it when trying to pay the bill. Funny. Our waitress told us about using it too. Guess its good so you dont have to depend on 1 person to help out on tables. \n\nI just thought it was funny that they were playing the Forest Gump movie and its been about what, 15 yrs since that movie came out?? wow!

I expected crowded & over priced, but I did not expect to receive low grade sea food.  I ordered the Dumb Luck Coconut Shrimp and was appalled to find that my shrimp had not been deveined in the least and were tough and cheap.  I kept getting an intermittent strange tastes.  I guess they got lucky and a few of them weren't as full of waste as others, because it took me 5 shrimp to take the breading off and find the black vein.  I should have said something, but I was so disgusted that I knew I could not possibly be courteous about my complaint.  The  service was good, but my boyfriend got bitter tea and then when he complained and asked for Coke refills, was advised that the tea glass would have to be used as to avoid a charge for Coke????  Really?  Asked for more sauce and it never appeared.  The calamari was tasteless and chewy.  Very disappointing all the way around.  All in all, the view was not worth the aggravation and we would have been better off with a sourdough bowl & chowder from one of the smaller vendors.  I will not be returning to Bubba Gumps in San Francisco and may very well avoid all the restaurants.  You can surely find someplace more worthwhile to give your $$$$ to at Fisherman's Wharf.", "author": "Dorine J."}

I am an avid fan of \"Forrest Gump\", so this place holds a nostalgic value for me. I was last here in 2010, and our family always has to get a photo with the giant shoes outside the front door. The fish and chips are divine, and I love the view from the tables of Alcatraz, San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. I was much better at Forrest Gump trivia than I thought I would be. ONe question was, which 3 sports was Forrest involved in? The answer, obviously is football, running, and Ping-Pong. Duh! The setting in Fishermans Wharf is a lot of fun, though from what I hear, its an area Bay area natives try to avoid, because of all the tourists. BUt right outside the Wharf, you can see big red open-topped buses that give a great tour of the city. This is a town with a lot of history. Before you tour the City by the Bay, get it started with some great seafood, with great views of the bay, and do it all while quoting the best movie to come out of the 1990's. Well worth a visit. I've been to different Bubba Gump restaurants, like the one in Anaheim and the one in Universal Studios, but this is my favorite one.", "author": "Shane M."}

Unique way xD I ordered a steak which comes with mash potatoes. It was good, and one of my friends ordered clam chowder, and boy it looks good also. I should try that next time I go there. Even tho this is like a place to eat shrimp, but sadly I didn't try it, but comments about their shrimps were good also. For a birthday party, the staff told the man with the loudest voice to cheer up the party. And he was sure loud! Everyone in the whole place can hear it =D They had my friend stand on a chair and told her to hold a cup of ice cream and that man just started his cheer. His cheer was quite comical also. Also, during your meal, a waiter will come and asks you questions about the movie. I had a wonderful time there, and hope to visit there again. Looking forward to it!", "author": "Elaine W."}

Really?! I mean, where's the common sense in that? Waiting to be seated then having to wait again to actually be seated? Awkward..\n\nAnywho, the majority of the menu is overpriced seafood. (What do you expect - it's tourist food!) Don't get me wrong, I love seafood - I just wasn't much in a mood for it today. I ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy which surprisingly filled me up (alone, without the fries) for a 6\" inch sandwich. Typically, a foot long sandwich from Subway would fill me up, so you know why I was like :O!? It was good though. But before our food was served - waiting - our waitress quizzed us about the movie. If you look around the place - you can actually find some answers to the questions :) If you win, there's a prize!! The prizes are hilarious and have been on your table from the moment you seated.. Whatever is in your bucket, you can take ONE thing from it (a roll of paper towels, hot sauce, ketchup, towelettes, etc)!! I thought she was joking but it's true - you can take one, only if you win though. All in all, the service was great. I really liked our waitress (Jamie); she definitely made the experience enjoyable. \n\nI'm coming back for Jenny's Mini's since I really liked Jenny's Strawberry Surprise..

You have to know about seafood to eat at a seafood place. Get the bucket of shrimp thing and my all time favorite is the market value crab. Great! My absolute favorite. Me and my tear up that crab. Keep in mind it's a theme restaurant it's not a fancy French menu, wine selling type of place. It's seafood so don't go out to eat if you don't have money. I read some of these comments about \"not worth the money\" broke a$$ don't go out to eat seafood. Duh!! I love this place for It's shrimp and crab. I try not to comment on service because the waiter are people. Not your personal slave. Take my order, keep my drink full, bring my bill, keep the change. Thats all I need. This is a 5Five5 *star* restaurant I rate it a 1 just because I only read the bad comments myself and I want this to be read. Never been busy at lunch time. Love it!", "author": "Travelers H."}

There were shoes, a bench and a box of chocolates outside the entrance to take pictures like Forrest Gump. That was cool if you are into taking pictures as if you are famous. When you finally get called up you have to wait in line again for a few minutes until they finally have a table cleaned up for you. Seems like you shouldn't have to wait in two lines to get seated....The view is great..on a clear day. You can see the Bay Bridge pretty well and even Alcatraz if you are seated toward the rear of the restaurant. The waiter we had was awesome, he made us feel like we were friends right off the bat. He was attentive to our needs. There are lots of specialty drinks to choose from, not too many beer options though. I know that San Francisco has the highest cost of living but I thought the price for what you get was a bit high. For three of us who shared 3 plates our bill was about 80 plus tip. There were no leftovers and I was still hungry. We ordered clam chowder, halibut with mashed potatoes, and 1/2 garlic and 1/2 cajun shrimp. The cajun shrimp was good. The clam chowder was a bit on the thin side. The halibut was pretty plan but it was pretty moist and went well with the mashed potatoes. All in all I would say that the service was great and that you are definitely paying for the location and not so much the food.", "author": "Rudy P."}

I'm allergic to fish, and shrimp, so it's only natural that I would go eat at Bubba Gump's. No, well actually it was my friend's birthday and her restaurant choice, so I went along with it. The wait was a little long, since they don't take reservations, but i did appreciate the view. Wait, that's a lie, because all i saw was pitch blackness, some lights in the distance, and maybe a boat or two floating by the whole time I was eating. Thanks to my allergy, I ordered the sirloin. It wasn't bad. The staff's also really friendly. I might just mention that unless you want to embarrass the hell out of yourself or your friend, do not go there for either of your birthdays because you are going to have to stand up on that chair and be coerced into shaking your ass while they dangle a tiny cup of ice cream in front of your face and scream to the entire restaurant that it's your birthday.

I had a pasta and shrimp dish that would have been awesome (really good sauce on the pasta), except the shrimp was horrendously overcooked.  I mean, I hardly ever cook shrimp myself and I can do a better job.  That's sad.  Anyway this was far and away the most rubbery shrimp I have ever had.  However, I was STARVING so I ate it anyway and told the waitress how bad it was after the fact.  And then, to my surprise, the manager came over and gave me a full refund!  Even though I'd eaten it all!  So great customer service on their part.  It also had a great view (the reason we picked the place to begin with) and my mango spritzer drink was nice.

I didn't know much else, and have always loved Bubba Gump in the past because of the fun atmosphere. This particular night, I shared an appetizer of spinach/artichoke dip, got some peach alcoholic drink that had ice cream in it, and had some kind of shrimp-scampi-esque entree with pasta and capers. I can safely say that the spinach/artichoke dip was not the problem, as I shared it and no one else in my party got sick. However, my drink, the shrimp, or the butter/capers in my entree, were a problem. I was up sick all night in a hotel, which was a great experience seeing as I had a 6 hour drive back to socal the next day. It was my first experience with food poisoning, and let me just tell you that I still can't eat shrimp, spinach/artichoke dip, scampi sauce, or capers. I would stay away from Bubba Gump unless you don't mind risking food poisoning, because in skimming the first few Yelp reviews, I see I am not the only one who suffered that fate.", "author": "Bridgette A."}

Yes, this cup of liquid has some green tea mixed with some other stuff that I have never heard of which explained the tea flavor. I am not saying green tea is bad, but Amazon nectar was not enjoyable.\nThe shrimps in the shrimp net catch was not good shrimp. I didn't mix it up well enough, so some of them were quite salty.
