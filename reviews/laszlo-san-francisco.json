(They only had four cocktails on the menu and this was the only one with dark.) I tried the other two and they were a little more refreshing. Especially the pink flamingo. I'm not big on tequila, but the jalapeno in the Selena gave it a good kick.\n\nNice stop for one drink. I just wish their cocktail menu was bigger.

Our party was not drunk or being demanding, this was the first impression within the first 5 minutes of arriving. We came in with full intentions of having dinner and drinks, the waitress had such a nasty attitude that we ended up ordering only water and to make matters worst, she brought one of the glasses broken! Our entire party felt very uncomfortable that we took our business else where. I will never come in again or recommend this place to anyone!

You could feel the heat hit the back of your throat and warm up your belly. \n\nI'm not from the bay area, but when I come back up to visit, this place will be on my place to hit up.", "author": "Tracey W."}

Laszlo has all of these (sans cigars).  This place is definitely a great spot to hang and be in company of good people who just want to have a good time.  The crowd is a little older, and by older I mean mature.  30's 40's crowd, et al.  \n\nWhat strikes me best about this bar is the most obvious attraction; the classic movies being projected on the wall leading to the second level.  I'm quite comfortable sitting at my booth with Macallan in hand, having a good conversation w/ random people and still be drawn to the movie played against that huge backdrop.\n\nThe bartenders are quite talented.  Just know what you want up front, and be prepared to get a look of disconcert when you don't.  This is business, a fast one, and bartenders here are here for you as long as you are not taking money out of their pocket when 50 others are trying to order drinks and you delay them even for a minute. Not to say they won't help you, but you don't want to be that guy/girl!\nThe drinks are aplenty and they are strong! They are made with a lot of love so be sure to tip the bartenders well; they will definitely remember you.  In my most recent outing, while having the sweetheart bartender prepare my Macallan neat, I happened to notice her eyes jump out of her head as she studied the menu to see how much my drink actually cost.  Needless to say, I tipped her very well, and my next 3 came soon as I walked to her side of the bar.\n\nDRINKS: Perfect.\n\nAmbiance: Lovely.\n\nBathrooms - Very important!

You walk in and see that the focus is the long bar to the left.  You walk to the back to find a door that leads you to the bathroom and an exit to Foreign Cinema.  Next to this door is a staircase to the upstairs level that can host about 35-40 people.  The place is pretty packed on Saturdays (1. its a great bar; 2. as peeps have reviewed - this is where you go before your F.C reservation).  It gets warm upstairs when at full capacity (and perhaps with a few cocktails thrown back too). \n\nDJ stands at the front door basically, facing towards the bar.  Music is not Top 40's but is in the same vain.  Its fun, throw-back, and while it may not be a song that everyone can scream-sing along to --- it will keep a party going & sustain a happy mood.   \n\nPARTYLEAD:  If you want to reserve upstairs - you have to meet an $800 bar minimum APPROX.  Note my \"APPROX\".  This may or not be exact.  Basically, the area is reserved for your party - but there is only the bar downstairs - you have to let the bar know the celebrant's name when you order drinks.  But honestly, as long as they see that the alki is a-flowin' --- that minimum isn't strict.  Another note:  There is no \"bouncer\" so to speak - to let your guests through so you could potentially get \"strangers\" up there.  They don't put a rope at the staircase or a \"reserved\" sign on the tables or anything.  Its more of a mutual understanding that that's your spot.  I feel like this matches the relax, free-spirited vibe of the district. \n\nIf you're wondering about COVER - don't.  Because there is none.\n\nIf you're wondering \"WHAT DO I WEAR?\" - don't.  Its the Mission District.  Its SF no less.  Do you, boo boo, DO YOU.  Its a take me for who I am city.  And donnn't you love it?!!!!!!", "author": "Deanna A."}

There's a small upstairs area if you want more privacy, or you could sit at the bar/the couches downstairs.

I had a dish with chicken sausage, thinly cut fries, avocados, what I believe to be kale hash, all mixed with some other yummy unidentifiable food. IT WAS D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.

I'll update when I go back, which, impressively, after this message, I will. \n\n\"Hi, my name is Phil, I am one of the bartenders at Laszlo bar.\nI was not working on that Saturday when you came in and had a tough time there, but I did work the night before on Friday and I think I am responsible for the 'watery' drinks.\nThe story is a little strange and fantastical, but true:\n\nThe big sign behind the bar which advertises or happy hour is being replaced, so, in the meantime, we keep a visual aid bottles of the Trumer Pils  beer, and the Stoli vodka. I made a display only 'dummy' bottle of Stoli and filled it with water. To my credit, I actually wrote with a sharpie 'DISPLAY ONLY'. This is when the service breakdown begins.\n\nI gave Glenn (your bartender) an ear full for not looking at/reading the bottle, not listening to you (the guest) inquiring that the drink was made with water and not vodka, and not smelling the drink, getting another co-worker to taste, etc. He has been sober for a long time, so I respect his not drinking, but he should of thought of other action to take.\n\nok, this is getting long, sorry. In summary, we care and respect your comments, it is important to us, and we hear you. Bryan and I have worked there for 10 years this August and we always try to make a strong generous drink, so I hope you come in and let us (Phil or Bryan) make this up to you.\n\nI am going to send this to the other Yelp folks that I think were in your group also.\nThanks for your time.

I went for the Thrillist Mad Men party, at which I only had gin drinks and they were already paid for, so unfortunately I can't judge the other cocktails or the pricing. I was very impressed that the bartenders slaved at squeezing fresh lemon and lime juices for all the Tom Collinses and gimlets - though I was pretty impatient when it took them longer. They were extremely gracious and helpful when I kept asking about the different cocktails. The only bad thing about my time there was some drink called the Negroni.

The decoration and signage, fun stuff. It actually inspired me to link a pic of my favorite flask in Laszlo's honor, cheers comrades.\n\nAnyway, besides the theme of the bar, it's a really nice space with some really good music.\n\nAs mentioned, there's an upstairs lounge but the first floor is open all the way up to the ceiling so it has a huge feeling to it even though it's not that big at all. I'm not sure who's necessarily spinning at any given time but I'm always happy with the beats. The music and place itself have a very loungy feel, just like you'd want with the dim lighting and random movie playing on the big screen. \n\nIn my opinion, sometimes bars are obnoxious with playing movies throughout the night. If it's on big TVs, dim lighting is shot and your whole \"lounge\" just got a bit less \"chill\". Laszlo does it right though, it's projected really high up on the wall so if you're on the first floor you don't have to notice the movie unless you want to. \n\nOn top of that the movies are always the craziest movies ever, like really odd but in a good way black and white flicks. I was really hammered there recently and I vaguely recall a movie that had a bunch of goats in it and I'm pretty sure some of them were injured, I really can't recall much more. I also don't know if the movies being played are always black and white but even if they do play other genres I don't take Laszlo to be the \"Let's put on Oceans 11\" type.\n\nDefinitely worth the stop in my opinion.", "author": "Justin N."}

The last time I've been here, I was with some girl friends sitting at the lower floor corner with the place bring crazy packed. So fast forward about 3-4 years later. It seems like this place haven't changed at all. For this second time, I came for a film screening that was put together by a consultant company. Just like before, I walk through the wooden doors and the bar right immediately to the left. The place is very dim, there's a staircase at the very end of the room that leads to what looks like a second floor. Except, it's really just a narrow walkway for a few extra seating, so you can say it's more like a long balcony. It is a small place so I don't think this place will ever be space free unless there is a private party here. They might their drinks pretty strong here so you get your money worth for the alcohol.\n\nThis place is very cozy, kind of remain me a little bit of a cabin with dashes of modern touches.

This was my first time here and to be honest, I was really impressed with the place and the professionalism of the staff.  Well, up to a certain point that is.\n\nAs I was hanging with my friends and having a fantastic time, I turned around and noticed that my more than half full drink had suddenly disappeared.  Now everyone that knows me knows that I am the nicest guy and tonight especially, I had plenty of money so I wasn't trying to milk drinks, but all of a sudden, my more than half full drink was gone.  I super nicely and politely asked the bartender and bar back what happened to my drink and his response shocked the h#ll out of me.  I just couldn't understand it.  The bar back was really nice and professional and told me that he would never take my drink which was less than half full and I believed him.  He, like the bouncer, had the demeanor and attitude befitting an establishment such as this.  The bartender, whose name was confirmed numerous times this evening as Phil, was a total d#ck.\n\nWhat really breaks my heart and I bet even he could confirm this, is that I was so nice in the way I went about asking about my missing drink.  I was super polite and tactful in the way I asked about what happened to my drink, but in the process, another yelper (whose name per her request shall remain anonymous) mentioned yelp, upon which the bartender literally said out loud in front of everyone, \"F#CK YELP, I DON'T GIVE A SH#T ABOUT YELP!\"  Hello...I don't need that.\n\nI didn't want any grief or drama and calmly walked away from this classless individual, upon which some other people of our group got into it with him and I later found out that he then took away a full drink of another friend and yelper.\n\nI found the whole situation embarassing and didn't need the drama, but as I left the bar by my own choice, I did explain the actions of the unpleasant and unexplanably unprofessional and obnoxious bartender with other Laszlo staff and was told more than once, \"Oh yes, Phil is always that way!  WTF!\n\nThe other day, a close friend and fellow Yelper jokingly gave me a hard time that I have not had too many negative reviews since becoming Elite five months ago.  Well, I explained how I always try to lean towards the positive as opposed to the negative, but here's one for the books.  \n\nUltimately, here's the understatement of the year...I was not impressed!  Too bad, since I really liked the place and had this not happened, I most certainly would have given the place at least a four, most likely five.  Phil...you suck!  Too bad, because had this not happened, I really liked the place.  Yelpers, take heed...we are not wanted here.", "author": "Roy N."}

All the meanwhile, an average DJ plays some mixes of 80's, 90's, and other stuff.\n\nA little time goes by, the friends show up, more friends show up, and other people show up and become friends!

The bottom floor is classic bar, the top loft balcony level a bit more loungey with low seating and a curtained off area for canoodling (if so inclined). The drinks are solid too - some of the best motha-f-ing mojitos I've had in this city. \n\nDespite all this, I've never really connected with the place, and I'm not sure why. Perhaps its the proximity to Medjool that turns me off. Perhaps it was the crowd/vibe whenever I've gone. Or perhaps it was the icy-cold reception I last received when I bumped into a friend and his very possessive ladyfriend (Relax! I am NOT trying to steal your guy!). \n\nDespite the turn-offs, I'm sure I'll be back. It's too damn convenient, and those mojitos, too damn good.

His style was less Chippendale and more 'girls gone wild' so he failed to convince me.  He did get me wet by spilling a drink all over my lap.  He was sweet though.  And so was the \"straight\" guy sitting next to me who got a partial wet lap dance in the process.\n\nWe also met a cute male nurse from Alaska who claimed he is straight but his handbag was more fierce than mine...\n\nA very butch woman who claimed she was straight complimented my sexy legs by caressing my upper thigh (my legs ARE unquestionably gorgeous so this one is a tossup)...\n\nI am convinced that Laszlo that night was the final \"on deck closet\" for those ready to come out, a final training ground for fun cocktails, animated conversations, 80's music and lap dancing.  \n\nEven if you don't need to come out, you will have a good time in this closet sized lounge/bar.", "author": "mia s."}

But yeah, it's Laszlo and not the Foreign Cinema bar.\n\nMy native language is English and I'm not an expert on the Cyrillic alphabet, but as I understand it the letter they're using for an 'a' in their logo is actually a 'd'. I wonder if this is confusing for native speakers of slavic languages. I also wonder if those who grew up east of the iron curtain and left to come here would find the communist theme cute or amusing.\n\nRegardless, the space is aesthetically pleasing; The soviet movie posters, polished concrete, and simple furniture invoke russian constructivism without being too cold or austere. The pictures posted here may lead you to believe the space is bigger than it really is; Laszlo is actually kind of intimate, maybe 20' by 30' with a small upstairs lounge.\n\nTrumer Pils on tap for $2, and they make a good bloody mary as well.

A friend of mine wanted a cocktail that has whiskey or bourbon in it and she asked the bartender to make her a drink that wasnt too sour but sweet like a blood and sand.

I told her that I was looking for a space to have about 20 friends for my birthday. She said, \"What date?\" I told her Sunday, February 15th and asked her if I would have to reserve the balcony area. She said that I wouldn't have to reserve, that it was probably ok since it was a Sunday night and that I would definitely be able to order food in from Foreign CInema, which is really the only reason I chose this space. \n\nWhen the first two party-goers got there before me they asked the bartenders who did not let them upstairs.  When I arrived I spoke to one of the bartenders and explained the situation. I told him we'd have a lot of people and the upstairs would be better for everyone involved. He said he'd talk to the other bartender but that he was sure they would be able to accommodate us. He came back to us with a deal. We could go up there if we promised to spend at least $300 at the bar. \nI wasn't worried about hitting that amount at all with 16-20 people having several drinks each, but I thought it was a little weird to just pull that rule out of their asses.\n\nBut it gets better (worse). Foreign Cinema was bought out for a wedding and therefore was not serving food to the bar. I WAS STARVING and looking forward to drinking blood mary's and sucking oysters all night long! I get cranky when I'm hungry. Very cranky.\nI asked, \"Can we order food for delivery?\"\n\n\"Definitely not\"\n\nGetting crankier.....\n\n\nFinally, we snuck food in from the other restaurant next door, Medjool. (THANKS SCOTTY! You're the best!!)

You have to pretty much yell in order to talk to anyone. I do like the music there though.\n\nOn the wall they have this huge projection screen which plays movies I've never seen. I guess if you're bored you can always drink and watch the weird movie. \n\nBathrooms are very clean but being dead drunk it can be quite the chore to get from the bar down the hallway to it. \n\nThe drinks are great here. Both times I've gone here I've gotten plastered. Prices are pretty decent. \n\nI'd definitely like to come back but after saturday night and this huge street fight which resulted from a club across the street, I might be coming back on a weeknight. \n\nI'm not quite sure why this place appeals to me as much as it does but it does.", "author": "Jenniffer T."}

When we got to Laszlo it seemed lively and people were outside and before I could say anything Andre was leading my dad and their other friend into Laszlo and proceeding to dance and the boy and I did our \"oh well\" shrugs and followed.\n\nAs I recall, I drank a Lemon Drop that was delish, and danced, but I have no idea what kind of music was playing and I think I was dancing with my boyfriend but who's to say?  Nor am I sure what my dad and his friends were doing.  I think my dad was drunk-dialing my mother, and I hesitate to speculate as to what his friends were doing.  But the lighting was good, the vibe was lively but not douchey, and did I mention that my dad is awesome?\n\nIt should be noted that I woke up with I think the second worst hangover of my life.  So apparently I inherited my dad's ability to drink, but not his ability to entirely avoid hangovers.  I literally can not keep up with my father.

I was excited about their mezzanine area as a different vibe as well. This space had what I was looking for (and I will give it 1 more try bc of all the above things) but it lacked a few key things the night of my group outing. 1. schedule was not updated for their music online the week of so I had to call and get the run around through Foreign Cinema 2. I called and asked about the music and bringing a party here but I was not told anything about the $400 min for the mezzanine - and oh it was already rented the night I planned on going. Apparently I should have \"emailed instead of called\" to get better service - noted. 3. Bartenders were not accommodating (when happy hour was over I wanted the same drink @ whatever cost it was after happy hour bc I was trying to stay consistent to not get sick ;-) but was informed they were \"sold out\" and they did not offer to at least give something \"similar\" - are you kidding? Service 101 if you cant get em what they want give em something similar. Not hard. I am pretty easy to please So in the end my friends and I had a great time, enjoyed the atmosphere but wished it was managed a lil better to make the whole experience smoother so my group -of 15- felt welcome and didn't comment to me the next day that the bartenders could have been better - unanimously.", "author": "Bokhara G."}

The bar had dim lighting and looked like a great place for us to hang out, so I was excited to get a stoli drink (or two) in before the end of happy hour. My friend (Annie) and I went to the bar and ordered two stolis w/pineapple juice. I knew that this was what I wanted, but Annie asked the bartender for her recommendation. The bartender responded with \"I don't drink.\" ...A bartender that doesn't drink? That's like a cook that doesn't eat. How do you know if what you're making is any good?\n\nAnyways, we grabbed our drinks and sat down with the group, excited for the night! Annie took a sip of her drink and said \"you can't taste the alcohol\" to which I responded, \"I know! Pineapple juice is a great mixer.\" She didn't look appreciative. \"No, you can't taste the alcohol. Try it.\" I took a sip of my drink only to discover that I had paid $5 for pineapple juice mixed with water. \n\nI won't lie - I don't like the taste of alcohol - any of it. I drink, but I don't truly enjoy even the best drink at Bourbon & Branch more than I do a glass of apple juice. And when I can't taste the horrible taste of alcohol in a drink, it means there isn't any. Another friend who had ordered a stoli drink said his didn't taste like it had any alcohol either. After some peer pressure from another awesome co-worker, we approached the bartender who made our drinks and questioned her. She stared blankly and said \"I put a lot of alcohol in there. You guys watched me pour it.\" There were so many things I wish I could've said to her, but I didn't really know how to argue. Anyways, Laszlo is shady and I won't be going back again. I only wish that I had paid attention to which bottle she grabbed and where from so that I could demand a shot of that \"alcohol\" just to catch them in their crummy practices!", "author": "Jenny Z."}

(you can take the girl out of queens, nyc.... ) but i've found other ways of working my shit out here in this fine city, and so should you.\n\nwe all left and won't be going back. if people wanted to get rankled for no good reason we could just stand out on the street in these here parts, and we wouldn't have stepped into YOUR bar.   nice work, lady.  just keep working that magic and you'll drive this redundant bar into the ground in no time.", "author": "Nikki F."}

So if, like me, you're more of a SF fog-and-fireplace loving type, you can see how this place would rate a mere 3 stars.  However, I give it a bonus star because the 2-story architecture is sweet, and the cocktails are the real thing here.  I might even like the whole place more on a non-Saturday, when I could feel slightly less like part of a clubby, poser mob.", "author": "Wes M."}

Candle light is about all you get after dark. And the upstairs balcony which offers more privacy for those people who want to get buzzed and enjoy a sexy makeout session without advertising it. \r\n\r\nLazlo has great drink specials at happy hour, which include cheap imports and low-priced cosmos. The one \"downside\" is there's not an extensive wine list. I had to wait in line behind a group of people asking the bartender to go over all three types of red about a million times. If you want a special, esclusive wine what the fuck are you doing here?? Take tomorrow off work and DRIVE up to Napa for godsake. \r\n\r\nAnyways, they always play a good set of music from one of several iPods provided by the waitstaff on that shift. Coincidentally, I also had my iPod so after a couple drinks, I asked if they'd play a few songs from it- and they plugged it right in. \r\n\r\nThere's something about slammin' a $4 martini while rockin' out to Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'\" - the other patrons were all tapping their feet and holding imaginary lighters skyward. \r\n\r\nDefinately going back for another happy hour soon!", "author": "Alex G."}

If only it were possible to rate a place with negative stars, I would. \n\nI spent New Year's Eve here, as I was invited by friends who had reserved it for the evening, and had a relatively good time, until the end. \n\nThe bar's decent...kinda small and very small balcony. Drinks are what you'd expect for SF/Mission, minus I asked the bartender for something not much more difficult than a vodka/cran and his reply was \"not right now\"...you'd think that if drinks are $7-10 a piece, he could make time, but I forgave him seeing as it WAS New Year's Eve.  \n\nAt the end of the night, the steroid raging manbearpig of a bouncer stormed through the bar screaming that \"everyone needs to get the F**K out of the bar!\" Well, like most normal people, we took this as our cue to leave. We (my best friend and I..who are 24 year old young women and about 5'3\") walked over to where are coats and purses were, by which time the bouncer had turned around and I guess decided we weren't moving fast enough (it was maybe 10 seconds after he yelled to the whole bar). He grabbed my friend and literally pushed her out of the bar, sans purse. After verbally trying to get the bouncer to understand that all we needed was the purse so that we could leave as he requested, I turned around into the door way to try to get back in so that I could physically retrieve it, but was met with a fist in my face and was knocked to the ground. At this point, I was angry and my friend was bawling outside because, not only did we just get physically abused for no reason, but we still couldn't get her stuff back, so I called the cops. \nMoral of the story:\n1) The bouncer's name is Mike and he should be fired on the spot. \n2) The manager never once came to see what happened, and thus, should be fired on the spot. \n3) Women BEWARE.
