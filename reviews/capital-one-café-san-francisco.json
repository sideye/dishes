It's so convenient of a location to get work done when you need to. This is such a cool concept of a bank having a cafe and I love getting work done here.

You can sit at high tables or couches and regular tables or bean bags. Whatever you want, they'll probably have.

I'd find a little cafe with nice lighting and.. no outlets. Or a fun outdoor location with no bathroom for blocks. .. or decent wifi and the coffee was $12. \nThis place is spacious, not ever too crowded, made for working (big strip outlets on the tables) quiet but still has a buzz of background noise/music to keep you grooving through work.

I signed up with Capital One 360 Banking in February 2016 when I got tired of parking my savings at Wells Fargo and earning nothing but a petty 0.01%. It was insulting. I searched high and low for a bank or credit union that offered a minimum of 1%. For a bank to offer that in today's economy means no local branches and a completely online experience.\n\nSure, I was a little hesitant even at my age (30) to give all my money and send it \"online\" but I was reassured by it being Capital One and being FDIC insured. As a Capital One credit card customer for almost 15 years, I never had a bad experience with them and I was excited to move my banking with them. It wasn't until weeks after that I had my account that I noticed on their website that they had a Capital One Cafe in San Francisco, one of only 3 in California. \n\nCapital One Cafe is exactly what we need in 2017. Gone are the tellers and sleazy bankers and instead we have full-service ATMs, a fully functional Peet's Coffee, WIFI, and plenty of seating spread across three floors. It's welcoming as well as educational with financial workshops produced by Capital One. The bank does employ a few customer service reps to help anyone with Capital One financial products but I've never been bothered in any of my visits. It wasn't until today's visit that I explored the lower floor which has more seating and more importantly, restrooms, which I was unaware they had. \n\nIt's hard to complain about what Capital One is doing. It's what our generation needs and they are disrupting the business of banking by going online and I welcome it. My only complaint would be the ATMs seem to be a bit on the older side and not as fast as the competition but I think they will be upgraded in due time. Lastly, you can't complain about the 50% discount at Peet's by using any Capital One credit or debit card.\n\nWells who?\n\nAmbiance/Decor: 4/5\nFood: 4/5\nService: 4/5\nPrice: $\nOverall: 5/5\n\nPros:\n+ Full-service Capital One ATMs\n+ 50% off Peet's with Capital One credit or debit\n+ Plenty of seating spread across three levels\n+ Free WIFI\n+ Private conference rooms available for reservation\n+ Restrooms on lower floor\n\nCons:\n- ATMs are older technology \n- Closed on weekends", "author": "Alexander E."}

The elevator only works with a key card and if you're carrying  bunch of work files like I was it was a pain to go up the stairs (tho there is a security desk at the entrance level that may have been able to get it working for me to use but I didn't ask). And got a bit hot in the afternoon sitting up in the third floor.\n\nHowever I was able to sit there all day and get a bunch of work completed and all in all it is a great setup.", "author": "Nicole B."}

Sweet!  A large white chocolate mocha latte.  Surprisingly not too sweet, and tasted great with the waffles.  \n\nI really like this place.

Stopped on by one day to catch up with a friend and get some work done in the afternoon. Was going to buy a pb cookie and tea, when the friendly person behind the counter highly recommended I try this one slightly cheaper mini cupcake instead (which they only have on Thursdays I'm told) instead of the pb cookie. I'm gonna spoil the surprise for you - this sucker was like eating a moist Reese's Pieces, as it has a dollop of a denser peanut butter cake in the center of a chocolate cake with frosting and nuts on top. Hooray for successfully down-selling a customer, almost like spotting a unicorn! I'm going to have to try more of the creations of the company that supplies this place with baked goodies.\n\nFear not, weary office-less traveler, there were plenty of other laptop-wielding road warriors busy staring at screens scattered throughout the 3 floors of space (one is below ground, which also happens to be where the washroom and a conference room is). I love the bright open atmosphere, with the ample and varied seating arrangements, plenty of outlets, and free wifi. The wifi is also my only quibble, as it disconnects you every 30-60 min it seems, forcing you to re-login periodically. But that is a small annoyance to pay for a cafe that actually seems to welcome people working in it; It's not like I'm just crashing on one of their beanbags streaming netflix all day.\n\nThe cafe must be a bit of a loss leader for ING, what with it being so huge and in Union Square.

I need a spot to work outside of my house once a week, and Capital One 360 Caf\u00e9 is the best I've found. I feel uncomfortable squatting for long periods at many smaller cafes, where the manager is (rightfully) hoping to turn tables--there is only so much coffee I can drink. But this caf\u00e9 is inviting for people who need to get serious work done for several hours; it's huge, welcoming, and I don't feel like I'm taking up too much space.\n\nThings I like:\n- Three levels of seating, and it's all attractive, airy, and open. There are couches, tables for groups, high tops, little nooks, and places to sprawl. \n- Outlets EVERYWHERE.\n- Free WiFi\n- Clean bathrooms\n- Reasonably priced coffee, treats, and salads--even a vegan one!\n- Friendly employees\n- Top 40 Music. Taylor Swift, \"Temperature\" by Sean Paul--yes, yes, bring it on! I'm tired of the hipster music on rotation at every other caf\u00e9.\n\nOne thing I'm very curious about is the P&L for this venture. They surely can't be raking in enough money from the food and new Capital One accounts to justify the crazy-expensive real estate costs?!\n\nI hope to see more spaces designed for people who need a good spot to work.

Plus, they give you their already cheap drinks for half off if you use their card to purchase. As if the discounts weren't enough, the barista banker guy still gave me a bunch of free drink cards during one of my first visits that I still continue to use now. SCORE. \n\nThere are three stories with plenty of comfortable and diverse seating that range from shared work tables to private meeting rooms to bean bag chairs.

Though heads up, when you order they may encourage you to open an ING account~shocking! In fact the staff is so easy going here that they don't get upset if you come everyday, all day, use their internet, bring your own food, not buy anything, etc. They do a wonderful job of being welcoming and harboring a good working environment.

Alas we came across this place. What an interesting idea: combining both coffee and a financial corporation into it's very own coffee shop! Offering current and potential clients a \"shot of savings\" in their latte and also proudly serving Peets coffee (which we learned has a strong presence in San Francisco), we knew we had to check this place out.\n\nThe coffee joint itself is very large with 2 stories and has sort of a lofty, urban, vibe to it. It holds plenty of tables and open workspaces (varying sizes for people flying solo or in large groups), and encourages their clients to have meetings in the shop or catch up on some e-mails during your breaks. The clientele ranges from suits to hipsters to dorky tourists (ahem) so I don't think anyone can really feel out of place in here.\n\nThe service was very quick and cashier was friendly. The barista was also quick - no artwork on the latte though - but made a good drink. I ordered a mocha which was very rich in chocolate with a hint of espresso. I thought it was quite delicious and for something categorized as a \"small\" it was pretty big in size - also a decent price.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience at this coffee shop. The service was quick and efficient and the product (review based solely on the mocha!) was very good. I would definitely pop in again for a coffee the next time I'm in town and recommend others visiting SF to do the same.", "author": "Kat M."}

We came in for a quick snack and got lured into the $176 promotion if I signed up for a checking and savings account, and if my fianc\u00e9 referred me he would get a $40 bonus. It was 5 when we walked in and we left at 6 pm (when they closed) and I was furious. Thinking this would be a quick sign up we said okay. Well, I was so very wrong.\n\nI started setting up my savings account, only to find out I had to call their number to verify I was who I said I am. Even though I was physically there, with my ID. What was supposed to be a quick phone call turned into waiting on hold for 20 minutes to speak with someone. Fine, they verified my account and now it was time to set up my checking account. Well, even though I just went through the verification process on the savings account I had to do the exact same thing for the checking account, even though we were linking them. Another 20 minutes but this time the lady working there called, which led me to believe she might have been able to get through to someone sooner but nope, she just called the same number and waited. \n\nI had been talking to this lady and mentioned I just moved down from Canada. When she was telling me about the checking account she said I could have the overdraft option and I requested not to have it. If she had been paying attention, or knew how it worked she would have realized I needed a credit score in the states to qualify for the checking account. When they verified my account and tried to set it up I got rejected for no credit score. I've never needed a credit check for a basic checking account before, and my fianc\u00e9 says it's for the overdraft protection which I stated I did not want and she let me know it was optional. \n\nAfter that she just kind of brushed us off and it was time to close up, so I left. My savings account was opened and the $76 was in there but we realized she never put my fianc\u00e9's account number in so he didn't get a referral bonus. Then the withdrawal from my main banking account (you needed to connect it to capital one and have $500 in your new savings account to get the bonus) was rejected by my bank and that bonus was taken away from my Capitol one account without a chance to correct anything. \n\nSo overall an hour of my time was wasted, I left pissed off, the lady didn't do much or know much about how to help and I won't bother with Capitol one anymore.", "author": "Ayla W."}

Capital One needs to pay more attention to basic bank services than the coffee and the wifi. It does not function as a bank, at least, not on the day I visited. Spark and this cafe need a visit from a usability consultant. Being able to take deposits is one of the most basic things a bank is supposed to do, and having a resilient technology set-up to enable the basics is just as important. It freaks me out that bank systems are this tenuous. NOT reassuring.\n\nI am a Spark small business account customer. This cafe is all about supporting folks like us, right? I hoof it to this cafe, because it is my only means of depositing the first check my small business has received. Why? Because the Spark Business mobile app only supports i0S 8.0 or higher, and my phone only goes as high as 7.8. There is no mobile Web check deposit. I have to either buy a new phone, or hoof it. Since I like my $30/month iPhone plan very much, and didn't retire in my 30s by wasting money on stupid stuff, I'm not buying a new phone. So I go to the cafe, since I have this accidental business now, because taxes. Fine. \n\nI find all ATMs down. And there is no other way to deposit my check. There is no associate who can take my check, no other technology on-site to use to do it. One associate takes pity on me and offers me an employee iPad (set any security concerns with that aside for the moment). At least she tries. But oh, too bad, my check -- which is not even $7k, probably not unheard of for a month or so of work in San Francisco -- is too large to deposit, so I cannot use the employee iPad. \n\nSo I sit, and wait for the ATM repair to come, and who knows when that will actually happen.

Aside from the half-price coffee for capital one customers the space is very nice. It's clean and wide open, with various types of seating including bean bags. You can imagine this place like a free, communal startup office with super cheap coffee.\n\nSometimes the Capital One employees will ask you for feedback on the company or something in the cafe. They are all super friendly and will even make an effort to remember your name if you go in often enough. The place definitely feels like it's primary goal is to increase goodwill toward CapOne and not to sign up new customers. I went into one of these before I was a member and they weren't pushy at all.\n\nThis is also a great spot for impromptu meetings of two or three people.\n\nFive stars.

I'm unimpressed by cheap coffee and free lunches, but the diverse seating options visible from the street finally seduced me inside. In the hour I spent there, I reclined on bean bags and giant pillows, hung out at communal bar tables, and rearranged modular couches to suit myself. I found the art interesting enough to actually direct my seating choices, even enough to pull me from the cushion options to the standing counters. \n\nI did have to listen to a little speech about getting an account with Capital One, but the nice gal who delivered did so with no pressure and made me feel more welcome. One weird thing--when I paid for my drink, the barista just swiped my card. No pin. No signature. What's up with that? He didn't offer me a receipt either, and I didn't ask, so hypnotized by his super-friendly chitchat.\n\nCome to think of it, there was something vaguely cultish about the place. I'm talking about the friendliness, not the throw pillows. It's corporate cult, not hippie-California cult. It reminded me of the fabled employee lounges of the dot-com boom of the late '90s. The only thing missing was the ping pong table. \n\nWhen I made my security-and-receipt-free purchase, the barista did not offer me a wifi code. Since I changed seats so many times, it took my iPad and me a little while to figure out that I needed one. When I did realize it, I was very cozy in my perfectly arranged cuddly couch spot and really didn't want to get up and find a barista or a bank teller or whatever to help me with a code.

There is Capital One marketing all over the place, and a bit of the push to try their banking but it isn't too bad. I guess it is their \"experiential marketing\" to the tech/start-up demographic.

The food and coffee are just ok though, but it's so reasonably priced, you can't hold that against them. Also, be aware, the music is pretty random and the acoustics make for a constant din so bring your headphones if you can't work like that. Lastly, the staff here are super duper friendly, always.
