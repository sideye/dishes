{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-30", "description": "True story of how this review came to be: I was taking a workout class next door at BodyRok and I think that Slice House was baking a batch of pizzas...which should be illegal. Because all of the delicious aroma from baking a fresh batch of pizza wafted into the workout studio and when I was trying to hold one more plank or do one more crunch, all I could think about was the delicious smell of baking bread. I knew that I had to check out Slice House.\n\nSo a few days later when I was looking for something to munch on, I stumbled into Slice House. I had always heard of Tony's Pizza in North Beach so I was interested in trying his NY/Sicilian version in the Haight. There are a few regular types of pies available each day with one special Sicilian-style of the day. The slices are pretty pricy but they are very generously sized so sometimes I can even fill up on just one slice. My favorite is the Purple Haze--purple potato, pancetta, rosemary, pesto, feta, oregano, romano, and garlic oil. I know some people may cringe at the idea of potatoes on pizza...purple potatoes no less, but I love the addition! It's definitely a different flavor but the pancetta and pesto and herbs mixed with cheese just really pulls it all together! It's my go-to order!", "author": "Jess Y."}

Most of the photos of this place looked decent enough, the reviews I skimmed were good, and it's less than a mile from me so I thought I could count on a quick delivery for something I could've driven to in 5 minutes or walked to in 15. I ordered Pizza and a Salad and it came out to ~$45. Pretty steep, but I'll try it.\n\nAfter my order was an hour late I contacted GrubHub, because there's no way I'm aware of to get status on food without calling them. I spent about 20 minutes in chat with them for them to call my driver and have him say he was \"5 minutes away\". Um, the pizza place is 5 minutes away. Literally. When she told me this, I googled directions and it gave me a drive time of 4 minutes. By this time, I've been waiting for an hour and a half on an order that had a delivery estimate of 45-55 mins at a pizza place less than a mile from me. She offered me a credit for less than the cost of the tip I'd given when I ordered. Whatever, I just want my pizza.\n\nThe guy delivers it. The pizza is NOT in a hot bag and the lid is all popped up. He's wearing a motorcycle helmet. So he's delivering food on a motorcycle and, beyond that, it's not temperature-controlled. I'm super irritated and a little concerned that the lid wasn't fully closed when he handed it to me, but I'm starving. I go to eat the pizza. It's ice cold. There are a bunch of unexpected random loose fresh tomatoes in there; 2 on top of the pizza and the rest are congregated in a corner, like they slid off. I start to suspect that the delivery guy dropped it. I open my salad. The bag is crushed and the salad is upside down. The balsamic vinaigrette they included with it is a full 2 ounces of olive oil and about a half of a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. I taste the oil and it's of reasonable quality and not rancid like a lot of pizza places, but there's so little balsamic in there that it's never going to emulsify so it's pretty useless. I contacted GrubHub again to complain. My super-convenient pizza order I decided to pay $45 for out of a desire for comforting convenience? Well, it was a 2 hour ordeal, almost an hour of which was spent chatting with GrubHub support.\n\nSo now you're thinking, she's just giving a 2-star review because of a terrible delivery experience. Not so, gentle reader! Regardless of the coldness, the pizza is tough and mediocre -- It might've been worth 1 more star if it were hot. The crust was dry and had no depth of flavor (cardboard-y is coming to mind). The toppings were overloaded and dumped on in a way that was muddying. The parts of the salad I ate were OK and the cheese (some sort of Gorgonzola variant) was probably my favorite part. The ingredients themselves were of a reasonable quality, but there was no apparent care or attention to detail put into it. I was almost thinking about stopping by and giving them another shot to try actual HOT pizza from them, but then I saw some comments that the owner also owns the pizza place at The Market. I've tried two slices of the pizza they serve there and it was every bit as mediocre. I think it says  a lot (of not good things) about a restaurant group when everything of theirs tastes the same. At least they're consistent at delivering mediocre-negative experiences?\n\nRecommendation: Save your time, taste buds, and maybe some money too, by going somewhere else.\n\nSide rant:\nAre the people calling this NY pizza tourists who went to NY and ate at a Domino's or Sbarro's? I am genuiely baffled as to why people would review this as anything comparable to NY pizza.", "author": "Aly P."}

Alas, it was bound to happen: Tony's a conglomerate now with subsidiaries like Pizza Rock and Slice House popping up everywhere from here to Vegas. When he sticks to his original concept of wood-fire pizzas like he did with Tony's Pizza Napoletana and Capo's, he makes some mighty fine pies that linger in the palate as well as the memory. When the pizza is ready-made like a Cybelle's and just warmed in the oven, the art disappears.\n\nI was initially thrilled that Tony opened a spot in The Market on Market because that whole operation struck me as a hipsterish tech-head congregation area where working class flavors were verboten. There were a lot of pizzas on the menu and on display on pizza tins behind the lucite panels. The Picante looked good with serrano and banana peppers sitting alongside the linguisa, chorizo, and mozzarella cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/2oBeBnF). The Purple Potato had, yes, slices of purple potato, pancetta, and feta cheese drizzled with rosemary pesto oil in concentric circles (photo: http://bit.ly/2oNDhet). Carb overload. Pass. The Sicilian pizzas looked hefty but awfully tasty with all those ingredients piled on.\n\nThe Fratellanza must be the kitchen sink pizza of Palermo with pepperoni, salami, sausage and mushroom competing with all those cheeses on a square piece of doughy real estate (photo: http://bit.ly/2ogoRk2). Because the slices were only $6 a piece, I went for two slices, first the Meatball & Ricotta because it looked meaty and gooey (photo: http://bit.ly/2oNvE81). The second was the Funghi which combined hen-of-the-woods and crimini mushrooms with Kalamata olives (photo: http://bit.ly/2pmZPU2). Now the sad part: It tasted warmed up from the day before with overly chewy crust. In spite of the creative, once fresh ingredients, there was barely any difference between what they served here and what they package up at Cybelle's.

Even though I said I wasn't a fan of the thicker slices, I kinda liked this one... now if only it was on a thinner slice. Haha. I've also had their pepperoni pizza, it was pretty standard, a little greasy though. \n\nTheir fresh squeezed lemonade with mint was mind blowing though, it's extremely refreshing.

There's 8 different pizzas offered daily ($5.50 - $6 per slice): http://bit.ly/1XSE8Ty. Whole pizzas (20 inches) are also available. \n\nI ordered a slice of the Purple Potato Pizza: Grande shred mozzarella, purple potato, bacon, rosemary, pesto, feta, oregano, romano, garlic oil: http://bit.ly/231vQdu. I'm usually not a fan of carbs on carbs but I fell in love with Escape from New York's \"You Say Potato\" pizza when I first had it. Of course, Tony's rendition is a lot more refined with purple potatoes, feta, and smoky bacon. The crust had a good toothsome chew but was on the harder side so folding it was an issue. The pizza was a bit too oily from both the pesto and garlic oil. Then again, no one eats pizza for health.  \n\n$6 for one slice of pizza may seem steep but the slice was H-U-G-E (two slices worth) and very filling. It's a good deal for the Twitter building especially since the former pizza tenants were charging $16 for a terrible personal size pizza: http://bit.ly/26pbiQG. \n\nNo doubt Tony's Slice House is going to be a popular vendor at The Market, if not the most popular one.

Great pizza. Inventive choices, quality ingredients. Lots of love goes into this pizza and that alone qualifies it for at least a lunch stop. \n\nWhat I really wanted to write about today was the service, and attention to detail. My roommates and I decided to order a 20\" pepperoni pizza to bring back to our house for a night in. When our pizza was ready, the two women behind the counter brought the pizza out, opened it up, and asked us if we were satisfied with the doneness. They said that they had recently had some criticisms about the doneness/crispiness of their slices, so they wanted to make sure that we were satisfied. Turns out, we did actually put the pizza back in for an extra 5 minutes, but that made us leave with a more satisfying product (and oh boy was it.) \n\nI find that attention to detail and response to feedback very admirable for a small business. To directly implement feedback and go the extra mile (even at the cost of an extra few minutes of operational time) to make sure that their customer's pizza was perfect shows that this store is very well managed. \n\nWe'll continue going to Slice House more often than we should each week.

They ordered pizza slices, I ordered the veggie burger. After over 20min of waiting, I went back to the register to check on my food. I can only assume they'd forgotten about the order, because they asked for '3 more minutes.' (And disappointingly didn't offer anything else edible to make up for the wait.) In fact I waited almost 10 minutes more, and by the time I got my food (after nearly a half hour wait), my roommates were basically finished. And while the honey on the bun was a nice touch, the burger was most definitely a frozen patty--extremely disappointing for $12 plus tax. \n\nNot a good experience.", "author": "David Z."}

I'm not a fan of the pizza (yet) or the music (stuck in the early 00s) but the ambiance is good, the space is clean, the decor is cool, the staff is great, service was quick, and it's a big improvement over the previous tenant, \"Big Slice\", which was not great.\n\nThe food is so important and central in a new review, I'd really have given them 3 stars but that doesn't feel fair when I want to give them a chance and a running start, and I can see lots of potential. The menu is awesome. The \"Purple Haze\" slice that I had is a great concept -- super thinly sliced purple potatoes and pancetta over plenty of good quality cheese and pizza sauce on a crunchy thin crust. The two places it fell short: the star ingredients (potato and pancetta) were sliced so thin you most of the time can't taste them over the cheese; and the crust is really just a bit too crunchy, like almost cracker crunchy in places (all over, not just the edge) which is distraction when you're trying to enjoy chewy cheese and veggies and meat.\n\nSo, I'll be back and I don't plan to worsen my review unless they just don't live up. They get time to improve and I see major potential. But it was a little alarming to know that Tony's an established pro and I already didn't like my first slice even though the ingredients and concept were so right. I can chalk that up to equipment adjustment and staff practice and I'll be back!", "author": "Eric O."}

The hostile attitude we received by the first lady (rolling eyes; attitude as if we're wasting her time; huffing and puffing because we're deciding what to order, even though there was no one behind us), before we even uttered a word, was so prevalent that the second twin had to step forward after an uncomfortable silent whole minute.

I arrived just after opening at 11am and tried out a cheese slice and a Grandma slice. The verdict: solid -- much better than the Slice House at AT&T Park, but not quite up to the standards of the North Beach original. The slices were a bit dry -- surprising, as they had just come out of the oven. However, the tomato sauce on the Grandma slice was as amazing as the sauce at the other locations, and the very fact they offer Sicilian-style Grandma pizzas will forever cement Tony's place among my pantheon of favorite pizza places.\n\nWord on the street is that this Slice House will introduce its full menu soon, and I look forward to a return visit for more lunchtime pizza goodness.", "author": "Eric L."}

I ordered the Cal Italia pizza for delivery. I gotta say, it was tasty and it had so much promise, the ingredients seem to work well together. I have to give only 3 stars because it took 2 hours to arrive and it was ice cold when I got it. The cheese had that cold pizza congealed texture, so I had to re-heat the pizza before I ate it. Prosciutto doesn't do that well when you run it through a toaster oven. It loses its tender texture and all that nice marbling just renders down to grease. I wish I could have tasted this pizza fresh, and I will definitely do that in the future, at which time I will update my review. FYI they made it right and (through GrubHub) refunded my order.

I asked to purchase a soda after deciding from the many already cooked pizzas she showed me the selection and I asked for a can (not bottle) but before I could tell her which flavor/brand she sharply exclaimed \"but what kind!!\" It was pretty degrading to do that in font of a fully packed pizzeria. She then gave me the receipt to sign as I reviewed my purchase and was about to begin to sign for the pizza slice and can of soda she quickly jerked her head at me and looked down at the area to sign for the charge (the same area where a tip can be included) and  checked to see if I was leaving a tip or not. I thought she was the manager so I would think that she would need to worry so much about if I was tipping or not (which I did) but it felt very much like it was forced. $13 for a slice of pizza and a can of Coke seem a bit over priced not to include the bad customer service skills but the cashier was out of control.\nI wont ever be back and will be emailing the owner of the chain.

Ordered a slice of the pepperoni because the pie in the display case was still whole and I assumed it would be at least somewhat more freshly made than the other options. \n\nAlas, it was *incredibly* greasy. Even after using several napkins to blot my slice, I still had grease dribbling onto my hand while eating it.

I think I went through at least a dozen napkins and felt wasteful about it but yeah, it was THAT oily.\n\nThe crust was actually quite good -- not soggy at all despite all the grease on the surface. That was the best part and why I'm giving them two stars instead of one. The pepperoni tasted off (had an unpleasantly stale/oxidized flavor). \n\nThe tomato sauce was just okay. I'm not a fan of oregano and I tasted too much. I prefer a cleaner, brighter, fresher tomato sauce than what I got in my slice. There was also too much cheese, at least in the sense that the cheese/sauce ratio was out of whack (based on my own personal preferences, anyway). I ended up picking a bunch of the cheese off. \n\nI may give Slice House one more chance based on the quality of the crust, but if I do, I'll go to a different location next time and choose a slice with different toppings.", "author": "Maya B."}

We were looking for a pizza place on Haight Street and stumbled across this place's excellent reviews online. Not only did it live up to the hype, but it far exceed our expectations. The pizza was insanely delicious (and that's saying a lot seeing as I was born & raised in NY haha). Also, everything is house made, including their delicious homemade ranch dressing. The environment was quaint, but cool & quirky, and the young woman taking our orders seemed to genuinely love her job & the quality of the food. I definitely recommend this place!", "author": "Meghan S."}
