This isn't a legit taqueria. This ain't no Mission burrito. This is a sorry excuse for Mexican, and a serious threat to your health.\n\nI'm about to break it down:\n\nRed salsa is greasy, green salsa needs avocado and more spice. Slow down, I'm 100% Mexican, which gives me license to drop these truth bombs. I'll continue. Employees have an attitude. They look annoyed, as if you're doing them a favor by eating there. There's a blonde gentleman that usually takes the orders, and he's guaranteed to mix things up. Have them repeat your order. Twice. If he's not there, that place isn't run professionally. Case and point, my visit with my toddler, on 5/31/18. We drop in about 1:30p. I order for both my daughter and myself. The gentleman that brings our food has a glove on only one hand, which I immediately find strange,  as he's carrying another dish in his un-gloved hand. He drops our entrees off, then proceeds to bus all of the dirty tables, followed by him entering the food preparation area and picking up more entrees for guests. Still with the same dirty glove on. He drops them off at their respective tables. With the same dirty-ass glove on. I mention this to the lady at the cash register, who appears to also be filling the manager role. I tell her it's not a safe practice and he needs to remove his one glove and wash his hands after bussing dirty tables, before picking up guests' food. She agrees to talk to him. She does, then he removes his dirty glove and happily prepares his own lunch at the food preparation area-without washing his hands prior to doing so. If I needed a sign that none of my message had landed with the manager, it came quickly. She takes a new client's order, rings him up, heads straight to the food preparation area without washing her hands, grabs a tortilla and throws it on the grill, patting the tortilla several times, heads to the dining area to bus tables (as ALL of the employees are taking their lunch (this never happens when the gentleman I mention above is acting as the manager), buses tables, heads jack to the food preparation area without washing her hands after handling two tables-worth of dirty dishes, and continues to grab the tortilla off the grill with her bare hands and hands the dude his hepatitis A burrito. WT-----! Seriously, no concept of cleanliness, sanitation, germ and disease transmission! \n\nThey wear a glove in one hand to give the impression that they understand cleanliness and disease transmission prevention. The above clearly paints a very different picture. I. Rest. My. Case. And for the record, I'm a nurse. I know a little something about disease transmission/prevention.", "author": "Gabriela W."}

The clear canopy lets in the sunshine but keeps the wind at bay. You order along the assembly line and folks bring the food to you once you paid. Service is decently friendly. While the menu is unremarkable, The Iron Cactus is good for groups with something for everyone from salads to tacos to platters. It's also nice that they have \"baby\" burritos which I found to be quite decently sized for lunch. \n\nYou'll get cheaper beers in nearby bars but to sit out in the sun with a brewski makes the slight premium at The Iron Cactus worth it.

I keep telling myself to try another taqueria but deep down I know I probably will not be able to find anyplace this tasty and affordable. One Taco Tuesday night while feeling particularly glutenous I ordered 2 tacos of each of their 7 meat choices to split with my bf. We were both beyond stuffed at the end of the meal; where else in SoMa can get two people that full for $14? Now I just stick with 4-6 tacos for a meal that is still very filling. \n\nMy favorite of the meat choices is the Al Pastor (bbq pork) the tender flavorful pork with sweet tart chunks of pineapple is the best. Next would probably be the Chorizo, one time it was a bit salty but it was still delicious. All of the meats are great I think the only one that I didn't find awesome was the  Pollo Roja (red chile chicken?). \n\nAlso, the staff has been really great; friendly and patient with complicated orders. This has been the one place that when I asked for something without one component they asked what I would like to substitute it with. This may be weird to say but the older lady there always seems to be in a good mood (smiling and what not) and it is super adorable. \n\nLet's see what else; the Horchata is really really good as well creamy, sweet, refreshing, and a nice counterpoint to spicy and salty tacos. The super nachos were really good and can be a meal for two.\n \nAll in all this place is awesome like as good as it gets awesome for the location and price.

The lady takes it back and I see her just take the shrimp off my plate and try to reserve the plate to me. So I told the lady I didn't want it and would like my money back. She told me she wouldn't give me my money back, so I asked to see the manager. I explained everything to the manager and he took care of it. Gave me my money back and brought me my correct order. So I thought everything was good, right? \n\nThen the next time I went there the same lady who wouldn't give me my money back was at the cashier. I ordered a burrito and right when I was about to pay she switched with someone else and went to talk to the other ladies who was making the food and they all looked back and smiled at me. Something is up right? So my order number is 50 and I see them making all the food (because it's made in the front) and I hear 47, 48, 49 and I see that they took my burrito to the back. The same sneaky lady saw me see that whole thing happened and then asked for my order number when they brought my burrito out from the back! And I didn't say anything back to her and then she called out 37! Can you believe that? This bitch was about to give me fucked up food they did in the back. So, I just cancelled my order and got my money back. SHADY ASS LADY AND WORKERS!", "author": "stacy t."}

I canceled the chips and salsa and came out to $24. When I got my receipt I was charged for a large salsa for $3. I questioned why that was on my bill since I canceled any salsa I ordered and she rolled her eyes and gave me my $3 back.

I expected a quick and simple order/sit down transaction that I would get at any neighborhood taqueria in the city but left frustrated with the complications of this establishment. \n\nThe cafeteria-style ordering process seemed great for me -- \"get it and go\" was what I had expected. Unfortunately, this seemed to me the longest and most disappointing restaurant experience that I'd had in a while. At checkout, the cashier (manager on duty) rung me up thrice for the wrong order! My order was apparently taken down incorrectly by the lady at the counter, and the manager called her out on writing the wrong order front of me and the rest of the line; I found this really unprofessional, as he could have just as easily quietly adjusted my order. \n\nI waited for my order for a good 15-20 minutes before the manager assured me that it'd be out soon. He came back with a plate for me and scurried off quickly before I could even catch that I was given the wrong order! What is going on in this place?! \n\nI brought my food back to the counter and was passed off from server to server and ignored for my refund request by the cashier before I located the manager next door at The Creamery to fulfill my request.

Weaving through traffic, I managed to find a decent parking spot right near The Iron Cactus and dashed in for my meeting and some tacos.  As it turns out, it was Taco Tuesday and $1 tacos sounded divine.\n\nWhile the meeting went really well and opened my eyes to the many challenges that startups face, the food disappointed like mad.  I ordered 3 of their Taco Tuesday specials with carne asada, pollo asada, and carnitas.  Topped with only raw onions and cilantro, the tacos were extremely bland and the onions were really overpowering.  Even topped with two of their salsas didn't seem to improve them.  They may only have been $1, but I'm not sure they were worth that much.  The other menu items were significantly more expensive but after trying their popular tacos, I can't really figure out why they are so.\n\nThe location is really convenient if you work in the SOMA area especially since it is right next to the Caltrain station.  They've got cheap drinks and a super dog-friendly patio too.  People bring their pets out all the time so you know it's a popular spot for the pooches.

The waiter apparently is used to this and smiled benignly as we ran around gathering up what we needed for eating.\n\nThe final straw, for me at least, was that they tried to kill me. Literally.

Judging from my experience, I have a feeling it's somewhere in between, but I say give it time to get better since the owner seems to be trying hard to become a casual place for locals and Caltrans commuters looking for California-accented Mexican food and beer on tap. \n\nI was there with Jamie W. for a local community get-together, so I may not have had the most unbiased experience since we were fortunate enough to get a small sampling of several dishes. I admit I didn't feel anything was a complete standout, but a few were on their way to pretty darn good. The $5.25 Ceviche Tostada was a nice treat with shrimp piled high with cilantro on big tortilla chips. The one drawback was that they were a bit too lemony to be completely satisfying.\n\nI also tried their $5.95 Baby Burritos, nicely palm-size and packed full of carnitas, rice, beans, salsa and sour cream. The $4.95 Cheese Quesadillas were definitely on the greasy side, but gooey cheese is hard to resist in any shape, and the $3.50 Soft Asada Taco was tasty but messy to pick up.

My excitement was short-lived though.\n\nI had lunch here on Friday morning.  I managed to get in just before the crunch of the lunch time masses.  You order at the counter and you're given a number.  You pay and you wait for your number to be called.  I had been watching how some of the items were being prepared and I noticed the regular burrito was only slightly larger than a baby burrito.  I ordered a Crispy Taco plate with pollo asado (grilled chicken).  Rice, choice of beans and a green salad come with the tacos.  As is my norm I chose the whole black beans although it was interesting to see that they offer refried black beans in addition to the regular refried beans.\n\nThe person that takes your order is the person that prepares your food.  The wait for my food was fairly short.  For take out orders I notice they use biodegradable utensils.  You can also use metal utensils if you're eating in.  The interior is very nice with lots of wood tones.\n\nMy taco plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZIe-mxk6KWq_ht1jcQ_pAg?select=uW_66S5sI52FAQpT5UtmHA) looked pretty good.  My food preparer put lots of chicken meat into the crispy taco shells, but she forgot to give me cheese.  Sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo (salsa) come on the plate along with the rice, salad and beans.  The chicken was all big chunks of warm, tender, moist chicken breast.  The orange colored seasoning on the chicken was not well defined though and the chicken just tasted bland.  I added parts of my salad, which is served plain with a small lemon wedge, into the taco shell along with the sour cream, the guac and the salsa.\n\nI like chunky guacamole and the avocado here is whipped up too smoothly.  It kind of just ran off of the taco shell instead of staying put.  The Spanish rice mixed with peas and corn was just slightly warm too.  The place is still new so I kind of expect some of the shortfalls.  I'll definitely come back again.  For now they're still better than Victor's but very average.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

They don't have too much cheese, but they have a ton of black beans, chopped tomatoes and onions, and sliced jajalpenos. So, they're pretty healthy nachos. That might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I like the fact that they're not smothered in cheese. \n\nThese nachos cost $4.50 for a huge plate of them, so it's a pretty good deal. But if you add meat, guacamole and sour cream and make your nachos super, the cost jumps to $8.75! I can see how people would be disappointed after ordering that, especially since I've heard the meat here wasn't very good. (I've never tried it since I always get the basic nachos).\n\nI think most of the items on their menu are overpriced ($5.50 super taco? $8.50 for a burrito?!)

The unassuming exterior belies the soaring ceilings and brick walls inside:  while not exactly \"cozy,\" the space is homey - warm, inviting, and clean.\n\nLet's get it straight:  Iron Cactus is not competing with dive Mexican places in The Mission.  Situated in South Beach, it caters to more refined tastes than the traditional taqueria at 16th and Mission.  Yes, the offerings may not be as spicy as El Farolito or Pancho Villa, but they are also not as greasy, nor as dangerous to your health - organic and sustainable where possible, the establishment uses ingredients that won't kill you.\n\nThe menu sticks to the basics:  burritos, tacos, quesadillas, etc.  There is nothing inventive here, and it is just as well.  In a setting such as this, diners are looking for tried and true favorites, not foamed creations from Ferran Adri\u00e0 from El Bulli.\n\nPatrons cannot go wrong with any of the burritos, quesadillas, or salads from Iron Cactus:   as in any Mexican restaurant worth its salt, you choose your meat, choose your tortilla, choose your beans, and choose your level of spiciness.  The result is pure Americanized, Mexican goodness.  Yes, not as spicy as some. Yes, not as greasy as some.  Yes, not as Hispanic as some.  But, hey, this is South Beach, not The Mission.\n\nA burrito de pollo asado was quite tasty.  Yes, even though ordered \"picante,\" it could have been spicier, it was still good.  Chicken Caesar was great:  crispy Romaine lettuce, spicy pollo asado, and light dressing.  Quesadilla de camarones tipped the tabnels at \"awesome\" - lots of shrimp, good cheese to shrimp ratio, not overcooked. \n\nHappy hours rock:  cheap beer and cheap tacos. Need I say more?\n\nService es muy bueno:  everyone is polite, service-oriented, and just all around nice.  Drinks consists of sodas, beers (both by the bottle and on tap), and some wines.\n\nWant greasy, cheap Mexican food?  Go to The Mission.

Maybe I have just had a bad week of eating out, but coming to the Iron Cactus for lunch really resonated with me in a poor fashion. I work in SOMA so coming here was moreso a decision of convenience than of desire to try their food. \n\nFirst of all, it is like the pricey version of Chipotle - they have a rice/beans/proteins/veggies/sauces bar that is out for hours... but $15 for a chimichanga that was subpar? No thank you. The ambiance is cool for watching sports - take note - they have wooden benches, but the prices they charge are ludicrous for mediocre Mexican. I am a SoCal native, so I have been raised on authentic Mexican food my whole life - and not only does this lack authenticity, it lacks flavor, period.\n\nFunny thing is, their food comes out fast (probably because it's been sitting behind the counter waiting for the hungry lunch crowd), but LUKEWARM! Their service is really lackluster, and to add insult to injury, they have a TIP JAR - bad service + feeling entitled to tips??? Sorry Charlie.\n\nI would much rather go to the Mission, order a delicious, reasonably priced burrito and give them a tip. Not only would I receive paramount service, but I'm sure the food would actually taste good. \n\nI may go back one more time since I work in the area, and am keen on second chances, but definitely not a place I would recommend.

I immediately wrote this place off as an overpriced, overambitious Cali-Mexican place that overcharges because of its prime location. HOWEVER, the person taking orders muttered my two favorite words in the English language...Happy Hour.\n\nHappy Hour 3-6 every day: huge tacos for $2, 20oz beer for $3, appetizers for $3. The beer selection is pretty legit: I recall Sam Adams, Stella Artois, Anchor Steam, Fat Tire and Sierra Nevada. I went for a carne asada taco with spicy salsa and an al pastor taco with mild salsa. Grand total: $4.65 with tax. The cashier was very friendly, even making a point to with me happy holidays. He did inform me, however, that chips are not included with my order.\n\nBut anyway, they brought out my tacos, and I was blown away. They are HUGE. I'd say the tacos here are between 1/3 and 2/5 the way to being a normal-sized burrito. They have all the burrito necessities: rice, beans, meat, sour cream and salsa (another review says you can get lettuce for no extra charge...I'll definitely hit that up next time). They're hard to eat as tacos because of the sheer amount of rice, beans and meat, so I got a fork and got to work.\n\nThe carne asada and al pastor were both very tasty. Sure, the carne asada was not 100% consistent across the board, and when I first tasted it I couldn't taste barely anything, but when I focused and looked for the taste, I found it and I liked it. The al pastor was even better; nice mix of spices, tender, consistent...I really enjoyed eating it.\n\nThe salsa here is tasty, but in no way is it spicy. The mild is a joke, and the 'hot' salsa is what mild salsa would be at a real Mexican place. I'm really confused as to these people who say they eat spicy food but thought this place was too spicy. The spiciest thing they have is the green salsa they have on the tables, which is somewhere between mild and hot at a real Mexican place. I don't get it.\n\nSelf-serve water is a huge plus. 'Nuff said.\n\nThe take-away: the happy hour here is great. Two huge tacos and a 20oz beer for $7? If I'm ever at the office late, this is gonna be one of my go-to places.", "author": "Geoff L."}

So what the hell, I was hungry and curious.\n\nSmelled pretty good but as I approached the sneeze shield I saw what could only be described as GROSS hunks of dried out meat sitting in warming trays.

I really want to find a decent burrito experience by my crib.\n\nCome on Iron Cactus, don't be afraid to throw out food at 8pm that's been sitting out since lunch. Seriously.

This was one of the more expensive burritos I've seen in the city, yet was one of the smallest and least filling.  The carne asada did not taste grilled at all.  They also take your order and then reappear with a burrito after a while.  I saw they were overwhelming the burritos with rice, so I asked for a little bit of rice instead.  There was none in there at all.  Just let me direct the assembly of my burrito so that it comes out how I want it.\n\nSalsa bar was minimal, but decent.  Chips that came with the burrito were probably the most well done part of the meal.  No need to go back to this one.

I've driven by Iron Cactus several times and it's in my hood, so could get it and take it to go.  Parking on the street, right in front, so let's give it a try.\n\nBig menu board when you enter.  Lots of choices.  I only had 11 minutes of parking so no long decisions.  I ordered the Burrito with steak, and a side of quacamole.  The lady took my order down and handed me a receipt to take to the cashier.\n\nTurns out she didn't give me a side of guacamole.  She gave me a small appetizer portion, which was $6.50.  I asked the lady to take it off, but now she conveniently doesn't speak English and I had a horrible time explaining to her that I wanted a side of guac, which was only $1.50.  After 2 minutes, I relented and paid for this as she didn't know how to take it off the bill!  A burrito, chips, salsa and guac and a can of coke for $16.60.\n\nFood in hand, I was frustrated and left and thought maybe the guac, chips and salsa, along with my burrito, would be OK.  I got it home and opened the box which had the chips, salsa and guac.  It was cold, like it had come out of a refrigerator.  The guac was some green concoction that I'd buy in a box at Safeway, not what I'd expect from a mexican restaurant.  The chips tasted day-old, and who likes cold chips?  Not me.  Presentation sucked too, as the guacamole and salsa was splattered all over the chips in the box.\n\nThe burrito.... who has a burrito without cheese?  Stupid me for assuming a burrito will have cheese. It had lots and lots of rice, and a paltry amount of beef.  I ate it, but I'd barely call it food.\n\nIn closing, save your money and go to taco bell, because you'll get better mexican food there.  Don't go to Iron Cactus.  The food is horrible!

That's saying something, given that Iron Cactus is owned by the same folks who own The Creamery next door, the staff of which damn near busts the Churlish-o-meter.\n\nIn some respects, our little dinner group have only ourselves to blame for our experience.  Before we even paid for our food, before we even finished our orders, there were several warning shots fired across our collective bow.  Did we heed them?  Nay!  Damn the flavorless burrito-shaped torpedoes, full speed ahead!\n\nGuy takes our order (friendly, as I said).  Warning shot #1: he wrote down my order and my girlfriend's order once for the kitchen, then spent a solid minute rewriting it on a second piece of paper, which he gave to us to take to the cashier.  Note there was no one else in line, so why we couldn't just order directly from the guy behind the counter is a mystery.   All ahead full!!!\n\nWarning shot #2: by the time we got to the register, there were two women in front of us explaining the approximately 47 things that had gone wrong with their order.  Steady, into the breach!!!\n\nWarning shot #3: as we sat down, guy at the table next to us took one bite of his food, doused himself in gasoline, lit a match, and ran screaming from the restaurant down 4th Street, ultimately flinging himself in front of a speeding Baby Bullet.\n\nOk, I made that one up.\n\nFood arrives.  And sure enough, 3 of the 4 orders were wrong.  Plus, I paid $4 for an order of guacamole that never arrived.  My fish tacos were beyond bland (think tilapia sauteed with nothing but green onions) and slightly undercooked.  I'll usually eat anything you put in front of me, but this was one of the few times I literally couldn't touch my food.  It was inedible.  My girlfriend felt the same about her burrito.\n\nSpeaking of the burrito, she ordered the \"small\", and got a \"large.\"  When we asked why, the waiter said, and I quote: \"oh, when you order the small you get the large anyway.\"  Ladies and gentlemen, we are officially through the Iron Cactus looking glass.\n\nA few minutes later, a different poor waiter came over to our table to ask how we were doing.  We were as nice as possible as we ran through our own list of the approximately 47 things wrong with our meal (seeing a pattern here?)  As we proceeded (with utmost politesse) through the litany, he literally started backing slowly away from our table, smiling embarrassedly and nodding.  By the time my friend asked for black beans rather than refried, I think the waiter had backed all the way to Harrison Street.  At the rate he was going, he's probably well past Sacramento at this point.  Hopefully finding work at a decent burrito joint.\n\nConclusion: the guy had been going through this all day and had reached his breaking point.  He never came back, and the meal was such a disaster that we didn't bother hunting him down.  We felt bad for him.\n\nMama always told me, if you don't have anything nice to say....but Mama grew up before there was Yelp, and before they opened Iron Cactus.", "author": "Chris L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-18", "description": "Hi, I'm Christina and this is my first Yelp.\n\nI'm a longtime Yelp lurker who has been siphoning all kinds of information from you wonderful people for years yet I've never felt compelled to contribute by writing a review.  I always figured someone else would shoulder the burden of finding the best happy hour specials or late-night sushi delivery.  I never thought any place I had gone to was extremely bad or good enough to merit another review.  I'm only telling you these things so you will know what a momentous occasion this first review is -- and so you will understand how strongly I feel about the experience I had at the Iron Cactus.\n\nI initiated our small group's Friday evening dinner experience with hesitation because of the abysmal reviews thus far.  I so wanted a local Mexican joint that wasn't Chava's down the street (sorry Chava's).  I so wanted the Yelpers to be collectively wrong, their standards for a newly opened restaurant to be too high, the food to be, in truth, edible.  Lesson learned: heed the warning of 2.5 stars from 62 reviews less than a month after opening.\n\nTalking points:\n\n* Complete confusion in the order line.  Where does the line start?  Who takes our order?  Why is the hot food abandoned to the cold drafts from the constantly-opening door?  How can so many menu options be presented so inexplicably?  The entire ordering  & payment process begs for a do-over.\n\n* You know that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach when you realize something is about to go horribly wrong, just as you've predicted?  That's the feeling I had as I watched the customers in front of us mill about confusedly at the cash register, attempting to order drinks/sides, correct their orders, or explain the problems with their meals.  That sinking feeling grew more intense as I watched about 8 employees attempting to address the problems without much success.\n\n* The food.  Sweet lord, the food.  Bland, bland, bland!  Lukewarm.  Almost entirely unseasoned and of suspect quality.  As I said to the group that night, I grew up in Vermont and am quite forgiving of bad Mexican food.  I was completely put off by my 6 dollar burrito filled with tasteless rice and sub par meat (I wouldn't even try my boyfriend's sad-looking little fish taco or my friend's \"crispy\" taco with a shell that looked as though it came straight from an Old El Paso box via the microwave) and the fact that I could find no redeeming qualities in any of this food says a lot.\n\n* The mistakes.  I was floored.  My boyfriend ordered a side of guacamole that never materialized.  3 of our 4 orders had something wrong, from run of the mill errors like the wrong kind of beans to pretty unforgivable grievances like serving the wrong kind of taco altogether.  But the final nail in the Iron Cactus coffin was that our waiter, upon asking how we were doing (big mistake, buddy), listened to us explain our problems then pulled a disappearing act the likes of which I've never seen.  Not a single one of our many issues was addressed.  I felt bad for him because he's probably been dealing with this crap since the day he started -- but that doesn't mean I don't want that 5 dollars worth of guacamole you forgot.\n\n* The menu.  Take a look at it on their website (http://ironcactussf.com/menu.php) and you'll start to understand what's going on here.  Spelling and punctuation errors (they sure do like their apostrophes) everywhere.  The chart of order options is mind boggling.  You've got to learn to crawl before you can walk.   \n\nI beg you Iron Cactus:  take these reviews seriously and shape up.  You have the potential to bag so many loyal customers at this location, and I would have been one of them had you served me anything even close to what I can get for a lower price in the Mission, with even a modicum of precision in your service.  And if there's anyone out there who is reading this and thinking  \"Meh, I shall eschew the Yelp collective's early impressions and will strike out on my own to try this place because for ME it will be different\" I beg *you*:  save your money and wait it out.", "author": "Christina M."}

It is a great investment. Brilliant business move. Slap in the face to the integrity of San Francisco's commitment to creative and thoughtful (and well executed) cuisine.\n\nNo salsa bar. No selection of frescas. The one salsa they did give out with their chips (that were admittedly, delicious) was mixed like an hour beforehand... so the flavors hadn't permeated and it just tasted amateur.\n\nOh- and their guacamole- TOTALLY cheater/cheapie taqueria guac, with expensive avacados thinned-out by cheaper sour-cream.\n\nShame on the owners, for taking advantage of such a perceptibly easy cuisine and filling an incredible restaurant space with such horribly un-inspired and bland food. \n\nI really wanted to pan them in this review- but unfortunately for that interest, the service was incredibly quick given how slammed they were when I went in... everyone was all smiles, and the owners did seem really nice.

Their rice had corn, peas and carrots, which is something I'm not used to, but it didn't really bother me. It wasn't rolled evenly but the size was decent. It came with complimentary chips and pico de gallo (which were actually good). \n\nIt's not bad, but it's far from being the best taqueria in the city.

As someone who is hyper-critical of Mexican food, the Iron Cactus ranks pretty high, and it is the ONLY place to get a good burrito in the neighborhood, period.  I've been going to Chavos since the mid-90's and will never step foot in the place again, now that Iron Cactus has opened. That's 2-3 meals a week, if not more!\n\n\n- FLAVOR: I do agree with a number of reviews that the food could be a bit more flavorful or spicy, but give them more than the two months they've been open and the flavors will grow better.  If you think restaurants are all perfect they day they open, then you've been living in TV-land. \n\n- PRICE: Compared to taquerias like Pancho Villa, the prices are high.  When you throw in the fact that the vegetables are all organic, it only makes sense that the prices are higher.  Still, paying 9+ dollars for a burrito is painful.  \n\n- SERVICE: Amazing.  The employees are always smiling and saying hello.  After two times there they remembered me.  That makes a huge difference.  I noticed some posts about how confusing the layout of the place is, but it seemed pretty simple to me.  Also, the place has been open for all of two months, so the owners are there, and sometimes take an order or two.

You can order yours spicy or mild, and they put the salsa on the side.  Since ours was to go, I asked if they had a salsa bar - and they don't.  There are two types of salsa on each table, so I was given a container to fill up the salsa.\n\nAs I read in some reviews, beware of the spicyness of the salsa.

It's about 2 short blocks away from China Basin. There is another place down the block however it is pretty crappy. Ill write a review for that place when I have time. It is going to be full of lulz.  Anyways..the only thing I ever get is the Super burrito bowl. I phone in my order and by the time I get there (around 10 mins)..it is ready. Show my badge and I get a discount. HOLLA. The Burrito bowl comes with chips. They have some spicy sauce in a bottle by the counter. I grab that and give my burrito bowl a quick splash.

We originally called around to Taqueria Cancun, Pancho Villa, El Farolito (the usual places for mexican in SF) but I didn't get a good feeing about placing such a large order with them, I wasn't sure if they could handle it or even have a system in place to remember my order and I wasn't going to risk not having food at my party so I called Iron Cactus... Ivor was fantastic! He was so gracious, helpful with selections and ordering the right amount of food and amazingly accommodating and trusting. He really made it so easy for us to have an awesome taco bar spread. Everyone LOVED the food and in fact, we had sooo much leftover because of the Iron Cactus generous portions that people got to take some food home. Literally 3 dishes of everything for 40 people at a totally reasonable price because Ivor is such a strong supporter of the SOMA community!! Great, great deal. We ordered chicken steak and veggie tacos with all the sides and everything was really tasty, fresh, not overcooked (even though the quantities were large trays) Highly recommend Iron Cactus for catering or for just good mexican food.

Most of the scathing remarks I wanted to make were made in other reviews, I'm going to give The Iron Cactus some free consulting:\n\n1) Move people through line single file.  See point (2) to understand how that might be possible.\n2) Organize your ingredient in the order a burrito is made.  Notice in most restaurants, they put the cheese and the burrito first, and then the fixin's in order.  That way, people can move down the line single file.\n3) Eliminate the slips order tickets.  No one needs to write down an order like \"burrito on whole wheat with chicken and cheese.\"  Write the type of burrito on the foil with an indelible pen or stick a colored toothpick into the finished burrito.  Note that (2) facilitates this.\n4) Stop bringing burritos to the table.  Not only will you no longer need to employ the cute spiky-blond-haired runner to bring the burrito to my table, but you'll have customers who sit down with food.  Note that (3) is prerequisite for this.\n5) Get rid of both of those dreadful salsas you have at the table.  The green one is too hot to have any taste and I've never tasted a more watery, bland roasted tomato salsa. See (11).\n6) Put less rice into your burritos.  It's starchy, bland filler.  See (11) again.  Actually, go directly to (11) right now and memorize it as a mantra.\n7) When you make a burrito with cheese, put it in a steamer to melt the cheese onto the burrito.  No one likes hard, cold cheese in the middle of their burrito.\n8) Chips should not be extra: the cost of throwing a few chips onto someone's plate is minimal. (See (9) for clarification)\n9) Source your chips from a quality chip manufacturer.  Yours tasted like a step above Doritos.\n10) Take The Card (i.e., American Express).  Don't give me the crap about their fees: it's a cost of doing business.\n11) Put some flavor and spice into your food.  None of the food was \"bad,\" but newspaper has more flavor. Cilantro, chilis, peppers, pepper, salt, lime, etc. . . try 'em out.\n12) \"Super\" option, please! \n\n(bonus) 13) Visit a joint like Mexico au Parc or Victor's with a notebook and copy down exactly what they do.", "author": "Mark J."}

A friend recommended this place to me and I'm really glad he did.  It is walking distance to the ballpark which is really convenient in case you are on your way to a show or a game...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-10-21", "description": "Here's the deal:\n\nMexican food as we Americans know isn't true Mexican---it's strictly watered down for the Gringos.  True Mexican food is very complex, yet at the same time very simple and clear.\n\nThat said, it's good to see Iron Cactus in the neighborhood, because it is just one more place to eat around the SOMA/Ballpark area, and it's another takeout option, which are scarce.  The area has Fine Dining locked down, but on the rare occasions that I'm not cooking, takeout comes up short for me.\n\nThe space is warm and inviting, large, slightly cavernous, lot's of rustic wood furnishing, high, wooded beam ceilings, polished concrete floors, complete with scattered tables and a long communal table in the center.  Dimly lit, with flowers scattered here and there, which as a florist, I'm happy to see,  a large chalk board is scratched with the standard menu as well as the specials.\n\nAs this was the first day open, and I arrived 30 minutes before closing, I'd say it was relatively bug-free for the first day,  the service was fast and very friendly.  \n\nHowever, the food does need a bit of work; I ordered the Crispy tacos ($3.50) which comes with your choice of meat, beans,rice, sour cream and salsa.  I chose the spicy chicken which was tender and pleasantly pulled and stringy, but was very bland for a spicy selection.  I expected the shells to be rustic, handmade corn shells, and whole thing deep-fried (similar to what they do at Dona Tomas's Tacubaya in Berkeley) but the shell I presume was pre-purchased and perhaps flash-fried, but it wasn't objectionable; thin and crisp, with a satisfying crunch, but can get soggy quickly from the whole beans (black) and the salsas and cream.  As I don't drink soda, and only drink beer unless I plan on getting laid, a nice fruity Zinfandel from Santa Cruz, from a vineyard I knew I wasn't going to remember complimented the tacos nicely.\n\nMy friend had the spicy chicken Enchilada plate (10.50) which was tasty, but again, a bit bland.  The sauce had a good flavor with an ever so slight hint of tomato, cumin and chili powder, but it wasn't very exciting to the taste buds.  The portions were adequate, which is what they should be, as I personally feel that these places serve way too much food anyway, and since I'm not looking for value for money, I'm much more interested in quality.  The burritos from what I could see resembled overstuffed dish towels, basically the usual-size burrito that you see everywhere, that most people snarf down in one sitting but would take me a week to eat.\n\nAll and all I'd say Iron Cactus satisfies the need and perhaps if they concentrate on the food, and maybe branch out and be adventurous, then they'll get better and will probably do a great business during baseball season. \n\n But I don't understand why any of these Mexican places don't cook with any exciting spices; whenever I cook Mexican food, I'm using cumin seed, garlic, cayenne pepper, ancho, pasilla and poblano peppers and chiles, achiote and chile powder.  Tacqueria-style food here in the Bay Area is so bland and lifeless and tastes the same everywhere (Azteca Tacqueria is one exception).  All of the meats usually are overcooked and the chicken is boiled instead of roasted, the shrimp is rubbery , whole beans are cooked just in water and salt and the rice is always looks flavorful, but isn't.  And the Pico de Gallo which is mistaken for 'salsa' is always made with those pink insipid, cheap, fast food quality tomatoes (as was the pdg at Iron Cactus).  Although I'm adamantly against using tomatoes past their proper seasons, perhaps these places should consider using Roma tomatoes for their Pico de Gallo, if only just for the color.  A bit more expensive, but hell, this is the Bay Area!\n\nI'd like to see some real Mexican grandmothers open up a place, and show us what real Mexican cuisine is like, or better yet, where the hell is Rick Bayless when you need him?", "author": "Candace W."}

They have a patio in the back which is a nice place to eat on sunny days.  They make a pretty good chicken salad, but everything else is kind of so-so.  The service is horrible.  Someone who can barely speak English takes your order, and I always have to repeat it.  Then they ask you questions like \"wat kine bane?\".  \"What?\" \"Block bane, peento bane...\"  \"Oh, black beans, yes, that will work.\"  You almost feel like the Soup Nazi's shop as they hand you a number and shuffle you down to the next person who you hand your order to.  \"No, you keep number\", she says. (you are supposed to know this)  You give her the cash, she never offers you a drink (not once in my 10+ visits there), and then she prints out the receipt AND KEEPS IT.  Yes, they never give you a receipt (this comes into play later).  So, do they call my number, bring it to me...?  Unless you a regular, you won't know unless you ask.  \n\nOn Monday, March 25th around noon, I went there with my friend for lunch.  I ordered the chicken salad and he ordered some tamales.  His order came to $20 (foreshadowing here).  We went out to the patio.  They first brought out his food, then, a few minutes later, we hear a sneeze, followed by a second sneeze as the \"food runner\" dude (or whatever he is called) \"tried\" to cover his sneeze with his arm as my food was held below his sneeze.  He handed me the food and pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and started to wipe his nose.  The food runner dude was sick!!  My friend, who saw the whole thing, said \"I wouldn't eat that. He sneezed on it, I saw him\".  So, I took it back.  When I took it back and explained what had happened, the food runner dude denied it, saying he covered his mouth (he was wiping his nose again and was clearly sick).  You are missing the point, dude, YOU ARE SICK!  WTF ARE YOU SERVING FOOD FOR?  YOU ARE BLOWING YOUR NOSE AND HANDLING MY FOOD!  Well, he gave the food to the ladies behind the counter who looked confused.  I wouldn't leave.  I wanted to see them remake my salad and I would take it back to my table.  Well, it sat there for at least 5 minutes.  Then, they walked it to a counter between the front and back kitchen.  WTF?  The food is supposed to be prepared in front!  After about 10 minutes, they bring the food back.  Before I could get to it, the sick dude got his grubby hands on it and handed it to me.  I told this that this is the same salad as before except you could see the meat was hot.  I asked them what they did, and they said, no, the food was made in the back.  I told them the salads were always made up front (this is like a Subway shop with all the ingredients in bins behind glass in front) as they make it in front of you.  I was very hungry and walked back to my table.  I looked at the food and took a little bite of the avocado, then decided it wasn't worth the risk.  I am almost positive it was the same salad with newly cooked meat on top.  I decided to go grab a Subway sandwich instead.\n\nThree days later, I end up with the flu.  Coincidence?  I haven't been sick all season.\n\nSide note about my friend and his tamales. They overcharged him.  Since they don't give you a receipt, he couldn't check.  So, he went back and complained, they found his receipt, and his $20 meal should have been $12.\n\nSo, two strikes against them in one day.  If you decide to eat there, you have been warned.  There are several better choices of Mexican food in the area.  They have lost my business, and as I spread the word throughout my office, I think many coworkers will think twice.", "author": "Mike J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-10-26", "description": "This place has potential, but right now it's sittin' at 2.5 stars for me. With a few minor changes they'd easily be 3 stars in my book, maybe even up to 4 stars, but that would take more.... I'll get to that. \n\nI've been here twice so far- first time had the taco salad with tofu, second time had a veggie burrito with tofu. I'm fairly certain the burrito had more lettuce in it than my salad did. I couldn't really taste the gauc in my burrito, or the sour cream, and come on now, the cheese should be included (not cost extra!). The rice was, to be honest, pretty crap- mushy, and spicy- but not in a flavorful way. The rice needs to be not total mush and it'd be nice to have a plain rice option, or at least a less seasoned one. Also, there were soggy peas and carrots in my burrito- these things have no place being in a burrito. This is not Forrest Gump goes to the tacqueria, people- leave the mushy canned veggies out!\n\nAs for the tofu, I think they might be using silken tofu, or at least it tastes that way- the tofu needs to be grilled and firmer. I know, I know, it's TOFU, it's not supposed to taste great... but the thing is, when it's done well, it does. This tofu is mushy and tasteless. I think this would be a fairly easy fix- buy extra firm tofu, prep it correctly, grill it, don't leave it sitting in a vat of water/sauce with soggy canned vegetables.\n\nThe salad, too, would be an easy fix- add more lettuce, maybe mixed greens.... as it was, I felt like I was eating a bowl full of toppings. Blech. \n\nOk, now the pros, and the potential-\nI LOVE the atmosphere here. Actually, so much so that it sets my expectations really high- the great decor with dark wood and beautiful lanterns make me feel like I'm in a nice Mexican restaraunt, not a grab n' go burrito place.....and so it follows that I expect certain things. Namely, margaritas. When this place opened, I read the menu 4 times just to make sure I wasn't missing something. \"How can a Mexican place not have Margaritas???\"  It looked like the kind of place that would have great ritas. Yes, I know, Tres Agaves is right down the street, and yes, I understand this is a taqueria (even though it looks like a restaraunt), and that liquor licenses are expensive, but I still want a darn 'rita. Pitchers of them would add so much to this place. A 'rita  alone would add a star or two here. I hear they have sangria, which helps, but it's still not a margarita. Also, good sangria has booze in addition to wine in it, so I'm skeptical....unless they just get a liquor license. \n\nMore on pros: beer on draft, good beer selection, and very generous wine pours. The chips are pretty good. Outdoor patio and convenient location. Friendly staff. \n\nLike I said, potential. But right now my favorite part is the decor, not the food.", "author": "Kristen L."}

You order your grub at the counter, pay for it and take a number. Nothing wrong with that (almost all the best Mexican food I've had was from street vendors), just don't come here expecting white table cloths and a mariachi band.\nUnfortunately the level of service is belied even by the humble interior (I guess they're going for the faux vintage look that's inexplicably still popular in SOMA). It took 5 minutes to explain my complicated order of 2 soft tacos, 2 crispy tacos and a 'dilla to the cashier. After that she inexplicably decided to tack on a burrito to my order. The manager was pleasant, however, and quickly refunded me the burrito bucks.\nThe food took significantly longer than I expected to arrive, and when it did it was savory but not spectacular. None of the dishes were memorable and the ingredients, while allegedly fresh, were rather bland and had to rely on the salsa for flavor.\nIf the Iron Cactus gets competent staff and jazzes up their dishes (or at least obtains a full liquor license so they can serve margaritas) then they have all the makings of a success.

(I am from Wisconsin where normally cheese is included on everything for free :-)\n\nI should have looked at my receipt because I saw someone mention that they charge 50cents for chips?   I just assumed they came with it and they were on my plate.  I will have to check on that.  Its not very clear.\n\nThe other odd thing was there was a guy there that I think was the owner or manager.  He walked around in and out of the kitchen.  He looked exhausted and very unhappy.   I am sure starting a restaurant is a nightmare but if it was me I would have put on a happy face and said hello to people and welcomed them and asked them how things were.   He basically ignored the existence of all the customers never once talking to anyone but the staff???\n\n\nThe space is great.  The people were friendly to us but the food was my big concern reading the reviews.  Luckily both of us really liked our burritos and they were pretty good size.  I have to say the steak had some really good seasoning.   What I didnt like was the little salsa containers on the tables.  I just do not think that is sanitary having little social salsa pots all over the place.

I ordered their super burrito and it was HUGE and delicious.  I couldn't wait to go back.  NOW second time around - I ordered the super burrito again, paid $9.58 for the damn thing, got it, looked in the bag and sincerely thought they got my order wrong.  This burrito (if that's what you want to call it) was the size of a banana, no joke.  I went back up to the counter to explain that there must have been a mistake.  The guy at the register looks at me like I'm crazy and says \"Nope, it's a super\".  OK I'm not an idiot, last time I was here the \"super\" was a lot larger than a banana, and I was actually satisfied that my ten bucks was well spent.  But sure enough this asshole rudely told me that I was wrong and that my banana size burrito was indeed a super.  I will NEVER ever go back to this place.  Rude customer service, and they have no problem ripping you off.  I will be telling everyone I know not to come here.", "author": "Kerry Z."}

They also own the Creamery coffee shop attached - i thought this was a great model.  I wanted to take a moment to give a huge high five review for this restaurant.  Amidst the vast array of greasy spoon styled Mexican food spots (which don't get me wrong, I love as well), The Iron Cactus stands out as a healthy, thoughtful and noteworthily flavored option.  The basic foods chosen are all organic.  All chicken meat is white and of the highest grade.  The chicken tortilla soup is to die for as is the ceviche.  The moles used for burritos give them a great spin from the norm.  I highly recommend a stop in if you haven't tried.\n\nBeyond that, the service is exceptional - everyone is so polite, service oriented, and just all around nice.  I walked by during an electrical outage that had the entire 2 block radius out of service and they kept doors open with candles and everyone sitting eating together.  \n\nPlease take a moment to support this new locally owned restaurant.

I had a steak burrito, which unfortunately was worse than my usual steak burritos from Chipotle. The food itself wasn't bad at all, but the steak tasted almost chewier than usual and didn't have quite as much flavor. When I got it, I was surprised to feel that one side was unusually cold, while the other side was piping hot. Although I was concerned that I would have to return it to the kitchen, I unwrapped it only to find all the hot items on one side, while the cold corn and vegetables were in another section. The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite lively, but the music from the radio often drowned out our conversation at the table. I appreciated the TV in the corner though, which was set on a news channel reporting news.

Looks are deceiving, because my Iron Cactus report card is that of a high school drop out. You walk in and it just gets ridiculous right off the bat. This isnt a one time gig, I have been here on numerous occasions with different friends and its a joke and I read all these reviews and they are saying the same thing. I say no rice, I get rice, I say black beans, I get pinto. I get pieces of corn and other ingredients that appear to have fallen into my burrito by cross spooning ingredients. Each time I go over the order to be sure its correct, but it doesnt even matter. Then were at the register paying and every time I have been here this has been a deer in the headlights process. They even modeled themselves after Poncho Villa? Excuse me? The same place that pulled a grand opening, grand closing next to the Ferry Building where its impossible to fail because thousands of well educated people with cash walk past your front door? I personally hate Poncho Villa because their burritos are flavorless, um, next on the review, the flavor of Iron Cactus is pathetic. These burritos suck.

On the plus side, the people are friendly and they offer beer and wine. In a pinch, I would head to panera instead. If you have more time, I would go to Tres Agaves.", "author": "MIcah S."}

Esp since that is 90 % of the burrito they stuff in there.\nThe steak is msg ridden with no beef flavor.\nThe salsa? omg, it is sooo bland.  \nThe mexican people who work there are not happy to have a job.  They are smiling thru their angry teeth, is it that bad to work there???\nI agree, I want to have a good burrito place around here but this is just ridiculous, i would rather have a taco bell than this piece of trash.  The place is also wayy too cold.  maybe i'll go for a beer but food? i don't think so.  this place has the personality of the ridiculous coffee shop next door.  \nI can only say that i am glad there aren't too many people who go there since i don't want to run into a crowd of non food knowing people when i take my daily walk.\nI can say that i will let my dog do his business around this place tho.\nWhy so upset? Cuz i love my california burritos and i can't believe  they must have money to burn.\nI will visit again in 8 days.  if it does not change, the rice, the salsa, \nand whatnot i will be peessed. btw, they didn't even put salsa in my burrito.  i had to ask for chips and salsa, omg!", "author": "Sophia M."}
