Last Tuesday, June 12th, decided to grab Chinese food for dinner with my parents and the roommate. The roomie and I arrived first around 5pm and grabbed a table for four. It wasn't too hard as they had just opened and we were the first customers here.\n\nChef's Special: choice of 3 items ($22.99)\n*Chicken w/Ginger & Onion: half (+$1)\n*Beef w/Black Pepper Sauce\n*Salt & Pepper Pork Chop\n\nThey have a special where you can choose three dishes from a list for $23. Some have one or two dollar supplements, but it's it's a pretty good deal. I couldn't find most of the dishes listed above on their regular menu, but the chicken dish was $9. And looking through their menu, most things were $9+, so at $8 a dish, it isn't too bad. My favorite prep of chicken is the poached one with ginger and scallion sauce, so this was similar. Though a little dryer and needed more seasoning. The salt and pepper pork was good. But who doesn't like fried meat?! The beef was fine. Your typical black pepper stir fry with meat and some veggies. Also, I believe this menu (or maybe just dinner in general) comes with unlimited rice, so that's a perk if you are a big rice eater.\n\n*Pan Fried Pot Sticker ($5.85)\n*Bacon & Sausage w/Spareribs & Rice in Clay Pot ($6.75)\n*Pea Sprout w/Garlic Sauce ($11.95)\n*Heineken ($3.50) x3\n\nThe meal started with a complimentary soup. Very tasty and savory as I believe it was chock full of msg. (I have no issues with msg. In fact, I grew up eating it, so I don't mind it in my food at all.) My parents wanted to come here for the clay pot rice, so we got the one with pai gwut and lap cheong. I'm not a huge rice person, but I do adore a good clay pot rice. I like it when all the yummy meat juices incorporate themselves into the rice. I need a veggie with every meal and pea sprouts are one of my favorite greens. Cooked nicely with some subtle garlic flavor. The pot stickers were horrible. I'd say stay away from them at all costs. They were mushy and flavorless. Plus they didn't even give us a dipping sauce, so we had to mix our own. If you like chinese desserts, they give you a complimentary tapioca dessert.\n\nGood spot for clay pot rice. Definitely pass on the pot stickers, but everything else was A-OK.", "author": "Elena N."}

And this was our 1st time ever that we ate some Clay Pot Rice for dinner with my family!!! Which was on a very cold Monday of February 27, 2018!!! \n\nI have never thought about going out to dinner at the Green Island Restaurant with the family!!! In the beginning we thought about going to the one at The Claypot House but ended up not going there is because we had a family friend that had told us... Go and try the Golden Island Restaurant of Geary St!!! \n\nAnd so we gave it a try just to go eat dinner at this Golden Island Restaurant just for the Clay Pot Rice!!! Which was not that bad at all and what I really like the most out of the 5 orders of Clay Pot Rice that we ordered would be the Beef & Egg wRice in Clay Pot!!! \n\nNow that we finally ate here at this Green Island Restaurant...

It was perfection. \n- free range chicken porridge: this was such a big, generous bowl. The taste was really light, homey and really comforting (probably a great hangover cure)\n- bittermelon with pork ribs: I'm not a fan of bittermelon, but the way this was cooked didn't make the melon too bitter! The main problem was that there was hardly any meat on the ribs, and everything was drenched in black bean sauce\n- chicken and mushroom in claypot: I liked this quite a bit. It was heavy on the sauce, but the chicken was really tender, but maybe ate like, half a shiitake mushroom. They stuffed that pot with fried tofu (which I'm a fan of, it was delicious), but definitely seemed like a filler to avoid giving you more of the chicken and possibly mushrooms. \n\nStaff is efficient and friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-13", "description": "As much as I enjoy exploring (and eating) all that SF's restaurant scene has to offer, few things are quite as satisfying as discovering a Chinese restaurant that's both delicious and cheap.  Sure, I love me a good burrata and a plate of bone marrow, but feeding a table of four for less than $40 in the City?  That's just as big of a win!\n\nIn areas like the Richmond and Sunset though, the challenge is finding the champs amongst the chu-...non-champs.  Spots like Oriental Seafood, House of Pancakes, Dumpling Kitchen, and China First (before they recently raised their prices) have long been my personal favorites, but we decided to check out Green Island on the recommendation of a friend.  Can't say no to trying a potential addition to the rotation, especially when they offer three dishes for $20.99 (prices below are the listed individual prices).\n\n-- SALT & PEPPER ROCK COD...$7.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-island-restaurant-san-francisco#jWoLhRR7NdxplzZX9dSqrg)\nThe batter was nice and crunchy, but the rest of the dish fell short.  Although the fish was cooked okay, there could have been more salt and/or pepper since the dish as a whole was rather bland.\n\n-- CHICKEN WITH SALTED FISH AND TOFU CLAY POT...$7.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-island-restaurant-san-francisco#ohF9-QoaPbaR2ByZps4qIg)\nDecent, but not the best I've had.  The tofu was was soft and silky and I thought the portion was solid for the money.  However, I would have loved more of the salted fish since the flavors could have packed more of a punch.\n\n-- CHICKEN WITH GINGER AND GREEN ONION...$7.50 (half)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-island-restaurant-san-francisco#ZfrcjeKqdKPy8XliS5KKIA)\nA pretty classic dish that was spot on. The chicken wasn't super meaty, but it was really tender with a natural sweetness.  There was a good amount of ginger and green onions that made the dish pretty tasty as well.\n\n-- CHINESE BROCCOLI & BEEF...$7.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-island-restaurant-san-francisco#XLi8KIm33uhj2uc96-YYbQ)\nIt's pretty comparable to other Chinese restaurants in the Sunset/Richmond, but the taste was a-okay.  At the same time though, some of the beef was a little tough and a few of the pieces of broccoli were awkwardly cut (just thick stalks).\n\nAlthough I wasn't particularly overwhelmed with what we had, I will say Green Island's menu still manages to set them apart from other Chinese restaurants in the area.  Offering a slate of both Chinese and Vietnamese dishes, they certainly offer a bit more to choose from, though I can't say just how good any of it is.\n\nIn any case, I'd come back, but I wouldn't make a point of it.  Green Island seems to be a decent option if you happen to be in the area, but despite my curiosity about their Vietnamese dishes, I'll stick to my regular rotation of cheap Chinese eats.", "author": "Mike L."}

It is a gift from my childhood! \n\nThe one minus was the fresh rock cod that we brought in for them to prepare was overcooked. They poured thin soy sauce over it which made the dish quite salty. This won't prevent us from coming again. We think it's a solid place for country cooking here in San Francisco. It won't knock your socks off but it is satisfying. We were there 4 times in August.", "author": "Debbie T."}

It appears that it has now hit the wall.  Very popular place due to reasonable prices and portion size. My issues - I had to make a quick stop in the mens room to be greeted by your friendly cockroach.. when you see one you know his family is also residing therein.  Our order included the chives dumplings.. the centers were ice cold.. like they just came from the freezer and were not pan fried long enough.  My pho broth had negative  seven -7 flavor.. I couldn't eat it.. tasted like noodles were thrown in hot water and served. Zero chicken flavor. The house chow mein saved the meal, it was tasty with many ingredients. My daughter ordered a coconut smoothie which came with dry coconut powder on the top..??  mango flavored more than coconut.. Ordered a lemonade for my son and was brought an iced tea.  When the lemonade returned it appeared just made with slices of lemon in water and a spoon to stir the undissolved sugar.  Overall Green Island starting to look long in the tooth.. needs some upgrades and better work out of the kitchen. .Giving it a star for the reasonable pricing, one star for old times .. wont be back .. too many better options.", "author": "Jeff R."}

This time I needed to get some take-out to bring to Mama's house.  Ordered a chicken won ton, beef chow funa nd the house special chow mein.  The house special chow mein was supposed to have a little of everything - seafood, chicken, beef, etc.\n\nHere's the problems: no chicken meat in the chicken won ton.  Maybe it was chicken broth won ton?  Or they got my order wrong?\n\nNot much of anything in the house special chow mein.  Counted no chicken, 3 pieces of seafood, no beef, no veggies, lots of noodles.\n\nI was very disappointed.  With so many other Chinese restaurant options in the area, I won't be back for take-out.

One of our party of 20 does not eat garlic or onions, sad to say but the few dishes she special ordered still turned out well).  We ordered a lot of different items. I recommend the any of the noodle dishes, whether in a soup or chow mein. The saut\u00e9ed pea shoots, oxtail in clay pot, fillet of fish with baby bok choy, salt $ pepper chicken wings, salted fish & chicken fried rice, clams with black bean sauce are all good. There are innovative specials posted on the walls you should check out. They even have free range chicken. The prices are quite reasonable. The service is friendly. It's good to keep track of what you order because you might need to remind the servers about what is still missing from the order. But it's not a huge deal for them to quickly make what they need to, especially for a large group. And yes, they are good for groups and families. Conducive to sharing food. Be a little patient and you will enjoy the meal. We will be sure to try more dishes next time.", "author": "Lucy L."}

It was great that they offered this, most Chinese places don't even bother!\n\nTo top it off, they brought out a red bean dessert at the end of the meal.

Born and raised in San Francisco by Chinese immigrants who raised us in Chinatown eating nothing but rice at each meal. My parents pinched their pennies often and so developed my taste for cheap food. \n\nI stopped craving Chinese food a long time ago and haven't even touched rice regularly, but coming to Green Island has revived my love for Chinese food. I first came here with my boyfriend's family because his dad is a regular and it did not disappoint! They have a dinner deal for 3 dishes for $19.99. At first, I compared it to other restaurants with similar deals, like D&A and god forbid I ever eat there again. Happily to my dismay, it was nothing close to D&A. We ordered the yellow chicken, clams, pepper steak beef, greens, and one more dish I can't remember. All dishes were very flavorful without being too powerful or salty. Though the dishes were slightly smaller than what I was expecting, still a great bang for your buck! \n\nMost yelpers have complained about the service and though I won't disagree about the slow service (they forgot one of our dishes the first time and took almost 40 minutes), the owner was apologetic and offered us a discount. She was incredibly friendly and attentive despite the restaurant being packed with another large family taking up three family tables. In my opinion, you can't really knock a place for their poor service if their food is solid. \n\nOn the other times I've come here for lunch, my boyfriend and I ordered the chicken and mushroom claypot ($6.95) and the tomato beef crispy noodles ($6.95). Both were delicious and delicious a heaping portion of noodles to protein ratio. My most recent visit was yesterday and we tried the House Special Clay Pot ($7.50 and larger than your average clay pot) and the Black Bean Rock Cod Chow Ho Fun ($7.50). The ho fun was absolutely delicious! The rock cod was probably coated with corn starch to make it more tender. The sauce was perfect! The house special clay pot includes 4 types of meat (chinese sausage, a dried fatty cut of meat, spare ribs and chicken). \n\nI'll definitely be back, as if there was any doubt from my review?", "author": "Connie C."}

He wanted seafood and I wanted vegetables, so after yelping indecisively for about 10 minutes, we decided to do it the old fashioned way and go by foot.  We saw a cool French Vietnamese place on Geary and parked only to find it was closed, so lo and behold, a block later, there was Green Island. Menu looked OK, so hubby says, yelp it.\n\nTip: if you search for restaurants \"nearby\" and the one you're standing in front of doesn't come up two pages down, walk on, my friend. Walk on. Three and a half stars is enough to keep me away usually, but we were HUNGRY and I saw an elite rate it 4 stars with repeat check-ins. We went for it, and my trust has been bruised for life.  Mmmkay so here we go:\n\nSERVICE: Walked in. After standing about desperately trying to make eye contact with somebody for about a minute or so, a customer finally told us we could just sit down.  Suddenly waitress appears and points to either side of the restaurant: \"Here or here,\" she says.  Uh, ok, we went for \"here.\"\n\n~~flashback~~ *in the car*\n\nHusband:   You want asian and I really want fish, but with asian, they usually fry it, and I don't want it fried, I want it fresh.\nMe: Well, just ask them ahead of time if they fry it and if they do, tell them you want it fresh.\nHusband: OK, yeah, I guess.\n~~~~~\n\nTake one:\nHusband: I'm interested in this fish here, is it breaded and fried or is it fresh?\nWaitress: *turning around suddenly, turning back, giving the *wait* finger and walking off*\nMe: Uh...wait, what just happened?  Is she- did she just walk off?  Do you want to just leave?\nHusband: Just wait.\n\nShe walks back to the kitchen, comes back out, picks up somebody else's dish and delivers it to their table and NEVER RETURNS.\n\nNew, English-Speaking Waitress arrives: Take two:\n\nHusband: I'm interested in this fish here, is it breaded and fried or is it fresh?\nWaitress 2: Not fried, light dusting, just dusted, and then stir fried.\nHusband: Oh, ok, that sounds good.  I'll have the salt and pepper cod then.\n\nWhen the food arrives, ten and a half crispy-crunchy deep-fried fish nuggets in their glorious nakidity appear on a bald white plate with jalapeno pepper-slice hair and spring onion freckles and NOTHING ELSE.\n\n- We are never asked how the food is.\n- No water delivered.\n- Appetizer takes an inordinately long time to appear.\n\nENVIRONMENT: \nDecor: Circa 1974 pseudo-wood paneling.  Some things you'll find on the wall:  Bed Bath and Beyond style paintings of dandelions and peonies, eight-foot-long painting of ancient Chinese guys doing ancient Chinese work, various red and gold Chinese knick-knacks, and for the holidays a cute plastic evergreen wreath with a bell and some ornaments.  If you're lucky enough to head towards the bathroom, you'll see a painting of some flowers on the wall itself that looks like it belongs in a daycare with another painting kitty-corner to that of a skateboarder silhouette grabbing his board and jumping nowhere in particular (????).  \nMusic: Top-40 radio.  Heard some Lourde, Miley Cyrus, and New Direction.  \nCleanliness: On my jolly way to the bathroom, I got a gander at the kitchen.  There were at LEAST five overflowing tubs of dirty dishes sitting on the FLOOR.  This might explain the food poisoning case mentioned earlier.  Happily this happened after I ate, although ignorance would have been bliss in this case.\n\nFOOD:\nShrimp Summer Rolls: So tasty!  The thai basil inside really popped, and the sauce was delish!  Husband quote: \"I could just drink this stuff!  It's amazing!\"\n\nSalt and Pepper Cod:  See previous entry about service.  Fried, soggy, absolutely no salt or pepper anywhere at all.  Supposedly \"spicy,\" but just totally bland.  There were only 10.5 little pieces of breaded fish, and my husband mostly ate off of my dish, and didn't even finish his.  We always eat or box everything, and when asked, box was flatly refused.\n\nChicken and vegetables: (Not on the menu)  I asked Waitress #2 if there was something with a lot of vegetables and either tofu or chicken.  She said yes, with tofu.  I asked if the tofu was fried.  She said yes, so I said chicken, afraid of what I knew was coming.  Yes indeed: the gristly, stringy, tendon-laced not-sure-what-part-of-the-chicken-this came-from chicken of lower quality asian restaurants.  The \"vegetables\" were broccoli and bok choy.  The sauce was actually quite tasty and savory, and on the salty side, in a good way.  I ate the vegetables and left the meat for my husband who was desperate after the fish fiasco.  No rice came with the meal, but the portion was four times the size of my husband's.\n\nI am writing this extensive review only because I felt like the prior conversation lacked honesty and vital details that I really would have liked to know before entry.  If you're desperately hungry and not picky about cleanliness, try something other than the salt and pepper cod.", "author": "Elaine B."}

It was a little gloopy, but the flavor was good. \n\nTons of families chowing down---seems like a popular local joint, and I enjoyed it even though I'm not a popular local.", "author": "Emily D."}

Note: this isn't the place to have high expectations on service or ambiance.  They offer both Chinese & Vietnamese, and the pho was surprisingly decent.  \n\nMy go to dishes are rice clay pots chinese sausage & chicken (damn good), and it isn't listed on the menu but the tomato beef curry fried noodle.  Everything I've had here has exceeded my expectations - bitter melon with fish, salted fish w/ tofu & chicken clay pot, hot ginger chicken, and the dessert offered, and warm red bean soup is pretty delicious too.  There's so much more to try, I'm particularly looking forward to ordering the bitter melon & sparerib chow fun next.  \n\nThis place is sooo good I went twice last week.  BAM!\n\np.s.

The cook is obviously different (my beloved beef stew is no longer as good), so we tried the Chinese dishes.\n\nThe lady who takes orders is very helpful in explaining the dishes (special sausage hot pot vs. sausage hot pot, etc. etc.)  The portions are huge and the prices are between $5 and $8.  \n\nWe had the cod and tofu hot pot, the sausage and rice hot pot (chinese sausage, bacon, pork, veggies, crusty rice at the bottom), and the salted fish and chicken fried rice (tasty, not swimming in oil).  All tasted good,I'd order them again.  This all cost about $21 (inc T&T).\n\nSo 4 stars.  This is a no-pretenses, well priced restaurant with good food and quick polite service.", "author": "Mia G."}

If you've read some of my other reviews, you'd know that I am not a fan of Chinese food and only go if we're eating with my inlaws. But after driving around for 30 minutes trying to find parking in the Richmond, my husband notices the \"Grand Opening\" sign for this place and there was a parking spot right across the street. So I quickly yelp to get an idea of what kind of food is served and when I tell my husband that it's rice in clay pot, it was like fate telling us we had to try this place (my husband loves rice in clay pot). \n\nOf course we order the rice in clay pots. I got the sausage & spareribs with rice in clay pot (#113) and my husband got the salted chicken with rice in clay pot (#108). I think the best thing about the meal was that it was only $5-6 for a clay pot rice. My mother in law makes this dish for dinner and her's is waaaaaaay better. There was no flavor or anything to the dish. Like my husband repeatedly said, it was very one dimensional. The soy sauce that they give you to pour over your rice was meh. Basically watered down soy sauce so I used the soy sauce and hot sauce on the table to give the rice a kick and some actual flavor. \n\nOh, almost forgot the other best part. They gave us a slice of watermelon each for \"dessert\". Made me happy because I had been craving watermelon all day. \n\nService was ok. They took our orders right away, but we sat around and waited for our check for the longest time. Had they been busy, I would have understood, but seeing as there was no one else there but 2 other tables, I think they should have noticed us trying to get our bill for about 10 minutes. Maybe the meal was just a fluke since they're in their grand opening phase so maaaaaaybe I'll give them another chance if I start to hear better things about them.", "author": "Lang T."}

I actually planned on eating at that Vietnamese restaurant and realized it changed ownership after parking, but decided to try it out anyway.\n\nWe were greeted and seated right away (probably because there were no other customers). We quickly decided on Chinese dishes over Vietnamese ones when we realized that the owners are Chinese. After placing our order, the waitress came out with two Honey Lemon drinks on the house. This drink was only okay, but offering it for free is a good way to get some customers to return. \n\nWe chose three items as part of the 3 items for $20.99 Chef's Special. The portions were huge and food was filled to the brim of the plates. We looked at each other and knew there was enough food for dinner, breakfast AND lunch for the next day, LOL. Our first dish was Pork Ribs w/String Beans, which I must say was really good. The taste was a bit on the salty side, but it balanced well with rice. The second dish we ordered was Curry Beef Stew, which had a little too much of the bell peppers (my least favorite vegetable) but tons of tendons (which I absolutely love). It was delicious! Unlike most Chinese restaurants, you can actually taste the curry. The last dish we tried was Tomato Beef. It was good, tasted like the norm with chunky pieces of tomatoes. \n\nI thought everyone was very friendly and provided decent service. They made an error on our bill but apologized immediately when we pointed it out. \n\nThis restaurant was a nice surprise and I don't mind it replacing the Vietnamese restaurant. Their dishes are very similar to the nearby D and A Cafe's, but they offer a larger variety and I feel the food tastes better as well. I'll definitely return!
