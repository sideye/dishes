Something in the bowl ended up stabbing me between the front two teeth and inside my gums. I was able to extract it but it concerned me since I didn't understand how, what I thought was maybe a splinter of bone, got into the soy based protein and then into my gums. Since I eat Chipotle at least once a week from this location and haven't had issues before, I decided I was going to try to just get past it, go in tell them about my experience and ask for a free Bowl in replacement. Due to location issues such as a fire and a gas problem, this Chipotle hasn't been open when I tried to go back in earlier this week and talk to them.\n \nToday I managed to get in there and talk to the manager about it but got very strange attitude. I was told that I should have \"contacted corporate\", that it was strange that I ended up with a bone in my soy burrito bowl, and that they were only closed for half a day, all of this in a semi accusatory tone and generally I didn't feel believed.  After what felt like five minutes of arguing (that I never should have had to engage in as a customer) the manager handed me a card for a free meal and then walked off.  No, I didn't save the shard that stabbed me but I was worried about taking real damage and when I got it out I threw it away in disgust.\n\nI felt like I was being treated like somebody scamming for food when the staff in there know me. I get that mistakes happen, and I really just wanted to get past it, but dealing with that manager today made it very difficult to move past and now I don't really want to ever go back.", "author": "Steve G."}

Not hating any chains here, but I just didn't want to get disappointed.\n\nHowever, burritos still win my heart. In Malaysia, it isn't easy to find good Mexican food and you would not see Mexican chains around. So, when I was at Chipotle, feeling hungry during lunch time, I literally and happily gulped down the big burrito. Without an expectation that's too high, the steak that's wrapped within was actually better than I thought it'd be. What can I say? Burritos make a happy Alexander.\n\nI actually visited this place twice during that trip to SF - I just couldn't get enough of Mexican food. For dinner the second time, I ordered a bowl with Carnitas - equally good and I do love the meat that they use. However, I didn't get to try their chips and I was almost deadly craving for those with Guac - be there earlier I guess if you want some of that. \n\nThe queue there during lunch and dinner hours are usually quite long, but don't be deceived as the line moves really quick.

My portions sucked, and when I asked the guy to add some more meat, he snarled at me and said that I already got more meat than normal. Are you use to feeding infants or adults? The meat portion you showed me my 2 year old niece would have ate and still had room to keep eating... Also everyone behind the glass were kids, lacking diversity.\n\nThe prices went up, I got less food, and somewhat of an attitude when I asked for more because I thought.. hmm for $9 that sure sucks, I can get a burrito from the Mexican joint down the street that will surely fill me up.\n\nIt is really sad how corporate is becoming everything in our country.

You go in and order the same damn thing you got the last 60 times a'la Starbucks. People say there's a \"secret menu\" but really it's just mooshing the same ingredients in different ways (but then again, this is true about all Mexican food, in California, to some extent). \n\nSo what's different about *this* Chipotle? Well for starters you have to fight your way through a crowd of smoking art college students to get to the door. It's like going to a Great White show, only replace chain wallets with haircuts that they'll look back at in five years and cringe with double chills. Once you're inside there's probably a lunch line as far as you can see. That's not the problem, it moves fast. The problem is they skimp hard on the ingredients, probably so they don't run out from the hipster art student onslaught. \n\nThey however have margaritas. Not that Ka wine BS but Patron. Haven't tried them though, because, who really wants to sip a Margarita in a loud fast food restaurant? \n\nI may sound negative. At least a little. But, hey, it's still Chipotle.

This is a good step in the right direction, but they are still a huge corporation and their environmental footprint is very large so their words don't mean much to me.Unfortunately, \"Natural\" is a pretty meaningless label due to the lack of standards by the USDA and it would be nice if chipotle committed to buying pasture-raised (actually humane and natural) meat.

They take the extra steps that places like McDonalds or Taco Bell would never even think to touch.\n\nBeing in a busy area like SOMA, it can be a pain in the arse to get in-and-out anywhere around lunch time, and they do a pretty good job of managing lines to ensure you're grubbin' and back to work in three shakes of a lamb's tail (an organic lamb, at that!).\n\nFor me, eating at Chipotle is a lot like an eclipse.

Their meat is very flavorful and I love that their rice is mixed with cilantro and lime. \n\nThey are also super fast and do not skimp on the filling. My coworkers have actually complained before that their burrito had too much filling, couldn't be wrapped, and fell apart as they were eating. I say bring it on! I love that they give generous portions and don't mind the mess. Another complaint I've heard is Chipotle isn't \"authentic mexican.\" Newsflash - they're not trying to be. Anyhow I recommend the carnitas or steak burrito and LOVE adding the fresh and corn salsa. If you like spicy you should also add the green chile salsa. Unfortunately you have to buy chips separately, but they're worth it; perfectly salted and also contain lime.", "author": "Alice J."}

I had to rub my eyes when I read it myself, but it's up there among the ranks of Farolito, Papalote, and Cancun.  \n\nAs a company, Chipotle purchases ingredients from local farms and suppliers.  While not farm-to-table exactly, everything you eat comes from within 300 miles of the location.\n\nAnd it tastes good!  I love the barbacoa!  They serve beer!  And margaritas!  With booze in them!\n\nUnfortunately, Tapatio does not exist in the Chipotle universe and no one got the memo that Tabasco does not really belong on a burrito.

I can't even bother to sneer at del Taco or Chevy's or that other del someshit another block away. \n\nChipotle has ok meat and addictive lime/sea salt laden chips. They also have beer that they tempt you with and then pull away when they find out that your order is to go. \n\nWhat they don't have is someone to train their people to make burritos or tacos in the way that civilized human beings prefer to eat them. Instead, I imagine that they must show them Jackson Pollock videos and then spin them around 5 times real fast and shove them to the food line with the promise that the slowest among them will be put to death. Speed is paramount. Craftsmanship is out the window.\n\nIf you order tacos, they will just sprinkle ingredients all over the place. If you are lucky, some of those ingredients will land in the taco shell. The rest of the ingredients, you get to eat off the wrapper or your hand as it slobs off the side of your taco. Grab a fork. If you get a burrito, they will put more crap in it than should fit and then mush it into a blob. Just before the blob ruptures, they quickly envelop it in tin foil. You will want to wear a Hurt Locker suit when you open that bitch. Have a spoon and a roll of paper towels handy.\n\nYour best bet is to just have them slop your ingredients in a bowl.

The burritos really are good, but I am partial to the tacos here.  I've never actually sat down to eat here since I work like a block away but I'm pretty happy with this Chipotle overall.

One of the girls working there made an announcement, apologized for the no-rice situation, and then offered to make our food for free if we would be ok with no rice. Perfect situation for us!\n\nWe usually get the burrito bowl with extra grilled veggies, no rice or cheese, chicken, and extra guacamole. Total cost: 0.\n\nThis review isn't because we got our food for free. This review is about the foresight of management to empower their employees to make the right call in situations like these. They probably ended up giving away 7, 8 burritos while the rice was getting ready. But they moved the line really fast, and made some people happy in the process.

They were all overflowing with meat!!!\n\nSo does this place now discriminate against women by giving us smaller servings of meat and ingredients???  It's not as if the guys ordered larger size burritos - there isn't a super size option on the menu.  \n\nI then asked the cashier if chips came with the burrito and she said you have to pay extra and order a side of chips - I said oh we used to get some chips with the burrito but would order a side order if we wanted more.  She said they've never given free chips with food before, which I know to be wrong because I used to be a frequent visitor at this location and around the country.

Free refills on fountain drinks, and the meats are all well-seasoned. Only two minor downsides - 1) the fresh-made tortilla chips are an extra charge, and 2) sometimes they're a bit aggressive about rolling the burrito and it tears, making eating a bit messier.\n\nTake advantage of their online ordering (especially if you have a group!) and bypass the line entirely.

I had lunch here earlier, for the first time.  My old roomie from LA used to rant and rave about this place, I can see why now.\n\nTo my surprise, the menu was REALLY simple, you just order a burrito, fajita burrito, burrito bol, salad, etc.  Then you choose your meat and you're pretty much done.  Since it's like the Panda Express line, things move relatively fast, up until the cash register.\n\nI got a simple, steak burrito with just rice and mild salsa.  I'm very particular about my burritos being served this way.   Only La Vics has a wonderful sauce that you can add to help the dry carne asada meat build some flavor, but since more burrito joints don't have a sauce, most burritos are rather dry.  Not Chipotle, their steak meat is cooked and kept in a sauce, so it's nice and juicy, has a little kick too.  So as I ate my burrito, I didn't need feel the need to add any sauces.  The price of the burrito was not so bad either, it was only adding a soda that sucked.\n\nTwo things that they could improve, MORE seating and smaller chunks of steak.

I have to agree with an earlier review in saying that the crispy tacos with barbacoa and everything on them are amazing.  The place is consistent, you have to give it that.\n\nHOWEVER, this particular Chipotle sucks.  You can see that their staff is trained heavily to be as conservative as possible when serving you.  Pay attention when they add sour cream and cheese - they use so little there might as well be none at all.  I've been disappointed over and over again in the amount of food they've given me.  Now maybe that makes me a fatass, I don't really care.  It just pisses me off because I can always count on being let down by them.\n\nAnyways, thought I'd toss that into the mix.

I wanted this to be a fair assessment of a what was a quite tasty meal. \n\nWhen I walked into the restaurant - it was as what many reviewers have described - crowded and noisy.  Luckily, I had printed out a menu from the website and had my selection picked out in advance.  But nothing would be able to prepare me with the experience of the \"food order rush\".  \n\nIt was literally like sitting down on a water slide and being pushed off the ledge.  As soon as I advised the order taker I wanted a Fajita Burrito, I was handed off to the bean / sauteed veggie lady - which soon handed me off to the sour cream / salsa / guacamole / cheese lady and then sent flying down to the cashier / manager.  Picture Subway, but frantic with alot of hollering in thick Hispanic accents.  Trying to order a glass bottle drink with the manager resulted in a similar experience. \"What kind of juice drinks do you have?\" drew a response that contained a lot of fruit rattled off very quickly. \n\nAfter paying for lunch for me and the wifey (which also left her a bit shaken), we hit the proverbial lunch lottery by  scoring an open table.  We sat down and enjoyed our lunch and compared it favorably to Baja Fresh. \n\nFast food places will never / and should never get 5 stars as 5 stars are meant for establishments that deserve such accolades.  But without question, Chipotle deserves 4 stars as the food is quite possibly the finest fast food I've experienced.  Regrettably, Chipotle loses merit due to the fact that our experience was tainted by the stress of placing the order - as well as the fact that lunch was almost $18. $18 for a burrito, a burrito bowl and ONE drink is about $5 too much.", "author": "Dennis Y."}

There is a sufficient amount of seating at this location. If you've never been to a Chipotle, surprised if you haven't, then you can't go wrong with trying their customizable burrito. You just simply point to what you want in your burrito. There are also calorie indicators so you can manage your dietary restrictions. The burrito will be very reasonable in cost - $7-8 in cost. You can go all out and add some chips and guac for about $3 dollars more. Occasionally, you will have a line person who doesn't know what they are doing and will just add brown rice when you ask for white, or add refried instead of black beans.

There's almost always one or two people in there, so you don't have to feel awkward about overstaying your welcome, but the place is so big there's usually plenty of places to sit. Free refills, and all the plastic silverware and lemon wedges you could want, that's real. \nCons:\nI used to get burritos that were large and filled with love and care. I always try to be as polite as possible because I have this notion in my mind that they'll give me less food or spit in my burrito or something while I'm not looking, which from what I can tell is not true. It really just depends on the person, and most of the people here tend to give out less than packed burritos and unlike most burritos sometimes I won't be utterly full by the end. More than that they don't seem to know how long to grill it, cuz unlike other Chipotles sometimes the tortillas here are kind of hard and chewy.\nOverall if you like Chipotle, you may or may not be disappointed, but when I'm jonesing for a Chipotle burrito, I come here and try and get the most out of my soda refills.", "author": "Josh K."}

I went here for the first time a few days ago, as I recently began working close to it.  I am a huge fan of their salad. I get it with black beans, hot salsa, sour cream, corn and sometimes peppers.  Too much sour cream and too much dressing. My greens were swimming and I feel that their dressing here is not nearly as good as my former Chipotle in Woodland Hills, so too much of a not as good thing is not very good. But, their staff is friendly, nice, fast and efficient.", "author": "Emma B."}

Because it's the most convenient establishment on the planet.  I order and pay online ahead of time while sitting at my desk.  I specify a pick-up time that is convenient for me, and when that time comes I hop over to Chipotle, skip the line that snakes around the block, state my name at the register, and they hand me my veggie burrito bowl wrapped neatly in a paper bag.  No fuss, no questions, literally no wait.  They're consistent, follow my instructions on the order, and they have never messed up a single time.

They're rich, so they can handle one bad review from some dork in SOMA.  BTW, this review applies to ALL Chipotle's.  First complaint, the burritos taste too bland and boring.  There is no \"juiciness\" or \"bursting flavors\" or anything that makes it taste good.  The rice is super white, meaning NO FLAVOR.  The salsas look healthy, but lack any kick or substance.  The chips are so damn salty you can see entire salt licks on each chip.  Chipotle's claim to fame is that it mimics the great burritos of San Francisco's Mission District, foil wrapping and all.  Well, since we live in San Francisco, why not just get the real thing?  I mean, we're already here, right?
