The Portola has historically been home of mediocre Vietnamese cuisine all across the board. With the injection of Banh Mi House into a neighborhood starving for decent Banh Mi; they have won a place in our hearts.\n\nI have tried all of the sandwiches on their menu and can appreciate the consistency that they bring. It's a different flair and style of banh mi that you would expect from the TL/San Jose, but overall it's a tasty sandwich.", "author": "Sam K."}

I lived in this neighborhood for a summer and the area isn't somewhere I'd walk around alone at night, but it's fine and safe during the day with a ton of other local Asian businesses and housing nearby. \n\nOrder: \nEverything is cheap btw, about 5-7 bucks. \nWe had the grilled meatball and 5 spice chicken sandwiches. The grilled meatball sandwich is the traditional ground pork banh mi but they put a LOT of pepper in it -- hence, a little too spicy for my taste. The 5 spice chicken reminds me of Chinese marinated dark meat chicken (lu rou). I enjoyed this one a lot more. \nIced Vietnamese coffee \nIced Thai tea -- drinks are good and typical here but I did not prefer the large amount of crushed ice in them -- more slushy-esque than drink. \n\nPros: \nCheap for serving size\nNot that many banh mi places around so I welcome any opportunity there is to have one. \n\nCons: \nParking in this area can be a bit of a nuisance, it's often easier to park off nearby residential areas a block off the main stretch. \nNot much seating aside from counter seats.", "author": "Anita T."}

The baguette was toasted and crunchy, while the inside was soft and warm. I noticed they drizzled a bit of Maggi seasoning sauce into the sandwich, which I had never seen before but it definitely had a distinct taste. Although I usually don't stay full on one banh mi, I felt very satisfied and felt that the portion size was just perfect. My only issue is that it was a bit on the expensive side ($5.50). \n\n+ THE SERVICE\nWe called in our orders and our sandwiches were ready in about 10 minutes. They make everything to order and work quickly to ensure freshness of the banh mi's. \n\n+ THE ENVIRONMENT\nBanh Mi House is a small little shop located on the corner of bustling San Bruno Ave. There's only a few seats by the window which indicates it's a quick order and go kind of place. The shop itself is very clean and organized. There's a small refrigerated area near the back for drinks and Asian desserts.", "author": "Cindy C."}

I really like the ones at Saigon Sandwich or even Lee's in the TL, but this wasn't bad. \n\nI came here one morning when I realized I had no lunch for work, and needed a quick and cheap meal. Banh Mi is a great choice. At $5.50, this was a good option in the area. Plus, it's been open in the hood for a few months, at least, and I had yet to try it. \n\nI got a combination pork to go, and they asked me if I wanted jalapeno's three times in the 10 min it took them to make the sandwich. It's like they didn't believe I wanted jalapeno's. They layer the different pork products in there, a thin layer each. One of the meats had sliced whole peppercorns, and that was a bit of a surprise when I bit in. The jalapeno was either not spicy, or my taste bud for spicy has become dead. They finish the sandwich with a sprinking of some mystery thing in a shaker (MSG? Salt and Pepper? MAGIC!?), and a few dashes of Maggi seasoning sauce. I smelled that Maggi the whole time I had the sandwich. \n\nOverall, not fully authentic, so the food is a 3. But the ladies who made the sandwich were super sweet, the service was good, and the place is HELLA clean. So. 4 stars.", "author": "Lily W."}

With the opening up of that coffee shop and that brewery, I'm honestly scared that the place I know and love so much will become another San Francisco gentrification story. However, I know there's still a lot of life and culture left with small businesses like Banh Mi House.\n\n[Ambience]\nA quaint little place! There's not much standing room inside, so the line is always out of the door lol. The first thing you notice about this place is their super simple menu. I think there's only about 4-5 different kinds of sandwiches you can buy, but their drink options are extensive. They have a cold box filled with different sodas and Asian drinks (I got the grass jelly!).\nYou can see the workers making your sandwich - they keep their stations and front of the house clean which is a huuuuge plus! No flies in sight!\n\n[Service]\nService was prompt and efficient. Once they take your order, they write it on your sandwich bag - down to the drinks you buy. I waited about 10-15 minutes for everything to come out. They work sooooo fast.\n\n[Food]\nI ordered 3 combination pork sandwiches with extra pate, a meatball sandwich with extra pate, a thai tea and a canned grass jelly drink. I think Banh Mi House is my new favorite place for Vietnamese sandwiches!\nThis place doesn't skimp on meat or pickled veggies. I appreciate that they use spicy jalapenos/don't take out the jalapeno seeds!\nSince we ordered extra pate in all of our sandwiches, I was a bit worried that they weren't gonna give us a lot, but I was pleasantly surprised to see some pate falling out of my sandwich!\n\n[Worth it???]\n$5.50 for a sandwich?? YES PLS. My total for 4 sandwiches and 2 drinks was a cool $30. Compared to Dinosaurs (I order from dinosaurs a lot....), you're not breaking the bank at all. \nGo ahead and dish another $2 for extra meat, or another dollar for extra pate! Go ahead and buy that $3 thai tea, or that $1.50 grass jelly drink!\nSeriously tho, come here, support small businesses and eat good banh mi's.", "author": "Audrey G."}

I know I do if not always but almost 2-3 times a week I need my Viet-sandwich satisfaction. \n\nThis place is up most probably one of the best small local diners to get your craving satisfied, by means if it's a Vietnamese sandwich or Vietnamese coffee craving this place will satisfy every craving running through those taste buds. \n\nThere's street parking but be warned it's hard to find especially on a busy Friday/Saturday/Sunday when everyone and their family is out shopping or munching away. Also there are small parking lots for banks and neighborhood parking around the area but be warned again it is SF so grab all your belongings or it might be missing with a shattered window. \n\nThis place is located the corner of the street and is pretty small made more of the grab and go, there's about 3-4 seats and a bar like table facing the window overlooking the traffic that passes. \n\nNow for my overall experience, I got lucky the last time I went because I found parking straight in front of the location with a broken meter (that's winning in SF knowing .25 gives you 5 minutes). When you walk in it's pretty clean I don't think there's a public restroom and the menu is displayed. My favorite sandwich to get there is the combination of course with the coffee, for me I requested light ice. \n\nThe employees here are very considerate they will ask if you want jalape\u00f1o or extra/less portions. \n\nExperience here definitely a plus and I will come back!!", "author": "Marilyn A."}

Besides, the crazy hail storms didn't call for a long drive at the moment. She said there's a bus pick-up at San Bruno Road, just a few blocks from where she used to live when I was dating her back in the 90's. No, this ain't no love story but it's a married life story that is often played on a daily basis. So I relented and dropped her off so she can have \"fun\" at the casino. \n\nWhile in the area, I decided to stop by Fancy Wheat Field Bakery to grab some Pork Sung Rolls for me and the kids. Sure enough, it started hailing again and I stayed inside to weather that crazy storm and I happen to notice this Banh Mi joint across the street. I took it as a sign and I decided to drop by and grab me self a sammich since WIfey wasn't there to tell me no. Their menu is pretty direct and simple so I ordered the Combo Sammich (Roast Pork, Fancy Pork and Headcheese) and took it to go. There was a couple of Asian ladies working at that time and they were pretty busy making a bunch of sammiches as there appears to be a lot of pick-up orders. The younger lady took my order and she was very nice and pleasant. \n\nWhen I got home, I unwrapped the sammich and started digging in. The baguette had a crisp exterior which gave it a nice crunch, but it wasn't too hard and it was easy to chew. The interior of the baguette had a nice consistency and the flavor of everything together was pretty good. Although it could use some more sauce that could have been more bolder, I was digging all the fresh and flavorful ingredients.  \n\nAbout a week later, I happen to be in the neighborhood again and decided to grab the same sammich. It's only 5 bucks and it definitely hit the spot when fiendin' for a quick bite or to satisfy your Banh Mi cravings. It's not the best Banh Mi I've ever had, but it's pretty good and inexpensive.

Times like this, I wish Yelp had .5 star option because 3.5 stars is the appropriate rating for Bahn Mi House.

It was fairly salty for my taste buds. I had to add hot sauce to cancel out the salt and bring a new flavor in towards my last few bites\n\nCombination: average. The pate wasnt as good as what ive had at other places, and there wasnt much flavors to the meat. \n\nThai tea: generous amount of the tea itself (not watered down by ice/ filled with ice).
