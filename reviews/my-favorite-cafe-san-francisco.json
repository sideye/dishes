The prices are relatively cheap and they have so many desserts. I do wish there were more pictures since some of the desserts like \"Mango Delight\" and \"Mango Madness\" are hard to distinguish what exactly goes in. Lots of yummy hot food dishes if you and your friends skipped dinner, etc. I got the fried bananas with ice cream and it was so good, hot crispy fried bananas with cold ice cream and some whipped cream for less than $7????

Two of my friends hit me up last Thursday night saying they wanted to come here and I was so down. This is one of the few dessert places that stay open past midnight in the area which is nice for those late night dessert cravings. \n\nThe place has lots of seating and I've never had to wait for a table. Back then, my go-to's were the mango madness, strawberry madness, and the egg puffs. I decided to stick with what I now and ordered the mango madness and egg puffs again because why fix something that isn't broken?\n\nMango madness is mango pudding topped with a scoop of mango ice cream and big mango cubes that surround the ice cream. Mango pudding wasn't overly sweet which is a good thing, the mango ice cream was a very generous scoop and mango cubes were sweet as well. If you love mango, this is the dessert choice for you! \n\nNow onto the egg puffs! Before when I got it, the inside was very cakey. I think they used a pancake batter. It wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as Eggettes which is still my number one place to go to for egg puffs. However when I bit into the egg puff this time, it tasted exactly like Eggettes! Omg I was so happy. Don't know what they changed about their batter but I hope they never change it again. \n\nService can be kind of slow even if it is nearly empty because there's only one worker taking orders and making the cold desserts and I'm guessing only one or two workers in the back who make the hot food orders.

The waitress was kind of slow to answer questions especially when I asked in english. My Chinese wasn't good enough to ask in Chinese hence why I stuck with English (their menu had English, too). I asked what flavors of ice cream did they have, she answered (with a little bit of difficulty), I asked is that all?, and she was kind of confused after that. \n\nEventually, I ordered the fried banana which came with two scoops of ice cream, I chose green tea and mango. \n- The fried banana inside tasted delicious but the outside batter tasted more like just oil than batter. I couldn't stand eating more than half of what was given. \n- The green tea ice cream was TASTELESS and ODD. There was no green tea flavor almost, random pieces of (what I can guess) dried fruit, and tasted like freezer burn or ice cream that was melted and re-frozen multiple times. \n- Finally, the mango ice cream tasted the best out of the whole dish and I'm not even a big fan of mango! It tasted fresh, perfect level of sweetness, and refreshing. \n\nI'm not sure if they buy or make their own ice cream, but I'm extremely disappointed with the green tea ice cream as it is my favorite flavor.

There were 6 of us, so they put us at a big table in the front next to the window. As soon as we sat down, everything felt... sticky. The table, the chairs, probably even the walls if we dared to touch them. After the worker placed the menus on the table, we literally had to peel them off.\n\nWe glanced through the menu and saw an assortment of delicious-sounding desserts. Steamed egg custard, steamed milk custard, sesame paste, egg puffs, blended fruit drinks. I wanted to try their milk tea pudding, but they were out. Boo. My mom wanted to try their black sesame paste, but they were also all out of that. But they had enough to make two servings of the steamed egg custard with sesame paste... wait, what? (They're also supposed to be open until midnight or so? And they're out of these staples already?) We shrugged and just let it go and ended up ordering two steamed egg custards with sesame paste, a mango smoothie, sesame egg puffs, and momo chacha (a dessert with taro chunks, yams, sago, and coconut milk).\n\nAs we waited, we began regretting the fact that we ordered pretty much all hot desserts. Even though the front door was open, there was zero air flow at the table we were seated at. And it was next to a window, so the sunshine that filtered in was magnified. It was like sitting in a greenhouse. We thought about asking to move, but that was their only large table, so we would all have to split up. It was a family outing, so... no dice on that.\n\nThe desserts came, and yeah, they were pretty good. (Except the mango smoothie... can someone say syrup overload?) We tried to eat as fast as we could so we wouldn't melt, but we also didn't want to burn our tongues on the hot food. Dilemmaaaaa. We eventually made it through, paid our bill, and rolled out. We interacted with the worker a total of six times: when she told us where to sit, when she set the menus down, when she took our order, when she gave us our bill, when she returned for the bill, and when she returned to give us the receipt. No friendly service here.\n\nSo, My Favorite Cafe? Not really. I would much rather go to one of the many other HK dessert shops in the Richmond area.

The star rating is mainly for the food; they have like literally everything that you would probably find in a HK style dessert cafe, but nothing special or notable comes to mind. That said, friends and I have gotten food from chicken wings to smoothies to fries to mango to turtle jelly. Of the ones I've had, none were terrible, though none really stuck out either. Most are good as comfort food if you're just looking for a safe late night snack.\n\nThe reason this would actually qualify as one of my favorite cafes is the atmosphere. They have a TV and music going, and combined with the number of people that are usually there on weekend nights, the level of noise is sufficient to feel lively but not so much that you can't hear your own table. More importantly, they carry some cards and a few board games (like 5 sets of chinese chess) in the back for customers to freely use and play. Many memories of playing the nights away with Uno and Monopoly Deal were spent here for me.\n\nOne thing I wish they would do, on that note, is to maybe get some new sets. From what I remember, they were getting somewhat old and missing cards. But I'll keep going back as long as they keep that setting.", "author": "Tony D."}

I have been coming here for ages and I like that not much has changed.  Still don't like parking in the area though.  They still show random talk shows on the TV, are still a popular hangout for large young groups, still have so many off-menu items taped all over, have old men playing Chinese checkers loudly at night...  And they still use real ingredients for their desserts.  This place is the best if you're looking for traditional Chinese desserts. \n\nLately, my favorite has been the sweet potato soup (\u756a\u85af\u7cd6\u6c34) which has a heavenly amount of ginger in it.  It's got an amazing spicy punch and it's hard to find anywhere else but home that will add so much ginger into the soup.  They also use different types of sweet potatoes so you've got shades of purples, oranges, and yellows while you eat.  Recently, they've also had steamed milk custard with durian (\u69b4\u84ee\u71c9\u5976) and it is a bowl of steamed milk chock full of durian pieces.  Of course, if you want something more normal, the mango delight (mango pomelo sago soup, \u694a\u679d\u7518\u9732) is a great safe choice. The steamed rice noodles are the best here too.

I guess I imagined my tapioca to be like boba and was a little bit disappointed that they were the small sago balls (yeah, I know it's tapioca but I guess I had something else in mind). You can also switch it out for grass jelly. It was pretty good and nicely filled with fruit and not skimpy on it. For $5 I have no complaints and was very happy with it. We also ordered the chicken wings with fries and thought it was good too. It came with like 4-5 pieces of chicken. Besides being served hot tea, we also ordered iced lemon tea  that was delicious. I smooshed too much of the lemon in so it was tasting a bit sour and bitter but that's all on me.\n\nService was better than most dessert places I've been to.

Yes, you heard me, that's the KEY for Asian food. And each one of them I tried was done extremely well.\n\nDeep fried Chinese bun was very crispy outside and hot but not doughy inside.\n\nRice rolls was very soft and done just right with some firmness to it. Good they only put very little peanut sauce and separated it as a side in addition to the hot and Hoisin sauces. Very very delicious.\n\nThe steam milk custard with ginger was also steamed perfectly hot, burning tongue hot and it's so silky soft like egg white.

Our first choice was so packed and busy that we decided to find a different spot and stumbled upon this cafe.\n\nThe place looked a little bigger than our primary choice and it wasn't as busy.  The menus were laid down nicely on the tables and the women working seemed nice.\n\nA lot of the food on the menu sounded REALLY GOOD.  I wanted to order just about everything but I resorted to the Steamed Rice Noodles, Snow Frog w/ Half a Papaya, and Fresh Strawberry Juice.\n\nThe juice was fantastic, I love strawberries and I loved that they even carry such a thing on their menu.  Steamed rice noodles always taste delicious, I love that it's served with sriracha.  And the Snow Frog w/Half Papaya was pretty good... The ice cream melts pretty fast but it's super fulfilling.\n\nIt's definitely a place we both would come back to to try out more food :D", "author": "Eleanor E."}

First of all, I am not saying I'm a professional food critic, but I do have a pretty high standard when it comes to my food. I do not mean high end priced, but its all about the full package from service, atmosphere, and the quality of food.\n\nI've been to this place every now and then over the years and each experience has been average, there were no complains and yet no praises either. From what I thought, this place would have gotten a 3 star instead of 4 (again, I'm harsh in judging). But during my last visit there, they really left me with a sour note and it made me really reconsider about going back there at all.\n\nFirst of all, it was so busy there (Friday night, not unusual) that we had to wait for about an hour, not to mention we actually were there early too (about 9pm?) So the wait was not fun, although, I figured if the food was decent along with the company of my friends, it's worth the wait. WRONG! We sat down with two small tables combined and it took awhile for them to actually behind taking our orders (there were two girls working). Then it took them awhile to bring us our drinks; meanwhile, I saw them conversing behind the counters.\n\nI ordered the black sesame paste and it was luke warm WITH lumps in it. Clearly it was powder made and not thoroughly mixed! Then my boyfriend's longan drink and he was reluctant to say anything, but I took a sip and OMG, I thought I just took a sip of whatever they squeezed out of that towel they wipe the tables down with. It was basically faucet water with longan (cut up ones, not even full). It was just disgusting so I had to say something.\n\nI asked one of the girls over and asked them if they serve the drink with water. She looked around, confused, and said yes. I felt like she's just humoring me. I don't own a dessert cafe, but doesn't those longan fruits they use come in a can and there's usually syrup served inside? Would it REALLY be that much more less economical to just pour in those syrup to prepare for the drink? The least you can do is dilute it instead of serving it with faucet water.\n\nI fully understand times are rough and restaurants are cutting back, but it should not downgrade the quality of food to sewage. That's just disrespectful to your customers! Maybe I came at a very bad night and the girls JUST happen to be new there and didn't know how to serve a proper drink and dessert. No matter how great of an experience I had before, ONE extremely bad experience really turns everything upside down.

No complaints here, that means we have the waiter's attention all to ourselves. The menu was pretty extensive and yet again I had trouble deciding what I wanted. I usually go with my gut feeling by looking at the pictures but they were so tiny (thumbnail size) and weren't so many to look at. What a bummer! I asked about the Fun Fun Mango, it seemed too daring at the time; coconut flavored ho fun noodles with mango. I eventually settled with the Mango madness and my friends had the strawberry madness. The waiter then got to work (he's the only one working at the time), I know the food was definitely worth the wait because when he came with his tray of goodies, I noticed the strawberry was sculpted so beautifully. It was indeed, edible art and tasty as well. Overall, It was decently priced for icecream, mango pudding, and real fruit ~ $5.

But maybe the owners/servers get a similar joke at times?\n\nWell, last night was my first time going to My Favorite Cafe, and I must say I rather liked it. It was actually my first time to be in the Outer Richmond part of Clement Street, and I thought it was a lot calmer/local-centric than the Inner Richmond part of Clement. The inside of the cafe/restaurant is lit with hard fluorescent bulbs, so that gives off a different feel from most \"usual\" cafes. Don't come here if you expect to find a \"cozy, calm\" place to sit and read.\n\nI find that as I frequent more Chinese/Asian cafes, the ambience definitely differs a lot from the American POV of cafes. Inside a Chinese cafe, it's the usual hustle-bustle of a restaurant, but people can sit and chat for ages on end. The noise level can vary inside; nobody really thinks to be quiet at an Asian cafe. The atmosphere is more lively, casual, and less intimate. In some strange way, I find this all relaxing to me; it makes me really get a feeling of home.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual review of My Favorite Cafe.\n\nThe menu at MFC is impressive; there are cafe specialties, sandwiches, noodles, hot AND cold desserts, and specialty drinks. All items are priced under $10, so one can definitely get a bargain bite at MFC. However, most of the foods are unhealthy, but...hey, sometimes it's okay to indulge.\n\nI ordered the curry fish ball with rice noodle for my meal; The curry fish balls were tender and had a kick of spice to them. I wasn't too happy to see the noodles and fish balls swimming in greasy/fatty broth, but I had to comment to my friend Mellie P. about how MFC seemed to be a \"good place to eat at to treat a hangover\". Granted, I rarely ever drink until I get a hangover, but I've heard from many other peers about how greasy food is good for \"sopping up\" the alcohol from one's system.\n\nAside from the greasy brother, the meal itself was tasty and filling. Afterwards, I had dessert: sesame-filled dumplings. 5 cute mochi/rice ball dumplings in clear brother; the mochi had a good texture to it and had a hint of sweet saltiness. The servers were very generous in re-filling our cups with tea and letting Mellie P. and I sit at the cafe for 3 hours chatting.....\n\nThe clientele consisted of a mix of Asian/Asian-Americans. MFC looks like a good place for families, party-goers, and young people alike. I'd love to live near a place like this, just knowing that I could pop in at midnight and order some food/dessert from them.\n\nI'm curious to try the \"stewed snow frog\" listed under both the hot and cold desserts sections. I will probably order that the next time I am back at My Favorite Cafe.\n\nOh, and I hate to say it, but I think \"My Favorite Cafe\" could very well become MY favorite cafe in the City. =P", "author": "Helene K."}

Then we split egg puffs. The banana split was pretty big and I was already full from dinner so I had trouble finishing it. The egg puffs were delicious. They were crispy on the edges which I love.\n\nWhen we went, it was pretty empty. They had a TV turned to ABC so we ended up staying and watching Dancing with the Stars for a bit.

This place offers affordable snacks and desserts and a place to just talk and play card games or what not. \n\nYes, why do I think this is the best in the city, it's because the variety of things you can get here is probably greater here than other places.

It's located all the way out in the Richmond District where there is no parking whatsoever. Yes you can drive around and get lucky, but if not, try walking 3-5 blocks. What sucks even more is that once you get to the front door of the cafe, some car leaves right in front of the place. \n\nAnyhow, my definite top choice in late night cafes is My Favorite Cafe hands down.  My favorite selections are posted in the picture section, but my recommendations are as follows:\n\n- Peanut Butter French Toast\n- Mixed Fruit in honey dew juice with sago\n- Mango Madness\n- Strawberry Madness\n- Instant noodles with fried egg and spam\n- Soy sauce chicken wings", "author": "Michael J."}

It was soooo sooo bland, overcooked and DRY! I'm assuming they reheated it in the microwave and served it to me but it took pretty long for them to bring it out so not sure what they did. \nNext my friends got some kind of ginger dessert and she hated it.

I had a huge craving for desserts last Saturday night and off we went to My Favorite Cafe! I thought this name was pretty conceited and I was ready to prove them wrong (or right). We walked in and it wasn't crowded, just two other groups of people. Immediately I noticed the awkward dim lighting and messy tables. I would think since it's not that crowded, they would try to clean up a bit. We sat down at the least dirtiest table since no one told us where to sit. A server girl came to wipe it down and got crumbs on me. =/ All I thought was, food better be good! \n\nMilk Tea Pudding - I saw a delicious looking picture of this on yelp so I already knew I was going to order this. I love milk tea! And I love pudding. But I barely even liked this dish. It was very bland, tasted like no flavor jello but with the slightest hint of tea. The condensed milk and chocolate shavings on top was a good effort but that ran out quick. \n\nMixed Fruit with Tapicoa and Mango Juice - This was much better. The mango juice was very sugary but had a nice, thick mango puree consistency. Tapioca and fruit is usually a good combo. \n\nOnion Rings - This was run of the mill and was a small portion served on a tiny plate. I'd say maybe seven rings? They didn't even offer us ketchup. \n\nThere are a lot of other places I want to try so I doubt I'll be back here again. I do recommend coming here or to any dessert cafes with a bigger group so you can try more things without looking like a total fatty.", "author": "Julia T."}

Looking for something nearby, we opted for My Favorite Cafe to satisfy our dinner and sweet tooth craving.\n\nFor the food during our visit, we ordered the chicken sandwich (includes fries) and sesame dumplings. The chicken sandwich tasted a bit like the chicken burgers one can get at Burger King... except with bread rather than a bun. That's nothing bad, but worth noting. At $5, it was a good value. The sesame dumplings were also good, and a nice warm dessert.\n\nOverall, we have nothing particularly bad to say about this place.

I wanted to go to a new dessert place since we always go to Golden Island, Creations, or Kowloon Tong Dessert. \n\nSince it was a cold rainy night I wanted to get something hot. The menu was huge. They had cold dessert selections such as ice cream and the regular watermelon juice with sago and mixed fruits. Hot desserts such as hot red bean soup (which i got) and dun don. They also have specialty desserts such as mango with flat rice noodles which I thought was kind of weird. They also have milk tea pudding which sounded pretty good but I needed something HOT. Everything on the menu was mostly under $4-5. \n\nThey also had cake choices and that night they had tiramisu and cheesecake. There was an atomic ice cream bowl or something and our guy friends HAD to order that for the girls. It came with a scoop of green tea ice cream, chocolate, strawberry, mango, and I think the last was vanilla. We totally couldn't finish that. It was TOO big and too much. Even the guys couldn't finish the rest. Everything was pretty okay. Nothing really to wow about but then again I'm not really a big fan of Asian desserts. Probably a good place to just sit and have dessert with a couple of friends.

Only Katie K. had been to the cafe, but only for dessert, so testing out the savory food was new for all of us.  As far as I can tell, it's a pretty typical Chinese/HK style cafe.  You get hot tea in plastic drinking cups, lots of savory and dessert options and low prices.  I opted for the beef stew over egg noodle (nixed the pork chop that accompanied the meal cause that's too much food).  The beef stew was tasty, but nothing too special.  The stew didn't lend too much sauce onto the noodles, but there was this small amount of paste that was off to the side of the bowl that added a great semi-salty taste onto the already yummy egg noodles.  The fried egg over medium (how I like my eggs) was a nice addition as well.  \n\nWe also ordered onion rings and besides catching up with old schoolmates, is the reason I wanted to go to My Favorite Cafe.

I'd say this was the second worst egg puff I ever had. Should had driven to eggettes instead.", "author": "Gordon C."}

It looked really clean and bright from the outside as we drove by Sunday night at 11.\n\nWe parked and headed inside.  The menu is large, yet seemingly lacking in the tofu department.  We decided to try a handful of items: deep fried sweet breads, beef stew with lettuce, curry fish balls, and green tea shake.  The service was fairly spot on with tea brought by with regularity and tables being cleared immediately after patrons left the cafe.\n\nThe green tea shake was a little strange.  The wafer cookie inside was good, yet the taste of the drink overall had a strange green tea and matcha flavor with cardboard-esque aftertaste.  It wasn't what we expected, but it was fine by any means.\n\nThe sweet breads are delectable.  If you love condensed milk, then this little piece of dough will not let you down as it comes with a condensed milk as a dipping sauce.  \n\nThe curry fish balls had a ton of cumin and packed a small punch.  \n\nAs for the beef stew with lettuce, my first impression was why would you order this?  It smelled like an Asian Big Mac.  I kid you not.  The wilted lettuce and random beef bits in the sauce seemed like a scaled back stew and smelled just like secret sauce.  Strange...  It was fairly tasty though.\n\nIf you come here after 8, make sure you plan on ordering something at least $2.50 in value.  Also, make sure you bring cash as that is all they accept.\n\nI would certainly hit this place up if I lived in the area.

We started coming here so often for a spell that the owner would always say 'hi' when we walked in, immediately seat us, regardless of the hour, and would take our orders in a timely fashion. We've watched them turn people away who walked in right after us - now THAT'S service to loyal patrons! Another bonus about MFC is that they don't have a minimum (as far as I can tell) per person for ordering - which means you don't HAVE to get something even if your friends have the munchies; many places do have this kind of rule, and I find it to be stupid. Nicely done MFC.\n\nThey have a pretty basic setup; when you walk in, there are a row of tables to your right for smaller parties - say, less than 4, and some rounds pushed together for parties of 5 or more. There's a stack of magazines in the back in Chinese, and they always have some kind of entertainment channel running on the TV in the back, and I think they offer wireless now too. There are also 2 front seats with four comfy chairs, but be warned it's ALWAYS cold in those window nooks! It can feel more private sitting over there, but it can make it more of a challenge to flag down a server to get stuff taken care of. \n\nMFC has an extensive menu, and there is always something that you want on it, from egg puffs to sundaes to hot desserts to numerous cold desserts to savories like fish balls and fries. We usually order at least one of everything I have named, and we have still not tried everything on the menu - there are close to 130+ items. While the fruit is not as fresh as Creations, they make up for it in the level of extensive menu, and having things on the menu clearly labeled, which is a plus when you are allergic to peanuts (this has been a problem for me in other Chinese dessert cafes). They are usually pretty quick about turning the orders out, but things can come out unevenly from time to time - tonight, we waited for our waffle sundae to come out for an ungodly amount of time, but I think part of that was to blame on the waitstaff - they have some majorly ditzy girls working there right now, but they were eager to help, and came around and refilled the hot tea that is always served. \n\nI have been so many times, and cannot remember a single time I walked away disappointed. I am always blessed with good friends who go with me, and we always have had a good time.\n\nParking can be a nightmare here, and it's cash only, but for now, it will always be \"My Favorite Cafe\"", "author": "Jessica S."}

I like the restaurant how its very decorative and cute.. but the food.. wasn't the best. So i ordered rice noodles with curry balls which was a big mistake because first of all they gave me like 3-5 curry balls in a big bowl of rice noodles with water O.O. It was soo hard for me to finish and i was really upset because this was the very first CAFE my boy friend took ME!! he also ordered a milk tea which it totally didnt even taste like milk tea, for one thing it jus tasted like raw tea and they put food coloring into the milk tea to look like milk tea i don't know..\n    Well soo because i wasnt full at all, i thought maybe the deserts would taste better. My boyfriend ordered a sundae... that stuff was sooo sweet!!\n  Maybe i just didn't pick the right food from this restaurant and there and hopefully next time if i DO come back to this place, i just hope it would be better.

Its their name, which sucks, because it isn't really MY favorite cafe. But I don't feel like the crappy customer service at Kowloon Tong.\n\nwhich leads to a meager 3-stars at Kowloon Tong. I had the mango delight (yeung gee gum lo) which is mango + pomelo + small tapioca. It was sickening sweet and lacked the fruity flavors. The friend ordered 2 scoops of ice cream. Now - my advice to you - when you go to a HK-style cafe, you don't order ice cream! You know that they get their ice cream from those 2 gallon buckets at Foods Co. Its like going to Baskin Robbins and ordering **gasp** Vanilla! No offense, but you can buy a half-gallon of Dreyers at Safeway for wayyy less. Ok, back to topic. So the friend gets her 2 scoops of green tea ice cream and it was horrid. It was bitter, had no green tea flavor whatsoever, and had that ice burn smell. Nasty. So we asked the server if we can get another flavor instead. The server was very nice and promptly exchanged it to Mango for us. Once again, nothing spectacular. It was sweet and had that artificial flavoring color. Note to My Favorite Cafe: please do your customers a favor order your ice cream from Magnolia or Polly-Anns.. or at least get the real stuff with no artificial flavoring!", "author": "Nancie T."}
