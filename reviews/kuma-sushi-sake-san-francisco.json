Man, I was so happy after my meal, and wanted to finish it off with uni - but then I bit into it. There seemed to be some kind of salt rock (?) in the sushi.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-11", "description": "This is the first time I have been to Kuma! I've passed by it many times and finally decided to grab a late dinner there. It was surprisingly busy for a Thursday night at 9pm (they close at 10). Actually had to put myself on the waitlist. They have a standing tablet that you sign in on to get on the waitlist. It's really nice because you can see who is in front of you and how many people are in their group. It gives you a pretty good idea of wait time! They also text you when your table is about to be ready. \n\nOnce at the table, we had great wait staff and got to enjoy the ambiance of the small (but well designed) space. They had a couple Halloween decorations up and their menu was even Halloween themed! They didn't over-do it though and it was very tasteful and cute. I enjoyed the extra effort and creativity that went into naming some of the rolls. \n\nThe food all tasted very fresh and had crisp flavor. We started with edamame, miso soup, and the seaweed salad. I would definitely say the edamame was over salted, but maybe that just my personal presence, as my partner didn't mind. I would definitely recommend the miso soup and the seaweed salad as starters. \n\nFor main course, my partner got the nigiri tasting which was good. We also ordered the \"scary salmon roll\" which was very fresh and had nice subtle lemon hints. Then got the \"hellish half baked\" roll which was a little disappointing. It just didn't have a ton of flavor for having such great ingredients. I didn't even taste the crab in it, but there was a lot going on in that roll as well, and it is baked so the flavors mix a little. \n\nFor desert, I got the \"unearthly ube\" ice cream (per the recommendation of our waiter) and it was perfect! It was sweet but also tasted very natural. The sweetness wasn't overpowering, and the portion size was perfect, it made for a great end to the meal. \n\nOverall, this place exceeded my expectations. The check in service was refreshing and smooth, the food was good, the wait staff was attentive and helpful. I'll definitely visit again!", "author": "Tessa M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-28", "description": "We have been here a few more times since their opening a year ago. Here are my thoughts:\n\nDinner is definitely a lot busier. The service drops down a bit and feels like the wait staff is short handed. We had to wait a lot longer to place second round of orders, get the bill, or have empty plates taken away. \n\nLunch: Slower and more mellow time to eat here. The lunch special increased price from $15 to $17 over time which is still a pretty decent price for the special. If I'm going to be particular, the portion size of the salad has gotten a bit smaller and I don't get mushrooms in my soup. Regardless it's not a deal breaker for me. It's still a nice side for the meal and presentation is still nice. I really like all their combo options and chirashi bowl, but the sushi combo is probably my favorite. \n\nOne thing that I do wish is they offered tempura as a side. They only offer it as a complete lunch set for $17. I asked the server if I could order side of mix tempura and he said they don't do that. And that was that. Kind of a bummer and also a loss of $8 or so that I would have been willing to spend for a small appetizer portion of mix tempura. They seem pretty set in their ways for only what the menu specifies and offers. Maybe they have a set portion aside for lunch specials though, so I could see that. I just see it as a missed opportunity for more profit and offering on their end. They could simply even charge a little extra as an add-on to the specials.\n\nTake out: I know from the beginning they didn't allow take out orders and don't know if they still officially don't do take out, but for what it's worth I did see someone at the bar place take out and leave with a take out order. So maybe it's limited take out?\n\nSo.. Is it the best sushi in SF? No. And service was a whole lot friendlier when they first opened.. But I will say it's still good, fresh, with ok prices, and the location is really the ultimate convenience for us with a lunch and dinner offering that will keep us coming back when we don't want to venture out to the marina for our favorite sushi spot.", "author": "Natassia S."}

Both were delicious. \n\nThe half baked roll was the standard creamy baked salmon one, which was pretty good though a little sweet. \n\nThe explosion was like deep fried sushi with some hot sauce in addition to the unagi like sauce on top.\n\nI'd probably be back to try some of their nigiri or other delectable items!", "author": "Tyler T."}

They also appeared to have a daily menu, as noted by the day printed with ink, as well as a menu with all their classics.\nBetween the two of us, we shared a Shishito Peppers ($7) and a Hamachi Ponzu ($14) small plate. She had the Osuimono (5) and a 4-piece Nigiri Tasting ($18). I had a 8-piece Nigiri Tasting ($36). We also ordered 2 carafes of different cold sakes that she selected. Each carafe was able to serve around 5-6 shot glasses of sake.\n\nEverything was fantastic.\nThe Shishito Peppers were a delight to see on the menu, with a couple of ones having fiery pepper seeds (probably not the best for people who cant handle heat). The Hamachi Ponzu was pleasing to the eyes and had 6 nice cuts of yellowtale, tamago, and green onion for d\u00e9cor. The sakes paired very nicely with everything. The nigiri, which my Lil told me was the thing-to-get, as if there were only one, was fantastic - fresh, melt-in-your-mouth, flavorful, and did not need anything else.\n\nIt was a great experience and well-worth the wait, even after an intensive gym sesh.", "author": "Kevin W."}

I especially enjoyed the Hokkaido uni, hotate, salmon belly, and tobiko nigiri. The only thing I wish was done differently was for the escolar to be served completely raw, rather than soaked in lime juice as escolar ceviche.

I applaud Kuma for their fresh, high quality, and delicious sushi that makes you smile on your first, second, and last bite. Quite simply, this place has had the best sushi I've had in SF, everytime I've been here. To top it off, there wasn't a wait for lunch which makes me feel smug at all the other yuppies who are waiting 1 hour+ for mediocre brunch places nearby. \n\nThe four of us got seated quickly and had to hold back from ordering everything on the menu. The restaurant is quite small so I wouldn't recommend coming with a group bigger than 4.\n\nThe miso soup and seaweed salad was a great start. The soup was light and had just the right amount of saltiness. The seaweed salad was juicy and refreshing, with a nice tangy aftertaste.\n\nFrom there, we ordered the chirashi bowl and kuma poke bowl, which is only available for lunch. Both were fantastic! In particular, the kuma poke was more interesting than typical poke and didn't rely on heavy sauces for flavor.\n\nFor the main course, we received the great balls of fire, california roll, rainbow roll, tango roll, and shrimp tempera roll. \n1. Great Balls of Fire got mixed reviews from our table. I thought the battered, warm texture was a great contrast to the rest of the sauces & toppings. It was my favorite for the day. Others thought it was the weakest link. \n2. The California Roll and Rainbow Roll are the best I've had in San Francisco. They use real crab instead of imitation crab, and that makes a HUGE difference. \n3. The Tango roll perfectly balanced the strong flavors of mango, tuna, and chili. Given the strong flavors, I wouldn't get this roll just for myself, but it was a fantastic roll to share in a group. \n4. We actually ordered the shrimp tempera on accident. We typically don't love shrimp but alas, a miscommunication landed us with a surprisingly delicious and upscaled version of the typical shrimp tempera you'd expect from a sushi place. They somehow made fried tempura feel healthy and refreshing by adding a light, crunchy lettuce and a delicate sauce.", "author": "Yuchen L."}

We watched him work his magic and whip up our sashimi and nigiri tastings. The fish varies in the tastings, depending on what's the seasonal selections for the day.

That was a hard search, but we were happy we found Kuma...eventually.\n\nSo Google Maps says Kuma is on the Post side, so make sure you stay on Polk! We walked in and were pleasantly surprised at how sophisticated yet simple this place felt. There was definitely an air of \"craft sushi\" noticed right away with their beautiful bar and ceramics displayed at the entrance. The restaurant itself is tiny and does not have too many seats (can probably only seat 4 smaller groups at tables and a few couples at the front window, and some couples and solo eaters at the sushi bar. All the designers I ate with marveled at their ceramics and aesthetics. \n\nI started with their small house hot sake, and they seemed to actually have more cold sake options vs hot! Surprising, since I'm a hot sake kinda gal. Bf got a beer, and the rest had hot tea. We were hungry, so started with the edamame, shishito peppers, and beautiful steamed egg custard in a gorgeous egg-shaped container (presentation is 100% here), a few sushi rolls: rainbow (my go-to), hey girl, and half-baked. They almost forgot our chawanmushi, but we reminded our servers and they brought it out in a few minutes. The sashimi cuts themselves on the special rolls were delicious and fresh, not too large, and definitely worth the prices. \n\nI'm excited to see if they will expand their special rolls because their nigiri prices are way too costly for my wallet. Our bill did total over $100, so each person ended up paying almost $30. Not a pricey feat in SF for sushi, and this place has clean restrooms and a homey kind of feel.

I didn't think the baking added a lot to the roll, actually made the fish on top a but over cooked in my opinion, and would have been better torching instead for a smokier flavor while keeping the fish half cooked and half raw for better texture.", "author": "Terrie C."}

We ordered the Great Balls of Fire, a special roll that came with a bit of tart lemon-y sprinkle over each bite (forgot the name woops but it had more of a latin style to it), and hamachi crudo as a small plate! We also ordered the sayuri cold sake which had a creamy, light, and smooth texture. Small lil thang but packs a punch! \n\nWe loved the Great Balls of Fire although tiny tiny that I felt maybe it should be considered an appetizer/small plate.

We put our names down, and after being told it was a 30-45 minute wait, we left our number and decided to go to a bar nearby to kill some time while waiting.\n\nWe ordered a couple rolls along with a couple small plates and nigiri to share.\n\nMasu toro ($9) - the ocean trout belly tasted okay but not as fatty as I was expecting\n\nAmaebi ($8) - the amaebi here was pretty standard, i.e. it was melt-in-your-mouth good! one of my favorite nigiri pieces at any sushi spot\n\nTamago tofu ($10) - chilled version of chawanmushi, which is a savory egg custard. I love chawanmushi, and while this was good with the ikura topping, I wish it had been served warm\n\nHalf Baked ($14) - essentially Kuma's version of the lion king roll as it is a crab and avocado roll topped with salmon, green onions, tobiko, spicy mayo, and baked. This was my favorite dish of the night!\n\nKuma Roll ($14) - sweet potato tempura topped with bbq eel, roasted almonds, and unagi glaze. We ordered this because 1) it's the restaurant's namesake roll and 2) I was intrigued by the sweet potato tempura, but all the flavors mixed in my mouth and it was hard to taste the sweet potato and eel\n\nThe space is very small and intimate.

Chefs Ryo and Cory have collaborated for a long time on the SF sushi scene and that partnership shows up in spades at Kuma, right on Polk and Post. When your options in the area are fast-casual, bar food and pizza, it's a godsend to have a neighborhood sushi spot. \n\nThey have a rotating seasonal menu but the stand-outs are as follows:\n\n- Chawanmushi: Ok, it's not sushi but this is a silky, savory egg custard to beat all egg custards. It's spiked with the latest batch of housemade fish broth and you'll want to get your own to catch the scoops of cheese, crab and mushroom speckled throughout. Bonus adorable egg vessel. \n\n- Ankimo anything: Even for avid sushi addicts, monkfish liver might be a new adventure for you. It's underrated and shouldn't be. The texture and flavor is unique and it doesn't need any embellishments to make it shine. \n\n- Kuma Roll: Any namesake roll is going to be a smash and this one doesn't disappoint. Unagi and sweet potato tempura is a match made in heaven. \n\n- Hamachi Kama: Get at me Japanese yellowtail collar. The ponzu sauce is super light and the fish tastes like fresh ocean dreams. \n\n- Magic Mushroom Roll: This one's a specialty \"sometimes\" roll with tempura mushroom that just gives and gives. \n\nP.S. Kuma means \"bear\" in Japanese. It's fun to see how that comes to life subtly in their menu logos and in the bathroom decor. :)\n\nP.P.S. Go solo at the bar counter, break nori with a friend or date, and enjoy a small group outing. Not meant for big extravaganzas though.", "author": "Faith Y."}

And, you can REALLY get your money's worth a la FREE DETOX! You may break your toilet but hey, at least you're 10 lbs lighter by the end of the week.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum are high end omakase places that are popping up all over SF. Most are good but not practical for everyday eating. \n\nEnter Kuma Sushi + Sake. \n\nThey serve great quality sushi at reasonable prices. It's a solid neighborhood sushi bar (NO reservations) where you can regularly get your raw fix without having to eat Nongshim ramen bowls for the rest of the week. \n\nThe dinner menu has starters, tasting spoons, salads, small plates, sashimi, nigiri, maki rolls, specialty rolls, and dessert (Mitchell's ice cream): http://bit.ly/2wAFKge. There's a daily specials menu showcasing the fresh fishes for the day: http://bit.ly/2v2lXqp. There's also a nice curated sake list with nothing over $18 a carafe: http://bit.ly/2x9jXtS.\n\nDuring the soft opening, I visited for lunch which has a limited menu ($12-$14): http://bit.ly/2wvk9H2. All orders come with a housemade mushroom miso soup and a salad which is a steal!\n\nI decided to go with the Chirashi ($14) and while waiting for it, I was presented with a Daikon & Wakame Salad: http://bit.ly/2wkpb8B. It was crisp, refreshing, and had good umami from the bonito flakes. A large cup of Mushroom Miso Soup soon followed: http://bit.ly/2vlNezD. I usually pass on the miso soup from restaurants as it tends to MSG water but this miso soup was really clean tasting (not salty) with cubes of silken tofu. \n\nMinutes later, I received a beautifully assembled Chirashi: http://bit.ly/2xpK8Mu with 6 slices of neta and ikura over sushi rice. Everything was fresh and high quality for the price. My favorite was the sake toro as it was super buttery. The sushi rice was nicely seasoned and had the right temperature. \n\nFor $14, you get a good amount of food and I was full. That's until Ryo showed me a tray of Santa Barbara Uni that he just got in and I couldn't resist. I also ordered a pair of Uni Nigiri ($14): http://bit.ly/2v2m8lO. I'm glad I did because it was so good. The uni was sweet, briny, and deliciously creamy. \n\nI washed everything down with a small carafe of Toji-kan sake ($9). Just don't tell le boss. \n\nThe owners Ryo (formerly Domo and Pink Zebra) and Cory did a phenomenal job transforming the seedy Western Union space into a very inviting, contemporary, and zen space. There's only 12 seats at the sushi bar and a handful of two tops so come solo or with a date only! It's NOT a place to bring your entire posse to. \n\nRyo and Cory are very kind and humble guys, and I love that they're offering great quality sushi at non-gentrification prices.

There was a 10 people group there (w/ reservation) when I was there. Be prepared to wait. People tend to take A LONG TIME to eat. You can put your name down and get a drink elsewhere before dinner.  \n\nSeating is slightly awkward. There are four clusters of 3s, and a couple tables of 2s that can be combined for bigger groups. I think the bar seating should be re-arranged to accommodate groups of 2 and not have empty seats. \n\nAmbience is chill & dark (perfect for a date). Decor is chic, minimalistic and urban. Service is great, Mr. host is very attentive, but they seem a bit understaffed from time to time. \n\nPrice is very fair, especially for the city. Menu has variety. Only dessert right now is Michelle's ice cream (I had the UBE) - for $3, you get a big scoop! Worth it . But what is the \"eat until your full @ m.p.\" deal? I can't imagine how much that'd be and what they'd serve you. \n\nOverall food was just okay. We weren't impressed. In fact one of our rolls kinda a fell apart, we couldn't pick up the whole thing as one piece! Nigiri was fine, but weren't big fans of the roll. Sounded interesting on the menu but tastes not that great. Maybe we didn't order the right things? But since Kuma is new, I'd come back in a couple of months and see how things are then.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-24", "description": "I'm genuinely shocked at how high of a rating this new sushi spot has. Honestly, I'd give this place a lower rating (2 stars), if not for the nice chefs. And yes, I did just get back from Japan, and had some majorly legit sushi to compare this spot to in my mind, but that's not what this rating is based off of. \n\nLet's start at the beginning. Was pretty excited to hit up this spot for an after-work wknight dinner (around 6ish) with a friend. No line, got the last two counter seats. I took a quick glance at the fish in front of me, and felt a bit concerned. Everything was being diced up...for rolls. \n\nMy friend and I wanted to give their \"omakase\" a try, and that was the mistake. Actually, there were a few. I quote \"omakase\" bc this included a pineapple spicy tuna roll in the dinner, which I was truly shocked by. The first four dishes didn't include nigiri, which I was a little shocked by as well. And then when the nigiri actually came, the rice was hard?! As in, undercooked. I looked at my friend. She looked at me. We were very confused. In the end, we were offered ice cream, thinking it came with the meal...it did not. We were charged for it. I wouldn't have gotten it, had I known it was a choice. \n\nBoth of us, being SF natives, having been to nearly every which sushi and Japanese spot around the city, I was shocked that our meal of this caliber came out to 90pp (tax and tip included). For 50, maybe I'd be more okay with it, but still, no. I could list a handful of better Japanese restaurants around town that I would've gladly paid 90 for instead. \n\nLastly, service from the two sushi chefs were nice. They were kind and informative, which is what makes me feel so bad about writing this poor review. But the rest of their staff is uninformed about the menu, and the fish in general. I saw the sushi chefs explaining multiple times what was what etc. \n\nI've reread other reviews and it seems like their lunch menu is more worth it, but for dinner, it sure is not. I'll never come back for that \"omakase\" experience. And unfortunately, I can barely rate the fish, as I was so disappointed and caught up in the rice quality itself. \n\nPersonally, I'd never come here again. 3 stars.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

The food here surprisingly good! We had the sake (salmon) Kama (collar) and the size was huge! The skin was crispy and the fish was fatty and it paired p deftly with the ponzu daikon sauce. I had the chef's choice nigiri and it was very reasonably priced at $36 for 8 pieces. The fishes were sometimes marinated and/or included shisho leaves to enhance the flavors... really the selection contained the innovation and quality you would expect at a omakase restaurant. I think the chef's choice is an amazing deal. The chawamushi was flavorful and the dashi stock really made a big difference. The best part of the meal? The AMAZING uni from Hokkaido.... really fresh and really quality. It was about $18 for two nigiris but SO WORTH IT in my opinion. They also had uni from Vancouver and Boston which I will try next time. \n\nWe finished up the meal with tamago sushi (served cold which is a miss for me personally) and Ube ice cream from Mitchell's.

We wanted to go some place new and different for our last night in the city before heading back home and I honestly can't say enough about how spectacular our dining experience was.  \n\nWe were greeted with a warm welcome and sat at the sushi bar where we had a up close view of the amazing knife skills of the chef preparing our meal.\n\nWe started with the sashimi sampler - a beautifully plated sampling of 5 different fishes (2 pieces of each), then ordered three rolls and all were delicious. The Tango, a tuna and mango roll topped with ocean trout was luxurious and the trout was almost buttery.  The blind tiger, a spicy hamachi and jicama rolled topped with thinly sliced kumquat had amazing texture and the slight acid from the kumquat really added to the overall exceptional taste of the roll.  The faceplant, a vegetarian roll filled with steamed asparagus and jicama topped with Japanese eggplant could make a vegetarian out of the biggest meat eater. It was amazing!\n\nThe service was impeccable, the food was exceptional and the price was unbelievably reasonable.  This is a place we will visit every time we're in the city.", "author": "Donna A."}

Walked in at 8:30 ish w/o reservation and waited for ~10mins. The restaurant is SMALL but intimate. A sushi bar that fits ~10 and a few tables meant for couples and this three person vertical table looking out at the street. The bf, friend, and I got seated in the tiny tables. Although a bit squishy, it was cozy? i guess. lol. Definitely not a restaurant to go with a big group.\n\nLoved the table setting; very neat, clean, and cutely decorated. Our waitress was this cute bubbly Asian girl. She gave honest and good recommendations. After browsing, we decided on:\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n- Furikake Edamame ($4): soybean pods tossed with a house made seasoning and sea salt. My first time ordering edamame at a restaurant cause honestl, I think its a waste of money, but when we read this we had to try it. It was very appetizing and delicious especially with the sea salt. Had us licking our fingers!\n- Tamago Tofu ($10): chilled version of chawanmushi, Japan's savory egg custard topped with ikura. Never tried chilled tofu before but it was like eating cold egg similar to \"dun dan\". The egg was soft and the ikura was very fresh. \n- Osuimono ($5): slices of shiitake mushroom and tofu suspended in clear soup base made from that morning's fish bones. The soup was clear and pure to drink. \n\nNIGIR'S: (2 pieces per order)\n- Anago (saltwater eel, Pescadero) $9: This was absolutely delicious! So much flavor\n- Mirugai (geoduck, Oregon) $10: Must get! \n- Tai Kobujime (sea breamed cured in Kelp, Miyabi) $7\n- Ama Ebi (sweet shrimp, Japan) $9: the bf and friend loved this; very fresh. Came with the fried fish head. \n- Umi Masu (ocean trout, Scotland) $7: omggg. my ultimate favorite of the night!! So fresh and good. \n- Hirame (fluke, Korea) $7: loved how light this fish was but had a hint of mint flavor from the shiso leaf. another fav. \n- Uni (sea urchin, Santa Barbara) $16: sweet and creamy. yummm.\n\nROLLS:\n- Half Baked Roll ($14)\n- Negi Hama ($6)\n- Salmon Avocado Roll ($7)\n\nDRINKS:\n- Echigo ($6)\n- Hot Sake ($9)\n\nNigiri's were great and the price wasn't too over the top especially for the quality. We ordered seconds and thirds for Umi masu, mirugai, and hirame. In total for 3, our bill was ~239 pretip. Great dinner spot for couples cause of the vibe and atmosphere.

I really loved it. However after my last two experiences I will never come back. The last time my friend and I were sat in the front window. We waited 20 min and the waiter never ever brought us a menu or water. When we asked for it he acted like we were bothering him. We asked to move to the bar so we could have better service. The main chef was more attentive to us and got us things the waiter neglected to bring us. \n\nTonight I came in by myself. There was one seat available at the bar for a single person. I asked this same waiter if I could sit there and he told me the seat wasn't open. Seriously? A restaurant that takes no reservations, has many people waiting for a table, and you won't let a person who is by themselves sit  at a seat that is clearly available? Then I asked to place a to go order, and again he was extremely rude and with much attitude said we don't do to go orders. \n\nI will never go back and definitely not recommend.

I was definitely ready for some omakase after waiting in line an hour. \n\nAs with every new restaurant service is SLOOOOOOW. I think they're still working out how things should flow and are still in the process of training the wait staff. Also, as there are only two chefs behind the bar and they not only serve the bar but also the floor, things were definitely delayed. \n\nAfter what seemed to be forever, we finally got the arugula salad with dehydrated salmon skin, and the hamachi with ponzu. The arugula salad was pretty basic but the salmon added some dimension to what would've otherwise been a pretty boring salad. The hamachi was bomb. \n\nRyo then gave us some avocado topped with a huge chunk of uni on these little wooden spoons. We got lucky because they were running out. The chawanmushi had run out so I was pretty bummed out but luckily they still had most of the fish available. \n\nWe got a small plate of sashimi, a small plate of sushi, some rolls which were pretty standard but extremely fresh. Unlike the more adventurous appetizers (by Japanese standards) the sushi and sashimi were traditional which I quite like. \n\nHero of the day was the monkfish liver. You should get it.

Kuma's atmosphere was a nice escape from the noise outside. They have great ambiance, the music selection was great, and the candle lit tables and semi-low lighting was a nice effect.\n\nAbout the food-while I enjoyed the 4 different rolls I had, I highly recommend trying the \"Great Balls of Fire\" with  panko breaded tuna and salmon roll, topped with sriracha, spicy mayo, unagi sauce, green onions, tobiko, and our house furikake. This roll is amazing! I had sake as well, which is always a nice touch with sushi.\n\nDo note-there was no sign above or in front of the building when I went there so don't just look for a sign. It's one store away from being right on the corner and has big windows in the front. Great for going on a date as well, that's what I did!", "author": "Kevin R."}

If you're trolling through yelp looking for a place with amazing sushi but won't set you back several hundred dollars, this is the place. I started with the chef's choice of 4 pieces of nigiri and wasn't disappointed. We then ordered salmon, yellowtail, ocean trout & fluke nigiri. The fish is fresh and buttery and the sushi rice has just enough vinegar in it and is perfectly soft. Lots of sake options if you're into that.

It may have also been the costliest meal I've had.  It was worth every penny.  Traveling on business solo on a Wednesday night, I wandered out of my hotel, happened across this place, checked yelp reviews, and chose to try it.  It was quite busy, but being alone I was seated at the sushi bar within 10 minutes.  I opted first for the Chef's Choice sashimi.  It was a piece of art...absolutely gorgeous.  I almost didn't want to ruin it by digging in.  The Japanese Black Sea Bream was a new experience for me.  It has a fantastic texture.  The Chef clearly knew his stuff; it was a perfect combination.  I added some nigiri.  When uni is right, it's really right, and this was an exemplary example of how good it can be.  I chose the more expensive San Diego caught uni and it was worth it.  They had monkfish liver!  I tried that years ago, loved it, and haven't been able to find it since.  Sounds weird, but if you have an adventurous spirit, I recommend trying it.  Finally, the person sitting next to me had Hamachi Kama - broiled japanese yellowtail collar.  It looked amazing, and he said it was extremely good.  Next time I'm in SF, I WILL be back to try that.", "author": "Andi B."}

Ever. \n\nExceptionally memorable were: Osuimono (soup), Sakekawa Arugula (salad), fried amaebi, Great Balls of Fire, and nigiris of Hirame, Sake toro, Marinated tuna, Saba, Ama Ebi & their fried heads. The Mitchell's ice cream of mango/pineapple/tropical paradise fruits was really nice. That may have been everything I ate sans 1 or 2 nigiris.\n\nI question whether the people who didn't have a good time get to taste their sake. It's Kuma Sushi + *Sake*. Have the sake. Or 3. If something's in the restaurant's name, you have to have it for your review to matter. But this is Yelp. What people say here generally don't matter. What I mean is, your $0.02 is worth $0.02 if you've had the sake. Otherwise it's worth -$10000 because you wasted my damn time. Anyway, we intended to have 1 carafe but ended up having 3, on a school night. It's delicious & you can do it. I believe in you. \n\nWe had Toji-Kan, Kikusui, and then Hakuro Suishu. The Hakuro was really delightful. It had hints of apple & yuzu and it was super smooth. Just go from top to bottom of the sake menu; Professionals thought about this for us so we don't have to. It's easier to tell how good something is if you work your way up and it gets noticeably better and better. Like life!\n\nFinally, the details. I really appreciate Kuma's decor, and how it combines Japanese aesthetic and traditional elements in a very lovely way. I also admire their support of local SF artists in their restaurant. The bar corner I sat featured a beautiful Seasonal Seafood Poster by Young America Creative, a local SF artist. Upon entering I also noticed a beautiful live wall with moss & live plants atop the wall of the back of the restaurant that I later learned that it was from a local artist from around the corner! \n\nThe food, the art, the drinks, the decor, and the people -- all of my favorite things. A new friend that I met 3 days ago who sat next to me at Halu recommended Kuma and I was pleasantly blown away. This is a thoughtful place, and the care that was put into the details is remarkable. \n\nKuma Sushi + Sake is well deserving of their success thus far & this was the best Wednesday I've had. I'd gladly come back every opportunity I get. I don't have any photos because I had my friend take them so I can eat.", "author": "Jenny W."}

Bare in mind that you are REQUIRED to be seated at the sushi bar if you'd like to try \"let us entertain you\" on the menu.\n\nA normal assumption is that the chef or at least someone would try and get to have a sense of what you prefer and do entertain you according to your flavour if fish isn't the main course here.\nOther wise why should that service be strictly served only by the sushi bar?\n\n1) Ryo was our chef. Standing right in front of us.\nWe tried making conversation without success since all the chef just seems to be rather disinterest in serving us. (The host was probably the only friendly staff there)\nNot once has anyone asked us if we preferred what or if there's anything we like or dislike.\n\n2) well without knowing your customers of course you're not gonna know what they want. Traditional omekase from my experience serves fishes that's fresh or they do accordingly to alternative mix of what the chefs wants to do and how you like it.\nThey fed us kale salad.\nI came to a sushi to have kale... salad hmmmm \nIf that was the case I would be in the marina or wholefoods wouldn't I?\nit was charged separately from the 8 pieces of fish. \n\n\n3) soft shell crab was horrible.\n It came. Well hot but it tasted uncooked. Not talking about the sushi grade sort of uncooked but sort of crewing on dead flesh sort of uncooked. \nDefinitely a 2 star. \nOf course it's not included within the \"let us entertain you.\" It cost around 14usd which was not worth the dime. \n\n4) the fish. It was so-so. Nothing that akiko , ryokos or sanraku can't provide or do better.\n\nMy advice.\nSave your money and go else where.\nSimply by reading others reviews about the friendly staffs, dim lighting and decor.\nWouldn't justify good Japanese food.\n\nFriendly staffs doesn't make the restaurant successful. \nEspecially when your service ain't consistent.\n\nI give 2 compare to the 3 Jennifer previously gave since \"friendly treatment\" was no where to be found on top of the lack of taste there was. \n\nWe walked out with a 120usd bill. 1 beer included.\nWe ordered a steamed egg as an extra but the rest was all charged separately with the \"8 pieces of fish\"\n\nThe fish was not particularly delicious or outstanding either. \n\nThat's all I have to say.

Ryo and Cory love what they do and were always willing to answer our questions.\n\nFirst we started with a tasty, smoky Osuimono soup - a rich, clear fish broth with pieces of mushrooms and sliced soy. The daikon salad was stacked high with arugula, fish flakes and fried salmon skin, and of course, lots of daikon. Then came the Sashimi tasting, chefs choice (photo below) - 5 kinds of fish (2 each) all the fish was yummy but the highlight was the trout belly - so buttery and rich.\n\nWhile we were deciding they showed us the flown-in box of soft shell crabs from Chesapeake. Of course we had one, fried up and they serve it with finger limes - squeeze and it looks like roe, breaks in your mouth like little lime flavored roe eggs. So delectable. See photos.\n\nThe Great Balls of Fire is just fun and gratifying. Panko breaded and deep fried tuna and salmon roll with several awesome sauces. Crunchy goodness.\n\nOne of their specialty rolls came up next, The Tango - Salmon, Mango, with a touch of spicy green pepper. Not overly sweet or spicey, just delicious.\n\nThen came the coup de grace - Chawanmushi - egg and gouda and mushroom and crab steamed in the same smokey broth as the soup of our first dish - so good.

It's a great intersection between quality and price.\nThere is a wide selection of fish to choose from. We ordered the sashimi special to start and later ordered nigiri to supplement. Everything we ordered tasted fresh and had a very rich taste. \nHere are a few highlights from the many things ordered:\nThe sashimi omakase style plate for $36 dollars was a great deal! It offered 5 different types of fish. To my surprise they gave a good variety with beautiful presentation.\nThe umi-masu(ocean trout) was a must have! It had such a unique flavor and was a stand out. It's great for people who like salmon toro but want something different. I'm sad that the masu-toro was sold out. The hotate nigiri(Japanese scallop) was a bit lacking compared to other places in the city (new oyaji and ryokos). It didn't have the same freshness and creamy taste as other places. The otoro was delicious but a bit pricy at $20 for two pieces. Otoro is good if you're really into the rich fatty taste but not a necessary part of the meal imo. Especially since there are other interesting things to try on this menu. I finished the meal with dashimaki tamago (egg with japanese stock) this was ok but it was lacking the umami flavor that is unique to dashi.  \nI cannot speak to the rolls at this place as I only ordered sashimi and nigiri. However, the fish is already so good and fresh by it self. It feels like rolls would be waste of the great quality and inherent flavor of the fish.\nFinally the bill came. We spent around $115 for 2 people on just food. I left satisfied but not stuffed. For this price point the service could have been better.\nThe service was a bit slow in general. But that was because they seemed understaffed for a Saturday night with only two waiters. They could use an extra person to help with checks and seating people. Numerous tables were waiting for simple things like checks and they could increase turn around on tables quicker if they had the extra help. On side note, I appreciated them refilling my tea and explaining what was presented on each dish despite them being so busy.\nBe sure to call to ask about the wait time. The line can get long around 8pm on the weekends. The place is pretty small and table are cramped. There isn't any privacy between tables so you can basically hear everyone's conversations.\nIdeal weekend scenario: Go here for dinner and go for karaoke at Yamasho after!", "author": "Summer B."}

Came to SF for a night and it was such a refreshing change from some of the sushi joints in South Bay. The service and food was absolutely perfect. The rolls are more unique and obviously a lot of thought is put into the menu. We had delicious chef's choice nigiri and a daily special roll, spicy tuna roll, and half baked. They were all delicious, and the ginger served with it was also yummy. We had some ube ice cream to top it off. So good! Quick, attentive service by one guy running through the place, and great food. Highly recommend and wish I was closer to visit again!", "author": "Nicole B."}

Being the sushi and sashimi purist that I am (raised on an island that just offered up some of the best world class cuisine, sushi and sashimi that almost jumped out because of its freshness, to tourists who can afford it), I've been on the hunt for something that would come close. Have been unsuccessful, until last night... Wanted sushi and sashimi for my main bday dinner, in spite of celebrating all weekend, having Malaysian in Milpitas, Italian in Newark, and bar eats to round out the first set of celebrations. We decided to make the trek into the city, hoping the yelp reviews didn't steer us wrong with Kuma. No reservations but came before 5:30pm, so was seated at the bar right away. Place is small, intimate, and easily gets loud. Seating is nice but again, small space means not too much elbow room, especially at the bar. Read through the menu while sitting in traffic on the bay bridge, decided on the omakase, chef's choice, $19, which gave 4 generous sized nigiri. We each had 3 rounds each so got to sample 12 of the Uber yummy and fresh fish, escolar, aka Hawaiian butter fish being our absolute best favorite of the entire offering. Uni was beyond fresh - it was sweet, melt in your mouth sea candy that almost made me swoon from the sensory overload. Just that good! We had the baby octopus karaage, hint of spice, tons of crunch, and boatload of flavor. Even though it was fried, it was not greasy or heavy. Very well done. We also had the daikon salad that was served with generous slivers of fish skin chicharon. Light ponzu sauce is worthy of bottling and being sold on its own. Miso soup was flavorful and served piping hot each time - we each had 4 bowls! I know, guilty. I don't drink anything cold with sushi or sashimi, since I was raised to only have hot green tea, hot sake, and hot miso soup, so yes, my tradition lives on :) Each delectable piece of sushi was artfully and (super yummy) tastefully done. Perfect tiny amount of lightly seasoned rice topped with the heavenly pieces of fish and seafood. Each bite transported you to a different level of appreciation and craving for all things good about sushi. I'd be proud to admit  the experience was transcendent. Our chef, Cory, topped off our amazing meal with 2 (gratis) scoops of Mitchell's ube ice cream - simple flavor, straightforward, wonderfully balanced - a perfect way to end the fantastic foodie experience. Not \"cheap\" or \"economical\" by any stretch of the imagination, but like they say, you get what you pay for. If you want fresh seafood and to be blown away by their true value, nay, their only value, aka flavor and freshness, Kuma delivers on this by giving you the heavenly experience in a well balanced atmosphere, that's also supporting local farms and seafood sources. Can't wait to go back!", "author": "Nida A."}

Cool breeze comin in the door, light chatter, and a stellar and smooth 90s hip hop playlist bumping throughout. I look at the lunch specials and order a maki combo. Little did I know this also comes with raw kale salad topped with dressing that could make my kitchen towels taste good and a miso soup. Miso soup was solid, no complaints here. Then comes the maki combo. You're gonna want to hear this. \nI am handed a plate:\nCalifornia roll two ways - one heavy on the cado with a small but powerful piece of crab beneath. Delicious. Other one was like a seafood salad with cado, mostly crab in the salad. Money. Then some fat chunks of spicy tuna piled high with cucumber and the other usual fixings. Absolute fire. Then the shrimp tempura. Shrimp tempura to bring it home. You gotta be kidding me. But these guys don't kid. They don't hit you with a bunch of cucumber and squash rolls when you get the maki combo. They don't throw yesterday's catch along with a bunch of veggies on your plate. None of that. This place is real deal. They leave it vague on the menu, something like \"4 rolls, 3 pieces each.\" So you really never know; it's the lunch combo, a lot of places would screw you and give you very limited raw fish. Not kuma. These guys came to play ball. And as I'm sitting here waiting for the check I remember this whole thing was $15. I'll be back tomorrow, and I would highly recommend.", "author": "Alex C."}

It was super busy the night we dropped in, but the staff was so accommodating, seated us right away, and encouraged us to try the delicious green tea ice cream which was SOOO good. The meal was so fresh and we had a great time. Will definitely return!", "author": "Haley D."}

Us and another lady couple were the only ones waiting when it opens.  The guy who opened the door (has tattoos) was so rude and that's before we even go inside. I offered to help hold the door and he declined rudely.  Then we happened to stand in his way in putting his standing signs by the door and without asking politely to move out the way he just put the sign.  Then we got in, when we told him there will be party of 8 (5 of us already there), he told us we can't b seated until all arrived.  Mind you there is no one else in the store except the other lady couple.  So we decided to change to just us, and when my mother-in-law started to sit down, he got upset for that.  He said he needed to reset the table.  That was the last straw....on Mother's Day.....we decided to just walk out...and went to moon star and stuffed ourselves. Glad didn't waste my money in that lousy bad customer service place.  Let's see how long this restaurant will survive with that kind of service in this neighborhood!!!", "author": "D T."}

Dishes came out in bizarre order all evening, got my edamame halfway through my meal and the staff completely forgot one of my appetizers admitting that he \"gave it to another table\" and then proceeded to say \"my bad.\" I think this is a great staple for the neighborhood but tbh I'd rather go to Domo in Hayes. Similar vibe, more fish choices, better service.", "author": "Cassidy M."}

Great atmosphere, great saki. The reason I give it 3 stars is the location. After dinner, My friend was assaulted by a man trying to get her purse right to the left of the restaurant on our way out. Go eat here, just please get dropped off right at the door.", "author": "Nicole B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-11", "description": "Came here on a Friday night and was able to be seated at the sushi bar immediately. The fish was very fresh and I opted for the $36 chef's choice. My biggest gripe is about their portion size. The cuts of fish were very thin and small and the flavor was a bit bland for a chef's choice tasting. I expected more continuity in the flavors but the only word to describe the taste was bland. Ikura and uni portions were tiny although the ikura was seasoned very well and \"popped\" in my mouth", "author": "Bobby D."}

We happened to dine here during their soft opening so at the time they were still working on smoothing out the final menu. Service was a little slower than expected given the amount of patrons in the restaurant but the food was very comparable to Domo. We tried a variety of items: ebi, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, marinated tuna. All the sashimi was fresh and delicious. Would def recommend Kuma!", "author": "Kim C."}

The sushi chef, Ryo, was a good conversationalist and made me feel very comfortable and welcome despite the fact that they were quite busy.  I ordered the eight piece sushi tasting.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-18", "description": "I'm very picky about sushi being a Southern California native and frequent traveler to japan.    And when I saw this place from the outside, I was hesitant to go in.  The building is old and ugly and the street not that smart.    But once through the front door it was far better.    Excellent service In a small sushi joint.    Highlights where the miso soup, generally something not a highlight food but this is the best miso soups I've ever had and the big rye tuna was very moist and dark red the way it should be.    I found the \"great balls of fire\" to be avoidable , but the service and overall quality of sushi excellent.", "author": "Phil B."}

The space is welcoming, kind of industrial but warm, with a great neighborhood feel, and a diverse, lively clientele, The service was perfect, friendly and attentive but never hovering or rushed. The food was amazing!  All this delivered with a smile, for a fair price.  About the food - that was the best part!  An artful treat composed to satisfy all the senses - nuanced, subtle. Try to eat slowly so you can appreciate it!   Everything I've tried was delicious great, but I especially loved the Anago - local saltwater eel, specially prepared, never had it before [and I'm a huge Unagi fan - come meet its saltwater cousin!]; other winners for me: Osuimono, a clear soup based on stock from the days fresh fish bones with shitake, tofu and kelp - really great!  I have to recommend the Kuma Roll too, it was delicious.and like everything else beautifully prepared and kindly presented.  My friends loved the Sake, but it's not my thing - I ordered a rose, to my delight it paired beautifully with my meal as well. The whole experience was so well thought out, doubtless because the chefs are the owners, have decades of experience making sushi, and it shows! I've seen Polk Street evolve over the last 30 years, Kuma is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I would give the place ten stars if I could!", "author": "David D."}
