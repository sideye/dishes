Got there in time before all the reservations and walk-ins came in so we had first-come-first-served seating at the bar (for 2). \n\nFor first-timers, we got the Outlaw and it was perfect for two people. Everything tasted perfect and was paired nicely with the bottomless sides. They took a while to prep and serve (but that was probably cause every party placed their order at the same time) but the service and everything else afterwards was great. \n\nWe weren't stuffed (which was great) cause then we had energy to go to other places after!

It's a cute little a restaurant great for date nights and family dinners.\n\nI've tried a few of the cheese fondues and a couple of the sweet ones. In particular, the Traditional (Swiss Gruyere, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Roasted Garlic, Fresh Ground Nutmeg), the Outlaw (Aged Cheddar, Beer, Slow Roasted Tomatoes, Roasted Garlic, Roasted Jalapeno, Cilantro), and the Quick Draw (Manchego, White Wine, Roasted Red Pepper, Roasted Garlic). These were all great and came with plenty of dip-ins (bread, potatoes, olives, broccoli, apples, and grapes). You can also order meat dip-ins separately which are quite tasty. Each of the fondues, with the non-meat dip-ins included, run about $28 for 2 people. You can also request more of certain dip-ins if you have leftover cheese fondue. \n\nWhile I enjoy the cheese fondue somewhat, the chocolate fondue takes this restaurant to another level. I've had both the Happy Trails (Dark Chocolate with Cayenne) and Buck-A-Roo (Milk Chocolate with Walnuts) and they are both fantastic. These cost $25 for 2 people and come with lots of fruit (pineapple, kiwi, strawberries, banana) and other dip-ins (lady fingers, marshmallows, chocolate bread). These fondues definitely make the trip worth it. \n\nWhenever I've been the employees have always been extremely courteous, fun, and thoughtful. It is an awesome experience every time. \n\nI would recommend making a reservation, especially if you have more than a couple of people in your party (or if you don't want to sit at the bar).", "author": "Kristin A."}

Located on the less popular side of SOMA, I would imagine people who live and work around here would visit often.\n\nIt's a cute little place on the corner and has cowboy decor all throughout the restaurant. My favorite details were the bandanas they use as napkins. As I waited for my friends, the waiter came over and got me a glass of (Australian) wine, which was cheaper because it was happy hour. They don't have a full liquor license, but offer wine and beer and wine cocktails.\n\nWe ordered two pots of fondue and a side of meat and meatballs. We also ordered more drinks after the waiter prompted us that happy hour would be ending soon and we should take advantage.\n\nThe pots of fondue were good, but I didn't think there was anything special about them. One was cheddar and one was goat cheese, but the dipping options weren't amazing. The meatballs were good but the standard items you get included a handful of vegetables, apples, pickles, and lots of bread.\n\nThe dessert fondue on the other hand was great! We had the dark chocolate option and the cakes were given to eat with it were wonderful.\n\nI'm not sure if I would come back here because I don't like fondue enough generally, but worth a visit if you like fondue.", "author": "Jade R."}

It was risky, but we decided to give it a shot anyway since we were in the neighbourhood. There was a wait as expected, but since there were only two of us the wait wasn't too long and we were able to sit at the bar. There were so many fondue choices that it was difficult to decide! In the end, we ordered the Rawhide (Italian Dolce Gorgonzola, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic). We were tempted to order a meat platter as well (since the provided sides didn't include meat), but instead opted for dessert. Best. Choice. Ever. We ordered the High Noon (White Chocolate with Balsamic Strawberry Puree) based on a recommendation from the server. Usually I wouldn't choose white chocolate, but the taste of it changed somehow based on the way it was melting in the pot. Plus, the dessert sides were superb. I definitely want to come back soon and try something new :)", "author": "Bianca C."}

Suuuper expensive though.\n\nWe came here tonight (Friday) and for whatever reason they weren't very busy--which surprised me because it seems like the perfect place to have some drinks and snacks with a coworker, friends, or a date.\n\nThey have a few different cheeses to pick from. We chose the Lonestar, which has gouda, emmenthaler, thyme, garlic, onion, and white wine. For sides, we got the chicken skewers and spicy hot links, both of which were delicious! I also loved the little potatoes that they give you with the sides (you get potatoes, bread, grapes, apple, olives, and mini pickles). For dessert, I definitely recommend the High Noon with the strawberry pur\u00e9e!! It went perfectly with their chocolate bread.\n\nI also thought Fondue Cowboy had good cocktails. My first was the strawberry mojito which was pretty much as you'd expect. The cowboy punch was my favorite: a light, refreshing but delightfully cinnamon-y sangria. \n\nSo, yeah, I'll definitely make my way back here when I need my liquid cheese + chocolate fix, but maybe on special occasions only because it's definitely on the expensive side ($28 per fondue, not including sides).", "author": "Claire C."}

However, despite this, I'm not a fan of the cowboy who serves Fondue.\n\nThe menu is small: 6 types of cheese-based fondues, 3 sides, 3 salads, and 3 sweet fondues.  Happy hour has $4 drafts, here's hawwww!\n\nI ordered:\n========\n1.  The Traditional Fondue [$28, 3.5 stars] -- good, but not great.  Served with a great amount of bread, crostini, roasted potatoes, black olives, pickles, raw broccoli, apples, and grapes.  I liked the wide selection and varieties of stuff, but in the end, it was novelty and not delicious.\n\n2.  Side of Homemade Meatballs & Spicy Louisiana Hot Links sausage [$12, 2.0 stars] -- homemade my butt, it had the taste of frozen balls from Costco all over it.  The waiter was nice enough to split the order so I could try both.  Normally, they are $12 each.\n\nConclusion:\n==========\nIt's a cute place, and seats about 30.  Cool bar -- that's about where it ends for me.  Fondue, traditionally, is a great and fun thing to share on a date, or better, for a group.

Nice corner location and - at least when we went there - easy parking.\n\nTried a bunch of the fondues including:\n\nTraditional - really good perfect for dipping\nOutlaw / cheddar - seems like more of a cheese sauce and probably wouldn't order again\n- Desperado / goat cheese - super good and light\nStagecoach - A lot of wine flavor but also very good\n\nAlso had the charcuterie plate and the meatballs which were essential. Meatballs were amazing for dipping and we wound up ordering a second order. All this for eight people and we were pretty well satisfied.\n\nThe pots initially look really small, but there's quite a lot of cheese in there and definitely seems like two people could be fed with one pot, especially if you ask for some extra bread.

When we got the food, I found that I was not the biggest fan of the flavor. It was my first time eating fondue, so maybe I simply was not used to it! There was a very strong flavor of beer in the fondue (it says beer in the ingredient list, but it was much more than I expected), which made the fondue bitter at times. If you're not a beer lover and this is your first time trying fondue, hopefully this can be a helpful warning for what to expect if you order the Outlaw! \n\nOn the plus side, the chocolate fondue was absolutely amazing! Please order this if you love chocolate like me!! \n\nOverall - great ambience, new adventures, feeling like a kid when you eat, and lovely servers!

We were extremely pleased and glad to try this restaurant out!\n\nWe did not know exactly what to try because it all looked and sounded so delicious! We ultimately chose the Outlaw as our waiter explained it is a fan favorite! Note: this fondue is a bit spicy. It came with delicious potatoes, broccoli, vegetables and breads. There was not anything wrong with the food selections that it came with. If you are a bit more hungry, they also offer meat portions for an extra cost. Since we were getting a dessert fondue after, we decided not to get the meat portion with our fondue. We definitely will try the meat though next time we come! \n\nThe dessert though was amazing! The food items it came with (fruit, Madeline's, chocolate bread, and marshmallows) were perfect and made it a delicious dessert.\n\nOur waiter, forgot to ask his name, was EXTREMELY hospitable, kind, and caring throughout our stay.

Using Yelp, I came across Fondue Cowboy. \n\nAfter visiting their website, I knew this was the perfect place. I mean, who doesn't like fondue and western movies, right? I made a reservation for 8 p.m. on the evening of the 26th of December. I figured that would be a great way to kick off our San Francisco adventure. When we arrived, the place was busy. It is a small place with a bar and maybe 5 tables. Paul greeted us when we arrived. Just an FYI, kids can sit at the bar since they serve food there. \n\nThe fondue menu has several options. Since our daughter was with us, we chose the more milder of the fondues. The Outlaw. Each fondue comes with bread, roasted potatoes, black olives, and pickles. For dessert, we had the Happy Trails dark chocolate fondue. It comes with marshmallows, strawberries, banana, and kiwi. All together, an incredible mix. \n\nThe bar serves beer and wine. The wine list is simple, but good. A little on the pricey side, but after all, it's San Francisco. \n\nFinding Cowboy Fondue was easy. It's a small place, but the sign is unique so you can't miss it. It is right on the corner of Folsom and Russ. We were staying on Nob Hill so we took Lyft since it was on the other side of town for us. \n\nCheck out Fondue Cowboy if you are in town.

It was pretty cute though, so I didn't mind one bit! They were definitely committed to the theme.\n\nAs this was our first time a bit, we were a little bit confused as how to navigate the menu.

It's a pretty sharp cheese, but to be fair, I don't like cheese that much. It paired really well with the bread pieces, as well as the hot links. Surprisingly, the grapes/apples also tasted kind of great with the cheese? I was a little taken aback, but it was definitely a pleasant surprise.\n\n-Side of Hot Links (5/5): These were so juicy with a rich, tangy aftertaste, and paired perfectly with the fondue that we ordered.

Each one is about $28, so splitting between two people makes the price reasonable. If you want a classic fondue, go for the original, but if you want to try something a bit more flavorful, I would try Rawhide. What genius decided to put bacon in fondue? The fondue comes with a plate with amazing potatoes, as well as bread, grapes, raw veggies, cornichons, and olives. If you're not a fan of olives like me, I normally ask for extra bread or cornichons. The meat plates are extra and I only order them if I'm extra hungry because the fondue will fill you up! \n\n[Drinks]\nGreat happy hour prices!

No way this place could be that good, right? Well it is. There is awesomeness all around.\n\nWe ordered \"The Quick Draw\" fondue (Gouda and white wine). The waitress brought us this tiny pot and my first thought was that it might not be enough for 2 people. Boy, was I wrong. This little pot seemed bigger than I anticipated so our bellies were full before we knew it. Also because they provide you with endless potatoes and bread (genius!) besides the broccoli, grapes, olives, cornichons and green apple you get as a side. \n\nThe waitress was very friendly and fast.

This place will always be a special place for me being it was a first date spot for us.  I've been here half a dozen times and have had every cheese and chocolate and side on the menu.  My favorite is the cheddar fondue with the Gouda as a close second.   I love the \"stock\" sides they provide with the cheese and think it's plenty.  But the meats are a great and are a great addition and go with every cheese. I've had one of the salads.  I remember pears and a vinaigrette dressing I think.  I've had each of the chocolates and they are all delicious.  Recently we had walnuts with dark chocolate, I think I prefer it without the walnuts.  The Malbec they have is delicious.  Not too dry and very aromatic.  Besides the deliciousness of melted cheese I really appreciate the service.  Our waiter has been so friendly and pleasant every single time we have been there.  We look forward to seeing him and hope he is there when we go.  I appreciate how he jokes around with us and goes with the flow.

They did a marvelous job setting expectations around the entire experience - from suggesting serving amount appropriate for four people to letting us know how long both our main courses and our dessert would take. They even periodically updated us so we were never in the dark wondering where our cheese was!\n\nThat said, everything came out promptly, hot, and delicious!\n\nThey even went so far as to accommodate a distaste for olives (by supplementing with the other dipping options) and checked back to see if we needed more of anything in particular (we requested more green apples, and they showed up in a jiffy).   \n\nFood - We had:\n\nThe Traditional - Swiss Gruyere, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Roasted Garlic, Fresh Ground Nutmeg\nThe Rawhide - Italian Dolce Gorgonzola, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic\n\nA cured meats plate\nA meatball plate\n\nAnd for dessert, Happy Trails - Dark Chocolate with Cayenne\n\nEverything was incredible! The Traditional was mild and creamy, with a little earthiness from the nutmeg. The Rawhide was the right balance of pungent and smooth. The options for dipping items was a great spread: pickles, green apples, black olives, conchirion pickles, raw broccoli, baguette, and roasted potatoes. Divine! Meats were additional, but honestly, I'd have been satisfied without them - though they were very tasty.\n\nThe wine selection was very good and the offer of 1/2 bottles was very convenient for trying to wines between four people.\n\nDesert was also yummy but to be frank, I would rather have kept dipping fruit in cheese! That's how good the cheese was - it was LITERALLY better than chocolate.\n\nDecor/Atmosphere - Small, intimate, fun, funky. The Western theme is carried from the Clint Eastwood stencil on the wall to the paisley colored bandana napkins.\n\nOverall - this place is great for a date night, a celebration, or a small group (I'd say 4-6 people max).\n\nI can't wait to go back and I hope that you try it, too!", "author": "Jesseca E."}

Fondue Cowboy!\n\nOur experience began with making the reservation....at the last minute, of course. Called on Saturday at 5:30pm to see if they could take 3....teen girl was on Yelp saying there was an 8pm available and hubby was saying there was an 8:15. I just wanted to call. The woman on the phone couldn't have been nicer and was looking at their system and seeing there was some kind of hold or inquiry of these times and then I yelled out the two knuckleheads to close Yelp and then asked her to refresh her system and she did.... she gave us the 8:00 but also let me know there was a good chance we could come earlier and would text us if something became available. I hung up and 10 minutes later got a text that we could come at 7:30. Yay!\n\nWe arrived 30 minutes early, because traffic was non-existent on this holiday weekend, and yet our table was ready and waiting for us! We had a lovely table at the end. I enjoyed the bench seating on the wall with all the pillows, since I had been gardening all day and my back hurt.\n\nWe ordered sangria, beer, wine and ginger ale. The sangria was delicious - just the right amount of fruit pieces so you could eat a few, but not feel like they were trying to give you more fruit than alcohol. \n\nWe ordered two fondues - Traditional (Gruyere, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Roasted Garlic, Fresh Ground Nutmeg) and Desperado (Goat Cheese, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Roasted Garlic, Olives). The Desperado was our clear favorite....nice flavors and the addition of the tiny chunks of olives was good. The Traditional could have used a bit more flavor....perhaps amp up the garlic? Or add champagne. Champagne makes everything better. I like the accoutrements that come with the fondues....it's everything we use at home. Bread, apples, cornichons, potatoes (these were by far the best dipping item), broccoli (although I do like it slightly steamed, rather than raw, as these were), and grapes.\n\nWe were pretty hungry and the two fondues were just right for the three of us. If it were just two of us and we had ordered one fondue, I think I wouldn't have been satisfied. Obviously this is a personal quantity preference - you decide for yourself.\n\nGreat atmosphere, super friendly service, and good food....I'd definitely come back!", "author": "Laurie H."}

We ordered the Lonestar cheese fondue (love the Western-themed names), the pear and gorgonzola mixed greens salad, spicy sausage, and the white chocolate foundue. I also got a strawberry mojito (which wasn't that impressive, imho, hence the loss of the star).  Everything else was delicious, and I was pleased with the taste, restaurant ambiance, and remarkable service.  I especially appreciated how the server brought us more apples and grapes, because my kid wasn't a fan of the olives, raw broccoli, or cornichons.

It is a nice place to take a young person, and fun to eat, but it was also upscale enough with the right lighting that would make it great for a date or celebration.

We arrived about 45 minutes early and our table was ready. The waitress immediately greeted us and we ordered drinks while we waited for the rest of our party. Once our party arrives our lovely waitress took our drink orders and gave us menus. Since each fondue feeds two people we paired off so that we can share with one other person. I shared the Longstar with my friend and my sister shared the QuickDraw with her daughter. We ordered a side of sausage and meatballs to go along with the dippers that come with the fondue. Everything was delicious. I did want more seasoning with the cheese fondue but it was still tasty. I can honestly say the best part was the dessert fondue. If you are tasing this get the dark chocolate with cayenne pepper, omg! With every dipper in that chocolate there was a party in my mouth. The atmosphere was super chill, there is plenty of parking if you come after 6. If you come before 6, parking is only one hour. The only reason I am giving four stars is because we came during happy hour and only the drinks were half off. Most establishments that I have been with happy hour include some of the food items as half off. Other than that, I plan to go again.

There is a big dead space between the row of tables/booths and the bar.  There is a Western playing on the TV.  Nothing else struck me to be so \"Western\" other than the clever names of the fondue.  We ordered the white bean salad (delish!) and the outlaw fondue with the prosciutto and salami on the side.  You definitely need to order a meat or you will not be full.  The fondue comes with an assortment of fruits, veggies and some bread.  A lot of things I probably would never dip into cheese, but hey, I'm new at this.  The cheese wasn't what I expected it to be.

The Matterhorn here in San Fran.....but not much else.\n\nFondue cowboy serves very good, albeit tiny portions, of unique and tasty fondue.\n\n We had the Outlaw fondue with: Aged Cheddar, Beer, Slow Roasted Tomatoes, Roasted Garlic, Roasted Jalapeno, and Cilantro. What an amazing combo of rich and tangy flavors. This fondue went well with all of the more mild fruits, vegetables, bread and potatoes. I would highly recommend this if you like spicy.\n\nThe other fondue was the Stage Coach:  Jarlsberg Cheese, White Wine, Sauteed Mushrooms, and Roasted Garlic. The stage coach was more buttery, creamy, and smooth. This fondue went well with the more spicy dipping items...the meats. Although it went well with all the veggies, fruits, and bread as well. This was def more of a traditional Swiss fondue.\n\nThe final order was for the cured meat plate. The plate was a nice selection of prosciutto type meats sliced thin ready for dipping in the warm gooey cheeses.\n\nService was really good. Our waiter was wonderful.\n\nSo why only three and a half stars. \n\nIt is pricey for what you get. With a tip the bill was roughly a Benjamin.

I had a group of 7, and it all ran smooth as melted fondue chocolate. I am often tasked with group dinners in SF, and this was one of the best in terms of quality, speed and fun factor. Sometimes group dinners can drag on for hours and hours...we had a 7pm reservation and my jet-lagged Euro group was on their way no later than 9:30pm (with some dilly dallying at the end!), a record. \n\nService was perfect. Friendly, fast and always with an eye on the wine! My kind of guys. We were ordering from the wines on tap and particularly enjoyed the Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Petit Syrah. Nice to be able to try different varieties out of the tap before indulging in a full bottle. \n\nThe fondue! Perfect for a non-picky group (of which thankfully I was dining with). Your group likes cheese and chocolate? Things are going to be just fine! We tried 4 of the fondues (I liked them all, they were all cheese, I can't really go into the details, see above wine paragraph), which came with platters of dippers: roasted potatoes, bread chunks, veggies, etc. Everyone had a good time, interactive enough but not so interactive that its annoying or feels like \"work.\" Word to the wise, I'm not sure this would be a great spot for vegans. We didn't have any. However, gluten-free folks will find fondue is a good option -- just avoid that bread and have them bring you a platter of veg! \n\nDessert was such a treat! Of course. We ordered two chocolates, served with marshmallows, madeleines, brownie chunks, strawberries, etc. I mean -- again, what's not to love? Its not innovative pastry art, it's CHOCOLATE BOWLS. Perfection. \n\nThis place has a great vibe, I really enjoyed the entire meal. Very laid back, super comfortable table with soft chairs and excellent for a group of 7.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-31", "description": "I have a complicated relationship with food.  Those who know me know I have a LOT of food allergies, and this often impedes my ability to fully enjoy and appreciate certain cuisine.  This restaurant is a hard place for someone like me to eat:  between the raw fruits and veggies and the fact that there's garlic in EVERY fondue (unless you order it without, which they can do!), it's one culinary hazard after another!\n\nI'll be honest with you:  Fondue isn't my thing, at least not as a main course.  I would've never sought out this restaurant on my own, but came here as part of a large group for a close friend's birthday.  So please take what I have to say about the cheese fondue with a grain of salt.\n\nI found the cheese fondue here to be incredibly bland, probably because it was garlic-free.  My partner and I split two different fondues:\n\nFirst we tried The Traditional ($18, Swiss Gruyere, Ementhaller, White Wine, Roasted Garlic (which was left out for us), Fresh Ground Nutmeg).  Gruyere is my favorite cheese and I LOVE nutmeg in my creamy/cheesy sauces, so this seemed like it should be a no-brainer for me...but I found it intensely bland.  And of the items that were available to dip in it, the only two items that I a) wasn 't allergic to, or b) didn't hate (gerkins, olives) wound up being raw broccoli and bland pieces of bread (my partner tried the roasted potatoes that came with it as well, but I couldn't eat these because they, too, were cooked in garlic oil).\n\nThe second cheese fondue we tried was The Rawhide ($18;  Italian Dolce Gorgonzola, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic (which was left out for us)).  While both of us agreed that this was the better of the two fondues we ordered, it still didn't have tons of flavor and seemed to be overwhelmed by the Emmenthaler...in fact, it didn't taste too terribly different from the first fondue we tried.  It was vastly improved, though, by adding copious amounts of salt...!\n\nDessert was a huge hit for me:  We ordered the Happy Trails ($16; Dark Chocolate with Cayenne).  At my request, they left out the cayenne, since I am not a fan of pepper, and only brought us grapes and bananas for the fruit (I'm allergic to their other fruit offerings).  My favorite things to dip into the delicious chocolate turned out to be the chocolate bread (!!!!) and madeleines...very tasty!!!\n\nSo if I was generally underwhelmed by 2/3 of my dinner, why am I giving this place 4 stars?  The service was AWESOME.  They were attentive, responsive, polite, and friendly.  They catered to my special requests without batting an eyelash.  The food arrived in a timely fashion, the mixed drinks we ordered were delicious and well-balanced, and the ambiance was warm, inviting, and cozy.  It was a relatively quiet restaurant, which was really nice for conversation with my friends, and the seats were super-comfortable, especially for a big-butted woman like me.  \n\nIt's not Fondue Cowboy's fault that I'm not really into fondue...and if someone invited me to go here with them for dinner sometime, I wouldn't hesitate to say yes.  After all, a restaurant is more than just the food:  it's about the experience, which I'd say is a good one here.", "author": "Amy L."}

But I love Fondue so I definitely wanted to check out Fondue Cowboy. Love the simple concept of this restaurant, a hip little place in Soma which manages to bring a modern angle to this traditional cuisine.\n\nOld John Wayne cowboy movies on a big screen TV behind the bar is about the only thing cowboy about this place, The cheese fondue selection is surprisingly diverse distinctive Western names of savory fondue like Outlaw, Stage Coach, Rawhide & Desperado.\n\nA variety of dipping items for the fondue are a diverse and crunchy selection of  baguette squares, roasted fingerling potato, broccoli florets, black grapes, black olives,  green apples and pickles. I don't eat pickles but I love eating these pickles and dipping it into the different fondue.\n\nLove how the fondue is served in these cute colorful cast-iron chafing pots over a hot blue flame that keeps the wonderful melted cheese bubbling and warm.  These are my favorites:\n\nThe Traditional~ $24 a sharp, rich nutty pool of Swiss-only cheeses (Gruy\u00e8re and Emmental), white wine and nutmeg\n\nOutlaw ~ $24 robust mix of cheddar, beer, roasted tomatoes, garlic, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro\n\nRawhide ~ $24 Italian Dolce Gorgonzola and Emmenthaler gives it a nice kick, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic\n\nAnd if you think you have already been treated to a decadent meal it hasn't ended yet.  You have a choice of sweet sinful treats ~ $20 like  Happy Trails which is Dark Chocolate with Cayenne, the Buck-A-Roo ~Milk Chocolate and High Noon ~White Chocolate.  All are tempting but I have never had space for dessert.  So I must come in one day just for the sweet fondue.  They also have salads but I can eat a salad anywhere so I want to reserve all the space to stuff myself with  rich warm gooey melted cheese!\n\nGreat place for conversation and connection. The fondue is generous ~ good for two, imaginative and delicious, with something for everyone. Been here many times and have brought friends here to enjoy Fondue Cowboy just as much as I do!

Beware, it's a very small restaurant so I would recommend reservations even on weekdays just to be safe! They only have beer and wine, but they play that to their advantage by making wine cocktails. I had their wine mojito and it was surprisingly very good!\n\nTo eat, we ordered the stage coach to share between the two of us. The pot of cheese fondue comes with some veggie dippers, bread, and potatoes. You can add on an extra meat plate for a more filling meal if you want. Fondue is always a fun meal and I did enjoy the cheese as well as the dippers that came with it. Towards the end, the cheese started to get a little strong for my liking but overall, if you like mushrooms, I would recommend the stage coach!\n\nUnfortunately we did not have enough space for the dessert fondue but we will be back for that! All of them sounded absolutely delicious (my only problem with them was they were slightly expensive especially if you're not too hungry at the end of your meal). I wish they had half chocolate fondues if you're just looking to get a taste instead of a large, hearty dessert! \n\nFor portion sizes, I would say that 1 cheese fondue is enough for two people if you're not too hungry.

If you like fondue you will love Fondue Cowboy.  The only downside to it might be the cost.  It's $28 for fondue for two, which is actually pretty reasonable when you see all the things you get.  Prices go up when you add meat and drinks.  So for vegetarians like myself, it's a nice and fun dinner.  I love the Outlaw fondue.  Very flavorful with a nice kick to it.  But if I wanted meat I'd have to pay an extra $13 which feels like a lot.  Thankfully I don't want meat!\n\nBut they've got speedy, kind service with great food.  It's easy to make a reservation, even at the last minute.  It's a great dinner for before or after a movie (as it's not far from theaters) or you could grab a drink at another bar if you prefer.  They have some good drinks at Fondue Cowboy, though, from the look of it.  I haven't had any alcohol there but the pomegranate margarita looks awesome.\n\nAnyway, I'm mostly trying to fill out this review so it's got some meat in it but I don't have much to say.

A little bit more of variation in what was offered as dippers for the different fondues. Serving up the same things with the different fondues makes it a bit dull. However, everything was tasty, so one can not complain *too* much. \n\nExcept for the lack of cowboys. Tsk Tsk.", "author": "Danielle L."}

The staff was very friendly and prompt.  Their recommendations were spot on too - great drinks and delicious food.  Because this was a private party, I was able to sample a couple different fondues.  My favorite savory fondue was the Rawhide.  The gorgonzola paired excellently with the bacon and gave depth to the ingredients I dipped into it.  As for the dessert fondues, the High Noon, with its white chocolate and balsamic strawberry puree, was the clear winner in my book.  I was also able to sample some sides too, favoring the mini meatballs and the cured meat plate.\n\nI drank a mojito and followed that with glass of prosecco.  I regret not trying their sangria, though.  My friends who tried it really enjoyed it.  Next time!

It was the Mr.'s first time too, so it was fun that we fondid it together along with two of our good friends.  It wasn't awkward at all.\n\nBetween the four of us we ordered thusly:\n\nStage Coach - my favorite because I love Jarlsburg\nDesperado - didn't taste too much of the goat cheese\nCured meat plate - came with melons; reminded me of Europe :)\nSausage plate - Louisiana hot links, yum\n\nThe fondues were yummy.  It's hard to go wrong with bowls of melted cheese, but the masterful pairings of the cheeses with the other added ingredients was what took it to the next level.  I would've ate the fondue by the spoonful, except the table setting didn't included spoons--perhaps to protect impulsive individuals like myself from cheese overload.  Each order of fondue came with bread, potatoes, Gherkins, broccoli, grapes, and apples.\n\nWe ended our meal with the Buck-A-Roo--milk chocolate fondue with walnuts.  Into the delicious melted chocolate goodness, we dipped various fruits, chocolate bread, marshmallows and madeleines.  \n\nEverything tasted great and we left full to the gills.  They'll give you more dipping items and we asked for extras for both the cheese and chocolate fondues!    \n\nThe western theme decor and ambiance was really cool; the old black and white western movie playing on silent behind the bar was a nice touch too.  All in all, great fondue experience.  I would definitely come again, but probably to their happy hour as it can get pretty pricy.  It was $144 before tip for 4 people.", "author": "Thi D."}

I keep coming back to this place coz its sooooo good. Quite pricey though, each order costs about $25-$28 dollars.

Over the bar there is a flat screen TV, playing was very cold Cowboy movies, this was a great conversation starter for a group of strangers eating together!\n\nBeing the table snob that I am, I would like to dedicate this information to the wonderful layout of this place. It is small and only has 6 to 8 tables plus seats at the bar, but the tables are NOT squished together. I must commend the owners of this place for not trying to us every single inch of space they have for tables. \n\nOur food started to arrive and we were given to salads, one was the bean the other just a basic green salad, they even offered to toss the meat on the side since we had a veggie among us. The salads were good, the bean salad was my favorite because of the rich flavour of the beans and veggies, the other salad was lackluster and had little flavor. \n\nFirst round of Fondue hit the table, the Traditional and the Outlaw. There was a wonderful array of veggies, bread and fruit to dip into the wonderful gooy cheese. It was interesting see they were lit with a candle, at first I was unsure, but this candle kept the cheese nice and melty down to the very last drop. \n\nSecond ground of Fondue, dessert! White Chocolate w/ Strawberry vinaigrette and Dark Chocolate with Cayenne Pepper. Two very distinct flavours. They were both WONDERFUL, I loved dipping the chocolate bread in the White Chocolate fondue.. Y.U.M\n\nMinus one star because their Sangria is not that great. I wasn't sure what to expect seeing as it isn't a latin place, but even for an American joint it wasn't to die for.

You pick a fondue flavor that you like (from a selection of between 5-6) and it comes with bread, potato, grapes, broccoli, olives and pickles. Free refills on all of the above. You can choose to add meat plates which cost between $10-16 extra. The meat was way too salty in my opinion and even eating it with the bread didn't help. The fondue itself was good at first but got tiring really fast. Maybe it was because there wasn't a lot of taste to it or because there was some kind of weird after taste.

It was just starting to rain, she got there first as I was still coming over the Bay Bridge.  It was nice getting back into The City. \n\nFondue Cowboy strikes me as a fun eclectic establishment that got it's name because someone probably lost a bet.  It all adds to the fun and ambiance.\n\nInside, in fact, the unfinished wooden walls kinda gave me a feel of being inside a barn.  But in a warm, cozy way.... One side of the restaurant featured a lengthy bar with a couple of plasma screen TVs for patrons waiting, or just drinking & mixing, to sit and enjoy.  The other side of the establishment had seating.  While we were there, it got QUITE crowded and noisy.  We actually had to start shouting over the din to hear each other towards the end of our dinner.  But it seemed like more of a place to mix and talk and enjoy.\n\nTHE MENU\n\nI love CHEESE!  I love MELTED Cheese!  So it goes without saying that I love CHEESE FONDUE... mmmm....  The offerings covered a nice variety too:\n\nThe Traditional Fondue is a mix of swiss gruyere, emmenthaler, white wine, and spiced with roasted garlic, fresh ground nutmeg     \n \nThe Outlaw is a combination of aged cheddar, beer, slow roasted tomatoes, and spiced with roasted garlic, roasted jalapeno, cilantro  \n    \nThe Stage Coach mixes compte cheese, white wine, and is also spiced with roasted garlic      \n\nThe Quick Draw features manchego, white wine, roasted red puree, and is also spiced with roasted garlic   \n   \nAnd the Rawhide melts italian dolce gorgonzola, emmenthaler, white wine base together and is spiced with bacon and roasted garlic.\n\nThese fondues are each $18 and they come with substantial amount and mix of Roasted Potatoes, Sourbread sections, Fresh Broccoli, cut Apples and Olives.\n\nWe just ordered the first TWO (2) on the menu (The Traditional Fondue and the Outlaw Fondue) and we had at it.  I reserved my share of apples for the end and chose not to dip that in cheese, but every thing else was fair game and delicious.  \n\nI think for me the best sensual experience about the fondue is the delicious fragrance of the heated wine and melted cheese together.  It really fires up the taste buds if done right, and these 2 selections were absolutely magnificent in charging up my tongue.\n\nI had tongue-gasm one right after another with each delicious bite.\n\nThere were also a selection of meat fondues and dessert fondues, but we were just cheese-purists this night.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nIf you really want to satisfy your \"cheese craving\" in a pretty spectacular way, a trek to Fondue Cowboy will appeal to all of your senses as well as your appetite!", "author": "Michelangelo S."}

It's not in a great neighborhood, so I don't recommend walking there alone at night if possible.  Fortunately, it's just a few blocks from the good part of SoMa.\n\nI've enjoyed both the Traditional Swiss and Quick Draw (which has roasted peppers and garlic) cheese fondues, as well as the Buck-A-Roo (milk chocolate with walnuts) fondue for dessert.  I do wish they had a more 'simple' chocolate fondue, since I'm not particularly a fan of walnuts or cayenne (The Melting Point has a fantastic one with oreo pieces that I looove).  However, I guess they're sticking with the Western theme of the restaurant, and that's not a bad thing.\n\nThe vibe is funky and the service has been good every time I've been.

I kicked myself for not calling ahead.\n\nWe hung our heads and walked back out to our car, and hubby and I pulled out our phones to begin the yelp search all over again, from scratch. A few minutes went by, when that server came running out, all the way across the street to our car, motioning to us. When I rolled down the window he said, \"Actually, we just had a table open up, if you still want it. It'll be ready in about 10 minutes. I'm so sorry I made you walk all the way out here just to have you come back in!\"\n\nUmmm, you're sorry? You just saved our evening! You absolutely did not need to go out of your way to remedy OUR failure to make reservations. Wow... I see a very large tip in your future.\n\nWe sat on a bench outside the little restaurant to wait, and someone brought some menus out to us and patiently explained the menu and gave us tips on what the kids might like.\n\nLet's just say, the rest of the night only got better from there.\n\nWe had the Stagecoach with the sausage side plate, and the High Noon for dessert. Everything was incredible. Our boys (ages 4 and 7) picked at the fruit, bread and meat like little birds (which is how they always eat) and we were able to enjoy most of the (incredible) fondue by ourselves. The dipping pieces are refillable, so everyone was able to eat their fill at a reasonable cost. When the dessert came out, the boys turned up their noses at it just like they had at the cheese fondue, and it took a little convincing (why did I bother??) to get them to believe that it was CHOCOLATE and they would like it. Anyway, eventually they did try it and after that I think I maybe got one or two bites in. Haha.\n\nThe Yelp info above states this is NOT a good place for kids, but we really had a great time. Fondue is a wonderful experience for anyone, kids included. (Particularly if your kids are calm, well-behaved, and thrilled about eating grapes, bread cubes, and sausage slices for dinner.) ;)\n\nIt is a rather small restaurant (maybe 8-10 tables), so plan ahead and make reservations.

This was about 4 years ago and we have not visited a fondue place up until a week or so ago when we decided to try Fondue Cowboy. \n\nHere, the two of us were able to finish both the cheese and chocolate fondues and we each had a beer to wash it all down.

We got the Stage Coach (compte, white wine, sauteed mushrooms, roasted garlic) and the Outlaw (cheddar, beer, roasted tomatoes, garlic, jalapeno, cilantro).  Two fondues were a good portion for 3 people who started with salads.  The Outlaw was the lead contender.  But I think it was because the Stage Coach had a bit too much white wine and it took a few minutes for the white wine to burn off to meld into the rest of the flavors, but then it was just as good.  Fixins' were green apple, grapes, broccoli, gherkins and kalamata olives (and of course bread) which were fine (it's all just a means to get the cheese in your mouth, right?).\n\nThe decor was very modern so I don't know what makes this place very cowboy except the fondue names, a painted Clint Eastwood on one wall, and a sheriff star in their logo, but ultimately it sticks in your mind and piques the interest of diners so it works.  The lights are turned down low, you're staring into your companions' eyes flickering with the candlelight warming the fondue, and the steamin' cheese and chocolate make the windows fog up like memories of make out sessions in the back seat of your car.  So I guess it's romantic.\n\nReally, the whole point of eating for me is to get to dessert and the dark chocolate fondue with cayenne called Happy Trails was definitely worth it.  And the dippins of chocolate sourdough, boutique marshmallows and madeleines were perfect.  So yes, I'll be back--'Happy Trails to you, until we meet again...'  Oh yes, we will meet again...!\n\nCons: I can see why people ding the ratings for the value at $18/savory fondue and $16/sweet but that includes the goodies to dip.  Just wine and beer.

There were two little plates of food in which we were to poke our skewers. One had the chunks of bread , baguette slices and halved baby potatoes. The other had mini-broccoli florets, picked grapes, chunks of apples and cornichons (see photo).\n\nIt was all tasty enough to be a satisfying appetizer for two, which was exactly what we were looking for anyway. The Western theme with the giddy-up names of the fondue pots is amusing if a bit coy. They were even playing a high-def version of \"A Fistful of Dollars\" on the big screen behind the counter.

I started with The Quick Draw savory fondue (Manchego, White Wine, Roasted Red Pepper Puree, Roasted Garlic). On paper, it sounds delectable. In my mouth, it was horrible. The salt overdose singed my tongue. They weren't particularly selective with their dipping pairings either: it's a standard set of sides no matter what cheese you order. The fondue might have been better had they pureed sweeter red peppers and blended them in to offset the saltiness, but at this point the entire thing is a lost cause.\n\nThe sweet fondue, though, was a completely different story. I had the Happy Trails (Dark Chocolate with Cayenne). That was AMAZING. The dark chocolate was textured with cacao powder, was not too sweet and the cayenne gave it this impressive spicy kick that stayed with me andkept me coming back for more!\n\nAt the end of the day, you can have more well thought out savory fondue almost anywhere else, but if you don't have a choice and have to stop here, then the dark chocolate makes the stop worth it!", "author": "Vishal A."}

And now, onto the food.\n\nYes, the servings are a bit small, but the five of us shared three fondues (the original, the outlaw and the one with mushrooms ... can't remember the name), plus a couple plates of potatoes and bread, pickles, broccoli, olives, grapes and apples. Hands down, the crowd favorite was the one with mushrooms, but we enjoyed all of them. I had never before dipped a gherkin into a vat of cheese but I was an instant convert. \n\nIt came out to only $15 per person but we arrived around 5:45pm to make it for the happy hour prices.

The restaurant itself is pretty nice and the people working there were all accommodating and friendly as well. The price is not bad considering you can get 2 different fondues for $50 total and it will feed 4 people fairly well. I think the downside is that there is only so many pieces of potato, bread or veggie that you can dip into a cheese sauce before it gets a little boring and one-note. No matter what you dip in the main flavor is cheese, which I love, but it is a bit much. I just might not be a fan of fondue?!\n\nWe tried the classic (pretty good) and the manchego (much better). I would recommend getting a side of sausage or beef to add to the items they supply. Honestly, by far the best thing about the meal was the desert.

Plus all the little dippers that came along with it, including our cured meat platter with prosciutto and salamis, were really yummy. \n\nAnd next came the happy trails fondue, which had dark chocolate and a dash of cayenne that really brought out an awesome heat to the fondue. The little dipper fruits were so fresh and sweet, and you could feel the kick from the hint of cayenne at the back of your throat, which felt great and added a new dimension of flavor to the fondue.\n\nBoth fondues overall were really flavorful and had a great smooth and thick consistency to it.

The options are severely limited (just a few kinds of cheese, a couple salads, and three chocolate options).  The portions were small (something a lot of the yelp reviewers seem to agree with).  There's no \"entree\" option, where one can do steak/chicken/veggies in a broth/oil/wine, which is always one of my favorite parts.  \n\nTo start, we got the Traditional, which should have been amazing (we even asked for extra garlic!).  It was not amazing.  It was bland (possibly they believe it to be a \"subtle\" flavor profile?) and completely lacking in flavor.  We actually asked for more salt (which did help).  The dipping options were fine/standard fare, and were abundant.  Even with the small portion, we didn't finish because we were so disappointed.  We skipped the chocolate because we didn't want to be disappointed again.  While we had planned to gorge ourselves on cheeses and chocolate until bursting, we just finished off our wine and planned to finish up dinner at another restaurant instead.  \n\nOn the plus side, the service was great, our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and the Dry Creek Sauv Blanc was delish.\n\nIn the future, when I want cheesy goodness, I'll stick to those tried and true places instead.", "author": "Nicole J."}

Around 4 PM on Saturday, I was able to snag us a table for two at 7 PM the same evening, and we were seated almost immediately, as the previous party was leaving at that moment.\n\nWe decided to go with the Outlaw (Aged Cheddar, Beer, Slow Roasted Tomatoes, Roasted Garlic, Roasted Jalapeno, Cilantro) and the cured meat plate ($16), which had proscuitto, melons, coppa and sopressata.  Unfortunately they were really thinly-sliced, so I think that it would've been better for dipping had the meat been thicker slices.\n\nThe flavor of the cheese was excellent, but the consistency was really off, like it was too thick.  Everything we tried to dip in it came out naked, because the cheese would just slide off.  I also wasn't a fan of the large number of dippers - bread, potatoes, pickles, olives, broccoli, grapes, and apples.  I would've preferred to have more bread; the amount they gave us was barely enough for just myself.\n\nFor dessert, we went for the dark chocolate with cayenne.  I'm not a fan of cayenne-anything for dessert, but unfortunately they only had two types of sweet, besides the one we ordered: milk chocolate with walnuts, and white chocolate with strawberry-balsamic puree.  This was recommended, and while it wasn't bad because it wasn't overly sweet, the cayenne gave it sort of an uncomfortable kick in the back of my throat.  Dippers included strawberries, kiwis, bananas, pineapples, and a tray of marshmallows, brownies and madeleines.\n\nSadly, for the price, portion, and quality, I must say that I prefer The Melting Pot.

The waitstaff were pleasant and the food was really good. We ordered the Stagecoach and the Quickdraw for cheese with the meat plate. We also ordered the bean salad and the beet salad. Finally, we topped off our meal with the dark chocolate fondue. All said, the food was very good. The salads were good sized portions. The cheese fondue came with roasted potatoes, fresh bread, apple slices, broccoli, olive, pickles, and grapes. The chocolate came with strawberries, bananas, kiwi, pineapple, chocolate bread, pound cake, and home made marshmellows. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving a 3 star review is that I do think they need to add more options to the menu.  While I LOVE cheese,  a little more protein on the menu would have been appreciated. The food was good, but it wasn't as satisfying a meal as I would have liked.

Fondue is really a no brainier, and for the price, FC should really be delivering something a little more special than what they are putting out there.\n\nDrinks:\n\nI got a goose Island Matilda.

The mixed greens salad did have a lot of bacon in it, so good for you if you like a ton of bacon.\n\nFondue: The Rawhide (Italian Dolce Gorgonzola, Emmenthaler, White Wine, Bacon, Roasted Garlic)\n\nNot a ton of Gorgonzola flavor and to much wine.  Not bad, but not great.\n\nThe real let down was the bunch of really standard dipping items (i.e. raw broccoli that looked like it came off a party tray from safeway, half a green apple cut into inconsistent chunks, sourdough bread).  Or odd dipping items like the olives and pickles that really didn't work.\n\nThis is the one chance they have to be really creative and shine, and everything looks cheap and haphazardly thrown together, like they were to lazy to put any thought into what they were serving.  \n\nDessert: Dark Chocolate with cayenne\n\nI liked the flavor pairing of the dark chocolate and the cayenne pepper, but again the sides were a big let down.  COSTCO BROWNIES? (Yes the little brownie cups from COSTCO)  COSTCO MADELINES?

The portions are petite, about 4 ounces a pot with a large variety of included dippers.  Great place for fondue tapas snacks with draft wine.  The sweet fondue was just the right size, but the savory left me wanting for more.  Many of the dippers remained undipped due to inadequate cheese.\n\nThe Outlaw: Pretty soupy for fondue, was difficult getting the cheese to cling to any dipper except the bread.  Tasty but bordered too closely to a nacho dip with the tomatoes, garlic, cilantro and jalape\u00f1os.  Would have preferred that they steer towards a cheddar & ale Welsh rarebit since this incarnation of the cheddar was not that sophisticated.\n\nThe Stage Coach: AWESOME!  I could have easily ate a gallon of this.  Compte is such a brilliant cheese choice because of it's like the traditional fondue gruy\u00e8re, but with more personality.  I think there were some well paired mushrooms in it too.  Perfect consistency for any dipper.\n\nDippers for Savory Fondue: The whole grain bread and roasted small potatoes worked well.  The raw broccoli was a bit overpowering, even when smothered in cheese.  Apples and grapes were provided, not my thing but I suppose others like them.\n\nCured Meats Platter: Wish they skipped the melons and gave more meat.  Already enough fruit in the standard dipper selection.  The meats were prosciutto and thinly sliced salamis.  The cheese overpowered their subtlety, probably would have been better to have some cooked sausages like chorizo or kielbasa for a meatier side dish. \n\nHappy Trails: The cayenne had a bit of a kick in the first dip, but faded into the heavy dark chocolate pool afterwards.  Was very creamy for dark chocolate, but kept the bitter cocoa bite.  Seemed more like dark chocolate custard as opposed to melted dark chocolate, perhaps they need to ease up on the half-n-half.\n\nDippers for Sweet Fondue: The freshly sliced fruit was a win - strawberries, bananas and bing cherries.  The chocolate bread wasn't that chocolaty, which is actually good else it would have been overkill.  I wasn't keen on the regular bread since that's just weird in chocolate.  Wish they had some cookies, angel food cake pieces or brownies for dipping.", "author": "Adam B."}

The Cops were called! - read on.....\n\nDate and I decided have an early dinner at Fondue Cowboy, so we made a reservation 6:30, Friday. We were greeted by our waiter who offered us our table next to a few (semi loud) patrons. We asked if instead we could take a two-top in the middle of the very empty restaurant. After a sour look and much deliberation, Waiter said no to our request as that table would be joined to another to make a larger table. Oh well....\n\nToward the end of our meal, we noticed that the larger table never transpired, and that in fact the table we asked for was occupied by another couple. Both date and I were annoyed and wondered why we were denied the table, so I asked the waiter to explain. Stumbling through his explanation, (I guess frustrated that I challenged him) he asked if I would like to speak to the owner, to which i replied \"No. I want to speak with you, but if you want me to speak with the owner, that's fine\". \n\nOwner (Dave Mur?) came over to the table and without any lead-in, said aggressively, \"You have a problem with your table? Why don't you just get out of here\". Shocked at why we were being treated like this, I tried to explain again,  but the owner continued yelling, and causing a pretty big scene in the middle of a curious and shocked restaurant, ordering us out.\n\nAs we were leaving the restaurant, the owner's self-proclaimed boyfriend came over to us yelling about being on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. I told him I was waiting for my CC receipt. He called the police to have us removed. \n\nAnyway, cops came, laughed at being called, bid us a good night,  I got my receipt and we left. As we were walking away, the owner's boyfriend started screaming something at my date about having more expensive clothing than she .  The last thing we saw was the two cops that he called, converging on the ranting lad. I wonder if  he got himself arrested as his pupils were so dilated they looked like little Christmas sugar plums.  \n\nNever in my (plenty of) years have i been treated like that from the proprietor of a business. I had worked in the restaurant business for a long time &  I've frequented hundreds of food establishments of all types. I am accommodating sometimes to a fault  to the food and beverage community because I know it's a tough racket being a waiter or bartender. This was an absolute first for me. Distasteful, undeserved & completely degrading experience.\n\nClick on the rating details for this joint and look at the downward trend of the reviews...maybe paints a different picture than their 4 stars imply? \n\nShame, cos the food wasn't bad.

(Probably more me and him).  SCOREZELTON! \n\nWe walk in around 7:55, and got seated promptly at 8pm. Our server came over, and then took our order of drinks. Here is where one star gets knocked off. \n\nI don't really like sweet drinks. Actually, I don't like them at all! So I asked our server ( a really sweet girl) to make my lychee martini (made with soju) with less syrup. LESS THAN 5 MINUTES later, she comes with our drinks, but the first thing she says is, \n\"Oops I forgot you asked for it less sweet. try it anyway and let me know what you think.\" \n\n*pucker face* (me) \"uhhhhh it's okay?\" \nLook, I am not one to confront people. In fact, I don't really care if there is the occasional odd object  in my food. However, if you acknowledged that you messed up, why not just go back and make another one and not put me in an uncomfortable situation? I told her it was \"ok,\" then she smiled and just walked away. .....er.....\n\nOK. Whatever. I'll just wait for the ice to dilute the drink. \n\nOur beet salad was good, pretty much the highlight of the night. We ordered the spicy cheese fondue with jalapenos, along with a side of sausage. When the fondue came, I had to take another star off. There was no taste whatsoever. We even ordered extra jalapenos, but....ughhh. I did not want to ask for salt cause that would be tacky, but I might as well have been eating some spicy creamy whatever sauce. That made me really sad how completely bland it was.  I am so glad we ordered the sausage (although reminiscent of Costco hot links), because that was the saving grace of the night. \n\nSo overall....it was okay. More like 2 stars, but I can't bring myself to do it.  The server girl was still really nice, but I was just really disappointed in how she handle the martini situation. The bf and I both left pretty unsatisfied, and went to drown his irritation at paying $100 for dinner at Bloodhound. \n\nNext time I should definitely speak up..but I don't think there will be one.", "author": "Christina L."}

Reservations definitely recommended (it's small!).  The menu is straight forward - options of salads, cheese fondue, meat or sausage platter, and chocolate fondue.  \n\nWe started by sharing a MIXED GREEN SALAD ($8), then opted for the STAGE COACH fondue ($24).  I have to say, I was surprised by how little food came to the table.  It was a --tiny-- cheese fondue as compared to most places, and just enough for 2 people (that's including the greens and meat).  The cheese fondue had good flavor with mushrooms adding a nice richness to the cheese.  The dippers were eh, and included a lot of filling carbs - bread, both regular and toasted, potatoes, apples, broccoli, pickles, and olives.  We also ordered a CURED MEAT PLATTER ($16), which was a spicy tasty selection of 3 thinly sliced meats with honeydew and cantaloupe.  Thank goodness we had the salad and the meat to go with all that cheese dipped bread.  \n\nWe opted to not get a chocolate fondue for dessert, as it would be an additional $16 to an already expensive meal, given what it was.

Our server was nice about fulfilling my special requests and didn't drop in on us too much to the point of getting annoying. \n\nFor my cheese fondue, I went with The Outlaw, which is cheddar cheese. It was delicious and accompanied the food well. They give a reasonable amount of dipping items and it's enough to be shared between 2 people. The amount of dippers they give you is more than you'd get at The Melting Pot. The amount of cheese you get is approximately 1 cupful and it's kept warm by a tealight candle. If you have a huge appetite, I recommend adding the sausage dish. The sausage was very good with the cheese and it has a light spicy kick to it without burning off your taste buds. \n\nFor dessert, I made a special request. I ordered dark chocolate with walnuts, which is basically a combination of the Happy Trails and Buck-a-Roo. Feel free to customize your chocolate fondue because they're very accommodating. I also tried the High Noon, which is white chocolate with balsamic strawberry puree. The High Noon is good if you like your desserts very sweet. The strawberry really complements it well but I didn't taste much balsamic in it. And those tealight candles really work very well for keeping the chocolate warm.

The flavor of the cheeses were good - nice combination of flavors and good presentation.  If I was rating the restaurant based only on the cheese, I would give it 5 stars.  \n\nWhere I was less impressed was in the dipping options.  The standard dipping items provided are pretty basic, mainly chopped up fruit, veggies and bread.  Yes, these are the great with cheese but it looked like something I could have easily prepared at home and in a place that specializes in fondu, I was expecting a little more \"wow\" factor.    \n\nI would come here again but not with a big group.

I've had some bad experiences with fondue restaurants that privilege quantity over quality by e.g.  extending the fondue with filler ingredients like water and flour, or by providing cheap bread. This place doesn't do that: the food is very high quality. \n\nPros: Great fondue. High-quality sides like good bread, tiny roasted potatoes, flavourful olives, apples and grapes. Good salads. A decent choice of wines by the glass, well-priced. The service is warm and professional.\n\nCons: The fondue for two is really only enough for one. The space is a tiny bit loud. It's small so you need to reserve, and it won't suit large groups.", "author": "Susan P."}

I gave them a call beforehand to try to reserve a place. It's full, and has been unavailable for the last two weeks I tried to book a place on opentable. Nevertheless, being stubborn, I decided to try to walk in. It turned out that the bar is first-come-first-served, and we could still order from the full menu at the bar. We ordered the traditional fondue and the salami platter. Both were excellent. The traditional fondue consists only of vegetables and bread, so if you are a meat-lover, be sure to order a side dish. I highly recommend the citrus cooler. It's made of lycee syrup, lemon, sea salt, and white wine. It's especially amazing if you prefer a weaker kind of alcohol and just want something nice to complement the fondue. \n\nWe ended our dinner with the dark chocolate fondue, which is mouth-watering even as I recall it now.

I mean, it's in the name. What do cowboys have to do with fondue? I have never EVER seen a photo of cowboys eating fondue, neither did \"Brokeback Mountain\" feature any scenes or talk about fondue.\n\nOf course, I make a joke about how they must be under construction. Their floor is a bunch of construction plywood glossed over. Yet, except for the TV playing cowboy films and the name, there is no association with cowboys. Perhaps because it doesn't exist.\n\nI hope Chef Ramsey comes and sets this place straight with the mix-up in one of the Kitchen Nightmares episodes...and not just the name/interior design. The food lacks as well. One of those places you don't go to unless everything else is closed or you have a deal.\n\nThe salad we got was 80% fresh leaves, 20% mushy old leaves. The pear was probably taken out of the compost pile. You could taste it. The cheese was the only good thing, but of course, we only got 2 pieces of it.  Frankly, it was disgusting. Top it off with home-made \"croutons\" you can't bite or you'll chip a tooth!\n\nThe fondue was better. But better doesn't mean great, or memorable, or even really good. It was just alright. So-so.\n\nI guess the sangria was the best thing and the Stella I had. \n\nOur waiter took forever to come, but that's cause she was the only one serving everyone. She was mumbling 100%, but the place is spot clean, hear that germ freaks?\n\nApparently a place to go hang out with your girlfriends.

With a capital Yee! :)\n\nOn a brisk night in June, I visited Fondue Cowboy with a group of 10 or so women. One of the gals made reservations online and we took up about half of the restaurant with a long table and stools they had set up for us. The decor was warm, dark, and inviting and the space was quiet enough that we weren't screaming to hear each other.\n\nWe ordered four types of cheeses, several platters of dippers (mostly bread and potatoes), two sweet chocolate fondues (milk with walnuts and dark with cayenne), and wine for the table. We also had some plates of pickles and olives to compliment. My favorite savory fondue was the Outlaw which is cheddar, beer, roasted tomatoes, roasted garlic, and jalapeno. For sweet fondues, the dark chocolate with cayenne had a bit too much cayenne for my taste, and I preferred the milk.\n\nAlthough we occupied half the restaurant for several hours the staff never once rushed us (10 chatty women + wine = an all-night gossip-fest).\n\nThe damage? Less than $25/pp after tax and tip. That's WITH alcohol, my friends.\n\nThere are probably higher-end, better quality fondue restaurants out there, but Fondue Cowboy is super affordable, fun, and terrific for groups. After all, who doesn't like dipping bite-sized morsels into melted cheese and chocolate?", "author": "Kel S."}

Scrambling, I used my handy-dandy Open Table app on my iPhone to search for restaurants in the area that had reservations. Fondue Cowboy showed up and I made the decision to take the plunge.\n\nWhen we arrived (at 7pm) it was pretty quiet. It's a rather small space with dark interior, a faux straw floor and sleek tables. All that with cowboy movies playing in the background. The menu is fairly simple, a choice of 4-5 cheese fondues, a similar number of chocolate fondues, some salads and meat plates. \n\nSince their were four of us, we opted for 2 salads and two cheese fondues to share. We got the white bean salad and mixed greens, and the white bean was definitely our favorite. Flavorful with a bit of tan from the picked red onions. The cheese fondues we opted for were the Desperado which had goat cheese and The Outloaw, a cheddar and jalapeno cheese mix. The Desperado was definitely the favorite. More flavorful and went really well with the side dish of cornichons, olives, broccoli and grapes. The Outlaw was good but we expected more of a kick from the jalapenos. It went really well with the bread and potatoes, tho.\n\nFor dessert we got the Happy Trails (dark chocolate and cayenne) and Buck-A-Roo (milk chocolate and walnuts) to share. These came with chocolate bread, marshmallows, madeleine cookies, as well as strawberries, bananas, and grapes. They were both delicious, especially the Happy Trails - but super rich. In hindsight, we probably should've only ordered one, but you live and you learn.\n\nI'm so glad I finally came to this place. I've been to La Fondue in Los Gatos, which is great, but super fancy and pricey. I felt that Fondue Cowboy provides great fondue at a reasonable price, and a more casual (but still great) atmosphere.

The portions are not even large enough for an appetizer let alone an entree.  The \"fondue\" is served in what is the equivelant of a tuna can with a meager & paltry assortment of stale bread cubes, three apple slices and the strangest of all...two gherkin pickles.  The fondue has absolutely no flavour (how is this possible?) and there is nothing else on the menu at all interesting.  We went because I had a Living Social Coupon but we will never go back or ever recommend this place.  \n\nAfter our \"entree\" we left (we were not interested trying anything else as it could only be terrible from what we already had and could see from the other tables) and had to go down the street to another restaurant to get not only enough but actual flavorful food to satisfy us for our dinner at Ooma (a much better place!).  \n\nThere is no excuse in San Francisco for such poor execution, quality, pricing and service!

Arriving before 5:30, the place was dead.  I'm pretty sure we were the only diners there.  However - its also \"Happy Hour\" which means fondues and draft beers are HALF OFF at the bar between 5pm and 6pm!  Score!  Our whole bill (Fondue, the meat side, and four beers!) was like $37 (before tip).  We totally weren't expecting that at all and its super cool that they even offer it.  \n\nIn addition, the fondue is awesome.  I agree with the person who said it couldn't be considered \"traditional\" - but that's the point.  They're cowboys!  Rebels!  Their combinations of cheeses, wines and spices was super interesting.  We settled on the Gorgonzola and decided to split the meat side.  The dipping sides that came with the fondue were great too and with the addition of the meat tray it was the perfect sized meal to share.  The service was great too, and within 30 minutes people started to filter in (missing the Happy Hour specials!  Big dummies!)\n\nThe decor is nice also.

My husband and I had the Outlaw, complemented by tiny pickles, olives, potatoes, raw brocolli, grapes and bread. Melted cheese is something that tastes good the first couple of bites, but after a while it gets really heavy and filling. We wanted to save room for dessert! \n\nFor dessert, we had the white chocolate with strawberry puree and it was DIVINE. The chocolate bread dipper paired with the white chocolate was a match made in heaven. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Some other dippers included fruit and fresh marshmallows, although I felt the marshmallows were too sweet for my tastes.

My grandma and I were sorely disappointed to see that they only had cheese or chocolate for fondue.  \n\nWe ordered the Mixed Greens, Roasted Pear and Gorgonzola Salad and found it bland - the bacon at the bottom of the bowl tasted like rubber, there was not a lot of dressing, and the salad didn't taste fully washed (you know that gritty taste).  \n\nWe ordered the fondue with French compte (I think), garlic, and mushrooms (I can't remember the name and it's not listed on their on-line menu).  When the cheese fondue arrived I was surprised - the heat source was not a traditional fondue pot, but a tea light which is generally not strong enough to keep cheese heated enough to keep from coagulating, as was the case last night.  The pot was SO small for the cheese, we could have each had one and been fine.  Also, the portions of dipping items compared to cheese was so skewed - usually you have more cheese than dipping items.  The dipping items were fine (cheese, potatoes, pickles, olives, grapes, broccoli, apple) but cut into too small of pieces to really hold cheese.    \n\nWhen all the cheese had been scraped from the bottom of the small pot and the extra items munched on we were still hungry so we ordered the white chocolate fondue.  Again, a small pot (which for dessert was fine), and a lot of side items.  My grandma enjoyed the chocolate bread, madelines, and strawberries, while I enjoyed the strawberries, kiwi, bananas, and marshmallows.  Again, the fruit was cut too small to hold the chocolate easily.\n\nI wanted to like it here: the atmosphere was great (my 94 year old Grandma kept saying how it would be such a fun spot for a party), the wine we ordered (cab and syrah) was yummy, however the cheese wasn't heated correctly and was WAY too small for a dinner, and the side items should be cut into a little larger chunks.

The dipping items were ample and we had plenty left over.  We did order the sausage plate which was a tasty addition.\n\nI enjoyed my meal and the prices were very reasonable.

Then, I searched again a few months ago, and lo and behold, found Fondue Cowboy had opened last summer. So I grabbed my husband and some friends and made a reservation for a Friday night.\n\nThe service was oh-so-friendly, the food was awesome, and they had amazing sangria for $8 per overflowing glass. We had two types of cheese and two types of chocolate for dessert, as well as the meat/salami platter to dip in the cheese (it only comes with breads and veggies, no meat), and the bill came out to about $30 a person for four people. Definitely less than we usually pay for a huge dinner out in San Francisco!\n\nThe space is intimate so I recommend making a reservation on weekend nights (which you can do on Open Table). And street parking in that area (a little ways out in SoMa on Folsom) is super easy. I'm already looking forward to going back!", "author": "Kristin L."}

(I was a bit too young perhaps to appreciate wine, I guess! I used to love \"raclette\"! :-) ) All I can say is that Fondue Cowboy has brought back a lot of memories. The great thing about fondue is in the sharing of a pot, in the communal experience, in the \"dip,\" the \"dippers,\" the dippings, and the deep-ends! (if you have too much, I guess! haha!) :-) Fondue Cowboy excels on all these. Again, I was a guest. My friends ordered for two. Three ate. One more cool thing! :-)", "author": "Nando G."}

We are in this specific block radius of SOMA more than anywhere else in the city for the past 3.5 years and have not only never seen this place nor heard it's cute name! And I have searched restaurants in this 4 block radius so many times on Yelp that it is just shocking this place has been here for 4 years. \nIt is in a highly unassuming local and kinda covered by a big tree so you would have no clue it was here driving past it. \nThe ambiance was a little rustic, yet eclectic. I expected more of a modern saloon, but it wasn't really like that. The only western aspect seemed to be the vintage western films projected on the wall at the bar. \nThe cocktail menu was awesome! Super creative and yummy drinks. I got the strawberry mojito and it was fabulous! The only way someone could not love it is if they are a freak who hates strawberries! They also had a wine and I think beer menu. \nThe fondue options are super limited, but shockingly, super creative and awesome! We got the Traditional and then the Happy Trails for the chocolate one. Both were insanely good and the perfect amounts. We were so stuffed leaving. Our waitress was so sweet and friendly. She was really genuine and kind. We left and forgot this piece of paper on the table and she actually ran out after us to our car. So CUTE! Definitely would return many times over.", "author": "Unicorn U."}

But still, I was a bit disappointed.\nSecond, the price... a bit expensive for what you get.\n\nThat being said I really did enjoy the place!\nUnlike with the fondue, the amount of dipping stuff was very good, as was the amount of meat you get on the cured meat platter.\nI did enjoy the variety of accompaniments they give you with the fondue (apples, pickles, broccolis, grapes).\nWe had the traditional fondue, which was very good and pretty close to the Swiss stuff; it could use a bit more salt and white wine though.\nService was great too; our server gave us very good recommendations. \n\nThe wine list is a bit small, but includes some very good wines.\nAnd the decor is really, really cool.

It's small, so I HIGHLY recommend making reservations, even if you're a small party.\n\nI came here for my birthday with some friends and we had a chocolate-y cheezy good time! I'd say that one of the pots of their fondue is good to share with 3-4 people. Our party got the Happy Trails (dark chocolate with cayenne) and Buck-a-Roo (milk chocolate with walnuts) for sweet fondues. For the savory fondues, got the Traditional (Swiss, White Wine, garlic, nutmeg) and the Outlaw (Aged Cheddar, beer, tomatoes, garlic, jalapeno)! I absolutely LOVED the sweet fondues! There was a nice warming in the back of my throat after Happy Trails :)\nThe restaurant provides all the accompaniments to the fondues, which was awesome! The sweet fondues came with fruits, madeline cookies, mini marshmallows, and some sort of chocolate chip bread(?)\nThe savory fondues came with bread, potatoes, green apples, grapes, broccoli, olives, and mini pickles! Be warned: the olives were quite salty and the pickles were preeeeetty sour! Just drench them in cheese though and it won't be as bad.\n\nAt first glance, items on the menu might seem expensive, but everything is actually very reasonably priced! Fondue is to be shared, so when everything is split at the end, it's not bad at all! My party got 4 different fondues, plus the cured meat plate and in the end, people paid ~$11 each!\n\nThe service was excellent and everyone who was working was really nice! They constantly kept our water glasses filled and they made sure we were happy with everything. Over by the bar, there's a screen that shows old black and white Westerns too! :)\n\nI want to try all the other savory and sweet fondues, so I'll be back for sure!\n\nAlso, parking can be kind of difficult in the area.", "author": "Kei H."}

Five Stars!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe menu is small, but the food is great!  And the outstanding service was a major plus.  The decor was fun yet elegant--I love the black and white cowboy films playing on the flat screen at the bar.  The low lighting and background western-themed music makes this place date-appropriate, or great for catching up with a friend.  You'll need to make reservations if you don't want to snag seats at the bar.  There are only 6-7 tables. \n\nAny fondue you order comes with unlimited dipping items, so don't think you can't get full off of fondue--you definitely can!\n\nFor wine, we ordered the syrah which was on tap.  My overall opinion of it was meh, but it lacked a bitter after taste which was awesome.  The beet salad was delicious: arugula, walnuts, beets, and goat cheese, yum.  I will definitely re-create it at home.  For our entree, we ordered \"The Outlaw\" which came highly recommended--and it did not disappoint.  I liked it best with broccoli for dipping, but we had an ample selection of veggies and carby-things to choose from.   \n\nFor dessert, you must try the \"Happy Trails.\"  Dark chocolate and cayenne pepper fondue may sound kind of funky, but it is heaven on earth!  The quality of the chocolate here is very good--and I normally wouldn't say such a thing, because I'mma chocolate snob.  The name of the brand escapes me, but the chocolate comes from the same supplier as see's candies, and it is a local chocolate company that moved to the bay from France in the late 1800s.  Almost as exciting as the fondue was the dippers it came with: fresh fruit, mandelines, and home made marsh mallows--oh my!    \n\nThe location for cowboy fondue felt kind of random--but it was only about a 10 minute walk from The Orpheum.

Unlike some of the other reviewers, we had plenty of cheese to accommodate our dippers ... in fact, we asked for extra dippers (no extra charge) because we still had some cheese left.  I think if you actually dip your veggies or bread rather than using them as spoons, you'll be plenty satisfied with the portions.\n\nFor dessert, we chose the dark chocolate and white chocolate fondues.  They brought us strawberries, grapes as well as these delicious cookie-type things from the bakery around the corner.  YUM!  My suggestion to you if you think your white chocolate is a tad too thin is to let it simmer a little more ... it caramelizes nicely, and the flavor is a tad nutty.\n\nAbout the beverages, we were curious about the wines they have on tap and were allowed to do some sampling before settling on a nice red wine blend.  Surprisingly, the tap wine was delicious and complemented our fondue well.  Another bonus is that the price was really reasonable by the carafe.\n\nIf you come here intending to enjoy your experience and have an open mind, you will love it.

So when we got there we tried ordering two sets of fondue for four people, but this was nowhere near enough for dinner. If you want to make a meal of this then you would really need one order per person, plus maybe a plate of the cured meats for every two people. They are clearly marketing themselves as a restaurant, although in reality it's more of a bar that's set up to serve  small portions of fondue with your drinks. Which would have been fine, but it's just not what we were expecting.\n\nAfter dinner we ordered two sets of chocolate fondue for the table, and that seemed like enough chocolate to satisfy the four of us. The dark was good, although the white chocolate was my favorite. Strange since I'd never actually order a white chocolate bar, but with the fruit and bread that they gave us it worked quite well.\n\nAll in all the food was very tasty. However, to get enough food to make a dinner of it then realistically it would be about $30 per person. So in the end it's only ten bucks cheaper than melting pot, for significantly less food. I wouldn't normally complain about portions and pricing at a restaurant, but even the 5'0 100lb girl I was with said she was going to go home and make gnocchi after.

So Fondue Cowboy started off in a position of authority, but didn't follow through.  \n\nFC could be an A-OK experience with time, but right now I wouldn't recommend it to others.  If you want to eat in that area, better to go to Bossa Nova right now.  \n\nThe decor is okay; my only major beef with it is the shade of beige used on the bar wall.  They could have gone with something bolder. But no stars off for that.    \n\nThe menu feels incomplete.  It's too expensive to satisfy your need to snack, and yet you'll have a hard time making dinner out of it considering the price and the calories involved.  Adding some steaks and chicken to the menu would go a long way to making the restaurant more suitable for dinner.  \n\nAnd it would also go a long way in cowboying the place up!  Really, fondue cowboy?! Besides the old shoot 'em up films playing silently and (as Ed U says) the giddy-up names of the fondue pots not much smacks of the old west.  \n\nOnto the actual food.  We had the Outlaw and another savory fondue not on their online menu that had mushrooms in it.  Both were good, but I would have liked the cheddar-based Outlaw to have been sharper and spicier.  We had a discussion about whether sharp cheese melts well though...so maybe it doesn't make good fondue. I don't know.  In general the cheese was not my issue.  I love cheese.   \n\nThe starch fixings are okay, but there's a problem with the others.  Kalamata olives?! Not cowboy and not good (and these weren't good ones).  The broccoli?! I would have appreciated if it had been at least blanched.  \n\nThe salumi plate was a rip-off.  At $16 I was opposed to ordering it but my companion insisted.  The prosciutto, coppa and sopressata were not that very good and sliced way to think. It also came with a lot of out of season melon, which did nothing for me.  Why even do Italian cold cuts somewhere \"cowboy\"?! \n\nI did have a green salad with Gorgonzola and pears that was very good.  I asked for pepper and it came in a little silver bowl.  The salad was good, but there has to be a better way to give someone pepper...\n\n...there is actually. It's called a pepper mill.  And Fondue Cowboy should definitely get one.  \n\nTo review: they need to spice the place (and their fondue) up a bit.  They need to add some entrees (you expect any place with cowboy in the name to serve a flank steak).  And they need to polish up their offerings by getting some basic amenities like pepper mills and ditch the crappy Kalamata olives, mountains of pickles and giant hunks of raw broccoli.", "author": "Luke M."}

If you're looking for a hefty, meat-centric meal, this isn't the place to go.  It's definitely more of a bar with food than a restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the meat plate to start off with, then 2 savory fondues: the Outlaw (aged cheddar, slow roasted tomatoes, garlic, jalapeno) and the Rawhide (gorgonzola, emmenthale, white wine and bacon) and the Outlaw was by far the better of the two. (keep in mind this was for four people).\n\nFor Dessert, we had the dark chocolate with cayenne, and it was really delicious. The cayenne adds the perfect bit of spice to the meal.\n\nI left this place feeling pretty hungry.  On the one hand, you can continue to order more fondue to make yourself full, but I reached my fondue limit pretty quickly and wanted something more substantial in my tummy.\n\nGreat food, great service, just not very filling as  a \"dinner place\".", "author": "Jenny S."}

The interior was designed very well.  \n\nMy friends and I were here on a Tuesday evening and at 8:15pm, they tell us they are out of chocolate!!! WHAT?!!?  (& please keep in mind that we ordered our chocolate fondue with our cheese fondue at the beginning & the waiter says he'll order it later so that it can come after the cheese-but we had to ask and order again after all and now there was none left!) For goodness sakes, that's half your menu!!!!  People come here for fondue and you run out of chocoalte?!  That is like going to the bathroom and running out of toilet paper!  What's your other option? Water and your hands!  Imagine that. That's pretty much how I felt during my experience that I was SO looking forward to.   The group to the right of us were SUPER disappointed that after they were savoring their cheese fondues, they couldn't even have the option to try the chocolate fondue.  \n\nThe group to the left of us was told they were being given the last of the chocolate they had for the evening and they ended up complaining that it was \"weird\" \"clumpy\" and \"not creamy.\"  The waiter just told them \"sorry it must have been because it was the last of it and maybe they didn't have enough half and half either.\"  WHY would you tell your customers that AFTER you've served it to them?  Did you think you could get away with it?  Obviously not...\n\nFirst off, the portion size was pretty small.  We ordered the Outlaw, which was the better of the two we ordered.  We also ordered the Stagecoach, but it was so bitter it was almost inedible.  We just pushed it aside.  There was nothing spectacular here.\n\nThe service was poor as well.  The food took a long time to come out.  There was one guy running around doing everything looking disheveled.  We had to ask multiple times just to get water refilled.  Also, when he first served the accompaniments, he only served one saying that for lack of space on the table, he would bring the other later.  By the time he brought the other, there was no cheese left & the other one was inedible.  Our server didn't seem to know how to manage his tasks.  He was nowhere to be found everytime we needed something.  It didn't look like any co-workers were helping either.  There was a few minutes when there were no servers on the floor. \n\nIt's too bad because there aren't many fondue places to go to in the City and they really could have capitalized on a unique business idea.  If they stock their ingredients correctly and train their servers properly,  this place has the potential to thrive.  Unfortunately during my visit, both service and product were lacking.

Overall I think it's a great addition to the neighborhood and I would (and will) definitely go back.  \n\nOn a side note it did not appear too crowded or difficult to get a table when we were there and by the time we left (about 9:30) it was pretty empty.  My guess is if you walk in on a Thu-Sat night at 8pm with a big group you might have to wait a while but if you and a friend pop in on a weeknight you should be fine.", "author": "Julie P."}

Not a lot of seating overall but good for small groups or a date. The service was great and our food came on time even though this was just their second week open. We met the general manager who gave us a free carafe of wine for my friend's belated birthday. Great customer service. \n\nThe $15 prices means pretty small portions. Which would be fine but there wasn't enough cheese for the bread and dippers. All of the fondue pots have herbs and seasonings in the cheese but instead of lots of flavor, it was a bit like cheese out of a jar. I'd say they'd do better serving a gourmet cheese plain. They had run out of the cured meats by the time we sat down. I was disappointed to see that there were no other meat options on there. A stronger cheese with some steak medallions or sausages would have hit it out of the ballpark.", "author": "Kimmie N."}

Certainly not traditional at all, except for the fact that one of their choices is the traditional cheese mixture.

Each fondue serves two and is very reasonably priced and comes with a TON of bread and potatoes, and a few other sides.  My request here would be to do away with the olives and pickles (the cheese is already salty, and some of the fondue already features olives, so this was salt overkill for me), and up the ante on the veggies - more broccoli and maybe some I dunno, carrots, cauliflower or mushrooms?\nThe dessert fondues are fab as well - I'm not a milk chocolate fan so I skipped that other than a couple of tastes, but I devoured the dark chocolate and loved the kick from the cayenne.  The chocolate-chocolate chip bread stuff made for an insanely intense chocolate bomb.  I could only eat a couple bites of that combo without a big glass of cold milk.  My recommendation here would be to add some of that salt in - pretzels would be amazing.  \nBoth savory and sweet fondues came with plenty to dip - and really, it was perfectly portioned so that you didn't run out of cheese or chocolate before you ran out of dippers or vice versa - both of which kind of suck.\nService was good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-22", "description": "This is a great place to pick up an appetizer before dinner or dessert after dinner, but I wouldn't really recommend them for a \"fondue\" experience. I fully admit that my review is colored by a comparison to La Fondue in Saratoga (see end of this review). Not having been to La Fondue, I might have given this place 4 stars. One star down for narrow offerings and the other star down for value for price. \n\nAtmosphere - Thematically \"western\" but with a sophisticated and elegant twist. A nice atmosphere for a date with dim lighting. The place is very small (reservations recommended) and probably cannot dine more than 20 people at tables at any given time. \n\nService - Excellent. Our waitress was attentive and professional. We saw another group of 6 come in while we were there who had accidentally booked their reservation for the next evening. They made every effort to accomodate them at the bar when all the tables were taken. \n\nFood - Tasty, but little that is special. Here's the hard, cold truth. Fondue is essentially easy. You melt cheese/chocolate in a pot and cut up some veggies/fruit to dip in it. If you're going to pay someone to make fondue for you, there should be something special. The cheese fondues had a decent selection allowing options for traditional \"authentic\" Swiss fondue and then other flavor combinations that were well thought out and differed enough from each other to make each a unique offering. The chocolate fondues, I found lacking. There were three options - dark with cayenne, milk with walnuts, white with strawberry. First, white chocolate isn't even chocolate, but it might float some people's boats so sure - keep it on the menu. For folks actually looking for chocolate you are left with two options. There are so many amazing things you can do with chocolate fondue so I find the narrow selection worthy taking off a star. The dipping options? The chocolate bread from the local bakery was different and special, but the other selections were not. 4 tiny marshmallows, a selection of fruit, and cut up Madeline cookies (which instantly crumbled and got lost in the fondue is just nothing special to me. \n\nOther things to note - They do not have a full bar and their wine/beer selection is limited, but tasty. They have very limited drink options for someone who does not drink alcohol or caffeine. It might be difficult to get a filling meal if you are kosher, vegetarian, or gluten-free. It's 3.5 blocks from the Civic Center BART station, but I don't recommend walking that distance alone at night as the streets are mostly vacant and rather dark. \n\nFor the best fondue experience available, check out my review of La Fondue in Saratoga. I would only recommend this place if there were transportation limitations that made driving down to Saratoga impossible or if you were just looking for an appetizer/dessert to begin/end a date in the city. \n\nAt La Fondue you can order piece-meal if you just want cheese or just want chocolate, but they also have a $90 feast for two where you each get a (1) choice of 3 delicious salads, (2) a choice of several cheese fondues paired with bread and veggies, (3) an entree course where you can have a grill, broth, or oil paired with a 4 oz portion of 6 meats including seafood, high-end cuts like filet minon, and exotic meets like kangaroo, and (4) a choice of several cheese fondues including a Frangelico fondue, a Godiva liquor fondue, and a rocky road one all of which are paired with the usual fruits, but also marshmallows, cookie dough, cream puffs, rice krispie balls, and snickers. \n\nFondue Cowboy has only a piece-meal menu. For two people to get salads, a cheese fondue, a supplemental plate of 3 cured meats, and a chocolate fondue costs $72. The fondue pot portions are smaller and selection of chocolate fondues is rather pitiful.", "author": "Kat S."}

Golden beets which were cooked perfectly.\n-fennel & apple salad - let down. 3 slices of extremely thin apple, some bits of fennel & arugula. pass on it & order another beet salad!\n\nSweet: whoever reviewed the white chocolate w/ balsamic raspberry swirl & the milk chocolate w/ walnuts were deliciousness in a bowl...was absolutely right. \n-white chocolate w/ balsamic raspberry swirl - i don't even like white chocolate (too over processed; mainly sugar w/ no real cacao bean left) but i was floored by how good this was! my friend & i were digging it out w/ our coffee spoons! it did get a bit thick by the end...kind of coagulated on the sides of the bowl\n-milk chocolate w/ walnuts - nuts sunk to the bottom which made it even better to dunk the fruit/bread in & dig 'em out! completely not expecting how good that milk chocolate was going to be, even after reading the reviews...good job fondue cowboy!\n-waiter's favorite sweet: milk chocolate w/ nuts\n-will have to try the dark chocolate (my favorite) w/ cayenne (not my favorite!) next time.\n\ni think the 4 barrel french press could have used another minute or 2 in its steeping, but i'll let that fly.\n\noverall: service was very good & attentive. bartender knew his stuff. love the wine on tap aspect although i didn't partake. sweet fondues were the best - would take them over the cheese fondues any day. the place is tiny, tiny, tiny. only open about a month now but seems to be doing well. good to have some variety close the mission.", "author": "Marissa H."}

The fire started less than 24 hours after my sister and I finished our dinner at Fondue Cowboy.  Even I would say that's just a little suspicious.\n\nWe made a reservation for 7 pm and showed up a few minutes early.  We had a choice of 2 tables, and we opted for the one closest to the kitchen.  There was nothing unusual about the table, except for a settee-like bench on the right, separating our table from a wooden barrel with an old saddle on top.  Yep, business as usual.  The LCD TV hanging behind the bar showed old westerns, and the walls were covered with wood.  It's as if an old saloon woke up and one day and decided to be \"metro.\"  I liked it.\n\nMy last fondue experience was at The Melting Pot (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-melting-pot-san-mateo#hrid:WOkgHqb1R8Bfq-8KBo4xiA).  I enjoyed it immensely, despite the fact it was an overpriced, mass produced fondue.  Come on, people: it's dipping stuff in cheese, hot oil and chocolate.  Who doesn't love it?  I was hoping for a more sophisticated experience at Fondue Cowboy, and I am happy to say: mission accomplished.\n\nWe ordered 2 salads to start: the white bean salad and the roasted beet salad.  The salads were light and refreshing, with just the right amount of dressing.  It's amazing how much you get for $8, and I would have been totally happy splitting the salad.  It's big enough for two.  We then ordered The Outlaw, which, according to Yelp, was the way to go.  The Outlaw features melted aged cheddar with a splash of beer, a hint of roasted garlic and tomatoes, as well as a dash of cilantro.  It had a very unique flavor, which made dipping stuff in cheese far more sophisticated.  We had plenty of stuff to dip: (bread, mushrooms, olives, pickles, broccoli, grapes, apples, fingerling potatoes).  I also opted for the $8 sausage plate.  It was a thinly sliced andouille sausage, and it was delicious. $8 was a bit aggressive for one sausage though.   Aside from olives, everything else tasted surprisingly great.  Our waiter (the owner?) informed us that he could bring us more veggies, but what we needed was more cheese.  Perhaps we didn't do a good job of dipping, but we had veggies left after the cheese was long.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a High Noon fondue, which was a white chocolate fondue with balsamic strawberry puree.  It tasted like strawberry compote to me, but I am sure the chef knows best.  For our dipping pleasure, we had a variety of fruit (strawberries, kiwi, bananas and mandarin slices), as well as a less healthy plate of cut p chocolate loaf, Madeleines, and homemade marshmallows.  Aside from being almost too sweet, it was a perfect way to end an evening of dipping.\n\nServe fondue in slightly bigger ramekins (is that what those things are called?), and you've got yourself a repeat customer.  Mmmm, I wish I had some melted cheese right now.", "author": "Yan G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-21", "description": "I wish I could give this restaurant a review on its food.  Unfortunately, the owner cancelled my reservation for 30 people the day we were supposed to eat there, via voicemail.  So I'm just going to use this opportunity to point out a few flaws in the customer service I received leading up to the evening we were supposed to eat there.\n\nNow, I'll fully take ownership of the fact that I didn't confirm the day or two before, but I honestly didn't think I needed to.  I'd offered to give David (owner) a credit card to hold the reservation when I made it a month in advance, which he told me was unneccessary.  I also called him 6 days before the reservation to see if we could squeeze a few extra people in, and told him I would absolutely cap it at that number and call if anyone bailed.  He did leave a message a few days later to confirm numbers, but unfortunately I didn't get it.  So he called again at 10 am the day of saying that he hadn't heard from me, so he was giving away my tables.\n\nWhen I called a few hours before the reservation, the owner was actually antagonistic.  \"You should have confirmed with me; this isn't my fault.\"  When I said, \"I'm sorry, I'm just trying to understand what's happening.  There's no reason to be combative.\"  He responded \"I'm not being combative; I'm being perfectly reasonable.\"  It went on in that vein, but I was too stunned to remember the details.  Except I do remember the conversation ended with him saying, \"I'm sorry; I don't have time to deal with you.  It's busy here.\" Click.\n\nNow, on principle, I'm never going to eat here.  I am a lady, and I don't intend to subject myself to similar treatment if I can avoid it.  Similarly, on principle, my dinner club (the 30 people who were going to eat there, as well as the 50 other members of the club who weren't able to attend) will never eat there.  \n\nAll of this would have been perfectly forgivable (I'm a Christian woman, after all), had the owner not flown off the handle when I called to clarify what was happening (I mean, really, who says \"It's not my fault\" if they don't actually think that a situation is, kind of, their fault?).  I work in an industry that deals heavily in customer service; and when something goes wrong with one of my clients, I apologize, even if I truly believe the issue is completely their fault... even if I believe them to be total morons...  I also try to find a way to help them.  This guy could have said \"I'm so sorry, but I couldn't risk an empty night at the restaurant.  Since I didn't hear from you, I got nervous and gave away your tables.  Let me recommend a few other places in the area you might try.  If you find one to accommodate you, let me know which one it is, so I can direct your guests there if they end up here.\"\n\nSo I suppose my only feedback would be to call and confirm your reservations to this place two days before, or else they won't necessarily mean anything.  Or just don't take large groups there.  Take them to 21st Amendment, which scrambled to find a way to take us when we explained our situation, sat us all near each other, and didn't allow any employee or owner to raise his/her voice to me.", "author": "Emy D."}

The front of the house manager was great! He made good suggestions and provided unobtrusive but attentive service. The Dark Chocolate Cayenne desert was good and there was plenty of chocolate to go with the dipping options.

I got the beet salad to start. For dessert we shared the milk chocolate with walnuts.\n\nI really liked the beet salad, but it could have had a little more goat cheese.  I also found it a bit hard to eat because the long ends of the lettuces kept sticking out, like un-bendy pasta.  I'd have appreciated a butter knife to chop the greens a little smaller.\n\nThe cheese fondue was ok-to-good, but the bacon and garlic were kind of non-players.  I couldn't taste them.  I just tasted cheese with wine in it.  The portions are indeed small, but mostly tasty.  I don't get the cornichons or kalamatas, personally.  Pickles and winey cheese...uh no thanks.  The steak was yummy, even without covering it in cheese.  \n\nOverall, the entree is decent, and totally worth the happy hour price of $12.  \n\nFor me though, the dessert was the star.  I'm probably going to go back for dessert, with a special friend, and let the creamy sexy chocolate start some magic. :-)\n\nMy only issue with the dessert was that the spot right over the candle flame got kind of burned, and in other parts of the pot the chocolate cooled a bit and got clumpy.  A more even heater would be appreciated.\n\nI think its a nicely put-together establishment, but I don't \"get\" the melty European cheese meets John Wayne thing.  Whaaaat?

We started with a side spinach salad that had a bit too much dressing. For the savory fondue, the alcohol dominated the fondue and it was hard to enjoy the cheese and spices.

I went with a friend who has been here before and she recommended we order salads first...which I highly agree with. Two pots of cheese fondue (or a cheese and a chocolate dessert fondue) would have been waaaayyyy too much. So we ordered the manchengo cheese fondue and it was enjoyable but nothing to write home about. The salad was good...probably my fav part of the meal. Our service was fine.

We ordered the traditional, and then the white chocolate for desert. I also had a side plate of the meat. Let's just start by saying, they give you so much food, and for the price is a value. The decor is so nice, intimate, and romantic. I do want to say that conversations may not be as private because of the small space, but unless you're purposely eavesdropping, shouldn't be a problem. They provide bread, fruits, vegetables with the cheese fondue. With the desert one, they give you fruits. My girlfriend said the chocolate was better than orgasms (Not a reflection on me people!!!! YET.) Had some rose, which was good, though we are wine snobs. Only complaints are few and minor, such as the old western cowboy film that they play, I know it's called fondue cowboy, but play some HGTV or a yule log burning to help set the mood. 2nd complaint is that it is small, so make sure you have reservations or you wont be seated at all.

We found a spot in the corner of the bar since all the table seating were taken when we arrived.  The place is small and cozy.  I guess this atmosphere is best for fondue, however, I can see it being busy on a weekend night with a long wait.  We went on a Thursday night at about 7:30 pm and the place was crowded but I would not say packed. There is about 10 bar chairs to sit at the bar and about 10 small tables. that can be put together to make a big table.  We ordered a savory (cheese) fondue and a sweet (chocolate with a hint of cayenne pepper) fondue.  Both fondues were very good.  Better then some places I have been to for fondue.  The cheese was smooth and just a bite to it.  It was served with crostini, cut up squared bread, potatoes on one plate. On the other plate there were grapes, raw broccoli, gherkin pickles, and olives.  The sweet fondue was served with tiny marshmallows, chocolate sourdough bread, and madeleines on one plate.  The other had fruit consisting of bananas, kiwi, strawberry, grapes, and little mandarin oranges. The chocolate for the fondue was of decent quality and the cayenne pepper was just a hint which really accentuate the chocolate and flavors from the fruit.  We also each ordered a drink (sparkling wine, pomegranate margarita, and strawberry mojito) and those were good too.  The drinks were $7.  Savory fondue was $18 and the sweet fondue was $16.  The food was good but if you are hungry, do not go here since they are small bites and you will be hungry again after a few hours.  I repeat.......YOU WILL BE HUNGRY again in a few hours.

Also, they're definitely generous with the dippers but 6 oz of cheese was just a little too skimpy--I think 8 oz would have been perfect.  We had lots of stuff left over for dipping and no dip.  On the other hand, I was absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal so maybe they're protecting me from myself.  Anyway, the highlight of the whole meal was the dessert--the \"Happy Trails\"-- dark chocolate with cayenne was divine!

Next time I'll leave some room for the chocolate fondue.  The atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly. I'll definitely be returning for more.", "author": "Mag G."}

I'm a veggie so when the waiter said there is no hot oil for cooking meat I was very happy.  I hate that smell!    No, this is all great veggies and cheeses.   Our table of three had two of the cheese fondues which were both out of this world!  One, the traditional was very tangy - just the way my mom used to make for us at home but better!   The selection of dippers is over the top with little potatoes being the favorite.  They also had bread, olives, pickles, broccoli, and apples.   Excellent!   The dessert was fantastic!  We got the dark chocolate flavored with cayenne pepper.    Delicious!!    Yes it is expensive but we felt it was worth it.  Obviously not a place I can afford to go to every week but it's great for special occasions.  Or that cozy dessert that you want to share between the two of you one night.   This is perfect for that kind of meal.    Give it a try!", "author": "Tommy G."}
